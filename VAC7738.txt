                 ROMANCE  THE CHARTER OAK: A PICTURE OF COLONIAL TIMES.  WILLIAM SETON.  NEW YORK:   Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1871, by P. O'SHEA, In the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.   PREFACE. DEAR READER :- The story which we lay before you re- lates to that period of our colonial history, when James II. made an attempt to destroy the commonwealths which the Puritans had founded in America. He foresaw what might happen unless he crushed them in time, and accordingly sent over Sir Edmund Andros' for that purpose. The conspiracy formed during the governorship of Andros, to bring about a revolution and free the colonies from England, and of which we mak ne  of our characters the head, is no mythchut well proved by Berkeley's "Will and Doom," where mention is made of "a plot on foot in Connecticut, as well as other parts of tho   iv       PREFACE. country, to make insurrection, and subvert the government." Palfrey, in his History of New England, Vol. III., page 579, likewise speaks of this conspiracy:--"The author of a piece which I read in the British- State Paper Office, 'Re- flections on a pamphlet lately come abroad, entitled, Reasons for the Confirmation of the Charters belonging to the Several Colo- nies of New England,' declares that 'the sub- version of kingly government and the re-es- tablishment of their commonwealth in New England was long contrived before they knew anything of the Prince of Orange's arrival or design,' etc. Also, 'that such was their de- sign to rend themselves from the crown of England, will appear from the free and open confession of some well known in that con- spiracy, who have since declared by wit- nesses of undeniable truth, now here in Eng- land, that the design of seizing upon Sir Ed- mund Andros, and subverting kingly govern- ment in New England, had been long con- trived and resolved on, and was to have been   , .S PREFACE.        v done the beginning of January, 1688; and that those concerned in the late revolution were to have acted the like parts, at which time was no account of the Prince of Orange's in- tention of coming into England known in that land.' In giving the burial-places of the Rever- ends Hooker and Stone, we have not been quite correct. While many of the early set- tlers of Hartford were interred near the first meeting-house, these ministers were buried in a plot bought in 1640, of Richard Olmsted, which was situated about a hundred yards south of the green, and on the west side of Main  street.         W, S.    ROMANCE OF THE CHARTER        OAK. CHAPTER I. IT was a January evening in the year 1687. The ground was covered with snow, which had been falling steadily for two days, accompanied by a gale from the north-east, so piercing that no living creature could stand against it, and the deer and the wolves had sought refuge in the densest thick- ets. The open landscape seemed to be covered with great white billows, while in front of the cabin where Lydia Goffe and Prudence Garlic dwelt, there was such a huge drift that the entrance to it was quite blocked up. This humble abode stood not far from the right bank of the -Connecticut, river, but just now the stream was thickly frozen and so hidden beneath the snow that you would not have discovered it except for the air-holes through which, here and there, the blue water peeped out. . Around the house eight acres had been cleared and reduced to cultivation, while, as a protection against. wild animals, the whole was en-   8       ROMANCE OF THE closed by a fence of cedar posts, placed side by side, and ten feet high. Beyond the stockade lay the primeval forest, stretching for miles and miles, a dismal wilderness, from which strange, unearthly sounds seemed to issue, and it is no wonder that Lydia Goffe and her companion believed it to be the haunt of evil spirits. At the hour when our story opens, the tempest had come to an end, and in the west a strip of blue sky, which was growing every moment larger and larger, showed that the weather would be clear and bitterly cold. The sun was not far from the horizon, and Lydia, seated by one of the windows, was watching a flock of snow-birds hopping about out- side, picking up a handful of crumbs she had Sthrown them. Presently a gust of wind struck the house, making it tremble so, that she half believed it was going to rise and blow away. But the old logs remained firm in their places. Not so the little birds, however, 'who unable to re- sist the might of the blast, were sent whirling off, dear knows where. "Poor things!" she said, " how different is their lot from that of the robins and sparrows which visit us in spring. They now are singing merrily in some warm nook at the South. But 'tis the will of Providence. All cannot be happy alike." Lydia was entering her twentieth year. Tall and o   CHARTER OAK.        9 gracefully formed, she was at the same time blest with perfect health, and her shape bordering on embonpoint, was rather that of a Hebe than of a Sylph. She wore a homespun gown of a snuff color, which fell low enough partly to conceal, yet not entirely, a neat ankle, and foot wrapped in moccasin. Her nose was of the Grecian type, her forehead low, and she had a chin marked with a deep dimple; while her hazel eyes possessed a strange witchery that irresistibly drew you towards her. Lydia's whole expression was that of a joyful being, one who preferred to look on the bright side of things, but who at the same time might love the turmoil of the world and whose soul was full of ambition. The few freckles which marked her face, did not detract from her beauty, they were rather beauty spots which served to set off the exquisite whiteness of her skin, while over her shoulders fell a profusion of auburn curls reach- ing to her waist. The cabin where her home had been since childhood, (save a few months in the year 1680), was situated about thirty miles north of Hartford, in the colony of Connecticut, from which place it was separated by an unbroken wil- derness, with the exception of a dozen houses form- ing the village of Windsor, some twenty miles be- low them. It was a small, yet comfortable abode. In no part of tihe walls was a cranny to be found,    10       ROMANCE OF THE and the roof thatched with the tough native grass, kept out every drop of rain. Communicating with the south end was a shed full of dry oak and hickory, split and ready for the fireplace, also a wooden mortar used for pounding corn, a couple of axes, a churn, and one or two other articles of household use. From this shed, you passed by another door into a barn, filled with straw and corn stalks, barely sufficient to last the half dozen sheep, and the horse and cow, through the winter. The- life which Lydia led, was a very monotonous one, and although during childhood she had been contented enough, now that she was grown up her thoughts would often stray beyolid the forest, which on every side bounded her vision, and it required all her natural cheerfulness, and no small degree of filial love, to bear her exile from the world, as patiently as she did. Perhaps nothing contributed more to her happi- ness than being constantly employed. Every hour of the day, she was looking for something to keep her busy. She could bake corn bread even better than goodwife Garlic, and she could churn and spin. Indeed, nearly every thing she wore was of her own making. Moreover, she was a fair scholar, at least for those days, when books were not so easily obtained as now.' On the shelf, standing between the chimney and   i;J]:):t       CHARTER OAK.       " the window, was a well-fingered Bible, with many a dog leaf in it, while lying open on her lap was a copy of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. This work had only lately appeared, yet she had already read it twice. But Lydia-was far from being alone in her admiration of it. Throughout New England it was highly prized, and soon came to be next in circulation to the Holy Scripture. The only per- son, she and Goody Garlic had, to cultivate the clearing and assist them in taking care of the stock and poultry, was an Indian lad, belonging to the once powerful, but now vanquished and scattered tribe of Pequots. They had named him Christian, and a very good fellow he proved himself. Occasionally he might , steal off to shoot a deer or spear a salmon, but on the whole they found him industrious and the good- wife declared, he was as honest and truth-telling, as many she hIad known who did nothing but fast and exhort. They had no neighbors, and their only visitor was a man called Simon Adams, a short, thick' set individual, with beard covering nearly his whole face, and whom before long we shall introduce to the reader. In the settlements he was known as Mad Adams. Of a roving disposition, he used to travel from place to place, earning a livelihood in all sorts of ways,. now chopping wood, now hunt-   12       ROMANCE OF- THE ing wolves to obtain the -twenty shillings reward offered for their ears. On his right cheek lwas an ugly scar-the mark of an arrow wound received during the war with King Philip, in which struggle he had fought bravely, and he was one of the few survivors of the massacre at ;Bloody Brook. Lydia and he were great friends, he never came to the cabin without bringing her a present of solme kind, and it was at his last visit he had given her the Pilgrim's Progress. From him she obtained news of what was going on in the settlements, andL as he was fond of talkling, she had learnt more than she might from ten other people.  Theyv perfectlj agreed in their dislike of monarchical government, and he never looked so pleased as when he heard her expressing republican ideas. But Lydia's political opinions need not surprise us, whPa we learn that her father was one of those Ywho had signed the death warrant of Charles I. William Goffe was a son of the reverend Stephen Goffe, rector of Stanmar, Sussex. He liad married the daughter of Edward Whaley, whose wife was a sister of Sir George Middleton, and who belonged to a family, of great antiquity. Like his father-in- law, Goffe had early distingxuished himself in the civil war, had become a Colonel of Foot and com- manded Cromwell's regiment, at t9h battle of   CHABRTER OAK.       13 -Dunbar. He afterwards rose to the rank of Gen- eral, and was created a member of Cromwell's House of Lords. At Oliver's death he remained faithful to the interests of the Protectorate and signed- the order proclaiming Richard as his suc- cessor. Possessed of great disinterestedness and courage, and gifted with a comprehensive intellect, he was a man whom England could ill afford to lose. But the active part he had taken in the re- bellion was an unpardonable offence, and when Charles II. mounted the throne it was necessary for him and Whaley to flee to America, where they arrived in July, 1660. The people of Boston, headed by old Governor Endicott, accorded them a- hearty welcome, and during the first few months which they spent in that City they made no attempt at concealment, but walked freely about the streets where even the children knew them, and would say to one another as they passed: "There, look, those are two of Cromwell's men." Lydia's parent became especially liked on ac- count of his religious turn of nnd. Hedfver ab- sented himself from meetin on the Sabbath, and edified every body by his prayers and exhortations. But at length intelligence arrived from England which caused him and Colonel Whaley to believe they were not safe remaining where they were. The .Act of Indemnity had not included them,- /  "      ROMANCE OF THE and some persons, among whom were several lead- ing men of the city, began to question whether the magistrates were not bound to have them arrested. In order, therefore, to insure their own safety, as well as not to bring trouble upon those who had shown them so much kindness, the regicides, on the 26th of February, 1661, departed for New Ha- ven, which they reached after a fortnight's great suffering, for the weather was very severe. In New Haven they were welcomed by the Reverend Mr. Davenport and the citizens, who believed they had performed a righteous act in passing sentence of death on King Charles. But word of a proclama- tion for their arrest soon arrived, and then many worthy people grew timorous. In order, therefore, to free the Townsfolk from cause of anxiety, they fled a second time. But where they went to re- mained for years a mystery. Thomas Kellond and Thomas Kirk, zealous young royalists, were commis- sioned to scour the country in search of them. They offered rewards, hired Indians to assist in the pur- suit, but no trace could be obtained of the fugitives. As we are only interested in Lydia's parent, let us say, that after several hairbreadth escapes (having at one time been hidden under a bridge when his pursuers spurred over it), he came back in 1666 to the Reverend Mr. Davenport's abode, where, for ten months he remained   safely concealed, and !   - --v-CHARTER OAK.            15 whence he kept up a correspondence with his wife in England. This estimable woman wrote to him under an assumed name, amid he used to address her as Mother Goldsmith. Some of Mrs. Goffe's letters are exceedingly beautiful. In one of them she says: "Let us console ourselves with this, though we may never meet in this world again, yet I hope, through Grace, we -shall meet in Heaven." She did, however, enjoy the happiness of seeing him once more, for she came to America in the autumn of 1667, and passed a twelvemonth with him, under the good minister's roof. At the end of that time she died giving birth to a daughter, who was named Lydia. Soon after this bereavement, Goffe was again obliged to flee; his host's zeal in behalf of the Commonwealth having excited the suspicions of those who. were friendly to King James, and it having become whispered about that the dwelling might be searched. A, year after this a man arrived one night at Mr. Daven- port's, bringing tidings of the fugitive, and saying it was the wish of Colonel Goffe that his child should be brought to him. The messenger was Simon- Adams. Accordingly, at day break the next morn- ing little Lydia, half smothered in blankets, and in the arms of Prudence Garlic, a faithful domestic in the 'lelegyman's family, set out for the wilderness. The nurse was mounted on a pillion, behind Adams,   16       ROMANCE OF THE and, although the journey was tiresome, the weather proved fine, and they reached their destination at the. end of the third day after leaving New Haven. How Adams had fallen in with the regicide we will now briefly narrate.           - It happened one day when he was out hunting wolves that he came to a rock, close by the bank of the Connecticut river, in which there was a cave. The mouth was partly concealed by laurel bushes and ivy, but his practised eye told him that these were often brushed aside, perhaps by Indiains, or some wild animal whose den it was. While he was cautiously examining the 'entrance, he was startled by the sound of a human voice, and in another moment an emaciated being emerged from the dark recess. In his distress, Colonel Goffe re- vealed to, him who he was, and when Simon had heard his story through, he vowed that lie would neither betray him nor let him remain longer in such a wretched spot, with nothing to eat but roots and berries. "'Tis a special Providence," said he, " which has brought me here. One who has served so well the cause of liberty was not to be left for bears and wolves to devour." Then, after giving the regicide the small supply of bread and bacon he had provided himself with for his hunting tour, he hastened to Hartford, and soon returned with a couple of axes and a horse laden with pro-   :,  -       CHARTER OAK.       17 visions. Not many weeks elapsed before a log cabin was erected about half a mile higher up the river than where the cave was, and, after the hard- ships he had undergone, its mud plastered walls and thatched roof seemed like a Palace to Colonel Goffe; and it is by one of its windows that his daughter is seated, this January evening, twenty years afterwards, gazing out upon the bleak land- scape and wondering how long before Adams would come to see them again. The regicide is now advanced in years, and a great sufferer from rheumatism, so that, of late, he has been of no assistance in taking care of the homestead. But tle young Pequot, whom Adams had induced to enter their service, was, as we have already said, tolerably industrious, and under his man- agement the few acres which had been cleared yielded enough to supply their wants, and, all things considered, the old soldier had little to complain of. He had never been disturbed in his retreat. Indeed, so confident had he at one tine become that the searchl for him was aban- doned, that he ventured to show himself in Hart- ford. This was in the spring of 1680, seven years before our story opens. Adams had secured a home for himn there in the family of a Sea Cpatain named Bull, whose wifelreceived little Lvydia, then thirteen years of age, with a kindness   8^        BROMANCE OF' THE which few accord to those not of their own flesb and blood. But in spite of the precaution taken, the presence of the regicide, (who had assumed the name of Cooke), became whispered about, and news of it soon reached Sir Edmund Andros, then Governor of New York.    In less than a month the latter wrote as follows to the Governor of Connec- ticut. "To GovERNOR LEETE AND THE ASSISTANTS : Honorable Sirs :--Being informed by depositions here taken upon oath that Colonel Goffe hath been, and is still, kept and concealed by Captain Joseph Bull in the Town of Hartford, under the name of Mr. Cooke, the said Goffe and Colonel Whaley, (who is since dead in your parts), having been pursued as traitors-that I may not be wanting in my duty, do hereby give you the above information, no ways doubting of your loyalty in every respect, I remain, Honorable sirs, Your affectionate neighbor, and humble servant,: "NEW YORE, May 18, 1680.

Honorable Sir-,Although we must acknowledge our engage- ment unto your honor for giving us information of what had been offered to yourself respecting His Majesty's service. we should have taken it well had your honor been pleased to have given us an account of the names of the informers, (which vet we desire you would be pleased to do speedily), and we doubt not but to give you sufficient satisfaction to clear it up, that we are much abused by these false reports concerning the goodc people of this place. For the present, we know not how to aclinowledge any thanks to the informers, who (by the effect) seem to have acted under gross mistakes, (possibly) to delude your honor, and cast reproach upon ourselves of this place; for that we being upon a solemn occasion together when we received your letter, and   -/?.            CHARTER OAK.          19 information therein, we forthwith dispatched a special warrant to our Constable and Marshal to make a diligent search after the person mentioned, who, being upon oath, returned they had with all care and diligence made the said search, but could find no such person as was mentioned, nor any stranger that- in the least could be suspected to be any such person. After the search, our people were amazed that any such thing could be suspected at Hartford. But the Father of Lies is our enemy, and doth instigate his instruments to malign this poor colony; but we hope the Father of Lights will vindicate us in His due time; and we pray your honor's neighborly charity in the mean space, with due witness bearing against all that endeavor to abuse with false news and stories ; as is done by ourselves in such cases. Other- wise enough of such matter had not been wanting against neigh- bors to raise bad blood, by ill persons, betwixt such as desire to maintain good correspondence with our professed friends, that are nearly situated to us in this wilderness. We have nought to. add but our respects to your honor and that wh are, Honorable sir, your affectionate friends and humble servants, The Governor and Assistants present, Per their order signed, JOHN ALLYN' Secretary. These for the Honorable SIr EDGIDSND ANDROS, Knight and Gov- ernor of His Royal Highness' Territories in America, etc. * Here the matter might have ended, and Colonel Goffe have dwelt peacefully in his new home, had not the watchful Simon Adams discovered a plot to carry him   off and deliver him into the hands of Andros.  To avert such a fate, the regicide once more fled into the wilderness, accompanied by his daughter who had refused to remain in Hartford without him, and by the ever faithful Prudence Gar- lic. Since their return to the log house, Colonel Goffe For above see Colonial Records of Connecticut, by J. Ham- mond Trumbull.                     20       ROMANCE - OF THE had devoted a great deal of his time to Lydia's education, storing her mind with a knowledge of history, especially that of England. But it sur- prised him to see the little interest she took in the affairs of the old world, where his own hopes and affections centered, and she had more than once declared that it was here in America the Common- wealth would live again. The state of the country at this period (1686-87), was well calculated to excite interest. James II. had not long since mounted the throne, and the people of New England were very depressed. Only a few ignoble spirits, were rejoicing at what they conceived to lbe a favorable opportunity for promoting their own schemes. Conspicuous among these were Joseph Dudley and Edward Randolph. The former was the son of Thomas-Dudley, who had been Governor of Massachusetts in 1634, and had proved himself an honest, high-minded man. Unfortunately, he died when Joseph was but five years of age, and too soon, therefore, to exert any influence over him. In the spring of thWe year preceding the one when our tale commences, a frigate had arrived in Boston harbor, bearing Edward Randolph, whom the king had entrusted with commissions for func- tionaries of a new government over New England. It was to consist of a president, deputy president, and sixteen counsellors. Dudley had been ap-   --':f:      tCFA RTER OAK.      21 pointed the president. Two days afterwards Ran- dolph had written to the Governor and magistrates of Connecticut, informing them that he held a writ of quo-warranto against the colony. "His Ma- jesty," he wrote, "intends to bring all New ngland under one government, and nothing is now remain- ing onyour part but to think of an humble sub- mission and a dutiful resignation of your charter, which, if you are so hardy as to offer to defend at law, whilst you are contending for a shadow, you will, in the fist place, lose all that part of your Colony from 4he Connecticut to New York, and have it au oe-xed to that government, a thing you are c i-tainy informed of already; and nothing will prevent, but your obviating so general a calami ty to all New England by an humble sub- mission. Sirs, bless not yourselves with vain expec- tations of advantage and spinning out of time by my delay. I will engage, though the weather be warm, the writ will keep sound and as good as when first landed." This letter had beeA shortly followed by another, and a confidential one, from President Dudley to the Governor, urging Connecticut to seek a union witlh Massachusetts rather than with New York. But to this, Connecticut had paid no heed, pre- ferring to remain independent. Since then Ran- dolph, who was by nature a tale-bearer, had written    22       ROMANCE OF THE to England that Dudley was becoming partial to the Puritans, and that only himself and one other member of the new government belonged to the Established Church. Such being the state of affairs when Lydia had last heard from the settlements, we may easily un- derstand her anxiety to get further news, and how she longed for Adams to arrive. After the gust of wind had blown the flock of snow birds away, she turned her eyes in the direction of the forest, which, even at noontime, presented in the winter season a dark, forbidding aspect; but it appeared doubly so, now that the sun was down and night approaching. While she was thus gazing towards the west, she suddenly heard a voice calling out for a spade. "That sounds like Adams," she exclaimed, jump- ing up. "Yes," said Mother Garlic, wiping her hands on her apron; " he's not been here in a good while; it must be he." In another moment the goodwife had opened the door. But lo! she could see nothing except the high bank of snow, which rose before her like a marble wall. As she was staring at it, wondering- what to do, she heard a strange, puffing sound, and presently there appeared through the drift a pair of hands, then two arms, and in another moment   \'       COHARTER OAK.       23 alms, looking as if he were Santa Claus himself, stood before her. "If ever I was glad to get here," he exclaimed, gasping and stamping his feet, "'tis this evening. Why, the snow has been above my knees the, whole way from Hartford. But the worst drift of all is right in front of your door. Where's Christian? why isn't he at work clearing it away and making a path, where Miss Lydia might walk vp and down and take some exercise? Tut! this fashion of get- ting to barns by passing through sheds won't do. It'll take all the color out of our young folks' cheeke afore another generation. Christian, 'Christi'n!" But the Pequot had little relish for such kind of labor, and during the past 6to hours, that is, since the storm had ceased and the blue sky told him the morrow would be fine, h , had been perched upon a heap of corn stalks fastening on a new set of arrow-heads, for he was determined to enjoy a day's Moose hunting. He heard Simon calling, how- ever, and presently his broad face appeared all in a grin. But whether it was pleasure at seeing his old friend or the ludicrous aspect the latter present- which caused his mirth,wecannottell. Certain it is, however, that Adams was the only person ever could make him laugh, and at this moment the new comer presented., indeed, a comic appearance -his shaggy beard covered with icicles, and his pulpy   24     v ROMANCE OF THE nose, usually red as a beet, now white as wax, for it was frosthitten. "You out of breath," exclaimed the lad. "Ha! no wise, me glide on top snow, you, like deer, push straight through." For an instant Simon frowned, but the truth of the Indian's words made him only angry with him- self for not having made use of snow shoes. He was on the point of answering when Lydia seized his arm and pulled him towards the fire. "Now dry yourself," she said, "and give me the news."'  "Humph! I've enough to tell, Miss," replied the honest fellow, rubbing his proboscis with a handful of snow; "but I must get supper first. O, dear, how my nose begins to prick." "Well, is it good news or bad?"5 not thinking, in her impatience, aught about his suffering. "Bad, and I'm glad!" Here she let go his arm and gazed at him in won- der. She knew him too well, however, to believe he wished the colonies ill; what then could he mean? "How's the colonel?" he asked, after giving a groan and shutting, for a moment, his twinkling eyes. "Father's rheumatism is about the same; he'll \ be delighted to see you; and since you won't tell \.   me what has taken place in the settlements, go up stairs and tell hin." But instead of pulling off his deer skin coat and doing as she suggested, he began to stare at her. "You're just a mite paler," he said, presently, "than when I was here last. The long winter has kept you too much in-doors. To-morrow I'll clear a good piece of snow away and then you can take your regular walk. I have great plans laid out, Miss Lydia, and I don't want you to fall sick and die. ' You must live, and a long time too." While he was speaking, his fingers kept tearing the icicles out of his beard, Christian continued to grin, and Mother Garlic stamped her foot. The dame felt vexed both at Adams and Lydia. The latter, in her opinion, cared a great deal too much about the gossip from Hartford, and during the last five minutes had kept their visitor stand- ing on the edge of the hearth, until now there was a puddle of water at his feet, instead of helping get -ready the supper. "Come, -hild," she exclaimed, "have an eye to the corn cake; it'll be dark afore we can cook enough for him to eat. Come, to work." "Well, indeed, I have an uncommon appetite, and I'm glad you know it," said Adams, turning his eyes on the goodwife; at the same time he be- gan pulling off his coat. Lydia helped him get his  26       ROMANCE OF THE arms out of the sleeves, then hung it up on a peg. As she did so she remarked that the pock- ets seemed well stuffed. "Humph!" said Simon, "wouldn't I be a queer fellow not to bring any thing with me when I come? I only see you three or four times a year. When you were a babe I brought you to this spot, and I'm not going to let you grow into a weed if I can help it. This is a lonesome home for any body, especially for a lass'such as you. I only wish I had brought you more books." "Do not pity me, Adams; I might go off and not be as happy as I am here, even if duty to- my father did not keep me." "True!" ejaculated Mother Garlic, who, while she was busy taking the cups and saucers out of the cupboard, still had her ears wide open; "Ah, Simon! I fear you're a tempter; talking about having great plans ilaid out! Child, beware of what he says. Beyond these woods is the world, the flesh, and the devil." "Indeed! ha! I guess you feel as I do when 1 have eaten my fill, that nobody else can be hungry. You had your fun once on a time, and now you want this girl to stay here until her pretty face '1: be allwrinkled. Although Miss Goffe is too good to complain, I know she longs to see what you call the world, the flesh, and the devil. A thousand   CHARTER OAK.       27 pities she left Hartford to come back to this wilder- ness seven years ago! Mrs. Bull would have taken as good care of her as if she had been her own child." These words brought a blush to Lydia's cheek, for he was speaking exactly the truth. Although, as before remarked, she was of a happy disposition, there were times when she could not help chaffing in this cagelof a home, and her thoughts of late had more than once soared beyond the pines which sur- rounded the. clearing; while Adam's visits, and his accounts of what was going on in the Colonies had awakned an ambition she hadnot been conscious of before. But now let us see what she is pulling out of the honest fellow's pocket. First came a paper of tobacco. "Oh! won't father be glad to get this," she ex- claimed, "and what a nice pipe too, so different from the corn-cob one he has been using. Really, Adams, 'twas very kind in you to think of him." He nodded, then turned and gave Prudence a triumphant look. "And what is this?" thrusting her hand in again and producing a pack of cards. She stared at them a momentI, for they were the first she had ever seen; then looked inquiringly at the goodwife. "Beware, beware child!" cried the latter, with a slight shriek, " touch not what the church forbids.     28'      ROMA NCE OF THE Drop those poisonous things as you value your soul's salvation." "Then they're not the first you've seen!" growled Adams. "If these pieces of pasteboard with strange devices are meant for any unholy amusement, I cannot accept them,' said Lydia; restoring them to the pocket; "the church knows what is best." "Well, do as you like," said Adams; " they'll be a gift for the Colonel. He's as good a Christian as Increase Mather, yet I'm sure he won't scream and make a fuss when he sees them." But his frown quickly disappeared, as Lydia produced gift num- ber three, which seemed to puzzle her full as much as the cards; this was a jew's-harp. "Well, that you won't refuse, nor Goody Garlic either," he exclaimed; "'twill mellow her crabbed spirit and make the prayers flow from her mouth, like sap out of a young maple when it's first tapped." "Oh, how you talk," said the girl, looking re- proachfully at him. "I mean, that that 'ere article is for lmaking music, and music comes nearer to what I con- ceive heaven's delights to be than anything else. Why, when I used to go to meeting (I say used to go for I ain't been often of late) I never felt a mite of religion till they had struck up a psalm. Now, Miiss Goffe, I see you're laughing; 'taint right, I'm a great sinner, I know, and it'll take a deal of   ,; f         CHARTER OAK. 2. music to carry me through to Zion; but don't laugh, if all were like yourself meeting houses wouldn't be needed. But to come back to the subject of card playing, I really cannot see how it is sinful.  Why ain'tI as good a judge about it as Increase Mather, who blows such a loud horn!" Lydia did not reply, -as he-seemed inclined to be disrespectful in speaking of the clergy. Present- ly he took the jew's-harp from her and began playing upon it with such skill, that in less than a minute dame Garlic's head, then her whole body, was swaying from side to side, while one of her fingers beat time on the bottom of a plate. Perceiving the effect which the melody produced, he continued to play harder and harder, and would perhaps have kept on for half an hour, had he not heard the-Colonel calling him. At once he took the instrument from his lips, returned it to Lydia, then drawing from his pocket the pack of cards, hastened up the stair-case. He found the old soldier abed, and a good deal altered since the last time he had seen him. His face was thinner, while so much hair hadfallen out that the crown of his head was quite bald. But his eye shone as bright and his voice sounded as cheery as ever. After a hearty shake of the hand, Adams drew up a bench and sat down close by the bed.    30       ROHANCE OF THE "I thought you might be here soon," said the Colonel; "but I didn't expect you right after such a storm. Why, it snowed all to-day and all yester day, and only stopped a couple of hours ago." "And cleared up awful cold," said Simon, feeling his nose, which was regaining a little of its :natural color. "Well, I had snug quarters in Hartford and jolly fun at the Bunch of Grapes tavern, which you must know, sir, I've got a license to keep; but sud- denly I began thinking of you and Miss Lydia; queer notions came into my head. Wolves had broken through the stockade and eaten you up- you were burnt out-provisions had failed-you were starving. In fact I grew so nervous that with- out waiting for the weather to clear, I started off to see how you were." "C It was very kind, Simon, very kind. But you've got frost-bitten. Be sure now and keep away from the fire." "Yes, I wasn't aware of it till I reached the house. Lord how it does prick! It feels as if somebody was making a pincushion of my nose." After giving a groan, for the pain was really sharp, he produced the pack of cards. "Here, sir, is something I brought your daughter, hoping to please, but that crotchetty nurse told her not to touch them as they'd poison her soul, therefore I concluded to make 'em a present to   or?: %CHARTER OAK.           31 you, who no doubt have overcome your ancient scruples and yet say full as many prayers as ever." "Well, I'm not quite as particular about some things as I was once upon a time" -here the Colonel smiled --" but let me see what you have." Adams unrolled the paper and showed him its contents. "Why, no, I don't believe there is any harm in these," said the Colonel. "The people of New England go too far in their religious notions. However, that is better perhaps than going to the other extreme, as I've known many do in Europe, and having no scruples about anything," He now took the cards and placed them for safe- keeping under his pillow; we say for safe-keeping, as he knew the goodwife would not hesitate to de- stroy them if she found them within her reach when she came to sweep next morning. Having done this he asked Simon to begin and tell the news. He felt especially anxious to heart what had- oc- curred in England. At once Adams commenced, and Colonel Goffe listened-with the deepest interest. "I half believe," he exclaimed, when the tavern keeper had finished, "that Lydia is right. The King will force the best people in the Mother Country to come over here; yes, she has often de- clared her faith in the -commohwealth living again in America. Now, one of my chief reasons for    32       ROMANCE OF THE wishing these colonies justly treated, is to prevent that restless craving for independence, whieh, you say, is beginilg to show itself. Let them as far as possible manage their own affairs, yet never cut adrift from England. Bnt, Adams, you ought tc hear Lycia talking on this subject. Oh, how en- thusiastic she beconles!" "She and I have often spoken about it, sir; she has a broad mind, a great soul." "Dear child!" pursued the Colonel, (' anywhere else but in this lonely forest, she'd make a mark I'm sure of it." "True as Gospel!" muttered Adams, folding his arms and staring at the floor. During the next few minutes he did not spead another word, but seemed to be meditating deeply on something.  The room was growing dark. "God grant," he exclaimed, suddenly looking up "that my plans may succeed!" "Pray what are they, Adams?" "Never mind, sir--by and by-here she comes." Lydia appeared just then at the top of the stair- case, carrying- in one hand a flipding (a hollom dish filled with hog's grease, with a twisted rag in it, which being lighted, served for a candle,) and in the other a tray with a bowl of milk and some slices of toast. "Now, Adams!" she exclaimed, smiling, "go )   down, supper is ready; you and nurse can talk politics together. "But ain't you coming too, Miss?" "No, I'll remain with father." "Nay, child," said the Colonel, "place those things near me so'that I may reach them, and go have a chat yourself with Simion ; it's not often you have the opportunity. I'll eat alone this evening." Glad of the permission, she put the tray on the bench near the bed, hen withdrew to the lower floor, followed by Adams. No sooner did the latter catch a glimps e of th  e aethan he sroe iftly up to it, then for at least a minute, stood perfectly i:-; still, his face as grave as a judge. He was saying grace. "Glad you ain't give up praying altogether," re- marked the goodwife when lhe had finished. "I never feel so pious as just before a hearty meal," said Adams, taking his seat. "Gracis the sincerest prayer I akea, The very smell of victuals stirs my spirit more than a sermon."' Certainly he could not complain of gther repast spread before him. It was the best the cabin could afford. On a large wooden platter were slices of fried venison, then came a dish of boiled Indian meal, a jug of maple syrup, a cold pumpkin pie, corn cake and a pitcher of milk; but there was neither tea nor coffee-the former not coming into   34       OMzANoCE OF THE use until 1750, the latter not before 1770. The plates were of pewter, and there was no table cloth. Lydia immediately filled the bowl to the brim with milk, then helped him to the largest slice of meat. "Thanks!" he exclaimed, snatching up his fork, "but don't mind me, eat yourself; and make haste, for when I begin the news your appetite'll vanish." "How so?" she inquired, taking a seat next to him. "Bad news isn't good for it," speaking with difficulty, as his mouth was already full. This was all he said for ten minutes and until he had swallowed his second bowl of milk and devoured three-quarters of the pie, to the no small grief of Christian, lwho was very fond of it. In the meanwhile Lydia partook of a little her- self, then waited as patiently as she could until he was ready. "But although the news is bad," he said at length, drawing his sleeve across his mouth and smacking his lips, " as I told you at first, I'm not sorry. No matter how overcast the sky may be, there's always sunshine above the clouds. A tem- pest purifies the air. Freedom springs from op- pression. We need a despot here to rouse the people ; and when they do rise-then, by Jehovah!   CHARTER OAK.       35 no more Dudleys, no more Randolphs, no more Androses will ever trouble them again." As he spoke he brought his sledge-hammer fist down upon the table with a thump which made every cup and dish rattle, so that Mother Garlic and Lydia believed they were falling to pieces. The girl could not but think what a terrible fellow he must be when in a passion, and wondered if that were not the reason they called him 3Iad Adams; while the dame hastened to fill his bowl for the fourth time in hopesof calming him. But he pushed it away, nearly overturning it, and Prudence then placed herself on the opposite side of the table, for she was beginning to be afraid. When his excitement had subsided a little, he brought the cup back again, then raising it to his lips took a long draught, after which he began seriously to give the news. ," We've lately," said he, turning to Lydia who stood at his elbow, "had a change of rulers. Dudley is no longer president." Here another pause during which he emptied the bowl, then went on: "You must know, Miss, that towards the end of December, a frigate called the Kingfisher arrived at Boston, bearing Sir Edmund Andros who had been sent to take his place. Now, this Andros is the same who was Governor of Man- hadoes just after the Duke of York recovered that   36      ROMANCE OF THE Province from the Dutch. It was he who wantec to encroach upon the domain of Connecticut, an( if it hadn't been for the bold stand which Captail Bull and his hundred followers made behind thl ramparts of Saybrook fort, he might have succeedec in his impudent claim. And he is the same, too who wrote to Governor Leete in 1680, informing him that your father was -concealed in Hartford O how I hate him! But now the wolf is again upon us; we must not fall asleep. One of his first acts has beenbo create Dudley a Judge of the Superior Court, and he has brought over from England a new flag, which bears a red cross on a white ground." "A cross, did you say!" exclaimed Lydia and Mother Garlic simultaneously. "Yes, a red cross on a white ground, and in the centre there is a crown wrought in gold with the letters J. R. Still if that were all, much as I dis- like anything which smacks of Popery, I would not call it much. But he is sternly carrying out the policy of His Royal Master towards Massachusetts, and if that Plantation is humbled, woe to the others, for she is our guiding-star."  "True!" exclaimed Lydia, "God bless Massa- chusetts." "-Then, again, he intends to allow no taxes to be collected except by himself; and he also vows that    ^'    .... CHARTEn OAK.          37 he'll crush out the religion of the Pilgrims. Why, on the very day he landed he began searching for a meeting-house which might accommodate his half-popish followers." "Shocking! Adams--shocking!" "Oh, Miss, sinner though I be, and although I have some peculiar notions of my own in regard to church matters, I'll fight to the' death for the faith of my parents who came over in the lay Flower." "Well, Simon, tell me how have the people borne all this?" "They are begniing to show their teeth. In- crease Mather, who is no coward, told'Sir Edmund to his face that he should not use one of our meet- ing-houses."*  "But suppose Andros persists, what then?" "Ha! what then! didn't I say, that the news made me rejoice?  Why, then, a fire will be lit which King James will never quench. These colonies will become free and independent." "Too good almost to hope for, and yet I believe it is coming." As Lydia spoke she clasped her hands. "But all isn't told yet," pursued Adams, who evidently took a fierce delight in narrating the wrongs which were being perpetrated. "The new Governor has forbidden town meetings. But, worst of all, or rather in my view of things best of all, * Palfrey. Hist. N. E., vol. iii., p. 521.    38       ROMANCE OF 1HJl he has announced that owners of land must apply to him to have their titles confirmed. This is the opening wedge whereby he intends to deprive many of their property in order to give it to his retainers. I feel sure, also, he'll not be long in demanding of Connecticut to surrender her charter, just as Randolph did." "He'll never get it," said Lydia, her eyes flashing and her countenance so full of enthusiasm that Adams stopped a moment to admire her. "' But I hope he'll try," "But he'll never get it, Simon." "If all were like you, perhaps not." Then drop- ping his voice too low for her to hear: "Would," he said, " that the Captain could lay eyes on her. Yes, I must try. I'll leave no stone unturned to bring it about. Charity Crabtree's letter may help me." "But does Andros give no reason for declaring void all titles to land?" inquired Lydia; "is his method open robbery, the right of might?" For a moment Adams rubbed his forehead as if trying to recollect something. "Oh no, Miss, al- though his scheme is founded on a wickedness, it still has a shadow of reason." Here he again rub- bed his forehead, and stammered: "You see, the highest Tribunal in England having declared the Charter of Masschussetts void, then, according to   39   CHAIRTER OAK.'   English law, every right and privilege founded upon the Charter, falls with it. Now among those rights was that of conveying land, and that right failing, the title of the assigns fails also. Hence it follows that every acre in Massachusetts belongs at this moment to King James II., by hereditary and offi- cial descent from Henry VII., the original Chris- tian owner." While he was speaking, Prudence had kept her grey eyes fixed upon him, and when he was through she burst into a laugh. "An ingenious explanation," she said; "pray is there not some- body in the settlements whose words you learn by rote? from the hurried way you spoke, you seemed afraid of trusting your memory." Adams scowled at her a moment, then shrugging his shoulders went on: "Now what- is done in one Plantation will be done in all, until our necks, tired -of bending, the day of glory shall arrive. The hunter will abandon the deer track, the farmer leave his plough, and there will be such a stirring of New England's spirit as will make many call it a fire from heaven.' "And so it will be, Adams. Is not the hand of Providence visible in our short history? The ocean didn't swallow up the May Flower; nor did the cold winters and the savages prevent those who came here to serve Christ from spreading further 40       ROMANCE OF THE and further into the wilderness. King James can.- not crush those whom the Almighty protects."  Oh, Miss Goffe!" exclaimed Simon, " a thous- and pities there is no meeting-house close by where; you might exhort. Why, do you know, you stir the very marrow in my bones, and draw the frost from my nose so that it doesn't prick any more." "Hypocrite,!" muttered the goodwife, "if she exhorted an hour, she'd not pull them caids out of your pocket." He was meditating a reply to these stinging words when jLydia heard her father call, and off she ran without waiting to hear what he said. "You may abuse me as much as yon like, dame Garlic," he exclaimed, " but it shan't change my opinion; she is a wonderfully gifted body, and I don't think it right for her to remain always in this desolate spot; nor shall she if I can prevent it." "Then you'd take the child away from her aged parent, would you? You know Colonel Goffe dare not show himself in the settlements; he tried it some years ago and had to flee." "Well, in the first place," returned Adams, "she is not a child, just look at her! Why I've been to many a husking party and never yet seen a. maiden so lovely. What an armful she'd make!' At these words Prudence gave a scream, but with- out minding her he went on: "It" wouldn't take a !I   week to kiss her freckles away--now don't fly at me for saying this"---the goodwife had suddenly placed her hand on the broomstick. "Then again,'" he continued, " think what service she might do the country; why, a person of her spirit would be worth a dozen Train-Bands. And if she went to the settlements mighn't you accompany her, while I staid and took care of the Colonel? Where would be the danger with you at her side? Now don't look bewildered. The fact is, both you and the old gentleman forget that she is now a woman." Here he paused, and for the next five minutes neither of them opened their lips. HEe had indeed confused the dame by this novel proposition, and at- first she hardly knew whether to scold or not. Little by little, however, a light. seemed to dawn upon her; it was as if she were awakening from a dream. "Yes," thought Prudence, "'tis a good many years since Lydia's childhood; never has she seen any one but myself, Christian, her father and Simon, except during her brief sojourn in Hartford, when sloe was entering her teens. Is this just? Ought she, even for the sake of a parent,to continue hidden from the world?9 While these thoughts occurred to her, Adams rose, and lighting his pipe stood with his back to the fire, apparently as deeply absorbed as herself.   42       ROMANCE OF THE At length Prudence also left her seat and began washing up the dishes. "I didn't come here to-day," he resumed, after allowing her time to think over what he had been saying, "without bringing you a present as well as Miss Lydia. And I believe you'll like it better than a jew's-harp; unless I am much mistaken it is a missive from a long forgotten friend-look 1" here he drew from his pocket a crumpled letter, while the old maid without ceasing to wipe the plate, slyly turned her eyes towards him as if she only half believed what he said. In an instant her heart was throbbing violently. "I don't ask you to read it aloud, albeit my curiosity would be much gratified if you did; here -take it." Now considering that the paper he held towards her was unsealed,his language was not a little pro- voking, for she knew he was quite capable of hav- ing already pried into its contents. She did not, however, accuse hinm of this, but with a trembling hand adjusted her specs-then, as she opened it, said: "You might have let me have it before." "Then my 'wittles' wouldn't have tasted so good," he replied, winking at Christian, who had just awakened from a doze. "Your whole mind      would not have been given to broiling the venison steaks." This remark passed unnoticed, the dame being too intent on the persual of the letter. As she proceeded her countenance gradually softened, and by the time she got to the end,Lydia, who had returned from her father's room, saw the change and declared her nurse had grown younger. '* What is that!" exclaimed the girl, placing the tray on the table; then going up and peeping over her shoulder: "Some riddle he's been giving you to solve? I hope he's brought a good budget of them." - "No, no, child," replied the goodwife, wiping her eyes; "'tis a letter from an old friend, one whom I used to know in New Haven when I was a servant in Mr. Davenport's family. She says she's often wondered what had become of me, for you, must know, Lydia, that I slipped off in the night- time with you in my arms, without telling a soul where I was going; and now it seems slie's heard I'm among the living and wants me to pay her a visit. Her home at present is in Hartford. Truly Adams"--here Prudence turned towards the latter with an expression of the deepest gratitude -" you were a good fellow for stumbling on Charity Crabtree."   "      ROMANCE OF THE "How affectionately she writes, doesn't sh said the tavern keeper with a grin. "Then, just as I suspected, you did read before giving it to me," exclaimed the dame, ing hard to appear vexed. "I did not, but your friend, with whom I amn intimate terms, read it aloud before ftting it i my hands." "Well, tell me now," continued the goods "how came Charity to discover that you knew m "Ah! how? Well, I've told you already tha have a pet scheme which, sooner or later, I h, to carry out; and one day while I was talking her about it, I happened to mention your na: O, you should have seen her start!

Although I'm a great ta er, no words of mine shall ever betray the Color I did indeed mention Miss Lydia, but I said E was your niece."   - X -       CHARTER OAK.        45 Here the goodwife clasped her hands, and cried out, "Oh, what a fib to tell!" then asked how long since the letter had been written, for there was no date to it. "No longer ago than yesterday. It's doubtful, however, if I'd have brought it so soon, on account of the storm, if I hadn't got uneasy about you all. Queer notions came into my head, and so I started off at once. Of course you mean to go? and you'll take -Miss Lydia too.-I insist upon that,-she's ex- pected as well as yourself." Here Lydia gazed inquiringly at Mother Garlic, who was sorely puzzled what to reply. "It might do the dear child no harm; nay, I'm willing to believe the change would be beneficial," answered the dame, in a tone slow and measured, "provided she kept in her heart the same devotion to Christ which she has here, and fell not into the snares that would be spread for her destruction. Child, would you like to visit the settlements?" "Oh, exceedingly," replied Lydia; "but father! who'd take care of him?"' "Leasve that to me," said Adams; "I'm going up stairs again, presently, and I'll broach the sub- ject, and so sure am I he'll grant my request that' you may consider yourself henceforward Goody Garlic's niece, or, if you please, her daughter-    "      ROMANCE OF THE there's such a resemblance between you." Here he laughed, and glanced towards the old maid. "Now, don't speak thus," returned the latter. "If you mean to make fun of my wrinkles, remem- ber that Lydia's. own fair skin will not be as it is now forty years hence, if the Almighty spares her to reach that age." These words were uttered with so much feeling that Adams was touched. "Well, well, forgive me," he exclaimed; "I know I'm a rough fellow, better fit to be with lumbermen and hunters than the like of you and Miss Lydia. Forgive me, and then T can go and play cards with a quiet spirit." ' As he appeared sincere she let him shake her hand, but as he was doing it she determined to warn him once more against the sinful amusement. She wished also to tell him that she had scruples about the girl's taking a false name. He must have guessed what was on her tongue, for suddenly he drew back with a grin,- and in another moment was darting up the stair-case. Pre- sently Christian stretched out his arms and gave a yawn, then rose and went out to take a look at the stock and see if any wolves were prowling around; for after such a snow storm some of them might mount upon a drift and get inside the stockade. While he was thus employed, Prudence and Lydia finished washing and putting by the supper-things,   CHAMRTER OAK.    after which they sat down near the fire and there, needle in hand, began chatting about society in a way neither of them had ever done before. At length, so unmindful did the goodwife become of all her own precepts, that she suddenly found her- self describing a rollicking husking party in New Haven in the years long gone by, where a saucy youth had kissed her twice 6n each cheek. She had just let. slip this fact when she stopped, bit her lip, and refused to go on with her story, although Lydia pressed her hard. "The world's vanities," thought Mother Garlic, "will come soon enough when once the'dear child leaves this cabin. Happily the laws are strict and forbid kissing, as well as ribbons, laces and silver ornaments, and it will tare the devil some time to throw his net around her, if he ever does, which Christ forbid."    CHAPTER II. MOTHER GARLIC saw nothing more of Adams that evening, for he remained with Colonel Goffe playing cards till long after she and Lydia had gone to to bed. Before retiring, however, she stood a mo- ment listening at her master's door, and when she discovered what bIe was doing fell on her knees  48       ROMANCE OF THE and prayed the Lord to forgive him, It shocked her beyond measure to see one whom she. esteem-, ed so highly, thus led astray; and although Si- mon had given her a great deal of pleasure in bringing the letter from Charity Crabtree, she still could not forget that he had likewise intro- duced forbidden things into the house, and for more than an hour she lay awake on her couch, groaning over it. And when she opened her eyes again, after a fitful slumber, it was the first thing entered her mind. "I'llI take care of the child at any rate," she said, as she bustled about the fire- place next morning, with nobody to help her, for Lydia had remained awake even longer than her- self, thinking of the probable visit to Hartford, and consequently was rather late rising. "No doubt," she continued, " it'll do the child good to see a lit- tle of 'the world; I'll do my best to keep her inno- cent. The like of Adams would soon make her worthy of the stocks and the ducking-stool. If he's wicked enough to play cards, he's wicked enough to drink, and then, dear knows to what ex- tent he may be in Satan's power." The object of her vituperation was at this very moment hard at work shovelling the snow away from the door. The sun had just risen and the air, even for January, was bitterly cold. Nevertheless, he seemed to enjoy it, and when, now and then, he   stopped to rub Ilis hands, he would glance up at the blue sky and grin. "If I succeed," said he, "in my plans, I'll wil- lingly do a fortnight's fasting. Ah! how delight- ful if I can only bring it about. Just think of it, all living together in a civilized place! This is not a fit home for a man of Colonel Goffe's age, broken by rheumatism, nor for a sweet blossom like Miss Lydia. No, she mutstn't be let grow into an old maid, which she certainly will if she remains here." Presently his look changed to a frown: "But it's too bad to think she must cut off those lovely curls; yet if Increase Mather sees her, what can prevent it? And Israel Barebones, the Ruling Elder, he too, vill insist on having them clipped. 1 don't believe Captain J'oe would object to 'em if he were only let alone; but he has such scruples about everything which isn't approved by the min- isters of the gospel, who are the very deuce for meddling. I've told him  a hundred times that we're just as good. as they are, and that we ought to do our own preaching. But because I hold such an opinion, folks call me mad, and I guess it's partly the reason why they've taken from me the' title of 'Mr.' Bah! what a queer world this is!" While he was thus soliloquizing, his shovel kept plunging into the snow, scattering it at such a- rate that one might have supposed he was working for    50      ROMANCE OF THE a wager; but he always worked with energy when he worked at all, and he had made up his mind not only to remove the drift, but also to clear a space in front of the house where Lydia might take some exercise. He believed fresh air was better for the health than anything else; and we know he had a special reason for wishing 'the girl to preserve hers.' Let dame Garlic say what she would, Adams was a kind-hearted being. It is true he drank ale and cider pretty freely, was fond of cards, and now and then would utter a profane word; but remember he had from boy- hood led a roving life, and never until lately had he chosen a home. While he was thus employed, laying the foundation of a voracious appetite, the door suddenly opened and the old maid peeped out. There was a sternness in her. expression which he had never noticed before, while at the same time her eyes showed that she was excit- ed. Now Adams was quick-witted, and guess- ed at once that she was bent on giving him a lecture, and if he wished to escape it he must, with- out losing a moment, turn her -thoughts on some other subject. So straightening up his back he bade her good morning, and inquired if she had had any dreams during the night. HeI knew this was an awe-inspiring subject; and sure enough, just as he had hoped, she forgot all about the ex-   hortation, and opening the door a little wider, re- plied in a solemn voice: "Yes, I did have one." "Then tell it to me, and I'll shovel all the harder while; I listen. Isn't there something in it about Charity Crabtree?-who, by the' way, writes down all her dreams." "As I do mine; but in this one there was nought about my friend." "Well, I'd give anything to see the book where they're recorded; women's dreams are so much more touching than men's! Hard world, good- wife, eh? if it weren't for the women folk." But although during the next five minutes he said more sweet things of the female sex than we care to repeat, he failed in inducing the old maid to tell- anything further about her vision; not that she disliked being questioned on the subject--she rather liked it, and used daily to read to Lydia a page or so out of a certain fly-blown manuscript which was kept on the top shelf of the cupboard- but she considered Adams not the kind of person to appreciate the wonderful things which, flitted through her brain during sleep. "Perhaps," he continued, as she was about shutting the door, "perhaps you think I'm not serious. Well, if you do you're mistaken; I be- lieve that during sleep spirits good and bad whis- per in our ears and sometimes foretell the future.    )I  -  52       OMANCE OF THE I've heard that Increase Mather holds the same belief, though it's not on that account I hold it. However, if you prefer keeping your dream secret, I'll not complain. Allow me to be more frank and tell you mine." The goodwife at once thrust her head further out, and turning her left ear towards him, bade him begin. "I dreamt," said he, with an inward chuckle, "that this log cabin was abandoned, and that you and the Colonel and Miss Lydia were living in Hartford-where you must know I have at last concluded to settle down-the girl married to one of the best of men, and yourself provided with a comfortable home for the rest of your days. Now that's the whole of my dream-what do you think of it?" For a moment after he had finished speaking she watched him narrowly, as if to satisfy herself he was not making fun of her. But his rugged face did not betray the least sign of a smile,nor did his black eyes twinkle as much as usual. He certainly appeared sincere. Then clasping her hands she murmured, "Amen!" and closed the door. " 'Twas something like my own dream," she muttered, as she began preparing the breakfast. "I wonder it never occurred to the Colonel nor me that the girl shouldn't stay any longer in these   I  dismal woods. Indeed, I hardly believe there would be any danger if he were to leave it himself. The spies who once discovered him in Hartford probably think he's dead. But if the worst came I to the worst and they were to find him again, this spot would always-be a refuge. Oh, if my dream could come true!" In a few minutes the pot of potatoes hanging over the fire began to boil, and as she stood in front of the blazing logs, she fancied she saw strange things in the embers. There, peeping up at her from beneath the forestick, was the face of Charity Crabtree, such as she had known it in her younger days. She did not reflect that time must leave altered it and carved more than one wrinkle on her friend's brow. She was still gazing at the fire when Lydia made her appearance, blushing to discover the table already set and the morning - meal almost ready; for she was by nature an early bird and had seen the sun rise oftener than Goody Garlic. Soon Adams entered, stamping the snow off his feet and blowing his fingers. "I knew the Colonel wouldn't object," he ex- claimed, addressing Lydia. "I made the matter so plain to him that he hadn't a word to say. Yes"--here his face broke into a grin--" you are to visit the 'settlements." "Indeed!" said the girl. "Well, the pleasure of   I,    514      ROMANCE OF THE going there will certainly be. great; but who will take care of father? It will not do to leave him alone with Christian." "Never mind that; my scheme is working to perfection. A bird's nest isn't built in an hour. Trust me, I can see my way clear to the end." In a few minutes the Pequot entered, then takl ing their places at the table they offered a short grace and sat down. Adams alone remained standing, and the figure which he presented was most comic, as with face turned slightly upward, he gave his eyes a downward slant on the jug of milk. When at length he finished his prayer, he followed their example and showed by his ravenous appetite that his morning's work in the snow had been severe. "'Twould take a good deal to keep me in 'wittles'," he said, after he had emptied his second bowl of milk. "Well, there's plenty, go on," replied Lydia, handing him another venison steak. "I can't refuse, Miss"--drawing a long breath- "while there's room the spirit's willing; I con- sider a hearty meal a kind of prayer, and experi- ence teaches me that appetite's the corner-stone of cheerfulness. I don'thelieve the Lord likes a sour face." They remained at table longer than usual, listen-    55   CHARTER OAK.     ing to Simon, who was anxious that the girlshould obtain as much knowledge as possible of the pleasant lives which people led in the settlements; and his words, as we may imagine, did not lessen her impatience to see the world, while the revela- tions which her nurse had made, the evening be- fore, of her own youthful frolics, prevented the latter from finding fault with the expressions of de- light which every now and then escaped her. When the meal was over, Christian went into the barn, where he supplied the stock with water and fodder enough to last till evening; after which, fastening on his snow shoes and taking a quiver full of arrows and his best hickory bow, he set off for the forest. He- intended to make this- a holi- day, and Lydia, as she saw him vault over the stockade, declared that she was not going to be pent up herself such lovely weather. The sky was never so blue, the wind had died away, and she re- solved to spend as many hours as possible walking in the cleared space which Adams had made in front of the house. Goody Garlic highly approved of her determination, and having wrapped her up in two thick cloaks bade her go enjoy herself. 'As for Simon, he felt as happy as a cricket, and kept running back and forth between 'the Colonel and Lydia, chatting and leaving behind him on the stair- case a stream of melted snow, which sorely tried the    56       ROMANCE OF THE temper of the old maidl. In a whole month Lydia had not laughed as much as to-day, and so swiftly did the hours pass that breakfast and dinner ap- peared like one meal. Then came the afternoon, which Simon spent in making a snow man, and even Prudence, who usually kept her countenance under control, could not help smiling when she looked at it; and when ait length the sun touched the tops of the cedars at the west, it was difficult for them to realize that evening had come again. Just as they were sitting down to supper the Pequot returned, dragging after him the hind quarter of a moose. This was all he had been able to bring home, and he told them that if they wanted the rest of the carcase Adams must help him get it. Accordingly, after satisfying their appetites, they started off in search of it, and walked briskly, too, for there was danger of the wolves reaching the prize -first. They were fortunate enough to find it untouched, and that night it was hung up in the woodshed, much to the satisfaction of Goody Garlic, who had begun to fear their supply of meat would run short. The week which followed Adams' arrival was a very happy one. The snow rapidly melted, and the sound of the water trickling down the side of the cabin was sweet music in Lydia's ear. Stumps which had been buried for weeks became visible   t:iI:"       CHARTER OAK.       57 again; while the pines and the cedar trees exhaled a balmy odor, such as we perceive when spring is approaching. Yet this was only the January thaw. Cold weather had still to come. As Adams has already informed us, Colonel Goffe had consented to let his daughter visit the settlements, and it was agreed that Prudence and Lydia, under the care of Christian, should set out for Hartford as soon as the trail along the river bank would be fit to travel upon; and judging from all signs, this would be in a very few days. Of packing there was little to do--a sheep. skin bag would suffice to hold their scanty ward- robe, and this the Indian might carry on his shoulders, while the women rode Jack, the same old horse which so many years before had brought them here froml New Haven. - Only once ailfte giving his consent did the Colonel appear to regret it; and on that occasion he spoke to Adams of the danger of travelling in midwinter, and hinted that they ought to postpone their visit until April. But the tavern keeper stoutly opposed any delay. "The thirty miles," said he, " can be easily ac- complished, Christian knows the road; in fact, who but a blind man could miss it, since it follows the Connecticut the whole  distance. Then again think, sir, how important that your daughter should make the most of her blossom days and not miss   58       ROMANCE OF THE any chance of getting a husband. Once under Charity Crabtree's hospitable roof, she will meet many God-fearing men, and I doubt not before the next chestnuts are ripe, she'll not be called Lydia Goffe any more. I see my words bring tears to to your eyes, sir, but you know how time slips away. It won't stand still; she can't afford to wait." Here the regicide bowed his head, and, although it was a sore trial, once more gave his full con- sent to the journey. If she went, would she come back?-what might happen during her absence? Many such thoughts rushed upon him, and it was a hard struggle to say she might go. "Moreover," continued Adams, after a pause, "if my scheme succeeds you won't be here long yourself. Ha! you look surprised; well, I shan't explain; but you know I'm a keen fellow, and you can put faith in me." "Yes, yes, Adams, I believe whatever you do will be for the best." "Well, then, sir, I repeat you may soon leave this place; I want you to be where you can enjoy life and get frequent news from England. That I know you would like above all things. Wherever I bring you, it will be among friends." At last the evening before the day of departure arrived, and everything was bustle in the cabin. Simon, who was going to remain and take care of    XIll OCHARTER OAK.            59 the Colonel, was being initiated by Prudence into the mysteries of housekeeping, and she was giving ilim the lesson in the most thorough manner. The cupboard was examined from top to bottom; cups, saucers, platters, pitchers counted; the flipding, and the grease to fill it, shown him; and then, withl uplifted finger, she cautioned him about sweep- ing the floor after every meal, even though he were the only person at table. "And on the afternoon of the seventh day," she continued, " be sure and scrub. But when the sun is down stop work, for then the Sabbath begins; remember the Bible says, 'the evening and the morning were the first day.' Let things be kept clean and neat, and don't let me return and find all topsy-turvy. I know the men folks hate to have their rooms put in order, and Colonel Goffe doesn't differ in this respect from the rest of 'em, as I've often observed when I'd be putting his odds and ends to rights up stairs. But try, Adams, and be a glorious exception, and so may the Lord give you a blessing." "And do take the best care of father," said Lydia ; "indeed I almost think it wrong for me to leave him when he's' so infirm. Don't forget to tuck the blankets under him every night, and sit up stairs as much as possible." Here she turned away saying to herself, "Ought    60        ROMANCE OF THE I to go?"At the same time she felt a longing to be off; it was an irresistible impulse. Presently she heard her father calling, and at once hastened to his roolm. I wanted to tell you," he said, runnilg his thin fingers through her curls, which "were streaming over the pillow, :' that you must leave me with A light heart. I give my full consent to this move; nay, I wish you to go." "O father! thank you for saying this," she ex- claimed, kissing him; "I would not have passed a single happy hour if you hadn't." "Thirty miles, Lydia, is but a short distance. Why, in Cromwell's army I've ridden that before breaking fast. Then again I will be much com- forted to think you are under the care of Prudence Garlic. She was long a domestic in the Rev. Mr. Davenport's family, and I know he would not have kept in his service any but a God-fearing person. Should it chance that you fall in with those whose conversation may not be edifying, boldly turn away from them. The country, however, is blessed with laws made conformable with Holy Scripture, and hence it is not likely there are many such per- sons to be found.

Ah, what scruples she had on this point." For an instant the regecide's brow contracted. "Does Prudence carry religion so far as that," he said, angrily, "when she knows what might hap- pen if the world discovered your true name?" "But her scruples, father, have been overcome; I told her I would not go unless I took another name." Here Lydia once more gave the old gen- tleman a kiss, then went below to assist Mother Garlic Set the table. As had been the case for a week past, the conversation at supper turned wholly on the coming visit to Hartford, and Adams, for the first time, hinted that the girl might have to cut off her tresses-he thought it best to prepare her for it by degrees. "How so!" exclaimed Lydia, quite taken by sur- prise. "Because the laws are very strict in regard to how we adorn our bodies, and as curls make    62      ROMANCE OF THE the-lassies so bewitching thley are not approved of." "Oh, in that case the child will not hesitate a moment," said Prudence, "and if you give her a pair of scissors she'll obey at once "--here the old nurse turned to look for her work-basket. "Nay," cried the tavern keeper, " why be in such haste? Let her wear 'em as long as possible. They'll touch a man's heart quicker even than her hazel eyes, or her dimple chin. Let them do all the good they can before they're destroyed." At these words Lydia blushed. To tell the truth, she loved her curls, and was not altogether pleased at the idea of losing them. "I wish I was the captain," thought Adams, fix- ing his eyes upon the girl, for he fancied she had never looked so beautiful; "it isn't often brains and beauty come together." When the meal was over, Lydia returned to her fatler's room, and advancing on tip-toe to the side of the bed, found he was asleep. Then softly, so as not to wake him, she fell on her knees and begged the Lord to spare her to get back. While she was praying, a wolf began to howl, and although it was a sound familiar to her ears since childhood, there was something about it this evening exceedingly mournful, and she could not help shuddering. Pre- senfly the old soldier awoke, and feeling her hand fr ,    X lCHARTER OAK.                63 on the coverlet patted it and told her he had been dreaming of her. She remained with him this even- ing till a later hour than was her custom-she could not bear to say " good-night;" on the morrow she was to'go among strangers, and these hours at her father's side were precious. Perhaps she exag- gerated the distance and the danger of the journey, yet her feelings were natural when we consider the lonely life she had thus far been leading. When, finally, she withdrew to her couch, she lay a long time awake listening to the wolf, and more than once the thought crossed her mind that she might never pass another night here. When, after a fitful slumber, she opened her eyes and saw the grey light of dawn stealing in through the little window at the foot of her bed, she rose and hastened to look out to see what kind of day it promised to be. The sky was without a cloud, and the morning star twinkled as it only does when it is extirmely cold. Having gazed out a moment, she put on her gown, then crept softly down stairs so as not to awaken the goodwife, who was still snoring. The fire was soon kindled, and roaring up the chimney with such a noise that one, at least, of the sleepers heard it, and in a few minutes Prudence appeared with a smile , on her face and an approving nod, as much as to say: "Well done, child!"But when she discover-     "      ROMANCE OF THE ed that neither Christian nor Adanms had, as yet, made their appearance, she broke out into a violent tirade against the whole male sex. Her voice soon roused the lazy ones. "We do all the drudgery," she cried, " and yet they pretend to be our betters and lord it over us just as our big rooster does over the hens. But he only crows and eats up the corn-does he, ever lay an egg? not he! and when the chickens are hatched does he take care of them? not he! O fie on the men folks! Mind, Lydia, if any man ever asks you to be his wife make your bargain before the knot's tied. If you don't, he'll lay awake mornings while you're down cooking his breakfast. O fie on 'em!"--here she stamped her foot--"I don't mean to be irreverent to scripture, but it has always been my notion that if Adam was.-made first, Eve was just worth two of him." "It's all very fine to talk that way," growled Simon, as he descended from the upper story; "but if it hadn't been for your side of the house we'd be living now in Paradise. Oh how the woman folk must love apples!'"  Scarcely had these words passed his lips when  down came a broomstick across his shoulders, then up it went till it touched the ceiling; then down again, swift and hard upon his right arm. In fact,    il '  **     ,CHARTER OAK.       65 he afterwards confessed it was the roughest usage he had received since King Philip's war. "That'll cure your saucy tongue," cried Pru- dence, lifting her weapon for a third blow. But she was not quick- enough--the tavern keeper was rushing towards the door and in another moment was safe outside. Just then Christian came sneaking down and went straight off to the barn where the stock were anxiously waiting for him. During the nexst half hour,' Lydia and the goodwife busied themselves preparing breakfast, and they made all the haste they could, for the sun would soon be above the horizon. When it was ready, Lydia went to the door and blew a horn, then lingered a moment on the threshold en- joying the breeze from the west, which, although it was keen, made her feel almost as if she could fly. Never had the heavens appeared so gloriously blue, and the sparkling snow looked as if Winter had been scattering diamonds over the landscape. "The nag is as full of the devil as a certain friend of mine," said Adams, presently walking up; "Jack has done nothing this morning but paw and neigh ; I bet he's had a dream  "Hush!" exclaimed Lydia, " you shall not tease nurse." For a moment Simon grinned, then, without   I     66       ROMANCE OF THE waiting for the others, begani his grace, after which he sat down, and for a quarter of an hour did not utter a word. The meal spread before him was certainly worthy of his undivided attention- the Indian cakes had never tasted better, and his hand was often stretched towards the jug of maple syrup. "I'd grow fat if I lived here," he sighed, unbuttoning his coat; "I'd like to eat one more griddle but I can't; it's not, however, for want of will." "Well, I'm sure there's not another girl in Con- necticut can make those cakes equal to Lydia," exclaimed Mother Garlic, proudly. "Well, it was you taught me," said the girl. "'Her merits will soon be discovered when she gets to the settlements," pursued Adams; "but come, it's time to be moving. Don't be long clear- ing off these things and pL-tting them away; I want you to take an early start, and travel brisk, so as to reach Hartford afore dusk." Here he rose, lit his pipe and walked out, turn- ing round, however, before closing the door to say that he would have Jack saddled in a very little while.  Christian followed him, and when they were in the barn Simon proceeded to give the youth some final instructions regarding the journey, and, for the second time, asked him if he would not take a rifle instead of his bow and arrows.   This the Pequot stubbornly refused to do. "I'm not afraid of wolves," said the youth; "if any of them come close enough I'll use my tomahawk." Perceiving that further argument was useless he dropped the subject, and stood silently by till Christian had put the saddle on the horse, merely remarking that it was time to have a new girth, as the present one was dear knows 'how old. In the meanwhile the goodwife was busy stowing away her own and Lydia's effects in a sheepskin bag,and the reader may be sure she did not forget her dream-book, which she was determined Charity Crabt ree should peruse, of course, on condition that the latter would show her hers. When she had finished packing, she gazed around to see if anyfithing else required her attention, but she could discover nothing;-there was not a crumb on the floor-every saucer and platter had been put by in the cupboard, and the whole room showed the mark of woman's attention. "How different 'twill be to-morrow," she sighed, " a, very day till I return, things will grow worse and worse; men folks love dirt and disorder." At length she heard the nag approaching from the barn, and immediately calling out to Lydia, who was with her father, to make haste, the dame put on her cloak. In another moment the old gentleman,who had resolved, infirm as he was, to   68       ROMANCE OF THE see them off, came slowly down the stair-case, leaning on his daughter's arm and looking like some ancient patriarch with his white beard and high, noble brow. In his right hand he held the pack of cards Simon had brought, and which had already afforded him a great deal of pleasure. No sooner did the dame catch sight of them than she groaned and rolled up her eyes. "Ought I," she asked herself, " to suffer the dear child's parent to go to damnation without a warning?no, no!"-- and as she pronounced the last word she advanced swiftly to the bottom of the steps. Colonel Goffe did not divine her purpose, nor did Lydia, who supposed she wanted to help him to a seat. Imagine therefore the astonishment of both, when Prudence with the impetuosity of a cat when she pounces on a mouse, seized the Colonel's hand, unbent his fingers and took away the cards., Never in all her life had the girl been so dumb- founded, and she looked anxiously at her father; but the latter controlled his: temper after a brief struggle, in which his eyes flashed  fury, and presently a smile broke out on his face. He knew that Mother Garlic was a religious fanatic, as he himself had been in formner days, and where would be the use of quarrelling, now that th ey were about to separate, perhaps for months; so without - uttering a word he advanced across the room, and   seating himself near the fire began to warm his hands. Such perfect composure astonished the old lady, who had not expected an easy victory; indeed if the truth must be told, she rather re- gretted his mildness, as it lessened her excuse for a parting exhortation. She felt herself suffering for the want of a vent-hole, through which her pent-up feelings might escape, and for half a minute after getting possession of the trophy, she could do nothing but bite her lip. Ought she to carry the sinful things away in her pocket, or de- stroy them at once? she chose the latter course. Approaching  the old- gentleman she address-' ed him in a solemn tone: "Colonel Goffe, if you don't reach Zion 'twon't be because I didn't try to keep you on the ,straight path " -then, be- fore he could even utter an exclamation, the pack was in the fire, twisting and turning into all sorts of shapes. Lydia, whose indignation could now hardly be restrained, flew to the corner where the tongs were kept, but Mother Garlic had placed them beyond her reach. " Oh, sir!" continued the dame, "when you hear the last tium pet calling us to judgment you'll bless me for what I've done." "Verily," he exclaimed, "  you take great interest in my spiritual welfare." " And should I not, sir? if we helped one an-    70       R nOMANCE OF THE other in this sinful world more than we do-if when a pilgrim strays out of the road we followed him to bring him back, how many that are lost would be saved. But alas 1 the way is rough -and tiresome, and we appear content if we can only get to Heaven ourselves. Oh, sir, think how much greater would be the bliss if we were all there to- gether, none of those whom we have loved on earth missing." This speech made such an impression on Lydia that she held her peace, while Colonel Goffe mur- mured "Amen!" Here Adams entered, "Come, come!" he ex- claimed, " the sun's up; it's not wise to delay, the trail my be slippery and you'll not be able to travel fast. Remember it's twenty miles to Windsor, but I don't want you to tarry there a momient; you must keep right on to Hartford, so as to reach it by nightfall." He did not alarm them by any allusions to wild beasts--not on account of Lydia, who he knew was fearless, nor lest he might shake the nerves of Mother Garlic--but because he had a misgiving that the Colonel, even at this late hour, might for- bid the journey. The girl now gave her father an affectionate embrace, then went out and stood a moment patting the horse's mane. Presently she jumped   nimbly into the saddle, while Goody Garlic who had followed her to the threshold, remained timid- ly gazing at the pillion, for it was many years since she had ridden on one, and she felt little inclined to trust herself in what seemed such an insecure place. In the meanwhile Colonel Goffe beckoned to the tavern keeper, and whispered something in his ear. In a moment the latter, with a fierce expression, strode up to the goodwife, and catching her by the waist lifted her without ceremony into the seat behind Lydia, muttering as he did so, "I hope the wild beasts will devour you; the road is infested with them." "Alas!" sighed Prudence, her hands tightly grasping the girl's frock, "I fear the largest of them remains behind in the fold; I shall pray for you, however." Simon grew pale with rage, and he was on the point of openly upbraiding her for having de- stroyed the pack of cards, when Jack of his own accord started off and left him to get over his anger by pounding his fist against the door. Colonel Goffe paid no attention to him, but stood with moistened eyes watching the party until the forest hid them from view. He then returned to his place, near the hearth, where he remained an    72       ROMANCE OF THE hour or more thinking of his daughter, and won- dering whenthe would see her again. But Adams at last disturbed his reverie by breaking out into a violent tirade against the laws of Connecticut, declaring that they were harsh and ungodly; and the foolish fellow was not satisfied until he had kicked Mother Garlic's broom into the wood-shed, where it lay for many days un- touched--if indeed it was ever used again. CHAPTER  III. THE party travelled briskly along the Indian, trail, but it was not until they had gone five miles and -more that the goodwife began to feel at her ease. Even then, whenever the path ran a little closer to the bank, she would tighten her grasp of Lydia's frock and hold her breath. "There's no danger," the latter would exclaim, "and, besides, if we were to slide down on the river, the ice would-not break, it is ever so thick." "You should have been born a man," was the nurse's reply; " nothing unnerves you." "Make good Indian," muttered Christian, open- ing his lips for-the first time since their departure. Little by little, however, her timidity wore off, and they began to talk about the, pleasure they    CHARTER OAK.       73 would have in Hartford. Once the conversa- tion was interrupted by a flock of mallard that were feeding at the mouth of a brook, whose cold spring water, where it emptied into the Connecticut, had kept a small space unfrozen. The splashing and. quacking which the birds made as they rose into the air, was enough to startle the goodwife, and ellen Jack pricked up his ears. But with this exception they pursued their way undisturbed; the Indian occasionally stopping to examine the track of some wild animal, and telling them if it was a ear or a moose. The forest was silent as death. Once a crow flew over them with a melancholy caw; at another time a bevy of partridges hopped down from a fallen oak and ran off into a thicket of hazel bushes; then a hare as white as the snow, leisurly crossed the path, and the creature looked so saucy that the Pequot could not help sending an arrow after it, which however, to Lydia's joy, missed the mark. It was not until they had accomplished what they believed was half the journey that they made halt; but in less than five minutes Christian urged them to remount---he seemed impatient, and turned Iris eyes anxiously toward the sun. "What matters it if we d&n't arrive 'till dark," said Lydia, getting on the saddle;- "a blind man couldn't miss the way, besides there's a full moon."   74       ROMANCE OF THE i,             i "It's only a whim of his," added Mother Garlic, whose courage had wonderfully revived since she had eaten a slice of bread and bacon. "Tut! there's no need of such haste." But without heed- ing either of them; Christian assisted the dame on the pillion, then shouldering again his bag, made Lydia a sign to follow. "There's five hours of daylight yet," thought the latter as she jerked the reins, " but it's as well perhaps to humor him; he's afoot, and by the time we reach our destination will be more tired than we, and no doubt wants to get early to bed." In a few moments the goodwifq was chatting again quitepleasantly, and Lydia listening with all the attention of one who had never seen anything of the world. They passed through the village of Windsor, bud did not stop, although it would have given Prudence and the girl much pleasure to have tarried a little, and conversed with the people. After they had gone a couple of miles beyond the ,settlement, Mother Garlic, who seemed as if she would never tire of relating anecdotes of her early life, found her discourse suddenly interrupted by an accident, which might have proved serious, but which happily only caused them a short delay. They had come to a spot where the bank was very low, and where the river had overflowed and frozen upon the trail. Christian turned and cautioned   !I         CHARTER OAK.       75 Lyvdia to go gently; but it was too late, the horse was already in the middle of the danger, and his hind legs beginning to slip. The nurse screamted, and throwing her arms around'the girl's waist, pulled her backward. Lydia implored her to let go; it was useless. She had barely time to stretch out her arms, when down they went. In an instant the Indian was by their side. "Mercy on me!" cried the goodwife, rising to her feet, "I'll never get on that horrid pillion again. "Let us thank God," said Lydia, "we are not hurt; in frosty weather bones are easily broken. til? Poor Jack, good Jack!" and she began stroking the creature's mane. "The brute ought to be whipped for his clumsi- ness!" exclaimed the dame. "No, you couldn't help it, could you?" said Lydia, still caressing the faithful, hard-working animal, who showed not the least disposition to get on its legs again. Presently the Pequot shrugged his shoulders and informed them that the girth was brolken. Here now was a predicament; it would .be idle to ask Prudence to ride bareback, and if she per- formed the rest of -the journey afoot, they would necessarily make slow progress. But she no sooner discovered what the difficulty was, than she   76      ROtMANCE OF THE declared she would rather walk twice the distance than go a hundred paces further on Jack. 'Lydia, however, did not object to mounting without a saddle. Accordingly, after the horse had been led across the ice, she again got on him, and with the deerskin bag in front, went off as gaily as though nothing had happened. The Indian could not help smiling at such perfect composure, and as he walked along with the saddle over his shoulder, found it difficult to hide his contempt for Mother Garlic, who was now in the rear, but keep- ing as close as possible to the horse's heels, and muttering to herself: "I do believe there's a special Providence watching over the child. Within the last two years she's fallen in the river twice and got lost in the woods, and yet has al- ways escaped unharmed." Soon her nervousness returned, and every min- ute or two she would glance over her shoulder, as if she feared something were pursuing them. "Be there many bears in these parts?" she ask- ed. The Pequot did not answer. "Yes," said Lydia, "the biggest of them, how- ever, wouldn't harm you." Oh, dear!" continued Prudence, "I'd not trust one of 'em; and they can climb trees too!" Christian now placed himself behind her, which somewhat revived her courage, and for the next   "   CHARTER OAK.   I        aiCHARTER OAK.      " three or four miles she did not speak a word about wild beasts. At length Lydia noticed Christian in- tently gazing at some object beyond the river. , "What see you?" she asked. "Wolf," the lad replied. Now in this there was nothing to cause alarm, for scarce a day passed that one of these animals was not heard howling in the vicinity of the cabin. "Can we not go faster.?" said the goodwife; ' it'll be dark afore I see Charity Crabtree. Dear me! Lord protect us!" and once more she gazed behind her. "Four, five, six!" counted Christian. "Seven, eight, nine! why, how many there are!" exclaimed Lydia. Here the Indian took another glance at the sun, then at Mother Garlic. Before they had advanced many paces further the number of wolves had greatly increased, until at length there could not have been less than a hundred, and all moving to- wards the river. "Lord have mercy on us!" ejaculated the good- wife, who, since she had discovered what attracted the attention of her companions, had begun pray- ing hard. "Hush! no noise," said Christian; " that makes 'em more hungry."  78       ROMANCE OF THE. "But I must pray!" she continued, clasping her 'hands; " and, Lydia dear, pray too!" In a few minutes the wolves had reached the op- }i ' posite bank and were beginning to cross, taking a direction which would bring them not far behind the travellers. "Why can't we go faster?" exclaimed the dame, trying to run. "Hush!" said Christian, at the same time mak- ing a sign to Lydia to urge on the horse. When the leader of the pack was half-way across, it raised its head, sniffed the air, and sent up a savage howl. At -once all the others followed its example,'and the noise was so appalling that the goodwifel stuffed her fingers in her ears. "Only three miles more," said the Pequot, hop- ing to 'revive her courage, "and we dan do that in an hour." "In less,"exclaimed Lydia, "'if nurse will only get up behind me." But the dame shook her head- it had been hard enough to ride on the pillion; bare back was out of the question, even in the pre- sent crisis. "We might think those were devils after us," the old lady cried. "A herd of swine was once possessed; why not these critters too?" And certainly the unearthly yells were enough to make one believe that fiends were in pursuit. The   jg. "CHARTER OAIK.           7 , ,  horse was now inclined to break into a trot, for he scented danger, and it was with difficulty that Lydia could restrain him. Before the next mile was accomplished the sun touched the--horison- which for a moment was visible through a narrow opening in the forest-and all three instinctively turned their eyes towards it. It was as if they were taking a last look at a friend about to leave them. Down, down, went the sun; presently it was gone, and then the shadows began to creep -round them apace..     . "The demons are getting closer," said the good- wife, wringing her hands---she was now too terri- fied to gaze behind her. About a minute after she had spoken, one of the wolves made its appearance on their right; it was partly concealed by a fallen pine, and the arrow that was fired at it, glanced over the tree and then plunged harmlessly into the SHow. "What had  we, best do?' inquired Lydia, who from her elevated position was able to dis- tinguish more approaching. The Pequot did not answer; his own courage was severely tried. At length he halted and told them they must climb a tree. "And be quick!" he added, drawing his tomahawk. Scarcely had he grasped the weapon, when the horse wheeled violently round, and in spite of the efforts of its    i    #80      ROMANCE OF THE brave young rider, dashed off into the forest. Lydia seized hold of the mane, and with her body bent as low as possible to avoid being torn front her seat by the branches, was in another mnoment racing for dear life, every wolf in the pack after her. Christian waited just long enough to see the old maid safe up a cedar, then heedless of his own safety he hastened in the direction which the wild beasts had taken. Their howling guided his steps, and although it was dark he made fair speed. But as the sound grew fainter and fainter, his heart sank within him, for he knew there was very little hope. Indeed, had he stopped to reflect, he would have seen how useless it was to try and overtake the pack; and if he did, wouldit not only be to find' the girl torn in pieces? At last, when he was about giving up the chase in despair, the report, of a gun echoed through the forest. This was quickly fol-, lowed by another, then there was a deep silence. "She is saved!" he cried, dashing on with in- creased speed. "It's a special Providence! She is saved!"After advancing a quarter of a mile further, he stopped and gave a loud call, which was immediately answered by some one not a   great distance off. Another hundred yards brought him to a  clearing among the pines, where it was com- paratively light, and there he saw a man kneeling   over a form which he felt certain was Lydia, while another stranger stood near, holding a couple of horses by the bridle. In a moment Christian was at the girl's side, and great was his joy to find that she was not only alive, but judging by the cheerful greeting she gave him, very little hurt. Lydia's delight at seeing him again can scarcely be de- scribed, and after expressing Bwonder at his own escape from death, she inquired after the goodwife. Then, when she heard he had pushed her up a tree, she could no longer restrain herself, and burst intio SUCeh a hearty laugh that even the stolid Pequot was unable to keep a grave countenance. Presently, turning to the stranger: "I pray you sir," she said, "do not mind my arm; 'tis only a scratch. My sleeve is badly torn, and that is the worst part of the accident,." "True, lady," he replied, "the wound is only skin deep. I fear more for your head, which, although I can find no cut upon it, must neverthe- less have received a great jar. Do you L;now you were flighty for several minutes after you were thrown from the horse?" "Indeed! well I trust I spoke no. nonsense; now let me rise, I think I'm able to stand." With his assistance she got upon her feet, then told Christian that they must lose no time in rejoining Mother Garlic.  82       ROMANCE OF THE "I'd give a trifle to know her name," said the man in charge of the horses, and who, from the silence he had thus far preserved, was- evidently a servant, "I'd give a trifle to know her name"- these words were spoken in a whisper to Christian. "I never knew a body so brave," lie continued, "and only that we discharged our pieces almost in the face of her steed, causing him to swerve, I do believe she'd have been on his back yet. Pray, who is she?" "Lydia Garlic," answered the youth gruffly. No sooner did the other stranger hear this than he started, then putting his mouth close to Lydia's ear  "You gave me another name," he whispered. "Did I?" exclaimed the girl with a shudder, then lowering her voice, "God forgive me! Yes my head- must have wandered, oh what have I done!" "Well, be careful how you repeat it," he con- tinued, still speaking in a whisper. "If any kin to the regicide, whom they were so many years trying to find, and who was once thought to be concealed in Hartford, keep well the secret, that is, if Goffe be still alive. Rest assured, however, that 'what escaped your lips in an unguarded moment, shall remain as deeply hidden in my breast as if you had never spoken it."    -; '!      CHARTER OAK.       83 For a little while Lydia was too overcome to utter a word. And well might she tremble ; already she had placed the safety of her parent in the keep- ing of one, about whom  she knew absolutely nothing. On which side might this stranger be? Perhaps he belonged to the King's party. 'While she was endeavoring to regain her self-possession, her rescuer turned to Christian and asked how far it was to Hartford. "We've had a long day's ride," he said, " and would like to reach the town as soon as possible." "Three or four miles," replied the Indian; "we too are going there." "Right glad am I to hear it," pursued the other; "then suppose we set off for the tree, up which it seems one of your party has taken refuge, and after that journey on in company. "Yes, and let us make haste," exclaimed Lydia, "or Aunt Garlic will die of fright." "But you surely cannot pretend to walk," said the stranger, addressing her, "we must make a litter, or place you on one of these steeds; mine, although spirited, is a very gentle animal."- "Thanks, sir; I have no broken bones, only a bruise here," replied Lydia, placing her hand on her forehead. "I would rather go afoot." "Then at least take my arm. To this she   84       ROMANCE OF THE agreed, and with Christian leading the way, they directed their course towards the river. -Lydia would fain have made -greater speed, but the gallant who had taken her under his charge, was so afraid lest she might be scratched by another branch, that they proceeded at what might be called a snail's pace. "If this were England," thought Lydia, "I might take him for one of those courtiers my father has so often told me about, who will do any- thing for a lady, even die for her. Certainly there is a fascination in such manners; and yet we'd get along twice as fast if he'd only let me walk by my- self." Soon they reached the cedar, on whose stoutest limb the goodwife had been perched almost an hour, stiff with cold, yet praying fervently. When she caught sight of them she slid down the tree with the agility of a squirrel, and in a moment was clasping Lydia in her arms, squeezing her so tightly that the girl was half choked. Leaving them to tell each other what had happened since they separated, Christian set about looking for the bag which he knew must have fallen off Jack be- fore he had taken many strides from the river bank. It was soon found. Then placing the saddle which he had been carrying, across one of the stranger's steeds, he bade Lydia and the goodwife follow him.    CHARTER OAK.       85 ( And I'm to go with you," said Lydia's escort, again offering her his arm. "Oh! yes, do!" exclaimed Prudence; "the wolves ain't so far off but what they may come back.- I hope your gun is loaded? Go in front with Christian." To this, however, he demurred, and much to her chagrin walked on beside the girl. The nurse's ears were wide open, wider, per- haps, for its being night, which hindered her from seeing clearly what manner of man he was; and no sooner did she catch the few soft ;words which he spoke to Lydia than she placed herself on the other side of her charge, to the no small risk of her neck, for she was nearest the river and the path was hardly broad enough for three to walk abreast. They, proceeded thus a short distance in silence, and the dame was beginning to think he was, after all, only some honest fellow out on a hunting tour, and whose conversation, if he had any, would not be disedifying, when she was suddenly roused by Christian waving his hand, and crying, "There's Hartford!" Sure enough, straight ahead, a mile or so away, was a light-in a few minutes the forest came to an end, and they could distinguish many other lights which told them the town was not far off. "And there's the moon," said the stranger, gent- ly pressing Lydia's arm, " welcome, moon l"    xi    86       ROMANCE OF T'HE It was just at its full, and as it rose above the hills east of the Connecticut, every object around became almost as distinct as if it had been day. A temptation now seized Lydia which she could not resist, and looking up, she stole a glance at her unknown companion. As she did so, their eyes met. There was on his face an expression of won- der and delight. During their progress in the dark, he had pictured her to :himself as- a plain country maid, with nothing about her to indicate that she was above the class who devote their lives to making butter and cheese. But here was a very different being from what he had imagined, one who might indeed be the daughter of Goffe the regi- cide, who belonged to a good family in England. Never had he beheld a countenance so full of sweet- ness as the one now turned towards him; at the same time, there was something in it more than beauty--there was character, greatness of soul. Her manner, perhaps, lacked diffidence-she did not hang her head, nor appear confused as he stared at her. But after all this might spring from a guileless spirit. No, had she been bashful he would not have liked her half as well. "Child!" exclaimed the goodwife, seizing her wrist and examining the cut on her arm, " how did this happen? Why didn't you tell me about it; are you much hurt?"    X^. CHARTER OAK.             87 "Oh, no," replied Lydia, trying to free herself from her nurse's grasp; "it's only a scratch." As she spoke her eyes were still fastened on the stran- ger, who had filled her with a most agreeable sur- prise. He was no common hunter of wolves, like Adams, but a tall, broad-shouldered man of per- haps two and twenty, with a profusion of dark hair, quite unlike the stiff, short-cropped locks of the former. His upper lip was hidden by a mus- tache, while the rest of his face was smooth-shaven, which increased his youthful appearance, and hehad one of those open, genial countenances that disarm suspicion, and make friends everywhere; at the same time he looked as if he had a strong will, and a quick temper. While she was studying him she felt reassured that the important secret, which had so unwittingly escaped her, was safe in his keeping. "Who can he be?" she thought, turning impa- tiently towards the good wife, who still held her by the wrist. The dame appeared troubled. "God grant," she was muttering, "' nothing the dear child has heard me tell of my early frolics has harmed her soul. Her trials have already be- gun; Satan doth often come in the guise of a hand- some youth." Presently the goodwife fixed her eyes on Lydia's escort with a searching look. "Whoever he is,"  8, 8      ROMANCE OF THE she continued, "one thing I'm sure of, he's not much given to exhortation-nor is he innocent of the world. Ah! Lydia, Lydia, beware!" In the meanwhile they were rapidly approaching the settlement, and in half an hour reached the first house. Here the stranger halted, at the same time- Lydia withdrew her arm from his. "Fair lady," he said, doffing his hat, " there are in the course of. our lives days which we never for- get; for me this will be one of those days." Then, before she could prevent it, he had seized her hand and was pressing it to his lips. Prudence was too thunderstruck to utter a word; Lydia, however, retained her presence of mind ad- mirably, and instead of screaming or running away, as her nurse fully expected, she let him hold her hand as long as- he pleased, and there was even a roguish smile on her face. "What honey is to the Bee This is to me," he exclaimed, releasing her, and at the same time making a low obeisance. "Alas! that we must separate; but all things have an end. Fair lady, adieu!" "And our saddle," said Christian, "do not carry that off." The stranger laughed, and declared he had quite forgotten it was upon his horse. "If you wish,"' said he, "I'll' leave it at the   CHARTER OAK.        89 house where you're going to, if you'll tell me which that, is." The Indian, however, preferred taking the sad- dle himself, for he knew they could not be far from Charity Crabtree's. Accordingly, the servant gave it to him, then obeying a signal from his master, followed the latter rapidly down the single street, which at that time constituted the town of Hartford. "Let us also make haste," said Christian; we've been long enough going thirty miles." "Yes, nurse, don't stand gazing at the moon," added Lydia, gently pulling the dame's frock. "What has disturbed you?" "Our bodies," replied the goodwife, allowing herself to be drawn along, "have been sorely tried to-day, but our souls have been tried more severely still; I am convinced the forest we have passed through is the haunt of demons." "Well, I have often heard unaccountable noises when I was out gathering wild flowers, or search- ing for bird's nests, and think what you say not improbable; but since leaving home, I'm sure we've met no devils." At this the dame turned towards-Lydia with a mournful shake of the head, but did not reply. After going a few steps further the girl requested Christian to let her have her cloak out of the bag'   "Il i  90       ROMANCE OF THE i I "Aye," said Prudence, " the night air is keen- wonder I didn't make you put it on as soon as I noticed your bare arm. That scratch may grow dangerous if frost gets into it. Alas! 'twas not your flesh so much as your spirit I was worried about." The lad at once untied the bag and handed her a scarlet cloak, one of the many presents which Adams had made her. "This is very becoming to you," pursued the goodwife; " but, child, beware, of vanity. Let not strangers make your acquaintance too easily. A kiss is often the first step to damnation." Then, after a pause: "Child," she continued, "do not forget your assumed name. As you remarked yourself, a short time ago, when we first discussed the matter, and when I admit I had scruples about it,- your parent's life depends on your keeping secret who you really are. These are troublous days; the spies of the King may not have given up all hope of finding him ; and should any shrewd, ill disposed person discover you were the regicide's daughter, thati slight clue might be enough, and 'twould not be long' before he would be dragged from his hiding-place." Lydia shuddered. "God knows," she said to herself, "what may happen! God knows! But no; he did not look as if he could betray me."   Presently the Indian asked if a certain house standing a little back -from the street on their left, was not Miss Crabtree's. "Yes," replied the dame, "my friend says in her letter that there's half an acre 'tween it and the road, and that there's a tall tree close by, so that must be it." The dwelling towards which they now directed their steps was two stories high, with a garret, the second story projecting about a foot beyond the lower; while it had five dormer windows, and a peaked roof, which sloped down in the rear until it almost touched the ground. Along the south side of the house ran an immense stone chimney, which at this moment was belching forth into the clear night air a dense volume of smoke, while on the north side, and so close that it almost touched the building, stood a walnut tree, its topmost limbs stretching far over the roof. "What a 'snug home this must be," thought Lydia, as they stopped in front of the door. Chris- tian's knock did not have to be repeated; in a mo- ment it opened, End a tall, gaunt female, her head crowned by a gigantic top-knot, and with a nose and chin projecting so far towards each other that they nearly met, appeared on the threshold. Pru- dence did not immediately recognize her friend;   :1j    92      ROMANCE OF THE but this was not strange, when we remember how many years had passed since they had separated. "Be you Charity Crabtree?" she inquired, speak- ing slowly and with a tone of sadness. "I be, and who on earth are you? but afore you answer come inside, it's a sharp night and you're shivering." The travellers obeyed, and presently found them- selves in a kind of passage way leading into the main room. The Pequot now threw down his load and gave a sigh of relief, while Miss Crabtree brought the lamp she was holding, so close to the good wife's face that she almost scorched her -eye- lashes, then began narrowly scrutinizing her. "As I live," she exclaimed, " as I live, if you ain't my schoolmate, Prudence Garlic!--he companion of all my youthful frolics; but how you have changed!" Here her voice faltered, and the eyes of both filled with tears. ' Aye!" she continued, "I ought to have been on the look-out for you; when Mad Adams says he'll do a thing, he keeps his word. No doubt he guided you here." Then without ask- ing another question she set her light on the floor, and gave her friend such a hearty embrace that the latter was convinced she loved her as much as ever. After this demonstration, Miss Crabtree opened a second door, and conducted them into the principal apartment of the house, which occupied almost the   93   CHARTER OAK.   whole of the first story, and for comfort surpassed anything Lydia had ever dreamt of. Here she made them sit down on a bench close to a roaring fire, the back log of which was full six feet long, and whose glow lit up even the spider's web in the furthest corner, and rendered superfluous either lamp or candle. Having warmed her hands a mo- ment, Prudence entered into conversation with' her friend, who, like herself, had never married; but they spoke in undertones, so that neither the Pe- quot nor Lydia could distinctly make out what they said. At length, after Miss Crabtree had given her whole history as well as she could recollect it for the past twenty years, she stopped and waited for the goodwife to begin hers. But the latter shook her head. "No," she whispered, "Do not ask me for mine; it -must remain a secret; but upon my honor it shall be the only one I will ever keep from you." Charity looked surprised, then with a frown said, "It's real unkind, after I've told you everything about myself; I hate mysteries. Pray who is this girl you have brought with you." "My niece Lydia, smart and God-fearing, and the longer you know her the better you'll like her; isn't she handsome!" Miss Crabtree shrugged her shoulders and re4 mained a minute or two with her eyes fastened on    , i i   9  4 i     94       ROMANCE OF THE the girl. Gradually the frown passed from her face, and she said to herself: "Just what my nephew ought to have to make him happy." Then again addressing Prudence, "And you say she's smart?" "Ha! she knows a deal more than I do. Her father has taught her everything, and she can con- verse about countries that lie ever so far on t'other side of the world. She has, I confess, an odd notion that afore long these Colonies will free themselves from England and become a great, independent Republic- and on this she and her father disagree. But you musn't mind her; 'twas Adams, no doubt, put it into her head." "Gcood, good!" said  Charity, rubbing her shrivelled hands; "your niece and my nephew Joe are of one mind. I do wish he were here; can't think what keeps him out so late. True, there's been a town-meeting, but that's over these four hours. ( I hope he will like my niece," whispered Mother Garlic. "But her tresses must be first cut off," pursued Charity, raising her voice; "they're very pretty, but they're not approved by the church. More- over, Increase Mather is expected afore a great while, and I want him to form a goodopinion of the girl, a thing he'd certainly not do if she wore   Iii       CHARTER  OAK.       95 ringlets. And bless-me, if she hasn't got short sleeves! Worse and worse!"While she was speak- ing, the regicide's daughter had withdrawn her wounded arm a moment from beneath the cloak and was examining it. "Pardon, said the goodwife, " 'twas an accident tore that sleeve off. I haven't told you yet what happened on our journey hither." "No, do tell! First, however, let me look at the girl's arm ; there's blood upon it." But Lydia, who had overheard the last few words, drew her cloak over it again with an offended air. "Peevish after her tiresome ride," said Miss Crabtree;" supper will be ready presently, and that will put her in a better humor. Do begin now, and tell your adventure." Accordingly, Prudence cleared her throat and narrated how they had been attacked by wolves -how she herself had been obliged to climb a tree for safety, while her niece's horse, terrified by the savage beasts, had dashed off into the forest, carry- ing the girl with him, She likewise gave full credit to the Pequot for having so bravely rushed after Lydia. Finally, she told how her niece had been rescued by a couple of strangers just as the pack were closing round her; then dropping her voice, she proceeded to relate how the girl had per- mitted one of her deliverers-a handsome young     96       ROMANCE OF THE man-to entwine her arm in his, andhowthey had thus walked on together as far as the entrance to the town, "where," continued the goodwife, "he made so free as actually to kiss her hand." At this revelation Miss Crabtree's brow contracted.  "'Twas a bold, presuming act," continued the speaker. "Verily it was," exclaimed her friend. Al- though I did not always think so, I believe now a kiss is often the devil's entering wedge."  "Well, Charity dear, I am happy to say she's  well grounded in religion, and this first attack of  Satan may prove harmless. We were both em- braced more than once at her age. How rosy cheeks do draw the men folks' lips!" "True, and yet we still kept on the way of righteousness, didn't we? Let us hope 'twill be so in her case." While they were thus conversing, Lydia amused herself examining the room, in which she found a great deal to interest her. What she most admired was its size, which appeared ample enough to con- tain the whole of her own little cabin. The win- dows were at least three feet high by two wide, and opened with hinges, while the glass was set in lead lines and diamond-shaped. Then, there was the spacious chimney with its enormous back log, which had been worked into its place with   CHARTER OAK.         97 handspikes. In fact, so deep was the fireplace that a couple of benches were fastened to the jambs, and behind the log there was space enough for pussy to lie without danger of scorching. In each corner of the chimney hung a flitch of bacon; while along the joists overhead were strings of dried apples, pumpkins, bunches of catnip and the largest ears of corni which were being kept for next season's planting. Pasted on the wall above the fireplace, so that while you warmed yourself you could not help noticing it, was a broad sheet of paper, dingy and fly-blown, yet in a tolerable state of preservation, considering the length of time it had been there, on which were written King Charles' twelve good rules: PROFANE NO DIVINE ORDINANCE, ToucH NO STATE MATTERS. URGE NO TERATTHS. PICK NO QUARRELS. ENCOURAGE NO VICE. iEPEAT NO GRIEVANCES. REVEAL NO SECRETS. MAINTAIN NO ILL OPINION. MAKE NO COMPARISONS. KEEP NO BAD COMPANY. MAKE NO LONG MERATS. "AY NO WAGERS." Just as Lydia had finished reading them the servant announced that supper was ready, and her-appe- tite being keen, she did not lose a moment taking  her place at the table. This piece of furniture, by   98       ROMANCE OF THE the way, was the oddest thing in the whole house. It served a double purpose. When the girl had first entered, she had beheld it in the form of a large, round-backed chair; but now the back, which mov- ed on hinges, was turned over and the chair altered 1i into a table.                 X "Begin, child," said Mother Garlic, placing a whole griddle of Indian cakes upon her plate; " be-  gin, you've fasted and suffered much to-day, and i need refreshment." Lydia threw off her cloak, and after saying a short grace, began the meal, while Miss Crabtree stood behind her a moment, gazing at-her bare 1arm, then turning to her friend:        "You're right," she whispered, "I can tell by its  whiteness that she's been used to wearing long sleeves." During the next quarter of an hour, griddle after griddle passed from the hearth to the table, and i two pitchers of milk, half a jar of grape sweet- meats, a cold pumpkin pie, and a loaf of bread dis- appeared, before their appetites were appeased. a They then resumed their places on the bench in front of the fire, and Charity again expressed her wonder that her nephew (whose name, by the way, was Joseph Wadsworth,) did not come home., "He never stays long at the tavern," she said; "I can't think what keeps him out so late. I know   CHARTER OAK.       99 you'll like him," here she turned to Prudence, "he's so God-fearing, so kind to me, his poor, old aunt. I've been keeping house for him now seven years, and during all that time not- a cross word hlas passed between us." "And you say he holds the same opinion as my niece, in regard to the future of the colonies?" re- marked Goody Garlic, anxious that Lydia should be favorably disposed towards the man -under whose roof she was going to sojourn. "Yes, 'tis on his mind day and night, in fact -" here she brought her mouth close to her friend's ear-" 'tis doing him harm; he's not as cheerful and fond of society as I could wish." Lydia who was now in better mood than before supper, drew close to Miss Crabtree and began listening attentively to every word which dropped from her lips. "Kind and God-fearing," she said, repeating to herself the old aunt's words, "and a patriot!" At this moment a gust of wind made the outer doorshake, and as the girl heard it her heart throbbed, for she fancied it might be the nephew entering. She longed to lay eyes on him, especially since she had learnt that his faith in the future of their native land was the same as her own. She hoped too that he might prove to be the captivating stranger whom she had met in the forest; and yet   100      ROMANCE OF THE this was scarcely probable, as the latter had asked Christian how far it was to Hartford, and an in- habitant of the town would hardly have been so ig- norant of his whereabouts. Another hour passed, still Wadsworth did not arrive, and Prudence and Charity continued their conversation in a voice al- ways loud enough for the girl to hear, and she was able to learn a great deal concerning the master of  i         i the house. At length, out of one of the corners of  the room came the sound of a person snoring, and  turning round, Lydia saw the Pequot curled up on 1 the floor like a hedge hog, fast asleep. Goody Garlic also gazed over her shoulder and smiled,  then gave a yawn. "Aye," exclaimed Miss Crabtree, "I shouldn't have kept you up so late, 'tis ten o'clock and past." Then looking to see what had become of the ser- k vant maid, she spied that hard-working creature  ensconsed in the quaint piece of furniture, which  had once more assumed its chair form. Like Christian the drudge was sound asleep. But one  good pinch on her fat arm made her open her eyes and cry "Oh!" then emphasizing her words with a stamp of the foot, and a second pinch, Miss Crabtree bade her rise and show the Indian the way to the garret. Not many minutes after, Pru- dence and Lydia were following Miss Crabtree up the staircase, the latter accompanied by an enor   CHARTER OAK.       101  mous cat, which had abandoned its snug quarters behind the back log, rather than let its mistress go out of sight for ever so short a time. "I myself," remarked Charity, "shall presently go below again and await my nephew; no rest for me until he comes. I'll keep a good fire burn- ing, and as the chimney passes through your room the heat from it will take the edge off the frost." On reaching the second story they turned to the left and entered a spacious chamber, into which the moonbeams were streaming. Part of the fur- niture consisted of an oaken chest, which their hostess informed them had been brought over from England by the first of the Wadsworth family who had emigrated. "And I once heard my brother-in-law say," she added, " that his father told him it was a century old then." Close by the chest was a chair whose sides and back were full three inches thick, and which looked as if it was intended to last forever. "I never like to sit in that chair," continued Miss Crabtree; "but perhaps I'm foolish." "Why, is it broken or what?" asked Prudence. "Broken! not in the least; you couldn't crack it if you let it drop from the top of the house. But you must know, so many have died in it. There's my nephew's father, and his grandfather,   102      R 'OMANCE OF THE and although- I never heard tel1l, yet I, wouldn't wonder if his great-grandfather had breathed his last in it too. It runs in the family to go off  unexpected, and they were looking as strong as you or I a minute afore."'           i  When Lydiac heard this she felt inclined to ask the old maid to hush, and not talk of such awful ' things at that hour, but Charity's stern expression a made her hesitate, and so she said nothing. - Next to the wall, and with the chimney running between, were a couple of feather beds, with a rusty horse shoe dangling at the head of each. "Those," pursued Charity, lowering hbar voice to a whisper, " are meant to keep off witches, so let s 'emr be."  The old maid next called their attention to, a  row of pegs along the whitewashed wall, on which they might hang their gowns, and also showed them ' a Bible lying on a table in the middle of the room. Then before bidding them good night, she went , out a moment and returned, carrying a pair of   shoes with very peaked toes, which was the fashion at that period, and had been ever since Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Anjou, had worn them thus in order- to conceal an excrescence on one of his feet. "You mustn't use moccasins any more," she said, addressing Lydia; "to-morrow, put these   CHARTER OAK.       1 Oj on-they may be a mite too big, but I guess you'll manage to keep 'em from slipping off." The girl frowned an instant, but wisely con- cluding that she had better not quarrel with the old maid for such a trifle, promised to do as she was bid. Miss Crabtree now wished them both pleasant dreams, and closing the door withdrew to the apartment below, where let us leave her seated in front of the fire, listening to -the wind howling and beating against the windows as if it were try- ing to force a way in. The noise of the blast, how- ever, did not shake her nerves; she was only anxious about Wadsworth, and with a jug of cider, and a plate of walnuts at her elbow, she whiled away the hours pleasantly enough, wondering what on earth could keep her nephew out so late. It was nearly midnight, and he had never done this before. CHAPTER   IV. NEXT morning, Lydia was awakened by the ring- ing of a bell in the street. The sound seemed to pass the house twice; and between the first and the second time, she heard Miss Crabtree's foot- steps descending the staircase. Goody Garlic, however, continued to snore; and as the dim light   104      ROMANCE OF THE which crept in through the dormer window showed that day was only just breaking, Lydia did not wake her, and having no household duties to per- form, determined to remain a while longer herself in her comfortable bed. Presently her thoughts flew to her home in the forest, and she prayed God to keep her father safe during her absence. Fond I as she was of poor Jack, she almost wished he might not have succeeded in escaping from the  wolves, for if the old gentlemanwereto see the nag . arrive alone and without a saddle, it would give him a shock from which he might never recover. Soon,  a loud roaring in the chimney warned her that the fire was lit, and after listening to it a few minutes  she got up, unable to bear the idea of others being at work, and herself doing nothing. While she was putting on her gown, Prudence opened her eyes, and with a yawn, exclaimed:  "We're guests, child, and can take things easy;  pray lie still until you're called." This remonstrance proved of no avail; Lydia  was too thoroughly aroused to think of getting into  bed again, and the chilly atmosphere of the room only hastened her movements. When she ap- peared below, her, hostess greeted her with a warmth which almost took the breath away from the servant maid, who had always associated her mistress with frowns and pinches, and the drudge   CHARTER OAK.       105 could scarcely believe her eyes. The smile of Charity Crabtree was a thing not soon to be for- gotten. .With Lydia's right hand grasped in both of hers, the dame's nose and chin for a moment parted company-the broad mouth opened wider and wider, until you saw nothing but a set of jagged teeth while her top-knot moved backwards and forwards, as if it were trying to stay, "How d'ye do." What especially pleased the old maid, was to find the girl in long sleeves, for Lydia had put on another dress, and accordingly she dismissed to a future occasion, the lecture which she had intended giving, on the sinfulness of wearing curls. Perhaps, if Cha- rity's heart could have been laid bare to mortal eye, it would have been discoverec, that her horror of long hair was pretty evenly balanced, in Lydia's case, by a desire that her. nephew should see his young guest before she was deprived of these orna- ments. "Yes," she said to herself, "they may be sinful, yet they do increase her charms. If she's only half what Prudence makes her out to be, Joe must marry her; she's exactly what he needs to make him happy." Then patting the girl's shoulder, she inquired if she had passed a pleasant night, adding that it had been the coldest of the season, and that five of her chickens had frozen to death on the' roost.   106-      ROMANCE OF THE "Oh, how could I have been otherwise than comfortable," returned Lydia, " buried so deep in feathers. I doubt if I'd have opened my eyes near as soon as I did, if a bell in the street hadn't roused me'" "Humph! I'm. sorry you were disturbed, -Miss;  and yet I think you'll agree, that the law which was passed at town meeting, some years ago, and whichl ordaineth that every morning, about daybreak, the watch shall ring a bell all the way from Wyllys' Hill to the other end of the town, was a good one." Lydia smiled, then asked how many obeyed the law. "How many? well, a quarter of an hour after you hear it,' there's not a dwelling in Hartford but what has a light burning. If not, then one shilling and sixpence forfeit to him who finds out the lazy body, and sixpence to the town.' Lydia having now sufficiently warmed her hands at the fire, offered to assist in the household duties. But Miss Crabtree, while gratified by such evidence of an industrious spirit, shook her head and bade her go sit on one of the benches in the chimney, adding that her visit was to be a complete holiday. Accordingly Lydia withdrew to the cozy nook, to- wards which the dame's finger was pointing, and resting her feet on the end of the back log, peered into the isooty cavern over her head. Presently   CHARTER OAK.       107 she uttered an exclamation of wonder. Deep in the chimney appeared a bright object, which at first, she thought was a spark; but it did not move, what could it be? "A chimn ey like this," thought Lydia, "is the very place for a witch to hide in; might not that ' be her eye winking at me?' "My nephew," said Charity, just as a puff of smoke hid the bright object from view, " is exceed- ingly fond of sitting where you are; and often he'll not open his lips the whole evening, but keep gaz- ing at the stars, then at the burning coals, thinking dear knows of what-a strange, strange man! yet he's more than good, he's perfection itself." Lydia laughed a moment at her folly in having mistaken a star for a witch's eye, then asked at what hour Mr. Wadsworth had come home. "Past midnight, Miss Garlic, that's why he's late this morning; Joe is usually down afore me. In fact, he's the only man I ever knew that was willing to help along, and not leave every thing to the women folks." Lydia smiled; this remark put her-in mind of what Prudence had said, the morning when Adams had been so tardy making his appearance. "But besides being an early riser, and a most kind-hearted fellow, he's a genius. He can, when he devotes himself to his farm, plough   108      ROMANCE OF THE more land in a day than ally other man in Hart. ford; he can shoe a horse; drill the lads into soldiers; and he can exhort. But, whlat's bet- ter yet, at a pinch he can bake bread." These last words were spoken with intense energy. "Then, too, he's a scholar. Why, Miss, you ain't seen half this house yet. There's a room in it, where there's nothing but books; and to tell the truth, that's the only place I'm not allowed to penetrate. I did get in once, however, a few weeks ago, and succeeded in dusting and putting things almost to rights, when Joe arrived with his -friend i Adams, and caught me. 'Twas the only time I ever saw my nephew vexed. He said nothing, however, except that it would take him a month to find his H pens and sealing wax. But when I opened a   p drawer, and showed 'em to him all nicely stowed ! away in a pasteboard box, he had to laugh. Isn't  it queer how men hate tidiness! Even my Joe,'  A with all his good qualities, would stay a hundred s years in that room, without having it swept and put in order." While she was talking, Miss Crabtree's eyes were fixed on an Indian cake, placed amongst the embers, and which seemed to be almost baked. Suddenly she smoothed her apron down, and whis- pered; "He's coming." At that moment Lydia heard footsteps on the staircase, and leaving her    ,                 .   CHARTER OA K.       109 seat, hastened to place herself beside the old maid. The master of the house descended briskly, rub- bing his hands as if he felt the keen air of the up- per story, and when he reached the bottom of the steps, was about advancing towards the fireplace, when he caught sight of the girl, and halted. He was of medium height, perhaps twenty-eiglt or thirty years of age, with broad shoulders, and a thin, care-worn face, which now, as Lydia surveyed him, bore a look of astonishment not unmingled with displeasure. His heavy eyebrows lowered over eyes full of dark fire, which seemed yet dark- er from the uncommon depth at which they were set in -is head. His features were harsh. But while the girl's eyes were fastened on him they changed, and became softened by a look of melan- choly. He wore a moustache and a pointed beard, and except for his hair, which was trimmed evenly in front, after the fashion of the Puritans, and covered more than half his forehead like a skull cap, while behind it fell in thick clusters, he might have been considered handsome. To give it this shape a cap, and sometimes- a large bowl was used, and every lock which in front fell below the rim, was clipped off by the scissors. "A very different person from the lively stranger who saved me from the wolves," t hought Lydia, as she steadily returned Wadsworth's gaze. Never-   "O      ROMANCE OF THE  theless she recognized in him no ordinary mortal, one whose spirit would be content to follow along the beaten ways of life. Pride-ambition-rest- lessness, daring; all these were stamped upon his countenance. Close at his heels followed a dog with shaggy, yellow hair, and which belonged to the Shepherd's breed. The creature stopped an instant when its master did, then wagging its tail rushed forward and buried its head in the folds of Lydia's dress. The girl smiled, and stroked its back, which act of kindness seemed to drive the dog wild with delight, and jumping upon its hind legs it placed its paws against her breast, then gave a succession of sharp, joyous barks. Miss Crab-  tree looked on, evidently not at all pleased, and pre- sently seizing the brute by the ear, she pulled it  down, then introduced Lydia to her nephew, tell- ing him that the girl was the niece of her friend, Prudence Garlic, who, with his consent had been invited to pass a shoA while with them. Lydia immediately offered her hand, and there was some- 8 thing so simple and frank in her manner, that Wad worth's sternness for a moment relaxed, and stretching out his own, he gave hers a cordial i shake, to the great delight of his aunt, who could scarcely believe her senses. At the same time -he asked if she were fond of dogs. L"Very, sir," responded Lydia." ,{              , /    I CHARTER OAK.     Ill ,'Well, Miss, they're wonderful company. Miles Standish is called my shadow; wherever I go he goes." Here his aunt's top-knot gave a sudden jerk, and her brows knit, for be it known the dog and she were not on the best of terms. When her back was turned, Miles had too often stolen choice morsels from the table, and had no respect for her cat. But especially did she dislike him, from a rooted conviction, that her nephew would never take to himself a wife, so long as this shadow kept him company. "A comely maiden lawfully joined in wedlock," she muttered, turning away, " would be far better to have with you than a dumb brute." Wadsworth now advanced the strange opinion that Miles had a soul. "O fie!" said Charity, again facing him, "don't talk in such a way afore your guests." "Well, how do you know the dog has not?" said Lydia ; " many things are true, which books do not teach." No sooner had she uttered these words, than Wadsworth's countenance brightened; you might have thought he had made some great discovery. Here was indeed a young woman different from any he had ever met before, one who did not fol- low in the beaten track, and whom he might-yes,   "2      ROMANCE OF THE whom he might get to love and-. But no, that never could be; there was an obstacle in his way, j which although created by himself, he was power- less:to remove, without incurring the wrath of the Almighty; and the feeling with which, -at this moment, he viewed Lydia, was only a' passing weakness. Presently his strong will came to the rescue, and the harsh look again clouded his visage. But Charity was satisfied with the pro- gress already made; better slow than not at all, and slapping him on the back; "That's right, Joe," g she exclaimed, " be your old self again."    : Presently Goody Garlic made her appearance, and although Wadsworth gave her a rather dis-  tant welcome, he assured her that as a friend of his aunt, nothing would be left undone to make I her visit to Hartford as pleasant as possible. The servant now placed a griddle of cakes upo4 the table, and Miles Standish's nose was immedi- ately pointed towards them; while so eager was his gaze that Lydia took one of them in her  i fingers, and holding it high in the air made the dog jump and catch it. Wadsworth smiled, but Charity bit her lip and clutched her apron, as if. she were going to tear it off-it seemed too bad this new comer should make so free, and take such a liking for the hateful beast. Her dis- pleasure was about breaking forth in words, when   CHARTER OAK.    .   113 Wadsworth taking the Bible from a shelf, tapped it with his knuckle and gave the signal for prayers. At once she folded her armsiand bowed her head; the others followed her example, and for the next five minutes nothing was heard but her nephew's deep and solemn voice. At the end of that time, Miles grew impatient; one mouthful had only whetted his appetite, and he began thumping his tail on the floor and whining. Lydia could not resist this appeal; so slyly taking another cake from the platter, she let it drop between his jaws, which came together with'a sound very like the click of a steel-trap. Miss Crabtree shud- dered; what would her nephew think of such con- duct? Could he pass it over unnoticed? Impos- sible! Fancy then her astonishment, when pres- sently he closed the book, and took his seat at the table as quietly as if nothing had happened. "Alas!" she sighed, " the girl has odd ways. It may be the devil has got into her; if so, he must be got out, or she'll never do for Joe's wife. But Joe! what has come over him, that he is so lenient?" Prudence was hardly less astonished than her friend, at the girl's behavior. At home Lydia had always conducted herself properly, and the dame could only account for this sudden change, by sup- posing that she had not yet recovered from the   "4      ROMANCE OF THE         C excitement of the perilous journey down the river. During the meal which followed, Miss Crabtree kept her eyes pretty busy, watching first Lydia, then her nephew, who did not eat quite so much I as usual. He seemed anxious that his young guest should taste of everything; and his attentions resulted in forming about her plate a semi-circle of cakes, maple syrup, honey, sweetmeats, etc. "Curls are wonderful things for touching a man's heart," thought the aunt. "Perhaps I was wrong to judge hastily; she may after all be a God-fearing maiden." Whether or no she was right in supposing that S her nephew was growing bewitched by Lydia's   i tresses, certain it is that his own locks did not in- spire the girl with any corresponding admiration. X Mad Adams had always worn his in the same homely style; but then he was born an ugly fellow,  whereas Wadsworth was a man of naturally fine presence, whom the stern spirit of the age seemed bent on deforming. The meal was nearly finished before Miss Crabtree spoke. "Joe," she said, "when you came home last  ! night, I was so drowsy I forgot to ask what had kept you out so late. Any thing gone wrong with the train-band to require your presence, or were you visiting some neighbors?" "No, aunt," he replied, "there are never any   CHARTER OAK.       115 brawls among my soldiers; and as for visiting, you know I'm not given to that." Here the good- woman shook her head and sighed. "But if you wish I'll tell what detained me. About eight o'clock I dropped in at the ' Bunch of Grapes,' to learn whether our friend Adams had got back yet from his mysterious expedition. 1 call it myste- rious, for nobody but myself and you know his errand, and even I am ignorant of the direction he took.; Well, as we were conversing about him, two strangers entered; one, who was much younger than the other, wore the King's uniform concealed under a deer-skin coat, and had a very command- ing air. His companion, an ill-looking fellow, I judged to be his servant. After whispering a word to the person who keeps the Ordinary during Simon's absence, the younger of the two left,with- out, to my surprise, so much as taking a glass of wine, although he looked cold. After he had gone, several of the town folks began to nod and wink at each other, and presently the stranger who re- mained, was invited to try some of the old rum for which our tavern is famous. At first he refused, but being pressed, consented that the company should drink his health. Well, you know, aunt, the first step is always the difficult one; after that, all comes easy enough. No sooner had he emptied his goblet than he invited us to drink with him;   "6      ROMANCE OF THE          we accepted, and in a few minutes the tongue of the unknown was loosed, and he began talking of things which he had better have kept secret. We discovered that he had only left Boston a few ldays ago, where, he said, Sir Edmund Andros was ruling with a high hand. At this, one of the compaty declared the new Governor would live to rue it; whereat the stranger grew profane, and said he hoped the King would look after Connecticut ere long. This remark led to a sharp retort from one of my train-band, and a brawl seemed imminent. but I stepped between, and- put a stop to the ldiffi- culty. You see my object was to let the fellow tall on and give us as much information as possible, for we have had no news from Boston since last month. Believing that I was on his side, the stranger finished his drink, then went on telling us that our Charter would soon be taken away, and closed by expressing a hope that the regicide G-offe would yet be found and brought to the gallows." At these words Lydia turned deadly pale, but the old maids did not notice her; they were loolik- ing at Wadsworth. "I now asked him," pursued -the speaker, " what had brought him to Hartford, but he would not answer, nor could he be induced to reveal anything further regarding himself; and I came away, con-   CHARTER OAK.       117 vinced that some evil was brewing. 'Tis time for us to be on the alert." "May the Lord' spare poor Connecticut!" ex- claimed Charity. "Amen," responded Goody Garlic. " Well, for my part," continued Wadsworth, " I hope she may feel the heel of the oppressor. The people will then open their eyes and see their destiny !" These words struck Lydia as being almost the same which Adams had used when he had first an- nounced the arrival of Andros, and she felt con- vinced that it was her host who had moulded his opinions and infused into him so much patriotism. Her heart throbbed, too, to think of what she might witness if she remained long enough in Hartford; at the same time she could not rid her- self of a vague sense of dread -the stranger who had kissed her hand, was no doubt the same who had entered the tavern for a moment while Wads- worth was there. Could she trust him ? "His face haunts me,' she said to herself; " I almost wish we had not smet. But he will not di- vulge my secret; oh no, he will not !" Just then the door flew open, and all out of breath, as if he had been running hard, appeared Simon Adams.  No sooner did he behold Lydia and the goodwife, than he threw up his hands and  "8      ROMANCE OF THE stood as if rooted to the threshold, without uttering  a syllable. Presently recovering his breath, and s! advancing towards them: "The Lord be praised!" he exclaimed; "the Lord be praised!" Wadsworth, who had not yet heard of his guests'  adventure with the wolves, was of course puzzled  by such conduct, and ordered him to explain him- self. The honest fellow nodded, and having shaken  hands with Prudence and the girl, went on to re- late how,' towards the middle of the past night, old Jack had returned home without his saddle and  looking as if some witch had been riding him. "I wouldn't have told your father a word about it," he said, addressing Lydia; "but the horse neighed so loud that the old gentleman awoke, and  by the light of the moon saw the animal pawing at the stable door. Oh dear! but it almost killed him; and I felt awful bad, too, for I guessed something dreadful had happened. Well, at once I put the nag in the stable, then taking my rifle, and plenty of powder and bullets, started off on your trail. I hardly thought Indians had attacked you, for they've been quite peaceable of late. I guessed it was wolves." "Right," interrupted the goodwife, "and only a merciful Providence saved us." "Well, I've been running and hallooing the   CHARTER OAK.       119 whole thirty miles down the river, and if ever there was a tired man, I'm one. But the Lord be thank- ed, you're both safe and sound, and under the best roof in Connecticut." "You did, indeed, have an adventure," said Wadsworth; "if the savages had carried you off, Adams would have pursued them until he dropped dead. He's the truest of friends. But, pray Miss," turning towards Lydia, "give me some account of what happened to you and your aunt." Here Charity nudged her friend with her elbow. "There's not much to relate, sir," responded Lydia, slightly blushing; "we were attacked by wolves, as Simon supposed, and while aunt climbed a tree for safety, I was carried off by my horse, and would have been overtaken and devoured by the wild beasts, had not two strangers suddenly ap- peared and discharged their guns at the pack, tLus saving my life. But the flash and the noise causeo Jack to swerve, and I fell to the ground, without, however, sustaining any great injury. These stran- gers afterwards accompanied us as-far as the town." "Indeed! Well, mayhap, these were the same I saw at the 'Bunch of Grapes;' in which case I forgive that impudent varlet much that he said about New England." Here Wadsworth rose and lit his pipe, while Adams took the seat which he had left, and begant devouring the remains of the   120  :    ROMANCE OF THE  breakfast with a voracity quite peculiar to himself, and in five minutes all that was on the table had disappeared.     . "I hope you will not return to the log cabin with  a fresh pack of cards in your pocket," exclaimed  Mother Garlic, whose soul was ever ready to warn -  other souls, and who thought this a favorable opportunity to lecture the, Publican. "It is a pity Mr. Wadsworth cannot teach you a 2 little godliness." This remark was answered by a mute but expressive appeal. The dame, how- X ever, saw her advantage; she was not going to be! softened by Adams' rolling eyes, and she was X about following up her attack when Lydia pulled her sleeve.  "TWhy, nurse," whispered the girl," ought father to be deprived of the only amusement he can enjoy g until we return? Do let Simon bring-him another i pack. I will not believe that what my parent does is sinful." At these words the goodwife pushed back her chair an inch or two and clasped her hands. Could she believe her ears? was this the sal-me Lydia who had so lately refused the tavern keeper's sinful gift? who but Beelzebub could have wrought such a change? Alas! she was not able to understand the powerful influence which the heart, even in matters of religion, exerts over us,    CHARTER OAK.       121 and how much the girl's scruples had been over- come by love for her father. Lydia, on her part, realized as she had never done before, that the way to Zion is often made by foolish mortals, rougher and more tortuous than God intended it to be, and she gazed at Wadsworth, hoping that he would say something to excuse Adams. Presently the former took his pipe from his mouth, and after blowing a wreath of smoke towards the beams overhead: "I'm sure," said he, "that my friend and com- panion in many an Indian fight would not jeopar- dize his salvation by doing what the church, speak- ing through the civil law, has forbidden. He would no more play cards than hang himself." At these words the culprit's ears tingled while his eyes fastened on his empty platter. He was evidently' much embarrassed. Prudence, on the contrary, sat erect in her chair; her head was thrown slightly back  she looked the very picture of triumph:'  "Adams," she exclaimed, in a jubilant voice, and pointing at him her long, bony fore-finger, "I've got you in a corner now; confess that you're a sinner." The poor fellow surveyed her an instant with such a supplicating expression, that Miss Crabtree had to laugh. But Lydia's eyes flashed. She   122      ROMANCE OF THE         I said nothing however, but deeply regretted to find  Wadsworth as strict on the subject of amusements as her nurse. Had his mind, so strong and origi- nal, bowed down before the bigotry of the age? For the next minute there was silence. The good wife was meditating whether she had better push matters to extremes, and thus; perhaps, bring about a reformation in Simon's conduct, while  the latter was racking his, brains to discover some way of getting out of the scrape. For once Lydia's boldness forsook her; she hesitated to tell h her host what she thought. At length, as if he i had read what was passing through her mind,  Wadsworth took his pipe from his mouth and in a ! solemn voice:  "We must," said he, "obey the laws, which the  Church approves, or else-eternal damnation" ! and the emphasis placed on the last two words 0 sent a shudder through every person in the room. M Simon now jumped up from his seat and was hastening towards the door when Prudence stopped him. "Mr. Wadsworth," she exclaimed, "I want you to ask this stray sheep, whether or no he brought a pack of cards to my house a few days ago."  Wadsworth stared at her a moment, then turn- ing to his friend and lowering his shaggy eye- brows: O          d:           ' (?.    CHARTER OAK,      123 "Did you?" he said. Not one word of truth in the whole story," re- sponded Adams; "and you know   captain, I wouldn't tell a falsehood." ( Then let me hear no more about it," continued Wadsworth impatiently, for he regretted to think that either Simon or his guest must be telling a lie. Here the matter dropped, but the expression on Goody Garlic's face as the tavern-keeper continued his way to the door, was indescribable; it was now his turn to look triumphant. "Oh, Simon, Simon!" she muttered, "what joy you have given Beelzebub, this day." Adams remained outside only a few minutes, then thrust in his head and beckoned to Wads- worth, who immediately joined him in front of the house. "I've something important to communicate," he began, as soon as the door was closed, and after looking around to satisfy himself that nobody was listening: "It is this -Lydia Garlic isn't the real name of that girl inside, nor is she any kin to the woman who came with her last evening. Her mo- ther died many years ago, and she lives. with her father in a small cabin, a day's journey up the river. She takes care of him and nurses him as if he were a child, for he is advanced in years and quite   124      ROMANCE OF THE infirm. At this hour there's not a soul with the old gentleman, and that's why I want to hurry back. The girl, depend upon it, won't be willing to tarry long in Hartford; and it's to consult you about her that I've called you out. Suppose now you give me leave to bring the old man to live with you; you are well off, you wouldn't feel the ex-  pense; whereas he's poor, and it'll make his daugh- ter love you to the end of her days. Ah, captain,  he'll be a lucky fellow that wins her heart." "But you haven't yet told me who she is." "No, I'm coming to it presently; it's a secret  shared only by Prudence and myself, unless one  old maid has told it to the other."  "Well, well, who'is she?" "The daughter of Goffe, the regicide!" respond- ed Adams, lowering his voice.  "No! the soldier who fought so bravely under  Cromwell?" "Yes; and if the veteran has a noble spirit his child is worthy of him. Why,you might ride from here to Boston, from Narragansett Bay back to the last settlement in the wilderness, and not find her equal. ' But I need not stop to recount her virtues. When I was planning with myself to have her brought here, I went over them all to you. Ha! Ha! you didn't suspect then it was Goffe's daughter I was praising."   CHARTER OAK.      125 "And didn't her father come to Hartford seven or eight years ago and remain hidden in Captain Bull's house the summer I was away visiting my relatives in New Haven?" "He did, and I helped him escape, when Andros, who, as you remember, was at that time Governor of New York, formed a plan to kidnap him." "But why did you wait so long before teiling me about Goffe? you knew my admiration for him." "Because, sir, the time hadn't arrived. Now Miss Lydia is in her bloom, and I hope my patience will be rewarded; the flower is ready for you to pick." During the next minute Wadsworth was silent, not a muscle of his face moved, and his eyes wan- dered off to the belfry of the meeting-house. "If you are a bachelor three months hence, my name isn't Simon Adams," pursued the honest fel- low. Still Wadsworth's lips remained closed, his gaze kept fixed on the belfry. "Well, I say, captain, isn't she beautiful? Do speak." "She is-but-." Here Wadsworth, unlike him- self, hesitated. "But what?" cried Adams, "you are thinking of her curls. Bah! that's what I was afraid of. However, they shall not stand in your way; her   126      ROMANCE OF THE tresses shall be cut off. Captain, will that satisfy you?" Another minute passed without the chief of the train-band opening his lips; he seemed to be struggling with himself. -"Yes," he said at length, " you may bring her father here. I will do all I can to make him happy; and by Jehovah, Andros shall never take him away." At this, Simon rubbed his hands, then com- menced to laugh and dance; nor did he stop his capers until he saw Wadsworth frowning. He then,  became quiet and without pressing him further to : tell how he liked Lydia, informed him that he . would hasten back immediately with the good   tidings to Colonel Goffe.           i "'Twill be a joyful surprise to Miss Lydia," he whispered, as they re-entered the house. "I'm thinking of the parent, not of the daughter, responded Wadsworth, for the first time in his life telling what was not altogether the truth. His friend looked at him in wonder. "Folks call me mad," said Adams; "but you're the mad one, not I." It was enough to excite his anger, that a person whom he had known so long and held in such es- teem-the richest man in Hartford, well educated, and possessing so much influence among his fellow i   CHARTER OAK.       127 citizens-should have lived on till his thirtieth 3year without a wife. How much pleasanter the Wadswortlh mansion would become if a woman like Lydia could take the place of Charity Crabtree, who had always seemed to Adams more than half witch. The young folks would then visit it again and make it cheerful, whereas :now it was the most ghostly dwelling in town, and he had sometimes felt afraid to go up into the garret by himself. So out of humor was he with Wadsworth's indiffei'ence about the girl, that he did not even fill his pipe, but hastily ordering Christian to accompany him, left the house without even saying good-bye. Lydia could not believe he would return to her home without letting her know, and when she dis- covered from the goodwife that he had indeed de- parted, she hastened to the door but it was too late, he and the Indian were already out of sight. When she again took her seat by the fire, her host drew near and resting his elbow on the mantel- piece, began examining her narrowly. He looked at her hand, which was stroking Miles' head, then at her foot, which, for an instant, she had withdrawn from the shoe, then at her golden ringlets. But what he admired most was her dimpled chin. Gradually the sternness passed from his face, and when the girl glanced at him he smiled. Miss Crabtree immediately winked at Goody Garlic;   128      R OMANCE OF THE  Goody Garlic -winked back at Charity, and the  latter, placing her mouth close to her friend's ear, whispered: "It's a coming!"         i CHAPTER   .  THE day was too clear and beautiful to remain  in doors, so after Lydia had caressed Miles until the creature was tired of wagging its tail, she pro- S posed to Goody Garlic that they should go out for  a stroll. The girl remembered very little of the town, for when she had been here before she was  only entering her teens, and besides, she had re-  mained but a few months, while Mrs. Bull, in whose  house the regicide had been concealed, had not allowed her a great deal of liberty the good , woman fearing lest she might speak indiscreetly t about her father to other girls. Now it happened that Wadsworth, just as Lydia spoke, had been on the point of inviting her to go out with him. But  it was not his intention to walk; he meant to take her behind him on a pillion, and thus show her all that was to be seen, unaccompanied by 2ru- dence or his aunt. It is more than likely, however, he would have missed the pleasantest jaunt he ever took in his life, had not Charity, who was a shrewd far-seeing woman, already whispered to her friend   CUiAlll;J5 UALI.    .i XU that the girl would no doubt want to go out soon, and if she did, her nephew and she must go alone. Never till now had Prudence used deceit with Lydia, but this time she certainly fibbed, when placing her hand on her brow she declared that she had a headache and could not accompany her. "Come with me, Miss," exclaimed the captain, taking his elbow from the mantel-piece, and as he did so the dog began frisking about. "I will be your guide; I have a trusty nag and a saddle that can carry us both." Without hesitating, Lydia accepted the invita- tion, and as she flew up stairs for her cloak and hood Miss Crabtree gave her friend another wink, and at the same time declared the latter must take a dose of camomile tea. Wadsworth likewise sought his own apartment, having first given orders to have his horse ready in ten minutes. When he re-ap- peared, he was dressed in his very best suit. His pointed shoes were quite new, and ornamented with brass buckles; his cloth coat, which fell be- low his knees, was fastened with hooks and eyes; while around his neck he wore a linen band, pre- pared with wire and starch, so as to make it stand out horizontally, and tied with a yellow cord and tassel. His beaver hat, with an exceedingly broad brim, was shaped like a steeple, and lastly, he wore a watch, a rare thing in those days, and only four   130      ROMANCE OF THE of the gentlemen of Hartford, besides himself, i could boast of one. As soon as Lydia beheld him in the fashionable rig of the Seventeeth century, she with difficulty refrained from laughing, and thought he had looked much better in his deer-skin jacket and high-top boots. Presently a servant announced that the horse was at the door, and Wadsworth, taking a  hazle switch from the top of the cupboard, made her a sign to follow. But when he reached the threshold he stopped, while she passed out, and began stroking the animal's long mane and rubbig  its nose. The steed was of a chestnut color, with small sharp-pointed ears, high shoulders and very broad forehead, indicating gentleness and sagacity. ' "I'm glad you like him," said Wadsworth smiling.  "Oh, very much, sir; pray what is his name,"  "Puritan. He belongs to the Narragansett breed, which is exceedingly fast and enduring, and I never can be too grateful to those citizens of Rhode Island, John Hull, Mr. Brenton, and Bene- dict Arnold, who twenty years ago, inclosed Point M Judith Neck, and devoted their time to raising there a superior race of horses.

"Nothing like a pillion for courting," exclaimed Charity, when they were out of earshot. "But them curls! Oh dear, what scandal they'll give!" "Yet they look mighty pretty fluttering in the wind," said dame Garlic. "I almost wish she might keep them." "'Tween you and me, I wish it too, as far as Joe's concerned," returned the other. "But., we must obey the Church." Here we will leave the old maids awhile, and follow Wadsworth and his fair companion. Entering Main street, the captain turned his horse to the left, and proceeded at a gentle pace towards the southern extremity of the town, which was a mile distant, while Lydia sur- veyed the scene around her with the greatest inter- est and delight. The place had changed a great deal since she had last seen it in 1680. The houses were many of them   new, and the open spaces which separated one from the other, instead of be- ing bare as formerly, were planted with apple trees, whose trunks were now wrapped in straw to protect them from frost. The girl noticed, too, that while many of the dwellings were thatched like her own cabin, not a few had the and shingle roofs; and the 9   132      ROMANCE OF THE second stories of these, the more pretentious ecdi. fies, projected a foot or more beyond the lower, while all had windows with diamond-shaped glass. Owing, perhaps, to the lovely weather, Hartford presented this morning a more than usually ani- mated appearance. Every one of its twelve hun- dred inhabitants* -seemed to have come forth to enjoy the blue sky and delightftl sunshine. Here stood a granny, with scissors in hand, carefully ad-  justing a hollow pumpkin, over the head of her grandchild, whose locks she was about to trim,  while at her side was another crone telling the gos- sip, or discussing the minister's last sermon. Not far off was a group of men, smoking their pipes,  and wondering what Sir Edmund Andros would do next--some thought he might attempt to take  i away the charter of the colony by force; others I dissented from this opinion. Farther on was a bevy of girls in scarlet cloaks, and plain, sombre- colored hoods, unadorned by ribbon or ornament of any kind, and without any curls stealing down their shoulders. They were laughing and chatting, however, quite as much as those of their age and sex do now-a-days, and criticizing full as unmerci- fully awkward Tom and lanky Dick. But besides  i being plainly dressed, they differed in one other respect from maidens of the present generation. *This was the population in 1687.   CHAEIEB OAK,       133 they were more plump and rosy. As Wadsworth and his companion rode by the two crones, the latter ceased gossiping, and while they dropped a curtsy, opened their eyes as wide as saucers and stared in utter amazement. The men did the same, and so did all the other women, while such as had daughters of a marriageable age, were not alto- gether pleased. But the general opinion amongst the men was, that the captain would be: all the better if he took a wife. True, it would add nought to his popularity. No one could dislike a man wmho made such generous use of his worldly goods, who, while he preserved his dignity on all occasions, never slighted anybody, and who, although fond of political discussion, and from his extensive reading certain to come off victorious, never hurt the feel- ings of an opponent; still, for the past few years, Wadsworth had closed his house to all except Adams, and had not attended a single "husking" party or "Bee," and it was only at town meet- ings, and on drill days, that he emerged from his seclusion. But if the men and women stared as the captain and Lydia rode by, it was when the happv couple passed the bevy of lasses, that there i was the greatest commotion and fluttering of I hearts. Faith Genness, a quiet, rather timid girl, bit her lip until the blood came, while Dorothy   134      ROMANCE OF THEjj Philbrick declared that she had never been so scandalized before. "Curls!-and such sinful ones too-Oh dear!" Faith, who was the youngest of them, attempted  to offer a feeble apology for the stranger, and hinted that they should all be allowed to wear them. "Why not?" she said. "'Long hair is natural to our sex, and you cannot say that yonder maiden sitting  behind Captain Joe, doesn't look much better for , hers."  But this remark was met by such a storm of m frowns, that Miss Genness spoke not another word;! yet every one of her companions secretly agreed I with her. Jealousy, however, smothered every  other feeling.          ' When Wadsworth and Lydia had proceeded   g about a quarter of a mile, they came to the village / green, which was situated on the east side of the  road, and in the centre of it stood an odd-looking : structure with pyramid roof and belfry. Posted j on the door was a notice of the last town meeting, E which the sexton had neglected to remove, while  on the right of the entrance was a pile of fliat stones, about four feet high, called a horse-block, E and which was intended to assist the women wor- shipers in getting off their pillions.  "This," said Wadsworth, stopping his horse, "is  where I come to worship. It is our oldest meeting-     . .i * ' N   *-'       ' 'l   CHARTER  OAK.         LOU ouse. There is another one, built in 1670, which e will come to by and by.    Take notice now, lere are not many graves around it yet, for we re a sober, God-fearing people, and death has een sparing of us." The tombstones, which certainly were not numer- is, stood on the right and left of the building, as ell as in the rear. Some bore no name or inscrip- on of any kind, and these he informed her mark- 1 the resting-places of strangers, who had wan-  ared hither from  Europe, or other parts of the )untry, and died without being known to any of Le citizens.  "There," he continued, pointing to a plain slab red sand stone, about five inches thick, and ised a little from the ground on blocks of the tme material, " there is where the Reverend Sam- 21 Stone is buried. Can you read the inscription?" lere, patiently waiting for the resurrection, lies Reverend Samuel Stone. Deceased ye 61 year of his age, 30th day of July, 1663.

Hartford, thy richest jewel's here interred."   136       RO3ANCE OF THE When Lydia had read it, Wadsworth drew lher attention to another slab, on which was written: "In memory of REV. THOMAS HOOKEE, who, in 1636, planted the first church in Connecticut." "I've shown you these graves," he said, "be- cause they cover the remains of two great men, but for whose spirit of Godliness, and the little account they made of the dangers of the wilder- ness, Connecticut would not have been what she is to-day. You must know,Miss, that the Reverend Samuel Stone and Mr. Hooker came here from Cam- bridge, Massachusetts, as long ago as 1636. The country is wild enough now; fancy what it must  have been then, roamed over by the savage Pe- quots. Their only guide was a compass, and they were a fortnight on the way. The hundred men, women and children who accompanied them were not a band of emigrants, impelled by a restless spirit to seek a new home, but like their leaders they were filled with the grace of the Almighty. They startled the wild beasts with their hymns. It was a church moving west.": Here he paused a moment, then went on. "It has been said, liss, that we have had-- "'Cotton for our clothing, Hooker for our fishing, And Stone for our building.'. "These three divines, Cotton, Hooker and Stone, came over from England in 1633. The first wrote   an excellent Catechism, entitled "Cotton's Milk for Babes," which I will show you in my library, and his daughter became the wife of Increase Mather, who is now the pillar of the church in New Eng- land. By her, Dr. Mather has a son named Cot- ton, a more extraordinary man even than his father, and who promises to root every witch out of the land. I have never met him, but the doctor is ex- pected here shortly, and will be my guest during his stay." There was another tombstone close by the graves  of the ministers, which bore the name of Nancy Clark, and which attracted Lydia's attention, from L the following quaint lines carved on it "Remember me as you pass by, For as you are so once was I; As I am now, so you must be, Prepare in time to follow me." While she was reading them, the bell of the meeting-house began to toll, and Wadsworth im- mediately let the reins drop, and crossing his arms, murmured: "There's another soul departed; whose turn next?" At this moment two men, who had come from the rear of the church, assumed a like attitude, and the girl could not help thinking what a solemn cus- tom it was thus to take note of a death. "Good morning, Mr. Barebones, good morning,   138      ROMANCE OF THE Mr. Japheth," exclaimed the captain, after he had said a prayer. One of those whom he thus ad- dressed, Jacob Japheth, was tithing-man of the I'arish, and to him Lydia immediately took -a fancy. Yet he was anything but handsome, his short-body being much inclined to corpulence, and he had only one eye; but that one twinkled so merrily, and his face wore such a pleasant smile, as he returned the captain's greeting, that she felt he was an honest man, and that the world had gone easy with him. His companion was tall and thin, with a high, well-developed brow, which showed him to be a person of thought. His countenance, however, did not please, it was so lugubrious, and the girl was convinced there was a skeleton in his closet, some secret grief the world knew nothing  of. Israel Barebones held the position of Ruling  [Elder. Wadsworth did not enter into conversa- tion with either of them, but went on to explain to Lydia that the "Green" was used once a month as a drill ground. "I am," said he, "captain of the train-band, and of the three thousand fighting men Connecti- cut can furnish, none are braver than the Hartford lads." He added, that she must certainly remain until next drill day. To this, Lydia made no response; her attention seemed to be attracted towards another   CHARTER OAK.       139 building, smaller than the church, and which stood on the north-east corner of the "Green." Wads- worth immediately directed his horse there, and t stopped when he was within a few paces of the I door, which was studded with heavy nails and had  an immense rusty lock, with a keyhole, into which I you might thrust two or three fingers at once. "This," said he, after she had examined it a mo- ; ment, "is our jail; and yonder," pointing his switch at a locust tree close by, with a couple of iron rings in it, "is our whipping post; while that," slightly changing the direction of the whip, "is the stocks." For a minute Lydia stared at the tree, then at the other instrument of torture, which resembled a section of board fence, perforated by a number of holes, the upper ones being meant to clasp the offender's wrist, the lower ones his ankles, then shook her head. "These are always placed near thfe house of worship," he went on, not perceiving her look of disapprobation, " in order that the sinner, while he meets his deserts, may have his mind turned in a pious direction." Still the girl shook her head. "What!" he cried, suddenly looking at her, and his heavy eyebrows seemed to grow darker and heavier as he spoke: "What! do these objects   "O'      ROMANCE OF THE offend you? Rather rejoice, Miss, that the Lord's commandments may thus be enforced." But Lydia's countenance still indicated too plainly what her thoughts were, and giving the reins an angry jerk he hastened back into the road, with a pang in his heart. "Alas!" he murmured, "she is beautiful, but she has yet much to learn. Adams declares she is fond of books, and that she thnks as I do about the future of the Colonies; but in matters of re- ligion she is no better than an infant."  For the next five minutes neither of them spoke. , Both regretted having gone near the jail. Per- haps Wadsworth regretted it the most, and yet he was half inclined to believe a special Providence had guided him there, in order to reveal how utterly unsuited such a maiden would be for a wife, But 'for this revelation her beauty might have got the better of him, and a solemn vow have been broken.  While these thoughts were passing through his mind Lydia was thinkling of him. "I have no doubt;" she said to herself, "he is a, remarkable man; but oh! how, cross! I'd have given any thing if the stranger who saved my life had proved to be Captain Wadsworth. What if he were to fall in love with me!"! As this idea struck her she laughed, and h-er host, who could see no cause for her levity, showed   CHARTER OAK.     .  ll1 his annoyance by touching Puritan with the spur. The animal bounded forward. But presently the captain reined- him in again and passed leisurely between two groups of boys, rosy-cheeked and saucy, who were fighting a battle with snow-balls; and it took all their reverence for Wadsworth to restrain them from pelting his horse. They had now reached the tavern, or Ordinary, as it was called, a frame building on the east side of the way, with a sign-board on which was painted a bunch of grapes. A dead wolf, which some hunter had brought in, was lying on the stoop, its ears cut off, and a dog cautiously smelling the carcass, as if not quite sure the animal was dead. Wadsworth, breaking the silence, informed his com- panion that it was here the General Court met, and added that the house was said to be the oldest in -town. "Well, a jovial company must be assembled within," remarked Lydia; "hear how they are laughing." "Aye, Miss, a' game of shovel-board is going on, and I fear the guests have had more than half a pint of wine each, which is the lawful quan- tity; they are indeed very hilarious. But Satan cannot always be checked, and the fellow who keeps the Bunch of Grapes during Simon's absence is not troubled with scruples."   "2       ROMANCE. OF THE Continuing their way a little further, they met a- gaunt individual, clad in deerskin suit and fur cap, who was driving a sled load of wood to the market. place, which was a short distance in rear of the old meeting house, near what :was thenr called Meeting House Alley. "Good morning, Cap.," he exclaimed; "any news?" Wadsworth shook his head, then told him that he hoped to have some by next drill-day. "Well, I'll be there," said the woodman, "never missed a drill yet. But Cap., we'll soon ha-ve spring. Hark! don't you hear the blue-bird?"  ; and as he spoke he raised his hand and pointed towards the, sky. Sure enough, Lydia heard at that moment the wild, somewhat plaintive note of the pioneer of the feathered tribe, and it made her think of the many times she and her father had welcomed this sound together, as they stood  on the threshold of the cabin, for it told them that winter was drawing to a close.  Presently they came to a bridge, spanning a narrow stream, which Wadsworth informed her was Little River. "It falls, Miss, into Great River* at Dutch Point, a neck of land about a mile below us, and which gets its name from  the Dutch having built a fort there in 1633.

Skirting the north side of the stream, was a road leading from Dutch Point across what, in those days, was known as Little Meadow, to a flour and a saw-mill, which stood half a mile west of the main -street; while immediately south of the bridge was another high- way, which began at South Meadow and followed the banks of the river as far as the same mills. While they were crossing, Lydia noticed an old, weather-beaten chair dangling by a couple of ropes from the limb of a willow tree on the further bank, and naturally asked what it was used for. But WTadsworth merely shrugged his shoulders, and as she did not repeat the question, she remained for the time being in ignorance of what a ducking- stool was. The first house beyond the bridge and east of the road attracted her attention, for it was quite unlike any she had yet seen. It was of dark- colored stone, and had a flat roof, with only a single chimney and that one right in the centre. From the door to the gate, opening on the street, ran a path hedged with box-wood, and there was more of the same shrub arranged in circles here and there, as if for flower-beds. They were almost opposite the gate when Wadsworth muttered some-   "!:      ROMANCE OF THE  thing, then heaving a deep sigh turned and looked the other way. For the first time now since they had started on their jaunt, they met a person who neithjr greeted them, nor even raised his hat as they went past! Leaning on the gate was a man of perhaps fifty-five or sixty years of age, with cold, grey eyes, which seemed to penetrate you with their stare. His whole expression was sinister, and the thin -lips which were pressed firmly together,  looked as if they never parted in good-humored  mirth. But some one else besides this individual  was watching them from behind the blinds of a second story window.  "Who is he?" said Lydia, when they were out of  hearing. "Nathaniel Clark," replied Wadsworth, with abruptness, and as if she had broken in upon the current of his thoughts. Then in a more gentle tone, ' His wife exchanged worlds some years ago. It was her gravestone which bore the epitaph be- ginning : Remember me, as you pass by.' I have always believed that she died of a broken heart. A most pious, Christian woman, and we miss her very much at meeting." "I fear, sir, the widower and yourself are not on good terms," pursued Lydia.   CHARTER OAK.       145 "True, we rarely speak to one another. He is no American!" "You mean, sir, that he sides with the king?" "Precisely, and therefore no love lost between us. It is fortunate that he cannot write, and that he reads with difficulty; for if his scholarship were equal to his natural shrewdness he would have done even more harm than he has. But, alas! another hand than his  Here Wadsworth again sighed, and left the phrase unfinished. "Oh, how blind the people are," he continued, after a pause. "Over and over have I told them that the easiest way to- get-rid of our troubles would be to declare ourselves independent; have nothing more to do with England; drive Andros and his minions into the sea. But oh, what uphill work it is to beat anything new into even sensible folks' heads! I sometimes believe Doctor Mather takes me for a visionary when I write to him on this subject, while our Ruling Elder, although a strict Puritan, and consequently a hater of Bishops and Kings, does not sympathize at all with my scheme for a revolution. He would rather have us fast and pray and leave our destiny to be worked out by the Almighty. Hence, Mr. Barebones unwillingly plays into the hands of Nathaniel Clark, who is a brazen-faced royalist. .,   "6       ROMANCE OF THE But depend upon it we must use our arms, as well as our tongues; we must fight as well as pray, or else be content to wear our shackles until they mst- off. But no such policy for me! My dream will come true; we shall win our Independence even though every stream in the land runs red with blood." "I agree with you heart and soul!" exclaimed Lydia, " none but cowards can side with Mr. Bare-  bones, none but traitors with Nathaniel Clark."  She had scarcely spoken when Wadsworth turned ; upon her all the fire of his deep sunken eyes. By a powerful effort, however, he restrained himself. "No, no! I will smother it," he m ttered, "it is only a germ yet; if I dally with it, it may master me."  There was something so strange in his gaze that Lydia scarcely knew what to think; she little dreamed of the agitation into which she had plunged his soul. They rode on in silence past another meeting-house, the same which her host had told her had been built in 1670.* It was not pyramid shaped like the one on the green, and over the spire was a glittering rooster, which at this moment pointed due west.   As they went by, Wadsworth remarked that Hartford was the first * It stood on the east side of Main street, a few yards south of what is now called Sheldon street.   CHARTER OAR.       147 town after Boston, to have more than one place of worship. In a few moments they came to a lane, crossing Main street at right angles, and down which they turned. "I am going to show you," said her guide, "a favorite spot of mine-one that I love for the sake of the view, and secondly, because there stands there the noblest tree in the land." As they advanced, the ground on their right be- came more elevated, until it might have been called a gentle hill, and presently they reached the tree. It was an oak of most majestic appearance, with limbs as thick as the trunks of many other trees, and a circumference of full twenty-two feet. Near the roots was a cavity large enough for a child to clter, and at the mouth of it, basiiing in the sun shine, perhaps listening to the blue-birds, and hoping that this was the last snow of winter, sat a squirrel. "Here," said Wadsworth reining in his steed, is where I come summer evenings, to listen to the whippoorwills; they are heard on Wyllys' Hill sooner than anywhere else." Then gazing up, ' What a grand old oak! I dare say a thousand years have passed, since the acorn dropped from which it sprang." "It could not be more beautiful," returned Lydia; "those who dwell in yonder mansion,   "8      ROMANCE OF THE should be proud to have it so near. Pray who lives there?"  "Mr. Samuel Wyllys.  All this land around belongs to him. It is said that before Governor Wyllys came to America, his steward, whom he had sent forward to prepare his 'new home, was on the point (fool that he must have been),  of cutting down this oak, when -some Indians  begged him to spare it. 'It has been,' said they, 'our ancestors' guide for centuries, as to the time of planting corn. When the leaves are the size of a mouse's ear, then put the seed in the ground.' " "Well, for their sake, captain, I hope 'twill stand many more years." "Yonder," continued her host, pointing to a  small wooden structure, on top of the hill, "is a watch tower. We have another at my end of the town. But guards are not posted in them during the day, as formerly; at night, however, there is always somebody there. I am going -to urge the people to come back to our old custom and have a watch set the whole twenty-four hours.

For my part, I am convinced that Andros is tampering with the heathen, who will do whatever bloody work he tells them." "Such allies," said Lydia, "would be of great assistance to his Excellency, in carrying out his nefarious schemes. I wonder Adams, when he brought me news, did not even hint at this." "Well, it was from him, Miss, I got my informa- tion. He is my great scout. Yet with all his daring, he is prudent and was, mayhap, afraid lest even his whispers might reach the ear of that Pequot youth, who is in your service." "Surely, he might have trusted Christian!" "Oh! his race is treacherous ; and in spite of my reverence for John Eliot, from whom our Ruling Elder gets his good opinion of them, they cannot live side by side with us. Let them read the Holy Book, if they will, I do not object; but at the same time the, must not stand in the way of civilization." After remaining nearly ten minutes under the tree, they rode back into Main street, and pursuing a southerly direction soon found themselves at the last dwellingsa log cabin about the size of Lydia's home. The door opened as they went by, and a stout woman, with A very red face, which was- beaming with good humor, dropped them a curtsy. Wadsworth lifted his hat, but at the same time   150      ROMANCE OF THE, frowned. Lydia thought she had seen the woman before; yes she recognized her as the same gen- erous being, who had once offered shelter to her- self and her parent. "That's the widow  Bull," said Wadsworth, "whose husband was lost at sea a year ago. Strange what a light heart she can keep-always smiling-better she should weep for her sins. Did you notice the ribbons in her cap?  'Tis well she does not wear them at meeting, which I K grieve to say she rarely attends. Her husband was  just like her in character, but being a seafaring  man, I could make allowances-and, besides, he did one righteous act, for which no doubt the Lord forgave him much." Here the speaker glanced at his companion, who had been tempted to jump off the pillion and give the widow a kiss. Presently Wadsworth drew in his horse, and called her attention to al meadow on their right, which was perfectly smooth and without a single rock or stump: "There," said he, "is a piece of land which the town has given for the support of a free school; whoever hires it will get a profitable retu:n for his labor, while the rent is to go towards the salary of the pedagogue. But tell me, who is that person at the further end of the field? Methinks 'tis Clark." "It is he, sir," replied Lydia.   CHARTER OAK.       151 "Humph! I wonder what the fox is after? Only two days ago I found him measuring off this same ground; now there he is at it again." "Perhaps he wants to hire it, and may pay a large rent, if he is zealous in the cause of educa- tion, which he ought to be, considering the disad- vantages he must feel himself placed under by his own want of schooling."' "Not he, Miss," returned Wadsworth, his eye still fixed upon Mr. Clark. "Why, he was the only one who did not approve the law of 1677, which or- dained that every town neglecting to keep a school above three months in the year, should forfeit five pounds for every defect; and I have no doubt, although it was before my time, he likewise oppos- ed( the code of 1650, which declared that every township of fifty householders should maintain a pedagogue." "A most wise'ordinance, sir." "It was indeed; ignorance being the' great stumbling-block to self-government. Parents find it difficult to shirk their duty, for once a year every family suspected of not educating their children, is visited by the grand jurors.,' They now turned and went back at the same gentle gait towards Hartford, and Lydia hoped to catch another glimpse of MrIs. Bull. In this, how- ever, she was disappointed; the widow had proba-   152      EOMANCE OF THE bly noticed Wadsworth's frown, and so kept in  doors. As they approached the square stone man- sion, her host urged on his steed ; but did not avert his face; on the contrary, this time he gazed full at the building. They had almost passed it, when the door opened, and to Lydia's surprise Miiles Standish bounded forth-in a molment the crea- ture had jumped the picket fence, and was cutting/  all sorts of capers around them. To see the cap- tain's favorite issuing from his enemy's abode, was enoulgh to excite the girl's wonder and curiosity. i However, she asked no questions. Could she have caught a glimpse of Wadsworth's face, she would, have been even more astonished at the agitation depicted on it; and as if something were pursuing him, he gave Puritan a hard cut with the whip, which made the horse dart forward at such a pace, that in two minutes they were across Little River, and almost at the old meeting-house. Here he allowed the reins to slacken, and presently they  met again the rugged woodman, now going baclk to his cabin on the edge of the forest, looking very  cheerful, and the honest fellow doffed his coonskin cap with so much ceremony that Lydia had to laugh, while her companion shrugged his shoulders. "Our friend has tucked more than one cup of sack under his coat, since we last saw him," said Wadsworth. "I must tell the keeper of the Ordi- ,^         .   CHAE RER OAK.       153 nary to be on his guard; he is dealing out liquor too freely." (]But the fellow doesn't appear tipsy," remarked Lydia, "I should only call him  merry. This telling folks what games they are to play; how much they are to drink; and what clothes they can wear, does not strike me as wise." She spoke playfully, yet at the same time meant to administer a gentle reproof to her host for his narrow views. Wadsworth made ing response, nor did he open his lips again till they reached the house.. Here, without waiting for his assistance, she slid down from the pillion and was about raising the latch, when he sprang off the horse, and catching her by the arm begged her to stay a moment. Tossing back her curls and endeavoring to assume- a serious air, Lydia bade him say what he had to say. But the words were slow in coming; there was a flush upon the brow of her host. t' How has my native town pleased you?" he ask- ed, after a pause, during which his heart throbbed  as it had not done in many a year. ( Oh, ever so much, sir, ever so much, and I'd like to live here all my life, if " "If Colonel Goffe were only with you," he whis- pored. Lydia gave a start and turned deadly pale.   154      ROMANCE OF THE "Oh, do not fear," he continued, smiling; "Adams has let me into the secret. Rest -assured your parent is in no danger; I would shed the last drop of my blood in his defence, and so would every member of the train-band." As he spoke, he allowed his hand to touch hers, but gently and timidly. The struggle, though it lasted only a few moments, was a terrible one. Thej flush was yet upon his brow, when the door opened and his aunt and Goody Garlic appeared, looking 3 ever so pleased, and with tongues itching to ask  the happy pair how they had enjoyed each other's  company. But they wisely resolved not to hurry! matters. Every thing was working smoothly, and when Lydia entered, the old nurse threw her arms around her neck and told her she was a very, very- good girl; while Wadsworth, as he led the horse towards the stable, exclaimed," a chaste and beau- tiful woman is the godliest thing God has made." But his rhapsody did not last long. Even while he was unstrapping the saddle, his countenance as- sumed a look of deepest melancholy; and as he went back to the house he murmured: ' for me the Proverb was not written, ' a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband.' "'   CIARTER OAK.       155 CHAPTER   VI.' IT WAS a very pleasant surprise to Miss Crabtree, when the noon-day repast was over, to hear her nephew invite Lydia into his study. This apart- ment was on the same floor as the one where they were in the habit of assembling, but being a great deal smaller, and not having any fire-place, was far from being as comfortable. The girl, who had longed to get a glimpse of this retreat, or den, as Charity sometimes called it when out of humor with the captain, immediately laid aside her knit- ting and followed her host, Miles Standish keeping close behind, and wagging his great bushy tail, as if he were as much pleasedas any body to have his master falling in love. The room where she pres- ently found herself was indeed a queer place, and belied the reputation for method and order which Wadsworth enjoyed among the town-folk.  On every side disorder was visible. The shelves for books were half empty, andc their contents, some wide. open with ugly dog-ears in them, others with backs and edges gnawed by mice, lay scattered about the floor, while goose quills by'the dozen were strewn under foot. In fact you might have supposed some malicious person had entered and turned every thing topsy-turvy. The only objects   156      ROMANCE OF THE arranged as they should be, were a pair of heavy top-boots, and these stood side by side, heel to heel. But as though Miles knew they were not in keeping with the rest of the scene, he walked up to them and with a shove of his nose, knocked the right one over on the left, then looked round at his master with something very like a twinkle in his eye. After making his guest seat herself on the only chair the study contained, Wadsworth folded his arms and stood watching her. He hardly knew how to interpret her expression, as she surveyed  the apartment. It was one of mingled pleasure and disgust; for while her thirst for knowledge was excited, her womanly instinct of neatness and clean-  liness was shocked by the dust and the cobwebs. Presently she stooped and picked up the book which was nearest to her.  'That," said he, "is the Assembly Catechism, than which nought can be more interesting and profitable." A hasty glance satisfied Lydia that she would rather not peruse it, so setting it on her lap she turned towards the table at her elbow, where, un- rolled to its full length, with a stone pressing down each corner, was a map of North America. No sooner had she begun examining it, than her host changed color and his face grew troubled.   CHARTER OAK.       157 "Did you draw this, sir?" she inquired, after studying it a few minutes. "No; its origin is wrapped in mystery." , Then lowering his voice: "I found it here one morn- ing, six or seven years ago; yet when I left the room the evening before, I turned the key in the lock, and securely fastened the window." "Strange!" "Very, Miss, very; and only that the chart has proved so useful, I might have been inclined to think it the work of a witch, of whom several have been seen to ride over the town astraddle broom- sticks. But I cannot believe any one connected with Beelzebub would have served me such a good turn. My fear is that a witch may get in and de- stroy the map; that is why I have a horse-shoe yonder," pointing at one hanging on a peg near the door. This reminded Lydia that there also was a horse-shoe at the head of her bed. Now had she been differently brought up, or rather had she lived in a more enlightened age, she would have laughed at such superstition in a man of the in- tellect of her host. Instead of this, however, she became grave herself, and murmured a short prayer, which Goody Garlic had taught her, in order to drive away the Evil Spirit. "Well, no matter how it came here," she re- sumed, after a pause; "you ought to make copies   158       ROMANCE OF THE of it, and distribute them among the people. It would give them a 'better idea than they now have of the size of this country." Then running her finger westward along the map:  I perceive, sir, that you claim as far as the Pacific." "Of course, Miss Goffe. Let me read a short extract from our charter, and you will see I am right in thus giving the boundary of Connecticut." As he spoke he opened a drawer under the table, and taking out a sheet of paper began to read: "Bounded on the east by the Narragansett river, commonly called Narragansett Bay, wlhere the said river falleth into the sea ; and on the north by file line of the Massachusetts Plantation, and on the South by the sea, and in longitude as the line of the Massachusetts Colony runneth from 'east to west; that is to say, from the said Narragansett Bay on the east, to the South Sea (Pacific Ocean), on the west part, with the islands thereunto ad- joining.'                 , After conversing a few minutes longer on the Geography of America, they began talking of Europe, and Wadsworth was pleased to find that she knew as much about the old world as he did himself. Presently she picked up another book, and with a roguish smile, said: "I wonder Miss Crabtree allows your library to   eO CHARTER OAK. '       159 be in Such disorder, while every other part of the i house is like wax."   "Blame not my aunt," he responded; " before you, no woman, at least with my consent, ever en-  tered it,"  il  "Well, perhaps--" here she looked archly at him--"you will allow?me to come here, for I am L fond of reading, but until now the only works that have been within my reach are the Bible and Pil- grim's Progress." "Ah! a great book that of John Bunyan's; and I never was tired of reading my copy of it, before it got lost. I always attributed its disappearance to my aunt's broom, for she did manage once to penetrate my sanctum. 'Twas well I did not find it in her dust-pan, or I might have given way to my temper and spoken words I would afterwards have bitterly regretted." "I cannot believe, sir, she would have been so careless." "'Well, who then took it? Even Simon has never crossed this threshold! To be sure, he was with me the day I found my aunt sweeping, but he did not follow me in here; at least I am pretty sure he didn't, and besides, he is not given to reading." It had occurred too Lydia, while Wadsworth was speaking, that the Pilgrim's Progress, which the tavern-keeper had given her, might be the very one   160'      ROMANCE OF THE          l which was missing, in which case she ought to re- store it. :But how was she to do so without bring- ing a scolding on Mad Adams? After thinking over this a moment, she commenced blowing the  dust off another volume.  "That," said the captain, leaning over her shoulder, c is the little law book which every family is required by the General Court to keep, in order that no man may plead ignorance of what the law A is. It does not cost much-twelve pence in silver, or one and a half pecks of wheat, or two-thirds of a bushel of peas at three shillings a bushel. I hope you will read it." "I will, sir. Pray, what work is this?" taling up another volume. "The Bay Psalm Book, Miss. It contains all the Psalms, faithfully translated into English meter, by the Reverend Mr. Weld and John Eliot, who knew the original Hebrew. It was printed at Cam- bridge, Massachusetts, nearly fifty years ago." Lydia next examined Eliot's Indian Bible, print- ed in 1664; then, New England's Salamander Lis- covered, printed in London in 1647. Next she  E took up the Heart of New England Rent at the Blasphemies of the Present Generation; or, a Brief  Extract concerning the Doctrine of the Quakers-  demonstrating the Destructive Nature thereof to    CHARTER OAK.       161 Religion, the Churches and the State, with Consid- erations of the Remedy against it. "A rather long title," remarked Wadsworth,     "but an excellent book, written by John Norton, formerly teacher of Christ Church at Boston, and   3 who held that the devil made the Quakers." "Did he?" exclaimed Lydia, letting the volume o fall upon the floor; " then it shall remain where I found it, and sorry am I that I blew the dust off. I hate bigots, and he must have been one." These words gave her host another shock-they reminded him of how she had spoken about the stocks and whipping-post. "Alas, alas! what am I co-ming to!" he said to limself. "Here is a woman not only in my library, )ut actually daring to criticise the writings of John Norton, and I standing by in silence!" At this moment Lydia turned upon him one of ler bewitching glances. '"How weak I am!" he [roaned; "how weak I am. What infatuation has eized me? But I will crush it; it is yet only a :ermin Presently she took up the New England Primer, work suited for children, and which began with he alphabet and ended with a strange poetic dia- )gue between Christ, a youth, and Satan. Next ame Cotton's Milk for Babes, a very popular Ca- echism, but she only glanced at it, then let it fall '* *'   162      ROMANCE OF THE on bcr lap, and began dusting another book with a very L',ig title, and which her host informed her was the latest addition to. his library. It was written in verse, and appeared to be a satire aimed at the foI- lies rife in England and the Colonies. Its name was, The simple Cobbler of Agawam, in America, willing to help mend his native country, lamentably tattered both in the upper leather and the sole, with all the honest stitches he can take, and as will-  ing never to be paid for his work by old English wonted pay. It is his trade to patch all the year round gratis-therefore I pray, gentlemen, keep your-purses. By Theodore de la Guard. London: Printed in Pope's Head Alley. Its real author, Wadsworth informed her, was Nathaniel Ward,: minister of Ipswich. Then came the Day of Doom, a much admired work, giving a description of the Last Judgment, by"Michael Wigglesworth, A,. M. But what pleased Lydia most was a volume of poems by Ann Bradstreet, daughter of old Governor Dudley, and wife of Governor Bradstreet. "You are fond of poetry?" asked Wadsworth. "I have never read any, sir," she replied, "but I love the flowers and birds, and methinks this work will be just to my taste; so I shall put it in my pocket and read it at my leisure." "Humph!" exclaimed her host, shrugging his   J JZJU ALMJLJ-JU VAI AI  -.w shoulders, " better peruse the Assembly Catechism. However, do as you like." By this time the girl had her lap full, and as she did not pick up any more, we will, for the satisfac- tion of the reader, give the names of some of the other volumes which completed the collection. There was a History of the World, and the Turkish Empire; a History of Queen Elizabeth; Calvin's Institutions; Cesar's Commentaries; Bariffe's Ar- tillery; Burrough's Christian Contentment; Ball on Faith; Dod on the Lord's Supper; Wilson's Dictionary; Homer's Illiad, and two Bibles. Wads- worth, after he had helped her a moment arrange the books on the shelves, stopped, and folding his arms, said: "I presume, from the retired life you have been leading, that you are not a member of any church?" "No, sir, and yet I trust I am no heathen." "Well, well, that point we will not discuss at pre- sent; I feel sure, however, that when you do be- come a member, the unorthodox views you hold on certain subjects will be dissipated. Yes, you must own the Covenant." "But there is no church where my home is, and I must return in a few days." A faint smile played on the captain's lips as she said this; he rejoiced to think he had invited her   164      ROMANCE OF THE' father to come and dwell with him. But mingled with his desire to befriend the regicide, was there not deep in Wadsworth's heart another motive which had prompted him to offer Colonel Goffe the hospitality of his roof, and which, as hee gazed on Lydia's face, again brought the color to his brow? Was that dimpled chin, those hazel eyes, that cheek slightly crimsoned by a blush, to become the prize of another man? As this thought was shaping it- self in his mind, for he hardly dared acknowledge,dt even to himself, the fascination she was beginning  to exercise over him, the girl tuhned and went to  the window, where, after gazing out a moment, she gave a deep sigh. Startled by this exhibition of grief, Wadsworth advanced towards her, and in a voice full of tenderness asked the cause of her trou- ble.  At first she did not answer. "I was thinking, sir,"- she said, when he had repeated the question, "of my dear father. See, yonder is a crow flying  in the direction of home. I wish I could go with it."  "Oh, Miss Goffe, you'll soon see your parent' again; yes, very soon. Pray leave the window and read with me a few pages of the Assembly Cate- chism." "Better let me take the book with me when I return to the wilderness; I do not feel like study- ing while I'm here."'   CHAlRTER OAK.      165- He would fain have urged the matter, but discov- ering that her will was as strong as his own, he withdrew his hand from the volume, and remained silently watching her; while Miles, who had been dozing under the table, jumped up and gave a whint--he creature seemed to feel that it's master had not shown it as much attention to-day, as usual. "How long have you had your' shadow?'" in- quired Lydia, patting the dog's head. "Six or seven years: Miss, which is about the time my aunt has been keeping house for me. Oh, how lonelv I'd have been without Miles!", "And you have neither parents, brothers nor sis- ters living?" "No, they have all exchanged worlds. It was fortunate that I had an unmarried relative in New Haven, who was willing to come and take up her abode here, when the last of them died; for, as a single man, I would have been forbidden to dwell by myself." "What laws you have!'" exclaimed Lydia, laughl- "Severe, but righteous, Miss;"Wadsworth's brow contracting a little as he spoke. "But even if no law had forbidden you to live alone, could you have been happy, all by yourself, in such a vast house? I think my skin would creep if I were in it, with no one else."   166      ROMANCE OF THE "My dog and my books would bhae been corn pany enough." Well, doubtless you know by heart the contents of each volume." "Very nearly. Not an idle hour have I spent since Aunt Crabtree came to Hartford. Days and nights have I sat up reading and meditating, and all in order to fit myself for accomplishing one great end."  "And pray what may that be?" "The Independence of these Colonies! Already my superior learning has given me great influence over the people, not only of Hartford, but of many other towns; the majority recognize me as a leader',. and the partisans of the king know me, and hate me." "Oh, you will triumph over them :111-you will, you will!" exclaimed Lydia, her countenance ra- diant with enthusiasm. At these words the strong man's frame quivered, his eyes flashed as they met hers; then with a groan he bowed his head and cov- ered his face with his hands. The, cause of his trouble she did not ever so faintly dream of. "Oh, do not despond, Mr. Wadsworth," she con- tinued, resting her hand on his arm--and how the touch of it thrilled him!-"Andros has all Englalnd at his back, you have the freemen of America. If we strike we conquer. No, do not despond." Pros-   CHARTER OAK.       167 ently he uncovered his face, and in a solemn tone -." I must, he said, "first conquer myself, before I can reach the goal. But I will pray for strength, Jehovah will hear my prayer." "What can he mean?" thought Lydia, half in- clined to laugh, " is my host such a sinner?" Then after a pause : "I cannot understand," she said, "how there should be any party opposed to you, no, really I cannot." Well, there is, and its chief is Nathaniel Clark; a man, as I have already remarked, of great natural ability and with as much energy and daring as my- self. Randolph and Dudley used to send him gold wherewith to corrupt the people, and I am pretty certain Andros is doing the same thing now. Those strangers you met on your way here and whom I afterwards saw at the Bunch of Grapes, were no doubt sent by Sir Edmund for some such purpose. But besides Mr. Clark, there is our ruling elder who stands in my way. Israel Barebones is a man of eminent piety and wonderful courage, and you might burn him at the stake before you would make him abjure the Puritan faith; yet I cannot help thinking he is far astray when he urges us to trust only in Providence, in order to free ourselves from tyranny. Did not Joshua of old fight as well as pray? Oh, Miss Goffe, it has been hard work to keep true to my purpose. But now I find an ob-   10N      SROMANCE OF THE stacle in my path, that may prove even harder to overcome than open enemies like Mr. Clark, or well meaning, though foolish Christians like Israel Bare. bones" "What may that obstacle be?" exclaimed Lydia, impatiently. "My own self. But I will pray for strength; I will fast and do penance that the temptation may be removed. Alas! my soul will be in jeopardy unless I triumph over it." Here there was anl- other pause, the longest one yet, during which Wadsworth turned his back upon the girl and stood gazing on the floor. At length, anxious to break a silence which troubled her, accompanied as it was by such conduct on the part of her host, Lydia asked him to tell her something of the history of Simon Adams, who, she said, was their mutual friend. "I will, I will,' exclaimed the Captain, ab-' ruptly facing her again, and looking as if he, were glad she had disturbed the current of his. thoughts. "I first met him during King Philip's war, in 1675, when we served in the same company; and if I am alive to-day it is thanks to him, for he twice saved me from the tomahawk of the savages. Since then he has led a roving life, but his wander- ings have had a purpose in them which people did not divine. It is through him I have been able to   CHARTER OAK.       169 obtain information of what is going on in the dif- ferent Colonies; and as he has a sharp ear, a quick eye and daring spirit, few things have remained hidden frm him. Lately I thought it best to have him near me, for matters seemed approaching a crisis, so I have procured him a license to keep the Bunch of Grapes. His conduct thus far has given no offence to the selectmen and he goes to meet- ing as regularly as I do myself." "Well, was he ever other than good?" "Yes; I regret to say, there was a time when our friend was given to drinking too much liquor; and once, while in a state of intoxication, he attempted to break up a town meeting, and for that offence he is -even to this day suffering, for they have taken away from him the title of ' Mr.'" "Do you think that dreadful punishment has had much effect on him?" said Lydia, smiling. Wadsworth frowned a moment, then answered: "Not as much as I might wish; but during the past few months he has changed greatly for the better." The girl still smiled, for she remembered the falsehood which the tavern-keeper had so recently told her host, when the latter had questioned him about card playing. At this moment the old maids  were heard singing in the next room, and the con- versation broke up, Lydia hastening to join them,    170      ROMANCE OF THE  out of curiosity; the Captain, because the spirit moved him to prayer, and he knew they were chant- ing something devotional. On opening the door, they found Miss Crabtree and Goody Garlic side by side, their backs to the fire, one of them beating  time with her forefinger, the other with her foot,  and both gazing at the ceiling, for they knew the words of the 1hymn by heart and only needed an-{ occasional glance at the page. Wadsworth im- ; mediately joined his voice to theirs, and its deep bass contrasted oddly with the shrill nasal tones of his aunt, who seemed to be trying to out- sing her friend, for she was gradually rising to a  higher and higher key. Presently her topknot commenced jerking back and forth-in another in- stant she was on her toes; then, after remaining thus about a minute, she ended the hymn with a shriek. "Practicing for next Sabbath," she exclaimed, when she had rested a moment to catch her breath,  and addressing Lydia, who, much to the regret of her old nurse, had remained a silent listener. "But 'taint a caution to my singing then; at meet- ing I'm glory all over, and you can hear me clear across Little river." Wlhen Miss Crabtree had commenced speaking the girl had buried her face in her hands, the tempt- ation to laugh being quite irresistible, and the dame   CHARTER OAK.       171 flattered herself that she was saying a prayer. But Wadsworth caught a glimpse of her eye, peeping between her fingers, and with an angry look he with- drew to his study, closing the door after him with a slam, before even Miles could pass through, and there he remained a full hour, as still as a mouse, at least his aunt's sharp ear was not able to detect the faintest sound within. At the end of that time the door opened, and he beckoned to the good woman, who immediately left the oven, where she had been setting a batch of bread, and advanced as far as the threshold; but there of course she halted. Imagine her astonishment, when he opened the door a little wider and bade her come in. "Can Joe be ill?" she thought, as she entered the forbidden chamber. "Verily, he has acted oddly to-day; I'm afraid fasting and hard study are turning his brain." After motioning her to a seat he took three or four turns up and down the room, then stopped, and asked what she thought of their young guest. "I like .Miss Lydia, exceedingly," replied the dame, "yes, I admire her ever so much, and my  old friend Prudence, who is down on fibbing, de- lares she's an angel. Why, the gal was up this morning soon after bell ringing; and when you  consider tlat she had a right to lie abed, I call that j smart. Then too, she's comely; nay more, she's    172       ROMANCE OF THE  uncommon fine looking; there ain't another pair of eyes like hers in all Hartford. But I guess, Joe, you discovered that yourself a'fore you asked her to ride out with you." This was a home thrust, and with the color rising to his face, Wadsworth took another stride up and down the apartment.  ( But has she the spirit of Godliness?" he exclaimed, stopping and giving his aunt a searching look. "Is she not given to levity at moments when she ought to be serious?" "Well, she's not quite as sedate as I would like, and this morning was not very attentive at Bible- reading; but then, Joe, that was the fault of your , 'shadow.' As for her curls, they're a scandal I ad- mit; but 'll make her cut 'em off afore the sun goes down. And yet, Joe, I hate to have 'em  thrown away; are they not beautiful?" "Aunt, I did not summon you here, for the pur- pose of talling about Miss Lydia's beauty; what is that to me? Curls lead to vanity, and vanity destroyeth godliness, even as rust eateth into iron. Yea, aunt, cut them off before it is too late. Always meet the Devil on the threshold, never give him an inch." I:will, Joe, I will; but pray go on and tell me what you have to say; my bread will all be spoilt if you don't hurry."             ' "I wish!to inform you, aunt, that the girl is go-   CHARTER OAK.       173 ing to stay with us longer than you imagine. I have invited her father to come and make this his home." "Indeed! good, good! yes, he can be concealed here as well as in the -forest." "Ha! then you know the secret? pray who told you, aunt?" "My friend, Prudence, but it was in strict con- fidence; no harm, however, in repeating it to you, Joe!"' "Well, for goodness' sake don't let it go any farther. When the regicide passes under my roof, let him be as one dead. Oh, what pity it is that Indian lad knows it." "But he doesn't; my friend says he has only a vague notion that the old gentleman was banished from the settlement for some cause or other, he does not know what, and has never asked; while both Prudence and Miss Lydia think he can be implicitly trusted." "I hope they may be right," sighed Wadsworth, "I fear however that if the Pequot comes in con- tact with others of his race, he may be seduced by the presents which Andros is distributing amongst them. Already Sir Edmund has persuaded the Mohawks to make peace with the French, toward, -whom, like his royal master; he seems very partial. Indeed, I am convinced, that at heart, his Excel-   174      ROMANCE OF THE lency is no Protestant, and if he dared would make us all slaves to Rome." "Well, Joe, what you say may be true, but I'd rather you'd not trouble yourself so much about it. Get Ajldros, the French and King James out of your .head, and you'll sleep sounder at night. But before I go back to the oven let me ask when Colonel Goffe may be expected?" "Mad Adams has orders to bring him here as soon as possible." "Indeed! Oh, Joe, I am so glad, let's keep it; a complete surprise. Oh, how delighted Miss Lydia will be, and if she isn't completely won over by your kindness, then she ain't the gal I take her for.". As the aunt said this, Wadsworth motioned her to leave. "-Why, Joe, you look displeased," she continued. "I tell you Miss Lydia can't help but love you, when she sees you acting so towards her father. And now before I do go out of this room, let me beg you to have a husking party. Let it be the grandest ever given in Hartford; you have the largest house and barn, and dear knows how many barrels of nuts, and more cider' than you can drink in a life time, unless others help you. Promise now that you'll give a husking party, as -soon as Colonel Goffe arrives. Of course he won't be able to show himself at the festivity, but his daughter   CHASRTER UAK. OL I  will mingle freely among the guests, and shine above all the other maidens present'; every body will envy you, and won't I be proud, Joe-oh, won't After a pause, which was quite inexplicable to Miss Crabtree, Wadsworth consented, and promising that he would make the occasion as jovial as he possibly could, he a second time motioned her to leave. With a countenance beaming with smiles, Charity followed the direction of his finger, and as she went back to the oven, Goody Garlic slipped her arm around her waist and asked what she wa's so glad about? "Tell me," she whispered. "I won't tell a soul!" ( By-and-by," answered Miss Crabtree. "Oh, it's a great secret." All the rest of the afternoon, Lydia passed seated at the window, reading the poems of Ann Brad- street; and sorry was she when at length it grew too dark for her to see the enchanting page. She then closed the volume, and leaning back in her chair, gave herself up to reverie. She wondered what her father might be doing at that hour. "Per- haps," she said " he's thinking of me and wishing I were with him." But the log cabin, where so many of her years had been spent, did not, like most homes, inspire her with pleasant memories. It pre-   176      ROMANCE OF THE sented itself to her mind as a gloomy abodPo tile monotony of which would have been unendurable, but that her parent inhabited it. Since she had come to Hartford, the world seemed to have grown larger. There was no longer any forest to bound her vision, she was dwelling in the midst of news; -Boston was much nearer, so was Sir Edmund Andros, and as she thought of him, she wished she had been born a man, that she might have lent her aid to strike for independence. Then her thoughts turned to the mysterious map which she had seen on Wadsworth's table, and she wished that she had one like it to show to her father. "He might then agree with me," she said, "about the future of America. He would see that the Republic, as the Charter of Connecticut foreshadows, will extend on the west even to the Pacific Ocean.' At last she reflected on how brief her stay in the settlement was going to be ; the wilderness would soon close round her again; she would go back to her Bible and Pilgrim's Progress, and have only the occasional visits of Mad Adams to enliven her. No matter what stirring events might happen, in the log cabin all would be quiet and monotony. 'Heretofore her spirit had found a balm in constant work; the spindle and distaff, the poultry, attending to her little dairy had partly smothered her restlessness.   CHARTER OAK.       1" Could she go back and feel resigned to her solitary fate? "Oh yes," she said to herself, not however with- out a sigh, "I can bear it for father's sake." Then she prayed that God might let her forget the scene of yesterday in the forest. To keep green the memory of the handsome stranger who had rescued her from the wolves, would be a never-ending pain. It was a glorious vision which would never return. But even as she prayed to forget him, his face seemed to rise up before her, and to escape it she turned and gazed at the embers on the hearth. But lo! there it was again; nor did it vanish until Miss Crabtree threw on a fresh armful of hickory. At this moment Wadsworth emerged from his study, clad in his deerskin jacket and heavy top boots, and after whispering a word to his aunt, left the house, followed of course by his shadow. ,( Joe, Joe," murmured the old lady, as the door closed behind him, "what a restless being you are! You'll pass half the night trying to find out what became of those strangers. Why can't you wait until to-morrow?"But the Captain thought otherwise. He was not the man to abandon any clew which might lead to the discovery of Sir Ed- mund's plans, just for the sake of a quiet evening at home. If Andros flattered himself it would be an easy   178      ROMANCE OF oTHE matter to rob the people of their charter, Joseph Wadsworth would teach him a rude lesson. This evening while he was yet out on his reconnoissance, an angry scene took place inthe bed room occupied by Goody Garlic and Lydia. But we need not dwell upon it. The girl finally yielded, not how- ever to the cross looks of Miss Crabtree, but to the soft entreaties of her old nurse. "It will be all for the best," said the latter, pat- ting her shoulder, "Yes, all for the best. Curls are forbidden, and surely you'll not let vanity stand in the way of obedience to our laws, which have been inspired by the Almighty." And so the regicide's daughter, after some resis- tance, was pushed by the good-wife into the ancient chair in which more than one Wadsworth had breathed his last, and for about five minutes no- thing was heard in that frosty apartment but the clipping of scissors; and when the work was ac- complished, Prudence gave the girl a kiss, while Miss Crabtree, filling her apron with the golden spoils, hastened down to the roaring fire, which in an instant swallowed them up.  I]   'HARTER OAK.      179 CHAPTEET  XII. IT was exactly midnight when Wadsworth .came home, feeling cold and not in the best of moods, by which his aunt, who had not yet retired, judged that he had been unsuccessful in the object of- his ex- pedition, and when she asked what he had dis- covered regarding the strangers, he shook his head, and answered, "very little." Then after warming his hands, he went on to tell her that the stranger whom he had left at the inn, had passed the night there. "His comrade," he added, " who was doubt- less a bearer of dispatches from Andros to Governor Treat, I traced to Mr. Clark's house; they both de- parted at daybreak." With this he opened the door of his study, and urged his aunt not to sit up any longer. "You must be tired," he said, '- waiting for me."           ! "Well I do need repose," answered the good woman, " but not half so much as yourself, who rack your brains from morning to night, whereas I only labor with my hands. Oh, Joe! go to your couch too. How can you help looking pale and haggard, when you don't take enough sleep?" But although she remained solme minutes at the foot of the staircase, entreating him, he refused to follow her example and she went up alone, saying   180      ROMANCE OF' THE as she had often done before, "what a strange, strange being!"From this hour until bell-ringing, the house was silent; every body slept except Wads- worth, for whom this ,night was to be the most trying in his life. During his solitary walk through the town, he had pondered seriously his late con- duct, and had persuaded himself that it would bring down on him the vengeance of God; and this belief had so excited him, that sleep was now impossible. As soon, therefore, as the library door closed, he extinguished his candle and falling on his knees, began to pray. He beat his breast and implored the Almighty to pardon him for what he had done. Six years had passed since he had made a vow never to marry, hoping that the Lord, in return for such a sacrifice, would help him achieve the independence of the colonies. It was a strange vow, yet in keeping with those strange fanatical times. Now, had he not broken it, at least in spirit? Had not a maiden whom he had known but a single day caused him to fall? Tears rolled down his cheeks as he reflected on his weakness, and in this cold, pitch-dark chamber, he remained hour after hour praying with all the fervor of his soul. Over and over again he repeated the psalm O Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried day and night be. fore Thee. Let my prayer come before Thee, incline Tbine ear unto my cry.   CHARTER OAK.        181 For my soul is full of trouble, and my life draweth nigh unto tihe grave. I am counted with them that go down into the pit, I am a man that hath no strength. Free amoung the dead like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more ; and they are cut off from Thy hand Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit-in darkness-in the deeps. Nor did lie rise from his knees until the watch- man's bell warned him that it was daybreak. He then got up, feeling renewed strength of will, and mnore determined than ever to trample his passion under. foot--he even smiled, so confident was he of victory. Then lighting his candle, he went into the other room, where he busied himself making the fire, and he was thus occupied when his aunt came down. The very first thing the loving woman did was to scan his countenance. "AAh Joe!" she exclaimed, "I don't call that being kind to me. One might suppose you had seen a ghost, you look so pale; I'll engage, yon bavn't closed your eyes since I left you, five hours ago. If you fall sick and die, what would become of poor Charity Crabtree? Oh, my boy, do not trifle with your health; cease your fasting and vigils; turn over a new leaf and marry, yes, that is my solemn advice. It makes you start, but I repeat it, marry. A wife is the only thing thlat will soothe your troubled spirit, and make you cheerful and contented."   182      ROMANCE OF THE It would be impossible to describe the feelings of the Captain, as these words sounded on his ear; his first impulse was to drop the stick of wood he was carrying and rush back into his sanctum.- - But just at that moment, Lydia came tripping down the staircase, and recognizing her footstep, he muttered a prayer and boldly turned to meet her. She was changed since the evening before; every curl had disappeared, and yet she really seemed more be- witching than ever. Her joyous countenance- pen- etrated like a flood of light into his gloomy soul, and made his heart beat quicker. Ah! it was a hard trial, but he did not give way; he remembered the solemn vow he had nade. His aunt fancied that his ,-xpression was less austere than usual, as he bade the girl good morning; she flattered her- self he was taking her advice, and about to turn over a new leaf. Alas, she was catching at a straw. "That's right Joe, do be cheerful; remember what I told you a moment ago," she exclaimed, patting him on the back. Lydia had now advanced to within a few feet of him, and pulling an apple out of her pocket: "Captain," she said, with an arch smile, and a glance at her nurse who was following her, "Goody Garlic and . found this in our bed-room, and have   CUHARTE1t OAK.      15; had a dispute about it. I say it's a pippin, she says it is not; now, which of us is right?" At once her host threw down his stick of wood, and bent forward to examine the fruit. In a calmer momentl-he might have decided the question, but in the presence of the tempter his eyes wandered from the apple to the little white hand which held it, then of a sudden averting his face, he folded his arms and murmured something which neither Lydia nor. the old maid understood. "Well, answer my question," she continued, laugh ing. "My aunt can decide that trifling matter, I have other things-to to ink about," he replied, turning slowly 'towards her again. Such- a remark from her host astonished the girl. "I'm sure," she thought, as she withdrew to one of the seats in the chimney, " the stranger I met in the forest would not have spoken to me thus. What have I done to offend?" "Joe!" said Miss Crabtree, looking reproachfully at him, "Joe, Joe!"But Wadsworth turned a deaf ear to her words; he felt conscious of having done 'what was right, and with the air of- one who has triumphed, he took down the Bible from the shelf, and tapping it with his knuckles, gave the signal for prayers. Now, it happened that the part of the scripture /   184      ROMANCE OF THE he was to read -this morning was the 29th chlapter of Genesis, wherein is related how Jacob fell in love with the beautiful Rachel; and as he went on read- ing, his aunt, instead of bowing her head, eyed him closely; then as soon as he had finished, she ap- proached, and with her mouth to his ear, "Joe," she whispered, " the godly men of old took wives, why don't you follow their example? what ails you that you hesitate? If you want to please me, keep. straight on until you've won her." Without making any reply he seated himself at table, and the meal which followed was the quietest Lydia had known since she had come under his roof. He did not speak a word, nor hardly even eat a mouthful, and when it was over he did not light his pipe; as was his habit, but began pacing up and down the room, his hands behind hm, evi- dently absorbed in meditation, while Lvdia helped Miss Crabtree and the servant put away the cups and dishes. Such a proof of an industrious spirit pleased Charity beyond everything, and going up to her nephew, she again whispered: "Joe, MAiss Lydia would be a sunbeam; she'd drive away the cloud which hangs over your soul; tain't natural to be a bachelor; one gets sour and morbid; she thinks as you do about Independence; why don't you go ahead and win her?" ' A great end requires a great sacrifice," he re-   CHARTER OAK.       185 plied,- turning from her and resuming his walk. These words sorely troubled the old lady, who now lhad little doubt that his mind was becoming affect- ed, and she gave such a sigh that Prudence won- dered what could be the matter.      . At length the last cup was put back in its place and Lydia gazed around to see what else was to be done. But Miss Crabtree, who had read her thoughts, told her she should not do another stitch of work as long as she remained in the house. "Go," she said, " and enjoy yourself in the li- brary; I know you're fond of books." "So I am," said Lydia, "an-d there is' a map there which I would like to examine again. May I go?" here she turned towards Wadsworth. "Certainly," replied the latter. Then, after a pause, and to her regret, he added that he would accompany her. The victory which he had achiev- ed over himself had given himn renewed confidence in his strength, and he no longer feared to be alone with this fascinating creature. "She shall not, if I can prevent it, remain out of the fold," he said to himself. "I will give her the Assembly Catechism to read, and if she feels disposed to listen, I will endeavor to change her views about stocks and whipping-posts." As soon as the door' closed behind them, Charity gave Prudence a wink, and at the same time ex-   186      ROMANCE OF THE claimed: "What a precious flower she is! Oh, if  you only knew how happy she'll soon be." "Without her father?" said Prudence, " impos- 'sible! Although she laughs and talks cheerfully enough, I know she is anxious to return to the log cabin, where she'd be willing to pass all her days unmarried, and among wolves and panthers, just for his sake; and ere this week is out, she'll be begging me to go back." "Well, the Lord will bless her for keeping the fifth commandment. Oh, Prudence, if you only knew something!" "Knew what? :Do speak plain!'i Her friend paused ;a moment. "Well, I don't suppose there's any,-harm in telling you," she whispered, "but remember, dear, it's in the strict- est confidence; and you musn't breathe a word of it to anybody." "Not a syllable, Charity, not a syllable." "Well, then, her stay here is to be a happy one: Colonel Goffe is coming -to live with us. Ah! this news astonishes you; but it's true as Gospel; I get it from Joe." "Oh, my, my! The child'll jump as high as the ceiling," cried Goody Garlic. "Pray, when may we expect the old gentleman?" "To-morrow, if this fine weather holds; Adams   CHABTER OAK.       187 was advised to bring him down the river as soon as possible." a   Let us now leave them talking together, and fol- low Wadsworth and his young guest into the next O01roo.  As soon as Lydia had seated herself, the Captain took the. Assembly Catechism off the shelf, and in a tone of authority bade her read with him a few pages. . "Why, sir," she exclaimed, "I'm not yet through with Ann Bradstreet's poems, and when I am, there ale other volumes. in your collection more interest- inig than that one, which, from what I have seen of it, appears dry and stupid." At these words her host groaned, but -mastering his indignation, he went on urging her to peruse it. "Will it do me any good,' sir?" she asked, with a roguish smile. "Yes, Miss, the greatest good. Tell me, are you at peace here? Is your soul at ease?"As he spoke he placed his hand upon his breast. Lydia laughed. "My soul, sir, has never given me the least trouble-I say my prayers every night before going to bed--I sleep soundly--always have pleasant dreams; in the morning I pray again; as for my appetite, it could not be better, while melancholy is a thing I know nothing about. How- ever, to please you, I will read the book."   188  -OMA(TE OP THE "It would please me very much, for it is the bounden duty of every one who has owned the covenant to bring into the fold those who are out of it." "Thanks, sir, for the interest you take in my welfare." Then after a pause, "I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Wadsworth, I'll promise to study the catechism from beginning to end, if you'll only let me off from it now, and give me instead an oral instruction in church matters; and when you have done that, you might go on and tell me something about the government of these colonies, for Adanms has never gone into details, and I have been left a great deal to my imagination." "I will," he said, placing the catechism in her hand; " but as you value my feelings, never again call this a dry and stupid volume." The girl nodded, and her host folding his arms and leaning against the table, thus began: "I will first inform you, that the people of [Hartfordt have not always enjoyed harmony in religious matters. In the year 1670, we divided on the question of baptism, and the consequence was the erection of a second house of worship, namely, that large edifice on the south side of Little river; and as the laws of Connecticut declare that dissenters from the Congregational order, provided they are orthodox on the fundamentals of Christianity, may live and   CHARTER OAK.         189 worship undisturbed, I would not marvel if before long' there  were  other divisions.   To form  a church, Miss, it is necessary that a certain number of people assemble and draw    up a covenant to which they promise adlierance.   Let me read you a copy of ours: "In the name of our Lord God, and in obediance to His holy will and divine ordinances, we, whose names are here written, being by His most W^ise and good Providence brought together, and desirous to unite ourselves into one congregation or church, under our Lord Jesus Christ, our Head, in such sort as becomet h all those whom He hath redeemed and sanctified unto himself:- do hereby solemnly and religiously, as in His most hely presence, promise and bind ourselves to walk in all our ways, according to the rules of the gospel; and in all sincere conformity to His holy ordinances, and in mutual love and respect to each other, so near as God will give us grace." (Each church," he continued, "has a pastor chosen 1 by the people, whose. duty it is to break the flinty heart by his exhortations; then we have a teacher, on whom it rests to explain and defend the doc- trines of Christianity and to prepare the young for church fellowship; we have a Ruling Elder who goeth from house to house like a good angel, keep- ing watch over the brethren and sisters-and let me say that Israel Barebones, widely as he    differs from me in regard to revolution and independence, is a model Ruling Elder. Lastly, there are two Deacons, whose duty it is to provide for the poor of the parish and manage its secular affairs.   A woman may hold this office.    The Church of the   190      ROMANCE OF THE Pilgrims at Amsterdam, before they emigrated, had a deaconess. I will also inform you that we hold the right of disciplining our members without the interference of the General Court or of a synod. As for episcopacy, from the independent spirit of - our people, I venture to predict, it will never take root amongst us." Here he paused a moment, per- haps in order to give his guest time to digest what he had been saying, then went on: "The salary,. of the pastor of the first meeting-house, where auut and I worship, is sixty pounds a year, two-thirds of which is paid in provisions and--" here another pause, for on glancing at the girl, he found her eyes fastened upon the map, which interested her now even more than the first time she had seen it. The great lakes, of which she. had never yet heard any one speak, filled her with wonder; so did the Mississippi, the Missouri, the South Sea, which was to bound the future republic on the west. She carefully noted the different settlements scattered at unequal distances from each other, between the Penobscot and the Hudson-about midway, closely grouped together, at the extremities of the rugged coast line further apart, and with tide-water reaching nearly a ll of them; while the surrounding and intervening country had been dotted by the mys- terious hand which had drawn the chart with arrow heads, "as a sign," she thought, "that Indians   CHARTER OAK.       191 roamed over it." Yes, all this interested her far more than church matters. "I will say nothing further about our religious organization," resumed the Cap tAn, slightly frown- ing; "I hope you have been paying attention, but from the direction of your eyes, I fear your interest has not been much excited." "Oh, I beg pardon, sir, my ears do not always. follow my eyes," answered Lydia, " but since you have done talking of the Church, please tell me something about our Civil Government, which 1  have heard you remark is closely bound up with it." "With pleasure, Miss, with pleasure; only you must pay attention. To begin, let me inform you that the charter granted to this colony, in 1662, leaves us free to make all our own laws, except such as are contrary to the laws and statutes of the realm of England; nor does the instrument even enjoin us to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy, although two assistants were empower- ed to administer it. Being thus left to manage our local affairs, until recently, when, as you know, Andros has undertaken to rule us, we have gone far ahead of Europe in self government. The unit of our political system is the township, which draws its vitality direct from the people, who, without any ceremony, come together to discuss public matters;   192       ROMANCE OF THE and the freemen consider it a home duty to be present at town meetings. The administrative power of the township is vested ch;efly in a small number of persons, called selectmen, which name originated as follows: In 1639 the Reverend Mr. Davenport directed the brethern who were forming themselves into a church at New Haven, to select eleven of the most godly men, as a nomination for Church pillars, that there might be no blemish in Church work. These were to choose seven among themselves, because the Proverb tells us,' Wisdom hath hewn out her seven pillars.' Now, our civil and ecclesiastical affairs being so closely united, we have-not hesitated to apply the same distinctive appellation to a civil officer of the community. The selectmen alone have the right to call a town meet- ing, but if ten voters demand one they cannot re- fuse. We -also have constables to keep the peace; a town clerk, whose business it is to record town notes, grants, births, marriages, deaths; an as- sessor, who rates the township; a collector, who receives the rate; a treasurer, who keeps the funds; a road-surveyor; a timber measurer; a sealer of weights and measures; fire wards, who direct what to do in case of a fire; one or more fence viewers, and several other officials, all chosen by the free- men, and any one refusing to accept office is punished by a fine of forty shillings."   CJHAtLTERi UOA.      i-.u Lvdia, whose attention had been closely riveted on the speaker, here exclaimed, " how interesting!" Wadsworth gave an approving nod, then con- tinued: "After the township, the county was formed; but as it is merely a territorial divi- sion without any political existence, and simply in- tended for the better administration of justice, I Vwill go on and speak of the commonwealth. Our charter ordaineth that twice a year, namely, in May and October, the people shall have a chance of ex- pressing their will as a community, through repre- sentatives in an Assembly, or as it is sometimes called, a General Court. This consists, of the Governor, Deputy Governor, assistants and depu- ties; twelve of the former, elected by the people at large, while the latter are chosen by the towns, three from each. With us, the two branches of the Legislature act together and are not yet divided, as in the other colonies, into separate houses. At elections, Miss, we use beans and Indian corn; the corn signifying an affirmative vote, beans the con- trary, while to enjoy the franchise it is necessary to be twenty-one years of age, own real estate to the amount of twenty pounds, and be recommended to the General Court -by the selectmen, as honest, peaceable, and of civil conversation." "Oh, how interesting," again said Lydia. "Why, i .Wy'   ROMANCE OF THE Mr. Wadsworth, it seems we already enjoy almost perfect liberty." "We do, and hence the King has taken the alarm and sent over Andros to clip our wings, lest we fly away altogether. But now, let me go on and speak of something which is full as dear to me as my native colony. I mean the Union. You must know that as long ago as 1637, Connecticut proposed to the other Plantations that they should form a confederacy, the chief object of :hich, should be greater security against Indians. Six years later, commissioners met from New- Haven, Plymouth, Massachusetts and Connecticut, and agreed upon certain articles of union. We were to be called the United Colonies of New England; and two freemen from each Plantation were to be appointed to look after the general defence, and such matters as concerned all." Here Wadsworth opened the table drawer, and taking out a sheet of paper, read the following words of the Preamble to the articles of Confederation: " We, therefore, do conceive it our bounden duty without delay, to en- ter -into a present consociation among ourselves, for mutual health and strength in all our future concernments, that as in nation and in religion, so in other respects, we be and continue One." "This," said he, " I often read over to myself, for it inspires me with hope. The old confederation was dissolved   by the absorption of New Haven into Connecticut, but it was revived, in 1672, by Massachusetts, Con- necticut and Plymouth, and still exists, and with God's help will prove the germ of something great- er. I regret, however, that the people do not take the same interest in it which they formerly did, the Commissioners of. the United Colonies not hav- ing met since September, 1684. But, thank God, Sir Edmund Andros has arrived! He will wake us up, and light with his own hand the fire of inde- pendence." "Yes, yes, he will," cried Lydia with enthusiasm. "But pray, how happens it that this colony," turn- ing to the map, and placing her finger on Rhode Island, "does not belong to the confederation ?" "Because, its people, always hard-hearted and conceited, preferred to be by themselves.  I never liked them. For years they have tried to quarrel with Connecticut about the Narragansett country, over which they wrongfully claim jurisdic- tion. I trust, however, that when the eleventh hour comes, Rhode Island will not be found want- ing. Why, even in Maryland, Virginia, and down in the Carolinas ,where, last autumn, I dispatched Adams to obtain information as to the temper of the people, there are brave hearts willing to join with us in striking for independence. There is only one thing I fear, namely, that England will depose   196      ROMANCE OF THE King James and place a more liberal monarch on the throne. That might spoil my game, for the freemen would then care less about separating from the mother country." "But the seed which you have sown would not perish," said Lydia; "if your dream be not real- ized in this generation, it will in the next." "When I am under ground," sighed Wadsworth; "oh, life is too short." "It is, sir, it is ; and how fast the years fly." A look, inexpressibly sad, now stole over the countenance of her host, who, for several minutes did not open his lips; then glancing at his watch he remarked that it was almost noon. "Another day half gone," he exclaimed. "Yes," said Lydia, "another day half gone. In a short while I will be with dear father again. But never will I forget this morning's conversation, and I shall look for the visits of Mad Adams with greater impatience than ever." Had she known the joyful surprise which was in store for her, we believe, with Goody Garlic, that she would have jumped as high as the ceiling. "It must be near dinner time," she went on, rising from her chair, ".Yes, it is.- But before we go into the other room let me talk to vou a little about stocks and &'   CHARTER OAK.       197 whipping-posts, which you seem to view with so much horror." Drawing back a step, Lydia eyed him a moment with a saucy air, then with emphasis, "talk," she said, "to my aunt about such things; I would rather not trouble my head with them." "She's paying me back for my gruff behavior this morning," thought Wadsworth; " but I'll persevere and on another occasion will broach the subject, a being like her must not go astray." "But before I take another meal," continued Lydia, in a firm voice, and as if she expected some opposition, "I want to sweep this room." To her surprise, her host shrugged his shoulders and walked towards the door; then with his hand upon the knob, he turned, and gave her a look, the meaning of which she could not fathom -while his eyebrows lowered, there was something in his expression almost pathetic. "You may stay away twenty minutes," she con- tinued, still assuming an air of authority; "now go." He obeyed, and as he passed out, the girl made a sign to Goody Garlic, who quickly slipped her the broom. No sooner did Miss Crabtree hear her n ephew's step, than she turned from the fire where she was busy preparing a stew, and with a broad grin, clapped her greasy palm on his shoulder and   198      ROMANCE OF THE, told him that God would bless him for turning over a new leaf.' But Wadsworth's frown quickly dispelled her hopes. "Why tempt me, aunt?" he said, " to swerve from the path! why do you stand side by side with Beelzebub?" "Lord, Joe! what has come over you?" cried the good woman, who in her anxiety paid no heed to the presence of dame Garlic. "Are you possessed? Marry, my boy, marry; only a wife can save you." "All: flesh is -grass!" was his solemn response. "Would you-have me, for the sake of a woman, no matter how beautiful, jeopardize the glorious end I have in view?"Here his aunt turned from him and wiped away a tear. During the next twenty minutes he looked several times at his watch, and as he heard the broom at work he could not help grinding his teetlh; yes, it was dreadful to think of his- pens hidden in some out of the way place, the map rolled up and stowed dear knows 'where, per- haps in one of his boots, and every thing so arranged, that it would take at least a month to feel at home again in his sanctum. "Oh, woman, woman," he muttered, " if we could only do without you, but we cannot. I am like a piece of dough in the hands of this maiden, whom I have scarcely known forty-eight hours." At length the door opened, and Lydia with ,   CHARTER OAK.  -1l a smile invited him to enter and see what had been accomplished. She might have remained and accompanied him in his inspection, had not Miss Crabtree thrown her arms about her neck and pre- vented her. " "Oh, darling," whispered the aunt, "I cannot but think Providence has sent you here for a wise pur- pose; you mustn't mind any thing my Joe says to you; he's -not as cross as he looks, and his heart isn't what his tongue would make him out. You're a jewel, dear, a jewel and he knows it, and is going to make you jump for joy, in a day or two. Oh, Lydia, if Ljou only knew something!"' "Well,';,wlhat?" said the girl, puzzled by this remark. "Oh, it's a secret, I can't tell, but you'll jump for joy, you will, you will." Wadsworth in the meanwhile, had glided into his study, and was darting his eyes right and left, What a change, to be sure! The floor sprinkled with clean white sand, was a pleasure to look upon; the .cobwebs in the corners had all disappeared; the sword hanging above his boots was ever so much brighter; the map was still unrolled on the table; his papers neatly sorted, and the copy of the charter wheqre it had always been. In fact, there was no fault to be found. 1Moreover, the window gave a great deal more light, it being no longer fly-   200      ROMANCE OF THE blown, and as he gazed out and saw the hills be- yond the Connecticut, he wondered at his folly, in having for so many years deprived himself of this beautiful view. "This room was indeed a den," he said, "now it's a little paradise." Presently dinner was announced, and when Wadsworth came to the table, he looked so pleased that his aunt's top-knot could not keep still. Twice during the meal, he paid Lydia a compliment: he told her he would allow no other person but her to enter his library, and that she was the only woman he knew who could stow things away without hid- ing them. At all this the girl laughed and made merry; but her pride was none the less gratified to see this stern man bowing before her. She had not, however, been altogether pleased by Miss Crabtree's mysterious words, when the latter had thrown her arms around her neck. "If she means," thought Lydia, that I am to be made happy by his choosing me for his wife, -she'll find herself mistaken. I'd not leave father alone in the wilderness for the richest and greatest man in New England; this very week I'll go back to the log cabin." During the afternoon Miss Crabtree proposed that Wadsworth should take his guest another ride through the town. But to her disappointment he made no answer,   CHARTER OAK.       201 while the girl assured "them both, she would rather go a-foot, adding that Prudence Garlic had not as yet seen any thing of Hartford, and she wanted the latter to accompany them. Now, the goodwife could not a" second time plead headache, as an ex- cuse for remaining behind; so, after Charity had pulled her nephew's sleeve, and whispered a few words in his ear, they all started off together. They lad not proceeded many steps, however, before the aunt seized Dame Garlic by the arm and held her back, thus giving the Captain and the girl a chance to pass ahead. During the promenade, which ex- tended as far as Wyllys' hill, Miss Crabtree stopped at least a dozen times to chat with people, and whenever she did she would beckon to Lydia and introduce her as Prudence's niece; and it was evi- dent from the way the dame spoke that she took pride in showing off her young guest, whose tall, graceful figure and handsome countenance charmed every body. Once or twice the girl's heart throb- bed, as she fancied she caught a glimpse of the stranger whom she had met on her journey down the river, and who had left so deep. an impression upon her; but on a nearer view she was always disappointed. Miles kept with them as far- as Mr. Clark's house; there, however, he halted, and after giving his master a stare so peculiar and full of meaning, that Lydia was struck by it, and again   202      ROMANCE OF THE declared her belief that the creature had a soul, he passed through the gate, and in a moment was scratching at the door for admittance. Wadsworth did not call the dog back, but his face became sud- denly grave, while his aunt, who was close behind told him, if she had her way she would either whip the brute to death if it persisted in going there; "or else," lowering her voice, "I'd make Nancy take Miles back. It was an unlucky gift, Joe, and if you want. to please me and turn over a new leaf, you'll get rid of your ' shadow.'" CHAPTER  V111. NATHANIEL CLARK, who dwelt in the stone mansion, south of Little river, was the son of one of the early settlers- of Hartford. His father had belong- ed to a good family of Yorkshire, England, and in early life had held a position of trust under the government. But having married a lady without fortune, he had crossed the Atlantic and sought a new home in Connecticut, where land was to be had for nothing, and where it would cost far less to bring up his children than in the mother country. Here his wife had borne him four sons, of whom the eldest had been named Nathaniel, after him-   CHARTER OAK.       203 self; and all had been of agreeable dispositions, excepting the first born, who when yet a mere child had taken a strange delight in telling tales on his playmates, stoning his father's turkeys, and sousing the house cat in the water barrel. - So unruly did lie become, that no pedagogue was ever able to make him study, and he grew up without knowing how to write, while his reading was very imperfect. When in the course of years the emigrant's boys came to manhood, the present solid building was erected on the site of the log cabin where Mr. Clark had first dwelt, and he and his wife looked forward to spending under its roof many happy days.                  ! But one of those fearful visitations of small- pox, which, in that century, often ravaged New England, swept away the whole family, leaving only the oldest son. "How mysterious are the ways of Providence," was on the lips of every body, when they saw the least worthy spared and enjoy- ing all to himself, the fruit of his father's labor. Nathaniel's good fortune, however, did- not end here; it followed him in the matter of getting a wife, and among the maidens of Hartford he won the best, if not the most beautiful. Every 'one liked Nancy Briggs, and when the news flew round that she had accepted him, the whole town was amazed. But turning a deaf ear to all that was   204      ROMANCE Or THE said against her lover, she married him, and for a number of years no couple lived in greater har- mony. But at length Mr. Clark left off going to meeting on the sabbath, and openly avowed himself a be- liever in episcopacy. He even went so far as to ex- press a hope, that the King might use his authority to foster and protect Common Prayer worship; and wlien we consider that not another person in the community agreed with him, this open way of speaking proved him to be a man of no ordinary courage. His wife's entreaties were' of no avail; he not only refused to go to meeting himself but even did his best to prevent her doing so. In this however, he was not successful. But from thence- forth the good woman's life was very unhappy; and when she died, those who knew her best, said. it was of a broken heart. That,however, may have been only gossip ; let us do the widower the justice to declare that he spared no expense to make her funeral an imposing one, as the reader may judge from the following items : 1 barrel of Wine... ............. 6 8 0 2 barrels Cider .. .............. O 11 0 82 lbs. sugar................... 2  1 0 4 dozen pairs Gloves ........... 5 4 0 Moreover, when the earth was being shoveled upon her coffin, he knelt down and evinced every sign of grief. Soon after Mrs. Clark had passed to   CHARTER OAK.        205 a better world, a change quite unaccountable came over her only offspring, Nancy, then seventeen years of age. During her mother's life time, the young woman had always accompanied her to meeting on the Sabbath and lecture days; but now she began to absent herself, and the tithing man, whose duty it was to spy out those who stayed away, used to see her wandering on the outer edge of the green, or perhaps along the bank of the river, while the rest of the people were at prayer. "What ails the girl?" one would ask. "Beelzebub is working at her soul," would be the suggestive response of some other busy body. "Why does not Mr. Japheth make a complaint?" a third would say. '"Alas!" would be the ruling elder's exclamation, ( passing laws is easier than enforcing them ;" while Jacob Japheth, whenever he was spoken to on the subject, was sure to throw the blame on his blind beye. Little did the people know how it really stood with Nancy Clark; how, during her lonely walks on the Sabbath, she was praying more fer- vently than many who were at meeting,. and that it -was in obedience to her father's wishes that she separated herself from the congregation. Nor, after her mother's death, was she ever met at any husk- ing party or quilting, and the gossips were sorely put to it for a solution of her mysterious conduct   206      ROMANCE OF THE This one would whisper one thing, that another; while once they made so free as to ask Nancy what, had come over her; but she would not tell. Jacob Japheth, however, had an opinion of his own con- cerning the young woman, which he had imparted to nobody except Mrs. Japheth. The people had already talked enough about her, and he was not going to add his mite of gossip to theirs. "Yes," the tithing man would say to himself, "she's been jilted, and in spite of the way he bpats his breast at meeting, and sings the psalms, I don't like Captain Joe for it. He thinks he was never seen with his arm round her waist, two or three years ago, on Wylly's hill. Ha, ha! I hadn't any blind eye then, and there was a full moon shining." And so the gossips talked, but Nancy minded nought that they said about her; she did not even know that Mr. Japheth was secretly her friend. Throughout her father's correspondence with Ran- dolph and Dudley, the young woman had acted as his amanuensis, and governor Andros had alr'eady received more than one communication in her hand- writing. Often, while thus employed, she was tempted to speak out her mind and tell him she would no longer write- to those who were bent on destroying the liberties of New England. But every time the words had come to her lips her courage had failed, and so she had gone on writing,   CHARTER OAK.       207 letter after letter, until now she began to see the net which she had helped to weave, drawing closer and closer about her native colony. No man of course toils without an object; it was not pure and simple loyalty to his sovereign which caused Mr. Clark to place himself in opposition to the people of Hartford. No, he had an end in view which he was bent on reaching by fair means or foul. Little did Nancy dream that besides a for- tune for himself, he intended her to marry some- body with a title, at any rate a gentleman, of whom not a few had come over with the new governor; after which they might go and live in .England, instead,of among low-born Puritans. " lNow that the olc woman is dead," he would say to himself, as he paced back and forth in his room, meditating over his schemes, " the gir.'s career shall no longer be thwarted. I was too lenient when I permittted her to waste her days reading 'Cotton's-Milk for Babes,' and 'The Assembly Catechism;' those books have taken all the' spirit out of her. But that's over now, and I will infuse into her some of my own ambition." The morning after Lydia Goffe's arrival in the settlement, this unscrupulous man stood gazing out of his parlor window, e;idently in what, for him, was a very genial mood. But it was not the blue sky, nor the sunbeams streaming in upon him, nor   208      ROMANCE OF THE the rows of boxwood peeping above the snow, which filled his heart with gladness; there was no poetry in his nature, not the least. He was a hard, mat- ter-of-fact being, whose head would not have turned the tenth of an inch to view the- most sublime, scenery on earth. "That's a fine piece of land," he kept repeating, "a fine piece of land; too good to be devoted to the support of a school. Moreover, the town hald no right to dispose of it without asking leave of the only person in New England who now has the ayn and nay in such matters." Here he turned and walked to the other end of -the room, thein came back to the window. "But there's time enough, 'twill be six weeks yet before spring really opens; bluebirds can't deceive me, we'll have nore cold weather, and I wouldn't be able to plow the field now, even if I had the deed." Then rubbing his hands, "Ha,' ha!" he continued, "Captain Sylnnot ought to reach Boston to-morrow evening; he'll lay my petition before Sir Edmund and-ha, ha, ha! won't there be gnashing of teeth among Joe Wads- worth's party?" While he was thus rejoicing at the prospect which opened before him, a delicate, humble look- ing female entered and approached the window where he stood. "Isn't this glorious!" she exclaimed, leaning her   CHARTER OAK.       209 forehead against the glass, " how I love the sun-! I wish it would shine on me always, even when I'm dead; yes, father, give -me a sunny grave." Mr. Clark shrugged his shoulders and gazed at her with an expression, part of pity, part of wonder. 'Tis past eight o'clock, Nancy," he said, "I had to take breakfast without you; 'but then, it was after midnight when you retired; you were a good girl to sit up so late. You conversed well, and I think he fancied you; one of these days you'll have your reward. But, tell me, how did you like him?" "Well, certainly I could find no fault with his looks," she answered; " he is very handsotie." "Aye, nmy daughter, his long wavy hair is much more pleasing to the eye than the hideous, short- cropped locks of our people. But who do you thnk he is?" "Why, a British officer, of course; his uniform showed that, although before he took off his deer- skin coat, he was well disguised. Doubtless he holds a position under Andros; he spoke as if he knew his wife." "Quite right; Captain Synnot commands Sir Edmund's body guard, and came to Hartford for tho purpose of seeing how things look. He is no cant- ing Puritan, but a true member of the Church of England." Here Mr. Clark paused, and in-   210      RONANCE OF THE tently watched his daughter's countenance. But Nancy was still gazing at the blue sky, and seemed to pay very little heed to these last words. "You heard him relate his adventure in the forest?" he continued. "Yes, sir, 'twas the last thing our guest told be- fore I withdrew. Really, I am curious to. know who that girl was he rescued from the wolves."- "So am I; he spoke of her as being exceedingly beautiful." For another quarter of an hour Mr. Clark paced up and down the room, still keeping in very good humor. "Never mind," he soliloquized, "never mind, if my daughter hasn't a comely face she'll yet be the envy of them all. I will make myself so useful to his Excellency that he'll not be able to do without me, and whatever honors he showers on me, she will share." At length he stopped, and placing his forefinger on Nancy's shoulder, ' I suppose I need'nt caution you," he said, "not to repeat anything our visitor told us about Boston and Sir Edmund; be prudent and hold your tongue." "As you wish," she murmured, at the same time her breast heaved. "Come, come; do not speak as if you were afraid of me," exclaimed her father. "Alas, you have been spoilt by your early training. Why are   CHARTER OAK.      2" you not cheerful? Have you no enthusiasm, no ambition? I could swear I heard you sigh a mo- ment ago. Why, Nancy, think What your future may be! Captain Synnot is going to speak a good word for you to Lady Andros; that ought to make your heart glad." ' I was not aware, sir, I needed anything said in my behalf," replied the young woman. "Humph! you have your mother's obtuseness; well, I will speak plainer. I mean that her lady- ship shall know that I have a daughter, who is anxious to serve the government, and whom I am anxious to have married to somebody of rank." At these words the young woman turned and eyed her father with a gaze steadier than he believ- ed her capable of, while an indignant flush crim- soned her brow. She had long known the base part he was playing; how could she help but know it, since she herself had written all his letters. But that he should wish to drag her further along the path of infamy, and have her choose for a hus- band some retainer of Sir Edmund, was almost more than even her humble disposition could bear. But, alas, her timidity sealed her lips she knew her parent's temper, and so let another occasion go by, where she might have spoken out her mind for his good, perhaps, as well as her own. "Nancy," he resumed, after rather a long silence,   212      ROMANCE OF THE "you have played your part well thus far; only one thing is needed to make you perfect, and that is ambition. You are now twenty-three years of-- age, and have been wise enough to stay unmarried. There was a time when I feared Joseph Wadsworth was making an impression on you. You were right not to favor his suit, which, by the way, he had no right to begin without my leave. Help me now with all your heart and soul to better our position, and every man and woman in Hartford will look on you with envy." At the mention of Wadsworth's name, the young woman drew herself up, and with an expression which astonished her father, "He's far above us all," she cried, "far above us all." "What, Nancy! I thought you had long gotten over your school-girl love. Tut, tut, don't prate to me about his being noble and above us all; I won't hear it, silence." She obeyed, but despite his angry look the- tears came to her eyes. "Now don't be foolish," he continued, "I never saw you act in this way before. Come, dry your tears and I'll tell you what I saw a short while ago, as I stood at the gate. It was nothing else than the Captain of the train-band riding by with a pretty girl behind him on the pillion. True as gospel; and it was a sight which made me glad:   CHARTER OAK.      213 men of his stamp, with fire and brimstone under their eyebrows, born revolutionists need wives to keep them at home, contented with the plow and the harrow. But I fear it may be too late for any woman to stop Wadsworth; he has already com- promised himself, judging from a few words I heard Mad Adams drop at the taverff'last month. Oh, I must work hard, very hard indeed to thwart him, or the king will have to bid adieu to these colonies." Again Nancy's face brightened. "May the Lord strengthen him, may he keep true to his vow," she said to herself; " brave, noble Wadsworth, you will yet lead us to independence!" "I want you," resumed Mr. Clark, " to bear one thing in mind, that is, that you and I are in the same boat; we must sink or swim together. I for- give your moody conduct during the last half hour, your tears and the foolish way you spoke of my enemy, who must and shall be your enemy too; but you must wake up, and have more ambition. I desire you now to make the acquaintance of the girl whom I saw riding with Wadsworth; doubtless she will know much about his plans, and you will thus be doing a great service to your king, for which Heaven will bless you." "And my country despise me!" thought Nancy, folding her arms, and again looking boldly at her father. "Never! I'd sooner die!"   214      ROMANCE OF THE "You understand me, Miss," he concluded, "' therefore begin at once, I expect an early re- port." With this, he took up his hat and left the house, turning his steps in the direction of the field which he so much coveted. CHAPTER IX. IT was a clear, sun-shiny day, the fifth which Lydia had spent in Hartford, and the girl was seated by the window, thinking of how fond she had already become of the place; nothing was wanting to complete her happiness, but to have her father with her. "I cannot remain away from him much. longer," she said to herself; " no, I cannot." The hour was three in the afternoon, and since dinner she had, been studying the Assembly Catechism, for her host- had warned her, that he was going to examine her on it that evening; but its dry, uninteresting matter had ended in giving her a headache, and she could not bear to read another line. "I must go out for a walk," she said, " and this time without the goodwife, or Miss Crabtree. The latter tries to keep me always under her eye, she's a perfect cat; I do believe, she's   CHARTER OAK.    -   15b afraid some other man besides the Captain will speak to me." Now, this was pretty much the truth. But can we blame the aunt for wishing to secure to her nephew the possession of one so beautiful, and in every way so fitted to become his wife? The house was very quiet; Wadsworth was in his library, poring over a manuscript, which Doctor Mather had sent him from Boston; Miles, as usual, lay sleeping at his feet; while Prudence and her friend had not opened their lips for ever so long, being each deeply absorbed in the dther's dream-book. "If I had on my moccasins instead of these un- comfortable shoes," thought Lydia, "I might slip out without being noticed. I'll risk it, however," and if they do catch me, why what of it? I've a right to go when and where I please." A few minutes later she might have been seen gliding out, her scarlet cloak over her shoulders, and on her head a plain, sombre-colored hood. "If the Captain wants me to take a ride," she said, laughing, " he'll have to exercise his patience and wait till to-morrow. He's deep, and bold, and original, and there are many things about him which I admire, but somehow I cannot get to like him-too cold and mysterious, not enough senti- ment. If he wants me now, he'll have to chase, me. Ha, ha!"   216       OM ANCE OF THE Presently she found herself in Main street, which, as might have been expected on such a lovely afternoon, was crowded with people, girls and boys, grannies and ol'd men, farmers, storekeepers, and not a few hunters, with strings of wolves' ears slung across their shoulders, and all chatting pleasantly together. Nearly every dwelling had a sled stand- ing in front of it, some of the horses pawing the snow and neighing for their masters to come; others with heads down and ears drooping, as if they knew that they were only brutes, and that making a noise would not bring them back to their stables any the sooner. Lydia was quickly recognized by those to whom Miss Crabtree had introduced her, but instead of stopping to chat, she' preferred mere- ly to return their greeting, then hastened on to- wards the old pyramid-shaped meeting-house; for although she had several times visited it, she had not yet examined as thoroughly as she wished the graves which stood there, nor the stocks and whip- ping-post at the north-east corner of the green. When she arrived no culprit happened to be under- going sentence, so, walking up to the stocks, she endeavored to thrust her right hand through one of the holes. In this, however, she did not quite suc- ceed, but was pushing hard, when suddenly a voice, so lugubrious that you might have imagined it pro- ceeded from one of the graves behind her, exclaim    CHA RTEI OAK.       217 ed: "Iichly hast thou merited being placed there, Miss Garlic, but thy sin will be forgiven, for thou hast repented." We need hardly say that Lydia was startled, and looking round she beheld the tall, slender form of the ruling elder eyeing her from a little distance. "What do you mean, sir," she exclaimed, draw- ing herself up. "I mean, that thy curls were giving wide-spread scandal; but, thank the Lord, thou hast destroyed them. Therefore, I shall not dwell upon the subject further than to say, beware of Satan; he will dig many a pitfall in thy road to Zion," "Well, in spite of all his holes, you and I'll get there," exclaimed another voice, and glancing in the direction of the jail, Lydia saw the merry eye of Jacob Japheth, the tithing man, twinkling at her. "I watched you, Miss, trying to push your hand in the stocks, ha, ha, ha! you didn't get through, you didn't get through." Then drawing closer, and lowering his voice, "did you keep e'er a one of them flutterin' Jyon-know-whats? some folks thinu] they was a scandal; but some folks is grumpy by nature, and see the devil in every ringlet on a pretty girl's head. Why, Miss, when I said my prayers that evening, after I had seen you and Captain Joe riding past, them 'ere you-know-whats   218      ROMANCE OF THE was dancing afore me, so I could scarce keep my eye on the Bible; every line seemed to twists and uirl up like one of 'em." "A pretty tithingman, indeed!" exclaimed Lydia, laughing, and at the same time shaking his hand, "to let my poor curls give such distraction." "Well, I shall never forget 'em, and never ex- pect to behold the like again. But now, -to change the subject, what do you think of him?" As he put the question, Israel Barebones edged up closer and placed his hand to his ear. "Think of whom?" "Oh, you know, Miss; ain't he wise? ain't he original?" "Are you speaking of Mr. Wadsworth?" "Why, of course, and you may as well be frank about it; the cat's already out of the bag." "A most godly man," put in the ruling elder, "and I join brother Japheth in congratulating you; the Captain needs a wife to settle him down and keep him from brooding so much over the political condition of the country." "Yes, yes, a wife would give him other things to worry about," pursued the tithing man. "Well, really," exclaimed Lydia, blushing, yet, at the same time hardly able to repress a laugh, "methinks you are both making very free with a piece of impertinent gossip." * J                  Rosip   CHARTER OAK.       ' 219 "'Tis known by every body," rejoined Mr. Ja- pheth; "nothing else is talked about, and we're all so glad, for Captain Joe's a great favorite, and we want to see his name handed down. Yet   " here he stopped and shook his head. "It wasn't right," he murmured, " she was his first choice; no, it wasn't right; poor Nancy Clark!" ("And that's why he's getting up a husking party; the first he's given in years," said Mr. Barebones, not noticing the grave look of his friend. "A husking party? Strange I've heard nothing about it," said Lydia; "that shows what propor- tions gossip can take." "But it's true, I got it from good authority; per- haps he wants to keep it a secret, and so take you, Miss, by surprise." Here the regicide's daughter burst into a hearty laugh; tShen telling them that she could not lose any more time listening to their nonsense, betook herself to the rear of the meeting-house. She had been there only a short while examining the mounds without headstones, and wondering what poor strangers might be lying beneath, when her attention was drawn to a young woman ap- proaching from Main street, with a wreath of ever- green slung over her arm; her eyes were cast upon the ground, and her whole appearance was that;   220      ROMANCE OF THE of one familiar with care and sorrow. Presently she stopped at Mrs. Clark's grave, then -kneeling down, placed the wreath upon it. Lydia's feelings were moved, and walking up, she stood reverently by until Nancy had risen ; then, -witlhout waiting to introduce herself, she threw her arms about her neck and gave her a kiss. "I know we are strangers to one another," she said, in answer to the other's look of astonishment, "but that makes no difference, we shall be friends." -Always," said Nancy, who took in at a glance the fullness of Lydia's generous nature, " always." "Are you not Miss Clark?" pursued the regicide's daughter. "I am, and pray   ." Here she suddenly checked herself, for she had recognized in her new acquaintance the very person whom her father was desirous she should meet. "No," she murmured, "I will not even ask her name--I will not play the Spy.."  "I am staying at Mr. Wadsworth's," continued Lydia, " and  " "Yes, yes, I know it," said Nancy, interrupting her; "I saw you and him ride past my house a few days ago." With this the young- woman bowed her head, while the other wondered what she was thinking about, and why the expres- /          .     *   CHARTERa OARK.      221 sion of her face grew so sad. During the next minute, what thoughts passed through Nancy's mind, what memories were awakened! -the moon- light walks around Wyllys' hill; those hours of bliss which for her at least were never to return. Yet, not once had she blamed oWadsworth for his vow; no, not once. She had felt that by keeping him true to it she would be a sharer in his glory; the Lord would bless them both and give freedom to their native land. But what was this gossip now flying from mouth to mouth?"I do not believe it," she murmured, at the same time gazing affectionate- ly at Lydia ; " le pledged himself to the Ailighty never to marry; to swerve from his vow would jeopardize his soul; I will pray for him; yet I do not believe it-no, no." In Nancy's heart there entered not one spark of jealousy; if anything, she pitied Lydia. "Wads- worth," she said to herself, "is a man to be loved; he may allow himself to be carried away for awhile by my friend's beauty, but in the end, if she loves him, there is grief in store for her-he will keep his vow." Presently they took each other's hand and wend- ed their way among the graves, whose quaint epitaphs amused Lydia; while Nancy, as Wads- worth had already done, read aloud the inscription on the tomb of the Reverend Samuel Stone. They   222      ROMANCE OF THE then crossed the green and re-entered Main street, where they found the tithing man and the ruling elder talking to a group of people who stared as they went by, and from the way Mr. Barebones dropped his voice, Lydia felt certain she had been the subject of his remarks. "-An odd couple," she said. "Well, they are both a little peculiar," replied Nancy, " yet very good men. Israel Barebones is thought by some folks to be too scrupulous; night and day he worries about what others are doing, and it almost kills him when any body wanders out of the path of righteousness. Mr. Japheth in this respect is altogether different; he seems as if he couldn't frown or look gloomy if he tried, and lets folks do pretty much as they please. Yes, his blind eye is often the sinner's friend." "Well I prefer him a thousand times over!" ex- claimed Lydia; " give me sunshine and a cheerful face always; he reminds me of some one whom no doubt you know, for he lives in Hartford-Simon Adams."  "Know Mad Adams? I should thhink I did.--as good a fellow as ever breathed. He now keeps the Bunch of Grapes, and although 'tis his first season at the business, every body is satisfied with his management; no brawls occur there any more, while at nine. in the evening the tavern is closed /    CHARTER OAK.       223 As for gett ing il on the Sabbathll, you'd have to squeeze through the key hole." ;"I am glad he has a better way. of earning a livelihood then hunting wolves," said Lydia. "So am I; but I fear he won't stick to it; he has led such a wandering life that it is difficult for him to settle down. Indeed, I am afraid he's at this very moment off on one of his wild expeditions. He disappeaed a couple of weeks ago, trusting the Ordinary to a friend, and I hear he is not back yet, nor does any body seem to know which way he went. Alas! he cannot do without excitement." "Well, he is no fonder of it than my host, into whose soul this peaceful, monotonous life is eating like rust." "True ; but a day is coming when Wadsworth's patience and pains will be rewarded; wait till the drum beats to ars, then the world will know him!" Here Lydia glanced at the speaker, whose cheek I had suddenly become flushed with excitement, and as the girlwatcled her she remembered how the Captain othe trin-band, when she had ridden with him past M-r. Clark's house, had sighed and urged on his steed.' W'ath did it mean? What mystery was there between him and her friend? "But pray, where did you make Adam's acquain- tance?" said Nancy, her face once more resuming its habitual pallor.   224      ROMANCE OF THE "At my home, which he occasionally visits." "Oh, indeed!"With this the young woman changed the subject. Her natural curiosity might have prompted her to ask where Lydia's home was, but she had resolved to obtain no information, which her father by any cross-questioning might contrive to worm out of her. "How do you like the Captain's shadow?" she continued. "I mean his dog Miles." "As much as he likes me; we are already fast friends."' "Well, 'twas I gave him to Wadsworth." Here Nancy sighed. Just then they heard the sharp, joyous bark, which no otker dog'in town possessed, and looking round they spied Miles running to- wards them  as fast as he could. In another mo- ment he had reached them, then placing himself in front of Nancy he gave her one of his strange looks. "I do believe he's trying to speak," said Lydia. "Yes," replied her companion, " no other dumb animal ever stares at me in this way." "I suspect he was seeking you, not me," pur-t sued Lydia; " does he often leave his master?" "About once a month he comes to our house and scratches at the door till I let him in. He is an original." "Like the Captain," said Lydia. v ur :   ydU'EIVCBIIU)   CHARTER OAK.       225 "Yes, you're right. Mr. Wadsworth is different from other men. Oh, what a great soul! Alas  that he and father should be enemies!" "Well, that need not hinder you paying me a visit before I leave the settlement, and I'll certainly come to see you." Nancy shook her head. "In a few moments," she sighed, " we will reach my home, but I dare not invite you to enter it, since you are the guest of one whom he hates." "I will go in, however; I'm not afraid," answer- ed Lydia. "Surely, in your company Mr. Clark would not offer me an insult." "Well, as you like, but you must not take offence if I do not return the visit; I am no favorite with Miss Crabtree.'. Soon they were at the house, and as Nancy opened the door, a nervous feeling seized her. What if her father should be at home?"Suppose he questions me about my companion," she thought, "what can I .tell him? Will -he believe me when I say that I neither know who she is nor where she comes from?"The young woman determined, how- ever, rather to brave his anger than win the .confi- dence of Lydia, only to make a base use of what she might discover. The building which they entered was not as cold and gloomy as it appeared from the outside; on   226      ROMANCE OF THE the contrary, once across the threshold, it wore a, cheerful aspect. To the left of the hall was a. ca- pacious room with clean, whitewashed walls, andl no ears of corn, bunches of catnip, or pumpkilns dangling overhead, as in Wadsworth's abode. T1W chimney was smaller than that of Lydia's host, but a bright fire was burning on the hearth, nllld the desk and writing-table in the centre of the apartment showed that it was used both as a study and parlor. What first attracted the girl's atten- tion was a portrait of King Charles the First, a gift, as Nancy informed her, from President Dudley. But the regicide's daughter was not told, for her friend did not know it herself, that it was likewise a reward for a secret service which Mr. Clark had renderede the government. "But -come," exclaimed Nancy, seizing her arm, "come -up to my bed-room; I want to show you my flowers; Miles as you perceive has left our heels and is no doubt waiting for us there." Sure enough, on mounting the staircase, they found him lying on the mat before the door, thump- ing his tail as if he were keeping time to their foot- steps. The chamber into which Lydia was ushered was small and cozy, and the rays of the sun, whichi I were streaming in, gave it a warmth and cheerful- ness such as no artificial light can ever impart. By the window stood a few flower-pots, containingr   CHARTER OAK.       227, roses and geraniums, while in the corner near the fireplace (in which at this moment were only a few smouldering embers) lay a spindle and distaff. "These," said Nancy, affectionately resting her hand upon them, " were mother's." Presently her face brightened, and Lydia also smiled, for there, unceremoniously stretched upon the bed, its head resting on the pillow, like a human being, was the dog. "Happy creature!" she continued, " 'tis well I gave you away." "Why?" inquired Lydia. "Because, I'm unlucky; all my pets die." As she spoke the young woman's face again grew sad. "There was Cudjo, the dearest little dog that ever lived, I never knew what became of him; Dick, a pigeon, which used to follow me every where, was carried off by a hawk; then I had a colt, a lamb, and all, one after the other, just when I had got most attached to them, either died or left me. That is why I gave Miles away." "Well, at any rate, your flowers are blooming." "Yes, they are, the frost has not killed them yet; J doubt if any body has a mate for this," cutting off the loveliest rose and handing it to her friend, who after admiring it a moment, placed it in her breast, then turned toward the window. "Is not that the Oak on Wyllys' hill?" said   228      ROMANCE OF THE Lydia pointing at a large tree about a quarter of a mile off. "Yes, I call it my oak; 'tis dear knows how old." "So Mr. Wadsworth told me, and he said the Indians were exceedingly fond of it." "And the squirrels love it- too," continued Nancy r "I have seen a whole family of the little creatures basking at the mouth of the opening which you must have noticed near the roots; while the whippoorwills are heard there sooner than any where else, and the Captain is fond of sitting under the tree, spring evenings, on purpose to listen to them." "But they have such a mournful cry," said Lydia. "'Tis the very reason he likes them. Why, I've heard him say, the wind whistling among the leaf- less trees in winter, was the sweetest of music. Mr. Wadsworth is not like other men." They thus went on conversing about one thing and another, until Lydia perceived that the sun was almost on the horizon and that it was time for her to leave. "Prudence and Miss Crabtree must be worrying," she said, "to know what has become me." But before bidding good-bye there was a question she wanted very much to ask; it was the name of the stranger, whom   Wadsworth had traced here a few nights before, and who, she felt sure, was the same that had rescued her from the   CHARTER OAK.       229 wolves. Yet she hesitated, for she feared it might widen the breach between Nancy's parent and her host, if the former discovered that Wadsworth kept watch on those who entered his abode; so without mentioning the subject, she gave her friend an em- brace and departed. Nancy remained on .the porch, following her with her eyes, till long after she had passed through the little gate, and when finally she disappeared from view, the young woman still lingered there, while her thoughts turned upon Wadsworth. "If I did not know him so well," she said, "I might be tempted to believe the report which it spread through the town, that he is in love. No maid in Hartford can equal his young guest in beauty. Poor thing.! I hope she may not give him her heart, as I once did; for I know he will keep true to his vow, and in the end there is bitter grief in store for her."1 Presently Nancy bowed her head, and the tears trickled down her cheeks ; her fortitude and resigna- tion for once gave way.  "Wadsworth, Wads- worth!,' she sobbed; " those were happy hours we spent together on Wyllys' hill." At length she was startled by a low, melancholy whine, and glancing round, saw Miles looking up at her. "Why, poor fellow," she said patting him, "you were asleep when we left the room, and I forgot to   230      ROMANCE OF THE call you, poor, poor fellow." For about a minute the dog kept watching her; it did not bark nor wag its tail. Then slowly descending into the garden, it passed through the gate and followed in the direction which Lydia had taken. CHAPTER X. ON Lydia's return she found Prudence and Charity seated in front of the fire, each with a manuscript in her hand. "Well, that was a wonderful dream, to be sure," exclaimed the latter, as the door opened, and the girl walked in. The appearance of the truant im- mediately changed the current of the old maid's thoughts; and tossing back her head, she scowled at Lydia from beneath her spectacles. "M'iss," said the dame, after a pause, during which she had mentally prepared a series of questions, " where have you been?"At the same time Goody Garlic drew her darling towards her, and likewise asked her to give an account of ler- self, but in a soft, gentle voice, which was a sweet contrast to the jarring tones of the other. "I have been everywhere," answered Lydia, who had resolved to keep: nothing secret, "and a most charming time I have hadi"   UVJA12kl'd Ll . AL /   "- "Then you will have a great deal to tell us," pursued Miss Crabtree, " be open, now, and let us know all about your doings since you went out on the sly." "Well, I met many people, dame, but only spoke to a few; there was Jacob Japheth, the tithing man, Mr. Barebones, the ruling elder, and-" "Israel Barebones," interrupted Charity, "oh, he's a most godly man; you cannot but profit spiritually by having made his acquaintance; Mr. Japheth can't come within a mile of him in religion. But go on, who else did you meet." "Then I fell in' with a very agreeable young woman, Nancy Clark; 'twas she gave me this rose." Had Lydia, instead of placing her finger on the flower, torn it from her bosom and thrown it into Miss Crabtree's face, the countenance of the latter could hardly have assumed a more malignant ex- pression. The dream-book was crumpled up and thrust into her pocket and she tossed back her head so violently that her spectacles dropped off. "Nancy Clark, did you say?"But before she could proceed further, Lydia, with a saucy laugh, turned away and disappeared up the stair-case. "Pray what does all this mean?" exclaimed Goody Garlic, perplexed. "Has my child been making any improper acquaintance?"   232      ROMANCE OF THE "Yes, she has. Listen, -and you'll agree that I'm right. You must know, Prudence, that my nephewr was at one time smitten with this Nancy Clark. I don't think the fact was ever discovered by any one but myself, for their love-walks were always talen after dusk, and then it was not up and down Malin street they promenaded, but on the outskirts of the town; and very often they'd stroll to Wylly's hill, where they'd sit for hours, aye, till midnight, cooing like a pair of doves, under the large oak tree which stands there. Ha! Joe little thought my eye was following him! You see, I didn't take to the girl from the very first; why, I cannot tell, but I didn't like her; perhaps because she was homely, and meek, and not at all the kind of per- son. for my nephew. But I was not set completely against her, till one Sabbath evening about three months after he had begun making love. It hap- pened that I was coming home from a walk along the river, and had just reached the lane which passes by Wyllys' hill, when I saw Miss Clark ap- proaching; her hands were clasped together, her eyes bent on the ground; she was evidently greatly agitated. I at once slipped behind a hay-stack, for I didn't care about meeting her, and as she went past she was crying, and oh! in such a dole- ful voice, ' Wadsworth, Wadsworth! alone through life, alone!' I can hear her words even now rirg-   CHARTER OAK.       233 ing in my ears. Well, from that day the intimacy between them ceased; but Joe, instead of courting some other maiden, began to hold entirely aloof from woman's society; he has been since then to not a single husking party or bee, and from the strange way he acts, I believe there is some evil influence working upon him. One thing I know for sure, he views Nancy Clark as a being superior to any other on earth. In more ways than one he follows in her footsteps; both shun society, neither of them are married. Can you wonder at me for believing she has thrown a spell over him?" "Well, how does she otherwise conduct herself, is she an observer of the Sabbath?" "Far from it. Not once since the death of her mother, who was a most godly woman, has she placed her foot inside the meeting-house, and the only person she is intimate with is the widow Bull, a creature honey-combed with vanity, and who rarely attends divine worship herself. Oh, I wish the selectmen would listen to Mr. Barebones and- have a cage for sabbath breakers placed at the church door. Yes, the widow Bull ought to be in one, and so ought Nancy Clark. But tell me now, Prudence, are you astonished at my dislike of the new acquaintance your charge has made? Depend upon it, if Nancy be invited to our husking party; her evil eye will ruin Joe's chances of winning   234      ROMANCE OF THE Miss Lydia. However, I shan't ask her to come, and I'll do my best not to let Joe ask her either. Yet something tells me she'll be here, if only to keep the spell over him." "Too bad, too bad!" murmured the other, " we must keep a sharp look-out and not let the child grow too intimate. Miss Clark may have given herself to the devil and exert, as you suspect, a malicious influence over your nephew; what a pity, what a pity!" "Aye, what a pity," sighed Miss Crabtree : " he needs a genial mate, such as Lydia Goffe would make him, to drive away his gloominess." At this moment a scratch was heard at the outer door, and Charity exclaiming, "Oh, there he is! Miles often runs- ahead and asks for admittance," made haste to open it. But what was her surprise to find the " shadow," indeed, but not the master; and although she looked up and down the road, she could see nothing of Wadsworth. "It's queer," she said, " they went out in company, soon after we missed the girl; this has never happened before." On returning to the inner room, she again seated herself by the fire, but neither herself nor her friend resumed the perusal of their dream-books; they preferred to chat, while Miles, after warming himself at the hearth, left them, and joined Lydia   CHARTER OAK.       235 on the upper story. The regicide's daughter was at this moment looking at herself in a small mirror, which the old aunt, not without many scruples, had hung up on the wall. It would be untrue to say the girl did not regret the loss of her curls, and just as the dog placed his paw against her, she was wishing that she had them back. 'Ah, there you are again," she exclaimed, strok- ing the creature's head, "Nancy's pet as well as, mine." Miles wagged his tail and barked, then suddenly stopped, and turned up an ear as if he were listening. Lydia felt sure Wadsworth had arrived, and ex- pected to see the creature rush below; but it did not stir. Presently she heard a queer noise, which seemed to come from the garret, and while she was wondering if it might be caused by rats, off went Miles, up a narrow ladder which led into that part of the building. Lydia followed him, but by the time she reached the top, everything was quiet, and she found the dog snuffing at a hole, through which no doubt the vermin had disappeared. The light in this part of the house was always dim, but now, when the sun was below the horizon, it was necessary to walk with care, lest she should trip over the rubbish with which it was stored.' Her curiosity was awakened to find out what the things were which she touched with her hands and   236      ROMANCE OF THE feet; so going below, she presently returned with a lamp, determined to explore every nook and corner. But even with the light the shadows were but half dispelled, and the place seemed more weird than before. On one side stood a number of barrels, filled with walnuts and hickory nuts, while scattered here and there were discarded pieces of urniture, pots and kettles, with bottoms burned out through long use; brooms without handles; a cracked looking-glass; a rusty sickle; a broken churn, on the handle of which was stuck one of Miss Crabtree's night caps; a pair of worn-out boots, besides other odds and ends. She had fin- ished, as she believed, her examination of this an- cient lumber room, whose very atmosphere had something in it of the years long gone by, and was on the point of descending the ladder when her eye was attracted by a roll of parchment, which ill now had escaped her notice. At once she set the lamp on the floor, and opening the roll discover- ed, to her surprise, that it was the map of North America which she had seen on Wadsworth's table. "How did it find its way: here!" she thought. Then remembering what her host had said regard- ing its nlysterious origin, a feeling of awe crept over her, and hastily wrapping it up, she went be- low and hid it under her bed, intending to replace   CHARTER OAK.       237 [t in the study on the morrow. While she was musing over her strange discovery, Goody Garlic entered and told her the evening meal was ready, and that she must descend without delay.  "The Captain," she added, "has just come home,  tired out searching for you. Oh, child, what a fine, noble fellow he is! for his sake try and do nothing to irritate his aunt. If she'd rather you'd not as- sociate with the young woman whom you took such  a fancy to this afternoon, why, yield to her wishes ; there are many other persons to know and visit be- sides Miss Clark. Moreover, her father, I am told, hates Mr. Wadsworth, while Nancy herself nevei   : goes to meeting, and therefore cannot be a propelr  , companion for you. Now, try and please Miss    i: Crabtree in this matter, do."            ' Lydia shook her head, then taking up the lamp;  li! gave a parting look at herself in the glass.  "What a fool I was," she said, "to let her de- stroy my curls! But not content with that, the   ! dame would force me to visit only those whom she  likes. I'll show her I have a will of my own."    j Prudence was startled by this speech. Had her  charge already learnt so much of the world, the   ji flesh and the devil? Never before has she mani-  fested such a rebellious spirit; what does it mean?"  thought the ,dame, clasping her hands and gazing   i mournfully at the girl. "Alas! it all comes from  ,1 - iJ !t 4k   238,      ROMANCE OF THE that meeting in the forest; her very innocence renders her unconscious of when she doetli wrong. Aye! the kiss the stranger gave her, was the devil's entering wedge!" In another moment Lydia and the good wife were descending the staircase, the former deter- mined to spite Miss Crabtree by praising Nancy Clark whenever occasion might offer; the latter murmuring a prayer that her charge might be pro- tected from the Evil One. As soon as the girl appeared below, Wadsworth, who was standing with his back to the fire, smiled; while Charity, always rejoiced to see him shake off his gloominess, smiled too, and even went so far as to take a bone from the cupboard and throw it to Miles. The dog-was so astonished that at first it did not touch the gift; but presently recovering from its surprise, it carried the bone under the steps, where it began gnawing it, while the family sat down to supper. The conversation during the meal turned upon Lydia's recent walk ; but happily there sprang up a discussion between Wadsworth and his young guest, as to the respective merits of Mr. Japheth and Mr. Barebones, and this excluded every other topic, so that Nancy Clark was not once mentioned. Lydia maintained that the tith- ing man had the most christian face of the two. "If it's only," she said, "for his merry laugh and ,   CHARTER OAK.   .    239 twinkling eye, I like him the best; I hold that such persons find most favor with the Lord.." At this speech the Captain let drop his fork and knit his brow, while Charity felt like boxing her ears. Presently Wadsworth rejoined, and en- deavored to impress upon her the necessity of a grave deportment, which, he added, was a strong point with the ruling elder. And so they went on, till at length Lydia closed the argument by quoting a pet phrase of Mad Adams, namely, " that the Lord did not like a sour face;" whereupon ti;o Captain was fairly startled out of his seat, and be- taking himself to the door, stood there several minutes watching the heavens, while Goody Garlic so feared lest the aunt might take up her nephew's view of the question and perhaps try and force Lydia to hold her tongue, that she hastily pulled her dream-book from her pocket and skilfully succeeded in diverting her friend's thoughts. Prudence's interference was well-timed, for although Miss Crabtree in her heart agreed with Lydia, that smiles and laughter were excellent things, (and we know how she longed to have her Joe smile and laugh), yet the girl had clothed her ideas in lan- guage so unbecoming, and had given such offence by speaking irreverently of Mr. Barebones, that she was afraid her nephew might never get over it.   240      BOMANCE OF THE "It would be a good night for Adams to travel," thought the Captain, closing the door and returning to the hearth; " if I were sure they were on the way I'd go meet them." Then seating himself next to his young guest, he asked if she were ready to recite her lesson in the catechism. Lydia nod- ded, then passed him the book, after which, for about a quarter of an hour, nothing was heard but the deep, earnest voice of her host, putting the questions and herself answering them, not always to the letter, yet near enough to give the right sense. "I'm extremely edified!" he exclaimed, when they had reached the end of the task, "(and by learning as many pages every day you may soon become a member of our Church." Hardly had he spoken when Miles left his bed under the stair-case and walked to the door with a savage growl. In another moment they heard a horse neigh, and Wadsworth, guessing who had ar- rived, hastened to meet the party, while the old maids smoothed down their aprons and glanced at Lydia, who had not the remotest idea of what was to happen, and thought it was ionly some of the town folks come to spend the evening. To describe the girl's feelings when suddenly her father ap- peared, leaning on Wadsworth's arm, would be im- possible. With a joyous cry she threw herself on   the old man's breast, while the regicide, bowing down his head, wept tears of gladness. ' A tiresome journey, Lydia," he said, wiping his eyes, "a tiresome journey, but it's worth all the fatigue just to see you again." "Well, if you had not come, father, I was not going to remain away fromn you much longer, no indeed I was not." During this touching scene, Miss Crabtree and Goody Garlic stood quietly by the east window, Miles alone venturing to approach, and sniff at the Colonel's legs. Presently the latter caught sight of the faithful woman, who for so many years had kept house for him in the wilderness, and seizing her hand he pressed it warmly, then with- out waiting for an introduction, he greeted Charity Crabtree, whom Adams had already told him all about; and the aunt with a smile, which revealed every one: of her jagged teeth, hastened to assure him that she would leave nothing undone to make. him comfortable and happy. Then drawing the best chair close to the hearth and placing a cushion upon it, she urged him to be seated; after which, giving the servant-maid a pinch, she bade the drudge prepare a second meal. "You must thank Mr. Wadsworth for this," whispered Prudence to Lydia; " it's all his doing?" "Oh, yes; God bless him! He is a noble, gen-    242      ROMANCE OF THE erous man, and I never can thank him enough." As she spoke the girl turned to look for her host. But the Captain was not to be found, he had slipped out to the stable where Adams was putting up the horse. "But my daughter!" exclaimed the Colonel, drawing Lydia towards him and staring at her, "w whave you been doing to yourself? as I live, every curl gone!" "Alas," she sighed, "long hair is not approved of, and it had to be clipped. However, when I get back to the woods I'll let it take a fresh start, and shall soon have my curls again." Here the old man laughed, and was about saying something when she interrupted him to ask how he lhad left the Chickens, and whether any wolves had got over the stockade. "The chickens, dear," he replied, " are all well, and so are the sheep, and the cow, and not a wolf  has troubled us." "But you yourself had a narrow escape from tihe wild beasts. Oh, Lydia! by what a merciful Providence you were saved." "Yes, father, it was a merciful Providence." Here the color suddenly left her cheek; she re- membered the secret which had escaped her on that eventful night. "But, no," she murmured,   CHARTER OAK.       243 "I cannot believe he will betray me; no, no, he will not." "I have left Christian in charge of everything," resumed her parent, " and when the spring opens, he will bring chickens and all to Hartford." At these words his daughter gave him an inquir- ing look. "For you must know, Lydia," he con- tinued, " that Mr. Wadsworth has invited me- to make this my home in future." -The faintest shadow stole over the girl's counten- ance at this announcement. "Might it be," she thought, " part of a deep-laid plan to win my af- fections? It certainly places me in a sore predica- ment, for I shall owe the Captain a debt of gratitude hard to pay." "It seems," continued the regicide, "that he learned from Adams how I was situated, anld de- termined to smooth my last days by giving me a comfortable retreat." "And Joe'll make you, happy as long as you live," interrupted the aunt. "My nephew has unbounded influence; one call from him would rally round you the bravest train-band that ever carried mus- ket and pike." Miss Crabtree spoke with such earnestness, that for the first time since Lydia had gazed on her gi- ganltic top-knot, she felt something like love for the woman. Then reflecting how natural it was   244      ROMANCE OF THE that one, holding Wadsworth's political opinions, should be anxious to befriend her father, she dis- missed all suspicion of his having invited him to his home for a selfish end. Presently the Captain re-appeared, accompanied by Simon, and flying to meet him, the girl, in a voice broken with emotion, thanked him for the joyful surprise he had given her. "It will add," she said, " years to my father's life; oh, a thousand thanks, sir, a thousand thanks for what you have done." Wadsworth, as he felt her hand touch his, press- ed his lips together, while his eyes wandered to- wards King Charles' twelve good rules, posted above the fire-place. Oh, what a battle he was waging with himself! As once before, the color mounted to his brow; he groaned, and for an in- stant shut his eyes. But all in vain, he could not resist. He forgot the prayers he had made only a few nights before, and with an impatient toss of his head, as if to say, "begone, my vow, begone," he gave the regicide's daughter a glance which re- vealed to his aunt who was watching him closely, if not to the girl herself, all that the latter most dreaded. "Let us praise the Lord," whispered Miss Crab- tree to Prudence, "the spell is broken." "Yes," rejoined the other, "'twas a happy   CHARTER OAK.       245 thought to invite the Colonel here; the child can- not but love her benefactor." Simon likewise perceived the sudden change which had come over his master; the honest fel- low's plan was working to perfection, and his heart was so full of joy, that he forgot all about his quarrel with dame Garlic, and even ventured to pat her affectionately on the shoulder; while Miss Crabtree went so far as to call Miles " a dear, good dog." It was a much later hour than usual when the happy household separated for the night. One might have thought that the laughter and talking was never going to cease. The cricket under the hearth-stone chirped louder than ever it had chirp- ed before, while the blazing hickory, as if it kn/ew how memorable an occasion it was, threw a noon- day gleam into the remotest corner of the vast apartment. But at length they bade one another good night, and Wadsworth, as he ascended the staircase, actually hummed a me'ry tune, while hie aunt snapped her fingers and ,cried out, "Hallelu- jah! it's a coming, it's a coming."   246      ROMANCE OF THE CHAPTER XI. WE left Nancy Clark standing on the porch of her father's house, gazing after the retreating figure of Lydia Goffe. At last when her friend disappeared from view, she returned to her bed- room, where a few dry sticks, and a little blowing with the bellows, soon restored a cheerful flame on the hearth; then seating herself in front of it, she gave herself up to reverie. The beams of the sun were dying away upon the wall, the house was quiet, all seemed to invite a strain of pensive thought. What a fate hers had been! He who had once made love to her, who had pressed his lips to her cheek years ago on Wyllys' hill, was not to stay a bachelor for ever. So at least the gossips were saying. "But no," she murmured, "no, I cannot believe it; there stands his covenant. Woe to him, woe to him, if he has fallen, but Is cannot, I will not believe it." Here Nancy's eye turned on her mother's spindle and distaff, and while she gazed on these dear objects, a strange feeling came over her; it was as if the one whom she had so tenderly loved were present in the room, invisible and yearning for the hour when they should meet again. And as she thought of her mother, she remembered how the   f         OCHARTER OAK.       247 good christian woman had urged her to be a dutiful child, to love her father, and make his home happy after she would be gone. "I'll try, I'll try," said Nancy; abut how far must I go in my obedience?  Do I not already stay away from meeting? Am I not aiding him in his schemes to overthrow liberty in Connecticut? Will it be my duty to take whatever husband he may select?"Here she shook her head; and cover- ing her face with her hands, thought once more of her early love, and the happy hours under the old oak tree. And so the day waned, it grew darker and darker, and still she remained seated by the fire, going over her past life, wondering what her future was to be. At length the. flame on the hearth appeared to die out, her eyes closed, Nancy was dreaming. She found herself standing alone on a rock, which projected far out into the ocean. The horizon was darkl and over the waves, which were rolling towards her, a sea-gull was screaming, "Never again, Nancy, never again." The waters mounted higher and higher, she strove to escape, something kept her rooted to the spot. And still the bird screamed, and up, up, rose the tide ; the rock on which she stood began to tremble. At length, just as a great whirlpool was about to draw her into its depths, she awoke with a start.   248      -ROMANCE OF THE And, oh! what a relief it was to find herself safe in her cozy apartment. But the fire was out, there was scarcely enough light to see by, and she was wondering how late it might be, when she heard her father calling her. Hastening below, she found him at his desk, rub- bing his hands and scolding because she had not come sooner to bring him his slippers. "I thought you were deaf or- dead," he ex- claimed, as she entered the room; then rubbing his hands, "whew! how cold it is; I'm glad to get home."' "Oh, father, do be careful," said Nancy, as she drew his arm-chair close to the hearth, "remember the sickness you took year before last, from staying out late on a winter evening; come, sit near the fire, do." "Well, I think I'm good for a hundred years," said Mr. Clark, witha chuckle; "I've had small pox, and dear knows what not, yet I've worried through it all. However, as you say, I ought 'to take reasonable care of my health." Here he threw himself into the arm-chair. "I'd rather the night had been less sharp," he continued, after warming himself a moment, " on account of Captain Synnot. He told us, you re- member, that he would travel fast and might be able to get here from Boston this evening. If he   CHARTER OAK.      249 does, be sure and make yourself agreeable; you know why." The young woman did not answer, while her father drew her gently towards him. "The other evening," he. pursued, "you made a good beginning; but you must keep it up. Say something about Sir Edmund, let the officer see that you are loyal to the King, and never again mention the: name of Joseph Wadsworth." Still Nancy did not speak. "'Tis for your sake as well aIs mine that I'm serving the government," continued Mr. Clark, "l I repeat what I have already told you a dozen times, you will share my reward, and these low-born Puritan girls shall envy you.' Tell me, child, is any thing the matter? Why are you so silent? speak!" But Nancy's lips remained closed. She shrank from incurring his wrath by revealing what her thoughts were, yet she could not tell a falsehood and say that she yielded -assent to his plans. Presently, with a frown, he bade her bring him a candle, and also a bundle of papers from the left hand side of his desk; then, having selected one with a peculiar mark upon it, he began to examine it with great interest. It was a pen-and-ink sketch of Hartford and the country around, the duplicate of which he had sent to Andros by Captain Synnot. Especially did his eyes gloat over a certain part of the paper whereon was marked a field, which a town   250      ROMANCE OF THE meeting had lately voted for school purposes, but of which he intended to become the owner. Good though the title might appear to the freemen, Sir Edmund would soon have power to do whatever he chose, and Mr. Clark did not doubt that the vote would be declared null and void. "The first sets tlers," he said, " got the land from a Pequot chief, and his Excellency holds that an Indian title is no better than the scratch of a bear's paw.?"The au- thor of this little map was no other than his'datugh- ter Nancy. After he had feasted his eyes upon it, he folded it up, and drew out another paper which he bade the young woman read to him. Of course she obeyed, but not without a feeling of humilia- tion ; for, like the map, this too was the work of her pen. It contained the names of the mem- bers of the Hartford train-band, and the' first on the list was that Of Joseph Wadsworth, while after these were figures giving the number of muskets and pikes, the amount of ammunition, and lastly, the population of the town. When she had finished, her father thanked her and declared his firm belief that -the spirit of in- dependence wouid soon be trampled out in Con- necticut. "And then, Nancy," he added, "will be our day of triumph." After the, meal, which followed this conversation, * See Palfrey's Hist. N. E., Vol. III., p. '552.   CHARTE lOAK.       251 he did not again look at his papers, but whiled away the hours, smoking his pipe, and now and then putting a question to his daughter, who had taken out her knitting needles and was seated near him.     *      '  "By the way," he asked, " what have you dis- covered about that strange girl, whom I saw riding with Mr. Wadsworth? Who is she? What is her name " "I do not know, sir," replied Nancy. "Humph! then I've found out more than you have. She's called Lydia Garlic. I doubt, how- ever if it is her true name. Oh, 'tis -not easy to deceive me." "Well pray, father, who think you she is?" "I will tell you. Do you remember, six or seven years ago, Goffe the regicide was -for a short time concealed here by Captain Bull?" "Yes." "Well, while he was staying with the Captain, there was. also a little girl living there, who I am. sure was no kin to her host, and I satisfied myself that the child, who was a most lovely being, with golden ringlets, and as full of fun as a cricket, was the regicide's daughter. Now, it wouldn,'t surprise me if this very young woman were she; I traced the likeness the 'moment I beheld her long, wavy hair;- and what strengthens my suspicion is, that   252      ROMANCE OF THE the child disappeared about the same time Goffe himself did. Here Mr. Clarklooked at his daughter as though he expected to see her manifest some surprise ; but Nancy did not open her lips, nor did her expression change in the least.. "I fear, Miss," he continued, "that you do not take enough interest in my schemes, or you would not remain dumb. -Where is your enthusiasm for the royal cause? Alas, if I did not keep you con- stantly under the spur, you would never lift a fin- ger to better your condition. Why, if we could only manage to capture the regicide, we might command our own reward: it would be more gratifying tfo the King than all our other services." He was still waiting for his daughter to say something, when the tramp of a horse was heard, and to her unspeakable relief he sprang up and hastened out on the porch. Presently she distin- guished Captain Synnot's voice, and in another mobment the officer entered the parlor, making a low bow as he advanced, anq greeting her in the most ' kindly manner. "Certainly a very agreeable person," thought Nancy, "-and he has a good face." But when she,:reflected on the part he was play- ing, and that he belonged to Sir Edmund's staff, her lip curled, and :her eye, usually so mild, flashed   CHAETER OAK.       253 with indignation; then, as he drew nearer, she folded her arms and looked steadily at him. This conduct, so different from that of her father, who was all smiles and honied words, astonished Henry Synnot, who naturally felt a little embarrassed. ( "What can it mean?" he thought. At this moment Mr. Clark entered, and without noticing his daughter, he began eagerly to inquire about the map and the other papers which he had sent to Boston. "Did his Excellency like them?" he said. "Tell me all the particulars, Captain, do! In the mean while," here he glanced an instant at the young wo- man, "make haste, Nancy, and prepare the supper; our guest, after his long ride, needs refreshment." At once the young woman withdrew, leaving her father and the officer to continue the conversation alone, to her no small regret, for she was anxious to hear the news. "Sir Edmund 'was pleased beyond any thing," replied Synnot, " and is convinced that when Pres- ident Dudley recommended you to him, he did a wise thing. The map of Hartford, and the list of those who comprise the train-band were precisely what his excellency needed, and should he be obliged to come here himself/to obtain the charter, you will be specially honored by him." At this Mr. Clark could not help rubbing his An, Of  -   254       ROMANCE OF THE hands. "Well, speaking of the charter, Captain, tell me what are the prospects of trouble in regard to it?" "Humph! you know as much about that as I do, it all depends upon the temper of the people. I have in my pocket a letter for Governor Treat, which I shall deliver to-morrow, wherein another demand is made for the surrender of the instru- ment." "Well, I doubt if the freemen will yield, and would advise that no decisive step be taken for a few months at least. His Excellency cannot- lose by delay; the roads at this season are bad, and the people would mind less the cold and snow, thian the foreign soldiers, whom he would bring with him. Aye, Captain, urge Sir Edmund to wait until the autumn, if he must needs have recourse to force. But now that we are on this topic, would you ob- ject to reading me his Excellency's letter?" "Of course not; Sir Edmund wishes you to know its contents."  As Synnot spoke he drew from his breast pocket the document alluded to, and which read thus: SIR: The twelfth instant I received a letter from you, dated 26th January ; in answer, you say, to mine, wherein his Majesty's pleasure and commands, relating to the surrender of your charter, was made known unto you, which being so gracious a concession on his Majesty's part, I thought needed no other argument, than his Mejesty's own words, to induce your compliance, as those of Rhode Island have loyally and dutifully done. And the letter you mentioned at his M ajesty's accession to the crown can be no   CHARTER OAK.          255 color for your delay, but the contrary; his Majesty having not only signified his royal pleasure and given me his commands for you, as above, (which certainly is a perfect answer to the several applications intimated in your letter,) but also the government of other of his territories in New England, are all settled, except yourselves. Finding your delay on such mistaken notions, and yet professing your desire to demonstrate your loyalty, obedience and duty, this is by advice of his Majesty's council here, to give you another opportunity of suitable and dutiful resolves so much importuning your own welfare, if you yet do it, and let me hear from you without delay, that I may not be wanting in my duty. Accordingly I am. your most affectionate friend, BOSTON, 25th day of Febr., '87.     E. ANDROS. Governor Treat and Council of Connecticut. "Very good, very good, indeed!" exclaimed Mr. Clark, when his guest had    finished  reading." "But I repeat, sir, urge his Excellency not to push matters to extremes at present. I doubt if the people will consent to surrender their charter, and if force have to be used, 'twill be better to wait a few months, say until autumn, when the roads are good and travelling easy." "I shall press this course upon Sir Edmund," answered  the officer, " for there is wisdom  in it." Here followed a pause in the conversation, after which M3r. Clark went on. "Tell me now," he said, "something about my own private affairs." "You mean the school-land?" "To be sure." "Oh, that he granted immediately; here is the deed," and  as the officer spok he handed Mr. ;   256      ROMANCE OF THE Clark a roll of parchment which the fingers of the latter eagerly clutched, while at the same time he called his daughter to come and view the first reward of their services. "This, child," he exclaimned, " is the meadow I have so long coveted; at last it is mine. As soon as the town hires it- to any body, I will serve on the tenant a writ of intrusion, and foolish will he be who disputes my title. Ha! ha! isn't this glorious?" But the young woman, who had obeyed his sum- mons, and was now standing at his elbow, seemed perfectly indifferent to what he was telling her. For an instant she glanced at the officer, and the latter fancied he could detect in her fac e a shade of defiance. But her lips did not move. "The fact is," pursued her father, shrugging his shoulders, "my daughter never lets herself be carried away by good news, or by bad; she is a stoic, if ever there was one, yet at the same time she is a staunch royalist; are you not, Nancy?" Here he turned towards the young woman. Most fortunate it was, that at this moment one of the burning sticks rolled out of the fireplace, and came to within a few inches of her dress, causing her to start back, while Mr. Clark seized the tongs to replace it. Although but a trifling incident, it saved her from answering the question, and when ,   CHARTER OAK.       257 the conversation was resumed, it. was on quite an- other subject. Nancy's conduct, however, had left a deep impression on Henry Synnot. Accustomed to scrutinize the features of others, and to look be- neath the surface, the suspicion was dawning upon him: that she might be less zealous in favoring her parent's schemes than the latter imagined, and this surmise, far from lowering her in his esteem, made him, on the contrary, view her with an in- terest which he had not hitherto done. For, al- though he wag himself serving King James, he was by nature a high-minded man, and could not but admire the freemen of Connecticut for' the bold stand they were taking against their oppressor. "Yes," he said, "I like Miss Clark better for be- ing true to her native land." Before we bring this chapter to a close, let us say a few words regarding the officer's antecedents and parentage. Henry Synnof belonged to an old Yorkshire family, which for generations had fur- nished to the army of England, brave and useful men. His. grandfather, Hugh Synnot, had been one of the most faithful adherents of Charles the First, and for the courage he had displayed at the battle of Naseby, in 1645, where he had received three wounds endeavoring to retrieve the fortunes of that disastrous day, the King had created him a baronet. At his death the title had descended to   258      ROMANCE OF THE his eldest son, who during the Protectorate dwelt in Scotland, where he was an earnest partisan of the young Charles Stuart, and who lived to greet the return of that prince to England, in 1660, as Charles the Second. During his stay in Scotland, he had married the daughter of a chieftain named Macgregor, who bore him two sons, Ralph and Henry. The latter is the Captain Synnot of our narrative. When Henry was in his sixteenth year, he had been sent as a page to court, where his comeliness and grace of manner soon made him a general favorite. Amongst those who at that time were serving the Queen as Maids of Honor, the young- est was Elizabeth Churchill, a girl of rare beauty, and the daughter of Sir William Churchill. Her maternal grandfather was the Reverend Stephen Goffe, rector of Stamnar, Sussex, who, as we re- member was the parent of Goffe, the regicide. Young Synnot had not been many months a page, before he fell in love with Elizabeth Churchill, and being somewhat of an artist, he had prevailed upon her to let him take her portrait. - This attachment between the young couple would doubtless have ended in marriage, but for the young lady's death, which happened when Henry was in his eighteenth year. I He soon afterwards left court and entered the army, where for a while he served as aid-de-   CHARTER OAK.       259 camp to the General commanding the household troops. But his restless spirit became dissatisfied with a position of such ease and comfort, and i when Sir Edmund Andros, in the winte(r of 1686, was ordered to New. England, he hastened to get transferred to his staff. It may appear strange that one who, during his life at court, had be6n thrown among many beautiful women, should have become so deeply impressed by a girl whom he had met but once, in an American forest. Yet often since the eventful night when he had saved Lydia from death, her image had risen before him; and the idea that she might be a daughter of the regi- cide had only increased his longing to see her again; for if she were, she would then be cousin to Elizabeth Churchill. Although he did not speak about it to Mr. Clark, as they sat over the fire this evening, he was determined not to leave Hartford without obtaining an interview with Lydia. But the hour grows late, the knitting-needles have dropped from Nancy's fingers, her head is nodding, it is time for them all to retire. =    260      ROMANCE OF THE CHAPTER XII. TME journey from the log cabin to Hartford was borne by the regicide with less fatigue than might have been expected of one of his age and infirmi- ties; and when the family assembled next morning for prayers, he took his place in the group. lMiss Crabtree was much struck by his reverent demeanor, and she could not help thinking as he bowed his head, that the patriarchs, of whom she had read in Scripture, must have been men like him. "I'm sure," she said, "my nephew and he will agree well together, and if they do, the rest'll follow easy enough; the girl will love whoever the old man loves, for, with all her giddiness, I can see she is devoted to him." But Charity's happy mood was not destined to be of long duration. We remember that Wadsworth had consented to, give a husking party, and as they sat around the breakfast table, this morning, he told her that he could see no reason why it should be any longer postponed, with which she quite agreed, and added, that the sooner it was given the better. "To-morrow evening will suit me, Joe; the cider is spoiling to be drunk, and the nuts will all decay, unless they are eaten up at once." Adams heard this with a grin, and when he rose   CHARTER OAK.       261 from the table, he said a longer grace than usual, and could not but believe he had been unjust to- wards Wadsworth. "Yes, yes," murmured the honest fellow, " when Captain Joe appeared cold and indifferent, the first morning he saw Miss Lydia, he was only bashful. Since she's been here a -great change has come over him; he talks and laughs, and this husking party will show folks that he isn't going to live a bachelor for ever." Lydia also was delighted at the prospect of an entertain- ment so novel to her, and where she would have an opportunity of meeting so many of the Hart- ford people. The next question to be decided was, who were to be invited. Miss Crabtree accordingly drew up her chair next to Wadsworth, and for about twenty minutes they were engaged making out a list of guests. The Captain then read it over aloud, and when he had got through, both his aunt and Goody Garlic glanced at Lydia. Nancy Clark was not among the chosen ones. The regicide's daughter must have divined their thoughts; for approaching her host, she said to him in her most winning way, " do let my friend ;Nancy come". At the mention of her name, Wads- worth became suddenly confused, and pressed his hand to his forehead. The old aunt was eyeing him steadfastly, but it was not the fear of dis-   262      ROMANCE OF THE pleasing her which made him. hesitate over his answer. "Can it be possible," muttered Charity, "that he will again suffer under his roof the woman who has been the blight of his life?"Then remember- ing Colonel Goffe's presence, she made a great ef- fort to restrain her tongue; but feeling that her anger was getting the better of her, she hastened to her bed-room, where she might give way to it unseen. Ere, however, she reached the top of the staircase, she heard her nephew say, "Yes, let Nancy come." When he had spoken these words, Wadsworth groaned and hung his head. He could not refuse Lydia's request, he felt himself completely in her power; yet, oh, what a torture to have Nancy Clark at the festivity! How her presence would remind him of that which he would now have given all the world to forget-his covenant. His only hope was that she might not accept the invitation. Yet even in this hope there lurked a sting; for the lonely, retired life she had led during the past few years, came-yes, he- felt sure it did-from the wound her heart had received when she had given him up-a willing sacrifice, it is true, and for a holy end,; yet the flame of love still smouldered in her breast, the wound had never healed, and her very absence would bring to him sad memories. "Oh /   CHAR rER OAK.       263 yes,' he murmured, 'she released me from my plighted troth, but not in order that I might wed another." While these thoughts were pressing upon him, Lydia drew from between his- fingers the slip of paper containing the names ; then without delaying longer than necessary to put on her cloak and hood, she sallied forth, determined to deliver her- self the invitations, and regretting, as she crossed the threshold, that Miss Crabtree had not stayed below to witness her triumph. What a sweet re- venge it would have been for the loss of her curls! She did not' stop to chat with any of the town- folks whom she met, and who appeared as curious as ever to question her regarding herself and the Captain of the train-band; but walking straight on, past the green and over the bridge, she was soon at Mr. Clark's house. As she entered the gate, tHenry Synnot and his host were looking out of the front window,- and the officer could with difficulty restrain himself from hastening to meet her. - He feared, however, that this might startle Lydia, by recalling to her mind the important secret which she had so unwittingly divulged. "No," he thought, " it will not do to address her here in the presence of a man whose sentiments towards the regicide--who, mayhap, is her father-cannot be other than hostile; such an   264      ROMANCE OF THE interview would be ill-timed." Yet he was aston- ished to find one whom he suspected to be Goffe's daughter, entering the dwelling of a zealous parti- san of the King. Yes, this puzzled him. Might it be that she was ignorant of Mr, Clark's senti- ments? or perhaps Nancy, whom, doubtless, she was coming to visit, (and this suspicion had flash- ed across his mind before,) might not be as devoted to the royal cause, as lter parent believed. Lydia had just reached the top of the porch when her friend ran out and greeted her with an embrace. "Look," whispered- Mr. Clark, smiling," my daughter plays her part well. But who do you think- her friend is? Ha, ha! I will tell you by- and-by." At these words Synnot bit his lip, while a feeling of shame came over him. "I might," he thought, withdrawing a little from the window, yet still gazing at Lydia, " be doing a nobler service than carrying dispatches, the purport of which bodes only ill to the freemen of Connecticut. I But, as I live, if yonder girl does not bear a striking resem- blance to my lost love, Elizabeth Churchill!" Lydia was taller, and had perhaps a more de- termined air; yet there was the same hazel eye, the same dimpled chin, which points of resemblance had escaped him when he had first seen her by   CHARTER OAK.       265 moonlight in the forest; but now they made him hold his breath-it was as if the dead had risen to life. "Do tell me who she is?"' he urged. "By-and-by," said his host, with a grim smile, "by-and-by. I'm not sure of it yet; it is only a suspicion. .But this much I will tell you, that I think she is the same girl whom you rescued from the wolves; am I right?" Synnot nodded. "I never saw her till the day after your first visit to me," continued M3r. Clark; "she was then riding on a pillion behind the stiffest enemy the King has in these parts. I'm very glad my daughter has be- come intimate with her, for I may thus be able -to learn more of the plans of Joseph Wadsworth, under whose roof she is sojourning. They are already like sisters; see, here they come, hand in hand." But, instead of entering the parlor, Lvdia and Nancy went up to the second story, and Mr. Clark presently changed the conversation, and began asking sundry questions regarding Sir Edmund and his policy. But the replies of his guest were not as clear as he might have wished-- Captain Synnot, to save himself, could not drive Lydia from his mind, and he was still thinking about her when she and Nancy again hastily passed the parlor door and went out of the house. "'Tis some years since I've visited any of the   266      ROMANCE OF THE folks; how they'll stare when they see me!" said the latter, taking her friend's arm. "Well, unless they are uncivil people,"' remarked Lydia, "I'd not hold aloof from them ; life is too short to spend in moping; we must make the most i of it." "So we should, in a Christian way, and if they did not behave rudely I might now and then pass an hour with them; but they whisper, and buzz, and point their fingers when I walk by, as if there were something odd about me. True, I don't go to meeting." Here she sighed. "Why do you not?"Nancy shook her head and her companion was trying to guess the reason, when they came to the ruling elder's abode, which was the first on the list. It stood on the west side - of the street, facing the green, and Lydia could not but think that such a situation exactly suited a being so penitential looking as Israel Barebones- the grave-stones, the stocks, the whipping-post, the jail, all in full view from his front windows. The ruling elder, who had come to the door to admit them, held out his long middle finger towards Nancy, and as she entered, the young woman cast down her eyes as though she felt crushed by his presence. When she had shaken it a moment he offered it to her companion; but the latter barely   CHAET'rl OAK. .     267 touched it, then quickly withdrew her hand with an WI expression of loathing. ;  Having followed him into the room where he l I usually passed his forenoons in study and medi-   tation, they sat down, and Nancy proceeded to inform him of the object of their visit, to which he listened without interrupting until she had finished, then allowed more than a minute to elapse before the answered; and Lydia, who had expected to find hinm only too glad to go to the husking, felt quite t indignant at his hesitation. During his silence, i?: her eyes had turned towards a table near by, on which lay a broad sheet of paper with a strange figure drawn upon it, resembling a see-saw, with a chair fastened at one end of the board, and she was yet wondering what it might represent, when, heav- I ing a deep sigh, the ruling elder told Nancy that he would go. "But," he added, "I hope there will be no signs of ungodliness such as I witnessed last year j at Mr. Job's husking, where three lasses appeared with blue ribbons in their hair, and sleeves gather- ed up above the elbows. A h! 'twas a harrowing sight, and it was thinking about it which induced me to turn my attention to this "---here he faced the table and rested his pencil on the drawing. "Behold," he continued, "my new-fashioned ducking stool. With God's help 'twill go far to check sinful luxury and display; 'twill also do for   268      ROMANCE OF THE sabbath-breakers,"-at these words he glanced at Nancy. "Three times over head and ears, says the law for those who have a quarrelsome spirit and an evil tongue; what then should be the punishment of those who deck out their bodies in a style not approved by the shepherds of the flock and which rejoiceth Beelzebub? I would say duck them six times; while sabbath-breakers--" he did not finish the phrase, but Nancy shuddered. "The ducking stool," he continued, " which we- have thus far been using, is an antiquated piece of machinery, and besides, the water at the willow tree is not over three feet deep and the sinner receives but a gentle wetting. Now I have devised something new, quite new. As you perceive, here is a chair, not dangling by a rope from the limb of a tree, but fastened to one end of a long board, the centre of which can rest upon a log, while the sinner swings far over the stream.'" While he was explaining the drawing, his hand trembled, his eyes gleamed with fanatic joy, and the expression of his face was that of one in an ecstasy. When he had got through, Nancy did not utter a- word, nor show the least sign of impatience; but Lydia could not conceal her feelings, and rising from her seat she told her friend that she would not hear another word about ducking-stools; then with a toss of her head, she walked out.       COHARTER OAK.        269 C :,: Again did the ruling elder offer his icy finger to Nancy, and again the latter shook it; then bend- ing down he whispl 'd. "Why do you not reform, and go to meeting and thereby set a good example to Miss Garlic, who, unless I am much deceived, will not readily own ithe covenant?" X!  The young woman murmured, "I will, I will;" J then in a voice scarcely above a whisper, she bade him good bye, and followed after her friend. "What a detestable man," exclaimed Lydia, as J g soon as the door had closed, "I wish he'd not come to the husking." "Be not too hasty in judging Mr. Barebones," said Nancy.  "I myself have no great cause to love him, for, as I have told you, I do not go any more to meeting, and he may soon have me punished. I Yet we musb admire his zeal; if his eye never sleeps, if he worries about other folks, it is his duty to do so."  Bji - "Well, I hate busy-bodies!" exclaimed Lydia, who began to realize more and more what an in- tolerable yoke the Puritan faith would be to her. Presently they came to a house, much smaller than the one they had left, and by the moss on the roof and the tumble-down chimney, you could ] see that it had been built a number of years. It had only one  window, which looked as if it had   270      ROMANCE OF THE not been cleaned since winter set in; and against the dim glass inside were pressed two little noses, while a voice was singing, ' Oh, be joyful." The singer stopped the moment they"? knocked, and when the door opened, there sat Mr. Japheth, look- ing the picture of contentment, hammering away at a piece of leather, while a lame boy and a sickly' girl stood partly concealed by the door, peeping at them. "Come, now, don't be sheep-faced, wipe your noses and come forward, "he exclaimed, addres- sing his children, at the same time greeting Nancy and Lydia with a hearty shake of the hand; and as he did so, the latter thought there was more kindliness in his one eye than in all the other eyes she had ever seen, except her father's. "Come Tommy, come Betsy, know ye not Miss Clark? And this is a friend of hers; approach and say, 'how d'ye do?'"The children obeyed, then hastily shrunk behind a screen, which divided off about one-hllalf of the room. "How is your wife?" inquired Nancy, offering to Lydia the bench which Mr. Japheth drew up, after having first wiped it with his leathern apron; "Oh, she's well, and will be glad to see you; won't you Kitty?" turning towards the screen; it's Miss Clark and a friend." A faint voice answered, "yes, very glad." Nancy now disappeared, leaving   CHARTER OAK.       271 her companion to chat with the cobbler, and as the l I regicide's daughter gazed at his jovial countenance, and then noticed the signs of poverty around her, she could not but think how kind Providence had been to give him such a happy nature. How unlike the well-to-do, melancholy Israel Barebones. Mr. Japheth now proceeded to relate to her in simple language his history, and a monotonous, matter-of- t*i fact tale it was; a hard childhood; a hard life all along; a spouse for seven years bed-ridden, a lame child. "But then, Miss," he continued, "I've 8 work enough, nay, more than I can attend to, and it's only after dusk I can manage to slip off to the ' Bunch of Grapes,' for a game of shovel-board." While he was narrating his past life, his wife and i  Nancy were talking over the town gossip; and if ever there was a case in which an almost morbid desire to know what others were saying and doing was excusable, it surely was in this poor woman's. "'Tis going on seven years since I was able to stand on my feet," she said; " since then I've been in bed, hearing nothing but my husband hammer- ing at the pegs, and his cheerful voice going over again the old tunes he used to sing when he was courting me. Oh, you can't tell how glad I am to hear the news." While she was speaking, Nancy's attention had been drawn to a cage hanging against the white-   272      BOMANCE OF TEM washed wall, in which a miserable robin was trim- ming its feathers, and as she gazed at it the bird opened its wings, as if it hoped she had come to set it free. "Bob does nothing but mope," continued Mrs. Japheth, " you can have him if you like, he would be happier with you." The young woman shook her head. "No more pets, I get too fond of them, and then they die," she answered. "Well, all our pets live, do they -not?" exclaim- ed Mr. Japheth, who had caught this last remark, "and die of old age." "Of-old-age," murmured his wife, straining her hollow eyes towards the ceiling, as if the num- ber of years she had yet to pass bed-ridden, were written there for her to read. "It seems a century that I've been as I am, a century!"Then pausing a moment, "How's Mr. Wadsworth?" she whis- pered, "I am told he's changed very much. Oh! it's working into his heart like the fangs of a snake; he'll never get rest. Jacob told me all about it. He saw him making love to you, and--" Here Nancy colored and placed her finger on her lips; then bending down, with her mouth close to the woman's ear, " be charitable in your judgment of Wadsworth," she said. "If he has remained single, it has been in order that he might achieve a \   CHARTER OAK.       273 great end. In telling you this, Mrs.?Japheth, I re- veal a secret, which I have never breathed to another human being." "Ah, child! you're exactly like your poor, dear maother; you can't see anything wrong in other folks. Why, what is this story I hear about a young woman who rides out with him? she is staying in the same house, too. Ah! if he marries anyone but you, a heavy judgment will rest upon him. Yet, unless my Jacob is greatly deceived, Mr. Wadsworth is about taking such a step." "May the Lord hear my prayers," murmured Nancy. "No, I do not believe it." Then, after a short silence, she told Mrs. Japheth it was time for her to be going. At this moment there came a loud burat of laughter, accompanied by clapping of hands and shouts from Tommy and his sister. "A husking party, did you say?" cried Mr. Japheth. "Ha, ha, ha! Well, upon my honor, the world's coming to an end. Captain Joseph 'Wadsworth of Hartford town, shaking off his gloom and going to give a husking party! Well, if te old woman says I may, I'll be there, sure." Here Nancy emerged from behind the screen, and informed him that his wife had given her full consent. "And take me," shouted the boy.   274      ROMANCE OF THE "And me too," cried his sister. "Hut, tut! Brats of your age must be abed when the cricket chirps. Now don't begin to bawl; you shan't go," was the mother's answer. The children, pouted, and twining their arims around their father's neck, begged him to bring them plenty of cookies, and a jar of grape sweet- meats, nor did they cease rubbing their dirty faces against his beard until they had made him promise a basket full of good things. Nandy now pressed the tithing man's hand, then, as she bade good-bye, told him she hoped he would enjoy himself at Mr. Wadsworth's. "'No danger of my doing otherwise," he stid, "and you must be there too." The young woman, without making any answer, raised the latch and passed out ; but Lydia, who lingered a step behind gave him a significant nod. "Yes, to please me you must come," said the latter, after the door had closed; "if you don't, then I won't show myself either. In Miss Crab- tree's presence I told the Captain I wanted you, and I repeat, you are invited." Still Nancy remained silent. The expression of her face was calm ; it revealed nothing of the grief that was in her heart. What if the gossip of the town should prove true?-what then?-submission to God's will. "Yes," she sighed, " yes, I will bear   CHARTER OAK.       275  i my cross to the end, and never cease praying for l i him. Poor Wadsworth!"  The friends now visited a number of other fami- lies, with each one leaving an invitation to the husking party, and everywhere it was accepted with the exclamation, "We'll be there, sure!" The last place they went to was the cabin, at the ex- treme south end of the town, inhabited by Mrs Bull, where their knock was answered- by a voice shriller than Jacob Japheth's, yet full as cheery, and which bade them " enter and be jolly." As Lydia cross- ed the threshold, her attention immediately fasten- ed on the widow, a corpulent dame of fifty sum- mers, who was ensconsed in a broad arm-chair read- ing a book, which she hastily thrust under her apron as they approached. "Welcome to you both," exclaimed the good woman, tossing back a profusion of yellow ringlets decked with divers colored ribbons, "Welcome to you both." Then eyeing the regicide's daughter, "I could vow, Miss," she said, "I've seen you somewhere afore." ( "Yes, a few days ago, riding by with Captain  Wadsworth," replied Lydia. "Oh! afore that. I  said to myself then your face was familiar. My sight's keen and I've a good memory; no, no!"Then drawing the girl nearer and placing her mouth to her ear: "I saw you," she whispered, "s in my old house, the one I used :  nm               e   276      ROMANCE OF THE to live in afore my husband was lost on the Polly Ann, and afore debt obliged me to sell out and move here. Your father was with you. But, iMiss Goffe, mum's the word." At these words the color fled from Lydia's cheek; what the dame said was enough to startle her. "How many," she asked herself," are going to know my true name; how many?"Presently, Mrs. Bull turned to Nancy and inquired how she had been of late and what was the news. "Well, God has blessed me with fair health," re- plied the young woman. "As for news there's very little." At this Mrs. Bull gave Lydia a wink, then again placing her mouth to the girl's ear, "I've heard all about it, Miss Goffe," she whispered, " oh, all about it; he didn't take you on his pillion for nothing. Well, he's an honest man, a clever man, and you'll make up for his one-sided views in re- ligion, by your strong common sense, and your bright face will drive away his melancholy. When he speaks .against my ribbons, say a word in my defense; where's the sin in 'em?'  "None at all, goodwife," replied Lydia, blush- ing, and half inclined to chide the widow for making so free with a foolish piece of gossip; " and I hope you may wear them to-morrow evening at the husking the Captain is to give. My friend and I   CHARTER OAK.    .   2" have been going about inviting folks, and that is what brings us here." "A husking party at Captain Joe's!" exclaimed the dame. "Well, really, I didn't think it had gone so far. Oh, Cupid, Cupid!" here she rolled up her eyes, while Lydia again blushed. "But to come back to my ribbons, I'd scarcely venture out with them. Oh, you ain't been long enough in Hart- ford to know whlat asses the people are. Why, they hardly dare breathe after the sun goes down on the seventh day for fear of breaking the sabbath, and although the huskings they give are pleasant enough, they'd be ten times jollier if I had my way." "Pray, what changes would you introduce?" in- quired Nancy. "Why, Miss Clark, I'd let the young folks dance, that's what I'd do!-give them more liberty, and there'd be less sinning. As it is, they kiss and dance on the sly, behind barns and haystacks, and when they're out after huckleberries Then, when they go home, they put on faces a yard long and look as if their souls were made of starch. Why, even this is condemned"-drawing from under her apron the volume she had hidden when her visitors had entered--" and yet it's next to the Bible in wisdom." Lydia now for the first time in her life beheld a   278      ROMANCE OF THE copy of Shakspeare, and opening it at the dog-leaf found that the widow had been reading the " 5Merry Wives of Windsor." Nancy, who knew that it was a forbidden book, shook her head and was almost regretting that she had introduced Lydia to such a person as the widow, when suddenly the latter, turned towards her, and grasping her hand: "You'll .not tell on me, Miss Clark?" she said, "oh, do not." "Nobody shall hear about your Shakespeare," replied Nancy, "but  " "Never mind, never mind," continued the dame, "don't begin to lecture me. Besides, aint you a sinner too'? Ha, ha! Mr. Barebones will be after us both afore long. I know he misses you at meeting. He's always pryin' into other folks' busi- ness, and if he keeps on much longer I'll just sell out and move to Rhode Island, where they're more liberal. God bless Roger Widliams!"Here she drew her sleeve across her eyes, then thrusting her hand into her pocket, pulled out a small piece of rope which smelt strongly of tar, and gazed affec- tionately at it. "Oh, if my dear old man was livin'!" she sighed, "he'd not let the ruling elder worry the life out o' me. This, girls, is a relic of the Polly Ann, which foundered off Cape Cod last winter a year. It has a perfume sweeter to me than roses; its tarry odor   a CHARTER OAK.             279 brin:.:s my husband right before me again." Here she pressed it against her nose, then offered, it to Nancy and Lydia, who each in turn took a whiff. Presently the former made a move to depart. The truth is, she was not a little scandalized by the widow's conversation, and deeply regretted the ef- feet it might have on her friend. Mrs. Bull urged them to stay awhile longer, but Nancy refused, and  entwining her arm in Lydia's, withdrew. But be- fore they reached the door, Mrs. Bull managed to rise from her chair and overtake them, and then for the third time whispered something which made the regicide's daughter blush. "I tell you he's melancholy because he's a bach- elor," said the dame; "but Cupid's at work, he'll change it all." With this they separated, and Lydia, as she walked off, could not help thinking that the settle- ment would be a much pleasanter place to live in if there were more such characters as the one they " had just parted from. Their round of visits was now completed, and all who had been asked to the husking had signified gj a willingness to go except Nancy, and Lydia was determined not to return to Mr. Wadsworth's until i j her friend had given her a definite answer, as to whether she would be there or no. It was not, how- ever, until they reached the gate in front of her fa-   ROMANCE OF THE ther's house that the young woman finally consent. ed. "Yes, I will be there," she said, as she turned and entered the little boxwood path; "I promise you I will." Then walking away, No, I cannot believe it," she murmured, "no, no, I cannot." CHAPTER XTT. LYDIA, as we remember, had concealed the map of the colonies under her bed and we cannot won- der if this large, ghostly mansion seemed more ghostly than ever since her strange discovery in the garret. She was not, it is true, of a nature to yield lightly to superstitious fear--her joyous temperament would have revolted at such a thing; nevertheless she was human and even the brightest of us feel at times that there are moving around us beings invisible to mortal eye, and that the spirit world is very close to mother earth. "Yes," thought the girl-as, tired out with her round of visits, she entered her apartment and looked to see if the map was where -she had left it-" there is something mysterious about this house, I would not be astonished if the chart were gone." But no, there it lay. Just then one of the horse shoes hanging at the bed-post fell to the floor with a clang, and from every part of the room, the   CHARTER OAK.            281   dormer window, the ancient chest, the chair in which the Wadsworths seemed fond of dying, there came answering clangs. "I don't think I ever could like this abode," she said, replacing the charm; "no wonder my host rarely smiles; I'm thinking I'll become gloomy too if this is to be my home." Presently, her eyes rested on the piece of furni- ture which she had christened the "dead man's seat," and as she gazed at it wished that she had strength enough to carry it up into the attic where it would be out of her sight. In the meanwhile Miss Crabtree was at work below, and as the dame bustled about she was revolving'in her mind whether it was not unwise to nurse her wrath against her young guest. If Nancy Clark were to appear at the husking, might not Goody Garlic keep an eye upon her and perhaps hinder her from speaking to Wadsworth ? " Yes," said the old maid, "it's foolish to stay in a miff; I'll ask the girl to come down and help me." With this she went to the foot of the staircase and gave a call. The shrill voice passed by the bed-room door, then up into the garret, where it died away among the rubbish and rat holes, and so exactly did it chime in with Lydia's feelings, that the latter half believed it was the voice of a witch. The girl did not obey with much alacrity, and it was not until Prudence had seconded her friend's request that she prepared to    282      ROMANCE OF THE descend, taking with her the map, which she re- gretted not having before restored to its owner. Miss Crabtree met her at the foot of the steps, her hands and arms white with flour and her mouth set in its own peculiar grin. "Honey," she exclaimed, " don't be angry with what I said to you, this morning; you're a dear good girl, and I want you to help me prepare the cakes and tarts for to-morrow; Prudence says you're right smart at cookin'." With this, she pressed her lips to Lydia's forehead. "I'm hasty, dear, Iknow I am," she continued, " but you mustn't ' mind me; I'm not as bad as I seem. If you want Nancy Clark at the husking, why let her come, I'll give her welcome." Softened and dedeived by these words, Lydia immediately put on a greasy apron which the old maid handed her, and tucking up her sleeves, prepared to lend her assistance at the oven. Bunt presently, remembering the map, she excused her- self, then without waiting to' knock, entered the library, where she found Wadsworth busy looking over a pile of letters, which he pushed aside as she appeared, and with a smile asked what book she had come to read. - But scarcely had the words passed his lips, when his countenance assumed an expression of awe. "Where did you find that?" he whispered, point PI   CHARTER OAK.     - 283 ing at the map; "oh! you cannot tell how its dis- appearance has worried me." "I found it, sir, in the garret last evening," answered Lydia, " and beg pardon for not having restored it sooner." Here the Captain gazed steadfastly at her for nearly a minute, then seizing her hand, " I feared Iliss," he said, in a voice, low, yet full of earnest- ness, " I feared the mysterious Power which had given me the map, had taken it away as a warn- ing. But no, no, I was mistaken; my good angel--' With this he suddenly paused and let her hand fall. "'No," he murmured, "I will not tell her all that I feel, it would be breaking the law --I have not yet asked her father's consent." The girl, with a deep flush on her face, for the eyes of her host were piercing her through and through, and revealing his thoughts as plainly as if he had spoken them, now withdrew to the other room, glad to escape from the singular being, who at one time appeared to avoid her, at- another to draw her to- wards him, and wishing, as she had already so often done, that Wadsworth might have proved to be the stranger whom she had met in the forest. While she was at work helping MAiss Crabtree, the Captain would every now and then open the door and take a peep, while Miles would thrust his head out too and sniff the air; but she did not al-   284      ROMANCE OF THE low this to distracts her-steadily she worked, and before the clock struck eleven the whole floor, from the east window to the cupboard on the (other side of the room was covered with pies. There were pumpkin pies, of course, and apple pies, and peach pies, and mince pies, and grape tarts, and cakes in numbers infinite; while the flour barrel, which at first had been full to the brim, was now so empty that you could see the bottom. During the hours they were thus employed, making ready for the morrow's cheer, Mr. Clark and the British officer were seated in front of a roaring fire, cracking nuts aud talking about the husking party, which Nancy on her return home, had told them was to be given the following evening. "I should have forbidden nmy daughter to go," said Mr. Clark, "as Wadsworth and I are not on speaking terms, did I not hope that she might be able to gather from those whom she will meet there some information which would prove useful to Sir Edmund. Verily, Nancy is playing her part well; her new friend, it seems, came this morning on purpose to invite her."  Should Miss Clark not object,' returned Henry Synnot, "it would give me  great pleasure to be her escort. I  told his Excellency I might not ie- turn to Boston as quickly as last time, so a little delay will cause no surprise."   CHARTER OAK.        285 At this remark Mr. Clark could not conceal his satisfaction; he rubbed his hands and chuckled. "If imy daughter's not a downright fool," he said to himself," she'll encourage our guest in his attentions; so far, everything looks bright." Then, as he threw another stick of hickory on the fire, he told the officer that he would see much to interest him at the husking, where he would have an opportunity of meeting a large number of people together, and might give a better report to his Excellency as to the sort of men the royal troops would have to deal with, in case matters came to a crisis. "You'll be astonished," he added, ' at the inde- pendent tone which many of them hold towards Enigland; one might imagine there was no such being on earth as King James. But disguise your- self, sir, as my political opinions are well known; otherwise, seeing you and my Nancy together, they might not be so free of speech; nay, they might ,even use violence towards you." To this the Captain raised no objection, albeit the disgust he was beginning to feel for the service he was engaged in, was not lessened thy his host's proposition to enter Wadsworth's house, seemingly at least, in tie character of a spy. But Lydia Goffe would be there, and his desire to speak to her once more smothered every other feeling. She-   286      ROMANCE OF TIIE was, it is true, the daughter of a regicide. '"But after all," thought Synnot, "what her father did was for the good of England. I begin to wish our present monarch had a few such brave hearts to raise their voices against his tyranny. Unless King James alters his course, I would not marvel if ere long we had a change of sovereign; and be- tween the going out of the old, and the coming in of the new, these colonies may manage to secure their independence. If that day ever arrives, woe to men like my host." Were he to disguise himself, however, it would be necessary to do so with the greatest skill, as the letter which he brought from Andros had been delivered to Governor Treat that afternoon in the General Court Chamber where many of the towns-folk had had a good look, at him. It was accordingly agreed that he should wear an old wig which hadi. belonged to his host's father. "I defy the keenest of them to recognize you," said Mr. Clark, " when you have it on, and I'll add to it a deerskin jacket and trousers, and a pair of heavy top boots." "Clumsy things to dance in," rejoined the officer. "To dance in! By my faith, sir, that is an amusement unknown from the Hudson river to the farthest limits of Maine. Dancing! ha, ha, Iha! you might more easily take away their charter than   CHARTER OAK.       287 prevail on these Puritans to imitate King David in that respect, although they pretend to have such a great reverence for scripture." "Well, if I had an instrument to play on I would at least tempt them."  "There's a bagpipes up in the garret, left by a re- I  demptioner* who used to be in my service," rejoin- ed Mr. Clark; "you may take it with you if you like, but scarcely with my advice--the shock to these godly folks would be worse than an earth- quake and your life might be in danger." Such an argument only made the Captain, whose % nature was full of fun, more determined than ever to start a dance at the husking. "Dimpled chins are not given to scruples," thought he, " and I know Aliss Goffe will not frown, whatever the rest may do; so I'll risk the anger of all Hartford and take the bagpipes under one arm and Miss Clark under the other. Who knows but even this demure young woman may dance too when she sees the others at it." And so they sat together, smoking their pipes and conversing until midnight. But in Wadsworth's house the lamp was yet burn- ing when the clock struck one, and as the sound died away, Miss Crabtree turned the flour barrel * One whose services were sold to pay the expenses of his pas- sage to America.   288      ROMANCE OF THE bottom up as a sign that her task was completed. Every shelf in the cupboard was groaning unde) the weight of pies, tarts and cakes, and nobody could say that the oven had not done its duty, But although they were all very drowsy, the dame would not let her companions quit the lower room, till everything had been put away as neatly as if it had been a sabbath morn. Not a particle of any- thing was left o n the floor for the mice to eat; no, not a single crumb. "Crumbs draw vermin," she said, "and them I hate worse than 'pisen;' so, sweep clean, sweep clean!'"Then before she followed them up the staircase, she put her mouth to the keyhole of the study and begged Wadsworth to have the nuts brought down before sunrise. A voice from within responded, "all right," and the good woman turned to depart; but ere she reached the foot of the steps, she halted, and after musing a moment, - went back to the library door, and in a gentle voice said, "Now, Joe, you'd better go to bed, you're suffering for want of sleep; oh, yes, you are." But Wadsworth paid, no heed to her advice and remained writing despatches to the different train- bands of the colony, till the clock struck three. * e ,   eHARTER OAK.       289 -CHAPTER XIV, THE morrow opened -bright and clear, and Mis, (Crabtree, who seemed never to know what it was to feel fatigue, was bustling about not many min- utes after the watchman had sounded his bell. She took a wonderful delight in counting over the pies and cookies, and her nephew, who was down soon after herself, (he had had but one hour's sleep) instead of being allowed to pass the time, until  breakfast, among his books, was sent up into the garret after the nuts, carrying on each arm an im- mense basket; and as there were many such trips to be made before a supply sufficient for the numerous guests could be brought down, he in- wardly resolved, despite any whim of his aunt's to have the nexst crop of nuts placed on a lower floor, It 'where they might be more easily got at. The whole day was one of preparation. Charity, who never seemed to think the house clean enough, had the poor servant-maid on her knees scrubbing, hour after hour; the tiniest cobweb was brushed from the remotest nook,' and it was a woeful day for the spiders, while Miles Standish could only find peace by keeping close to his master. The windows were washed and rubbed, and rubbed and washed again, until-but for the sun, which insisted   iui      IROMANCE OF THE on sending in its beams-you might have fancied it was raining hard. Towards her nephew's study many a longing glance did the good woman cast. It seemed a shame that he should not allow it to be thrown open for the use of the company. But Wadsworth, in all other matters willing and obedient, stood firm on this point, and the only person besides himself who was given the key of the room during the day, was Lydia. But the girl merely arranged his books and dusted the table, then came out, obstinately refusing to tell the aunt aught about the mysterious apartment. Every person who went by the mansion stared hard at it, for the news of the husking had spread far and wide, and it was considered the greatest event, not of this year only but of the past five years. All Hartford believed that the Captain was at last going to .take to himself a wife. "This party," said Faith Genness, she who had approved of Lydia's curls the first day the stranger had appeared with them on Main street, "is given to bring the courtin' to a head. Shouldn't wonder a bit, if we watch sharp to night, we'll see Captain Joe poppin' the question."! "Well, I wonder how old, Miss Garlic is?" said Dorothy Philbrick, who- was out walking with her friend, and like the latter drawn towards the north end of the town through sheer curiosity. ,                 .   GR CHARTER. OAK.               291 , Looks is deceivin'," answered Faith, "but I guess she's older than what you or I be, judgin' from the size of them curls what she wore t'other dav." "Can't judge by that, Faith, for we ain't never been let have our'n grow. Guess don't take many  seasons for 'em to reach the waist like hers did." "Well, I wish we was let'have 'em." "So do I," rejoined Dorothy, " and I thought so the first time I saw this girl with 'em on, but I didn't like to own up. And what's more, a few rib- bons would do us no hurt either." "Nor short sleeves, Dorothy, at least on the Sab- bath, and they might let us dance once in a while, say on Thanksgivin' day." "So they might; I know I'd be a better Christian if I didn't have to look so godly; bein' and lookin' is two different things. It's time our laws were changed; there's too much of this ducking-stool business, and settin' folks in the stocks every time they go a mite out of the way. I wish our ruling X  elder would move to some other town; it's he causes all the bother. He seemstobe everywhere at the j^ Ssame time, and came mighty near catching Tom Hubbard and me kissin' last fall, when we was out nuttin, and. in a spot, too, where I'd have vowed no eye but God's was watchin' us." Here they both stopped and gazed at the Wadsworth mansion, in   292       ROMANCE OF THE the open doorway of' which Lydia and the- Captain were standing side by side. "She looks like a bold piece," said Faith. "And I'm glad of it," answered Dorothy; "Wadsworth's marriage may bring about a great change in Hart- ford. I can't believe she'll bend to our strict ways; and if she once gets her husband from, under the thumb of Increase Mather, whom he considers the best and greatest man on earth, then we gals may have a chance at ribbons and short sleeves. Cap- tain Joe's influence is about as great as Israel Barebones'; there's nobody can speak so well at town meetings; he's popular with everybody, and I can't help thinking if he once sets his face against our foolish laws, that they'll be repealed." "Be not too confident of a reformation," said Faith, " self-willed as Miss Garlic appears, she has already submitted to the loss of her curls." "Ha! a! a piece of female art," pursued Dorothy; when she gets Captain Joe fast hooked, take my word for it she'll let 'em grow again." With these remarks, they continued their way along the street, while at the same moment Lydia and her host withdrew from the porch and went into the barn, which, like all such structures in New England, was joined to the dwelling-house by a shed. There a redemptioner was busy piling on the threshing-floor the corn which was to be husked   liCHARTER OAK.                293 that evening, and after the girl had watched him a- moment and satisfied herself, from his fat and jovial face, that he had a kind master, she turned - and gazed up on the lofty rafters, then on the moun- I E tains of hay, and straw, and corn-stalks, which stretched away in the shadowy distance, and she al- i  most wished she might live in the barn instead of ' 'the house, it did look so comfortable. "The swal- lows," she thought, " must certainly be fond of the place, the whole roof is dotted with their nests." "Wi Presently she began husking an ear of corn, and (  as the Captain watched her his heart throbbed, but he said nothing-the laws of Connecticut forbade courting a maiden without first asking the parent's consent, and as he had not yet done this, he felt that it would be more prudent not to trust his tongue too far. Once, while he was watching  her, he struck his hand upon his brow, theh turned round and muttered something, which, to Lydia's ear, sounded very strange indeed., "Why do you haunt ime?" he whispered, "begone, begone." His face at this moment was terribly agitated, and when he again rested his eyes upon her, there was a fire in them which went to the girl's very soul. Oh! it was a great relief when the voice i of his aunt was heard calling him away. At length evening approached, and the nearer the sun got to the horizon, the more fidgety did   24 -      ROANCE OF THE          J Miss Crabtree become; at least once a minute she wiped her face with her apron, then felt to see if her top-knot was all right. , "I hope everything will go off well," she mut- tered, pinching the arm of the unfortunate servant girl who had thrown herself in a chair, not because  she was tired or lazy, but because there was really  nothing left for her to do. The drudge winced under the infliction, but did not utter a word of complaint, for she knew her mistress was not angry and that this was only a way she had of getting rid of her superfluous energy. At length the sun disappeared, the chickens flew up to their roosts, and Charity and her nephew be- gan to make the final preparations for the enter- tainment. From the lower beams of the barn   ? six lanterns were swung, to the no small astonish- S ment of the rats and mice; while the corn was ar- ranged in a great heap at the further end of the : flboor, and near by were placed several bushel H baskets, which were to distribute it among the : huskers, who might arrange themselves as they  i liked best, but were to work until every golden ear should be divested of its covering, after which they might retire into the house, and then the feasting ; would begin.                    Charity had certainly done her part well. From the south window to within a foot and a half of   CHARTI'lt UAA.  ,    "v. her nephew's study, was a long, narrow table, laden with everything which a New England housewife of those days could furnish, while under the staircase she had made the redemptioner place the cider barrel, with a tin mug dangling from the spigot, and next to it a smaller cask, which her nephew had preserved from his father's store of wine. "It's good," said the dame, as she -drank off a glass of the latter, " very, very good." Presently a glow appeared on her wrinkled cheek, and she was strongly tempted to take another sip; but fearing lest it might give a bad example to Lydia, she withdrew from the barrel, saying to herself, "verily, Scripture is right; wine maketh. the heart glad." Colonel Goffe, who was determined not to be al- together shut out from the feast, had been ushered by his host into the library, where his daughter had made him as comfortable as possible, and it  was agreed that at certain intervals during the eve- ning he might take a peep at the company. Between the chimney and the oven was a pile of wood, enough, one might have supposed, to last a week; but remember, the chimney was immense, and the draft up it something wonderful. "That hickory was cut three autumns ago," ex- claimed the aunt, glancing at the servant maid's [I arm, (the poor creature was rubbing the spot which i      .0   YIb {ROMANCE OF THE had been pinched a few minutes before,) ha! won't it blaze." With this, Miss Crabtree retired to her bedroom, and when she again made her appearance, she was indeed a sight. Her top-knot which had been elevated about two inches, was crowned by a spotless lace cap, and she wore a bran new gown n of a dusky color, interspersed with tiny, yellow  flowers, probably meant for dandelions, and which covered her throat well up to the chin. Prudence was likewise attired in her best, and l so was Lydia, who had spent at least a quarter of an hour viewing herself in the mirror, and who had sighed a very deep sigh for her lost curls. It - was seven o'clock when the first guest arrived, and by the lugubrious voice which answered the Cap- tain's greeting, it was easy to recognize who it was. Mr. Barebones looked even more solemn than usual, owing to a long prayer, which was only just finish- ed, and in which he had implored the Almighty to give him strength against Satan, who during the next four hours'would no doubt make a vigorous attack upon him. His middle finger, cold and deathke, was held out for each of the household to shake, and when presently he caught a glimpse  of the wine and cider barrels, hid eyes rolled up un-  til they rested on the pumpkins and catnip over- head.-"Lead me not into temptation," he prayed, "Lord, Lord give me strength."   CHARTER OAK.       297 Soon after the ruling elder came the tithing-man,. whose solitary eye, which had taken in at a glance everything the spacious apartment contained, sparkled and danced, and seemed unable to keep fixed on any object longer than a second at a time. Both his hands were stretched out at once, the left grasping Lydia, the right Captain Joe, while his clothes (albeit not an every day suit) exhaled an odor not to be mistaken for anything else than leather. "As an old friend, let me congratulate you, Cap- tain," he whispered; "better late than never." Then in his bluff, jovial way he told the regicide's daughter how much pleasure her visit had given his wife and children, who begged that it might soon be repeated. "Even the robin," he said, "has been merrier since you came." After the tithing-man, and at an interval of about five minutes, Mrs. Bull arrived, quite out of breath, for she was a woman of corpulent habit and unac- customed to walking such a distance, but her face was all smiles and her lips were trying hard to say something. As she threw herself in the chair which Lydia hastened to offer her, Mr. Barebones' grey eyes began at once their inquisitorial work. Of all the females in Hartford, not one had caused him half as much anxiety as the widow, and he dreaded lest there might be something about her ,   298      ROANCE bF THE dress which would scandalize. But although he searched her fromn head to foot, not a single ribbon could he discover, and when he had tho- roughly satisfied himself that she was attired in a becoming way, a look of unfeigned delight broke out on his countenance; for by nature he was not a cruel man, and whatever harshness he had at times exhibited towards sinners, arose from a pure desire to benefit their souls. Lydia now entered A into conversation with Mrs. Bull, but to the ruling elder's grief it was carried on in such a low tone that he could make nothing of it. "We've both had to toe the mark," said the widow, smoothing down her dress, and slightly ad- vancing one of her feet, which were small and well- shaped, and there being no law prohibiting it, she was not unwilling to have them admired. "Your curls and my ribbons would drives the company wild," she whispered; " but when I re- turn home I can rig myself out as I please, but you Miss, oh! you will never behold your tresses again!" "Be not too confident of that," rejoined Lydia, "stirring times may soon be looked for, and with political changes I hope to see a reform in other things." While she was speaking, she saw the widow's eyes flash-the latter had just discovered Israel Barebones watching her.   CHARTER OAX.       299 That man's my horror," whispered the dame, for an instant returning his gaze, then looking at the girl--" he's dying to know what we're talking about; and if it wasn't for the rest of the folks he'd come close up and listen." -"Well, I don't like him either," answered Lydia. "And that makes you and-me greater friends' pursued the other. "The Lord knows how soon we may need each other's sympathy. Oh! if my poor, dear husband were only living 1" Here her bosom heavecld, andcl instinctively she drew from her pocket the tarred relic of the Polly Ann. Lydia could hardly help laughing when she saw it, while the ruling elder opened his eyes wider and wider, and advanced a half step nearer the chair. But quickly the rope was thrust back into its hiding-place and he was left to bite his lip and groan. Just at that moment a number of other guests arrived, and Miss Crabtree; who had no idea of letting the widow keep the girl all to herself, in- terrupted their conversation by gently drawing Lydia away towards Dorothy Philbrick and Faith Genness. The reputation which these two young women had acquired, was really something to be envied. So demure were they on all oncasions that some people doubted if they ever smiled, much less laughed like other girls; never had their noses t' w -   300      ROMANCE OF THE been tickled for falling asleep during meeting; they sang the hymns with the liveliest zeal; in fact so perfectly had they retained their baptismal in- nocence, according to Mr. Barebones, that the latter had insisted on christening them "the cherubs." And now, when the good man saw Lydia brought towards them he clasped his hands, while his lips moved in silent thanksgiving. "This Miss Garlic," he said to himself, " wh om our'host is evidently bent on marrying, is full of spirit and talent, and if she keepeth on the righteous path her influence for good may even exceed my own. Oh Lord! give her light!" The company numbered by this time forty or fiftfy, and the old-fashioned clock gave warning that it was time for the husking to begin. Accordingly, at a signal from the Captain, they all filed into the barn, Miss Crabtree alone remaining behind with the servant maid. Soon five, then ten, then twenty more guests made their appearance, and the aunt, with very little -ceremony, bade them at once join the others-" and make haste, friends," she cried, "the wine is spoiling to be drunk, make haste with your work." Never had the lofty roof of the'barn sent back such merry echoes as it did during the next hour; the cat was fairly frightened out of its wits and went to seek refuge in a neighboring edi- fice, and we cannot believe the Captain's horses   CHARTER OAKR.       301 and cattle enjoyed a very profound repose. The baskets, as fast as their contents were husked, were brought by Adams .(who had taken on himself this part of the work) back to the pile of corn at the further end of the floor, filled again, and returned to the laiughing, singing groups, who were doing their best, for they knew that the sooner they com- pleted the task, the sooner the feast would begin. Wadsworth sat on Lydia's right, while on her left was Jacob Japheth, and opposite them, her gown spread over four sheaves of barley, was the jovial widow Bull. Faith Genness and Dorothy Philbrick had each a beau of their own to crack jokes with, while even Israel Barebones was beginning to be carried away by the tide of merriment, and chatted with Pru- dence, whom to his great edification he found to be a person of very strict principles, and who approv- ed of the shepherds of the flockinspiring'the law- givers. But while each set of huskers had their own stories to relate, their own rosy-cheeked maidens to keep the eyes of the young men from wandering away to other groups, there was one spot towards which everybody occasionally glanced. "He's hooked, isn't he?" whispered Dorothy. "Aye, and it's a good fish she's caught," replied Faith; "no wonder they both look happy this eve' [    302      ROMANCE OF THE ning; as for the Captain, he's changed completely since she came to Hartford, and I for one am glad of it." "So am I," rejoined Dorothy, with perhaps not quite as much candor as her friend, for Wadsworth had at one time inspired her with a hope which now, of course, was dead and buried Everybody entertained the same opinion as the Cherubs, re: garding the happy pair ; even the most jealous and  disappointed among the girls putting a good face  on the matter, and looking as joyful as did the for- tunate Lydia herself. The heap of corn must have been almost half husked, when Miles, who till then  had been lying quietly near his master, suddenly sprang up and gazed towards the entrance of the : shed which led into the house, then bounded for- ward, wagging his tail in a dozen person's faces, and almost putting out one of Mr. Barebones' eyes. In another momeit Nancy Clark appeared, looking  somewhat bashful, and as she stood hesitating about advancing further, her pale cheek flushed, while all  eyes were directed towards her. Lingering half a step behind, came a man with very red hair, trim- med after the fashion of the Puritans, and clad in an ordinary deerskin suit, while hanging across his  shoulders was an instrument as strange to the as- sembled company as his own face. In an instant Wadsworth had left his seat and was greeting :i !   CHARTER OAK.      'U6 Nancy, concealing by a powerful effort the emotion which he felt, and as he touched her hand, there was even a faint smile on his lips. But oh! if his heart could have been laid bare, the tithing-man would have ceased his jokes, and the widow Bull would have discovered that others beside herself had their miseries, that a conscience burdened with a ghostly memory was something more terrible to endure than the prying eye of a fanatic ruling elder. While Wadsworth stood facing the young woman, Ihe was for an instant tempted to throw himself on his knees and ask her forgiveness, and before all the company to renew the solemn vow he had once taken. ' She alone," he murmured, "knows the covenant I have made with the Almighty. She was willing to say, 'Go, Wadsworth! if by not mar- rying me the Lord will prosper the noble end you have in view, I cheerfully give you up, but in my heart I will cherish you forever and forever!'" While these burning thoughts rushed upon him, Lydia approached and gave her friend a kiss, and lo! at the sight of the regicide's daughter another change came over him. The same irresistible passion which had seized him the first moment he had laid eyes upon her, returned with all its fury; his cavernous eyes flashed darker file, his whole frame quivered. In the meanwhile Nancy glanced at the stranger, whose elbow was now   304      ROMANCE OF THE touching Wadsworth. She was evidently enmbar. rassed, and no wonder, for she was a scrupulous person and could not bear to tell an untruth; yet how fulfil her fthei2r command unless she did? Her escort was to .be introduced under a false name, and ever since Mr. Clark had given her this in- struction she had endured no little mental agony, and had she dared defy- his wishes would have dis- appointed Lydia and stayed away from the husk- ing. Henry Synnot, who shrewdly guessed the cause of her trouble, with the coolness and tact which had already rendered him so invaluable to Andros, introduced himself to Wadsworth-"I am, sir," he said, " a stranger to you, but knowing your hlos pitality-" Here Wadsworth waved his hand. "Enough, enough," he exclaimed, " you are accompanied by Miss Clark, that is sufficient introduction." Then, laying his fingers on the bagpipes, " but pray, sir, what have we here?" "Something which I am fond of using at gather- ings like this," replied the officer. "Wait until the corn is husked and the feasting begins; then I will show what use I make of it." With Miles rubbing his shaggy,coat against her frock, Nancy now accompanied Wadsworth to the spot where he had been sitting when she appeared.   CHARTER OAK.       305 Captain Synnot pretended that he was trying to follow, but managed to trip over the leg of one of the guests, and as he rose to his feet, rubbing his knee, he whispered' to Lydia-"I am the one who saved you from the wolves, but do not show that  I you know me." Startling as these words were, the girl did not make any response, nor even manifest the least astonishment, but simply led him towards Jacob Japheth and the widow Bull; then putting an-ear   of corn in his hand she bade him set to work. W "When we have finished husking," she said, in a calm tone, " there is to be a feast ; till then make up for lost time by following my example see, there are yet five baskets to husk." It was just as these words passed her lips, that Wadsworth, who had conducted Nancy to a seat, turned to see what had become of her, and had Lydia gone on talking with Synnot his suspicions might perhaps have been aroused; but when she handed the stranger an ear of corn and made him a sign to begin and work, he concluded that she had only been asking some question aboutr the queer-looking object which was slung over his shoulder. "Yes," thought Wadsworth, "Miss Goffe is not bashful with any body, she never needs to be introduced." In a few minutes they were all busy again; the   306      ROMANCE OF THE only person who did not husk quite as fast as be- fore being Lydia, who seemed overmuch absorbed by the bagpipes, while occasionally her eyes would steal up a little higher and rest on the new comer's face. The latter, however, did not notice her in the least, but lhaving arrived late, seemed as if he were endeavoring to do as much work as possible. The chief of the train-band examined him closely and observed that his hands were not like those of a husbandman or hunter-they were too soft and white; yet the way in which his hair was cut stamped him as a Puritan, and this was enough to have quelled any suspicion which might have arisen in Wadsworth's breast, while to complete his dis- guise Synnot had shaved off his moustache, and now wore a thick beard of the same hue' as his hair. The scrutinizing glances of the master of the house did not escape the eye of Nancy Clark, and while she was endeavoring to appear an in- terested listener of the widow Bull's stories, her pale cheek grew paler. It terrified her to think of what might follow, should the British officer be re- cognized by any of the company, many of whom had doubtless been present in the General Court Chamber, when he had delivered to Governor Treat Andros' letter. They would, of course, take hil for a spy, and then to what extremes might not their wrath lead them? But it was Wadswortfh's   CHARTER OAK.       307 i indignation which she most dreaded; his esteem she would not have lost for the world. What would he say, if he found that the stranger whom I^! she had brought to his home, was in the service of the King?"Better," thought Nancy, " that the z;t floor and the earth under it, should open and X  swallow me up, than have such a thing happen." :  Thanks, however, to the skill with which Synnot was X:'f disguised, her host did not suspect anything and ?'  soon his gaze was fixed on the regicide's daughter, i? i: whose cheek, unlike her friend's, was now burning B^:: red. Had the unknown been drawn to the husk- ing party, in order to meet her' again? Lydia was asking herself, or was he a lover of Nancy Clark?"This is not unlikely," she thought, ",for i1  lhe. is no Puritan, and, from what I have heard, :W Mr. Clark-is not one- either." Right glad was she E  'when the last basket was emptied and the task i^  finished, for she hoped during the feast to have an Xi  opportunity of speaking freely with the unknown. But no sooner did the company rise to their feet than Wadsworth placed himself at her side, much to the regret of Henry Synnot, who was thus com- pelled to be Nancy's escort. As they filed through the shed into the house, they were greeted by Charity Crabtree, who with as pleasant a smile on her face as she could possibly assume, bade them choose their places at the table and be merry. ,i.   308      ROMANCE OF THE "Aye, folks," she exclaimed, this is my first jolli- fication 'in Hartford ; but please God it shan't be the last; eat and be merry-eat and be merry!" Presently her excitement got the better of her judgment, and she burst into such a fit of laughter that her nephew was quite taken aback, for during all the years she had been with him she had never given way to a similar flow of spirits. Oh! had the patient servant-maid dared, she might now have taken sweet revenge for the many pinches which her mistress had given her, by revealing something which would have caused the good woman to fall immensely in the esteem of the mul- titude--that tell-tale drop on the spigot of the wine barrel had not been there five minutes before. While Miss Crabtree was clapping her hands, in rushed the guests, jostling one another good-natur- edly; Tom Hubbard had fast hold of Dorothy Philbrick's wrist, while Faith Genness made believe she was trying to escape from a burly lad, with a face shaped like a full moon and burnt to the color of a brick; but he clutched her gown with a grip of iron and would have ripped it off rather than let Faith get away. The sea-captain's widow, puff- ing and pressing her right hand on her bosom, came next, escorted by Mr. Japheth, and as soon as she caught a glimpse of the good things which   CHARTER OAK.       309 loaded the table, her eyes darted from dish to dish, while her hands began to open and shut. Present- ly aiming her finger at a huge roast turkey, " that's the ship I want to board," she gasped, then catching her breath, "Lord, how the folks is pushing," for- getting that she herself had trodden thrice on the heels of the person in front of her. Alone, and with folded arms, Israel Barebones brought up the rear of the procession, or rather the jolly mob. The happier the rest of the company became, the greater efforts did he make to repress any sign of mirth in his own breast, and if occasion- ally a smile would break out on his face, it quick- I  ly disappeared and was followed by a frown and a groan. At this very moment he was lamenting the harm which would come to the souls of Faith and Dorothy by being brought into such close contact with Tom -Iubbard and the lad with the moon face; while as for the way the tithing man was carrying on with the frivolous Mrs. Bull, it was simply scan- dalous. The dame, it is true, wore nothing on the present occasion which could give offence; but then the whole community knew her character, and the ruling elder would have wagered his salvation that her pockets were at this very moment stuffed with ribbons. "Narrow is the path which leadeth to Zion," he groaned, just as the widow arrived   310 .     ROMANCE OF THE at her objective point--the roast turkey; " however, let us hope she may not be damned!" Standing on Mrs. Bull's left, and opposite Wads- worth and Lydia, was Simon Adams, and by the way the fellow stroked his shaggy beard, you could see that he was in a quandary. On which of the many dishes ought he first to pounce?"Simon, Simon," exclaimed the widow, nudging his elbow, "you that's famous for saying long graces, why don't you begin and say one for us all? or does your piety afore meals come by fits and starts?" "How do you know I ever say grace?" whispered the tavern-keeper; " lifting up a fellow's eyes is no sign of godliness. But if folks thinlk it is, why, let 'em think so; I humbug 'em and edify 'em at the same time. You know that it's necessary if you live in this community to appear godly, even if you ain't." "Oh, you wicked man! give me a piece of the dark meat and some stuffin'," rejoined the dame, laughing and pushing forward her platter. The publican helped her as she requested, then, instead of beginning to eat himself, remained with both hands leaning on the table, while his eyes slowly moved from right to left, then from left to right-their vibration bounded on one side by the turkey and on the other by a huge sirloin of beef;   CHARTER. OARK,      Ol and thus he stood for more than a minute, nor did he open his lips until the widow again nudged him,. "What ails you?" she exclaimed. "Are you really mad, as some folks say you be? Here am I waiting for the side bone; every second precious, for somebody else may grab it, and you looking as if you were in a stupor. What ails you?" Presently the tavern-keeper drew a long breath- his consciousness seemed - to return. "Dreadful to   be in such a fix," he sighed, " yes, dreadful; if one X  dish was just a mite further off than t'other, I *2 could decide which to begin on. But being right 1:  exactly atween them both, it's puzzling, damn puz- zling.' Here Mrs. Bull gave him a pinch.  " Don't swear so loud," she whispered, "there's the ruling elder eyeing us." "And what do I care if he is?" growled Adams, helping her to the morsel she coveted, then darting his fork into the beef. And so they went on chat- ting and devouring the good things set before them, and it is scarcely necessary to add that the feast was relished by all; even the solemn Mr. Barebones presently took his eye off the widow and ate his full, and when the last pie had disappeared, his countenance was much less stern than when he had arrived. The table was now removed into the Woodshed, the dishes hastily put by in a large bas-   312     .ROMANCE OF THE ket, and the real fun of the evening commenced. A score of pewter mugs which Wadsworth had procured from the tavern, were brought out of the cupboard, then waving his hand toward the bar- rels under the staircase, he begged his guests to taste of their contents. "One's wine, t'other's cider," exclaimed Charity, handing Goody Garlic a cup of the grape juice, "we'll sip out of this mug together"-then lowering her voice, "Prudence, 'twill make you feel as if you were in Zion." We need scarcely say that the merry crowd show- ed no backwardness in following the old maid's ex- ample, and in less than five minutes the conver- sation and laughter had so increased that one could hardly hear his own voice. But of a sudden, it all died away and every eye was directed towards Miss Crabtree. "She's going to perform her great feat," whisper- ed Jacob Japheth, to the widow, " not another soul in town can do it." Hardly had he spoken when the silence was in- terrupted by a shout and a clapping of hands and Tom Hubbard grew so excited that he jumped into the air and pulled down on Dorothy's head a huge bunch of catnip. In the midst of the confusion and hubbub, Charity was standing near the oven, her hands on rr   CHARTER OAK.       313 her hips and with a cranberry fastened between her nose and her chin, and in that position she remain- ed until some of the people laughed themselves into 1 hysterics; then tossing back her head, she opened her mouth and down went the berry. During this interesting performance the door of the study l- had opened a little, just enough to allow the regi- cide to take a peep, and when he withdrew his head ithe old gentleman laughed as heartily as any of them. Up to this moment Israel Barebones had heroically kept the resolution he had made when b he arrived and not touched a drop of liquor; his arms were folded on his breast, and in a corner by himself he was wrestling with the devil, who during the past quarter of an hour had made a violent as- sault upon him. At length, however, the sight of the wine proved too much for even him to with- stand, and striking his forehead he advanced ex- citedly into the middle of the room, where Mr. Japheth hastened to offer him a tankard. For a moment the ruling elder held it to his lips then shaking his head, he turned away his face and groaned. But presently he brought the cup back to g his mouth and with a trembling hand and an in- describable expression; as if agony and mirth were J contending for the mastery, he took a long draught. j "Well done old boy," cried Mad Adams, who had   314      ROMANCE OF THE just taken a sip out of the widow's mug, " yes, well done, feasting is better than fasting." It was at this part of the entertainment that Lydia, taking advantage of Wadsworth's attentions to Mr. Barebones, glided up to Henry Synnot, who till now had been engaged in conversation with Nancy, and gave himn the opportunity to address her, for which he had been so impatiently waiting. "I'm well disguised, Miiss Goffe, am I not?" he whispered.  "You are indeed, sir," she replied, "yet even without that horrid wig, I would still have to call you the unknown, for you did not tell me your name the evening we so providentially met." "Providentially! ah, so it was," rejoined the officer, musingly; "God be thanked, it was a happy, happy Providence! Bless the wolves for driving such game towards me." At these words Lydia colored. "It is but fair," he continued, " that I should reveal who I am, we will thus be each the keeper of a secret, for nobody here knows me except Miss Clark." "Dear Nancy!" murmured Lydia, " oh! you are safe in her hands." "You and she are warm friends, I believe?" (We are." "Well, I agree with you, Miss Goffe, she looks like a person one might love and trust; but for   CHARTER OAK.       315 all that, beware of what you tell her concerning yourself. Her father has great power over her and is even now setting her on your track." "Ah, indeed! well, I know he is one of the King's partisans, nevertheless I afm fond of his daughter and believe she returns my affection, and will be- tray, not even to him, aught she may discover con- cerning me. But now, sir, let me hear who you are?" "My name, Miss, is Henry Synnot; I belong to the staff of Sir Edmund Andros, and am bearer of dispatches from him to Governor Treat. This very day I should have returned to Boston, but I want- ed to meet you again." "Dispatches from   Andros! Alas, I fear their contents bode evil to Connecticut; I regret that you are engaged on such duty." Here the officer bit his lip. "Is your heart in the work?" continued Lydia. "You must pardon much to circumstances, Miss Goffe," he replied, after a little hesitation; "I could not refuse to obey orders." "No, true ; but you might abate your zeal, do as little as possible, be in less haste going to and fro. This colony is in a sad strait ; however, if the worst comes to the worst, even the women will fight." "And if they do, 'twill be all up with the King's   316      ROMANCE OF THE party," rejoined Synnot; "you alone would be a tower of strength.." "You are sarcastic, sir," said Lydia, drawing back with a haughty glance; " but may my arm be para- lized if it does not rise against the British troops when they come to rob us of our charter!" ' Oh, be not offended, Miss, I spoke in earnest; a maiden like you would be a greater obstacle in Sir Edmund's path than a regiment of men. And now let- me confess that the duty on which I am en- gaged is most distasteful, and that the King's policy towards New England is one which I do not in my heart approve."  At these words the girl again drew near to him, while the crimson on her cheek deepened. "i May I not in time win him over to the glorious scheme of independence? Then the barrier which separ- ate us will be removed," she thought, gazing at him with an expression in which Henry Synnot fancied he read more than her words had yet re- vealed. Presently he drew from his breast a minia- ture on which he gazed for an instant, then placed it before her. The regicide's daughter started, it was her own image  Just then Israel Barebones, who, during the past few minutes had been coming gradually nearer, bent down to inspect the portrait, but the officer quickly snatched it from Lydia's hand and hid it again in his breast.   CHARTER OAK.       317 "'Tis the likeness of a relative of yours," he whispered, after the ruling elder had turned away: "' her name was Elizabeth Churchill," "Indeed! my cousin! father's sister married Sir William Churchill; oh I would like so to know her, where is she? In England, I suppose?" "In Heaven!"  replied Synnot. "But when I look at you, I see her again." Once more Lydia colored, while the officer gently took her hand, and he was yet holding it when Wadsworth approached, his heavy eyebrows lower- ing, for Israel Barebones had been whispering something to him. "Unbearable," thought the chief of the train- band, "that -this red-headed varlet should so en- gross Miss Lydia's attention. But what can I do? It is possible, as my friend has just hinted, the girl and he have met before." As this suspicion oc- curred to Wadsworth, a noise was heard in the pas- sage way leading to the outer door--it was as if something heavy was being rolled along, and in another moment Mad Adams appeared, push- ing in front of him a barrel and calling& out to the company to clear the road. "A present, Captain Joe, a present," exclaimed the honest fellow; "I could not let this joyful occasion slip by without giving you something out of my store of liquors." As he spoke he gave the barrel a shove with his   318      ROMANCE OF THE foot, and sent it-to the consternation of Tom Hubbard, whose toes it almost crushed-under the staircase, where it came to a halt beside the other barrels. "I wager," continued the publican, " that it's better than the wine you've been drinking, al- beit your's is a mite older." "No wagers!" said Israel Barebones, in a tone of authority, and pointing towards King Charles' twelve good rules. "Lay no wagers!" echoed Jacob Japheth, " but by fair trial let us decide which merits the palm," This proposition met with the approval of all the guests, who without a dissenting voice declared that the ruling elder and the tithing-man should form a juryv. Mrs. Bull patted Jacob Japheth on the back and urged him to fill his tankard at once, while Miss Crabtree and Goody Garlic gathered around Israel Barebones and pressed him to let them know which wine was the best. "I won't believe there's any as good as my Joe's," exclaimed the aunt, " until you, Israel Barebones, ruling elder of the first church of Hartford town, declares that there is; so let's settle the matter without delay." The cobbler did not need any pressing; by his twinkling eye you could see that he entered heart and soul into the fun of the thing. Israel Bare- bones, however, appeared confused, he had already   CHARTER OAK.       319 imbibed full as much as one unaccostumed to any- thing stronger than milk could stand, and he felt that he had reached the turning-poin t where one draught more would plunge him headlong into the devil's clutches, But the clamor which arose to have him serve as juryman drowned the voice of conscience. He glanced at Wadsworth; but the latter, to whom it was evident that the spirit of the company was be-  yond his control, made no sign to him, he did not even pull his sleeve. Slight as such a warning would have been, it might perhaps have recalled the good man to his senses, and enabled him to beat off this last terrific onslaught of Beelzebub. As it was, he heard only the cry, "Yes, yes; de- cide, decide!"' And so, with Miss Crabtree on his left and Prudence Garlic on his right, he advanced towards the barrels, feeling like one about to take a plunge into the water from a dizzy height. "God knows how it will all end!" he murmured. Then clasping hiis hands he gave a groan-some- body had yelled out "Hallelujah!" and the word for a moment seemed to arrest him in his fatal course- but it was only for a moment. Tom Hubbard, who had uttered the exclamation, made haste to turn the spigot of Adam's barrel, and in less time than it takes to relate, Israel Barebones had swallowed half the contents of his mug. Once more the door *  320      ROMANCE OF THE' of the library opened and the regicide peeped out, and when it closed again you could hear the old soldier laughing heartily. "( Can't you tell at once which wine you prefer?" said Wadsworth, frowning at both the jurors-he was beginning to dread a scene of scandal. "Well, I forget which I like best," replied Mr. Japheth. "Verily, and I am in the same quandary," said Mr. Barebones, hiccoughing, " we must try once more." "Yes, do," exclaimed Tom Hubbard, who was on his knees between the barrels, with one hand on the spigot of each, and exchanging significant winks with Adams. "Judging from present appearances," whispered Henry Synnot to Lydia, "the company will soon snap their fingers at the law, and then will be my opportunity." The girl gave him an inquiring look. "I mean," he pursued, " that I'll treat them to a dance." The jury now tasted for the third time of each cask; Miss Crabtree and Prudence continued to laugh at everybody and everything; the widow Bull fairly roared; Tom Hubbard whistled; and the lad with the moon face gave Faith Genness a kiss. Wadsworth alone remained as he had been from the beginning of the feast, thoroughly self- possessed, while his lowering brow showed how   A UAR'TE O'E AK.     OJL greatly he was provoked at the turn which affairs had taken. Suddenly, the bagpipes began to play. "A dance!" cried Tom Hubbard, jumping to his feet. "A dance, a dance!"- echoed a number of other voices, and amoibng them you could distinguish that of the widow Bull, who was making mysterious signs to Jacob Japheth. Nancy Clark now shrunk back into a corner with distress plainly marked on her countenance. The regicide's daughter, how- ever, did not share her friend's scruples and was the first to accompany the musician into the barn, slipping her arm through his as they went along, and singing a merry Scotch ditty, which her father had taught her. They had almost reached the threshing floor, when she felt some one pulling her sleeve, and look- ing round, found Nancy close behind her. "Be- ware of your companion," whispered her friend, "he is not what he seems; beware of him." Then, before Lydia could say a word in return, the young woman was lost in the throng, which was rushing pell mell after them, and what with the shrill notes of the bagpipes, the clapping of hands, the loud barks of Miles Standish, you might have supposed that Bedlam had been let loose. Wadsworth's lip curled with indignation as he saw his guestsdis- appearing, treading on one another's heels, and   322      ROMANCE OF THE really looking like tad people. But what could he do? "What a shame! the whole township Fill ring with accounts of this husking party," he muttered. "Will Dr. Mather, whose ears it will be sure to reach, believe me when I tell him that what has happened this evening could not have been pre- vented?"Wadsworth did not notice Nancy as she slipped across the threshold trembling, poor girl, at his dark look, and fearful lest he might call her back to question her about the stranger whom she had brought under his roof. But mingled with his wrath was a feeling of profound regret. -Lydia, the maiden whom he admired so much, was she the innocent creature he had believed her to be? Had his eye deceived him, or had she really coquetted with the homely, red-headed varlet?"Alls! for two long hours, to him, and to no one else did she open her lips," sighed the chief of the train- band; then, unfolding his arms and clenching his fists--" but 'tis a mystery which, by the Lord, I will make clear." At this moment the door of the library opened and the regicide for the third time peeped out, the sudden silence had astonished the old gentleman. "All gone,'" he whispered; " pray tell me what has happened, Mr. Wadsworth, you look troubled." "My guests, sir, are in the barn, breaking the law   CHARTER OAK.   .    323 by an unhallowed amusement-they are dancing!" returned his host bitterly, and laying stress on the last word. "But pray do not leave your hiding place; there is a guest amongst them, he who plays the music, whom I mistrust; remain concealed, I beg you-the fellow's glance is rapid, and I have a strange foreboding that his presence here may bring us evil." While these remarks were passing between them, two grey eyes were peering in through the west window, and could you have caught the expression of Mr. Clark's face, as he discovered the regicide, you might have supposed that Nancg's father was a fiend, whose soul was for an instant lit up by a hellish joy. "Aye," said he, rubbing his hands, "'tis Goffe, as I live! a little older than when I found him concealed at Captain Bull's, some years ago, but 'tis he, I could swear it." Presently, the door of the study closed, the face disappeared from the window, and with slow step Wadsworth passed into the barn. When he en- tered, the scene was if possible more animated than it had been at any other part of the evening. All except the musician and Lydia were dancing in two long lines facing each other, with the pile of corn between, and on top of the pile sat the un- known and his fair companion. "Mr. Wadsworth," murmured a voice a little in   324      ROMANCE OF THE his rear, "Captain Joseph Wadsworth, Satan hath conquered!" The master of the house glanced round, and there, half buried among the sheaves of barley, one hand pressing his forehead, the other beating his breast, lay the ruling elder. This spectacle capped the climax of our host's indignation, and turning abruptly on his heel, he made his way out into the open air, careless whither he went, and not for one, nor two, nor three hours, but till the dawn appeared in the East, did he wander about like one distracted. And when at length he re-entered his home, although the party had broken up, he still fancied he could hear the horrid squeal of the bag- pipes, and the hilarious tones of the widow Bull as she went through the figures of the hornpipe, op- posite Jacob Japheth; and as he lifted the latch, and passed into the now silent mansion, he- half believed that a witch had been throwing a spell over him. CFTAPTER XV. THE morning after the husking party the watch- man rang his bell at the usual hour, but for the first time in her life Miss Crabtree felt a yearning desire to lie abed. There was a strange, throbbing   CHARTER OAK.      325 sensation about her temples, and as she raised her- self on her elbow and tried to shake off her drow- siness, she gave a loud yawn which ended in a groan. "It was a jolly frolic," she said, " but if all the -folks what was here last evening feel as I do now, there'll not be much scrubbing and churning done in Hartford to-day"-then clasping her hands- "Oh my!" she continued. "I hope I've been dreaming! But no, it can't be; alas! I remember it all too well-Satan got in amongst us. Aye! that'stranger, whom Nancy Clark introduced, was the old boy in disguise. Wherever she goes she brings some mishap." As the remembrance of the dancing thus flashed upon the good-wife she be- came thoroughly aroused and for more than a min- ute sat up in bed, shuddering over the possible con- sequences to herself and her nephew. What would be done to them? But presently her countenance brightened. "Aye," she said, "Israel Barebones was with us, and although he didn't dance he took more wine than was good for him, and he must bear his share of the sinning." Then rubbing her hands gleefully-" he's our ruling elder," she con- tinued; " ha, ha! pretty nigh the whole congrega- tion is in the same scrape, ha! ha! ha. Devil or no Devil, 'twas fun!"While these thoughts were passing through her mind, she heard some one   326      ROMANCE OF THE moving in the room below. "That's Joe," she said, "making the fire; he's always saving me as much work as he can, may the Lord bless him and give him luck in his courtship. And yet--" here she frowned, then leaving her couch, "a handsome girl,"- she murmured, "is Miss Lydia; but per- verse and giddy, and if she fall, as I fear she may, under the evil influence of Nancy Clark, my Joe might as well give up all hope." Miss Crabtree now gave the servant-maid a call, in a voice which warned the drudge that there was no alternative but instant obedience; then hastily putting on her gown she was in a few minutes de- scending the staircase. On arriving below she found the fire. lit and her nephew standing with his face towards it, holding in his hand a stick of hickory, which he threw on as she approached, then turned and faced her. But he did not greet her as usual, and even when she bade him good morning, he re- mained silent. Already the good woman had felt some misgiving as to the mood she would find him in, after the events of the- past night, and conse- quently this behavior did not surprise her. "But then," she thought, placing her hand on his shoul- der, " he's as much to blame for the dancing as I am, and so he needn't be in a huff. Dear knows, neither of us could have stopped it, once it had be-   CHARTER OAK.       327 gun." Then in a gentle voice, "Joe, Joe," she said, what ails you?" ' With a look almost of despair, Wadsworth fixed his gaze upon her. "Aunt," he said, after a moment's hesitation, " aunt; pray that I may see the light. Oh! I fear I am standing on the brink of a precipice." Then, without another word, he entered his study, and turning the key, knelt down and began a prayer. But it was not the reproaches of his conscience for the law-breaking of which his house had been the scene, which drove him to his knees. Dancing he knew was a grievous sin, but what weighed on him so heavily was the conduct of the regicide's daughter, which, ever since his re- treat from the husking party had worried him, un- til now he was half distracted and he felt like one in a wilderness, uncertain which way to go to reach a place of safety'. "May be," he said, "'twas a special Providence which sent that stranger here, in order that I might see how little the girl cares for me. Lord! Lord! keep me from breaking my covenant-Oh God! give me light." Just as these words escaped him there came a tap at the door. He stopped and listened. Pre- sently there was another tap, then a voice which lie could not mistake, for it was sweeter to his ears than any other sound on earth, bade him open.   328      ROMANCE OF THE "I do not want to disturb you," said Lydia as he obeyed her summons, " but only to let Miles join his master; the poor fellow has been -whining to enter, how came you to forget your shadow?" "Something else engrossed my thoughts, Miss,"' answered Wadsworth coldly, and with an expression that would have repelled any other being but the one he was addressing. Without saying more, Lydia gave the dog a pat on the head and with- drew, half resolved never again to seek admission into the library. Presently, Wadsworth joined her in the other room, but instead of following her every moment with his cavernous eyes, as he had hitherto done, he stood gazing at the fire and mut- tering something which might have been a prayer. "Strange man!" thought Lydia, " strange man! It may be a hard fight to escape you, especially if father wishes me to become your wife, but your gloom would weigh me down like a mill-stone; no, no, it shall not come to pass." Here she turned towards the south window, and gazed a moment in the direction of Mr. Clark's house, which, even if the day had been farther advanced, she could hardly have distinguished, standing as it did at the other end of the town-but now in the twilight she gave full rein to her imagination. "I wonder," she asked herself, "if the British officer has yet started back on his way to Boston?   CHARTER OAK.       32 r He told me he would leave at an early hour. Oh i I'm glad the day promises to be fine. And yet if it snowed, or rained he might postpone his journey and then I might see him to-day. Now, it may be months before he returns." Could Lydia at this moment have been trans- ported to the parlor of Mr. Clark's mansion, she would have heard an interesting and important conversation in which Henry Synnot was taking part-one, however, that would have made her tremble. There, side by side, sat Nancy's father and' the officer, the latter booted and spurred and warming himself at the fire before starting on his long and tiresome journey, while his host was smiling and cracking his knuckles, a thing he never did unless in very good humor. "Oh, it was a great discovery;" exclaimed Mr. Clark, a great discovery, " and you must be proud to carry the news to Sir Edmund. High ought to be our reward, if we cage the bird. He escaped me once, but I'll be more wily this time; yes, the regi- cide is old, and by the short glimpse I had of him, I could see that he is infirm. He'll not flee into the wilderness again. Really, sir, you must spur your horse and come back as soon as possible at the head of a troop, and then Goffe will be a pris- oner. The Hartford train-band has brave men in   330      ROMANCE OF THE it, but a score or so of red coats would put them to the right-about." While Mr. Clark was speaking, the officer con- tinued to warm his hands, occasionally nodding as if he approved of what was said, yet without opening his lips further than to exclaim, "Oh, yes," --"indeed,"-"a great discovery." The truth is, his contempt for Nancy's father had been gradually in- creasing, ever since the latter had revealed to him his plan for getting possession of the land which the town of Hartford had voted for school purposes; but this last scheme crowned Henry Synnot's in- dignation, until now he felt like telling the speaker to his face, what a contemptible being he consider- ed him. "And yet," thought Synnot, " am I not very inconsistent? To arrest Goffe must surely be my duty, at least while I am serving the King." Here he again nodded, as if he approved of what Mr. Clark was telling him, then drew on his gaunt- lets. "As for the conduct of my daughter, sir," pur- sued his host, "I humbly apologize for it. She meant no disrespect, but doubtless grew confused by the music and the dancing; otherwise she would certainly not have returned home at such an early hour, and without her gallant escort. Nevertheless, I will speak to her about it, and give her a repri- mand."   CHARTER OAK.       331 "Pray, do no such thing," rejoined Synnot, ab- ruptlfy; " the guests were very noisy, the room un- comfortably crowded, and I can well excuse Miss Clark for not having remained until the entertain- ment broke up. Rather ought I to ask pardon of her for not having accompanied her home, and were the young lady present I would certainly do SO," "Well, well, then I'll not mention the subject," returned Mr. Clark, " yet I wonder she did not stay until the end, it must have been so amusing." "Well, it was a funny sight, and one which I'll not soon forget, and I'll wager many of the guests have headaches this morning." With i this, the officer turned and went out on the porch, where his palfrey was waiting for him, and springing into the saddle he was much inclined to depart without further ceremony, when Mr. Clark overtook him and offered his hand. For a moment Henry Syn- not hesitated whether or no he would give his host a farewell grasp.-the misgiving which he felt as to the treatment Nancy might receive after he would be gone, tempted him to be rude to her cruel parent. He overcame his aversion, however, after a struggle, and they parted with every sign of good will, Mr. Clark assuring him as he moved off, that he would be as watchful as a lynx, as cunning as a fox-   332      ROMANCE OF THE "and do you hurry back," he added "with the troops." Such were the words which passed between Nancy's father and his guest, while Lydia was gaz- ing out of the window this morning, and while Wadsworth stood near her, wrestling with himself and praying for strength to keep his vow. CHAPTER XVI. DURING the week which followed the husking, Wadsworth made several attempts to engage Lydia in serious conversation; for although he had de- termined to conquer the passion be felt for her, yet his interest in the girl's spiritual welfare prevented him from holding entirely aloof, and there were other books besides the Assembly Catechism which he wanted her to read. Yet, whenever he would beckon her to enter the study, Lydia would assure him that she had something to do, either at the oven or up in her bedroom, then with a half sup- pressed smile she would turn away and leave him, to mourn over her indifference in regard to church matters. "And yet," he would murmur, withdraw- ing alone into the library, " it is not poor Nancy who is leading her astray. No, in spite of wliat   CHARTER OAK.       333 my aunt says, Miss Clark is at heart a good Christian, and I am sure I have guessed the true reason why she absents herself from meeting; yes, her father has made her his slave.  Oh Nancy! may God one of these days'deliver you from your cruel parent and may I resist the great temptation! Oh, Nancy! I am sure you are praying for me." Miss Crabtree of course did not fail to notice Lydia's behavior toward her nephew, and Adams, who passed three evenings with them-to his own pecuniary loss-for the tavern always suffered dur- ing his absence-was much annoyed by it, too. Hea likewise wondered at his chief for not pressing his suit with more ardor. "Aye," he growled, "Cap- tain Joe ought to take her by storm. If he don't, she won't be long in becoming Mrs. Somebody- else." Once he ventured to urge Wadsworth to broach the subject to Colonel Goffe, whose authority over his daughter was unbounded, while at the same timre her obedience and reverence for him had al- ways been most edifying. But the Captain's sole response to this suggestion had been a shrug of his shoulders. Through the week Lydia made several attempts to find her friend -Nancy; but not once did she * meet her in the street, and whenever she approach- ed her home, Mr. Clark was sure to be standing on,   334      RO MANCE OF ThIE the porch with his sinister face warning her away, and consequently she never ventured nearer than the outer gate. Again the Sabbath came around, the rigid New England Sabbath, bringing with it a soft, balmy air and a blue sky. But in the town of Hartford not a sound was heard, even the dogs did not bark, nor did the geese cackle as on other days, and you might have thought they were vying with the in- habitants to see-which could be the best Puritans. The morning meal-prepared the evening before, so as not to break the Lord's day by working ever so little--had just been finished, and Lydia was about withlldrawing to her room to make ready for church, when the door of the study opened, and Colonel Goffe, who, like herself, had been told he might go there, at his pleasure, made her a sign to enter. The girl obeyed, and as she passed in, Miss Crabtree's countenance, which until now had been as grave as if she had been at a funeral, suddenly brightened, while her eyes gave a significant glance at her nephew. But the latter appeared not to notice her. He had only left the library a few minutes before, and was now walking up and down the apartment, his arms folded on his breast, and talking to himself. "Perhaps," he was saying, "perhaps my aged guest has heard me regret his daughter's unwillingness to own the covenant, and    CHARTER OAK.       335 has called her into my sanctum in order to give her some religious instruction. May he succeed where I have failed!" Little did Wadsworth guess the subject of the regicide's conversation with -the girl; little did he know that his aunt Charity, at the instigation of Mad Adams, had had a private interview with the old gentleman on the subject 6f matrimony. "She is an obedient girl," whispered Goody Garlic to Miss Crabtree, " and will do any thing he bids her." "I hope you may be right," murmured the other, who since the husking party had not been so con- fident of her nephew's obtaining the prize, which she hoped and believed he had set his heart upon. "But, Prudence, she's a willful critter and I'm afraid will have her way in spite of the ten com- mandments. However, I've taken the liberty to speak to her parent on the great question, and until I hear the result of the interview I'll not give up hope." The regicide, having seated himself, eyed his daughter a moment in silence, and on his counten- nance there was the old stern look, which had so often darkened it when he was in Cromwell's army, but which Lydia did not remember ever to have seen there before. One of the girl's hands was  ,       .   336      ROMANCE OF THE clasping the other, her head was slightly bent and she looked sorely troubled, for she suspected what was coming.- All the lessons which Goody Garlic had taught her since infancy, urged her to submis- sion; but her heart bade her remain true to the vision in the forest, and at this moment Henry Synnot rose before her with a life-l4ike reality. The spot upon her hand where his lips had pressed, burned with a sweet and holy fire, while in her ears she heard again all the enchanting words he had spoken at the husking. ( Lydia," began the Colonel, "I have summoned you here for the purpose of talking over a very im- portant matter-the abruptness -with which I intro- duce it may startle you-it's nothing less than your marrying our host. Have you ought against him which might prevent such a happy event? For my part, I urge it with all my heart and soul." A deep silence followed-Lydia appeared thunder- struck. "Speak, child, speak," continued the old soldier at length, knitting his brow. "Is not what I ask a most reasonable thing? Have H not left my hiding-place in the forest in order that you might have an opportunity of finding a husband? and is not our host worthy of your choice? He is rich, he has, I do believe, a great career before him: he loves you, and although he has not spoken to me on the subject, he wants to marry you, I know   CHARTER OAK.       337 he does. Why then do you repel him every time he makes the -least advance? Speak, child, do not irritate me by your silence." But Lydia's lips remained closed, while her bosom heaved. "My daughter," pursued the regicide, after an effort to preserve his calmness, "unless you con- form with my wishes, we must soon return to -the log cabin. It would not be proper for us to con- tinue always under Mr. Wadsworth's roof, for I be- lieve, from what I know of his temperament, that it woild drive him mad to have you always near him, and yet not able to call you his own., Oh, child, think of my ending my days in the solitude we have just left! And then, what would be your own fate? Does it not seem the hand of Providence which has guided us both hither-me that I might eud my days 'in comfort and peace, and you, that you might find a husband? Poor lonely bird that you were, far-up the Connecticut! Lydia, Lydia, many a time have I wept to think of you dwelling among wolves and panthers." A tear trickled down the old gentleman's cheek as he uttered these words. It was a sight the girl could not bear without crying-herself, and falling at his feet she bowed her head and sobbed aloud. "Oh, father, father," she cried, " what can I do? I want to obey but "   338      ROMANCE OF THE Here grief drowned her voice, while Colonel Goffe reproached himself for having spoken so harshy. "Father," she exclaimed at lengtlh, and looking up at him through her tears, "I have never con- cealed anything from you, why should I? no, no, I *never will."' - Well, my daughter, if there be any good rea- son for rejecting the Captain, pray reveal it ; I may then perhaps be less astonished at your conduct. The reason, however, should be weighty, ave, very weighty. Why, I venture there is not another girl in Hartford but would rejoice were he to offer him- self; come, don't cry any more, but tell me what you have against our host." "Well, father, he's a very godly man, no doubt, and I hope the Lord may prospet the great- scheme of his life, the independence c hiese colonies, but  " "Well, child, but- but what? Here. you arc praising him, now what strange ending will yoaix sentence have?" "But, father, if I love another?"The regicide started-here indeed was a piece of news to make him lift his eyebrows. "Love another!" ho exclaimed-; but, dear me, where have you met. auy one else except Mad Adams?"Then, after a pause, during which he   CHARTER OAK.       339 shrugged his shoulders, "Yes," he went on, "I forgot; you have been a few days longer in the settlement than I, and have of course met other inen besides Mr. Wadsworth. Oh, Goody Garlic, Goody Garlic! why did you not look better after your charge?" "Don't blame nurse, father, no, do not." "Well, if I find the gallant who has stolen your affections is worthy of you, I may have no cause to blame her, though he addressed you without first asking my leave, as required by the laws of the commonwealth. But tell me who on earth is he?" This was the question which Lydia had so dreaded he would ask; it is not therefore surprising if she hesitated with her answer--it was the most trying moment of her life. Her father repeated the ques- tion. "He is an officer in the British army,'-she re- plied at length, and lowering her voice. "There, you have my secret, all my secret; ah, it is one I would not reveal to any other being on earth, but you." If the old soldier had been astonished to learn that his daughter was in love with another -man than their host, imagine the effect of this, her second announcement. "An officer in the British army! Child, are you    340      ROMANCE OF THE sane?" he exclaimed, starting and clasping his hands. "It is true, sir, it is true ; I said I would conceal nothing, and let me add, it was he who saved me from the wolves when we were on our way to Hart- ford." "Here the regicide murmured, "God bless him!" then for a moment buried his face in his hands; "How strange," le thought, "how strange the ways of Providence! Here am I a fugitive with a price set on my head, concealed under the roof of Joseph Wadswortth, and my daughter in love with a man, who mayhap has been sent to these parts for the very purpose of searching for me." Lvdia now went on to assure her father that there was no danger of any harm coming from her meeting with the officer. "Well, child," he said, shaking his head, "I hope not. As for myself, I am old, my days will soon be over, and it would matter little if I were appre- hended and carried to England for execution ; but for all the world, I would not be the cause of bring- ing trouble on him who has so generously offered us the shelter of his roof. Thank God! before leaving home you took an assumed name." At these words Lydia turned deadly pale. Oh! what an unspeakable relief it was when presently she heard the church bells ring. It gave her an   CHARTER OAKX.       41 excuse to bring this trying interview to an end --she must make haste and prepare for meeting. Colonel Goffe saw that she was anxious to be off, so, without another word, he kissed her and she hastened out of the room. ' CHAPTER XVII. "YDIA, with Prudence Garlic on her right and MVliss Crabtree on her left, sallied forth to meeting, this morning, with very agitated feelings. Her ex- pression, however, was very gratifying to one of the old maids, who highly approved of her gravity, and as they walked along towards the meeting-house, Charity expressed a hope that before long she would own the covenant and become a full member of the fold, and as the girl made no response, the dame concluded that the spirit of grace was silently working within her. "I don't like Lyddy's sorrowful look," whispered Goody Garlic to her friend; "t'was a rash move when you urged her father to speak to her on the subject of matrimony; that's a thinghich always works better when it's left to the parties most in- terested." "What," exclaimed the other, "think you the   342      ROMANCE OF THE old gentleman has been scolding her? 'Why, I at- tributed her demure expression to its being the Sabbath-and so you think she's told him she wouldn't marry my Joe?" Prudence made no answer, but shook her head and endeavored to get rid of the anxiety which was pressing upon her, by gazing at the throng of people, all, like themselves wending their way to church, and who presented certainly a curious and interesting spectacle. Nearly all the males had linen bands of spotless whiteness around their necks, and as stiff as starch could make them, while on their heads they wore the steeple crowned hats of the Pilgrims, and occasionally, one a little vainer than his fellows might have been seen with silver buckles in his shoes, instead of the ordinary brass ones. Farmers on horseback went ambling by, clad in mooseskin coats, and with cowle-shaped hoods drawn well over their faces, while not a few had swords clanking at their sides, the habit of wearing weapons -having been contracted during King Philip's war; and although for the past few years the remnants of the Wampanoags and Narragan- setts had manifested no disposition to molest the settlers, yet ftany of the latter had not been able to give the habit up. . Their wives and daughters, who rode behind them on pillions, carried foot- stoves-a warm meeting-house being an interdicted   CHARITR OAK.       343 luxury-and these little wooden boxes, perforated with holes and containing earthen cups filled with embers, 'would at least keep their feet from freez- ing. Prudence likewise observedthat the majority of the people did not stop at- the meeting house on the green, but kept on towards the church, built, as we have remarked in a former chapter, in 1670, and where those worshipped who preferred the old and'strict ways of the congregational order and deprecated any latitude in the administration of baptism. XWhen they reached the green, Lydia for the first time looked up and as she beheld the solemn faced women patiently seated on their pillions, waiting their turns to dismount at the horse, block, she could not help smiling and thought how quickly she herself would have sprung off her steed, had she been mounted. Presently, she arrived at the door of the church, and was about ascending the steps when she felt somebody pull her sleeve, and glancing round, found the widow Bull close behind her. The good woman was too much out of breath to speak, and her countenance, usually so jovial, looked as solemn as if she had just lost her dearest friend on earth; and yet Lydia fancied that she  could detect a lurking expression of fun in the cor- ner of her eyes. On each of the dame's shoulders was a rosette of green ribbons, at which a crowd of   344      ROMANCE OF THE men and women were gazing, while some shook their heads and openly declared that such vanity merited instant punishment. No sooner did Lydia notice the decorations, then she likewise manifest- ed great astonishment, for she remembered that Mrs. Bull had not ventured to wear them at the husking party; how then did she dare put them on on the Lord's day? The good woman must have guessed what was passing through her mind, for placing her mouth close to the girl's ear- "Since they all sinned that night," she whisper- ed, " drinkin' too much and dancin,' I'll brave 'em now, and wear openly whatever I please." "And I will back you up if they say anything," rejoined Lydia, pressing the good woman's hand; "yes, I will back you up." Amongst those who took scandal at the rosettes, was Mr. Genness, father of one of the Cherubs. "I fear my daughter Faith will be greatly shocked," he remarked to Mrs. Genness. "And my Dorothy," exclaimed Mr. Philbrick, who had overheard the refmark, " will likewise be much pained at the sight. However, I have no fear on her account; but others less inclined to godliness, may be tempted to stray from the path Id simplicity by such an exhibition of dress." "Never let a weed grow to maturity," exclaimed a lugubrious voice: " check it when it is small and   CHARTER OAK.       345 tender, and before it can throw out seed. Aye, brethren, the spirit of vanity must be rooted out at * once." Thus spoke Israel Barebones, whose tall, lanky figure was slowly pushing -its way through the group in the direction of the meeting-house door. He had just reached the foot of the stoop when a shrill voice screamed out-"Who drank too much at the husking?-who, who, who?" TImmediatelyj every face in the crowd was turned towards the spot whence the sound had proceeded; but Tom Hubbard, jr., who was as active as he was saucy, had already run back and mingled with his companions at the rear of the building. As the voice died away the ruling elder bowed his head. "True," he murmured, " true; I sinned and I deserve rebuke"-while the rest of the people, who like himself had been Wadsworth's guests on that festive occasion, felt as guilty as Mr. Bare- bones, and consequently, instead of smiling at what the lad had said, blushed to think of their own transgressions. Yet amongst them all, not one had punished himself for his sins, as he whose head was at this moment bowed in humiliation. Yes, ever since the husking party the ruling elder had eaten but one meal a day, and now, as he ascended the steps of the church, he resolved to increase his penance. "In my bare feet," he murmured, " will I   M46      ROMANCE OF THE chop wood this coming week? yes in my bare feet." Only the widow Bull presumed to smile at what w the lad had said. Oh, it did please her beyond any thing to see one who was forever spying out the faults of others, at last publicly reminded of his own shortcomings. By this time Lydia was inside the church, where she found the sextongiving his last pull at the bell- rope, which hung down in the centre of the build- ing and half way between the entrance and the pulpit. On the right were a number of wooden benches, without cushions or backs, and these, Prudence told her, belonged to the male worship- pers, many of whom were already in their seats; "Iwhile beside the benches a number of little boys were perched on stools, and Lydia remarked that they had been well trained, for not one of them opened his lips, or looked around, or up at the ceil- ing, or in any other direction, but straight in front bf him. The regicide's daughter, still carefully watched by Miss Crabtree, now advanced down the left side of the building, which was devoted exclusively to females, and as she passed by the little girls, who, like their brothers opposite, were ranged on stools, she could not help laughing at the efforts which they made to keep silent. But even in the house   CHARTER OAK.       347 of prayer they could not hold their tongues, while the inborn curiosity of their sex made' their eyes turn upon every body who entered, and quite a tit- ter ran down the line, when the rosettes of the widow Bull appeared in view. Prudence called Lydia's attention to the old folks who occupied the front seats. "Gray hairs first," remarked the goodwife, " while behind them sits the minister's family, the parish committee, whose duty it is once a year to dignify the seats, and the town officers. It's not the richest who hold the choicest places in the house of worship!" In another moment the ruling elder took his place under the pulpit, facing the congregation. and producing the hour-glass, put it on the stand in front of him-it was nine o'clock, and time for ser- vice to begin. Presently, the two deacons appear- ed and dropped upon a bench which was a little in front of Israel Barebones, and like him they faced the congregation; then, after a short interval, came the clergyman, a large, robust man with horny hands and sunburnt visage, which showed that he was accustomed to make his own hay, plant his own corn, and do other things besides preach. As soon as he entered the pulpit, he knelt down and the people followed his example; then, for a quarter of an hour, he poured forth an earnest prayer, which, considering that it was impromtu,   348       ROMANCE OF THE was really very good. Perhaps' the worthy man's grammar might have been open to criticism, but what did that matter, if the spirit of his words went to the hearts of his audience. When he had finished, Mr. Genness rose, and in his capacity of teacher read aloud a chapter from  the book of Kings, stopping often to expound difficult passages. After the lecture there was a stir amongst the congregation, and Miss Crabtree -handed Lydia a copy of the Bay Psalm-Book. "We're going now to sing," whispered the dame, " don't be afraid to let it out, follow my example." Presently, the ruling elder announced that they would  chant the nineteenth'Psalm, beginning, "The heavens do declare--" after which, for about a minute, there was a rustling of leaves, then the people, rising to their feet, sang the following from the Bay Psalm-Book: The Heavens do declare The majesty of God, Also the firmament shows forth His handy work abroad. Day speaks to day, knowledge Night hath to night declared; There neither speech nor language is Where their voice is not heard. eiil   Through all the earth their line Is gone forth, and unto The utmost end of all the world, Their speeches reach also; A tabernacle He In them- pitched for the sun,   CHARTER OAK.           349 Who, bridegroom like, from's chamber goes Glad giants' race to run From heaven's utmost end.

It opened with a threat to sinners of everlasting punishment, then went on thus: "Consider God Himself will be the principal agent in thy misery. He is that consuming fire; His breath is thy bellows, which blows up the flame of hell forever. He is the devouring fire, the everlasting burning ; and if He punish thee, if He meet thee in His fury, He wilt not meet thee as a manl; He will give thee an Omnipotent blow. Little dost thou know what it is to enter the list of contention with the Almighty. "If His wrath kindle but a little while, we wither before it. Now, thou art afraid of the wrath of men; what wilt thou do, when God takes thee in hand? Consider, God will take delight to execute vengeance on thee. "God delights in justice and in executing His own decrees. Now, it was His eternal decree to destroy sinners forever. He purposed to show His power and to make His wrath known upon the vessels of wrath fitted for destruction. "But woe to that soul whom God shall delight to punish. Now, thou laughest at the reproofs which God gives thee by His ministers and people. God will laugh at thee shortly. And wilt thou bear when He shall torment thee, and thou shalt roar under thy torments? Thou shalt cry for mercy, and he shall mock thee. Thou now rejoicest in sinning; He will emn long rejoice in thy calamity." The congregation by this time had become thor- oughly aroused; Mr. Genness' face was the hue of a corpse, Miss Crabtree and Prudence groaned aloud, even Tom Hubbard was slightly affected, and when the minister, who had paused a moment in order to study the effect of his words, went on to describe   CHARTER OAK.          351 Hell, he fixed his gaze upon the lad, and Tom, bold as he was, hung his head. ,' Consider," he said, "what must be thy employment there. -I.-Sin. Some think sinning ends with this life, -but it is a mis- take. The creature is held under an everlasting law ; the damned increase in sin in hell. Possibly, the mention of this may not please thee. But remember, there shall be no pleasant sins there, 'no eating and drinking-(at this last word Mr. Barebones shud- dered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow)-no singing, no dancing, no wanton dalliance-but damned sins, bitter sins, hellish sins--sins exasperated by torments: cursing God, rage, and blasphemy. II.-Thou shalt be delivered up into the hands of thy torment'os ; then Satan will pay thee thy wages for thy service, slavery to him, and thou shalt know what a cruel master thcu hast served. What cruelty has Satan sometimes exercised to some here in this world that have been possessed by him, and to others that have sold themselves to him! What amazing sto- ries doth the world afford of such things! What dost thou think he will do when he hath unlimited commission and full posses- sion? How wilt thou endure when thou shalt have a thousand evils rending and tearing and macerating thee, when all the rage of hell shall fall on thee without restraint? III.-The never- dying worm shall gnaw and eat out all the heart of thy comfort; thou shalt become thy own executioner; thy conscience shall pursue thee in Hell, always crying out against thee, and bring- ing bitter things to thy mind, making thee to wring thy hands, and howl out sad lamentations." Here there was an interruption, which although it lasted only a minute, we will describe to the reader. Ever since the pastor had begun to preach, MHrs. Bull had been gradually falling asleep, until now she was snoring lustily, and Mr. Japheth who had done his best not to notice the scandal by turn- ing towards her his blind eye, saw that he could no longer refrain from   performing one of the duties c]   352        R ROM]tANNCE OF TI E which devolved upon him as tithing-man.    Accord- ingly, with a deep sigh, he levelled at the dame a sort of wand, on one end of -which was a bunch of feathers, on the other a knob of lignumvitse, then solemnly approached her.   Lydia wondered what on earth was going to happen, while Dorothy Phil- brick did- her best not to laugh.   In another mo- ment the feather end of the rod was tickling the widow's nose, and she awoke with a start; but quickly recovering her self-possession, she gave the tithing man such an upbraiding look that the poor fellow turned on his heel and went back with all the speed he could to his station near the door, leaving her biting her lip and murmuring many harsh things of the people of Hartford.   The cler- gyman now took up the thread of his discourse at the point where it had been interrupted, and with his gleaming eyes fastened on Mrs. Bull: "Thou canst hardly sit under one of these lectures," he cried, ' coming from the mouth of a poor minister; but let me tell thee, Conscience and Hell will read it after another manner than can now be conceived ; every thought will be a sharp dagger at thy heart, that will let all joy and comfort out of thy soul; there is no sleeping in Hell. Remember how universal thy torment there shall be. Here, usually, our pain is in but one part of our body; and yet what a misery it is to all the rest, by sympathy; 'but there, soul and body will be filled brimful; the guilt of all thy sins shall be laid upon thy soul, and be so many heaps of fuel; that tender and delicate body shall have all its beauty blot- ted and pride consumed; the flames shall have no respect to its comeliness; every member's pain shall be intolerable and in- supportable misery shall spread itself through the whole man:;   CHARTER OAK.    '      353 there,- eyes, ears, hands, feet, heart and all shall be tormented in the flame. Consider how near the time hastens when all this comes to pass upon thee. Time is almost gone with thee, and thou standest at the gate of eternity, and Death is waiting upon thee to transport thee away to the place of all thy miseries. Shortly thou must die, and it will be but a moment from thence to Hell. When thou hast sinned away a few more days, watched and slept out a few more nights, then away thou goest irrevoca- bly. It may be thou dreamest of many days to come, but, thou fool, how knowest thou but thy soul may be called for this very night? aye, the day of judgment is not far off. Sinner, I be- seech thee realize the truth of these things ; do not go about to dream, that my words are but a vain fable to scare children, nor believe that God has no mercy, because, forsooth, He makes thee miserable. He shall have monuments enough of that precious attribute, shining like stars in the place of glory, and singing eternal hallelujahs to the praise of Him that redeemed them; though to exalt the power of His justice, He damn sinners heaps upon heaps." * When the last words of the sermon died away, a murmur of terror rang through the meeting- house.  Prudence and Charity hid their faces in their hands, Dorothy Philbrick and Tom Hubbard lacked the courage even to glance at another, while Jacob Japheth's usually jovial countenance looked as if it would never smile again. Of them all Mrs. Bull was the only one who seemed quite at her ease; but she was most provokingly calm, and with her eyes turned first on her left, then on her right shoulder, she smiled and began arranging her rosettes, which had got slightly out of place during her nap.  Presently, the teacher rose to offer up the * For above sermon, see Baylies' Hist.

The good man's invocation was concluded in about three minutes, then lifting his hands above his head, he slowly brought them down on a level with his breast and gave the bless- ing, in a tone so solemn and fervent that it went to Lydia's heart as no other part of the service had done. At the end of the prayer, the ruling elder stood up and said: "Brethren, now is the time for contribution, wherefore, as God hath prospered you, so freely offer." At these words, the magistrates first, then Mr. Barebones himself, advanced towards the deacons' seat and. placed their Offering in the wooden box kept there for that purpose. The rest of the congregation followed, each giving what he could afford, were it money or any other article of value; and let us here inform the reader, that the sum thus obtained was devoted to the support of the pastor, and likewise the poor and needy mem- bers of the congregation, should there be any. With tins, the service closed,* and the people slowly made their way out upon the grecn, where many of them turned to watch for the appearance of Mrs. Bull. But the widow did not mind their * For Church service--See Pilgrims, by Cheever.   CHARTER OAK.       355 stare in the least, and returned them such a defiant look that Israel Barebones offered a prayer in her behalf. "Beelzebub hath her in his clutches,' he murmured, "Lord, Lord, deliver her!"Lydia had just reached the stoop of the meeting-house, and to show how little she sympathised with the manners and customs of the Puritans, was about to ac- company the widow a short distance, when she calught sight of Nancy Clark beckoning from across the road. At once, in spite of Miss Crabtree's frown-the dame had intended to escort her home in the same manner she had brought her to church-Lydia slipped away, and in another mo- ment she and Nancy were sauntering off together, arm in arm. 'But instead of keeping along Main street, they passed through the graveyard to the rear of the meeting-house, then turning to the right, proceeded along what was called Mieeting- house alley. "I don't want to be from home longer than necessary," said her friend, "but this lane will take us to the road skirting Little river, and so 'twill not be much further than the way I came." "Why in any haste?" inquired the regicide's daughter. "Let us rather stroll down to the south meadow, which is now bare of snow, and from there we can continue on until we reach Dutch Point; 'twill be time enough then to ascend the stream   356   ,   ROMANCE OF THE towards the bridge, and I will thus be fav-red with your company for a good hour at least." "Nothing would please me more," rejoined the other, "than to be all the time with you, for although we-do not view every thing in the same light, yet I'm sure we'll always be friends." Here Nancy turned toward Lydia with a sweet, though rather pensive smile. "Then, why hurry home? Have you visitors? Is that stranger, whom you brought to the husling, and against whom you warned me, still with yon." "No, he has gone," replied Nancy; then after a pause, during which a troubled look rested on her face, " do you know who he is?" '-I do," replied Lydia; "he is in the service of the King, and yet-would you believe it?-he warned me against one of the King's partisans." "My father?" said Nancy, coloring. "No, yourself." "Oh, he is ignorant of my real sentiments, none love Connecticut more than I; yet I am weak, very weak. Yes, Henry Synnot must despise me 'for taking him to Wadsworth's in disguise. But oh, Wadsworth, Wadsworth, what would you think of me, if you knew it?"Here the young woman buried her face in her'hands. "]But I never doubted you for a moment," ex- claimed Lydia, throwing her arms around her   CHARTER OAK.       357 friend's neck ; " no, not for a moment. You have a difficult part to play, and it is oftern a hard matter to perform one's duty. Go not too far, however, go not too far, remember your country." "But Wadsworth," continued Nancy in a tremb- ling voice, " what would he say, if he discovered that I had brought to the husking an officer on Andros' staff? Wadsworth-whose esteem  I'd rather die a thousand deaths than lose?" "Well, it is something worth having," rejoined Lydia, " indeed it is; and let me say that he thinks all the world of you. He does not include the daughter in his hatred of the parent." At these -words Nancy's breast heaved, and she turned her eyes toward the heavens. "But to come back to Henry Synnot," said Lydia, after a pause, "how soon may he be expected, from Boston?" "I cannot tell,"5 replied the other ; " but when he does arrive, shall I let you know?" "Yes"--and as the regicide's daughter spoke, she blushed. While the blood was crimsoning her cheek, an expression of joy brightened the coun- tenance of her companion; aye, it was clear to Nancy that Lydia had fallen in love with the officer, and the young woman's dread lest Wadsworth might break his vow by marrying his guest, was suddenly dissipated. "And who knows," she thought, "but great good may come from   358      ROMANCE OF THE her attachment to Synnot; yes, it may help New England." Lydia now went on to relate, how several times during the past week she had endeavored to meet her, how twice she had gone as far as her home, but had always been repelled by the sight of Mr. Clark--" who," she added, " appeared to be stand- ing there as if on the watch for somebody; oh, how cross he looked." As she said this, Nancy heaved a sigh, while her countenance, a moment before so joyous, again became downcast. "Pray, why do you grieve?" pursued Lydia. "Oh, it's nothing," replied the other, shaking her head; and although Lydia repeated the question, and urged the young woman to tell what troubled her, she refused to reveal anything in regard to the trea'tment which she had received from her father, and all because she had come back alone from the husking, instead of having remained until Captain Synnot might have been ready to accompany her. No, nothing Nancy ever would say, should let others into the secrets of her home life; if it was not a happy one, she could bear it without a mur- mur. They had by this time reached the edge of the South meadow, and Lydia, who had not been there before, turned to see how the town looked front that point. As she did so, she perceiv'ed Mad ,   CHARTER OAK.       359 Adams some fifty paces away, and at once the sus- picion flashed upon her that he had been following them. "Nancy, Nancy," she exclaimed, "I do be- lieve the tavern-keeper has been dogging our steps -look at him!" "It may be so," replied the other turning round, "for alas, you are aware, that the Captain of the train-band and my father are enemies, and Wads- 'worth's faithful scout is perhaps suspicious of me, and thinks I may do you some harm. I once heard Miss Crabtree tell him that I was unlucky and brought evil to others." "And so my host has sent him as a spy on our movements?" exclaimed Lydia, angrily. "I've a good mind to run up to where he- is and give him -a message for his master." "No, pray don't; stay and let us continue our walk," urged Nancy, grasping her by the arm, for she feared Lydia might really execute her threat. "I can't believe the Captain has sent him after us, it wouldn't be at all like Wadsworth. No, I can't believe it, 'tis Adams' own idea." "Well, was Mr. Wadsworth at meeting?" con- tinued Lydia, "I did not see him." "Yes, he was ; but he arrived late and when the prayer was half through; Adams accompanied him, a thing which pleased me exceedingly, for the latter is not much given to attending worship."   360      ROMANCE OF THE '"Well, then, if they arrived in church together, you can't persuade me that Mr. Wadsworth has not sent his scout to play the spy. Much good will it do him; I would not have thought him capable of such a thing." "But were your surmise correct, dear Lydia, what must you in your heart think of me? Did I not introduce under his roof a British officer in disguise? and the wig adjusted by my own hands! Oh! if father were to bid me perform that duty again, I might not obey; no, no, I would not." Lydia made no answer to this remark-how could she reprove her friend for an act which had a-fford- ed her such an agreeable evening with Henry Syn- not-then, after walking a few steps further, she again turned to see if Adams were still watching them. But the tavern-keeper was walking off in another direction, and at a brisk pace, as if he had seen enough, and were hastening to make his re- port. The two friends now continued their promenade as far as Dutch Point, where they stood for a few minutes gazing across the ice-bound Connecticut, then taking the lane which followed the bank of Little river, they sauntered homeward, each finding a sweet pleasure in the other's company. Nancy especially rejoiced in having at length discovered one who could understand her quiet, retired ways,    CHARTER OAR,       361 and not make gossip about her, and who dared to keep her company despite the ill-will of Charity Crabtree. The friends parted at the bridge on Main street, and Nancy, as she clasped 'Lydia's hand, begged the latter to visit her again. "I feel like a different being, when you are with me," she said. "Do come often, you mustn't mind father. And when spring opens we'll take long walks together, and perhaps/,"here she smiled, "perhaps somebody may again save you from the wolves." CHAPTER XYVIII. AFTER she had parted from her friend, Lydia went back towards the north end of the town, not with her usual elastic step, but slowly and as if she wanted to be as long going over the distance as possible. As it was almost noon, and consequently the hour for dinner, there were very few people in the. street and a silence as of the grave seemed to have fallen upon the settlement; not the bark of a dog was heard, while a flock of geese, which had stretch- ed themselves across the road, did not stir as the girl approached, but kept their heads under their wings as if they knew it was a day of perfect rest.   362      ROMANCE OF THE The windows of the Bunch of Grapes were closed of course-not a soul was lounging on the porch, while from its great chimney not the faintest wreath of smoke was curling. When she arrived at Mr. Wadsworth's, Lydia found the family ready to take their places at the table. Mad Adams was there, dressed in a new suit; while her father, who until now, by the advice of his host, had taken his meals in the library, was standing beside. Miss Crabtree--all were evidently waiting for her to make her appearance before be- ginning the- meal. They knew well enough where and with whom she had been-the aunt, who had despatched Simon after her, having received his re- port and duly informed the household of it--and we need scarcely add, that the dame had seized this opportunity to lecture her Joe on the folly of having invited Nancy Clark to' the husking, and thus increased the intimacy between the latter and his artless guest. And as Wadsworth.' had heard her speaking in such a way, of poor Nancy, he had been strongly tempted to reveal the secret of his vow, and tell his aunt that it was not, as she believed, through that young woman's influence that he had remained, a bachelor; yes, he had been strongely tempted to make this revelation when the truant, at that very moment, entered and broke short the good woman's lecture. The meal   CHARTER OAK.       363 to which Lydia sat down was not as pleasant as usual--the regicide felt depressed by the revela- tion which his daughter had made to him before going to meeting, while Wadsworth did not dare trust himself in conversation with one, whom to sit opposite was trial enough; and more than once he mentally prayed for strength to resist the passion he felt for her. As for Miss Crabtree and Adams, they exchanged significant glances, but did not open their lips, and only Prudence ventured a whisper, and then it was merely to say- "You better not have spoklen toher father about your Joe; the girl can't be forced into anything and it's going wrong, all wrong, I'm sure it is." Whereat Charity frowned and murmured to herself -" it's Nancy Clark's work." Lydia was not slow in remarking the cloud which had settled upon them all, and realized more and more the difficulty of her position; yet how was she to extricate herself? She did not want to marry her host, yet if she refused him, her parent and she would have to go back to the log cabin; for, to remain longer Wadsworth's guest under such -circumstances, would be impossible. Then she thought of Henry Synnot-would he ever find her in the wilderness? and if he did, much as he pro- fessed to love her. and although she felt for him an attachment stronger than for any other being ex-   364      ROMANCE OF THE cept her father, what changes must come about before they could be united! While he served King James never would Lydia Goffe give him her hand. No, never! yet while she thought of Synnot, a ray of light seemed to penetrate the gloom which was gathering in her path -she remembered a few words which he had once let drop. "No, no," she murmurred, " his heart is not in the work. He may not be a republican but he does not approve of what the King is doing to these poor colonies." And thus passed this silent noon-day meal. Then three o'clock came, and the church bells rang again for service, and as- Miss Crabtree heard them she beckoned to her nephew, and for a few minutes seemed to be impressing something upon him witli the greatest earnestness. "If the spirit moves her, aunt, she'll go," replied Wadsworth, "but do not ask me to accompany her; I cannot, I am weak, I dare not trust myself by her side." At this the old maid gazed at him in astonish- ment. "What do you mean, Joe, what do you mean?" she whispered. "One of these days you will learn the truth, one of these days, one of these days," he replied; then turning away-he left the good woman to puzzle over his mysterious answer.   CHARTER OAK.       365 Lydia now got up, and after speaking a few words to Prudence Garlic, went up stairs, leaving the faithful woman shaking her head and beckon- x ing to Charity Crabtree. "Never mind," exclaimed the latter as she put on her hood, "never mind; we at least must not be lukewarm. Lord have mercy on her!"    In another moment the goodwives were walking along Main street, and talking as they went, about Lydia. "Depend upon it," said the aunt, "Nancy Clark has been setting her against my Joe, as well as against our, Puritan faith; ah, wicked young wo- mal!" "Really," said Prudence, " the dear child's con- duct is beginning to worry me; I'm sorry the first sermon she heard did not please her; but for that--" "Tut, tut," interrupted the other, " exactly what she ought to hear every day of her life, I'd like to mix brimstone in her 'wittles'; she needs stirring up; she thinks too little of hell and eternity." Behind them, and at a short distance, Wadsworth followed with Mad Adams, the latter for the first time in many years carrying a  copy of the Bay Psalm-Book-a  sight which greatly edified the honest folk they passed on the road, who saw in the conversion of the tavern-keeper a  favorable   366      ROMANCE OF THE omen for the peace and spiritual condition of the settlement.. Twice or thrice, as the publican re- turned their friendly nod, his eyes twinkled, while a smile played in the corners of his mouth; yet so well did he act his part, that everybody was de- ceived-yes, everybody. "To succeed- in earning an honest penny among these folks," he said to himself, " one must chime in with all their ways, irksome as these may be, and appear as godly as the godliest; it costs no- thing to humbug them. The law forbids selling liquor on the Sabbath, so I may just as well pass the time at the meeting-house as whittling sticks in an empty bar-room. For my long face to-day they'll patronize me to-morrow, so once a week I'll go in for hallelujahs." While he was thus soliloquizing, he heard a voice, pitched in a less mournful key than usual, exclaim, "Good afternoon, Mr. Adams!" the word Mr. being pronounced with marked emphasis. To hear himself thus addressed, electrified Adams, for it was five long years since he had been depriv- ed of that title, and rushing up to Israel Barebones he gave his hand such a squeeze that the good man was glad when he loosened his grasp. Wadsworth, too, felt gratified that one occupying the ruling elder's position in the community should be thus quick to recognize the reform which had come   CHARTER OAK.       367 over the tavern-keeper, and be willing once more to dignify him with the title of ' Mr.' Moreover, it had been through the Captain's influence that Simon had obtained a license to keep the Ordinary, and the cliief of the train-band, consequently, held himself more or less responsible for his frienj's good behavior, and was thus doubly gratified at Ihis conversion. We shall not here enter into the details of a cer- tain event which had happened before the opening of our story, and which had resulted in the Court of Assistcants forbidding Adams to be any longer called 'Mr.' We will merely inform the reader that this punishment had been- connected with a certain town-meeting held in Hartford, at which Simon had imbibed too freely of liquor, and broken -the peace by knocking down the moderator and driving many of the people to their homes. But although, as we have remarked, Wadsworth was gratified by the ruling elder's salutation, he did 4ot open his lips; in fact he seemed to notice nobody, and walked along, as it were, mechanically, and but for his companion pulling him by the arm, he might perhaps have kept on his way and gone to the wrong meeting-house. "I know what troubles you!" whispered Adams, as they reached the green--" well, it's been bother- ing me too. lay heart was set on her becoming   368      ROMANCE OF THE your wife; and now to see her cold, unfriendly manner, is a dreadful disappointment." "In all things behold the hand of God!" mur- mured Wadsworth, "Depend upon it, my friend, everything happens for the best, and yet--" here he drew a long breath and ground his teeth--he was thinking of the stranger whom Lydia had flirted with at the husking. ( And yet," whispered the tavern-keeper, taking up the Captain's unfinished sentence, " 'tis a hard fate to lose such a flower as Lydia Goffe. Oh! if I ,were not the vagabond I am-if I had your op- portunities-if I dared aspire to her hand and she refused me-I'd-I'd--drown myself." i"Hush, do not talk thus at the entrance of the house of God," rejoined 1Wadsworth. "Rather see in all this the hand of the Almighty. For years I have fasted and prayed, and bent all my energies to one glorious end; 'tis well the girl does not take to me, let it serve as a warning; I will henceforth fast and pray harder than ever, and nothing, no- thing shall tempt me again from the path I have marked out." Adams shrugged his shoulders, and presently they entered the church together, but neither of them was in a state of mind favorable to devotion; the tavern-keeper, instead of joining in the psalm, could only grumble about Wadsworth, while the   CHARTER OAK.       369 latter, who was trembling at his own vacillation, did not sing either. "Oh! Lord," he murmnurred, striking his breast, "pity me-I am weak-grant me strength to keep the covenant I made with Thee, and so m ayest Thou give freedom to my native land." CHAPTER XTX. WHTuTrr, Wadsworth, his aunt, Mad Adams, Goody Garlic and the servantmaid were absent at meet- ing, the regicide and his daughter had the house all to thlemselves. As soon as Lydia heard them depart she came down from her -bed-room, fully expecting that the old gentleman would again broach- the subject of her marriage with their host, and unpleasant as this would be, she preferred to have the matter decided:at once, rather than post- poned; and if in consequence of her refusal to take Wadsworth for her husband, her father should resolve to go back to the wilderness-" then," she thought, "thie sooner we leave the 'better; yet 'twill be a heart-breaking thing-my old home ywill not be what it used to be." The change which had come over her since leav- ing the cabin, filled her indeed with wonder. She could not understand herself; she loved her parent   370      ROMANCE OF THE as dearly as ever, and yet since the memorable in- cident in the' forest, but especially since the happy hours passed with Henry Synnot at the husking, the girl had felt that she was a different being. Twice in her sleep she had dreamed of the one who .had, saved her life, and during her waking hours he was constantly before her; indeed it was impossible to drive his image away--alone in her bedroom, or in the large apartment where all the family were in the habit of assembling, she saw only Henry Synnot. On arriving below, Lydia found her father seated byhe window, examining Wadsworth's map, but as soon as she approached he looked up and the expresion of his face touched her deeply--she fancied she could see new wrinkles upon it. "How interesting this is, Lydia," he said, tap- ping his fingers on the map; "I wish we had had one like it when we used to hold our discussions about America." "Yes," replied the girl, "'tis worth coming to Hartford just to study it." "You and Wadsworth hold the same opinions in regard to the colonies," pursued the regicide, after a pause; " your faith in their destiny is the same, and yet-" here-he let the map fall on the floor, then clasped his hands-"is not 'iife a mystery? 'Tis folly to try and shape our own course; an in-   CHARTER OAK.       371 visible power marks it out for us. Who would have believed it?" "Believed what, father?" said Lydia, the color mounting to her cheek. "A British officer," he murmured, "and on the staff of Andros! Well, if he were such as I have known in my day; if he were like some of Crom- well's warriors, I might comprehend it. But serv- ing James the Second, Lord!. who would have believed it?" "I would not have believed it myself a fortnight ago," answered Lydia; " but do not blame me, I am not my own creator, I was born what I am; God knows I have tried to do my duty by you. When I lived in the forest I was ignorant of what my soul could feel; I did not dream I could love anyone but you and my dear old nurse." As she spoke her bosom heaved, but her voice retained its firmness. "Well, child, what am I to do? and what are you to do? After the turn affairs have taken, ought we to accept Mr. Wadsworth's invitation to make this our hiome?" For about a minute Lydia was silent, then in a quiet tone--"wait," she murmured, "wait till the Captain proposes; 'twill be time 'enough then to decide on our course ; as yet he has but asked your permission to court me as the law requires."   37'      ROMANCE OF THE "You are mistaken, child, only his aunt has spoken to me on the subject-that good, loving creature; she knows your real worth." "How! has Miss Crabtree dared take such a liberty?" exclaimed Lydia, her eyes flashing; "I never could bear the woman, now I hate her; and -and-I'll tell her nephew what she's done." "Pray do not, my child, do not. She meant it for the best," said the Colonel, drawing the girl towards him. "Oh,- you should have heard how she praised you. No, do not speak a word about it to Mr. Wadsworth." "As you wish," replied Lydia, making a great effort to calm herself, then, after another pause: i"But if the Captain should offer himself, that'need not oblige us to leave the settlement; there are other roofs in Hartford where we may find shelter, and where you will be equally free from discovery. Yes, father, the widow Bull, if the worst comes to the worst, will again open her door to you, and I am confident that Henry Synnot will give me warning, should there be any danger from Andros' spies." "Amen," replied the old gentleman; "I place myself, Lydia, entirely in your hands--'tis only for you I am concerned." "Yes, trust me, father, and all will come out N,.   CHARTER OAK.       373 right. Already I see my way clearer than I did a short half hour ago." Withl her mind thus made up, the girl drew a chair close to her father, and sitting dcwn began reading Ann Bradstreet's poems ; and she was thus occupied when the family returned from meeting. "'Tis not the Assembly Catechism she's study- ing," whispered Miss Crabtree to Prudence; " oh, fie, fie!"-then turning towards her nephew, she eyed him with a loving glance, while at the same time her heart throbbed, for she hoped he might stop and converse with the girl. But without even lifting his eyes from the ground, Wadsworth passed into the study, leaving his aunt to shake her head and moan. The rest of the day jogged along as quietly as the forenoon; in the house as well as out of doors, scarcely a sound was to be heard, not even the cricket chirped. At length, however, the sun touched the horizon, and Lydia in another mo- ment heard a whistle, then a shout, and hastening to the west window saw Tom Hubbard and a crowd of other lads standing perfectly still, watching the lr)ight orb as it disappeared--but looking as if they were all ready to ki,3k up their heels. "It's down," cried Tom, "it's down; hurrah, hurrah!" Then  flourishing his stick, he gave chase to a flock of geese, and immediately tihe birds, which seemed as full of fun as himself, hissed   374      ROMANxCE OF THE and flapped their wings, and went skimming along the ground, closely pursued by a cur, which yelped all the harder for having held its tongue so wevll since the beginning of the Sabbath-but now the sun was down, and the dog barked as if it were mad. Miss Crabtree, who knew what all the hub- bub meant, at once pinched the servant girl's arm, and sent her into the shed for some light wood; the fire was soon kindled, and before many minutes a good, warm meal was spread out upon the quaint table, which was still Lydia's admiration and won- der, and which, when in its chairl form, she pre- ferred to any other seat in the room. During the repast, Miss Charity and Prudence conversed in undertones, but Wadsworth did not once open his lips, and when he left the table it was only to withdraw again to the library. "I bad beginning is a mountain to get over," sighed his aunt, turning to Goody Garlic. "You should never have let that stranger kiss Miss Lydia's hand. Then, again, Nancy Clark lhaszmade things worse. Oh! Prudence, Prudence, why did you let your charge get out of your sight? How will it all end?" "Well, I don't think you've bettered matters by getting her father to speak to her about matri- mony," rejoined the other. ;' She certainly isn't- as bright and cheerful as she was a day or to o ago."   CHARTER OAK.       375 "And my Joe is relapsing into his former mood," pursued Miss Crabtree, giving her top-knot a vicious jerk, and scowling at Lydia. During these whisperings the tavern-keeper en- tered, and after glancing round the room, in search of Wadsworth, the honest fellow seated himself in the chimney, and there, between the puffs of smoke which he sent up from his pipe, he began talking to himself. "This day," said he, " has been in- teresting and important in more ways than one, First, Captain Joe's chances of getting KMiss Lydia for a wife have pretty nigh vanished--and that's bad, oh! dreadful bad; but then the events of this world are like the drinks I mix for my custo- mers-there is always some sweet mixed with the bitter. I'm rising into favor; yes, the town folks are beginning to call me ' Mister,' again-so much for behavin' well-closin' the taverns when the nine o'clock bell rings, and singin' Psalms once a week--humph! that don't cost much." Presently, the expression of his face changed, and he looked very grave. "Yet after all," he went on, "I'd rather have remained plain Mad Adams to the end of my days, if my hopes could have been realized and Lydia Goffe taken Joseph Wadsworth for her husband. Yes, I really would; but she don't like him, and now he is sliding back into his old ways. How strange!"  This   376      ROMANCE OF TIE last exclamation passed the honest fellow's lips many times during this winter evening, the most cheerless of any during the last fortnight. The wind, which since sunset had risen to a gale, was now shrieking round the house, battering at the windows, and moaning down the chimney like the voice of a lost soul. It was just such weather as witches were supposed to choose- for their mysterious journeys through the air, and it would have required a. great deal of persuasion to have induced Adams to go up alone into the garret on such a night, while, had he known how Lydia had found the Captain's map among the old rubbish which was stored there, we are quite sure he would not have mounted even as high as the second story. At length, tapping the mouth of his pipe on the end of the back-log, he rose, and having bidden the family good-night, walked out. Not long after he had taken his departure, Goody Garlic retired to her bed-room, followed by the reg- icide: and his daughter, the old gentleman leaning on the girl's arm as he mounted the stair-case. Miss Crabtree then pinched the servant maid and dismissed her to her couch, after which the dame found herself alone in the large apartment. For about a minute she listened as if to satisfy herself that Prudence was not lingering at the top of the stairs; then gliding up to the door of the library   CHARTER OAK.       3" she held her breath and strained her ears to dis- cover what her nephew might be doing within. 'But all was quiet and the only sound she could hear was the chirping of the cricket under the hearth-stone and the howling of the wind. After listening a moment she gave a gentle tap upon the door, then with her mouth to the-keyhole, "Joe," she said, "put by your books and get some repose." But no answer came, and again she listened; ten minutes' elapsed, not the least sound could she distinguish in the study; then with a heavy heart the dame betook herself to her bed-room, muttering as she ascended the steps-"I knew it, I knew it; that kiss in the forest and the evil eye of Nancy Clark have done the work." After Miss Crabtree had closed her door, the cricket stopped chirping, and then the house was stiller than ever. How many hours Lydia had been asleep she could not tell, when suddenly she opened her eyes, and lo I seated in the ancient family chair, which stood close to the foot of her bed, clad in his deerskin jacket, top boots, and with his sword fastened to his waist, was Wadsworth-in one hand holding a lamp, in the other the map of America-and he was staring at her and in his gaze there was something so strange and death-like that, bold as the girl was, she trembled.  Was it really the Captain of the train- band, or might it be one of his departed forefathers?   378      ROMANCE OF THE The presence of Miles Standish, however, reassured her that it was not a ghost. Presently, he set the lamp on the floor, then unrolling the chart, began to trace something upon it. Lydia watched him  narrowly, and from the movement of his pencil she felt sure he was draw- ing the course of some river-" perhaps," she said to herself, "it is the St. Lawrence river, which I re- member having heard him say was not-on the map." While he was thus employed, he did not utter a syllable, and in about five minutes he rolled the parchment up, placed it on the foot of her bed, then taking t-he lamp, withdrew. What was Lydia to think of this? Might it be possible that he him- self was the draughtsman of the chart, whose origin he attributed to a supernatural power?"Yet could such a thing be done during sleep?" thought Lydia, 'i some invisible hand must surely have been guiding his--verily, we are surrounded by mysteries." She was yet thinking over what she had just witnessed when she heard the outer door close, and it at once occurred to her that there might be danger if her host, guided perhaps by an evil spirit, should go wandering about the town such a dark night. So leaving her bed, she hastily dressed herself, without awakening the good wife, and she was half way down; the stair-case, on whicht she found Wads- worth had-left his lamp, when she heard the main   CHARTER OAKt       379 door open again, and in another moment the Captain re-appeared with his 'shadow,' as usual, close at his heels. As he approached the foot of the stairs, the girl softly drew back, but on reach- ing the floor above, turned to see whether her host were following, and as she peeped down she found him staring up at her, with the same vacant look, then presently taking the lamp he retired into the library. As we may imagine, Lydia did not sleep very soundly the rest of that night, and when after some hours the watch rang the morning bell,' she rejoiced to think that the dawn was break- ing. CHAPTER    XX. THE next morning Lydia rose from the breakfast table with her host, then following him into the study, restored the map which, for a second time, had come into her possession. "Why do you persist in taking this away?" he exclaimed, with averted eyes, and in a singularly impatient tone. "Hear me a moment, M3r. Wads- worth," replied the girl, " and I will explain, at least as far as I am able, how this map came into my hands. Last night, sir, you entered my  room,   380      ROMANCE OF THE bringing it with you, and by the light of your lamp you traced something upon it. Look! do you find any thing new?" Unrolling the chart, Wadsworth nervously ran his eye across it. "Aye, verily," he exclaimed, "here is the St. Lawrence river. And you declare, Miss Goffe, that you saw me tracing it?" "I do, I do." "Then it was the Almighty who held my hand, aye, truly it must have been ;for I have no re- membrance of it. Oh, yes, yes, it is the work of the Lord." As he spoke he looked her full in the face, while his countenance glowed with enthusiasm. My constancy is being rewarded," he continued, after a pause, "and even as Jephthah of old tri- umphed, so will God in the end give me the vic- tory!" While he was speaking, Lydia returned his gaze with an expression of astonishment--she could not 'fathom the depth of his words. "What has Jephthah in common with the Captain of the Hart- ford train-band?" she thought-" is my host mad?" "You have been sent here, Miss Goffe," pursued Wadsworth, " to prove me, but I am master of my- self now; prayer is on my right hand, fasting on my left, andc between these two I am marching to triumph! A glorious future is opening before me."   CHARTER OAK.      381 Then, after a pause, "Leave me," he continued, 'and may God grant that your flinty heart be broken! Own the covenant, Miss, do, do; let it not be said that any one sojourning under my roof, kept not the road to Zion--now go!"   With this the regicide's daughter left the room, not un- willing to escape from the presence of a being whose brain she feared was wandering. The whole of that day Wadsworth remained in his library, nor during the fortnight which followed did he show himself more than once or twice to any of the household, and when he was not poring over his books, he was out amongst the people. perfecting his plans for a revolution. This coming back to his old habits, however much it displeased Miss Crabtree and Simon Adams, brought Lydia very great peace of mind, for it was evident that he had abandoned all idea of making love to her, and con- sequently she and her aged parent might, without impropriety, continue his guests. Several times Colonel Goffe inquired whether the courting made any progress, and he was astonished when his daughter answered him that their host had not yet opened his lips to her on the subject of marriage. "He even appears to shun me," she 'said, "and, father, Ham glad of it. He is a great man, born, I do not doubt, to achieve wonderful things; but I could not be his wife!"   382      ROMANCE OF THE "It's all going wrong," thought Adams, on the afternoon of the first of March, as he stood leaning against the sign-post in front of his tavern. "Although the Captain won't acknowledge it," he soliloquized, "I'm certain she's refused him! it's all the work of. that stranger whom "Miss Clark brought to the husking." Here Adams ground his teeth and doubled up his fists. "What's more," he continued, "I'm sure that fellow was the saume as rescued Miss Lydia from the wild beasts. Wonder it didn't occur to Captain Joe? Oh, he ain't as keen as I thought; and that stranger is no doubt in the service of Andros and must have slept at Nat. Clark's the night Wadsworth saw him for a moment at the Bunch of Grapes. Clark swears by King James, and has sheltered more than one British spy." Then, with a sad shake of the head, "And hasn't Miss Lydia," he went on, "become mighty intimate with Mr. Clark's daughter? Alas! alas! Captain Joe can't put two and two together as well as I can." Presently, Adams turned on his heel, and passing through a group of men, went into the Ordinary, muttering--"the devil's at the bottom of it, the devil's at the bottom of it." The scene inside the building was a very ani- mated one. The great room which took up the whole ground floor, was filled with peole llwho   CHARTER OAK.       383 were conversing in excited tones, and occasionally one, into whose head the fumes of liquor had risen, might have been heard cursing Andros, while in the centre of the throng stood twelve stacks of mus- kets, with a number of pikes leaning against them. As the tavern-keeper elbowed his way to the fir- ther extremity of the chamber, where a lad was busy dealing out beer and wine, he was more than once seized by the arm and asked what news he had to give of Wadsworth. "The train-band has a right to know if their chief is going to- take a wife?" said one burly fellow. "Well, if it's the gal what I seen riding out with lim a short while back," exclaimed the woodman- the same whom Lydia had met driving his load to market, the morning when her host had taken her out on his pillion--" if she's the gal he's going to marry, then, boys, she's hard to beat. I'd give a score of pine-tree shillings*' for one of her curls to tie on the end of my pike." "But she's cut them all off since you saw her," growled Adams. "Has she?" "Aye, and in doing so the maiden has only per- formed her duty,"' broke in a lugubrious voice, and * The largest silver piece in use in those days. On one side was a tree and Masathusets, on the other side-New England and the year of our Lord.   384       COMANCE OF TEm as the publican glanced round, he beheld the lanky form of the ruling elder standing near him. "Good afternoon, Mr. Adams," continued the official, who had perceived the rising anger in Simon's face. "Good afternoon, Mr. Adams." The effect was electric, the honest fellow's frown passed away at once, and taking the cold middle-finger which was stretched towards him, "I can't refuse to shake it," he said, " he calls me Mister;" yet at the same time one of Simon's fists. was clenched, for he felt that he was doing violence to his nature-then, with a sup- pressed oath he shook the finger a moment, after which he continued his way in the direction of the ale-barrel, to the great disappointment of fLr. Barebones, who had wanted him to stay and ex- amine a certain paper which this good man was about drawing from his pocket. Presently, a drum commenced to beat, and in another moment, Wads- worth was heard calling out-" fall in, men; fall in." The members of the train-band immediately set their glasses aside, and taking their muskets and pikes, filed out into the street, where, having form- ed ranks, they marched to the green. The steps of the meeting house were covered with people- old men of sixty, lads under sixteen (only such be- ing exempt from militia duty), mothers with their little ones, laughing girls and maidens, anxious to   CHARTER OAK.       385 see their sweethearts play soldier; and as the stoop could accommodate but a limited number, the rest of the spectators were ranged along the edge of the drill-ground. The train-band, which numbered about one hun- dred, presented, indeed, a very motley spectacle, for each member of it was allowed to dress according to his fancy, save that the coats of all had to be basted with cotton-wool as a protection against arrows. Tom   Hubbard's head, for instance, was covered by a wild-cat-skin; the tall woodman wore a cap made of the hide of a raccoon, the animal's tail dangling down his back; while many paraded in the sugar-loaf hat of the Pilgrims, and all had their trousers tucked into their boots. A more de- termined looking set it would have been difficult to *find  anywhere; there was  not a weakly man amongst them, while many of the sunburnt faces were strikingly handsome. The tallest of the band carried pikes, and these formed the centre of the line, while the musketeers, armed with weapons of the old match-lock variety, with bandeleers and rests, composed the flanks. - The bandeleer was a wooden case, covered with leather, answering the purpose of our modern cartridge box, and worn sus- pended by a  shoulder belt; the rest was a stick, * Por full description of a train-band, see Sceva's Hartford in olden time.   386      ROMANCE OF THE forked at one end, for the musket to rest in whetr taking aim, and with a string attached, to allow of its being fastened to the wrist. Presently, Wadsworth placed himself in front of his company, which was standing at ease four deep, then doffing his hat, exclaimed, "let us begin with prayer." At once every head was uncovered, and for a few minutes not a sound was heard but the voice of the chief imploring the blessing of God and returning thanks for all the favors he had bestowed on his people since their last meeting then, stretch- ing out his arms, Wadsworth ended by an invocation to the Almighty to grant them strength and courage to defend the liberties of Connecticut, now seriously menaced. When he had concluded, a lou'd cry of i" amen!" arose, both from soldiers and spectators, after which Wadsworth commanded " attention!"- then, " muskets and pikes to shoulder!" and as every weapon left the ground at the same instant a murmur of applause ran round the green; and Faith Genness and Dorothy Philbrick, who were as usual side by side, could not help clapping their hands, whereat Tom Hnbbard, whose black eyes were fixed on his sweetheart, felt as if he had grown an inch taller. The next command was- *'pikes and muskets, face to the right!"This  brought the company in marching order-the musketeers four abreast, leading; then came the   CHARTER OAK.       387 pikemen, while the rear was brought up by more musketeers. In another moment the two drummer-boys, at a signal from Wadsworth began to beat, and the band stepped off. Seven times they marched around the green, to the. delight of the multitude; for al- though the drill was a spectacle which they witness- ed once a month, the good people seemed never to tire of it. Lydia Goffe, of course, was amongst the lookers on, with Miss Crabtree and Goody Garlic within easy reach of her skirts-the dames wished to prevent her mingling with the crowd-and as the regicide/s daughter saw the active, brave-looking youths going through the manceuvres, her cheeks flushed with excitement. "If she won't take my Joe," whispered Charity to Prudence-the eyes of both. -old maids were fastened on her--" she'll not have any body else." Never before had the girl appeared so animated, and several hoary-headed -men exchanged signifi- cant nods and murmured- "isn't she a splendid gal?" At length, when the company   had marched around the green for the seventh time, it came to a halt, then forming again into line, it waited for the Captain to say another prayer, after which it might break ranks and disperse. Just at this moment, Lydia, unable any longer to control her feelings,   388      ROMANCE OF THE rushed from between her guardians, and pushing aside those who stood in her way, ran across the green, exclaiming with uplifted arms--" weel done, well done, well done!" Immediately, every eye was turned upon her, but as if she did not perceive what a sensation she was creating, she went on heaping praises on the soldiers, and urging them in impassioned tones to die rather than give up their liberty. "I tell you she can't be beat," exclaimed the rugged forester, when Lydia had finished her har- angue and withdrawn to the edge of the green- "I'd give forty pine shillings to have one of her lost curls at the end of my pike; oh dear, it was a sin to clip 'em off!" This remark was overheard by Adams, who nod- ded and murmured--" poor Captain Joe!" It was on Wadsworth, however, that the girl's conduct produced the deepest impression; he did not utter a word, his lips were firmly pressed to- gether, his eyes, which for an instant had taken in all her beauty, were now burrowing into the bod; and thus he remained until the people wondered what kept him so rigid and silent. "Give me grace," he murmured, '" not to fall again; oh, Lord! prop me up, for I am weak and sorely tempted. God hear my voice." At length, uncovering his head, the finishing   CHARTER OAK.      389 prayer was offered and the train-band broke up, the members remarking to one another as they walked away, that -the voice of their chief had a strange tremor in it which they had never remark- ed before. "Your friend is bold and very enthusiastic," whispered Mr. Clark, tapping Nancy on the shoul- der, while the crowd was surging around them; "she's just what I'd expect Goffe's daughter to be." At these words the young woman started and gazed inquiringly at him. "Ha! you appear astonished," he continued, anid still speaking in a very low tone; "well, I have discovered more than you have about your friend, and this will make one more secroi to share be- tween us. Just think, Nancy, think of our reward! Why, I would not take a thousand pounds for the secret. I know who her father is and where he is hidden, I do! I do! and if I had a score of red- coats I'd arrest him before the moon rises to- night." His daughter remained silent, she was too as- tonished to utter a word. Lydia the daughter of the long-sought Goffe! how had her father discovered it? Might Henry Synnot have told him, and if so, who had told the British officer? Had Lycia, by some unguarded expression, allowed the great secret to escape her?   390      ROMANCE OF THE --and as these thoughts rushed upon Nancy, she regretted more bitterly than ever having brought her father's guest to the husking, where, perhaps, her friend had unwittingly betrayed herself. But whoever had made this important discovery, of one thing she was certain, it would not be long in reaching the ear of Andros; perhaps, although her father had spoken of it as a secret between herself and him, the news might already be on its way to Boston. "O Lydia!" she murmured, "I will be your *friend, your true friend; you shall know of your parent's danger"--then turning abruptly away, she hastened towards the north, end of the -town. Mr. Clark called her back, but for the first time in her life she dared openly disobey him, and soon her figure was lost among the crowd. Mr. Clark would fain have pursued his daughter, but during the past week an old complaint, rheumatic gout, had attacked him, and it had not been without difficulty that he had come even as far as the drill-ground, so that all he could do was to frown and shake his cane at her. "But, no," he presently said to him- self, "no, I cannot believe she'd dare betray the secret, she'd not dare! she'd not dare!" yet while he stood lingering on the green, Nancy's conduct filled him more and more with uneasiness. Might she be going even now to warn the regicide?   CHARTER OAK.       391 "And if she is capable of that," he said to himself, grinding his teeth, " what else might she not do? She has written all my letters to Randolph and Dudley, and there are those in Hartford, who, if they knew all, might put a bullet through me. True, I have won over a few to the side of the king during the past month, but what would they be against Wadsworth's party?" Here he made a strong effort to overcome his lameness, and slowly directed his steps towards the Ordinary, where there was to be a meeting of those disaffected to- wards the government, aned he was anxious to dis- cover what might be said and done by the malcon- tents. But notwithstanding his eagerness, he did not venture nearer the tavern than the width of 3Iain street, for his quick ear had overheard more than one unfriendly remark frotm those who, like himself, were on their way thither, and to enter the building wou ld not be prudent. Indeed, it required not a little boldness to go even as far as he did; but the reward which he expected one day to re- ceive, would repay him for the danger and the many insults which were heaped upon him, -while those who scowled the most, would be- remembered when the day of his triumph came. "Aye," he said to himself, "I'll give it back to them with interest." In the mean while, although iMr. Clark's eyes were darting in every direction, he could see nothing   32S      ROMANCE OF THE of his daughter nor of Lydia, who was now Nancy's constant companion; and he was still anxiously looking around him when Wadsworth entered the Ordinary, accompanied by Israel Barebones, Mad Adams and Jacob Japheth, and these were followed by all the members of the train-band, so that in a few minutes the large room was so crowded that it could hold no more. As soon. as the stream of people had ceased flowing inward, a voice called out, "silence!" then sombody--3r. Clark believed it was Adams-proposed that Captain Joe should be chosen moderator. "I second that motion," re- sponded half a dozen voices, and in a moment the partisan of King James could discern the chiefof the train-band mounting a barrel at the further end of the room. Then followed a silence so deep that you might have heard a pin drop, after which Wadsworth began to speak.  "Fellow freemen," he said, his usually grave countenance tow beam- ing with animation-" this meeting, as you know, is not called for the purpose of regulating town affairs. At my suggestion you have assembled to take counsel as to what we ought to do for the defence of our liberties, now seriously threatened by Sir Edmund Andros"'-Here Mr. Clark put his hand to his ear and advanced half way across the road. "You are already aware, despite the- slowness of travel at this season of the -year between Boston   UJi1A1J'UL  UAA k    OiaO and Hartford, that Andros is the new ruler whom King James has put over us. Bad as Dudley was, he was not found bad enough; there was in his breast at least a faint spark of godliness, for he was the son of a godly man and did not wish to crush us like worms. Hence that half serpent, half wolf, Randolph, has persuaded his royal master to displace Dudley-and saddle New England with a tyrant who has no more scruples than the devil himself. But, fellow freemen, I am not astonished at this. King James would be blind as a bat at noontide if he did not see whither these colonies are drifting"--"And will still drift on in spite of him," cried Adams-"We must ere long fly away from him," continued Wadsworth, not heeding the in- terruption; "our wings are almost fledged, he knows it and wants to clip them. But he shall not do it, no, no! we shall fly away. A republic is coming, sure as the rising sun. 'Twere folly to ex- pect a country like ours, stretching as it does from the eastern borders of New Hampshire to the Pacific ocean, to belong to a little island on the coast of Europe? Think of it, freemen! think of it! What a future there is before us if we only--dare." Here Tom Hubbard, quite unable to repress his feelings, jumped upon Adams' shoulders and cried- "Three cheers for independence," and three such cheers were given that the publican thought the   394      ROMANCE OF THE walls of the tavern were coming down about his ears. "-Thank God for that," pursued Wadswortl, when the shouts had died away. "But, freemen, in order to reach the glorious goal, we need some- thing that we- do not so willingly give as a cheer. The King has large armies and fleets, and will do his utmost to keep us in our present condition. Blood! aye, our heart's blood must be offered up if we wish to succeed." As Wadsworth uttered these words the eyes of the listeners flashed, lip was pressed upon lip. "Yes, fellow freemen, this is the root of the matter: Are you willing to fight, bleed, die, for what you have just been cheering?"A hundred voices cried out " yes!" "Then I request every man of you to be ready to assemble at a minute's notice; I chris- ten you the minute-men of Liberty. Andros has made a demand on Governor Treat for our charter -it will be refused; he will then no doubt come here to take it-not immediately perhaps; he may wait for better weather, but come he will before many months. When he does come, let us stand like a rock between him and the palladium of our rights. Our resistance will be the signal for a gen- eral rising, and although I and all of you anay perish  in the struggle, the end will be a Re- public." Here Wadsworth ceased speaking and for the next few minutes he appeared to be study-   CHARTER OAK.       395 ing closely the faces of the people -his eagle eye rested first upon one, then on the other, but his glance, although rapid, was steady and penetrating. "If all the train-bands of New England," he said to himself, " had the spirit of this one, we might 'be free to-morrow." It was evident that his words had made a deep impression. Many called out to him to go on, while Tom Hubbard, who was perched on Adams' shoulders, declared he wished Sir Edmund would come that very day to take the charter---"Tom  Hubbard would make him see stars." "I have said enough," pursued Wadsworth, after a short silence, " but I would be glad to answer any questions you may put to me; I want every man to open his heart and say franklv what he feels. Have you any suggestions to make?" For about a minute no one spoke; then Adams, who knew well the wishes of his chief and what points the latter wanted to have discussed, asked him if guards ought not to be posted thenceforth during the day as well as the night, in the watch towers at the north and south ends of the town? "Verily, that is an idea," exclaimed the moder- ator, "which I have been revolving in my mind often of late. Your proposition, Mr. Adams (at the word 'Mister' the publican grinned) is worthy the serious consideration of the meeting. No man   396      ROMANCE OF THE can tell what may happen in these times, and should the rumor, which has come to me from a most reliable source, prove true, not -an hour ought to be lost in returning to our former ha- bits of defence. I am as well convinced that Andros is endeavoring to make use of the Warn- panoags and the Narragansetts in his unholy scheme of subjugation, as I am that he has spies going and coming between here and Boston. Yes, guards should be in the watch-houses every hour of the twenty-four, and let Indians, and all persons not freemen of Hartford and known to be peaceable inhabitants, be warned away. Of course it will cost us money and trouble to do these things, but what of that? the end is worth it; therefore, I put the question-shall guards henceforward be posted during the day time?"A "yes," loud, but not al- together unanimous, followed this appeal, and among those who did not vote either way, was Tom Hubbard. To stay awake one night in the week on Wyllys' hill, where there was always a breeze blowing, had never been a pleasant duty for he lad, who with allhis good points was fond of his couch; but to prolong the guard duty after sunrise was more than he thought he could bear. The salmon, the deer and the black-eyed Dorothy Phil- brick came before his mind's eye, at this moment, in an intensely vivid manner, and appealed to him   CHARTER OAK.      U'1 against Wadsworth's proposition. Nevertheless, unlike the fellow on his right he did not vote No, nor did he approve of another person's remark, namely, that "Wadsworth was turning all Connecticut up- side down just because Sir Edmund was drawing the reins a little tighter than Dudley." On the contrary, he looked the malcontent full in the face and made him turn his eye away. Adams' quick ear had likewise overheard ihis unpatriotic remark, and opening his broad hand, which was as hard as a stone, he brought it down on the grumbler's shoul- der with a thud which drew the attention of every- body around. "What was that you said?" he exclaimed, his lip quivering, and looking almost as fierce as his chief could at times. The man turned deadly pale, yet his face was not that of a coward--for Nathaniel Clark, in choosing his partisans, above all things aimed at winning over those who had courage as well as shrewdness- but to say anything further in opposition to Wads- worthj under present circumstances, would be only courting violence; so the dissenter held his tongue, while his confederate, he who had given the nega- tive vote, edged up closer, and likewise said nothing. Had the tavern-keeper, however, gone a step fur- ther, they would both have fought desperately; but Adams merely kept his hand on the fellow's   398      ROMANCE OF THE shoulder, then after repeating to the moderator the words which he had heard him utter, requested that it be put to the vote, whether or no he should be expelled from the train-band. Accordingly, the question was put, and by an overwhelming majority this tool of 5Mr. Clark was declared expelled. As soon as the decision was announced, the man sullenly walked out, accompanied by his friend, although the latter had not suffered his disgrace, and as they made their way to the door the people eyed them with savage glances. But Wadsworth's face instead of anger only expressed  aston- ishment. "Can it be possible?" he said, half aloud, "can it be possible!-treason here, right in our midst!" Indeed, so great was the ef- fect produced upon him by this discovery, that he requested the people to let Israel Barebones take his place as moderator; then descending from the barrel, he endeavored to hide himself among the audience. But Adams soon found him out, and taking his arm, pulled him into a corner where they both entered into earnest conversa- tion. Meanwhile the ruling elder was surveying the upturned faces with an expression of pity mingled with sternness. Much as the people esteemed him as a man of zeal and godliness, the vote by which they had allowed him to take Wadsworth's place  o%   CHARTER OAK.       399 had lacked but very few of being a negative, while a voice, which had sounded exceedingly like Tom Hubbard's, had yelled out in a tone of derision, ",Didn't we have a jolly time at the husking--oh,l, didn't we!"And when he had' heard it, the good man had groaned, and no wonder if he appeared at this moment stern, yet withal commiserating. "If by such insults," he thought, " my sin can be wiped out, then let them insult me often and often; by the grace of God I will keep out of Satan's clutches henceforward. "You're a long time beginning what you have to say," muttered the rugged woodman, who was evidently not quite sure of his ground, and there- fore spoke so low that nobody heard him. "For God's sake don't talk religion, I get enough of that at meeting," said another voice. Still Israel Barebones spoke not; the truth is, he was collecting his thoughts. Accustomed as he was to addressing crowds, the subject on which he was about to speak lay so near his heart, that he was anxious to place it before the people in the most winning way; yes, it was something he cared a thousand times more about than the safety of the. charter, and the very fullness of his thoughts caused him to hesitate--his mouth twitched and, le rubbed his forehead. "It's a comin'," laughed Tom Hubbard, poldking the woodman in the ribs-   400      ROMANCE OF THE "a sermon as long as my mammy's string of 'sass singers' just after hog killin'--ha! ha!" At length the new moderator began his remarks, and at once the most sluggish and indifferlent amongst his audience gave him their attention, for there was something in the good man's nasal twang which produced a rousing effect and stirred one up like the prick of a needle. "Fellow freemen," he said, "while I duly ap- preciate the love which you feel for liberty, I yet cannot but believe that you will listen patiently to a few remarks on quite a different topic, one, how- ever, which is most closely connected with self- government. Aye, fellow freemen, the welfare of these colonies depends on the strict observance of religion. Once let the rules established by our churches and approved by the General Assemblies become relaxed, and I would not give a snap of my finger for what remained-when godliness is at a low ebb, self-government comes to an end." "Oh dear!" sighed Tom Hubbard, while at the same time the woodman gave a low yawn and glanced towards the door--"Oh dear!" But the speaker without noticing them, went on: "Now, fellow freemen, I have observed that sab- bath-breaking is on the increase amongst us; in- stead of coming to meeting, listening to the preacher, and singing psalms, some of the townfolk-I shall   CHARTER OAK.       401 not name them, at present-pass the hours of ser- vice either at home or strolling up and down tke street, breaking the law in the most unblushing way. Here a voice cried out, "Mr. Moderator, this ain't a. town-meeting and we cannot properly con- sider the subject of sabbath-breaking; we have simply met as a train-band, to discuss the political condition of the country, and the proper means of defending our rights, now threatened by Andros." ".That's so," exclaimed several other voices. But Mr. Barebones calmly made a motion with his hand, as if he were waving these objectors out of his presence, then continued: "Now, fellow freemen, I have a request to mnake, and it is, that after leaving here you consult among yourselves as to the propriety of having a cage set up near both 'meeting-houses. I do not put this to a vote at present, for, as somebody has very justly remarked, this is not a town-meeting; all I ask is, that you talk it over, and the nexst time we come together for legislation the subject can be brought up and acted upon. I will merely add that in Ipswich, Massachussets, the cage has been found an efficacious means for preventing sabbath-break- i ing, and I would therefore -urge that two ofthaem be got for our town without delay." Here he ceased speaking a moment, while an ominous mur,   402      ROMANCE OF THE mur rang through the room, and not a few shook their heads. But before these signs of disappro- bation had taken a more decided form, the good man went on; "let me show you," he said, holding up a piece of paper on which was a diagram which no modern eye could have explained-" let me show you a new-fashioned ducking-stool; it is my own invention, and the Lord only knows the hours of wakefulness it cost me, before I was able to bring it to perfection. Instead of a common chair, liable to be broken, this has a very strong back with a wrought-iron rod fastened to each arm in front, and these rods meet in the segment of a circle above, while there is another one fixed to the back, which curves over the sinner's head and joins thfe other rods at the top, where I have fastened a ring through which you can insert the end of the pole. I flatter myself that it will be found much better than the ricketty contrivance dangling from the wil- low tree on Little river, and which is a disgrace to the town." Here he handed the diagram to one of the audience, at the same time bidding him ex- amine it and then pass it round. This was too much; quick as lightening, Tom Hubbard reached his arm out, and snatching the paper away, crumpled it up, and threw it in the direction of the window, to the great amusement of the crowd, who applauded vehemently. Wadsworth at once ceased   CHARTER OAK.       403 conversing with Adams, and began moving towards the scene of disturbance. His good sense told him that the train-band was in no humor to listen to such remarks as Mr. Barebones had been making; and indeed, before he got to the barrel, a score of -voices were calling out, " enough, enough!-come down, come down!" As he drew near, a smile of pity broke out on the good man's face;, "Mark what I say," cried the ruling elder, shaking his fore- finger at the people, "mark what I say; your un- willingness to hear me is a sign of coming evil; the Almighty will not bless you, and I prophecy that Satan will become more rampant than ever. Many will be possessed by his imps, and witches will fill the ladcl with horror!" With this he descended from his elevated position, while Tom Hubbard at the same instant burst into a derisive laugh, and declared that he would carry a horse-shoe in each pocket to scare the witches off. The commotion caused by Mr. Barebones' speech had reached its climax, when the tall wood- man caught a glimpse of Lydia Goffe, leaning over the window-sill. "There's a gal in a million!" he cried, exultingly and pointing his finger at her; " make room, friends, make room-let her have a place inside. Oh, what would I give for one of her lost curls to hang on the end of my pike?"   404      ROMANCE OF THE In an instant every-eye was fixed on the regicide's daughter, and as soon as the people recognized her as the same young woman who had so boldly applauded them when they had been under arms on the green, they gave a lusty cheer and bade her enter, while a score of hands were stretched out to help her across the sill. Lydia, blushing, accepted their invitation, and in another moment found her- self in the midst of the crowd, who were calling  upon her to take the place which Mr. Barebones had just left, and favor them with an oration. No sooner did Wadsworth behold her than his frame quivered, his eyes flashed like coals of fire, and he ground his teeth in the violent effort to master him- self, then uttering a prayer, he bent his head and fixed his gaze upon the floor. "She's a puzzle, Captain Joe, a puzzle," said Adams; "flirting at the husking with a stranger, whom I believe now to have been a spy- associat- ing with- Nancy Clark, whose father is so devoted to the king--then shouting out ' well done,' when she sees us drilling. Oh, yes, Miss Lydia is a great puzzle, but isn't she beautiful? Look, Captain, she is going to make a speech." The girl by this time had almost reached tIhe barrel, and Simon, twining his arm through his chief's, was about drawing the latter to a position where they might have a better view of the mai-   CHARTER OAK.       405 den's countenance, when suddenly a voice was lheard calling out, " come back, Lydia, come back," and glancing in the direction of the window, they saw Nancy Clark beckoning. The young-woman's face was deadly pale and she betrayed intense ex- citement. "Lydia, Lydia," she kept crying, " come back, come back!"In a moment, the regicide's daughter had freed herself from the grasp of the tall woodman, who was piloting her through the crowd, and was hastening towards her friend. ( Come with me, quick," whispered Nancy, pull- ing her through the window, while the multitude gazed after her in astonishment;--" quick, quick, no time to lose." As the girl disappeared, Wads- worth gave a sigh of relief. I was tempted," he murmured, " but God heard my prayer-may I continue firm-O Lord, stand by me." Yet he trembled to think of what he might have been exposed to, had Lydia remained and ad- dressed the meeting. Could he long have kept his eyes in subjection?"Nancy," he said to himself, "I believe you have been praying for me; I do, I do. To no other being on earth but you have I told my covenant with the Almighty-keep praying for me, good angel, keep praying." Adams stared at his chief a moment, then with a shrug of his shoulders, -"I'm going out, sir," he   406      ROMtANCE OF THE whispered, "to watch them gals; there's some. thing up, depend upon it." As soon as the young women had got a short distance from the Bunch of Grapes, Lydia turned, and with a look which betrayed her uneasiness, asked what was the matter. "'Tis something of great importance," replied Nancy, " but you are strong and can bear to hear the truth; Iwere I you, it would drive me mad." Here Lydia's face lost every trace of color, she felt a presentiment that some great evil was hanging over her. "It is known," pursued her friend, "that your father is Goffe, the long sought regicide, and that he is concealed in town." At these words Lydia felt a suddent weakness seize her, thei trees and the houses danced before her eyes, and placing her hands on Nancy's shoul- der she bowed her head, while the other thought for a moment that she was going to faint. "My fault, my fault," she murmured, " all my fault. Oh why was I not devoured by the wolves on that fatal night, better such a death a thousand times, than have had the secret escape me. Oh! Synnot, Synnot. shame on you!"Presently she looked up, and eyeing her friend with a determined air- "but they'll not take my father away," she said, "never!--" then before Nancy could stop her she was hastening back to the tavern, through the door   CHARTER OAK.       407 of which she in another moment disappeared. A quarter of an hour passed, and Nancy was yet standing in the same spot waiting for her return, when happening to glance a little to the right she perceived, at the distance of scarce fifty paces, her father leaning on his cane, and beside him the expelled member of the train-band and his con- federate. CHAPTER XXI. THE train-band had dispersed to their homes, the Bunch of Grapes was deserted by all except a couple of idlers playingq shovel-board, and Wads- worth, seated by the west window of his library, was. gazing out upon the horizon, now glowing with all the splendor of the setting sun. His arms were folded upon his breast, his heavy eye- brows appeared heavier, the fire beneath them was more vivid than usual, and his sword was yet buckled by his side. In vain for the last half hour had Miles Standish endeavored to gain his master's attention, by placing first one paw, then the other, on his knee-Wadsworth took no notice of the faithlful creature. At times his lips, which were firmly pressed together, would part, and he would Speak aloud-z"Just what I've been dreading!" he   408      ROMANCE OF THE would exclaim; "yes, the old gentleman, contrary to my advice, must have peeped into the barn the pight of the husking, and the stranger whom Nancy Clark brought must have discovered him." Then shaking his head : "But Nancy! oh Nancy! you never did that of your own free will! your father has made you the tool of his baseness; he forced you to bring that spy amongst us. But God bless you, you did your duty to freedom when you warned the regicide's daughter of her father's peril." Here he rose from his seat, and opening the door beckoned to Lydia, who ever since she had received the terrifying news, had been nestled by her parent's side-her face without a trace of color, and brooding now on the danger which menaced him, then on the treachery of Henry Synnot, while Colonel Goffe had done his best to engage her in conversation and tell him what she thought of the drill. "What ails you, child?" at length the old gentle- man asked, just as the library door opened and Wadsworth beckoned. The girl started up, and without answering the question, hastened towards the library. "I cannot comprehend her," whispered Goody Garlic. "Nor I," said Miss Crabtree, "never -in my life have I seen a being like her; she's only been to   CHARTER OAK.       409 meeting once, she's all the time in Nancy Clark's company, and yet she isn't a bad girl. Oh, if my Joe can only make her own the covenant 'twill take  away some of her pride, and I think she may yet soften towards him; but Lord deliver her from Nancy Clark." These remarks, made in undertones, did not reach the ears of Colonel Goffe, who with- out uttering a word, had seen his daughter leave his side. But quietly as he sat, and apparently unconcerned about every thing around him, he began to have secret fears that some evil was impending. Certainly, Lydia had been very unlike herself during the last hour, yet it was not on his own account that he felt anxious. He was old and infirm-what if he were discovered and brought to trial? But ever since his daughter had revealed who it was that she loved, he had felt much con- cerned about Wadsworth, who would be made to suffer dearly if Andros should find out that one of the regicides was concealed cnuder his roof. "Am I not bound to seek some other hiding- place?" he asked himself. "If I remain here what trouble may I not bring on my kind host?" Leaving him thus soliloquizing, we will follow the girl into the library. As soon as the door closed, Wadsworth motioned her to a seat, then after walking several times up and down the room, "I wish, Miss Goffe," he   '[:1JkV     .lUjlLxtAl^ iUD J X U  1 ll said, " to repeat what I told you but a short while ago- have no fears for your parent; the watch, instead of two, will henceforth consist of four, who will be posted during the day as well as the night. I expect Adams in a few moments, when he and I will accompany the guard to the watch-towers, and rest assured I will impress on their minds the ne- cessity for increased vigilance. Now, with such precautions, it will be unnecessary to go back to the wilderness; Hartford is a safe enough place, and I would lay down my life, and so would every mem- ber of my train-band, before Andros should arrest your father. Therefore, I repeat, dismiss all anxi- ety, and let this roof continue to shelter you both. I only wish I could make it a more agreeable home." "Oh, do not say that," exclaimed Lydia, heed- less of the finger which Wadsworth was pressing against his lips, for he did not wish their conversa-  tion to be heard; "you have done only too much, generous man that you are. May the Almighty bless you, and since you counsel us to remain here, we shall do so. My father does not know he is discovered, and I need not tell him." While Lydia was speaking, her. pale cheeks had got back their color, and heedless in her excite- ment of what she was doing, she had seized one of Wadsworth's hands and was now pressing it in hers.   She felt that all depended upon him; he had the power to protect her father, and as she gazed at his stern countenance, which, for some reason she could not fathom, was partly turned aside, she re- gretted ever having unfavorably compared him with the handsome but treacherous Henry Synnot- for Lydia did not for an instant doubt it was the British officer who had discovered her father's hid- ing place. Her host made no effort to free himself from her grasp, yet not a word did he speak which might reveal the struggle within him, and his face was still averted when there came a knock at the door, and presently Adams entered. No sooner did the tavern-keeper behold Lydia, than a look of anger crossed his countenance-he had come to have a frank talk with his chief, and this he could not well do in her presence. "Pray," remain said Wadsworth, motioning the girl to keep her seat, for she had risen to depart, "Adams has come to speak of matters which you may as well hear, since they concern your father's safety; yes, stay a few minutes longer." "Well, so be it," growled the publican, tapping the hilt of his dagger, " and learn that we mean business. Then bending over Lydia, and dropping his voice a-s' if he did not wish Wadsworth to hear-"tell that villain," he whispered, "not to   "2      ROMANCE OF THE' show himself agai in n Hartford; if he does, Andros will have one spy the less!" As he spoke a grim smile played on his counten- ance, then drawing out the poignard, he aimed it at his heart. Lydia understood what he meant, and although Synnot's conduct had been of-the basest, it made her shudder to think of the officer's fate, were he to fall into the hands of the unforgiv- ing Adams. "Coome, come," exclaimed the Captain, touching his scout on the shoulder; " come, speak out, no whispering. Whom are you threatening? Nat Clark?" Simon, still laughing grimly, replaced the weapon in its sheath, then, instead of replying, went on to inform Wadsworth that the guard were waiting outside. "You see," said the chief of the train-band, turning and addressing Lydia; " you see the pre- cautions which I am taking. A surprise is next to impossible, and this indefatigable fellow,"--here he pointed his thumb at Adams-" is such an excellent icout that I can always know when the enemy leaves Boston." "Yes, but your scout, Captain, is half inclined to change his tactics," growled the publican, again touching his dagger; " if more of this were used, Andros would not be so well informed about our   CHARTER OAK.       413 affairs ;" then once more bending over Lydia, "let that spy beware!" "Enough," said the girl, " enough, do not add to my misery, Adams ;" then bowing her head, she heaved a deep sigh. "Come, no threats," interrupted Wadsworth, perceiving the agitation of his young guest; "fair, open war, but no murder. I intended to have a talk with you, Simon, in Miss Lydia's presence, but I perceive that you are in no mood for it, therefore let us post the guard." With this, he motioned the tavern-keeper to de- part, then following' him, out left the regicide's. daughter to go or stay in the room as she saw fit. Lydia, however, preferred to rejoin her father, and having taken a seat beside him, she made an extra- ordinary effort to assume her usual cheerfulness. Meanwhile Wadsworth directed his steps towards the watch-tower at the north end of the town, and. which was not far from his house, and as he went along he endeavored to impress on the four mus- keteers the necessity for increased watchfulness. He told them the danger was not so much from Andros' soldiers-who, being foreign hirelings, would advance slowly and probably make no at- tempt to surprise the settlement-but what they. were chiefly to guard against were Indians, " whom," said Wadsworth, "Andros is bringing into his ser-   "4      ROMANCE OF THE vice; and -you all know what these enemies are capable of doing. Six hundred dwellings were burned by them during King Philip's war, and it was feared, at one time, that every settlement in New Eugland would be destroyed." "But the Lord is with us now as he was then," exclaimed one of the guard. "Aye, true, He is," pursued Wadsworth. ".And He'll stay with us as long as we keep our matchlocks dry," put in Adams, with a faint grin. But the others did not fathom the publican's meaning; they had a faith which would move mountains and gave him credit for having as much as themselves. Simon is right,'" said Wadsworth, "let not a drop of rain moisten them." Presently, they reached a pine tree, standing solitary and alone amidst the stumps of other trees which had been cut down and carried to the saw- mill, Here two of the sentinels were posted ; then having given them a parting word of caution, the Captain faced the others about, and marched them towards Wyllys' hill. As they passed along the street, those of the people who were out at that hour, spoke loudly their opinion of Wadsworth in words which could not help but reach his ear. "If we don't keep our charter from the clutches of Andros, 'twon't be Captain Joe's fault," said one.   CHARTER OAK.       415 "Aye, true," ejaculated another, "but he is aiming at something more than holding fast to a piece of parchment. He'll not rest quiet till these colonies have cut loose entirely from England." "He is over sanguine," remarked a third, speak- ing however in a less confident tone and evidently either a coward or lukewarm in his patriotism. "Of course, I'm no King's man, but have we not al- ready debt enough to pay? where's the use of plung- ing into a whur which would treble our burthen, and when we've scarce recovered from the blow inflicted upon us by the savages twelve years ago?" "Well, we shan't have any war," exclaimed a fourth party. "I'm a born son of Connecticut, yet for all that I'm not willing to cut adrift from old England, even if I believed we, had the power--but we haven't the power," and he finished the sentence with a derisive laugh. "Why look," he continued, "his majesty is at peace with Holland, and France, and with every other country, and there's not a ship in his navy nor a trooper in his army but would be sent against us poor colonists; bah!" Here he snapped his fingers--"I for one, don't be- believe in Captain Joe." The friends of Wadsworth who had faith in his scheme of independence, made no response to these remarks, though their ears tingled with shame, and had the malcontent dared to have uttered them at the   "6      ROMANCE OF THE meeting, they would soon enough have joined the majority and voted to expel him from the train- band. But at this moment the man happened to form one of a group of only six, and so they did not care about having angry words with him. In the meanwhile, Wadsworth pursued his way, careless of anytling he had overheard, nor did he look either to the right or the left, but hurried as rapidly as he could towards the south end of the town. As they were passing Mr. Clark's house, Adams touched his chief on the arm, then pointed towards the stoop.- There with one hand covering her face, the keen west wind blowing upon her, was a figure which the Captain knew only too well. "Aye, I suspected her father would cast her adrift," said Wadsworth, between his teeth, "for the warning she gave Lydia Goffe. Ah, poor Nancy! you're not what the people think; but God will re- ward you." In a few minutes more they reached the watch- tower on Wyllys' hill, where the Captain made a short but impressive address to the two guards whom he was going to leave there. "I will visit you to-morrow," he said in conclusion, " and you shall be punctually relieved at sunset. Remember, my friends, we are working for Liberty!" The men, who were thoroughly imbued with his   CHARTER OAK.       417 own spirit, assured him that they did not mind in the least staying awake twenty-four hours, and as Wadsworth turned to leave, bade him good-bye in cheerful tones.  j While they were descending the hill, neither Adams inor his chief spoke a word. The former kept muttering vengeance, now against Henry Synnot, now against those members of the train- band, who, in the meeting held at the Bunch of Grapes, had openly manifested their opposition to the Captain's policy, while Wadsworth's thoughts turned upon Nancy Clark. He was wondering if she had really been cast adrift by her father, and if so might he not offer her a home; Lydia and she were the best of friends; ought he to mind his aunt's antipathy for the young woman, who, once from under her father's influence, he felt sure would go to meeting aginn, as she used when her mother had been alive, and by her example might induce the regicide's daughter to own the covenant? But above all, Nancy's presence under Iris roof might act as a powerful check upon himself; she would be a constant reminder of his solemn covenant wilth the Almighty. The sun had now been down almost half an hour and they were again within a few rods of Mr. Clark's house, when suddenly they heard one of the guards cry out, "who goes there?" and in   "8      ROMANCE OF THE another moment' the challenge was followed by a loud hurrah. "Foolish fellows," exclaimed Wadsworth, looking round, " to shout in that man- ner, foolish fellows!" "And as I live, said Simon, "if they're not running from their post to greet somebody in the road; let's come back Cap' and rebuke them for their unsoldierlike behavior, and see whom they're making such an ado about." In a few minutes Adams and his chief had so far retraced their steps, that the latter was able to recognize in the challenged party no less a person than his friend Increase Mather, and he then re- membered having told one of the sentinels that the doctor might any hour be expected. The reverend gentleman was seated on a nag, which looked as if it had never had enough to eat, and the poor crea- ture was taking advantage of the halt to stand on three legs, while its master was endeavoring to free his head from the moose-skin covering which enveloped it, and which was admirably adapted for winter weather. As the doctor's face emerged from its hiding-place, it struck you at once as that of a man of ambition and ardent temperament, one who was conscious of his own power, and with the bold- ness to carry out whatever he might undertake. The forehead was lofty, the nose prominent ; at the same time the thick lips and fulness of habit in- dicated, that although he might be a fanatic, he   CHARTER' OAK.      419 could now and then be jovial and shut his eyes to the follies of others, provided, of course, these were not too serious; while if he believed in witchcraft, his superstition was so tempered by good nature that a hag accused of being'possessqd would have stood a far better chance of her life at his hands, than if she had fallen under the judgment of his son Cotton. Wadsworth, as he drew near, was tempted to follow the example of the guards, and likewise give a hurrah! But his natural dignity prevented any such'manifesfation of joy, so waving the men' back to their posts, he grasped the clergyman's hand and gave it a hearty shake. "Welcome, welcome to Hartford," he exclaimed,. "welcome, Dr. Mather. We have been expecting you these three weeks.  Welcome, welcome!" Then without waiting for a response, he bade the tavern-keeper hasten to the green and have the meeting-house bell rung. "No, no; pray do not disturb the order and quiet which reigns in the settlement at this hour," said the traveller, who, to tell the truth, was in dread of the hand-shaking which the enthusiastic people might subject him to. Wadsworth, how- ever, repeated the order, and Simon, who in his heart was anything but pleased by the clergyman's visit, (for he looked on him as the head and front   420      ROMANCE OF THE of the church. in New England, and consequently the inspirer of many of the laws which brought discomfort to publicans like himself,) proceeded to obey with seeming alacrity, yet muttering words which were not at all complimentary to the eminent nlan. After allowing his scout sufficient time to reach the meeting-house, Wadsworth pro- ceeded to inform the doctor that he was going to conduct him through the town to his own home, "where," he added, "you must make your head- quarters during your visit to these parts." "But can I not go round by some- by-way," inquired the minister. "Oh no, the people would never forgive me if you did. They are anxious to show their regard for you; and, besides, I have reasons of my own for wishing a demonstration. The king has partisans here, not many, it is true, but still he lIas some to whom the shouts and the bell-ringing, and the sight of the crowd greeting you, will prove a wholesome warning." "Well, well, as you like, sir," responded the divine, tapping his heels against his horse's ribs, and causing the animal to move slowly along. "But alas, Mr. Wadsworth, I fear governor Andros has more friends than you think. What I have seen on my journey from Boston has con- vinced me that a great many will not be prepared   CHARMTR OAK.       421 to side with you when you call to arms. And now, let me ask, how have things progressed in Connec- ticut since I last heard from you? Is the horizon any brighter?" "Yes, it is," replied the Captain, his eyes flash- ing," and for the very reason that our troubles are thickening--tle- darkness shows we are near the dawn. The news of what Andros has been doing in Massachusetts and what he threatens to do in this commonwealth, has determined many to side with me, who might otherwise have remained indifferent. Meetings have been held, and I have consulted numbers of influential men who appear to think my undertaking anything but fool-hardy." "Well, well!" continued Mr. Mather, "I am with you, heart and soul; but I fear there are not enough bold spirits to make success other than ex- tremely doubtful. Until the hour comes to fight, vou cannot tell who is the brave man and who the coward; not every one who shouts for liberty is willing to shed his blood for it." While they were conversing, the church bell kept ringing, and, as we may imagine, it did not take long for the. news of the great man's arrival to spread through the settlement. Israel Barebones, who had been at work chopping wood in his naked feet, as a penance, quickly dropped his axe, and without even waiting to pull on his boots, ran to the .,               X,   422      ROMANCE OF THE green, where he busied himself marshalling those who were already there in two lines, and begging them, with much swinging of his arms, to give the minis- ter, who was approaching, a hearty cheer as he passed by-to which the people agreed, for the fame of their visitor was greater than that of any other man in the colonies, and, moreover, it was the first time he had visited Hartford; while Tom Hubbard, who had been taking a twilight walk with the buxom Dorothy, hastened to join the crowd, vowing that his lungs would spare no wind to honor the doctor-but at the same time the lad edged as close as possible to the ruling elder. Now, be it known, although Tom was at heart not a bad fellow, he had experienced for-sev- eral days p:st an irresistible desire to tread on the good man's toes, and the opportunity which here presented itself to gratify that impulse, seem- ed really too good to be lost; while his sweetheart, who guessed what caused the twinkle in his eye, did not attempt to dissuade him from it, albeit Mr. Barebones has christened her a Cherub. Opposite Tom and Miss Philbrick, we find Nancy and Lydia. The latter, whom we left seated beside her father, as soon as she had heard what she supposed to be a signal of alarm, had hurried into the street like every body else, and falling in with her friend they had both proceeded together to-   ij     .   .  ..CHARTER OAK.    423 wards the green-where they have arrived just in time-for Mr. Mather, with Wadsworth holding the bridle of his nag, is now almost upon them. 'Now, then, three cheers for the learned and glorious Increase Mather!" cried Israel Barebones, as soon as the minister had entered between the rows; and at once, as if with one voice, the crowd gave a cheer which might have been heard for a mile; the sexton pulled at the bell-rope till his face became as red as a turkey gobbler; while Miles Standish joined the chorus, his sharp bark taper- ing off in a prolonged howl. Suddenly, in spite of their promises, the people began to leave the ranks where they had been placed-in another moment all was confusion, first one, then two, then three rushed forward. Now was Tom Hubbard's chance; the ruling elder was swinging his arms about like a windmill, vainly endeavoring to restore order--yes, now was Tom's chance. So, quickly, and with a hard stamp, the lad brought one of his heels down on Mr. Barebones' right foot, then shouting with all his might, "; hurrah for Dr. Mather!" he dragged Dorothy off through the crowd, which was too ex- cited to pay any attention to the groans of the poor man, who had sunk on his knees as if he had been shot. The minister had long gone past when Mr. Barebones rose from the ground, and when he did, he was obliged to beg somebody to help him home ;   424      EOMANCE OF TH1E yet not a word of complaint escaped his lips, and although he shrewdly guessed who had co3mmitted the cruel deed, he dismissed all idea of reproving Tom Hubbard. "Let it- be taken as a punishment," he groaned, "for the scandal I gave at the husking-Oh, wel- come, bruise!"-here he gazed at- his bleeding foot. "How much better to have my skin and sinews mangled while on earth, than have body and soul wrapped in hell fire hereafter." END OF VOLUME   ^    ROMANCE OF THE CHARTER OAK.

She left him, as we remem- ber, immediately fafter the drill, and as she hasten- ed towards Wadsworth's house, where she hoped to find Lydia, and warn her of the danger which menaced the regicide, her countenance wore a look brighter than it had in years, yet at the same time she knew that she was doing an act which Mr. Clark never would forgive. Nancy ran almost the whole distance, and the violent knock which she gave on the door was answered by Miss Crabtree, whose eyes widened with astonishment. 6 What on earth have you come here for?" ex- claimed the dame, tossing back her top-knot.
