JOSH BILLINGS ON THE MULE. The mule is lhaf hoss, and haf Jackass, and then kims tu a full stop, natur diskovering her mistake. Tha weigh more, akordin tu their heft, than enny other kreetur, except a crowhar. Tha kant hear enny quicker, nor furtlher than the hoss, yet their ears are big enuff for snow shoes. You kan trust them with enny one whose life aint worthl enny more than the mules. The only wa tu keep them into a paster, is tu turn them into a rmedder jineing, and let them jump out. Tha are reddy for use, just as soon as they will du tu abuse. Tha haint got enny friends, and will live on huckel berry brush, with an ockasional chanse at Kanada thissels. Tha are a modern invenshun, i dont think the Bi- ble deludes tu them at tall. Tha sel for more money than enny other domestik animile.  Yu kant tell their age by looking into their mouth, enny more. than you kould a Mexican cannons.   "       JOSH BILLINGS. Tha never hav no dissease that a good club wont heal. If tha ever die tha must kum rite tu life agin, for i never herd nobody sa " ded mule." Tha are like sum men, very korrupt at harte ; ive known them tu be good mules for 6 months, just tu git a good chanse to kick sumbody. I never owned one, nor never mean to, unless there is a United Staits law passed, requiring it. The only reason why tha are pashunt, is bekause tha are ashamed ov themselfs. I have seen eddikated mules in a sirkus. Tha kould Lick, and bite, tremenjis. I would not sa what I am forced tu sa again the mule, if his birth want an outrage, and man want tu blame for it. Enny man who is willing tu drive a mule, . ought to be exempt by law from running for the legislatur. Tha are the strongest creeturs on earth, and heaviest, ackording tu their sise; I herd tell ov one who fell oph from the tow path, on the Eri kanawl, and sunk as soon as ha touched bottom, but he kept rite on towing the boat tu the nex stashun, breathing thru his ears, which stuck out ov the wa- ter about 2 feet 6 inches; i did'nt see this did, but an auctioneer told mne ov it, and i never knew an auctioneer tu lie unless it was absolutely convenient.   II. JOSH BILLINGS INSURES HS LIFE. I kum to the conclusion lately, that life waz so onsartin that the only wa for me tu stand a fair chance with other folks, was to git my life insured: and so i kalled on the Agent of the Garden Angel life insurance Co.," and answered the following questions, which waz put tu me over the top ov a pair of goold specks, by a slik little fat old feller, with a little round gray head, and az pretty a little belly on him az enny man ever owned:- QUESTIONS. 1st--Are yu mail or femail? if so, Pleze state how long you have been so. 2d-Are yu subjec tu fits, and if so, do yu hav more than one at a time? 3d-What is yure precise fiteing weilght?  4th-Did yu ever have enny ancestors, and if so, how much?   160    JOSH BITNGS 5th-What iz yure legal opinion ov the consti- tutionality ov the 10 commandments! 6th-Du yu ever hav enny nite mares? 7th-Are you married and single, or are yu a Bachelor?          - 8th - Do yu beleave in a futer state? if yu du, state it. 9th-What are yure private sentiments about a rush ov rats tu the head; can it be did success- fully? 10th-Hav yu ever committed suiside. and if so, how did it seem to affect yu? Aft6ter answering the above questions, like a man in the confirmatif, the slik little fat old fellow with goold specks on, ced I was insured for life, and proberly would remain so for a term ov years. I thanked him, and smiled one ov my moste pensive smiles. 4 (   "I. REMARKS. Tha tell me that them whlo hav the harte diseaze are liable tu di at enny time, but i hav known thousands tew reach a mean old age with it. Fust appearances are ced tu be everyt ing. I dont put all mi fathe into this saying; i think oysters and klams, for instanze, will bear loo'ing into. It strains a man's philosophee the wust kind tew laff when he gits beat. Love aint one ov the vartues, bekauze it kant be controlled. Wimmin are like flowers, a little dust ov squeez- ing makes them the more fragrant.   18     6  JOSH BTTILLTNGS. Charitee kant alwus be administered delikately If you want to extrikate a crab from a dilemmer, yu hav got to take holt ov him just rite. Men liv tu a ripe old age bi keeping green. Dont hav enny more sekrets thlan yu kan keep yureself.  "Truth is mitey and will prevail;? so iz cider mitey, but yu hav got tew tap the barrell before it will prevale. O      ,-   IV. ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS. "Ameliaz."- Yure inquiry, about the moste best time tu marry, dus yu grate credit, it iz a sub- ject which i hav swet over a good deal, and i am real glad you spoke about it, mi spase wont allow me tu gro into the thing. cleah up to the hub, az i wud like tu, but in a few  wurds, i will sa, i hav alwus considered cool weather, the moste best time. "Fred.^'-Yu   aint obliged tu ask a gals moth- er, if yu ma go home with her from a partee, git the gals endorsement; and sale in; it iz proper enuff tu ask her tu take yure arm, but you haint got no rite tut put yure arm around her waste, un- less yu meet a Bear on the rode, and then yu are  ; bound tu take yure- arm away, just az soon az the Bear gits safely by.   f    U     20       JOSH BTLLTTNGS. "TWhip.'  Yu are rite. Mules live tu a long age, iv'e known them miself, tu live 100 years, and not half tri. Yu are rite also, about their being sure footed, iv'e known them tu kick a man, twise in a sekund. 10 feet oph. Gertrude.. -Yure inquiry stumps me, the darndest. The more i think on it, the more i kant tell. Az near az i kan rekolek now, i think i dont kno. Much mite be ced both ways, and neether wa be rite. Upon the whole i rather reckon i wud, or i wuddent, jist az i thought best, or otherwise. Plutark." - Yu'are mistaken, the  Shakers dont marry. If young Shakers fall in luv tha are sot tu weeding onions, and that kures themn forth- Withly. I kant tell yu now, how much it dus kost tu jine the Shakers but i beleave the expenze used tu be, inkluding havinfg yure hair cut and larning how tu danse, about $65,00. I disreckoleckt what their religun iz, but if mi memry sarves me rite, it iz making almitey good brooms, and sellin devilish poor grape cuttings, for 75 cents a foot. "Sportsman."-Yure inquiry iz not edzackly in   ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.     21 mi line, but i haste tu repli, as follers, to wit: The rite length tu cut oph a dog's tale haz never yet bin fully diskovered, but iz undoubtedly some- whare bak - ov lliz ears, provided yu git; the dog's consent. N. B.- It aint absolutely necessara the dog's consent should be in riteing. "Kate."-I think Lord Biron waz the author ov the lines yu speke ov; 'twas either him or 'twas Captain Kid, one or .tother. Biron waz dredful limher at riteing potri, so waz Kidd, but Biron waz the limberest.    ,      i V. / A TABLOWS IN 4 ACKS.

Tlhe dorg begins tew loll, the boarding; skool miss tells hm 'tew dri up," (in French,) and the dorg sez " he be. 'darned if he will," (in Dorg.) [Grate sensashun among the awjence, with cries, "put him out!"]  Finally a- compromize iz affected, the boarding skool miss kiss- es the dorg, with tears in his eyes.

Amid tremduous applauze the curtin falls, and the awjence disperce, single file. -^,      VI. , ,    L FEMALE EDDIKASHUN. Thare iz so mutch ced about the importanze ov female eddikashun, now a daze, that a near-sighted person wud suppoze that -wimmin, was running tu waist. The more that wimrerin ar elevated, the more men ar histed up too, so tha sa, and them who maik this statement, ain't fur from out ov the wa fur men hav bin clus after the wimmin, ever sinse humin beins waz perpetrated. Dear reader, dear, don't be maid a fool uv, by beleaving for the space ov a half-grown seekond, that Josh Billings, (more properly Joshua Billings, Esq.,) don't love, respeck, adore, and worship the sex, and ain't willing tu fite, even with the belly-ake onto him, two hundred pounds ov any kind ov man, in behalf ov enny var- tuous, and worthy, or even good-looking, woman. I; beleave in femail eddikashun, clear up tu the handle,' provided the woman hankers for it, but if 2   /.. .  26       JOSH BILLINGS. she don't hanker for it, i kant see why she shud be histed up into a posishun, where men has got to cease laving her, just in proposhun az tha are asked to wonder at her. Tha tell us that thare aint enny posishun that man kan fill, but what wimmin kan fill it tu; but iz that enny reson why it iz best to prove it. I haven't enny doubt, that you could eddicate wimmin so muchly, that tha wouldn't kno enny more about getting dinner, than sum ministers ov the gospil kno about preaching and while tha mite translate one ov Virgils ecklogs tu a spot, tha couldn't translate a baby out ov a kradle, without letting it cum apart. I hold that natur haz its laws and programmy, all the wa down, from the biting over ov a volkano tua the wiggle ov a lam's tale.- Suppose you shud take -100 yung injuns and eddikate them tu the highest pint, and then turn them luce! 95 ov them wud throw a blanket ontu their shoulders, bid fair- well tu civilizashun, and dive intu the wildnerness; the uther 5 wud wander about among the pail faces, az far from hum az a Bufferlo wud be among a herd ov short tailed durhams. I believe in femail eddi- kashun, but i had ruther a woman cad beet me nussing a baby than tu feel that she cud beet me or ,   FEMALE EDDIKAS1UN       27 enny other man in a stump speech or a lektur on veteranara praktiss. If Billings understands human natur, and he thinks he duz, thare aint nothing that a true woman luvs more than the hole ov a man's harte; and, in order tu git this, she haz got tu kno less than -he duz, or maik him think so. I thank the lord that thare aint menny wimmin in the wurld who want tu know evry thing.  I kalkerlate that 9 out ov evry 10 ov the wirmmin who luv their huzbands and glory in their children, will sa that tha had ruther be looked down upon in luvinig tenderniss than tu be looked up tu in silent aw. If Josh Billings haz ced a wurd, in what he haz now rit, wich iz kalkulated tu damp the arder ov one single aspirin' woman, he iz reddy tu shed tears, but i hav alwus thort that the very highly eddikated wimmin work best in single harniss. In konklusion, i sa, elevate the wimmin, but if their beds and their hartes bekum antagonicks in the operashun, i shall continner tu think tlat luv; swapped for wizdom, iz a doutful gain to the wimmin and a pozatif loss to us poor mail-claid devils. Mi christian friends, ajew!    VIII. DEPOZETIONS. Josh Billings being duly sworn deposes as follows: That, John Brown haz halted a fu days for re- freshment. That, moste men had ruther sa a smart thing than tew dew a good one. That, baksliding iz a big thing, espeshila on ice. That, a live traitor smells wuss than a ded one. That, there iz 2 things in this life for which we are never fully prepared, and that iz twins. That, yu kant judge a man bi hiz religgun   DEPOZETIONS.        29 eny more than yu kan judge hiz shurt bi the size ov the collar and risthands. That, the devil iz alwus prepared tew see kom- pany. That, it iz treating a man. like a dog tew cut him oph short in hiz narrative. ] That, "ignoranse iz bliss,' ignoranse of sawing wood, for instanse. That, menny will fale tew be saved simpla be- kause tha haint got ennything tew saive. That, the vartues ov woman are awl her own, but her frailities hav bin taught her. That, dry pastors are the best for flocks; flocks ov sheep i mean.  That, men ov genius are like eagles, tha live on what tha kill, while men ov talents are like crows, tha live on what haz bin killed for them.   J30     1JOSH BILLINOS. That, some peoples are fond ov bragging about their ansesstors, and their grate descent, when in fack, their grate descent iz jist what's the matter -. '- ovthem. That, a woman kant keep a sekret nor let enny- body else keep one. That, " a little larning iz a dangerous thing; this iz az tru az it iz common. That, sider brandee taken inwardly in large quan- titys iz good- for a rat hole. That, a grate menny folks have bin eddikated oph from their feet. , *  *  ' -  ^   VIII. WAR AND ARMY PHRAZES. ' A suckcessful Rade,"-cutting oph a turnpike ithin the enama's lines, and bringing in a-blind mule, and 2 niggers tu board. "Reserv'd Korps, "-this i take it means owr ophisers; who die at the tavern stands, and are stuffed, and cent home tu berry. "Bace of supplize,"--Unkle Samuel's pocket- Book. , Pickitts,"- -these are surplus chaps, who ar cent out tu borry turbacker, and to see if the kussed rebels hav got enny pass. "An Armstise,"--giving the enema tu chances tu git licked instead ov one.   -  32      JOSH BILLINGS. "Militara Stratergee,"-trying to reduse a swamp by ketching the bilyus fever out ov it. "Lite Hoss Calvary,"-picked men who ride the hosses tu drink, when tha git thin. "Rekrutin Ophisers,"-individuals who are cent into the rural destriks, on a furlong, to rekrute- themselfs. "Armee Rashuns,"-back pay, and preserved beef! "Quartring on the enemee," this phraze is de- funkted, be aze its contraree tu Hoyle.

WAR AND ARMY PHRASES.       3 "On tu Richmond,"-that's tu sa if the kussed  rebels will allow it.      .          f "Parralel lines,"-are them kind of lines that never curm together. ! % Militara necessita,"-ten ophisers and a gallon ov whiski to every three privates. "Onluce the dogs ov war; "-but muzzle the darn kritters; if you don't, somebody will get hurt. War of Exterminashun "--this fraze belongs holey tu the Kommissara Department. "Advance Gard,9 "-this is a gard tha hav tu hay in our army tu keep our fellers from pichin in tu the enema frontwards. ' Rere Gard,"-this is a gard that hav tu keep our fellers, when tha are surrounded from pitching intu the enema backwards. "Awl quiet on the Potermuck,"-this shows what perfect subjekshun our fellers are under. 2' e   IX. PASHtUNCE OV JOB. Evryboddy iz in the habit ov bragging on Job, and Job did hav konsiderable bile pashunce, that's a fac, but did he ever keep a distrik skule for 8 dol- lars a month, and borde 'round? Did he ever reap lodged oats down hill in a hot da, and hav all hiz gallus buttons bust oph at once? Did he ever hav the jumpin teethake, and be made tu tend baby while hiz wife was over tu Perkinses tu a teasquall? Did he ever git up in the morning awful dri and turf it 3 miles befoar brekfast tu git a drink, and find that the man kep a tempranse hous? Did he ever undertaik tu milk a kicking hefer with a bushy tail, in fli time, out in the lot? Did hle ever sot down onto a litter ov kittens in the old rockin cheer, i with hiz summer pantyloons on without saing " dam- nashun!'"If he cud du all theze things, and praze the Lord at the same time, all i hav got tu sa, iz, Bully for Job / r   on  tS X. FRIENDLY LETTER. FRIEND ELIAS :-You ask me menny questions about the draft that bothers me. It iz curis how it duz act, but it waz jist so in scripter times, " 2 wim- rmin Waz at. a mill a grinding (corn i reckon), one waz took, 'and t'other want took.' There aint enny dout but the draft iz for 3 years, or thereabouts, but i think a person would hav a rite to sell out hiz chanse at enny time during the 3 years, or therea- bouts, for a premium, provided he could show tu the government that he waz conscientzly oppozed tu hard tak and bilyus fever. Again: Aleyens aint liable for the draft, espesh- ila if tha cum from the city ov Ireland, and hav bin in the habit, for the laste 5 years,- ov voting the democratic ticket. Againly : Widder-wimmin, and their only son iz exempt, provided the widder's husband haz alreddy   86 -JOSH BILLINGS. sarved 2 years in the war, and iz willing tu go agin; i beleave the supreme corte haz desided this thing forever. Onse more: If a drafted man shud run awa with hiz draft, he proberly wouldn't ever be allowed to stand a draft agin; this looks severe at fust site, but the more yu look at it the more yu can see the wisdom into it. Onse morely : Xempts are thoze who hav bin drafted into the stait prizzen, for triing tu git an honest living bi supporting 2 wives at onst; also, all them people who are crazee, and unsound on the goose; also, all nusepaper korrespondents and fools in general. Onse morely Again : No substidude will be ack- septed, who iz less than 3, or more than 10 feet high, he must know how to chaw terbacker and drink whiskee, and must'nt be afeered ov the itch nor the rebels. Moral Karakter aint required, the government furnishes that, and rashuns. Conclusively : No person kan be drafted but twice in 2 different plases without hiz consent, but awl men haz a rite tu be drafted at least onst; i don't think even a rit ov habus corpus could deprive a man ov this laste, blessed privlege. @      - "    XI. AFFURISMS. Truth iz the onla thing I kno ov that kant be improved upon. If yu want tew git a sure krop, and a big yield for the seed, sow wilde oats. An insult tew one man iz an insult tew aul men.

In gazeing at the different kind ov noshuns that prevale jist now, we are struck with the vitality, and permiskuousness, ov the Yankee noshuns.   These are a kind ov noshuns. that reside in Nu England,/ but travel awl over the world.  They are for the present known  az the lead gimblet, the basswood sperm-kandle, and the sole leather juise harp noshun, relieved at times, by the hickory lossenge, the char- kole led pensil, and the lard bears Hie noshun, 'and okasionally interlined, tew keep up the appetite, with paper razor straps, plaster-paris sheep shears, and the sour milk opedeldock noshun, which iz war- ranted tew kure the attack ov a 50 cent shinplaster, in 4 seckunds; to which has lately bin added, pew- ter jak knives, with pork rhine handles, and itch h intement, made out ov strong butter, and lamblak.

It iz really curis how folks differ in their noshuns about bosses, sum wants a bob-tailed boss, and sum dont, sum wants a bay, and sum wants a yaller, and sum wants any culler so bad that they hav tew be sent tew state prizon, tew be healed ov their pashion for the nobel animal, the hoss. Iknu ov one old feller who waz very noshunal, he wouldn't hav a hoss only jist so high, he never stabled- him, and let him git - hiz -own fodder, he kept him for 47 years, and the- boss outlived him, the last- time I saw the boss he waz alive, but poor az wood; the old feller called the boss ' saw-buck,' and sed he waz sired bi carpenter, out ov a white ash skantlina, Hoss no- shuns are -well enuff, but -they never ought tew be allowed tew interfere with a man's final salvashun. 4K - v ,        RUM NOSHUNS. Perhaps thare iz no subjek that moste men agree on so well bi the gallon, but when it comes down tew a drink, that they are so full ov noshuns about, az their rum.

Rum noshuns are like gitting struk with litening, the theory iz well enuff, but the praktis is a bad one tew git into i RELIGIOUS CREED NOSHUNS. The idee that thare iz onla one way tew git tew Heaven iz awl rong, but the idee that there iz but, 'one Heaven tew git tew, iz awl right. Az a gineral thing nations, go tew war for the most ornary things, so men will fite the wust kind, for a religious no- shun, that they hain't got the fust smell of.

Manifest destiny iz the science ov going tew the devil, or enny other place before yu git thare. I may be rong in this centiment, but that iz the way it strikes me, and i am so put together that when enny thing strikes me i immejiately strike back. Mani- fest destiny mite perhaps be blocked out agin az the condishun that manh and things find themselfs in with- a ring in their nozes and sumboddy hold ov the ring. I may be rong agin, but if i am, awl i hav got tew sa iz, i don't kno it, and what a man don't kno ain't no damage tew enny boddy else. The tru way that manifess destiny had better be sot down iz, the exact distance that a frog kan jump down hill with a striped snake after him; i dont kno but i may be wrong onst more but if the frog don't git ketcthed the destiny iz jist what' he iz a looking for.                 ,   60        JOSH BILLINGS. When a man falls into the bottom ov a well and makes up hiz minde tew stay thare, that ain't manri- fess destiny enny more than having yure hair cut short iz; but if he almoste gits out and then falls down in akin 16 foot deeper and brakes off his neck twice in the same plase and dies and iz buried thare at low water, that iz manifess destiny on the square. Standing behind a bull in fly time and gitting kick- ed twice at one time, must feel a good deal like man- ifess destiny. Being about 10 seckunds tew late tew git an express train, and then chasing the train with yure wife, and an umbreller in yure hands, in a hot day, and not getting az near tew the train az you waz. when yu started, looks a leetle like mani-  fess destiny on a rale rode trak. Going into a tem- pranse - house and calling for a little old Bourbon on ice, and  being told in a mild way that "the Bourbon iz jist out, but they hav got sum gin that cost 72 cents a gallon in Paris." sounds tew me like the manifess destiny ovmoste tempranse houses. Mi dear reader, don't beleave in manifess destiny untill yu see it.

Lap dogs are very useful, but if yu dont hold them in yure lap awl the time, tha aint proffittable at all.

What aI man, or woman eats, if it iz well cooked; iz all rite, and what tha  ware, if it iz well cooked is ditto.-- After fashuns hav had their da, then iz the time tu despize them; just so it iz with vittels; cold vittels for instanze.

Them that sett the fashun, aught tu be vartuous and big minded, bekauze the morals ov a people are just about az mutch inflooensed by fashun az tha are by religun. In them daze, when tha had no partiklar fashun, tha didn't hav partiklar enny thing else. It iz more evidense ov vanitee to rejek fashun, than it iz tu adopt it. Evra boddy, more or lessly, hankers after fashun. Fashun makes the poor ambishus, and it makes the rich affabil; it makes the the vartuous cheerful, and it makes the humbly kind ov handsum, and thare iz no reson why it shud make the modest bold, enny more than elegense shud make the butiful wicked. Thare has alwus bin wolfs in sheeps clothing, and fashun will okasionally be used for the same purpis, but that aint enny reson why mutton aint good, nor why fashun shud be hipokrasy.

His ears are like the lilac leaf, played upon bi the oyoung. zephurs at eventide, his silkaness is the woof ov buty, and his figger is the outline ov lovlaness. His food is white nectar, drawn from the full fountain ov affecshun. He waxes fatter, and more slik, evra da, and hangs from the buzzum ov his muther like an image ov alabastur. He laffeth at forms, and curleth his tale still clusser, as his feast goeth on, then he riseth with gladness, and wandereth with his kindred, be- side the still waters. His brothers and sisters are az like him as flakes ov snow, and all the day long, amung the red kloverand beneath the white thorn, he maketh his joy, and leadeth a life arkadian. Htis words are low musik, and his/ language the un- tutored freshness ov natur.. His pastime is the his-   76        JOSH BTLLTNGS. tory ov innersence, and his lessure is elaganse. He walketh' whare grase leadeth, and gambles tew the dallianse ov dewy fragranse. He gathereth straws in his mouth, and hasteneth awa on errants ov glad- ness. He listeneth tu the reproof of hiz parent; his ackshuns are the laws ov perliteness, and h]is logick is the power ov instinkt. His datime is pease and his evening is gentle forgitfullness. As hle taketh on years, he loveth kool lases, and del- veth in liquids, and stirreth the arth tew a fatness, and painteth hisself in dark cullers, a reffuge from flize, and the torments ov life. He forgetteth his parent, and bekumeth his own master, and larneth the mistery ov food, and groweth hugely.  Men gaze at his porkyness, and kount his vallu bi pounds, and la in wate for him, and sacrifise him, and give his flesh salt for its safety. This is Pig life.     ,               .   XXVI. PROVERBS.

"Musick hath charms to sooth "a savage.  'To rend a rok or split a kabbage." So thA tell me, but i shud rather try a revolver on the savage, a blast ov powder on the rok, and good sharp vinegar on the kabbage. I haint searched history tew diskiver who giv the first consert ov musik. We are told, that in those days ' the stars sang together,' but in theze days Yu kant git stars tew sing together. We often hear it said, "that such a person haz a good ear for musik." I don't fellership this remark; awl a person wants tew un- derstand musik with, is a good soul; a "good ear" haint got enny more tew du with it than a good sett ov brains has tu do with charity. Musical crickets si '                   , insist that if the gammut aint rite, the musik aint rite; this is awl nonsense ;the gammut hain't got enny more tew du with a musick-hungry man, than   "8      JOSH BILLINGS. a knife and fork has with his dinner, if he is real hungry he can eat with his fingers. Musick want got up tew make us wise, but better natured. How much opera musick dew you suppose it wud talk tu make a man cry? Folks will tell yu that such an " overture fria dabulo? (or sum uther furrin big named thing)" waz moste heavenly rendered," tha mite as well tell me that a pumpkin pie was heaven- ly rendered. What do i care about the rendering, if i don't git a piece ov the pie? Let some Prime Donner, or Mezzer Soapraner, or Barrytown Base, or some sich latin individual, cum into this village, and histe their flag, and hav a programmy ov sing- ing as long as a sarch warrant, and as hard tu spell out as a Chinese proklamashun ritten upside down, and taxed seventy-five cents for a preserved seat, and moste evrybody will go tu hear it, bekause moste everybody else dus, and will sa, evry now and then, (out loud) " how bewitching! how delishus! how egstatick!" and nineteen out ov evry twenty- one ov them wouldn't kno it if the performance was a burlesk on their grandmother. Wouldn't it be fun tew cee one ov these opera singers undertake tu rok a baby tu sleep? i gess thare wud be two parts carried tu that song about that time.

But awl the reasoning in the wurld wont convince menny peo- ple that tha haint got a rite tew go into fits over an opera tha dont understand a word ov; it iz the fash- ion tew expire and hav their souls dissolve in latin at the rate ov seventy-five cents, an it haz got to be did, sink or swim, survive or perish."  If enny boddy wants tu go and hear a man or woman disgorge mu- sik, that has more kolik than melody into it, i sup- pose (under the constitushun) tha hav jist the same rite tew crusifi themselves enny uther wa, for sum- body's else sins that tha dont kno the natur of.   XLI. "MAN WAZ MADE TEW MOURN." This waz the private opinion ov one Burns, a Skotchman, who waz very edikated tew poetri from his infansy. I and he differ, which is not uncom- mon among grate minds. The ornary minds in this wurld lare disposed tew coinside, which iz the reson whi superstitions prevale so mutch. Tew differ-up- on matters with anuther is a fair presumpshun that yu are in the habit ov smelling ov things before yu swaller them. Man warnt made tew mourn, man waz made tew laff. He iz the onla creeter or thing that God made tew laff out loud. It iz tru he knows how to mourn, so duz the animills kno how, the birds can tell tieir sorrows, and the flowers kan hang their pretty heds. Man waz made tew smile; tew laff, tew haw! tew thro up his hat, and sing halleluger. Man waz made tew praze God, and he cant dew it bi mourning.

It iz, with- out doubt, a verry anshunt enterprise; and judgeing from what we kno ov human natur in this latitude, it must hav struk Adam as a good investment when he fust diskovered hiz wife. If Adam didn't kiss Eve at sight he aint the man i take him tew be; and If Eve didn't relish it, it must hav bin bekause it want well did. Thare iz one thing abodu kissing in the lump, diffrent from the rest ov the fine arts and that iz, it don't require enny eddikashun tew dew it; i hav even thort that the more unedikated it waz did (provided it didn't miss the mark) the more touching it was tew behold. But- kissing is a good deal like eating; thare is not much fun (whenr a person iz hungry) in standing by, and see it did bi anuther fellow, if it iz did ever so well. It is one ov the cheapess and healthyess luxurys ov the season, and don't sho enny disposishun tew go out ov fashion, and will keep sweet in enny climate. Upon the whole, if yu examine kissing in the lump, clussly, yu will be led tew exclaim: Fustly, that it iz as easy tew hav It did, az it is handy tew dew it.

FOR A FU MNNITS AMUNG THE SPEERITS. Bi invitashun i had the happiness tew attend a speerit cirkle in the good old town ov Billingsville last week. A long haired feller bi the name of Pro- fesser McGuire, with a face that looked like a sucked lemon, waz the midwife ov the okasion.

You will find awl the different styles ov docktrine and pollyticks, at Long Branche. One feller asked me "if i didn't think that the southerriconfederasy would be recognized be- fore long," and i ced, that the southren confederasy had bin recognized, for more than 3 years, bi awl sensibel & honest people; az the moste cussidest ov awl things cussid. And another feller asked me what i thought ov the doktrine ov poligamy. i replied tew hllim, in a few wurds, that it waz tew mutch doktrine, for enny one man tew - hav, and dew the subjeck justiss.

Visiting Long Branch, in this respeck, iz like going down  into a marsh, in mus- keeter time, awl the inhabitants stick a bill into you.

Tha ma be dividid (tew anser our purpis,) into 3 classes: The Lone, The Grass, and The Star Spangled Ban- ner Widder. The Lone Widder iz ginerally sele- brated for her piety, she haz passed the middle ov life, she knows she haz got gra hairs in her bed, she will tell her age, and talks tenderla ov her ded husband. Her grief iz sober, her weeds are rank, if she iz ritch, she is charitable, if she is poor, she is humble. She seldum marrys the sekund time. Her cheerfulness never bekums gayety, and her sorrow never bekums lamentashun. If she has children, she treats them as the partners ov her bereavment, if she has none, she bends down tew those she meets as she wud tew the arly flower in her pathway. Her hole life is a glora tew her sek, and an honour evra da tew him whose good memory amung men she perpetuates.   y ON WIDDERS.        141 The Grass Widder is marrid without enny husband. She keeps house at a hotel, and kalls the servants bi familiar names. She sez that her huiand is a kur- nel in the armee. Her thesis is unkongenial temp- raments, she kan repeat Don Juan, and hides Boc- cassio's tales under her pillow. If she wud ride out she orders a coach, and a gentleman; if she is ritch, she is arrogant if she is poor, she is brasen. She kalls virtue prudery, and sez she wouldn't swop chas- tity with Dianner. If her kurnel is fortunate enuff tew git shot in battle, yu ma meet her and hiz Lu- tenant at Nuport nex summer, marrid -for the season. The Star Spanilgled Widder iz yung, ornamental, and-a fule.   She marrid her husband bekauze hiz name waz Alphonzo, and she mourns for him in at least 50 feet ov krape. Her fingers are as jew- elled as the hilt ov a Spanish dagger. She was eddi- kated at a fust klass seminare, with a 9 months' vaka- shun in it evry year, and talks awl the languages, excep english, bravely. She gases on you from be- neath her limber eyelashes, as pensiv as a wel fed kitten. Yu ma think she wants tew marry, but she thinks she onla wants a friend. If she shud snare some old feller, with a full puss, she wil make   "2      JOSH BILLINOGS. him a good toddy stik for his beverage. She has more chastity than sens, and more vartue than affeck- shun. Upon refleckshun i am disposed tew sa that there iz no condishun that a woman iz kalled upon tew fill so delikate, and so diffikult, as the widder; a condi- shun in which the lovlaness ov their naturs kan be made tew challenge our respek and admirashun, az alzo, a condishun in which their firailties may exsite our abhlorrense, and their weakness, our disguss- Amen! *S;:                   i   ,*) I* XTLTX.

Courting is a luxury, it is sallad, it is ise water, it is a beveridge, it is the pla spell ov the soul. Thle man who has never courted haz lived in vain; he haz bin a blind man amupg landskapes- and waterskapes; he has bin a deff man in the land ov hand orgins, and by the X side ov murmuring canals. - Courting iz like 2 little springs ov soft water that steal out from un- der a rock at the fut ov a mountain and run down the hill side by side singing and dansing and spat- ering each uther, eddying and frothing and kas- kading, now hiding under bank, now full ov sun and now full ov shadder, till bimeby tha jine and then tha go slow. I am in faver ov long courting; it gives the parties a chance to find out each uther's trump kards, it iz good exercise, anid is jist as innersent as 2 mering lambs. Courting iz like strawherries and cream, wants tew be did slow, then yu git the flaver. 7   "6       JOSH BTTLTNGS. I hav saw folks git ackquainted, fall in lav, git mar- rid, settel down and git tew wurk. in 3 weeks from date. This is jist the wa sum folks larn a trade, and akounts for the grate number ov almitey mean mechanicks, we hav and the poor jobs tha turn out. Perhaps it iz best i shud state sum good advise tew yung men, who are about tew court with a final view to matrimony, az it waz. In the fust plase, yung man, yu want tew git yure systen awl rite, and then find a yung woman who iz willing tew be court- ed on the square. The nex thing is tew find out how old she is, which yu kan dew bi asking her and she will sa that she is 19 years old, and this yu will find won't be far from out ov the wa. The nex best thing iz tew begin moderate; say onse evry nite in the week for the fust six months, increasing the dose as the pasheint seems to require it. It is a fust rate wa tew court the girl's mother a leetle on the start, for there iz one thing a woman never despizes, and that iz, a leettle good courting, if it is dun strikly on the square. After the fust year yu will begin to be well ackquainted and will begin tew like the bizzness. Thare is one thing I alwus advise, and that iz not to swop fotograffs oftener than onse in 10 daze. unless yu forgit how the- gal looks. rg   o N COURTINo.       147 Okasionally yu want tew look sorry and draw in yure wind az tho yu had pain, this will set the gal tew teazing yu tew find out what ails yu. Evening meetings are a good thing tu tend; it will keep yure religgion in tune; and then if the gal happens tew be thare, bi acksident, she kan ask yu tew go hum with her. Az a ginral thing i wouldn't brag on uther gals mutch when i waz courting, it mite look az tho yu knu tew mutch.  Ifyu will court 3 years ill this wa, awl the time on the square, if yu don't sa it iz a leettle the slikest time in yure life, yu kan git meas-  ured for a hat at my expense, and pa for it. Don't *. court for munny, nor buty, nor relashuns, theze things are jist about az onsartin as the kerosene ile refining bissness, liabel tew git out ov repair and bust at en- ny minnit Court a gal for fun, for the luv yu bear her, for the vartue and bissness thare is in her; court her forma wife and for a mother, court her as yu wud court a farm -for the strength ov the sile and the parfeckshun ov the title; court her as tho she want a fule, and yu a nuther; court her in the kitchen, in the parlor, over the wash-tub, and at the pianner; court this wa, yung man, and if yu don't git a good   "8       JOSH BILLINGS.  wife and she don't git a good husthand, the falt won't be in the courting. Yung man, yu kan rely upon Josh Billings, and if yu kant make these rules wurk jist send for him and he will sho yu how the thing is did, and it shant kost yu a cent. i    "I. REMARKS. Piety iz a good kind ov dissease for a man tew hav, but when he has so mutch ov it that he has tew go behind the door gn Sunday to drink his whiskee, it will dew tew watch him the rest of the week. Menny think tha luva their husbands almost tew deth, when in fack, tha are only jealous ov them. Thoze familys who are really fust class, never are afraid that ilia shall git cheated out ov their respek- tability, while the codfish familys are alwus nervous lest tha mite. The onla sure resipee tew govern mankind with, :( iz the rod; yu ma festoon it with flowers and'case it with velvet, if yu pleze, but it iz the rod, after all, that duz the bizzness. **   :150      JOSH BILLINGS I kant conseive a more despikable opjek than a proud and arrogant man; he makes me think ov an old Tom Turkey trieing tew git mad at a red flannel pettycoat on a clothes line. It iz not onla highly natral tew luv the femail sek, but 'tis highly pleasant. Verry few people enjoy munny, bekauze tha kant git enuff ov it. We are told that a contented man is happy, and we mite hav bin told, at the same, that a mudturkle could fly if it onla had wings. It wont dew tew stir up a man when he is think- ing, enny more than it will a pan ov milk when the cream is rising. Thare is one time when awl men are comparitiffly pure, and that is when tha are in luv. Huibolt was a man ov verry high attainments. It iz eazy enuff tew raize the devil, but he iz a hard crop tew reap.   REMARKS.         151 It appears tew me that a poor story iz a good deal like a grist, the oftner it iz told, the less thare iz ov it; but then, perhaps, i am mistaken. I hav bin told that swine Lager iz the Dutch for root b r.   "I THE FAULT-FINDER. Good Lord, deliver us fromt the Falt finder! one ov yure kronick grunters, i mean.

If he enjoys enny- thing he dus it under, protess, and if ennyboddy else enjoys ennything he knows tha lie about it. He is like a seckund rate bull tarrier, alwus a fiteing, and alwus gitting licked.

Good Lord, deliver us from the falt- finder! if -yu undertake tew argy with them yu onla flatter them, and if yu jine in with them yu onla maik them mad with themselfs. I had rather be a target for awl the bad luk in this wurld than tew go thru life shuteing a pizen ar- row at awl the good luk. The more i think ov it, the more i keep thinking that i falt-finding iz verry much like bobing for eels with a raw potater; a fust rate wa tew git out ov consait ov awl kinds ov fishing, and a fust rate wa not tew ketch enny eels. 7*                  ,   "IL PROVERBS. Chastity iz like an isikel. if it onse melts that's the last ov it. Dew a good turn whenever yu kan even if yu hav tew turn sumboddy's grinstun tu dew it. When a man dies the fust thing we talk about iz hiz welth, the nex thing hiz failings, and the last thing hiz vartues. I suppose the bone of contenshun" iz the collar bone. An ungrateful childe is the revenge of Heaven. After awl ced and dun the gran sekret of win- ning is tew win.

When a man's dog deserts him on akount ov his poverty, he kant git enny lower down in this world, not bi land.  Sekrets maik a dungin of the harte, and a jailor ov its owner. Don't let us forgit that the higher up we git the smaller will things look tew us here belo. Natur haz no artifise, she plants her flowers in the gardin and in the wilderness, and endows them alike. It iz tru that welth won't maik a man vartuous, but i notis thare ain't ennyboddy who wants tew be poor jist for the purpiss ov being good. Luv iz like the meazels, we kant alwus tell when we ketched it and ain't ap tew hav it severe but onst, and then it ain't kounted mutch unless it strikes inly- Tew be a suckcessful pollytysian, a man shud be butterd on both sides and then keep awa from the fire.   "V.

Thru the kind- ness of a nere and dear frend, i am able tew translate the wurd so that enny man ken understand it at onst.

JosH BILLING&S i       *   "V. ON SNATKS AND MUDTURKTiLS. I divide snaiks into one class, to wit, the devilish: They are ov much antiquity, having appeared about the same time that Adam did. The exact purpis for which tha was built hain't been explored yet; but one thing is sartin, tha are quite slippery and eazy to bend. Tha travel on thair bellys, and go down hill the moste eazyest; this is owing tew the fack that tha hain't got enny good rigging tew hold back with. Snaix have but few warm friends, altho thare is folks who flatter them; sich persons ought tew be obliged to ware a pair ov them for a cravat. Thare is but one thing that makes me more horrible than a striped snaik, and that is a big black one jest slid- ing away from the place whare I was going tew sit down on the grass. We are told that Eve waz sedused bi a snaik, i don'.beleave thare is a woman living now, in theze parts, that it could be did tew without spileing the snaik. I hav bin in the habit, ov late years, ov   158       JOSH BILLINGS sedusing snaiks miself evvry chanse i could git; i ginerally dew it bi gitting them tew put their beds under a stone, and then i cruelly desert them; sich is life! Snaiks are amphibious and thoze which dwell in the water are called eels. Tha are ov awl cullers, and sum are pizen tew behold; amung theze are the koperheds,. but tha never bite enny ov their own folks. Snaiks hav got a big appertite, akordin tew their size; i hav saw them no thicker than your finger, with 4 inches wide ov toad in them, tha stuck out like 2 quarts ov milk that had" got into a young pup bi acksident. The largest snaik in the wurld iz kept at New- port, he iz owned bi the landlords, he never haz bin shown tew but one person tew a time, and then he is generally 110 feet long; thousands go thare tew see him summers) and pay 3 dollars a da for board and 2 dollars a week tew the servants for something tew eat. I beleave a snaik never dies onla bi mistake, and never ventures out mutch in the winter when the trawling iz bad, and lays eggs like a small hen, but don't set on them bekauze tha hain't got enny more heat in their body than a ramrod haz.   i ' r  ON SNATKS AND MUDTURKLES.     159 Almoste evry humin being haz got a nateral ap- prtite agin snaix, and i will bet, if you shud put a striped snaik in a 10 aker lot, whare there was 27 wimmin picking strawherries, and holler out, "stri- ped snaik! striped snaik!" evry woman would skream, and go to feeling rite oph for the snaik. It is ced that- snaik ile applied to the back ova man's neck, will cure him from lieing. This is wuth trie- ing, even if it wont wurk, but mi individoal present- iment iz, that when the lieing disease gits familiar with a man, deth alone will put an eend to his suffer- ings. But I dont want it understood that I am agin snaik ile, for this one reason if no other, the more snaik ile there is in the market, the less snaiks. MUDTURKLES. Mudturkles liv in a shell, which tha git verry mutch attached to. Tha are not fond ov company, and seldom receive visitors in their houses. Their food consists prinsipally of what they eat, which tha find wharever tha kan git it. Their style iz haf land, and haf water, and tha are at home on the banks or at the bottom ov a kanal. Tha hav sum eggs, which tha lay in sum warm sand, and ginerally hav them hatched out tew the halves. Tha belong tew the   160       JOSH BILLINGS.     I class known az ,(close korporashuns," and are a hard animil tew whip, bekause tha alwus fite under cover. The mudturkle kant climb very well, and therefore seldum iz found up a tree. Tha are verry tuff ov life, and will outlive an injun rubber shoe, and don't seem tew gro old enny faster than a paving stone duz. Tha kan be domestikated without enny trubble; awl yu-hav tew dew, iz tew put them into a barrel, and tha aint ap tew stray off far. Mud- turkles hav their faults, but tha won't lie, nor drink rum, nor chaw terbacker, and tho tha cant trot as fast az sum bosses kan, thare sure tew git tew whare tha go tew, and never brake down on the rode. I take a deep interest in moste awl the animils, and particularly in mudturkles, and i dew hope that the Legislature in their wisdum won't pass a law ' pro- hibiting enny more mudturkles."  I regret tew hear, that in sum parts ov the kuntry, the people are in the habit of using mudturkles tew pitch quoits with, but I think this wants an affidavy with a revenew stamp onto it. In theze mi remarks about snaix and mudturkles i hav tried hard tew tell the truth, but if i hav failed, it is owing tew the grate skasity ov truth in theze days.  i!]- if- . ,S, TRUE BILLS, Tru dignity is the effeck ov the conscious posses- sion ov ability and vartue.

"VIII, PHOTOGRAPHS. Enclosed yu will be pleazed tew find my fotograff, taken from life, on the spot, whare the circumstanze occurred. I take the liberta tew send yu the picter, for the 7 different ensuing reasons: 1--Photografts are gitting skase. 2 - If you should ever meet me by mistake, yu wud be able to kno me rite oph, bi ask- ing me if I resembled the pictur. 3 - I am a marrid man, and am the author ov a familee, and therefore the danger ov any femail fallin in luv with me, bi cuming in contak with the picter, will be painfully redused. 4 -It iz, better that 99 humbly cusses should eskape, than that one decent looking man should suffer bi not having  hiz fotograff taken. 5 - A grate menny folks, jist now at this time, are troubled with a literature On the brane.

These reasons must be mi excuse for sending yu my pictur; if it don't look as yu expekted i did, jist let me kno, and i will have one taken that duz. Verry highly i remane yures, JOSH BILLINGS y   .                  ..t   "X. AFFERISIMS.

After Joseph's bretheren had beat him out ov hiz cut ov menny cullers, what did tha dew nex? Tha pittied him! Thare is nothing in this life that will open the pores ov a man so mutch, as tew fall in luv, it makes him fluent as a tin whissell, as limber as a boy's watch chain, and as perlite as a dansing master';, his harte is as full ov sunshine as a hay field, and there aint any more guile in him than there is in a stik ov merlasses candy. Thare dont seem tew be enny end tew the ambish- 8   170       JOSH BTTjTSOS. un ov men, but thare is one thing that sum ov them will find out if tha ever dew get tew heaven, and that is tha cant git enny further. He who kan hold awl he gits, kan most generally git more. Conshense, is onla another name for truth. Yu kant alwus tell a gentleman by his clothes, but yu kan bi his finger nails. Adam invented "Luv at first sight," one ov the gratest laber saving masheens the world ever saw. It is a grave question whether, in curtailing super- fluitys in these hard times, we have a moral right tew cut oph a dorg's tale tew save the expense ov board. ing it. Are Greenbacks a lawful tender? If yu dont be- lieve it tri one on me, espeshila one ov the heavy ones. Dont never parade yure good luck, nor yure bad   AFFERISIMS.       171 luck before men, the first will make them think less ov yu, and the second will make them think more of themselves. Thare are a grate multitude ov individuals who are like blind mules, anxious enough to kick, but kant tell whare.

I like a rat tarrier with hiz hair awl combed for- ward, hiz eyes on fire, hiz tale straight out stiff, evry muscle alive, and the entire dorg only 3 feet off from a rat hole. I like a woman, (handsum if it iz convenient,) with more wisdum than larning, chaste, but not frozen, soft, but not silly, and fond, but not fussy, sich wim- min are skase, and are going tew be skaser. I lile religion, (the kind that wurks 6 days and rests on the 7,) which acks on a man's soul, az con- griss water duz on hiz boddy, phesicks him well, but dont make him enny weaker. I like good order- good morals -good frends- and awl things well dun, except beefsteak, and that I want rare dun. " s   "XII. MY FUST GONG. I never kan eradicate holy from mi memry the sound ov the first gong I ever herd-i was setting on the frunt stupe ov a tavern in the sitty ov Bufferlo, pen- sively a smokin.: The sun was a goin tu bed,--and the heavens fur and nere was blushing at the purform- anse. The Eri kanall with its goldin waters was on its wftdin wa tu albany, and i was perusin the line botes, a flotin by, and thinkin ov Italy, (whare i used tu live,) and her gondolers, and gallus wimmin.

A man who haint got propper disiplin, iz jist about ov az mutch uze tew hiz fellow critters az a wether cock wud be amung a parcil ov barnyard pulletts. Injuns haint got enny disciplin, and, konsequentla, the more injuns a man had tew run a kotton faktory with, the wus he wud be oph. Turning a grinstone iz fust rate disiplin. If a man ov ornary mind haint got disiplin, he bekums a lofer the fust good chanse he gito. Thare haz bin, perhaps, a fu individoals born into the world that did'nt want mutch disiplin -Homer. and Virgil, and Shakes- per, and sich like, if tha had bin sot to turning a grin- stone it mite hav spilt them- tha waz like Eagles, made tu fli without enny praktis.

Majer Spenser had a brother who was a minister ov the gospil, and the Miajer boarded with-him. One Sunda nite the minister and the Major sot kommuning together.

Theze are subjeeks which hav bin writ onto so much that all the good things haz bin said.

The evergreen sighs az the eve- ning zephir flits through its shadowy buzzum, and the aspen trembles like the luv-smitten harte ov a damsell. Fruits ov the tropicks, in golden buty, melt on the bows, and the bees go heavy and sweet fromn the fields to their garnering hives. The man-  shun iz ov Parian marble, the porch iz a single dia- mond, set with rubiz and the mother ov pearl; the 9   194       JOSH BILLINGS. floors are ov rosewood, and the ceilings are more bu- tiful than the starry vault of heavin. Hot and cold water bubbles and squirts in evry apartment, and nothing is wanting that a poet could pra for, or art could portray. The stables are worthy of the steeds ov Nimrod or the studs ov Akilles, and its henery waz bilt expressly for the birds of paradise; while somber in the distance, like the cave ov a hermit, glimpses are caught ov the dorg-house. Here poets hav cum and warbled their laze -here skulptors hav cut, here painters hav robbed the scene ov dreamy landskapes, and here the philosopher diskov- ered the stun, which made him the alkimist ov natur. Nex northward ov this thing ov buty, sleeps the res- idense and domain ov the Duke John Smith; while southward, and nearer the spice-breathing tropicks, may be seen the barronial villy ov Earl Brown, and the Duchess, Widder Betsy Stevens. Walls ov primitiff rock, laid in Roman cement, bound the es- tate, while upward and downward, the eye catches far away, the magesta and Slow grander ov the Hud- son.

The fust thing she did waz tew create a silence, which she did after about 30 minnits, awl excep a fu whispering, which she could not dry up. The style ov the meetin' having bin sot up in big type bi the Mrs. Peleg Pewter, she ced thare waz an opening, and no less than 4 wimmin started for the opening at onst; but the president decided that Mrs. Cynthee Coon waz about one neck ahled, and \   A WIMNS LEAGUE MEETIN.      20 tharefore, waz entitled tewthe fust heat. She wa a woman about 14 hands hi, and wore wollen stockings. ShIe ed she waz for home manafakter and waz agin awl luxury excep a nu shawl, and that she must hay. Shle ced she waz willing tew giv up silk, but she must hav 1 more nu shawl if it bust her. She ced she thought thare ought tew be sum dis- kriniinashun between what folks didn't want and what tha did, and for her part she was reddy tew go her length or ennyboddy else's length agin the no- shun that poor people had ov hankering after import- ed goods. Her speech lasted for about 2 hours, and was lis- tened to with breathless expense. When she sot down the wimmin gathered around her; sum   ov them held camphor tew her noze, sum ov them un- hooked her dress, and one ov themn, more thoughtful than the rest, mixed up a gin sling, which she stug gled with for a minnit, and then ced it did her soul, good. A committee ov 3 ov the heavyest wimmin was appointed bi the chair with power tew draw up a sett ov resolushuns which was reported as follows: Whereas, resolved, that silks, and shawls, and so f)rth, are a luxury from imported kuntrys, and we are down on them. 9*   202       JOSH BILLINGS.
