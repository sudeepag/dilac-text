THERE is nothing more attractive than a good story, and no more agreeable companion than a good story-teller; and whoever succeeds in this branch of literature, exercises a fascinating in- fluence over morals and men. Few readers are fond of didactic instruction, and fewer still like abstruse argument in support of doctrine, however sound; but all men relish anecdote, and even obtuse minds appreciate a principle when illustrated and enforced through the medium of a fable, an allegory, or a parable. The reason is obvious: one is the presentation of naked, abstract truth; while the other exhibits it in living action, showing results. One is like a repulsive skeleton, with sightless sockets and nerve- less bones; and the other the living, breathing form of beauty, whose eyes ravish, and whose touch inflames with emotion. Ones appeals to reason and judgment; the other captivates both, by winning the heart. Hence it happens that the simple parables of "The Ten Virgins," "The Sower," and "'The Prodigal Son," have taught and enforced more practical theology than all the dissertations of all the divines the world has produced. Whether the author of these TALES has accomplished his pur- pose, -to give instruction through amusement, -is for the reader to say. He has, at least, had a worthy purpose, and found much pleasure in the labor. Several of them have been heretofore pre- sented in a volume long out of print, and never to be republished; and others have been living a fugitive life in weekly papers, en-    6             PREFACE. joying the popularity of frequent reproduction. This circumstance has induced the writer to afford them a thorough revision, recon- structing, and almost literally re-writing the entire series. They are, therefore, new creations, with old names and old incidents; and in the greater literary care bestowed upon them, he has thought them not unworthy of being grouped into one family, with a generic title. The second and the eighth are derived from anonymous French writers, but with little faithfulness to the original; the others have facts in American life for a basis: and if but a moiety of the favor accorded to several of the series shall be given to the collection, the author will feel abundantly grate- ful, while he reflects that none but good influences can result- from their becoming literally HQUSEHOLD TATx,;-' December, 1860. a                           o   CONTENTS.

PROSPECT HLL is classjic ground, sacred for its; mem- ories of olden times, ribbed and scarred as it is. by the remains of redoubts and fortifications which Washington, Putnam and their associates planned, and twenty thous- and badly-appointed, and worse-disciplined militia-men helped to erect. It is, moreover, the very center of a panorama of life and beauty, the equal to which is not often to be seen. Situated within a cannon-shot of the Cradle of Liberty, one would suppose that the over- tasked denizens of the city would often ascend this his- toric mount of vision; yet so full of devotion to the god Plutus, are the descendants of " times that tried men's souls,' that probably not one person in, ten of the inhabi- tants of the metropolis of the State know even of its lo-   10    ,   HOUSEHOLD TALES. cality; and niot a tenth of these have ever set foot upon its consecrated summit. Let us inform such that within three miles of Boston Common, in the prosperous town of Somerville, between Bunker Hill and Cambridge College, rises to a command- ing altitude, the eminence referred to. If you but once visit the place, upon a clear day, and have a soul at all alive to the picturesque, you will go, as we have done, on many a quiet afternoon in'summer, and with glass in, hand, or eye unaided, scan the ever-new attractions that lie spreading out at your feet, with an uninterrupted ho- rizon in every quarter. Eastward the city of Charles- town extends to the sea distinguished by its heaven-point- ed pillar of glory, capped with a crown of light by day, and: by night wreathed in darkness. Old ocean swells and surges beyond, tossing up its hoary billows in the wind, and sending forth the echoes of its eternal anthem, or calm in its slumber, revealing upon its surface multi- tudes of white-winged ships inward or outward bound; and if it be towards evening the blazing signal in the far- off lighthouse flashes among them, like a diamond set in pearls upon the bosom of a fair girl. A point towards the south -sits our own fair city with the capitol in the center, queening it all proudly upon her tripod of hills. Glori- ously she looks, too, from so commanding a position, like a fostering mother with her happy children clustered at her feet, personified by the spreading villages and hamlets around. To the south and west, and just below you, are the classic shades of old Harvard, nestling like a petted child, in the very heart of the city of Cambridge and hal-   THE OLD WINDMLL.         I1 lowed by all that is honorable and ancient in our colonial history. Every building may be noted from the stand- point, every old elm scanned, and by a keen ear, upon a proper time, even the merry roystering of Sophomores and Freshmen, at their games of foothall and cricket, may be distinguished rising from the Delta. These form the more immediate objects of observation; but beyond and between them are multitudes of others, including. al- most every village within a dozen miles, betraying many tapering spires of churches that in the,distance seem like ghosts of liberty-poles rising to rebuke the unappreciating hosts that ascend not hither for a blessing. In the rear flows the Mystic to its ocean home, and in front the noble Charles,-the river Charles,--that Longfellow has most beautifully apostrophized, forcing you to repeat after him as you gaze upon the placid waters,- River! that in silence windest, Through the meadows, bright and free, Till at length thy rest thou findest In the bosom of the sea. And yet to be noted are panting, steaming, flying vehicles of five rail-ways, in opposite quarters, almost as often as you can turn your eyes. Out and in, breathing fire and echoing thunder, on they rush with their freights of beat- ing hearts-striking emblem of human destiny! A little blaze, a little puffing of smoke, some thunder-and a gen- eration has rushed to its final station! Reader, take care you get upon the right train, and secure a ticket for the ocean passage beyond!    12        HOUSEHOLD TALES, But we have well nigh been beguiled from our pur- pose. Prospect Hill, as we have said, is sacred for its memories of olden times: yet the ruthless hand of man, reckless of the fact, has already begun the work of dem- id; olition. The purpose is entertained of leveling the site i.-. to the grade of the surrounding country, and the labor of transporting mounds and battlements to the flats and marshes in the neighborhood has commenced; and they who would see its beauties intheir integrity must hasten. For some years past, however, we have missed one object from its summit, for which in our -childhood we held the most sincere veneration, and with which we have now to do. We mean the OLD WINDMLL that stood there for generations before us, and in its day was the first object that met the eye of the traveler as he approached the me- tropolis, long before he could see anything else' in its vi- cinity, came he from whatsoever direction. One of the most noted objects was it in the State,-a kind of land- mark, by which the yeomen of the interior brought their wares to market. Indeed, we have heard of both Conti- nentalers and Regulars who made it either the subject of reverence or of ridicule; from the fact already referred to, that the American army of 1775 made this hill one of their places of encampment, and one of the strong posts in the investment of Boston. When a militia-man was about to start for the army with knapsack and musket and self-found provender, he was not infrequently heard to say that he was'"carrying his grain to the windmill;" while the sneering British soldiery would fling at any suggestion of an encounter, and flout at the yet-to-be-fought "battle k             -   "    I1l!          THE OLD WINDMLL.         13 of the windmill." In the end, however, their grists were pretty well taken care of. With this ancient, but now de- molished edifice our story is connected. Miller Miles was a plain, simple-minded, honest old farmer, who owned in fee simple the wide-spread acres, that, over upland and moorland, laid open their broad surface to 'an uninterrupted heaven. From his own dwel- ling there was scarce another within the reach of gun-shot sound, in the times of which we write; and the plain man, therefore, was seldom troubled with a superabund- ance of visitors to take him away from the care of his harvests, the gathering of which progressed slowly at the best, single-handed as he was. His mill was generally tended by one, however, who attracted more frequent call- ers, and many a time and oft she took toll with her be- witching black eyes from dozens of young bumpkins' hearts, who brought their fathers'grain to mill, from the country around. This was his only daughter Margaret, a rare-appointed damsel, whom athletic help, to her wid- ower father had developed and molded into a robust beauty, of as much physical solidity as mental grace and acuteness. Margaret Miles could load a hay-cart, ride [- behind her father, upon the old paniered pony, to Cam bridge church on the Sabbath, shoulder a two-bushel bag ] ft of corn and throw it upon the hopper, or entertain the'  most spriggish beau of the vicinity,-giving him a hearty ear-box, if he sought to steal a taste of the honey that seemed ready to ooze from the open petals of her lips,- as occasion might require. ' Nature seemed to have form- ed her for the express purpose of doing whatever she 2   "       HOUSEHOLD TALES. chanced to be about,-so facile were her powers, and so joyously did she put them into exercise. And yet the damsel was totally inapproachable to the multitude of suitors that toiled up the hill 'to sit up witl her," as the phrase ran, and who had their labor for their pains, with the addition of a headache, perhaps, for a day or two, the joint result of loss of sleep and -anxiety of mind. There was hot a young man to be found that had not traveled the same toilsome path, for the same errand, and with a similar result. Each, of course, kept his own counsel, and the result was that all held a peculiar taci- turnity with reference to the saucy girl, and exhibited a suitable degree of jealousy towards each other. Heart- burnings, petty feuds, and disputes were engendered, till the bellonian dispositions of the young yeomanry resem- bled that of the young Greeks, when they strove with each other for the coquettish Helen, who jilted every soul among them. The truth was, however, her heart had se- cretly been besieged, and reduced to such extremities that it had capitulated, with all its forces, to a young Boston lawyer, who had found means to push his suit successfully. The old miller was not a man to be particularly pleased with his son-in-law-apparent; and both lovers, the ofbre, thought it wise, for the present, to love in silence, and ap- pear to the world as if they had never seen a feather of Cupid's wing. Especially did this seem desirable, now, when the colony was like a hive of angry bees, ferment- ing in wrath at the encroachment of power on the part of the parent government, and every moment in expectation of deadly collision; for miller Miles was a stanch loyal-   TIIE OLD WINDMLL.         15 ist at heart, while Peggy's lover was the most eloquent young patriot in the whole colony! We doubt not, then, they decided wisely. CHAPTER II. THE winter of 1775 opened with high-handed meas- ures against the colonies, and particularly against Massa- chusetts. Her inhabitants were declared rebels. British ships of the line and ten thousand troops were ordered to reduce them to submission, and General Gage, the royal governor, proceeded with cool hardihood to effect his part of the tyranny.  The Assembly of the State he had per- emptorily dissolved, and the members, with as much con- tempt for him as he could show for them, resolved them- selves into a provincial Congress, and voted to arm and equip twelve thousand men, to defy him and his hireling troops. The royal forces in Boston already numbered three thousand men, and Gage both thought to quell any sud- den outhreak that might occur and to awe the people into submission.  Still, he felt it to be of the utmost import-. ance, either to secure or to destroy the military stores that were gathered at various points. To this end, with the strictest secrecy, an expedition was planned for the 19th of April, when a  detachment of Regulars was to march for Concord.  But notwithstanding all precautions that the Twily governor had taken to prevent intelligence of the proposed movement from spreading, the patriots of Bos-   ton Were apprised of it, and immediately determined upon . vigorous measures. Just at evening, on the 18th, Samuelg Adams, in disguise, entered. his office, ill which a young man was seated at a table, rapidly writing. "Well, Edward " said the patriot, closing the door and looking carefully about the room, " what has occurred in  my absence? Since four o'clock this morning I have been  riding over the county of Middlesex, rousing the people,  ! preparing for alarms, and arranging telegraphs, in case -  i the red-backed dogs start on the trailof. gunpowder; and I have a terrible headache, a weary body and a ravenous i appetite for rewards!" 'Mr. Hancock,-or an Indcian so calling himself,-has been in twice, within the last half hour, sir," said the young man: " he has just returned from the same occupa-  tion, and is very anxious to see you. He left me these  papers to copy, that they may be forwarded to Mr. Frank- lin this very night. It is said that the troops will surely move for Concord before morning, and that Gage boasted in his dinner cups to-day that he would crush out the re- bellion by holding you two prisoners, within twenty-four  : hours! I must be permitted to add that your best friends feel that such temerity seems to foreshadow it! ' "You grow over-bold, young man!" responded Adams,  with a not displeased air; " however, that is a vice that in these times should rank among the virtues. Know, far- ther, that a man's best friend is his own conscience,--and i while I follow the dictates of mine, I fear neither Gen. Gage, King George, nor the devil, whom they both seem to be in league with!"! ;i   At that instant the door opened, and John Hancock en- tered, disguised as an Indian. "Adams!" said he, "  never more gladly welcomed!- They tell me our friends have missed us to-day, and ver- ily began to think we had gone over to King George at last, without condescending to wave our handkerchiefs in parting!" "The King," replied the other, .smiling, " has need of better subjects than you and I have ever been to him, to atone for the evil of this day's work to His Majesty!  I have found the country ready for the first signal of attack, and I firmly believe it will stand fire nobly." "Aye! aye!" rejoined his companion, "I long for the roar of the cannon to commence, to test their mettle!--for I doubt not that the smell of powder will lead the people to desperate deeds, even as its hoarding does to desperate words. But if they are to fail us, better to know it than to live longer in suspense of the possible!" "' The possible! '" ejaculated Adams impatiently; "you may bottle up a whirlwind, or chain the lightnings to a child's cradle, as soon as you see anything but unflinch- ing courage in the conduct of the patriotic colonists!" "Mr. Franklin can do you that now, they tell me, and I only disbelieve it because lhe does not throw one of his heaviest bolts at the throne of King George, and shiver it, with the tyrant on it, to atoms! But I have other talk for your more private ear." The two men passed within a retired chamber, and af- ter half an hour's absence returned. It was now dusk; the young man had laid his pen aside, carefully folded his 2*   18       HOUSEHOLD TALES. manuscript, and sat gazing from the window, while a company of the royal troops defiled from the Old South Church. The eyes of the two elders moved in the same direction, and after a moment's silence, Mr. Adams spoke with an air of unusual solemnity. "Edward Wilson!" said he, "I have had all confidence in you, and I doubt you not now. You love the daughter of old Miles the miller,-you need not blush, young man, because you discover that I know your secret, for I have learned to read deeper and older men than you! The old man is a loyalist, and I believe him to be a spy, beside  But let that pass; it is not danger to him, or his pretty daughter, that I would speak of, but to you! Are you prepared to hazard limb and life, in a secret service for the caLse of Liberty, that will peril both? Reflect well, be- fore you answer!" The young man, however, took little time for reflection, for no sooner was the question asked than he replied,- "I should be but an ungracious pupil of two such in- structors, were I to hesitate in the path of duty, even if I trod upon nails for my coffin, at every step! Though in a subordinate station, know that I am as true and deter- mined a patriot as either of you!" "Nobly answered, young man " said Hancock, with enthusiasm. "Aye!--but suppose Cupid to stand in that same path, pleading through the lips of the loveliest maid in Middle- sex, that both nails and coffin may be avoided,-what will a determined young patriot think then?" inquired Mr. Adams, with an embarrassing air.   THE OLD WINDMLL.        19 Wilson started from his seat, not a little piqued and ex- cited. He blushed, with manly pridei as he replied. "Gentlemen!"  said he, " I cannot, if I would, disguise from you that my heart is interested in a royalist's daugh- ter! Still, it does not follow that the father's political faith must be the creed of the child: yet were it so, let me tell you that, devotedly as I love her, I love my suf- fering country better!" "Bravely said, my young friend!" said Adams, seizing him by the hand. "It is only what I expected to see you develop, whenever the test was applied. Hancock!" he continued, "I told you, at the outset, that Edward Wilson is our man, and Margaret Miles his worthy equal for noble deeds! We may detail our programme, without fear as to its results." The trio remained together, in earnest conversation, for a while longer, when, one by one, they left by a retired passage, Wilson lingering till nearly dark. At length his footsteps echoed over the stairway, and he was in the now silent streets. The last roll of the tattoo had summoned the troops to quarters, and only here and there a soldier met him, as- he wound his way, circuitously, to the ferry, and after watching for the most concealed opportunity, he leaped into a skiff, and with muffled oars, struck across the stream, and soon landed safely at Morton's Point. By devious pathways, and stealthy approaches, half an hour later, he had arrived in the rear of Prospect Hill, and in a few moments, was under the lee of the old Windmill, with Peggy Miles for a partner, who was listening to pro- posals evidently somewhat exciting, for her countenance   20        HOUSEHOLD TALES. was flushed, and unusually sad, withal, Wilson only the more earnestly pressed his purposes, as his fair companion exhibited reluctance towards them, looking furtively about at intervals, as if fearing interruption. "I tell you, Edward, it can not be!" said the maiden, as if in repeated answer to some request of paramount importance, " it can not, can not be! It could only end in suspicion of my dear father, your own betrayal, and very likely your death before miny eyes, with nothing but horri- ble agony for me while life lasts. No,-no,-Edward, you must suggest some other way. " "Nay, my dear girl, you must aid me, and here, and to-night! I have pledged myself, on my honor, to both Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams, that it should be; done, or I would perish in the enterprise. Think you, Margaret, that I would not prefer death, rather than live to be des- pised by such men,-to be thought a coward,-to -be in- terrupted in the career of patriotic duty, as they would tell me, by the idle fears of a foolish, lily-livered girl?- No, Margaret,. I will not retreat after going so far; you must lend me both your countenance and your aid. I have assured them that I could implicitly rely upon you, and they believe you to be as resolute and brave, as I know you to be beautiful and good:-Imade of metal that will show its temper in the using. For these qualities I have loved you: with all the fervor my nature is capable of, and now, at this hour, let me feel more proud of you than ever before, by seeing you equal the noblest women that' have given luster to the most heroic annals!" The young girl was on the point of yielding to this im-   THE OLD WINDMLL.         21 passioned, yet sincere appeal, to, both her love and her pride,-and each was powerful in her soul,-when a new obstacle suggested itself to her mind; with tears flowing over her agitated countenance, she said, waveringly,- "But the soldiers, Edward,-they will surely be here again, and then you must be captured,-perhaps mur- dered, and no benefit result to anybody. Twice, already, have six mounted Regulars been up the hill since sun- down, inquiring for tny father. They doubtless know, he is with Gen. Gage, and I told them he would not return till late. I feel a firm assurance- that they have only made this errand as a feint to cover some sinister purpose, -indeed, I am persuaded it has to do with your project, and it bodes evil. Give it up, Edward, for I can not con- ceal you, if they come to search!" "I will conceal myself, dearest. Beside, there can be no suspicion of my purposes, since it is yet scarcely an hour from their inception, and there could have been no eaves-droppers. Sure am I, my lips have since been si- lent, save to your ear." "In these perilous times humbler men than you are watched with the eyes of Argus, and I fear you are de- ceived, in supposing your movements concealed. Doubt- less every officer in Pitcairn's regiment,-which you say moves this way to-morrow,-is aware that you are over the ferry; I warrant that a dozen glasses have been peer- ing across the water, from the steeples yonder, to watch your course and destination!" "You forget, love, " added Wilson, with a smile, " that it has been too dark for such observations. Beside, I    22        HOUSEHOLD TALES. have taken care to come circuitous paths, mounting-the hill from the rear, and keeping this old Windmill interposed between my precious self and the town yonder. If they have observed me, it has been through these walls, and the denser medium of this good hill!" "But if I am questioned," continued the damsel begin- ing to yield, "I can not deny that you have been here.- My terror would belie me, if I did, and beside, Edward, as much as I love you,--and God knows it is like idolatry, -I could not falsify to save even your life!" "Nobly said, my dear girl! and I were but a base-born knave to tempt you to it. But you need not falsify,-you can say you ' have not seen any person calling himself by the name of Edward Wilson, these two weeks;' for I have not called myself so. Beside, if I had, you would not have seen, but heard me do it!" The maiden still shook her head, with a half-determined air of refusal. "Edward Wilson!" she responded, after a moment's silence, "as sure as there is a God in Heaven,-falsehood, deceit, double-dealing, or call it what you will, a lie can never lead to a successful issue, and I will not be guilty of one. Sooner than trust to its refuge, I would bare my breast to the well-aimed muskets of a whole platoon of soldiers, and hope to escape! A miracle may come to defend a righteous act, but dismay and confusion inevita- bly befall the windings of deceit! I will not be a party to it, even indirectly." The young man's eyes flashed with enthusiastic admi- ration for this eloquent preacher of righteousness, for he   THE OLD WINDMLL.         23 knew she was right. He reflected a moment, and then answered. "Well, Margaret, be it so then. Tell them I have been here,-that you held an animated conversation with me, -that I informed you I was on some business against the King, and you tried to dissuade me from it, but could not, -i that I then went out of the building, and have not been in it since. This will be strict truth, for I will crawl out of the scuttle, upon the crazy old roof, lie down among the thatch, and you shall replace the hasp in its hold. If your emotion, and the veritable air of your story, do not entrap them, and put their suspicions asleep,--why then tell them that when I went it was in a heavenward direc- tion, and perhaps I may sometime get there! It would be an approach to it, love, if you could but be with me! Is this agreed to?" "Shame on you, Edward, to jest at such a time, and on such a subject! I have half a mind to refuse all, as a punishment. But this once I'll overlook it, for Mr. Han- cock's sake, solely! If you will be so fool-hardy as to persist in your mad scheme, why I suppose I must enter into it, and protect you so far as truth will let me, but not an instant farther. In the meantime, I will pray for your final admission to Heaven,--although I do hope it will be delayed until we. are together admitted to a little earthly paradise of our own!" "There spoke the heart of Margaret Miles!" said the exulting lover, folding her to his breast. "Now am I sure of success! But come the worst, it shall go hard if this good cord help me not from the top of my aerial tower,   24        HOUSEHOLD TALES. before the English bloodhounds can scent me out from under the hay, that sheds the water from your bedroom. All in good time, we will have a merry bonfire, to light the troops across the water, or to be a beacon of alarm to the watching patriots,--just as the future historian may choose. Verily, though, Mr. Adams should have assessed half the expense upon the King, instead of requiring the Committee of Safety to furnish funds to pay for the man- sion I am- about to make a burnt-offering of! Taxation without representation is the favorite policy of George the IIId and his Ministers!" Margaret had entirely recovered her self-possession, and joined in the merriment which her lover assumed, proba- bly, to assure her. With a mirthful air, he continued:- "It is not a little amusing to think over this business. Here am I, a downright rebel, plotting against a devoted servant of the established government, in his own dwell- ing, and with his only child! Then I am about to hide, like Moses, in the bulrushes,-only not very dangerously near the water! My ark of safety is to be on the sum- mit of an air-castle, about to become a pillar of fire,- and my dear father-in-law-that-does-not-wish-to-be,-who would sooner sleep with a lighted torpedo under his bed, --will slumber unconscious of the fact that I nestle over his pillow, for the proper moment to arrive, when I shall kindle a blaze of glory above his head!" i They again joined in a laugh, and Wilson added:- "So may all royalists occasion happiness to patriots, and furnish fuel to light the beacon.-fires of Liberty!" A short conference followed, --when he carefully exam-   l:J XTHE OLD WINDMLL.                25 ined his pistols, mounted to the roof, and was soon con- cealed in the thatch, while Margaret carefully fastened the trap-door beneath him. As she passed away she called up the stairway,-- ' Good night, Ned, and God bless you! I like you all the better for not yielding to my weakness i " It was well they dallied in pleasantries no longer, for in a few moments the sound of coming hoofs was heard, and there rode up the hill three horsemen, clad in the king's armor. CHAPTER III. MARGARET was not a little agitated at the appearance of the soldiers, who dismounted directly at the door, and demanded to see miller Miles. Although the visit was not unlooked for, she was more moved at their request than was needful, doubtless from the sudden realization of her lover's peril, and it was, therefore, from white and tremulous lips that her laconic answer fell. "He is not at home," she faintly replied. The soldiers looked leeringly at each other, as if to say, She understands our errand, and betokens guilt.' Mar- garet -observed the movement, and was the more conscious- ly confused, as she stepped within the building. "Stay where you are, girl!" the foremost soldier per- emptorily ejaculated. "We  must have some words with you, and mayhap shall walk over the threshold in your good company. Know you aught of a  rebel youth named 3 26   .    HOUSEHOLD TALES. Edward Wilson? He is known to have crossed the fer- ry, and he may have lost his way, and accidentally wan- dered hither!" The insolent air of the petty officer,-for such he was,- not only restored her equanimity, but roused in her some- what of indignation. The nearness of the person in- quired for added to her courage, and turning her full gaze upon-the questioner, she replied:- "What I know of Edward Wilson concerns myself. I care not to quarrel with him, nor do I think the best sol- dier of the King's troops would consult his own good in doing it!" The soldiers smiled with undisguised contempt, though not without surprise, at the unprotected girl's boldness. They conferred together in an undertone. "Young woman-!" said the officer, after a moment, "the fate of both your father and yourself may hang up- on your lips, and we wish well to both of you. Your fa- ther-is suspected of furnishing aid and information to the rebels, through this young man, by imparting a knowledge of some of the governor's loyal designs, which he became possessed of. We know, at least, that some secret plans that he was privy to have got wind; and if not by his agency, there are, at least, suspicions of him. I therefore,  demand of you again, what know you of the movements of Edward Wilson?" Now Margaret Miles was as fully a patriot as the lover she had-just allowed to conceal himself upon her father's I roof, and whose life now depended upon her circumspec- tion. But for all this she was a dutiful daughter, and a t   THE OLD WINDMLL.         27 blaze of virtuous indignation kindled and flashed from her eyes, at the utterance of these suspicions against the in- tegrity and honor of one, whom she knew to be as true as human nature can be, although she deeply mourned that such integrity was used in support of the royal preroga- tive, in its attempts to subvert the vested rights of sub- jects, who had been forced to desperation by oft-repeated wrongs. She forgot her fears, then, in her superior suf- ferings at the insult to her father, and she replied with indignant animation. "Soldier!" said she, "know that my father was never base enough to betray a secret, nor selfish enough to be a rebel against the unwise exactions of an infatuated mon- arch; and as to aiding others less scrupulous in their con- duct towards constituted authorities, the only one of them whom he ever permits to cross his threshold, even for the commonest charities of life, is his own daughter!" Her enthusiastic impulse produced a marked effect up- on the soldiers, and forced a more respectful bearing. "These are brave words, maiden," rejoined her inter- locutor, " and it becomes not a soldier to doubt them.- Perhaps, however, his less-scrupulous daughter may differ from her loyal father, not alone in her principles, but in her practise as well!" The shot was well aimed, and it struck the target! The girl's eyes flashed again, but this time kindled by mingled emotions. Her cheeks glowed with mantling blushes, at the conscious justice of the suspicions implied, while her fears whispered doubt as to the extent of their 'information. Perplexed, yet collected, she answered,-   28     -  HOUSEHOLD TALES9, '"His daughter was never yet charged with disobedi- ence to his commands!" The person addressed slightly inclined his head, land with a smile that was more than half a sneer, although concealed by -the' gathering darkness, he continued his in- quiry, superciliously. '( Possibly, then, she may not be able to tell us anything concerning the before-named Edward Wilson, scrivener, patriot, rebel, and so forth, who left the town yonder; some two hours since, and traveled in this direction?" Margaret began to tremble again, at this persistent at- tempt to discover her lover's rendezvous; but with well- timed command of her feelings, she forced an answer to the occasion. "It depends upon what, and how much, it may please the listener to know.' "You are, then, familiar with the young man, fair lady?" "I know Edward W ilson,-'scrivener, patriot, rebel, and so forth '" "And have you seen him to-day?" "I have seen him within the hour!" replied' the maid- en, growing bold. The soldiers again exchanged meaning glances, that be- tokened satisfaction at the progress made. "Margaret Miles, you are in our power, and we com- mand you at the peril of both your father and yourself, to tell us what, and all, you know of that person's arrival here, for what purpose he came, and to the best of your knowledge, where he may now be 1"   !::?: THE OLD WINDMLL.            29 Margaret, in her turn, smiled sarcastically, as she ven- tured to ask,- "But what may be the nature of the peril I incur, in case I do not choose to impart my knowledge to strangers whose assumption of rights may not please me?" "Then it becomes my duty to take you into custody, to station a guard in your dwelling, and to retain yourself and your father prisoners, until the governor is pleased to order your release." The damsel's countenance changed with a new excite- ment: her lip curled with indignant scorn, her bosom rose and fell tumultuously, and she spoke with an energetic ac- cent her words had not yet known. "' Know, then, brave soldiers!" she said haughtily, "that what I tell you is truth, and no subterfuge;--and much glory may you win, by forcing an unwelcome confession from a defenceless girl! He must be a noble King, that demands men-at-arms for such service! Edward Wilson came here, an hour since, in haste and excitement; he told me that the royal troops would be set in motion, before morning, to destroy all the military stores to be found, and to capture Adams and Hancock, who: are supposed to be at Concord, and if the people could but know of it, there would be warm work for you, on your mas i.. His pur- pose is to spread the alarm, far and wide, .- rouse the min- ute-men, all over the colony. I endeavored to dissuade him from his plans, but could not, and he left me, madly bent upon his errand. He came on foot, and on foot- he passed 'along up " The mad girl gave a peculiar emphasis, to the last three ,r ,    30        HOUSEHOLD TALES. words -she uttered. The soldiers received the recital with considerable disappointment, yet it was so apparently true, that they could not well avoid the very natural inference, that the lover had made a hasty call, arid departed almost immediately upon his mission. They once more conferred together, when the foremost again spoke:- "We can not doubt your word, miss, but regret your mistaken sympathy with a lawless rebel. It is necessary, however, for us to search the building, lest harm come to His Majesty's interest from any oversight. Such are our positive orders." "Let it be soon done, then," Margaret replied, "but I can confidently appeal to one above, to defend me in my sympathies, as well as in my assertions!" Wilson had distinctly heard every word uttered, and he smiled, while he trembled, at the temerity of the daring girl in this covert allusion to him and his hiding-place.- Margaret could not resist the temptation to repay his own pleasantry, in a similar vein, especially when she pre- sumed it would mislead the spies upon her,.whose pres- ence she so much loathed. On their part, they took it as an appeal to Jehovah; and such an appeal, coming from one' so young, and apparently so frank, only added strong force to the conviction that what she had told them was not only seemingly, but really true. They persisted in their search, however, passed over every portion of the building, and inspected every dark corner. As they as- cended to the upper parts of the dwelling, Margaret's excited ear distinctly detected the click of her lover's pis- tol lock, and she doubted not that he who first ventured   THE OLD WINDMLL.        31 above the fastened shutter, would fall, a dead man, back upon his dismayed comrades below. She experienced a singular combination of emotions, in which terror had no. part. She had, rather, an insane desire for the catastrophe, an irrepressible wish for the development; as one stand- ing upon a lofty altitude, and gazing into the depths below, feels an almost irresistible impulse to leap into sure de- struction! Fortunately she was disappointed; the sol- diers, amply satisfied with what they had discovered, up- on finding the hasp of the door fastened within, seemed not to have dreamed of the possibility of a refuge on the roof, and abruptly descended. How often men pursue an object up to a given point, and then for lack of one more rightly-directed step in advance, fail of all! In a moment after, the baffled minions of tyranny had left the dwelling, and mounting into their saddles, they dashed away at full speed, in the useless pursuit of one who was reserved for a better fate. The young lovers experienced a delicious relief at the retreating sound of the horses' hoofs, and as the echoes ceased to come through the darkness, Margaret could not refrain from reading a lesson to her laughing lover, upon the signal deliverance which truth had wrought, while he responded down the scuttle upon the efficacy of serious joking. Ere long the footfalls of the old miller were heard approaching, and the young patriot again screened himself from the chilly April wind, by nestling down into his bed of thatch. No sleep came that night, to the old Windmill, nor to the citizens and soldiers over the water. Commotion and excitement were everywhere visible; preparation for the    32       HOUSEHOLD TALES. destined march occupied one portion of the town, and in others keen-eyed watchers were on the alert, waiting to ,signalize the earliest movement of the troops toward em- barkation. Midnight came, and the clock on the Old South church pealed the echoing hours upon the frosty spring wind, and the sounds were counted by many a weary listener. The moon struggled in its course through ragged clouds, that, like ships upon the sea, were driven before contending winds. The appointed hour for the first act in the grandest drama of all history had come!- The troops were in motion; silently, and secretly, Pit- cairn defiled his regiment through the streets, utterly de- serted, except by the armed patrol. The movements had not, however, been unnoticed. As the troops, with all their precaution, wound slowly down through Dock Square, as it was then, and is still, called, over the mill- pond, long since converted into solid land, just when the right flank reached the ferry, a brilliant lantern swung out from the cupola of Faneuil Hall! In a moment af- ter another depended from the belfry of North Church, 3 j and simultaneously with the last, a rocket blazed away, and went hissing and -shooting into the heavens, from the summit of John Hancock's mansion. Before the sparks had died out, the click of flint and steel could have been heard from the thatch of the old Windmill, as a single / spark dropped: upon the waiting tinder. A match, in a steady hand, fostered the ignition,-a blaze shot up-up above the tall tower, creeping out upon the arms of the wheel, and licking up the dry combustibles with amazing speed. The incendiary who kindled it waited not long to   X1!"         THE OLD WINDMLL.        33 see the ruin he had caused, but casting off a rope he had coiled about the projecting timbers, he dropped it carefully over the eaves, and with the agility of a cat, reached the ground. An excited cry of delight, from an upper win- dow, where love sat watching, fell upon his ear, and tak- ing his course toward Cambridge, he was soon lost in the darkness. But his work was done, and well done. The kindled fire roared and blazed, the brilliant flames tower- ing aloft, and leaping higher, and still higher, as if con- scious of their own part in the work of that night, and in earnest to excel. Luridly the heavens above glowed, as shower after shower drifted to the zenith, and displayed fiery portents upon the shifting clouds. On such an emi- nence it was visible to thousands of gazers, miles upon miles away. Nor was its meaning misunderstood; over the hills of New England, by this signal, beacon after beacon was kindled, flame answering unto flame, and that night alarum bells and rolling drums, and the roar of sol- itary cannons, here and there, echoed over every valley in Massachusetts. The sounds went booming onward, in upon slumbering households, who roused themselves in hot haste, donned the habiliments of war, and sallied out to meet their brethren leagued in arms, until the whole country swarmed with the good yeomen, hasting to unite in solid phalanx against oppression no longer to be borne. The 19th of April, 1775, was a day consecrated by its deeds as one of the remarkable days in the annals of the world, and it was appropriately heralded by such presa- ges, as its bursting morning was fitly baptized in blood, when the patriotic citizens of Lexington fell, the first vic-  34        HOUSEHOLD TALES.            C tims to the tyranny of a despotism, that, by being unwise- ly tenacious of prerogatives, taught the profoundest po- litical lessons to the civilized world. For ever be it green in memory! CHAPTER IVT. THE destruction of 'miller Miles's dwelling, occurring at the dead of night, under ordinary circumstances, would have been a frightful calamity. In the present instance, there were many alleviating circumstances; and beyond the excitement and inconvenience of being roused and turned out of doors at midnight, the evils did not extend. The old gentleman had, before the event, determined to remove across the ferry, and in preparation thereto, the most of his valuables had already been transferred to the residence of a relative in Boston. It was, therefore, but little else than a forced removal, at an unseasonable hour; and as the good man did not suspect the cause of the conflagration, but looked upon it as epurely providential, he gathered up what little property he could, and with his daughter, left the smoking ruins behind, with less regret than might have been anticipated. As for Margaret, her philosophy and cool bearing under such trying circumstan- ces, were themes of admiration, and went far toward rec- onciling her father to his loss! We left Wilson on his way to Cambridge, in rapid flight, but his perils were Hot yet at an end. - The same precau- tion that had instituted the search for him at nightfall, had   THE OLD WINDMLL.        35 also posted spies along the public route to Lexington, in order to intercept any rebel messengers, who might at- tempt to forward information of the events of the night. One of these watchful guardians chanced to be concealed directly in the course of the fugitive, who had been thor- oughly aroused to alertness by the spreading alarm. He was crouched behind a wall bordering the main road, over which- the unsuspecting patriot was about to leap, and the entire person of the latter was fully displayed, by the glowing flames he had kindled in the back-ground. "Stand!-Who goes there!" shouted the sentry, lev- eling his musket at the astonished young man, the instant his foot touched the road. Wilson suddenly stopped in his course, and observing the scarlet uniform of a Regular, stood a moment in mute surprise. "Well caught, you rebel caitiff!" growled the soldier, "and I would shoot you on the 'spot, only that it will bet- ter serve me to deliver you to His Excellency to be hung for arson,--doomed dog as you are! And yet I feel kind toward you for this night's work; for I am a fool if it do not bring me needed promotion!" Wilson yielded himself an unresisting prisoner; not from cowardice,--for he was truly brave,--but he shrank from shedding the blood of a fellow being, alone, in a des- olate place, and for no crime but that involved in the per- formance of his duty to his King and his country. He would have gloried in leading a battalion to a terrific on- set, but he felt, that to take a single life, at such a time,  simply for his own chance to run, would put the seal -of   36        HOUSEHOLD TALES. murder on his soul. He prepared, therefore to wait for some other method of deliverance, which was not long in arriving. His easy capture threw the soldier completely off his guard, and suspicion of an attempt to recover the liberty so willingly surrendered, did not occur to the vic- tor, who displayed not less of nonchalance than the van- quished. A very agreeable understanding, apparently, began to be the result of the loquacity of the soldier, who freely commented upon the events and portents of the hour, interlarded with liberal denunciations of the peo- ple and their leaders, and boastful taunts of the speedy retribution that awaited them. Wilson patiently listened to his harmless bravado, with folded arms, and placid de- meanor, that seemed to acknowledge the irrevokable truth of the fellow's assumptions. Still, an acute observer. would have discovered a latent meaning, in such over-respectful acquiescence, and from the peculiar expression upon his countenance, would have been prepared for the sudden im- pulse, when, quick as a tiger's leap, the prisoner, watching his opportunity, sprang upon his adversary, wrenched the fire-lock from his hold, and dashing him to the ground, in his turn, stood exulting above his prostrate foe. "Well caught, thou royal soldier!" cried the conquer- or, imitating the previous speech of the other, "and I would shoot you- on the spot, only that it will better serve my purpose to let you- go hang yourself! And yet I feel kindly toward -you for this night's work, and can scarcely blame you for being a fool, like the King you serve, to be - counting chickens, before you catch the hen to lay you eggs! But experience teaches wisdom!"   THE OLD WINDMLL.         37 The soldier rose, upon permission, in wrathful mortifi- cation, and was forced to precede his captor in the way he directed, with the firm assurance that he should receive the contents of his own musket, if he deviated a hair in his direct march along the highway. He was too utterly powerless, without his arms, to attempt resistance, and he moved off, in sullen silence, toward Cambridge, furnishing not a little merriment to the citizens, who by this time, began to throng to the scene of the conflagration. He was securely guarded in a clay-pit over night, when, after being sharply interrogated, as to his knowledge of the fu- ture designs of Gage, he was deprived of his uniform and equipments, clothed in a suit of homespun, and drummed out of the village, at liberty to boast of his exploits when and where he chose. "I did not intend to participate, with the King's troops, in the capture of military stores and ammunition to-day," said Wilson at parting; "but tell the governor that if he furnishes examples, he must expect us, as dutiful subjects, to faithfully follow them!" "I will deliver the message," replied the soldier,- a and hope to report an answer when your conscience can not prevent a test of your bravery!" * "As God wills!" added Wilson, and they departed in different directions. As the day advanced the most intense excitement was developed along the route pursued by the troops, which had landed at Lechmere Point, and were pressing into the interior. The minute men flocked in firom every di- rection, armed, each in his own style, but with desperate 4  38        HOUSEHOLD TALES.            ! bravery, and many a deed of blood sealed the vows that had been made, to maintain their rights and defend their homes. Every hillside and thicket along the defiles blazed with the discharge bf firearms, often returned with 1 fatal precision, and pursued and pursuer fell together in mortal combat. At length the royal soldiers, constantly harassed, and hotly pressed upon flank and rear, became terrified, fled in disorder, wearied, famished and jaded ;-  and in spite of Lord Percy's reinforcements, they yielded f:; to the spreading panic, till upon full run in retreat, they ; panted along the highway, like dogs, with parched tongues distended, and haggard aspect, increasing the terror every i where apparent. Lexington and Concord were forever- more names to stir the pulses and to swell the hearts of !. all noble natures. ^            - Two months later, still more terrific scenes were embla-  zoned upon the pages of history, at once as splendid and interesting as any national drama ever afforded. Col.  i, Prescott had thrown up redoubts upon Bunker Hill, dis-  i played by the morning light to the astonished royalists, i! and opening battle was sounding all the dissonance of war. i The attacking forces approached the theater of conflict ' over an unruffled expanse of water, brilliant with reflec- tions of the summer sun, and the dip of oars, and the ca- 2 dence of martial music, blended harmoniously, as the glit-  tering paraphernalia of battle swept over the sea. Ships of war rode at anchor, with the gorgeous ensign of Great Britain spread to the breeze, while bomb and ball carried devastation and death wherever they fell. Thousands of  veteran warriors landed upon the shores of the doomed  g   THE OLD WINDMLL.'        39 town, and under the guide of hitherto invincible leaders, formed in serried ranks, impatient for the conflict, while within the intrenchments the daring and intrepid men who had raised them, waited the coming onset. When the slow and steady advance of Howe's legions commenced, unbounded confidence, and sure reliance up- on victory, preluded the terrific encounter. The Ameri- cans watched their approach with undaunted' courage, as each man poised his weapon, ready for the fatal signal.- "Wait until the coat buttons can be counted!" coolly said the leaders. "Take sure aim, and fire low!"The volunteers observed the counsel, and received volley after volley from their proud enemies, in ominous silence; then redoubt and breastwork blazed -with a continuous dis- charge, carrying terrific slaughter, and the repulsed ranks wavered, broke, and beat a disordered retreat. Exultant shouts rose swelling along the American lines, and a new courage inspired every bosom. The dismayed forces of Howe, after a short respite, again rallied, but with spirits humbled, and dejected bear- ing, they once more advanced, impeded by prostrate com- panions dead and dying, at every step. Again a simulta- neous discharge from musket and rifle, resting upon breast- work and embankment, sent every bullet through a vet- eran's heart, and swept away soldier and leader, as the prairie-fire sweeps over the sun-dried stubble. The 'iron hail' beat back the foemen, who fled in dismay. Meanwhile, with ruthless wantonness, from none but unsoldierly motives, exploding bombs had been thrown into the town, deserted of its inhabitants, and smoke and   40        HOUSEHOLD TALES. flame rose wildly upon the atmosphere. The blaze leaped from building to building, mounted every lofty edifice, and crept up towering spires, till one after another fell in ap- palling ruin, adding terrible splendor to the fatal hour.- Every dwelling upon the opposite shore, every tower and eminence, was crowded with agonizing spectators, and all the amphitheater of hills, for miles around, swarmed with painfully interested multitudes. A third time the assailants rallied. A last, desperate struggle was at hand, but with unequal advantages; for within the redoubt consternation prevailed, when it was whispered about that a few scattered cartridges were all that remained, after serving a single round. Still no man faltered, and when the thinned ranks of their adversaries mounted the brow of the hill, a deadly volley was deliv- ered. Then the slackened fire betrayed the fatal need, and the inspirited assaulters sprang forward, like beasts of I prey. The parapet was mounted,-the redoubt scaled,-  and bayonet and saber accomplished what the leaden rain of musketry had failed to effect. Hand to hand the con- i flict raged, till the unsuccored patriots, over-matched in weapons, retreated, hewing their way through the closing columns to the hill in the rear.            i Many a glorious deed was achieved, many a brave ad- venture, unrecorded, marked the progress of that great day. There was one who lingered upon the rear of the patriots, in brave defiance of repeated attacks, emulous of seeing the last of his comrades safely beyond the redoubt  before he left it. As he moved without the sally-port he encountered the charge of a bayonet, in the firm hands I   THE OLD WINDMLL.        41 of an athletic soldier. With rapid parry, he struck up the point of the weapon, and the two stood, face to face, in deadly antagonism. Edward Wilson had met again the sentinel whom he had dismissed from Cambridge, in obloquy and disgrace! The young patriot saw desperate purpose in his infuriated scowl of defiance, and the Briton sprang back, recovering his weapon with wonderful agil- ity. For some minutes the combat was briskly main- tained between them, with equal advantage; but at length a bullet, from another source, struck Wilson in his left arm; a single second he faltered; his adversary seized the chance offered, and made a desperate charge directly at his heart, as he shouted,- "Well met at last!--Base rebel, die!' Once more had he mistaken the destiny of the noble youth before him! Quick as lightning Wilson recovered himself, parried the deadly thrust, and with rapid stroke, severed the right hand of his foe from the wrist! His musket fell from his dismembered hand, and the patriot's sword-point was at his breast. "I owe you my life, once in your power! Take yours from me the second time, in return!" Such was the hurried ejaculation of the victor, as he avoided the hostile crowd about him, and regained his post with his companions. His wound proved to be slight, and that night he bivouacked in safety, under the canopy of stars, upon Prospect Hill. From that time forward, he devoted himself enthusias- tically to the duties of a soldier, and won the esteem of his companions-in arms, as well as the confidence of that 4*   42       HOUSEHOLD TALES. great man, the commander-in-chief. Soon after his arri- val at head-quarters, Wilson was promoted to the com- mand of a regiment, and in the fortifications on the 'spot where his first exploit occurred, he took a lively interest, and rendered efficient aid. Upon this hill, his regiment was quartered, and the raw recruits soon evinced superior discipline, under the instructions of an officer so effective as Col. Wilson proved to be. But of miller Miles and his brave daughter, he could gain no positive tidings. Unreliable rumor asserted that they had retired from Boston, immediately after the affair of Charlestown, but whither, no one knew, and in the beleaguered state of the town, he could obtain no reli- able information. He might be pardoned for many anx- ious thoughts upon so tender a subject, and even for the despair he sometimes indulged, of ever again seeing her, who had become the idol of his soul. By his silent camp-  fire, or in his solitary rounds at midnight, he was often ab- sorbed in melancholy forebodings, the more severe to en- dure, because they were unspoken. CHAPTER V. NEARLY a year subsequent to the events narrated in the last chapter, another bold and successful enterprise of the American troops was achieved, which infused life and joy through all the colonies. On the fifth of March, the i anniversary of the Boston massacre, the British troops were again astounded at the discovery of strong for/tifica-   THE OLD WINDMLL.        43 tions, under the defense of resolute men, the work of a single night. Dorchester Heights bristled with the prep- arations of war, and the sight was so alarming and won- derful, that 'a British officer declared the rebels seemed to have been assisted by the Genius of Aladdin's Lamp.- Consternation was visible, throughout the royal camp, de- tachmentswere put in motion, and a severe cannonade poured from batteries on land and sea, to dislodge the in- trepid patriots, but without effect. They had obtained a position commanding both the town and the harbor, and they brought their batteries to bear upon both, with fear- ful execution. For twelve days the roar of artillery ech- oed, and at times the hills about Boston were again cov- ered with spectators, who expected a second battle of Bunker Hill. Gen. Howe was not anxious to enact such another tragedy, and on the stormy morning of the Sab- bath, the seventeenth of the month, he ingloriously de- parted, with all his troops, under cover of clouds and fog, and sailed from perils he had boastfully wished for, but dared not meet when they came. Gen. Putnam was commissioned to occupy the town, and a detachment of his troops marched in, under com- mand of Col. Learned, and within an hour after the roy- alists had left them, the thirteen stripes of the American Union floated proudly above every battlement of the free metropolis, for the first time! The following days were days of uninterrupted jubilee. Long months had the doomed town suffered all the hor- rors of siege, aggravated, oftentimes, by vindictive cru- elty, and always by the insolence of an unrestiained sol-   "       HOUSEHOLD TALES.  diery. The people flocked in from the country, overjoyed to meet with friends from whom they had long been sep- arated; families were reunited, and warm embraces, and hearty congratulations shed the sunlight of happiness in ; many a household. The perils of fevers and destitution, the sufferings of cold and hunger, the anxieties of sus- pense were all forgotten, and festivity and gladness bore I universal rule. Still, there were hearts that could never be glad again. Fathers were missing, who went out'for the defense of homes they would never visit more; sons - had been cut down in battle, who were the prop and stay  of disconsolate widowhood; and brother and lover slept  : . on the neighboring heights, nevermore to awaken the fond i- - delights of reciprocal love. In the town, too, desolate  ^  changes had come, where want and destitution had offered the people ready victims to the loathsome scourge, that walked in darkness, and wasted at noon-day. These re- alities opened the fountains of grief anew, and amid the . : general exultation, individuals agonized at woes for which  time itself could bring no cure.             S i Edward Wilson sympathized with these last, and be- neath his forced smile, there dwelt an immovable weight -? of suffering. Margaret Miles appeared not among the ju-  ' bilant population, who crowded balcony and window, to welcome their liberators, and uncertainty hung over her  X fate. There were no ' tender interviews and fond embra- ces' waiting for him; and the contrast of his own feelings  with the exhibition about him, only disturbed his spirits, i and he could not conceal his emotions. To those who re-  X garded his rising honors, and his brilliant capabilities alone,    THE OLD WINDMLL.         45 this was a mystery; but by a few, its causes were under- stood, and he was commiserated accordingly. From the summit of the hill, an evening or two after the army had triumphantly entered the capital, he looked out upon the bay-bound waters of the Atlantic, over whose stormy waves the royal fleet had been wafted on its out- ward passage, and while his bosom thrilled with patriotic joy, at the success of the bombardment from the opposite eminence, he keenly felt how truly the crested billows were an emblem of his own life. Once it had been a full sea of happiness, quiet and serene. Hopes came flitting over it, like ships upon the bay, fanned by favoring gales, and dancing in gladness. Now darkness brooded upon it, and troubled waves of foreboding dashed in spray, only to gather and break again. Hope fled, driven like the war-ships, out to sea, vanishing away beneath the clouded horizon. So closed the night about him, as he passed over the encampment, and thought, moodily, of the once hap- py, though secret joys, that had been his, beneath the structure now-lying in blackened ruin before him. A messenger approached him, with a summons from the commander-in-chief, to repair to head-quarters, at Cam- bridge, without delay. He neither inquired nor specula- ted as to the occasion of the message, nor, in truth, was he glad thereat; for Mars was not the planet that ruled his heaven, at that moment, even though Venus had lost much of her peculiar radiance. Of the two, he rather preferred the light of the latter, dimmed as it was, for his spirits were more congenial to melancholy contemplation, than to active duty. He left the encampment, therefore,   "      ' HOUSEHOLD TALES. in a spiritless and abstracted manner, and was soon at the commander's mansion. Washington himself met him on his entrance, and grasp- ing him warmly by the hand, welcomed him to festivities, that, he assured him, lacked only Col. Wilson's presence, to be complete! He was, thereupon, ushered into bril- liantly lighted parlors, where all things seemed ready for a fete. Adams and Hancock stepped forward, and gave an enthusiastic reception. The same ceremony followed from many superior officers, and from beautiful women, who thronged the apartments, and the young man was in a maze, at the officious attentions, for which he knew no occasion. The air of extreme gayety struck him pain- fully, as if it were assumed in mockery of his own deso- lation of spirit. It began to appear to him an absolute burlesque, and the chagrined young officer recoiled, dis- gusted, from the throng, and with no measured feelings of resentment,-even towards his noble host,-he muttered, half audibly,- "This is unhandsome levity!-It is cruelty!" The quick ear of Washington, perhaps not by mistake, } overheard him, and he responded, with an assumption of flippant raillery,-- "Col. Wilson, you labor under an error, and the first I have ever known you to make! It is decidedly handsome, J. -indeed, a very serious, well-arranged affair! I have  ; had a hand in getting up the scenes, and in arranging the acts of the entertainment; and you must allow me to say I that you judge from partial knowledge, and draw wrong conclusions. It is selfish, young gentleman, to expect all   TIE OLD WINDMLL.        47 the world to go into mourning, because one man's heart wears crape i" "Yes!" chimed in Mr. Adams, who approached them, "or for the whole court to be draped in black, when a young lawyer loses his first suit! Come, Edward, my noble fellow, we are bent upon making you smile to-night, and are going to have a wedding, for your especial ben- efit and pleasure!" An illy-suppressed laugh went round the rooms with these sallies, and Wilson writhed in torture. He was in profound amazement, at such heartless jesting, and from these men-from whom he had ever received the most considerate treatment, and had known only to honor,- for delicacy of sentiment, and nobleness of action! He was in an inextricable whirlpool of grief, of astonishment, and of indignation; and as he saw every eye in the crowd up- on him, and every countenance wreathed in smiles, enjoy- ing his confusion, he was stung to madness. Springing to his feet, in intense excitement, and with flashing eyes, he demanded,- "What means this insult! Why am I made a butt for every man's ridicule! This is the cruelty of opprobrium, and I demand both explanation and reparation!" "Be calm, my honored Colonel!" said Washington, as he patronizingly drew his arm within his own. "Do not overact; this is no facetious occasion,-nor should young men utter heated and unadvised expressions, even in jest, they are so difficult to recall! Beside, we have only be- gun to display pur plans for your enjoyment!" Another general laugh followed, and Wilson's counteo   48        HOUSEHOLD TALES. nance lowered with indignant contempt, as he looked first upon the commander, and then to the hilarious guests sur- rounding him. He could not speak for mortified rage. "I am right glad, my friend," continued the host, " that you seem so willing to be guided by your friends, in a matter of the first importance. We have long noted the melancholy looks, the taciturn behavior, that accompany you, your evident pining for something you could not ob- tain, in short,--your desire for a wife! Mr. Adams, Mr. Hancock, and myself, after considerable difficulty, have at length discovered a beautiful, accomplished, and virtuous maiden, that will just suit you,-indeed she must, for she is a special protege of mine! That she is patriotic, I am not required to assert, since she is willing to link her des- tiny with that of the brave Col. Wilson!" "Nay, do n't exhibit so much painful agitation!" added Hancock, "the ceremony will soon be over! You will not find it half as dangerous an operation as the loss of a limb, and you have risked that, many a time, without a wince. The lady, to be sure, was rather unwilling to as- sent to the arrangement, until you were consulted; but at length yielded to Mr. Adams, who answered for your en- tire satisfaction-after it is over!" "Yes, yes!" pursued Mr. Adams familiarly, "and what is more, Ned, I have promised her that you shall love her at first sight, as well as ever you did Peggy Miles, your old flame of the Windmill!" This time the laughter was unsuppressed, and the vic- tim was utterly astounded. He seemed in the wild fan- tasies of a disordered dream; then realizing that it pro- i 9,   THE OLD WINDMLLo        49 ceeded from what seemed most heartless effrontery, he demanded, with much emotion,- "For Heaven's sake, gentlemen, what means this fool- ery! In the name of decency, let so poor a farce come to an end!" "'Foolery!'-' Farce! '-Are these the terms by which you designate the holy estate of "matrimony?" asked the future President, with assumed gravity. "I can assure you that my good spouse, in her lonely estate upon the banks of the Potomac, would teach you another lesson! However, we do not all love to feast at the same table.- But are you ready for your bride to come forward, with the priest? I fear she wearies of waiting!" A sickly smile overspread the young officer's features, as he began to realize that the affair wore too serious an aspect to be entirely an ill-timed joke, "Gen. Washington!" said he, " is it possible that you can be in serious earnest? ' "Never more so in my life, worthy Colonel!" "Then are you both a madman and a fool!" said:the infuriated soldier, no longer able to contain himself. "And I am about to be a groomsman, to one whom I honor as an equal, and love as a friend!9 was the calm response; "but I never expected to see so true a soldier falter, when the besieged was ready to capitulate without terms! Salute the conquered!" 'As he spoke, he waved a signal, and a side-door swung back upon its hinges, revealing a white-haired old man, with his daughter, radiant in beauty, gracefully leaning upon his arm. 5   50        HOUSEHOLD TALES. There was a rustle and a murmuring through the room, a bending forward to catch a glimpse, a moment of hushed silence; and then a clapping of hands, a sudden hum of effervescent gladness, intermingled with cries of delight, followed by sobs of ecstatic bliss! Margaret Miles had left her father's arm and was folded within those of her lover! Reader, will you be kind enough to tarry awhile, and be a guest at the wedding?

MILTON. THE columns and triumphal pillars that adorn the pub- lic squares of Rome, are among the most interesting ob- jects to be met with in the imperial city. In looking upon the massive structure, the antique bearing, and the hiero- glyphical inscriptions of these relics of ancient Egypt, from whence they were transported by Roman generals and emperors, one seems to be holding converse with the peculiar race that once flourished in superior splendor, in the region south of the Mediterranean. When Babylon, and Thebes, and Troy, were in their glory, Egypt was the world's mistress, in arts and sciences, and these. obc- lisks still testify to the wonderful mechanical taste and skill of her people. The columns were, probably, first formed as monu- mental tributes to heroes and philosophers, and were used to grace the tombs, and perpetuate the memory of men, whose very names perished ages gone by! They are   52       HOUSEHOLD TALES. hewn from one solid mass of granite, varying in altitude, from thirty, to one hundred and twenty-five feet. Of the latter height is that which now stands in front of St. Pe- ter's Church; and the associations awakened by it are pe- culiarly interesting and striking, as well for its connection with two of the most remarkable of the Roman empe- rers,--Caligula and Nero,-as for having developed the incidents upon which this story is- founded. In the year of our Lord thirty-eight, Caligula, twenty- six years of age, became emperor. During the first eight months of his reign, he was lenient and just, and the em- pire experienced universal prosperity. But he soon be- trayed a very different disposition; and became proud, wanton, and cruel, seeming to delight in deeds of blood, and to batten on wickedness. He appeared publicly in the most indecent attitudes; established places of infamy open to all; committed incest with his sisters; fed wild beasts with human victims, in his own palace, and made his favorite horse Consul and High Priest, adorning him X with the most costly trappings, and keeping him in marble apartments. With diabolical ardor he attempted to fam- ish Rome, and failing in 'this, he uttered the demoniac' i wish that, his subjects could have but one head, that he might destroy them at a blow! To sum up the whole of his crimes in one, he at length dethroned the gods them- selves, ordering copies of his own head to be placed on the mutilated statues, to be worshiped instead. For a simi- lar end, he built a temple to his own glory, in the perfec- I tion of which, this very column, of which we write, was l used; he having caused its transportation from Heliopolis,   'THE TRIAL OF GENIUS.       53 at immense expense, in a ship designed and built for the express purpose* - Three years after, the tyrant was mur- dered, as the surest way of becoming rid of his cruelties. Twelve years elapsed, when another monster came to the throne, in the person of Nero. Like his predecessor, he began his reign in condescension and kindness; but ended it by suicide, after crushing the very life out of his kingdom. He lived amid debauchery and blood, sacrific- ing every one who stood in the way of his pleasure, not sparing his own mother; and he died with the execrations and maledictions of an outraged, but patriotic people.- Wishing to realize the spectacle presented at the burn- ing of Troy, he set PRome on fire, and for nine days, exulted with fiendish glee, while the unchecked flames, in raging fury, carried terror and woe to his subjects, whose agonizing wails resounded to heaven. Christians fell vic- tims to his cruelty by hundreds; and Lactantius-'the Christian Cicero'-says of him, and others like him,- "I-ad I the power of language a hundred-fold, still I could not relate all the crimes that were committed, nor recount all the torments, which the ingenuity of rulers devised against unnumbered multitudes of Christians." Beside all these crimes, he aped the lowest vices of the populace, and descended to the meanest arts to secure ap- plause.  For this purpose, he entered the theater and en- acted the most degrading parts. He built a circus for his own especial patronage and appearance, in which the pil- lar from Heliopolis was again put to use. At length, af- ter thirteen years of flagitious power, he took his own life, to avoid being dragged naked through the streets, whipped   54        HOUSEHOLD TALESo to death, and afterward thrown from the Tarpeian rock,   like the meanest malefactor. His circus was demolished, t and the column remained buried in the ruins, for succeed- t ing centuries.                      i At length, in the year 1585, it was exhumed, after -car- dinal Montalto,-the greatest ruler and statesman among the Popes for centuries,--was elected, almost unanimously, to the pontificate, taking the title of Sixtus V. He was the immediate successor of Gregory XTT., who reformed the Julian calendar; and rising, as he did, from the menial condition of a swine-herd, to the highest pinnacle of hu- man greatness and power, his whole history has something i of the marvelous about itt. He was born in 1521, near the little town of Montalto, in the mark of Ancona. His proper name was Felix Pe- .  i retti. He gave early indications of an aspiring spirit, and was placed by his uncle, a Franciscan, in the schools of that order, at Montalto and other places, where he received the usual strict education of the monasteries. He soon became versed in scholastic philosophy, theology and Ro- man literature, and at the age of twenty-four, was an in- structor in the canon law, at Rimini and Sienna. Before i: he entered his thirtieth year, he was a doctor of divinity, and had become famous at Rome as an acute logician and eloquent preacher, where some friendly cardinals procured i? him a permanent residence. His subsequent fortune, un- der the three Popes preceding him, was varied; at one time he attended the papal legate to Spain, where he ob- tained the favor of Philip II. and his nobles; but when  g at Rome, his life was embittered by vexatious controver- I ' iAo1   THE TRIAL OF GENIUS.        55 sies, engendered by the rising jealousies of the monks, and heightened by his own intolerant spirit. In 1570 he was made cardinal, and assumed the name of Montalto,-as cardinals of low birth are accustomed to change their fam- ily name for that of their place of nativity. The great object of his unbounded ambition now was, to obtain the triple crown; and thoroughly understanding the policy of his colleagues, he rightly judged' that the surest way to success, was to pursue a course that would not awaken their jealousy; and he therefore changed his outward bearing, totally. Until he assumed the purple, he was openly ambitious, violent, of great physical power and activity, and of unconquerable perseverance; but a complete reformation distinguished him from that hour, and with the adoption of the cardinal's hat, he seemed to have become another man. He was gentle and forbear- ingr withdrew almost wholly from court, took part with the greatest professed reluctance, in all publid matters, treated every one with the most marked kindness and af- fability, and apparently endured insults and injuries with perfect good will. He expended his income in acts of benevolence, erected monuments to forgotten saints, fed the hungry and clothed the naked, and at all times pre- sented the aspect of a broken-down old man, who loved tranquillity and devotion, above all things else. His met- amorphosis was complete. But under the mask of pious simplicity, and feeble de- crepitude, he was pursuing a systematic course of hypoc- risy, which eventually opened for him the access to the proud goal which lie afterward signally reached. He de-   56       HOUSEIIOLD TALES.            S ceived every body as to his true character, and upon the i death of Gregory, the cardinals, each striving for his own . !; aggrandizement, and jealous of others, concluded that -a :'i': Pope like Montalto could be very easily managed. Ac-  !  cordingly, nearly every vote was given for him, and the moment he was sure of the election, he cast off the dis- 1 : guise so successfully assumed. He entered the electoral chapel, threw down the staff on which he had leaned in his pretended senility, and to the utter astonishment of all his companions, he came forward with a dignity of car- riage, and firmness of step, that well indicated the inde- ; - pendent boldness of his entire administration. The car- dinals were keenly chagrined to find that instead of a fee- ble, gouty old man, with but a breath of life in him, they had chosen a master full of physical and mental vigor, and endowed with knowledge, sagacity, experience, tact, and : ! t resolution capable of anything!! At the outset of his reign, he signalized his policy by : : the summary execution of several noted criminals; thus showing that long-slumbering justice had at length roused. I?! By the aid of numerous spies, he gained a knowledge of passing events, and even of the interior policy of house-  a holds, until he seemed to be endowed with prescience, so j  accurately did his deeds correspond to existing facts. He removed unfaithful judges, reformed abuses, and visited with death all offenses against the public peace and safety. But he was a terror only to the wicked and vicious; for oppressed innocence ever found in him support and deliv- erance. The poor he fed from his store-houses, and he employed thousands of laborers, to keep them from idle-   THE TRIAL OF GENIUS.        57 ness, correctly assuming that industry is a sure prevention of crime. Under this policy, edifices, of beauty and use, were erected, and many of the most remarkable buildings now standing in the classic city, are to be referred to the reign of Sixtus. The Hospital on the Tiber, the Vatican Library, the triumphal pillars of Trajan and Marcus Au- relius, and the noble dome of St. Peter's, with the lofty column in the fore-ground, are imperishable monuments to his splendid and varied zeal. The circumstances attending the erection of this ,last, were both characteristic and interesting. One evening, after a weary day, the Pope was sitting alone in his study, when he was suddenly interrupted by a great disturbance from without. He could distinguish. threatening voices, and the clash of arms. A prelate rushed in, exhibiting great alarm, crying out,- "Holy Father!-the count Ranuccio Salembini, in'ac- companying the ambassador of Ferrare to the palace, en- countered the architect Fontana, in the gallery. A dis- pute arose between them, and they drew their swords; but by the intervention of the guard, they have been separated without bloodshed." "Is it possible!" replied Sixtus, with, kindling indigna- tion, " is it possible, that during my reign they dare pol- lute the pontifical palace by duels and assassinations! I will .punish the guilty men! Cause them to enter!" The prelate retired, and a moment after Ranuccio and Fontana entered, each accompanied by an bofficer; Fon- tana carried his arm in a sling. "Insensible men!" said the Pope, in a severe tone, "you   58       IIOUSEhIOLD TALES. have profaned my palace, aidd you merit death! What  ? has occasioned your quarrel? Speak first, count!"     "I was passing through the gallery," replied the count, 1 in a very indifferent tone, " when this insignificant fellow ^ threw himself upon me, overpowering me with violence,  I for a trifling affair, and forced me to draw my sword in self-defense."                     i ("'A trifling- affair!'" interrupted Fontana, with glow-  ing indignation, " and since what time, signor count, have rape and assassination been 6 triflingo affairs?'"    "Go on, young man!" responded the Pope, in an ap-  ; parent calmness that much belied his feelings, "Go on! it t is your turn to speak, signor Fontana!" "I was promenading, yesterday evening, in company   'i with my affianced," continued the architect with a respect- : ful air, "near the pyramid of Cestius, when I was sud- denly assaulted by three disguised ruffians, who attempted : to abduct my companion, by force of arms. I defended her, as any man of spirit would have done, and received H a sword thrust in my arim. The -noise of the affray at- tracted the passengers, the villains were overpowered, -: one of them was arrested, and proved to be a, servant of ,; count Ranuccio. In coming to you this evening, to seek redress, I accidentally met the count himself, Who turned  upon me, with looks of defiance, and you know the end!" :i "Death upon you, count Salembini!" cried the impet- C uous pontiff, "with your death shall you atone for so gross i an outrage upon public morals. You are a prisoner!"   [ Some peremptory directions were given to the attend-  - ants, and the count was hurried away to a dungeon. ;i   THE TRIAL OF GENIUSo       59 The young Fontana awaited the decision of the Holy Father in his own case, with a respectful firmness. He more than once observed the scrutinizing gaze of his au- gust companion upon him, during a short silence that in- tervened before he spoke. Soon the pontiff raised his stern, yet benignant countenance, and thus expressed him- self:- "Young man, you have committed a weighty offense against the pontifical dignity! Attempts at assassina- tion, even with such provocation as yours, when ventured within the palace precincts/forfeit one's life!" Fontana bowed with modest dignity, as if he knew the fact, and acknowledged the just propriety of the law, but he still kept silence. Sixtus continued,- "Your offense is grave,-but I intend to pardon you, upon one condition. Execute, in the line of your profes- sion, some work sufficient to atone for your fault,--suffi- cient for your immortality, and you shall receive full ex- piation for your rash offense, but not otherwise!" "Say, Holy Father,-what shall I do?" demanded the architect eagerly. "I feel myself capable of achieving any task you may propose, in return for your clemenrcy!" "You are a bold young man!" replied Sixtus, evidently not displeased. C"Do you know the column that in for- mer times adorned the circus of Nero?? "I know it well," answered Fontana. "It has been buried beneath the rubbish for ages; but I have recently exhumed it, from a curiosity to know its dimensions." "I have observed your work, young man, and watched your progress. Can you raise, and remove it?' i   60        HOUSEHOLD TALES. "It is possible " said the architect, after some moments of reflection. "Ah! well, then," continued the Pope, "it must be done! I have taken a fancy to see that column standing in front of St.. Peter's church. Go, take proper measures to raise and remove it to the square, and then place it on a pedestal twenty-seven feet in height. If you accom-  plish the enterprise successfully, I will not only accord a i full pardon for your offense, but will reward you in a man- ner worthy of your talents. But should you fail, you are a doomed man!" "You will afford me requisite means to execute so stu- pendous a labor?"inquired Fontana. "Nothing shall be wanting!" replied the Pope. The architect fell upon his knees, as he addressed His  Holiness with profound veneration:-- "I will willingly perish if I do not worthily fulfill your commission!. I comprehend your motive, holy father!-   i You could not pardon me, unconditionally, without dishon- or to your dignity; but you think to punish me with gen- erosity, and in a manner that will honorably distinguish me. I only await your benediction!" "When you have made expiation for your offense, you i shall receive it!" said the pontiff, with evident emotion. "But go now, and hasten the end." The young man arose and left the palace, with respect- L ful salutations, and from that moment, devoted himself as- ; siduously to his great work. Reports of the rencounter with Salembini, the condign punishment of the noble, and the extraordinary conditions exacted of the nameless ple-   THE TRIAL OF GENIUS.       61 beian, were soon current throughout the city, and each day saw crowds of the citizens about the ruins, where the la- bor was in progress. Some were moved by curiosity, to see a young man who dared undertake such an Herculean task, and some from a deep sympathy, and hearty desire to behold his success. The Pope kept faith with the ar- tisan, men and means were furnished, and no display of interest surpassed that of Sixtus, who often surveyed the multitude of workmen continually employed. Four months later, the column was still lying upon the spot where Nero's downfall had left it, but a more impos- ing audience than his circus ever witnessed, was assem- bled, to witness the closing scene of a grand achievement, or to lament its failure. The great day had arrived, that was to determine which. At the rising of the sun every house-top was crowded, every window thronged, with eager beholders. Dense masses of people poured to the square from every inlet, and were only kept back from the scene of labor itself, by armed guards, who paced to and fro, like sentinels upon a battle-field. Eight hundred workmen were standing at their posts of duty, silently awaiting signals from the mas- ter spirit who ruled them. In the midst a young man was observed, elevated upon a platform, with a portfolio in his hand, which ever and anon he earnestly inspected. His countenance was dignified and unruffled, his bearing calm and majestic, and every one saluted him with respect. It was the architect, Fontana,-and a breathless silence per- vaded the vast concourse, as they turned their gaze sadly from the artisan, to the scaffold in the rear, upon which 6   62        HOUSEHOLD TALES. stood an executioner, with an axe glittering in his hand!  The architect alone was unmoved. Enormous cables encompassed the column, and nearly two hundred horses were attached, while ponderous ma- chinery waited the motive power, to prove that it was suf- i ficient to its end, and well designed for its use. When he had minutely inspected all, and scrupulously compared the several parts with the designs he held, he at length turned  towards the Vatican, where he had already been to re-  I ceive the promised benediction, unfurled a crimson flag, and waved it above his head. At the instant a deep, full sound from the bell resounded, and workmen, horses and s machines were put in motion, while the crowd swayed for- ward, with intense interest to observe all. Again the ar- chitect waved his flag, the bell resounded, and all was still.  He surveyed the preparations anew, ran up the ladders,  assured himself of the safety of ropes and pulleys, and de- scended with a satisfied air. Everything was in order, and -the column had been raised several feet from its bed.  Suddenly there was a murmur and commotion among the  I people, a simultaneous and delicate withdrawal from the  approach to the pedestal, and a new spectacle was pre- sented. A young girl burst from the excited throng, with i her hair streaming over her shoulders, and her counte- s nance glowing with intensity of feeling. She rushed to the side of Fontana, her bosom heaved, and her beautiful eyes sought from her lover's an assurance that all was well. ! It was his soul's idol, Antonia, his affianced! A shout of joyous applause burst from the multitude, his flag waved,  the peal of the bell echoed, and the machines were again    THE TRIAL OF GENIUSo        63 in successful motion, amid a silence so impressive that it seemed almost palpable. Every one put himself to the work anew, and the col- umn rose, slowly but surely, its apex becoming more and more elevated, as it gradually approached an upright po- sition. Forty times the signals succeeded each other, and as many examinations of the apparatus were made, each one rendering success more and more certain. The pil- lar bad reached the brow of the pedestal, and hung, a gi- gantic mass, suspended in mid air, more than twenty feet from the ground. A few moments more, and the triumph of genius would be complete; the severe ordeal would be passed, and an imperishable glory would illuminate the name of Fontana! It only remained to bring the base to its resting place upon the pedestal, to adjust the column to a perpendicular position, that it might descend accurate- ly and securely. It was a moment of intense interest, and a death-like hush pervaded the vast concourse. Antonia, regardless of every thing beside, was absorbed in watching each motion of her lover, each changing ex- pression of his countenance; and when she saw the exul- tant joy of hope, almost fulfilled, play over it, she experi- enced sensations of ineffable delight. But at the very mo- ment of abandoning herself to the most delicious feel- ings, she fell prostrate, as if by a blow, and a death-like chill ran through her veins! She had observed the archi- tect turn suddenly pale, while a terrific despair overspread his features! His muscles relaxed, he let the crimson sig- nal fall from his hands, with a gesture that too evidently indicated the discovery of some fatal casualty, and all was   "       HOUSE HOLD TALES. lost! Thoughtful of her lover alone, the stricken girl threw herself into his arms, and wailed in agony! This touching scene produced a lively emotion in the observant multitude, and a sad sympathy ran from heart to heart, like an electric current. Soon a confused Babel of murmurs rose upon the noontide air, as a rising storm sends up the undertone of winds and waves, even before the cloud is visible, in whose bosom it is nursed. There was not an observer that did not execrate the barbarous in- flexibility of the Pope! An old carpenter, a relative of the unfortunate archi- tect, who had observed the cause of his despair, made his way to the platform, and in a tone unheard except by the S two lovers, said- - "I perceive the trouble, Fontana!-and it is impossible V to overcome it. The fibres of the cables are relaxing, under the enormous weight they sustain, and evidently a catastrophe is at hand. Hear me! Behind the cathedral  I some friends have provided a way for your escape! The means are there, and faithful allies,--fly! Fly for your life!-The people are with you, and will protect you!"  "Never--never!" replied Fontana in calm, but firm   ; resolve. "I have done no wrong, and after such a failure, [ I choose to remain and die!"  Who can tell the sufferings of the sensitive Antonia, at such a moment?  There stood her betrothed, in the two- fold agony of a condemned criminal, and a spirit crushed by disaster, his countenance clouded with gloom, his limbs  failing their office,-and in full view, the terrible execu-  tioner, waiting to put an end to the dreadful agony! He    THE TRIAL OF GENIUS.       65 had brought all this upon himself for her sake, and in her defense, and now she would proudly have yielded her own life, to have secured his triumph! As her restless gaze fell upon his, she observed him about to swoon, and she cried out, instinctively,- "Water! Bring some water!" A sudden inspiration, a sublime revulsion, a miraculous force, at the sound of these words, restored the architect to his full faculties, and a new thought burst upon him.- He started from his stupor, seized the signal and waved it aloft, and taking up the same cry, he shouted,- "Water! Bring some water! Drench the cables!- Drench the cables!"' Antonia and the old carpenter stood with immovable surprise; but the people instantly understood the philoso- phy of his thought, repeated the: demand with wild enthu- siasm, and multitudes pressed on to execute his wish. It was only the delay of a moment, and the operatives were rapidly ascending the ladders with full buckets, and the entire cordage was deluged. Fontana was once more himself, and he even seemed to be ubiquitous, in so many places was he seen directing the operations, with that calmness, and presence of mind, that often characterizes true genius, in pressing emergencies. Nor did Nature refuse her ever-reliable aid, when her per- fect laws were observed. Under her resistless -power the wet cables contracted, the huge column moved visibly up- ward, and prolonged shouts of jubilee rent the air. Fon. tana waved his flag for the last time, in a triumphant flour- ish to the happy Antonia, and the column descended ma- 6*   "       HOUSEHOLD TALES. jestically upon its pedestal! The immense throng of wit-  nesses rested for a brief moment in hushed suspense, and then burst forth the wildest shouts of joy, while waving  handkerchiefs, and uptossed hats, also attested the univer- sal gladness. The architect himself stood speechless and  immovable, with profound emotion.             Antonia, transported with bliss, fell upon her knees, with ( hands uplifted, and eyes flooded with grateful tears, pour- ! ing forth her entranced soul, in thankfulness to Heaven.  The old carpenter, seizing the flag, whichFontana had let  fall, attached it to a cord, and an instant after the crimson  banner floated, like a blazing meteor, in the flashing sun- : light that played upon the lofty summit of the pillar.-- The people could not repress their transports; -thousands  answered unto thousands in triumphant exultations, and the cry was repeated, like the voice of a whirlwind,-  i "Vive Fontana!-Vive le maestro!"    -    Suddenly a new sound was heard, and the cloud of peo- pie turned their gaze, as it echoed out,-        ! "Behold the Pope! Look at the I oly Father! Up-     on your knees!-upon your knees! 'J ^ The Pope appeared upon the balcony of the Cathedral, [: clothed in all the magnificence of pontifical glory, crowned : with his tiara. He extended his hands above the pros-  X trate multitude, and pronounced a benediction.- At this ? solemn moment, volley after volley thundered forth, from 9 the palace of St. Angel, whose mighty artillery added a M sublime grandeur to the triumphant hour. The reverber- . ations had only ceased, when the assembled host took up  a new impulse, shouting,-                i   THE TRIAL OF GENIUS.        67 TTo the Vatican-to the Vatican! Bear the master Fontana to the Vatican!" In spite of his resistance, the architect was obliged to yield himself to the exuberant enthusiasm of the multi- tude, who bore him aloft, with proud gratulations, and in a triumphal procession such as Rome never before afforded, he approached the sacred palace. As he entered the Ho- ly Father's apartment, Fontana prostrated himself, with reverential awe; but the gratified pontiff approached with an air of confidential respect, and taking him warmly by the hand, raised hinm from his humble posture, saying,- "Arise, my noble subject! You have worthily fulfilled your difficult engagement, and worthily do I reward you. I grant you full absolution for your error, and shall hence- forth find means to employ your talents. Moreover, you are made a Roman Knight, with an annual pension of a thousand ducats from the public Treasury!" Fontana sobbed in speechless gratitude, and had St. Pe- ter himself been Pope, he could not have awakened more thankful emotions! Eight days after, he was the happy husband of the de- voted and beautiful Antonia; and a long life of brilliant prosperity and happiness, beloved and honored by his fel- low citizens, amply repaid -him for his painful experience. The column still stands, as it has stood, for nearly three centuries, testifying most eloquently, through summer and winter, through sunlight and darkness, of the Triumph, as well as the Trial of Genius.   THE PROFANE SWEARER.

I't was the early afternoon of a New England summer, and I had never seen the beautiful girl, until ten minutes previous, when her brother Dick had introduced us. We were on the deck of a steamboat, about to leave the wharf of an eastern city. The morning had been sultry, the at- mosphere oppressively rare, and the lowering clouds had  gathered slowly into masses, until the heavens were black,  and the sun veiled. Still, now and then the vapory moun- J   THE PROFANE SWEARER.        69 tains would upheave in singular convolutions, and sudden rifts appear, through which the dazzling light would flash, piercing down through the ambient air, like the spear of an imnmortal. The distant thunder rumbled, the fitful blaze of lightning gleamed, at intervals, in the distance, but the appearances of the clouds did not indicate, decisively, that the storm would come. After all, the boldest of those un- accustomed to the watery waste, can not feel quite at ease, with only a few feet of timber beneath them, and raging waves lashing and foaming and thundering madly around, even when a clear sky opens above. But to all this, let there be added an elemental war in heaven,-terrific fire, leaping from cloud to cloud, and deafening crash of 'the live thunder-,'and stoutest hearts feel a fainting dread of indefinable evil. I was not surprised, therefore, at the be- trayal of anxiety, as well as interest, in the short conver- sation, following her abrupt question. I have intimated that my companion was only a stran- ger; and yet I had long known her. Richard Altamont, two years older than herself, was my college class-mate, and dearest friend; his only sister had often been spoken of between us, and the brilliant pictures of her amiabili- ties, which a brother's love had sketched for me, had crea- ted in my mind an ideal of her, that had come to be an old acquaintance. I had, beside, frequently read her let- ters to him, and their tone of sentiment, mental culture, and moral-purity, justified me in clothing her with very worthy, as well as very lovely attributes. Frequent inter- change of pleasant Messages had passed from one to the other, and occasionally I had been the recipient of some   HOUSEHOLD TALES. small token of friendliness, in the form of Christmas and New Year's gifts, generally her own needle-work. It was not, then, with a common interest, that we met. A little traveling party had been arranged, for an excur- sion during the warm months, and by invitation, I had joined it, on the deck of the steamboat. My beau ideal of Lucilla Altamont had been neither too extravagant, nor too ethereal. On the contrary I had done injustice to her, by my conception of her; just as one misconceives the true beauty and glory of a landscape, by observing it through mist and twilight, when it needs the unclouded sun to develop, perfectly, the alternations of light and shade. MIy picture had been beautiful,-but it lacked the fair proportions, the elegant grace, and above all, the sunshine of the soul, to illumine the temple Na- ture had built. Form, feature, brow, and eye, beautiful exceedingly, alone, when grouped and warmed to buoyant life by kindling genius, have no fit expression in words. I realized it on that steamboat. The confiding music of her voice, would have driven formality from me, if I had felt any; and I therefore an- swered her, on the footing of a familiar friend, as we look- ed upon the shifting clouds,- " I hope it may storm, but fear your wishes will be re- alized, instead of mine." "I admire your candor," said she; "most men would have accorded with my wish, merely for the sake of qui- eting my fears, while in reality they hoped and expected otherwise. But why do you wish for a storm ?" "For the same reason," I replied, "that you wish for fair   THE PROFANE SWEARER.   71   weather;--to behold the beauty of the ocean. I feel as safe in a storm at sea, as in a calm; for it as easy for Him who rules the winds and waves, to say, 'Peace-be still!' as to restrain them when they are at peace. With an un- faltering trust in Him, I am alike protected on land and sea, in the calm sunshine, or in the whirlwind and the tem- pest. There is, to me, something sublimely beautiful, in the lines of Bryant, which have as much truthful applica- tion to a ship at sea, as to the bird upon the wing:- There is a Power whose care, Teaches thy way along that pathless coast, The desert and illimitable air,- Lone wandering, but not lost! " "I feel the justice of the rebuke for my timidity, which your remark involves," she replied, " but do you not ad- mire the sight of a fine vessel, as it sweeps over the deep, like a giant bird ? Mark now, as the sun struggles down through the clouds, how its rays flash through the spray dashing from the boat's prow, like a shower of gems. In our wake, too, see how the waves go dancing in joyousness and seeming mirth, while the clouds play and chase each other, on the reflecting surface of the water! Can there be beauty like this in a storm ? " "Not of the same character," I answered, "for when you have realized the beauties of the calm sea once, you have them for all times, and all places. The same crested foam, the same rippling waves, and the same reflections of clouds, are there, without change or variety, and the beau- ty becomes monotonous. Day after day, and week after week, you may sail on, and the scene grows tedious, and  72        HOUSEHOLD TALES. uninteresting; and what now is enchantingly beautiful, be- comes tiresome and dull. But in a storm, ever-varying grandeur and sublimity unite with beauty; and the soul that conquers its fears, seems above the power of the ele- ments, and looks with awe and silence upon the wonderful exhibition of the majesty and power of God." While we, had been engagred in conversation, the boat had cast off from the wharf, and was rapidly making out to sea. During the same time, there had been such change in the aspect of the heavens, that a promise was afforded of a speedy test of the propriety and truthfulness of my observations. Tile clouds had cumulated in black mass- es, the rising wind sighed through the vessel's rigging, the thunder broke nearer and nearer, and the lightning played upon the clouds in lambent flame. The deep boiled un- der the gusty gales, and the boat tossed upon its vexed sur- face, like a thing of air. Still, the beautiful being beside me, stood bravely leaning upon my arm, while both instinctively relapsed into silence, and only gazed upon the sublimity about us. It was impossible to find utterance to thoughts, like those generated by such a scene. By and by the wind had risen to a hurricane, and the sublimity had changed to terror. Clouds, over-charged with electricity, rushed up the zenith, from various points of the horizon, like winged battalions, and apparently ad- vanced to an attack, with intelligent ferocity. Then from one to the other was hurled the hissing thunderbolts, till the tumult seemed to loosen the very pillars of the sky, and threaten its destruction, while ever and anon, molten i ruin fell earthward, where the fiery current wrought awful   THE PROFANE SWEARER.       73 devastation. It was an hour of fearful danger, and not a few passengers -on board, betrayed their terror by anx- ious countenance and beating heart. The sailors were hurrying to and fro, in the brisk ex- citement of unusual duties, and the loud shout of the cap- tain was heard above the tempest, issuing orders for the emergency. The baggage waas shifted to safer positions, friend searched for friend, and all was commotion. Yet the timid maiden was unconscious of it all, absorbed, rapt in the profound grandeur of Nature. The captain had approached our vicinity, and with his trumpet to his lips shouted to the crew. His directions were unheeded, perhaps unheard, for the roar of the ele- ments was now almost deafening. Again he shouted, with impatient temper, and this time his plainer directions were accompanied by a volley of profane oaths and curses. Lucilla started from her revery with a sudden shudder, and for the first time observed the captain. She turned a full gaze of terrified pain upon him, and then with pale and tremulous lips, she said to me,- "I have not feared this wrathful tempest, the raging sea, the bursting thunder, nor the fiery footsteps of Jehovah, as He has walked upon the whirlwind to direct the storm, --but I dare not stand, at Much a moment, in the presence of a man who curses his God! Let us go below-!" Her remark had been intended for no ear but mine;- yet as we moved away, and passed the captain, he turned and looked upon us, with an expression tfiat showed he had both heard, and felt it. His expression, however, was of mortification, rather than of anger. 7   74        HOUSEHOLD TALES. The tempest at length spent itself, a deluge of rain had  fallen, and as the clouds discharged themselves, the tumult ! gradually ceased, and before sunset all was calm again.- - A cool, refreshing breeze swept over the water, instead of I the sultry breath of the noon-day. As we returned to   i the promenade deck, the ocean was heaving in tumult, like the bosom of an infant, after some fretfulness. We were leaning over the rail, discussing the new beauties of- fered in sea and air by the hastening sunset, when we were courteously interrupted, and looking up, the fine, manly i form of Capt. Woodford was beside us. He bowed with    graceful courtesy, and yet betrayed a slight confusion, as he said,- "You will pardon the interruption of a stranger, madam, but my feelings will not permit me to keep silence. Often have I heard of reverential trust in God, but I never re- alized what it was, till I saw it exemplified in you, to-day, in them midst of the tempest. Your reverence for the sa- cred name of the Deity, involuntarily expressed, I over- heard; and let me assure you, that it shall never again be uttered profanely by my lips, if it be from respect to you, alone!"  I never saw a more beautiful tableau than was Lucilla Altamont, at that moment, blushing like the morning, and g with suffused eyes, as emotions of thanksgiving for good performed, welled up in her soul! She stood, for a mo- ment, disconcerted, not knowing what to reply. Then   j taking a small pocket Bible, her inseparable companion, i she modestly replied,-     - "I am but too happy in having been the occasion of a   THE PROFANE SWEARER.        75 reformation of so unwarrantable a habit,-odious alike, to God and good men. As you have expressed a determi- nation to this, for the sake of a stranger, will you ac- cept and read this little volume, for your own?" He took the volume offered, thanked the fair donor, and walked hastily away. I had serious thoughts then, and many a time afterward, of making a declaration to Dick Altamont's sister, and I sometimes thought he was hurt because I did not. But I never did,-for whenever I made up my mind to it, there invariably was forced upon my thought a very vivid repe- tition of that tableau, with Capt. Woodford interrupting us, and--I could n't! Night closed in upon us, and little circles of friends, on deck or in the saloons, were gathered in pleasant-conclave, passing the hours in social happiness. The captain had been invited to join our party, and before the evening had passed away, we were all interested in his favor. He in- spired one with a confidence in his noble nature, and in addition to generous and manly sympathies, he developed fine intellectual powers, that had been liberally cultured. There was but a single thought to'restrain entire admira- tion of him, and that was an avowal he frankly made, of being a freethinker upon religious topics. To assume that there can be no exalted motive, no en- nobling characteristics about such individuals, would be as extravagant and absurd, as to maintain that half of those who profess Christianity are not poor, mean, illiberal, big- oted souls, who disgrace our common humanity. But the near approach to purity by some worldly moralist, and the ,    76   -    HOUSEHOLD TALES,' disgraceful shortcomings of its professors, are neither of them of any force, when urged against the perfect claims of that pure standard, which teaches all men, everywhere, to love God supremely; and to show it by doing toothers, under all the circumstances of life, what conscience always I intimates to men as that which they would wish, if cir- cumstances were reversed. This is the whole essence of Christian Truth, when stripped of formulas,.that men in"- vent, and quarrel about'; and any character not founded on this, is essentially selfish, corrupt, devilish; and it only  needs the exigency to arise, and the fact is always demon-  strated, however it was concealed before. Edward Woodford's character had been formed upon the loose maxims of the world, and in spite of all his ex- cellences, he lacked the essential element of purity; and before slumber had settled upon that ship's company, fer- vent prayer ascended in secret, from more than one hearty that he might be taught of the Spirit, and become an heir  of life eternal. The following morning we reached the place of our  destination, and as we left the boat, we parted from the courteous seaman, with mutual assurances of thanks for the wayside pleasure afforded. He uttered a hearty     response to our ' God bless you, sir!' as we separated, and the circumstances were jostled from our minds, by the in- cidents, constantly shifting, in the varied life of travel.-- Mountain scenery, tumbling waterfalls, suspension bridgesy mammoth caves, and the wonders of saline springs, each  in turn claimed attention, and gave place to newer fan- cies, on lake and river excursions.   THE PROFANE SWEARER.        " Days and months and years passed away; and if ever a thought of the profane sea-captain came across the mind of Lucilla, it was doubtless embalmed in. the pure fra- grance of holy supplication,-for she was one who lived a life of daily beauty, believing that Amid all life's quests There seems but worthy one-to do men good :- and- when no other means were to be used, she was, like holy women of old, constant at the cross. But the incident was not one of light moment to Capt. Woodford. The appearance and the observation of the young lady in the storm, made a deep and lasting impres- sion upon his mind, and led him to revolve, over and over again, the claims of a Christian faith upon mankind; its professed objects of good will; its beneficial results, even when imperfectly exemplified; and he began to examine its foundations, in a new spirit.' At first, he gave only a casual attention to the Bible, which he had treasured as a keepsake from a beautiful woman, but the more he read the simple Gospels, the more thoroughly was he convinced of the fundamental truth, that Jesus Christ alone brought life and immortality to light. Of the uncertain Future,- the dread, unknown Hereafter,-of the Life beyond the grave, which he had often doubted, he now found incon- trovertible .evidence; and his skepticism fled, as the chi- mera of an ignorant prejudice. Then the sublime teach- ings of the Well-beloved Son, were so full of wisdom and benignity, and so grounded in a knowledge of the human soul, with all its needs, and met them all with such angel- 7*   78        HOUSEHOLD TALES. ic ministrations, that he could not doubt the divine origin of both precept and Preceptor. Thus, before he was fully aware of his progress, he found himself a believing peni- tent, seeking pardon for days of insensibility, and years of ingratitude, while his full heart glowed with reverential homage to the All-Father,-who had made the world so gloriously beautiful, that it might lead man to adore and worship, and become godlike, by godlike deeds of service to his fellows. The' unknown maiden became to him the angel of his hours, and like the star in the east to the magi of Herod, she went before him, leading him on, till he bowed before the Wonderful Child, and poured'forth his adorations, in a better gift than theirs of gold and frankincense and myrrh, --for he yielded up the treasures of a noble, but humble heart, and consecrated to the service of the Holy Bethle- hemite, a cultivated intellect, and the power of genius.- And evermore he kept himself unspotted from the world, but loved in. secret the memory of the gentle disciple who led him to the fountain of perpetual joy.       j IT was again summier. The wheels of time had rolled I on untiringly, and seasons had come and gone. The bus- tie of commercial life was as incessant, and the passage of travelers was as frequent, as ever. Ships and steamboats, in multiplied numbers, ploughed rivers and oceans, but captain Woodford mingled not with the tumult, nor gave command upon their decks. Men, in all stations of life,   u ,! THE PROFANE SWEARER.        79 had turned, or been jostled aside, and others occupied the stations they had filled. The Sabbath sun dawned pleasantly, and showered glo- rious effulgence, over mountain and valley, peaceful ham- let and populous city, where the clanging bells pealed from the domes of a hundred sanctuaries, calling the people to solemn acts of worship; and the summons was answered f  by devout throngs, in silence and contemplation. The citizen mingled with the stranger, and in one group of the latter, there might have been seen a grey-haired father and mother, accompanied by the manly. form of a son, upon whose arm leaned an only sister. The beautiful maiden of sixteen summers needs no new introduction, although the bud has developed into the riper beauties of maturer womanhood. Lacilla Altamont is unchanged in all that we knew of her, years ago, saving that something of dig- nity is added to her beauty, and solidity and strength have come daily, to her attainments and her character. They entered a place of worship, unobtrusively, and after being shown to seats, quietly knelt in act of devotion, while the deep tones of the organ rolled through the vaulted aisles. Choral anthems resounded, bearing devout souls upward,--as on spirit wings beating harmonic ca- dence,-toward that upper temple, where angelic harpers wake seraphic concord. The public prayers were offered, the responses had ech- oed from the rich treasury of king David's Psalms, when there rose in the pulpit one consecrated to the priesthood, whose countenance attested sincerity in his holy office, and whose voice woke solemnity in every listener. Some pe-   80        HOUSEHOLD TALES. culiar sympathy was at once established, between speaker and hearer, and every eye was riveted upon him as he an- nounced the theme of his discourse, by reading the words written in Proverbs xxv. llth.--"A word fitly spoken, is like apples of gold in pictures of silver."       i In one family circle that listened, there was a profound  sensation, as the preacher unfolded his topic. He spoke  of articulate language as the peculiar characteristic, and  distinguishing attribute of man, and detailed its noble  uses. He illustrated its magnetic power by eloquent ap-  peal; its sublime grandeur, by poetry; its pathos; by ref- erence to suffering misery pleading for sympathy and sue-  cor; and its seductiveness, by pictures of love pouring its adorations into ears, charmed as by a talismanic power. From this general plan of his subject, he brought him- self nearer to the individual mind, by an interior view of the language of daily life, and illustrated, in curious ways,  the slander, direct and indirect; the concealed falsehood;  the maligner, worse than fiends, whose truth half-told gives  plausible color to vile insinuation, and makes weight for  suspicious calumny; and that cruelty worse than murder,  the honeyed tongue that steals into the family paradise, to  distill the venom of duplicity, into the ear of some other  willing Eve, who only repents of betrayed trust, to wan-  der forth in agony and shame, through a world that ever  points the finger of scorn, and taunts her for learning the distinctions of good and evil, through the beguilements of a- serpent. "Each word," said he, as he summed up his argument,  s "each word is potent for good, or for evil; and when once   THE PROFANE SWEARER. uttered, it wanders on and on, forever. In the security of unspoken thought, it is mine; and I may retain it, or give it vocal being, at will. But when once it has passed the portals of my lips,. fashioned into articulate life, it is be- yond my keeping, and soars away, like a bird let loose,- and its flight is through the atmosphere of eternity. "A pebble, dropped into an ocean, displaces only a mi- nute volume of the liquid element, and sinks from sight. But the rippling circles widen outward; and ever outward, till the pulsation is felt upon the shores of another hemi- sphere. So is a word, dropped into a human heart. It sinks, and is forgotten; but its pulsations strike across the waters of life, and beat upon the everlasting shores." Then, varying the style of illustration, he said,- "Words are like seeds, and bear various fruit, each crop true to its primal germ. Some fall by the wayside, and lodge in sterile soil, and years elapse before they find the germinating force. Some are buried in vaults and char- nel houses, beside the dead mummies of a past age. But their vitality is still slumbering, and when some Belzoni explores the crypts, unrolls the papyrus, and disperses the kernels of the unknown grain, Egyptian wheat, for centu- ries expunged from the list of cereals, springs to a new immortality, and feeds the nations of a new continent. "Others, again, like thistle seeds, and the whole tribe of maples, pines, and elms, are fashioned by the Great Archi- tect of the Universe, with buoyant wings, that some stray- ing breeze bears up, and floats away in devious flight,- through azure fields, over rivers, prairies, and interposing mountains, till by the guiding hand of the All-Wise, they   82       HOUSEHOLD TALES. are gently deposited in some hidden nook, in the warm bo- somn of the cherishing earth., Another spring-time, like  some amorous lover, sighs and smiles above their slumbers, wooing them forth with woodland melodies, till stalk and blossom, stamen, anther and pollen, yield to the force of Nature, complete another maturity, and untold myriads of new seeds are created, each one a living embryo, to re- peat the process. Chance words are winged seedse,-m- bryos of wondrous vitality! Let them be ever of fragrant flowers, and healthful fruits,-that they may germinate in Paradise, and be for beauty and for food, in the celestial land!"                          : 9 He paused a moment, and raising a small Bible in his hand he said, "Behold this Book of God!" Then, with  much emotion, he told of a terrific storm at sea, and wild tempest on the ocean; of a blaspheming sea captain,- who cursed his maker; of a timid maiden, who trusted in God, and was strong and brave; of a fearful shock given her, by the captain's profanity; of the involuntary sentiment of pious horror she uttered; of its lodgment in the skep- tic's mind; of the gift of her pocket Bible; and of the germinating process in his soul, till he stood forth a con- verted sinner, and preached Christ crucified to his fellow- men, as a life work of love and gratitude, to the Savior who had redeemed him. As he closed his message, with tearful eye upturned, and bosom heaving with emotion, he exclaimed,-- "If it shall be permitted me to finish my course tri- umphantly, and stand among the blood-bought throng, to render an account of good performed on earth,-if any !   THE PROFANE SWEARER.        88 wandering lamb is gathered to the Father's fold, through my means,--then shall there be added priceless jewels to the diadem of that fair immortal, still to me unknown, who will have saved, not only the soul of the shepherd, but of the flock that God may give me, through the undy- ing influence of 'a word fitly spoken!'" There were many hearts touched by his pathos, and many emotions kindled in sympathy with his own; but none could equal that of a fair young disciple, a stranger among the host, who sobbed on bended knees, in blissful ecstasy of thankful joy! Reader!-do you care to be told more of the conse- quences incident to 'a word fitly spoken?' "Enough for this time!" Just so, my tasteful friend! Then, if you please, I will only hint of a meeting of the clergyman and his old com- panions of the steamboat, after service was over; of the swift-winged hours, that passed over two noble hearts, as love claimed its own; of the group that knelt before the chancel in that same church, whose clergyman made the most delicious vow of his life; and finally, of the baptism of the dearest little cherub of a boy that ever you saw, un- der the appropriate name of Altamont Woodford, when I stood godfather! I did right in not proposing to Lucilla, after all.--My presentiment was true,--but I do n't fancy tableaus 1   "OVE A VICTOR.

BAD as the world is, there are numberless redeeming    I features about it; apd one has but to stand by the shore  of the troubled waters of life, and he may pick up innu-  ! merable waifs, all eloquent with inscriptions of that char- j ity that suffereth long and is kind, --of that love which  I overcometh all things,-teaching hope, and trust, and pa-   i tience, under trials and misfortunes. These exhibit the    elements of character distinguishing brave and noble souls  i from effeminate and irresolute beings, who yield to storms,  and go down with the wreck, in despair, when a few lusty    strokes, and a little buffeting of the waves, would have   i brought them to solid land. Miniature histories of this nature are oftenest found re- corded, in the secluded annals of quiet households ; or set like brilliants, in the crown of some retiring woman, who rules from the proudest throne in the universe, in the do- mains of home. Here she wields, with unlimited power,   "OVE A VICTOR.           85 the scepter of influence given only to the mother, the sis- ter and the wife, reaching through all devious life-paths, and holding the very soul in its sway. Nothing so moves a man as the sweet charms of social affections,--those principles of our common nature nearest allied to angelic attributes, ever gushing up in holiness and purity,-- Wells of the wilderness; Redeeming features in the face of time;  Sweet drops, that make the mixed cup of earth A palatable draught-too bitter else. From this exhaustless fountain, flow forth those health- ful streams that nourish the latent good in man, till it ac- quires strength to overcome evil.

This influence, moreover, is as permanent, as it is uni- versal. It watches by the cradle of unconscious infancy; it rules through the sweet life of childhood, when the lisp- ing tongue utters its earliest prayer at the mother's knee; it strengthens with every coming year, till youth advances to manhood, and manhood retires into the shadow of age. It follows even to the tomb itself, where the heart ofttimes lies buried, till brother and lover, husband and offspring, shall rise to immortal union, in the changeless land. The hackneyed quotation of the Roman poet,--'varium 8   86        HOUSEHOLD TALES.           g et mutabile semper femina'--woman always inconstant and variable -is false in philosophy, and false in fact; and X no surer way of undermining all that is sacred in human- X ity, can be devised, than to admit its truth, and to act up- on it. How would it desecrate our household gods, and open the floodgates of suspicion and jealousy! HowX would it embitter every moment of existence, by laying X, waste all faith and confidence, peopling- the world with ? a race of monsters!                  ! Most men have witnessed, with admiration and wonder,  repeated instances'of the endurance of woman's love, un- X der circumstances the most touching and pitiable. Who  X can not recall such a life-long trial! An unsuspecting J heart, not infrequently, places its affection upon an unwor-  thy object, and clings to it, through evil report and good X report, through sunshine and storm, as the ivy clings to the . oak, until it can never be dissevered. Delicacy has been  shocked, confidence abused, fond hopes blasted, innocence i polluted, and still that heart loves on. Nay, more, often has the fondest home been deserted and laid waste; often : made an image of pandemonium itself, and he who might have been an ornament of Heaven, transformed into a   j fiend - but the ties that bound that faithful woman's love have not been broken. Patience, like that of a seraph,  has endured every insult, and every cruelty, till Nature is exhausted, and the weary soul sinks to rest! No eloquence can worthily extol such a principle,--no poetic'rhapsody equal its beauty, its holy sublimity! Its  absence would leave a gloomy shadow upon the world;-- its presence makes it frequently a paradise of joy. i    "OVE A VICTOR.         87 Thoughts kindred to these, passed through my mind, re- cently, in a transit through a small village, about twenty miles inland, of which I knew something, a generation ago. As you descend a hill, from the east, its entire ex- tent is spread before you. The neat white houses, with their green blinds, surrounded with tidy fences, skirt the street on either side; and as you pass on, the sound of the waterfall, and the busy hum of machinery, will assure you that domestic manufactories are here, as everywhere, evi- dence, at once, of enterprise and prosperity. Still farther on, a fine common spreads its inviting car- pet of verdure, shaded by- elms and maples, the street di- vided by it, till it again converges and unites, at the oppo- site side of the village, where it crosses the mill-stream that winds away to the right, through acres of rich bottom land and meadow. On one side of the village-green, the venerable church edifice still stands, flanked by its garden of graves, where - The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep,-- with a school-house near at hand, while upon the opposite way, is the village inn, whose sign displays, in glittering capitals, the words, 'Temperance Hotel.' This is in keep- ing with all about you, which testifies of thrift, sobriety, industry and happiness. Once that house presented a different aspect. Over its door, with an incessant creaking, swung a weather-beaten board, on which was announced a 'Licensed Inn,'-only another term for 'a house possessed with devils.' But th6 exorcist long since passed by, the evil spirits were cast out,   88       HOUSEIIOLD TALES. and the dwelling emptied, swept and garnished. Half a mile beyond, and over the bridge, the most distant house in the village betrayed by its curling smoke - a neat little cottage, snugly nestles in the thick foliage of surrounding X shrubbery. With this cottage and its inmates, we have now to do. Thirty years ago, there dwelt under its roof, a widow and her only child, a daughter. Mrs. Walton had seen much of trial, and was now a suffering invalid. Her hus- band was doubtless lost at sea, as he sailed, years before, from the neighboring capital, master of a merchantman bound for the Indies, and was never heard of more. He left her a young bride, only four months married, expect- ing to be welcomed on his return, by a proud, and happy mother. - Month after month went by, but still no tidings came of the good ship Emeline, nor her fated crew. With overwrought anxiety, came failing health; and at that period when she most needed physical strength, for the double life she bore in her person, she lacked it most . At length suspense grew to dread, and dread well nigh merged in despair, and the suffering woman yielded to the bitter flood that rolled over her. She gave premature birth i to a daughter, and as the child fluttered between life and death- between earth and Heaven- the mother lay in utter prostration, incapable of yielding it the slightest suc- cor. Yet both survived, and passed many years of hap- piness together, always tempered somewhat, by their pe- culiar fountain of sorrow. The mother never recovered health, entirely; but by the careful nursing of gentle at- tendants, the child conquered in the battle for life, and in   "OVE A VICTOR.         89 . a few short months, was as rosy, and as lusty, as a hardy nature-its sole inheritance from its father-could make it. The little Emeline--so named in memory of .the lost ship--was everybody's favorite from her nativity. The maiden grew up to be worthy of all the considera- tion she received. Though neither a sylph nor a' fairy, she was not lacking in personal charms; yet it was not to these she owed the sway she held among her compan- ions. She was generous and pure-minded, loving and gentle, more ready to make another happy, than to seek for personal gratification. At the same time, she was res- olute and persevering, and seldom failed to effect what she purposed-thus uniting the promise of great usefulness in life, with superior attractions. *With such graces of character, it was only natural that the young people of the village, as well as the elders, esx- hibited their attachments, and vied with each other in de-- votion to the fatherless girl. In the long, pleasant, sum- mer days they mingled in rural sports, roamed the fields, and sailed upon the still waters of the gliding river, in all the joyousness of young blood, and every gathering was spoiled of its charm that did not secure ' lovely Emeline Walton.' At school, precedence was accorded to her, both as a right and of choice; for the sedate character of her mind led her to excellence in intellectual pursuits, as well as in social charms. During the long winter evenings, the society of the in- habitants of the cottage was more frequently sought at the cottage itself; since the inclement season confined the mother at home, and the daughter remained with her, as 8*   90        HOUSEHOLD TALES. well from preference as from duty, and the choicest pleas- ures of the, charming girl's companions were found in af- fording amusement and happiness to the invalid. Thus passed the early years of the orphan. Many a young knight felt himself warmed to chivalrous attention to the fair girl, and for a long time she exhibited no preference among them, observing toward all a gentle and affectionate courtesy. She regarded them almost as brothers, and in the purity of her thoughts, she knew no harm, in a sisterly and unreserved demeanor. Number- less little attentions were paid to her, numberless favors bestowed, that excited no remark, and occasioned no em- barrassment, simply because she was Emeline Walton, and not another. But as she advanced to womanhood, the spirit of her dream was changed. The-young men grew shy, distant, and formal. Each felt secretly desirous of her love, and each was naturally distrustful of personal claims, as com- pared with some equal. The poor child felt the growing reserve manifested toward her, but did not understand its philosophy; and her heart was, therefore, the more readily i won by that one among them, who had sufficient boldness to press his suit. This was young Bartlett, an apprentice to  the only trader in the place, at that period, a youth of un- s exceptionable character, and of fine promise. Possibly  upon him, above all others, the rich treasures of her affec-  tionate nature would have been bestowed of her own free  choice, had it been- her privilege to select a lover; for he  was manly, generous, free-hearted to a fault, and almost i as great a favorite as herself. However that may be, she    "OVE A VICTOR.         91 was pleased with his partiality, came to anticipate their meetings with zest, and at length they mingled their mu- tual vows, and were happy in loving and being loved. The relations that existed between them soon came to be understood by the villagers, and the general voice con- ceded the result as eminently happy for both the lovers. The ever watchful eyes of the widow had observed the growing attachment, and she was pleased at its evident pro- gress; although mother and daughter had maintained a studied silence regarding it. The time had come when that silence was to end, and one afternoon, when the two were busy at their little work-table, the widow abruptly broke a pause that had for a few moments existed, by in- quiring, with a- lurking smile,- "Emeline, why do you suppose Edward Bartlett visits us so frequently, of late? The damsel was taken by surprise, which evinced itself by confused blushes, as she haltingly answered,- "Why,mother! Edward--I- H-is there anything wrong in his coming?" "I trust not, my child!" replied the widow, not a little amused; "but I thought that possibly, you might give some particular solution to his course." Emeline could not have told why, but she was speech- lessly confused, and after a moment, burst into tears. "My silly child!"? continued her mother, "I did not in- tend to embarrass you so much! But you have only con- firmed what I knew before. Your mother has no objec- tion to your attachment, provided Edward honorably re- turns it, as I believe he does."   92        HOUSEHOLD -TALES. "Oh! best of mothers!" cried the joyfully excited girl, throwing herself upon her mother's bosom, "Edward loves me even better than I do him, and we had agreed upon this very evening to tell you all, and ask your approval!" "I have no wish in life, but to see my daughter happy," replied the good woman, " and you have my approbation, and my blessing, before it is asked. I should be only too glad to see my darling child the wedded wife of so good a man as Bartlett promnises to be! When I am called to meet your dear father, I feel that I could leave you with such a companion, willingly and trustfully. But another time we will talk further; my head is aching now, and I must lie down." Another time, however, never came. The invalid, by slow degrees, faded away, and after a few short weeks, the bereaved orphan was the sole occupant of the cottage be- neath the elms. The widow was followed to her resting place, beside the ancient church, by many sincere mourn- ers, and among the monumental slabs in memory of the departed, a pure white tablet yet stands conspicuous, bear- ing a record of the name of the deceased, with a reference to her early bereavement, and an inscription upon the base, in the simple words - "Erected to the memory of departed parents, by, the filial love of an only child." After the lapse of a few years, the cottage walls again were melodious and vocal with happiness. A mother's love once more realized the blissful fruits of maternity, as innocent childhood invoked spells upon the heart, that have i ns answering symbol. The sweet prattle of infant lips,   "OVE A VICTOR.        93 awoke deep sympathies, and generated enriching processes within the mind of the fond mother, who was realizing all the delights of young love's home. Edward Bartlett was the head of the happy family, and Emeline Walton's pure nature was repeating itself, in the group of children that she cherished and guided in pleasant ways, till her heart Was filled with all superlatives of bliss. The father had begun to fulfill the promise of his early manhood; the old sign, upon which, for so long a period, the villagers had read the sole name of William Bosworth, had been removed, and another substituted, that bore the united names of master and apprentice, who were togeth- er on the full tide of commercial prosperity, gathering wealth by mutual labors. With his business success came popular favor, and public adulation. Town and State of- fices sought him out for civil duties, and in a community where all were soldiers, military honors were thrust upon him. The sphere of his action was large, and the theater of his influence proportionately extended. Unfortunately for public men, it ever happens, that a man is beset by temptations, in proportion as he wanders from the charmed circle of home influences. Here, if in any place, is purity, - here alone, is peace. Without its pale, a thousand assaults are made upon virtue, and many that seem strong, gradually give way to insinuating seduc- tions, and at length are undermined, falling, like towers in prostrate ruin, involving many around in destruction with themselves. Manyocombined causes contributed to bring ruin upon   "       HOUSEHOLD TALES. the happy home at the cottage; that already adverted to had its influence, but especially, the habit then every- where universal, of the constant indulgence in intoxicating drinks. Edward Bartlett became a victim to this Jugger- naut of christian lands. His popularity forced him often where he must not only furnish the stimulus to others, but indulge himself, as a proof of social fellowship. His gen- erous nature now became a snare, and hastened the crisis, till from being forced by custom, he was led by the strong- er power of appetite, and yielded a slave to a debasing vice. As thousands have done before him, as thousands are still doing, he became a drunkard. Step by step he went the rapid road to ruin. From the incipient developments in his altered countenance, through the commencement of manifestations of fretfulness to wife and children, neglected duties, midnight revels, -morning brutality, and the gripe of coming poverty, every stage of the living death he passed in its turn; till at length expos- tulation and entreaty were alike exhausted, bankruptcy was upon him, and a dissolution of partnership finished the career, even if the last hold upon a reforming influence could have availed to retard it a little longer. Mortifica- tion and public disgrace gave him a demoniac impetus, and uniting himself in companionship with the most de- graded, he brutalized himself to their level, and sought a constant gratification of his appetites at the village tav- ern. His previous exaltation only made his degradation more palpable, and sunk him lower; as Lucifer's fall was preoeminently disastrous, from the height of his previous glory.   "OVE A VICTOR.        95 One glance at the little cottage, and the story of misery there is told. The garden walls are broken down, and the untrimmed hedge betokens long neglect; the once tidy gate is dilapidated, hanging on broken hinges, and weeds have overgrown the yard. Loose clapboards are rattling the drum beat of ruin on the walls, and paneless windows are unseemly, with ragged garments interposed to the pit- -iless wind. Ragged children, pale and emaciated with hunger and sickness, cling to the tattered skirts of the hag-  gard mother, wearied and worn with labor, and jaded with watching and fasting. When the dreaded, yet longed for footfall of the father is heard to approach, a new terror blanches the suffering cheek, and as if by fearful instinct, the children glide, ghost like, into hidden corners, to cower for safety. Such the glimpse afforded of a home once so prosperous, so plentiful, so happy! The terrible realities can never be realized, except from the remembrance of sufferings akin to them. As when some tempest, rising in distant, sullen clouds, with fitful, moaning winds, gathers intensity of de- structive power, till bursting in the wild whirl of a terrific hurricane, it scatters desolation and utter ruin; but no de- scription can picture its trail of death. From the kind-hearted husband, the loving, indulgent father, the genial, noble man, Edward Bartlett had become an impersonation of cruelty, vindictiveness and revenge. Not content with having brought want and mental agony into his dwelling as constant guests, he superaddedperson- al violence and brutality, updn the -sweet babes he once loved to fondle, and the lovely companion whom he had   96        HOUSEHOLD TALES. folded to his bosom with ecstasy, as the idolized wife of his youth, kissing away the tears of solitary orphanage, as he pledged her sympathy, protection, and undying love. He saw her forced to subsist upon the charity of old friend- ships, .or in declining this with womanly delicacy, he knew she overtasked herself in laborious struggle with her nee- dle, for the scarce sufficient pittance of bread to keep her children from actual starvation. One after another disap- peared articles of furniture, the dying legacy of her moth- er, which the brutalized man bore away in secret, or with cruel violence, to furnish means for still more beastly in- dulgence; and when her silent tears became irrepressible, rising upon her with the maledictions of a fiend, he would give loose to his passions in blows and fierce assaults, that ! left their livid testimony, in the marred visage of an angel of this lower world, for weeks and months. Amid all this, no word of reproach escaped her, no pet- ulancy, no vindictive thought. God and her children-- upon these she rested her broken, bleeding spirit, and re- ceived the holy benediction of their pure love, to soothe somewhat her anguish, to heal the crushed spirit. She clasped her Bible to her bosom in the dreary midnight, kneeling alone- beside her sleeping infants, as the sublime words of Revelation, filled her with a trustful faith. Her eyes were blinded with thankful tears as she read-  "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the  blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne i of God, and serve him day and night in -his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.- I   "OVE A VICTOR.         97 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; nei- ther shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes." Her vision carried-her beyond the troubled waters that well nigh overwhelmed her, and gave her a full view of the white-robed ones; and remembering that the Lamb of God had been a voluntary Prince of sufferers, setting her an example of patient endurance, she almost felt joyous at the fiery baptism through which she passed. It taught her still to pity, still to love. Therefore it was that for- bearance, gentleness, and goodness shone in her life- As living jewels, dropped unstained from Haven. The maledictions of her husband were only answered by kind deeds, and soothing words. Every new act of in- dignity, served as a new incentive to her devotion, and a new motive to seek aid and strength in prayer. When the friends who still loved her as of old, would plead with her to abandon him, as hopelessly wedded to his criminal courses, and tell her of the life peril that she suffered, she only answered, with tears that revealed her keen agony-- "God will not desert me! ily poor husband needs my pitying love more than evser. Forsaken of all the world, outcast, miserable and despised, shall I too, abandon him? He may yet reform,--but I have vowed to cherish until death, and that alone shall separate us." Eternal-flower of Love! Its crushed petals exhaled a fragranae, enchanting the senses, amid pestilential deah! 9    98        HOUSEHOLD TALES. The living embryo of a true woman's faith, swelled in her soul, and she saw a rainbow led out upon the somber bo- som of the clouds, where others recognized only the black- ness of midnight gloom!      , Woe followed upon woe in the stricken household, and all the degrading cruelties that sottish imbecility can in- vent, were visited upon wife and children. Never came slumber to eyelids that were not closed in terror and in dread. The drunkard slept, when he slept at all, with a bottle at arm's length, resting upon the broken deal table that alone was left, and in wakeful moments he poured the fiery liquid down his throat. But if the cups were emp- ty, as often proved the case, he vented his insane yage, in terrible cruelty, upon the innocent beings that cowered in terror around. He was only not a murderer, because his palsied hand failed to give effective force to murderous implement and aim. Late one night, in the midst of severe winter weather, his wife sat waiting his arrival, crouching over a feeble fire, as she plied her needle upon a garment whose price was to be added to another like sum in her purse, to pur- chase, on the morrow, another small stock of food and fuel, of both which she was then destitute. By and by the silence was broken, and the distant sounds of irregular footsteps approached, entered the gateway, and were at the door. Bartlett staggered into the room, seemed not to ob- serve his wife, but with inarticulate mutterings, managed to reach the bed, placed his bottle on its usual stand, and in a few moments breathed heavily, as in a drunken sleep. His face was toward the door, and he appeared insensible.   "OVE A VICTOR.         99 Without, a cold storm raged, and sleet and hail beat up- on the windows with pitiless power. Bleak winds swept onward, turbulent and wild, waking doleful howlings, and sighing through every cranny in the building, mingling in mournful unison with the disturbed breathing of the chil- dren, who slumbered unconscious, on their scantily cov- ered pallet in a corner of the room. The sounds went to the heart of the desolate woman, and as she finished the task upon which she had labored, she arose, went to the door to stop out the snow that penetrated- through its crevices, re-arranged the old garments that the wind had forced from the broken panes, and carefully disposing the clothing about her husband's person, she sat down again , to read from her Bible, by the light of dying embers. Soon the last blaze flickered, the last spark died out, and she prepared to take her accustomed place, to impart a new warmth to her nestling children. Her last thought was of her husband's comfort, and as she again disposed about him the clothing which he had displaced, she chanced to observe that the stopper was missing from his bottle, and the liquor had been' spilled! Her cheek grew still more pallid than want and suffering had made it, as she thought of the possible consequences. Before the morning light, if his delirious appetite were un- appeased, her children might be mangled corpses, butch- ered by their own father! She uttered a stifled groan of despair, and then tears flowed over her agonized visage, while she pressed her hands upon her heart, as'if to pre- vent its bursting. A brief moment only she stood irresolute, and then her   100       HOUSEHOLD TALES. purpose was taken. Kneeling down by the bedside of the : drunkard she poured her misery into the Ear that is nev- er shut, she trusted in the Heart that never deceives. "Oh! my God!" she prayed, "forsake me not in this, my dire extremity! I take the bread from my clhildren's mouths to save their lives! Protect them in my absence, preserve me in stormy perils, and overrule all things for the good of Thy suffering children!" She arose calmly, went to a secret closet and counted out the last cent, drew an old shawl from the children's bed, wrapped it closely about her, and taking the bottle, she hastily left the house. The only place where her er- rand could be aided, was the 'Licensed Inn,' and thither she directed her steps. Dreary and painful was the way, through gathering snow drifts and biting winds, from which her scanty clothing but illy protected her, and as she sped on, wearily, over the bridge and into the village, the storm gusts roared fearfully through the bending trees, and she Heard- the spirits of the wind, Growling among their bougLhs. As she passed the grave-yard and the church, her atten- tion was arrested by the tolling of the-bell, while the clock struck midnight. The solemnity of the hour waked the memory of a sad association, and pausing a moment, she could distinguish the tablet over the grave of hermother. Overwhelmed with emotion, she moaned bitterly, and with fresh flowing tears, she exclaimed,- "Oh, my mother!-Would to God thy daughter had died for thee "s   "OVE A VICTOR.        101 Recovering resolution, she again hastened onward, and soon stood within the doorway of the inn. Some com- panions of her husband were still lingering in their cups, and her appearance among them, in such a storm, and at such an hour, was sufficiently startling. They slunk away from the bar when she approached it, as if a spirit glided in, and left her free to do her errand. She deposited her money and her bottle together, and without an uttered syl- lable, the landlord filled the flask, took the offered coin, and she left the sottish group as silently as she entered it. When she was recognized, by after inquiry, incoherent curses were showered upon 'that devil of a Bartlett,' and the tipplers were once more brutishy dozing around the bar-room fire. The return of the wearied woman was accomplished at length, but with great peril. The drifting snow was piled in her path, and more than once it seemed to her that she must sink down, and perish in the storm. Then the re- membrance of her helpless infants, and their terrible dan- ger, nerved her with courage and new strength, till at last she entered the familiar gateway, and her journey was at an end. Carefully she undid the door fastening, and with cautious step entered her dwelling; all was still, save the respiration of the loved ones, and when she had assured herself that everything was as she left it, placing the full bottle upon the stand, she murmured, joyfully,- "Thank God, they are saved!" That night was a quiet one in the little cottage. The fatigue of the mother weighed her senses in deep slumber, almost as soon as her limbs had touched the bed, where 9*   102        HOUSEHOLD TALES. her darling infants rested, in forgetful dreams. Her own sleep was visited by incongruous visions, some of which her memory ever retained. Now, she was in a luxuriant garden, overloaded with tempting flowers and fruits, and when about-to pluck the luscious weight of the branches, to satisfy an inappeasable craving, a hideous serpent un- folded its scaly coils, and she fled in dismay. Still at- tracted to the enchanting place, the hissing tongue, and fiery eyeballs gave a new affright, till suddenly, an angelic creation descended from a storm of sleet, the serpent sank into an opening cavern, and celestial delights followed the overpowering dread. Then she seemed to be borne, by irresistible power, to- ward a raging cataract, that tumbled over jagged rocks, from which depended the mangled limbs of her husband; and in spite of fearful groans that echoed around the hor- rible precipice, she could not avoid approaching its verge, with children clinging to her skirts, while she felt impelled to slide, unresistingly, into the yawning abyss. Again an angel's face appeared, from the vapor that' floated above the waters, and a sudden whirl of elements changed the scene to midnight darkness, and pelting storm. Thus was her wearied mind involved in painful fanta- sies, till exhaustion chained her in heavy slumbers, from which she was aroused late on the following morning, by the prattle of a child. "Wake up! wake up, dear mother! God has made us a bright new day!" She knew the voice, but the face of the angel had disap- peared in the cloud! Still its smile and its beauty seemed   "OVE A VICTOR.          03 reflected in her heart, as when the serpent fled, and she tasted blissful fruit, in the garden of dreams! The tempest was over, as the little child had intimated, and the sun streamed through the windows, with all the i beauty of a clear winter morning, when myriads of jewels spangle earth and air. The mother felt a singular calm, as she kissed her loving children, and rose from the couch. Her first thoughts were of her errand over-night, and as her eye glanced at the table, she observed that the bottle had not been touched! With a painful dread of evil she turned to her husband, whose breathing she had not no- ticed. His full gaze met hers, and as she stood astonished, she seemed to hear again, the hissing of the serpent, as he recoiled to his cavern! The redeemed man sprang from the bed, clasped his wife to his bosom, and the two mingled their voices in unrestrained weeping. "Oh! Emeline!" said he, as soon as he could suffi- ciently compose himself, " you are an angel! I saw it,- I know it all! How could you go out in such a storm, to gratify so base a fiend as I? I have been all night awake -I have suffered ten thousand deaths! I would have de- stroyed myself, but I dared not plunge into perdition.- Can you still love me, still trust me, and help me yet to be worthy of your love?--for I call Heaven to witness that I will never touch a drop of spirit again!" She could answer him only with sobs, more eloquent than words. With an earnestness in character with his language, he seized the bottle, and was about dashing it to atoms, when he suddenly restrained himself, saying,- "No, no, it shall never be destroyed! I will keep it, to   104       HOUSEHOLD TALES. teach me the-price of my salvation; and when I am tempted, Hwill look upon this, and remember the suffer- ings and compassion of my angelic wife, always noble, al- ways good; of my neglected, starving children; of what I have- been, and what I am. I will think of this terrible night; of your exposure and agonies; of your last cent given for my vile appetite, and then I shall be strong,-I shall be true!"             ;  There was no food in that dwelling on that cold winter morning, no fuel, no fire: but such gratitude and joy, such outpouring of thankfulness to Heaven, as were never sur- passed. Prosperity and returning comfort, confidence and domestic bliss were born anew; and the glorious sunlight of Faith shed its life-giving rays into every heart. Child- ren were overwhelmed with caresses to which they had long been strangers, and parents mingled mutual pledges of renewed affection, counseling of the happy future,- and that morning, with all its poverty, was the pleasantest the little cottage had ever known. There is no joy like sincere penitence; no comfort like that which springs from forgiveness; and no thrilling ecstasy of bliss, like that which rises, phenix-like, from the ashes of despair! Edward Bartlett's reformation was sincere and perma- nent. Although he had everything to struggle against, from that hour he battled with life as one resolved to be a victor, and he bore away the laurels. When it was known that he really strove to redeem himself, friends gathered round to sustain, to encourage, and to sympathize. He labored, at first, in menial employments, and for small wa- ges; but when confidence was established, he was again   "OVE A VICTOR.        10o - demanded in responsible stations, even in the store where his boyhood had been passed; and the master having been gathered to his fathers, Bartlett succeeded to the business. The little cottage is more enchanting than ever, with the tI  happy mother and her delightful children, tempered by the prevailing charms of unostentatious piety. The bowers of jasmin and honeysuckle seem to exhale thanksgiving, and the warblings of summer birds are like melodic peans to the effective, holy influence of womans love. i                     .        , p*,   DORA NORTON. THE DEAD ALIVE AGAIN. O mY love! my wife! Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: Thou art not conquered; beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips. SHAKESPEARE. THE incidents I am about to record, are only a new il- lustration of the frequent experience in the world of sen- timent, of truths stranger than fiction. While I write, the minutes of the tale are before me, in the fair hand-writing of the subject herself, just as they were furnished to me, years since. They have been laid away, for a long time, and a chance circumstance has only now brought them to my knowledge. In searching for some missing manu- scripts, I discovered these papers among others, and the envelope arrested my attention. As I unfolded the package, the spiritual presence of a once loved, and much valued friend seemed with me; and although she has long been a tenant of 'the narrow house,   DORA NORTON.          107 and the breathless darkness,' I almost feel that she sits be- side me. I can hear her low, musical voice, as I so often !  used to hear it, in the unrestrained converse of a devoted I  . friendship, ever pouring from a rich intellect the best of lessons, prompted by a heart richer still. Indeed, I can hardly convince myself that the records to which I have alluded, have not been written by ghostly fingers; for how I became possessed of them, or when, or where, I have no certain assurance. When I connect this fact with the startling passages in the history I am about to collate, I feel no slight degree of awe, which the deep silent midnight-the time at which I write--helps immeasurably to augment. Not that I am fearful of ghosts, or have any special faith in them, never having encountered one, although I would be glad to do it, on psychological grounds alone. I am far from echoing the prayer of Shakespeare,- Infected be the air whereon they ride, And damn'd all those that trust them! for incorporeal as they must be, I doubt any deadly taint in the atmosphere, left by their passage; and if they come as good angels, and I do not expect them in any other ca- pacity, I would sooner breathe a blessing than a curse, at their visits. But this is digression. I have said that the manuscript of my friend excites a feeling of awe within me, as being that of a deceased per- son, and of a peculiar character, while I cannot tell how I came by it.. I remember, however, that we were one day sitting in conversation upon some strange phenomena of   108      HOUSEHOLD TALES. life and death, suggested by a paragraph in a newspaper, under the startling heading of ' Buried alive.' She gazed upon the burning coals of the grate, with an abrupt silence, as if she were reading some strange histories there, and then rising to:leave, with much singular emotion, at that time inexplicable, she said, with startling intonation, - 6 Sometime, but not now, I will tell you a story of my own life; or rather, I will give you a written synopsis of it, and you may write it out in your own way." She passed out of the room, and I never saw her after- ward, except as I see her now, with the inward vision of Faith and Memory., She was an invalid, and. the wife of a most amiable man, her second husband; and although resident in the same hotel, we met only at irregular inter- vals, except at table. From that day, she kept to her own apartments, until, a short time after, during my temporary absence from the city, she went to seek for health in the more salubrious region of inland mountains. But she did not recover. Her malady, a paralytic affection, recurred with fatal promptitude, and in a few weeks she found rest in the narrow house builded for all living, entering doubt- less, upon a more healthful mental life, in another world. She had free access to my library, however, at her own option, and she availed herself of its resources, very fre- quently. As I recognize her manuscript, then, and know from its character that it must be that which she promised me, I have no doubt that she placed it upon my table, or dropped it into a drawer, when in my apartment on an oc- casion of this kind. The thrilling -facts described suffi- ciently account for her emotion, and her peculiar manner,   DORA NORTON.         109 at our last interview; and to account for the mystery of its present possession, I have only to suggest, that it was, probably, overlaid and overlooked by accident, until the' occasion of finding it. Either this solution is correct, or a spirit hath 'walked the earth unseen,' coming from another sphere to redeem a last promise. I lay the incidents be- fore each reader, with an unabridged privilege of making his election of probabilities. The impregnable fortress of Gibraltar, situated at the entrance to the Mediterranean sea, is built upon a sharp, rugged, precipitous rock, rising fourteen hundred feet above the level of the sea, and extending to the distance of three miles. Upon its western slope the town is built, containing a population of fifteen hundred souls, in an exceedingly small space of territory. The entire water front of the bay is one continuous line of ramparts, and the brazen ar- ray of British cannon is a continual challenge of the in- vincible hold of its present possessors, who are constantly garrisoned by a strong force of veteran soldiery. Here, sixty years ago, commenced the first act of our drama. Major Norton was a soldier, distinguished alike for high breeding, and intrepid valor. Like most men who become distinguished in the profession of arms, the habit of com- mand had affected a naturally generous nature, and made him jealous of prerogative, and at times, overbearing in its exercise. He had one daughter, an only child; and upon the termination of a furlough occasioned by the loss of his wife in England, the affectionate father, as well as accom- plished officer, determined to take the motherless child to the Mediterranean with him, on his return to his regiment. 10   "O       HOUSEHOLD TALES. Accordingly she set sail, together with a maiden aunt, and in due time was domiciliated within the pillars of Hercu- les, charmed by the changes of a new life. Dora Norton was a high-born English beauty; and her personal charms had not been cultivated at the expense of her mind and her heart. She was accomplished in all the elegant graces of her station, educated in solid learning, and of a ready tact and vivacity that gave eclat to her at- tainments. If she liad inherited her mother's loveliness of countenance, and elegant bearing, she was also an heir to the determined will, and fearless intrepidity of her fa- ther; and if they had never been exhibited in any decided manner, it was only because the even tenor of her life had never called them forth. They were simply latent; as the power of electric fluid sleeps in the bosom of clouds, roseate with auroral beauties, waiting for turbulent winds to drive them toward excited negatives. Then come con- cussion, flame and power! As the necessary result of the introduction of such ma- terial into a military post, there was danger, at once, from the exposure of Cupid's magazine. There were plots and assaults; sieges and stratagems; inversion and direct at- tack: or to leave metaphor, the loveliness and brilliant en- dowments of Dora, though a mere girl of sixteen, capti- vated half the young officers of the station, who spared no occasion to offer incense before her. , The major's house was a frequent resort of His Majesty's commissioned sol- diers, and the junior officers, especially, lost no opportuni- ty of indulging in the fascinations thrown about them, by the beauty and the spirit of his ravishing daughter.   DORA NORTON.         1" Dora was totally unconscious of the magic spell that surrounded her, and talked, and sang, and laughed, and li ^^ danced, with all the bewitching influence that perfect art- lessness and innocence, alone, can produce. One of her admirers became especially devoted to her, -and by every delicate way, that true love is prompt in suggesting, he ex- hibited his attachment, striving to awaken a kindred sen- t  timent in the bosom of his fair charmer, before making a declaration of his .passion. Her father's attention chanced : to be drawn to the suitor, and when he was convinced that ! I  the officer was serious in his purpose, he by no means gave his approval. He knew no reason for any personal oppo- sition to the lover, who was a captain in his regiment, a brave, high-spirited, mettlesome youth, and a man worthy of the prize he sought. But the father looked upon Do- ra as only a child, and possibly having more ambitious de- sires regarding the future destiny of his daughter, deter-   mined to nip the bud of love, before it showed the color of the blossom. This might have been very much better managed by a diplomatist, than a self-willed soldier; for persuasion is a more powerful auxiliary,- in such matters, than open war. The major did not so think, however, especially in a case where one of his own inferior officers, and his own child were concerned. The result was, he took prompt meas- ures, and saying nothing to Dora upon the topic, he vry unwisely, because it was ungentlemanly, forbade any far- ther visits of the young sodi"Or at his house. To Dora, with suitable explanation, this would not have been a matter of serious concern. She would only have   "2      HOUSEHOLD TALES. missed him as an amusing companion, whose place would have been filledby some other admirer, and she would have lived on, in happy noncommitment of her affections, until her father had sanctioned the triumphs of the com- ing man.' - It is ever wise for parents, in whatever station of life, to cultivate confidential relations with children, in affairs of the heart, especially. Young people are always greatly influenced by sympathy, and a thousand times this wields effective power, when authority would have -failed. The case in point illustrates the remark. The course taken by his superior, had a very natural result in the determinations of captain Elliott, who was excessively chagrined, but felt himself deeply injured also. Out of pure respect to his commander, he had never in- dulged in any open demonstrations of his attachment, nor had he ever breathed his passion to the subject of it. In his impulses honorable, he would have delayed that, until he could at least have endeavored to conciliate her father, and receive -his sanction. Such had been his honest pur- pose, only postponed till he could feel some degree of cer- tainty that his feelings would be reciprocated. When, therefore, his young blood boiled with indignant excitement, as he felt himself slighted, and even cruelly insulted, by one whom he was disposed to honor and es- teem, his whole soul rose in opposition, and he was pre- cipitated into a vortex of conflicting emotions. A soldier's honor is dearer than his life, and he -has, ordinarily, a way to vindicate it. But theduel was not open to him in this case, since the nature of the offense, and the rank of the offender equally forbade the challenge; moreover, could   DORA NORTON,          113 he have ventured it, in defiance of its propriety, with an f   equal, such stringent regulations forbade it at this post, that a summons of that nature to the officer concerned, would only have involved real disgrace, and condign punishment. Thus that road to satisfaction was closed. He was even more excited upon the possible termina- tion of the affair in which his heart had a greater interest than his honor. The passion heretofore cherished in se- cret, with the intensity and devotion of a soldier's spirit, was roused to a force that he had not been coicious of. He could not believe the maiden privy to her father's act, and naturally desirous of absolving her from even a sus- picion of censure, he could recall a thousand little acts, that his imagination pictured as preferences and personal fa- vors. These reflections soon elevated her into a heroine, unjustly restrained by an oppressive father, and chivalric devotion kindled his love to a glowing flame. Then it  L ved not alone immured within the brain, But with the motion of all elements, Coursed as swift as thought in every power, And gave to every power a double power. His plans were soon determined upon, and as promptly carried into execution. He was not a man to sit calmly down, and endure ills for which his active brain could de- vise a remedy, and especially when the loveliest woman he had ever seen might crown him with the priceless jew- els of her love. He valued the prize at its just estimate, was willing to play deeply for it, and 'abide the hazard of the die.' A day or two after his disgrace, he silently left the fortress, passed along in front of the northern embra- -10   "4-      HOUSEHOLD TALES. sures, across the neutral land, that narrow isthmus which separates the jurisdiction of England from Spain, and pur- sued his way to Cadiz, having renounced the service of his country forever. He had neither confidant nor adviser, and the occasion of his sudden act was not suspected by his brother officers. He left a letter for the commander of the fortress, simply announcing his resignation, but assigning no reason for. the step, and giving no hint of his future. To a subaltern of his company he had the same morning committed a small package, to be delivered to Dora Norton; but as it was no unusual circumstance, it occasioned no remark, and in the little ferment of excitement, consequent upon his ab- rupt and mysterious departure, it was never referred to. Whatever may have been the thought of the father as to his own agency in the result, in no other mind was the re- nunciation of brilliant prospects, by a true soldier, in any way connected with an affair of the heart, The maiden herself had no suspicion of the fact. . She was ignorant of her father's act, and in the reception of the packet, which proved to contain an elegant miniature of the officer, she only regarded it as a memento' of past friendship, gave it some casual attention, and with no little indifference deposited it in a jewel case, and forgot it.- But the shafts of Cupid no more entered her heart, than if it had been cased in triple steel. Nearly three weeks elapsed, but no tidings came of the deserting officer. - Speculation in regard to his incompre- hensible course, had nearly exhausted itself, the vacancy ocasioned by his exit was filled, and life in the fortress   DORA NORTON.         115 was as gay as when Edward Elliott had been the choicest spirit of the little community. Late one evening, after a brilliant assembly had been gathered in her father's parlors, at which she had been es- pecially surfeited with inane flatteries, the languid beauty retired to her apartment. She was wearied in body, and sick at heart with the senseless compliments that had been lavished upon her, and utterly disgusted with the fulsome E  adulations that had become insipid, by constant repetition. As she removed her diamonds, and laid them in the cask- et, her attention was attracted to a brilliant in the setting of the miniature; her thoughts were necessarily associa- ted with the original, and she could not avoid contrasting him with the crowd of insects who had fluttered around her during the evening. She remembered his noble bear- ing; his refined manners; his pure and animated conver- sation, so free from the empty nothingness that others be- trayed; his delicate attentions to herself; the influence of lofty purpose that she now felt he had imperceptibly exer- cised over her; and from his loss she began to picture his worth, and to sigh for his presence. "Poor Elliott!" said she, soliloquizing, "you were of more worth to me than the whole of them! You were al- ways sincere, and you might, in time, have made me to be as noble as yourself. Why could you not have stayed, to teach me to love you!" For the first time since its reception, she felt interested to look upon the picture, and recall the features that now awakened pleasant memories. She lifted it from the jew- el box, where it rested in its velvet case, just as she had   "6       HOUSEHOLD TALES. received it. Something more than curiosity now prompted her to examine it more minutely, and withdrawing it from the case, what was her surprise to find concealed beneath it, a note directed to herself! With eager haste she broke the seal, and found Elliott's name appended to a fervent epistle, the nature of which banished all consciousness of ennui, and all thought of the fripperies of the night. It was a declaration of love, a deliberate renunciation of place and country for her sake, and a proposal for an elopement, to which she folind she hadrunwittingly, given assent, and he had reason to anticipate claiming her as his lawful wife, within less than twenty-four hours! The writer detailed, in the most frank and manly way, his sentiments, purposes, and enforcements. He assured her he had long loved her with an intensity and devotion never excelled, but had intended to conceal the fact if he did not find himself agreeable to her, and then to sue for her love, only with her father's consent. He told of what he thought to be arbitrary and cruel to them both, her fa- ther's act of banishment from her society; and while he did not inveigh against the author of the act, he character- ized it as an undeserved insult, that no true man could en- dure, and a sufficient justification of his furtive appeal to her, as well as of any course her own heart prompted to. Stealth and stratagem were his only paths to secure her happiness, which he believed identical with his own. He gave explicit information of his family, his fortune, his own previous life and character, and referred to her father for confirmation. He detailed his plans, at length; resign- ing all connection with the profession of war, he intended    DORA NORTON.        117- to make immediate preparation to leave the- continent from some French or Spanish port, sail for America, and in the rising Republic of the United States) embark in the cae reer of mercantile life. The epistle closed thus:- "I have laid before you my life and my intents; both are in your keeping, and at your sole disposal. I offer to you the entire wealth of a true heart, in which glows a devotion to you, that never will be equalled by another. I offer you my fortune and my ambition; the one shall be devoted to your happiness, and the other exerted to honor you, and to win laurels that you may rejoice in. I know you do not dislike me, and I believe you respect and es- teem me. I would not propose what I do, if I could com- pass a better plan; but necessity rules all men, and I must be governed by it. I shall go to Cadiz, to prepare for, and await your decision. At the end of six days from this evening, if you- have not deposited the miniature, as a token of your refusal of my offer, and of displeasure at my temerity, in that sin- gular hollow of the great rock, which you discovered in plucking a honey-flower, when we were last together, then shall I know that you return my passion; that I have not been mistaken in the estimate I have made of your noble qualities; that trusting in my honor you will forsake all to link your destiny with mine, and that I am made the happiest of men. In three weeks from this evening, I shall return, to meet you at that same concealed spot, and clasp you to my heart as mine forever! The hour will be at sunset, when you often promenade, and no suspicion will attach to your movements. I shall await you at the   "8      HOUSEHOLD TALES. rendezvous, with preparations suitable to safety and com- fort, with a priest of your own church to marry us, when we will fly on the wings of love, to a home of blessing, in the new world. But if you spurn me - -an alternative I dare not believe possible - while my heart will bleed, and my life be desolate, you may be sure no act shall bring aught but a proud satisfaction to you, if in the future, my name shall excite the remembrance that your heart and hand were sought by one who perilled his life to obtain them. I trust implicitly in your discretion; I have no fear of betrayal. You will bear, equally with me, the perils that beset me, or you will let my secret perish with you. Adieu!--and may good angels guide you to the waiting arms of him who will shield, honor, and love you, while life endures!" The astonished girl seemed to be in the mazes of an in- comprehensible dream, as she perused the fervid epistle, over and over again, each time entangling herself more and more, in meshes of trouble. At length she realized her true position, and 'starting up wildly, she exclaimed - "Good heavens! I am compromised! I have kept the miniature, - he believes I love him, and to-morrow, at sunset, comes to marry me!" The dilemma of the maiden was painfully exciting, at times almost overpowering her. Now -she traversed the apartment, with fitful step, and now threw herself, bewil- dered, upon a couch, sometimes burning with fever, and sometimes overcome with sensations of suffocation. More than once was she tempted to rush to her father and ex- pose the whole scheme. Then she reflected that this would ,   DORA NORTON.         119 be to betray one who had confided in her, and could only lead to his arrest, to a disgraceful trial and to a deserter's doom. Again his very daring fascinated her, and she be- gan to feel her powers of resistance to his wishes steal as by magic away. A long night of more torturing emotions, damsel never suffered from a declaration of love. As the tumult of' feeling naturally exhausted itself, she more calmly consid- ered her situation, and began to- analyze the elements that made up the aggregate. The great facts stood plainly be- fore her mind. Elliott loved her with unprecedented de- votion, without question. He had sacrificed the ambition of his- former life, and run the risk of an ignominious end, to win her. Candor, and a brave generosity breathed in all he had written, and her heart told her every word was sincere. Then she could not but feel that her father's course was arbitrary and unjust, and she was personally a littlepiqued at it. She questioned his judgment, and be- gan to draw unpleasant pictures of the destiny he might propose for her.- She remembered hei mother's lonely lot, and anxious hours, separated from a husband exposed to the vicissitudes of war, and she found herself singularly predisposed toward one, who followed in the more quiet honors of civil life. The comparison she had made be- tween Elliott and others, at the very moment of discover- ing the letter, flitted across her mind, and it suggested a superstitious recognition of a providential coincidence; and the more she dwelt upon her lover's person and character, the more she discovered that her heart was interested, till at length sympathetic sighs, and tears that answered back   120      HOUSEHOLD TALES. his impassioned fervency, succeeded to tumult and con- sternation, as she retraced the lines of love. Hour after hour she revolved ;these things in her mind, now in doubt, and now on the point of decision. The spirit of her suitor charmed her love of daring, and there was a romantic piquancy in the adventure, that won her sympa- thies the longer she reflected upon it, till it excited a sort of insane impulse to become a party to it. In this trans- ition of feeling, the very nature she had inherited from her father was developed, and leaping into the pendant balance decided* the question of destiny in favor of her lover.-- The star of love rose in the ascendant, and her resolve was made to trust all to him who had so bravely sought her; to abide -the consequences of her implied pledge, to fly with her expectant husband, wherever fortune might lead. Once resolved, her mind took its usual tone, and a spirit of exhiliration glowed in her soul. With the morning light she was coolly composed in her purpose, and mingled joyously in the household routine. The day was mainly passed in quiet, making little prepa- rations of remembrancers, to be found after her departure, not forgetting an appropriate letter to her father, promis- ing to return, some happy day, for his forgiveness and his blessing. These details over, she waited, impatiently, for the tardy day to finish its course. The sun sunk into the roaring Atlantic, at last, and emblazoned the gateways of evening with gorgeous magnificence, that held the soft flushes of twilight suspended over air, earth and water, in enchanting beauty. At this hour it was, that Dora Nor- ton, for the last time, left her father's dwelling, with only   DQRA NORTON.        121 the jewels of her mother, the miniature that had so influ- enced her life, and her beauty for a dower! She passed deliberately away from the town, directed her course to the open field, and soon approached the se- questered spot that had been designated. As she timidly advanced into the shadow of the rocks, her attentive ear caught the sound of approaching footsteps, the manly form of Elliott appeared from behind a cag, and the next in- stant he folded her to his heart with rapturous joy. No word was uttered, but in the silence of overwhelming feel- ing two beings were baptized in one, with tears of swell- ing emotion. With little delay, he led her to an adjacent grotto, where the priest awaited them, with some cavaliers who respectfully saluted her, and in that hidden temple of Nature, with the broad arch of heaven, studded with new- born stars, for a dome, the responsive service of matrimo- ny was solemnized, and they were indissolubly joined in the holy bonds of wedlock. Almost instantly the little group vaulted into their saddles, and in the dying rays of twilight, a small cavalcade defiled from concealment, and the swift horses coursed across the plain, away into the shades of night, toward the Spanish main. Their flight was successfully accomplished, and the sec- ond day thereafter, they reached Cadiz in safety. Prep- arations had already been completed for embarkation on board an American vessel, ready to sail, and the third day from her marriage, the adventurous woman was once more borne over the bosom of the broad Atlantic. Like Eve, as she wandered out into the world that was all before her, Dora looked back upon the happy seat she had left,   '122'      HOUSEHOLD TALES. and dropped 'some natural tears,' but 'wiped them soon,' content with the choice she had made, and every day more happy in the devotion her husband lavished upon her.-- The voyage was ended with no untoward incident, and a few weeks saw them safely landed at the port of New York, where they soon gained troops of friends. However luckless clandestine matches may usually re- sult, this proved to be of Heaven's own direction, and the smiles of Providence ever dwelt about the happy house- hold. Both in the beginning and the end, the adventure realized the great dramatist's discourse of love,-- The more thou dam'st it up the more it burns; The current, that with gentle murmur glides, Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage: But when his fair course is not hindered He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones, Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge He overtaketh in his pilgrimage; And so, by many winding nooks he strays, With willing sport, to the wild ocean. Captain Elliott was a man of great refinement, with a commanding intellect and an ample fortune. He took po- sition in the best society of the day, and was not long in winning his way to the esteem and the confidence of the people among whom he had cast his lot. He became an ardent supporter of republican principles, entered heartily into public enterprises, and was frequently elected to offi- ces of trust and honor, both State and national., These services were so well. appreciated by his fellow-citizens, and produced results so satisfactory to himself, that he be- came a patriotic lover of the country of his adoption, serv- ing it as'devotedly as if born upon its soil.   DORA NORTON.         1231 It need not be said that his amiable wife was a compan. ion meet for such a man, nor that she lent a peculiar beau- ty and attraction to his life. She made the complement to lis own noble nature; and while he ruled in his sphere with superior luster, sun-like, blazing in the ascendant, she, like the chaste moon, gloried in his light, and returned him honor by reflecting it in her own mrild way. There was one only drawhack to theirperfect happiness, and this was the fact that they were childless; yet how- ever much such a misfortune, in others, may repress the purer gushings of nature, and impede the perfect develop- menlt of the heart and life of humanity, it did not seem to have such an effect with them. Each knew that the other felt much disappointment, and by all gentle ministrations, strove to overbalance this grief with tender assiduities.- Thus it happened, that their affection to each other, in consequence of this very disappointment, glowed with a superior warmth; as the gathered rays of light burn with greater intensity, when condensed to a focal point. During the Presidency of Mr. Jefferson, the services of captain Elliott were called for in a new capacity. His peculiar adaptation to the duties of a foreign consulate, at- tracted reard, and the President, knowing nothingof his earlier escapade, tendered him the post at Gibraltar. It awakened   singular reveries, especially in the mind of the only child of major Norton. Years had elapsed since she left her father's roof. Once had she written to him,  with a  full, free, outspoken effort toward reconciliation, as such t  a woman's heart could but prompt, after deliberate reflec- tion. It had never been responded to, and it would be a   12-4     ,HOUSEHOLD TALES. perversion of nature to say that the subject had not cost her many sad hours. He was her father, had been very indulgent to her, and in her soul she loved and honored him. Now that she had a better appreciation of the di- vine precept of the Golden Rule, she felt impelled to do all that could be done to atone for her disobedience, know- ing that it must be judged of very differently, from the standpoints they occupied. Then in addition to other con- siderations, her father was growing old, and she felt ear- nestly impelled, if possible, to throw around him the se- ductive charms of a daughter's sincere affection, to make his declining days agreeable aiid happy. Influenced by such motives, she had no difficulty in per- suading her husband to accept the proffered mission. She again wrote to her father, enlarged upon the career of her husband, and spoke of her own happiness, interrupted by one only thought, and that of her father's displeasure.- Every tenderness toward him was exhausted in her letter, and in closing she announced the appointment of Elliott to the consulate of Gibraltar, adding that she would accom- pany him, to redeem her pledge of returningi some happy day, for forgiveness and a blessing. Preparations were soon made for departure, and a few weeks saw them on the deck of a national frigate, under the protection of the stars and stripes, watching the mazy outlines of the fortress, as it loomed up on the horizon, in the morning sun. The vision awakened peculiar mem- ories of the scenes of their early and romantic love. "As fugitives, and at night, they had fled from one national power; they returned to the identical locality, under the of-   DORA NORTON.       t  125 ficial warrant,and protected by the powerful armament of another. Life's changes are wondrous miracles! The voyagers at length entered the straits, and sailed majestically into the Mediterranean, with the republican colors floating from the mast head. As the ship neared the fortress, a national salute echoed from her heavy guns, the colors were lowered in token of respect, and instantly after, along the lines of the British citadel, the deep boom of cannon answered back, while the frigate came to anch- or, in the harbor. The wharves were lined with spectators, from one of which a boat put off into the stream, and approached the vessel. Prominent above the rowers could be seen stand- ing at the bows, a grey-haired man of commanding figure, wearing the full uniform of an English officer. It was the commander of the fortress, who came to perform a respect- ful ceremony to the American government, and the salu- tations of the officers were speedily over. But this was not the only purpose of the veteran soldier, in so early a notice of the ship's company. On the deck of the vessel .there were two persons who watched with more than ceremonial interest, and Dora Norton's heart beat tumultuously, when she saw her father step from the boat, mount the frigate's side, and stand a few feet from herself. As soon as he had saluted the ship's officers, his quick eye glanced hastily through the group about him, and instantly selecting the consul and his companion, he approached them, with visible emotion. Dora trembled with excitement, and to the utter astonishment of the ob- servers, who knew nothing of her history, bursting into "   126       HOUSEHOLD TALES. tears,-she rushed to the soldier's arms, and fell, sobbing, upon his breast. . The relenting father was quite as deeply moved, and in a voice broken with overpowering feeling, he could only ejaculate,- ' "My child! My only child! The interview was sufficiently touching, and the recon- ciliation was complete. The consul was not excepted from the old commander's generous reception; and though he often said he ought to shoot him for a deserter, he con- fessed as often, that he did not blame him, that in his own young blood he would have done the same, and on serious thought, he liked him all the better for his spirit. Thle old relations, of confidence and respect, were again es- tablished, and major Norton, now become a colonel, was as fond of his son-in-law as if he had been a peer of the realm. But blissful as were the days that now filled her cup of blessing, Dora's measure of happiness was not yet com- plete. It has already been said that the dearest pledges of conjugal love were denied them, and the most enchant- ing music in the world - a mother's lullaby - was never heard in their dwelling. But as if the Deity vouchsafed His quickening spirit in reward for filial love and duty,-- seeriingly the attendant upon the marriage blessing of the proud old father, a daughter was given them at Gibraltar, coming into that home, like the clove of the patriarch, bringing an earnest of future good. The successful'career of the happy husband was a com- plete redemption of the earliest pledge he made to his no- ble wife. He adorned every station he occupied, and as   DORA NORTON.         127 often as he fulfilled the trusts of one delicate mission, -an- other was urged upon him. Subsequent to his residence at Gibraltar, he held similar positions at Smyrna, and still later at Tunis. In all new duties his fond wife accompan- ied him, and shared all the vicissitudes of his eventful ca- reer. She encountered perils by sea, and perils by land; made a transit and a sojourn in each of the four grand di- visions of the globe, and it might almost be added, with a temporary excursion into the eternal world! At Tunis was born their third child, and the infant had reached its second summer, when that terrible plague, the African fever, broke out in the city, and the inhabitants fled before it, as from the face of the destroying angel. All ranks and classes fell victims to it, and Europeans de- serted the doomed town precipitately, taking passage in wlhatever vessel offered, crossing the Mediterranean into Greece, Italy, Spain, or any other destination possible.- Meantime the scourge raged with increasing virulence, and among those who could not flee, poverty and vice ad- ded tenfold horrors to the reign of death. Children fell in the streets, howling in death struggles, with none to as- suage their torments; husbands left wives prostrate in dy- ing agony, and wives forsook husbands writhing in torture, fearing contagion and certain death. The natural suffer- ings of the diseased were rendered more terribly fearful by neglect and destitution, and insane shrieks and desperate wailings filled the pestilent air. The American consul was the sole representative of a foreign power that remained at his post, and his faithful companion kept him company. N6 persuasion, no attempt   128       IlOUSEHOLD TALES. to rouse her fears, could in the least avail to induce her to leave her husband and in the midst of the peril she stood beside him like an angel watcher. Nor did she live im- mured within her own household, folding her sympathies into her heart, to grow cold and die in utter selfishness. Day by day, and hour by hour found her abroad, in the very midst of the plague, ministering to the destitute, al- leviating suffering, and closing the eyes of the dying. A blessing was shed wherever She entered; motherless child-, ren found in her a protector, and minds despairing in the gloom of foreshadowed death/were inspired with the con- solations and the hopes of immortality. Again her father's nature glowed in her life, prompting her to daring deeds, and winning triumphs by the force of her will. Neither the groans of dying victims, the hot haste of terrified fugitives, the ghastly forms of death, nor the almost constant passage of hearse and coffin, had any terrors for her. Suffering humanity demanded her ser- vice, and her generous heart responded with entire devo- tion. Her daily duties displayed a moral heroism and in- trepidity, as infinitely above all martial courage and glory, as thought is above the senseless stone. Such, however neglected and unknown, are the truly great, the grandly noble. They, and they alone, who live and act in gener- ous sacrifice for their fellows, have anything angelic about them, anything godlike. The destruction still raged, and still the Christian wo- man spent days and nights in deeds of charity and missions of love. At length exhausted by fatigue, it came her turn to grow weary, and fall before the blast of death. The   DORA NORTON.         129 racking pains of the disease began their fearful creepings over limb, and nerve, and muscle; the burning death-tide swept along her veins; pallor and alternate fire chased all beauty from her countenance; delirium kindled in her brain, flashed from her eyes, and mattered from her lips. She on whom all had leaned, as upon a sure stay; she in whom all had trusted, as an abiding succor; the beautiful, the good, the generous-minded one, was fallen! Her hus- band's agony was insupportable, and the wails of her be- reaved children were pitiable to hear. The strong man bowed like a reed, and on bended knees beside the sense- less sufferer, he moaned in his woe, kissed the parched lips, and vainly strove to win back the departing spirit. But no critical skill, no tender nursing no lamentations of de- serted childhood, no bitter desolation of loving compan- ions, can arrest the swift footsteps that enter the gate of the shadowy land. Dora Norton heeded them not.. Rapidly the plague worked its fearful ruin upon the temple so fair and come- ly, steadily pursuing its destructive conquest, even to the seat of life. All organs of sense and motion were still; the muscles became rigid; the eyes lost their luster; the flesh showed no elasticity; the pulse arid the heart were still; and the pallid features grew cold and deathke. In fearful length the peerless beauty, the fascinating woman, the idolized wife and mother, lay motionless as the clods of the valley, where they soon would bear her, and it was whispered with white lips, and repeated in hushed breath- ing, to many a desolate heart, - "The noble wife of the consul is dead!"   130      HOUSEHOLD TALES. It is not fitting to dwell upon the minute circumstances of this appalling hour. Death is always terrible; but when he comes to such a home, and forces such a victim to his icy embrace, we realize something of the strength of the curse and the woe of Divine appointment, and can " estimate, somewhat at its value, the horrible nature of sin that hath entailed it. The ghostly form was clothed in the garments of the tomb, and laid in its coffin, amid the voice of lamentation, from those who refused to be comforted. The last rites of sepulture were at hand, and the relatives followed the lifeless body, wrapped in shroud and pall, to the hastened burial, and awaited the ceremony that con- signs inanimate matter to corruption and dissolution. The father of the three motherless children standing there, was scarcely conscious of his own existence, so like a thunder. bolt had this calamity fallen upon him, and he stood above his,dead like one bereaved of motion. 'I am the Resurrection and the Life!'" were the first uttered words that broke upon the profound grief, and in a solemnity as real as it was suitable, the Bu'rial Service proceeded. Elliott stood entranced, hearing and heeding nothing of the sad ceremonies, until the resonant voice of the clergyman startled him from his revery, by its appall- ing intonation, and the rattling of uplifted earth sounded to the desolate ihan, like the knell of a sundering world. "We therefore commit her body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust"- "Never! never!" groaned the anguished man, inter- rupting the astonished clergyman, and flinging himself up- on his knees beside the grave. An awful pause rested for   DORA NORTON.        131 a moment upon the little group, and the agony of his soul broke forth again. "I have loved thee, Dora, as no other ever loved, thou art the mother of my children, - I can not, I will not see thee buried from my sight!" Friends approached him soothingly, his terrified child- ren clung to his garment, with vociferous weeping, and the entire concourse sobbed aloud. With excited gesture and eyes flashing with insane fire, he heeded them not, but turned to the astonished bearers, and frantically exclaimed, "Bear back the body! -bear back the body,-or bury me in the same tomb! She is not dead!-she -must not die! Bear back the body!" Shocking as his words seemed they were not disobeyed; the coffin was lifted from its grave, and returned to the home its motionless tenant had so blessed by her life. It was deemed best to humor the insane freak of the broken- hearted man, lest his reason should be entirely overthrown. The night found him alone with the remains of his idol- ized wife, watching beside the couch on which her form was again extended, in the white robes that seemed to him most beautiful and appropriate, waiting, as he whispered to his bewildered children, for the 'Resurrection and the Life ' I shall give the remainder of the narrative as I find it in my friend's manuscript, its simple statements furnishing a better accompaniment to the-denouement than any attempt to give them dramatic effect would produce.

The last I can recall to my consciousness, previous to my resuscita- tion, was the placing weights upon my eyes, to keep them closed, as is usual with corpses. Up to that point I was aware of what took place about me; but from that mo- ment the asphyxia was as completely mental as physical, body and soul being equally bound by it, in utter insensi- bility to passing events. "Twenty-four hours had succeeded to the time of my being withdrawn from the grave, before any suspicion oc- curred that I was not dead. My husband had been led to his acts solely by the overpowering emotions of his grief, which so wrought upon him as to unsettle his reason, and only not make him a raving maniac. Still, he once told me that in all the tumult of his brain, he constantly saw me restored to health, not with any association of a spirit- life, but in terrestrial experience. He could assign no reas- on for the feeling, but with this vision, there was an unut- terable dread of seeing my body interred, although he be- lieved. it only a lifeless corpse. "At the time referred to, the day after the interruption, some friends were with him, endeavoring to persuade him to a new burial, fearing the worst consequences from con- tagion, and the impurity necessary to result. He was utter- ly immovable in his purpose, and it then became necessa- ry to assume to do it by force.

This ex- cited surprise, led to investigation, anda it was found that no signs of the only sure test of death-- putrefaction - had appeared in any part of my person. "Then came a conviction of latent vitality, and the pos- sibility of restoration. All feasible measures were taken for this, and I need not say they were at length successful. For a long time, however, Nature did not completely re- sume her functions; my hair fell off, my nails loosened and dropped away, and all my faculties came again like the unlocking of the forces of Nature, when Spring melts away the icy fetters of Winter. I recovered a reasona- ble degree of health, but no color ever painted my coun- tenance again. I did not know that I was actually borne to the grave till years had elapsed; but the anniversary of that event, as well as any reference to similar phenomena, always fills me with a shuddering terror:-not, I think, firom  fear of death, but at my narrow escape from being buried alive!

YEARS ago, on a gloomy autumn afternoon, just at sun- set, the residents in a quiet village in Maine noted a vehi- cle, of an unusual description for that locality, on its way through the principal street. It was evidently the con- veyance of some traveler; there was a trunk lashed to the rear of the carriage, and the jaded horse showed signs of a tedious journey. There had of late been heavy rains, frequent pools of muddy water were still standing, and the entire equipage, thickly bespattered, gave unmistak- able proof of the deplorable condition of the highways. As the tired animal jogged on through the hamlet, faces peered into the coming twilight, from every window, while the juvenile denizens more boldly grouped on threshold and doorstep; attracted by the passing novelty. Yet they saw nothing, beyond the wayworn horse, the mud-covered   136      HOUSEHOLD TALES. chaise, and an occasional glimpse of the rider, muffled in a dark cloak, with his head composed in a sleeping pos- ture. The reins hung negligently from his hands, and the whip had long been released from duty. A hundred eyes followed the direction of the carriage, expecting to see it stop at the extremity of the street, as the village tavern there hung out its unpretending sign, announcing ' Entertainment for man and beast.' But nei- ther the man nor the horse in question, appeared to take the least notice of the hospitable announcement, and the retreat of which they both stood greatly in need, was neg- lectfully passed by. The old watchdog, roused a moment from his slumbers upon the doorstep, pricked his ears, ut- tered a short growl, and then dropped his head between his paws again, as lazy as before. This unceremonious entrance and exit of the traveler certainly was not intended, for it had been his purpose to put up at that same tavern, over night. The truth was, that wearied with his tedious ride, he had fallen asleep, and saw neither village nor villager, public house nor pri- vate, as he left them behind him, and slowly became deeper and deeper involved in a country so sparsely settled, as to be little else than a wilderness. The incident of itself is not of a character sufficiently marked to require a record; but upon that wayside nap originates and depends the en- tire action of our simple story. Had the stranger tarried where he purposed, it would never have been written. Night soon set in, dropping its dense curtain over moun- tain, forest and field. The darkness was greatly hastened by the clouds that had all day hung low, and the traveler   THE FOREST BRIDE.        137 was speedily benighted in, his slumbers. Still the jaded nag moved on, climbing hills and threading valleys, keep- ing the safe path by instinct. At length he entered a for- est of swamp land, where the road way was only of suf- ficient width for one vehicle to pass with safety. Sudden- ly the horse encountered an obstacle in his path, and came to a dead stand. "Hilloa!-whoa! Hush-back, ye lubbers!" roared a stentorian voice, from the road in advance. "Who's there?" the same rough tones demanded. The traveler was not only fully aroused by the noise of the unseen speaker, but was startled to find himself in ut- ter darkness, his horse standing still, and an unknown voice stunning him with its thunder. A moment brought him to realize his probable position, and he therefore gave the only appropriate response, as he shouted, in his turn,- "A  friend!" "Wall, friend or foe, there's one too many on us in this here bog-hole, any time o'night, lettin' alone how ppxed dark it be!" responded the opposite voice, a little milder. "Let me turn out of the road, while you pass on;" re- plied the man in the chaise. "No, no, mister! I calk'late you'd best keep quiet, or mabby you'll turn out so you wo'n't turn in again very in- terestin'. The swamp's mighty ditchy jest along here, and that 'ere thingumbob you 're ridin' in would upset ye kersplash!  I knows the place best, and I'll manage to gee off, and back out, so you can scrape by, I guess." With this, the invisible speaker began to start up his team, shouting with true yeoman's dialect,- 12*   HOUSEHOLD TALES. "Hush-- back, brin'ln! Gee o', buck! Back,' back, ye lubbers! Whoa, hush, back now!" until his cart was out of the road, and seeing, or rather feeling the way to be clear, he called out, "Drive on, cap'n!" Previous to moving, however, the person addressed be- thought himself to inquire as to his whereabouts. With this in view he asked, - "How far is it to the nearest tavern, my good friend?" "'The nigh'st tavern?'" repeated the other, "what in natur's the man talking about! Why the nigh'st tavern is four miles back, and ye must hev rid by Walton's, cap'n? Strange ye did n't stop there. Though mabby, mister, its t' other track you're goin' on. 'T a'n't but three miles, or sith a matter, to Four Corners, but Newton's must be- le's me see-nigh seven miles on." I'm traveling on the main road, sir," said the other, without having received very definite ideas by the inform- ation given; "do you say it is seven miles to a stopping place, in that direction?" "Pesky nigh it, any way. But you would n't like to ride that way to-night, I guess; folks round here do n't go through Black Swamp woods arter dark, much, I tell ye! There's a man murdered there once, an' they seem skeery like, to most folks sence." "Is there no house between here and Newton's?" in- quired the traveler in an anxious tone, inspired, however, by his hunger and weariness, and increased by the black night about him; but not from dread of anything ' skeery,' in Black Swamp woods or elsewhere. "Housen a'n't very plenty this way, cap'n; there a'n't   THE FOREST BRIDE.   139   but one betwixt this an' Newton's, an' that 'ere's ole cap'n Warren's half a mile or so, on. He mought take ye in, mabby, seein' ye're a stranger, an' the night's so pesky kind o' black, like. The cap'n's a jinerous ole man, an' knows how to do a good turn to a feller crittur in need. He's an ole settler, and sarved in the Revolution, way down to Valley Forge, an' them places, without stockin's an' shoes an' sich"- "Thank you, my good friend, I think I'll drive on and talk with the captain; good night, and a prosperous drive home, to you!" said the traveler, unterrupting the other in the midst of his generously intended loquacity. The hon- est farmer, for such the unseen speaker really was, would not have esteemed it a hardship, to have stood an hour in the dark, while he gave a sketch of the veteran'^ life and services. But a conference with that personage seemed to the traveler by far preferable to a biographical narra- tive concerning him, so whipping up his horse, he soon left the echoes of the kindly rustic's voice in the dense woods behind him. A half hour's circumspect driving brought him without the forest, and he could tell from the noisy rumbling of the wheels, that the road had led to more elevated ground.- It was not long before he was cheered with the sight of a large farm-house, revealed by the lighted candles within, whose blaze, flashing out upon the surrounding elms, was reflected on the ample front of the building. The place seemed venerable for its age, and inviting for the shelter it promised from the damp, dark night. Driving into the yard, Atherton - so was the traveler named- alighted   I  "O      HOUSEHOLD TALES. from his chaise, and went up to the door. In answer to his summons at the knocker, an old man appeared on the instant, with candle in hand, and courteously invited him to enter the dwelling. "I presume I have the pleasure of addressing captain Warren?" said Atherton, inquiringly. "That is what people call me," answered the old gen- tleman; " will you walk in, and tell me your business? I do not remember your face, although you have addressed me by my name." "I will tell my business here, if you please, and enter afterward, if it be agreeable to you," returned Atherton. "The simple truth is, sir, that I am a total stranger to you, and in these parts; I am a benighted traveler, pretty well wearied, while my horse is much more so. I intended to stop at a town some miles back, but I must have passed it in a nap, for I did not see it. I encountered an ox team, in the woods, just below here, whose driver told me all I know of you, informing me that I had seven miles, and a dangerous road to travel, before reaching another house. He led me to hope that under your hospitable roof, I may find shelter till morning, and that'- is the occasion of my disturbing you." The citizen carefully scrutinized the young man's ap- -pearance, and as he deliberately became satisfied with his physiognomy and bearing, he replied heartily, - "Come in, come in, young man! Our accommodations are none of the best, I promise you; but we can afford a supper and a bed to you, and shelter and provender for the horse. A poor man's cheer is all I can offer, and that you   THE FOREST BRIDE -141 are more than welcome to. It is better than a long ride, inl a wild country, with a jaded horse, and in a dark night like this! Whom may I call you, sir?" Atherton gave him the information desired, and followed him into the common sitting room, assuring him he could be satisfied with very homely fare, and only felt profoundly grateful for a shelter and a supper for his horse; as -he had already been many hours on the road, with a long jour- ney yet before him, in the next few days. "Well, young man!" said his host, "I like to see you careful of your horse, for the wise king tells us ' The mer- ciful man is merciful to his beast.' It's a good sign, but I reckon we'll provide for you both. Sarah, the gentleman needs a good supper; see what you can give him. Lay off your cloak, sir; we'll take good care of the animal, and bring in your trunk. My daughter and grandchildren, Mr. Atherton." The kind-hearted farmer had already placed a chair for his reception, before the fire, where had been seated a group that would have given pleasure to a less sensible per- son than he who was now introduced to them. Half a dozen children had been clustered around their mother, as she sat busily sewing, while the eldest, a daughter of sev- enteen, was reading to them. It was a beautiful hearth- stone picture, and although they had their own skeleton- guest, in the form of some great sorrow, which every fam- ily must entertain,- yet at that moment, it seemed to the new-comer, so sudden had been the transition of his sur- roundings, as if he had been ushered into a celestial scene. A   laughing little beauty, of four or five years, ventured   -142      HOUSEHOLD TALES. near as he seated himself, and taking her -upon his knee, he was soon engaged in the interesting prattle of the en- tire flock of little folks, while the mother and daughter were preparing the table. Thus employed, he had ample opportunity to observe the persons of this little paradise, as well as the home they inhabited. The room in which he was seated was a plain, old-fash- ioned, New England 'front-room,' as it was proverbially called. On one side opened two windows from whence he had seen the candles gleam on his approach, and opposite to them was a wide fireplace, where cracked and blazed a good pile of hickory, that the cold autumn night made specially appropriate and comfortable. The floor was as white as many a thorough scrubbing could make it, con- trasting well with the unpainted wood-work of the walls, where the native chestnut had grown richly dark, by the joint influence of the light and air of years. On the right of the fire, opened a door to the kitchen; and on the remaining side of the apartment, stood that tal- isman of family memories, the sober-faced clock, with its mechanism of moon craft, and calendar, the never ex- plained wonders of Yankee childhood. The family Bible kept its place on the stand beside it, in silent grandeur re- minding of Eternal Realities; but the more noisy chroni- cler of Time, beat off, the march of moments, with unva- rying regularity, as if in perpetual warning that ages are passing away with unwearied footsteps The remaining furniture was simple and ancient, made for utility rather than ornament; but there was an air of neatness and taste that spoke of elegant refinement, and   THE FOREST BRIDE.         143 that silent charm which true cultivation ever leaves where its facile hand is laid. Atherton never felt more at home, than when concluding these hasty observations. The old gentleman returned from the stable, after the lapse of half an hour, the table was loaded with tempting food, and the appetite of the guest did it ample justice, as the maiden poured his tea, and presided at the rich re- past, with graceful, and unembarrassed propriety. The tide of conversation was soon in full flow, and all barriers of reserve were swept away. The strangers of an hour before were on familiar foot- ing, with a mutual appreciation of hidden worth, often foreshadowed by those numberless little nameless graces of carriage, countenance and speech, that are always play- ingabout people of refined natures, and generous hearts. They are beyond the reach of factitious manners, nor can they be successfully counterfeited by the studied com- plaisance of hypocrisy. One is the pure, cool, healthful gushing of sparkling waters, from an irrepressible spring; and the other the tepid, nauseous, finical display of fancy fountains, forced into artificial jets by mechanical power. One pleases forever; the other wearies, even before it is fully comprehended. One speaks of Nature, always pure, always perfect; the other of Art, often erring, and never permanent. The patriarch of the household was a man of seventy, yet robust and active. His bronzed features were well formed, his forehead large, and his eyes dark and thought- ful. His carriage was still upright, and he presented the figure of a hale old man, whose hoary head was a true   "4       HOUSEHOLD TALES. crown of glory. The matron, his daughter, was a woman of about forty-five, in full health, and of attractive ap- pearance, dignified and intelligent. She had been a wid- ow for four years, but having always resided under her father's roof, she enjoyed all the privileges of a substan- tial home, for herself and children. The old gentleman had no other descendants, and on these, therefore, he lav- ished all his love and his care, treating his grandchildren with even more tenderness and indulgence than a father could wisely have done. The eldest of these, the maiden of the tea-table, was a person of rare beauty, and of spotless virtue, whether es- timated by her daily life of filial and domestic duties, or from the calm purity of her thoughts and aspirations. A spiritual aroma seemed to exhale from her presence, and she was at once the companion and the idol of the little household. Atherton had observed a grace and attrac- tiveness about her, upon entering the room; but he was not specially interested in her appearance, until she was seated directly opposite to him, where he could not avoid a thorough study of her expressive features. Caroline Weston, though born and reared in the wilds of a new country, and, of humble parentage, was an ex- tremely beautiful person. Her features were finely mod- eled, her countenance glowing with the blush of perfect health, and her skin fair and blooming. Her eyes were of deep blue, with a changeable play of expression as the shades of thought were modified; not unlike the vari- ations sometimes observed in the calm waters of a lake, when the rays of the sun play over it with differing inten-   THE FOREST BRIDE.        145 sity. Now they rested in quiet reflection, and depth and purity were alone suggested; and now they flashed and played with quivering light, as some brilliant remark, or lively sally scattered sunrays in sparkling beauty. Her dark brown hair was in sufficient profusion for any style of decoration, but she wore it simply drawn back from the forehead, without parting, and gathered in rich braids, ter-, miniating in ringlets. If to this description be added a form of medium height, distorted and misshapen by no in- ventions of murderous fashion, the tout ensemble sug- gests a creation not unworthy to have been a model for the Venus de Medici. Such was the vision that Atherton's eyes rested upon, as often as he dared to lift them! .-Yet, when once he en- tered into the full appreciation of her loveliness, he could not withdraw his gaze. He thought her the most beauti- ful being he had ever seen, and almost feared to know her any farther, lest want of culture, a vapid mind, or a friv- olous nature, should destroy his illusion. Poor fellow!-- His experience had been in the aristocratic walks of city civilization, and he was not sure that all women are not as superficial, heartless, and designing, as the false training in such circles legitimately produces. Atherton was five-and-twenty, and as fine a specimen of manly development and comeliness as one need to see. The residents at Black Swamp farm, certainly, had never entertained a guest his equal, in these respects; and when it is said that he had the culture of a scholar, and the air of a gentleman, it will not be difficult to imagine that the damsel had reflections of her own, as well as he. What- 13   "6       HOUSEHOLD TALES. ever may have been the fact, each came to experience- an embarrassment at the other's regards, and at length, when their glances met, they did the very silly thing to betray conscious interest by confused blushes. What a tell-tale traitor new-born Love is! After the supper was ended, the traveler resumed his place by the fireside. His host had drawn up the broad old arm chair, his evening comforter, and was frolicking with two or three little curly heads upon his knees. The table was soon removed, and the group was again entire. As a lull came for a moment, in the general conversation, Atherton extended his arms to the sweet child he had fondled, as she left her grandfather's knee, and roguishy approached the stranger. He took her up, gave her a hearty kiss, and said,- "Can 't you tell me your name, my little miss?" ( Emily Pray Weston," said the child, as she looked up in his face, with happy confidence. "Indeed!" said the questioner, with a shade of sadness, ' that is a very beautiful name, and I like it, very much. I once had a sister whose name was Emily. Whose little lady are you?" "Sister Caddy's little lady," was the prompt reply. "Well, don't you think you would take a fine long ride, if mother'll let you, and go and be my little lady?" The doubting child looked from one to another of the group, apparently hesitating what to say. Her mother noticed her and said, playfully,-           \ ' You may go, Emily!" The embarrassment/ of the pretty innocent increased,   THE FOREST BRIDE.        147 till looking to the workstand where her sister was em- ployed upon a piece of embroidery, she hit upon a happy compromise. Gazing up into his face, with a bewitching smile of confidence, she said, naively, - "I'll go if Caddy will!" "But I have room in my chaise for only one," said the young man, amused. , "Then Caddy may go alone!" replied the child. This response brought a pleasant laugh from the fami- ly, with the exception of the maiden herself, who blushed with visible confusion, as she ejaculated,-- "Why, - Emily!" Atherton observed the emotion, and delicately turned his language, if not his thoughts, into a different channel. The conversation soon lapsed into a discussion of the pol- itics of the day, a topic of fruitful interest to all classes of freemen. They canvassed the merits of men and meas- ures, speculated upon the progress of improvement, and the promise of the rapid growth of the nation, with many exhilirating views of its future career. This naturally led the elder to speak of the past, and present many pic- tures in striking contrast with the stable, happy govern- ment, that then shed its peaceful blessings upon a united people. Atherton observed to him,-- "You must have been an actor in very many interest- ing and important events, captain Warren?" 6 True, Mr. Atherton, very true. My parents emnigra- ted to this country when I was of tender years, and I have grown old upon the soil. I have been familiar with these forests when the wild deer, and the savage roved unscared   "8      HOUSEHOLD TALES. in the solitudes; I have been familiar with the bloody horrors of St. Clair's war, and it was my fortune still later, to bear arms in the contest with the mother country, that resulted in our glorious confederation." "I envy the privilege of these little folks" continued the younger, "in having the opportunity to listen to the recitals of incidents, that must be both thrilling and in- structive. I shall never forg6t with what rapt attention I used to sit at my grandmother's knees, to hear some nar- rative of the Revolution, till my young heart would beat quicksteps of liberty. I think patriotism can never be so thoroughly kindled, nor so well taught, as when trusting childhood learns it from those relatives who have toiled and suffered to purchase its blessings for them. I have often thought of this, and felt a regret for the times when there shall be no more veterans to inspire courage and am- bition, by tales of personal peril and daring triumph." His companion smiled, and gave a nod of assent to his suggestions, as he replied,- "I sometimes amuse the little folks, by narrating the exploits of earlier days, for it is pleasant, at least, to live over again the scenes of the past, and call up the associ- ates who have passed down the dark valley before me. I find, as I grow older, increased gratification in the resour- ces of a good memory. It is as if I stepped in among old friends, cherished and faithful, and enjoyed all the delight of living intercourse. They seem to be with me, at such times, and I forget I have lost them." This train of remark roused the attention of the child- ren, and entering fully into the spirit of it they cried,--   THE FOREST BRIDE.        149 "Tell us a story, grandfather, please tell us a story!" Atherton joined heartily in the request, and the little Emily, who had shifted her quarters, threw her fond arms about his neck, as she pleaded,- "Dear grandpa, do tell us a story!" Thus importuned, he could not well refuse; and after a fresh supply of fuel was added to the fire, they listened eagerly to the narrative. Simple and unpretending in its style, no one regretted having heard it, and it will still re- pay one to stop and read- THE OLD MAN'S STORY. In addition to the many deprivations of their lot, the early settlers of our country were exposed to the furtive, and treacherous attacks of Indians, who had held undispu- ted sway over the wilds of America, from time immemo- rial, and considered themselves the rightful lords of the soil. They looked with a jealous eye upon the pale face, wherever he reared his cabin, and began to cultivate the ground, as the incipient step to civilization. Their sages prophesied evil from the increasing numbers that penetra- ted the forests, and it was not infrequently the case, that when every precaution had been taken to establish harmo-- nious relations with them, some sudden hatred would be excited, and the first warning to the ill-fated hamlet came from savage irruption, when the merciless torch lighted death-fires in every dwelling, and brutal tomahawks leap- ing from ambush, butcheredmen, women and children, in indiscriminate slaughter. Few escaped by flight, and the   150 '      HOUSEHOLD TALES. terrible death of torture, was often preferable to the hor- rors of a captivity with the inhuman foe. Doubtless their implacable hatred towards the whites was often rendered more terribly vindictive, from the im- positions practised upon them by wicked men. Especial- ly was this true in the eastern country, when the French war raged in its insane attempts to destroy English power and position in this locality; for it was undeniable that a systematic attempt was made to arouse, and unite, all the different tribes of savages in one fell purpose of utterly exterminating English settlements. To this end appeals were made to every base motive, passions were inflamed, fire-arms and ammunition were plentifully supplied, and scenes of carnage and cruelty, horrible beyond descrip- tion, followed each other with astounding rapuidity. But even this does not, in the majority of instances, fur- nish the most natural solution for their implacable animos- ities. They had only the lights of Nature and of tradi- tion for their guide ; the Great Spirit had given them the forests and the fields for hunting grounds, and the rivers and waters for fish and furs; time had established to them sole claim and jurisdiction, and they recognized no prin- ciple on which a strange people had a right to come into their possessions, and bid them retire from what was their own, hallowed to them as the heritage of their fathers, and as the burial place of brave ancestors, from unwritten ages. These feelings, doubtless, had-their full influence in the deliberations that must have been frequent and moment- ous, although they were of necessity unrecorded. They   THE FOREST BRIDE.        151 did not lack in true eloquence, and it requires no power- ful imagination to conceive of thrilling appeal and earnest persuasion, in many a rude assembly, till not alone did the forests echo, but inspired patriots, warmed to enthusiasm, vowed vengeance against those who trespassed upon their rightful domains. Thus, if they were, at times, concilia- ted by kindness, these reflections and emotions would rise and bear superior sway, and apparent treachery was the result. However, therefore, we may censure and anath- 'ematize cruel and bloody deeds, a true, Christian estimate of historical facts, will quite as often accord them the rank of savage patriots as of blood-thirsty fiends. The most of my life has been spent about this locality. My parents emigrated from the vicinity of Boston, with a respectable company, to form a new settlement in the Penobscot country. I was a mere child, but I remember every movement as though it were but yesterday. - The adventurers numbered about fifty, including men, women and children. A vessel conveyed us to the coast, and we struck into the wilderness, for the place of our destination. The Indians were supposed to be friendly,.in all the re- gion, and we were abundantly provided with small articles for presents, wherewith to conciliate their good will. The third day after a halt was made, and some progress was manifest in the erection of rude habitations, a party of the red men came upon us. They were the first we had met, and they made only pacific demonstrations. Our people soon came to a good understanding with them, and "afterward they were repeated visitors among us, and were always treated with consideration and confidence. The o   152       HOUSEHOLD TALES. chief of the tribe, Mesumeh, seemed to form a special at- tachment to us, which was manifested in a variety of ways, and always reciprocated. He came among usat all times, was always welcomed heartily, and never departed with- out some token of our good will. The feebleness of our numbers suggested precautionary measures, aild the importance of a constant state of prep- aration for defense was never lost sight of. The dwellings were erected in close proximity, an entrenchment was led around the entire enclosure, and a high mound thrown up within that. This afforded some security against sur- prise at home, and no man ventured abroad without his fire- arms as a constant companion, even when at labor in the fields. Whenever such little communities built a place of public worship, the seats were so arranged that the doors could be easily watched and reached, and bristling mus- kets stood at the entrance of every pew. Two years rolled away very peacefully, and the colony began to reap the fruit of its labors. The desert places were made glad, and the wilderness blossomed with luxu- riant beauty. Where forest oaks and the wild brier had vegetated, broad fields of maize nodded to the autumn wind, and bending grain danced to the passing zephyrs. All fears from Indian wiles had been lulled, and when we laid our heads upon our pillows, we slept as securely and happily, as if we had been in the midst of civilization. I seem to be now in the center of the little congregation that gathered in that autumn, upon a beautiful Sabbath.- It was a time of special interest to us, for the first child born among us, was that day consecrated by the solemn rite of   THE FOREST BRIDE.        153 baptism, and a more devout and happy company of wor- shipers never assembled. The day passed away, and twilight began to steal down over the forest, while I was sitting with my father- and mother, at the entrance to our humble dwelling, with the pretty child who had been the recipient of the day's solemnities) for she was the espec- ial favorite of the colony. Suddenly the old chief stood beside us; we were not a little startled at the apparition, for his approach had been so quiet and stealthy that we had no warning of it, and our Sabbath had never before been intruded upon. His very presence, at such an hour, was an evil omen, and his bearing deepened the impression of portending misfortune. His countenance was sad, he was evidently weary with travel, and in spite of his Indian habit of con- cealing emotion, his restless eyes betrayed an internal ex- citement, that arrested attention and sympathy. He sat down upon a stump by the door-way, and buried his face in his hands. My father and mother exchanged troubled glances, and with a childish impulse I approached the old warrior, laid my hand upon his knee, and spoke to him in the familiar terms I had been accustomed to use. "What makes you unhappy, grandfather?" said I, " the pale faces love you, and will give you food and rest." Mesumeh raised his head, looked first upon me and then to rey father, with a keen expression of meaning in his gaze, as he responded,-- "IMesumeh thinks not of food nor of rest. The tiger waits to spring upon the lambs, and there is no speed of the deer to save them!"   154      HOUSEHOLD TALES. I was too young to understand his meaning, but there were those among the settlers who had gathered around, who read a fearful interpretation to his parable. One of them asked him,- "Is there danger to the white man's cabin, that the good chief would warn us of?" "The eagle marks his prey, and when the eye of the wood-fowl is watchless, he darts upon it with swift wing, to gorge himself with plunder!" As the savage spoke, he rose from his seat, and seemed impatient to leave. Observing his gesture, my mother approached him, with anxious entreaty. "Stay, Mesumeh, stay and eat!" she said, " you are weary and need rest." I shall never forget the expression of the savage, as he replied to her, nor the words of his reply. "I The white man's squaw knows not when an Indian is weary! Mesumeh will bear a hunter's burden in the trail of the forest, and eat venison with his tribe, when the sun rises. The deer tarries at the water-course, and the wolf knows his moment; but the fox tires the hunter by his artful cunning!" He looked round upon us, for a moment, and then dis- appeared in the forest, as silently as he had approached. The colony was in alarm. The evident solution of the mysterious visit was, that an attack was determined upon, and the friendly savage had given timely warning. He had unquestionably used stratagem for this, and his res- ponse to my mother seemed to convey the idea that he. in- tended to travel all night, and join his tribe in the morn-   THE FOREST BRIDE.        155 ing, laden with plunder, as if just returned from the chase. Thus, suspicion of his errand would be avoided. Consultations were instantly held, and deliberate meas- ures taken for safety and defense. It was apparent from the hints given, that the hostile foes were at least a night's march removed from us, and would not advance before the next morning. This assured us of quiet for twenty- four hours, at least, but did not warrant a moment's delay in taking precautions against surprise. The windows and doors were barricaded, the entrance to the enclosure firmly stopped, and muskets and ammunition made ready for instant use. A patrol was concealed without, and the residents within sought sorrowful pillows. But little sleep came that night, nor the next, to the anxious dwellers in that doomed settlement. Mothers clung tenderly to their children, fearful of momentary at- tack, startled at every noise, till the beating of their -own hearts had an ominous sound. Fathers grew pale in the thoughts of slaughter that the next moment might change from imagination to reality; and men looked timorously upon each other, dreading the revelations the next hour might make themn. Still, the night and the day, and the next night following, passed in quiet and safety. The third day came with no signs of an attack. It was fine harvest weather, and the crops were bending beneath the weight of ripened grain, waiting for the sickle of the reapers. Delay would be disastrous, and after consulta- tion it was determined that the main body of the settlers should resume the labors of the field, while a few were left at the dwellings as a protective guard. An eminence   156       HOUSEHOLD TALES. rose in front of the settlement, at the, distance of several rods, which intercepted the view of the cultivated fields, from the top of wjich the entire surrounding country, for a considerable distance, was in full sight. Upon this hill I was stationed to keep a lookout, and give notice of any sinister signs that might be observed in any quarter. I was but ten years of age, but that was a duty attended with little apparent danger, and I should not have shrunk from it if there had been much. It was a moving scene when the farmers left for the field. The women and children followed us to the gate- way, with tears forced by an indefinable presentiment of evil; wives fell upon the necks of their husbands, and dar- ling infants were folded in the long embraces of fathers, whose hearts bled at the thought of the peril they were in. The last to be caressed was the little Emily, who came tottling toward her father, with tiny arms extended, for his parting kiss. He folded her to his heart, while tears coursed down his sun-brown cheek, and he could on- ly exclaim, with fervent emotion,- "God protect thee, my only child!" The little band, with fire-arms at each man's shoulder, were soon at labor, in the silence of expected attack, and with frequent observation of all about them. I kept an anxious watch in every direction, starting, often, at the al- ternations of shadows in the distant forests, and attracted over and over again, by the swelling and sinking of winds among the far-off trees. Hour after hour passed on, and nothing disturbed the autumnal quiet. Suddenly, while looking beyond the ter-   TEE FOREST BRIDE.        157 mination of the embankment about the dwellings, my at- tention was attracted to a little group of pine trees, about half way advanced from the woods, and I could not recall any observation of such trees before. I glanced my eyes in different directions about me, and to my surprise I dis- covered that small pines were scattered over all the plain, and two or three were quite near the foot of the hill. I perceived one of the most distant to be singularly agitated; it appeared to me to be absolutely changing its locality.- My attention was riveted upon it, to determine if my im- agination was misleading me. The tree moved--there could be no mistake about it. The horrible truth flashed across my mind; each pine tree disguised an Indian, and the plain was full of them! I turned to the field as quick as thought, to give the alarm, and confronted a savage who dealt me a blow with his tomahawk, before I could scream, and I fell senseless to the ground. It must have been some minutes later,when one of the laborers observed I was not in sight, and anxiously called out to the others, - "What has become of Edward?" Every man's rifle was in his hand, and gazing in the di- rection of their homes, they were appalled by the dense column of smoke, mingled with fire, that rolled luridly to heaven. "Oh God! have pity! The fiends have fired the settle- ment!" groaned the leader. The peal of musketry, the agonizing screams of mur- dered victims, and infuriate shout of savages, mingled hor- ribly as the little party rushed to the rescue of their de- , 14   158       HOUSEHOLD 'TALES. voted families. Several fell in the way, from the deadly precision of arrows flying from foes lying in ambush, and few were left to witness the cruel carnage. Within the trenches every building was on fire, demon yells and ter- rific wails resounded, and the exulting savages butchered, and danced, and howled, with infernal glee. They were met just issuing from the trenches, and the work of slaughter began anew. The whites attacked the besiegers with terrible desperation, and the fortunes of the bloody hour alternated from one to the other. Driven back into the fires they had kindled, the Indians now re- doubled their activity, and plied the tomahawk with mer- ciless hand, and with almost superhuman courage, the little band of whites battled with overwhelming numbers. In desperate devotion they fought for homes, and all that can make life endurable; and death was more welcome than defeat. Many of the bravest savages fell, and at length panic seized upon them, they rushed in solid body from the trenches and fled, howling, to the forest. The victory was complete, but purchased at a terrible cost. There were but ten of the colonists left alive, and these wounded and bleeding. Wives, children, and asso- ciates, mangled and shockingly disfigured, were fallen on the fatal spot, some even yet in the agonies of death. A more ghastly, and heart-sickening spectacle could scarcely be imagined, and for a brief moment the survivors could only give way to overwhelming grief. The sufferings of the wounded demanded their first thought, and every tenderness possible in their destitute condition, was speedily bestowed. Then came the- sad   THE FOREST BRIDE.        159 necessity of paying the last tribute of affection to the re- mains of slaughtered friends, and of seeking among the dead for the members of the different households. The slain were decently- collected in one ghostly company, and the living and the dead embraced the entire population, with two exceptions; Emily Pray and myself could not be found, and the hearts of the survivors were subjected to new wounds, by being forced to believe us captives with monsters of perfidy and cruelty. But no search discov- ered us, and the conclusion was inevitable. The ceremonies were hurried, but as decorous as could be in the painful exigency. One grave served as a tomb for all, fathers, mothers and children; and with the heart- broken moans of desolate woe, a hurried prayer was said over them, the grave closed, and a rude heap of stones piled above the slumbering victims. The savages who fell were thrown into the flames they had kindled, and when the wild echoes of the flying foes died away in the distance of retreat, their missing comrades were consumed to sense- less ashes. Then came the terrible reflections upon the lot of the survivors, more to be commiserated than those who had fallen. Five men, three women, and- two children, of all the happy society that worshiped together three days be- fore, were alone left; and of these, my own father and mother were the only relations. The - children had lost their parents, and the adults had seen children and wife, or husband, butchered with the same destruction! It is not in the range of language to picture such a scene of des- olation, nor even of imagination but by numberless rep-   160      HOUSEHOLD TALES, etitions of just such catastrophies, were the happy homes of New England established. The dead were buried, and the appalling ruin was man- ifest. No shelter for the coming night, no food save the unhoused grain of the fields, and no safety remained to them. Anxious and doubtful was the look into the future, and the present was -frightful. But some resolution must be speedily taken, and as speedy action follow. To the south of the settlement, at the distance of two or three days' travel, another colony had been founded at an earli- er period, and probably had not yet been attacked, as the savages had come from, and retreated to the north. It was soon decided to strike into the wilderness and seek this settlement, since in their weakened and disabled condition it was impossible for them to remain where they were. Preparations were hastily made for the perilous jour- ney. Such articles of clothing as could be gathered from the scanty remnants were bundled together, a few cook- ing utensils, and as much grain as the party could bear, were collected, and the mournful group turned to take a last farewell of the sad spectacle. Bitter wails rent the air, as the dead were left behind them. Outside of the trenches attention was arrested by a pe- culiar trail in the long grass leading to the woods, hereto- fore unobserved. Blood was apparent, and the path was strongly defined, as if a wounded body had been dragged toward the forest. "Let us follow it up," said one,;" it may be there is life to save yet." "Life can scarce be hoped for," said another, " nor can   THE FOREST BRIDE.        161 it be anything beyond some Indian's body; we waste time in hunting for them." This suggestion seemed wise, and the party turned on their steps,- and in a -moment after disappeared in the for- est. Silence and sorrow were the companions of every heart and desolate was each soul's consuming grief. To my father as the eldest of the survivors, was accorded the post of leader, and as he threaded the paths of the wil- derness his mind reverted to his own bereavement, and a new thought flashed upon him. Turning to the compan- ions of his flight, he said,- "Stop! I must return-to follow up the bloody trail.-- Two of our children. are missing, and it may be in cap- tivity; but it may be this trail will throw light upon the doubt, and I would rather, a thousand times, be assured that my son is dead, than bear the horrible suspense of be- lieving him subjected to the cruelties of torture." No reasoning could have been successfully urged in op- position to feeling, so evidently of intense force. But the idea, however strongly entertained, seemed preposterous to the others, and one of them said to him,- "Is there any probability that the trail can have any connection with the lost children? Remember that Ed- ward disappeared from the hill, and could not have been at the entrenchment at all; while Emily could not possibly be of sufficient size or weight to have made the path. ' Noth- ing but a heavy body could have done it." "I have thought of all that," replied my father in a de- termined tone, " and know that reason is against me. A presentiment is often stronger than reason, and I am im- "*   162       HOUSEHOLD TALES. pelled by a power I can neither explain nor resist, to re- turn and follow up the trail, in spite of reason, and in de- fiance of danger!" No farther opposition was made to his wishes, and leav- ing his companions to await his return, he departed, with a single associate, once more to search for the missing, ill the forlorn hope of a prosperous end. They were soon at the ruins, and their first scrutiny was at the hill from which I had kept watch. Here nothing appeared to sat- isfy them; there were no traces of blood, no footprints to be seen, and my fate was as mysterious as before. "Now for the trail toward the woods," said my father, "and whatever it may reveal I shall be happier all my life for making the search." The trail was found, and following up the bloody path it led them to a tuft of bushes, concealed by some over- hanging trees. Pulling the shrubbery aside, to look into the recess, the two burst into tears, utterly unable to con- trol their emotions at the sight presented. My father fell upon his knees, drew from her bed of bloody leaves the sweet infant of the Sabbath's baptism, and folded it to his heaving bosom, sobbing in grateful joy. The child was unharmed, and as she roused from slum- ber, she entered into demonstrations of gladness, by all the pretty modes that infancy teaches. As soon as they could compose themselves sufficiently, they knelt together and offered fervent thanks to Him who directs the thoughts of man, as the rivers of water are turned. They believed the presentiment which had led to such happy issue, was a special inspiration of the Divine Mind, exercising pro-   THE FOREST BRIDE.        13 tecting love over an innocent immortal, and they rejoiced in it with appropriate reverence. Happy simplicity of a childlike Faith! Who will say they were superstitious! The infant had not been preserved by human care and forethought, in any view. There had been attached to the colony, a sagacious dog, who had been forgotten in the overwhelming ruin. With an instinct scarce differing from reason in its resources, this faithful animal had often dis- played astonishing acts of devotion, and was beloved and caressed with sincere affection by all. He was an especial favorite with the children, and acted as the self-constituted guardian of the only babe in the colony, on frequent occa- sions when she was at play without the dwellings. What may have been the noble fellow's employment during the terrific conflict no one knew; but with an Indian's arrow through his loins, Lora had dragged the child from the im- pending death, and with his own life's blood oozing from both flanks, toiled with her through the long journey, se- lected an undoubted place of security, and died watching her unconscious slumbers. The faithful brute, mayhap, knew a happy annihilation; yet one can but feel that he was worthy to look from bet- ter worlds, and appreciate the happy smiles of his charge, as she looked up from her resting-place, as it had been the face of an angel. It was due to him, the decent burial they waited to give him, and the hasty monument of a huge stone that was rolled upon the spot! The route to their impatient companions was speedily accomplished, and every heart thrilled with the happy re- cital made, mingled with a shudder at the thought, that ,j   164       HOUSEHOLD TALES. the orphan had barely escaped the fearful death of linger- ing starvation, after her signal deliverance from the bloody doom of her parents. But no one ever neglected her af- terward, for she almost seemed to the wanderers like the veritable presence of the Most High, and they venerated and loved her with devotion not unlike that felt by the Is- raelites, toward the ark that concealed the blessing. Turn by turn they bore her in all their wanderings, each man anxious to protect and guard her. The way through the wilderness was long and painful. With no guide but the sun, the party made frequent de- tours from the direct route, and became involved in laby- rinths of rocks and underbrush, that often appeared to be totally impassable. The exposure to the chilly night air, with scanty covering, aggravated the half-dressed wounds. and benumbed their limbs. The corn was dwindled to a mere handful, and but for -the nuts that the forest afforded hunger would have added to their accumulated sufferings. On the seventh day of their flight, worn out with exposure and toil, they fortunately reached the settlement for which they were in'search. Their mournful story was soon told, warm hearts welcomed them, and they were received into the community with earnest cordiality. The wounded re- covered, with rest and careful nursing, and there were on- ly bitter memories to remind the remnant of the obliter- ated colony of what they had endured. For myself I had only been stunned by the blow given me, and when I recovered consciousness I found myself securely bound to a tree, in the edge of the forest. My limbs were immoveable, and although I shouted in desper-   THE FOREST BRIDE.        165 ation, my wild halloos only swelled the tumult of the mo- ment without attracting attention. I could hear the yells of the savages, and the shrieks and wails of the terrified victims of destruction. I fancied that I recognized my own mother's voice pleading for life, and as death blows de- scended I could count their echoes. The mental agony became insupportable, and I swooned under the- torture I could not longer endure. Consciousness only returned to me after the massacre was ended, and I was borne along by the Indians in their retreat through the woods. As I sufficiently recovered my powers; I was forced- to take foot with them, urged on by repeated blows, and numberless acts of insulting cruelty. They traveled till night overtook us, and hideous howl- ings were answered by others, as straggling parties came t in from different quarters; fires were kindled, and rude ar- rangements were made for a camp. The night passed in wild orgies, spirits were freely used, and to the frightful license of savage dance and war whoop was added the in- decent madness of intoxication. Me they again bound to a tree, and from indignities, and repeated exhibitions of hate, I could only expect that I was reserved for some sig- nal torture. Young as I was, I remember I experienced a singular joy in the thought that I was the only captive. With the morning light the party again moved onward, and only halted when they reached their wigwams, just at evening. This must, I think, from the uninterrupted speed pursued, have been within the borders of Canada, and from after occurrences I have no doubt the whole ex- pedition had its origin in- jealousies -of Frenchmen. The   166      HOUSEHOLD TALES. returning warriors were welcomed by those who had re- mained behind, and another night of disgusting ceremony and insult I was doomed to endure. Recitals of the en- terprise were apparently given, now producing peals of riotous approval, while the group around the fires would leap in wild excitement, display the bloody scalps as tro- phies of prowess, and dance in fiendish glee. Then the tide of feeling seemed to be turned into an opposite chan- nel, as the loss of their fallen braves was brought to mind, and unmitigated malignity appeared upon their counte- nances, and rent the air with horrible howls. All this time I lay strongly bound, suffering terribly from hunger and thirst, wearied out by the long journey, and cramped in every limb. Still, I could not sleep, for , in addition to my forebodings, I was continually tormented by every species of petty cruelty that could be invented by the young savages that swarmed around me. I looked forward to death, at length, with anxious desire for it to hasten the end of my agonies. The following morning it was determined upon. - I was bound to a stake in front of the wigwams, and in presence of the assembled savages the horrible ceremonies com- menced. Infuriated demons danced about me, with every expression of ]late, brandishing their weapons, and strik- ing at me so as just not to hit me, and suggesting every possible idea of suffering. This over, they piled faggots about me, and forming in a circle, commenced another dance. One stood with a blazing torch, ready to light my death-fire, when a cry in the forest diverted their atten- tion. In a moment it was repeated nearer, its meaning   THE FOREST BRIDE.       167 recognized, and instantly responded to by the principal among the savages. It was the home cry of their absent chief, and an instant after, the kingly Mesumeh was in the assembly. With the speed of lightning he was beside me, and severing the withes that bound me, he turned his flash- ing eyes upon his astonished followers, and cried,- "Cowards, what do ye! Will ye fly like wolves from the sheep-fold, and bind innocent lambs to the stake?- The Great Spirit asks not the blood of babes, but the scalps of brave men taken in battle!" There were anigry mutterings at the disappointed ven- geance, and an old prophet, whose blood boiled with ha- tred to all white men could not contain himself. "The glory of the red man is departed," he said, "and there is no king! The Eagle of the Forest has become a dog of the pale face, and he crouches before him, and licks his hand!" "Evil Spirit!" replied Mesumeh, "thou utterest the ravings of the whirlwind, and its strong voice tells of thy own destruction. What has this unfledged bird done to make thee hate him? He has sheltered the red man, fed him with venison, and spread his mantle to cover him. Curse him no more!" The sulky savage still growled as he moved away, but the voice of the chief was one of authority and they did not disobey it. Mesumeh led me to his own wigwam, sat beside me upon his own blanket, chafed my benumbed limbs, and fed me with suitable food. He loved me as a father loves his only child, and guarded me from evil as assiduously as a mother her infant. All that was possible   168       HOUSEHOLD TALES. for him to do, to make my short captivity endurable, he readily effected, and I was witness to many angry scenes brought upon him for his faithful devotion to me. More than once he defended me from personal violence, and re- peated treacheries he exposed and circumvented. But I could gain from him no information of the extent of the massacre, nor of my own destiny. Any approach to the topics, on my part, was met by taciturnity on his, with a significant pressure of his finger upon his lips, that I could not misunderstand. By degrees I became accustomed to the rude life then led, and but for the anxieties that weighed upon me, pos- sibly I might, in time, have learned contentment. But I pined continually for escape, and in the short hunting ex- cursions that I was sometimes allowed to join, I was often tempted to fly. Still, no chance offered itself that seemed likely to be successful, and I could only wait. My deliv- erance came, at length, in a way least expected. One day there appeared in the camp several Indians of another tribe, whose reception indicated a degree of importance that was unusual. They evidently commu- nicated intelligence of an exciting nature, and the whole tribe were in a ferment. Councils were held, long con- tinued in earnest debate, and some extraordinary move- ment was about to be set on foot; that it had reference to the whites I could not doubt, not only from frequent allu- sions that fell upon my ear, but from sinister regards that I was conscious of being covertly the subject of. Yet I could gather no definite idea of its nature and intent. A general preparation for removal, apparently, followed the   THE FOREST BRIDE.        169 departure of the strange ambassadors, the braves decked themselves in their wild war garbs, and the squaws pre- pared themselves and their pappooses for a flight. In this condition the savages went to rest, and at an early hour the camp was asleep. These mysterious doings necessarily made me wake- ful, and I was in doubt whether they boded me good or evil. About midnight I observed a slight rustling in the wigwam, as of the stealthy tread of some animal. IMy senses became painfully aroused, and in a moment the tall form of the chief glided out into the moonlight. Cau- tiously I crept to the aperture and watched his motions. He approached each wigwam, in turn, stood in an attitude to listen, applying his car to the entrance, and thus passed the entire round. I crept back to my bed of skins as he returned, and feigned sleep. After a short interval I was conscious that he stood over me, and immediately one hand was upon my lips, and with -the strong grasp of the other he lifted me to my feet. Without a word he led me into the light, and with a significant gesture,- motioned me to follow him in silence. No tread was ever more noiseless than ours, as we glided away into the forest, whose depths were gloomily illuminated by the full moon that sent its rays struggling down through the dense foliage. ,  Our course was made due west, and I could not judge of my destination, since I was led directly away from all civilization, farther and farther into the wilderness. In about an hour we reached a small stream, and instead of attempting its passage, we-plunged into its borders, and wa- ded to the south. This was to prevent a trail from being 15   170       HOUSEHOLD TALES. left, in case of pursuit. We followed the course of this water for about a mile, when we again took the shore, but on the opposite bank. After an hour's rapid progress, the Indian stopped and listened, and the sound of a distant waterfall was distinctly perceptible. It seemed to give him special pleasure, and taking me by the hand, to urge a more hasty pace still; he made directly for the cataract. The sound of rushing waters became more and more loud as we approached them, and at length we came into full view of the noble Penobscot. Coursing along its banks, we soon reached a sight of the torrent as it foamed over the impeding rocks, and dashed d away on its sea-bound course, in the calmer channels be- low. The savage now made cautious approaches, steal- ing along with careful steps, holding his rifle ready for any emergency, while his quiver of arrows hung at his shoulder. He kept some object always interposed be- tween the rapids and ourselves, as if to prevent observa- tion. Occasionally he stopped and listened, snuffed the air, laid his ear to the ground, and seemed on the alert for some expected discovery. Apparently satisfied, at length, that -it was not safe to make a direct approach to the water, he uttered a characteristic "Ugh," turned ab- rubtly from his course, retreated a little distance, and then moved down the stream. We soon reached a bluff that was visible at some dis- tance from us, around which the river formed a bend, and climbed to its summit. The savage gazed through the distance, and pointing back to the waterfall, I immediately perceived the reason he had so cautiously avoided it. In   THE FOREST BRIDE.        171 the clear moonlight twenty or thirty wigwams were dis- tinctly seen disposed about the rapids, smouldering fires still emitted puffs of smoke, and on the shore below, sev- eral canoes were drawn up from the water. What the motive of my companion could be in seeking this spot, I could not imagine. That he considered it to be dangerous, his stealthy manner sufficiently evinced; and why he had led me into new perils, if he wished me well-- which I could not doubt- was beyond my com- prehension. The sequel, however, solved the mystery. Quickly descending the opposite side of the bluff, he plunged into the thicket bordering the river, and forcing a path through the underbrush, we gained the shore. Here a rocky point jutted out into the stream, entirely concealed from the wigwams above, by the intervening cliff. Upon this point he bade me to stand immovable, but gave me no idea of his own movements or purposes; then suddenly retreating into the thicket he disappeared. I watched for his return for half an hour, at least, while not a sound dis- turbed the stillness, save the distant waterfall, more or less distinctly heard as the night wind swelled or lulled, and now and then the echoed hooting of an owl. It was a desolate watch that I kept there, and the mo- ments seemed to me hours. The dense vapors from the river penetrated-to my skin, and the heated state of my blood from previous exercise, made me acutely sensible to the damp cold that benumbed mny inactive limbs. I began to fear I was deserted in-this wild place, and to increase my perplexity the moon went down and left me in almost utter darkness. .   172      HOUSEHOLD TALES. While plunged in gloomy reflections I was startled by the unmistakable -sound of a savage yell, piercing the ear. The sharp crack of a rifle followed it, and in quick suc- cession I heard four or five reports of fire-arms, and yell after yell rapidly succeeded in swelling dissonance. The camp at the waterfall was roused, the tumult was ap- proaching me, and I trembled in fear and doubt. What could it mean? Had Mesumeh fomented it, and with what object? Was he attacked by overpowering numbers, and already murdered? Why should he dis- turb the slumbering Indians at all? What was my rela- tion to the conflict, and what ought I to do for safety?- These, and similar -queries rushed through my brain with lightning-like rapidity, and cold perspiration fell from me like rain. Meanwhile the savage shouts increased in vol- ume as multitudes joined in them, nearer and nearer the gun-shots approached, and thoroughly alarmed for my own life I was about to rush for the wilderness; when another sound fell upon my ear, and held me rooted to the spot, in an entire revulsion of interest, for the mystery was over, and breathless hope succeeded. The rapid dip of oars fell plashingupon the water, and the enigma was unraveled; Mesumeh had stolen a canoe, with which to descend the river, the Indians were alarmed and in pursuit, and it was a chase of life and death! I was not mistaken; in a moment after a frail shell shot round the bluff, headed to the point on which I stood, and re- lieved against the darkness, the giant form of the chief was speedily recognized. The sharp bow struck the nar- row peninsula, and leaping ashore to steady the buoyant   TIIE FOREST BRIDE.        173 skiff, that danced like a bubble on the wake, he hailed me in a loud whisper,-- ' Quick, pale-face, quick!" I did not need another intimation to bound into the ca- noe; the bold savage followed, and with scarce a second's delay, the boat again shot down the stream, under the im- pulse of his tough muscles, like an arrow from a catapult. At the same moment two others darted round the cliff in eager pursuit, while the pack of demons upon the shore howled like 'maddened wolves, as they swept down the riv- er side, with all the speed the brushwood allowed. The sinewy chief redoubled his efforts at the oars, as the wild shouts of his pursuers gave token of their speed, and with the aid of the current we made rapid headway. But two good rowers, pulling evenly, are better than one, and each canoe in the rear was impelled by a brace of des- perate men. They evidently gained upon us, and as evi- dently one of the followers was some distance in advance of the other, which had gun-shot range, and one bullet came whistling over our heads, while another struck the water beside us, and went skipping along the surface. Me- sumeh had not yet discharged-his rifle; but when this sec- ond ball struck, he shipped his oars, stood erect in the canoe, and taking deliberate aim upon one of the oarsmen direct- ly in our wake, drew the trigger, and before the flash was out a scream and a heavy plash was heard, as his victim fell lifeless into the flood. The canoe, driven by the side- ward impulse of the remaining rower, veered directly to the shore, lost distance, and fell behind. Mesumeh re- sumed his oars, and again we flew down the stream. 15*   174       HOUSEHOLD , TALES. The second boat now advanced upon us, and it seemed to me that the wily chief was willing to draw their fire; for he doubtless knew the most difficult of all targets to be a swiftly propelled boat, directly in advance of the marks- man. At all events the bullets came, one striking us in the- stern, glancing off harmless, and the other dropping in the rear. Instantly upon the delivery of the second fire, before his adversaries could reload, the vld chief cool- ly shipped his oars again, letting the speed of the boat fall off, while the other came down upon our wake with redoubled rapidity, as they observed us to- lag. They were within a few rods of us, and our escape seemed to me impossible. But the most desperate emergency of a true Indian war- rior is precisely the time when nature develops his hidden resources. Mesumeh's tactics were deliberately wise, if they were necessarily desperate. A wild cry of joy rose from his pursuers, as they saw the victory at their hands; but with wonderful agility, the fugitive grasped his ar- rows, and two deadly shafts flew from his supple bow in quick succession. The maddened howls of pain that fol- lowed, spoke only too plainly of their fatal precision, and the next moment our canoe bounded down the river, safe- ly covered by the fog, and no longer pursued. The baf- fled anger died away in impotent shoutings from the riv- er's banks, till we could hear them no more. The morning light at length came to aid us in our per- ilous voyage. But we made no delay, except as we ap- proached some rapid, of which we encountered several, when with what aid I could give him, the Indian conveyed   THE FOREST BRIDE.        175 the light craft around it, till meeting smoother water, it was launched again. In this way we traveled till after midday, satisfying hunger with wild grapes, that grew in profusion by the water's edge. We must have made many miles of progress from the point of our departure, and the character of the country began to exhibit a change in its physical features as we approached the sea. Hills became less declivitous, broad meadows spread out from the banks of the river, and the stream itself flowed with greatly diminished velocity. A sort of bay opened upon the right bank, extending some distance inland, and leaving the stream, we struck across this lagoon, from which innumerable waterfowls rose as we disturbed their haunts, hovered in the air a moment,- and then dropped to their resting-place again. The canoe was soon drawn up on the beach, and we once more pur- sued a westerly flight through the wilderness. A journey of three or four hours, in a region scarcely impeding progress by tangled underbrush, brought us to the summit of a hill, almost denuded of trees, from whence there was an extended view in all directions. At the far south-east the waves of the Atlantic were visible, crested with flashing beauties, and in every other quarter the in- terminable bounds of the forest retreated, until the out- lines were lost in the clear blue of the horizon. It would be difficult to picture a scene of greater beauty. Au- tumn had thrown her livery over the fair forms of Nature, A and party-colored splendors clothed the broad woodlands. We stood awhile upon this summit, and gazed about us with captivated souls. The attention of the Indian soon   176       HOUSEIOLD TALES. became fixed toward the southwest, and with an expression of happiness, he pointed out to me a thin column of smoke rising in the distance, and curling away into the still at- mosphere. "Look, child of the pale-face!" said he; "the home of the white man lies in the distant valley. Go and be one with thy brethren. Mesumeh loves the pale-face! He entered his cabin hungry, and he gave him-food; he was weary, and he spread for him a blanket, and spoke the language of love. His children sat on the red man's knee, and his heart loved them back. When the wolf waited to spring upon them, Mesumeh's step was swift to give them warning; and-when the death-fire was ready to kindle, Mesumeh brought the anger of his tribe upon him to save thy life. He has shared with thee his cabin and his blan- ket, and when, the tiger laid ready to spring upon thee, Mesumeh was near to foil the leap. Go, now, to thy peo- ple; tell them there is no blood in Mesumeh's heart, and the strength of his tribe is broken! They fly toward the sunset, and leave their father's hunting grounds to the children of the pale-face. They may live in peace, for the Great Spirit bids us go! Hasten to thy fathers, and fear no more. The old man's heart is big!" ;As I turned about to grasp his hand, intending to urge him to go with me, he was already retreating down the hill, and deaf to my calls, he was soon lost in the forest, and I never saw him again. But the separation from theo noble old savage caused me sincere grief, and as I re- flected upon the abrupt events of the last few weeks, dur- ing which he had so signally preserved me, I wept with a   THE FOREST BRIDE.        1" keen appreciation of his friendship; sobbing aloud. But- this soon passed, and I then realized the position in which I was left, and the task yet before me. The sun was perhaps two hours high when I penetrated the forest below me, in the direction of the smoke. My lonely path was toilsome, but hopeful, and with a careful regard to the sun, I felt sure I was traveling in the right direction. Still, I witnessed with some anxiety, the rapid approach of sunset, and the necessity of a night in the woods alone. But darkness in a forest comes on with a peculiar rapidity, and to me it seemed hastening in sheer purpose of restraining my steps; for the sun dropped be- low the horizon, and I could guide myself no farther. While I was considering what provision to make for a comfortable disposition for the night, my ears were saluted with the sound of a brute beast, at no great distance from me. The loud noise sufficiently startled me, to pay for the delicious joy that came over me before it was ended. I could almost have embraced the animal, so much delight had the inarticulate voice occasioned me; and I can not hear the lowing of a cow to this day, without emotions of regard to the whole bovine race! It was a voice of civ- ilization, - of domestic prophecy ; it spoke of home joys, of cheerful firesides, and luscious draughts of lacteal nec- tar, poured by the hand of maternal affection! The lowing of cattle was suggestive to me. of prob- able nearness to the habitations of their owners, and I im- mediately sought their companionship. I had no great dif- ficulty in finding them, for as I approached the direction in- dicated by the repeated sounds, I was soon near enough   178     r HOUSEHOLD TALES. to hear the continual tinkle of 'old brindle's bell,' and it. became to me an unerring guide. I neglected the friendly herd, however, as soon as I joined them; for in the dim twilight I saw the houses of the settlement a short dis- tance from me, and with uncontrollable shouts of delight, I rushed toward them. 'Ten minutes later I was folded to the enraptured heart of my own dear mother! That evening was one of mingled emotions, as it occa- sioned mutual recitals of perils past, but happiness pre- dominated, and tears of gratitude flowed without restraint, as the assembled colony gathered to return united thanks to Almighty God for his signal goodness. I was as one risen from the dead, for no one expected ever again to see me. The name of lMesumeh was echoed with lavish en- comiums, and his virtues and memory were embalmed in every heart; if fervent prayers from devout believers ev- er avail to secure Heavenly benedictions upon a child of Nature, then am I sure that he has entered the sublime career of a glorified immortal in Paradise. The Indians never again disturbed an English settle- ment in the region, and after a few years my father re- turned to the scene of the massacre, and once more began life on the spot of his earlier perils. Prosperity followed him, and I think I may say that Black Swamp Farm is to-day worthy the reputation it has held for half a centu- ry. The fortunes of Emily Pray were indissolubly con- nected with the family. My father always insisted that she belonged to him 'by right of discovery,' and with no rel- atives in America, she found a home and devoted affection in his household, to the day of her death. She eventually   THE FOREST BRID.         179 became the wife of one of his sons, but died early, leav- ing an only child; their daughter still survives, mourning in her own sorrowful widowhood, but yet gratefully hap- py in the affectionate devotion of children, that are grow- ing up like olive plants about her table. As the old man finished his narrative, there was no or- dinary feeling visible with the elder members of the fam- ily. The narrator's cheeks were wet with tears of tender memories, and the matron bowed her head in silent weep- ing, for the loved and lost. When these emotions gave way to more philosophical proprieties, it was with a trem- ulous voice that the aged hero turned to Atherton, with a sad smile, as he added,-- "The daughter and grandchildren of Emily Pray!and the Indian captive are around you, sir, and you perceive that theirs is an interest that will not allow an old man's prolixity to grow tedious. My relatives who have lived and died, on this spot, all lie buried in a little enclosure, built about the place where the faithful watch-dog kept a vigil of death over the slumbering infant. I must of ne- cessity, soon lie with them, and I trust to meet them in the better land. In the morning I will point out the tombs to you, if you are interested to see them, as well as the re- mains of the embankment, the hill, and even the tree to which I was bound." The young man courteously thanked the venerable pa- triot, and with the fund of topics suggested by the finished   180      HOUSEHOLD TALES. recital, the remainder of the evening passed rapidly in a delightful conversation. By and by the patriarch took from its stand the Family Bible, read aloud a judicious portion of the sacred text, and offered a fervent petition to the Throne of Grace, overflowing with humble thanks- giving for life-long mercies. The happy household separa- ted for the night, and the traveler was shown to his room, where he was soon in deep thought, alone. How singularly the human mind is influenced by the little chance accidents of life, often impelling one in new directions, by trivial occurrences changing the whole end, aim, and purpose of one's being! The grandest results oftenest follow from some insignificant occasion; and the profoundest philosophy has resulted from some minute oc- currence- the falling of a lcaf, perhaps,-- that an at- tracted intellect observes, analyzes, and pursues to its pri- mal cause, learning the profound mysteries of Nature by a devout attention to the alphabet of her invariable lan- guage. A similar reflection is true of grand lives; which are directed, molded and rendered sublime, oftentimes, by the wise use of the trifles in daily experience. It was not singular, therefore, that Atherton laid awake upon his pillow, for long hours, his whole being moved as it had never been before, by the chance incident of hav- ing been overtaken by darkness, in a country unfamiliar to him, and from having sought hospitality among strangers. It was, really, the most important era of his life; and still an accident that a few hours previous was among the most improbable of all possible events. The young man was an orphan, the son of worthy pa- -- I ILI13UYI 1 W1VL1b,) VLV V LIJrCY   THE FOREST BRIDE.        181 rents whom he had the misfortune to lose in his boyhood. They had educated him in just the principles he found ex- emplified in the pleasant family at Black Swamp Farm, and his early youth had been familiar with just such acts of daily devotion as he had now been a participant in, - when his own honored father's voice led the morning and evening worship, and his fond mother knelt beside him, as she clasped his hand in the warm pressure of maternal love. Memory had never painted the holy attractions of those lost hours so vividly, as it now reflected the col- ors from the scene he had just left. His father's form rose before him, and he saw again the majestic mien, the beaming countenance, and he heard his voice of counsel and of benediction. His mother was with him once more, almost as real as in life; and the long-forgotten prattle of his angel sister, helped to arouse him to an appreciation of all the fascinations of home, - of one's own home! They were manly tears that secretly witnessed his emotions, as he realized, with unwonted feeling, the worth of the bles- sings that had passed away. Nor was it a violent transition of 4thought that began to picture to him similar attractions in the future, as he gave free scope to imagination, and earnestly longed for a fulfillment of his visions., When at length he fell asleep, it was in a happy determination to repeat, at no distant day the household of his youth, with a companion worthy of his love. - It was not surprising, therefore, if his la- test thoughts were of a beautiful maiden, reared in the calm purity'of domestic retirement, under the fostering hand of a worthy of other days, as healthy as her own 16   182       HOUSEHOLD TALES. native forests, and as pure as the breath of heaven. But whatever the wonder may be, such enchanting visions en- tered into his very slumbers; and he dreamed of angels, and voices of love, and marriage vows, and seemed him- self the center and recipient of them all. The morning sun, from a bright clear sky, shone in up- on the sleeper before he awoke from his dreams, and he was interrupted in the midst of a wedding-feast, by the, unwelcome summons to a more substantial breakfast. It had some advantages over the more splendid entertain- ment which he left so abruptly in shadow-land, since he now recognized the mysterious beauty that had been hov- ering about him in airy indefiniteness. She had assumed mortal aptitudes and sat before him in the person of Car- oline Weston, and he wondered if she knew how much she had disturbed his slumbers! Family worship followed the removal of the table, and then Atherton reminded his host of the promised intro- duction to the old landmarks. The children were clamo- rous for liberty to go with the gentleman, and this having been accorded by the indulgent grandfather, Atherton in his turn urged the females also to join them. Domestic claims withheld the mother, but even she insisted that it would ' do Caroline good to go!'- and so she went. Time passed pleasantly to them all. The children soon broke loose from the companionship of the elders, and romped, and shouted, and generated fun as only childhood can, while the old gentleman entered garrulously into a demarkation of the several locations of interest, to which his companions gladly listened ' the one from affection,   THE FOREST BRIDE.        183 and the other from that hearty, and respectful sympathy which a true gentleman will always yield to that which af- fects the happiness of the aged. From the moss-grown stones that covered the mortal remains of the early victims to Indian hostility, they as- cended the eminence where watch had been kept, and wearied by the up-hill toil, the veteran seated himself on a rock, to take breath. The stranger was quick to seize the first opportunity offered to draw, the maiden aside, and beguile her into conversation. She had scarcely spoken in his presence, and before he allowed himself to feel any deeper interest in her, he determined to sound her mind, and know the nature and extent of her culture. To this end he led her a short remove from the only listener they could have had, and they were soon absorbed in the de- velopment that each made to the other. Atherton made agreeable discoveries. The maiden's mind was as well furnished, ancq her heart blossomed as richly as her person. True she had none of the artificial 'accomplishments,' falsely so called; of fashionable life; but instead thereof she had read history, studied the best classic writers, ancient and modern, and had a natural ap- preciation and taste for the beauties of poetry. Her ' so- ciety,' therefore, had been of the first order, to wit, the master spirits of literature, and the personages introduced to greatness and immortality by their pages. From these her models had been judiciously selected; with a delicate appreciation of character, she had emulated the sentiments of heroines who ennobled themselves in the exercise of exalted principle and generous emotions, and in her ideal             ,   184      HOUSEHOLD TALES. world these were her companions and her confidants. Her quick perceptions taught her what appertained to good breeding and refined manners, and aided her to engraft into her nature all that belonged to true culture, while she studiously avoided affectation and finesse. Thus was she ready for any part she might be called upon to sustain, lacking only a little polish in action, and a little smooth- ness in adaptation, which contact with the world would be sure to give her. She was not unlike a novice of an actor, dressed in the richest appointments of the hero, with his role perfectly committed, and latent talent to render it, who yet wants a stage to act upon, and a well furnished support of correlative parts, when a rehearsal or two will proclaim the artist, and insure triumph. Their interview was sufficiently prolonged to give time for these evidences of culture to crop out'with fascinating power over the gratified stranger. She had seen him just enough to be free from constrained reserve, while she held that species of admiring respect so potent to draw forth a noble woman's nature. -There was a luxury to her in the sympathy awakened by contact with such a man; and his graceful ease gave her such self-possession, that forgetting any-conscious lack of attainment, she warmed into elo- quent feeling, and did herself justice, Her thoughts were fresh and healthy, her heart free from sentimentalism, and her opinions mature. She expressed herself in choice language, and occasional quaint beauties of phrase lighted the prevailing harmony with sudden sparkles; her love of natural scenery gushed in poetic description, and. her comments were at once forceful and modest. Atherton   THE FOREST BRIDE.        185 had never met a woman at once so artless and so cultiva- ted, and he gave himself up to unrestrained admiration. Neglectful old watcher upon the rock, yonder! - Again has a sly assassin accomplished his stealthy purpose on the hill-top! Unseen, unheard, unexpected, his wily footsteps came swiftly, his level bow impelled the fatal arrow, and a human heart is transfixed. Yet, curious miracle! the wound is cherished, and can only be healed by another victim. Cupid already aims his second shaft! It was with regret that Atherton read the sure signs of a pleasant day, for he would gladly have availed himself of a storm, as an occasion for a longer stay. But the sun shone, and the wind set from a fair quarter, so that he could not appropriately delay his departure. His chaise drew up to the door, his horse thoroughly refreshed, and after some slight gifts to the children, the traveler drew his purse to liquidate lMs obligation to the host. ' No, no," said the generous, old captain, "it is more blessed to give than to receive, and I never do these acts for money. Put up your purse, my friend, and repay us by a call on your way back. We shall all be glad to see you, if you like our quarters." Atherton had no hesitation in making a promise so verv easy to fulfill, and with abundant thanks for the courtesies he had received, he expressed a hope for an opportunity to reciprocate the kindness. "Never mind it, never mind it!" said the old gentle- man, "my days among men must be few, and I wish to be happy in acts of kindness while I stay. Still, it may be that my little flock will need sympathy when I am gone, 16'   186       HOUSEHOLD TALES. and if Providence so leads, you may reward them. God bless you, sir, and give you a prosperous journey!" "Be assured," said Atherton in parting, -I shall not forget your friends, and will strive to repay them with an abundant usury.'?" And thus he bade them farewell, while the little folks called after him,-- "Good-by, good-by, kind Mr. Atherton, come again, soon!" The old man stood looking after the vehicle as it passed away, indulging in a low whistle that interpreted his si- lent musings, till turning to enter the house, he uttered in a low tone his commentary, - "Upon my word, a very proper and interesting gentle- man, and I think we shall know him more, if my old heart has not forgotten the signs! Well, well, I doubt if any thing could be better; my pet is adqueen!" His 'pet' had not been in a mood to tarry among the family during the parting compliments, but sought the re- tirement of her chamber, looking from beneath her curtain as her grandfather gave his benediction, and Parted from him thus, and stood Watching in sighs, till he had disappeared On the hill-top. Some weeks later the return call was made, and all par- ties found a two days' visit very pleasant. The young couple used opportunities for uninterrupted converse, and each grew more deeply interested in the other, as they came to fuller appreciation of the innate qualities of ex-- cellence that both possessed. When they parted again,   THE FOREST BRIDE.        187 although no declaration of love had been made, their souls were knit together for eternal destinies. Months rolled away and spring-time came. The long winter evenings of the forest family were enlivened by the contents of books and magazines, that had traveled a long distance under Atherton's direction, and every week afforded them a letter, always welcomed with overflowing delight. Oftentimes a special missive gladdened the eyes of the pretty maiden, and its contents were sacredly con- cealed in her heart, above which each messenger rested until superseded by a later. With a prudent anxiety for the consequences that he foresaw likely to result from his hospitality, captain War- ren early took the precaution to ascertain somewhat more regarding the stranger than his own communications af- forded. For this purpose he corresponded with an old companion in arms, and the result proved that he had not been misled in his favorable predilections. His admira- tion increased with all he heard, and his interest in what- ever related to the young man was scarely less than that of his grandchild. As the warm weather began to breathe upon the land- scape, and melt away the ice-bonds in which nature had so long been fettered, the strength of the good man failed, and he seemed to keep pace with the winter in his depart- ure from the earth. The palsy of age came over him, and as his friends moved noiselessly about his bedside, it vas painfully apparent that he was about to be gathered to his fathers. But his heart was set at rest upon the fu- ture happiness of his idolized 'pet,' as he always playfully   188       HOUSEHOLD TALES. called her, and when he perceived that the footsteps of Death were approaching, he waited calmly, and seemed ready for the change at hand. One day a letter came -to him in the now well-known hand of Atherton. The feeble man called for his glasses, the last time he ever used them, and with difficulty made himself master of the contents, which filled him with un- usual emotion. Tears flowed over his aged face, his bo- som heaved, and with hands devoutly folded, he whispered forthl his deep thanksgiving, - "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless His holy name!" He remained in quiet happiness for a brief period, as if in a delicious revery, and then calling his eldest grand- child, he gave her the missive, saying, - "Caroline, my precious daughter, sit beside me and read that letter!" She was deeply agitated as she perused it, and when it was finished she laid her head upon the old man's bosom, and sobbed like child. But they were blissful tears, and witnessed only an affection answering to the fervency, of that of the honorable writer. "He asks thy hand in marriage, my child," said the ex- ulting old worthy, "and I know how gladly thy heart will respond. I loved him the first hour I saw him, and now that he has made this request through me, as your pro- tector and guardian, my happiness is complete. I would look once more upon his noble countenance, if it were the Lord's will, but he will not be here for- two weeks, and then I shall be in Heaven! I have only desired to tarry   THE FOREST BRIDE.        189 to see this hour, and my prayer is heard; I dare not ask the Lord for more. Tell him the dying patriarch's bles- sing is upon tim, and love him and cherish him all thy days. No happier earthly lot can be given thee than will be that of such a man's wife. Go with him to his home, and forget not to rear thy children in the good old ways of their fathers, and teach them to love and honor their fathers' God!" The extraordinary excitement, and the effort made to speak, produced a severe exhaustion, and he sunk gently upon his pillow, breathing away his soul in quiescent joy. At intervals his lips moved inaudibly, and for a few hours after smiles dwelt upon his countenance, and life waned away as pleasantly as the sunlight faded, dimmed and died upon that pleasant vernal evening. Two companions, inseparable from human destiny, were guests at Black Swamp Farm that night - Love, with its bewitching spell, and Death the .unlovely. Yet immor- tality ever radiates from one, and the other has but tem- poral power! In a distant city, on that same evening, two young mer- chants sat conferring together, after the labors of the day were over, and it may not be malapropos to listen to their closing conversation. They were both fine specimens of Yankee manhood, and were intimate friends, as well as business partners. One was the husband of an estimable wife, who made every honorable effort pleasant to him, even if weariness accompanied it, while the other was a bachelor, who seemed to be utterly invulnerable to the as-   190      HOUSEHOLD TALES. saults of Cupid. It was doubtless true that many a fair damsel's heart had experienced a fluttering wish to be the successful heroine of his idolatry, for he hat every attrib- ute to awaken love, with a worldly position that any heir- ess, even, might appropriately covet. He was uniformly esteemed by old and young, the life of social festivities, and the favored guest at every tea-table, especially if an array of, fair daughters made maternal hearts throb with ambitious pride in their charms and accomplishments.-- Yet in vain was the net spread, in vain the lure exposed; either he could not read the proffered mysteries of modest willingness, or he had no love to bestow upon anything beside the choice flowers in the greenhouse, which he in- herited with the paternal mansion. Upon this he lavished his care, gave courteous, yet cold attention to all his fe- male admirers, and was pronounced a confirmed benedict. Such was the younger partner, to whom the elder said as he was rising to leave, - "By the way, Atherton, when do you say you are in- tending to go down East? I have forgotten what it was you told me about it."' "I wish to leave a week from to-day, if nothing inter- venes to prevent. I may get information that will de- ter me from going, but do n't anticipate it."     ; "I thought you told me that the vexatious and long- winded old affair of your father's estate was closed up to your satisfaction last Fall?" "So I did, and my purpose now has no connection with that. It is an affair of some consequence to myself, as a matter of taste, and I must be present to see to it."   THE FOREST BRIDE.        191 "Well, it is n't my concern, specially; but pray let us have no more lumber speculations!" "Nothing of the kind, Winslow! It is, I might say, only a freak in Jloriculture. I discovered, last autumn, in a secluded place in the forest, a most singularly beautiful blossom, which I have determined, if possible, to secure and propagate. I assure you it is a, rare plant, greatly prized where it is known, and with many virtues beside its beauty. An old farmer first called my attention to it, and the more I investigated the more I became interested and attracted by its charms. I saw but one specimen, and the old gentleman I spoke of has' taken care of it all win- ter. I have written to him, and if I get a satisfactory re- ply, I am going to Maine on purpose-to transplant it my- self; I would n't let any one else do it for all my Collec- tion! What say you to the idea?" Winslow did not observe the lurking smile with which his friend uttered his eulogium upon his eastern-flower, or he might have detected latent mystery in his expression. He suspected nothing beyond the fact stated, and there- fore replied, - "I say you talk like a man in love; and if you would take a fancy to one of the damsels who are dying for you, and devote half as much thought and attention to her as you do to your hot-houses, you would possess the hap- piest wife in Christendom." ' Every one to his taste, you know," replied Atherton, "and if you seriously advise me to get married after I re- turn, why, I'll - think of it!" The two friends parted and went their several ways, e^   192       HOUSEHOLD TALES. each absorbed in reflections upon domestic felicity. Ath- erton had intended to make a confidant of his partner be- fore leaving; for no one of his friends knew anything of the state of affairs. The conversation just ended, howev- er, suggested a little jeu d'esprit, and as he walked along home, he planned a surprise for his intimates and admir- ers in keeping with his known tastes. In due time the post brought him news of a twofold in- terest; the letters he received, not only announced the ap- proach of his. own crowning happiness, but also the sad in- telligence of the departure of his aged friend. His wish had been expressed that the nuptials of his favorite might not be postponed, and as much as the lover regretted the loss of his venerable friend, he departed with speedy haste to claim his bride. The wedding was as quiet as befitted the circumstances, and as happy as wedding could be. "Sister Caddy is going off with Mr. Atherton alone, after all!" said the little Emily, smiling in spite of her tears, as the chaise stood ready to bear them away.- "Yes, yes, my pretty sister," said Atherton, seizing her and overwhelming her with kisses, ".but remember you have promised to come, too; and I am to have you all to make my home happy, just as soon as mother can get her affairs in readiness. God keep you till then, darling!" The vehicle departed, and the Spirit of the cold, dark night, that led him to the hospitable old farm-house, six months before, laughed in glee at the happy end of his plotting, and whispered joyful marriage hymns from every bough that waved in the fiagrant Spring wind. There is ever a good spirit to lead us out of darkness and storms! - ....   THE FOREST BRIDE.        193 A week later, a brilliant assemblage crowded the par- lors of the young merchant, in waiting suspense. Cards of'invitation had been circulated among his friends of both sexes, to visit him at his paternal mansion, 'for the pur- pose of seeing a specimen of a native flower, that he had transplanted from the wilds of Maine.' He mingled with his guests awhile, with an elegant ease never more con- spicuous, and if the young beauties about him ever sighed for the right to preside over a superb residence, then a hundred hearts palpitated with kindling desire. They are not to be blamed therein, it demonstrated their correct and refined taste. Atherton at length retired to produce his beautiful ex- otic, and a hum of expectation ran round the rooms, and many a pleasant matrimonial jest enlivened the social buzz. At length a sudden-silence hushed the assembly, every body swayed forward to catch a glimpse, a side door was opened, and the young husband proudly led his beautiful bride into the astonished throng! "What advice can my honored partner afford me re- garding floriculture, this evening?" said he triumphantly, as Winslow approached some moments after, to salute the bride. "After all my warnings," replied his friend, with hearty laughter, " you have at length fallen a victim to passion- flowers and tulips!" 17   A WILL AND A WAY. OR, THE PAUPER LAD OF WOODEND.

WOODEND COTTAGE had been a delightful place in its day, with its lawn in front, filled with variegated and odorous blossoms in the summer time, while the honey- suckle and woodbine interlaced themselves over the lowly dwelling, almost concealed in the clustering foliage. The hum of bees, the crowing of home fowls, and the mellow lowing of well-fed kine, were but tokens of frugal fore- sight on the part of its owner, and the pleasant lives of its inmates, flowed on like the babbling brook that run along the valley, just below. There were warm hearts there, and stout hands; and if the bread upon the table came by the incessant toil of one, it was always made blessed by the outflowing of fervent love and contentment from the other. Necessary labor never fails to sweeten repose, and even   ,      A WILL AND A WAY.       195 sparing food is doubly commended to toil-wakened appe- tite, - and both were ever the portion of the residents at Woodend. John Watson was a poor man, but his was honest pov- erty. Early and late, in summer and winter, his strength was given to his heavy hammer at the anvil, and the blaze of his forge glowed not warmer than the sympathies of his heart, nor helped to fashion proofs of his handicraft more durable than were the virtues of his humble life. Bred where esteem was paid as the price of virtue, and honor as the reward of worthy struggles, he never felt that either was restrained from him on account of his life of penury; and on Sundays and holidays no man wore a more comely garb, nor was greeted by a warmer grasp of the hand than he. When his gentle wife was in health, and walked along by his side to the village church, leading their only boy, there was pride in his firm step, as well as happiness in his heart, for his help-meet was a fair flower of womanhood, whom every body loved not less than he. At such a time you could never have dreamed that John Watson was ev- er discontented with his hard lot, nor that a shadow ever came over his spirit, brooding like a cloud, over the fear- ful future. The happy glance of his hazel eye, his sunny smile, and the rich, round tones of his merry voice, were a talisman of joy to all who met him. But there had come a sad change to the worthy black- smith. His own loving, devoted Esther had been blighted like a blossom, and her rosy cheeks and eloquent eyes had long been faded; the natural grace of her form had been   196 -      HOUSEHOLD TALESe destroyed by the rough hand of disease, and for months and even years, had she been laid upon her bed, a gentle, quiet sufferer. The loss of beauty and of comeliness, he did not think of regretting, for itself, but it had come by acute suffering, through long and terrible pains, and with the necessary expenditure of time and money, that he felt in a two-fold form; in one regard it was constantly wearing away the little property he had saved, and in an- other it prevented him from earning his usual wages. It was from a cruel necessity, therefore, that a mortgage ex- isted upon the' little home property, and that one after an- other the cows were sold, and from want of time alone, the hedges had been left untrimmed, the garden neglected, so that the beauty at the cottage was fast passing away. - Yet the owner provided every needed comfort for his in- valid wife, and nursed her many a weary hour, when no hand but his could seem to alleviate suffering, and calm the insupportable agony of a shattered nervous system, Although John Watson never uttered a word of com- plaint, in his many hours of lonely contemplation he often thought of dark days to come. Aside from his wife's in- curable malady, their little boy was not strong, except in qualities of mind and heart, and the father sometimes felt a fearful shudder creep over him in his reveries, at the bare possibility of being stricken down himself, before his loved ones were at rest; for he knew well, that in such an event, no hands would labor for them like his, no other na- ture compassionate them as his heart had done, and no other man sleep upon a hungry pillow in order to provide delicacies for her whom he loved better than life.   A WILL AND A WAY.       197 Though he had many causes for sorrow, therefore, that which most vexed him was the looking for evil to come; and as he sat in the murky shadow of its portended form, foreboding gave him a coward heart; slavish fear made him wretched, and the evil which he dreaded was has- tened, for the soil was made ready for the seed. 'The wise Physician of our weal loveth not a doubting spirit; and to those giveth he good who rely on his hand for good, and those leaveth he to evil who fear but trust him not.' The woeful presages of his darkest hours at length be- came realities; sickness came upon him just in the depth of winter, and the sparks flew never again from his anvil, and the ringing music of his hammer was forever still. A fever wasted his stalwart strength, and the tough sinews of his brawny arm were like untwisted cords, while the burning disease worked madness in his brain. His mind became a prey to all the terrible pictures his fears had fore- shadowed, and his invalid wife, and darling boy seemed to him to be already suffering all the horrors of destitution and starvation. Hunger and cold assumed personal at- tributes, and his diseased imagination tormented him with their presence, whilhey stood in gaunt nakedness, mock- ing his fears and dermining his reason. Thus was the evil day hastened; and when a calm mind, and a hopeful spirit might have aided a robust constitution to throw off disease, giving a recuperative power, their opposites sped the deadly work, and hastened his dissolution. Esther Watson did not long survive her husband. Her spinal troubles had precipitated a consumption, and the in- sidious nature of this scourge wrought its invariable re- 17 l   198       HOUSEHOLD TALES. suits. Though it conducts its victim by devious approach. es, and oftentimes inspires hope of escape, its footsteps ever loiter about the tomb. Sometimes, for many a long weary day it beguiles the sufferer by false appearances, whispering deceptively, yet its flowers wither in the pluck- ing, and its siren song is a funeral hymn at the last. So was it with the invalid at the cottage; wearied with sleep- less vigils, deceived by a thousand specious signals, and hopelessly feeble at last, but for her orphan boy she would longingly have coveted that dreamless slumber where the weary are at rest. It was mournful to see her dark, sad eyes follow the de- voted little fellow about the room, as he moved hither and thither in affectionate duties beyond his years. Painful visions of his future flitted before her, for she knew a pen- niless heirship was all that awaited-him. In his best es- tate the sacrificing labor of the worthy mechanic had only compassed the saving of a small sum, already exhausted, and the little outstanding dues from his employers would not be sufficient for decent funeral expenses for herself. True, she had ever experienced kindness from her neigh- bors, and believed them to be as sincerely benevolent as the world will average, - but she well knew that the rule establishes selfishness as the supreme god, and leaves the unfortunate to scorn, or neglect still more cruel. It was a terrible trial of her faith, therefore, that required her to surrender her darling child to the unseen care of the Fa- ther of the fatherless; but she was at length able to rest upon the promises, and leave him gladly in His hands who doeth all things well.   A WILL AND A WAY.       199 Thle sudden and melancholy death of her husband came upon her with astounding force. Upon his loving strength she had ever leaned for support; in his cherishing bosom she had rested her head in sorrow and in joy, for many a long year, and his care had mingled her potions, comforted her in trials, and alleviated her pains. Her lbss was too heavy for her enfeebled nature, and though she followed him to his tomb, she never after lifted her bowed head. James already began to feel what it is to be forsaken of father and mother. With a philosophy touching to wit- ness, he restrained himself before his dying mother, but when alone, or when she sunk into insensible slumber, he moaned in melancholy sadness. He brooded with a des- olate spirit upon the coming woe, and wept over the an- ticipated future, when no fond father could counsel him again, no tender mother fold his grieved heart to her sym- pathizing bosom, and take the sting from sorrow by shar- ing it with him. Henceforth,there could be for him no home of love; no shelter even, and no refuge, save among a host of the halt, the blind, the impotent, the deserted, and the vicious, in the charities of an almshouse! Amid his great grief he hardly heard his mother's dying bless- ing; and her words of counsel, her whispered benedictions fell upon his absorbed ear, as though they had never been uttered. But neither agonizing prayers, nor impassioned caresses, nor heart-broken lamentations, can delay the de- parture of a spirit when the Father calls, and he knew not she was dead until the cold lips gave back no answer to his warm kisses. Then the poor child wailed in over- whelming agony.   200      HOUSEHOLD TALES. There were kind-hearted people in the neighborhood, who had performed the duties of watching and nursing the dying woman while she survived, and who rendered the last sad offices to her lifeless form. The robes and the pall of death were decently provided, and the funeral cer- emonies came all too soon for the desolate boy, who sat at the side of the corpse during the day, and even stole from his sleepless bed at night, to find a melancholy compan- ionship by the silent dead. It seemed that his poor heart must break from intensity of grief, when his dear moth- er's body was laid beside her husband, and he stood in the midst of the assemblage alone,- all alone! For a few days the clergyman of the parish furnished the lad a shelter, and strove to inspire him with hope and fortitude. He counseled him of the better land, and the' way to gain it in paths of duty and obedience, which lis parents had followed, and tenderly recited to him the sto- ry of the Great Exemplar, whose way through life was in self-denial, who had not where to lay his head, and counted it a glory to suffer, since through suffering glory and per- fection come. He pictured to the teachable child the hap- py rest of the departed, and enforced upon his impressi- ble thought the sublime idea that he could honor his fa- ther and mother more by a life that would make their mem- ories enduring, than by obeying and loving them while he had been blessed with their daily example. "The dead live perpetually in their children's lives, my son," said the good man, " and though your father has fal- len at'midday, it is for you to bring credit and honor to his name, by a life of duty, and of earnest devotion to all   A WILL AND A WAY,        201 things pure and noble. If you think of this, you may some day bring more glory to your parents than you can dream of." These thoughts, suggested at such a moment, and with so much true sympathy, became to the orphan a living prin- ciple. ' Honor to my parents,' he repeated to himself as he reflected upon any employment, and ever after it was the maxim that directed all his ways. By degrees he be- came cheerful, and sedately happy, even; for there is no permanent misery that does not flow from guilt, and to this James Watson was a stranger. It is true he shed many bitter tears alone, and he dreamed, many a time, of the gloomy abodes of the dead, and shuddered to see them lie so still in the-robes of dissolution. The pleasant mem- ory of his lost home; the earnest devotion of his moth- er's -love, and the sterner strength of his father's affection were exhibited to him in a thousand new attractions, and taught him bitterly to feel his, loss. Yet he indulged no more in repining despair, but determined to stand in his lot with a noble, brave, and obedient spirit. Thence- forward lie recalled the features of his lost friends as an- gels of God, and ofttimes their cheering faces smiled in upon his soul from fleecy clouds and radiant stars; till he sometimes, even in his deserted childhood, felt that it was better to have friends in Heaven than on earth. The clergyman who befriended him in the first days of his bereavement,was himself a poor man, whose large family was a heavy burden to sustain with his meager sal- ary. A permanent home, therefore, it was beyond his power to give the boy, whom his heart sincerely cher-   202       HOUSEHOLD TALES. ished, and he had no alternative but to consult with the public guardians of the poor regarding his disposal. The reduced furniture of the cottage had been sold, to meet just claims, the mortgagee had taken possession by legal process, and the child was a homeless pauper. There ex- isted no special reason for a departure from established precedent, and in accordance with deliberate judgment, a home was furnished at the public charge. In the poor-house to which he was taken there was food enough to eat, and comfortable clothing for the inclemen- cies of the climate. But the pauper-lad soon felt keen- ly, the difference between a systematic provision for the public poor, and the scanty comforts of even the poorest home of poverty.  Here the gentle ministrations of sym-  pathy were supplanted by labor-saving system; the care- ful interest of watchful love gave place to routine, regula- ted by clock and bell; and the smile and joy of familiar converse were usurped by tones of authority and chilling assumption.  Alas for the public poor, who seem not to be recognized as children of the same Father with their more fortunate brethren, who are only stewards in their behalf! Would that a lack of true charity were only to be no- ted as the failing of public institutions, rather than the characteristic of society at large! How frequently does one meet with noble natures, bleeding in wounds ruth- lesslv inflicted by the cruel slights of some mean lordling of money! Hourly the tears gush, or stand eloquently trembling upon eyelids of injured indigence, while the tongue utters no complaint, and a smile of content is oft-   A WILL AND A WAY.        203 times forced upon the countenance!- Away with canting formalism, that makes the church a by-word, and the pro- fession of Christianity a reproach! The world is quite old enough for a commencement of that reign of benev- olence which will give something different from virtue in words and vice in deeds. The overseers of the town's poor at Woodend were no better and no worse than such dignitaries average, which is allowing them to be as kindly disposed as society war- rants. They bought meat and fuel, required the farm to be kept in order, exacted as much labor from the paupers, as was reasonable, kept the expenses down at as cheap a rate as possible, and had a religious service, gratis, from the different clergymen in town, every Sabbath evening. The institution was a model in its way. Ah! that sepulcher is full of dead men's bones! It is the veriest cheat and pretence that was ever assumed to give christian men and women a chance to evade the du- ties of personal sympathy, compassion, encouragement, friendship, charity, brotherhood and love. It ignores them all, and by thus systematizing benevolence, and reducing the christian duties to the simple and cheap process of es- tablishing and supporting agents, one can grow righteous by proxy; be left undisturbed to get rich, by the dishonest subterfuges of commerce; hold a position in the church, that will lead his brethen to give him a chief seat in the synagogue, and--go to the Devil at leisure! Oh! glo- rious systems that'emasculate Christianity by taking away its personal responsibilities, and funding its blessings I  A worthy rivalship to Romish indulgences!   204       HOUSEIIOLD TALES. Meanwhile James Watson, a representative of his class, feels the keen bitterness of lonely destitution, and the cutting curtness of abrubt authority, in the popular, and well-regulated alms-house. No one led him, at the blufh of morning, nor at dusky eve, to a bed-side altar, where winning Sympathy drew his hand in hers, and in gentle kindness equalized two hearts under the benizons of ' Our Father.' No one inspired him with sentiments of hope, and courage, and devout contentment under the trials that beset his life, by leading him to the Bible, and imbuing his susceptible mind with the spirit of Joseph, of Daniel, and of Christ. No one taught him that life was a battle- field, where honor and promotion were open to all, and in which defeat or victory is recorded by each day's deeds. In the neglect that he experienced, his sufferings were in- tense, and the long, cold, dreary winter seemed to the lit- tle martyr of poverty, an age of woe. Spring-time came at length, and he was wearied of the isolation made for him by his pauper's garb. Thought to the young heart speedily generates resolution, and this is half the labor of any enterprise; for a strong heart makes a strong arm. He determined to leave a place so gloomily repugnant to him, and earn- himself a livelihood. The. manly reliance of his father's nature was developed in him, and he felt that he could knock at the great door of the world, and if it opened not easily, he would force an en- trance and build a temple for himself.  One night, therefore, when the inmates of the dwelling were asleep, the pauper-lad emerged from the window of his dormitory, dropped silently down upon a shed beneath,   A WILL AND A WAY.       205 and a moment after was in the street. He had left behind him the garments of caste, and was once more clothed in the attire that his fond mother had toiled upon in the last days of Autumn, and though already outgrown and un- comely, he felt a pride of conscious independence, in the very fact of wearing habiliments purchased by his father's honest labor, and fashioned by the dearest friend he could ever have. A single loaf of bread was his only provision, and yet a bolder and a happier heart than his was in that star-lit night, never inspired the breast of a lonely trav- eler. Over hill and valley he' fled, through village and forest, and when the morning light overtook him he was miles away from the place of his birth, and separated from every object with which he had been familiar. The young fugitive did not deem it prudent to travel by day, lest he should be pursued and overtaken. As light began to dawn, therefore, he sought a place of conceal- ment and repose, where he could refresh himself in safe- ty. A large farm-barn afforded just the retreat he wished for, and entering it unobserved, he was soon asleep in the fragrant hay. It was midday before he awoke, and rega- ling himself upon a portion of his loaf, he waited till night-fall, and then took the road again. The second and the third days were passed in a similar manner, and on the morning of the fourth day, foot-sore, weary, and hun- gry, his heart leaped gladly at the sight of lofty spires, of arching domes, and compact dwellings, as the rising sun burnished every minaret, and displayed the glories of the city which he sought. .At midday he trod its streets in penniless confidence, -but twelve years old! 18   206      HOUSEHOLD TALES. It was the first time the boy had ever seen a city, and so many objects met his gaze he wandered about bewil- dered, feeling how insignificant he was in the well-dressed throng that passed him by, without notice. He had no definite object, beyond that of finding some employment by which to obtain a livelihood; but how to secure that he had not reflected, and the hurry and bustle about him so diverted his mind and confused his thoughts, that he was unable to form a plan to follow. Hour after hour, there- fore, he wandered about, irresolute and timid, till the sun swiftly glided down its western course. The wanderer was excessively weary, and as the light began to grow dim his courage seemed also to die away. A large granite building, with a flight of steps in front rose before him, and the deserted gateway, desolate as his own heart, invited him to enter, and rest under the porti- co that overshadowed the doors. He passed in, ascended the steps, and seating himself on the uppermost, he began to gnaw the last crust of his loaf. Supposing himself to be unobserved, he yielded at last to the melancholy his sit- uation inspired, and wept passionately. But he was mistaken in the belief that no one had ob- served him. He had been watched for some time; his ru- ral appearance had been closely scanned, and even his fea- tures carefully scrutinized. His homely garb, his lieavy shoes covered with the dust of travel, his tender years, his weary and sorrowful gait and look, all had drawn to- ward him an earnest regard, that had been deepened by the notice of his intelligent face, and the air of honest simplicity that pervaded his movements.   A WILL AND A WAY.       J207 A true disciple of Him who went about doing good had encountered the wayfarer, and he remembered the cup of cold water given to the little one, when the Master as- sumed the right of a personal appreciation of the deed. Wherever misfortune, and trouble, or guilt, even, bowed down an impotent victim, Mr. Newton acknowledged a brotherhood, and sought confidence only to inspire hope, and to equal it with generous deeds. The boy chanced to look up from his weeping, and saw a well-dressed man standing before him, who smiled as he extended his hand. The lad read his kind nature intuitively, and to his inqui- ries gave frank and truthful responses. "You seem troubled, my little fellow," said the stranger, "dry up your tears and tell me about it." The sympathizing tones for a moment excited deeper emotions, and the boy sobbed anew. His companion ap- peared to understand the workings of his soul, and waited for the violence of his feelings to subside. Then patron- izingly patting him upon the shoulder, he said,-- "Come, my lad, I want to know all about it, - who you are, where you came from, what grieves you, and every- thing about yourself. If you have been doing wrong, do not hesitate to tell me, for perhaps I can help you to set it right. At all events, you need not fear me." The boy's nature was thoroughly excited. His heart was touched by kindness, but his honest pride kindled at the bare possibility of being supposed to have done some criminal act that occasioned his trouble. With a firm tone of manly spirit, therefore, yet with modest propriety, he told his story at a breath.   208       HOUSEHOLD TALES. "' I have done nothing wrong, sir, and I do not fear any- body! My name -is James Watson; my father and moth- er died last winter, and because they were poor I was sent to the almshouse. I can not honor them by living in such a place, where nobody speaks kindly to me, and I have run away. I want to find a place to work, where I can study evenings; do you know of one, sir?" There was something so confiding, artless, and genuine in the boy's manner, that his hearer felt convinced that he spoke the truth, and was withal, a lad of no ordinary char- acter. Confidence begets confidence, and Mr. Newton's heart was already interested for the destitute orphan. A farther conversation satisfied his mind, and made him ac- quainted with every circumstance connected with the af- fair, and taking the' lad by the hand, he said,- "Well, James, I think you tell me the truth, and to let you see that I trust you, I shall take you home with me, give you a supper and a bed, and then to-morrow we will see what can be done." No happier heart than James Watson's, as he- trotted along beside his benefactor, through the dusky twilight, ever beat-out of Paradise. He heard angel voices from the calm air, and he saw joyous faces smile to him from the evening clouds. He had found a home, -just the home he wanted! Mr. Newton was at the head of a business establish- ipent that gave employment to many persons, and he could immediately make James useful. He took the necessary precaution of corresponding with the authorities of Wood- end, and finding the child's tale entirely corroborated, he   A WILL AND A WAY.        209 established him as an inmate of his own family, treating him rather as a relative than a dependant. .The boy ap- plied himself diligently to the interests of his friend, and in the remembrance of his mother he frequently called to mind a lesson many times repeated to him, and which he tested, as well by the conscientious discharge of his daily duties, as in the rewards that followed. On the fly-leaf of his Bible she had written,- "My son, be always honest, faithful, and diligent, and friends will arise in darkness, and the Lord himself be an ever present help." Diligence and faithfulness became the characteristics of his life, and under the fostering care of a man like Mr. Newton he constantly enlarged his stores of knowledge, his qualities of heart, and his powers of mind. His pa- tron became more and more attached to him, and finding in him an aptitude as well as a disposition to learn, he af- forded him requisite assistance. His duties and his stud- ies were systematized, and by a judicious apportionment of time to each, neither became onerous, but each gave a zest to the other, and mental and physical powers were thus maintained in healthy equilibrium. Two hours in, the early morning, and two at evening were regularly be- stowed upon his books, and the aggregate result was what every young man might realize. With an enthusiastic temperament and a heart all faith, James Watson knew nothing impossible, and with a brave self-reliance he devoted himself to whatever pursuit he engaged in, always with a definite end in view, and never resting till that end was accomplished. He mastered the 18"*   f210      - HOUSEHOLD TALES; common English branches readily, and entered the- vast field of language with a keen relish. He learned Latin and Greek, with the accuracy of a scholar, and with this ground-work the modern languages followed easily, so that he conversed fluently, and wrote gracefully. But that which became to him an absorbing passion, was the inves- tigation of mathematical truths. tHis practical mind, his habit of calm reflection, predisposed .him to a successful -career as a mathemnatician, and it became to him a pastime to elucidate profound- and abstruse problems. Yet the pauper-lad of Woodend was not a genius, in the common acceptation of the term. He accomplished nothing but by the application of common talents, and the faithful use of limited time; he gathered no harvest that was not gendered of careful sowing, patient nurture, and diligent labor. It has been said, indeed, that such mental action, such consecutive and intense study, and nothing else, is true genius. It is, without contradiction, the pre- paratory accumulation of forces, which are at command the very instant an emergency arises; and though some brilliant thought, or deed, or speech, bursts upon the as- tonished' world with the blaze and flash of lightning, it is the result of electric accumulations that have' been silent- ly and slowly gathering in the unnoticed cloud; just as mighty rivers and towering forests, are the results of uni- ted rivulets and yearly accretions. The slow processes become at length embodied, and startle by stupendous and glorious' results;      Mani is; doubtless, in respect to intellectual and moral greatness, just what he makes himself.' The primary ad-   A WILL AND A WAY.       2" juncts are the same to all, and are to be found in our af- fections and passions, and are developed for good or evil, for impotence or power, just as we control them, and give them direction. It is as one wills, therefore, whether he spend life in frivolous pursuits, in idleness and folly, or in the acquisition of grand and useful accomplishments. It is not from natural endowment, then, but from the purpo- ses that inspire men, that one develops a mean soul, and another a magnanimous spirit; that one shines forth in all the attributes of genius, and another degrades his nature and carricatures his species by living only a dunce. It follows that transcendent influences gather around the commencement of one's career. Here lies the grand solution of the problem of differences in men. There is but: slight variation at the outset; but facility is acquired by one, while another sinks into insignificant inaction: the former advances steadily onward in the path of glory, hon- or, and heroic duty, while the'latter sinks into obscurity,; contempt, and selfish repinings. The sun shines, the rain falls, and the germinating soil is ready for the grain; but. only he who sows true seed, and labors, anldfatches, and waits, will reap the harvest of immortality. Each man's destiny is in his own hands; he who will may write a glo- rious and illuminated page, he who will may defile the record, and he who will leave a blank in the book of Life. With all his mental acquirements James Watson never felt any aversion to the toil of manual labor. He believed that limb and muscle, bone and sinew, had been given to man for some useful purpose, as well as his intellectual faculties, and he felt it to be as truly a sin against Heaven   212      HOUSEHOLD TALES. to neglect the one as the other. He knew that hardy ex- ercise, and temperate and abstemious living, were not on- ly health-giving, infusing crimson to the cheek, and vigor to the body, but that they stimulated the mind, and pro- moted earnest thought. He honored mechanics because his lost father had been a craftsman, and he felt that the truest dignity of man is found in the pursuits of physical toil, since it is 'to labor, and to labor only, that man owes everything possessed of exchangeable value. Labor is the talisman that has raised man from the condition of the savage; that has changed the desert and the forest into cultivated fields; that has covered the earth with cities, and the ocean with ships; that has given us plenty, com- fort and elegance, instead of want, misery and barbarism.' He acted wisely, therefore, in lending his name to swell the number of honorable names, who are the world's true noblemen, - men who have produced something in art or agriculture for the benefit of the race. At a suitable age, with the approval of 5Mr. Newton, the young man became an apprentice to a machinist, and into his new relations he carried the same spirit that had hitherto animated him. Devotion to his business, and fi- delity to his trusts, wrought out their natural results again, in facile progress in practical skill, and in the confidence, attachment, and admiration of both his employer and his associates. As a powerful aid to his art, the knowledge! he possessed now displayed itself, and the adaptation of scientific principles to the different branches of his handi- craft, effected miniature revolutions. Here a tool, that unreflecting custom had never thought of changing, was   A WILL AND A- WAY.      ,213 superseded by another better adapted to its end, and yet more simple in its construction, There uncouth forms of machinery gave place to both graceand utility; and sub- stitution of parts, and improvement upon the remainder, oftentimes changed a machine, so that its capabilities were greatly increased, while the economy of its action was at the same time promoted. An intelligent mechanic is a benefactor to his species. The myriads of articles of necessary use, derive their val- ue from the, faithfulness with which philosophy is adhered to in their construction ; and one man, understanding this, will gain a good reputation, and abundant patronage, be- cause he promotes individual comfort, while another, igno- rant of principles, industriously botches, and spoils his material. Millions of money and thousands of lives are yearly sacrificed by frightful casualties, that true philo- sophical knowledge would have entirely prevented. - Now it is demonstrated by the explosion of steam works; now by the foundering of a ship at sea; now by the crash of a falling bridge; and now by the horrible chaos of a lofty building, crumbling under the weight imposed upon in- secure foundations, and crushing hundreds of warm, beat- ing hearts, where victims are mangled beneath terrific ru- ins that bind-them in helpless agony, till angry surges of fire consume the funeral pile! Intelligent mechanics are the only refuge from such catastrophies. James Watson soon excelled as an artisan, arind brought both honor and emolument to his master's establishment. In his twentieth year he was considered a master of his art, and was complimented with the offer of the foreman-   214       HOUSEHOLD TALES. ship of the extensive establishment, with the promise of a position as partner, as soon as he attained his majority. He had realized the crowning ambition of his apprentice- ship, and a harvest of wealth was within his reach; and yet to the surprise of his master, both propositions were coolly received, time demanded for reflection, and an inti- mation given that they would be declined. One evening, not many days subsequent, the young man sat-at his master's tea-table, and was observed to be unu- sually abstracted in his manner, as if in deep thought up- on some important matter. He seemed to forget that he was in the midst of guests who had a claim upon his po- lite considerations, and absorbed in reflections, he forgot that he was observed. His brow was knit, his food un- tasted, and he heard nothing of the conversation about the table. At length his countenance suddenly changed, his eye lighted, and he exclaimed with enthusiasm, - "I have it,-- I am sure I have it!" The abrupt exclamation, so out of keeping with any topic that had been suggested, and the young man's man- ner combined, were not a little ludicrous, and the company indulged in a hearty laugh, which the furnisher of the merriment readily joined. "What spirit have you caught, James?" inquired his master; "I perceive no palpable evidence of your hav- ing obtained anything beside your consciousness!' ' I must go to France!" said the apprentice. "Go to France!'" echoed his -employer in astonish- ment, "I am afraid you have lost your wits, instead of finding them; why do you wish to go to France?"   A WILL AND A WAY.       215 "I cannot explain, to-night," he replied, 'for Mr. New- ton must be present when I do so; but I have determined to go to France." It was in vain-that he was urged to reveal his purpose, unless his old benefactor were present to listen. At times the painful fear was excited that his mind was injuriously affected, his conduct seemed so inexplicable, and so sud- den an impulse had taken possession of him to leave his native land. He had ever been contented, quiet, modest, and home-loving; coveting retirement, and averse to any course that attracted personal notice. Now, his manner was entirely changed; he seemed excited, triumphant, and earnest for a speedy opportunity to rove in a foreign land, and so far as appeared, with no warrantable pur- pose. There was an exciting mystery in the circumstan- ces, enough at least to give a zest to its denouement, and it was arranged that the same company, with the addition of Mr. Newton, should dine together a day or two after, when the secret motive would be divulged. Humble and insignificant as that pauper had been in his origin, his mind had been achieving silent conquests in the retirement of his studious hours, and by earnest ap- plication, culture, and self-reliance; his intellect had be- come bold as an eagle, 'borne on sinewy pinions, strong as the western condor - a soul soaring around the cloud- capped Andes of reflection, glad in its conscious immor- tality, leaving a worldrbehind.' He had wrought out a problem that had baffled the wisest thinkers, and the pro- foundest philosophers of the old world! The time appointed for the dinner party arrived, and no   26    H' OUSEHOLD TALES. little interest had arisen in the minds of his friends to be informed of the young mechanic's mystery. The viands speedily disappeared, the cloth was removed, and after a ,.short desultory conversation, he was reminded of the oc- casion that convened' them. "In the time of Napoleon," said the apprentice, "the government of France proposed a large reward to the sa- vants of the civilized world for the correct solution of a certain .mathematical problem. The prize still rests un- 'claimed, fo-ralthough many competitors have arisen to contend for, it, no -one has yet succeeded in winning it. The, British government, not to be outdone by its Gallic ;neighbor 4infitS patronage of science, reiterated the offer, and to-day two splendid fortunes, and the honors of two powerful kingdoms await the successful aspirant for the proffered prizes. I am going to France to secure them for myself." The astonishment of his friends may well be conceived at this abrupt announcement, made with all the assurance of a certain success, quite foreign to the young man's usu- al:^mobdaesty. An incredulous smile passed round the ta- 'ble; and, Mr. Newton broke the silence. "It seems to me,: James,:that you are somewhat pre- sumptuous in your expectations,-- a fault not usually to -be attributed to you. -Pray:what is the problem that you are so suie -of successfully elucidating?" "' The simplest possible rule for measuring plain surfa- ces, of whatever outline,'" replied the youth, unmoved by the want of faith exhibited. "( I have not overlooked the probable fact of skepticism, and even ridicule, as the price /   A WILL AND A WAY.       217 of my pretensions, and am therefore prepared for it; but fortunately, the history of the sciences furnishes abund- ant proof that neither avails against the demonstrations of Truth, and on that I rest." "Spoken like a philosopher, at all eventsl" said his friend, "'but where are your demonstrations?" " I have them at hand, and ask no faith upon trust!" re- sponded the other, as he rose from the table and produced a roll of manuscript. The young artisan displayed before his attentive listen-! ers some sheets of diagrams, accompanied by copious ex- planations perspicuously written in both French and Eng- lish, and proceeded to demonstrate his formula. His pri- mary statements were made with great clearness, the pre- cision and philosophy of his reasoning carried conviction, and as his deductions were one after another conclusively established, the astonishment and admiration of the com- pany knew no bounds. He had doubtless elucidated a mathematical secret that had escaped the search of pro- found thinkers in the old world, baffled the earnest skill of men renowned'in scientific annals, and henceforth his name would be emblazoned in the intellectutal galaxy of the world! Mr. Newthn's enthusiasm knew no limits; he gathered in that one moment of joy a glorious harvest for the good seed scattered, so long ago, into the heart of a desolate pauper, as he sat on his cold seat of granite, in the gathering darkness. He folded the noble boy to his heart, and with manly emotion, he exclaimed, - "Oh, the luxury of a good deed! Verily, angels walk in uncouth garbs, and meet us unawares!" 19   218      HOUSEHOLD TALES. The world is ever ready to help a rising man. The first essays of genius are seldom entirely successful; but an honest attempt at something noble will in most ca- ses receive the favor which it deserves. If with this at- tempt evidence of undoubted merit exist, friends arise in quarters least expected, and he who before stood alone and disregarded, suddenly finds himself the leader of a coterie, who are heartily anxious for his success, and will- ing to advance his interests. These persons are generally representatives of two Every different classes; the one be- ing sycophants, who derive a sort of reflected glory from those they patronize, and the other noble natures who find sufficient happiness in aiding honest merit. James Watson became the favorite of both classes, and if his character had not been established upon a sure ba- sis, he would have been in great peril from the adulation that succeeded his presumed success. The knowledge of his achievement soon spread out to the great world, and patrons became anxious to bear a part in his approaching triumph. Funds were placed at his disposal, preparation was made for the voyage, and in due time the pauper of the work-house embarked on board a packet ship, bound for Havre, where he arrived in safety, after a pleasant passage. He hastened to the American minister, at that time a gentleman as greatly renowned for distinguished culture and generous sentiments as for political eminence, who received his young countryman with cordial welcome. The letters which he delivered to that functionary, not on- ly besought the ordinary civilities for the bearer, but de- tailed his purposes and expectations. The minister read   A WILL AND A WAY.       219 them attentively, assumed a troubled expression, re-read them, and surveyed the youth scrutinizingly, as if in hon- est doubt of his senses. "Young man," said he at length, " are you the ' James Watson' referred to in these memorials?" "I am the person to whom they relate," said the young man modestly, 'and I trust Your Excellency finds noth- ing in them displeasing." "I have no right to be displeased at any respectful re- quest to serve a countryman, at least to the extent of my public duties, and these papers do not go beyond that. But there are discretionary limits to be observed in the exercise of my functions, and it strikes me yours is rather a Quixotic expectation." "I trust Your Excellency will not decline interesting yourself in my behalf, until I am permitted to show upon what foundation my proceedings are based. I think in- stead of doubting, you might, possibly, find sufficient rea- son to afford aid," replied the 'mechanic. "' I have declined nothing," said the ambassador; "' but your hopes, I avow plainly, appear to me chimerical, and I certainly advise you to abandon them. You are a me- chanic, and doubtless a good one for your age, which will make you wiser by and by; if you have hit upon an in- genious idea, it has probably been examined and explo- ded before you, by some of the learned men in which this kingdom abounds; your pretensions must be supported before philosophical societies, and in the French tongue, with which one of your pursuits can not be supposed to be familiar, and investigations will follow that must be sus-   220       HOUSEHOLD TALES. tained by profound acquaintance with mathematics. I have not the ability to meet these necessities; I mean no disrespect, therefore, if I question yours. If we could induce His Majesty to give us an audience, and vouchsafe to test your pretensions, you can see what mortification would ensue in case of failure, and what a source of rid- icule to our country. Be wise, my young- friend, abandon your fallacious hopes, spend a few days in loolking about this beautiful country, and I will secure you a return pas- sage to America!" The minister uttered this counsel sincerely, and there was no little persuasiveness in his manner at the close. But James Watson had not made a voyage across the At- lantic to be affrighted at a cloud. He therefore replied to the representative of his country with unpretending cour- age, as he smiled at the proposal to return:-- "I have not come three thousand miles without count- ing the cost; my discovery has never been referred to in any book or treatise on mathematics, nor dreamed of by those who have heretofore striven for the reward; I ask no assistance in sustaining my claims before any body of Frenchmen, if the opportunity is afforded me, and I can not return till a decision is made upon my discovery. In case you can find no sufficient grounds for your good offi- ces, I shall not complain, but endeavor to gain the ear of the King in some other manner." The -minister was moved with surprise at the cooI- ness of this response, and he walked the room in doubt. Here was a mere stripling, a common mechanic, daring a discussion upon an abstruse science, in a foreign tongue,   A WILL AND A WAY.       221 and before men of honorable age, and renowned in intel- lectual attainments. There was, nevertheless, a self-pos- session exhibited that was as indicative of intrinsic merit as it was lacking in perverse assumption. The ambassa- dor was impressed with a conviction of the propriety of a candid attention to the young man's claims, and with a greater sympathy than he had yet exhibited, he at length said to him, - "My friend, I have no time, at present, to examine in- to the merits of your bold purpose. Still, I shall be hap- py to discover that you are not the dupe of superficial attention to an abstruse subject, and if I find any sufficient justification, you can count upon my official zeal in your behalf. Return to me to-morrow evening, at eight o'clock, and I will make a candid examination of your supposed discoveries; in the mean time take my advice and pre- pare to renounce your delusive dreams." Watson bowed, and with a curious smile upon his coun- tenance he left the great maw's presence, to wait patiently for the promised hearing. He spent the intervening time in a critical review of his statements and demonstrations, anticipated objections and prepared to rebut them, and diligently criticised his written memoir. The appointed hour arrived, and he again presented himself at the am- bassador's hotel. A marked courtesy was now exhibited toward him, and on entering the minister's cabinet he was cordially saluted, and presented to two French gentlemen, whose white locks were no more the witnesses of their age and experience, than were their noble foreheads and expressive features of intellect and genius. 19'   222       HOUSEHOLD TALES. The previous interview with the young man had made a favorable, as well as a marked impression upon the am- bassador, and a careful reperusal of the letters he pre- sented convinced him that he had to do with no superfi- cial character; and thus the more he reflected upon the circumstances the deeper he became interested. He had determined, therefore, not only to hear the young man himself, but to bring to his aid the experience and advice of two distinguished friends, the one a Professor in the Polytechnic School, and the other the President of the National Academy. These were the worthies with whom Watson found himself associated, and a sort of reserve naturally overshadowed him on his presentation to such renowned savants. Their considerate sympathy, howev- er, soon generated in him an ease and confidence, that re- stored him to his usual habitude, and he soon forgot the disparity of their social positions; and after half an hour' of desultory conversation the minister drew attention to the special appointment that had brought them together. "Mr. Watson," said he, ' I have made some investiga- tion regarding the communications you yesterday made to me, and I find you are correct, in a part of your state- ments, at least. The fact is undoubted that such a prize as you mention was proposed by Napoleon; the present citizen King has re-ordained it, and it is still unbestowed. -That you may prove to be as correct in the remainder of your positions I certainly wish; and that neither of us may be misled by partial knowledge of the subject, I have invited these gentlemen, familiar with science, and with the history of every claim heretofore made for the prof-   A WILL AND A WAY.        223  fered reward, who have consented to a preliminary exam- ination of your supposed discoveries. If you can satisfy them, the King shall be moved, and they will aid me in your triumph. If, on the contrary, they are unconvinced, I must be so likewise." Watson expressed himself satisfied with the conditions upon which cooperation was pledged, and at once replied that he neither expected nor desired to approach His Majesty, if he could not satisfy any thorough mathemati- cian of the unerring philosophy that guided his deduc- tions. It was not a question of taste nor of opinion, but of fact; and of fact demonstrable by simple processes, in- variable in results. He then rehearsed a brief notice of each previous attempt to solve the problem, pointing out the several fallacies that had deluded wise men, and de- veloping their inconsistencies; then stating his own for- mulas with exact precision, he produced his diagrams, and demonstrated the truth of his assumptions to the delighted surprise of those who listened. He answered every pos- sible objection to his theory, met every critical test, and convinced his auditors of his complete success. The skepticism of the minister and his learned friends gave way to willing admiration, and they became enthu- siastic in his behalf. They began immediately to plan for a public exposition of his results, and before they sepa- rated the details were all arranged, waiting only a pre- sentation to the King, and the royal sanction, to complete the programme. Within a day or two after the young artisan was presented at court, the King was informed of his pretensions, and with the enlightened generosity that   224      HOUSEHOLD TALES. ever characterized the French people in all matters per- taining to science, he instituted proceedings to test the merits of the discovery claimed. ,At length the day of trial came. His Majesty honored the young republican with his sympathy, designated the Board of Judges, and was himself an auditor at the ex- position. A vast hall of the Academy was thronged with spectators, embracing the learned men of France, the no- bles, ambassadors from every kingdom of Europe, titled Lords and Princes of the realm, while the fair beauty of the court gave superior-splendor to the throng. A tem- porary throne upon an elevated platform was occupied by the King and Queen, while at their right, a little in front, were stationed the Judges. Opposite to these, on the left of their Majesties, His Excellency the American minister sat beside the bold young philosopher, who silently waited the moment of-trial. All eyes were centered upon him, and it was a striking scene that thus exhibited the ranks of lordly Europe, in the pride of wealth and power, gath- ered to render homage to the intellectual pre-eminence of a child of poverty, worthier than all the pomp and pag- eantry of political power. At a given signal the chairman of the Judges arose to announce the purpose of the gathering; he spoke of Na- polear.'s act and of the several contests that had arisen in the days of the Empire, for the distinguishing honor of bearing away the prize, which would not only place a re- v nown upon the name of the victor, but endow- him with wealth beside. He eulogized the reigning sovereign for adopting the wise suggestions of his predecessors upon   A WILL AND A WAY.       225 the throne, and commented upon the illustrious occasion that exhibited to the world the extraordinary spectacle of a powerful monarch deigning to listen to' the claims of a stranger, lfrom a foreign government, upon generosities tendered to-the intellectual world. With deep emotion the young man advanced to the foot of the throne, and saluted the King amid the hush of pro- found attention. He thanked the sovereign for his far- seeing policy in cherishing science, and with the conscious independence of a true manhood, portrayed the superior glory of scientific, over martial, triumphs. As his first words were articulated, a tremulous voice and pale coun- tenance betrayed some timidity, but as he became familiar with the surroundings, and in sympathy with the audience to whom he partly faced, his theme inspired him, and con- fidence was established, while the elegant Parisians heard an American plebeian teach his elders, in the rich round tones of a pure diction that fitly interpreted a natural elo- quence, inspired by natural truth. He stated his points with a clearness almost amounting to simplicity, and de- monstrated his problems with surprising perspicuity, car- rying conviction to the multitude, who hailed him, as he resumed his seat, with waving of handkerchiefs and pro- longed acclamations, that rose swelling in a torrent of joy. Never was a more signal triumph, and never did royal re- ward meet a more worthy recipient. The Judges unanimously accorded the prize, which was bestowed in that vast presence, by the hand of Louis Philippe himself, with words of hearty congratulation, while the Queen honored him with tokens of favorable   226       HOUSEHOLD TALES. appreciation. Courtesy succeeded courtesy, and distin- guished attentions awaited him continually, filling the few weeks he remained at Paris with refined and intellectual pleasures. From thence he took his departure for the court of St. James, where similar scenes were passed, and similar honors bestowed. At length, crowned with honor and successful in all he had undertaken, he was ready to return to his native land, and the day approached for his departure. But his destiny was for a wider sphere, and a more commanding influence. There had been present at the demonstration in Paris a nobleman from the Russian court, who was particularly attracted by the promising intellect and brilliant success of the young genius. He lost no time in communicating to his sovereign an elaborate account of the American, whose practical talents seemed to be suited to employment upon some of the public works the emperor was extend- ing throughout his domains. Nicholas at once apprecia- ted the value of such an acquisition, and hastily com- missioned the ambassador to negotiate with the American upon his own terms. Just on the eve of embarkation he received proposals to repair to St. Petersburg, and the post offered was at once so honorable and so lucrative, he yielded to the advice of those about him, and repaired to the service of the Muscovite, where he spent three years in practical and scientific duties, amassing wealth, and es- tablishing a fame co-extensive with the noblest monuments of internal improvement, that so signalized the reign of the Czar. lBut there were attractions about his native land that wealth and honor could not compensate, and af-   A WILL AND A WAY.        227 ter a brilliant career he sailed for America, rich in the fa- vor of princes, and crowned with the friendship of great and good men. Woodend Cottage was destined once more to smile in rural beauty, and echo with the melody of domestic joy. The successes of his foreign enterprises had given the du- tiful son abundant means to purchase the humble home of his childhood, and his first act upon reaching the land of his birth, was to honor his father's memory by liquidating every debt that misfortune had entailed, and securing the title deeds to the dearest spot on earth. The dilapidated fences were renewed, the hedges restored to their pristine beauty, the pastures filled with cattle, the cottage walls were renovated, and even the neglected smithy was made to assume the livery of thrifty industry that it used to wear when stalwart John Watson labored to the- music of his own happy heart, in fond devotion to his blooming Esther and her darling boy. There was so much of the old air looking out from the cheery windows, and breathing from borders of pinks and creeping columbines, that it seemed as if, the spirits of the departed dwelt in gladsomeness in every sunny nook. In a land where character is. the only title to nobility, no origin is a bar to success. This truth leads to the con- summation of conjugal union, oftentimes, with those who hold true affinities, each for the other, when in other con- ditions of society true hearts would have been separated by caste, or been cursed with the prejudices of ill-assorted marriage. False views of human greatness poison the fountain of love, and either retard or prevent the highest   228       HOUSEHOLD TALES. development of the race. But in happy New England the fairest daughter of the proudest family justly esteems herself proudly distinguished, when a self-made man of genius honors her with his preference. It was, therefore, an occasion of sincere congratulation, and of happy au- gury, when the faithful pauper apprentice won the heart of Mary Newton, and led the daughter of his benefactor to the altar, where marriage benedictions crowned the pride of station, and the glory of achievement, with co-equal blessings. It was a happy day at Woodend when the young couple went to reside in its quiet retreats. The bees seemed to hum with redoubled industry, the lowing of the king sounded more pleasant, and the brook gurgled and danced and laughed, more joyously than ever; and surely there never had been such beautiful flowers there, for every village maiden came with laden fragrance, to greet the re- turning orphan and his happy bride.   MARRIED FOR A DINNER. THE ancient saying is no heresy: Hanging and wiving go by destiny. MERCHANT OF VENICE. "ATE on a -midsummer's evening, a few years since, a young Parisian artist who began to gather some laurels in his profession, entered his lodging, threw himself upon a chair, and fell into a deep revery. He was wearied with application to his pursuits, and feeling the necessity of rec- reation, he was revolvingthe best method of securing it so as to fill his sketch book at the same time. At length he suddenly arose, commenced to disrobe himself for r e- tirement, while he thus soliloquized:- "Yes,--yes, that is what I 'll do! After a sound sleep I will take the early diligence for Lyons, and unknown to any of my friends start on a tour of observation. I may meet with merry adventures by traveling incognito, and after seeing something of France, I shall return with my head filled with beautiful thoughts!" Accordingly he extinguished his taper, :flung himself upon his bed, and was soon in a profound slumber. His alarm clock roused him before day-break the next morn- 20   230      HOUSEHOLD TALES. ing, and hastily preparing himself for his departure, he quietly descended to the street with his portmanteau in his hand, and in a short time, upon the top of a diligence, he left Paris behind him. The gray twilight of early morning yielded to the golden flushes of day, the day in turn rolled on past noon, and the sun's rays glowed from the western horizon, when after a weary and incessant progress he entered the town of Chalons-sur-Saone, jaded and hungry. The young man was the first to seat himself at the ta- ble, as the passengers were left at a spacious hotel, where the whole party were to be regaled by a sumptuous sup- per of substantial meats and delicate entrees. The artist had a keen appetite from his long fast, and he now found it doubly provoked by the steaming savor of the food be- fore him, from which he began to transfer luscious mor- sels to his own plate, more thoughtful of satisfying hunger than of regarding etiquette or ceremony. He was just about to appropriate to his own gratification the yet un- tasted food, which his stomach ravenously craved, when his attention was suddenly arrested by a voice behind him as some one inquired, - "Is there not here a passenger from Paris, by the name of Bremond?" Startled at hearing his name pronounced in a place to which he was a total stranger, the young Parisian arose, and turning to see who had propounded the question, he saw a little groom, dressed in blue livery, standing in the doorway. Looking about upon his traveling companions to see if there were another Bremond among them, who   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.      231 might more pertinently respond to the lackey, and observ- ing no movement, he said to the inquirer,-- "It appears that there is no other Bremond than myself present; is it I that you-are in search of, my friend?" "It is a Monsieur Bremond arrived this evening from Paris, by the early diligence," said the groom, surveying the negligent traveling dress of the other. "In Lafitte and Caillard's line?" queried the artist. "Without a doubt!" responded the boy. "In that case I can not deny my own identity; but I beg to know what you wish of me. I declare to you at the outset, that although there may be twelve thousand in- habitants in this good city of Chalons-sur-Saone I do not know a single person in it, nor do I believe any person knows me!" "I know all that, very well," replied the groom with a respectful smile, " and it is on that very account that I am sent for you!" "You are sent for me!"repeated Bremond in astonish- ment, " and who then may have commissioned you, face- tious groom, if you please?" "I am directed only to speak to you alone," said the servant in a low tone, " and if you will take the trouble to follow me to a retired place I will explain." "Ah ha!" said Bremond, moving to the door, " this is, perhaps, a very pretty joke, to prevent my taking a too hasty supper! Gentlemen," added he, turning to his com- panions, " if one of you is the author of this mystifica- tion, I challenge you, in the name of a stomach most wor- thy of compassion, to avow the purpose here at the table,   232       HOUSEHOLD TALES, and leave me to put to use the little half hour that remains before starting, for I assure you my digestive organs are in open rebellion, for want of supplies!" Every person present responded to this comic summons by a solemn assurance of being innocent of any complic- ity in the affair. Bremond wished to see the heart of so inexplicable an adventure, and led by curiosity he forced a delay upon his appetite, while he followed the groom, after beseeching the travelers to reserve him a fair pro- portion of each dish, promising to return immediately and give the solution of the enigma. The groom, who heard both the prayer and the promise, smiled with an air of in- telligence, not a little comic, and as soon as he was alone with the Parisian, he said, - "Bremond wished to laugh at the expense of those gen- tlemen; for he knows very well that he will not take any food to-night at the hotel of Chevreuil!" "I know very well," quickly answered Bremond, whose appetite was rekindled by these words, " that I will not go with you one step farther! We are alone, as you de- sired; explain yourself, and that in a hurry. But bear in mind if you have had the misfortune to be intrusted with an impertinent commission, I can at least wait my supper long enough to chastise you!" The groom-bowed with mock resignation, but still kept onward, in silence. Stop!" said his follower, " it is enough that I have al- ready lost my place of carver! Deliver your message, and let me return before the meats are cold; otherwise I pay your blunder on the spot!"   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.    I  233 "I see well," replied the groom, with the same imper- turbable smile, "that you are disposed to be gay. You do not, of course, expect to pass any more time at Cha- lons, nor do I think you will regret leaving the poor sup- per of a public house for the magnificent repast that awaits you at the chateau." This last phrase, no less incomprehensible than the re- mainder of the young groom's conversation, had yet a far pleasanter sound than any words he had yet uttered, and served not a little to calm the Parisian's irritation s He inquired with some gentleness, therefore, - ( You conduct me, then, to dine at the chateau of your master?" ' The gentleman should rather say at the chateau of my mistress," replied the messenger. "A woman! -a magnificent dinner!- a chateau over night!-what mysterious freak is Fortune playing me now!" thought Bremond. "Still," repeated he to him- self, as he brushed the dust from his blouse, " there is no very alarming appearance, yet, and the adventure begins to take a very piquant turn. But let me be sure there is no other person than myself expected, before I submit to the danger of a feminine repulse, with the loss of my din- ner -included!" Turning, then, to the groom, he addressed him with a sincere tone, as he really felt that there must be some sin- gular error on his part. "My little friend," said he, " there is something pecu- liar in this affair, and you must give me more definite in- formation about it. Are you sure that it is to me, Anat- 20 -   234       HOUSEHOLD TALES. ole Bremond, seven rue Saint-Georges, Paris, painter of landscapes, that your mistress sends this courteous sum- mons? Have you made no mistake?" "Yes, oh yes, it is to you, without doubt! Here is a note from her which will confirm my message, and more than that I am not at liberty to communicate!" Bremond very promptly took a little billet which the groom handed him; the superscription simply bore the name of 'Bremond,' and the delicate writing was com- pletely unknown to the young man. He hastily broke the seal, impatient to read the mysterious missive, as well as to learn the signature of, the writer; but as if to envel- ope the mystery in deeper obscurity, the letter was anon- ymous, bearing only the words following:- "M. Bremond is awaited with the greatest impatience. He is besought to follow, without delay, the person who will hand him this billet. He can count upon his integ- rity and discretion, and he has been instructed to use all possible haste to return to the chateau." It would have become neither a Parisian nor a painter to have turned aside from a romance that began to open so interestingly, and that kept the sequel so adroitly con- cealed. Bremond was of too imaginative a turn to let it escape him, especially as it proposed one of the Imerry ad- ventures' that he had wished for in undertaking his tour. Forgetting entirely, therefore, the hotel of Chevreuil, as well as the diligence of Lafitte and Caillard, he called out to the discreet lackey, -   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.       235 "Lead on, Mercury, and bring us to the feast of the unknown goddess!" "It is but a few steps to the cabriolet," said the groom, as he turned toward the river. "So much the better," replied the artist, '" for I am lit- erally dying of curiosity, - and hunger!" A few moments brought them to a handsome carriage, standing at the angle of a 'cross street where a spirited horse seemed fretting in impatience to lesson the distance between himself and his stable. It was an elegant turn- out, and spoke well for the equine tastes of its fair own- er. The groom opened the door of the vehicle, and mo- tioning to Bremond, he said,- "Here we are, all right! Get in, if you please, and a pleasant drive may whetten your appetite!" The hungry artist experienced a new pang at this ma- licious reminder of his suffering, and with a sinister coun- tenance, he seated himself upon the soft cushions, while the ever smiling lackey leaped to his seat, and lashing his horse they were speedily whirled over the streets, out to the country, and along the banks of the river. Bremond relapsed into silence, for the incomplete and enigmatical responses of the driver were far from satisfactory, and he resigned himself to wait for the explanation to this roman- tic episode of travel. "Parblue!" said he to himself, as he flew along, " this a little resembles a prologue to a farce. I am, in my ap- pearance, not unlike captain Baridon, taking himself in a cabriolet to the mysterious rendezvous of madame Mar- guerite de Bourgoyne. Nevertheless, I am in for it! I   HOUSEHOLD TALES. shall, at all events, have a good story to tell to my friends and associates, whatever may turn up; at least if I am destined to perform comedy rather than tragedy! But what if I should be doomed, after a most agreeable night, to be murdered, sewed up in a sack, and thrown into the floods of the Saone!" These thoughts ran through his mind by very natural transitions, and he endeavored to imagine the probable solution of the singular net-work of circumstances which had involved him. "I am very positive," he soliloquized, " I know no one resident in Chalons or its environs; I have never even so much as passed through the place. There is, however, a bare possibility that some one of my friends may have come to reside here, without my knowledge; but then it can not be that they are informed of my journey, and of my arrival here, for I left Paris suddenly, by a mere freak, and without determining upon this route till after I left my room. Not a comrade of the studio, even, knows of my flight from Paris, for I did not intend to communicate with any of them till I reached Marseilles." The young artist sat in perplexing endeavor to solve the riddle for several minutes, with his hand, pressed to his forehead, and an expression of doubt upon his coun- tenance. At length his eye brightened, and with a smile he exclaimed,-- "I have it! I'11 lay a Wager I have guessed the rid- dle; my cousins Charlabert and Cormieu are at the bot- tom of the affair. They are at home for the school holi- days, and this sublime inspiration comes from my uncle's   237   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.   in the environs of Lyons. It is all clear now; a little im- provisation; a groom, discreet and adroit; a mysterious billet; a silent ride in a cabriolet; dropping me unex- pectedly at the chateau; welcoming me with shouts of laughter; a repast with the family; and an evening of fun! There is n't much pith to the joke, after all!" In mentally terminating this supposed plot, Bremond was forgetful that his relatives in the suburbs of Lyons could know no more of his movements than the inhabi- tants of Chalons; but people in perplexity often come to very inconsistent conclusions, and it is not remarkable, therefore, that he thought he had discovered the clue by which to catch the groom in categorical responses. Ac- cordingly he directed a question to the little player:- "Little lackey, you belong to Charlabert, I think?" "Please you, no, sir ! "answered the groom. " Oh! well, then, to mademoiselle Cormieu ?" "I know no person of either name!" responded the la- conic lackey, as he whipped' his horse into renewed speed. Bremond, thus finding his theories put to rout, folded his arms and abandoned his hypothetical solutions. For about three quarters of an hour they traveled in silence, when the horse suddenly drew up at a little green gate, opening into a fine park. An old female servant immedi- ately opened it from within, welcomed their arrival, and announced to Bremond that the ladies began to despair of his presence, and were suffering extreme disquietude, for they had learned that the early diligence from Paris to Lyons had turned toward the environs at Beaume. "My dear girl," said the hungry artist, "have the la- 238       HOUSEHOLD TALES. dies, in despair at my non-arrival, seated themselves at the supper-table?" "Oh, no, sir! They would have no appetite without you!" she replied, laughing. "Ah, well, my lovely waiting woman," said he, "Ipray you conduct me to them, quickly. I long to make their acquaintance, to present my adorations, and to-partake of the feast!" The servant led him into the park, and threading about a labyrinth of little alleys, came to the retired entrance of a  country house of commanding appearance. He re- marked, with pleasure, that the ground windows were all brilliantly illuminated, and concluding that some of them opened from the dining-hall, he counted upon a speedy in- troduction to the delicacies he promised himself. "I beg your pardon," said the servant, " for entering the house through the kitchen; but I think you would not wish to meet the assembled guests in the negligent and dusty garb of a traveler?" "It is no matter how I get in!" replied Bremond, mak- ing a rapid, but satisfactory survey of the blazing fur- naces, the well-laden spits, and the savory preparations of the culinary art about him. "( Make no noise, if you please," continued the servant as she opened a  door of the apartment; " here we are on a private stairway, which conducts to your chamber. It is not lighted --take care - hold on by the railing and follow me. Here we are-walk in! You look fatigued by your hasty journey; sit down and rest on the lounge while I notify madame of your arrival."   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.      239 The servant disappeared, and the spirit of Bremond wrought itself into a whirlwind of struggling suppositions during the little while he waited. "It is clear," thought he, " that there is a gross blunder on the part of the groom and the servant; they have mis- taken me for some one else! When the lady of the es- tablishment meets me, and discovers a stranger, what a 'scene for a painter!' She will scream in affright, over- whelm me with maledictions, bring the crowd of guests to her succor, and either drive me out ignominiously, or have me arrested as a house-thief in disguise. The adventure is really assuming a tragic air! Apparently 'the splendid repast' seems only destined to regale my olfactory nerves, as did that of Chevreuil, and in that case there will be a death for this house to answer for, for I shall perish with hunger-! However, I shall not expire till I have avenged myself upon the blundering groom, who has hurried me, headlong, into this frightful dilemma! After all, my best way is to retreat as I came, and use what discretion there is left to me." So saying he glided to the door and was about to rush out, when to his utter consternation, it flew open, the ser- vant met him, and placing a flambeau upon the table said to him in a low tone, - "Do n't be impatient - here is madame!" At the same moment there appeared a matron of about -fifty years, of a prepossessing and distinguished figure. She dismissed the servant, who bolted the private door as she retreated, and advancing to the young Parisian, the mistress of the chateau saluted him with a smile, her en-   240       H HOUSEHOLD TALES. tire bearing displaying politeness and affability. Bre- mond regulated his own conduct in accordance with this amicable reception, returning abundant salutations df the same kind. "The mystery increases!" thought the artist. "She ap- pears to know me, and yet for my life, I can not remem- ber her. Now for the explanation of my -ride along the banks of the river." 'Ah, my child :!" said the dame, " we have waited for you in death-like anxiety! It appears, as we feared, that Leopold could not accompany you ; but you are here, and that is the essential thing. How many thanks and obli- gations we owe you!" "Do not mention it, madame, until we understand each other better!" replied Bremond, who feared a compro- mise of his honor. "Yes, I must insist upon it," responded the matron, in -a tone- of great- earnestness; "if there had not been an intimate of my son, :a friend whom he had known from in- fancy, a college intimate for whom he could answer as for himself, we could not have found an accomplice to our in- nocent and ingenious plot. But the eulogy which we re- -ceived of -you yesterday, in a letter announcing your hasty departure from Paris this morning, has completely satis- fied us. No, I am so gratified with your appearance that - am sure we shall not repent confiding in you more than in all the world beside; and for ourselves, although you may not now appreciate fully the imperious motives that have forced us to hasten this affair, yet I must say that I do not think you will ever repent confiding in us." ,z,5 , *   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.      241 I( Ijeed no arguments to convince me of that, madame, but burn for information that I am not possessed of. I pledge my hearty cooperation in your ingenious schemes, but I pray to be farther enlightened!" continued Bremond earnestly, for his curiosity was raised to the highest pitch by the blunder so obstinately persisted in by every one, in spite of his desire to stop it. "'A la bonne heure,'" responded the lady; c" but time presses, and you have been delayed. All the guests are assembled in the hall, and we have neglected nothing. I doubt not, on your part, you went through with all neces- sary formalities at Paris. But you are in your traveling dress, and in your precipitation have left your valise at Chalons, I suppose!" continued the voluble woman, as she surveyed his stature scrutinizingly. "I certainly left my portmanteau at the hotel of Chev- reuil," answered the artist with a little confusion, as he observed that his dusty blouse and careless gaiters did not meet with favor.   "Never mind, --do not disturb yourself, for I see the way clear. You will find the wardrobe of Leopold in the cabinet, and you are just about his. size and form; you may be a trifle larger than he, but never mind, his cloth- ing will fit you to a charm! Help yourself to everything you need, and dress speedily. In fifteen minutes the com-, mander, my brother, will come to conduct you to the as- sembly, and introduce you to the family friends. In the interval," continued the lady, "I wait with the greatest \ impatience, to meet again my dear Bremond, of whom I have thought continually for eight days!" 21   :242      HOUSEHOLD TALES. -With this' warm assurance she departed, leaving the in- voluntary guest in the most complete astonishment. The pertinacity of the mistress was more surprising than that of the servants, and every one seemed- determined to con- tinue in some singular error, which was unfathomable, to the subject of it, even. "Heigho!" said Anatole, " if this is not sublime! I must allow the old lady is ravishing, and has played her part to perfection, and wishes me to dress in character for mine! I wish I could fathom her implied confidence, and render it slightly intelligible, for I can not compre- hend her gibberish. Stay, though, I do unravel this one thread of her discourse, to wit:--her brother, an old com- mander, is coming in a quarter of an hour, to lead me to the supper table; she has an absent son, Leopold, about my size; and thinking my dress not quite recherche for a dinner party of her friends, she invites and urges me to appropriate his. Well, well, that is n't inhospitable, and since it is the condition of feasting, let us don the vest- ments of the dear Leopold, my 'intimate friend,' but nev- er yet seen! His mother said in the cabinet,--haste we to examine. Approaching the cabinet he turned the key and open- ing the door he found every article of a gentleman's ap- parel displayed before him, with every needed variety of cosmetical preparations, which he thus catalogued, as he hastily glanced over them:-- "Upon my word, Leopold is a gentleman of discrimina- ting taste, and must have intended these for an artist's eye! Here they are, brushes, essences, soaps, pomade,   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.       243 dentifrice, perfumery, napkins, undershirts, linen of vir- gin whiteness and extreme finish, pantaloons, vest, and a coat after the ton, cravat, hose, pumps, and white kids in abundance. But where shall I begin?-Evidently the lady is fastidious, and lest I offend by too little effort, I will start from the 'foundation, and adorn, with these new materials, this intellectual temple--man!" With this conclusion he began his toilet, and was soon transformed into an elegant Parisian lion; and in good faith he made a fine appearance. Nature had given him a perfect form, and crowned it with a handsome counte- nance, so that the decorations of art finished the tout en- semble, and showed a figure well worthy of playing the romantic part that had now been assigned him. He con- templated himself in the mirror with no little foppery in the glance, and as he drew immeasurably tight the buckle upon his waisthand, the better to silence the impatient murmurs of his stomach, he heard, immediately behind him, a deep bass voice, familiarly saying,- "Ah, well, my dear Bremond, you are ready!" It was the commander, a tall, lean old man, with a lofy carriage, wearing a flaxen wig, and displaying an orna- ment of St. Louis. Anatole turned to salute him, not at all certain of the effect a view-of his features might produce upon this new personage; the old -gentleman ex- hibited no surprise, but with an unaccountably familiar air he examined him from head to feelwith great appa- rent satisfaction. "Well, well!" said the old fellow, "I perceive that we have not been deceived. You are, in all sincerity, a very   244       HOUSEHOLD TALES. beautiful boy! I see that nothing has failed us in this singular affair, and situated as we now are, I shall make no stranger of you, although I meet you for the first time. I am: to introduce and present you,- and I trust you have forgotten nothing of the directions given 'you?  "Upon that point you may rest satisfied, for my appe- tite is too keen for the treat that awaits me! I remember every word, and long to test the feast practically!" "I dare say! said the commander, laughing, and giv- ing an interpretation to Bremond's words very different from that intended; "young blood whets the senses, and I believe 'the feast,' as you call it, is well worth the envy of an epicure! My niece, Leonie, is a lovely girl,--do not forget the name - and we have feigned that you knew her last winter in Paris, when she visited at madame de Morty's, with her mother. It has seemed essential to do this, in order to throw dust in the world's eyes, as well as to keep up appearances with the patrons of cousin Ursule, through whose fantastic notions we are forced into what may seem indelicate haste. You understand me?  "Partially, I think," replied Bremond, whose suspicion of something more than a feast began to take form ; but I fear there has been an error "- "Do n't think of it!" interrupted the commander, "1 we know what we are doing, and Leopold has given us such reason to esteem you, that we may well say the gods smile upon us!" - andtaking the artistes arm he drew him out of the room toward the hall. ' Sir, you deceive yourself, - Leopold does not know me!" insisted the Parisian.   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.      245' "My dear Bremond, I love to see modesty in a young man, but I am satisfied from my own observation that he has not spoken too highly of you, and you. have no need to underrate yourself. But now's the moment, -we are to make our entrance!" Bremond felt himself a victim to perverse fatality at this important moment, and was inclined to retreat precip- itately; but a lively curiosity to learn a little more of the enigma, and more than all --for it must be spoken - the raging hunger that tormented him, suggested that a delay of half an hour, till supper was over, could do no harm, and so he allowed the commander to proceed with him. They immediately descended a vast staircase, brilliantly illuminated, and by an open door in the vestibule, they en. tered a rich saloon, where Anatole was ushered into an assembly that impatiently awaited him. His entrance produced a lively sensation in every part of the room. "Ladies and gentlemen, our near relatives all," said the commander, in his deepest bass, "I have the honor to present to you Anatole Bremond, the future husband of my niece, Leonie de Cernay!" Bremond was thunder-struck at these words, and turned deadly pale; his head swam, his limbs trembled, and; he made an effort to fall behind. But the commander, who still held him by the arm, maintained his equilibrium, and whispered to him with much emphasis,- "( For heaven's sake restrain your emotions! Keep up your coolness and presence of mind!" The young artist immediately recovered himself, and accompanied by the commander, he pgrossed the saloon to 21 X   ?246      HOUSEHOLD TALES. salute madame de Cernay; whom he had so recently seen in the dressing room. Beside her stood a charming blonde of sixteen summers, beautiful and radiant as a cloud over the bursting sunrise, and her confusion, revealing itself in tumultuous blushes, betrayed to the delighted gaze of the, artist mademoiselle Leonie. The vision of the fair ,girl inspired him with sufficient gallantry to make him agreeable to both mother and daughter, and after uttering such compliments upon the occasion as the commander whispered to him, Anatole was soon surrounded by the more distant relatives of the family, who showed him the most extravagant marks of afmity and friendship. But the adventure had taken too serious a turn, to al- low a man of honor to prolong the error another moment. by his silence, and Bremond determined to end it by an immediate. eclaircissement. For this purpose, as soon as possible, he drew the commander aside, and left the glad throng to themselves. But the garrulous old fellow of the flaxen wig was so overjoyed at the success of the fam- ily manceuvering that he allowed the young man no op- portunity to accomplish his honest purpose. "My dear Bremond," said the old gentleman; as they stepped out upon the balcony, where no person could lis- ten to them, your arrival is the most opportune, both for my niece and yourself. A single day later, and all would have been lost. Judge with what anxiety we have watched for you! When we learned that the diligence had left the main route my sister and myself were ready -to die of anxiety and vexation. Had you been in that carriage it would have cost Leonie a fortune of more   247 MARRIED FOR A DIER.        247 than jfve hundred thousand francs! Imagine, then, the interest we took pn your coming." "Good heavens!" said Anatole, whose ears were filled with the silver sound of such high figures. "Yes my dear fellow," continued the commander, " an inheritance of more than five hundred thousand francs;- and the will of our cousin Ursule takes effect to-mor- row, at midday." "Indeed!" said Bremond, "but I can not conceive how I can have anything to do with the affair. You are evi- dently counting upon a wrong conclusion." "'A wrong conclusion!'" ejaculated the old man tes- tily, " by no means! Leopold ought to have explained to you the fantastical clause in the will of cousin Ursule. It is singular he omitted it!" "My dear sir," said the Parisian, " you must not blame your nephew too soon; the truth is Leopold has not seen mle "'Long enough to give you particulars,' you wouldtell me," curtly interrupted the military veteran. "Well, I must atone for his neglect, and acquaint youwith the en- tire affair. You must know, then, that our cousin Ursule in dying a year since, left an immense fortune disposed of by will. This testament was left in the custody of the notary royal, with the strictest injunction that it should be only opened and read at high twelve, just one year and a day from the date of her decease. Her relatives have supposed the property would be fairly distributed, until eight days since, when a malicious old servant, to whom she confided all her thoughts, thinking it too late for us to   248      nOU$EHOLD TALES. profit by the absurd conditions, apprised us that a univer- sal legacy existed in favor of my niece Leonie, upon the express stipulation that she should marry during the twen- ty-four hours next preceding the reading of the will; in default of which, the entire property of the deceased is bestowed upon an ecclesiastical establishment. This in- formation came upon us like a thunder-bolt; Leonie had no suitor, and where could we find, in so short a time, a companion suitable to the dear girl. We despaired of ef- fecting it, and resigned ourselves to suffer so brilliant a fortune to slip through our fingers, when by right it ought to endow the dutiful child. Suddenly your friend Leo- pold cried out, - 'We shall save it,-Leonie will be married in eight days!" "At first we took this exclamation as an exhibition of folly; but as he unfolded his thought, spoke of you with so much enthusiasm, drawing so attractive a portrait of you, and depicting in such eloquent terms the fraternal re- lations that. existed between you at college, that we con- cluded, after all, that my niece would be both rich and happy. You -know the rest; Leopold set out for Paris instanter, sought and found you, offered you the hand of his-sister, which you are here to accept, and in a short time you will be the husband of as beautiful and virtu- ous a girl, as France affords, and my nephew as well, to say nothing of the money-bags, Madame Cernay, Leo- nie, Leopold and ourselves, are alone in the secret of this impromptu marriage, for we have affirmed that you knew  my niece at Paris, and had for some time solicited her ,          ; ,  ,   AVMA.,LFI L AU A--  hand. It was to sustain this innocent fiction, that my sis- ter and Leonie feigned acquaintance with you when you were presented to them in the saloon; and so you compre- hend the whole affair." At the very instant the commander finished his recital the artist, with heroic honesty, determined to avow to him that he was not the Bremond they looked for; but there was a brisk movement in the saloon, and madame ap- peared at the window, impatiently beckoning them to re- enter, and the old man promptly obeyed. "Courage, my young friend, courage!" said he," give your arm to your lady." The hungry traveler felt positive that he was at length in the way to the supper-table, and it was *terefore easy to quiet his conscience for a delay sufficient for the des- sert to appear. "Whenever I explain," said he to himself, "consterna- tion and trouble will be sure to follow, scandal will spread among the guests, and the despairing family, sunk in the twofold mortification, of being'detected in the stratagem, and of failing in their purpose, -will of course forget the dinner, and I shall starve in consequence. Wisdom tells me to wait till after the feast, and it will be a kindness to the ladies to save them from disgrace as long as possible. Unwelcome news is best delayed." With this reflection he gave his arm to the beautiful Leonie, who gracefully leaned upon him, but with some trepidation, while smiles of. modest joy beamed upon her countenance. The sensibilities of the artist were keenly excited, and very tender sentiments possessed him as the  ', I   250 H250 OUSEHOLD TALES. crowd, moved forward,-- not to the dinner table, but to thie chapel of the cateau! - This edifice was brilliantly illuminated and decorated with garlands of evergreen and festoons of flowers in varied profusion, while a canopy of F:se-colored silk was elegantly, draped and festooned in -the center beneath whic weretwo cushions of crimson velvet, denoting that the espoused were to kneel thereon. The body of the chapel was already occupied by specta- tors and assistants, and the hour had come for the mar- riage ceremony. Anatole Bremond, with a head giddy from an absti- nence of thirty hours, bewildered as he was with the sin- gular events of the evening, fascinated by the superior loveliness o*the yvoung girl that hung so trustingly upon his arm, and inspired by a natural craving for the splen- did fortune, - which, thanks to the absence of the verita- ble pretender, was now within his grasp,--tempted also by the love of adventure, that 'familiar spirit' of artists, was upon the point of yielding to the accumulated seduc- tions, and-take upon himself the vows of matrimony.  He hesitated, moved forward, led the blushing bride even to the nuptial canopy, saw the ravishing beauty kneel upon the cushion, and kneeling beside her The Conscience of an honest man revolted at the decep. tion, and he started up, in his turn pale and trembling, as if by sudden illness. He turned to the commander, spoke in a  whisper to the Startled old man, ". Withdraw with me, I am slightly aflicted with verti- go, and must have air!"  The pallor of the young man frightened the veteran, i ,   /   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.      251 who hastily withdrew with him, -stepping into an alley in the rear of the chapel. In a tone of great alarm he cried out to Bremond,-      - "For heaven's sake, what is the matter?" "We have all been duped, and I can go no farther!" said Bremond, in a sepulchral voice. "What;--what say you?" groaned the commander, as a deadly pallor overspread his countenance. "Poor old man!" said the other, "I am innocent of an intentional deception, but I am not the person you have supposed me to be 1" The commander gasped in agony, and with difficulty he articulated, - . "You are not, then, Anatole Bremond?" "Yes I am, but it is not he that you have expected!" The old gentleman sallied back upon a mound of earth that happened opportunely to be behind him, and as the circumstanceds utterly confused him, he cried in a voice of stifling emotion,- "For pity's sake, Bremond, unravel this riddle, before I die of suspense!" The young painter rapidly recounted, in a most artless and sympathetic manner, by what mistake he had been summoned from the table of Chevreuil, driven to the en- virons, ushered into the chateau, forced to change his ap- parel, as he supposed for a dinner-party, and the steps by which he had been led on, till he discovered the terrible error at the moment of his introduction into- the saloon. He frankly avowed his sole motive for a delay in:revealing his jdenty, after that moment,- his great hunger -and   252       HOUSEHOLD TALES; detailed his consternation in finding himself ushered into the chapel, instead of into the dining-hall, as he had confi- dently expected.             -    / Ah, Bremond, Bremond!" cried the desolate old com- mander, ' what shall we do!-where shall we fly! My dear niece is ruined-- her reputation compromised- her name a token ofjest! Oh, heavens! her mother and my- self have disgraced her, out of our very love to her. I have told a thousand persons that we had known you for a long time, and to-night we have all three asserted -the same thing to all our relatives. How can we meet this falsehood so as to avoid living in ridicule, for all our lives? My sister and my niece will die of chagrin, Bremond,- for there is no escape!" "I hold myself ready to do all I can, with honor, to aid you in this painful dilemma," said the Parisian with a real sympathy for the old man's woe; " to the utmost extent of my ability- I am anxious to help you remedy this fatal er- ror - command me without hesitation." "' Command;you! '" groaned the old soldier, " what can I command you! It is too late; nothing can save us!" A. - t that moment the young groom came rushing from the chapel, and cried out, - "Gentlemen, gentlemen, the priest is at the altar, and waits to solemnize the marriage; everybody wonders at your absence!' 'i' The marriage!9, repeated the broken-hearted old man in desperation, as he groaned anew. "What is to be done?" inquired Anatole; "I will go and take the whole blame upon myself, if you like.'f":   253 MARRIED FOR A DINNER.       253 Yes, yes! answered the commander, his spirits re- animated as a new thought occurred to, him, " you must go, and you alone can save us. It is absolutely necessary that you go to the altar and marry my niece!" "But, my dear sir," interrupted Bremond, not greatly displeased at the lucky thought, "consider that you do not know me"-- I can't consider--there is no time to consider 1' ejac- ulated the commander, fully intent upon his purpose, be, side, although I do notl know you, your candid confession proves you a man of honor, and I shall risk the rest; go, marry my niece, and make her happy, as she will make you rich. But mark you, not one word of this to a liv- ing soul! Let ithe for ever a secret between us!" The two returned promptly to the chapel, the comman- der unusually exhilirated by the reaction of his spirits, while Bremond felt a lively satisfaction at the turn of af- fairs which lighted up his countenance, and spread a glow of beauty upon his fine features that had not been before displayed. The marriage was consummated by the priest in a happy manner, and after familiar and hearty congrat- ulations, the ceremonies were followed by a sumptuous feast, greatly to the delight of the famished bridegroom. Immediately after the close of the festivities, the old commander hastened from the chateau, and with a fleet steed he put himself upon the highway, bent upon pre- venting a meeting of the two Bremonds, who had singu- larly exchanged destinies. He met his nephew Leopold, with the dear friend of college, at a little hotel in Beaume, where they had been detained by the upsetting of the dil- 22   254,     - HOUSEHOLD TALES. igence, and from the time required for repairs it was im- possible to reach the chateau until a day too late. The young men were in a quandary, and Leopold, especially, was raging with excitement, at the mortification he sup- posed the family were all suffering in consequence of the failure of his scheme. The old gentleman met his nephew with much embar- rassment, and upon announcing to him what had occurred, the young brother-in-law seemed, for a while, mad with disappointment and passion. He cursed 'the adventurer' who he said had stolen his sister, swore he would run him through the moment he met him, and wished the soul of cousin Ursule beyond the reach of saintly prayers and solemn masses, for having been the occasion of such mis- fortune. But a hurricane is soon blown past, and this wild storm early spent itself. His uncle was eloquent in por- traying the elegant manners, the honorable bearing, and the accomplished-air of the new Bremond, and at length Leopold Was convinced that the bridegroom could have had no-design in the matter, and that the risk of the new- ly-married was as great upon one side as the other. Re- flection softened his views, and he began to feel that his brother-in-law's arrival at just the right moment, when he was way-wrecked; the coincidence of names; and the ex- act fitting of his own apparel, seemed after all to suggest something singularly providential, and to furnish omens of a happy future. The supplanted young gentleman took the affair as a rich joke, gave utterance to peals of laughter, and seemed delighted with the issue. Subsequent events revealed to me,   MARRIED FOR A DINNER.      255 his friends that a Parisian fairy had already nestled in his heart, and although he was willing to forget her to please his bosom friend, yet he rejoiced at the miscarriage of the scheme, as it left him free to worship at the shrine of his own chosen divinity. He returned, therefore, with abun- dant good wishes for his fortunate namesake, after a hearty pledge to visit them before the honeymoon had passed. On the day succeeding the marriage the will of cousin Ursule was produced by the notary, and while the town clock was striking twelve the seals were broken, and the contents proclaimed. It was as had been presumed; the ridiculous conditions had been met, and the charming lit- tle wife of Anatole Bremond was the Sole legatee of the old lady's vast estate. Two hours later the uncle and brother had reached the village, and entered the chateau; Leopold had concluded that his sister's happiness was at stake, and as the world believed him the college friend of her husband, for her sake he rushed to the arms of his unknown brother when they met, and the harmony thus begun was never broken. Bremond made an excellent husband, and mutual fond- ness brought perpetual blessings. Anatole idolized his wife, ant she adored her-husband, although she often told him jokingly that he 'married for a dinnerl '   STELLA LEA: A LEAF FROM AN ORPHAN'S LIFE.

'" "Yes John, as you have become so captivated, and so keehnly relish what appertains to the fair girl, if you will sit down patiently, and listen without interruption, I will 'deliver this marvel,' and detail just as interesting a little bit of romantic truth as you ever listened to; only do n't you comment till I have ended." "But just tell me, Ned, upon honor, is she really about to be married?" "-  Next week, John, as sure as the sun shines." "Very well, then, I can 'bear it out even to the edge   j  STELLA LEA.         259 of doom!' I :will be as quiet as a lamb, sir; a perfect - Lord of folded arms, The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans. Go on, Ned!" The barister replenished his dying fire, closed the shut- ters of his office, and as the night storm beat against the windows he sat down opposite his inquisitive friend, who had just returned from a brilliant party, and redeemed his promise. ' Ecce signum! ' STELLA LEA is a beautiful creature, and there always has been some peculiar fascination about her, that singu- larly affects every one with whom she associates. You noticed how she captivated the crowd to-night, John, and how every individual about her hung upon her lips, and courted her notice, paying the tribute of -refinement, and gentleness, and love to her, while she was utterly uncon- scious of the unspoken adulation, ever the same innocent, trusting and spiritual being; wherever you meet her. It has always been so, and I can't resist -the belief that there is something angelic about her; nor should I be greatlyi surprised, if she were to unfold wings and soar away to the home of seraphs, for she belongs there, without -con- tradiction. I have known her for ten years, at least, ever since she was a wee bit of a thing, flitting about like a butterfly, with her auburn ringlets floating down over her fair neck, or sometimes fancifully trained with fresh gath- ered flowers, while her eyes sparkled bewitchingly, and the rich tints of health glowed on her countenance. Yet there was -ever absent that abandon of spirits that natu-   260      HOUSEHOLD TALES. rally accompanies -childhood, and a sedate loveliness ever captivated the observer. I never saw her mother, but I have been told by those that knew her, that she was very beautiful, and very ac- complished; the daughter is a sort of illuminated second edition of her, with improvements on the original, as you booksellers would say. She was of English birth, from a good family; and with a heart all openness, in the inexpe- rience of youth she believed everybody to be as guileless- as herself. This gave her great attractiveness, and made her the very opposite of those careful, doubting, suspicious people, who are always as treacherous as they are design- ing.  Still, society is so viciously constituted that such persons are oftenest successful and fortunate, while the truly noble and trusting natures, whose beauties of spirit are transparent, are easily duped, generally deceived, and often ruined., Thus was it with Stella's mother; a military uniform upon a handsome figure dazzled her eyes, a villain's tongue beguiled her heart, a pledge to title and gentility warped her judgment, and her subsequent history may be epitomized in three words; she was won, ruined, and de- serted.  Still, there are evidences that she was privately married, but when she was about to become a mother the heartless scoundrel who had misled her ended his treach- ery by abandoning her, and she became a maniac. At times, however, partial reason resumed its throne, and in one of her lucid intervals she joined a party of old world emigrants, and with that singular secrecy so peculiar to insane people, she fled from the home of her childhood,   STELLA LEA.         261 taking passage in a Liverpool ship that landed her in the British Provinces. It was soon after, that there, amid all the horrors of poverty, want and misery, the beautiful Stella was born, among strangers careless of her fate. The melancholy desolation of the mother so wrought in her that she became a pitiable wreck of her fouer self. With the loss of reason came also physical prostration; and although there ever remained with her some vestiges of personal beauty, yet she exhibited that appearance of haggard desolation that one expects to find among the in- habitants of infamous resorts. But she willingly endured every kind and degree of toil, and unspoken agony, for the sake of the sweet little cherub that nestled in her bo- som, as a redolent blossom sometimes exhales its perfume and unfolds its beauties, where the dying root of a crushed and uprooted plant gathers temporary sustenance from' the unseemly filth-heap'upon which it is cast. There is nothing that a mother's love will not attempt and suffer for her offspring, go long as a single spark of our better nature glows upon the soul's altar. Many are the records, if they could but be truthfully sought out, of flagitiousness and wanton abandonment, that have origin- ated from an ill-judging devotion to children, striving to purchase ease and comfort, or sometimes food to sustain life, at the cost of virtue and purity. It was such a mad motive, doubtless, that induced Stella's mother to accept the forced and repulsive attentions of a man who had first seen her on shipboard, and at length to live with him as his'wife, without any legal recognition of their mutual relations, as- far as is known.   *    262       HOUSEHOLD TALES. This fellow was a mere brute, having nothing in his nature but very beastliness. His name was Floyd, and in person he was tall, muscular, and with the exception of a certain sinister cast of his eye, a very fair man to look at, if one did not closely study his physiognomy; then his expression betrayed the latent knavery that ruled in his thought, and showed him to be a vile compound of pas- sion-and stolidity, with just enough of cunning to keep his basest motives concealed. Still, he understood well how to play upon a woman's nature, and by unwearied perti- nacity he at length accomplished his fiendish end. He feigned the greatest fondness for both mother and child, averted from them some of the evils of destitution by a partial provision for their necessities, and wrought upon the poor woman's shattered intellect, by depicting all the horrors of a lingering starvation if she refused the aid that could be easily purchased by simply uniting her destiny to his own. It must have been in one of her most insane moments that she suffered herself to relent in her disgust of him, and thenceforth;became a thousand times more wretched ,* 9  than before. Floyd understood her state, precisely; and his sole aim in establishing his power over her, was that he might avail himself of her beauty to coin money for his own beastly indulgence: and what he could not effect by persuasion; nor by taunts of her first weakness and betrayal; nor by flings at the lower debasement which he occupied with her, he actually did accomplish by terrific brutality and bloody violence, till the poor maniac sold her decayed charms for the price of infamy.   STELLA LEA.         263 In course of time he brought the poor victim to this city of Boston, and during several months they were in- mates of a miserable hovel in the worst purlieus of me- tropolitan vice. The child was about five years old at this period, and the angelic little being was constantly sur- rounded by the myrmidons of iniquity, in the persons of filthy, debauched hags, and loathsome, profane, .and ob- scene men, who polluted the very atmosphere she inhaled with every breath. She never heard a pure word, nor a chaste thought expressed, nor experienced a kind look from any but her mother, while cleanliness was the ab- normal condition of everything about her. Yet was she a very personification of loveliness-pure, chaste and beautiful as the dew drops of morning, orbed in a rose-bud. She seemed to vegetate in corruption, as some flowers do, that develop beauty and exhale per- fume, just in proportion to the decomposition of putridity that effervesces at their roots. But the miserable mother was dying; she had wasted to a mere shadow, and during any lucid intervals, mental agony and remorse burned in her soul like the internal fires of a volcano, till her physical being was utterly consumed. Stella instinctively perceived her mother's suffering, and was the sole nurse the poor victim had in her dire extremity. In the destitution that surrounded them the child realized the need of delicacies for the invalid that were absolutely essential to prolong life from day to day, and unprompted save by her own heart, she wandered out into the icy streets of winter, to beg appropriate food for the dying sufferer. It would have made your heart   264       HOUSEHOLD TALES. bleed to have heard her simple, artless pleading, and to have seen her large blue eyes sparkling from under their silken lashes, while natural tears gathered and fell when a brutal rebuff wounded her, or cruel suspicion stung her sensitive spirit. The bare, purple bands, as cold as the pavement beneath her, were seldom extended for charity in vain, however, and it was touching to see her tiny yet graceful form flit away, on rapid feet, bearing the charit- able gifts to her dying mother, who wasted away upon a loathsome pallet of straw. One day, as the little ministering spirit returned from such an errand, her mother seemed unusually strong, and exhibited more placidity of spirit than the child had been witness of for many months. There was animation in her features, and her sad eyes were lighted with an un- natural fire, just as the flame of a lamp flashes up in a momentary brilliancy, before it expires. She called the child to her bedside, bade her nestle beside her, and fold- ing her fondly yet feebly to her bosom, she mingled sighs and tears and kisses in the most passionate manner. At length her- strength failed her, and as she became more calm she began to speak in a faint voice, but with singu- lar earnestness. She told the listening babe that she was dying, and should never talk with her again; that she had repented of all her sins, and had been forgiven through the atoning sacrifice of the good Christ, and felt sure she was going to Heaven, where she should sin and suffer no more, but be for ever happy and good. Then she told the child that Floyd was not her father, and exacted a prom- ise that she would escape from that horrid place, trusting   STELLA. LEA.        265 to God to take care of her, and never doing an act that was wrong, no matter how pleasant it seemed. Her voice at length sunk to a whisper, as she spoke of angels float- ing down from the blue sky, where radiant seraphs looked through'the clouds smiling in love, watching and waiting for them to join them, when they would be united in love and be supremely happy for ever - evermore. The lips were still, the whisper ceased, and the sweet nestler in that quiet bosom thought her mother had fallen asleep; long and silently she kept her place, till the hand she clasped grew cold, and the motionless bosom filled her with a shuddering dread. Still, courageously she lifted her head, and putting back the waving hair from her fore- head, she looked fearfully upon the placid face, and then a wail of unfathomable woe rent the air. Her erring com- panion had indeed fallen asleep, and her spirit slumbered ' where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.' The child was all alone! Oh, what a doleful word that is, and how fearfully emphatic it must have seemed to the little, stricken innocent. No food, no home, no friend, no mother! Alone - alone - alone! Think of it, ye who revel in wealth and luxury, with wife, and children, and wild-toned happiness around you, think what it is to be alone, and destitute! Think of it, ye pharisaic lordlings, who boast your Christian walk, and vaunt your penny char- ities, looking coldly and severely upon the-abject children of poverty, and ofttimes crushing out the rising emotions of penitence, and hardening a tender spirit, by chilling frowns, or averted faces, when incommoded by their ap- 23   266      HOUSEHOLD TALES. peals for sympathy! Think of it, ye sons of folly, who riot on the good things God has scattered around you, for nobler uses than to be lavished upon your lusts. Alone, an orphan, and an outcast! These are the secrets of woe, and suffering, and crime, and punishment, the world over, and to make the world better it must be made happier, by deeds of kindly brotherhood, and acts of daily benefi- cence. Think of it, oh ye who fold your garments about you in self-righteous withdrawal from the weak and sin- ful, and let purse-proud wealth, and Christless inaction, and soulless libertinism, form a trinity of reformation, and a league of companionship for earth's desolate ones:- then will the heavenly Jerusalem be built in the world, and God will be in the midst of it. The child was all alone, and when she realized that her dear mother was dead she sobbed as if her heart would break, and she clung to the stiffening corpse, and kissed the rigid lips, moaning like a wounded bird. All the long day she kept her desolate watch of death, and when the darkness came, her over-tasked nature gave way to wea- riness, and she sobbed herself to sleep, in her accustomed place beside the form of her mother. And yet she was not alone, for God was with her; and many an angel eye glistened from the canopy of stars over the roof, as fair forms of happy spirits hovered unseen above that sister sleeper, and watched her there. In the morning a hearse from the alms-house bore away the body of the departed, and the child's agony knew no bounds. She wandered up and down the deserted room, she wrung her hands, she wailed in piteous grief, and the   STELLA LEA.         267 burning hot fire in her brain dried the fountain of tears before they were shed. Then she went and prayed, as her mother had told her, and a singular calm came over her, for she found a new Friend, to whom the prayers of an infant's faith are the most acceptable homage in the universe. Day after day passed, and the lot of the child became more terrible than ever. Floyd had now nothing over which to tyrannize beside the gentle girl, and he seemed to task his brutal faculties to invent means of cruelty; it had not escaped his notice that the little one had success- fully begged alms for her dying mother, and he immedi- ately put the observation to use. He forced her out into the cold, bleak weather, in sun-shine and storm, half-naked as she was, to solicit cast-off clothing, broken meats, mon- ey, or anything else she might gather, that he might find means to gratify his drunken thirst, and lounge in lazi- ness. His sole support, for many weeks, was from the suffering labors of this little mendicant; and woe worth the hour if she returned at night, as she was often forced to do, with an empty basket and a moneyless purse! A scene of savage violence, and brutal cruelty invariably followed, when bloody stripes, and livid bruises left their sickening seal upon an angel's visage for lingering months. This was all in Boston, John, for I tell you sober truth. One day in December, a cold, gusty, winter day, the orphan had wandered all day, and gathered nothing. It had been a day of peculiar trial, for she had found hard usage, and jeers, and wanton insults; from many a rich man's door she had been scornfully repulsed, and she was    268       HOUSEHOLD TALES. weary, disheartened, and painfully hungry. The coId in- creased as night began to settle down upon the city, and her frail garments and clouted shoes had so illy shielded her from the weather that her limbs were benumbed and partially frost-bitten. The rising wind howled bitterly, the clouds had gathered for a storm, and everything gave token of a fearful tempest. But the little beggar did not think of this, for her thoughts were absorbed by her un- laden basket, and she was dreading a worse storm in the den of Floyd, and she sat down on a doorstep that pro- jected upon the sidewalk, and began to cry. The tears rolled off her purple cheeks, and fell frozen in globules upon the pavement, while she bitterly reflected upon her lot. She thought of the cruel blows that were in reserve for her, of the supperless slumber, if the cold would permit her to slumber at all, and of the sole com- panion of the hovel she was to seek. Then came the re- membrance of her dead mother, of the last fond kiss, the final embrace, and the whispers of angels. Her promise to escape from the place came up in her mind, and some- thing seemed to say to her ' Now, suffering one, now is the time!' But where was she to go? She knew but one place from which she would not be driven away, and that was Heaven, where her own dear mother waited to wel- come her, -and that was indeed her own native place! The voices of the angels seemed in the air, the night was a suitable time, and she determined to stay where she was and die. The -snow began to fall, and it would not be a long time, she thought, before it would drift up about her and form a pleasant shroud!   STELLA LEA.        269 Simple innocent! Thou must delay longer yet before thou wilt see Paradise! Through suffering cometh per- fection, and thy Father hath many a good deed for thee to do in His lower vineyard, that none can perform but thou alone! Jhist then a light streamed out of a window from the basement of a dwelling on the opposite side of the street, and as the child looked up, she saw a family about to seat themselves for an evening meal. There were but three persons in the group, a middle aged man and woman, and an elderly female, who might have been the mother of ei- ther of the others. The well-laden table was plainly vis- ible, and the food looked wonderfully inviting, while the steam from the cups of the delicious hot tea curled up in tantalizing wreaths, provoking the appetite of the freezing, famishing child. The warm, bright 'glow of the coals in the grate was reflected in a deeper red upon the ceiling above them, right tempting to the sight of the little crea- ture; still, it made her doubly cold to look at it, and her frame shook, and her chattering teeth alone prevented the tears from freezing upon her cheeks. The thought of a home at that fireside came up and took possession of her soul as she gazed, and the thought grew to resolution, as guardian spirits whispered to her to make one more re- quest for charity. -But she remembered the heartless re- pulses of the day, and was timidly restrained; still the viands smoked, the fire glowed, and the child gazed with irrepressible longings. "Try, try!" said the angels that hovered about her;- "they look kind, and they have enough and to spare; be- 23*   270       HOUSEHOLD TALES. side it is not theirs, but God's, and, He has only loaned it them to use for the happiness of His children. His eter- nal curse will rest upon every son of humanity who re- fuses to succor the destitute and comfort the afflicted, as surely as if they refused it to God himself! The gold is all His, and if they are His children, so are you His child, and they have no right to refuse you a portion. Try, little sufferer, try once more, and give these people oppor-. tunity to do a Christ-like deed!" Thus was her heart inspired, and the sweet child rose from her seat of stone, where she had sat so long that be- numbed and weak, her limbs would hardly bear her form across the -street; still, she buffeted the blustering wind, struggled through the snow, and a moment after her hand was on the bell-knob. Hesitating, she began to doubt and feared to pull; then, summoning a little courage, once more she grasped it, and a feeble sound answered, but it was lost in the howling storm. "It was too gentle, little darling; they have not heard it, - try again." But there she stood and waited, waited, and the cutting sleet fell upon her bare neck, cruelly wounding her sad sweet face. Blow more gently, oh pitiless storm! for thou hast no need to hate her. Turn thy blasts away from the unpro- tected one! "They will not regard it," she thinks; " they know it is a starving beggar, and they will not open!" Once more the spirits about her infused energy to her heart by calling up the picture of the tea-table, with its   STELLA LEA.        271 burden of smoking viands, and as it throbbed with a new force, she lifted her tiny hand the third time and gave a resolute pull at last. Ah  that is it; they have heard now, and are coming to give thee succor. Wait a little, desolate one, for thy fainting heart shall beat happily to-night, thy hunger shall be stayed, and a good, clean, warm bed shall bear up thy aching limbs, and the sweetest sleep that ever rested upon human eyelids shall waft thee holy dreams! A foretaste of Paradise is indeed before thee! The door opened, and the old lady stood before her, as the child timidly supported herself by the wall. A sin- gle glance told the orphan's story better than words,' for a christian woman gazed upon human wretchedness. "Come in, my little girl, come in and tell us what you wish," said the kind-hearted woman with a pleasant voice; "how cold the storm is! IIurry, child, and let me shut the door!" The little mendicant stepped over the threshold and stopped; but the matron opened the door of the room in which the tea-table had been observed and bade her fol- low. Her short story was soon told, and artless as it was the women looked doubtingly at each other, as if fearing treachery and deception, even from a half-frozen child!- Sad, sad commentary on human experience! "I have told you the truth," said the pleading orphan, as she noticed the expression of distrust, "I certainly have told you the truth. My dear, dear mother is dead, and I can not go back to that horrible place, he beats me so! Please, kind lady, let me stay!"   272      HOUSEHOLD TALES. That is right, sweet seraph, their hearts are already in a tender mood, and a little more of the natural eloquence of undeserved suffering will cause them to melt; plead on, plead on! And yet thou hast no need; thy wonderful beauty is pleading for thee. Thine angel eyes, thy rich, wavy hair, disheveled as it is, and thy looks of truth and purity shine forth from thy wretched garb, and they have begun to question if thou art an angel in disguise! Let them but reflect that God alone hath made thee to differ, and thy deliverance and happiness are achieved. Some generous tears started from eyes unused to weep, and they gave her food, and sweet warm milk, and placed a footstool before the radiant fire, where she warmed her relaxing limbs, and seemed in a beatific trance. The hail beat vehemently against the windows, the storm increased in violence, and even the elements united in the petition to give the little wanderer rest. The dark nighthad its voice of entreaty, and it moved the sympathy of the mis- tress of that household, when less in earnest than she ap- peared, she recalled the attention of the child to her fugi- tive position. "Is n't it time for you to go home, my child?" she in- quired with a gentle tone; "you are warm now, and you are no longer hungry." A visible shudder passed over the little one, and turn- ing her large eyes to her questioner with an expression of pain, a flood of tears coursed down her almost impassive cheeks, while her lips uttered no sound. "If you are timid, and are afraid of the darkness, you can walk part way with the gentleman, who is going out   STELLA LEA.        273 of an errand in a few minutes," persisted the woman, in seeming earnestness. A heavy, bursting sigh of woe came from the, quiver- ing lips of the orphan, and she sobbed out, - "Dear, kind lady! indeed I have no home, no father, no mother, no friend at all, - may I not stay here?" Hers were not the only sobs that swelled in deep feel- ing in that warm room; but the schooled hearts of the elders refrained themselves, and the woman who had al- ready spoken continued, - "You will soon tire of us, perhaps, and then you will wish yourself away." "Oh, never, never, - only try me, - do just try me, and I shall never wish to leave you!" said the pleader in hopeful animation. "And what can you give me if I let you stay?" asked the other in a tone that was more than half a consent. "I will give my whole heart!" replied the child, leap- ing up and seizing the woman's hand; "I will love you ever and ever so much, and be as good as good can be!- Dear, sweet lady, may I stay?" "But I have no children for you to play with, and you will be lonesome and unhappy." "I never played with children!" replied the little one, "I do not know a child; but I will be your child if you have none, and I will love you, and be so happy! And God will love you -I'm sure He will- and my poor, dead mother will love you, for ever, and for ever! Only let me, let me stay!"  It would have been difficult to have resisted such im-   HOUSEHOLD TALES.  portunity, even if the disposition had existed. But the hearts of the Iistening trio were touched by the orphan's story, and the tears of sympathy that came unbidden bore  witness to her that she had found a home! 5Mr. and Mrs. Lea were benevolent people, in good cir- cumstances,-who had been several years married, but no children had ever blessed their union. They had more than once discussed the subject of adopting some child of  misfortune and poverty, but had never detprnined to do it, simply because they had not met with a foundling just to their taste. The idea of retaining so beautiful a child was not, therefore, of itself repugnant to them, and after  some conference, it was decided that she might remain till morning, and if-upon full investigation the child's story  was established, and she proved really to be as artless and innocent as she appeared, her future could be easily de-  cided upon. The old lady,' rs. Lea's mother, was en-  raptured with the adventure, declaring that 'there was la special Providence in it; that God had sent them that beautiful being a purpot to be cherished ; that she had a kind o' queer feeling when she opened the door, as if a  spirit, like, had flapped its wings in the door-way, and a'- nOSt put the lamp out.' She more naturally came to the onclusion that 'it would be a crying sin and shame for Alks like them to reject a blessing, and drive her. away ' she happened to turn out an angel after all!'  The child's joy at the permission given her to remain ver night was unbounded, and before the evening closed le had displayed many little winning graces, that already itwined themselves in the affections of her future moth-   STELLA LEA.         275 er, so that before bed-time she really began to love her. It was in truth a spirit that entered that dwelling, and its benedictions were echoed in the hearts of the kindly-dis- posed ones, in their midnight reveries, while the blessed slumbers of the gentle being whom they had succored were filled with dreams of happiness and Heaven. The following morning investigations were made into the child's story, and it was soon demonstrated that so far from having falsified, she had scarcely given a remote idea of the polluted hovel from which she had escaped. In a corner of the room was the filthy pallet upon which her mother had died, and no other furniture was to be seen, excepting half a dozen upturned deal boxes, in different states of dilapidation. Upon these, around the fire, were hovering three or four abandoned creatures of both sexes, bloated, sickening specimens of viciousness, and a half- drained bottle of whisky was circulating among them, in- creasing the intoxication of which all were evidently vic- tims. The place was reeking with pollution, and it was no wonder that the child had pleaded so eloquently to be delivered from its foul approaches; the wonder is, and it seems incomprehensible, that she could be so pure and so chaste, after her intimacy with such corruption, physical and moral., The group roused themselves at the entrance of Mr. Lea, with no very amicable expressions of visage, as they probably suspected him to be an emissary of the police, in search of some transgressor of the law. His courteous demeanor soon undeceived them, and their cringing fear gave place to ribald welcome, interlarded .with a copious   276       HOUSEHOLD TALES. display of gross profanity. Without the necessity of in- quiry he was readily able to identify Floyd, and with an eye to his presumed weaknesses, he gradually led him to a conversation about the absent girl. The mention of her roused all his latent wickedness, and he vented his spite at her delinquency in hideous oaths and threats of savage re- vengej whenever she came again within his power. Mr. Lea adroitly suggested that she might, possibly, have been arrested as a mendicant; in which case she would be pro- vided for by public authority, and his claim upon her then might be very questionable. This was a view of the af- fair that Floyd seemed not to have thought of, and as it took form in his mind, he heaped curses upon her careless- ness, and mentally abandoned her to her fate. This was exactly what Mr. Lea had aimed to do, and it was not then a work of difficulty, by the payment of a few dollars, to in- duce the drunken desperado to sign an obligation relin- quishing all claim upon the child, and renouncing all in- terest in her future disposal. It was, doubtless, a fortu- nate circumstance that the fellow was partially intoxicated, for otherwise his cupidity might have prevented a con- summation of the benevolent fraud practised upon him. Subsequent events proved that this would have been the probable result. A few weeks residence with her new friends abundantly foreshadowed all the budding beauties of the child's char- acter. Nature had lavishy endowed her with harmonious capabilities, and her mental capacities were as acute and comprehensive as her moral and physical were beautiful and pure. There was nothing within the range of mor-   STELLA LEA.         2" tal achievement that she did not seem capable of being trained to accomplish. Her daily life was a constant suc- cession of beautiful episodes, and being a pleasant compan- ion of Mrs. Lea, she wound the tendrils of her luxuriant affections right about the heart of the happy woman, cling- ing to it with a wonderful tenacity, while all the warm im- pulses of the cultivated lady poured themselves out in glowing affection for the orphan. Both were attractive in their confidential love, and it might have been difficult to decide which was the happier, the. matron or the child to whom she had given her own name of Stella Lea. To realize what a perfect childhood may be, you should have seen Stella in her new home. From the impression she has made upon you to-night you can 'easily imagine how exquisitely beautiful she must have been, and she possessed a maturity of judgment beyond her years; this probably resulted, in part at least, from the peculiar situ- ation she had occupied, when, being often left to herself she was obliged not only to reflect much, but to form con- clusions and to act upon her own responsibility. She seemed never to have been contaminated by evil associ- ates, and the constant exhibition of vice, with its loath- some consequences, only generated in her heart hatred and disgust for it, in all its forms. Farther than this, she became unwittingly the imitator of her benefactress, who has few peers in the graces and amenities of her charac- ter, and a deep well of social qualities was ever upris- ing, spring-like, to give her thirsting spirit an abundance of healthful waters.. Thus Stella became a fascinating child, of whom everybody talked, and whose society was 24   278      IOUSEtIOLD TALES. constantly sought, because every one that came in contact with her loved her, while no degree of adulation disturbed her prevailing modesty, or excited any appearance of a personal vanity. She seemed continually to bear in mind her earliest promise to ' be as good as good can be.' Floyd was not long in discovering her situation, nor did her opening career pass unobserved by him. When he reflected upon his own course, he was deeply chagrined at what he had done, but he saw no remedy. The devel- opment of the child's loveliness suggested to him that he had suffered a rare victim to escape his lust, and as her graces daily became more conspicuous, his passions were proportionately excited, and he began to plot for her ruin. One day he met Stella in the street alone, and seizing her firmly by the hand, he endeavored to entice her to accom- pany him 'to see a friend of her mother;' failing in this, he attempted to frighten her into compliance, by brutal and threatening language, at the same time using all the force he dared to exhibit in the public street. The child was greatly alarmed, and just as an acquaintance oppor- tunely approached, she uttered a cry of terror and fell fainting to the sidewalk. The cowardly villain fled pre- cipitately, and the maiden was conveyed to a druggist's near by, where she soon revived, and was safely conducted to her friends. This adventure was the first circumstance to suggest danger from the machinations of her former companions, and the most painful anxiety was the consequence. She did not venture in the streets alone, was withdrawn from school, and kept as secluded as a nun. Private teachers   STELLA LEA.         279 were provided for her, and in the society of her friend she found all her pleasures and companionship, After a few months the solicitude gradually wore away, and from information obtained it appeared that Floyd left the city immediately after his abortive attempt at abduction, and he had not been heard of subsequently. It began to be suspected that too much importance had been attached to the affair, and a year after she was allowed to return to school; by degrees the event lost much, of its signifi- cance. Circumspection, however, never was lost sight of, and she seldom allowed herself to be alone; but the lapse of time brought no repetition of the attempted outrage, and quiet happiness was once more established in the home of the orphan. Stella at length reached her sixteenth year, and the in- cident was almost forgotten; she was a pupil in one of the seminaries which distinguish the capital of New England, and in the habit she had early formed, her varied duties were performed with remarkable punctuality. Her time for leaving and returning home was as conscientiously ob- served as matters of greater moment; and when one day she did not arrive at the invariable hour, the attention of Mrs. Lea was almost instantly excited by the fact. Ten minutes elapsed, and she did not come; the agitated lady walked to the window, gazed up and down the street, and endeavored to calm her singular disquiet by reflecting on the probable and natural causes of detention. A half hour wore away, but the pupil did not return. Half ashamed of her anxiety, the now thoroughly frightened woman at- tired herself hastily for the street, and started for the,   280       HOUSEHOLD TALES. school-room; its doors were closed, and silence reigned in its precincts. A dreadful foreboding seized upon her as she retreated, and her limbs scarcely supported her as she hastened homeward. Stella had not arrived, and it was an hour beyond her time. A domestic was instantly sent to the nearest residence of a school-mate who often ac- companied her to and from school, and the ominous intel- ligence was speedily returned that the absentee had left the school-room at the usual hour, had been accompanied within a square or two of home, and had positively de- clined a short walk, on the ground that her delay to re- turn as promptly as usual would excite surprise, if not alarm, on the part of her mother. It would be difficult to describe the consternation that followed this announcement, or the suffering that ensued. Mr. Lea was instantly summoned, messengers were des- patched hither and thither, and inquiries set on foot in all directions; but no tidings were learned of her from the moment she separated from her companion in the proxim- ity of her own home. The police were engaged for the search of the missing girl, the crier sounded his alarm, and the press spread the knowledge of her mysterious disappearance far and wide. Rewards were offered both by her friends and by the public authorities, either for her safe return or for reliable information regarding her. But day and night passed and came again, and the search was redoubled as time wore on, but not the slightest clue was found to solve the painful mystery. Of course the remembrance of the former attempt' of Floyd gave rise to the belief that he was involved in   ,STELLA LEA.         281 the matter,and there could be no doubt of a forcible ab- duction, with strong probabilities of fiendish ravishment, if not of actual murder. The suspense was horrible to friends who had grown to love her with devotion as pow- erful as if she had borne their own blood in her veins, and their grief became frantic. Mrs. Lea especially was prostrated by the calamity, and such a desolate, heart- broken creature as she was I trust never to see again. I could not depict her agony if I were disposed; .but it resulted, at length, in utter prostration, followed by brain fever. Long days of delirium kept hermin ignorance of immediate events, and it appeared impossible, for a time, that she could survive the terrible shock. You have promised to listen quietly till my story is ended, John, and you must allow me a little episode that, if you could speak, you would denounce as fanciful and absurd. I should n't be disturbed by your opinions, how- ever, for there are some truths that reason can never ap- preciate, any more than the laws of matter can seize the colors of the rainbow and render them as palpable to the touch as to sight. It does not follow, except as a legal maxim, that 'what is not proved does not exist;' on the contrary, there are a thousand phenomena in our every day experiences, that admit of no proof beyond individu- al consciousness, which nevertheless are received as the most strongly established of all possible truths. To wliom, for example, has the immortality of the soul been proved? - or the blessed union of the redeemed in 'a better land' than this? And yet who but fools and madmen doubt these truths! We' cling to them all the stronger that 24'*   282        HOUSEHOLD TALES. they are above reason, - not opposed to it, --and rever- ence them the more that they demand of us the exercise of a sublime faith. But I have strange thoughts, sometimes, regarding the inhabitants of the celestial world, and I sincerely believe with our 'general ancestor' in Milton, that Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep. Nor is it from the merely fanciful absurdity of a visionary brain, that I am conscious, in many a moonlight musing under the still arch of heaven, that Often from the steep Of echoing hill or thicket, I have heard Celestial voices in the midnight air. Angels are personal existences as really -as the corpo- real manifestations of mundane humanity, whether mod- ern needs ever meet them or not. Mamre and Bethlehem have left the world something better than fanciful legend on this point; and with a full faith in the fact of these di- vine messengers of the olden days, I conceive it to be no more exquisite poetry than sober truth to affirm that Oft in bands While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk, With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds In full harmonic number joined, their songs Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to heaven. Nor is this their sole office. They bend, on their still wings, over the couch of the sleeper, and hold most witch- ing converse with the internal man, and teach lofty les- sons; and it is only because the soul is darkened by the deep shadows of the sensual, that this 'truth is not oftener   STELLA LEA.         283 perceived and reverenced. Just in proportion as the heart is pure, and the mind unclouded, will be these spir- itual inceptions, and the-soul will enter among a society of intelligences whose communings can only elevate and ennoble. Ou'r sleeping moments ofttimes become our most earnest, for then it is that the sensuous is most qui- escent; and as of old, men of a simple and reliant faith were 'warned of God in dreams,' so is it that even now, Truth, tell-tale, hovers o'er happy dreams. Thus much for my digression, John; its pertinency is yet to appear. But to return to the occasion of it, it is necessary to say that just previous to the disappearance of Stella Lea I had become very deeply interested in her. My own wife had passed away, and in the moments of my lonely leisuredI often sought the society of my rel- ative, Mrs. Lea, and her bewitching ward. I had volun- teered to instruct her in German, and she was progress- ing rapidly when she was so singularly lost. Of course I was painfully excited, not only for the precarious condi- tion of Mrs. Lea, but for the fearful uncertainty hanging over the fate of the beautiful orphan. There was some- thing so shockingly repulsive in the thought of her being ravished by brutal force, and by such a disgusting demon) that I could not banish it from my mind, and by day and by night, sleeping and waking, a vision of the unhappy girl was in some form before me. In a nocturnal visita- tion there were revelations made to me that led to her discovery, in a manner singular enough. I dreamed that I was in a sequestered part of the  .                  ,   284      HOUSEHOLD TALES. country, in a mountainous region, and in a ramble-among the hills I came suddenly upon an old thatch-covered cot- tage, which upon entering I found to be occupied by an aged woman, who was no more tidy than her dwelling, I * had an indistinct, confused revery as I sat before her, in which she seemed to vanish away, and in her stead an air)y vision of beauty slowly gathered into bodily form, and at length the countenance of Stella Lea was smiling upon me in happy recognition. When I awoke I was in that state of utter exhaustion not uncommon to one who sud- denly rouses from a dream, and my mind was vividly im- pressed by the incident. There was nothing very remark- able in the dream itself, for I fancied all sorts of things concerning her, and very naturally the vagaries of a dis- turbed slumber might have assumed a picture similar to that I have described. But it was not so natural that I could not divest myself of the impression that there was something of reality in the nocturnal ramble; that the more I strove to dispel it, the more I became conscious of the existence of such a cottage and such a personage as inhabited it; that the pe- culiar scenery impressed me more and more as possessing physical characteristics that I had never met with but in a single instance, and that years before; and more than all, that as the morning- wore away, the dream should be- come to me a fixed presentiment, foreshadowing the true condition of the missing girl. Such was its effect upon me, and no reasoning could have shaken my faith in the revelation I had received. I determined to proceed privately to the region where   STELLA LEA.            285 the cottage had been located, and make diligent search to find it. I had already been to the ' Eastern Stage House' * to learn when I could make my earliest departure for the mountains of New Hampshire, and was debating wheth- er to delay till the next morning, and take the public con- veyance, or provide private means and make all possible expedition, when my office door opened, and an intimate friend, a brother barrister, entered, having the evening previous returned from a trip to the White mountains. He was uninformed of Stella's abduction, for he had been absent when it occurred; nor had he any personal ac- quaintance with her, although he had several times seen her in my company. We talked a few moments, when as he rose to leave, he said, familiarly,- "By the way, Ned, I have discovered a rival to your pretty protege! In a hunting ramble the other day, I en- countered the very image of Stella Lea, at a most miser- / As the main incidents of this Tale, are founded upon occurren- ces of actual existence, it is proper to say to uninformed readers, that a generation ago, and for time immemorial previously, there stood in Ann street, somewhat to the north of Merchants Row, a famous Tavern with the above name. The building has been several years demolished, its site covered with ware-houses, and as if to annihilate the memory of the old days, the name of the street, even, has been supplanted, and its as- sociations obliterated by substituting the title of North street. But be- fore the days of rail-roads, no more noted place than the Eastern Stage House existed in the Puritan city. There all arrivals from northern and northeastern New England were made, from thence were all departures, and many a merry jest and homely story has betokened the good fellow- ship of the multitudes of guests who sought its cheer. But the days of the stage-coach have departed, the echoing horn is forever silent, the generations of I slow travelers' have passed away, and it is, perhaps, fit- ting that the chief public-house connected with their memory should have lost its existence cotemporary with them.   286       HOUSEHOLD TALES. able apology for a country tavern, where nobody would ever find it unless by accident. I just caught a glimpse of her through an upper window, but if I ever saw one thing like another, the far-off country beauty is the per- fect copy of that lone star. I have a mind to import her, and become another benefactor!" As you may suppose, I had no doubt that he had seen Stella herself, and I found a remarkable coincidence be- tween his statement and my dream; if I had needed assur- ance of the prophetical nature of the latter, here it was, offered without the asking, and furnishing me an accurate guide to the exact spot designated. I made no commu- nication to him of my presentiment, but after minute inqui- ries as to the place, and its relative situation, I deter- mined upon immediate action. Accordingly I procured a light vehicle with a strong, fleet horse, and protected by a brace of carefully loaded pistols, I was soon on the road, traveling as rapidly as regard for the endurance of the horse would allow. At a suitable stage I took a fresh an- imal, and pushed on all night in my benevolent errand, inspired by a dream! About noon the next day, the evidences of a near ap- proach to the mountains became constantly apparent, in the vision of their shaggy outlines, in the rude appear- ance of the far-separated dwellings, in the sterile indica- tions of the soil, and in the sensible difference in the tem- perature of the atmosphere. To avoid suspicion, I dis- pensed with the carriage at a public house, and made the last ten miles of the journey on horseback. I had no dif- ficulty in discovering the path that my friend had defined,   STELLA LEA.         287 and after a two hours' ride, I came to the very thatched cottage of my dream, with its gambrel roof, and little dia- mond shaped windows, while a rude sign-board indicated its use as a tavern. It was in a desolate place, with a marsh and bog-hole in front, a few trees about it, and a dense forest extending to the rear. With a beating heart I alighted, threw the bridle rein over a post, and went up to the door. Anr old crone came to meet me, a blear-eyed, hideous- looking creature, and in spite of her apparent unwilling- ness, I entered and made myself quite familiar. I heard no sound about the house, nor could I discover from her that there was any other being beneath the roof. She  declared that there was no other person for miles around except her ' old man,' as she called him, who was off in the hayfield. I did not put confidence in her statement, feeling morally sure that the object of my search was in concealment somewhere upon the premises. After some parleying I inquired of h'er for the young woman whom a friend of mine had seen there a few days before. She betrayed a quick surprise, gave me a searching look, and instantly recovering her self-possession, boldly asserted that no other woman than she, young or old, had been in the house for a month. I saw that no headway could be made by indirection, and assuming as much of the bra- vado, as seemed requisite, I told her she was falsifying, that a young girl was then restrained within her knowl- edge, and that I should not leave her until I discovered her. The hag still protested utter ignorance of any such person, began to whimper in mock fright, and impiously   288       HOUSEHOLD TALES. called Heaven to witness her innocence. Money was proffered to tempt her cupidity; but it produced no other effect than to allay any fears she might have had of vio- lent proceedings, and led her to exhibit the tone and ap- pearance of a perfect virago. Finding that nothing but extreme measures would advance me at all, I changed my tactics, charged her with being privy and accessory to the crime of abducting and secreting a young girl, and with assumed authority proceeded to arrest her. She set up a horrible howling, as I seized her to put my threat into execution, when the chamber door burst open, and with a wild cry of joy Stella bounded into the room, and spring- ing forward fell fainting in my arms! I flung the old beldam from me, laid the senseless girl upon the floor, and began to restore her to consciousness. Seeing me thus occupied, as quick as thought the old im- personation of the fiend rushed for a tin horn that hung by the door, applied it to her lips, and was about sounding a blast that would doubtless have caused an interruption to my labors,-perhaps been followed by loss of life; it certainly evinced the fact that aid was within reach of its sound.- Luckily, I looked up, and with an agility equal to her own, I leaped for the door, and without reck of con- sequences I dealt a blow that leveled her, and effectually anticipated the sonorous music of the fish-horn. It was the last, as well as the first time that I ever struck a wo- man, but I was not in a state to think much of the propri- eties due to age and sex! By this time Stella began to revive, and by the rather free use of a bucket of water standing in a corner of the     STELLA LEA.         289 room, I soon had the pleasure of seeing her restored far enough to comprehend the necessity of a hasty retreat. The old beldam had also recovered herself so as to be- gin to scream lustily, and was only silenced by the threat- ened discharge of my pistols through her heart. Not be- ing convinced of her discretion after our absence, I took the additional precaution of thrusting her down cellar, as- suring her in bolting the door, that if she made the slight- est whimper for an hour, the building should be burned over her head. She was at length conquered, and hurrying silently out of the house we gained the road-side, mounted the quad- ruped, who entered heartily into the adventure by quietly taking a double burden, and made all possible speed for the low country. I did not forget to bear away the horn, lest-the old woman might get loose, and use it to our det- riment; there it hangs, John, for I have kept it as a sa- cred trophy of victory in modern knight-errantry. The fun you have often had over it, in rallying me upon being always ready ' to blow my own horn' is over now, for you have its true history. Our journey was not impeded, and two days after, I had the unspeakable happiness of deliv- ering the damsel into the custody of her friends, safe and sound. Such ecstatic joy as followed is not often witnessed on this poor earth. The rejoicing of the seraphs over the conversion of a wandering soul, in imminent peril of a fearful doom, is its only parallel. Mrs. Lea's recov- ery had just begun to be foreshadowed, and when: she awoke from her delirium, the sweet angel of love for 25   290      HOUSEEHOLD TALES. whom she suffered was watching by her bedside, almost breathless with anxiety lest she should never be recog- nized again. But the days of woe were past, and a few weeks, with the gentle ministrations of her devoted nurse, brought established health once more. The maiden had escaped one of the most diabolical plots ever formed in a civilized community. On her way from school Stella had met a respectably appearing fe- male, who feigned to be seized with sudden illness just as they approached each other. She pretended to be in se- vere suffering, reeled and faltered, and extending her arms to Stella, sought for support. The victim was complete- ly duped, and not dreaming of deception, readily extend- ed all the aid she could. After a few moments' waiting, the woman professed to grow worse, declared she could never reach home alone, and requested the sympathizing girl to accompany her; assuring her that it was but a short distance, and naming both the street and number. The ruse was complete; the deception was artfully sustained, and the innocent maiden was completely ensnared. Her generous impulses prompted her to do all in her power to relieve a fellow creature in distress, and the delay in her return which she had resolutely declined for purposes of pleasure, she promptly assumed at the call of charity. The two slowly turned their steps toward the North End,' stopping occasionally, as the counterfeit suffering of the elder required, who leaned heavily upon her compan- ion at every Step, and soon arrived at the place designa- ted. It was a very decent house, in a narrow, but not a disreputable street, and thanking her with warm protesta- !   STELLA LEA.         291 tions of gratitude, the woman assured the happy devotee to goodness, that if she would but assist her up the steps and into her parlor, she would dispense with her atten- tions and remember her as long as she lived. Almost of necessity the request was complied with; the door was opened, the fated orphan was in the vestibule, and Floyd sprang from concealment, bolted the door behind her and exclaimed, with an expression of demoniac triumph, - "Caught at last, my pretty fly-away bird of Paradise! CBetter late than never,' and so fair a bride is worth a ten years' waiting; my mouth waters for a bite at the cherry cheeks and honey lips!" The vile decoy of the brute burst into a coarse laugh, Stella uttered a piercing shriek, as the truth flashed into her mind, and fell senseless to the floor. How long she remained in a state of insensibility she could never tell; but when she recovered consciousness she was seated in a carriage, borne rapidly along over an . unpaved road, from which she concluded she was being conducted from the city; her eyes were hoodwinked, her hands confined, and upon either side of her was seated a man, one of whom she recognized, by the unmistakable voice that had been the terror of fer infancy. Long- long and dreadful was that ride; and terrible was the ag- ony endured; but yet she dared not speak for fear of the ruffians beside her, who made her shudder with the pro- fane obscenity of their conversation, but yet they offered her no violence, and outraged her with no other insult. At length the vehicle stopped, and their destination ap- peared to be reached. The companions of her journey   292       HOUSEHOLD TALES. alighted, their voices were joined by others, and she was removed from the carriage and borne within a building. The echo of retreating wheels fell upon her ear, the sound of human voices ceased, and when her hands were un- bound, and her eyes were unbandaged, she was iifthe up- per room of -that old cottage, alone with Floyd! iHe tempted her by every art he could invent to yield herself a sacrifice to his sensuality; he taunted her with , a remembrance of her illegitimate parentage, endeavor- ing to prove to her that it would follow her as a badge of shame, throughl her whole ife.-. But she flung back his allurements and his taunts with equal- scorn; taught him that honor and happiness arose from conscious virtue, and not from birth; and with a superhuman courage the fair being poured from her innocent lips a' bold malediction of his deeds and intents that made him bow like a reed bed- fore the blast. O, the Devil is a coward, make the best of him; and it only needs a true intent, and a fixed purpose in good- ness, to deliver the weakest tempted one. The pinna- cle of the temple saw him fly abashed at the mere menh tion of duty, and it is enough that the disciple has before him the triumphant example of the Master. No violence was offered to force a compliance with the demon's wishes, and he deliberately told his victim that he should wait her consent. At the same time he assured her she was completely in his power, with no chance of escape, And that she was sure to yield in the end. Every day he obtruded his loathed presence upon her, and find- ing that time only emboldened her resistance, he had at   STELLA LEA.         293 length threatened to reduce her by starvation. When she escaped she had tasted no food for forty-eight hours, and indeed but little since her restraint, as she feared the attempt to overcome her by stupefying drugs, and dared only to partake slightly of such as had been offered her. Three times, within each diurnal period had he tempted her raging appetite by sumptuous preparations, delicious- looking fruits, and cooling beverages, feasting himself in her presence, inviting her to join him, but at the price of virtue dearer to her than life. This refinement of cruel- ty he deliberately informed her he would persist in, with no morsel to pass her lips, and not a drop of water to al- leviate her consuming thirst, until she submitted to his- embraces. Killing her, or forcing her, either of which he might readily have done, wourd not gratify him, nor satisfy his purposes of revenge. Her humiliation alone, could do that, and despising him as she had, he would only intermit his torture by seeing her at his feet, suing to be delivered on his own terms. These were his own interpretations of his conduct, as he left her in the morning, ostensibly to hunt for game to inflame her appetite and provoke her sufferings at the din- ner hour. What might have been the end but for the in- terference so opportunely made, it is fearful to speculate upon; nor is there occasion to indulge in imaginative vis- ions of woe 'that might have been,' when Providence has interposed with the authoritative voice of deeds that have for ever forbidden it. It is enough that I was commis- sioned to go to the spot; that I arrived opportunely when the inhuman villain was absent; that the unfortunate pris- 25 -   294       HOUSEHOLD TALES. oner, recognizing my voice, was inspired with sufficient strength to burst the bolts that confined her, and escape. Satan has iho power over the pure and good, and Stel- la is a wonderful proof that all the machinations of fiends, with all appliances and means to boot, can never harm a hair of those whom God and good angels guard by special grace. But the trials of the fair damsel were not yet at an end; notwithstanding the criminal charge to which Floyd had made himself liable, he next had the daring impu- dence to attempt obtaining control of her by legal process. To this flagitious purpose there was preponderating evi- dence that the church of Rome lent her complicity, and furnished means. At all events, a notorious person who was a bigoted devotee to that ecclesiastical hierarchy, - or perhaps it would not be uncharitable, judging by his life and deeds, to say a selfish hypocrite, who had renounced the protestant faith of his fathers for pecuniary consider- ations- and purposes of gain, -an American, and a Boston physician, made himself conspicuous in- befriending the criminal and supporting his pretended claims. This man went to the house of Mr. Lea, first alone, and pleaded in intemperate enthusiasm with them to surrender her peace- ably, assuring them that Floyd's legal claim would be es- tablished beyond a question. He moreover asserted that Stella was artful, designing, and prone to wickedness un- der the cloak of great humility of deportment. Her re- lation of her interview with the woman in the street, her being decoyed to a house, and her treatment by Floyd, he   STELLA LEA.          295 pronounced ingenious fictions, framed to hide her own ob- liquity of morals. He charged that the house was of bad repute, - an undoubted fact, - that Stella had gone there of her own accord, for purposes that would be made to appear, and that her former, and natural protector had ob- served her, followed and rescued her. How specious a solution of her disappearance to those who did not know her! The circumstances of themselves were plausible and natural; there was truth enough in them to help the falsehood, and good people, even, lovP better to believe in wickedness than in purity; and to es- tablish the vile charges against her, desperate men were professedly at work, and of course with power to suborn abandoned characters ready to perjure themselves. The scheme was fearfully ingenious, and false as it was, there could be no question of its prejudicial influence if it were proclaimed to the world. The Roman emissary of Floyd professed the most religious desire to avoid this, to save her reputation, to reform her life, and lead her as a wan- dering lamb into the bosom of the true church. It was urged that she had been baptized into that communion - of which there was no proof- that Floyd was convinced that she was born of Heaven for a Nun, and proposed to place her at Mount Benedict; $ that if she were careful- t Mount Benedict is still the name of a beautiful elevation on the shores of the Mystic river, in the eastern part of the town of Som- erville, three miles from Boston. It was formerly within the corporate limits of -Charlestown. Its summit is still surmounted by the imposing ruins of the first Convent of note established in New England, where a quarter of a century has effected but slight change in their appearance. In the year 1834, and for a long time previous, there stood upon the eam-   296        HOUSEHOLD TALES. ly trained by the ghostly fathers, it was not too late for re- pentance, and absolution; while by being dedicated to the holy exercises of convent mysteries she would be eternal- ly saved from the fires of Hell, and become the Bride of Christ. A refusal to surrender her would subject her to the ruin of a blasted character, a life of scorn, and eter- nal perdition! Such were the damnable toils that were laid to ensnare as pure and innocent a being as ever walked, out of Par- adise; and such the subterfuges under which circum- vention was aimed at. She might doubtless have graced a convent and quickened devotion in many a confessor's heart; but it would have savored rather of the creature than the  Creator, and pardonably inspired forbidden' dreams of terrestrial bliss. But it may well be questioned if the purpose of placing her in such an institution had other foundation than a shallow pretense. -I was immediately retained as counsel for the troubled inence a fine brick edifice, spacious and well-appointed, occupied by the "Ursuline Community of Nuns," under the charge of a Lady Superior. In the year referred to, it was attacked by a mob under cover of night, its gardens destroyed, its grounds laid waste, and its buildings fired by incendiaries who refused to allow the flames-to be extinguished, and ut- ter ruin resulted. An attempt was made at the time, and for years per- sisted in, to give the affair an air of Protestant intolerance which in no wise belonged to it; the assumptions upon which this charge was based held just about the same relation to truth as the physician's in the text did to the facts regarding Stella Lea. Mount Benedict was surrounded by extensive brick-yards; a vulgar story had arisen regarding the cruel treatment, attempted escape, and mysterious disappearance of a Nun; the brick-makers, excited, demanded explanation; the indignant Lady Superior refused it, with insulting and exasperating language, and after a few days of unwarrantable folly on both sides, the anger of the mob wrought out its unhappy deed.   STELLA LEA.         297 family, and I entered into the case with a hearty will. I advised first, to inform Stella of all that was laid to her charge, with the probabilities of the evidence that would' be produced, and let her elect what course to pursue. If she denied the charges, -and chose to abide the hazard of a legal conflict, as of course she would, then I proposed to have her confront Floyd, the doctor, and his legal advi- ser, for he employed superior talent, and let her announce her wishes and determinations in person. My advice was followed, and Mrs. Lea made the com- munication to her. The persecuted girl received it with great composure, and declined any response except before her calumniators, and the following day was assigned for the meeting. The hour arrived and the parties were all present when Stella entered the room. She was the im- personation of calmness, dignity, beauty and conscious in- tegrity. She looked round about her till her eyes rested upon Floyd and the doctor, who sat side by side, and as her bosom heaved, and her, cheek flushed, she spoke with a solemnity that seemed to enter one's soul. "I am here," she said, "to listen to accusations which have- been whispered in the ears of iny friends, to blast my character, and drive me to desperation. But I have no anxieties as to the results; the God of the Fatherless hath delivered me in three perils, and He will not forsake me in the fourth. Let him who has aught to say against me speak, and the curse of the Almighty light upon his lips who suffers the slightest breath of falsehood to cause them to move! Who is he that accuses? - Let him re- member the doom of the lying Ananias!"   298      -HOUSEHOLD TALES. There was a hushed silence, a stifled sob from Mrs. Lea being alone audible, but no one spoke. The doctor's cra-. ven heart was conquered, and he dared not breathe the scandals he had so laboriously striven to reduce to consis- tency, and had retailed to 31r. Lea as capable of abso- lute proof. He was pale and confused, struck dumb by the Spirit of Innocence before him. Floyd was more brazen, and his countenance settled into a fiendish expres- sion of malignity, his lip curled and his eyes flashed with hate, but still he spoke not. "Well that your lying lips are closed, poor tool of Sa- tan! - she continued with her searching gaze upon Floyd, ( for if Divine vengeance had not restrained you from any farther persecution of me, human retribution should-; do you know that name, and remember the history that at- taches to it? Read, and fear for the Avenger!" Advancing close to his seat she extended a card to his view, which he leaned forward to read, and as he compre- hended it he turned away in horror. He hid his face in his hands, his frame shook, his knees smote together, and he groaned with remorseful agony. Then, spasmodically springing from his chair, he grasped his shirt-collar, tear- ing it open as if it was suffocating him, and sank down up- on his knees with uplifted hands, vainly striving to utter a word; his lips moved, but no vocality answered the me- chanical effort, while the cold sweat poured down his pal- lid cheeks like rain. Stella stood above him in all the glo- ry of beauteous maidenhood, with an air of conscious tri- umph, as an angel might triumph over a prostrate demon. In a  moment her countenance changed to an expression   STELLA LEA.        299 of pity, and with compassion for the abject wretch, she adopted a tone corresponding to her feelings, as she an- swered his pantomimic appeal. "Rise, rise, miserable victim of your own evil passions! Kneel not to me, for one who has kept your terrible se- cret locked in her own bosom for twelve long years, un- suspected of its possession even by you, is not likely to betray you when crushed at her feet. No, it is enough that you now know yourself in my power; - go, forsake your guilty ways, and repent before retribution -for the crimes of your life overtake you! Kneel to your offended Maker; and my prayers for your forgiveness shall still follow you, as they have to this hour. Your fate is safe in my hands, so long as you avoid your wickedness, and leave me at peace; but one farther breath to my injury and I will denounce you, and hasten your doom! Go, and never pollute me by your presence again!" The vile criminal, utterly confounded by the revelation made to him, rose hastily -at the word, with the abject look of a whipped cur, and a strangely mingled expres- sion of thankfulness for escape and fear lest he misinter- preted the language; slinking to the street door, he dis- appeared. The utmost astonishment prevailed among the listeners, for the impassioned girl seemed endowed with inspired gifts. The petrified physician could not withdraw his eyes from her steady gaze upon him, and with confi- dent emphasis she said to him, - "Now, sir, I demand from you that you here expose the fraud you have intended to practise, and clear me from the suspicions you have endeavored to excite against me.   300       HOUSEHOLD TALES, Relieved of the farther aid of the principal in your ne- farious schemes, you may, at least, render some repara- tion for the wrongs prompted by your perjured associate. Speak, -or may your silence weigh your guilty soul down to perdition, when all secrets shall be revealed!" One could feel his flesh creep at the solemnity of this last imprecation, as Stella raised her hands and eyes up- ward, and spoke with a deep, low fervency that seemed to carry assurance that it was recorded in the Tablets of Eternal Memory. The conspirator visibly quailed, shuf- fled in his seat, and betokened an inward conflict; shame and confusion were written on his countenance, with fear at the mysterious occasion of the desertion of his guilty accomplice. As the silence became painful, with the im- perious beauty still gazing upon him as if she would read his very soul, he at length yielded to the promptings of a humane justice, and slowly unfolded their schemes. He professed to have supposed--and in this he possibly, may have been honest--that Stella was really the daugh- ter of Floyd, and a certificate of his marriage was to have been produced to prove it; this was, of course, a forgery. The agreement made with Mr. Lea it was intended to show was obtained by misrepresentation, and when Floyd was incapable of understanding it by reason of intoxica- tion. Money was provided from some unexplained source to be tendered in payment of her past support, and if her peaceable surrender did not follow, a writ of habeas cor- pus was to issue, bringing her before the courts as a minor unjustly and illegally restrained from the care of her nat- ural guardian. In addition to the evidence already noted   STELLA LEA.        301 to sustain the claim, the false charges of her visits to a disreputable house were to be substantiated, and with a blasted character, the decision against her was accounted as a foregone conclusion. The conspiracy certainly had a formidable look, and its results would have been lament- able in any view. The unmasked hypocrite professed not to know absolutely that any of the testimony would have been false, but acknowledged that he had suspicions, and. excused his complicity by that baneful maxim that has de- luded more honest enthusiasts in sectarianism, -the end will justify the means.' Consultation followed the recital, and it was decided to be the course of wisdom for Mr. Lea to take measures to secure the legal control of the maiden, that no future pretended claims might be set up to annoy her. Initia- tory forms were complied with, the proper writ was pro- cured by the physician himself, who had been converted into a first-class sycophant, and readily undertook to make a quasi claim, that it might be adjudicated upon. Mean- time the interest which her abduction had created for her greatly increased, when it was told that a man publicly known as a violent sectarist, had sued for the care of her, and every one was left to make his own deductions. The day for the hearing came, and the Chief Justice was upon the bench. The court-room was densely filled, and after a patient hearing of the cause the custody of the maiden was confirmed to her benefactor and friend, by the highest judicial authority in the commonwealth. A burst of applause followed the decision, and for once the sympathy of a sheriff forgot the dignity of a court, and' 26   302       HOUSEHOLD TALES. when he should have looked sternly and shouted 6Silence in Court! '-he was observed to be closely imitating the judge by concealing his face in a cambric handkerchief. Within a week from the day of the decision, Floyd was arrested on suspicion of a connection with the rob- bery of a jeweler's store, some months previous. The police had long been suspicious of him, and his movements to entrap Stella were the occasion of attracting especial attention to him, and he was detected in having given a gold watch to one of the parties who was to appear as a witness against her. The watch was offered in pledge at a pawn-broker's, and as it corresponded in its number and appearance with the description of one of those sto- len, it was retained, traced to Floyd, and his imprisonment followed. His trial was assigned, and the day was at hand; he appeared very gloomy and dejected, often re- fused his prison fare, and was moodily taciturn. At times he seemed possessed with some strange fear that haunted him, looking wildly from side to side, starting suddenly, and appearing as if half-suffocated, grasping spasmodical- ly at whatever encompassed his throat. The keeper re- ported his observations to the jailer, and the turnkey was directed to commit another occupant to the cell. A pris- oner was one morning conducted to the corridor to be en- tered as a companion to the miserable victim of remorse. But the dismal abode had been entered before them, and a ghastly occupant, whose name was Death, was already a companion of the criminal. He had committed his last murder in dying a suicide! The persecutions of the orphan were ended, and thence- (   STELLA LEA.         303 forward her life has been a perpetual fountain of joy. A studied silence is ever maintained upon the terrible secret of Floyd's life, and it will doubtless die- with her. Mr. and Mrs, Lea have lavished their treasures of love upon her, and opened every avenue for her accomplishment in goodness, knowledge, and the graces; while she, sweet creature that she is, has repaid them a thousand-fold by her gratitude and devoted attachment, and all attainments and accomplishments that woman can achieve are hers. She is the very best person, as well as the loveliest, that dwells on the face of the wide earth; and I really sym- pathize with you, John, for having fallen in love with her under such unfortunate circumstances. But my story is done, and you can speak, now! The barrister's friend had nearly fallen asleep in the drowsy music of the other's voice. As soon, however, as he had liberty to speak he roused himself, and his mind leaped over the portions, of the narrative least interest- ing, and rested back with his first thought. How flatter- ing to the story-teller! "Well, Ned, just tell me one thing; who is the widow- er, the rhyming lawyer, that she is to conduct to Elysium next week?"

"WAKE up, coachman, what's the hour?  You prom- ised to have us in at seven, and here we've been tumb- ling over the mountains, and through the mud, half the night. Isay, whip-stick, what time is it?" "Ten o'clock, sir," said the driver, in a gruff, surly tone that betrayed vexation, " ten o'clock, and two miles far- ther to drive."  "Well, hurry up, then, hurry up, and deliver us from this cursed cold " "Aye, aye, sir, have patience!" The passenger muttered some reproaches as he drew his head from the window, let fall an oath or two, and sunk down into his cloak again, closing his eyes in an ap- parent doze, as before he had spoken. He was a rough looking fellow, full bearded, with black, piercing eyes, half-concealed beneath his meeting brows.  He was a   THE BETRAYED.        305 well-made man, nevertheless, and under more favorable circumstances, with a little assistance from the toilet, he would have passed for a person of fine appearance. It was a dark, cold, dismal night in November; the at- mosphere was filled with clouds borne down to the earth, occasionally condensing into rain, but oftener enshroud- ing everything in a dense, icy mist. All day we had been toiling over the mountains in a stage-coach, and a tedious disagreeable business it was. The roads had been del- uged and gullied by the autumn rains, and the heavy ve- hicle lumbered along, with the wheels often sunk mid-deep in the ruts, so that the jaded horses could scarcely keep a faster pace than a walk, and even then they were occa- sionally unable to extricate tihe coach from the muddy furrows, until the passengers alighted and put their shoul- ders to the wheels. A searching north-east wind added to the discomforts of the journey, and cold, weary, and wet as we were, the best of humor did not prevail among the passengers. But all these annoyances of travel excited in me less of regret for myself, than for another, who was an entire stranger, but had attracted my attention and enflisted my sympathies, from the moment of leaving the distant city. This was a young and delicate female, whose countenance told the story of her heart, and let you at once into the secret of her soul. She took but little interest in what transpired, seemed moody and sad, and from the position Ioccupied in front of her, I could not avoid observing her stealthily brush away the tears that often trembled on the long dark lashes that shaded her sorrowing eyes. As the 26*   306       HOUSEHOLD TALES. night set in her desolation could be indulged more secret- ly as well as more freely, and I could not but be sensible of some deep grief that moved her, for sigh after sigh re- vealed it, with stifled sobs that told of deep agony. The profane passenger, who had hailed the coachman acted as her-protector, and there was ostensible evidence that he should have been such legally. But there was an unmistakable something in his manner that bespoke him a heartless villain, and from the first I had not been able to doubt that he was crushing a fond heart, that he had won but to betray. A conviction forced itself upon me that he had stolen like a serpent into the little Eden of her home, charmed her by artful fascinations, till he beguiled her from the path of rectitude and honor, to grat- ify a reckless passion, and when her shame could not be longer concealed, he was fleeing with her to the retired country we approached, that the fruit of their mutual sin might be a secret among a strange people. Unknown as he was to me I felt my indignation kindle every time my eye met his, and I fancied he cowered be- neath my glance, for he would turn away with a malig- nant frown. With no other knowledge than I possessed of him, I could have seen him tied to a whipping..post, and I would have aided in his castigation, with the full approval of a satisfied conscience. The/victim of his deceit, whom he called by the pleas- ant name of Maria, could not have seen eighteen years. She was slenderly built, with full dark eyes, and hair richly black, falling in careless profusion beneath her hood, while her countenance indicated a nature of fine sensibil-   THE BETRAYED.        307 ities. Her hands were small, and the delicate fingers evinced that her station in life had never required her to rely upon them for support. Her whole appearance was attractive and prepossessing, and one would easily ima'g- ine her the idolized daughter of some fond mother, who mourned her absence, or perhaps was frantic over her ru- in. My heart went out to her as I gazed upon her, beau- tiful in her tears, and I threw the mantle of charity over her presumed frailties, as I mentally condemned the sel- fish libertine by her side. At length we reached the summit of the mountain, and the blast of the coachman's horn was a signal that we ap- proached the village of our destination. The man in the cloak again roused himself, thrust his head once more out of the window, and said to the driver,- "Remember the low house upon the right hand, with the poplar trees in front!" "Ay, ay, sir," responded the knight of the whip, who had taken great aversion to the passenger, for repeated acts of petty insolence during the day, " you need n't fear but I'll remember anything to get rid of you!" This discourteous response brought forth a volley of curses from the other, and his companion was not the only one that shuddered at his profanity, but she alone spoke, with words of earnest entreaty. "O, George, do n't swear so!" she pleaded; " you did n't use to, and please do n't again!" He answered only with sullen silence, and drew his cloak more closely about him. In a few moments more the coach drew up before the house designated, and the   308      HOUSEHOLD TALES. two alighted. While their baggage was selected, an el- derly woman came to the door with a light; she appeared to be a stranger to them, while there was evidently a pre- existin" arranigement between them, as their hurried con- versation indicated. As the trunks were deposited in the door-way, Maria clung to the arm of her companion, who impatiently turned to leave her, and with an unuttera- ble expression upon her countenance I heard her plead with him, - "Now, George, do come to-morrow morning! Please, dear George, do n't go away without seeing me! I feel so sltd and lonely my poor heart will break; do n't for- sake me, - oh, do n't forsake me so!" After some words in an undertone, of which I only dis- tinguished a phrase or two, from which I gathered that he harshy upbraided her for her weakness, he shook her off roughly, walked hastily to the street, and mounted the outside of the coach, taking a seat beside the driver. It was not-long before the gleaming of lamps, and the con- fused sound of voices announced to us that we were at the hotel, and amid the bustle of the moment I forgot the in- dividual who had so excited my antipathies, and when I again thought of him he had departed, and no one knew whither. Eight or ten weeks subsequent, returning from the dis- tant journey I had made, I again passed through the vil-. lage in the mountains. My arrival there immediately suggested the incident of the stormy'night; and to be can- did, the image of the young girl had been often in my thoughts, for I have seen, and been the dupe of so many   THE BETRAYED.        309 artifices of designing men, that I have a brotherly feeling for misfortune, in whatever garb I chance to meet it. I had been singularly interested in the frail beauty, and in my daily prayers for blessings upon my own little flock of absent loved ones, I had remembered the sorrowing pen- itent, as I doubted not she was, that she might, like the returning prodigal, while yet a great way off, see her Fa- ther stand waiting to forgive, and hasten to pour her sor- rows into his compassionate bosom. It was mid-day of a mild week in February when I ar- rived; I ordered an early dinner, and as I could proceed no farther until the following day, I determined to satisfy something more than a curiosity I felt to know more of the history of the wanderer. I concluded that the cler- gyman of the quiet country hamlet would be the most ap- propriate person to consult, as well as the most likely to be informed concerning her; for I felt sure that before this she would have sought an interview with him. Ac- cordingly, as soon as my repast was ended, I inquired for his residence, and walked out to find it. A stillness as of the Sabbath reigned-in the village, and the boys upon the green,--or what should have been such in the summer time, - were grouped three or four together, talking in subdued voices, and an air of serious quiet pervaded even the bar-room. I had not inquired the cause of it, nor, indeed, had I particularly observed it, until subsequent occurrences reminded me of the fact. On my way I saw many of the parishioners, fathers, mothers, and children, apparently in their Sabbath garbs, and as I entered the pastor's yard I encountered him in   310       HOUSEHOLD TALES. the walk. We saluted each other, and handing him my card I requested the favor of a short interview. He met me with cordiality, and seemed gratified in making the acquaintance of a stranger. "I am glad to see you," he said, " and shall be happy to render you- any service in my power. But I have a fu- neral to attend at this hour, and if you will step into my study and employ yourself over my books for an-hour, I will return and devote myself to your wishes." "If agreeable to you, sir, I will accompany you, and talk by the way," I replied. The venerable man acceded to my suggestion, and we walked down the street in company. "CThe saddest duty of my office, at any time,' said he, after a moment or two, " but I have never been called to so melancholy a service as this of to-day." Very naturally inquiries followed as to circumstances of interest to which he alluded, and the old gentleman continued, -- ' It is a short, but mournful story, sir, but if you cared to listen you might find your sympathies interested, as are those- of my simple-hearted people. If you wish you shall learn it all." I expressed a desire to be informed of the facts, and the white-haired patriarch proceeded, with the tremulous tones of feeling, as well as of age, to unfold to me some incidents that I was not unprepared to hear, and of which I had a presentiment the moment he referred to a funer- al. Maria was no longer an inhabitant of the village, and the universal solemnity that was now apparent to me was   THE BETRAYED.        3" occasioned by the interest her short life in the community had excited, now followed by her early death. The pas- tor's narrative was in few and simple words, and I have transcribed it- as accurately as possible. "The person to whom the last offices of respect are to- day to be rendered," said he, " came among us in a night of the last November. Her arrival- was the occasion of no little gossip among our honest citizens in the next few days, as the circumstances attending it were peculiar, and naturally communicated from one to another. No one could tell more than that she came a passenger in the coach from the East, anrd was accompanied by a tall, dark-- whiskered man, who kept himself closely enveloped in a camlet cloak. Some have questioned, indeed, whether any such person was with her, since he disappeared the same night; but such is the truth, as I had it from the poor girl herself. ,The widow at whose house she lived and died, professes to know only that a few weeks pre- viously she received a letter apparently written and posted in the city of New York, by one George Walker, asking for a few months' residence with her for his young wife, who was an invalid, and required country air and quiet. There was nothing remarkable in this circumstance, as it was customary for the good w6man to receive boarders into her family, and her little cottage in the summer time is filled with ladies and children, who seek these salubri- ous heights as a respite from the heated atmosphere of crowded cities. She presumed that her house had been commended-to the writer by some family in New York who had been guests with her, and deeming an agreeable   312       HOUSEHOLD TALES. young woman, as the letter assured her the applicant was, not a disagreeable companion for the approaching winter, she answered with her consent to receive the invalid. In three or four weeks, on the night I have referred to, the man presented himself, left a young woman in the care of the widow, and with a plea of urgent necessity, and an engagement to return in a week, he departed, and she had no subsequent knowledge of him. From some efforts made to trace him we simply discov- ered that no such persons were known to any of the for- mer guests of the widow, and he must have learned of the retreat in some casual way. All the information giv- en, by the unhappy victim herself was of the most gener- al nature, and as the sole cause of her ill-health was a promised maternity, the mystery about the parties was a topic of unusual remark. The good widow soon came to a conclusion that she was no wife, but one more gentle lamb led astray from the fold of God, by some wolf in sheep's clothing. The remarks of the censorious at first made her doubtful about allowing the girl to remain un- der her roof; but a charitable estimate of the fallen, and a sincerely christian desire to 'do as she would be done by,' finally triumphed, and from enduring her presence in a spirit of kindness, the most itender affection resulted. No mother could be more gentle or considerate, nor any daughter more gratefully attached. Two weeks after her appearance at the cottage, I was summoned to see her, and I hastened to her bed-side. I have-witnessed many painful scenes in the discharge of my professional duties, but never one like that. The un- ,    THE BETRAYED.        313 fortunate child, and she was nothing more, realized that she was deserted by one she had loved and trusted, and she was heart-broken; in her loneliness she had pictured so vividly the shame and grief that her mother would suf- fer on her account, that she was writhing in remorse; and her guilt before God appeared so odious and aggravated, that she feared she had committed the unpardonable sin. The agony of despair was her constant companion, and a maniac's end seemed inevitable. I proffered to her the sacred consolations of the gospel, pointed her to the never- failing Physician of the soul, and strove to lead her to a saving faith in the blessed Redeemer. But I seemed to pour water upon the ground; she had been well instructed in the truths of Revelation, and her mind comprehended the Christian system, but the burden of her constant feel- ing was that she could never be forgiven. In this state she continued for several weeks, holding a studied silence regarding the facts connected with her fall from virtue. It was a delicate matter for me to touch upon, but knowing the soothing influence wrought upon a troubled mind by confession, I led her to it as delicately as possible, and in return received her confidence. She was the daughter of a widow lady in affluent circumstan- ces, and some months ago she was placed in one of those moral pest houses called a Fashionable Boarding School. Here she made the acquaintance of a man who had used the arts so often practised by the unprincipled of our own sex, won a heart born to trust, ruined her reputation, and cruelly deserted her. No reference, however, was made either to names or localities, farther than that she spoke 27   314      HOUSEHOL] TALES. of her paramour by the christian name of George, while she called herself Maria. He had led on her guilty love under the promise of marriage, finding various pretexts for postponement, and at length had persuaded her to ac- company him to this secluded spot, where he abandoned her, leaving her to die among strangers. My visits to her were frequent, and by an exhibition of sympathy which I really felt, for she was singularly artless and confiding, I had at length the happiness to see her become an humble, hopeful disciple, rejoicing in the anticipations of immor- tality, by faith in the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. Everything was done for her happiness and comfort  that kindness could dictate, for not only did the benevo- lent widow exert herself to this end, but as the story of her sufferings and her wrongs became known, many a tetn- der mother's breast was moved with pity,-and the maid- ens of her own age throughout my rural parish vied with each other in delicate and considerate attentions to her. These last formed a little sewing circle that spent every Saturday afternoon with the invalid, and nile she read to them from some book, often from the Word of Life it- self, and enforced its truths by her own sad experience, they busily plied the needle to fashion the little garments and other articles of comfort necessary for the advent of the expected stranger. During these interviews the suf- ferer did not fail to enforce the necessity of personal piety as the only safeguard against temptations; and taught as her lessons were with great humility, and attested by the tears of sincere penitence, they produced the happiest ef-   THE BETRAYED*.        315 fects upon her young companions. It was not long before my study began to be visited by one and another of thein seeking counsel in the way to Zion, until now I can scarce think of a young female who has not set her feet upon the Rock of Ages. Thus is it, sir, that the All-Merciful de- lights to overrule even the base deeds of wicked mven for the happiness of others. There is a thought suggested in the fact worthy of profound reflection, But with all the generous sympathy given to the fair young disciple, and with the love her sweet disposition in- spired, her strength constantly diminished, and it became evident that she was dying. I deemed it right to commu- nicate the truth to her, and to advise her to avow her rel- atives that they might be informed of her situation, and become reconciled to her. I shall not readily forget the occasion, nor the results of it. In my usual Monday visit to her, I gently led her to talk upon the subject of death, and asked her if she thought her faith as reliant as the Psalmist's, when he said he could walk through the shad- owy valley and 'fear no evil.' She turned her full, lus- trous eyes upon me, with an expression of animated seri- ausness, and with deep solemnity inquired why I asked. I perceived at once that she suspected my motive, and deeming it always right to be frank at such a moment, I said to her, - "Maria, you must be conscious how much your strength has wasted, how feeble you are, and in the event which is before you, we feat for the result." I had anticipated some emotion at this, but not of the description that followed; her countenance remained per-   316       HOUSEHOLD TALES. fectly placid, but her eyes lighted with a glow of lambent joy, as she asked,- "Do you really think I shall die, sir?  "It seems'to all of your friends that such is most likely to be the result," I replied, unwilling to announce an ap- parent certainty in stronger terms. "Are you not likely to be mistaken?" she asked once more, still keeping her singularly lighted eyes upon me. I was deceived by the persistency of her questioning, supposing it to result from a lingering hope that it might not be so. Accordingly I answered with tenderness, but at the same time with an air of earnestness, telling her in decided language that her end was approaching. Her  face glowed with an angelic radiance, her eyes were suf- fused with delicious tears, and lifting them to Heaven as her hands were clasped upon her bosom, she cried in an ecstasy of joy, - "So soon in Heaven! Blessed Redeemer, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard my prayer, and wilt receive me un- to Thyself! Keep me patient Thine own good time, but come quickly, O come quickly!" In just such a buoyant, happy frame she continued for the remaining days of her life, appearing like one who is prepared for a pleasant voyage, and reluctantly submits to the delay in casting off the vessel. The Psalms and the Book of Revelation occupied much of her time, and she was earnest in acts of devotion, when she embalmned the memory of her absent mother with fervent prayers that were in themselves a benediction and a blessing. When not thus occupied, she spoke often to those about her, and   THE BETRAYED.        317 the constant theme of her lips was the grace of God, as shown toward her in providing her with friends, bringing her to a saving knowledge of the Truth as it is in Jesus, and leading her to immortal life, instead of continuing her in a world where she could only live to expiate her one great deed of shame. My efforts to discover her parentage, and to induce an avowal of the persorinand residence of the hard-hearted man who had betrayed her, met with no success. At my request she took the matter into consideration, and strove to decide it religiously; as I left her one day, she gave me a note, saying it related to the subject we had con- versed about, and was to be read only in my study. On reaching home I opened the Racket, but instead of the information I hoped and .expec ed, I found only the follow- ing words: -- "I have decided to die in the silence to which I sol- emnly pledged myself to one who I thought loved me. I know that it may be said that his desertion dissolves any obligation to consider him, but when I reflect upon my sinful weakness in yielding to unhallowed passion, I feel such condemnation for myself, that I dare not blame him for despising me, and can not betray him. When, in the future, he may know that his poor Maria died faithful to her word and to him, he may learn to have some respect for her memory, and perhaps repent of his own wrong and become a christian. My dear mother thinks me al- ready married, and why should I trouble her whole future life, and add sorrow to her already over-burdened heart, by giving her the knowledge of a daughter's infamy? It 27*   318       HOUSEHOLD TALES. could do no good, would embitter her existence, and per- haps bring her grey hairs to the grave. No, let me die unknown, and go, as I deserve to a nameless grave. If my life were to' be continued, or even that of my unborn babe, my duty might be different; but I feel a certain, in- expressible assurance that my Heavenly Father will take the innocent from evil to come. I have sought direction at the throne of Grace, and terrible as is the punishment, I feel that I ought to die unforgiven by those I love. I have filled the cup, and I ought to drink its bitter dregs. May I not ask that you will not refer to it again?" I was not altogether satisfied with her decision, espe- cially when the heart of a devoted woman excused her faithless seducer, to her own condemnation; and this went far to persuade me that she was mistaking morbid feeling for a sense of duty. I could not justify the deception in which her mother confessedly remained, and doubtless I should have shown the erring child her wrong views, had I not been providentially forbidden. The crisis was near at hand, and the next day she was too ill to be disturbed. She continued to sink, none but her nurses were allowed to see her, and three days ago she gave birth to an infant. As had been feared, she was unequal to the sufferings of the terrible hour, and looking upon the sweet immortal she had ushered into life, she prayed in a feeble voice, - "O my God, take this bud to Paradise!" Her soul seemed to breathe itself out in the aspiration, so fervently was it uttered. For several minutes she re- mained motionless, almost pulseless; then slightly reviv- ing, as if her thought in the last fluttering moment of life,   THE BETRAYED.        319 was upon the heartless author of her ruin; her lips-moved once more, and faintly dying whispers breathed, in broken pauses, the Savior's -dying prayer,- "Father, forgive him, -he knew not what he did!" The spirit' of the beautiful sufferer lingered only to of- 'fer the petition, and its flight was toward the Mercy-seat, where its, presence gladdened its sister seraphs, ere the Recording Angel had registered the wish. The infant looked out from Heaven only to withdraw its face again; the mother's prayer was answered, her premonition ful- filled; and you will see them slumbering in the same cof- fin, the bud nestling in the open bosom of the crushed blossom. One zephyr wafted their fragrance to Heaven, in a single breath." We had reached the well-remembered cottage, as the narrative was finished, and the clergyman paused a mo- ment to brush away manly tears and compose his emo- tion. Upon entering the dwelling I found it crowded by the villagers, and stifled sobs, and falling tears witnessed the pervading grief; all knew the sad story of illicit love, many had witnessed the attractive beauties of a peniten- tial faith, and every heart was a sincere mourner. At the side of the coffin a band of maidens were gathered, clothed in white garments, bedring sprigs of evergreen, in the place of flowers which the season denied them, while a wreath of it was festooned upon the open coffin itself. These were the weekly companions of the erring one, by whose example and entreaties they had been led to choose that better part which the Divine 'Master commended. They had loved hlle departed with a holy love.   320      HOUSEHOLD TALES. After a brief pause the venerable clergyman arose in the assembly, and advancing to the head of the slumber- er repeated, in a clear but-tremulous voice, the whole of that beautifully touching passage in the closing chapter of Ecclesiastes, beginning with the words- "Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years, draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them." I have listened to the voice of sacred eloquence, and witnessed its electric effect upon responsive multitudes, but never experienced the equal. solemnity of that lan- guage, under so moving circumstances; every ear was at- tentive, and every eye riveted upon the patriarch, who seemed like an inspired prophet, so deep was his own emo- tion and so solemn his manner. There was a silence of a moment, when the last words were pronounced, and the mind was carried forward to the 'judgment of every se- cret thing,' and then as if every soul shuddered at its re- ality, one universal burst of weeping filled the rooms. A simple prayer followed, the band of weeping maid- ens advanced to take a last look of their fallen sister, and after them the entire assembly ; among the last to inspect the lifeless features I approached, and once more gazed upon the face of the beautiful Maria. There she slum- bered, lovely even in dleath,-- that eternal frost upon the fair flower of humanity. The thick, dark locks were gath- ered back from the marble brow, an expression of pleas- antness dwelt on her still features, and upon her pulse- less bosom nestled the tiny form of the unnamed child. It was a sight that might move an angel's heart, and some   THE BETRAYED.        321 falling tear had rested upon the snowy cheek of the un- wedded mother, as if a seraph hovering over the slum- berer had left it there. The churchyard was at no great distance from the cot- tage, and the corpse was placed upon a bier and borne out by four of the elders; the maidens came next, occupying the place of absent relatives, while a long procession of the villagers followed in the rear. The measured toll- ing of the bell resounded, the crowd passed slowly away, and ere a brief hour had elapsed, ' dust to dust' had been surrendered, the branches of evergreen - fitting emblems of living memory - were deposited in the grave with the sleepers, and the beautiful Maria was left Amid the chills and damps Of the vast plain where Death encamps. A simple slab of marble was placed for the headstone, as a last tribute of love from the white-robed maidens, which is at once a memorial and a pillar of warning to the fair young mountaineers, as they many a time and oft rehearse the story suggested by the touching inscription upon its face, where are chiseled the simple words--  MARIA, THE 'BETRAYED. Some years subsequent to these incidents it was my fortune to be on board a steamer plying between Provi- dence and New York, bound to the latter city. The ves- sel was out upon the sound, and the calm summer even- ing made the fresh sea-breeze and the coming sunset de- lightful tothe senses. For the purpose of enjoying the salubrity of one and the splendors of the other, I left the   822       HOUSEHOLD TALES. stifling atmosphere of the saloons, and seated myself on the deck. Many persons, of both sexes, were about me, and as the evening hastened on, I became absorbed in a dreamy enjoyment, from which I was roused by a heavy, sorrowing sigh that called my attention, and looking up I observed an elderly female sitting near me, while every other person had left the deck. There was a striking at- traction in the expression of her countenance, and an in- stant impression followed that she was not altogether a stranger. This feeling necessarily caused me to scan her features scrutinizingly, in doing which I attracted her no- tice, and to apologize for my apparent rudeness I ventured to address her; as I did so she closed a small-locket upon which she had been looking, and still held. "Pardon the intrusion, madam," I said to her, "but I think we have met before." She answered politely, but with the same air of melan- choly I had first observed, - 'It is possible, sir, though I think not. I am not apt to forget features, and yours are new to me." "I can hardly explain why," I replied, "but your coun- tenance impresses me with an idea of familiarity; still, I do not recognize the tones of your voice." "I fear if you had known me formerly you would not recognize me now," she continued. " Grief has made rough work with me, and I am much changed. I was just ooking at the miniature of one who was once my idol, for he sea always brings her. vividly to mind, and there is a orrowful pleasure in contemplating the element in which he lost her life. This is all that remains to me of a once   THE BETRAYED.        323 beloved and devoted child! I think her countenance ex- pressive of her nature." Thus saying she handed me the picture, and gave way to a passionate burst of weeping. As I looked upon the face which the limaner had traced upon the ivory, the familiarity of the bereaved mother's features was at once explained; I held in my hand the miniature of' the beau- tiful Maria, in the full glow of health, innocence and hap- piness! I was deeply moved, and for a moment not a lit- tle embarrassed; but as her reference to the ocean came to my thought, I perceived that she was ignorant of the place and manner of her daughter's death, and to guide me in the course I ought to pursue I inquired concerning the particulars of her loss. As if reluctant to communi- cate her sorrows to a stranger, she replied- - "The soul loves to keep its bitter fountains sealed, sir. AMaria was of an impressible nature. and when away from home influences was unhappily led into a clandestine mar- riage with a man who doubtless loved her, but who viola- ted the duties of manhood in persuading a young girl to leave her school, betray the confidence of loving hearts, and plant thornd where roses grew before. They fled to a distant part of the country, and after a few weeks of un- settled life, my poor child was lost from a steamer, and perished in the waves. George sought my forgiveness, with a penitent spirit; and although he had desolated my heart and my life, I forgave him, even as I hope in God for my child's salvation. But he bears alout with him a burden of woe, and is a living victim of remorse. He is as if a spirit haunted him, and often seems insane." : '      r   324       HOUSEHOLD TALES. I have never felt fully satisfied that I did right, but in spite of my abhorrence of the reprobate hypocrisy of the heartless villain who could plan such desolating wicked- ness, and shield himself behind the new infamy of false- hood, I could not disabuse the desolate woman, but felt a satisfaction in knowing that the mother rested in a harm- less delusion. With some trite words of comfort I left her; but the interest these incidents in the life of stran- gers had excited still exists, for after allowing for the em- bellishments of recital, the reader may rest assured that Truth, weeping, tells the mournful tale.   THE   SKIPPER'S     DAUGHTER. A TALE OF THE OLD COLONY. OUR aim is happiness; 'tis yours, 'tis mine; He said; 'tis the pursuit of all that live, Yet few attain it, if 't was e'er attained; But they the widest wander from the mark, Who thro' the flow'ry paths of sauntering joy Seek this coy goddess. ARMSTRONG. GUILT hears appall'd with deeply troubled thought; And yet not always on the guilty head Descends the fated flash.     THOMSON. A CENTURY and a quarter ago the colonies of New England were in a state of the utmost excitement, as the result of war which broke out anew, between the rival powers of England and France in 1744. The war of 'good Queen Anne' had been terminated by the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the same year in which she died, and from that period, extending through thirty years, the set- tlements had been rapidly progressing in resources, wealth and energy. The people at large had been by no means enfeebled by the constant struggles for power between the reigning sovereigns of the Stuart family and -themselves, 28   326       HOUSEHOLD TALES. nor from the jealousies and disputes that followed with the house of Brunswick, even from the accession of the first George.' Still they were loyal and patriotic, and did not dream of opposition to crown prerogatives except so far as was necessary to secure their own rights and lib- erties undisturbed and unquestioned. They were ever ready to enter warmly into every ex- pedition of peril and daring, however originated, if it had their own protection for its end, even very remotely. It was not without the most violent indignation, then, that the good people of the colony of the Bay heard of the surprise of the little English garrison at Canseau, by the French, who had destroyed the fisheries, demolished the fort, razed the buildings, and captured eighty men, whom they had closely confined as prisoners of war, within the strong fortress of Louisburg. These captives were all citizens of Massachusetts, some having been enlisted sol- diers, and some hardy fishermen from the port of Marble- head, who were peaceably pursuing their vocation of cap- turing and curing the finny tribes of the deep. The out- rage seemed the greater to the colonists, as they had no knowledge of a declaration of war between the rival na- tions; beside, the recovery of the post was of great mo- ment, since the French inhabitants of the aggressive prov- ince were sixteen thousand in number, and by a probable alliance with hostile Indians the revolters might place France in repossession of her ancient colony. Such an event would only be the precursor of scenes of carnage, devastation and cruelty along the frontiers, of the most frightful and revolting description.   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.     327 The news of the disaster spread like wild-fire through the towns and hamlets, and over the scattered hills and valleys, and coming war was prophesied as inevitable. The black cloud was visibly apparent, and already the deep mutterings of its hollow thunder could almosi be heard, in the incensed beatings of Anglo-Saxon hearts. i Governor Shirley proposed an expedition for the reduc- tion of Louisburg, and his projects were enthusiastically seconded by brave and sturdy men, till frequent public assemblies were held, densely thronged and highly ani- mated. He had promptly solicited aid from England, and the hardy yeomen of the interior, the sunburnt fishermen of the sea-shores, -and the inhabitants of the commercial towns were alike urged to array themselves in troops, for a patriotic and honorable part in the campaign. It was in the early autumn of 1744, at a deliberative gathering on this topic, in the old town of Boston, that an exciting scene was witnessed. Sir Henry Frankland, the collector of the port, was addressing the assembly. He was a man well calculated to impress his views upon an audience, and carry the multitude along with him, even if his ideas did not altogether commend themselves to the judgment. His figure was noble, his countenance impres- sive, and his whole air and bearing attractive and popular. His address was elegant and courtly, for he had been bred amid lords and gentlemen, and from his earliest in- fancy had been familiar with scenes and circles about the throne of England, till he had himself become the expo- nent of a refined and graceful ease. His education was in advance of his time, and with a natural eloquence he   328       HOUSEHOLD TALES, understood well the art of moving men's hearts, whether in social converse or in public harangue. Farther than all these personal endowments, he was possessed of im- mense wealth, which he lavished like a Prince, while he was the recipient of/noble titles that gave him elevated station and official dignity; and however much men may cavil at these artificial distinctions of society, they do, nevertheless, pay homage to them, and yield to their pos- sessors the exercise of potent influence. These combined causes gave Sir Henry a commanding power over his fellow townsmen, and his official position lent strength to his counsels. It may well be supposed, then, that he held his audience in attention, while he por- trayed the character of the proposed enterprise, rehearsed the evils to follow from inaction, pictured the glowing scenes of conquest, and foreshadowed a speedy victory and a triumphant return. Still, the 'expedition was by no means popular, and was extensively regarded as des- perate in its nature, and of- doubtful utility,; the House of Representatives had obstinately opposed it, in spite of the Governor's urgency, and very many men of position per- sistently strove to thwart the warlike demonstrations. In such a conjuncture of circumstances the most gifted ora- tor might have failed to bring the mass of the people to decisive action; and such doubtless would have been the royal collector's experience, but for providential aid. In the midst of one of his most impassioned appeals he was suddenly interrupted; a young female burst into the hall and pressed through the crowd, with long, black hair flowing wildly over her shoulders, a pale and weary   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.     -329 countenance greatly excited, her feet bare, and her gar- ments covered with the dust of travel, indicating her ar- rival, by wearisome toil, from the country. The throng made way for the singular being to pass, and pressing to the speaker's platform she stood directly in front of the astounded knight. An almost audible silence reigned as the girl looked round upon the citizens, and with an ex- pression of scorn in her really beautiful face, she began to address the deliberating multitude. "Where is the spirit of Englishmen," she cried, " when you stand idly waiting in cold debate, and suffer your fa- thers and your brethren to groan and starve in captivity with the cowardly Franks! Why do you not rush to the rescue, and like true Saxon soldiers force -the pirate bands to yield their captives, their spoils, and their strongholds? Are the sons of brave men become- cravens by inaction, and cowards through long-continued peace? I am my father's only child, and I only lament that Heaven made me not a man! - Then could I avenge the wrongs and in- sults he has been doomed to suffer, were it single-handed and alone! Three months ago he left the waters of the Bay the skipper of his own craft, which he had earned by honest industry, toiling early and late, that he might in his old age be released from labor, and see his daughter rescued from poverty. Peaceably pursuing his humble vocation he had caught and cured his cargo, and after a weary summer he should have returned laden with thp tribes of the sea, to supply your wants, and by fair- re- turns realize profits sufficient to prevent another season's exposure to the perils of the fisherman's life. But what 28    330      HOUSEHOLD TALES. have we been told? The old man, with scores of his fel- lows, is suddenly surprised and captured; he is ignomin- iously thrust into prison at Louisburg, where half-starved and pining for liberty, he counts the days when your can- nons should shake the fortress and bring him deliverance. And you -ye degenerate men, ye stand disputing about proprieties, while the old fisherman's cargo is seized or' destroyed, his craft in the hands of your enemies, him- self a captive and his daughter a beggar! And what is true of him is true of others; your neighbors, your sons and your brothers. Shame! shame! If your veins held the blood 6f your fathers no power on earth could delay you from marching to the scene of outrage, to revenge the'wrong to your people and the insult to your King!" The effect upon the auditors was perfectly electrical, as they listened to the damsel, whose beauty captivated as much as her words inspired; for the excitement had re- stored her natural color and animation, and her half ex- posed bosom heaved in a voluptuous tumult. One loud burst of applause greeted her as she finished speaking, and a wild enthusiasm took possession of the host. The sound of the plaudits had scarcely ceased, when there arose a cry of gladness, rolling on from the distant street, as if it were the echo of that within. It came nearer and nearer, loud huzzas resounded, and at length it burst upon the ears of the listening people in one exultant shout of joyous welcome, and the moment after, the whole band of the captive Englishmen entered the hall. They had ar- rived within the town opportunely, having been liberated on parole, and after the hearty welcome from the citizens   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.      331 without, were conducted in a body to the crowded, assem- bly. The result was magical; enthusiasm rose to the ut- most height; soiled and dilapidated garments, and the to- kens of suffering exhibited in emaciated forms and cadav- erous countenances, were better incentives to patriotic de- votion than argument, and the hearts of the multitude were all a-glow for warlike exploit. The singular female wasa not the least moved by the new events, for as she stood in almost petrifying astonishment gazing upon the. liberated captives as they filed into the hall, the quick eye of filial love detected the dear old sun-burnt cheek of the only man she loved, and she rushed to his arms. "My father,--my father!" were the only words she ut- tered, while the hardy veteran of the sea wept speechless upon her neck as he folded her to his heart. Alice McGrath, who arrested attention in so sudden a burst of passionate eloquence, was a being of rare loveli- ness, notwithstanding the plight in which she appeared to the citizens. She wasi one of those happy creations that throw sunlight about them, in whatever guise you meet them, and yet you can hardly tell how or why. She was of Scotch des'cent, as her name indicates, and her uncom- monly fine figure gave no disgrace to the stock from which she sprung, while the contour of her face was nearly per- feet, and her full black eyes let you at once into the lab- oratory of her soul, where you seemed to see the fire burn in its spiritual transmutations of thought and feeling. A peculiarly inexpressible charm was added to these person- al graces, by the wild waving of her long black hair, the glowing beauty of her impassioned face, and the romance   332      .HOUSEHOLD TALES. of her undress and unexpected entrance into the assembly. Nor were the impressions she had-made at all lessened in the end, for she departed as mysteriously as she came; in company with her father she quietly withdrew from the i excited crowd,.and when the meeting separated nothing could be learned of the returned skipper and his romantic daughter, beyond the fact that the schooner he had lost originally sailed from Marblehead. From that hour the Expedition to Louisburg was a de- termined fact of history;i the various incidents had exci- ted public feeling to a flaming intensity, and it was used to compass the end desired, The dismissed captives gave accurate information of the condition of the fortress and its military strength; of the plans of the enemies of Eng- land; and detailed much knowledge important to the con-s summation of the exploit. Shirley's recommendations were now more zealously defended, and his proposed meas- ure at length passed the House; Massachusetts, Connecti- cut and New Hampshire sent troops into the field, and before the close of the following March, a determined ar- my of nearly five thousand men left the town, under the command of General Pepperell. What the corps lacked in numbers it more than equalled in brave devotion, and when on the seventeenth of June, just thirty years before the Battle of Bunker Hill, it acted in conjunction with the naval force under Admiral Warren, the reduction and capture of Louisburg heralded to the world one of the most brilliant achievements of American-arms. Sir Henry Frankland was a bachelor, and a man who gave great scandal to the straight-minded people among   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.      333 whom he dwelt, by his gayeties and gallantries. The in- cident which had interrupted his eloquence had a proba- bly greater effect upon the knight than upon any of the plebeians; for he had been interested in the personal at- tractions of the female more than in anything she uttered, however much he may have recognized an enthusiasm that foreshadowed no lack of genius. He was quite unscru- pulous in his amours, gratifying his tastes and his passions with so much respect to reputation as the circumstances seemed to demand, but with no regard to morality. The vision of physical perfections upon which his eyes had so tantalizingly gazed for the moment, had in truth inflamed his soul, and the little god Cupid entered the fortifications of his heart, while he should have been plotting the down- fall of those of Louisburg; and from that hour his mind was much oftener occupied with the determination to cap- ture the daughter of the unknown skipper, than in antici- pating the fall of the 'Gibraltar of America.' But in all direct efforts to discover her he was unsuccessful; the re- turned citizens were soon scattered over the colonies, and no one with whom he met could give him the name of the father, nor direct him to the retreat of the daughter. The fishermen of Marblehead, interrupted in their usu- al avocations by the preparations for the approaching war, entered earnestly into, the belligerant spirit. Great num- bers enlisted in Pepperell's forces, as well from policy as from principle, want of occupation forcing them to adopt the trade of a soldier to obtain support for themselves and families whom they loved better than self. Among these was skipper McGrath, who had been reduced to actual   334       HOUSEHOLD TALES. poverty, and who entered the ranks of the recruits with a desperate purpose to avenge himself in fighting for his country. The fair Alice, in the meanwhile, had no other way of livelihood than to put herself at service with such of the fortunate class of citizens as could live themselves and furnish employment to others In those early days such service was no dishonor to the young females of the land, nor should it ever be, There is no patent of nobil- ity so honorable as that which comes from Labor, which dates beyond all other titles, even to that proud day when the Almighty created Man in His own image,--and made him a Gardener! Many proud scions of American aristocracy, falsely as- sumed,--who turn up their scornful noses at the sight of a noble mechanic, and would have the world reverence laziness and money squandering, with supercilious con- tempt for honest industry,-might well reflect that their on- ly title to endurance is derived from the merits of a grand- father who honorably achieved competency by laboring at the plow and the muck-heap, wooing his buxom mate at the kitchen fire in the happy winter evenings, after she had finished her menial duties of maid-of-all-work to the suito's mother! Poor insignificant simpletons are all they who ignore their origin, hiding their ancestors, as the silly ostrich conceals his head, and think a good-natured world does not pity them for the uncomeliness they have left exposed! Upon business of an official nature, Sir Hemny visited the pleasant old town of Marblehead some weeks succeed- ing the departure of the troops; his only conveyance was   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.      335 by means of saddle-horses, and towards noon of a warm day in May he might have been seen upon a mettlesome steed, coursing along over the rocky road-way, till he ap- proached the homely inn, that offered very limited prom- ise of entertainment to a man of his expectations. He attracted much notice as he passed along, for the fur- niture that caparisoned his horse Was unusually showy, and the knight himself was arrayed in a style of elegance very infrequent. As he rode up to the little public house, the landlord officiously appeared, held the horse, as the cavalier dismounted, and opening the outer door of the dwelling shouted up the stairway,- "Here, leave your suds girl, and stir alive to brush up the west room a bit. Here's a quality stranger to be en- tertained, and them folks leave silver blessings! Walk, in, my lord, if a lord ye be, and swallow a glass of Ma- deira to the welcome of the house, while the wench puts the room to rights a bit!" * The traveler stepped inside of the door as invited, and as he did so a female form glided out of the passage, in retreat from the stairs which she had been scrubbing, and the passing figure displayed an elegant shape, to which a crown of luxuriant black hair; and the exposure of naked feet added considerable piquancy. The glimpse was but momentary, yet sufficient to excite curiosity, while it sug- gested to the titled libertine the queen-like being whom he had seen under more exciting circumstances. He in- stantly determined to tarry with the blunt publican long enough to make fuller discoveries, and following the host I to the tap-room he drank the proffered liquor, ordered his ,?   336      HOUSEHOLD TALES. horse to be stalled, and bespoke a dinner for himself. In the interim of its preparation he sauntered out to the vil- lage, accomplished his mission, and returned to the inn. Alice McGrath, for she it was, had recognized the ora- tor whom she had formerly interrupted, as-soon as he had appeared in the door-yard, and felt a very natural shrink- ing from being recognized in turn. It was therefore with a sincere repugnance to the duty that she found herself under the necessity of serving at table, when she intended to avoid his presence and give no opportunity for recog- pition; but to avert as much as possible, the probability of this, under the exposure to which she would be subject, she spent an unusual time at her simple toilet, arrayed her hair in new fashion, and flattered herself that she was successfully disguised. She soon found her mistake, for when the guest entered the room, his quick eye per- ceived her through her holiday attire, and found her lack- ing in none of the charms with which his imagination had clothed her; with his -most courtly phrase he familiar- ly addressed her, and the proud representative of aristo- cratic England was thenceforth a suitor to the fair beauty of the country inn. The hour spent at his solitary dinner-table, with the -damsel in attendance, furnished a rare opportunity for an advance in his purposes.- He found her by no means de- void of mental endowments in correspondence with her personal attractions; her lively wit displayed itself in a thousand sallies; her native good sense shone forth in re- peated observations, and her uncultivated intellect devel- oped a strength which only needed polish to make it re-   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.      337 markable; while she seemed to possess such strong sym- pathies, and earnest feeling, that she only required oppor- tunity, to make her one of the most fascinating of wo- men. The knight was thoroughly captivated. From the termination of that hour's interview the en- amored lover determined to win the prize that accident had thus thrown in his way, and fortune seemed to favor his purposes. Her father fell in the assault upon Louis- burg, and the destitute orphan, in consequence, more easily yielded to the blandishments that wealth and sta- tion proffered with artful advances, and ere long she be- came an inmate of his household. Once established there his purposes rushed to fulfillment; the false glare of the allurements of a passionate lover, who breathed an intox- icating incense into charmed ears, and the fascinations of a life of luxury, were eloquently used with her by the friend of the notables, and even of royalty itself, and the stern convictions of right were overborne; she yielded to his seductions, and became the unwedded companion of the noble fornicator. A hundred years ago the physical, as well as the polit- ical status of the Puritan-City was quite another affair from what it is at this day. All there was of grandeur and of magnificence in fashionable life displayed itself at the 'North End,' then the court part of the town. Here the royal governor resided, and until a very recent period the residence of Hutchinson could be pointed -out, a monu- ment of the old days,- - a connecting link between the Past and, the Present. But the spirit of speculation, the vandal spirit of the age, has lifted its hand against the 29   3388      EOUSEHOLD TAL!:8S. ancient edifice, and the vestiges of it are all swept away;. and well for the people is it, if with the irreverence man- ifested toward these relics of the fathers, that better spir- it of our ancestors be not obliterated with them. There is an inspiration of healthy sentiment to be found in a com- munion with the dwellings of departed worthies, and one can but feel regret at the rapidity with which they disap- pear. May those that remain be held sacred. The residence of Sir Henry Frankland was in close proximity to that of His Excellency, and in an imposing mansion in what is now known as Charter street, the frail beauty was surrounded with every luxury that wealth can purchase, every enjoyment that sensuality can devise, and eBtry appliance that refinement can suggest. Instructors in science and accomplishments were furnished her, and her native capabilities became resplendent under culture, till she was the :acknowledged goddess of grace, the en- throned deity of fashionable life. But no splendors of station; no adulation of obsequi- ous sycophants; and no indulgence in sensual pleasures can for any long time beguile a soul so as to stifle the up- braidings of a guilty conscience. It is ani experiment ful- ly tested, and with the same invariable result; no wrong, no meanness, no sin, can be purged from the soul except through suffering and life-long expiation. So surely as the dazzled insect of a summer's evening falls scorched and wingless beneath the'blaze that fascinated but to kill, the fated soul that follows :the lure of sinful pleasure, darinig the blaze that blinds, will fall wounded, blasted or ruined by the fiery- contact. There is, there can be no es-   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.-     339 cape from this immutable law of justice, and they only are wise who avoid its penalties. In the midst of her surfeit of unholy pleasures, the err- ing woman felt her appetite pall, and the fascinations of sin vanished as soon as their corrupting power wrought its conquest. .The knight loved his paramour with an in- fatuation that knew but obne limit, and that was the fear of the false judgment of aristocracy which makes it a dis- grace to wed one born in poverty. Every kindness that his nature could lavish, and honors unusual in such rela- tions were delicately given, and Sir Henry was never sa- tiated with her society, nor weary of her charms. Still, no caressing could palliate her, sense of degradation, no variety of pleasures still the voice of an aroused- con- science, whose faithful accusations echoed through the dis- mal chambers of -her soul, and the great man's mistress, envied by thousands, was the unhappiest victim of con- tinual remorse. Nor was this all; the correct tone of that vigorous mor-. al sentiment which has ever exerted a benign influence upon our metropolitan community, since the stern demand for reforms in social life was made by the early Puritans, was grossly shocked and outraged by such unhallowed as- sumption of matrimonial privileges. While the damsel passed as a simple protege of the knight, to whom he de- voted impulsive generosities and allowable gallantries, he was not only excused in them, but even respected for his presumed devotion to the homeless orphan of a poor man. The lovely subject of his attentions was in corresponding degree noticed, courted and flattered; no fashionable as-   3340     'HOUSEHOLD: TALES.  sembly was complete unless she graced it; no devotee to Pleasure, of either sex, anything but a neophyte that did not boast her intimacy and enter her drawing rooms. She was feted and flattered, and for a season reigned supreme in: attractive beauty, honored in all societies, and the cen-  ter around which a little world of admirers revolved. But there came a change; the flimsy disguises of pre- tended platonism became transparent, even to the dullest comprehension; the scandal of house servants took wings and flew hither and thither, producing its natural effects. First came averted looks, and the cutting notice of inten- tional neglect; then followed rude speeches, and ruder looks of disdain, all rendered more effectively poignant by the remembrance of adulation previously bestowed, and the consciousness of retributive justice more bitter than all. Brilliant, accomplished, fascinating, and susceptible, she-was at length utterly deserted, spurned from every household, and the frequent recipient of taunts and insult. She: lost her lightsome humor, became sad and desponding, and dwelt in lonely grandeur a bitter misanthrope. There':is something fearful in the terrible condemnation which the World visits upon an erring woman. There is no fiery ordeal to which society subjects the transgressor that compares with it, and a miracle it is if one who has swerved from the path of chastity can, even with a peni- tential spirit, live down the. terrible maledictions of her own sex. To such an one there seems-a malign influence in every suggestion, and the almost inevitable end is a bold defiance of restraint, while a fiendish pleasure in the down- fall of others succeeds. However uncharitable this fact   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.      341 may show the world to be, and whatever may be the so- lution, such is the truth; and it suggests a fearful weight of guilt upon those who tempt virtue to its destruction, and transform angels into fiends. The stern reprobation of a chaste public opinion was not, however, visited alone upon the suffering woman who had become the accomplice of the nobleman; it was dem- onstrated to him in different ways, -and in spite of wealth and station, he was made so often to feel the disesteem in Wvhich his conduct was held, that unable to endure the dis- quiet occasioned by his criminal life, he was compelled to abandon his town residence, and seek a retreat in the un- disturbed solitudes of the interior. It is only just to re- cord, as a remarkable instance of faithful devotion, that in all the opprobrium cast upon him, and in all the igno- minious reproach that she endured, no wavering in attach- ment ever caused the unhappy Alice to doubt his love, or question his voluntary fealty to her charms. Indeed, as other society failed her, he increased the attractions of his own; and as conventional pleasures were withdrawn he strove to create happiness for her, at any cost, by the sur- roundings of her daily life. It was a vain effort, for the ghost of Wrong forbade it, though it were pursued with the love of an enthusiast. There is no spot in New England that surpasses in qui- et, rural beauty the diversified town of Ashand, situated twenty-five miles from Boston, at the junction of two un- pretending water-courses, known as Sudbury River and Cold Spring Brook. Its surrounding hills stretching up- ward and outward at every point of the compass, its en- 29    342       HOUSEHOLD TALES. virons of wild woodland scenery, its extended valleys, and its rushing waters make it attractive in many aspects. It is just the- spot where the man of taste and culture would love to make a quiet home, and spend the evening of his days amid the music of waterfalls, the hum of in- dustry, or the -sequestered retirement of forest life, with the spiritual melody of summer birds to woo him to pleas- ant reveries. One can apply the language of Goldsmith with almost literal significance to this 'lovely village of the- plain,' and like that enchanting Poet of Nature,- Pause on every charm, The sheltered cot, the cultivated farm, The never failing brook, the busy mill, The modest church beside the murmuring rill, The rocks and woodlands with their grateful shade, Where coyish maids with rural lovers strayed, And listened, wondering, to the tales of eld, When famed Sir Henry here his revels held, And Lady Alice sought retreat to find From life's worst ill-a self-accusing mind! Within the present boundaries of this modern town it was that Sir Henry Frankland sought a refuge for the unhappy associate of his guilt, where the promptings of unhallowed love might be indulged, beyond reach of the censure of moralists, or the cold neglect of indignant vir- tue, which leaves a keener sting than denunciation. A spirit:of defiance is roused by the latter, and one may op- pose himself to it in a desperate 'tongue fence;' but the former comes over the soul like a blight and mildew, and frets the spirit like a canker, till strength and life decay. The knight purchased an extensive domain in what at that day was included in the township of Hopkinton, and  \    THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.      343 erected within its retreats a mansion of unsurpassed ele- gance, surrounding it with evidences of a luxurious taste. The towering trees of the primeval forest overshadowed the broad avenues that were hewn out of the very bosom of the wood, and oaks, maples and elms interlaced their lofty branches, whose emerald crests furnished scenes of appropriate beauty in summer, while the autumn changes arrayed them in varied splendors. Through such ap- proaches, winding among leafy groves and flowering thick- ets, was one led to the dwelling. Here the customs of baronial ancestors were maintained, anld the feudal castles of the days of chivalry were the models for imitation. Studs of horses neighed in the stalls, and packs of hounds bayed inii the kennel; feast and revelry ruled within the lordly walls, and sumptuous banquets attracted pleasure- loving men, and beautiful women not over scrupulous, to wake in, the dim aisles of the solemn wood, the echoes of jollity and mirth. At suitable times the huntsman's horn resounded,   and steed and hound joined in exciting sports of the chase, when the forests abounded in game, and the red fox dug his hole in every hill-side. Thus years went by, and the princely mansion of the forest was the appa- rent temple of Pleasure, where lordly guests were neither infrequent nor scrupulous. During this period a son was born to the unwedded parents, whose name is duly registered upon the ancient records of the town, and in spite of the corrupting influ-  ence that surrounded his early years, his manhood showed him to have been carefully trained, while his sentiments led him to act with noble impulses. He early entered 4,   344       HOUSEHOLD TATLS*. the British navy, rising -in rank till he received a cap- taints commission, and giving promise of reaching any station within the aim of a brave man, devoted to his profession. Still, love of country was stronger with him than the love of fame, and though a faithful royalist he would not bear arms against the countrymen of his moth- er, but at the breaking out of the war of the American Revolution, he magnanimously renounced his commission, with all his aspirations for glory, in preference to a hostile attitude toward the land of his birth. Such a man was a nobleman by nature, if not by legitimate birth. The Lady Alice, as she was usually styled, surfeited with-all appliances to pleasure, still realized that it is be- yond the power of wealth, or the rapid transition of vo- luptuous indulgence, to cheat retribution of its victim, or quiet a mind troubled by consciousness of transgression. She felt these truths with bitter poignancy, and after her son had left the paternal roof, her melancholy assumed a permanent form, and she lived in pitiable suffering. Ev- er ready to afford happiness to her in everythirng but the single act of justice that alone could do it, the knight proposed a voyage to Europe, vainly imagining that new excitements, and the changes of travel could heal a sin-sick soul. Accordingly the house of revels was de- serted, the horses no longer stood in the vacant stables, and hound and mastiff disported no more in the neglected avenues; the wild fox possessed his burrows in peace, and the (ancient, solitary reign' of silence was again -estab- lished in the woodland solitudes. They sought the sea- board, embarked in a return ship, and safely landed upon   THE SKiIPPER S DAUGHTER.     345 the shores of the old world. Here again the same bitter chalice-:was commended to loathing-lips, for the giddy at- tractiveness of fashionable follies ended as& before, and the high-born dames of British society, in their- turn learned  to firown upon one who too openly held the .mirror to their. frequent practises. The American beauty experienced more acutely than ever mortification that was righteously the fruit of seed she had voluntarily planted, and still fly- ing from the ghost that pursued them' with equal steps, other lands and other societies attracted the transgressors with the deceitful promise of a refuge from remorse. As a location that seemed congenial to the object in view, Sir Henry sought from the crown an appointment as Consul General to the kingdom of Portugal. His sov- ereign readily granted the boon, and thither he repaired with the devoted Lady Alice, an inseparable companion. In that land of passionate loves and easy virtue, for a time they found rest and contentment. A beautiful villa in the environs of the city of Lisbon, afforded them the allurements of, home, and the common laxity of morals ollwe'd the indulgence of their Illicit connection without accompanying it with stigma and ostracism. No outraged mother turned from the northern beauty lest her exam- ple should corrupt fair daughters, in whose Andalusian veins warm blood tinged the cheek with swarthy charms; no proud daughter avoided her lest intimacy with a volup- tuary should render herself suspected ; and no wife kept aloof from her through fear of countenancing intrigue. Gay abandonment to pleasure characterized all classes of people, and prince and courtier were only too much infat- 9   ,  ^ '   346      HOUSEHOLD TALES. uated in- their own dissolute!liaisons - to observe or care -forthe obliquities of others. The appreciating lovers en- -tered with zest into the universal devotion to passional gratification, and Fortune seemed at length to have lulled them to a blissful peace. But the pleasantest, sunniest hours of life, like sultry days before a tempest, are often precursors of disaster; and the most alluring of gross pleasures are, not infre- quently, a veil that hides coming destruction. One day the Consul left his villa for the gay capital of the mercurial people, arrayed with every decoration that pomp or place allowed him, and the floating of national ensigns, the far off peal of -music, and the pervading air of circumstance betokened some unusual ceremony. His splendid equipage glittered in the southern sun, and -the courtly trappings well befitted horses that seemed to step with conscious pride. He was on his way to unite with other ambassadors, to accompany king and court in the celebration of high mass at the cathedral. It was a day when human power was about to insult the Divine, by as- suming hypocritical acts of devotion and-attitudes of pre- tended humility, while ostentatious pride swelled haughty bosoms that defied the Deity and flouted at His power. It was an hour of empty forms and solemn mockery. Clearly the sun shone, and the very heavens glowed with gorgeous magnificence, save a dull, dense cloud of a singular hazy, purple hue that seemed to have floated up the zenith in ominous portent, so suddenly that men began to look upon each other with pale-lipped fear. The knight urged on his horses and entered the city, where terror al-   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.      347 ready began to drive the frighted populace hither and:thith- er, when suddenly there was a deep, hollow, tremulous sound as of groaning thunder. It was repeated at short -intervals, each time louder than before, a murky, suffoca- ting vapor shot heavenward from the heart of the doomed city, like smoke from an enormous furnace. The founda- tions of the solid land trembled, the panic-stricken people rushed hither and thither, and one long, dreadful, desola- ting cryof agony swelled out upon the sulphurous air, appealing to Heaven for mercy in the terrible visitation. It was the great earthquake, that buried alive more than thirty thousand warm, beating, human hearts, and the in- sane pomp and pride of tinsel grandeur was surpassed by a single nod of Jehovah's power. The king's celebration appeared then the mockery it was, and priest and ruler, serf and noble, knelt in equal honor, and side by side, ron naked pavement, called on God in desperate humility! As the frightened Consul pursued his way, doubting in his course, the horrible sounds reverberated upon an at- mosphere so still at times that Nature seemed to have become silent to listen. Then the pavements of the city broke -into waves before him, the ground heaved, yawning chasms opened into the bosom of the earth, and in the shock of the direful catastrophe tower and temple, prison and palace, cathedral and convent, uplifted from their po- sitions reeled like toys in a pantomime, and came crushing down in terrifie ruin. Groans, and shrieks, and howlings of wild despair mingled in horrid dissonance, from frantic multitudes, and the calamities that Providence permitted were rendered still more excruciating by the glut of hu- *   348      HOUSEHOLD TALES.- man-revenge. Multitudes of felons were liberated-by the mira6ulous agency that shook down their' prison walls, and freed from chains and manacles the inhuman wretches seized upon that hideous hour to wreak most fiendish ven- geance upon the fated city. They rushed the streets in hellish glee, scattered blazing fire-brands, and' kindled flames -at every combustible point, till one wide-spread conflagration devastated the fallen capital. It was an hour awful beyond portrayal, and the power of the Al- mighty and-the machinations of depraved men seemed to contend together.' The destruction of Sodom could scarce- ly have surpassed :the horrors of the scene. ' The terror-stricken knight leaped from his shattered carriage at the instant when his maddened horses plunged down one of the hideous chasms that opened at their feet. With fearful activity he vaulted across the gulf, reached the steps of a building, and began to feel hopes of escape from imminent ruin; but he had scarcely gained a foot- hold when a niew concussion burst upon his ears, the vi- bration; shook him to the ground, and with a fearful look upward'he saw the building above rent in twain, the ruins fell-crumbling:about him, the earth heaved, and down, down: he sank, into the black abyss! - :The Lady Alice had borne no part in the senseless pa- eantries of the day, and remained alone at the villa. Ed- ucated a Protestant, she had felt a repugnance to any par- ticipation in religious mockeries, and tradition asserts her to have- been restrained by a strong presentiment, of com- inglevil.' As the carriage of -her lordly companion dis- appeared from her sight, -she sat in somber reflections dc.-   THE SKIPPER S DAUGHTER.      349 laying her toilet from listless indecision; suddenly the pe- ctiliar rumble that preceded the earthquake arrested her attention, and simultaneously with it a sickening, suffoca- ting sensation almost overpowered her. Rising with con- vulsive effort she rushed from the dwelling, only to see a pall as of death hang over the neighboring city, and to hear the appalling lamentations of agonizing victims min- gled with the giant groans of the ruptured earth. For- getful of her own danger, with the instinct of woman's na- ture, on, on she rushed, in desperate search for him she loved. Away over dusty roads, through flying crowds of frantic citizens, by falling ruins, and among crushed forms of beauty and of strength, leaping horrible gulfs lighted by the flames that raged below, on, on she sped, as if im- pelled by invisible powers. Her sandals had fallen unno- ticed from her feet, and wounds unconsciously received left a bloody imprint at every step; her undress exposed her palpitating bosom, and her unconfined tresses streamed wildly upon the air behind her. Away intothe fallen city, with ruin, and death, and chaotic tumult on every sido, she directed her steps, and began the search for the missing knight. Long and awful was the anxiety that ac- companied her in her desolate labor, and the departing day began its crepuscular reign, with no success to the de- voted woman. Despair took possession of her heart, and wringing her hands in desperation she sat down exhausted upon a pitiable heap of rubbish ; at length giving way to grief she wept at the moving sights about her. By chance she gazed down an abyss that lay gaping a few feet in advance of her, and starting up she uttered a piercing 30   850      HOUSEHOLD TALES. hriek of horror. A fragment of a crushed carriage at- tracted, her gaze, and she discovered the well-known arms of Sir Henry Frankland emblazoned on the panel! Lady Alice naturally imagined that the place of his bur- ial was indicated by the relics of the disaster that had be- fallen his carriage, and a wonderful presence of mind animated: her with courage to attempt a search for his re- mains. She, applied herself to the labor with superhu- man strength, removing the fallen rubbish with a zeal so observable that men looked on in speechless wonder;- ere long it became contagious from pure sympathy, and a crowd of laborers were soon at work under her direction. She stimulated them by offers of pecuniary reward, and even at such an hour, and in: such service, the hope of gain exerted its power. Nor was his official station for- gotten; it was told, from one to another that the British Consul was buried, alive, and the. concourse of people be- came immense, Steadily the weight of impending ruins diminished, and as one band wearied, another assumed its place.. At length a voice: was heard feebly calling from the depths of the chasm, and, the- hope of saving life in- spired negw efforts ; Lady Alice knelt in the midst of the workmen, and with streaming eyes and, uplifted hands she invoked Heayen for success, and: vowed a consecration of her life to holiness, as an offering of gratitude. Scarcely had the ,words of the ,fervent pledge passed her lips, when a cry of joy burst from the multitude, repeated again and again, and echoed far away. The knight was delivered from his sepulchral-prison, and leaping unharmed from be- neath; two, huge timbers that fore,-ed-aprotecting arch on   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.      351 which the superincumbent mass had rested, he rushed to the side of Alice, and clasping hler to his bosom he min- gled vows of penitence and, restitution, with the devout thanksgiving of the enraptured woman who had delivered him from the tortures of a living death. The terrible adventure had not been disregarded by the imprisoned nobleman, to whose soul the vanities and frivolities of life had been portrayed in their true charac- ter and relations; his conscience, in the long contempla- tion of the momentary death that he anticipated, had to him a voice louder than the sundering world that engulfed him, and he trembled for the unknown retribution. Then succeeded the forlorn hope of escape, and frantic resolu- tions of reformation, and atonement for past wrongs; and first among them the solemn pledge to the God of Purity to legalize before the world the unhalloived intimacy that had so long bound to him the beautiful being who loved him better than honor and better than life. No pen can express, no tongue utter the wild, enthusi- astic rapture that these twain experienced in reunion. It inspired the populace, even, with excited sympathy and emotions of religious thanksgiving. To the silence that witnessed the passionate interchange of happiness, there succeeded a cry of inspirations echoed and re-echoed, - "To the cathedral! -- to the cathedral!" Away the volatile people turned to the ruins of a relig- ious temple, on whose broken and upheaved steps a ven- erable priest was confessing, and pronouncing absolution upon crowds of devotees. The Consul with Lady Alice was borne in advance, upon the arms of the people, and   352       HOUSEHOLD TALES. at such an hours and with such a cloud of witnesses, in- stead of absolution and indulgence, the humbled dignitary soutghlt rather to'make restitution for his guilty life, by es- pousing his deliverer! Their marriage vows were thus pledged, the old priest pronounced a benediction, and in the midst of the ruin around, the sublime voice of the multitude rose wildly blending upon the evening air, as they poured the choral harmonies of ' Te Denum: Many succeeding years the knight and the lady lived in happy wedlock, with characters purified and made benev- olent by their chastening experiene. They returned to America, and once more established a residence in the for- est home; but the days of revelry were passed away. A Christian householId now ruled in the rural mansion, and dispensed blessing upon the, rustic homes around. On the anniversary of his wonderful escape, Sir Henry inva- riably secluded himself in a particular apartment of his dwelling, and theres in solitary retirement, he kept a sol- emn fast, renewing his vows of penitence, and calling to mind his occasion f(or devout thanksgiving. Here were hung the garments he had worn when buried at Lisbon, soiled, rent, and covered with lime-dust, preserved in just the condition in which be had escaped. At the opening of the war of the Revolution, Sir Hen- ry Frankland appeared upon the theater of events for the last time. He was a sincere loyalist, and when an open rupture between king and people appeared inevitable, he made preparations to leave the country. Some excite- ment arose concerning him, and himself and family were arrested and held in detention by an armed guard, until   THE SKIPPER'S DAUGHTER.         853 the Provincial Congress undertook their liberation. The lady Alice survived her husband many years, and her de- scendants mingle their blood among the proudest families of the British nobility. The dwelling yet stands, and the fine old hall and rich tapestried hangings still reveal something of its ancient splendor; articles of family use are preserved as relics about the -town, while many a tale of wonder is told of the deeds and days of revelry, and ghostly dances are be- lieved to occur in the summer moonlight, as the Spirit of the Skipper's Daughter responds to othe merriment in a many-voiced echo of answering glee. NOTE.--The Author regrets the necessity of saying .that. what was true when the Tale of 'The Skipper's Daughter' was written, is so no longer; the dwelling referred to in the text was- destroyed by fire, in the year 1858. Its owner and occupant, EDWARD S. NASON, Esq., has erected a modern residence upon the same site, but' another of the an- cient dwellings of STew England has passed away. It' may not be in- appropriate, in this connection, to say that, Sir Henry Frankland and his romantic love are historical facts. The family name of Lady Alice is unknown to the writer; but wtth the exception of the description of her debut at a public meeting, and of assigning a special parentage to her, the facts of her life, ' stranger than fiction,' corresponded to the in- cidents of the story. The inight's discovery of her in a menial emp10y- ment t; his infatuation ; his illicit amours; her introduction to Boston aristocracy; their successive flights to the wilderness and to the conti- nent; alid their marvelous adventure at the great earthquake that de- stroyed Lisbon in 1755, with the happy results that followed, are all the veritable records of a checkered life. 30  e C   THE SABBATH BREAKERSo THAT was an hour to send its fadeless 'trace Down life's far-sweeping tide.

If we are not in haste the tide will be out, - and then away with all sport for another week, at least; I'm for going now." "Stay a few moments, Allen; you surely would not leave until the hour appointed by yourself for Thornton to be here. It lacks five minutes to ten o'clock, now, and I am certain he will be punctual, for he gave us his pledge and he never forfeits his word." 'C Pledge!"' repeated Allen with a sneer, "what is a pledge good for? For my part I consider no pledge of mine binding, when it interferes with my own conven- ience, -and I presume Thornton is as wise as I. 'Look * out for number one' is my maxim." "And a selfish maxim it is!" said Wallace in reply.   THE SABBATH BREAKERS&      355 "Selfish or not, selfish," continued Allen, "I care not. It is the principle 'my governor' acts upon, and he finds a faithful disciple in me, at all events. Only yesterday he agreed to deliver a cargo of sugar, at a round sum, and half an hour later, finding he could get an advance of five hundred dollars by retreating, he sent a polite note to his customer, regretting that ' unforeseen circumstances' de- prived him of the pleasure of delivering the goods. He broke his 'pledge,' but pocketed the cash! .What say you to that, Charley?" "I say your master acted in a very unprincipled man- ner!" responded his companion, " and a few such transac- tions, talked of on 'Change, would lose him his reputation and his customers together. Why, Allen, do n't you be- lieve he violated the laws of trade and morality both?" "'Morality,' indeed!" shouted Allen laughing boister- ously, "you' make a fine preacher, upon my word! Out on a Sabbath-breaking excursion and preaching morality! That's consistency, with a vengeance! But never mind, Charley, you 'll get your eyes peeled, one of these days, and then -you 'll understand a thing or two." "I move the ' previous question!'" said a third speaker who had been listening; here comes Thornton up the mall, punctual to a second. And now, fellows, just post- pone your discussion to a more befitting season; I'll be prosy when I can't help it, but to-day I intend to live out the spirit of my favorite glee, - Begone, dull Care!"

They constituted a, plre-arranged pleasure party, of whom Allen, the first speaker, was the leader, and whose word usually passed for law. He was the -eldest of the group, and al- though not twenty years of ace, there was an energaetic boldness ahout him,: that united with a commanding figure and graceful mien, invariably secured deference and in- fluence. He was naturally generous in his impulses, and with the exception of his city apprenticeship he had been under religious- influences firom childhood, But it had been his misfortune to enter a mercantile house whose proprietor was absorbed in the pursuit of wealth, and re- garded- the morals of his clerks as no concern of his, so long as they were honest, shrewd and devoted to his inter- est. Beyond this his care did not extend. He was, a worldly man in the most comprehensive sense of-the term, and virtually- lived in the belief that 'a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry.'- Invariably, in pleasant weathelr - he devoted his Sabbaths to, pleasure, by drives into the country, or excursions to the islands and Fwatering places in which the waters of the Bay abound. It could not be expected that with such examples from a master any per- son of volatile temperament, surrounded by the seductive   THE SABBATH BREAKERS.      357 temptations of a large city, away from home influences, and with the proverbial recklessness of youth, would do otherwise than lapse into license, and become loose in act and thought. Edgar Allen was no exception to the law of moral influence, and from the time when his master in- itiated him in a course of vice, by giving him a Sunday ride and a supper at a suburban hotel, he gradually felt the restraint of the principles in which he had been educated become more and more irksome, till he began to cast off the fear of vice, and venture toward the whirlpool of ruin by dallying in the scarcely moving waters about the shore. Thence his fate was'that decreed as well by Truth as by Poetry,- He first endured, then pitied, then embraced. His course had been step by step in error, till from the novitiate and trembling transgressor, he had become fasci- nated. scoffed at religion, and stood the leader of a circle of young men who were in a greater or less degree com- mitted to a life of foolish dissipation; and such was their blind devotion to the popular young man, that many a deed of wrong was consummated, when it would have been recoiled from had any other, or less energetic charac- ter proposed it. The individual whom Allen at first addressed was the particular intimate of him they awaited. Charles Wallace and Arthur Thornton were natives of the same quiet vil- lage in Vermont, they had been schoolmates together, and now they were associated in new relations. rWallace had longer dwelt in the city, for scarcely six months had gone   358       HOUSEHOLD TALES. by since Th6rnton left the roofs of his widowed mother, to learn the duties of a merchant. Through the example of his friend, therefore, the latter had been induced to enter the society of evil companions, but he had not yet forgot- ten the parting counsels of his mother. One of her most solemn injunctions to him had been to ' Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;' and when the proposal to join a fishing party was made to him the day previous, he was, surprised, and his feelings instinctively recoiled from it. But his comrades urged him by so many motives to the indulgence,: and rallied him Upon his conscience, ten- der as a womian's, that he faltered in his objections, and to avert ridicule, unguardedly pledged himself to go. Who has not been swerved from duty by similar ap- pliances! A regard for the good-will of our fellow-men, is innate, and few have strength of character sufficient to endure obloquy and reproach, even in a righteous cause. But in this consists the difference between the truly great men aid the time-serving multitude. A desire for popu- lar favor is the besetting sin of many, who but for this weakness would shine as stars in' the firmament of nations, instead of permitting their light to be obscured by the fly- ing dust of the populace they court. Multitudes of states- men have been tempted upon this rock, making shipwreck at once of the hopes and the claims of justice and right, while the country that needed honest service has been, by their default, left to peril and disaster. With so universal a' tendency to an exorbitant estimate of the value of popular good-will, it is not at all remark- -able that young people hasten to ruin, through fear of be-   THE SABBATH BREAKERS.       359 ing laughed at; nor does the fact so much call for censure as for compassion and counsel. In this view one can not over-estimate the power which upright masters may ex- ercise over apprentices; nor even imagine a more respon- sible relation. But with what degree of faithfulness the duties and the privileges are exercised, may well be sub- ject of serious consideration. It is quite possible that very much of the dissoluteness of the times may be traced to recreancy here! Thornton had regretted his assent to the arrangements, from the moment he had given it; but from a mistaken notion of honor, he felt that there would be disgrace in abj- senting himself. On this his friend had securely rested, and as he joined them Allen exclaimed,- "Now for a line of march to Long wharf! See how the old elm dances in the breeze and laughs in the sunlight, as if to bid us joy! This wind will sing a sweeter music through the snowy sails than ever echoed through yonder. temple's gothic walls. Come, hasten, boys!" Thus saying he took the arm of Roberts and moved in the direction indicated, while the remainder of the party followed. As they passed Park street church the last of the congregation were just entering. "I wish I were within those old walls, Charley;" said- Thornton; "I know I am doing wrong- and were it not for breaking my word I would not go with you, now; it is the last time, at any rate, and I wish you had never invited me. What would my mother say, if she only saw: me on this business,! She is sitting in her quiet pew, at home; and perhaps remembering me in her prayers!"   360       HOUSEHOLD TALES. "Nonsense, Arthur! I used to think and feel just so; but a few-sails, and luscious chowders, washed down with a bottle or two of champagne, will set all that right. By and by the bitter will be turned into sweet." "But can -that ever be- agreeable that takes its relish from the murder of one's moral convictions-? I know I can never enjoy a moment's pleasure/ in these doings un- til I first put my conscience asleep, -nay, kill its power of telling right from wrong." "Conscience is a matter of education, Arthur. You have always lived in a quiet country village, where there is nothing but a! school-house and a church, and the peo- ple think everything outside of their walls to be wrong. You have learned to think so too, and this has made your conscience what it is. Here you will get a more liberal view of things; a city conscience and a country conscience are two very different affairs." "I have already observed it, Charles; but the impor- tant thing is to decide which is right. I know, for exam- ple, that all the reasoning in the world can never make it right to turn the Sabbath into a holiday, and I wish I was clear of it., I'm determined to break away from Allen's power, for he'll ruin me if I do not; even now I have not the character I possessed before I knew him. I have al- ready seen too much of him, and if I must lose his friends ship or a tender conscience, why we shall soon be at va- riance, and I care not when." They had now reached the Old State House, the west- ern entrance to which was thronged by. a crowd of disso- lute idlers, busied in gazing at the street passengers, and   THE SABBATH BREAKERS.      361 making ribald jests upon the females, especially. Allen recognized an associate among them whom he familiarly accosted. The person addressed removed a cigar from his lips, and returning the salutation, continued, - "But whither away so fast? I had hoped for your no. ble company to dine at Brighton. I have engaged the finest 'turn-out' in the city, and will give you a dinner you will relish for a month; say you'll go!" "Sorry it can 't be done, Frank. I 'm in for a chowder and sha' n't be up till five; just postpone for a supper and I'm your most obedient.' "Done, my good fellow! Any sacrifice for your compa- ny, Allen; meet me here at five." "Ay, ay, Frank, I'll be on hand!" The party passed on, and Frank Gray replaced his ci-- gar, while the smoke rolled up in fantastic curls as if from the pipe of a Turkish Sultan. State street was nearly deserted. and echoing footsteps were the only sounds that broke the solitude, aside from the interrupted conversation of the pleasure-seekers. Wallace and Thornton were si- lent, deeply reflecting upon thoughts suggested by their recent conversation. In a few moments they reached the wharf, where boat and boatman awaited them, and in a short period they were wafted out to sea, bounding gayly over the white-fringed waves. The mnorning was beautiful, the sky clear, and nature in: her happiest mood; the quiet of the scene was not an un- fit emblem of the spiritual peace that should pervade the Christian Sabbath. The company on board the boat sat on deck, gazing back upon the city that receded every 31   362       HOUSEHOLD TALES. instant, admiring the mingled beauties of nature and of art. There are few scenes that surpass the beautiful pan- orama spread out around them, with the populous city in the center, displaying churches with their lofty towers mounting heavenward, as if to denote the uses of the temples beneath,-while the dome of the State House sur- mounted the view. Upon the right and left the sacred Heights of Dorchester and Charlestown greeted them, to inspire grateful patriotism, as well as emotions of pleas- ure, and the attention of the voyagers was absorbed by the varying charms. Possibly other thoughts mingled that enforced the silence; out upon the bosom of the deep, in a frail bark, the immensity of the element about them, the insecurity of life, may have awakened somber reflections, and inspired a consciousness of their uhhallowed occupa- tion. Then may have succeeded the thought that He who held the winds in His hand, and gave bounds to the waste of waters, might send forth His breath in anger, wake the ocean from its slumbers, and with, the blast of a whirlwind engulf them in perdition. How often man's spirit is prompted to reformation and good works by an internal, voice, that, he stifles or ig- nores! But it is a difficult thing to turn from evil cours- es, and requires bravery, more than to face a battle. Con- science may lift the veil of the future, display the sure ruin to follow, and suggest escape; but a giant stands in the -way of reform, and frightened at the shadow, the fool- ish wanderer drowns the god within, still rushing on,- As a bird hasteth to the snare, And, knoweth not it is for his life.   THE SABBATH BREAKERS.      363 Thornton was the first to disturb reflection, by rising to go to the bows of the boat; the movement aroused the others from their reveries, and Allen exclaimed, - "Come, come, boys, away with this mopishness! Old Peter can manage the boat without watching, and this si- lence savors too much of a Quaker meeting for my taste. Which shall it be Whist or Euchre!" So saying he drew a pack of cards from his pocket, as three of his familiars seconded his purpose. Wallace de- clined to play, and as the party was just made up without him, he was quietly permitted to join Thornton in a pleas- ant tete-a-tete, during which old times and old friendships were familiarly discussed. Thus employed time passed swiftly, and the distant outlines of the land. ever receding, were lost from view. At length the fishing-ground was reached, and cards and converse were exchanged for hooks, lines, and tackle; a , pool' was contributed for the successful captor of the first fish- to win, and the baited hooks fell into the sea. Even Thornton persuaded himself that he might as well join in the amusement as to be an abettor by his presence, and a loud shout soon rose upon the water as he flung the un- wary first fish dangling from his lucky hook. Thencefor- ward the day was forgotten, and each individual lost the last accusing feeling in the general hilarity. Story, song and jest followed each other in constant succession, and merriment ruled the hour. Old Peter prepared the chow- der, and ere long the savory preparation steamed upon the trencher, and the luscious feast, assisted by generous wines, warmed the riotous group to unhallowed mirth.   -364      UOUSEHOLD TALESo How different this scene from that where humble wor- shipers are congregated, in some sacred temple, where finite mortals are privileged to hold- communion with the Infinite! The one bowed under the influences of Truth, inspiring penitence, and the other boldly reckless in the ways of transgression; the one breathing confessions of sin and earnest prayer for forgiveness, the other sinning in deliberate purpose; the one witnessing sincerity by the tear of contrition, the other demonstrating hardihood by profanity and license. To the unreflecting the latter seem the happier group, but the former have an inherit- ance of joy that Faith administers, and have learned that spiritual life and spiritual peace transcend all created hap- piness. These have'a perpetual blessing that the soul on- ly comprehends, while those live only for the present mo- ment, and when the day of disappointment and trial ar- rests them, the mountain of their joy dissolves in evan- escent shadows. While the hilarous party had been engaged in feasting, unobserved by them the appearance of the heavens had sensibly changed. The wind had shifted to a southern point, and a dark cloud was looming up on the horizon, indicating a rising thunder tempest, and the low muttering of a far-off storm could even then be heard, 'What's that noise?" asked Alien, abruptly breaking in upon a story, as his ear caught the echo. "What noise?" asked several at a breath. "Did you not a hear discharge of cannon? There,- what steamer is due to-day?" "That 'ere's thunder, boys," cried the old boatman, as   TIIE SABBATH BREAKERS.      365 he started to inspect the heavens. "There'll be a tre- mendous squall along 'fore we think on 't, I tell ye! I'm pesky jealous o' that kind o' noise; besides, jest see that 'ere pokerish looking cloud h'isting his head out o' the wa- ter yender! That 'ere means something." During this annunciation the party stood gazing in the direction indicated, with a sudden hush of noisy mirth, for they did not relish the thought of a gale in such a frail vessel, and Peter's manner was exciting. "Can 't we run up to the city before the storm will be on us?" inquired Wallace. "Bless your soul, no! But I 'll1 put the Sally under all her canvass, and do my best, for that 'ere cloud looks ugly. I do n't want to meet it more 'n you!" Thus saying he applied himself to his seaman's duty. He raised the sails to the breeze with all possible expedi- tion, and seated himself at the tiller, while the boat swept through the waters till her wake was marked with a long line of foam, and her bows whistled in cleaving the deep. Every eye was fixed upon the rising cloud, and every ear attentively listened to the thunder, as it came nearer and nearer. The sound of gayety was silent, and each one sat in sober thought; for when danger stares one in the face, a sedate deportment always ensues. The cloud ev- ery moment increased in density, the lightning flashed, and the gusty wind ploughed the surface of the water in ragged furrows, while the boat trembled and shook as the blasts struck her, frequently submerging her weather rail. The rain began to fall drenchingly, and the waves rose in new tumult with every moment. They were caught in 31 X   '866-      ^ HOUSEHOLD TALES. the very intensity of the tempest they had striven to es- cape, and all its dangers were upon them. All felt it; as the peril was imminent, and now conscience would not be stifled, but the most hardened among them quailed as they gazed upon each other's pallid faces; Thornton alone' dis- turbed their silence as he exclaimed, - "Oh, that I had remembered my mother's injunction, ' Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy!'" On, on the boat flew, and a ray of hope lighted their bosoms as the distant city hove in sight; but it was"only a momentary gleam, for the next instant a lightning shaft pierced the water a few rods in advance, as if daring them to attempt the passage of the spot. The guilty group were almost paralyzed with consternation, and every eye was centered upon Thornton, as if from him, the least hardened among them, some hope of safety might -pro- ceed. He stood clinging to the mast, gazing upon a cloud more dense and terrific than that which had spent its fu- ry, as it rolled:its ominous form above them, and as if he repeated his thoughts aloud he said, - "'Because I have called and ye refused;      ; I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded: But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; /  When your fear cometh as desolation, Ar d your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; WhKlistress and anguish cometh upon you!" "Hold of the tiller!" shouted Peter, " while I reef the Isail. Bear ahand lively boys! A squall has struck the water yender, and if it hits the canvas we are lost! Up   THE SABBATH BREAKERS.      367 the helm, up the helm, man! Look out when the boom swings! Now she works!" The sail flapped in the wind, and came rattling down, but at the instant a peal of terrific thunder burst above them, the mast was shattered by the lightning its tall form had tempted, and the seven human beings were submerged in the waves. The solemn tolling of bells was again heard in the city, as a funeral cortege defiled from a church following three mournful hearses, bearing the bodies of Allen, Roberts, and Wallace. The old and young, parent and child are there; fathers whose hopes are fallen, mothers whose bit- ter wails tell of broken hearts, and sisters whose affections have become fountains of bitter waters. But he who fol- lows next the biers is the most desolate of them all, for of all the pleasure party of last Sabbath's morning, Arthur Thornton alone lives, to accuse himself of neglected duty, and reflect that his single obedience to the teachings of conscience would have disarranged all the plans, inter- rupted the harmony, defeated the wrong, and saved yet from consummation the untimely END OF THE SABBATH BREAKERS.
