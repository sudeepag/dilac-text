First, then, as to ourself. I say not myself; for this would be to roll immediately my complex egoism out of the manifold garments which a historian wears of course; but I say Ourself, that gathered, round Impersonation which may be well supposed to be a crystallized something, like a cunning frost-work on the long window-panes of history, - an armless hand writing Mene and other hieroglyphics on the wall, or a Briareus with his hundred hands, heads, and feet, running in a hundred different ways, staring through a hundred telescopes at the calm ages, and writing with a century of hands the doings, undoings, and misdoings of the race. This manifold, dignified mys- tery Irmean to put on and wear after this chapter; but   PREFATORY.         45 in order to insure the confidence which I now seek, JI shall slip, for a few minutes, out of my state gear, and taking your hand, - now no longer withheld nor even hesitatingly given,-look trustingly into your eyes, and mention a few of those particulars of- myself, which -you have a gracious right to know, in order to judge of my standing in the world, my intellectual competency and fitness, and the plumptitude of my moral proportions. I was born very early in life; so early, in fact, that although present, and making such an effort as befitted my firs' appearance, I was so inexpressibly interested in the matter, that I forgot my future office, that of recorder of passing events. The fact of my birth--a fact which is apt to happen to most people-is not perhaps so singular as that, being born in the United States, I contrived to live beyond the first five years, that fatal semi-decade. I ought, perhaps, now to add, in order to quiet. any apprehensions after my last alarming remark, that "I still live"; and that;, having survived the perils and plums of parental'kindness in infancy, I hope to outlive the equally fatal neglect and indifference which marks our treatment of old age. My parents, at the time I was given to the world, were poor, and, therefore, not respectable. They had been simple enough to marry young, and for love; and - although they had. mated each otiier well, they had failed to put a yoke upon the neck of fortune. These early struggles, however, stiffened in them the moral elements, and marbleized, so to speak, -the 'soft woods of their country natures, making a substance very dif- s ferent from that thin, moral veneering which is uphol- * * -           r  '    "  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. stered from the beechen groves that timber the sunny slopes of life. Both of them were Presbyterians; always attending the Sunday services, sitting in a gal- lery seat, close to the pulpit, and so taking the brunt of the hard blows which were rightfully felt in, and - I sometimes thought--,spent themselves upon, our uncushioned pew. An offer from my father's brother, who had become rich in mercantile business, drew my father and the family in my fifth year to the city of Philadelphia. With this change of base came sharper tactics'against  the army of poverty; and at last, by fighting it on the same line, although it took all the summer of his life/ he achieved the victory. I was then sent to the best schools; took lessons at home in some branches from a private teacher; took- I own it now-- lessons in other branches privately, out of the house, without my father's knowledge, although at his expense for the tuition; and at last I went to college. Hard study, matched by an irrepressible love' of pranks at night; a knowledge of Euclid's lines and clothes. line; of belles-lettres and unlettered belles; iof geometrical and other squares; of chemistry applied to known uses and to experiments for which there were no precedents in the books; prizes offered by the faculty, and prizes offered by Mrs. Green and, Mrs. White in the persons of their handsome daughters,- these all braided together the' threads of my university life into a pattern which, if not unusual, was made up principally of figures little admired at home. My father was not at all pleased with the well-red bill I brought with me, and quite as little with the    PREFATORY.         45- unsigned ones which followed me, from college; and, concluding that I might run my own face for a while, set his sharply against me. I took to teaching; sounding over again the shallow depths of old studies, but often striking the lead onH the rocky bottom of a temper too long indulged not to be stern when touched by children's thoughtlessness. My father's death cast upon me responsibilities for my mother and the estate, which dropped the curtain upon my dream-life, and lifted it from the long per- spective of actual work and business cares. Among my father's papers I found the following original docu- ment, which I reproduce here, as showing his shrewd- ness of observation, and the character of the parents who helped to form some elements of my own. "A NEW AMERICAN DECALOGUE.  "Hear, O Jonathan, the commandments which thou hast made, - teaching them to thy infants, thy Freed- men, thy Irishmen, thy office-holders,--the asses within thy gates.

"I. "Thou shalt not mistake any other god for the afore- said, such as Religion, True Worship, Charity, Virtue, Obedience, Truth; for Gain, being a jealous God, re- quires all your time, strength, health, soul, and body,' and will show, no mercy upon those who keep not his day-book, ledger, and cash-books.

"Thou shalt forbear all witness against thy neigh- bor; lest thy time be consumed needlessly in the pub- lic service,' and he afterwards, also, witness against thee. x. "Thou shalt acquire so much by the foregoing com- mandments, as not to covet thy neighbor's house and lot, nor any other real or un-real estate of his whatso- ever." Settling up the property which my father had ac- cumulated, although disregarding this code, and unset- tling myself, I roamed abroad long and widely; prac- tically dog-earing in Europe, Asia, and Africa the leaves of that illuminated volume of travel which I had all my life been intent to own. Then   came  marriage,-religious convictions,- studying for the ministry,--children in the house, -studying them, and -how   to feed them, -ordina- tion,-a call to a rus-urban   congregation in the vicinity of New York,- only a short hour's ride on a rail, and well- feathered, without tar, by plentiful dust, --preaching to an assemblage, gathered from  behind sharp counters on week-days, to measure my dis- courses critically, and to secure their money's worth on' Sundays,-and    all the nameless little experiences that roll over the cog-wheels of a suburban parson's life.- Two bronchial attacks commissioned me to look   48   THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. up a better throat,--once in a journey to South America, and once across the prairies to California. These experiences, added to their predecessors, have accumulated, withl. my readings, the materials for a history which the leisure half-hours, paragraphed be- tween the compact duties of my thirty years of min- isterial work, have permitted me to put together, and which now, dear reader, I place, as my cor cordium, in your hands. It' is the cream, skimmed from my carefully kept dairy; or rather the condensed milk of' my very being, left at your door, to make your tea pleasanter, and your pudding sweeter and richer.

They are, in brief, to put facts, verita- ble and authentic facts, whether agreeable or dis- agreeable in themselves, in that pleasing dress that will make them welcome visitors to the drawing-room, good chums'in the bedchamber, chatty companions in the cars, on steamers and steamboats, jolly physicians 3.

I feel so sure that, as not one of the illuminated readers of these chronicles has ever mistaken dulness for wisdom, so not one will need be reminded that the most solid and trusted truths may wear the smiles of joy and hilarity. The Romans on their solemn festival days were wont to carry in their processions the images of their ancestors, even those long deceased, wreathed with flowers. So carry we the images of the Past, gar- landed with the rosy links of fun and jollity. We shall not be tempted by the lure of originality, nor even by the attractive ambition of gaining credit for profound critical and historical acumen, to follow the late fashion of dressing up stale and unwholesome characters in fine clothes and qualities. We shall neither foist the virtuous regimentals and well-earned epaulettes of Washington upon Benedict Arnold, nor tease history to fling a mantle of false charity over Burr's treason. We shall not worry the public con- science into-any praise, however faint, of the crimson waistcoat of Mr. Jefferson Davis, nor waste any admi- ration upon the spotted neck-tie, perhaps too loosely drawn, of Jacob Thompson. Impartial justice shall hold our tape and handle our shears. It is usual for historians to indicate the sources of their information; but as we have refused no means - of enriching these annals, using for that purpose what- ever materials our multiform reading could supply, from the Ramayana, the great Sanscrit epic, impressed on wax, down to the last published child's primer, printed   PREFATORY.         51 on patented wooden paper, we could not name all our aauthorities without giving a catalogue inconvenient for our publishers, and too long for the abridged lives of our readers. We cannot, however, refrain from acknowledging our obligations to John Smith, Esq., for original information, novel ideas, and new turns I of thought around old notions, running through every  page of this history; to Mr. Jones, for valuable public documents; and to Mr. Brown, the well-known sexton of Grace Church, New York, who in the course of his lifelong diggings, has exhumed several pieces of Americans, whom we have reconstructed and pre- served in our historical cases. As to the illustrations which flash upon and light up our pages, they will speak for themselves; if they do not, any word of ours would be, Vox et preteread ihil.  '   i  'i   BOOK FIRST.

Of course the newly ventilated space thus reis- covered excited much talk at the time, and created a sensation in that unsensational age. The first Eu- ropeans who were presented to America were as much elated, as Americans now at their presentation to European courts; as if America, like those courts, had not existed and had not had its shows, jewels, follies, history, and fetes, centuries before they were shown -up to it. .Has not this sensation lasted quite long enough? Is it not time- now that nearly four hundred years have allowed the first ardor and sur- prise to cool off--to vindicate the ' claim of the Western Continent against the long-puffered error of , mistaking what they were new to for what was itself new'? The arrogant pretensions of what is pleased to call itself the Old World have quite long enough kept back our bashful and blushing claims. Indeed, in our chronic modesty, we are allowing our country to get somewhat mature in speakinga of itself as new; while even children now know that ours is, in fact, the elder continent. Agassiz is not gassing us when he picks our ancient: Alleghany flints and tells us, that the camp-fires in the Lackawanna, Schuylkill, and Lehigh valleys blazed away long before those at Newcastle and in the English Black    $    -.^A 4 11 god-t*^'JL Ax 101A VlJV C^X . - I 7 Country were lit up. The Rocky Mountains got up their vertebrated backs ages before Mont Blanc put on such cool airs and carried its head' so loftily over the more modest chignon of our Orizaba and Long's Peak. The Mississippi got down to its delta long before the Rhone or Rhine reached even their alpha. Let us then henceforth assert the dignity of our superior antiquity; and commisserate the other half of the globe in being so long unknown to our older- America. What was the precise height, the fashionable color of hair and eyes, the modish   vices, the sartorial virtues, of the races which stocked our prairies, and hunted plesiosauria, and megalosauria, and other tall game along our wide valleys, and across the granite peaks of our long mountain ranges, we have not now at hand any plates or photographs to show; but well do we know that we are very much obliged to them for leaving unburned such lots of good coal, snugly stowed away in dry, ample cellars; and that those cellars were placed in such a peaceable Quaker State as Pennsylvania, where we can go and help ourselves by the cart-load without getting into a' stew. How beautifully, too, they--those  young  Americans- packed away their fish; so well that they-  the fish - are now just as fresh as when Noahperformed his maritime   adventure, Moses was fished up by the banks of the Nile, or Jonah became cargo in the deeply laden whale. What large provisions those- jolly dwellers on this hemisphere, long ages ago, must have made, when we find such abundance of funny finny things, so care-   .  "   O58  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. fully stowed away in layers, all over the continent, from the icy plains around the North Pole, down through the Isthmus belt, and along'the saw-shaped ridges of South America, to the farthermost cape., Now, if we had no other proof of the high civilization, we may truthfully say, the dainty and luxurious refinement, of those pre-Columbian inhabitants of this hemisphere, the existence of these fish, so beautifully canned, - better disposed, in fact, than if they had been arranged in layers by the accomplished ,herring- packers 'of Scotland or Holland, -we might safely rest there the well-digested argument; knowing well, as all our Leaders do, that the love of fish was one of the peculiar features that marked the highest point of Assyrian, Egyptian, and Persian civilization; re- membering that in the time of Pericles, the pol- ished Athenian left the charming music of his flow- ing speech, when he heard the bell in the Agora an- nounce that the fish auction had begun; and further recalling the fact that the fish-ponds of Lucul- lus, Pompey, Crassus, and the millionnaire Romans, gauged, like yard-sticks, the intellectual culture of Rome. Fossil cranes have also been  found ingeniously tucked away in appropriate crusts,- a cran-iological development not to be overlooked,; although upon this head we forbear to enlarge.

'"Perhaps in-scaly armor, up and down those ancient seas, Roamed he with an appetite that nothing could appease; Crushing shoals and hosts of being, every one of whom that ran Would, in course of time antea'son, have developed up to man; But fata sic profulgent, and we only may bewail Our dear relations slaughtered when this monster curled his tail." From what has already been said it is clear that many of the aboriginal settlers in this half of the world died game to the last. After mention of these higher arguments of our elder civilization, we shall not weaken the proofs by an exhibition of later American antiquities, such as the sculptured temples found in Yucatan and Central America; the time-coated, swallow-tailed fanes of the Peruvians; the exaggerated structures of the dwarfed Aztecs,; or the tall earth-mounds which, scattered from Lake Erie through the Mississippi Valley, and forced through the tight-set lips of the Isthmus, are at last swallowed up by Venezuela. Many doubtless are the swarms that have 'hived here through the busy centuries which preceded the Egyptian Pharaohs, the comparatively modern empires of Assyria, Persia, and China, and the still later king- doms. of Agamemnon and Priam; empires and king- doms that stand on the dim frontis-pages of our ordi- nary histories. These hives, overflowing their quar- ters, have sent out superfluous swarms across the ice bridge over our northern strait into the plains of ,Asia, and thence into kfrica and Europe. Laughable indeed is the exhibition which erudite   AMERICA BEFORE ITS DISCOVERY.  ,  61 European  historians,  ethnologists, and others have made of themselves in deducing from   Asia, as the mother-swarm, the colonies that have peopled the world; when in truth Asia was only the half-way house, the luncheon-place of our trampers, on their march into their foggy countries and chronicles. Thus it is now ascertained by late researches -that there is a great resemblance between the languages of the Mongols and Japanese, and those of Equador and New Granada. Hopes are entertained that anti- quarians may discover some ancient precedents for our Yankee tongues and words derived from sources whose authoritative beginnings now puzzle us. So, too, no doubt, migrations homeward have taken place from the faded and colorless scenes of these exploring raids. Hitherward trickled, probably, the ten Israelitish tribes, hitherto supposed to be lost, diffusing them- selves wanderingly for the past two thousand five hundred and eighty-nine years, and now collecting in pools in our towns and cities, and around our stock- exchanges. Here, too, have reappeared, after going in on the -other side, the broken pieces of the empire of Nine- veh, mixed up with fragments of its gates of brass, which fused in the transmission, have veneered the faces of those who pulled through, forming in their -  descendants the race of brazen-faced itinerant pedlers, auctioneers, and plumbers among us. So the ancient empire of Egypt, shivered up by Caesar, percolating through, at last dripped into that stalagmite, the Tombs of New York, with its newly   s62  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNIrTl STrATELS. formed but not reformed Coesars and Pompeys in- side. In a word, most of the old kingdoms, and even cities, such as Troy, Rome, Syracuse, Alexandria, Macedon, Athens, Sparta, and others, disappearing from sight on the other and newer hemisphere, and straining through into ours, have come out on our side condensed by the pressure il, small spots, but with similar names,- spots smaller but just as smart and big-feeling as their larger selves. This, too, ac- counts for our sudden expansions, whether in crinoline or credit; the compressed and squeezed germ reassert- ing often its, chance for pristine greatness in sudden and unexpected ways.  Now that we have started the train of thought, each of our readers can easily turn engineer and stoker, and by applying a little fuel of his own, can drive it over all the various tracks which run from his metropolitan, central brain. "No wonder," each one will exclaim, " that our people are so thin after so much pressing of their ancestors; no wonder at our new-minted words, the old ones having been fused at a red heat in the cen- tral fires." Here, too, is the secret of our burning eloquence. This 'is the source of our extraordinary architecture, borrowed, like an actor's costume at a fancy ball, from huddled heaps of clothing made for others, and brought together in party-colored, but ill-sorted union. Looked at from this angle, we can account, too, for our mytho- logical tendencies, - the invocations to Jove, when surprised; the devotion to Apollo in our magazines;                      .   3XAMRlfinlA MJYrUE^ Al lliD V10UV V E1U1. . Ua the frequent use of the lyre in our trade; the love for bare shoulders, like Junos, in our divine assemblages; our leanings at night to Bacchus; and other customs and habits that creep out even from under pan-taletes. Greece at first took her Olympus from us; and we in the course of time have, like affectionate parents, borrowed it back again. From these varied proofs it is manifest that, before Columbus brought over to America specimens of the European stock  existing in his time, our hemi- sphere had been hard-at work firing up at Popocate- petl; scooping out harbors on our coasts; creasing our valleys in fluvial grooves for our fast-running craft and boats; feathering the future nests of a later posterity with materials for use; and in general laying in a large stock for a successful business to be taken up and carried on afterwards by those who should come back from their migrations to become large dealers inl uni- versal notions, general purveyors, forwarders and ad- vancers on all kinds of property, from continents to a spool of cotton, from polar Alaska ice to West India warnling-pans and peppery troches. How long it took them to flutter back to these. old deserted nests, how many were lost before they had fairly got settled in them, and what broods now chirp, sing, and crow, through branches new and old, honest or brittle, these pages are full fledged to show.   CHAPTER II. OF THE DISCOVERIES IN AMERICA DURING THE ELEVENTH, FIFTEENTH, SIXTEENTH, AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES.  1000- 1607. America not discovered by Jason. - Lithographic Specimens attributed to the Northmen in the Eleventh Century curious, but by Skalds more Modern.--Bishop Berkeley's Western Star not the First American Constellation.--Columbus offers a Continent at Private  Sale; Isabella, a Spanish Lady, takes him up, and the Profits also.-- Of Ferdinand's Necklace. -Price of Eggs advanced in Spain. - Eng- land finally sees Something. -A Fish Story confirmed. - Discoveries which Columbus- did not make. - Ponce de Leon. - Mexico unfortu- nately discovered. - The Straits of Magellan and other Straits. --De Soto at the Bottom of the Mississippi. - Champlain, a wise Man, founds Quebec upon a Rock. - Sir Walter Raleigh and him smoking. - The Mayflower anchored. - Hudson up Stream. A MERICA was not discovered by Jason while jOR llooking up the golden fleece, although the ex- istence of many American habits point to an origi- nator, whose name is lost, but whose Asiatic practices are' not. It is- supposed by some that the late war crops were the product of certain stray dragon's teeth possibly dropped by that wily Greek on our prolific soil. But these hypotheses, although as wise as many others connected with early maritime discoveries, are too learned to be useful. History declines to pull such wool over the eyes of its readers or to encourage traditions which flatter the pride of ancient nations, whose age is the only excuse for their fond, grand-   "ATER DISCOVERIES IN AMERICA.     65 fatherly dotings. Nor is it any more true that the Northmen, in the eleventh century, fell upon this out- lying continent, when engaged in general lithography along our coasts,- the pictured rocks near Taunton, although a spirited illustration of one page of our chronicles, being now proved to be sketches by later Scandinavian Skalds, less than eight hundred years old. We also feel obliged to deny the merit accorded by some to Bishop Berkeley, of having made the first discovery of America. This notion of some rests all its weight on the strength of those lines, "Westward the star of empire takes its way." But those were not the first lines that were carried ashore and made fast to our continent, nor this the earliest star which  appeared over our American boards. Much as we should love, in the interest of modern historical research, to invent a new discoverer for America, candor compels us to award the glory still to Christopher Columbus. Had he lived three hundred and seventy-seven years later, he would have adver- tised for a partner in some paper of wide circulation; { but not having that advantage, he circulated himself, offering a continent at private sale to all European nations that fronted the- sunset. But all declined with thanks, until at last, as is well known, one Isabella, a Spanish lady, taken with the speculation, became a silent partner in the business. She not only furnished the capital, and took a high interest in the result, but finally reaped nearly all the profits, a pleasant example of woman's rights thoroughly enforced. She even took a necklace from her neck to procure funds for the expedition; and with this ex- E   * 66 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.  "ATER DISCOVERIES IN AMERICA.    67   * ample before him, her associate Ferdinand, after trying his hand on several Moors, thought that,'after unclasp- ing from the neck of Columbus "the gem   of the Antilles," he could substitute a chain less golden. Posterity, however, indignantly breaking the metallic hasp, has clapped the iron collar back on the neck of the selfish, cunning,'and thankless Ferdinando. We must not forget to mention that before the old pilot could get his project to stand, he had raised the price of eggs throughout Spain by placing so many on their own poor broken heads. For this destruction, however, he consoled himself with the maxim, "call's well that ends well." He carried his eggs and hopes. to England, France, Portugal, and Navarre; but both were kept so long that they became addled. A heavy fog prevented 'England at first from seeing the enterprise; but after the discovery of real land was made, she lost no time in procuring the advan- tages of it, and endeavored to secure them to herself, by allowing several vessels to be outfitted at Bristol. These vessels were not built by Laird; but, sailing away on the blind side of the island, succeeded at last in boarding the continent, and exchanging some un- printed religious tracks for certain other tracts, after- wards well stamped by royal authority. On their return, the promoters of this missionary enterprise built a handsome church, where prayers were daily offered for many years, for past success, and intercessions made for the interposition of the same kind Providence for new exchanges of a similar kind. These expeditions, it may be remarked, have been and are the foundation of England's greatness,   68 THE COMC rISTORY, OF THE UNITED STATES,   "ATER DISCOVERIES IN AMERICA.    69 - her church and her trade; or rather to name them in juster order, and according to her own estimate, her trade and her church. The Cabots, father and son, will ever be remembered by their addition to the world's wealth by the discovery, in 1497, of New-  foundland. At the time it was thought to be a story somewhat fishy, but it is now swallowed without any bones.       '              , The Portuguese were less fortunate, their ships hav- ing got somehow entangled in the line in crossing it, they were obliged to cast anchor against a high wind, which as usual was not so ill as not to benefit their English rivals. What became of these ships -is not positively known; a glimpse of only one of them hav- ing since been obtained in Coleridge's Ancient Mariner. The rest may have drifted northwards, and their masts made to serve to splice the north pole, the old one having become somewhat loose from being so much worked about by meddlesome navigators. Among the discoveries in America which Columbus did not make we may enumerate the following -- First, a name for the continept; an omission after- wards supplied by a shabby countryman of his, whose own name we will not perpetuate by mentioning in this history. Second, iron-clads; although he did come across some very :hard characters, whose scaly armor history has ever since been mercilessly denting and battering. Columbus himself, although at one time cased in iron, and sent home on a trial trip, while he learned the value and preciousness of metal at the Spanish court, failed to discover its property to float him across seas '   70   THE COMC HSTORY Of THE UNITED STATES. successfully. Nor do we find any warrant for believ- ing that he was the discoverer of, Third, balsam of liverwort, the extract of buchu, Peruvian hair-dye, or the sozodont, notwithstanding the strenuous assertions to the contrary of the candid proprietors of those invaluable preparations. The only extract he succeeded in making was a promise of honors, never performed, although highly labelled; and it is well known that the only color he succeeded in obtaining in America, for his own hair, was gray. From the ingredients of this blanching powder he ultimately died. himself at Valladolid. Fourth, nor is there any better foundation for the common error, that he was the discoverer of the Tammany Society, and furnished designs and colored drawings for the wigwam, in which the Democratic braves find so many original and aboriginal voters. Indian polls, from which the hair had been carefully removed, he did see, and even took a few back with him to Spain; but it is needless to say that these polling-places were not the exemplars of those which Tammany so often and so lovingly pats on the head. Fifth, equally erroneous is the general belief "that he discovered "Hail Columbia," although it is true that he got enough of it, in the sense that some illy educated small boys now use that phrase. Ponce de Leon, following up the discoveries of Columbus, landed in Florida, in 1512, and endeav- ored to find there a fountain possessing the properties of giving to the imbiber perpetual youth. Although he did not succeed in this quest, it seems probable that some one else did, for it is'well known that sev- ,    "ATER DiCOUVERIES IN AMERICA. -' I   1 ' I THJi UUlMtl HlSlTUSJY UF 'T HE UNITED STATES, eral Americans, such as Daniel Webster, John' C. Calhoun, and others, have lived quite too long, while other distinguished Americans, as Burr and others, have manifested in a very lively way a green old age, cutting up capers which none but very young people would have thought of. He also discovered the Dry Tortugas,-a temperance station of the first water, famous as the habitation of Dr. Mudd. A few years later, A D. 1517, Mexico was unfor- tunately discovered, and from that time to the pres- ent has been the scene of constant embrioilments, beginning with the'broiling of Montezuma, by Cortez, and ending with the unhappy stew made by Maxi- milian for himself. Mexico is the American abattoir, - the general slaughter-house of our continent. Ice for the preservation of the quarters of her victims, ,; where no quarter was shown, is obtained from the ele- vated plains into which the country is as yet insuf- ficiently broken up. We ought to mention the voyage, in 1520, of a Portuguese, Magellan by name, who touched at the Canaries for yellow 'birds, coasted along the shores of Brazil in search of other golden products, but finally brought up in a very tight place, on the ex-. treme southern tip of our western globe; calling the spot, under great pressure, the Straits of Magellan. He became so exhilarated, however, at Cape Horn, that he kept on, like the man with thecork leg, and went all around the world, being its first circumventor, and giving the first proof of the gyrating effects of mix- ing liquors with water. .    ' -De Soto first 6hanced upon the Miissssippi River,   JA "lb A A....  ...JLV ..r.  -..-* . .. ....--^-- and, in 1542, was flung upon it with all his heavy armor on, - "a sink-or-swim " experiment, which re- sulted in his remaining down at the bottom. Diving for wrecks has since become for divers and diverse reasons common in that turbulent stream; but he is honored as the great diver; the river not being strong enough to get him up. John Law afterwards tried a Mississippi venture; but, unlike De Soto,'he went. up, and never came down again.   Both De Leon and De Soto showed true American enterprise and energy in the pursuit of gold. Like their coun- tryman Cortez, in Mexico, they were, however, more desirous of discovering metallic placers, and extract- ing from them sudden riches, than of luring by patient industry from a jealous soil its hoarded secrets of cereal wealth. On the north, Cartier, in 1534, became the unhappy discoverer of the Canadas, and other out-lying, uncov- ered, cold regions, afterwards parcelled out, not to ice companies like the Knickerbocker and- others, but into viceroyalties. These freezing places, from the con- tinual stirring about in them of such contrary ele- menrts for the succeeding century, might well be called the ice-creameries of England and France. Champlain, in 1603, like a wise man, founded Que- bec on a rock; for which he has been illy requited by being called the father of the French settlements in Canada. -Sir Walter Raleigh's name must always burn bright- ly in American history, for his discovery of a smoking material on the James River. But his fame needs no puffing here, although his reputation became some- :' rllj 4 4   I A A ltjL kVAVAAV .UJL&A,] WAW ' AJ. II AAA. J IL ,)AAAJ    what. blown before his' death.  Another important event soon after occurred in connection with American discoveries. A  Mayflower drifted, in December, across seas, and floating against Plymouth Rock, struck its tiny anchors in it, and, with Yankee enterprise, climbed all over it, covering its rugged clefts and -bare surface with a mass of luxuriant flowers, with which also sprang up tangling weed-growths, all of which have since been dried and attracted great attention, much sneezing, some sneering, and great use of handkerchiefs to preserve the odor of, or prevent the smell of, what has penetrated all departments of American history. The last discovery which we shall here mention was that of Hudson, who brought to light the benighted island of Manhattan, then, as since, infested by Woods and other poisonous growths. :The natives, as now, were very free in their manners; staring at the newly- arrived, and taking- them in by the exhibition of trin- kets and gilt ornaments. In spite of the sluggish airs from the shores of Westchester and' Dutchess, the ships of Hudson succeeded in reaching Rhinebeck; a few of his men even penetrating to the dense regions of Albany. ,   - CHAPTER   III.

Various as are the lights in which the former may be regarded, there is but one light, that of an en- light-ened self-interest, with  which  the latter have been treated. The speed with which we have hurried the brick-colored races towards the sun's setting is conclusive proof of our Pacific intentions, and of our dislike to unsettled titles. Red as is the color of the Indian, to this complexion do all his tribes come at last,  a pale conviction that the white man is better read than they. The chapter of our discoveries on this continent opens with- the Indian in the foreground; and the historian, like the earliest explorer, is brought imme-          ON THE INDIAN CHARAC'TER.      " diately face to face with him. Unlike the explorer, however, we will pause long enough to bury the pro- prietor of the estate which he seized and we occupy. Blankets, often very wet, have been thrown over the Indian; while as often he has been painted so thickly, and feathered so profusely 'as to become a bird of ! quite another color from that of ou-r North American vulture. Slow in learning the geography of the race that rides him down 'as on a pale horse evermore, he has acquired the name of but- one of our streams, that of the Firewater, a river whose dry banks seem always to divide his retreating from our pursuing frontier boundaries. Perhaps, we cannot give a more variegated notion of the different aspects under which the Indian char- acter is viewed, than by putting it in an American kaleidoscope, and there giving it-a few turns, certain that these turns will not be more curious or numer- ous than their owners' fortunes. 1. The Indian chag-acter as viewed in schools and colleges.

His has been the misfortune to be despoiled, not simply of the bosky inheritance of fair fields and boundless domains, where his ancestors roamed as free as the winds that sweep over the breezy sierras of the Rocky Mountains, but of the -justice which pleads before the tribunal of pos- terity for rights withheld and wrongs inflicted. Not content to pursue his retreating and emaciated foot- steps into the tomb, where his poor body is scarcely allowed to moulder away in peace, amid the imple- ments and trophies of the chase, the white man, as voracious as the prairie wolves, which whet their sharp fangs against the rocky bases that prop up the giant Cordilleras of our beloved land, has denied to him those monumental rights with which even savages adorn the last resting-places of their braves, - the trophied inscriptions carved in the enduring language in which Virgil sang and Tully burned, and in which Menander, prophetic of our Transatlantic greatness, babbled to the dull ears of ,a Roman race, which recked not of that 'proud stoic of the woods,' who, in life a victim of wrong, at death folds himself to his solemn sleep, in the language of the greatest of our :living poets, ' Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams,' but' who, also, in the apt words of the same rapt min- strel, "ike Truth crushed to .earth shall rise again, - The eternal years of God are theirs.'"   ON THE INDIAN CHARACTER.       79 While the waves of applause which ripple around this popular and characteristic rhapsody, grow calm against the solid shores of historic truth, we turn to another American view equally characteristic. 2. The Indian character as seen through7 oficial spec- tacks. Extract from  the Report of the Secretary of the Interior: - "The beneficent policy of repression, steadily pur- sued by our government towards the Indian tribes still surviving, cannot fail to strike every one but themselves. While sentimental Christianity continues I  to dwell upon the rapid extinguishment of their tribes, the archives of this department bear gratifying wit- ness to the more rapid extinguishminent of their titles. a There now remain in our borders - which were, it must be admitted, for the sake of argument, once - theirs - but about three hundred thousand of these nomad wanderers. Our people must feel an especial gratification in the proud reflection, that it is their bounty which, now reaching forth the comforts of our abundance to these remnants of tribes, supplies at the reasonable rate of some $ 10.15 per caput, the wants of such as are spared by our efficient and active army corps of Indian destructives. "This bounty is distributed by honest agents, who never fail, while dispensing it, to impress upon' {he recipients a proper regard for the moral suasion of our well-mounted, rifles. The small commissions reserved from these treaty-stipulated funds, by these agents, is too American not to be recognized with patriotic pride; and the 'especial thanks of Congress are due to these self-denying distributers for the amount which   80   THE COMC HS IORY OF THE UNITfED S rATES. they kindly leave to be disseminated among the in- tended beneficiaries. "There i's a natural jealousy among our people in those States and Territories where former laws inju- diciously, but, as it fortunately proves, unsuccessfully located these Indian remnants, against the continuous occupation of tracts of lands called reservations, to which they have been from time to time removed. I cannot too strongly recommend that this jealousy and acquisitiveness be duly respected, and new reser- vations somewhere be speedily provided. Both Provi- dence and our need of their territory plainly mark the Indians as the American: Ishmaelites, against whom everybody's hand is raised, and whose, shifting tent can only be steadied up permanently against the sun- set on the Pacific Ocean." Some people seem to think that the Indian was created to keep before us a dgcolletg style -o dress, adapted to the freedom of our institutions,-a trav- eller's costume, most convenient for the administra- tion of medical assistance, in case of such railroad divertisements and steamboat pyrotechnic displays as often enliven our journeyings. Others look upon the preservation of these remnants as providential fields for the employment of the pa- tience of domestic missionaries. Young ladies con- template them as the only living representatives of mythological Loves, the sole heirs to the bow and arrow. Others still admire them as our only legend- ary and poetic creations; the only ghostly figures that creep weirdly through our sharp-set American qua- drilles.   ON THE INDIAN CHARACUlEK. 81 82   THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED'STATES. , But while such discordant notions rasp the Ameri- can ear and conscience about their predecessors, there is a mode of hushing up all these family jars; one which seems to have been adopted in all ages, from the time-of Joshua the son of NMin, down to the Irish wakes' of our time, namely, to drown them all in the jubilant music procured and paid for at the expense of the estate to be divided up. A few words in regard: to Indian names. An affec- tionate and grateful regard for the painted races, which will soon be seen only in the picture-galleries and books of colored engravings, has sought to sow a crop of Indian names over-our lakes, rivers, mountains, and towns. Unfortunately we have succeeded in keeping scarcely enough for seed. But one State has borrowed the- name of the Indian himself, - Indian-ah? - she spelling it, however, in an un-English way, without, a h, as if she had said, "O, breathe not his name." The application of some of these names has been singularly felicitous, as Sing-Sing, where the State guests attempt no musical flights, but are made to hum quite another tune, if not to hush up altogether; Miss-ouri, whose ill-fated union in our Federal family has been attended with such left-handed rights,-. State- rights, Fanny Wrights, and, for a long time in Kansas, conflicting rights; Minnehaha, whose ringing laugh is during so long a portion of the year frozen in her soft throat; Kan-sas, suggestive of her capacity for billingsgate and free use of abusive language; Ore- gon, and yet inviting emigrants to her valuable mines   ON THE INDIAN CHARACTER.       83 while she laughs a cunning laugh under the protect- ing cap of Mount Hood; Wy-a,-dot River, as if it had come to a sort of rocky comma,- or interrupting ledge, over which it- was pausing a moment for breath to take a hop-and-skip-and-carry-one overy leap; Pot-to- wat-o-my River, seeming like a whole family council around a skillet steaming. over a fire, while the car- rotty-headed mother was slightly walloping the young- est of the party for asking some improper question; Pawn-ee Fork, reminding one of those old-clothes shops kept by U.

The' first damp observation' shows that many parts of America have never been settled at all. In" certain districts, grounds are found, as in coffee, unsettled; and good grounds exist for this, and, contradictory as it may seem, these are generally discovered in poor water. In some cases, like those of Gosnold, Raleigh, De La Roche, and others, attempts were made, and settle- ments actually planted, which seemed for a time to thrive; but the impatient planters, like curious boys, were so-, desirous of ascertaining how much their plants had grown, that they pulled them up to look at the roots,-an inspection which the plants re- sented by sulking and dying out. In other instances, fever and ague was mixed up with the first seed, and this had a chilling effect upon the husbandmen. Indeed, a hard fight is still going on in many parts of the country with this strong unsettler, the record of whose assaults and charges is found in the apothe- cary shops and doctors' offices. These highly colored little stockades and forts with the rosy-hued land- offices for the sale of the most desirable real estate, with water-lots running in front of them, often indeed comprise the entire settlement. In some instances, the character of the soil inter- fered seriously with any permanent occupation of the place. People who had no objection to watered silks, or watered paper, entertained, it has been found, well- grounded reasons for not liking an oozy surface, para- graphed between watery curves, and punctuated with bullfrogs and other pointed characters. Some of the early settlers did venture upon these maritime risks; but policy, or no policy, they ended their speculations   OF AMERICAN SETTLEMENTS GENERALLY.    89, under weeping willows, with Keat-like- epitaphs over them, - "Here lies one whose name was writ in water." Oftentimes, even where the soil was rich, the early settler became discouraged by the unexpected crops he obtained. Planting wheat, he found that it came up a rank growth of Indian corn, tasselled out into tomahawks or sharp-pointed arrows, instead, of the silken tufts which he had a right to look for in the order of nature. This result frequently took place in the valleys of the Connecticut and Mohawk, along the bainks of the Mystic River, and upon the otherwise pleasant slopes overlooking Narragansett Bay. In several instances) too, as in the case of the colo- nists shipped by the 'council of the Plymouth Com- pany, the seed thus sent was taken from heaps of full- grown vicious specimens, to be found only in London, or other large  plaaces, instead of being judiciously selected from   healthy young stocks. Such seed, )of course, not only became sour and fermented, but this fermentation spoiled whatever good grain was found accidentally mixed with it. This kind   of crop was even worse than that of the   tomahawks or arrows. Of course, these penal cropis were short-lived.  The profligate and dissolute soon died in the virtuous soli- tudes in which they had no previous experience at home   to recall and compare; and escaped as soon as possible from  settlements whose greatest, crime, :in their eyes, was that in them they could make no scores long enough to be worth running away from. Some attempted settlements here, because they could not succeed in making   any with their creditors- at A. -   90   THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. home. Of this class, many were found in the bounds of the London Company, scraped up under the charter of James I., granted in 1606,-a company which sowed their wild oats between the thirty-fourth and thirty-eighth parallels of latitude, but whose doings, un- doings, and misdoings had no parallel whatever. ' Some of this seed, lying dormant, sprouted up in these regions as late as 1861, and covered the Carolinas and Virginia with a crop worse than teazles or Canada thistles. The maxim that " frequent settlements make long friends," was doubly verified along the New England coast, where the security of the settler could- only be maintained by short and decisive footings-up of and with the breech-less and treaty-breaking Picts of our history, or by such often-planted gatherings as would, prevent their attempts to run up a score.. It is almost needless to say that in all the regions from the Penobscot River to St. Augustine, under all the various charters, and among all classes of colonists, English, Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, or Huguenot, set- tlements were often made on the walls and behind the doors of taverns, where the weekly score was kept,- a geological district mapped out in a chalk formation, the size of which seemed always to astonish the set- tler whenever his attention was particularly invited to it. Whatever his own fields bore, here the crop; was unfailing.; or rather its growth was generally in the inverse ratio to that of his wheat or tobacco patch. In a few instances settlements, fairly and perma- nently made were suddenly uprooted by sudden squalls or tempests, which, razing the hair from the heads of ;Vlr   OF AMERICAN SETTLEMENTS GENERALLY. '  91 the colonists, still, as we read of their ferocity and fury, raise our own. Such was the scalping-party that swept over Deerfield, the savage whirlwind down the valley of the Wyoming, and' the rapid gust that licked up the little settlement of Cherry Valley. Now and then also occurred   a religious tornado, which prostrated whole patches of plantations, and which,  at one time, threatened to become the prevail- ing winds of our American continent, taking the place even of our strong and steadily blowing trade-winds. Thus a company of French Huguenots, sent   out in 1565, b1)  Adniiral Coligni, and planted in Florida, X  : : were overwhelmed  by a .party of Spaniards, under Melenldez, who, after murdering them all, placed over their mutilated bodies this inscription : "We do this not as unto Frenchmen, but as unto heretics." Which was the heretical part thus mercilessly dealt with, and. which the French portion not intended to be harmed, cotemporary accounts do not furnish us with materials sufficient to enable us to discriminate. They do tell us, however, that this then fashionable mode of treat- ing religious convictions was imitated by the country- men of the French, acting upon what .was then thought to be the proper interpretation of the merciful and benign principles of The Book, viz., "doing unto oth- ers, what they do unto you " ;for soon after De Gourges, sailing from France with three ships, formed a surprise party to-two Spanish  forts, and after executing a Spanish- dalice with the garrison, took them out and hung them up in the trees like dried fruit; and fear- ing that the specimens might be mistaken, left above them the-recipe,- as follows: -' I do this -not as unto   92   THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. Spaniards, or mariners, but as unto traitors, robbers, and murderers.". Whether the Spaniards thus done for properly ap- preciated the delicate discrimination, we are not in- formed. To the statistician it may be of interest to know that of the abortive attempts at settlements within the present limits of the United States, six were made-by the English, one by the Swedes, two by Spaniards, and two by the French. Lovers of that branch of political history will be able to wring out of these figures re- sults more extraordinary than any we can torture them into. On the whole, however, notwithstanding all draw- backs and misfortunes, the settlements gained steadily on the Indians, fever and ague, the cold and exposure, tomahawks, tavern-keepers, and surprise parties. Some marriages took place, but no settlements were made on the bride, except perhaps, in the course of time, her old father-in-law and mother-in-law, who were fortu- nate if they brought with them, as' addition to her scanty stock, two whole empty trunks, their own. Queen Elizabeth did everything to promote the growth of population in her favorite colony of Virginia, except to furnish them with a personal example; but to make up for this omission, she sent out some Episcopal clergymen, provided with surplice and stole, and with licenses to marry. These obtained settlements for themselves, and zealously stimulated them in others. As soon as the settlements began fairly to demon- strate that they would succeed, they were of course vigorously patronized, and in fact " encumbered with   Bur      lDcVAIIU iAN In l1TLEMEUNT Sl GENERALLY. 93 help." Plenty of people there were then who at first, at the bare mention of American settlements, had placed their thumbs to their noses, and irreverently - ij given their fingers a quick gyratory motion in the air, but who now came forward and claimed the merit of having always been tlthe especial friends of the colo- nists, and pointed, like the very lieutenants and -aid-de- camps of General Success,- to their uniformly enter- tained convictions, triumphantly. exclaiming, "Did we not always tell you so?" As candid historians, we cannot withhold our pencils from  sketching the por- traits of these burly friends of the early years of America; these large-hearted souls, who, sitting at home over their comfortable cannel-coal fires, piled cheerily up with the dividends from the stock of some j  of the companies formed for planting these shores, which they would not touch until it got up to par, and who then, fearing that their attachments might- not be appreciated, cried out their undeviating devo- tion in voices that fairly drowned all others. From these characters, which 'only shine in the full noonday of prosperity, we  gladly -turn to Sir Francis Drake, who, as early as 1586, did not hesitate to divide his last crust with the feeble and struggling colony of Roanoke Island, succoring them by timely aid, and  not sucking from  them  the little- feeble strength which short crops and long watchings against wary foes had left, them.  Although born in England, Drake had a soul which compassed the world, around whose waist he passed the second girdle which had ever belted it.    .   "  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ,l!

It is true that Virginia carried on her bosom a Blue Ridge, as in later times some of her progeny     have borne on their backs darker ridges; but until 1620 no welts of the latter character stood out on her fair shoul- ders; 'and these, be it said to his shame, were raised by the master of a Dutch man-of-war who, on the very day in August that the Pilgrim  party embarked in the Mayflower, at Delft-Haven, in his own country, landed twenty negroes for sale on the banks of the James River, leaving a black mark which two hundred and forty-five years have barely succeeded in washing 3*   VU  LtL UTiH1U W LUK UP  ul{ 114 UNILL blAlib. out. In her very cradle, in, 1606, Virginia was loaded down and half smothered with that royal blanket, a charter." Not content with this comforter, the royal nurses from London kept piling other blankets of the same kind upon the vigorous infant, and because it was vigorous, until within the short space of fourteen years no less than four were heaped upon her. These were far from being counter-panes, but on the con- trary served in that warm climate to distress the child, and eventually to bring out eruptions. Under the second of these, in 1609, Maryland was tucked up in the same bed with Virginia; but in 1621, not find- ing the company agreeable, she was taken out by Lord Baltimore, and put into a pleasant and comfortable trundle-bed of her own; the chivalrous young lord naming the baby after Henrietta AMaria, wife of Charles I., and daughter of the gallant Henry of Navarre, afterwards Henry- IV. of France. The year 1'621 was emphasized in the infant settlement of Virginia by the introduction of cotton and the first written constitution,- two prolific American seeds that have each borne large harvests. Considering the varied uses to which the former is now applied in clothing human bodies and habitations, and the latter in padding political addresses and lawsuits, we are puzzled to conceive how the world got on, and espe- cially how congressmen managed to make speeches, or lawyers to live, prior to those great discoveries, - dis- coveries more important in some, aspects-than those of iron, the PReformation, Illinois divorces, gunpowder, steam,-the doctrine of legal insanity, Brandreth's pills, and others,- vithout which of course no well-   ' Ou OLnTiTLNTS OF VIRGINIA, ETC.   97 -Ordered  or well-digesting family can long pr- ceed. Seven yeais later Charles I. contracted to take the entire tobacco crop of Virginia; hoping probably by the free use of this narcotic to drug the alarmed politi- cal conscience of England. The ship that took the first Maryland emigrants up the Potomac to their new settlement was called the Ark and the. Dove, and carried in its beak the olive- branch of religious toleration. In 1630, the same liberality in disposing of broad strips of Amrerican  territory was shown by  King Charles I. in granting a deed, embracing North Caro- lina, South Carolina, and Georgia, to Sir Robert Heath; butin 1663 his son, the second Charles, desirous -f improving his own handwriting, which had been some- wlat neglected from his eighth year, in consequence of the necessarily active business life Cromwell had obliged him to lead, put his signature, early one foggy morning, to a  paper which somebody laidin his wfay and which, when brought out to the light, proved to be a grant to Lord Clarendon and several other pleasant gentlemanly fellows, of this same small North Ameri- can farm.   This select little knot of farmers, after building a few  barns  on their farm , discovered that it was not large enough for their purposes. Like the Irishman who wanted an additional sixpence to drink the health of the gentleman who had generously given him a   fivte-dollar bill, they desired a back field to dump manure on; and they finally obtained a second autograph from the obliging, Challes to a bit of paper, allowing them to use forever thedsmall patch lyin g ' .'                   z J U   'i:   98   THE.

The farm was kept togeth( until 1729, when it-was divided up by George II. int two parts, called North and South Carolina; the lattE half being, three years later, again split into two, an the lower part named, after the burly old landlorn Georgia. Nearly fifty years, however, before th: division, upon a tongue of land called Oyster Poin and bivalved between the Ashey and Cooper River Charleston was first set upon its uneasy foundation Whether affected :by the contiguity of Folly Island, b the use of too much pepper--always cheap in warr regions - upon the native oysters, or whether undul exhilarated by too exclusive a contemplation of th cotton seed, which seems to have enlarged its dilate and dilating pupils, the place, although but seven fee above high tide, has always been given to high notion! and subject to a certain vertigo. An admirable in gredient, the Protestant Huguenot element, tossed ou of France by the revoked edict of Nantes, was infuse into the young settlement of South Carolina in 168, The plant of liberty, however, early struck its anchor ing roots close by the side of the cotton-plant; an( although the governors, sent out by the royal proprie tors from England, continually hacked into its smoot trunk, it still grew apace, and its bracing tonic odor filled not only the regions watered by the Santee an Pedee, but were wafted northwards and over the siste Colonies. Although it is said that ' old Virginny never tires, it must have been because she had a robust constitu tion, for a busier body never existed. Always resisl ing the attempts made by the profligate royal govel   THE SETTLEMENTS OF VIRGINIA, ETC.    99 ,  .nors upon her virginity, she had to watch them, day and night, for fear that they would steal her hard' earnings and run away with them. In fact, during the sixty years that succeeded her birth at Jamestown, in 1606, she was constantly on the, alert, putting up scarecrows on her cornfields, and notices of spring- ;}. guns, to warn' away intruders; but these, so far from j frightening away, only attracted the curious bills -of the Indians. She was also forced to hold fast with might and main to the scanty wardrobe brought out ' by her from England, and with which those dissolute i  fellows, the young, titled, rakish, good-for-nothing- overseers, were always taking liberties. Fortunately for her, as well as her sisters, the two Carolinas and ji j Georgia, her shoulders were well covered by capes, so i securely fastened on that thiy could not be snatched away, and their charms exposed to the rude stare or prying curiosity of idle visitors- from France and Eng- land, and even from   staid, sober Holland. And we here take the opportunity of repelling the slander so often circulated upon Virginia, that she is "the mother of States," --a a spersion which, if true, would stain lher virgin fame, and leave a bar sinister across the shields of the States thus born out of wedlock. The first suitor for the budding affections of the youthful Georgia, or Georgiana, although bearing the suspicious name of Ogle-thorpe, proved to be a man of honorable intentions, high-minded, and in every respect faithful to his ardent vows e - a constant mate in all her joys and trials during his residence on the Savannah River, from 1732 to 1743. Virginia's royal lovers, on the  contrary, although always protesting %!     --- JIIIYV   100 THE COMQ HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. their good intentions, were' almost uniformly faithless. The last one bore the ill-omened, but appropriate name of Dun-more. . He was very importunate, and in every way attempted to get her to Wake over her then valuable property to him, but in vain; and at last so mercenary did he become, and so disagreeable did he make himself, that she was obliged to show him the door. The. spirited damsel was always plucky, and soon after this domestic difficulty made up her mind to be wholly' independent, and so in fact publicly gave. out to the whole world, saying that " she did n't care who knew it." Massachusetts gallantly stood by the young girl in her declaration, and so did all her brothers and sisters; even little Rhody tossing up her jaunty sailor's cap, and shouting out that, under Providence, she was ready to " sail in." The name of Sir Walter Raleigh is greenly twined through the earliest settlements of North Carolina. In her coasts he took a constantly augmenting inter- est, and furnished to the State its capital. His love for' the new settlement only ceased to beat with his heart. His verse, which the author of "The Fairy Queen" describes as "sprinkled with nectar, and vie- ing with the notes of the summer nightingale," was musical with her praises; and, his "History of the, World" lays- at her feet the 'tribute of' his warmil, chivalric nature. The duty which he felt and gave to the two Colonies, Virginia and North Carolina, was very different from the duties which his successors endeavored to draw from them,-duties so onerous as to drain not only   THE SETTLEMENTS OF VIRGINIA, ETC.,   101    the pockets but the hearts of the young communities   1g from which they were pressed out.           :  But amid all the trials to which Virginia was sub-  i3 jected by-the rapacity of her governors and 'the un-   II1I sated appetites of councils, named by the home board     corporators, there was one. point which she could    i always contemplate with -satisfaction, namely, Old Point Comfort,-a grandmotherly place, which her      ' children then, and since, often visited, laying their hot hIeads lovingly in her lap, until her pleasant breezes - cooled their feverish throbbings.1 Tobacco was first grown in Virginia in 1616; and    i;! we crave leave to add, that although  much piped about ever since, has never ceased to create a smoke;  its curls hanging thickly and gracefully around the heads of its world-wide admirers from that time down .  i to the present,--an instange of undt    custom .    ;N rarely seen.            -            ' -* Virginia, however, did not grow all of her luxuries; for, in 1620, we find her imtporting ninety respectable unmarried girls,'who, on their arrival, and after pay-    ment of customary duties, -were soon disposed of. This successful invoice was followed, the succeeding :year,  1i! by a cargo of sixty more, the price for whom  in-j( creased, after they were landed, from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty pounds of tobacco. How this advance affected the relations between them    jt and the lower-priced wives of the preceding year,- whether it laid the foundation for. the difference be- tween the F. F. V.'s and the white trash, the want of  newspapers and of well-preserved family bills does not  ?i enable us to judge. i,?i Irdl   102 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES' Certain it is that this commercial rape was as 6or- dially acquiesced in by the seized damsels, as was the rape of the Sabines by those young ladies; and proved - to be as beneficial to the growth of the infant settle- ment as that novel match-making on the banks of the Tiber. The descendants of these unions on the James and Potomac would have been more numerous had not their numbers been thinned off by Indian knives, which were very busy in 1622, 1623, and 1644-1646. This last war was followed, three years later, by a petty imitation of the civil strife which had raged for seven years between the Parliament and Charles I. in Enlg- land, and which ended, in the latter country, by taking off the king's head, and in Virginia by taking away many of their former constitutional privileges. Crom- well fumigated them thoroughly in, their own tobacco- smoke, until all the smell of loyalty was gone. Upon the accession of Charles II., in 1660, arbitrary legis- lation was sought here, as in England, to stamp out the rights of the people which had silently but steadily grown up into a stiff crop; but resist- ance followed, and in this struggle between Virginia and the crown the succeeding years were spent, until 1754. The principal event in the history of the settlement of North Carolina was the fancy constitution furnished for it in 1669; by John Locke, whose understanding about -it differed wholly from that of the people, through whose heads it never could be got; Besides having plenty of time on his hands, Locke made his constitution so long, and divided it up into so many   THE SETTLEMENST UF' VlltlRNIA, EL t'. AU(W parts, that the youngest settler died before he had read it half through, and bequeathed the further perusal of it to his descendants, with 'all his shares in what it most resembled, - the Dismal Swamp. A sniff of this vague, shadowy constitution, or bun- dle of airy rights, by the adjacent settlement of South- Carolina, affected her with such a fit of sneezing, that it kept on from that time until 1865, and from which she only found relief now and then in her cotton pocket-handkerchiefs. We may remark that it is a vulgar error to sup-, pose that the rivers in South Carolina run up hill,- just as it is a common mistake to believe that the Tar River, in North Carolina, originates in a turpentine district, and flows in a thick stream into Panllico Sound. I We may. as well, also, correct the almost universal notion, that the inhabitants of Charleston have a particular fondness for fire as a steady, every- day diet. The chief incident which marked the uneventful record of the Georgia settlement was the advent, in 1736, of John Wesley. He preached in the Methodist language to the Creeks, Choctaws, and Cherokees; but those short-lived tribes, attending on a certain occasion one of his camp- meetings, and listening to the benevolent missionary giving out one of his brother Charles's hymns, became so discouraged that they went back to their own camp anid ways. In addition to what we have already said of Mary- land, we would state that its mild climate attract-' ed canvas-back ducks, as its mild principles of re-   L fU4 THE COMC HST ORY OF THE 'UNITED STATES. ligious toleration brought, to its borders swarms of emigrants.

AS a magnet,.laid amid a heap of iron-filings, gathers them    all to itself in close-fitting unity, so the figure of John Smith crystallizes about it the elements of the early settler's life in Virginia. Nor upon the banks of the Chickahominy alone does John Smith stalk in romantic proportions ;but through all times, in every kingdom, state, city, and village, at all epochs, and in every shade of barbarism or civilization, is he found.   New York holds 187; Philadelphia, 231; Boston, 35; Brooklyn, 118; London, 480; and every capital in   the world  its; own  appropriate  comple- ment. No  railroad   can  be run that does not touch    his farm; no joke that does not skim      his peculiarities; no   portrait that does not contain    his features; no   JOHN SMTH.         107 conductor's stealings that does not comprise his con- tributions; no miller's breakfast-bell that does not toll the knell of a portion of his grist. As dyers classify mankind by the color of their skins, wine-growers belt the world by isothermal vine-lines, and lawyers divide the human race into plaintiffs and defendants, so the historian, straining his telescopic gaze;over the centuries and the globe, and discarding the division of the species into "man- kind and the Beecher family," - no longer appropriate since the publication of "Norwood A reduced the latter down to the common level,-justly sweeps all man- kind into two great classes, the Smiths and the rest of creation. And so John Smith finds appropriate place, not only in every history, but a special niche and chapter to himself. We might perhaps have put this select men- tion of a' great public benefactor, an erudite scholar, and universal toiler, into a note, smothered up in an appendix, dimmed by the milky-way of small asterisks, and hazily obscured by countless references and au- thorities; but this injustice to the merits of an ancient family, whose tombs mound every churchyard, and whose door-plates shine on almost every house in our cities and towns not appropriated to drugs, groceries, or confectioneries, would, we are persuaded, sorely wound the public conscience. The, origin of the Smiths, like that of so many other distinguished families, -is involved in distressing doubt. Audacious investigation, with a natural wish to pene- trate to the roots, and too fearless of consequences where prudence perhaps might be better satisfied   108. THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. with a limited view of ancestry, has pressed its in- quiries up and down genealogical trees until it has unearthed Smiths at the base, Smiths in the sap, Smiths up the stump, and even Smiths dangling at the end of the branches. No natibn looks down in theory from such lofty heights of indifference upon ancestral distinctions as the American; none can better afford to cut down their genealogical, as they do their natural, forests; yet none are so fond of look- ing -up to these airy and wavinga altitudes, and none that more carefully spare the tree which in youth sheltered them, and which waves, like the flag, long and, fruity to their eyes. An American book of lead- ing families would be larger than the London Direc- tory, and make the fortune of even the Congressional Printer. True, the family herald would in nearly all these cases, like the chroniclers of ancient states, and the biographer of the Smithls, be obliged to substitute fogg3y conjecture for well-defined tracings. They would all find that their researches would, if carried back far enough, converge to the same focal point; and if produced at equal distances in the future, diffuse themselves into a common social, monetary, and undistinguishing equality:. for families and states are much like boys at the ends of a balanced board, now up, now down, at one time touching the ground, then curving upward through medium spaces to a culminating point, while some one at the other end is noiselessly passing through a reversed career. And so John Smith balances and pendulates on the same board with a Van Rensselaer, John Brown with a Tozewell, Mr. Snooks with a Winthrop, and John Doe" with a Hampton. ;                "   JOHN SMTH.     '   109 There is, we think, but little doubt that the Hebrew Samson, the Greek Hercules, the Spanish Cid, the Scandinavian Thor, and' the English Arthur of the Round Table, were each the John Smith of his nation and time, a multiform unity swinging round the circle of varied labor, hard work, and heroic deeds, accom- plishing under one name-a family one, possessed at various times by several individuals - the work of all reapers, sewing-machines, cow-milkers, cw-ilers, cotton and woollen factories. These national heroes, like the John Smiths, their descendants now, were arrayed in warm climates in a fragmentary style of short dress; in the middle regions in a Highland garb, appropri- ately frilled or furred; and in the north with a canine material, heroic in quality, and modishy artistical, - a bark. The most reliable studies trace the smith genealogy back to Vulcan's workshop, the original Smith being one of those employed on designs for Achilles's shield, a claim which experts in coats-of-arms will not readily stamp as a forge-ry. As there is no period of history without its John Smith, so there!s no profession that does not enroll, no trade that does not contain, no occupation, from an office-holder's up to that of an honest man's, 'that does not embrace his name. Everywhere, on the sea and' land; between every parallel of latitude, almost between every pair of sheets; at every pole and at- every polling-place; on all rivers and in every strait; at every point, and even at Point-no-point; on the top, at the middle and bottom  of every hill, enterprise, company, board of directors, and job; in all churches,   "O THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. * ORIGINAL FULL-LENGTH PORTRAIT OF JOHN SMTH. t   JOHN SMTH.         1" synagogues, mosques, and temples; preaching, singing, and listening; talking all tongues, as well as curing, drying, and eating them; in prisons, police-stations, pulpits, grand-jury and other boxes; to-day hung, to-morrow putting on his black cap and sentencing the culprit to the rope's end, and the day following condemning a pair to a less hempen noose; in the pugilistic ring, or ecclesiastical fight; the actor on the stage, and at the same- time the spectator in the box, looking at himself personating his own character,- for every character is his,--everywhere, and in every- tling, is found this jolly, morose, lazy, active, sleepy, wakeful, fighting, pacific, coarse, refined, fat, lean, tall, short, blue-eyed, black-eyed John Smith. In truth, when we think of him as ubiquitous, om- niscient, and omnipresent, doing all things in all places, carrying on all businesses, living on all the real estate, owning at some time or other all the per- sonal property, pocketing all the greenbacks, whistling to all the dogs, riding all the horses, looking after all the little poodle dogs, buying shoes and stockings for all the children agreeable and disagreeable, we get into such a world of John Smiths, such a nightmare of Johns, such a maelstrom of Smiths, such a gurgling, roaring, splitting, spitting, laughing, screeching, titi- lated, exhilarated, carnival, and Fourth of July of John Smiths, that we seem  to be in a room lined with mirrors that reflect only John, Smiths from all sides; indeed, we almost fancy ourselves a John Smitl, our father and mother a John Smith, and all our aunts, cousins, uncles, nephews, brothers, and sisters, and even their clergymen, grocers, shoemnakers, boothlacks,   "2 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. to be John Smiths, and that our last note and the mortgage on our house is owned by John Smith. But the Smithl family do not, create all the humor and spend all the jollityiipon others. Funny are the scenes which transpire among themselves. -At a family party two John Smiths introduced, and each staring at his other self, is a conundrum; three a charade, in which the whole, company give it up, A popular young lady, with card in her belt to carry the memory of her numerous engagements, finds herself swimming in doubt as to the identity of her partners, when John Smith claims, her in the next dance, then for the following cotillon, then bows over her hand for the succeeding polka, and so confronts her at every turn of the figure and every return of the dance, until she doubts her own individuality, and requests to be baptized over again with a new name to get out of the  tangle. Then at a family dinner-party of Smiths, when Mr. Smith asks Mr. John Smith the part of the turkey he prefers, and several voices in different tones and keys indicate as many different portions of the bird, there is a delightful series of warm explanations which enables the meal to become healthily cool, l while each of the responders courteously leaves the piece he wants and takes one he did not desire. Among the comic situations which Mr. Smith un- consciously creates are, that of a conveyancer, in a large city, endeavoring to trace a title through a J. S., or trying to ascertain which of the one hundred in the directory is the rightful defendant in a judgment, or the mortgagor in a mortgage, constituting a lien on the property sought to be transferred; or a country   JUHN SM1ilT.        11  cousin, for the first time in New York or Philadelphia, consulting the directory to find her puzzled way to the forgotten residence of her cousin John Smith, or innocently asking a polite but humorous gentleman, in the street whether he knows John Smith's house; or a clergyman in a city prayer-meeting asking John Smith to lead in prayer, and finding three or four, with closed eyes, responding to the request; or a notary making up his mind where to leave a notice of protest of a large note on the indorser John Smith, who wittily wrote his name without any address under it. Indeed,. it would be one of the causes celMbres for a jury to determine whether a child might not guilt- lessly mistake his parent who bore only this undis- tinguishing name; whether a forgery of the name could be committed; whether an express company be bound to deliver a trunk to this nominis umbrce; or whether a, wife, Mrs. John Smith, could be lawfully convicted of eloping with any one. Then when John Smith comes to die, in the church- yard, and afterwards when the dead arise- but we stagger under the vision of puzzled bones and stop. We cannot write more lucidly the history of the John Smith of Pocahontas fame. It grows mythical the more we look at it; an abstraction dancing over the coals of the early settlement of Virginia, a face and figure flitting like a twisting flame, up, around, and through the grate; seeming as we try to fix our atten- tion upon him like a dozen different men, one falling in love. with the young squaw, another surveying the James and  Rappahannock, another mastering the turbulent spirits of a dissolute and discontented sjttle- ]El    "4 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ment; another caught and brought before Powhatan, while a graceful girl of twelve summers gently puts away the descending club; another sailing to England, and peeping out ever and anon among the friendly faces that make the living frame to her young virgin face, yet again dissolving and mnelting into the gray dimness of the morning light. Of only one thing do we feel certain in regard to John Smith in general, the average John Smith, that the portrait here presented, taken by instantaneous photography, representing his multitudinous character, is the only genuine   and original likeness ever published.    / *                  .  -  ^   "-i CHAPTER IV.

Not more various are men's religions than their New England convictions; as checkered  and  contrary as the black and white squares on a   Scotch shawl. Some people, of pious trainings but of an agricultural turn of mind, hold the idea that New England came, like the wonderful coach in the story of Cinderella, from    a pumpktin; and hence travel naturally to the conclusion that the principal mission of her people is to keep up Thanks- giving day.   "6 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. Others run all their lives with the notion that the Yankee States were settled by a race of peripatetic traders, a revival of the school of Aristotle,--let out in Greece, and taking a play-spell here. Their picture of New England would be a pedler, dipped like a tallow-candle in an economical, tight-fitting suit of tawny homespun, driving a wagon full of tin notions, clocks, and a variety of domestic nut- megs, artistically whittled out of bass-wood, singing Old Hundred, with a pitch-pipe close to his nose to keep it in tune. Others, on the contrary, regard it as a large, full-bearing orchard in autumn, laden with golden fruit, fall-pippins, pearmains, seek-no-furthers, russets, and spitzenbergs, supplying its owners, the neighborhood, and the distant market with their in- comparable harvest. Fortunate for the historian, for debating-societies, and the magazines are these varie- gated opinions. They give a spiciness to New Eng- land, as if she were a tropical garden instead of a poor-man's patch, fenced in with rocks and spiked down with long pegs to prevent the frost in the spring from heaving her up uncomfortably. They serve, like French cookery, to present the same dish simmering in various sauces under different aspects and names, and yet all from the same little market-basket. Cooke, the comic actor, who hated to be crowded, once so successfully used upon^ a stage-driver his extraordinary power of changing the expression of his face, -getting in at one door of the coach, slipping out of the one opposite, and again presenting himself with a new style of visage,--that he took all the inside to himself. And so it has been with the New ,                    *   OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NEW ENGLAND, STATES. 117  England character. It has so many phases that it requires almost the entire omnibus of American his- tory to itself. One point is quite certain, that the first settlers had a hard place to land on, and a great many sharp Indian points to provide against after they had landed. St. Augustine was fifty-five, Jamestown fourteen, and the baby Dutch settlement on Manhattan Island ten years of age, when the little English congregation which had passed thirteen years at Leyden in Holland, stowed away in two small vessels, one of sixty and the other?f one hundred and eighty tons, - stepped out of their cold cabins upon the. colder rock of) Plymouth. It was four days before Christmas; but for want of good fireplaces they did not hang up their stockings. It was as much as they could do to keep from hanging themselves. Their nearest white neigh- bors were at Port Royal, Nova Scotia,. fie. hundred miles clistant,-- a trifle too far away to invite New- t Year's calls.          '            i Most of the party were obliged to wade on shore, thus breaking the ice for those who followed; the    i spray of the sea freezing as it fell upon them, makling them quite ice-clad, in fact almost as shaggy and pointed as their inside purposes and character. They carried on shore one dead body, the only one who had died on the voyage of one hundred and-six. days; the first planting in that field, which in time, like the-rest- of the world, was to be claimed as God's  acre.

J1U or corn;' and even twob years after the landing, we are told that the stock on hand cif the latter was so small that only five kernels were allowed for each private,- anl allowance which, since the great Rebellion, seems incredibly small. There was a Carver among the party, and, being a. sharp fellow, he was appointed Governor; but as there was but little meat to be sliced, - deer being scarce and high priced,- and the Indians seldom giving any quarter, he soon pined away and died. Cape Cod was not far distant, but the emigrants being without boats, the fish, especially without potatoes, were poor pick- ing. A  few years later, however, and there were large fishing-parties made up, which not only took in fish, but each other, by hook and by crook., The grapes of Martha's Vineyard, at the time of which we speak, hung so high as to be very sour., Besides the Puritans, it is well known, set their faces against the cup, as they did against kissing. The modern town of Dux-bury, which nudges Plymouth on the A east, was then too young to afford -much game, even for the long reaches of Miles Standish, who was obliged to content himself with s'tch small shootings as the Narragansetts afforded. Massasoit, however, was, the fast friend of the set- tlers, and made a treaty which, in the bluest times, he always kept in-violate, In 1629 a patent was received from that accom- Ilished penman Charles I., incorporating "The Gov- ernor and Company of Massachusetts Bay, in New England "; which eventually proved' to be, what most patents are, not worth, the paper it was written on. i   1.20 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED- STATES. New Hampshire and a part of Maine, included in this patent, was as early as 1622 sold out to two enter- prising young gentlemen, Sir Ferdinand Gorges and Captain John Mason; but after an experiment of nineteen years, these royal speculators resold their state rights to Massachusetts, which held on to them until 1680, when Charles II., in order to make a place for a friend and to encourage lawsuits about titles in the idle courts, erected New Hampshire into a sep- arate Province, independent of Massachusetts, but de- pendent on himself. Lying under cold snow-white sheets, with jealous neighbors, the French settlers of Canada and Acadia, ready to put pins in the youngster and keep her crying, and if possible to stunt her growth, Maine was long- est in her cradle of anyof the infant settlements. As early a,s 1602 some Frenchmen landed on her coast, but only remained long enough to make a few eyelet- holes in that watery frill which the- busy but chill fingers of the Atlantic has wrought upon her eastern hem. It was reserved for the sturdier Saxon race to take- the infant in hand, and, by hardier treatment, to bring her up to robuster strength. The first serious effort was made in 1622. That court pet, Gorges, obtained, in 1639, a charter, which not only covered- the present State, but lapped over into the borders of Massachusetts. The ^ latter resented this interference with her own by making counter-claims, and in 1652 insisted upon taking the child .under its exclusive pro- tection. The contest, carried into the English courts, outlived of course its original promoters, but was at last, in 1677, terminated, to the astonishment of the *  -.         \   OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NEW ENGLAND STATES. 121 suitors and the disgust of the lawyers. The custody of the infant, now grown to be A stripling, was awarded to Massachusetts, which, always looking after the Maine chance, got a most obstreperous minor in charge. InF 1630 a band of eight hundred and forty bodies and souls, led by John Winthrop, and tempted by a spring of good water, settled on the peninsula of Shaw- mut, and began Boston, which, we are glad to say, is not finished yet. May it never be; but, ever growing, may it carry on wagon-making as successfully as in former days, furnishing hubs for those covered trans- portation carts which trundle westward, and which, if allowed to stand still over night, swarm into a new- colony the next morning. The following, year a miniature church and state experiment was made in the Massachusetts settlement,  by limiting the eligibility to civil office to church- members, whether civil or not. * The first log-cabin builders, who had  themselves fled from the knife of the law, whetted it to a keen edge and turned it upon their fellow-sufferers, who differed from them in their religious or moral senti- ments. Profane swearing, tippling taking interest on loans of money, and wearing expensive jewelry became legal crimes, among those who had suppressed with Spartan rigor their exercise in themselves and their families. The  next generation, in 1658, could not tolerate drab coats or drab principles,' and sought' to." put down  the new fashions by hanging up several of their owners in them.  The wood-colored styles multi- plied of course, notwithstanding the crimson mode of 6 i   122 THE COMC 'HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. dealing with them,-a mode which, whenever men- tioned, brings up a flush on every fair New England cheek to' this -day. The flush is not likely to be left urmsummoned so long as the enemies of New England have any ink left, or so long as her own gifted sons preserve in choicest amber the well-em- balmed and dramatic specimens. In 1635 Roger Williams, illuminated by principles of religious toleration, unkindled as yet in the Puritan settlements of Massachusetts Bay, Salem, and Boston, carried his softly burning torch out of the reach of the -chill breath of the General Court, which sought in vain to blow out the wavering flame.. He pitched his'tent on the Blackstone River where- it widens into Narragansett Bay, and there grafted such a lovely little bud of religious equality upon the old trunk of settled law, that, swelling under Provi- dence into the State of Rhode Island, it has become one of the finest fruit-trees in our American orchard. Some people, of aquatic notions and learning their- geography in the pitching hold of a yacht, have erro- neously supposed that Rhode Island was included in the state of Newport. Such notions rest on very sandy foundations, and are no more to be trusted than the speculations of the idly learned about the round tower of that resort for capital sea-bathing. The settlement of Rhode Island, like the other American plantations, was kept alive and stirring by Indian wars; but, aided by the Narragansetts, she succeeded at last, after attempting to bury their hatch- ets, in burying the Pequods themselves, leaving not one to perpetuate the seed.   OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NEW ENGLAND STATES. 123 Meanwhile, the valley of the Connecticut, visited  ' by exploring parties from Plymouth Colony under the younger Winthrop, and by hgavy flanked Dutchmen from the island of Manhattan, had also attracted at- tention to its valuable real estate; and its lots of course were mapped out and deeded in that first-class broker's office, the Court of Charles I., situated in London.  'A * - Wethersfield, although  it then had no onions to affect their eyes, made the mouths of a party of emigrants, who went there under- Hooker in June;,     , 1636, to water pleasantly, as they 'gaped over its broad meadow-lands, shaded with huge trees, and  dipping their heavy grasses into the wide and flowing  river.

Harvard College has since got up, several Storeys; and although Sparks have been applied to the edifice, it still stands, like a tower set on a hill, diffusing its learned light to Holmes happy and genial, reaching upward to Longfellow, and even illuminating men Whittier than he. We have now briefly traced the settlements of five of the New England States, bringing down their his- tory I 1643, when, with the exception, of spunky Rhode Island, they formed their first union against the witty but out-witted French of Acadia on the northeast, the trading, solid Dutch of Manhattan, and the universally hostile Indian tribes, whose enmity now became in the inverse ratio of their hunting- grounds. The sixth of these States, Vermont, came late and strugglingly among her brothers and sisters. Both New York and New Hampshire pouted and grumbled at the appearance of the new-comer, and threatened to smother her in the cradle. But the child, fed on simple food, and breathing the healthy   OF THE SETTLEMENT OF THE NEW ENGLAND STATES. 125 air of the Green Mountains, grew apace after its birth in 1724, and got such a good Constitution in 1777, that she at length acquired all her rights; and what by fishing in the Connecticut, hunting among her ever- green hills, and keeping' to her mutton and her last, she looked as she sat in the old continental school- 'house as fresh, blooming, and thrifty as any. Vermont early sent away her surplus beef and swine, but she kept plenty of pluck at home. It is sometimes said that if the Western States had been first discovered, New England would never have been settled at all; but this seeming reproach upon the hard and stern features of New England soil and cli- mate warms into a compliment, when we see what fabrics of iron, cotton, and woollen have been conjured from her narrow means, what wealth dangles from her I  hooks, what oil she gets without blubbering, what a clean white marble face she puts on our houses and stores, and what nutmegs and tropical wonders she -picks up from her beeches and haze-le bushes, and what seasoning she distributes to spice our table with literary condiments.   CHAPTER V.

The corner-stone of the Western metropolis was laid by a mason employed by-the Dutch East India Company, whose wide   breeches, glittering  kneebuckles,   and large slouched hat, set off byra smart feather, seemed to the straight-limbed, wondering Algonquins, as they huddled in friendly curiosity around him,- to belong to   THE SETTL:MRErT Oor EW YO0K. 127   128 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. some well-fed, fat Mercury, 'fresh fromin a distant Olym- pus, taking a pleasant trip to their simple island. The spirits were not enclosed in a corner-stone, as is customary at these raisings, but were more judiciously used by the sagacious Hendrick Hudson among the bewildered spectators. Beautiful were the sights which greeted the eye of the adventurous Dutch navigator, as on the twenty- third day of September, 1609, he cast anchor in the broad bay of New  York.  On every side the shores were feathered by woods, freshy painted by the liberal hand of an American autumn.   The varied trees, the golden willow, the scarlet sumach, the red and white maples, the  sassafras, mixing with' the oaks and beeches and  the birch, -- unassociated as yet with schools or discipline,-had beguin to blaze in their va- ried gorgeous hues, and their leaves to cover the ground with carpets of beautiful patterns. Upon the branches climbed vines that fell from tree to tree, draping them in garments whose innocent height rivalled those, of the Indians who found shelter beneath them. Through these woods the mocking-bird trilled its varied song, its original strains almost as liquid and sweet as those of its mimic successor, the unfeathered biped -who now lures the modern New-Yorker to greenly arching saloons, and there exchanges notes withhim.  The humming-bird, too, darted in sparkles through the leafy avenues, -not as now carried upon the top of a lady's head, but dipping its own bill in'the wild flowers that hung through all the Boweries of Manhattan. Pigeons, unplucked, sped unhurt through all the saloons of nature. Doves, not those mellifluous   THE SETTLEMENT OF NEW YORK.     129 names that invite to restaurants, and there present their -dear bills to the stranger, but the gayly plumed and round-necked  birds, cooed in the thickets. Coveys of quails occupied the place of those other coveys, which, turned to jail-birds, now flutter behind bars. Here and there troops of wild turkey wheeled in long circles, instead of dangling, as now, by one leg in front of a Broadway market. In the untroubled waters oysters made their own beds, and tucked themselves in as they saw fit, undis- turbed by the injurious names of hard shell which a. party of frogs or others might croak out around them. The opossum had not yet lent its name to deceitful concealments, but openly showed its offspring in its domestic pouch. Turtles, although wearing the green, innocently walked around with their feet upon the honest earth, instead of spreading themr upwards in the air, with their backs uneasily indorsing the city's dirty side- walks, their office-like fatness attracting, the liquorish eye of some gourmand. Even the bears licked their own cubs with innocent delight, not .only in Wall Street, but in all the un- walled places in and about New York.- The thrifty otter - the only banker on the whole island - made his deposits in safety; nor was he frightened, as he slowly accumulated the savings of his well-spent life, by the lively sallies of the jackldaw, carrying ever with him the burglarious instruments of his trade; nor heeded the harmless slanders of the woodpecker, as he gratified his strange taste in finding out and exploring the ten- der or rotten character of the neighboring trees. 6*              I   130 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. In keeping with these sylvan and rustic scenes were the native owners. They disdained the waste of time involved in the frequent change of dress; appearing in the same costume, morning and evening. Nothing could be in greater contrast than the simple toilets- of these proprietors of the island of Manhattan and their painted successors of our own day. The few men who owned the 141,486 lots into which the surface of New York City is now triturated, seemed, in the plain- ness of their attire and manners, to be, only squatters upon a territory not their own, nor carried their feath- ered heads half as high as the modern trader in tape and calico, squeezed intowa space often only sixteen feet and eight inches wide by one hundred deep. -Children were kept in due subordination. Instead of attending parties or clubs, they were quietly hung upon a nail at the door of the wigwam; the heir of a square mile being suspended in unwhimpering silence, until his grave progenitors took their fill- of nuts and sleep. There were no complaints of taxes, dirty streets, very- common councils, or cheating at elections. The uncertainty and tediousness of legal proceed- ings were unknown. The plaintiff was his own attor- ney, jury, judge, and sheriff; deciding the case sum- marily, and doing execution on the defendant between sunset and sunrise. Lingering only a few days among these primitive inhabitants, - shooting game, doubtless, from the an- cient trees occupying the very spot at the corner of Nassau and Wall Streets, where, in less than one hun- dred and eighty years afterwards, the first Federal Con- gress met, where, four years after that meeting, Wash-   THFE SETTLEMENT OF NEW YORK.'     131 ington was inaugurated President, and where, a few ogenerations later, more money was daily disbursed than would have sufficed to buy all the then settle- ments of America, Hudson turned his little craft of eighty tons up the river which has since borne his narne.  Banks, since famous for historic events; or wed to literary natings, happy and dear, attracted for forty leagues his pleased attention. Wealth and taste have since embossed cities, towns, cultured villas, and grounds upon these shores; fringed them   with varied foliage native and exotic, and thrown over them all .the lace-like illusions of legends, stories, poetic fancies, and fairy-tales; but to the simple, honest eyes -of Hudson nothing had ever presented -itself more wonderful than that ever unrolling panorama of wood and wave, dripping with the intense and varied colors with which nature saturates and transfigures our autumnal woods. The bosky reaches of Hoboken; the Palisades with their high, massive walls propping up the sky, which leans as lovingly as heaven can upon New Jersey without being taken for railroad purposes; the placid waters, since named Spuyten   Duyvil, which parted Manhattan from the main-land, and sent back from its well-framed looking-glass, promontory and foliaged steeps, laced with scarlet vines; the gentle slopes of Westchester, sliding into the sea-like river, unwounded by rails, and innocent of the foul-mouthed smoke of candle-factories; the long-curving bays of Rockland, adorned with crimson capes, pinned with rocky points, yet so' as advantageously to show   off their bare shoulders; the native site of Sunnyside, where after   132 THE COM3IC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. dwelt the gentle, lamb-like Irving, as true and loyal a soul as was ever lent to men to draw them up where late he went back himself; the grand, majestic Highlands, with their muster-roll of glories, pennoned with crimson banners hung out from  every rock- anchored fort of nature, among them Cro' Nest, the home of that Culprit Fay, whose love treason has been pardoned before so many domestic tribunals; the lake-like bay of New-Burgh, so well sentinelled by its double sentry of shores, which challenge sharply every passer-by; and the dentating, curved shores that stretch in slow haste northwards; often channelled by playful brooks that lay their kissful obedience into the loving la p of the mother river, or were clasped by bracelets of burning maples, whose clustered garnets shone on her rounded arms, - all these varied charms quite intoxicated the sober Hudson, keeping him con- stantly on deck, and causing heavy draughts on the ship's supply of Schiedam. He brought to the Half-Moon off the present city of Hudson,- then altogether too young to present, him with its freedom in a box; and ini a small boat was rowed;up the fresh waters of the river beyond, as far as Albany, - the Trojans assert as far as Troy; but in this a-bridge-d compendium we cannot pause to lay our hands- on the necessary documents to settle this question. Suffice it to say that there being no legislature in session at Albany, he got away without being fleeced, or even being obliged to listen to a speech from the speaker. He was also spared a sight of the collection in the Agricultural Hall, and thus kept his favorable   THE SETTLEMENT OF NEW YORK.      133 opinion of the soil and its capacity. His report to Iis employers, on his return in November following, was such as to stimulate the company to send another vessel the next year to trade with the natives; a trade which was conducted too much on the " heads I win, tails you lose" system to be other than advan- tageous to the Batavian pedlers. A few of the traders remained, opening stores in the slow settlement of New Amsterdam; putting up a windmill in what is now Pearl Street, raising the -wind very easily, and taking as generous a toll from the Indian grists, as the" natives now take from the strangers who frequent tie island in search of bargains. The settlement grew then, as now, by importation; for although its trade increased, it was not until 1625 that the first white child was born within the present limits of the State. The growth!of the place, however, was such, that in 1613, Samuel Argal, returning from    an expedition against the French settlement of Port Royal, was at- tracted into the harbor of New   Amsterdam, where, finding several huts and the windmill, he compelled an allegiance, during his two days stay, to England. The arbitrary principles of James I., however, were, too repulsive to the sturdy Dutch to make them   ad- here to this allegiance longer than the existence of the force which compelled it. The Republic of the United Netherlands,- twisted together of the two strands, fur- nished the one by the religious freedom  generated by the Reformation -under Luther, and the other drawn out. by  the mailed hand of William  of Orange from the  hard clutch of Philip II. of Spain, held by its strong yet soft cord the early emigrants from   it to  o.   134 THE COMC HSTORY OF TE UNITED STATES.

Small in dimensions, struggling against the whole force of the sea --on the north, from whose overwhelming devastation it is, only saved by dikes, anchored by gigantic stones brought from  Norway, and built up from thirty to fifty feet higher than the land they guard; its flat meadow surface, ever moist, with water, divided by canals which serve the purposes both of fences and roads in other lands, and through which the water is kept flowing by a wonderful and hourly worked system of pumping,--this little state, conquered' from the sea by industry, from Spain and the Inquisition by bravery unmatched, from a moneyed aristocracy by incessant vigilance, stood a peer among the largest and proudest monarchies of Europe. Her traders carried their square-rigged, heavy sterned ships in every port from the Cape of Good Hope to Lap- land ; and Amsterdam drew  bills of exchange against shipments of linen and woollen goods, manufactured by herself, and of spices imported from her East India possessions; upon every commercial city in the world. The sea-fowl that drifted across her bright, sparkling meadows daily 'from the ocean, which she held. at arm's-length, - althoughl rolling its white surf higher than the chimneys of her houses,- could take a bird's- eye view of a population the thriftiest, of cities the most prosperous, of homes the 'most comfortable, in Europe. While Dutch enterprise thus built up a hap- py state at home, and sent thriving colonies abroad, her scholars were advancing the republic of letters, and giving international law to the world. Grotitis at this   136 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. time defined the rights and duties of war, and helped to bridle its atrocities by bits hammered from the sickles and reaping-hooks of peace. No wonder, then, that the thick-set burghers of Utrecht, Haarlaem, Ley- den, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam, although transferred to a newer Amsterdam, clung with pride to their na- tive land, damp though it was in every pore; and that the square vrouw gratefully preserved her family recol- lections along with her thickly quilted petticoats, her oleycooks, krulers, and her own dark, well-aired com- plexion. The government of the settlement was, although commercial in its aims and purposes, very maternal, whether under the East India Company, which , lasted until 1623, or under the West India Com- pany, which then succeeded it with larger powers and authority. Under the last company Peter Minuit was sent out as the first governor, in 1625. The same year some enterprising Hollanders cour- ageously passed the East River, and, bravely encoun- tered the perils of a residence in Brooklyn, from whose Heights so many now look down upon the parent city of New York, - an unhappy type of our civilization in private life: As yet all was serene in the infant colony of New Amsterdam, as if the lunar influence of the Half- Moon still shone upon its peaceful trade and growing profits. Invitations were sent to the people of Massachusetts Bay and their children in the valley of the Connecticut to come and take tea; and they in turn courteously asked the Amsterdamers to eat clam- chowder and pumpkin-pie, adding, however, at the   THE SETTLEMENT OF NEW YORK.    137 bottom of the note, that they hoped, for reasons which they gave, that their guests would not bring with them any beaver-skins to swap with the Indians around Narragansett Bay.     '  The next year, 1626, Governor Minuit made a large real estate transaction, purchasing the whole island of Manhattan from the Indians for twenty-four dollars, - at deed without a name in the annals of American settlements. As the purchase   embraced fourteei thousand square acres, we leave it to the millions of advanced juvenile readers who, we expect, will use this history in schools, to cipher out, the price per acre; while a still more forward class might deter- mine the amount of land which such a sum would now procure in Wall or Nassau Streets. In 1629 the Dutch West India Company, in order to entice the Van Rensselaers, Van Vechtens, Van Warts, Van Wycks, Brinkerhoofs, and other brown-colored dwell- ers at home, away from their tulip-beds, canals, and storks, to the growing young, colony, promised to any fifty persons who would settle upon it a tract of land upon the Hudson River sixteen miles in length, annex- ing only two conditions, - that the settlers should pur- chase the lands of the Indians, and make due pro- vision for the minister and school-teacher. Under this promise four companies, headed each by a leader, or patroon, settled the' southern half of the present State of Delaware; for the Dutch claim ex-- tended from  Cape Henlopen on the south to Cape Cod..               a The next year an agent, of the Van' Rensselaers purchased a tract twelve miles square below Albany,   138 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED  TA'l'AT'V. paying for it in goods,--a tract which had many blank -pages, over which contentious pens have been scribbling, sometimes with, red ink, within the living memory of our readers. With prosperity came, as usual, care and trouble. Complaints were made of Minuit. The Yankees on the east, and the Swedes on the Delaware, were jeal- ous of Dutch rule, and stickled for their own institu- tions, political and social.- The fort, established by V^  Myu it at Hartford, was like a piano-forte in an in- convenient place, strongly objected to, and its airs raised a brisk breeze around it. Finally, in 1633, Peter was requested to give up his stewardship; and Wouter van Twiller, or the Doubter, took the seals of office and all the other seals he could lay hands on. Minuit could not, however, remain quiet. Office, as usual, had produced a rest- lessness which office medicine only could cure. He went to Europe, and brought out a company of Swedes, and- settled with them at Christiana, near 'Wilming- ton, naming the place after the girlish Queen of Sweden. The prolific Swedes spread northwards, and gratefully named their territory New Sweden,--a territory stretching, defiant of New Netherlands, and planting its northern line as near as Trenton. The Doubter was too undecided to face their decided ad- vances; and was replaced, in 1638, by William Kieft, the third overseer of the Dutch plantations. One of Kieft's first acts was to protest against the Minuit, or Swedish jig, which Peter was dancing with his lively company on the Delaware. The protest was, like so many. others since issued from New York,   THE SETTLEMENT OF NEW  YORK.    1iY only made a note of, but left unheeded. Sharper pro- tests, backed by bayonets and knapsacks provisioned with good long sausages, were, two years later, made against the Indians of Long Island, who, egged on by the Swedes of the south, and the sleek Pilgrims on the Connecticut, kindled their fires on Staten Island, and threatened to eat their omelets in' New Amster- dam itself. For five long years were those Indian eggs and the colony over the fire. At last the Iro- quois called away the coppery cooks, and the boiling waters simmered down again. The colony enlarged itself. Broom-corn waved along the Mohawk River; Dutch pigs were made into head-cheese in Schenec- tady; and Dutch cabbages, sweltered in large hogs- heads, came out sour-kraut for purple-colored families all up the valley, still so plentifully sprinkled with Dutch hamlets, baptized with genuine Holland names. The warm hearts of the colonists blunted Indian hos- tilities, as their thick heads, almostJimnpenetrable to anything but three meals a day, defied their .toma- hawks. In 1647 Kieft was recalled, and Peter Stuyvesant reigned in his stead. His combustible temper was kept constantly crackling, like a bunch of fire-crackers, during the sixteen years he headed the Dutch settle- ments in America. His wooden leg, like Sa-nta Anna's in our own day, seemed ever stirring up the fires to renewed blazes. On all sides he was scorched. The wood, long seasoning, piled up by the colonists in Con- necticut, and in the territory since divided up into Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, was kin- dled into a hot flame. Permission to the former, in   "O THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. 1650, to extend their settlements up to Oyster Bay on Long Island, and to Greenwich on the main-land, only, whet their appetites for other kinds of oysters and new beds. . Five years later, and the fiery Stuy- vesant led a regiment of six hundred men: against Christiana, and, reducing it to silence, brought his victorious troops back again; the colony now having a liberal supply of candidates for all its offices for that generation. Whether the burgomaster of New Am- sterdam and the five scheppens took occasion of the return of these troops to vote themselves suppers, medals, and free rides around the island, is very doubtful, as contemporary accounts are mute on the subject. At last even Dutch patience became weary of wars with the Indians and disputes with all the neighbor- ing colonies. The growing political privileges, won by the vigilant perseverance of those colonies, - the right of representation in assemblies, - the larger immuni- ties from home taxation, attracted their attention, so that in 1664, when Charles II. granted, however unjustly, to his brother, the  Duke of York, the whole country, from  the Connecticut River to the Delaware,- including, of, course, the Dutch settle- ments,- and Nichols, the duke's lieutenant, in Sep- tember of that year, anchoring before New  Amster- dam, asked the peppery Stuyvesant to hand over, the wishes of the inhabitants for change was so great, that the governor, although disposed to resist, found no backers; and so, after stumping around for several hours among his councillors, was obliged, to cut his stick into a pen, and sign a document, transferring   THE SETTLEMENT OF NEW YORK.      141 the American Empire of their High Mightinesses, the States General, to the royal English Duke.

The iron feet' of the statue were, however, firmly planted on the soil of- New York, although the upper parts of the figure have been cast in other metals, and moulded  by Saxon, Celtic, Teutonic, and Gallic hands. The last Dutch governor, let us add, gracefully sub- mitted to the English sway, living in his ample house in the Bowery until his death, happy in his farm, which then grew chestnuts instead of men, and was tracked by cows and calves, sheep and lambs, instead of the iron tracks which now spike New York to its rocky bed, whose sheets are balance sheets, and whose  covering is the dirty blankets which its unconscien- tious Mrs. Gamps throw over her. i   "2 CHAPTER VI.

In 1681 he obtained from Charles II. a grant of all the lands embraced in the present limits of Penn- sylvania; and in the following autumn he came out -to prospect his large unfenced farm. Sailing up the Delaware, over fins whose ancestors had preceded him by centuries, and between banks colonized sparsely by Finns and Swedes thirty-nine years before, he landed at New Castle. His open, sunny face, then browned with thirty- eight summers, warmed even the Indians toward him, in the frosty month of November; and thus trickled their confidence and trust: You are our brothers. We will leave a broad path for you and us to walk in. If an Englishman falls asleep in the path, the Indian: shall pass him by and say:' He is an Englishman; he is asleep; let him. alone.'

He found clumps of pine, chestnut, and walnut trees,'-names which grew to the streets which displaced them. Dis- liking crowded towns, which he had found to be but nurseries of vice, he desired his city to be planted with gardens round each house, so as to form "a greene countrie towne." The jealous rivals of the Quaker Emporium assert that he succeeded in carrying out his plan. He was not pen-urious; but paid the, natives for their lands. Peace, Penn, and plenty prevailed through all the borders of the baby settlement. In two years, twenty-five hundred wood-colored bonnets and broad-brims could be counted of a Sunday in the loving city. Unlike most of the other young settle- ments, the neck of land between the two rivers on which Penn's pet stood was not wrung by famine or by the'hand of political oppression. In March, 1683, Penn granted to the assembly, held in the grow- ing town, an ample charter of liberty. The next year he made a trip to Europe, taking the "Philadelphia line," which, fortunately for him, did not break before he reached shore. --               ^ In 1691 the three counties, now forming the, State of Delaware, and of which Penn had procured a con- veyance, took it in- their heads to try their own luck at housekeeping, and set up a separate kitchen of their own.

Y   the middle of the    seventeenth  century, the young   colonial damsels from   England,Holland, Sweden, and   Germany   had, in the main, obtained comfortable and satisfactory settlements along the At- lantic slopes. Thejealous "old folks at- home " kept a strict watch on their doings, and sent servants to look after their ways. Here and there some stolen - +       ,              l   THE COLONIES.        151 interviews with that very disreputable acquaintance, Legislative Liberty, had been detected; and the ser- vants were especially charged to keep both eyes upon any renewal of such improprieties. Frequent inven- tories of property were insisted on. All the house- hold stuff was required to be bought, at the home shops; and, what hurt the feelings and interests of the young people more than anything else, they were for- bidden even to send back what they did not want to use themselves, unless in ships built and despatched from England for them. There were some articles, as print- int-presses, jury-boxes, etc., which were deemed by the anxious parents as particularly unnecessary and even improper. Two whims there were, which the young- sters had of late got into their heads, that they were repeatedly enjoined to banish, once for all: namely,/the notion of electing somebody to :go and meet somebody else and have a talk over that foolish and altogether unsatisfactory subject the taxes; and that other equally absurd fancy of counting over occasionally the loose change collected for public purposes. They told them that such things were above their years, and that, in fact, they knew nothing about them; and moreover, that such whimsies had made a great deal of trouble even among the wiser heads on the old island, and, if indulged- in, would be sure to bring their progeny into bad habits and to worse ends. These injunctions and warnings of course only increased curiosity, led to talks across the dinner-table and in the evenings after the day's work was over. The more they talked it over, the more, of course, they set their hearts upon having the forbidden fruit. It was found"that Vir- : . % , : / .? 2P-,-. S "4 ; .,- r ^    ;   I.                 *  ginia had enjoyed the dangerous luxuries of sending two men from every one of her eleven boroughs to do both these improper things, ever since she was twelve years old. She, too, had been permitted to have a jury-box, and liked the music of it right well, although some of the twelve strings sometimes got out of order, and the instrument occasionally played too long when badly wound up. Favoritism  in a family is never pleasant for the unfavored ones. The others could not see why they should not have what Virginia was allowed. The subject became at last a sore one, and several times ended in angry flushes and - muttered adjectives that went off without any nouns to touch them; some into the air, and some- we are forced to say -right into the faces of the old people. Cromwell, that brusk English step-father, who, after the sudden taking off of his predecessor, Charles I., vigorously seized the cold hand of Albion, had his favorites among the step-children, the New-England- ers. Yet he did not hesitate to trounce -them as soundly as he did- Virginia and the two Carolinas, whenever they set up their wills against his. It-was he who, in 1651, tied up all the colonies by those leading-strings, the Navigation Acts. When Charles II. came into the family, these colonial cords. were not cut, but multiplied and tied into knots, not at all sailor fashion. In fact, whoever ruled the house, Commonwealth, Stuart, or Orange, strengthened and doubled these vexatious marine strings, until finally father and children were threatened with the fate of Laocoon.

In fact, the entire maritime policy of England towards the colonies was very dry nursing on very wet principles. At one time, Virginia was the pet, and got several sugar-plums from royal bounty.  Then Connecticut came in for some caressing. Thle younger Winthrop presented to Charles II., in 1662, a petition for a new toy, -a charter. He would have been refused, but that he slipped in, at the same time, a ring given to his own grandfather by the father of Charles, which so pleased the dress-loving king, that he gave to- Con- necticut one of the best charter hobby-horses -ever seen at that time in America.  This, it may be re- marked, is the earliest example in our history of what "a ring" can effect: We cannot record in detail the successive struggles of the Colonies to free themselves from  political and commercial restrictive rules, --for rights of repre- sentation in assemblies of their own, for the privi- lege of taxing themselves, and spending their own assessments, and for the many solid and large free- doms which we now enjoy without question or fear. The story of the way in which the cellar was dug, through obstructions of root and stone, the walls sunk, the beams of the lower floor, hewn out amid dis- couragements and opposition, laid and primed, ought not to be otherwise than pleasant, even when re- hearsed to those who have long and securely revelled -  - * A   n   THE  COLONIES.        155 in all the comforts and luxuries of the completed building; in its hot and cold water baths of free dis- cussion; the numerous call-pipes through the wall, for public servants; the cedar closets for the best clothes of liberty; the iron safe for the family silver or green- backs; the gas-pipes of illuminating knowledge; and '   the varied upholstery to soothe labor-aching limbs), or to gratify luxurious and even extravagant tastes. But space, like nobility, obliges; and although, like those experts who write the Lord's Prayer on a sixpence, we can condense Genesis on the smallest historic disk, we cannot crowd all, creation  on the rim  of the same piece.  Speaking in a general way, however, we may affirm that for forty years preceding- the accession of James II. in 1685, the Colonies, on the whole, steadily gained  from jealous political privilege and chartered monopoly some of the rights enjoyed at home.     As these rights fell, one  after another, upon colonial soil, they  were carefully secured  by strong hands! Sometimes they were jarred suddenly from the parent tree by  the iron hand'of war. Sometimes they fell [ carelessly, like  great, golden pippins, over the royal enclosure into  the  king's highway, ripe and  well flavored. Sometimes they   matured- naturally under the very eyes of those keepers of the royal Transatlan- tic preserves, -  the colonial governors, -- and- when mellow, were seized and hurried out of reach until it. was safe to give them  to the hungrv people. Thus, in various ways, by  different hands and from different parts of the  colonial:-orcicard, the precious fruit was gathered for present or future use. In some of the plantations the proprietors, those   156 THE COMC HSTORY OF' THE UNITED STATES. * Gentlemen of England, who sat at home in ease,", expecting their stone ships to come il, filled with promised colonial stuff for presents to their children, became tired of waiting, and sold out their large airy bills of lading for very small earthly crowns sterling. In other Colonies the heirs of the original grantees, after spending all their ready means in lawsuits with the hard-worling settlers, videlicet, "squatters," guilty in complainants' eyes, not only of "disturbing the peace of our lord the King," but of attempting to appropriate unlawfully a piece of his 'colonial king- dom, compromised, as other parties have before done, for sums barely,sufficient to cover the costs of litiga- tion. In a few .instances, suitors to the affections of the coy colonial heiresses, tlinking by courtly ways to acquire their landed possessions and the common-law right to govern their persons, were dismissed with good-natured assurances that they should continue to look upon them  as friends, but declined any more intimate relationships. In a few other cases still- like those of William  Penn, Roger Williams, and Cecil Calvert - the tenants were freely and generously left to manage their civil and political affairs, without suit, let, or hindrance, while individual conscience was erected into a high court of equity, with supreme jurisdiction in things spiritual. Representative government took at first different forms. In some of the settlements legislative grists were put into a mortar and pounded out into a simple, healthy, easily digested, coarse meal. Maryland and Massachusetts set up more luxurious mills, provided with double runs of stoine,- an upper and lower one,   THE, COLONIES.       157 which was supposed to grind out a finer kind of legis- lative flour. The brand, we need scarcely add, is now the popular American one, and is being, in limited amounts, exported for foreign use. In some of these establishments "bolts" were now and then introduced, by some bran-new  representative miller, and expectations were immediately held out to the anxious customers of better flour, and of a whiter color,-expectations, we regret to add, that rarely came to anything except increased fatness to the miller's live stock, always grunting and grubbinm around the mill doors. Woman's  rights, too, thus early took root, sprouting  out like young shoots from the old rotting stumps of a decaying civilization. Anne Hutchinson,--not Dickinson, -grieved in soul by the exclusion of her sex from the right to discuss and criticise, at the weekly meeting of the congregation, the last Sunday's dis- course,- a right now practised all over the world,- created by her fiery eloquence such a blaze in Massa- chusetts, that she soon made the Colony too hot for her. Sir Harry Vane, strange to say, did not turn the way that the wind blew; but, although a governor and a baronet, veered against the current of hot air. Let reformers pluck from these pages a fragrant leaf pressed and preserved for' their reading when faint. It was from  this little seed-capsule, enwrapping a precious life, warmed by the heat of a woman's mind, there sprang up in a few years that beautiful floawer of spiritual liberty that now sends itsippling odor from sea to sea. Thus in all high places of political power there was   :)j ',"! 158   THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.   THE COLONIES.      : 159 a general thaw of royal prerogative and proprietarial claim; and popular rights trickled down upon the plain below.

E putr il se muove." Yes, the world did move! Even that hard part of it, crusted over with stern though earnest religious dog- mas, began to stir. The austerity of Puritan faith, conscientious yet severe, which had worn the russet grimness which its own persecution in England had gathered around it--as hard woods, lying in damp, imprisoning places, become clothed with  fungus growths -began to feel some of the sunny effects, of the Hutchinson illumination.   In Virginia time and free discussion were wearing away the granite barriers within which its, legislation and loyalty had always sought to hem into a. single channel, the Epis- copal, the diverging streams of religious convictions. The lnarrow bigotries of the times, showing them- selves under different aspects, sprang naturally out of . the various soils in which the seeds had taken root. The early colonists of New England, escaping like the Jews from Egyptian bondage, and lit by flaming torches and cloudy providences to their promised land, compelled every one, Canaanite and Quaker, independent Philistine and non-conforming Episco- palian, to bring offerings to their cherished altar, under pain of banishment to the wilderness beyond. Those   160 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. of Virginia, on the contrary, bringing with them their own lares and .penates from their father's house, and fearing the introduction of strange deities, fenced in the sacred images with sharp picket-palings set by legal enactment. Over both, however, the new Evangel of toleration began to break, and voices of those!' crying in the wilderness," divinely sent, cleaving with -gentle strokes the consciences of thoughtful men, and heard around the altar and inside the guarded pickets, heralded the coming Emanuel. We have said that, up to the time of the accession of James II. in 1685, the fruits of civil liberty were gradually maturing in the growing settlements. Immediately after that event, however, a chillin(- black, frost fell upon them, rolling up the green leaves of the charters and threatening to kill outright all the chance-sown trees, as well as the more promising cul- tivated grafts. During the three and a half years that this blight continued, the greater part of the popular governments were stunted or destroyed. The, Con- necticut rocking-horse;, conjured from King Charles II. by Winthrop's ring, was hid away in a hollow oak at Hartford. Sir Edmund Andros, a man of narrow spirit and keen temper, was sent out with instructions so large that he swallowed up the governments of all the New England Colonies and New York; A severe fit of indigestion followed, acidulating and fermentinp, taking away the general appetite, and causing painful memories of the time when there were no heart-burn- ings and dangerous blood-rushings headward. And so, when in 1688 the Revolution brought in the Orange Prince, health bloomed again on the colonial cheek,   TIE COLONIES.       161 and the constitution seemed to acquire a more vigor- ous tone than ever. The colonists had early learned the strength which comes from   union. From  1643 --onwards for forty years the New   England  settlements joined hands with each other against the French of New France and Acadia, the French Indian allies, and the Dutch of New York; and while, like man and wife, they had their own healthy troubles, curtain lectures, poutings and  make-ups, they stoutly defended the common home against all neighboring invasion.  Persons once married are not apt to forget it, nor cease to sigh, after the tie is dissolved, for the benefits which accrued from it. The colonial widowers found it easier after- swards to contract a new union   than the bachelor communities to form their first match.  Eight years after the death of the first union the bereaved New- Englanders went out on a    second courtship,-the trysting-place being  New York,-and  there agreed upon a  sort of runaway match to Canada. The honey- moon journey was not as pleasant as bridal trips through the Thousand Isles to Montreal and Quebec now are. In fact, although bound for Quebec, and even reaching it,* they were not suffered by the French to enter it. They returned not over well pleased with each other, but paiticularly out of temper with the armed discourtesy of the French. This little trip away from home  was not the first' nor the last wich the Colonies were led to make. In fact, our people from the very beginning seem to have been curiously addicted -to foreign missionary efforts. They acquired the passion at the outset from European -- - -   K  -    2 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. suggestions. Whenever the state skeins there got into a tangle, some of the outside threads were sure to run into a dreadful kink here. No sooner was there a scrubbing and house-cleaning among the old folks on the Thames, Seine, Scheldt, or Rhine, than the brooms'were got out on the Hudson, the James, and Connecticut, arid up they all went at that stand- ing bother of our colonial housewives, the nest of lively French flies in our northeast corner, or at those old yellow-legged Dutch hornets that had settled down on Manhattan 'and Long Island. The war between the English and Dutch Commonwealths in 1652, which sent Van Tromp's broom over the seas, brushing down the red spots of St. George, set the colonial sweepers at- work. The big and little brooms were, however, put aside after two years; but in 1663 they were all seized again, and by a single dash New York was swept into the English pan. Amid all this dust and refuse matter of war one can pick out now and then some stray grains of shin- ing value. Such was Mary's and William's College, established' in Virginia in 1693, making the second bright college speck in America. Such were the gold and  silver ores of thought found by George Fox, Increase Mather, and others, mixed with brown earth or imbedded in quartz, but valuable in any collection. Such, too, the loving messages sent from Friends in England to their brethren here, which we can now pick from that colonial dust-heap where they shine like plates of mica.    '  The Orange William could not of course long bloom in peace in his new royal bed. His father-in-law,    THE COLONIES.        163    4':i-',l James II., had fled across the channel to Louis XIV., and was selfishy entertained by him at Paris. Wil- liam objected--as some people 'do nowadays--to his relative's prolonged stay in that fascinating capital. This little unpleasantness resulted in a war which lasted until 1697. Of course the Colonies were highly, offended too; and as soon as the two rather elderly gentlemen at Versailles and St. James had taken snuff, there was a general sneeze from Passamaquod-dy Bay to the Altamaha River. Getting thus very red in the face, the colonists flung out their hands, which of course hit Canada right -in the face. The French resented the slap, and pommelled away at New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, scratching off many scalps at -Dover, Schenectady, and along the Penobscot. A regular settle-r was aimed back by the Colonies at the very nob of the French settlements, Quebec.  An arm-ament, directed by Sir William Phipps, was flung out towards the St. Lawrence, but a skilful fence by the alert French warded off the blow. To heat the pokers in these fires, kindled in Europe, blown over to this side and fed here by wood fur- nished by the colonists, and often hauled from a great distance, was laborious and expensive. But this was a small care for England who coolly took out the irons when well aglow. Little, however, did she t!en  imagine that the young arms thus smiting the irons on these French and Indian anvils were making and hardening muscle that would one day resist her own heavy and long- reaching blows.

The colonial seeds carelessly or selfishy cast by royal hands into furrows, seeming like very rugged and ugly blotches on the wide wintry-looking fields of North America, quick- ened in less than a hundred years by the rain-patters, were to wave in ridges as green and blossoming, as English hedges in June. None of our illuminated readers will fall down into that exalted, but still very common mistake, of sup- posing that the great imass of the men, women, and children, living here in the latter half of that seven- teenth century, were-all the while, or indeed to any great extent, occupied by, interested in, or even meas- urably affected by, these large public events. The old man who thought it strange that all the millions of people in the Roman Empire, who he naturally sup- posed, from his reading of history, were present at the killing o]f Caesar, did not rise against Brutus, Cassius, and the rest and prevent it, is now dead, but he has left successors to his historical notions. Most people are just as apt to tlink that everybody at Jerusalem knew King David as certainly as the' Skibbareen Irishman that every American whom he meets in Ireland must be, acquainted with his cousin whose going off from Skibbareen was so well understood there. Louis Napoleon, in his Life of Caesar, may magnify the importance and influence over his times of his self-reflecting. hero; but we all know that, in fact, as soon as the large imperial microscope is taken off from the single spot, Caesar goes back again into a speck on the broad Roman sheet. To the ninety-   THE COLONIES.        165. nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine Romans in one hundred thousand, it was practically of less consequence whether Caesar, Antony, or, Julius Scipio  Smith ruled Rome, than whether the season was wet or dry, or whether their wives and children kept well and healthy.   To the few around the court, to the mammas with eligible daughters just in the city of Rome, to a few vestimentary Jenkins who retailed to, the dozen families of their set the latest scandals on the Palatine, it was a matter of some moment; to the farmers, mechanics, working-people paving the wide empire with their labor and patient, endless industries, of comparatively little consequence whatever. Doubt- less great numbers of these hard-working Romans, in     I those unfortunate towns where there were no presses or telegraphs, lived forty, fifty, or sixty years after   i "great Caesar had turned to clay," without suspecting    - that he was not decorated china still at Rome-; with- out dreaming that, while they themselves had been      o raising pulse and sour wine for their own little house     sovereigns in Gaul or Germania, Augustus had suc-  ceeded to Ceesar's power at the capitol, and had set those scribblers, Virgil, Livy, and Horace, to writing, and had made much history for Bohemians since. Little did they know that Tiberius had meanwhile       ; succeeded Augustus and crucified more men at that       1 Roman New York than he had hairs on his hard  pate, and so kept on the imperial pastime with a keen appetite, until he was served with the same sauce that    li he had dished out so freely; nor had they ever heard     1 tell that during the same interval, so uneventful for     i them in their far-off silent occupations, Caligula had    i                    i!   166 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. crawled-up to the place vacated by Tiberius, and from its slimy top had pitched victims to wild beasts and voracious fish, and amused the bloody pauses in his grim, mad humors by feeding his favorite horse with gilded oats, and would have made him consul had not the least inhuman brute died before his quadripedcal instalment into the office which Cicero sought so- long and praised so loudly. The great events, especially if at a distance, fill large spaces in our histories; but, like a marriage or death in the: family, they occupy but a comparatively brief part of the life of any of its members. There is a great deal of water, even in rivers that are famous for large fish, that holds no fish at all,--waters whose onflow gladdens and refreshes large districts.  A nation or a community must at some time have marked events to stir its blood and create- noble memories; but it cannot live on 'Fourth of July or the remembrance of Waterloo.    The life of the greater part of the colonists passed, as that of most people in all times and countries is spent, in quiet, steady work -during the day, eating three meals if they had them, and two if they had not, and in sleeping as well nights as the hot or cold weather, wives or children, or other disturbers of the peace, would permit. AWe read of some red-letter event, like Kidd's piracies in 1696-1698, that tossed from the deck possibly twenty people; and' fancy that this Semmes  must have borne an important part in those closing  years of the cenltury, without reflecting that almost every week in the year records more victims on our rivers and -railroads, -victims despatched by us be-   THE COLONIES.        16 tween the mouthfuls of our toast at breakfast. Such events bear the same relation to the volume of life as the capital letters, which head the chapters of a book, to its solid contents. They are the daubs of paint on the card of gingerbread; the small pinholes pricked in the large family loaf. . We eat oie thousand and ninety-four meals in the year without any recollec- tion of them; we remember only the one Thanks- giving dinner which did us no more good than the others, and which probably, like Kidd's piracies, stuck in our crops very distressingly. :No doubt many of the colonists never heard of Robert Kidd; and others, who had listened to Mary Jane singing the    song which told "how   he sailed," fancied, that, like Blue- beard, he was- only invented for songs and red-covered primers. In fine, these notable events are, in general, but the froth-bubbles on   the river's surface.  The solid on-pressing mass does not feel the puffy little globes, iridescent though they be, and swells though they may appear to the few. fish just around them. There was only one Kidd on the wide seas. Of the many other craft, carefully managed, sailing slowly and wearily, earning  patient wages, and making port at the same time, we hear nothing. So the race drifts, scuds, tacks, works, or runs to- wards the great harbor. So was it in the seventeenth century. Old people, as now, took to tea, dozy arm- chairs, tedious gossip, and  mumbling recollections of the golden days of youth,--golden even if actually passed amid steel points, arrow-heads, or among the rude ploughshares of ever-recurring, never-ending toil. Grief and gladness pendulated with  regular swings    168 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. and carried the hour-hands of family life evenly and surely on through the uneventful spaces, until at last the solemn bell struck. Then a new mound was sodded under the willow-trees in the rude chlurchyard, whose slate-stones notched the advance of the Colonies. Among the young people love crept in, too, under shaggy vests and calico bodices. Soft words passed into earnest vows, and clergymen or country squires welded the glowing pieces into instruments of un- complaining labor and life-long use. Then came new: voices into the house, and,--well, at the wiinding-up of the century there were two hundred and thrty- five thousand people in the settlements. There would have been more, but- Chicago had not yet started. And now, tying our coltish Colonies to the bars of the eighteenth century, we leave them for a short ' time while we run- down a few stray subjects, skit- tishy grazing in the back pastures. We shall soon return to drive them all into the ranker grass of the opening plantations.    CHAPTER IX.                    i  WITCHCRAFT.

JUST as the last sands were dropping at once out of  the hour-glasses of the seventeenth century and of- a few old women at Salem, a strange trouble bubbled           i l up in  that little  teapot of a place, which not only raised its lid at the time, but has kept a great many           I wide-open eyes fixed on it ever since, to see how it           ill happened, and whether it would not, perhaps, do it            1 again. Do it again! of course not; and       very sorry that it ever did it at all.  Let us distill from  it first-  proof historical stimulation, while we wait for the colts  to cool off.                               % Young  women had    often at Salem, as elsewhere,           170 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. troubled men, and for the misdemeanor had been con- demned to the stocks--of marriage. But what to do with the ill-favored, old ladies who, in 1692, were accused of breakinig the rest of both -old and young, -of disturbing two organs, the spleen and gall, lying near that excitable old offender, the heart, and of stopping judicial digestion, - puzzled the brain of the wisest, yea, even the solid, well-set cerebrum of Cot- ton Mather. Much pondering was there, much ex- orcising, much studying of the twenty-eighth chapter of 1 Samuel, and diligent' rummaging of chronicles, Jewish, Egyptian, French, and English, to find de- scriptions of the vice, and the punishments therefor. The sin of being old is, in a new country where young activities are alone valuable, always great. At quaint, gable-ended Salem it became a swinging crime. How the knot was eventually not cut, but tied, all the world knows.  Everybody remembers how those aged agitators were taken around the neck, not. by future spouses, as the young Salemites were, but by cords most unsilken. The delusion of course soon -vanished with the twenty victims; but the Scarlet Letter, Written at the time, which tells the affecting story, is still handed around unsealed, and will ever be read with witching interest. 'T is the old tale, with new characters and scenery to adapt it to the time and place. The Bible opens with it.

But the public and published examples of witch- craft are few compared with countless cases always going on in every community, urban or rural, unrecog- nized by any tribunals judicialor historic. At every apple-paring in New England, - in the husking-parties throughout the West, where the finding of the red ear of corn suddenly makes every kissful girl the personal owner of two redder ears, - in the quilting frolics at the South, where the young gentlemen of the place come in, after the sewing is done, and sow roses on cheeks white before,- by story-telling brooks-that keep sacred the secrets of lovers, while babbling their own, - -along the roadside, in quiet nooks, in village parlors, in crowded cities where mammon tries in vain to cheat the sweet witches out of their devotees,-- everywhere, in fine, where hearts are not utterly trade-mailed, office-clad, or ossified, the tender deli- rium which early entered our great, glorious mad- house of a world, produces effects which are never understood by some, which confound the wise un- wisdom of old judicial heads, and sometimes get in- wrought into fine tragedies, before which even those of New England, although told by a good fellow or transfigured by a Longfellow, pale away faded and colorless.  - :' The man who is incapable of being bewitched by   WITCHCRAFT.        1 somebody or something, may make a good bargain, a and live on unlo  nly a lon tie,-like  an  plant, never touching his mother earth, or feeling its A, a lnspirifing magics; but he will never get much out k of life except meat, drink, and c  -sheetetees  nor add much to the happiness orgreatness of his  i- iu kind. lie who lives in the United States beyond a.  fair age, without getting e xt rcably tangled in th Zi witchingl meshes of some g ood mate, shou d be tried % i, y a Juy  of gushing girls, and condemned for ife to ,  the pillow-ry with some of the m   odern witches of  ew Englan or the sorceresses of the South. ^' , Whosoever, then, accuses the witchcrafts of ot her .. t  imes and ages, let him, ere he casts the first stone, , .t ,i look into his own heart., or a round among hiso .. household or community, and, borrowing a  charity .  . from his thoughts, say, f he can, "Go in - pieces."   1SOYOFE UNITED STATES.

Some near- sighted people find a difficulty, as they look about upon their contemporaries, in arriving at results which they can crystallize around class nodules. They see only individual specimens, and wonder how the photo- graphic historian can bring out by his machine pictu- -resque groups, clothed in appropriate costume, artisti- cally arranged. But this difficulty arises from the unhappy fact that the objects observed lie directly under their eye. The others lie without. Besides such obtuse-eyed watchers of their own times, who experience an embarrassment in getting fitting words to express their ideas of an average man, age, habits, or morals,--a process much like that of producing our current Sherry wines by boiling down and simmering off a variety of ingredients,- lose sight of the precipi- tating, coagulating, forming mass, in their anxiety to note the frisky bubbles that come up to the agitated surface. Besides, long-sighted chroniclers can see and   HE;  MAJNNERNS, M'Tt., GUs O1',i UULUJNIS. J 1 UJ i describe the habits and manners of the distant past with more clearness, and certainly with more telling effect, than the troublesome present, with its distress- ing individualities and exceptions, lying, amid the disturbing cross-lights of actual, hard, well-known facts. If, in bringing up the ghost of a period long buried, we get the wrong dress on it, or chance to summon back a spectre, invested with habits that fitted another epoch as well or better, we are not teased or contradicted by any foolish survivor, pushed by children-like questions, or worried into redness of face by puzzling inquiries or an awkward silence. And so reasoning, we feel sure that, if our inspec- tion of the accoutrements, manoeuvres, and drill of the companies that march before us in the seventeenth century, is not absolutely accurate, the fault will not lie in the distance, nor in the atmosphere, nor yet in the instrument, but in one of these two causes, either that they have sent up the wrong squads or else that the originals had not, after all, much manners to be inspected. It is generally believed that Lord Chesterfield in- vented manners: but as he was not born until 1694, just as the seventeenth century was getting stagger- ingly infirm and indifferent to its externals, and as he did not .procure the publication of his Letters until the characters on the blue slate-stones over the bones of the deceased age had become blurred and weather- dimmed, the question of- the comparison of their manners with his patent methods and rules did not, we may well believe, much vex those earnest old toil- ers of the sea and on the land.  180 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.   .

As it took vessels at that period several months to come fromn France, the settleis were somewhat late in their knowledge of the foreign modes; but as the -tyles were the latest known,'it wasall the same in New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and  Boston. That rotatory machine whichl now turns out fashions semiannually, now clipping a yard or so from the top of a dress and adding it to the bottom, here expanding a bonnet to th6 size of a parasol, then contracting it to dimensions less than the iiners bill for it; a one time running a flat iron down in front, and at another tackingo a donkey's load on behind, had not yet been invented. Paterfamilias recognized his own children, day after day, and even year after year, in the same modes and garments; the serviceable gray or serge, during week-days, and the decent, plain, unarresting, and unstunnin g habiliments, reverently donned for Sunday. Thle girls were not fast,' although the colors of their calicoes were. Their bright carna- tions they wore all the time, only a little more so on Sunday evenings wlen the sparks lit themup, espe- cially if a match was near.

In these re- spects the times whereof we speak kept company, to some extent, with their predecessors. But among the sparse settlements, the appropriators and spoilers of others' property and rights had such a hard time to do a thriving business, and found that honest work laid up so much more at the year's end, that after a little while they learned to prefer the ways of the virtuous,. not from     principle, but from  interest, and left off courses that led to the poor-house, if they missed the jail. There were here and there dandies who imported their manners with their clothes; but as the girls then had the good sense to believe that these, so far from being superior to those of domestic growth, did not wear so long or well, and had a way of changing so often as to be worth less than the duty imposed to bring them in, such foreign importations gradually fell off. Young ladies at home then sewed the tares, in- stead of the wicked old Sower. The "help" was only looked for, and always found in, the house; which was kept up for the sake of the family, and not for the servants. People worked all the hours in which they did not sleep, and thus kept their minds from being agitated by the operation of I" eight-hour laws," the tortures of party squeezes, and the bore of con- certs and lectures. Children were put to bed before midnight, were satisfied with their simple toys, and remained children nature's full term. Parents ruled, and not the baby, which crowed as much as it pleased, except over its begetters. It must be said, however, that elderly people even ,    then bewailed the decay of the times, and often,. over their pipes or knitting, conjured up visions of more virtuous days, when they were young amid the green- fields of old England, the emerald meadows of Hol-- land, or on the hardy plains of Sweden. Secondly, MORALS.- Ethics have no isothermal lines, fencing in the moral qualities, as nature gir- dles the earth 'with wavy zones for fruits, arctic, temperate, and tropical. And yet certain vices and virtues prevail, as trade-winds, more at one period, or over one tract at a given time than at or over another. It would almost seem as if certain moral or immoral ovarian eggs had been early and secretly laid in some wide districts, or among certain nations, where they were afterwards washed over by the im- pregnating milt of peculiar influences, and then broke into ready and abundant life. There were jails in all the Colonies, and very early The variety of the jail-bird never wanted specimens. The crimes against the person were more frequent at first than those against property, for the obvious reason that- there were more of the former than the latter; as property multiplied, however, it was, as usual, viciously coveted.  The vices of an   early age are m ore vigorous but-, rarer.

They have nothing to feed on in a simple state of society. They drift in upon an older one like barnacles and foul creepers on the copper fastenings. of noble, well-freighted ships. Like blood in super-refined sugar, subtle vices look so white in the mixture that we almost fail to see, their crimsoning hues. We speak of the crimes and mis- demeanors of the Colonial times as indications of the prevailing morality, jusf-as flies in open pans of cream tell its quality and richness. Morality, we have said, is not bounded by isother- mal lines; and yet climate and soil do seriously affect  the -prevailing moral tones and hues, just as earthly lakes take on the passing colors of the heavens above. The Puritan sternness of New England convictions as iron-like as the firs and larches on her own hills - swept in as gray gustiness across her early history as her northeasters over her wide fields. The latter pinched her children physically till they became of the same blue tint as. their church regulations.  The rigidity of even Huguenot faith could not stand the continual sun of South Carolina, which, at length, so f    TE MANNtES, ETC., OF THE COLONISTS.  185 relaxed its sharp lines that they ceased to cut at all across that compressed globe of iniquity, human slav- ery. The moral qualities of Virginia were like its own soil, at first stiff and deep, but gradually deteriorating until they got down into such a narcotic; stony poverty t hat the ploull of vigorous truth seldom turned up. Forms of church worship., rites, and ceremonies usu- ally flouish b   in      and ceremonies usu- ally flourish best in warm latitudes, where the pas- sive swing on ecclesiastical ropes, suspended bettween time-crusted pillars, requires less exertion than climb- ing he tree, Zaccheus-like for one's self. The vines wic, all along. down the well-sunned slopes, from the Chesapeake Bay southwards, lean  lovingl y upon the magnolia and cottonwood, shaping themselves tihten into' verdant gothc arche s, grasped with no tig ter fingers the supports which safely Steadied their trusting confidence, than did their sunny-hearted cul- tivators curl securely the tendrils of their religious faith around the Episcopal oaks, whose acorns, dropped fromn rook-nested boughs in E nland, and gatheropped and planted  he                  a ere, soon spran g up and spread their cool shades for an easy , luxu rious faith.

From   Bohemia came the scholars of Huss; from Piedmont, the hunted Wal- denses; from France, the men who turned their faces to centripetal Rome, as their Mecca,--their religious creeds mixing and mingling in the wide-armed Bay of New York, which ever welcomed all religions that built houses on its shores or belted its waist with com- mercial girdles. The Baptists were early washed over to our coasts, and finding ample rivers for their aquatic rite, spread with every new wave of emigration. Con- gregational and Independent churches grew like young bullocks in almost every New England valley, - even putting their stiff necks through the Connecticut  natural Ox-Bow at Hadley, - the only yoke they ever would submit to. We speak of churches and sects as propagators of morality, and as the yardsticks which measured the colonial morals; for as yet wicked men had not learned to use the church as covers, whence to spread nets for simpletons that lighted, like pigeons, on or near the adjacent grounds. In general, it may be said, that in spite of Puritan rites in New England show- ing the forbidding and cold side of the warm-hearted Gospel, in spite of the hedged Episcopal orchards of Virginia, where the blossoming odors were sought to be kept wholly inside the very high walls, in spite of -the: fermenting influences in New York, and the- tin       in   f     THE MANNERS, ETC., OF THE COLONISTS.  187 discouragements from various local causes in the other Colonies, Rhode Island and Maryland excepted, the colonists were healthily moral. The schoolmaster got early abroad; and, gener- ally boardng around in the school district, and making inimself miscellaneously useful, wedged some educat- ilg notions into the heads of all, -in the younger by day, and in the older during the evenings. And thus the church, the school-house,. industry, which pushed back idleness and its brood of vices, simple agicul, tural ways, the absence of city sores, and the rugged conscientious pursuit of wholesome livelihoods in largely i rentilated spaces, all conurred to hand u p the simple; g ,enerallyr made of conscientious, native mate- rials, coarse but strong; and wcere exceedindly well preserved.

To accomplish this, the proprietors sought to have the colonists devote as much of their time as possible to work. They endeavored to relieve them from the necessity of wasting precious moments in disposing of their products or in supplying them- selves with materials, or in gossiping in' assemblies about foolish rights, or in squandering their days in electing officers, or gadding about the townships in electioneering for themselves or others. Did the Colonies want materials, wheat to sow the first year, crockery, furniture, store goods? The companies could .so easily send over a ship with them. Did the prosperous colonist wish to dispose of his surplus crop? The companies would take it for him, and sell it in England. Was a governor, a judge, an office-holder of any kind, such as collector, portwaraden, etc., needed? Why, the companies kept them  already made at their manufactory in London, and would express one through by their fast-sailing line in ample time, even if it took three months, and would deliver them wherever desired, at Plymouth, Hartford, Charleston, or Jamestown. The colonists very early felt the inconvenience of this little arrangement; and, being a sharp set, soon: perceived the loss in thus buying and selling exclu- sively in a foreign market, stuff which they could suit themselves better with at home, even if the articles did not have the companies' trade-mark or shine. with"   THE MANNERS, E'C., OF THE COLONISS. 189 189  ;heir patented varnish. Gradually they tried their hands at law-making and officer-making; and, finding  how easy it was, took a great liking to the business; and at length, dropping the foreign-made articles one after another, came to carry, on a considerable manu- Facture of their own. The Yankee colonists were par- ticularly handy at making church regulations, and so multiplied them that we doubt whether any churches then existing had such a large and full collection. Ill fact, in some parts of New England, church-members had a difficulty often in knowing what to do, not hatv- ing sufficient time to read-the long codes, and yet con- scientiously fearing lest they might offend against some of their minute provisions prescribing or pro- scribing action. It may be remarked, in passing, that this c^aethes faciendi leges is an itch highly Ameri- can, no ointment having yet been found strong enough to cure it. The colonists early insisted on acquiring  their lands in fee, not liking any leases but releases. The old fable of Anteus was again vivified. The man who stands on the soil gets the strength of the earth; and forthwith wrestles down his opponents, want or idleness, be they never so herculean.  And so the simple land-owners of the Colonies, touching con- stantly their own acres, sucked up law-making power from their pores, and even imbibed a certain resisting faculty to cannons bored by any one but themselves.,  They had an aversion to roads -not made with their own hands ;- to laws of entail or inheritance, disposing of their lands which they had choppedF out of the raw side of a continent; and, in fine, became so resolutely  resistant to all resolutions moved on the far Atlantic   side, unless seconded on this by themselves through their own representatives, that we are compelled by authentic documents to believe, if the ten command- ments had been enacted by the royal law-makers without Colonial ratification, the sturdy settlers would have practically  expunged all the "nots" from  the suspected decalogue. In those early times nothing was more criminal than thile laws against criminals. Like the medical practi- tioners, the legal doctors believed in blood-letting for all ailments. Misdemeanors, now disposed of at quarter sessions and by police magistrates with small fines or petty imprisonment, then dangled at the hideous cross- bars. The soft, April-like rains- of clemency, now   and then, however, began to fall upon these hard enact- ments. Quakers mildly doubted whether these scare- crows really frightened other offenders off the fields of crime. Silent tears, shed in secret household places over brothers and   sons hung upon high   hills for stealing or trespass, began to gather, like the waters- of fountains hidden away in the depths of valleys, and to create that large American river, Public Sentiment, --larger than the Hudson, the Ohio, or the- Mississippi, - which, rising and rising, has swept so many abuses and errors into the gulfs of time.  That solemn Saxon joke,; a coroner's inquest, as gloomy in its- dissections, and as funny in its illogical conclusions, as in the ]land of tie heptarchy, was not denied to those'deodand colonists whose hearts sud- denly stopped   beating, and whose   mortal wrecks, thrown  up  on that very  weary shore "Crow'ners-   192 THE COMC 'HSTORY OF THE UNITED ST'ATIES. Law" were always prizes for small bunglers. For live, men, habeas corpus, that great opener of illegally locked doors, began at the close of the century to be provided. If colonial judges sometimes' wrote to England to know how vto decide cases politically edged, for fear they might cut a royal prerogative or sharpen popular rights; or if justices of the peace- those small ped- lers of very common law, and uncommon specimens of judicial wares -dribbled out decisions for plain- tiff or defendant, not knowing which was which, the puzzled magistrate givingropinions about the off ox, without knowing which was- the " off" or which the "near ' ox; or if sometimes in extreme cases the ob- fuscated and doubting arbiter of law consulted his wife and retailed her candle lecture to the astonished suitor, as his well-considered judgment in the case,- in the main it may be averred that justice was as well tolled from the mills, as in., these latter days when the judicial miller takes from the bag before the -grist goes in, and sees to it that his private gutter taps the hopper before it shakes itself into the cus- tomer's heap. Color is supposed to lurk just under the  outer skin, and, if placed on the scales, to be impon- derable; but it was always found that positive cColors, when put on the judicial Fair banks, were very light; the white, which is no color at all, invariably weigh- ing down that side of the balance, when a cinnamon- colored Indian or a black-berried African was found in the other.

The bars down, off they scampered,     i dashing up their heels and tossing their heads in the fresh air. Scarcely, however, had they gone a stone's throw in the great unfenced field, before they snuffed a sulphu- rous smell from the adjacent lot, the French settle- iments of Acadia. Queen Anne, the second daughter of James II., who, in 1702  had succeeded her sister"s ' Mary, which aforesaid Mary, with her husband,' the Orange William, had, as we have already seen, found England too small for them  and the aforementioned James, also took a fancy that France was, being made too comfortable for her migratory parent, and, in order to keep him travelling, bombarded that country.  This   ! little experiment, called in the large-bore histories, Queen Anne's War, lasted eleven years, and cost Eng- land about one sixteenth of her entire value. She obtained, however, as compensation for this outlay, these results in Europe: several fresh monuments in Westminster Abbey, a staggering back-load of debt, a crowd of one-sleeved men, many young women in be- coming widow's caps, Marlborough and wife with sala- ries amounting yearly to thlree hundred and twenty- six thousand dollars besides the snug little box at Blenheim Palace, the glorious though empty victories of Ramillies, Malplaquet, Oudenarde, and Blenheim, and that very big elephant, the rock of Gibraltar. Of course our colts became intensely excited by' the gunpowdery air, tore away into the northern French lot, and fell to kicking most lustily. The French fillies there naturally bit back and let fly their gallic-shod heels freely; but the New England ponies   196 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. so worried and wounded them in the flanks and hips as to drive them clean out of the field. Port Royal was reduced and became Ann-apolis; and Acadia, battered by colonial guns to a wreck, and turning up in her distress under the name of Nova Scotia; grasped one of those long humane lines which the f Marine Society, or government located at London, threw out at that time continually for distressed communities. To this'sea- line the blue-nosed, fish-shaped peninsula has since held "with the bite of a codfish, trolled and played by the Izaak1 Walton of nations, until the fish shows signs of letting go the hook. Amid the Alpine glaciers of war, however, there bloomed, as travellers find high up among the ice- fields, the graceful and tender flowers of gentler life. The Colonies started the century with a newspaper. The Boston "News-Letter," printed on a foolscap, sheet, and isued once a week, in 1704, only twenty-eight years after the first newspaper was started, and in the very year the first editor, Roger FEstrange, died, was' the parent of that large family of children of all sizes  and with such varied characters, which are now dis- seminated through almost every village of the land, and has acquired such a wide influence, interest, and large real estates among us. Meet it was that this prolific stock should have originated on the spot where, as- is now pretty well proved, the first white men who visited our continent made their first landing within our borders, seven hundred years before. It must not, however, be supposed, that the pioneers in newspapers were Danes. Fromn all that can now be ascertained, they were Bohemians. We may add that the "News-   OLONIES, LOWER HALF oF EIG.

But, these were not the only papers issued. The Bank of England had been established in 1694; and eighteen years later,- paper credits were issued by South Carolina to the amount of 48,000. Massa- chusetts with her presses could of course print more promises, and in 1714 she beat South Carolina by 2,000. Other Colonies followed, even Rhode Island, distrusting Providence, built a paper-house on the sands of credit. The floods soon came upon all these unstable edifices, and there were many " moving acci- dents by flood" to the washed banks. The slight silver foundations were undermined, and the banking- houses fell, and "great was the fall thereof." Twenty- five years after the first bank was established; few of the credits were worth over twenty cents on the prom- ised dollar. Those of North Carolina descended to seven, - almost as low as Confederate paper in 1865. But the scheme most American in size and prom- ises was started in France by a Scotchman in 1716. [ He proposed to the Frenih Regent and established ;- upon- the boundless trust in the untold, because not unfolded, mining wealth of the valley of the Mississippi, a company, spawning 200,000 shares of stock, aggre- gating at the par value one thousand millions of livres, which, on the iron strength of human- faith, six mil- lions only of silver in its own vaults, and the hand- some certificates that hinted at more figures than ordinary arithmetic can compute, agreed to pay the 1     I         ,  '    ' ^  -  ^   COLONIEs, LOWER HALF OF EIG .        199 vast public debt of Fran e, swollen under Louis XIV. efoy per cent  Mississi freshet, and to distribute p      annually to the stockholders.

The prophets of a rise were many , the real profits veryfew; and in four years the principal had gone where De Soto's armor was rusting. lle   golden Armada   of France was snagged  , and dispersed beyond t he reach of diver or bell. The speed with whichl shares, swollen from one thousand to ten thousand were suddenly pricked and vanished, and the rapid changes inthe fortunes of their holders, are well exp ressed by a French pas- quinlade of the period : .- "Lundi, j'achetais des actions; Mardi, je gagnai des millions; Xercredi, J'ornai m on menage; Jeudi, je pris un equipage; Vendredi, je nm'en fls au bal; Et Samedi, a l'hopital."

'. iiiJ :   200 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, The experiments of the colonists thus early in en- graved promises showed how adventurous and 'hopeful they had become. The unfavorable results did not indent their faith. There was always a side-pocket for American losses. In this they clapped their broken bank-bills, and John Law's handsome certificates with the wonderful figures that had "cut so many shines," and went on., The building of a few rice-machines, sugar-mills, or school-houses were checked for a few months; the clearing of some lots was less rapid; the purchase of a new gown for .Prudence, or a new waist- coat for John Smith's great-great-grandson, postponed; but the subscriptions to the Boston "News-Letter" did not fall ,off, nor the Franklin loaf diminish in weight. There was one important branch of American in- dustry and wealth which actually increased most dur- ing the severest periods of financial losses, the manu- facturing of children. At the close of Queen Anne's war, in 1713, the Colonies had a population of four hundred thousand, --an increase of one hundred and sixty-five thousand since the bars were let down. This population doubled during the next thirty years. So many new boys cominig forward required of course more training. A long-sighted governor of the East Indies, Elihu Yale by name, reached a hand across the seas, and -placed some books and a little money at the feet of a few wise-hearted men in Con- necticut, who took them up, and planted them for a few years at Saybrook. The gits thriving well, they were transplanted to New Haven. Everybody knows how these mustard shoots have grown; how their   COLONIES, LWER HALF OF EIlH *N T,^ CENTURY. 201   202 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. sturdy arms ever keep touching the westering borders, dropping schoolmistresses on Southern soils, ministers on Western prairies, spicy editors for city sandwiches; even their dead branches enriching the deep soils of scientific and theologic thought. The planting of schools increased. It was always a favorite branch of American husbandry. The school- house was frequently the -first seedling put in. Now more carefully fenced about, it became the querus gzianteus' Americanms, -to our plantations what the British oak is on an English estate, the glorious spike that rivets it to the wave-rocked island. Birch-trees could hardly supply the colonial demand upon them. School-girls opened the slate-quarries for chewing- pencils, and stripped the spruce-trees for gum. Know- est thou not, O reader, what a close connection there is between pencil and gum chewing and female educa- tion? If not, thou hast not been blessed with sisters between the liquid ages of fourteen and seventeen, and must hasten to study female geology, which embeds between its- slaty folds the beautiful ferns and flora of knowledge. Thou must betake thyself to the nearest seminary, and observe the sudden and deep openings down through slate-lined shafts into the mines of earthly learning. The treaty of Utrecht in 1713 closed and sealed Queen Anne's war. There was a repose through the Colonies for thirty-one years. During this period the Colonies stretched themselves, took in new ideas, and let out the strait bandages which still swathed them. Delaware, dandled on the knee of Pennsylvania i(ntil 1708, having cut her first teeth, was set down to crow   UiLUnlBE, LOwER HAT s OF EIGHTEENTH CENTCAp203 -a ' like a young cock among the blue hen'schickens.  . : mont, as we have before seen, undergoing pretty-  rugged nursing through her vigorous babyhood, was at last plumped upon the floor by New York, in 1724, with a smart cuff on the ears, and the ungracious and thankless advice, "Now go, if you must, and take care of yourself."  The youngster, who had found out for some time that she could not only run alone, but could even climb up to her own  Saddle-Back, immediately started off, and was soon seen setting up education factories, saw-mills, meeting-houses, and nut-shellers, and running a variety of very transporting businesses between Lake Champlain and   the Connecticut Piver. It was a long time before she got her lines with New York out of tangle and   settled; but as Vermonters never felt any practical difficulty in crossing lines whenever they saw pleasanter ones in better places, ithis uncertainty as to the exact limits of her colonial cords rather facilitated than impeded her circulation and growth. New  Hampshire -well out at length from the leading-strings of Massachusetts, in 1741- toddled slowly up into hardy strength. From  her whitened hills she was obliged to keep a  sharp'look- out northwards upon the saucy French -and tricky Indians, and, in spite of all her sentries and vigilant scouts, suffered more than her share from them both. The Indians took off many of her scalps; but, notwith- standing all their sharp knives, she kept her Profile safe and unscarred, and was even Keene enough to outlive the   neighboring toma hawks and the more distant and swooping night-hawks from the St. Law- rence.    O4: THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED 'STAt. New York was stunted in her growth for a short ime, in 1741, by the report of a negro plot. It turned - nut, however, to be ' a great cry and little wool." Yet on the bare suspiciqn of a design to burn the city, more than thirty slaves were judicially massacred. Thegolden waves of commerce, however soon closed over the momentary plunge of the sable coffins, and the delusion, like that at Salem half a century before, rippled away from the spot in widening circles until  ithroke from the historic shore I Some events, insig- nificant at the time, grow larger as they approach the higher land of civilization; others, magnified by local passion, soon sink forever out ofsiglt. Theformer are buoyed up by the life-floats of principle; the lat- ter, unworthy of salvage, break and vanish. Tusp the contests of the colonists with the proprie- tors, slowly marking the advancing tide of civil free- dom, are hardened on the shore line of our past his- tory. Although they themselves were too busyin na king-to study the results when accomplished, their descendants, from muore cultivated heights, ponder carefully the wave-tracks, as geologists mark and measure the traces of ancient sea-marks in coal-beds, overlaid to-day with the weighty accumulations of ages. On the other hand, the petty struggles in Vir- ginia, Massachusetts, and South Carolina to establish ecclesiastical supremacy, and in other Colonies to set up sumptuary laws prescribing the number, cost, or cut of-garments, although at. the t  ime tossing uP  great masses of foam, like foam speedily dissolved into nothingness.          The Colonies, Great doors swing on small hinges.   COLONIES, LOWE R HALF OF EIGHTEENTH CENT URY. 20,5 towards the close of the first half of the century, were  destined to add another example to the many notable *proofs which the history of nations before them had furnished of this fact historically observed. The Mace- doniah Empire burst over the little excess of wine poured one day into Alexander's cup.  The chance meeting of Henry VIII. with Anna Boleyn altered the dynastic current and the religious faith of Eng- land, changed the European Atlas, and affected for- ever the settlement, civilization, and characters of the American Colonies. The acid temper of Tetzel pre- cipitated into Luther's cup, raised the Reformation into sudden effervescence. The evenly grooved dis- position of William the Silent was a pivotal point around which the liberties of the Dutch Republic safely turned. An accident might have easily changed the character or shifted that individual centre, and sent the unbalanced periphery of the state into disas- trous confusion or ruin. And so the -accidental birth of a daughter, instead of a son, to Charles VI. of Austria, was an unfortunate windfall, which in 1744 raised a tempest of war that enveloped all Europe, and swept with fury over their Transatlantic Colonies. The entire Continent was marshalled into two hostile camps for eight years; England, France, Austria, Prus- sia, Spain, Holland, and nearly all the minor states, let out their best blood,-the heart's,-; or crippled the best limbs of their young and middle-aged men, spent all their available cash, and mortgaged the fu- ture; summer fields of grain were trampled out and. re- manured by the bone-dust of poor soldiers; Fontenoy, Bergenl-op-Zoom, and other places were made, by their  206 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. horrors, resorts ever since of idle tourists; and all Europe, in fact, begirt with war-fires which burnt up . the accumulated wealth of generations, -and all be- cause of that little windfall on the lot of Charles VI. Of all the multitudes maimed, butchered, or consigned to costly pension lists, only two individuals had the slightest interest in the wild carnival, - Maria Theresa, the windfall, the Pomona apple of discord, and one Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria. France and Eng- land were of course on opposite sides, and the Co- lonial clocks marked Greenwich or Paris time as the master hands set them. The' great iron pendulums on each side the sea swung together. The hour-hands constantly set off bells that tolled to funerals. The Colonies followed the hearses in mourning purchased by themselves. Genuine Americans already, they dis- dained to mention the expense, or to complain that it was beyond their means. In spite of -funerals, how- ever, and though the bells toll never so sadly, boys will grow. The first George had come to the English throne in 1714. The second, third, and fourth of the same name successively covered it with their persons until 1830, -a century of English Georgics, full enough of bucolic stupidity and ox-like' lolling down in rich clover, so far as the sovereigns were concerned, but bristling with short-horned and long-horned wars that pushed and gored in all directions. The second George, imported, like his sire, from Hanover, had been rolling in the rich English pastures for thirteen years, when the war of which we are now speaking commenced impaling so many victims,-a war which passes in   COLONIES, LOWER HALF OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY. 207  Rit our American chronicles under the name of "King K George's war," but in European history is known as   i "the war of the Austrian succession."

But somehow, in spite of his disreputable antecedents, Mars had contrived to acquire a very strong influence over that part of our planet occupied by the thirteen Colonies, from the time of the very first settlement at Jamestown, in 1607,. throughout all the century and a half which followed. Over that tract of time, their march along the highway of life was like an Irish landlord's visit to his own es- tate, -armed, grim, and hostilely interrogative of all who approached.   Like his, their advance, too, was "Per ignes' Suppositos cineri doloso." During the one hundred and forty-seven years of which  we speak, sixteen distinct wars with. various Indian  tribes or confederacies, averaging one every nine years, had been carried on at warious points, from the extreme northeast to'the farthest southern border. In  these wars, formal expeditions were organized, bodies of troops, large for the populations, raised, - equipped, and sent out amid the sighs of young-ladies and the fears of their mothers, punishing. old mas- sacres, and  wasting, like prairie fires, whole districts, and of course kindling other Indian resentments that swept back over the settlements. i v   lg   210 THE COMC HSrORY OF THE UNITED 5lA&.D' Over nearly all of these combustible war piles it was found that French oil was poured to make the fire take readily, and French bellows w ere at work to blow the savage flames into a disastrous conflagration. , Between these more formidable expeditions were inter, jected petty skirmishes, midnight attacks, sorties, and reprisals, as numerous and as little regarded by the colonists in general as railroad killings or corpora- tion massacres with us. Guns and swords were as common in farmers' houses, as spades and hoes to-day. Arrows to the right, left, and in front of them, pointed many colonial morals, and adorned many a sad tale of border life. Bloody Brooks were christened with red water in three different settlements; and poor, indeed, are the annals of that town -whose records reach back beyond the half-way mile-stone of -the eighteenth cen- tury - that 6annot show the garnishments of the bow and arrow. Few, indeed, were the families of New England that coulid keep the Passover, commemora- tive of exemptions from the terrible visitations of the Indian smiter. Besides these chronic and almost ceaseless domestic troubles, the great continental wars-those of 1651 and 1664 between England and Holland, in 1656 between E-ngrland and Spain, King William's war from 1688 to 1697, Queen Anne's from 1702 to 1713, and that free European fight for the Austrian succes- sion which closed the half-century, covering in all twenty-nine years on this side the sea-drew be- tween their mailed hands the tender Colonies, wrenched their young and growing interests from them, and hurled their protectors sometimes against the Frencli w h C        r         i   l nH jiNAiurijujnlijr jpvil InL ARIMJ&.VAIN DC154, .1Lj It  oof Acadia and New  France, sometimes against the ever-hostile Indian tribes. The patched-up peaces which followed these great wars, and which covered the European breaches, left the colonial combatants battered and bruised, ragged in clothes, in debt for expenses, and in mourning for the lost, with French- men and Indians irritated by the conflict, and goaded into hot revenges, which even the snows of New France could not cool. In a word, the entire belt of land northwards and westward of the plantations was highly volcanic, some peak almost continually in eruption, while always throughout its whole extent mutterings under the cindered heat threatened wide-shaking action and crimsoned tidal waves. The animosity between the French and English. races in, Europej in 1754, almost surpasses our be- lief. For four centuries, from the days of Edward I. and the black-mailed Prince, who, with- their armies, overran France, almost as numerously, and wrought as violently on her pride and taste as the irruptions of green-backed Americans to-day, French and English armies in the field, navies on the sea, wit, caricature, heavy-folioed bombs, light artillery, pasquinades, and exploding mines of sarcasm and raillery, not only mounded -new graves on either side the Channel, and gashed ever-reminding physical wounds, but fretted and frayed Sa-xon self-complacency and Gallic egotism. Cressy, in 1346; Agincourt, in 141,5; the battle of the Spurs, in 1513; the war in aid of the Huguenots, in 1627; Blenheim  and Malplaquet, in 1706 and 1709,- planted bitter memories that waved continually  212 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. in vigorous harvests of rancorous hatred. Jealous rivals istood by to remind each of her supposed dis- graces; and thus to profit by new quarrels. Commer- cial competition rubbed salt water into the raw places. Differences of religious faith chafed them with brim- stone. Squibs, tossed backwards and forwards, lit on inflamed parts, and raised national sores, Spanish- fly several times drew angry blisters, and proud flesh often set in around the edges. Plasters were of course put on by diplomatic surgeons; but the trouble was deeper than their patches could reach. The knife and steel scissors were then brought in again, and the national vivisections began anew.  These surgical operations were almost constantly going on, and their description in Hume, Robertson, and other historians, might be appropriately called Memoirs of Celebrated Cases in Surgery. It must be remembered that, at the period to which we are drawing the reader's attention, railroads and swift steamers had not yet ironed out the stiff mastiff- like ruffles around the necks of these high-spirited, full-blooded nations. International expositions had not spread their cloths over the Field of Gold, on which rapiers should only be used to cut English roast beef and French pudding, and helmets be turned up into drinking-cups, to quaff, in cool Bordeaux, toasts to the entente cordial of solid peace. On the contrary, at the middle of the eighteenth century the mutual hatred of the two nations saturated. everything. National drinks, popular on one side of the twenty- mile strait which parted theeimbibers, were poisons on the other, Clothes, worn by one race, were not only   ,THE CHAMPIONSHP FOR THE AMERICAN BELT. 213 shunned, but caricatured with pen and pencil by the other. The paintings, the plastic arts, the literature, and legislation of the period have preserved in endur- ing forms the widely felt antipathy. Their mutual rancor dissolved the obligations of courtesy, dripped through diplomatic despatches, and left the green mould of jealousy on all the relations of the two gov- ernments, and even the business transactions of their  people. This envenomed home feeling had early crossed the Atlantic, and lost none of its acridity on the passage In point of time the English were before the' French in their American discoveries, but in settlement the French preceded the English. While-the Cabots, the first Englishmen who ran down our country, touch- ing in 1498 at Newfoundland, and thence coasting along our shores as far as Florida, without leaving any colonists behind them, anticipated Verizzanni, the first French discoverer in America, by twenty-five years, the French under Cartier in 1534, Roberval in 1542, and Ribault in 1562, landed and nnmade fugitive settlements at various points, from the Hu- guenot plantation in South Carolina northwards around the present Provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New   Brunswick, and up the St. Lawrence as far westward as  Montreal. Over this entire broad strip they had affixed the label "New France. The English made no further .discoveries of, nor .ny settle- ments in, America, after Cabot's expedition, util 1583, when Sir Humphrey Gilbert, freighted with a charter from Queen Elizabeth, sailed for Virginia with a com- pany of settlers. This was rapidly followed up, with *   214 THE COMC' HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES: little permanent result, however, by Raleigh, Gran- ville, and Gosnold. The French settlement of Port Royal, on the Bay of Fundy, antedated that of the English at Jamestown five years. EnglandLand France now vied with each other in granting large deeds of American territory, most of which conflicted with each other, as their martial deeds had done at home. The English Henry VII. granted to Mr. John Cabot all the lands which he might discover, reserving to his royal self a small commission of twenty per cent. Five years later the French Henry IV., without employing any lawyer to search the title, gave to De Monts so much of the, same North American lot as now embraces Pennsyl- vania, New Jersey, New York, the New England States, and the confederated Dominion of Canada. Other unwarrantable warranty deeds were subse- quently made and done by the rival grantors, involv- ing the titles in distressing doubt and confusion. Military actions of ejectment followed. As early as 1629, Champlain and his French colony were driven from Quebec, like squatters on the property of another, and the French would then have been all ejected from New France but for an unwise and ignorant settle- ment - between the two large European landlords, called the Treaty of 1630. Subsequently the French were dispossessed, as we have elsewhere recorded, of patches of the large estate given to De Monts,- Nova Scotia in 1710, and Cape Breton in 1745,--mere- strips: it is true, compared with that broad-sweeping tract around which they had carried chain and com- pass, and planted the boundary stakes of stockades   THE CHAMPIONSHP FOR THE AMERICAN BELT. 215 and forts, but which touched their national pride at its very heart centre. The French growth in America was as steady as it was early in starting.  Five years before the Pilgrim fathers  and mothers landed at- Plymouth,  French missionaries had erected bark chapels in Maine, and consigned by devout rites the Pine State to the Vir- gin's protection. While the Calvinists of Massachu- setts Bay, the Plymouth Colony, and Connecticut were sturdily settling, by wordy argument, the grounds of their religious  belief, Fathers Brebeuf, Lallemand, and other Gallic Jesuits were steadily and stealthily acquiring new grounds for the Pope ' and the French  king.   Barefooted emissaries, in serge, and girded, like -the Baptist in the Judmean wil- derness, with girdles about their loins, patiently and slowly travelling twelve hundred miles westward, foot- weary, yet sustained by spiritual zeal, skirted those inland seas, Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Michigan, crossed the head-waters of the Hudson, the Ohio, and Wisconsin, hauled their birch canoes over regions now boiling with oil-wells, hissing with steam-driven factories, or lit up by the passing splendors of palace rail-cars, and had thus, as early as 1650, planted the Roman cross and the French lily side by side, as- far west as Fond du Lac, and the cool head-fountains of Lake Superior. Fur-traders followed the Jesuit mis- sionaries. These sought to clothe the Indians with a warm belief in the teachings of the Society of Jesus, and in the supremacy of his Catholic Majesty    of France; those hastened after to unclothe the otter, the beaver, and other living fur-dealers of the small   216  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. :.:,r /\    1^   ^\ (c" N" 0'i ", . \   THE CHAMPIONSHP FOR THE AMERICAN BELT. 217 packs which they carried on their own backs, and to. obtain possession of' those which their fellows had yielded up to the sharp persuasions of the cinnamon- stained hunters and trappers. Religious zeal, inflainm- ing French blood, and glowinig through a patriotic national emulation with the English settlements along the Atlantic slope, within the next twenty-five years, launched canoes upon and traversed the great lakes pushed down the principal rivers running southward from Quebec to St. Paul, gathered- proselytes by preaching, and skins by trading, and encompassing the needs, instincts, and revenges of the various Indian tribes scattered through this vast region, -excepting  always the Five Nations, which uniformly adhered to the English,-- established a cordon of French alli-  ances and influences, which in time of peace stretched - its protecting line between them and their English rivals, and in war vibrated to their touch, and twanged quivers full of arrows on their hereditary foes. .These unwearying teachers and traders were now to take  possession, in the name of France and Rome, of the valley of the Mississippi, and to scatter the seeds of Gallic civilization all down its prolific breadth, and over its wide deltas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. In 1673, the Jesuit, James Marquette, having previously penetrated from  Quebec through the intervening wilderness to Sault St. Marie, and there established the -first white settlement in .the present State of Michigan, set out, with Joliet and two tawny interpreters, to trace the mysteries of the Great River of America. Sailing down the Wisconsin River, and reaching in a few   days that wide-rolling flood L 10   218 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. which we now call the Mississippi River, and floating on its rough but kindly bosom for one hundred and eighty miles, they landed on its western bank, and, crossing a narrow portage, struck, without hurting, the Des Moines Eiver. They were the first white men in Iowa, and next to De Soto, one hundred and thirty-one years before them, the only pale children that had ever looked into the wrinkled face of the Father of Waters. Here they were met by four red men, who, in answer to their inquiries, loftily pro- claimed themselves to be "Illinois )" or "Men." The spirit of Chicago, thus filtrated, antedated its own settlement over one hundred and fifty years. Re- embarking, these Gallic adventurers swept on down the rapidly rushing river unsnagged; passed in safety the large open mouth of the Missouri; overlooked the future site of St. Louis; refused to listen to the temp-  tation which beckoned them to ascend the Ohio to the future metropolis of bacon; floated along over the rust- ing armor of De Soto, without diving for it, keeping a good lookout on the dangerous territory of Arkansas on their right, and Mississippi on their 'left, until they at last reached the point where the Arkansas River hastens to throw its burden of earth and water upon. the' back of the giant stream. Here they found In- dians with European weapons of steel; and they re- turned back, retracing their courageous steps home- ward. Marquette, let us add, preached for two years to the wild men in and around the future Chicago, and finally died upon the borders of a little stream in Michigan, which gratefully perpetuates his name in its own.   THE CHAMPIONSHP FOR THE AMEmCAN  BELT.. 219 Brave Marquette! He escaped the perils of Chi- cago to yield up his spirit amid the innocencies of Michigan. In 1682 La Salle, the French fur-trader, ventured j down the Mississippi to the aulf, without stopping to take the bluff outposts that sentinelled the future Vicksburg, and without halting over night at Natchez, and encountering the loss of all his earnings in that hazardous, porous, and absorbing place. Two years later he formed one of a colony sent out from Rochelle, in France, by the minister Colbert, and was Wrecked in the Bay of Metagorda, the first of that large series of castaways in that peculiarly enterprising empire called Texas d                France thus added the lone star to her American constellationl. Although the entire French population in America, in 1688, was, by their own count, only eleven thou- sand two hundred and forty-nine, agalnst more than ten ti nies that number of Enlish-speaking, colonists, they had: ere the close of that century erected mission- me. hue andt Sda-ntnS^^ ^,1 houses and trading-posts from the mouth of the Ken- nebec, in M  aine, westward and northward to the F als of M  innehah a, and southward down the Missis- i sippi, through Louisia na, Texas, and Southern Missis-  s  ippi.

Two years 'following, an invoice of twenty young French girls was sent out to help the census-taker. The lot suiting well, a second consignment of twenty-three was despatched  the next year. These vivacious goods, however, it may be incidentally remarked, rose the following year, in price and self-estimation, and formed what is called "The Petticoat Insurrection," a rebellion against the limited amount of Indian corn served out during a season of scarcity. But more corn coming out they acknowledged it, and went down in pleased submis- sion and quiet. Lively Frenchmen now multiplied along the yeasty Gulf. In 1718 Bienville, then the French governor of Louisiana, courageously braving the alligators and  swamp snakes, whose crescent attitude might have terrified a son of St. Patrick, began the city of New Orleans, of which, four years afterwards, Charlevoix, the historian and traveller, who visited it, gives this description "The place has a population of about two hundred. I find it to consist of one hundred cabins disposed with little regularity; a large wooden ware- house; two- or three dwellings that would be no orna- ment to a French village, and the half of a sorry store- house, which they were pleased to lend to the Lord, but of which he had: scarcely taken possession when it was proposed to turn him out to lodge in a tent."- These kind of loans, some maliciously aver, have con- tinued fashionable in the Crescent City from that time , to the, present.

Imperial, too, was their stretch. Beginning at St. Johnfs, New Brunswick, and dotting the wide area that fills seven- teen hundred miles between that point and the Missis- sippi River, at the present spunky little city of St. Paul, and stretching down that river fourteen hundred miles to its outlet, and so spreading westward into Texas, and eastward through Mississippi and Alabama, until they confronted the old .Spanish plantation in Florida, these settlements zoned on three sides with a spiked belt the thirteen English Colonies on the Atlantic. Around the middle of the eighteenth century, the accumulations of hatred through the preceding four had gathered to a festering head the hostile memo- ries of the French race of English assumption, vic- tories; and national contempt; and so through all this wide circuit of settlement, under cassock and surplice, under the coat of the soldier and the bear- skin of, the trader, beat zealous French hearts,- ready to assert the claims of a king deemed by them right- fully in possession, and to earn the absolution of a spiritual sovereign at Rome, ready, since the schism of Henry VIil., to be given to any one who would de- spoil or destroy the heretic English. Young America, now at the budding period of her sweet sixteen, was, with-her personal charms, her ample landed dower, and her ampler future expecta- tions, a damsel well worth the keenest and- best efforts   THE CHAMPIONSHP FOR THE AMERICAN BELT. 223 of the two European rivals. France, -besides being red with the desire of getting possession of the large commissions likely to accrue from the handling her handsome estate, was anxious to make her Roman Catholic. For one hundred years she had been ene    i *deavoring to persuade the young girl to take from herself and place around her fair neek a rosary among whose beads, at regular intervals, were interspersed some larger than the others wrought; into shapes of cannon, swivels, little forts, and stockades.  England, ever lookin g after rich wards in chancery, with solid landed cares, requiring a guardian, had as assiduously sought to gain the custody, and even to win the hand of the fresh and rosy American. She had not failed to observe the long and carefully made rosary, and had sought several times angrily to tear it off her neck with a glaived hand, and had more than  once instigated the Iroq uois to cut the shining chain at Lakes Champlain and Erie and on the-Monongahela and to scatter the metallic beads She had also sent emissaries from th e seaboard westward, bearing Prot-  '  estant school-houses and churches, mission-houses, traders' articles, and Saxon notions, to barter and  exchange for the coveted rosary.

John Bull, bluff, beef-fed, plucky, and long-winded, weighing forty stone, stepped into the ring, tossed his tarpaulin to the centre, and having tipped off a bottle of Bass's double XX, challenged Johnny Crapeau to fight it out for the lass. The Frenchman stripped at once for the fight, and with a nimble courtesy, thinly concealing his disdain, glided within the ropes which now surrounded the champions of Europe. Into the middle of the ring the belt was thrown. It was em- broidered with'Indian' bead-work at one end and with beautifully wrought and valuable cotton fringes at the other, while picturesque figures of forest, lake, and plain set off the centre, and precious jewels and costly stones glittered all along either edge. For nine years that great and deadly boxing-match lasted. Why should we dwell upon it in'detail? The world's reporters were there, and have given full and accurate accounts, which have been read everywhere, except in France, with animated interest. Most briefly, however, we may summarize the con- test. At the first call, each competitor came promptly forward, each eying the other warily, but with ill- suppressed dislike and jealousy. Some feints fol- lowed. A few passes were cautiously made, as if each'was measuring his adversary and feeling for his strong and weak points. At length a rapid and dex- terouis touch of Mr. Bull's stomach sent him uneasily back to his corner. Time was called for the second round in 1.755, and, leaping forward, the alert Gaul" struck his heavy, blundering antagonist in a weak- spot   'ELD v rtAnlA lv1AojUl r 1!VA, 1T1  AM MuUN BELTt ZdiiZiO in front, called Fort du Quesne, from which he reeled back to his place, and was held up for a time in a fainting condition by one George Washington, a young man of twenty-two, then a friend of Mr. Bull, and in- vited to be present. Recovering after a little- time, Mr. Bull suddenly sprang up in intense suffering and mortification, and made across the ring in fury; but- scarcely had he got within reach of the Frenchman, when he received a stunning blow on his very Crown Point. Time being up, the stout Briton again advanced towards his adversary with a most menacing manner, and struck out full from the shoulder, as if he in- tended to leave an awkward scar in the 'face, but missing his footing, he fell forward in a pool of water, named Ontario, the angry Gaul rolling over him, and punishing him when down in a manner deemed almost foul by the spectators. On the fourth round, in 1757, the Saxon pugilist rushed confidently forward, and aimed a direct thrust at a very ugly pimple on the Frenchman's face, called Louisburg; but the Celt skilfully parried the home thrust, and, while his adver- sary was gathering himself to a second onset, delivered a regular Montcalm   settler at Ticonderoga, a very tender British point, which drew blood in profusion. Thus far the heavy Englishman had been worsted in every encounter; but on the next round he ad- vanced from  his wintry corner with great caution, set his teeth together firmly, and, making a feint, struck his antagonist, ere he had recovered, two quick, telling blows, one on his face, completely crushing that ugly pimple, and the other on that spot in the chest still sore, Fort du Quesne; but while the Englishman was 10*               o   ,226 THE COMOC HSTORY OF THE UNITED 'STATES. all too intent upon these, his antagonist got in an- other Montcalm settler on that English mouth, Lake Champlain, which brought out blood and water quite distressing for innocent spectators to witness. Both parties now retired to their corners, the French- man pretty well exhausted, Mr. Bull just getting warmed up to the fight, and both, if possible, more in- ,furiated than ever. Each was thoroughly sponged, and on time being called for the sixth' round, in 1759, John Bull strode completely across the ring to the spot which his adversary had chosen, glaring like a very Wolfe. He had tasted blood, his own was up, and his leonine nature was roused for a crushing spring. Quickly and rapidly he planted a blow be- tween the Gauil's blue eyes, breaking the bridge of his nose at Point Levi. To evade this blow, the Gaul leaped back and attempted to parry it, and at the same time to inflict upon his enemy another Mont-  calm settler; but quick as thought Mr. Bull, heavy as he was, sprang upon a small mound called the Plains of Abraham, and there, swinging his sinewy arm high in the air, brought down his ponderous fist full upon the Frenchman's head. Staggering backwards to the ropes, the Celt fell headlong, bloody and cruelly hurt. To the on-lookers it was manifest that the hot con-, test was virtually decided; but a resentment that pulsed through every vein urged the Frenchman to a few more unsuccessful efforts. Coming 'up slowly to the summons in the three last rounds, in 1760, 1761, and 1762, just making time and saving himself from the confession of defeat, he sank down at the end of the ninth round, spent in spirits and strength, but   THE CHAMPiONSHP  FOR THE AMERICANBELT. 227' , , . # * , ' :E                  .

A herald, advancing in the centre of the ring, proclaimed that Johnny Crapeau withdrew his claim to the belt, only stipulating, in consideration of the past, that he might 'keep a bit of the fringe off its western end. John Bull, picking up the coveted prize, announced in a bluff, resolute voice to the by-standers that the young lady, with the belt, dower, and expectations, all now passed to him forever. Future chapters will show how little he knew of the maiden whom he claimed to have won. Meanwhile Jean Crapeau signed and delivered to his English victor a release of all his claims to the dam- sel's lands lying east of the Mississippi.   CHAPTER .XIll.

By these heavy machines the seas were made all up - hill to American, and easy down hill for English ships. 8th Cause. - The colonial assemblies, where Ameri- cans learned their own country dances, and unlearned the court quadrilles. 9th Cause. -The strong Saxon dislike of imposi- tions which had accompanied the emigrants hither as a principle, and was always kept here, both principal and interest. 10th Cause.-That little Boston tea-party, and the small unpleasantness at Lexington. "th Cause. - The large amount of Atlantic water which prevented the English tea seller from observing the rights of the American tea purchaser. After this discovery of English ,near-sightedness, the expense of sweetening the tea to make it acceptable to American palates, even when the cost was reduced; to three- pence per pound, was found to be intolerable.

Everybody crowds up to witness the great red eye glare and scowl, as if it resented the safe inspection which those on the platform give it, as it rushes BRITANNIA FORCES TEA ON HER TROUBLE- past. - Every one, SOME CHLD.     young and old,watch-, es, with. concentrated interest, the momentarily visible heads of the passen- gers, dusty, dishevelled, and hot, seen through the pass- ing windows, as the train pants, hurrying around a curve, into the darkness. Not a little of the interest ' is enhanced by the feeling that it will bring up safely far, away in, a metropolitan depot, and there decant its (wel-shaken,) effervescing freight. So stand we, surrounded by: our readers, on the platform of history, to see the American Revolution rush along upon its own way, grim, earnest, resolute, tracking its onward' march towards the'great end for which it set out. "Le genie," says Buffon, "c'est la patience." If the naturalist's definition be true, the colonial patience constituted a most remarkable exhibition of. genius. In 1763 the greater part of the colonists were the descendants of men who had escaped from hard:civil and ecclesiastical exactions in their home lands, and   FIRST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL . 237 had set up for themselves in an unappropriated field. From this new lot they sought to extract, by the dif- ficult labor of one hand, its reluctant yield for subsist- ence, and by the other to keep off from  it enemies ready to take and cut their crops. Uninvited pension- ers, called Governors, were soon sent out, in showy tinsel, to tithe their laboriously earned products, and to fence in by golden bars wrought by the settlers the royal prerogatives and pretensions, from which those settlers had endeavored to rid themselves by self-exile. In some of the Colonies mint and cummin were extracted for a church, between whose ecclesias- . tical detectives and themselves they had essayed -to put three thousand miles of disagreeable pickle, with, rods enough in it to terrify even lean curates with little to throw up. The English civil list, portioned off upon the young emigrants in the shape of office- holders, sucked up  like an :old: toper in. a newly - established tavern-the very best that the place afforded. These officials thus suffered at first to par-- take of the generous, open-house entertainment, soon cast around them to effect a permanent claim for free commons, where they had been only tolerated by 'an unselfish hospitality. As no one likes to be eaten out,. or evicted from his own house and home, even by assumed and softly spoken friends, these self-imposed guests were naturally regarded as poor, proud relatives; who came unbidden at first, put on company airs, in- sisted on company fare, needed extra waiting on, bred disaffection among the servants, and set -up the chil- dren to fancies beyond the  parental -means or au- thority.   238 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. The Navigation Acts, to which we have already adverted, which sought, contrary to all equity, right, or decency, to compel the poor fugitives from plenty and power to send away their Icanty surplus of corn, and to get what few things they needed and could afford with difficulty to procure, oceanwise, and in vessels exclusively owned, built, manned, and officered in England, were standing grievances.  They were so hard and stiff, that every ,one ran against them, and after picking himself up, looked back at them in very bad humor and' with adjectives which in such mo- ments -some utter, but which types refuse to immor- talize. Poor fowls breed rapidly. The Navigation Acts soon laid other vicious eggs. On the restoration of the monarchy in the person of Charles II., in 1660, the colonists were still further tied up by an act which restricted them in the disposition of their" salable prod- ucts to England alone,- a very desirable thing for English purchasers, but deemed by the pinched- colo- nists rather rough upon them. The affectionate step- children, however, overlooked this selfishness of the cross-grained old step-mother, and clung with roman- tic attachment to the dear old homestead, from which ; they got nothing but cheap messages of cunning en- dearment, in return for the substantial contributions which were taken back in the Thames-built clippers. These acts of Parliament were of course floored with thick, wide planking of well-jointed terms, and roofed in with a royal signature, which in English, and especially in colonial eyes until opened, made even thin shingles shine like stars; but for all this parlia-   FIRST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL L- 239 mentary carpentering the gales and storms of real life soughed and swept in through the clapboarding, some- times chilling, and sometimes wetting, the colonial tenants. Colonial lands, too, were given away as loosely and as liberally as by Congress now; then to royal, as now to railroad, favorites. A commercial strabismus, or English squint-eyedness, was sought to be made fashionable in the North American communities, just as now prevails in Canada, - an apparent look at their own interests in one direction, while in fact by this. - : crooked optical inversion, the eye is all the time look- ing intently in quite another quarter. That direction was of course northeastwardly towards those little specks of islands, that were left, in the miscellaneous creation of things, near the outer rim of Europe, and so diminutive, that the very strain to discover them behind piles of parliamentary selfishness and sup- ports, huge stacks of manufactured iron, steel, cotton, wool, and puffy conceits, was sure'to injure the sight and at last to produce qualms and nausea. (  A single tub will catch all the rain that falls over a very wide roofed house, if the gutters are rightly ad- justed.  The little tub of England caught all the waters that ran from  the wide American slopes., Then she had them all around her.  She has many still; an East India tub, a West India tub, an Australian tub, etc. The bore of the tubes which lead to these are not, perhaps, as great ncw as formerly; but now the waters are distilled before they are sent through, and so run a much   more profitable stream. Of course-she labels them all with very fine names, "Philanthropy," "Free   trade," "Justice," etc.' It matters little, however,  what the name is: the stuff' in the tub is of the -same ' :olor, a buff yellow, and of the same metallic ingredi- Her- little North American tub, at the period of which we speak, was continually changing,--a larger ne being substituted every- few years, as new gutters rere laid down, and new ways found to enlarge the water-sheds. In 1732, for example, the colonists were brbidden to sell hats to each other,-a felt-grievance Which made the- fur fly for a time; but, as usual, it nly flew from, although for, England. The next year, nother gutter was put down by the parliamentary in-man, Hatters were only allowed two apprentices, - a provision which, although very merciful now, onsidering the short work and manners and very long ay -of employees,- was then English disinterestedness. L few years later, the spirits and sweetening of the olonists were taxed, of -course not to raise the former ^ r increase the latter, but all for the benefit of that little inglo-American tub. Manufactories of various kinds 7ere prohibited to be set up, the profits arising from he sales :in America of the articles manufactured in Ingland dripping through the philanthropic tubes Ito the tight English vat. At last some patriotic and ;r-seeing colonist, getting out through the scuttle- ray upon the wide American roof, discovered not only ipes leading in all directions over it, but, on looking aarply around with a half-prying Yankee, curiosity, [so remarked some curiously contrived -parliamentary tdders of rope, hemp, leather, and other material, laced on the rear of the house, and cunningly attached   to the pipes by patented clasps, stamped "Revenue so that, by an arrangement peculiarly English, and. in- vented by some benevolent gentleman over there an official friend inside could, for example, cut off a yard from every piece five yards long, or take out. two quarts from a bushel of wheat, or a, pint from a gallon of molasses or sack, and pass these clippings down the back ladders and so off home to England, while the colonists were meanwhile entertained by an argument, solidly supported by figures, and looking as convincing as a siy-barrelled revolver ]ointed at you, to prove that there was no loss incurred, but that, on the con- trary, it was the very way to make the remainder more valuable. As long as France stayed in the American school- house there were two big, full-grown bullies, whose mutual jealousy and antagonism were the best protec- tion of the children from either; but after, the over- throw of M. Jean Crapeau in 1763, Mr. Bull thought that he could have things just as he pleased, could sit down where he liked, in such gear as he chose to make himself comfortable in, - shirt-sleeves or hunting-coat, muddy or indcecently short, - could eat up any one's lunch if he fancied, and munch the choicest fruit that the youngsters were keeping for their own use at play- time.  And so, by a law of bullyism, - which is hu- man nature ossified by success, - the moment of the triumph over the one standing champion, was the moment when the  intoxication of fancied supreme: power, producing a  vertigo of insolence, brought out around the object of the championship rivals never before suspected.   ,Z*Z: lTHE UMC nilb-Ut X VK ur uAIT Yri&I OAA1-iO.  E In a word, by slow and painful training, the Colo- nies had become their own champions.  The very year that saw the treaty of peace signed between France and England, by which the former gave up all her American possessions east of the Mis- sissippi, and resigned the belt of North America to the latter, George Grenville, the English minister, gave notice that he should introduce into Parliament a bill to oblige every colonist, who used in any way receipts, notes, drafts, leases, deeds, mortgages, or any such crafty documents, to buy from the British government and put upon them stamps, the proceeds of which sale was to be spent, of course, not' among the colonists them- selves, but in England, in paying the national debt or in some other facetious way. Of course, Americans did not object to stamps in themselves, provided they helped to make or to hold the die which printed them, and had a hand in-grooving and directing the- chan-t nels in which the pay for them should flow. But they did object-and as the event proved most sanguina- rily - to the slicing of their family loaf by a parlia- mentary knife called a stamp' act, sharpened on a London stone, and whittling off their living even with, the sparing charity of the Bull family. They did not think it either safe or right for any Taurian, or Teu- tonic, or,- Gallic chap, however gentlemanly in man- ners or benevolent in professions, to be trusted in the pantry, there to use to any extent what he might] find, whether articles of luxury, as pies or other poi' sons, or necessities, as bread, butter, cider, or other 1 field distillations.  The bill of Mr. Grenville was a little one,-very   s w . . .            .   g   K'rT TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WSREL. 24.  small and very timid,- but there was a bird bEhind it, as large as all the English crows and jackdaws put together. The bird was not introduced until the next year, 1764, when it was tricked off with some bright beads and spangles around its neck, to disguise its genus. But many in England discovered immediately that it mbelonged to the fonwily Falco Britannicus, the genuine old-fashioned British falcon, with strong, sharp claws and curved short bill to seize, and long, powerful wings to bear away across seas, the colonial prey. t is a bird now  shot at by every philosophic,'well- charged English muzzle whenever it makes its appear- ance; but at the time of which we' speak there were public ganle-keepers of the Grenville kind, not only in E  ngland but in other countries; who believed in train- ing and keeping up the breed of parliamentary or royal falcons for colonial and also for home service.' These well-fed keepers stoutly maintained that it was righ t for these fowls, deigning to leave their royal perches in-Hesse or Hanover, to alight for their royal pleasure upon private barn-yards and in granaries, and that the people were proper game and profitable sport, and should even feel honored b  y the eagle-like 'visits It was thought best, however by the English hunts- man of state to send across the Atlantic and exhibit here specimens of the fowl.? atrick H enry, Sam uel Adams, James Otis, Richard   Henry Lee, and others , well acquainted with the game and domestic birds of N orth America, at once pointed out and denounced ' the cruel spurs which this short-billed , sharp-clawed British falcon w ore. Others, if possible more out- spoken, declared their opinion tha t thi b  ird i eve.  244 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. could be domesticated on this side the water, but would get its spurs cut away and perhaps its well- feathered neck wrung, whenever it was sent over for real use among the colonists. Meanwhile, Mr. Bull declared that the colonists should not have any molasses to lick, unless he him- self brought it and sold it to them. Of course from that time forward New England people got to love molasses with patriotic obstinacy, and above all things liked to tickle it with a straw out of those very sol- emn-looking and otherwise forsaken casks, lying in the neglected custom-houses at Boston, Salem, Newport, and New Haven. In 1765, the new bird was'brought over full-fledged, guarded' by numerous fowl-fanciers, who watched it vigilantly on both sides, as the lion and unicorn are represented watching the British crown. But as usual, American quickness to its own interests was quite eqtual to British selfishness, and, ere the heavy guar- dians could turn around to see who of the many spec- tators was teasing and worrying the bird, his feathers were dreadfully plucked, and the poor thing left with exposed claws and crooked bill to the keen ridicule of the by-standers. On the 1st of November,-when the Stamp Act was to go into effect, most of the bales of stamped paper, kindly sent out to emblazon colonial writings, had either been destroyed'or shipped back to their parlia-- mentary manufacturers. Colonial pluck'went further. It agreed upon total abstinence from everything for- eign-made, until the Stamp Act should be repealed. In 1766, after hot debate, the Stamp Act was repealed \   FIRST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHRSF,. 245 by the British Parliament; but not before its opffen- sive sting was pulled out and pettishy thrown across the water in the form of a resolution, declaring the'right of the London law manufactory  to- tax the Colonies whenever they wanted any money. The old circumlocution office had neither learned? how to do it, nor how graciously or gracefully to leave off attempts which had resulted in not doing it. During the year following, 1767, came another bill, with a still larger fowl behind it, a curious, sleepy- eyed, dove-colored bird, with prehensile claws admi, rably sheathed when not taking hold, but very strong when its real strength was tested. This bill was to tax glass, paper, painters' colors, and tea. More colonial pluck, -.. more total abstinence,-- more brisk talk between governors and Icolonial legis- latures, more effervescing revolutions produced by patriotic acids and alkalies stirred by newly cut-sticks, - more courteous shows of loyalty and equally firm, resolute, belligerent acts. The colonial grievances were gathering into prepara- tions and generating motive-power to start the revolu- tionary wheel. At Boston, in March, 1770, the first blood was shed. The ink of the Boston "News-Letter," which was still published, seemed to have turned red, and was beginning to be let out.   All duties were now re- pealed,; except those on tea. The- old sting was- thus -again left, and the colonial face, into which it thrust' its tiny hornet spear, began to- swell and inflame. Preparations were now made to drive back the Englisl' bees which were now seen to come over in i.    246 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ,swarms, and to settle down around Boston and other tender "spots. Congress-that academy of celebrated American state doctors-was called for in Septenm- ber, 1774, to apply poultices and such other remedies as they deemed best to the inflamed parts. After much consultation together, feeling the patient's pulse and testing his vitality, they became convinced tl:at they had to deal-with one of those surgical cases which are quoted often afterwards as leading, and for the successful. operation in which careful preparations must be made.         . The military revolutionary wheel was at length set in motion. It. had' thirteen spokes, made of various kinds of wood, all unseasoned; but they were, after a little patient effort, compactly and well fitted into the hub. A patriotic band, put around its periphery, held the wheel together, and enabled it to work successfully many years, and to endure the strains and jars of colo- nial revolutionary wagoning. It is noteworthy that the first formal demonstration in the war, was the despatch by the British com- mander, Gage, April 18, 1775, of eight hundred men to destroy some colonial stores at Concord, - an irruption into the very temple of peace itself. At Lexington, i half-way to their destination, this detachment was met by some seventy provincial volunteers, who entered a bayonet protest against this breach of the peace; but this mild protestation was answered by a sharp, crack- ling retort, which was heard all through the Colonies, It was the mot de resistance. The protesters retired, and the detachment, riding eight miles further, to the Emerson-ian city, scattered the ammunition and food Emerson                 0   FIRST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY W-HEEL. 247 t  -' ' yi ,,-    248 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.  there, and rode back again to Boston, being quickened on ther way by fowling-pieces and duck-guns, dis- charged at the red-breasted coveys. On hearing the news of the battle of Lexington, Ethan Allen, gather- ing together a party of Green Mountain boys, present- ed himself on the evening of May 10, 1775, before the sleepy, dozy doors of Fort Ticonderoga, which were knocked open, and its commandant, De La Plaine, knocked up by a summons to surrender in the name of the great Jehovah and the Continental Congress. The success of this little surprise party was much talked of, and raised more spirits than the revenue acts. Within Boston all of Gage's forces, numbering thriee thousand English, Scotch, and Irish regulars, with many hired Hessians and Waldeckers, now re- tired; while twenty thousand very irregulars, farmers' boys, and mechanics, with John Stark in his bear-skin coat, Israel Putnam in leather apron, and other leaders, drawn by centripetal patriotism from their ill-supplied homes, and in such accoutrements as old family chests yielded up, assembled in a tumultuous crowd at the American camp, and formed a weak line around the land side of the city. While this cord was thus stretched on the weak side of Boston, -if, indeed, she ever had a weak side,-George Washington, theni forty-three years old, hitherto pursuing the double business of farmer and surveyor, overlaying both ever with the cultured ease and polish of a high-bred gen- tleman, already known to military men on both sides the sea by his practical capacity in their science, evinced in Braddock's march and defeat, confessedly   FIRST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. 249 a large-headed, well-balanced, wise man, and of in- tense personal courage and patriotism, was, on the, 17th June, 1775, appointed Commander-in-Chief. No statelier figure than his-- over six feet in height as it was, and cased ordinarily in large, roomy buckskin trousers, a handsomely fitting blue cdat and buff vest -was seen at any time in the American camp for the next eight years. About the same time the British troops under Gage were reinforced, until they counted twelve thousand veterans. Gage, however, did not long swing on the military tree, or remain to be shaken from the Boston bough by the Yankee farmers and mechanics. He was superseded by Sir William Howe, who, in a few days after Washington's appointment/landed at Boston, ac- companied by Sir Henry Clinto  and General Bur goyne. Believing that what cometh out of the mouth is more hurtful than what enters it, the American army now seized Boston Neck tightly. -This contraction produced some spasms in the apoplectic-looking, newly arrived Englishmen, who moved galvanically towards Bunker's Hill, on, the opposite side of the city. To this point Colonel Prescott, with one thousand men,- including some negroes, -was despatched; and here, as is well known, he and Warren and- their little party-colored regiment did such things, June 17,1775, t6 General Howe and his three thousand attacking men, reinforced by Clinton during the day, as have been deemed worthy of much speaking about ever since. The brow of Bunker Hill received that day, where "1*           -  ,     -   250 THE- COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. 'Warren and others fell, a scar which not eventhe hard monumental patch since imposed upon it can make us wish to forget. Higher praise of that scar we cannot accumulate. While these patriotic doings were going on around Boston, movements equally patriotic were- pushed for- ward in an entirely new quarter, - movements, in fact, which resulted in hiring the coachman of the Sim to drive for the future an American emigrant wagon- train, in company with the old, Western solar line. Daniel Boone, then in his forty-fifth year, havinog four years before blazed a-way with his rifle through the woods from North Carolina across the Cumberland Mountains to the river of the same name, led out in May, 1775, a boon company, founding a Colony on the Kentucky River, at first called Transylvania, but which subsequently threw off, with its hunting-shirt, this long Latinized cognomen, and stood at the dewy font to receive the dear old name of Kentucky. The little Colony started on good wholesome diet, -relig- ious toleration; representatives elected by the peo- ple, from the people, for the people; and taxation only by theirl own representatives. Sheltered by its seclusion from the now daily swelling insurrection on the Atlantic coasts, the riflemen's settlement grew apace, picking up its flints from the primeval rocks -which propped up the neighboring Alleghany range, but pecking them for use only upon abundant game that hovered over its dinner-pots and sauce-pans, ready to drop into them at proper signals. In July, 1775, Washington went on to Cambridge and took charge of the Continental forces. These   v  -- -  FASiT TURN OlF THE REVOLUTIONARY WIED.  25,1 I r r   \  s   :252 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UX!TED STATES. forces -were, it is well' known, about as unmanageable as those at work in volcanic mountains, sometimes making- an ominous rumbling, sometimes erupting awkwardly for the peace of others near them, and oc- casionally discharging themselves most inconveniently for those-whose duty it was to watch them. The hot patriotic principles, however, of these raw, unscored militia materials helped essentially the warm endeav- ors of Washington, Gates, Ward, and Lee to season them into tough disciplined, serviceable timber, and so to support loads and resist strains. In a few months even the most unpromising sticks were dry enough to be piled up around Boston, and thus to burn out General Howe.  Following. the old colonial habit of casting sheep's- eyes upon Canada whenever the dogs of war were unkennelled, that shepherd dog, Ethan Allen, scented game- at Crown Point, on the western side of Lake Champlain. Bounding away in long leaps, without a whine or a howl td6 indicate his purpose or direction, he suddenly sprang upon the British flocks quietly feeding there, and effectually penned and secured them. Hardly stopping to be petted for this exploit, the brave colly tore off, with only a small pack of eighty, to Montreal; but the British keepers there, apprised of his approach, managed, as he came up near the folds, to seize him, put a collar around his neck, and to send him to England, where, however, he never would hunt with the royal pack. General Montgomery was more fortunate; for within a month after, having taken St. John's and Fort Chambly,-he followed the footprints of Allen,   FIRST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHRL,. 253  and captured Montreal. Leaving about two hundred troops in that island city, - now the crowning jewel in the Anglo-American stomacher,- he pushed-down the St. Lawrence, and at a point twenty miles above Quebec, absorbing the detachment of six' hundred men led by the bold, dashibg, unprincipled Arnold, he advanced upon the citadel of English America. Here in front of Quebec, after battling the cold for four weeks, the gallant Irishman, on the last day of 1775, amidst a storm  of snow and of pelting iron hail, led : on a vigorous assault against the place where, sixteen years before, in company with the brave Wolfe, he had gathered the bright laurels of victory, unmixed, as was not his commander's,-- with the gloomy cypress. Now the cypress was all that he was destined to grasp from the grim  rock which resented a second capture by the same mortal. He fell, however, as those fall who do more than achieve success, --deserving it. Under the portico-of St. Paul's Church, in the city of New York, at the con- fluence of those pulsing streams of life which surge down Broadway and the Bowery, -  gathering a volume sufficiently strong to overcome the heavy whirlpools of Wall Street,- lie what of Richard Montgomery was mortal, borne thither sixty-three years after'his death by his grateful fellow-citizens, who have -laid on the island of Manhattan, now glittering with superb edi- fices, no corner-stone nobler or more imperishable than that which they then deposited. , The   Revolutionary wheel had now fairly started, :and one of the first results of its motion was the shak- ing off those dusty particles, the royal -governors,-             254 -T-HE COMC HSTORY OF ,THE UNrTEU STATES. Dunmore, in Virginia; Lord William Campbell, in South Carolina; Sir Joseph Wright, in Georgia; and others,- each of whom, measuring his own weight on his own scales, fancied- as we now can read in their despatches to the Colonial Office that he was him- self a stone large enough, if dropped in front of the wheel, to stop forever its further advance. The Hessian bees, shaken off the home twigs by their owners, the fussy, poverty-ridden dukes, princes, landgraves, and margraves, swarmed over and settled at Boston on the oaken boughs planted there by Lord Howe. George Washington was determined to make a vigorous effort to. break up the hive and to get its military honey. In March, 1776, he drew near to Boston, sitting down on Dorchester Heights with an earth curtain before him, to guard against the stings of any vagrants that might stray away from the main ;:swarm. Scarcely, however, had our general, in his buckskin breeches, begun to' feel around the nest, before, to his great surprise, and to the infinite won- derment of George III., and his minister, Lord North, the entire swarm with a peculiar buzz, rose at four o'clock in the morning from their new-made hive and flew away in a .bee-line for Halifax. Much : honey, then particularly dear to Americans, was gathered after they left; as' much as two hundred and fifty combs, in the shape of cannon, and not a& little of that bee dust, so very scarce in March, 1776,' called powder. Washington was much concerned lest the pesky swarm might turn their flight and settle down in New York. So, after attending a lecture the night following his entrance into Boston,in order not   FIRST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL.  255 to excite by his absence any hubbub in that literary and then religious place, he set in motion the great body of his troops towards the island of Manhattan. Major-General Charles Lee, a Welshman by birth, and a soldier of fortune, who had fought in Portugal and Poland, mettlesome and waspish in temper, was despatched in April with other troops to New York, where, after a neck-and-neck race with Sir Henry Clinton, accompanied by a large British force from England, he arrived only-two hours before his com- petitor. Sir Henry, although anxiously expected on shore by several British friends, at length concluded that it was too early in the season to. alight so far north, and so cruised southward for a milder climate and reception. Sailing leisurely down  our wave- dented shores, he joined the squadron of his old boon companions in arms, Admiral Sir Peter Parker and Earl Cornwallis, with some two thousand five hundred jolly dogs, hired at fourpence a day to come out- and inspect our country. Strolling on together pleasantly in a warm latitude, with flying-fish to amuse them on the outside, and broiled fish inside the ships, they touched land at last near Charleston. The restless, waspish Lee, who had been also flying down south- ,wards over the land, hovering on quick wing and watch- ing the jolly dogs to - see where they would come ashore, no sooner found that they thought of landing at Sullivan's Island, and visiting a military summer- house there, built of palmetto wood, and called Fort Moultrie, than he lit upon them, stung two hundred of them more or less uncomfortably, and compelled' them all to go off wholly from that place, the pleasure   256 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. of reaching which depends so much upon the feelings of those to whom the visit is proposed. New England and the South were now alike freed, from British tourists and German musket-holders. Where Sir Henry and his jolly dogs, constituting one party, and Lord Howe with his lively squad, still enjoying themselves at Halifax after their rapid jour- ney from Boston, making up the other British set, would next prospect, much concerned the Continental Congress, George Washington, Charles Lee, and the colonial people generally. The uncertainty was soon ended. Lord Howe, sailing from Halifax, June 11th, reached Sandy Hook on the 25th of the same month, and dropping anchor off Staten Island, July 2d, was soon joined by Sir Henry and his jolly dogs, feeling a little uneasy of stomach, and somewhat less merry- than when. they left England nearly three months before, and vowing, 'pon honor, that Sir Henry had somewhat taken them in at Charleston, although, in fact, the real trouble was that he had not taken them in at all there. Truly the Revolutionary wheel was now well started, and began to get in earnest motion.   CHAPTER II. JULY FOURTH, 1776, AND SO FORTH.

The way was beset with obstruc- tions, - heaps of coal and fossil remains, - and strewn with bones of races, human and animal, as strange even to our museums as they were novel to ourselves. Among these freshy discovered relics of our great an- cestors, we trode carefully, and lingered with pleased wonder among ruins, which shamed by their age and size the usurping glories of Egyptian, Chinese, and As- syrian antiquities. At last, however, having traversed those broad plains, over which hung the gray, uncer- tain twilight of chronicle and geological fiction, we emerged, by a sudden turn in the road, into the clearer ;ight and more solid undebatable ground rediscovered and retouched bymore modern nations; convinced by our large inspection and survey, that those who landed on our shores long before Columbus - the Cabots, Cortereals, Verrazannis, Vespuccis, etc. - had, like provident patres familias, packed carefully away large stores of carbonized fuel and bone manure for the use of those who should come behind and after them, and had left well-feathered nests for the more helpless brood which might flock here in times long subsequent to their own. Refreshed from the fatigues of this long wandering tramp, we then took a fresh start 304 years ago from Sainte Augustine, plodded on northwards forty-eight years to Jamestown, in six years more passed the little group of Dutch cabins on Manhattan island, and so, trending off eastward, followed the wavy coast for eight   JULY FOURTH, 1776, AND, SO ORTa.   259 2 9  260 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. years more, until we brought up, in 1620, at the newly erected temperance inn at Plymouth, where we halted, glad even of its scant and unpromising cheer. Very early after leaving the James, we: were accosted by that well-known Wag, John Smith, who turned up in high, feather with Pocahontas, - the future mother of Vir- ginia, -and who keeps turning sup and down every- where in all humors, moods, and tenses, -active, pas-+ sive, transitive, and intransitive, - to suit and amuse every taste.          . Mile-stone after mile-stone has been left behind us., We have been hindered by Indian ambushes along the wayside, and have been obliged often to pick out arrows shot into our covered emigrant-wagon, as we have toiled up and over the New England hills, through the Mohawk Valley, and along' the broad bottom-lands of Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas. French gentlemen with pleasant manners have often stopped us at cross-roads, and attempted by very sharp arguments to convince us that we were on the wrong track. Several large parties of these Gallic gentle- men, at various narrow parts of the way, especially in 1689, 1710, 1745, and notably for nine consecutive years from 1754 to 1763, have warned us back, and in- deed endeavored to turn us entirely off the road, claim- ing that it was a private one of their own. But past all these have we succeeded in pushing our historic journey, shunning the miry places left open by colo- nial negligence, the shaky bridges full of witch holes, the badly mended ruts of religious bigotry, and the rough patches of corduroy posts, laid crosswise over trembling, low-lying swamps of political scheming and   JULY FOURTH, 1776, AND SO FORTH.  - 261  'financial speculation. Here and there we have found bits of plank road, laboriously and ambitiously placed    over the public highway in front of colleges, school-  houses, churches, and occasionally through pleasant  thrifty villages.                     ii Now and then we have ascended, after much patient up-hill work, to large, noble sumnmits of civil or re-  ligious freedom, commanding wide horizons and broad  views; but often, too, have we felt a sinking of spir- its,a saddening depression, as we have been compelled& to descend to lower levels and to jog along -again over wearisome flats.              .!4 We have been detained occasionally by civil-spoken  English governors and royal councillors, who have per- suaded us to alight and partake of their cheer, which,  it must be admitteld, was much better than that which we obtained along the common road; but well know-      8 ing that it had never been honestly paid for or justly   i earned, we sheuld have, found it more palatable had it been thus properly seasoned. Landed proprietors,}  with smooth, royal manners, have, also, sometimes stopped us to state little points of difference between-  ,Ii: themselves and their North American tenants. ,i Several times have we crossed the Atlantic together    a for the purpose of obtaining certain information about   i the colonial ways,? rights, manners, customs, and cos-   ;it' tumes, which could only be cleared up \by papers      i which had been either accidentally or carelessly left be- i I  hind when the first emigrants packed their chests with    the prime necessaries for subsistence on their briny    ii journey. As we returned and again resumed our land' travels, we had only proceeded a .short distance before ,'  *-   262. THE COMC HSTORY- OF THE UNITED STATES. we were stopped by unceremonious and hard-visaged Europeannnhighwaymen, French, Dutch, and English, with whom we have had stout fights, to prevent the party which we were convoying from being captured, plundered, and carried off to foreign lands. But, thanks to- a kind Providence and the strong arms and plucky vigor of the brave chaps inside the wagon, we have been able to disperse these banditti. Two of them, however, as we have just noted, escaping from those lesser en- counters, entered formally into a set contest with each other for the championship. and custody of our his- torical party,- a contest which came off a few rods from the top of the hill, and which we halted to wit- ness. At last, however, we have reached the summit of the great pass,-the high beacon-point of American history,--where  the sleepless, vigilant eagle sits screaming, while his strong, horny claws grasp the flag-staff, from whose top the flag of the married em- pires is anxiously ready, day and night, to slap in its saucy, quarrelsome face every wind that whispers a provocation. Here, on this elevated plateau, we colne suddenly upon a   very nice party of picturesquely dressed, intelligent, earnest, and thoughtful gentlemen looking like a large gathering of state midwives, called together to consider a  most important, impending family event. Let us take  breath for a few moments after our long ascent, and look more carefully at this noteworthy group. It' is the 4th of July,--always a  very hot day,; and yet, although the weather is characteristic, and there is very warm work ahead, all the party,-  *    '   JULX r4UUKtLJd- 1770, AADU bV Aofr. L- ap numbering that day fifty-one persons- seem, with    ? few exceptions, to be very cool and unheated. They are quite unconcerned about the thunder-storm, sig-  nailed by white caps fringing the black heads which crowd the eastern horizon beyond the Atlantic, and   I which has shaken from its heavy locks leaden pow-   ,  der, which has sprinkled the exposed plantations, Breed's Hill, Concord, Lexington, Ticonderoga, Crown1 Point, and Long Island, and even shaken its disastrous , dust upon Quebec and Montreal.  This notable group is sometimes called the Second Continental Congress. "Remarkable in looks and marked men are nearly all of the persons there gathered,-  remarkable for their average youth, as most of the  members became equally famous for great age,-      i remarkable, too, in a majority of the whole number,  for handsome features and intellectual presence, for "their aptitude for, and ready proficiency in, the then very mysterious and royal business of statecraft, law-  making, and army-raising, for, their thoughtful air and high-bred bearing, and their readiness in argument,  logic,'and knowledge of human rights and human na-   i! ture; marked by the heavy Hanoverian displeasure of  George III., of the aristocratic Frederic, Lord: North,  his minister, and of Sir William Howe, his military   ( generalissimo in the Colonies. Many of them, too,    :i were -marked by heads so peculiar that the three Eng- lish gentlemen just named became very desirous -of  having them to put into the English State Museum,    j and even went so far as to offer heavy sterling rewards for any one who would secure them.            i -One of these. heads immediately arrests our attenI "i   264 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. tion. It is very handsome, and is set upon a fine, tall, gentlemanly figure,- both owned by one John Han- cock from Boston, only thirty-nine years of age, of large wealth for those simple days honorably acquired by trade, of manners conspicuously high-bred, and with a soul that, like a. lamp burning inside an alabaster vase, illumninates the beautiful characters which the highest culture has traced and wrought. Two years ago, when Boston was patiently biding the expected period of English-justice, triumphing over a short- sighted selfishness, and was carrying, as best she might, meanwhile, the cruelburdens of the Boston Port Bill, and when General Gage was sent out to see that she did not cut the straps, shift the load,eor escape its, grievous weight, John Hancock,- who the evening before had rallied with soul-lifting eloquence his fellow-sufferers at Faneuil Hall to the unjustly impose'd duty of throwing off the crushing load, -rode at the head of his Boston' Cadets, to bear with restrained courtesy from the Long Wharf to the State House this hard plum from the royal enclosure, - a Gage that he was careful not to pluck, but to preserve until it was fully ripe. Among this group he sits on a raised seat, and acts as president. A few gentlemen, more advanced in years than the rest, are sprinkled through the company. One, an old acquaintance of ours, the boy who in 1721 fur- nished through the "New England Courant" such strong food for even Boston, and afterwards set up an intellectual bakery at Philadelphia, now seventy years old, rests his massive benevolent figure in a chair made comfortable by his presence,-his broad rild face, so    JULY FOURTH, 1776, AND SO FORTH.     2651 largely serene, framed in by flowing soft locks, and beaming with a placid composure, as if the plough- share of hard work had not turned a furrow there. He looks as if he could forgive George III. for his narrow notions, wedged inextricably fast in his narrow brain, and even his sallow, bilious, meadow-bottomed, Hano- verian dulness, dripping in pestilent, unhealthy oozings through his slow liver into his slower understanding. Well does the serenely fronted old sage know all the importance and the character of the business in hand. His clear, philosophic mind has weighed in its calm well-adjusted balances the questions now  to be de- cided.  He has but lately escaped from- England, where, as agent for the Colonies, he was watched and treated by the government with incised and rigorous dislike; yet, as a man and thinker, he was there wel- comed by the best men and most advanced statesmen. Vith Pitt, Camden, Burke, Charles James Fox, aad even Lord North, he met, and with calm, compact, sensi- ble, logical eloquence discussed the nature of the prin- ciples, alike dangerous in England as in the Colonies, which the Ministry, in the name of the former, were seeking to fasten, as the shirt of Nessus, upon the lat- ter. While on his ungracious mission, he had, also, encountered that ponderous, fact-clad, political Goliath, Samuel Johnson, who had lately; stepped forth in front of the ministerial Philistines, and defied any  one to prove that taxation of a people unrepresented was tyranny.  In    that encounter, the American, armed only with a simple Quaker sling, planted in the giant's -head a stone harder even than itself, and very uncom- fortable therein. Few now were Franklin's words; but 12     266 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. each one weighed ten pounds, and though perhaps homely in shape and unrounded at the angles, when hurled out by an honest heart-force, they crashed resist- lessly through all the fences and thickets of sophis- try or learned show. Having to manage those two difficult problems in the political economy which then crowded up for solu- tion, namely, how to raise a revenue out of 2,800,000 poor colonists, which, in weight, should put it in equi- poise with .the heavy stacks of English pounds ster- ling; and how to make 7,754 soldiers, constituting, as Washington 'had that very morning reported from head-quarters, the entire colonial army, successfully oppose 28,000 English and 17,000 Hessian troops, this American Witenagemote had conscious need of all poor Richard's solid, homespun sense and wise-headed prudence and resource. But the grand old man, who by virtuous kiting had obtained naturally lightning out of heaven by an easy discount, was equal to the task of drawing credit out of the well-soiled banks of, his country. On a ring, circling his forefinger, and given him by an ardent friend, one may- by a near inspection, when the large head leans against his right hand- see carved that motto, which is his condensed biography, "Eripuit ccelo fulmen, sceptrumque tyrannis." A little way off stands a tall, scholarly figure, care- fully dressed in the gentlemanly costume of that time, a blue coat faced with yellow, a scarlet waistcoat para- graphing an elaborate shirt-frill, and black broadcloth tights, clasped at the knee, and, like his own round   JULY FOURTH, 1776, AND SO FORTH.   267 periods, closed by polished silver-tongued buckles.

Chairman of a committeeI to report on the question of the right of the Colonies  I to be hereafter independent of Great Britain; he holds  in his womanly-shaped hands a large manuscript writ- ten in neat, careful characters.            !9 Close to him   stands the short, firm, square, con-   densed-looking figure of John Adams, coaxed into a well-ripened fulness. He is ten years older than Jef- ferson; destined to be his generous rival through an   j  eventful life, and to die only a few hours after him, just- fifty years from that time, and on the'semi-centennial anniversary of that very day. There is a good-natured ^ frankness in his round, generously blooded face, and full-veined forehead; great firmness in his well-pressed [ii' lips; and about his massive head a solid, intellectual  strength that have already well earned for him the    'i1 appellation of "the column of Congress."

He is a ripe scholar, edu-1} ated in an English university, and yet warm with a A     \     '!   268 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. loving nature that glows on his' face and through his graceful discourse. Wielding a ready pen, whose vigor- ous strokes have already, in the Memorial of Congress to British America, cleft the unwilling hearts of Cana- dians, and, in The Address of Congress to the People of Great Britain, have imbedded forever in the English Constitution the principles of representation as the basis of taxation, Richard Henry Lee, from South Caro- lina, three years older than Adams, sits there in cul- tured ease 'and thoughtful dignity, a modelslegislator. In the preceding month of June he had moved a reso- lution, asserting the rights of the Colonies to be free, and to dissolve in brine the ligaments which wickedly tied them to the money-making law manufactory at home. This resolution, having of course been well debated when it came up for consideration three days ago,- for American Congresses were never deaf or dumb asylums,--had been adopted, and upon it a committee raised, whose report, drawn by Jefferson, and revised by Franklin and Adams, is to be read in to-day's session. A few feet away are Edward Rutledge of South Carolina, who, although only in his twenty-third sum- mer, is laden with the sheaves of a rich harvest of oratorical fame; Charles Carroll of Maryland, who, an- nexing to the Declaration his address, so that he might not be-passed by the state executioner for his treason, was spared by death to be the last of that memorable party on earth; Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, who lived to fill acceptably every honorable office known to our system of government, except that of President; and Robert R. Livingston of New York, who survived   JULY FOURTH, 1776, AND SO FORTH.    269 the recordership of the city of New York, and became  eminent, not only in many fields, but notably on the Hudson River, in connection with Robert Fulton's ef-, forts to subject water to steam,-not one' of them, except Carroll, yet thirty-three years of age.       i Leaning forward and near this last group stands the bulky figure of one who was for the first twenty-two  years of his life a shoemaker; but who, disregarding    Ret the maximn of Horace " to, stick to the last," left the lapstone to attend to the understandings of his suf-  fering countrymen. This, all know, is Roger Sherman  :  1 of Connecticut, true to independence and well-grounded   . freedom - to the last.                   i Across the room   stand talking together George  Wythe of Virginia, sweet-tempered, frolicsome as a      boy, yet resolute of purpose, able in debate, and capa- ble of deep research; Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, born in England, an emigrant to Philadelphia in his     1 thirteenth year, whose nature of sterling- British oak, ,  : seasoned in the counting-house of Charles Willing, and  whose solid aptitudes, hardened into financial wisdom,   ! were now so much needed in the new political part- nership of States; and Joseph Reed from the same  State, whose sturdy, honest face seems to light up a     I large space all around him, and whose rebuke two years later to the commissioner of Lord North, who      t sought to bribe him, that 'poor as he was, the king of : Great Britian was not rich enough to buy him," raised  American securities as high in Europe as the practical    ; answers of some of his congressional, successors to     ji;i imilar attempts on their financial virtue by North -or    i South, East or West, have depressed them.          it ' t'   270 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. Others there are among those twoscore and eleven whom iwe should be glad to delineate, as we dearly love to look at them gathered in the morning light of that first Fourth of July; but there is such a serious, thoughtful air, such a felt pressure weighting all brows and hearts, that the loaded hour presses down and hushes all such light thoughts. A prayer so simple, earnest, child-like, and trusting,-uttered amid im- pressive silence by John Adams, - that it seems to bear the great question up to the Great Heart, hushes the assembly to a balanced calm, and opens the busi- , ess. Large sealed packages from Washington, brought on horseback all the way from New York, are then read. They speak of his few men,  most of them without arms, clothing, or food, - in presence of 45,000 fresh and well-supplied English and German troops,- under- the commhand -of Lord Howe, of his brother the Ad- miral, and of Sir Henry Clinton. Other letters were read from. -South Carolina, Georgia, - Maryland, and New York, urging the wise men to declare the old, un- equal partnership with England at an end,- a part- nership to which, they felt, that the colonial partners had furnished the capital and labor, and from which the English associates drew all the profits. In the name of the Profit, they virtually said, war. Then followed a pause in the proceedings, which at length the full, firm voice of John Adams broke. His speech, rising and rising like a freshet over that tall occasion, swept away by its resistless logical momen- tum the forces of sophism, carried in its strong hurry all the impediments to its march, brimmed over with  ,   JULY FOURTH, 1776, AND SO FORTH.    271 its swelling forces the whole territory of debate, until1 at last, the gathered mass, hurled full against the  barriers of prejudice, conservatism, doubt, and fear, prostrated forever the props and supports of British  usurpation in the Colonies. It is a singular fact that  no reporters were present to take down or even out- line this speech. Gathered up, however, from  tradi- tion and memory by Daniel Webster, about half a cen- tury afterwards, it has floated and collected in almost  every school-house and college, and there formed ed-   !:' dies, whirlpools, and geysers, which have sucked in and spouted out much gyrating declamation.  Other speakers followed the fiery Adams, most urg ing, a few deprecating, immediate action. We need      i! not note here their range, fire, or effect.  At last the patriotic battle abates; and the com-I mittee of five,- Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Sherman,  ;:1i and Livingston, -forming around   the tall, dignified,  picturesque figure of their chairman, advance in front  of the president's seat. There is an expectant, oppres-  sive hush, a  sudden settling back into seats; and allI I eyes, like sunflowers, turn towards the scarlet-waist-   J coated son of the Revolution.  The neatly written pa-   .ii per is slowly unrolled, and its weighty truths, crowding  up to its very rim, begin at once to discharge them-  selves.  That large electrical battery has been ever since at iA york, charging nationalities and  peoples, galvanizing ,  1 he feeble to effort, producing  sparks whenever -the   Il; urrent has been interrupted, recovering back to vital    I ction sick communities, and arousing to better health   .  rom that hopeless despair which   a long course of -' * . -*       i i   272 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. royal quack doctoring had produced, constitutions, sys- tems,;or states originally strong, energetic, and vigorous. Without analyzing or dwelling upon the full, electrical streams then and there evolved by that American inde- pendence machine, we will only record here that two principal jets, namely, that of the equality of all in their creation, and the other, that all governments rest solely upon the consent of the governed, have poured upon paralyzed and crippled humanity such a current of blessings, that the old Asiatic, African, and European practices of blood-letting for liberal pleth- ora, drugs for congested rights, anodynes for con- sciences politically discontented, and 'cathartics for purging away healthy food necessary for civil nutri- tion, are fast becoming unpopular. George III. got a terrible peppering from that ma- chine; but as he lived forty-four years afterwards, it is fair to presume that his royal, burly Hanoverian person, rolling over and over in bucolic clover, repaired with- out difficulty dents and shocks caused by applications administered at such a distance. For seven years fol- lowing he was in a great state of irritation, and worked hard to prevent the results with which that Declara- tion concluded, namely, a determination to cut all connection with him and his little island ways. How this great struggle, thus earnestly begun, was carried' on, and its final issue, must be the office of future chapters to tell. That first Fourth caused a very gunpowdery smell throughout the Colonies for seven succeeding years, and has touched off more fire-crackers *since than would fence in China with a wall higher than its present one.

These glorious dinners have been, also, the nurseries of the legal- profession, whose young members have thence sent up whizzing sky-rockets, which, mounting and mounting on the straining enthusiastic eye, have burst into such dissolving showers of golden glory, that, by the unexpected explosion, the national horizon and their own have been widened on all sides, and new stars been stuck into its astonished vault. We pity the American who has been born into our degenerating times, which neglect those primitive occa- sions of cheap yet great renown, when a little sulphur, administered to a rural population, went further to cure all the scarlet fever of the neighborhood than all the colic-producing iron pills of actual war. We com- miserate the condition of the young American, grown so apoplectic ere he arrives of age, by the prodigal dis- play of bunting, fire-works, and red-faced oratory at our frequent elections, that he disdains the frugal but satisfying cakes of gingerbread, then bought with a well-pressed sixpence from the calico-roofed booth on the side of the bars, through which those undulating militia lines managed to unwind without hanging on the fence or getting into puzzling knots.

Lord Howe, from Halifax; Sir. Henry Clinton, from Charleston;. and Admiral Howe, from England, drawn together by focalizing orders, settled down with their separate flocks on- Staten Island, - one of the lintels of the gateway to the metropolis,--numbering to- gether twenty-four thousand old hawks which had often whetted their beaks before in Spanish, German, and Dutch blood. Washington had about seventeen thousand agricul- tural lads, armed with every possible and impossible accoutrement, contrivance, and weapon, to watch the well-trained brood. Lord Howe, being a royal conm-l- missioner as well as a general, understood letter-writ-- ing well; and his first care was to pen an epistle to the American commander. Upon its composition he bestowed as much care as a young man upon his first letter to the coy damsel whom he would conciliate; but upon the address he spent far greater pains. As despatched, it read "George Washington, Esquire." Carried to the General, he declined to receive it. Not that he was not an "Esq.," for all Americans are born such of course; but being a Squire in a military court whose proceedings were likely to be recorded, he conceived himself to be entitled to different honors.   SECOND TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY. WHEEL. 279 Defeated in his pen addresses, the British general tried another stroke. On the 22d of August, 1776, landing on Long Island, he commenced a march by three separate detachments towards Brooklyn, which, after a severe battle on the 27th of August, he took. It was the first invasion by the Germane of that quiet, pleasant, New. York dormitory.   Then the in abitants took it very d. Now, however, they have become so much accustomed to the German irruptions, that they have ceased to be astonished at their own frequent captures. We may add that the Hessians did not at that time elect Herr Martin Kalb- fleisch mayor of Brooklyn. They waited nearly ninety years, and then returned, not to their mutton, but to  i their veal.                      :i The gathering in of one thousand dead and wounded from  the Long Island hills was not the kind of har-  vesting that the agricultural lads expected; :and as they had only engaged for a short job, many of them  went back on the 28th to their own farms. Wash-     : ington not liking to be sandwiched with the rest of his forces, numbering some fourteen thousand, between Howe's Germans and the East River, contrived dur- .  ing the misty night of the 29th of August- to get over the river to New  York, - an exploit much vaunted then among military men, but rendered very easy in    i our time by the Union Ferry Company's boats.  The country recruits who are now transported every Sun- day across the same river to Beecher's church, when there again transported, and after the service trans- ported back again, show what changes haveloccurred in the facilities for moving large bodies of men over the East River since the battle of Long Island.   280 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, Howe's Hessians threatening to emigrate en masse to, New York, General Washington, on the 10th of September, made room for them by taking his young army to the upper part of Manhattan Island, giving them an opportunity to see the rustic beauties of Harlem and the country around the present High Bridge. As it sometimes happens in war, as well as in peace, that different gentlemen take a fancy to the same piece of ground whose possession and value are enhanced thereby, GMneral Howe's desire to become possessed of the same real estate in the actual occu- pation of Washington, reached such a pitch that he -'sent a large party of military friends to seize it, even if by so doing they were obliged to dispossess its occupant. The friends of the Squire, however, re- sented this violent attempt so spiritedly that, as it has - often fallen out since, the visitors to Harlem went back to New York with very red eyes and faces unkindly disfigured. Lord Howe next attempted to get around the Squire by sending a part of his force, now increased to thirty- five thousand men, into the lower district of West- chester to see how Harlem and the Continentals looked from the rear, and the other part on a lively picnic up the Hudson River; but the wary leader of the Americans had seen, when surveying or hunt- ingg in Virginia and Ohio, too many traps set by In- dians and white trappers to be caught between the steel jaws of this English one. So he pulled his men away from the cautiously planted contrivance and took them several miles to the northeast, on the Bronx River. He allowed several of them, however, to go   A SECOND-TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. 281    up to White Plains, where, to his chagrin, -hey were set upon by a large British party and very disagreea- bly handled.  General Washington now scattered his force all along the Hudson River from the city of New York    i up as high as Peekskill, his camp soups giving off a flavor into Anthony's nose. Some of the water used '- in cooking and drinking was dipped from the Croton River. Thus early was the Croton put into American   : service. At that time, we may add, the fluid was employed to qualify and reduce the whiskey; now the whiskey is thought to be weaJ: enough to qualify and reduce the water. Ninety-three years have thus united to furnish the same number of reasons as the ' composing elements, contrary as they may seem to    i each other, for mixing the fire and water. One may , judge of the extent to which the Croton is now used  from the fact that during 1868, the amount of liquors- retailed at the opening throat of the-aqueduct cost  i;t over $150,000,000. We need not add how, during  all this period, fusil-oil went down.-  General Washington in November following -ven-    i tured over into New Jersey, and, like so many from  the New York side since, was having a good time at   j Fort Lee, when a body of Englishmen and Handeckers came down towards them in a very rough way, and- the excursionists thought it prudent to retire, leaving their provender behind them. But for these little surprises, war would lose some of its briskest features. Washington was now compelled to retreat, with num- bers daily dirninishing, before foes superior in num- bers and constantly augmenting as they pursued. In"   282 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. fact, he was obliged to bridge or ford the principal rivers or streams in Northern New Jersey; thus furnish- ing the best precedent which the Camden and Amboy Railroad engineers have ever had for carrying people across New Jersey soil and waters in a bad temper. Newark, New Brunswick, and Princeton fell into the hands of the enemy. Some people assert that they are in them still. December 8, 1776, Washington passed over the Delaware River to cover Philadelphia, which now had much need of a lid, for. it was in a terrible stew. The country lads, as these reverses pressed upon them, took a homesickness which nothing but their mothers and their own homes could cure. Only about three thousand remained, shivering and tentless, and lying near the inhospitable track of the New York and Philadelphia Railroad. Lord Cornwallis but waited for a cold night to bridge over. the Delaware to enable him to take the Squire and his dwindling posse of men. Trenton was the knife-balance of American fate. Upon a nicely poised point it swung tremblingly for a weary, anxious fortnight. General Sullivan, having succeeded the waspish Lee, who was one night captured at a tavern in Bask- ingridge by a party more spirit-ed than his own, led, through the gloomy days of mid-December, a force of four thousand men, provided with ammunition, across the country to Washington. Timely indeed was the reinforcement; for Washington, although just made by a Congressional decree supreme manager of the war, had more need of powder than power.   SECOND TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. 283    . Christmas eve, 1776, was a very jolly one in the British camp. The- commander, officers, and men, all   j thought that the American fiddle was broken and about to be hung up forever; and so, in their-Saxon and Teutonic joy, they hung up their stockings. The shrewd American Squire, borrowing old Santa , Claus's coach and horses, and filling the former with   I bullets and powder, crossed the Delaware about mid- night and suddenly dropped his presents through the camp of his foreign visitors. Never were the Hessians   , so taken by Christmas gifts. In fact, fourteen hun-   , dred of them were so overcome by the novel presence 'I of Washington, that they gave themselves up to American hospitality and followed their new friends ;. across the river to their now merry quarters.       i The American fiddle was mended again; and its      i strains of Yankee Doodle were heard across the Atlan- - tic by a young French marquis, only nineteen years of ,  , age, of a very old family, with a very young wife, and . an income of $40,000 a year,- an income in those      pre-Erie and pre-petroleum times highly respectable.    i Other Frenchmen also listened to, and, like Lafayette, were moved by, the touching airs of freedom, which passed the Rhine also, and were drunk inr with his hock by the Prussian- Steuben, a military martinet and schoolmaster, much needed in our militia school-   IiI house. The Baron was then generalissimo of his se- rene, discomposable highness, the Prince of ichen- zollern-Hechingen, whose magnificent titles would, if   i printed on a straight strip of paper, have easily reached ' i across his principality; but sounding as they were,    '! they did not fill the ear of Steuben like the' notes from',   284 - THE,COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. that repaired fiddle. The lively adagio airs also strucl upon the sensitive vibrating soul of De Kalb, a noblE of Alsace, lifting it to highest impulses, which carriec him through four years of patriotic service, and ever bore him in lofty triumph across the death channel ii 1780, when at the battle of Camden he was -carried away from the daring front, loaded with eleven bullets in various parts of his body. These same free airs fell upon those straight, up- right Poles, Kosciusko and Pulaski, and so vivifying them by warming heats, that through the whole wal they bore most fragrant fruit, until at last they stood as that vintage so ripely planted in Mrs. Browning's verse, "Where the gun with a golden mouth doth blow Blue bubbles of grapes down a vineyard row," - the blue grapes of blistered steel. Even in England 'thousands of hearts warmed to the American* cause. In Parliament, Charles James Fox, Earl (Chatham, Edmund Burke, the virtuous Lord Camden, and others; out of it, David Hume the histo- rian, Edward Gibbon, whose studies of the rise as well as the fall of Rome had led him down into the crypt of history, and countless able; learned, and good, others as true to state as to individual freedom, gave vent and weighty shape to the well-considered convictions of the injustice of the attempt to compel the Colonies to submit to impositionfunassented to by themselves. But while in England there were advocates of colonial freedom, in the Colonies there were friends of Parlia- mentary oppression. These last were infiltrated more or less through all the United settlements; but theygath-   SECOND TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEK L. 285' ered in notable volume in and about the then consid- erable village of New York, - numbering about 26,000 inhabitants,- where all the vigilant zeal of Alexan- der Hamilton, an ardent, eloquent young lawyer, re- cently arrived from his native West Indies, the equally vigorous but cooler patriotism of John Jay, and the alert wisdom of other Sons of Liberty were needed, to make head against the Tory current whose momentum  and velocity, quickened by wealth, social position, and offi- cial experience, swept with force and volumed power through the island city. Rude indeed was the shock given to the Manhattan loyalists by the overthrow in the Bowling Green of the leaden statue of George III., and the conversion of its characteristically heavy metal into lively Continental bullets. The popular repeal of this loyal statue was soon followed in Con- gress by the repeal of more important representatives of royalty, - leaden-typed statutes. The year 1777 opened with the battle of Princeton, fought Under the leadership of Washington and Corn- wallis, whereby two hundred English and Germans were put under sodded trenches, to furnish in after times, -in addition- to their use in well-rounded school-boys' pe- riods, a special resort for the students of Nassau Hall, accompanied by such persuadable female companions - Dutch, American, English, or German-as might relish history studied under the advantageous lights of a pair of admiring eyes. In a few days after this battle, all, New Jersey was cleared of British and Hessians, who dispersed in various directions, and sought to keep up their courage for several succeeding months by raids upon those   286 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. peaceful, drowsy villages, Danbury in Connecticut, and Peekskill on the Hudson, and harrying off some of the delights of a German stomach,--winter apples, cider, and sausages. On the other hand, Colonel Meigs tickled the feet of Long Island one night in May, and touched up some British corns on its Sag Harbor toe, making even the grave Congress to laugh outright in a broad vote of thanks; while Colonel Barton, early one morning in July, took, in spite of his guards, the British Major-General Prescott out of his bed, where he was cuddling up to escape the Rhode Island fogs, and bore him off through--his own troops, and even through a large British fleet lying off the main-land, - a little surprise party highly relished by the visitors and their colonial friends. The arrival in-France, in the autumn of 1776, of Silas Deane, a Connecticut delegate to Congress, and of Benjamin Franllin, -as commissioners, soon raised the gates which had barred French supplies of men and means from flowing into the service of the Colo- nies. Louis XVI. and Vergennes, -his Foreign Min- ister, had neither forgotten the great fight for the American belt, nor the wrench which French pride had suffered by the tossing of the prize, but fifteen years ago, into the eager hands of its uncivil rival. They were, therefore, more than ready to help the ward escape from her self-constituted guardian, and to send her secretly such instruments as would file off her bolts, cut away the prison-like fences around her suspiciously guarded dwelling-place, and enlarge her straitening liberties. Theyhad even, in the spring of 1777, secretly encouraged, while pretending to pre-   SECOND TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHERTL. 287 vent, the armed emigration of Lafayette and others to America. Just about the time that these French gentlemen, with Baron De Kalb, touched foot on American soil at Georgetown, South Carolina, an Englishman named' Burgoyne, whose acquaintance we made at Bunker Hill, two years ago, came on shore at Quebec. Enter- ing the Colonies by that favorite back-stairs, Lake Champlain, he turned the well-known and well-worn knob, Ticonderoga, and got himself, and his attendants fairly inside the American door-yard. Advancing, he came to a small place called Stillwater, where he tripped his toe over a little hillock, called a breast- work, raised by Kosciusko, aided by that crack rifleman, Morgan, and pitched forward faint and weak from this unexpected accident. Still, his English robustness of strength and pluck was such as to make him quite confident of being able to reach, without difficulty, the wing of the house, called Albany,rand thence gaining access to its centre, New York, where he expected to meet Sir William Howe, and with him to succeed in bringing back once more the spirited young American heiress to the selfish love of her late champion. But quite to his surprise he discovered before him, near Saratoga Springs, Gates through which he must pass in order to make any progress, - Gates so strong that, unless he could force their Polish locks, their American hinges, and solid, iron-riveted timbers, he must perish for want of food. The Gates were not passed; and October 17, 1777, he gave himself up, with 5,791 offi- cers and men, and forty-six hundred muskets. Forty two pieces of brass cannon also passed at that time to   288 THE COMC HSTORY^ OF THE UNITED STATES. the Americans, - brass which gave them thenceforward more confidence and cheek. Much need, too, of it had they; for in the preceding two months, Washington, with thirteen thousand men, following Howe and Corn- wallis southward, with a body of eighteen thousand men under their command, met them a few miles south of Philadelphia, on a little, dispirited stream called the Brandywine, and there drank the disagreeable dregs of a defeat, made even more distasteful by the fact that it was the first American drink which Lafay- ette and Pulaski had an opportunity of sipping in this country. Exceedingly nauseated by this drink, they all took another draught October 4th at Germantown; but this decoction proved equally unpalatable.; -It re- quired all the beneficial effects of the Saratoga water to correct the disturbed action produced by the Brandy- wine and the Germantown potion. The fury of George III. at the close of the cam- paign of 1-777 was perfectly Hanoverian. He had been led to expect the speedy submission of the Colonies; but he had reluctantly discovered that early disasters had only stiffened the gristle of discontent into the bone of unconquerable resistance.  His obstinacy, however, in prosecuting the war was met by equal firmness on the part of the Colonies in defending their rights. If, like one of his predecessors, who, irritated by the resistance of Scotland to his royal wishes, threatened to make that country a royal hunting- ground, George III. threatened to make a shooting- park of North America, the colonists, in the spirit of the Scottish nobleman who, in reply to the menace, answered, "In that case, may it please your Majesty, I   SECOND TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. 289 must be home to uncouple the hounds," were fully determined to muzzle the royal pack, and to increase their own war-dogs. Parliament, however, curbed by the strong arm\ of popular sentiment, found it best to hold in check the royal passion and resentment. It even slipped fro'n the leash, not the savage bloodhounds of strife, but' three very sleek-looking house-pets, called Peace C-ofA- missioners, who came with nice little dainty tithits in their mouths, pardons and promises, to drop around the American door-yard. Too late!' these royal poodles and King Charles' spaniels. . America had outgrown pets, petting, and even pantalettes. She had& come of age, and deliber- -ately made up her mind to leave the uncomfortable homestead and to do for herself. She had a good 'friend in France, who encouraged her independent no- tions, and who, on the 6th of February, 1778, told everybody- England, America, and the other nations - that she was ready to stand by the plucky Colonies. This declaration, usually termed a treaty of alliance and commerce, was received with great joy by Amer- ica, and with keen resentment by England. Russia, always our friend from the first, clapped France on the back for her conduct, and the people of Europe, out ofdislike to England, sided with the Colonies, and applauded their new friend. The old rivals, England and France, again scowled, flushed up, and clinched. During the rest of our Revohition French names are turned up by the wheel, which' had so far run entirely on land, side by side with American. It was 13       ,     s   2VU TAE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITfD TlA'l^o now at times to be put into water, and to dip its blades into an element which, troubled by navigation acts, had/separated us from   England, but which now, blessed by a treaty of amity, was to unite us to the country of Lafayette.  Atjthe -opening of the crocuses, in- the spring of ,1778, Lord Howe and his brother, the Admiral, were ir. the Quaker City, a city which, though mainly made up of the disciples of peace, wielded both pen and musket in favor of war for peace. A French fleet, commanded by Count d'Estaing, sailed from France to pen up in the Delaware the English brothers with their fleet and army; but these some Howe getting at once wind of this intention and into their own sails, contrived to escape to New York. Part of the British forces took the land, route to New York, courageously braving the dangers incident to New Jersey travelling. A little accident befell them on the route, June 28th, about eighteen miles south of Philadelphia, at a small place then called Monmouth, where, colliding with Washington and the artillery train of which he was conductor, they lost three hundred men. The Ameri- can loss was only seventy,- v ery trifling for a gen- uine American collision. It was in this battle that General Charles Lee became insubordinate, lost his reason, and was cast on the lee shore of patriotic duty, - a misfortune which, eighty-three years later, hap- pened to another general of the same name.  The French fleet, finding on its arrival at Phila- delphia, that the Howes had tdone to New York, followed suit thitherward; but on reaching Sandy EIook, it was defeated in its intended action against   SECOND TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. S91 them by an injunction raised by the New York bar, and so proceeded to that fashionable watering-place, Newport. Admiral Howe soon after took a notion to go to. the same place, and, being reinforced by several ships, set out with his squadron. D'Estaing, inter- mitting his study of the "Round Tower," "The Spout- ing Rock," and "The Dumplings," sailed out like a- generous foe, to meet him half-way. The fleets, long in ogling sight, and loath to leave each other, were yet kept apart by those adverse winds and rough seas which sometimes in naval war, as in love, neither blow nor run smooth, and which, at least in this case, - as sometimes happens with lovers, - prevented an engagement. In September, General Clinton, who had superseded Lord Howe, sent out two marauding expeditions, one to Buzzard's Bay, which burnt seventy American ships , roosting there 'on their anchors; the other against Little Egg Harbor, which took a considerable amount of stores laid there, over which much British cackling was had. The massacre at Wyoming by Colonel tohn Butler and his Indian allies - only palliated by the plea that, while it cruelly put out of existence some three hun- dred settlers, it called into being the beautiful "Ger- trude of Wyoming "-and the barbarities committed by another band of Tories and savages at Cherry Val- ley, raised the hair on the head of many in Europe as well as in America. Towards the South the war now turns. The French and English fleets, having sailed for the West Indies, thus relieving Sir Henry Clinton of a natural anxiety   292 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. about New York, he despatched thence, in November of the same year, a force of two thousand men against Georgia. Savannah, just then preparing to receive her first bran-new city charter, and feeling like a -boy who is promised his first pair of long pantaloons to cover his lengthening proportions, was taken in hand by Clinton's military schoolmaster and humiliated by a gentle spanking. Her sandy bottom, however, stood the trouncing well. She had- the hardihood even to look right pleased and content when it was soon after told her that an expedition sent out against Port Royal, South Carolina, had been soundly ferruled. The year 1779 opened with, and shut upon, a lively guerrila war, carried on through Georgia and South Carolina by small bodies of troops, so light as almost to seem feathered, led by Moultrie, Pickens, and other partisan officers, who teased and worried the enemy by incessant scratches and irritating stings, especially annoying in the summer-time and amid a warm climate. At the North the British forces spent themselves on : small excursions out of New York, very much: as many people still do, and with the same result,- exhausting their own means and- boring the people up the Sound and Hudson River. On one of these excursions under Governor Tryon, an attack by fifteen hundred men was made in March, 1779, upon Horse-Neck, one of Putnam's outposts, a high, steep hill defended by one hundred and fifty men and two old rusty field-pieces. The powder failing, these loud-talking mouthpieces of the little party were almost silenced, when a cavalry charge was ordered upon the small band at the top of o    SECOND TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WH'FJI. ;VO  PUtNA HOME-STEC DON ORS-NC.   294 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. the hill. Putnam's troops were directed to withdraw behind a morass inaccessible to cavalry, when Put- nam himself, staying behind to serve the hard old swivels with the few grains of powder freshy discov- ered, and, finding himself closely pressed by assailants, leaped upon his horse and launched himself down the precipitous ledge amid a tempest of bullets and stones. It was neck or, nothing; and he won by a neck,- 'his own,-which, :had the horse given out, would probably have' been stretched. In September of this year Count d'Estaing returned from the West Indies, with his fleet; and having in vain tried to recapture Savannah, took French leave of it and of America, having had a yachting trip in American waters with the usual yachting experience, - a good deal of getting up, a deal of getting down, large consumption of provisions and liquors, high hopes in idle state-rooms, and low performances on deck. Spain, now conceiving a violent taste for Gibraltar, Jamaica, and the two Floridas,-for the taking of which by England aforetime she was of course very critical upon Albion,-seized the opportunity of Britain's multiplying engagements with America and France, to let her know that she desired an immediate return of these forced loans. England of course in- sisted that, if she was an international pawnbroker, she was not obliged to surrender articles taken in until she chose to give them up, or until payment was made with shot and shell. She resented and resisted the demand; resisted it when Spain stepped up to her coast with a large .fleet, resisted it successfully for   SECOND TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. 295 three years at the Gibraltar Rock itself, and resisted it wherever Spanish gentlemen appeared to assert it, either on sea or land. Meanwhile, on the 23d of September, 1779, Paul Jones, a Scotchman by birth, and who, like his apos- tolic namesake, had been " in shipwrecks often" and "in perils in the sea," the first who ever displayed the American flag, now sailing the good ship "Bon Homme Richard," -an old Indiaman converted into a war vessel,-after capturing with this old lugger twenty-three merchantmen, at last fell in with two heavy English frigates. Lashing his own ship to the larger one, he so laid on other strings that at the end of two hours he had thoroughly whipped both, - a whipping Whose stinging recollections brought the  color for a long time into even the ruddy cheek of Mr. Bull. :       \   CHAPTER IV.

The former were poor, their workmen: wretchedly clothed,   "AST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. 297 badly fed, discontented with the small pay promised, and often threatening to strike because that pay was only irregularly and partially paid, and, when given, only afforded in depreciated and depreciating new paper promises. The latter, on the contrary, with that obsti- nacy which sinks deeper and rises higher with the rising tide of opposition, and possessed of resources to match this dogged pride, made larger preparations to open the coming campaign. Parliament voted to add to its colonial army one hundred  and twenty thousand men, and wrought, up the sinews to carry this then enormous live weight to twenty million ( sterling pounds. It was a hard spring in Charleston; for it hailed heavy iron hail-stones from Sir Henry Clinton's bat- teries, from April 1 to May 12, 1780, when the city became so riddled that it gave up. The storm soon spread, bursting over the entire States of North and South Carolina, and beating down for a time, as with iron flails, the growing harvest of patriotism. A good part of the crop was, however, finally saved during the late summer, by Marionj Pickens, and Sumter, who, with their sturdy little bands of reapers, toiled all through/ the blinding storms with high spirits, and without pay. Sumter was well called "The Carolina Game-cock"; for he often drove his sharp spurs into Corwallis and Tarleton, and roused a very cheery feel-, ing by his crows through those gray mornings of, lib- erty.     4   '  -  .          - Gates, who had so successfully administered Sara- toga water to Burgoyne and his men three years be- fore, was despatched in haste to look after the obstinate 13    '   298 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATESO and severe cases of Clinton, Rawdon, and Cornwallis in South Carolina ; but, as it often happens, the remedies successfully applied to-one patient often fail with an- other. At Camden - a name which should have been propitious to American arms - the army of Gates was seized by that frightful epidemic, a panic; and ran away, carrying off with them their general's sole chance for the next Presidency. Nathaniel Greene, a Rhode Island Quaker,--the ungloved right hand of Washington, who had served in the army with brilliant and yet solid success since June, 1775,-succeeded the unsuccessful Gates in August, 1780; but the heats of summer melted out all serious campaign attempts on either side, through the South, during that season. St. Louis, then a village sixteen years old with nine hundred and sixty inhabitants, exalted above the dirty Mississippi on two terraces, or a double platform of earth, was assailed by some Englishmen and Indians from Michilimackinac, -as it has often been since, by people of all nations; but on this first invasion the invaders were as glad to get away as their succes- sors have been to stay. Meanwhile General Greene was detailed to act as president of the court of inquiry upon Major Andrd, that historical romance of our war, as Mary Queen of Scots is the sentiment of the tough annals of Scotland.  This handsome romantic, cultivated, and high-bred Englishman, th6n in his twenty-ninth year, who had unsuccessfully courted in Ireland the future mother of Maria Edgeworth, the novelist, and then won a better fortune from the golden hands of trade, had afterwards ,  .i.              ' !j   "AST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WTHEEL. 299 flung himself into the stern arms of war. Lowering himself to the mean business of carrying dangerous, sealed secrets in his boots, outside the mails, contrary to' all laws, and caught in the act by three militia- men, who, after playing cards with each other, played a sharper and more patriotic game with him, he was most disagreeably elevated to the rank of a spy, and sent in consequence to find out the great secret on a very lonesome journey. His principal, Benedict Arnold, - who had suffered the canker of excessive extravagance to eat through  his brave and well-shredded military coat, - escaping from our dangling line into the English straighter ones, received fifty thousand dollars and, a brigadier- general's commission. He was: subsequently elected by General Contempt into thie celebrated order- of Judas Iscariot.  The campaign of 1781 was inaugurated New-Year's day by a good-natured and semi-patriotic insurrection among the Pennsylvanian troops stationed at Morris- town, New   Jersey; not on account. of the Jersey ways, usually deemed so hostile to foreigners, but by reason of the scant fare, clothing, and pocket- money to which they were reduced.    Marching to Princeton, they were met by emissaries from General Clinton, with large offers of bounty-money to enlist for King George; but the noble-minded troops, spurn- f ing these attempts upon their virtue, delivered up these agents, as spies, to General Wayne. A   com- mittee from Congress relieved the just needs of the insurgents, and offered them rewards for their patriotic treatment of the spies ; but they refused to accept pay for what, they truly asserted, was but their duty.   300 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. With such metal were the new moulds of American life filling up. By such iron bands was the Revolu- tionary wheel made strong and irreversible. The attention of Congress was now seriously and effectively drawn to the condition of the army,-the crank. of the wheel. Robert Morris was appointed Superintendent of the Treasury; and the treasury- till then a very celestial affair, undefiled by filthy lucre, and having out-goes in the place of in-gots- was tol- erably supplied by taxation at home and loans abroad. Again the scenes of the war lie south of Baltimore. At the Cowpens, in South Carolina, Colonel Tarleton was caught on the horns of Morgan, three hundred of his men tossed fatally, and the rest, with their leader, severely gored and gashed. Cornwallis soon found that the Southern commander was not a Greenehorn. At Guilford Court-House, the English leader, with a supe- rior force, met the American general, with 4,500 men, and after a severe grapple, fell back with the air and con- viction of a man disagreeably undeceived. The Ameri- cans now seemed to have received an ally in general success; for in April, May, and June they retook, one after another, all the forts, outposts, cities, and military points occupied by Lord Rawdon. On the Catawha, Morgan gave to Tarleton a little more grape, which sent his lines reeling backwards in awkward confu- sion towards the main body. As soon' as September began to cool the air and make travelling tolerable in aswarm climate, General Greene, with an American party, and Colonel Stewart, with an English company, took it into their heads mu- -tually to visit Eutaw- Springs, about fifty 'miles west of   "AST TURN 'F THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. 301 Charleston. The meeting was unusually lively; in fact, quite an Irish gathering. Like most Irish fights, too, it was impossible to say, which had the worst of it. Both sides held a funeral wake over about three hun- dred killed, and claimed the fewest graves and victory. After this affair, the British flock, which had been scattered more or less over the two Carolinas and Georgia, gathered back and alighted for a long time on two favorite spots, Charleston and Savannah.  Near them gradually collected ready American hunters and fowlers, fond of foreign game, vigilant in watching and very desirous of bagging the entire lot. Meanwhile, Cornwallis had advanced northward through North Carolina into Virginia, where the young French marquis-  more fortunate than- the almost useless French fleets, first under D'Estaing, and after- wards under Admiral De Ternay--was doing good service. The route of Cornwallis was nearly along the present track of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, which fortunately for' him was not then in existence, to invite him to use its delaying time-tables and dan- gerous rails. As it was, he reached Petersburg in the course of time, and in safety. A detachment sent to Charlottesville, where the' Legislature of Virginia was in session, seized several. of those most unmanageable specimens of the- human race, members of assembly, troublesome enough when let alone, but as prisoners wholly incapable of defini- tion, exchange, or valuation. The squad came near burning their fingers by taking the red-haired and red- vested Jefferson, whose term as Governor had expired only two days before, but around whose head there yet   302 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. lingered enough of the, aureola of official dignity to make him worth several cart-loads of assemblymen. For Cornwallis himself the three military fates-- Washington, Rochambeau, and Lafayette--were se- curely and steadily spinning lines for his entanglement. At last they enmeshed him at Yorktown. Nine thou- sand, Americans and seven thousand Frenchmen held the netting which, gathered in fold after fold, finally, October 19, 1781, caught the whole shoal,--Corn- wallis, that' voracious old'pike which had devoured scores of American' armored fish, and 7,000 others. In this splendid haul were found, 235 cannon, 8,000 small arms, and regimental colors enough to supply all the state-houses for the next sixty-five years. When Lord George Germain hastened with the dis- agreeable and accelerating news to Lord North, the premier raised his hands wildly in the air, and ex- claimed, with an oath too big to fit our Comic History, "It is all over." For the first time, during the last six years, Lord North was right. George III. stormed loudly, and, at a hint that American independence must follow, threatened to freight a large boat with his ponderous heaviness, and be transported to Hanover; but he soon concluded to take another bucolic roll in the rich English clover, and to postpone turning himself out into the thin graz- ing lands along the Weser.       I The American George rejoiced with temperate joy, thanked God for the crowning mercy, ordered divine service to be performed throughout the camps, and thanksgiving turkeys to be rendered to, and thanks-   "AST TURN OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WHEEL. 303 giving by, the troops. And so ended 1781, as all years should end, with thanksgiving and turkey. Christmas dinners, or something else in America, had the effect of turning the English stomach against  the war ministry of Lord North. "Let us have peace," piped the English House of Commons to the watch on  the deck of the still fine, but somewhat battered, Royal George. "Ay! ay!" responded the first mate.  So the ship was hove to, and a gentleman stepped down the ladder let down her sides, was rowed to the French shore, and at Paris met four American ex-rebels,- Adams, Franklin, Jay, and Henry Laurens. These five gentlemen, on the 30th of November, 1782, sitting at a round table covered with green baize, signed a preliminary agreement for peace, which was joyfully attested by many millions of witnesses.  This agreement was dressed up with new ribbons tenll months after, and then became a fixed, resolute treaty, - a gay, laughing, sunny break- in our history, - but in the English chronicles a flinty, hard, jagged fact, against which the waves of national pride long broke sullenly and hoarsely. England had sent one hundred and twelve thousand five hundred and eighty four soldiers and twenty-two thousand seamen to this unjust, successless war; had lost many thousands out of their ranks; had lost much solid, precious money; lost credit and honor, more precious still; and now at last lost the colonial empires themselves. She had thus millions of reasons for not being jolly.- The Revolutionary wheel, which had begun to slow after the battle of Yorktown, now of course wholly A            .            .     304 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE.

The grist was ground,   In it, it is true, were some hard colonels, some badly ground, dyspeptical grains, some dark specks; but, on the whole, the yield was good, unbolted American family flour. Of course the miller took toll. This came out in the shape of debts for soldiers' wages, for money borrowed, for stores used, powder exploded, and pensions in the near distance; but still there was a broad country to gather it from, reaching westward to the Mississippi, north- ward to the Lakes, southward to the Gulf and Florida, and eastward to the Atlantio. There were indepen- dence achieved'by obstinate bravery, right of govern- ment, right to tax one's self, and, above all, the right to spend one's own taxes, even on useless officials and handsomely printed laws. And so, on the whole, the customer was well .satisfied with his large, healthy, unbolted grist.   CRAPTER V. HOW  A POOR CONSTITUTION BROKE DOWN.

AVERY     community, like every individual, has its axis of growth.    Sometimes this axis is in the line of large, generous expansion, loving, trustful, and unselfish; sometimes on the crooked wire of involved, self-stunting contradictions, of twisting jealousies, and of resolutely resistant forces, which project crabwise on- all sides, and  propel with counteracting momen- tum in all directions, and so sprawl out either in bal- ancing rest or in a slight gain rearward. Of these latter stationary or retrograde and always negative qualities, the Confederation largely partook. The committee, appointed by Congress, June 11, 1776, ! to draft a plan for governing the thirteen Colonies,   HOW A POOR CONSTITUTION BROKE DOWN.   307 shared in the feeling, indulged by the people at large, of apprehension as to the natural driftage of central power athwart popular rights. They, lik6 their con- stituents, were very subject, to that political fever and ague, a shivering, chilly dread that an American par- liament might grasp and abuse the power of taxation as the English congress had done, and a heated, burn- ing fever whenever the possibility of legislation in matters of religious faith was started in any vein. IDenying the power of King George, George Gren- ville, or any other George, to put his hand in their pockets, they thought it logical--and it was the natural logic of distrust - to refuse permission even to their own agents, although frequently elected and called to account by themselves, to agree upon any plan of mutual contribution for the common good. Smarting under wrongs inflicted in the name of government, our confederated progenitors were never able to gain political faith and strength enough to crawl out from  under the shady side of authority around to its sunny, cheery, beneficent face. The needs for a Union were yet unfelt. All the thirteen Colonies held slaves, all sloped to the At- lantic, and all, except Pennsylvania, touched the sea. Their substantial agreements created as yet no wants; their broad areas made them independent; their slight diversities were not so strong as to require the firm -hand of central power to bind them within a well- hooped circle, within which aggressive rights might be so restrained as not to become antagonistically hostile, and which might yet continue so free that their forces might work together and onward in large and enlarg- ing action.   308 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. The Committee sat for sixteen months; and in No- vember, 1777, the lumpish, inert grub of-Confederation saw the light. A poor, weak grub it was, without developed legs to go on, without eyes to see with, filmed over with a gelatinous, swathing membrane squirming in feeble inanition, and feeling as cold as a tax-bill, or the shake of a cashier's hand with a doubt- ful bank customer on discount day. The scheme of Confederation was the child of Doubt put out to the nurse of Jealousy, It was watched to death by the members of the State family, each taking its turn, and each well'pro- vided with the cold-gruel theory, that what the child cried for was not good for it, and, that what it really and always wanted was a sound course bf starvation. And so starvation it got, with an occasional blue-pill administered by those little teasing children, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, whose jealous preten- sions were of .course inversely to their size. No wonder that the brat grew pale. In a word, the States were everything, the Confeder- ation nothing. The powers of the latter were, like poor pine boards, filled with nots. The Confederation could not, of itself, levy taxes; it could only cipher up what each State ought to pay, and then advise it to pay the sum stated. It could not raise an army; and, amid the extra jealousy against a military force, it was hardly suffered to figure out the quotas of the various States- which might, if they saw fit, follow the advice, or might, if they chose, disregard it. .Of course the States generally treated these debiting bills as any customer would a draft upon him, when accompanied       .        .   HOW A POOR CONSTITUTION BROKE DOWN.   309 by an intimation that, although payment was desirable to the writer, he, the correspondent, might pay or not, as and when he found it convenient. Without trem- bling as Felix did, they adopted the ROman governor's mode of dealing with unpalatable advice,-thoughts and suggestions of a judgment to come being post- ;poned to a time which, rainbow-like, never touched them. The Confederation had no power over exports or imports, or the revenue therefrom; the States sit- ting along the sea-shore, keeping each its own straw to suck its private fill from the large, maritime bowl in front of it. It had no authority to punish treason, as the States considered it no crime to hiurt or maltreat the poor manikin which they had set up. It could not even collect more postage on letters- than was barely necessary to defray the expenses of carrying the mails. As for the franking privilege, that curious Congressional levy on the public treasury, comically supposed to be repaid to the people by heavy speeches, very uncurrent and untransportable, which require all the government levers to lift them up to the. unwilling hands of their constituents; this privi- lege was as yet undiscovered. There was one prohibition which might, in our time, with great advantage to the public interests, be even extended; the interdict upon men going to Congress more than three years out of six. Even the three years might be profitably prohibited, - an economy of bad laws, bad speeches, bad manners, and of $1,635,000 -- annually paid for salaries. It is noteworthy, however, that among the stark cold negations of the Confederation act, there were two;   310 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. warm  affirmative provisions, one securing to person' of every color equal rights in all the States, the othei making each man's conscience the teacher and judg( of his religious belief. These were the two red cur. rents, the arterial blood, which kept alive the lumpish footless, armless, and eyeless grub, and preserved it during the Revolution,' and through the caterpillar chrysalis condition from 1783 to 1787, until at last, in the latter year, it burst forth into the glad, beautiful perfected butterfly, the Constitution, vital with sus- taining power, bright with yellow promises, and rising joyously into the large air of healthy freedom. The phoenix of the. Confederation, that arose out of its ashy bed very larky and lustily crowing Yankee Doodle, was our present Constitution.   BOOK      FOURTH.

Pat- terns have been taken from it, and cheap imitations at- tempted; but these latter are just as easy of detection as cottonized linen, dyed hair, or carminized blushes. ' There, too, one finds readily and in abundance heavy cloths for the country's wear through the wintry storms of financial distress, foreign wars, or domestic insurrec- tion; ready-made clothing for legislative and execu- tive use; white linen goods for the judges, as stainless as snow, although not quite as cheap; a great variety of under-garments to fit the po7wers of Congress, and a large assortment of hosiery to encase with restrictive woof its rapid understandings. As one advances, he finds a miscellaneous collection of rights; patent contrivances to give people in one State the same expansion, weight, and solidity as in another; admirably adjusted devices for catching per- sons with colored skins, when attempting to run off with them  over boundary lines, -a device ingenious- ly stamped "labor-saving machines," --an article  n  great demand between 1850 and 1861 in the southern portion of the Union.  On the same counter lie habeas corptus non-suspenders, a strap occasionally called for by passionate judges and choleric magistrates; tacks, which can only be driven in all over the surface of America up   to the same point; muzzles over legis- lative bills and hungry congressmen, to prevent them from pecking at the   estates of people politically de- ti capitated, and  from whettincg up the keen edge of ex post facto laws; handsome   checks on the treasury; good bills of lading, current in all the ports of the   316 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. Union, if at any time introduced in any one of them; specimens of gold and silver, made very tender in all the States, especially during a time of plenty, and be- fore a war; and a large variety of odd gear, to prevent people from getting into, or, if in, out of, trouble. Proceeding to the rear of our Constitutional bazaar, the shopper will find the very latest styles and modes of civil rights; pieces adapted to dress and re-dress pulpits and printing-presses; militia uniforms; arms without quarterings; padlocks to secure houses from being entered and searched; devices to keep property from being taken.-for public use without proper pay- ment; jury-boxes and trial balances. : But the very latest article added to this great empo- rium is a curious contrivance, said to have been in- vented by a Down-Easter named Sumner, for prevent- ing one man, even if he be draped in a mourning skin, from being owned by another man. Of course it would strike any one but an American as a very need- less article, especially out of place among staple goods, and one which ought never to be called for in a coun- try which takes such pains and pride to claim and proclaim that other invention  of a man down South, called Jefferson, whereby one man is made equal to every other man. Still, it is well known that the Sumner unclasping machine is a very useful one, and well supplies a need long felt. Attempts are now made, as we write, to introduce into public use another article, called the Fifteenth Amendment, and to put upon it the Constitutional pa- tent-mark, an article which is calculated to hinder any evilly disposed person from stripping off from another    THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.      317 at election time, - a period when a certain strange Ra-  bies seizes Americans and makes them inclined to tear each other and their clothing,-their electoral vest- ments, or voting suits, especially if they do not suit them. The new pattern is black and white, and al- though it has had as yet a checkered fate,--some preferring it all white, some all black, others: white with a leaden-colored border, - it is thought by shrewd buyers that the novelty will soon come into general use. These last-named goods are far from being fash- [ionable at the South. One of the most surprising  characteristics of our fashionable Constitutional shopping-place is, that ev- erybody finds here just the article to suit his taste, judgment, and even his fancy, whimsical as it may be. If Mr. J. C. Calhoun or Mr. J. Davis wants a com- lplete outfit for States rights, he walks in, and has no difficulty in finding it just to his liking, and in a con- siderable variety of shades and materials. He puts his hand on one of the new styles marked "Article X," and is confirmed in his choice by reading upon the' label the manufacturer's description: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitu- tion, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." He turns around, and, traversing other departments, discovers sundry other articles of like style to match these. lHe also lights upon more gauzy, thin, or fine-spun, fleecier goods to throw/around the exposed shoulders of the States. On the other hand, if Mr. D.: Webster or Mr. H. Clay desires a thorough suit for the central Federal fig-   JiII?: i 318 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ure of Uncle Samuel, he is shown directly to the sec- tions where he can procure quantities of them; hats to cover banking brains; coats and vests to put over the inner works, to aid digestion and promote internal improvement; pants, hosiery; and boots to keep up our Uncle's advancing strides over mountains, plains, and rivers. Such customers are, of course, walked up directly to section eight, and there are shown in a large box ample and well-nade garments of the desired de- scription. 'On the top of this box the fabricators have put this explanation: "To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers." It was supposed by many of the original members of the firm, who got up this grand Constitutional lH- zaar, that Uncle Sam's concern had the exclusive right to make those bright, popular buttons called " coin,". or "money"; but it was discovered in a very short time that there was an elastic provision in the articles of copartnership, which allowed the individual mem- bers of the firm to manufacture, each on his own ac- count, these shining disks, and even to invent and put forth for sale paper substitutes, which at length be- came so much in vogue as to drive the metallic article, at times, wholly out of the market. Paper collars have not had a livelier run, nor damper shrinkages than these. Statements are often -put forth by people sitting on benches and having a grave, sometimes a grave-clothes air, doubting the right of the Federal store to stamp ex- clusively and to put out for its own particular profit, i v a variety of things, kept there in well-locked sec-    THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION       319 tions; it being claimed that the composing members have a concurrent power to make, stamp, and vend the same goods. On somle of these points the discussion is still goingP ori, and as the partners are a jealous, sharp set, it is not likely soon to terminate. Much trouble has arisen in regard to a large number of bills of credit which have been issued by, and Are still outstanding against, the large Federal concern. Some hlave questioned their power to manufacture this lkind of paper and make it equal to hard coin. Others have doubted the legality of the  step which the firm took in making  this paper good for certain purposes, and not receivable as pay for certain kinds of debts due to the house, arguing that if coin was better than paper, then the paper could not justly be made an equivalent; and if no better, then that paper ought in all cases to be received as well by   the firm  as by others. After much argument before them, however, that popular court, the ballot, gave a  verdiqct against those who so reasoned, and rendered a  decree tiat, if there were no other good reasons, the arguments pro interesse suo and ad necessitatere, especially when im- pelled by the motor of war, were too convincing to be     r set aside, and so legalized the discrimination. Very many people make an unauthorized use of the bazaar. They go in for articles so absurd, so triflifig, or so unusual, that all the clerlks laugh outright, as soon as the inquiries are made.  Some peopl espe- cially members of Congress, candidates for, office, small layers, raised by short hand-levers up towards a  la ge occasion, which they find it difficult to reach, when talking of the thiings themselves, their own pockets, or   320 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. their chances of offices and places, assert, when told that such things do not exist, that they can find them in the old Constitutional store. Accordingly, they post thither, and make themselves ridiculous or disagreeable, by tumbling over and soil- ing the goods that lie there in honest piles, to find their peculiar article. Some of these shoppers last men- tioned are very keen-eyed, gifted with those optics spo- ken of by Hudibras, which see "Things which are not to be seen," and fancy that they see, in their mind's eye, patterns of what. they are after, when in truth the patterns are not at all similar. If the goods found are speckled, checked, spotted, or figured, and the sample .which they have brought has any specks, checks, spots, or figures in it, bearing the most general resemblance, but readily distinguishable from  the goods inspected by any the most careless observer, if disinterested, they hasten away and proclaim  very loudly that the same goods, of precisely the same material, color, make, and style, are found in heaps in the Constitutional shop. There is nothing so sharp as such eyes, except the sin- gle eye to the public good. So, on the other hand, obtuse, dense-headed observ- ers, unaccustomed to make distinctions, rush to the Constitutional with confused or ill-defined recollections of the patterns or styles they want, and buy and bring away packages of goods which, when exposed to a clear light, are at once seen to be wholly dissimilar. As in large stores, some people become confused by the variety, and select at random, or in a perplexed   THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.      321 glamour, articles to match pieces at home either in color, texture, or quality, and assent with a mixed mind to the adroit suggestions of the salesman; so in the various sections into which our Constitutional store is divided up, many good people, even deacons, vestry- men, the annual subscriber to missionary papers, and systematic charity bestowers, become, in the shifting cross-lights of commentaries, and remarks of story- tellers and others, as confused and   astray in their notions, and lose their own not over-strong heads as co mpletely as congressmen at an evening session, or the President during the closing hours of the last night of the congressional barbecue. There is no store so much talked about all over the United States as this Constitutional one; and there are no goods so generally used or so popular as those which are either actually obtained there, or fancied to be in it for sale. Nicholas Biddle once got a gold-colored suit there which he wore in and   around the vaults of the United States Bank, in Philadelphia, from 1816 to 1836; but General Jackson, for various reasons, some of which were very peculiar and   of a hickory color, others as sound as oak, took such a dislike to it, that he finally persuaded the people that it was a very poor suit, and, in fact, never came from the Constitutional store, but was a deceptive imitation of goods there. MVany persons have gone to the Federal store, to pro- cure water-proof constitutional goods, to wear in dredg- ing rivers and harbors, in laying down watery ways across States, and when at work on the coast, or ex- posed to the chilling winds from State capitols; Others insist upon purchasing there, also, long selvedges, or "*       ' '             t   j 322 THE COMC HSTORY .

I!  jl *   CONSTRUCTION.        325 THE thirteen colonial children, emancipated from l[ J parental mis-government in 1783, tired of sleep- / ing together in the same old, rickety confederate bed, which had been hastily put together in 1777, and whose cords they found so small and hard as to cut through the thin mattress above, and so weak as to creak and threaten to go down under them, whenever they stirred or-even spoke above a whisper, at last, in 1789, obtained a new first-class constitutional bedstead. It was wide and roomy, with even, strong springs, and was easy to get in and out of, as well as very comely in shape, and well polished externally. This new article was, however, not decided upon by all the thirteen immediately. It was spoken for in 1787, and, during that and the next year, eleven signi- fied their preference for it over the old tumble-down rumbly. Little Rhody was the baby in the old family, and, fearing to be overlaid and perhaps smothered by. her larger bedfellows, did not crawl under the sheets of the newly upholstered bed until 1790; and not un- til New York and Virginia had agreed to bqe content with a fixed amount of bedclothing, instead of claim- ing, for themselves, that large Western comforter, those earth-colored strips, of the empire pattern, extending to the Pacific side of the bed, and large enough to cut up into a dozen'good-sized State counterpanes. It was not necessary that this youngster, -nor' yet North Carolina, who got in the year before, -should consent, in order to complete the change of arrange- ments from. the old Confederate to the new Constitu- tional system; but as it was an affectionate and gen- erous-hearted family, there was a general desire to   !!j  326 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. conciliate all the members. And so when little Phody got'in and curled up, she was joyfully tucked in by that good old faithful American "help," Washington, a great favorite, who had been so long in the fam. ily that he was loved by every one, and so generous and right-minded that, although several of the other domestics, such as Major John Armstrong and others, who had worked on very low wages with him through the war, proposed to him to take the house himself as proprietor, he indignantly refused so to use or abuse the affectionate trust. of the household. Washington was, however, unanimously chosen Chief Superintendent, and our short, stout, resolute acquaint- ance, John Adams, whom we met at the top of the hill, July 4, 1776, was made his first assistant. The family now set up housekeeping. Like most families in the United States, they were at the outset poor. 'They were especially low in credit; for in consequence of the issue by the Continental Congresses, during  the war, of about $ 300,000,000 of paper money, its value had so depreciated that it became of little use except to line trunks or to patch up cham- bers as ruinous as itself. They were also greatly ill debt, owing at home and abroad $ 79,463,476, -a debt which, instead of being paid off or even reduced, grew, in spite of every economy, good judgment, and excel- lent management, for the next seventeen years, and was not fully discharged until 1824.     This debt amounted to about nineteen dollars-, per head for every man, woman, and child of all. colors in the United States at that, period. Still, they were not in circumstances as discouraging as are we, their de-   CONSTRUCTION.-         327 i scendants, eighty years later; for, estimating our popu- lation now at thirty-eight millions, each man, woman and child now  owns a right to pay as his share of the national debt, sixty-eight dollars, besides a large, comfortable sum  for State, county, city, and town indebtedness, iwhich never figured themselves upon the purees or imaginations of our golden-aged ances- tors. This 'latter ownership is so much the more wonderful as it represents shares in obligations, not wrought from outlays of blood or money in the coun- try's service, but blood and money sucked by corpo- rate and private straws froin our ever-troubled and- ever-bubbling public treasuries WIashington, after a laborious journey, reached New York, and, on the 30th of April, 1789, took the oath of - office as President, on the spot now covered by the" United States Treasury in Wall Street. The bulls and bears of that day,--mere calves and cubs,--not strengthened by the pushing horns and large squeezing powers which have added such force to their descend- ants,'might have heard, in the intervals of their rough play, the solid, honest, heart-felt words of his Inlaugural, in which, among other things, he uttered those now strange, old-fashioned wishes and expecta- tions, that " all employed in the- administration of the Government would execute faithfully and with sue-  cess the functions allotted to their charge." No crowds of patriotic office-seekers stepped over the sills of the new President.

We, search in vain for any records of enterprising committees, State or county, pressing upon the uninformed intelligence of the first office ,appointer the names of persons, otherwise left in native obscurity, for Cabinet seats and responsible -missions; which   might possibly in thoughtless liberality turn  the drippings of their high eaves'into their own hungry pails. So far as our examination has discovered, there were no old battered political hulks, their rigging split by the gales of speculation or, the contrary winds of local indignation, which put into the Presidential port in stress of weather. Gentlemen waited to be sent for, and did not bore through Washington's bedroom wall to present hand- some reminders of services to be yet gratefully per- formed, or to leave their photographs and a solar microscope, in order that he might by the latter descry something in the former and in their originals. Could that modest, slow-minded chief be now per- mitted, through the conjury of a medium, to sit by the side of his successors, during the honeymoon of their official marriages to the state, and see the proces- sion of great men for whom offices wait .pass by with their directories of certificates to  high  intellectual' power and eminent fitness for --  everything official, he would certainly divide his surprise between two great convictions, -,the scandalous waste to which un- claimed virtue runs in this prodigal land, and the terri- ble contrasts between all the past performances of the ins and the easy, liberal promises of the outs.  CONSTRUCTION.        329 President Washington had no difficulty, even unaid- ed by pugilistic M. C.'s or other metallic "rings," in, selecting gentlemen to fill the three newly created execu- tive departments of Foreign Affairs, Treasury, and War. :: Thomas Jefferson, forty-six years old, was requested to assist in managing our foreign relations and friends. Alexander Hamilton, in his thirty-second year, was so- licited to pump something into that very dry cistern, the treasury. To the red-leaved portfolio of war was summoned General Henry Knox, -the Sherman of the Revolution. It was thought that the man who had, in times of Revolutionary discontent, wisely al- layed the complaints of an army whose courage in the field he could nobly stimulate, and who had stroked the right way the rising fur of a disbanded. soldiery, could deal justly with the approaching pension lists, and would fairly adjust the burdens of the seven lean years of war, to and through the many rank and good years which now appeared in the visions of our Ameri-  can Pharaohs. The new Secretary felt, in taking his  place on the war bench, that he was summoned to a -sort of mnilitary coroner's inquest on the dead body of the late Revolution, which had served well in active duty, but which, like every such thing in our hurrying country,-old people, worn-out utensils, and other ex-useful machines,- was considered a respectable encumbrance. To the post of chief justice -of the newly created- Sunpreme Court President Washington nominated John i' Jay, and for Attorney-General, Edmund Randolph of Virginia. It is to be noted that the President, Secre- tary of State, and Attorney-General were all from" the   330 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. same State, --the  greatest Cabinet-making, State bureau manufactory in  the Union. If Connectlcul Pennsylvania, or North Carolina sent any delegates tf the President to remonstrate against the appointmen of two gentlemen from the same State, the reporter of that time have shunned the bare mention of it. Nothing on earth, not even in the United States is perfect; and in the United States especially thing; most perfect are' always in order to be amended Within the very first year of the ratification of tih Constitution, ten amendments were proposed   and carried, making -it an old knife with new. blades, and finishing it up into what some people, -with great novelty, proclaimn it to be, the most perfect instrument ever inVi'nted. The keel of the Supreme Court was, laid in 1789 and the vessel, launched, well officered, and manned provided with new spars, anchors, and comnpass, was despatched from port to ride the turbulent seas of maritime strife -and constitutional conflict, and to override laws and treaties which drift athwart, the path of the Constitution. By and in it States could origi- nally be pursued; but after submitting for about fifty years to the chase of individual plaintiffs, the States, headed by Georgia, roused to a sovereign indignation and ruffled pride by being compelled to answer for grievances inflicted by themselves on Indians, negroes, white persons, and such trash, procured the passage of a jealous amendment, relieving them  from -such embarrassments. (Beautiful is the theory that States can do no wrong Co their own citizens. Millennarian is the assumption that they are so ready'to spring to b.                    .   CONSTRUCTION.      .   331 their loads of duty, that no judicial whip, with a snap- per of judgment and execution, is necessary to :quick- en their slackening consciences. As a beautiful corol- lary from these delightful premises, is the most com- fortable practice of governments not to pay interest on claims against themselves, however hoar with age; for the government assumes to itself the virtue of being always ready, as the ons et origo justitwa, to pay, and is presumably always pressing its offers to pay upon its creditors.  At certain points we now touch the millennium. At the next session of Congress, in 1790, Hamilton presented a report on that subject which,-like the poor, is always with us,-the. public debt. Of course every one thought that it was right to pay the credit- ors who were fortunate enough to live in Europe, who had, at whatever discount, taken our promises; but a great many people with caoutchouc principles doubted whether men silly enough to be born on this side the Atlantic had as good a right to be paid; just as some discriminate between their autographs affixed to notes held by their friends, - leaving such to the mercy of blood,- and those held by strangers, which they de- spatch from unpleasant remer brances by payment. Hamilton recognized no such thin, veneering logic over parts of the public chest; and he was honestly supported by Congress and their makers. ^Philadelphia was made the national capital for the rest of the century; and here,I for the coming seven / years,' Washington's weekly receptions on Tuesdays, and his dinner-parties on Thursdays, created a stir among the disciples of Penn, and caused much greene   332 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. looking ink to be shed from cavilling pens all through the' country. Like congregations which look with a keen-edged criticism upon the social movements of their clergymen, the people thus early began to peer into the green-room of the President's mansion, to count the silver spoons, to feel of the window-curtains, and to compare their silken qualities favorably with their own hangings, and the qualities of the Presidei- tial tenant, as thereby affected, unfavorably with their own.  A democratic people prefer to occupy the green-room themselves. The honeymoon of our newly wedded constitu- tional government was not all roseate. Through the  press a wonderful amount of good advice and double- tongued compliment as already given to the old gen- tleman, who was not likely to forget all the pecca- dillos he had, and to wonder why he had been re- strained front the easy commission of others which he had not committed. The French Revolution had now begun its series of bloody conundrums; and, not content with posing its European circle of listeners with perplexing questions, crossed ^the Atlantic, and thrust upon the administra- tion and demanded immediate answers to some very bothering acrostics and puzzles. The grand riddle which they prided themselves upon, and required to be- first answered, might be stated in the rule-of- three form thus: If France, with a population of seventeen millions, assisted America to gain her inde- pendence fromnt 1778 to 1783, what aid should America, with a population of 3,927,827, give, in 1790, to the Constituent.

Desmoulins? This riddle was differently guessed by , the leading memnbers of our government. Washing-  ton, Adams, Hamilton, and Jay, now recognized as thej leaders of a party for the first time called the Federal, put in the ready, safe, and wise answer, "None";   - 1I while Jefferson and Randolph, in the government, and ilSI Madison, Gallatin, and young Edward Livingston, out of it,-now the heads of the anti-Federal party,-i i- spelled out from their general love of liberty and   ;i'ij sympathy for those struggling against monarchical    I; JlllrUVIIJ ,, I*VVV vruthOm , ", Rz power, without regard to international rights or hoim ."- . i duties the response, "All -that we can."  DOf course much could be said on each side, and of ' course much was said; for the Boston "News-Letter " .j l had now a very vivacious following all over the thir-  '1  teen States, many of which barked in chorus, even at   '  the majestic figure of Washington. Very hard names,   ' too, and even imputations of felonious attempts upon the person of Liberty herself, facetiously assumed by  party zeal to be impersonated in the last uppermost  French faction, were hissed out against the grand old  chief of the nation by those long-billed ganderous    I persons, who, in the warm days of politics, paddle   ; around in dirty pools and splash, with. noisy uproar, :i the black ooze upon the cleanest and purest who pass  by.                         -  i Thus even the golden age had ugly quartz and soil-, ing dirt interspecking it..                S Congress, during the same session of 1790, passed e       a L.'*   i56  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. the first act for counting the people of the United States, - an enumeration which, being paid for in certain years by the number of names taken, has sometimes resulted in "counting one's chickens before they were hatched," -the census-paper containing more names than owners of them. A law was also passed setting in motion that large machine for manufacturing voters, commonly called a  Naturalization Act, whereby a singular pat-riot pav- ing is 'turned out, by which' our polling-places are McIrishized with some very curious bricks, and our polls sometimes are made to suffer by brickbats. A fund was likewise established for sinking the na- tional debt; but like the fAishman's cork contrivance, put, on to enable him to drown himself, the sinking fund, in practice under the statute device, became so buoyant that for several years the debt floated up- wards instead of downwards. The year 1791 was signalized by the birth of Ver- mont, as a State, into the Union, -a family event which at once added many venerable years and an historic solidity to the original members, who thence- forward became "The Old Thirteen."    A  national bank was also ushered into existence, and was care- fully wet-nursed by Hamilton, the government lend- ing it $ 2,000,000, or one fifth of its capital, - a very comfortable christening present. An Indian war which had broken out the preced- ing. year within the present limits of. Ohio, - as if to remind the country of its old irritating eruptions,- raged with some violence through 1791, reddening in spots into a rash and producing some congestion of   IJU3,';l'tU 'ul'rlN.     335! : officers at military head-quarters.

About a month' after the second inauguration of Washington, in 1793, that lively little Frenchman, Edmond Charles Genet, somewhat excited by the revo- lutionary dance about the scaffold of Louis XVI., and the rather wild scenes around the revolutionary tribu- nal in Paris, capered over on a visit to the people of this country, and landed at Charleston, South Carolina. Although commissioned by the French Convention, now the subject of its bloody master Robespierre, as a Min- ister to our government, Monsieur Genet took upon his arrival a sudden fancy to aquatic sports, and despatched on his own hook several cruisers to fish in the troubled waters of the Atlantic for any English, Spanish, or D-utch flying-fish that could be caught.  The old American Squire did not at all relish this international fishing-party, which proposed to use American lines, hooks, sinkers, and bait for the benefit of French packers. Kindly but firmly he requested M. Genet's forwarders to order him back again.  There have always been Americans, born with magnifying specta- cles fastened firmly on their noses, by which every forms of freedom, individual or national, spelt out' to them a clear license to help any party, fraction, or entirety of a people fighting, or claiming to fight, against the old governing power. ( Wherever you see a crown, hit it," is their one motto. In April, 1793, this class had many representatives, who thought that the French gentleman and his fishing-parties were all right. In 1794 a Whiskey Rebellion arose, not in Ken- tucky nor among the Bourbonites, but in Pennsyl- vania. This insurrection defied for some time the   CONSTRUCTION.        337    j cautionary, expostulating, and well-sealed proclama- tions of the President; but when the sharp, military drum-beat, backed by fifteen thousand militia, with  m  . well-set bayonets, was heard in the western part of  the State, its leaders and their weak followers reeled   ' back into quiet and submission.  Nothing so much     I shows the simplicity of that golden age of the Repub-   i lic as this resistance to a whiskey tax. In our more debased but keener times, people distil much comfort    I from a heavy tax - far heavier than that of 1794--,    i ' through taps and tu)es placed in the obnoxious arti-   ! cle, which is led off and around so circuitously and ingeniously as 'hardly to know  where it is going, until all .of a sudden it falls plump in large coin  within the well-adjusted pockets of the non-complain-  ! ing manufacturer. Instead of gett  ing up insurrections  '  in Pennsylvania against the high excise, he now forms   i: i combinations at Washington to raise it higher.      il, The year 1795 ] the era of treaties,-establish-     i ing diplomatic lines to England, --which ever since    i  the peace of 1783 had been uneasily bobbing up and down, neither fishing nor cutting bait; to Spain, whose American possessions of Florida and Louisiana  -: were thereby staked and roped off from  our greedy  ; boundaries; to the dark Dey of Algiers, whose corsairs   il  were thus enmeshed in the silken nets; and, finally,    i!  to the Northwestern Indian tribes, who, as usual, gave   il  us a large piece of territory. for a little piping peace .  with hot embers on the top.

In 1796, Tennessee, making the     , .I sixteenth State, was welcomed into the household. Its capital, Nashville, settled in 1779, contained only  .. a few cabins; but the folds of the Cumberland warmed them rapidly into life.  . Washington, then sixty-four years of age, announced in September, 1796, his intention to retire to the sunshine of private life. His farewell was the bless-   - ing of a ripe sage upon a sorrowing people. It was none the less genuine, rich, and good, because comi- . cally imitated by a few of his successors. Even An-     j drew Johnson's did not belittle it.  Several gentlemen, it was discovered, had a fancy to -  i  try the official shades which the great American was   r  ' so glad to quit.  Of course Virginia supposed that     I the rotation in the office should, like charity, begin at home.  Such, too, was the opinion of sixty-eight elec-  tors; but as seventy-one disagreed with   them, the -    l short, stout, well-grained " column of Congress" was transferred, for the four followng years, into the ex-  a  ecutive post. .                 -; li -/I   CHAPTER III.

The elder Romans had a chamber, placed in= the in- nermost part of the house, devoted to the images of the departed members of the family; images named after, but not always likenesses of, those who had led the way in the family history.   So great- was their reverence for these, so intimate the relation main- tained with them, that, on the departure or return of any of the household; these silent figures were saluted with the same affection as the living. The family photographic album is the modern cham- ber in which are kept our simulac ra. Enter it as often as we may, scan as often as we choose its portraitures, we never survey with indifference, and rarely without better and tenderer feelings, these mute, dear faces. Just as dear, just as touching to our national feel- ings, sensibilities, and emulous gratitude, just as in- structive to  head and  heart, are the cherished and beloved features of our national forefathers. Turn we then a few leaves with interest, perchance with profit. An instinctive delicacy places the elders at the head of the procession. Of course the very first in the book, as in our hearts, is the dear, good face of our   great-great-great-grand- father, GEORGE WASHNGTON.   How well we all know it. One hundred and twenty-eight original portraits were taken of him, between 1770, when he was thirty- eight years old, and 1796, when he was sixty-four, by various painters, from the elder Peale to Sharpless.   342 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. The statue of Houdon, ordered by Virginia in 1785, and finished in 1788, perpetuates in marble, to its vis- itors at Richmond, as its engraved copies have made familiar to all, the full-length majestic figure and port of the wise, thoughtful, and careful General. Yet nu- merous as are the likenesses, multiplied by various art processes, and scattered-through parlors, bedrooms,. sheds, cabins, and books, we instantly recognize and instinctively love the noble features of our dear old grandfather. Very grave he is, very sedate, as if lhe was thinking how-it-was best to settle in life some of his large household. His thoughts seem so earnest and weighty that we cannot interrupt them. Good and humane as is the face, we cannot bounce in, leap upon his high knees, pull lovingly his long hair, and then scamper away with a sense of unspoken forgive- ness in our thumping hearts. O no! There is an awe in his presence, benevolent as it is, a width of respon- sibility in his thought-beaming face, which stills and hushes us. Very reserved and calm, seldom volunteer- incg a remark, nev a a laugh, for mere entertainment, he makes ordinary conversation appear like empty chattering. Yet ever gracious is lie, ever gentle, well- bred, and self-contained. His reticence is not sour, but thoughtful, his silence the waiting upon a large utterance. Intent and earnest after something he always seems. Even in his relaxation from formal work, and when least occupied, he seems like a good fisherman sitting on the bank, carefully watching the float, and fixed upon securing the nibbles. A noble face! just the frontispiece to a great His- tory, the preface to an Encyclopaedia of Moral Philos-   OLD FAMLY PORTRAITS.      343 ophy and Political Rights, the trunk of a large genea- logical tree, the grandfather of a large, proud family. Stories we have of his boyhood; but they do not strike or stick to us as accounts of a boy. Even when cutting down the cherry-tree, and then scorning the boy's ordinary deception in regard to the author of the deed; when mastering the blooded horse, at the ex-    ! pense of the animal's life, and then hastening to avow   ' to his stern but just mother his exclusive agency in the fatal conquest,--he seems the same calm, staid, mature impersonation of heroic Truth, as when he stalks with longer strides through a nation's history.  ! Some naturalists tell us that the trunk of the tree / does not lose its bulk as it grows upward; but that, if we measure the tapering trunk   and its outspreading   i branches, we shall find  that together they form  the same size and weight throughout.   So Washington, if viewed in sections, appears of equal size, dimensions, and compacted force in each.

On the next page of our album is our great-great- grand and good mother MRS. MARTHA WASHNGTON.        I We love so-much to look at her sweet, handsome face; , full of a large, generous, grandmotherly nature as a  wide and deep bowl heaped with riper strawherries  laughing through unstinted masses of rich yellow, un- watered cream. We feel at once that there is amply     i enough to go round the largest old-fashioned family,  and no fear, if visitors come in, of its not holding out,  or of a scarcity for the kitchen. She was called Lady  Washington, because they could not help it; for she     ii was a lady.           :i': Of course our grandmother was proud; not vain,  nor boastful, but with pride of character, the pride    I that stiffens virtue into well-doing, makes life gracious, ii and fences in goodness from stray gossips, and self- constituted censors who stray from  their own dis-    ; ordered homes into their neighbor's well-regulated     I households.

We should have lilted to live with him, or if the house, as was natural, was too full for that,' to have made long visits at his mansion.  His is a right royal, good face, -is it not? He looks as' if he was always in love with a whole school of well-behaved, sweet-mannered children, and was about to take out from his capacious pockets, with a sly, benevolent surprise, a large assorted lot of pres- ents. His face beams with a broad, heavenly tranced- ness, as if it had taken toll from his sky-tapping kite, and had become charged with positive celestial elec- tricity. He looks as if he might have been chosen the executor of all the estates' in the- Union; and as if half the pangs of death were abstracted from those who were to leave, their children and property to his honest, wise, and efficient care. He seems like a born trustee for schools, an hereditary director of charities, - one nominated in every village and town to every responsible place, and elected unanimously. In his broadly balanced characteristics there is, too, a latent, reserved force, which makes us fancy that he might, when commissioner to England, in 1774, have paid a visit to Burns in Scotland and suggested to him, as advice to others, those shrewd lines: ' Ay free, aff han' your story tell, When wi' a bosom crony; But still keep something to yoursel Ye scarcely tell to ony." In fact, it is upol this felt reserve of uncommuni- cated goodness that we anchor our loving trust, feel- ing that the flukes cannot be uplifted nor our con- fidence drag. Among the few    historical characters   that red-mark the past 5873 years of the acceptedi chronology of our race, Franklin stands among- the  first half-dozen who reconcile us to public greatness, whose individuality is not obscured, whose virtues atre not hazed, whose purity is not flecked anywhere by 1, any soil from the public highways.  A very fine lady was our aunt, MRS. JAMES MADISON.    : That is very manifest by even a casual glance at her    I carefully arranged head-gear, her elaborately disposed  hair, her effectively adjusted shawl, her well-studied  laces and thoughtfully selected jewelry, collars, cuffs,  i and gloves. A little too fine, perhaps, to be cordially  ; loved. A young modest person would, in spite of her    I1 assuring ease of manner, feel respectfully uneasy in    j her presence; but so respectable, so highly respectable  she was, and still shows in her portrait, that we are all ?l:l i very proud of her. If she was exacting, she gave in  . return and to all equal measures of refined courtesy  - and attention. She was very elegant in her manners,    i:1 but shb was patronizing. Very impressive with her     i grand airs, but still patronizing. She lit up the White House With the radiance of cultivated beauty, the re-    finements of courtly ease and high-bred manner, but    i still was she patronizing. She had gone through a third of a century of years    1! when the eighteenth century died. She afterwards so    I cajoled and pleasantly imposed upon Time, that he for-   l got to score several notches against her, and she reached ;i her eighty-second year, about si months before the ' next half-century was complete, before it occurred to  him that the handsome old lady, with the smooth rosy   -   face, had actually gained twelve lustres on the allotted  i i   ,4,S  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. human term. While her husband was not -President until 1809, and continued so only eight years, our Aunt Madison acted like a President's wife before she went into the Federal mansion, and carried her high head- dress and head under it, like a Presidentess, thirty-two years after he left the Executive residence. On the next page of our album is an awkward, tall, ungainly, raw-boned figure, slightly stooping in the shoulders. How it was got together it is difficult to conjecture, how kept together still more puzzling. With a sallow complexion,.iron-bound brow, stern lines running down and apparently holding immovably a large, rigid mouth, with a face like a large, well-filled, cheerful barn, with the door open, our good-hearted, noble-souled cousin, PATRICK HENRY, looks out at us as if he had been stared at before. Fortunately, our Aunt Madison is; on the other side of the leaf, and can- not be disturbed by his slovenly dress. The features show an uneducated man, yet one of strong individ- uality, a capacity for great endurance, a fearlessness of personal consequences, and a will which would, even if the traces were-cut, draw the load by the' bit. Of course he loved a fishing-rod and gun, and told stories all day long. Much pith there was in his daily gath- ered anecdotes, which he extracted from -all passing things, and put into the indolent, good-for-nothing crowd that hung around the tavern, or which crystal- lized around the stove in his too readily neglected law office. Up to his twenty-fourth 'year he had been a farmer and country store-keeper ; but as his only inter- est in the farm was the fish which ran through its liquid ways, and as his account of stock stopped at .   '    \JJLU?A1A1LI rUKAlKLiT S4- the fish-hooks, powder, and ball, which he speedily      i? borrowed of himself without charge, he naturally failed  to acquire anything but sport out of either," He and  Henry Clay were born near each other.   Neither of  them makes a good portrait; both were careless of their personal appearance, And each -was as generous as an     :I apple-tree in full bearing, or a shower in June, which     t slakes the thirst of lazy meadows lying on their backs'    ! with their mouths wide open. But what a treat it must have been to hear Patrick Henry speak.  The small dishonesties of rhetoric he scorned. To its greatest opportunities, however, he strode with a master's step and might. His long, sal-    ; low features then glowed, the stern lines melted into    l an illuminating intellectual beauty, his crooked figure,    i a moment before like a telescope placed on end and sliding by sections into itself, then stretched out and- up into manliest exaltation, and erect, grandiose dig-     i: nity. His keen words, like the battle-axe of the Doug-  las, cleaved the subject from head to chine. His large natural thoughts rushed up the summits of argument, as the free winds sweep the hills, without labor or     h effort, and shook all brains, wise or unwise, dull or      :iij quick, cultured or untutored, bending their tops before  his resistless march, and shaking all their obstinate roots by his relentless grasp.  No  grander storm of    i'l logic, invective, irony, wit, humor, sharp demonstra-      i tion, soul-rousing appeal, or tender pathos ever passed over an audience and stirred them from the deep depths of their nature than that which he awoke. No class        it interests, like those of the Virginia parsons for their     i tobacco tithes, no selfish  isolations, like the petty  *c     ,    350 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. claims of neighborhood squires, no encroachments on popular rights, like the Stamp Act or tea duties, could withstand the noble sweep of his eloquence. The tribune of the people, he was regarded, ere he had reached his thirty-fifth year, as without exception the greatest orator in America, if not in the world. On the opposite, page is the photograph of a dear visitor to our family, GENERAL LAFAYETTE. We never cared to inquire whether he was a relation or not. He was just as good to us as an own brother, He first came to see us when we were poor and needed friends. He had great difficulty in reaching us, as his own gov- ernment gave orders to stop him. His young bride, equally noble in her nature, encouragued his coming. He was obliged to escape from France into Spain, and in a Spanish port to take passage in a Spanish ship, the only cargo of any value, except that made up of Columbus and his one hundred and twenty men from Palos in 1492, that ever came to us from the land of the Cid. The spirited young marquis remained with us from 1777 to 1781, fighting among our bravest, suf- fering privations with the most patriotic, confided in and beloved by Washington and the best of the IRevo- lution. He made us two visits after the war, once in 1784, and the second time just forty years later, upon a special invitation of the nation. Proud and glad were we all to see him. The most wonderful part of the story is, that, after enduring vigorous hand-shaking through each of our then twenty-four States, and kiss- :ing all the children from two years old and upwards, -he survived the job ten years. We must now turn over the leaves rapidly, catching   OLD FAMLY PORTRAITS.      351 quick, pleasant glances at the fine, pale scholarly fea- tures of the pure-minded JOHN JAY, and, on the oppo- site side, of the handsome face and form of his accom- plished wife SALLIE LIVINGSTON, who mated him when    : he was only nineteen,-and consoled his heart and in-   ! vigorated his head for twenty-eight eventful years,  during which his inflexible patriotism, solid judgment, and weighty learning placed him by the side of Wash- ington and John Adams in the estimation of the      I American household.                    i Then come the bluff face of hearty old ISRAEL PUT-   , NAM, whose expression bears the clearly read inscrip-. - tWon carved on his tombstone, "He dared to lead where any dared to follow "; the massed, trustworthy    I head of NATHANIEL GREENE, with its square, Quaker characteristics; FRANCIS MARION'S calm, lucid, tele-    i scopic eyes, and his Ifarmer-like breadth of front, ani-   mated by the dash which egged him, when in the  -saddle, to plucky marches; and a long procession of valiant men and noble women, - family portraits in  our national home gallery, --which gem and illumi-    l; nate our collection and summon fresh pride to our patriotism, and new pleasures, on each review, to our hearts.         ' It is quite needless to suggest that here, too, are the well-preserved effigies of those WISE MEN whom we saw together on the siummit of July 4, 1776, and    i whose remembered figures flitted often through the varied scenes of the Revolution and alighted in the green boughs of our memories. Some of these faces are singularly handsome, illumi-   i nated with the beauty of great purposes. Some, how-    i   352  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ever, are rugged as hillocks, rich in mould but unsub- dued by the plough of culture or the spade of refining taste. Some few hide mean 'purposes behind great, rotund cheekiness; others tell a mixed story of joy and suffering; a few ache with ambitions unsatisfied; still fewer awe us by a Titanic distress; but most are firm with earnest, resolute convictions spiked with will and riveted to the wide aims of continental pur- poses. Here and there come in faces of great softness, sweetness, and delicacy, in which feminine grace and dignity are blent so holily; the mothers, wives, or sisters of the men of the Revolution and who kept alive in their own loving   hearts faith in God, their kinsmen, and themselves; faces which plainly say, "This is a haunted world. It hath no breeze But is the echo of some voice beloved; Its pines have human tones ; its billows wear The color and the sparkle of dear eyes. Its flowers are sweet with touch of tender hands That once clasped ours. All things are beautiful Because of something lovelier than themselves, Which breathes within them and will never die ;- Haunted, but not with any spectral gloom, Earth is suffused, inhabited by Heaven."   t.

The     ii French conundrums thickened.   Genet's successors out-geneted Genet. They not only equipped cruisers    ! from American ports, but--displeased with a treaty     'q which our government had seen fit to make with England, stipulating for the neutrality of America in the pending war between France on the one- side, and ;  iil England, Holland, Spain, and Rome on the other-; authorized the capture and confiscation of American ships. In fact, the French envoys seemed determined' to show the absurdity of the old-fashioned rule, that it  i! i:i took two to make a bargain.  Mr. Pinckney, the American minister to France,  was obliged to leave that American paradise, Paris,    : without a fig-leaf of excuse to cover the naked results  'ii! of his mission.                       i That comic body, Congress, was convened to look into the French conundrums. Of course they talked  so much that they forgot what they came together for;II and no one was any wiser when the speaker's gavil fell and sent them home. The puzzled President de- spatched three commissioners to get a new statement, of the riddle. The Directory told these gentlemen  --as legislative bodies now reply to applicants for relief- that they could only see them through gold-  mounted spectacles. Such a spectacle the American     ii people were not prepared to become. Knowing the sympathy of the anti-Federal party in America with their principles, the French Directory slammed the  door abruptly in the face of the two commissioners      l with Federal leanings, and held the envoy with Re-   356 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. publican tendencies, like another Joseph, by his skirts. In spite of party feeling, however, American indig- nation now rose to the gorge. A small standing army was raised. The keel of our navy was laid, and a Navy Department created, over which was placed Benjamin Stodart., The alien law, authorizing the: President to elbow out of the country disagreeable foreigners, and the sedition act, to fine and imprison any one writing too freely against the government,- measures which marked the distance of Americans of that day from the political millennium, - were first passed by Congress, and afterwards passed, without any fear, by everybody else. The wise old General at Mount Vernon was ap- pointed Commander-in-Chief of the army; and there was a fair chance that the American Captain might yet be obliged to cut the comb of that strutting French cock, which had lately scratched and crowed on so many Italian dung-hills that he fancied himself a full-fledged eagle. Peace commissioners, however, settled the difficul- ties, as old ladies do tea, by a long chat around a covered table.  Bonaparte, who had made a flying mil- itary trip to Egypt, had got the Pyrlamids to look down on him from their stony, century-crusted tops, while he slaughtered the Mamelukes at their feet, had pushed across the desert'with the mirage of empire ever rising upon his unslaked sight, had made a dis- agreeable, tour of the Holy Land, anid had attempted twenty-three times in vain to take St. Jean D'Acre, came back to Paris to be made First Consul in De- cember, 1799,- a Roman office, which he filled like a *    THE STRUGGLE AND FALL OF FEDERALISM.   357    is Roman, by subjugating all Europe by arms and inso-  lence.

Bonaparte met the American corn-    i missioners around the round table, himself as round    I in power as it in shape, and in September, 1800, gave his autograph to a treaty of peace which shielded American independence of action from the insults of  the envoys of a nation hitherto friendly,- a nation   ',l which had in a timely and efficient way, mainly to .  help itself against an old rival, helped us, but which, ?' for the preceding ten 'years, had claimed, and often-  i, sively insisted in return, not from our gratitude, but  as a right, that we should give ojur assistance ttJ-.li' i-i ever-shifting schemes, with many of which we had no    I sympathy, and at a time when to- furnish aid was     ii; almost to ruin our young strength.

Many die without accol- plishing it, some by it. The wheel-shaped city has rotated off from its periphery so many different officials, that, although like a velocipede it is very hard riding, it cannot well be stopped without considerable injury to its Federal rider. The wide region called Mississippi, embracing the present State of that name and also Alabama, - the latter no longer apprehending any new petticoat insur- rection in Mobile from the descendants of the insur- gents of 1706, which with French slowness in swelling the census had only in ninety-five years become two hundred and fifty, and these balanced by an equal number of blacks,- this Mississippi region, now sepa- rated from Georgia, was put into that pantaleted ter- ritorial condition in which a community finds itself, like a young girl-lady at sixteen, who goes to school, lives at home, is governed partly by herself and partly by her parents, acquires pocket-money from the old people, and- notions from circumstances, and drifts vig- orously on through an unsettled perplexity into an early and settled independence. Such in this year of grace 1869 are Arizona, Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Col- orado, New Mexico, Utah, and Washington, whose quickly doubling populations are rapidly pursuing their education through a university where sharp, practical studies are urged with bullet speed; mining silver, gold, and lead by day, and spending most of it in gambling saloons by night; rolling their residences on wheels from one ranch to another; practising high gymnastics with the Indians, by a method better than By                  #   THE STRUGGLE AND FALL OF FEDERALISM.    359  Dio Lewis's; taking frequent lessons in bar-rooms, and  pretty sure to make and be a mark for some one in - - every quarter.

BEFORE turning our backs upon the eigteenth and leaping upon the engine-driven nineteenth century, to be borne swiftly through its rapidly chang-   AMERICAN PRODUCTIONS OF THE 18TH CENTURY. 361 ing scenes, it is well to take a hurried glance back- ward over the path we have traversed and to pick up a few waifs strewn along the wayside.      ; The largest American products of the last century were material. Cereals were common and abundant; serials uncommonly few. The Western lobe or half of the world's brain did not work so actively as the Eastern. Our forefathers were occupied with the ear- nest business of first catching their hare before pre- paring to cook him. They improved the breeds of -useless Indians by putting them  thoroughly under ground.  They disposed also of not a few Englishmen and Hessians during the last quarter of the century by    ? converting them at Saratoga, Princeton,-Eutaw Springs, Yorktown, and elsewhere into good compost, making our soil historically fruitful.  Hunman bones are the phosphates of history.   They quicken a rich heroic growth over sterile soils. Our ancestors enriched many American fields in this way. It is not Quaker husbandry, and   Quaker phosphates      i are few; but for all that, the seeds which  they raise and sell never do as well as when sown in these phos- phated furrows. A  large crop of political principles was gathered in by such laborers as Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Jay, Patrick Henrvy, and others, unpractised in other fields, but yet found to be efficient and skilful. They  learned the  old art and mystery of government   so     ' readily, and showed its workings with such unreserve,     ! that statecraft,-which theretofore had been, in spite      I of its pretentious parade, mainly a system of mutual imposition and overreaching,--saw    itself suddenly 16    362 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. exposed to popular inspection, and made a subject of vulgar, every-day comment.  Like the automatic chess-player, which seemed such a mystery in its curious, systematic, intelligent work, these old auto- matic, governmental- machines were found to be con- trivances, very common when taken apart; in fact, like the wonderful chess-player, kept slyly in motion, by a very ordinary chap, boxed up inside and moving from his hidden quarters, springs invented by a person whose name was concealed, and which kept the pieces going just as well as if the operator had a brain to work with. The machine which our fore- fathers finished in 1789,--scorning to take out a patent for it, or in any way to make it exclusively their own, - apparently complex but really simple, and open to inspection in all its parts, consisted of a stiff popular main-spring, distributing its propelling forces through primary wheels and, political chain-work, which runs from the main wheel to smaller state wheels, and so back and through governors and assem- blies of ingenious cogged and racket motions, securing} thus a free yet regulated movement to all the parts. It is a good machine, although operated at a great dis- advantage by reason of the frequent changes in the hands employed, who have scarcely time to learn their business before they are required to give another set a chance. It is inexpensive, notwithstanding that some of the workmen are learning the kingly trick of considering as their own a good share-of the oil which, in fact, belongs exclusively to its owners, and is in- tended only to keep the machine running. Of course foreigners found not a little fault with this American   AMERICAN PRODUCTIONS OF THE 18TH CENTURY. 363 product, alleging defects which seem very great when viewed under European lights. At first they expressed as many objeions to it as the cotton-planters to Whitney's gin; but it is now very manifest that, while taking exceptions to the political machine, these foreign gentlemen have copied the planters' example of getting up, as soon as they conveniently could, very palpable imitations of the deprecated plan. Among the mechanical inventions, the gin for clean- ing cotton-seeds out of the white tangle, combing the shock head of the old king, and thus making him at once a power and a presentable personage among other self-constituted sovereigns,- an invention wrought out in 1793 by a cute Yankee,--was one which, in its results directly on the material, and indirectly on the moral, condition of the United- States stands emi- nently foremost. By the old hand-picking process, the slave had his hands full to separate the seeds from a single pound of cotton a day.  The, new mechanical picker cleaned six thousand six hundred pounds within the same time. The gin so intoxicated the planter, that he committed 'all sorts of political extravagances and uttered many maudlin ejaculations, until finally, in 1861, he threw himself down upon a bed of 3,400,000 bales in the condition of Noah when, after the flood, he became fery hilarious in the presence of his children. Ham laughed exceedingly at the specta- cle of the American Noah; but Japhet, after allowing the drunkenness four years to cool, at last put over the offensive nakedness a large patch-work blanket, recon- structed at a quilting-match in Washington. It is expected that hereafter his majesty will wear colors   364 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED' STATES. of a faster moral hue than before he so abused the gin. Commerce, no longer tied up to the, shore by the English navigation acts, began, in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, to creep out from the com- modious bays and harbors of our long, wavy coast; and soon, not content with these timorous tentatives, put on waisthands, top-gallant manners, and flaunting gear, and went boldly courting among the wine-cheeked nations, the silk-growing empires, and spicy-tongued kingdoms of the earth. Importations, of course, not only put many new things on, but in, the heads of the emanci- pated Americans, who showed their independence, then as now, by buying abroad liberally the tflings which they did not make or need here. In spite of sumptuary laws, which in some of the new States im- posed fines for owning more than one Silk gown in a family, and which banished jewelry from- homes still innocent of aught but trinkets that cost less money than taste, the beaux and belles of the period whereof we speak began to put on hairs where nature had for- gotten to furnish them, and supplied from Paris, in amounts limited it is true, appliances to remedy defects which fashion insisted had been left by the Creator, in making up woman from a sleepy man. :Hoops every few years girdled the larger or smaller conceits of Madam  Mode's improved figures. Of course Paris was always finding, mistakes in the original Eden pattern; and her customers were. ever ready to try her suggestions as to the newest mode of .correcting them.

Tights, now unwhisperable except in veracious histories, held their   i own with elderly gentlemen to the very close of the century, and were clasped with silver enough to bring a smile, in our day, all over the wrinkling face of the Secretary of the' Treasury. The wide-tailed coats and broad-lapelled vests of the respectable citiz6ns of the Washington and Adams periods would, if worn now upon the platform of an equal rights convention, make the fame of their wearers, and insure full-length por- traitures of their inner selves by conversation-drawing correspondents. Another production  of the eighteenth century was better .material ways for translation over the surface of our rapidly augmenting areas. In 1732 enterprising  ' stages took fourteen days from  New York to Boston.;  but ere the cycle had rounded up to 1800, the time,     i by reason of better roads, was reduced one half. The hard earnings, trickling from the little heaps that labor had gathered up, began to flow out into turnpikes; and milesfnes chronicled spaces and   pointed the fingers of Time to measures for ascertaining and so accelerat- ing speed. {the road-maker and the vehicle-propeller are the two Dioscuri of modern civilization.

The costs of translation are a necessary but onerous assessment upon productive industry.' The    I greatest invention now needed is one which would so condense the earth's bulk by improved and rapid communication, as to squeeze out the distances that separate nations and chill their natural outflow from  s themselves into others.                 I In 1700 the population of Boston was 7,000; that of New York 5,250, of which latter one in seven was colored; a proportion which was augmented in 1711 ini favor of the blacks, by the establishment of a regular and public slave-market.  An English traveller de-  ! scribes Boston in 1700 as a place whose "buildings are, like its women, neat and pretty; the streets of pebble, like the hearts of the men." From such flinty masculines no wonder that the population only reached  ,i to 24,937 in the next one hundred years. Among the leading productions of this century the establishment and growth of manufactures must be reckoned. Even before the Revolution, iron-mills at Salisbury, Connecticut, at Cold Spring, on the Hudson, at Valley Forge and Durham, Pennsylvania, had lifted their ponderous hammers to weld the fused ores, dragged out of our slightly tumbled beds by cars, and had commenced to fabricate instruments of husbandry, kitchen utensils, and - other tripods on which sat, then as now, the Pythonesses of life, who not only inter-   368 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNIrED STATES. pret, but are themselves the oracles of fate.  Our- running streams soon coaxed cotton to take a turn around the spindles which Arkwrighllt, in 1768, had so taught to whirl with their mechanical iron fingers, that one man could work a stubborn iron mule up to a capacity equal to one hundred and thirty of the human species. -The cotton-gin, ere the century closed ac- counts with its busy customers, had handed over such clean cotton to the coquettish jennies, that very pretty yarns began to be spun along many gliding streams. The habits prevailing through the eighteenth cen- tury were still transitional. It was the chrysalis film, covering the flitting worm which had succeeded the inert and slow-moving grub of the seventeenth, and which was soon to burst into the gayer, full-winged butterfly of the nineteenth cycle of time. What hab- its they had were of solid silver. The platings, spread over and hiding darker substances with polished sur- faces, were not yet invented. Morals, too, triturated by the ever-restless surges of time, like the pebbles on a shore which the industrious ocean ever scrubs and washes, became rounder and smoother, and lost something of those angular asperities which added nothing to their usefulness or strength. If we take an account of the purely intellectual and literary stock on hand in America at the close of the century, we shall find that, while the one hundred years had been run on a slender and mainly upon bor- rowed capital, there were results in fabricated stuffs by no means discreditable,'and in raw material a mass very pleasant to contemplate. To a large extent our literary manufactures'were still imitations of English   AMERICAN PRODUCTIONS OF THE 18TH CENTURY. 369 styles, with an increasing tendency to introduce Amer-     ! ican figures, in the patterns. The first literary effort    I was in hymn and psalm books.   The very first volume printed in this country was "The Bay Psalm-Book," published, of course, near Boston (at Cambridge) in 1640; rather slow in metres, but which, before 1750, had run through seventy editions, - run in fact so well and fast that, like certain plays now, it forgot how or where to stop. Singing-books, as an intellectual circu- lation, thus went to the American head, and, without blowing the matter too much, we may reasonably assume that this tendency set up the American nose as an instrument of psalmody.         . The first book of original poems was by a'woman,  Mrs. Anne Bradstreet.  The third edition came out in Boston in 1758. Besides this intellectual progeny, she had eight children; and to these latter she thus alludes in the printed issue:  "I had eight birds hatch't in the nest; Four cocks there were and hens the rest; I nurst them up with pains and care, Nor cost or labor did I spare, Till at last they felt their wing, Mounted thd trees and learned to sing." During the first half of the century, ecclesiastical and religious writings in all departments naturally      , took the lead, as in these American mind was left free. In this field roamed the two Mathers, father and son,  Increase, the first, but unfortunately not the last, who was created a D. D.; and Cotton, who committed nearly three hundred' and eighty-three sins in as many books, with which he loaded down the world, the great- east like its title, Magnalia. He made a partial atone- 16*               x   3-70 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ment in a few good treatises. 'In the same department wrought largely, -and with a "Freedom of the Will," Jonathan Edwards, of whom  Dugald Stewart said, "that in logical acuteness and subtilty he did not yield to any disputant bred in the universities of Eu- rope "; Samuel Johnson, the first president of Colum- bia College, and the father of that highly respectable family, the American Protestant 'Episcopal Church; Ezra Stiles, who delivered orations in good Latin, and found audiences to listen to them; Timothy Dwight, his successor as president of Yale College, whose "System of Theology" still claims attention, even among the acute researches of the bibliologists of our time, and whose four volumes of "Travels in New England and New York" give rare reading on express trains; Samuel. Hopkins, Joseph Bellamy, Williamn White, the first American bishop of the Episcopal Church, and whose sweet spirit perfumed eyen his controversial writings; Edward Payson, Joseph S,. Buckminster, and many others; of but few of whom it could be said; " that their works do follow them"-  to silence; for the churches still hold them in living honor. Political writings divided with the theological the public mind as soon as government became domesti- cated. In books like "The Federalist," Notes on Virginia," "'Discourses on Davila"; in speeches em- bedding constitutional argument; in treatises, tracts, and in all forms and ways known to type, many of the wise men of the Revolution, with James Otis, Josiah Quincy, Jeremy Belknap, David Ramsey, and others, spake out in varied logic, historical research,   AMERICAN PRODUCTIONS OF THE 18TH 6EN1URY. 371 wit, satire, and in captivating dialogue, discussing principles of government, political ethics, and social economy. In the natural sciences, Benjamin Franklin, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, Samuel L. Mitchell, and Count Rumford; in natural history, Cadwallader Col-   i den, Paul Dudley, John Bartram, and Alexander Wil- son; in history, William Stith, Abiel Holmes; among the singing birds, in the same tree with Anne Brad- street but on higher branches, Philip Freneau, John Trumbull, the author of "McFingal," Joel Barlow, who got up "Hasty Pudding," and survived "The Columbiad,"' and Joseph Hopkinson, who salutes us evermore in "Hail Columbia" ; and finally, in fiction, standing by himself, Charles Brockden Brown, whose nine novels in paper covers delighted our great-grand- mothers ;- all these were quite equal to the instruc- tion of their various, audiences, and might, had they lived long enough, written something - -perhaps sev- eral novels each -for the "New York Ledger." The last iproduction, whereof we shall speak, was that great American Joss, money, which was set up as an idol in many households, but which had not yet been installed in municipal halls, fashionable churches, and State capitals. Beautiful to the sight at first were its golden hands and feet, and almost kissable the wand which it drew before the glistering eyes of its frantic worshippers. Of course no one was believed then, any more than now, who called attention to the cruel steel knives which it hid in its dollar-embossed t]reast, and against whose sharp points he pressed those who yielded to his fatal embrace.   372 THE COMC H1STORY OF TIE UNITED STATES.

The thirty-five ballotings in the House of Representa- tives  between  Mr. Jefferson  and   Aaron  Burr made men  anxious, not   hungry  and    thirsty.  The fair-   3 74 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. minded Madison was appointed to the State Depart- ment; Albert Gallatin, the" golden-mouthed, to the Treasury; and Robert, not John Smith, to the Navy. Few changes were made in the ungilt places; although the innocent public of that day were not a little ex- cited, at, the bare suspicion that a few dozen Fed- eralists were removed for their political opinions. The guilt of differing politically from the administra- tion was not considered by the President so flagrant as to be adequately punished only by exile from office. Upon Mr. Jefferson must, however, be laid the crime of beginning the practice of sending to Congress mes- sages in writing, a beginning which, like the mes- sages themselves, seems to havel no end. Since the flood human life is far too short for these Presidential essays, even without the accompanying documents. A war with that dusky corsair, the Bey of Tripoli, clouded the very commencement of the new adminis- tration, breaking finally, after lasting three years, into a heavy shower, February 9, 1804,'from the cannon- ading guns of young Decatur's ship, the "-Intrepid,'- a shower followed by blue-skied peace. Commodore Preble, who, with his fleet had been dealing with Morocco, assisted in tanning, by some of Bellona's bleaching-powders, the sable-peltried Tripolitan. The result was that the Bey turned to another complex- ion in his treatment of Christian captives. In 1802 Ohio doffed the pantalets and appeared around the Union board as a full-grown State. Some of her settlements had grown so fast, and so threatened to absorb the land into building-lots, that it was feared   EMOCRACY IN POWER.       375 for a time that the surface would be, insufficient for farming purposes.  The exodus of population, far- ther westward, however, relieved the anxieties of its genesis, and marked the first chapter of its growth. The bivouac that had encamped on her grandly rolling rivers began soon to join the westering caravan which pitched their tents across the Mississippi against the sunsettings. A Hoosier who borrows money at two per cent a month to buy land with may be trusted to pay it back in a short time. Two to nothing that he will add from his generosity a bonus with the return of the loan. Bonaparte, now Consul for life, and in sore need .of money, sold to us, for $ 15,000,000, that tract of coun- try stretching undefinedly towards the Pacific, and called Louisiana. Some of the wits of that day raised the question whether the purchase lawfully included alligators of such length that they stretched over the boundary lines. Neither this great queskon, nor the  . secondary one of the right of our government to buy  foreign territory, was mooted in the Supreme Court, and thus we were spared an extra volume of majority - essays and longer dissenting opinions. The foreign ' pill was too sugar-coated to cause any wry faces. It    ! was a very big sell - for France. In July, 1804, Aaron Burr, Vice-President, murdered Alexander Hamilton at RHoboken. Some biographers have attempted, since the death of the future exile and : fugitive from  justice, to lighten the heavy burden which he carried for thirty-three years afterwards, but in vain. The public rarely reverses its first verdict.. They can seldom   be made to believe that its first   376 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. look at the piece was on lthe: wrong side, and no new napping or glossing will convince it that the other is the right side. The Presidency took such a fancy to Mr. Jefferson that, at his re-election, in 1804, he received 162 out of 176 votes cast ;C. C. Pinckney, Esquire, of South Caro- lina getting the other 14. South Carolina then had the pleasant little :conceit, of voting for herself,--a harmless pastime that kept up her peculiar idea of re- sistance to Federal subjugation, and made a variety for the tellers in counting the-contents of the electoral urn. During 1805 Mr. Eaton, the American consul at Tunis, made an agreeable arrangement with Hamet Caramelli, the legitimate but exiled Bashaw of Tripoli, for his restoration to his seat, badly filled by his broth- er; and to carry out the plan, he startead from Alexan- dria, in Egypt, in company with ,the sable Hamet, seventy American seamen and four hundred and thirty Arabs. After traversing a thousand miles- of desert. sands, he fought two severe battles, took Derne, the capital city of the chief province of Tripoli, and would have deposed the cruel reigning Bashaw, and opened the prison doors shut on hundreds of innocent Christian captives,--Eaton's principal object in the romantic expedition, - but for a hasty, jealous, and disreputable treaty got up between Tobias Lear, Consul-General of the United States, and the Bey, whereby we agreed to pay the crowned bandit $ 60,000 in silver, instead of in leaden pieces, for the ransom of our sailors en- meshed, like flies, in the old spider's web. The nation never liked that play of Lear. They :1   DEMOCRACY IN POWER.        377 . . always thought of this its principal act, with the Earl ':' , it of Kent:-                   " ;- -' ,i -. .

While the play of Lear was so badly acted on the shores of the Mediterranean, Michigan, toddling up from between the lake coasts that bordered her double peninsula, left her ancient name   of --Wayne County and the protecting hand of Indiana, and assumed an independent territorial statucs. - Her lymphatic tem- perament enabled her to suck up through her many aquatic ducts an arterial circulation which helped her to stand pretty successfully the dry-cuppings of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New   York.  In' straits often she has worked her way with moderate success through her Superior Lakes and water-courses to the open paths of seaboard trade.  The pictured rocks  of her great northern lake illustrate in lithography, rarely copied, some traits which she shares with no others. Fortu- nately for her future independence, the intervention   378 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. of Lake Michigan prevents her -territory from being laid out in city lots by Chicago. The American Cain, restless and uneasy, haunted by the pale ghost of Hoboken, set on foot in 1806 an ex. pedition designed either to slice off a piece of American territory west of the Alleghanies, and to. give it as a morceau to- Aaron the First, to be crowned at New Or- leans, his future capital; or to rid Mexico of a part of her troublesome northern possessions and to establish over it the dynasty of the Burrs. Tried at Richmond, Virginia, in 1807, before Chief Justice Marshall, he had the honor of being enclosed in the superb amber vase of Wirt's rhetoric for immortal preservation, but the misfortune to be dismissed on insufficient proof to the chained companionship of the Odreaded ghost. Bonaparte, tired of his consulate for life, and anointed Emperor December 2, 1804, by a priest whom he called from Rome to Paris for that purpose, known as Pope Pius VII., had raised against himself and his family pretensions the more ancient usurpers of Europe, whose equally bold seizure of the right to govern people, and to take their money whereon to live in ease, was -veiled and historically disguised by a few score years of unrighteous possession. Of course the ancient usurpers despised and made faces at the newest. Armies "composed of thousands of common people- farmers, mechanics, and poor laborers - pad- ded in bright-colored clothes out of moneys borrowed on their credit and to be repaid by their children, were hurled by these usurpers at each other at Ulm, Aus- terlitz, and Jena; and after the s-moke of the shocks rolled off, it was found that all the crowned graspers /1d   DEMOCRACY IN POWER.       379- were badly shaken up and shattered, and had- limped Away exceedingly hurt in pride and limb, excepting England only, which, mistress of the water by' the victory of Nelson at Trafalgar, in 1805, thrust her hated trident into the face of the master of the land. The sea-tossings of the combatants became profitable to our neutral commerce, which picked up out of the ports of each the articles needed by the other, and laid them down on the rival wharves. England had become too much of a trader and shopkeeper to see such results with complacency, even if, as a bel- ligerent, she could not participate in the dividends. And so, in May, 1806, she attempted to inaugurate against, France -in addition to actual hostilities - a paper blockade, by declaring, in a well-sealed and highly respectable looking document, about two thirds of the Continent of Europe, including the French territory and its dependencies, in a state of blockade. Without a blockading squadron to deliver this- docu- ment and to enforce the blockade, this declaration was an empty bravado, and a fraud on the rights of neu- trals. This dog-in-the-manger device to stop the trade it could not supply provoked the newest usurper to a like policy. Napoleon, equally blinded by his resentments, and equally unconscientious in his handling of international law, issued from Berlin a  counter document, also well sealed and incapable of de- livery, declaring the British Isles in a state of blockade. Without ships-those marine constables-to serve papers and bring offenders within maritime juris- diction, these orders and decrees became mischievous threats, making lawful trade piracy, and subjecting   380 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. neutral merchant vessels to arrest, detention, search, and condemnation. England now put fortih another pretension. As by the feudal lapv it wa held that "once a subject always a subject," of cowrse a fortu- nate Bull remained a Bull, even when seeking work or protection on an American vessel. American ships were thus required to stop on the high seas and be searched for truant English stock. Such a bull Eng. land might make of herself; but she was so angry as not to see that neutrals would not become such silly calves as to be driven off by these big-looking shouts. The question was sharply stated by the Leopard, a British man-of-war, to the Chesapeake, an American frigate, on board of which it was claimed were four British seamen. The refusal to permit the ship's hold to be looked into not pleasing the Leopard, she fell unexpectedly upon the little frigate  and tore the supposed bulls with horny claws out of the grasp of the American. The sight offended all America, espe- cially as it turned out that three of the four seamen were' American citizens. President Jefferson expressed the national resent- ment in a proclamation interdicting all British ships entering our ports. Great Britain made another bull by half apologizing and delivering up two of the four seamen. The lesson of the stamp duties had not illuminated the density of George III. He had not learned that half-apologies are confessions of wrong, but no atonement. 'Further experiments were mutually made by the two enraged fighters on neutral rights and interna-   DEMOCRACY IN POWER.       381  tional decencies. In November Great Britain forbade any one trading with France; and France,- equally  eniterprising, ordered the stoppage of all trade' with England. Our government replied to these illegal proceedings by an embargo on(All vessels in our ports, foreign arid domestic.

Much need was there of a judicious set of officers on the quarter-deck, as well as of a good crew in the:forecastle; for the Seventeen Sisters were about to lput thoea, with high storms blowing off and on the coast. -Much talk was there, as soon as Mr. Madison en- tered upon his duties, between British envoys, Mr. Erskine first and Mr. Jackson afterwards, on -the one ;side, and our Mr. Smith on the other, about our Non-  intercourse Act. - Of course the Britons did not like to have their own commercial cows gored by our bulls; although they had enjoyed immensely the sight of, their own unmuzzled Durhlams pushing wildly among- our young cattle. The British government - or, rather, ' their accredited agent, Mr. Erskine -promised to re- peal. the obnoxious orders in council. Taking the principals at their agent's word, our government good- naturedly proclaimed the renewal of commercial inter- course with England.

Ox '   384 THE COMC HrSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. In 1809 England had stationed cruisers off our coast to seize our merchantmen, and send them in as prizes to her ports. Every American ship-owner saw mosaicked- at the outlet of every American harbor the warning, cave anem, without being at liberty to stone the dog which flew at him. Bonaparte, blood red with Spanish and Portuguese victories, turning in cold, dynastic selfishness from the heart-faithful but child- less Josephine, and drawing to her place the reluctant, refrigerating Maria Louise, undismayed by the fear of our junction with the fifth coalition formed against him by England, Austria, Spain, and Portugal, imitated for a time the swaggering injustice of England towards us. In March, 1810, improving upon the Code Napoleon, by execution before suit, he decreed the seizure and summary condemnation of all American vessels enter- ing French ports. This boyish, pouting, and self-ex- tinguishing policy he gave up in November following. -England was left alone in keeping unneighborly mas- :tiffs. Meanwhile, in the midst of the effervescence of na- tional sediment thus foaming up in yeasty ebullition, Horace Greeley, February 3, 1811, fought into life. Ever since that successful contest, the world has ad- vanced with quickened forces. Benevolence felt rein- forced by combative intellect, which borrowed the club of logic and strong adjectives to persuade error to keep the ways of tribunitial thought. Soon after Mr. Greeley's birth, Mr. Smith gave up the State Depart- ment to James Monroe, who, for the three years fol- lowing, found ample employment for his executive abilities, in the double duties of this branch added to those of the War bureau.

It needed not the witch-hazel rods of the eloquent Clay, Calhoun, Langdon, Cheves, and others, to dip to and find the mines of national wealth and national feeling. Both were ready. At last, June 4, 1812, after the lapse of twenty-nine years, we found ourselves in a second wrestling-match with Great Brit- ain. Our first grapple was near Detroit; and on the Canadian frontier, where a defeat,.under Colonel Van Horne, and a success, under Colonel Miller, equalized losses and gains, thorough July and August.4- But the base Hull-sale surrender, without a blow, of Detroit, of an army of two thousand men, and the entire Territory of Michigan, by its cowardly or treacherous governor, caused our captain, officers, and entire crew to explode in very indignant terms. Colonel Lewis Cass, then commanding one of the regiments, snapped his sword' in two pieces, rather than surrenderit whole to the British General Brock. He took such an Anglo-phobia at this time, that the next fifty years could not cure it. Fortunately Wve had better hulls on the water than on the land. August 19, 1812, Captain Isaac Hull, in the frigate Constitution, fought the British Guerriere, and after knocking down every mast and spar and one third of 17             Y   386 THE, COMC rISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. her crew, compelled her to throw up the sponge. The mourning put on three days before for the loss, by General William Hull, of Michigan, and the army of the Northwest, was now put off for the bridal-wreath presented by Captain Isaac Hull to America, on her marriage to the sea. Like her spouse, the Ocean, the bride hastened to cast her weeds. The pallor of de- feat gave place to the summoned roses of joy. Upon the crimson flushes the British bees now sought to light and to extract their carnation.  In October, the British tars, in a Frolic, set out to tease the delighted groom, but a Wasp, hovering near,' made for the frolicsome bee, and in three quarters of an hour so stung it, that its shattered wings were only fit for microscopicaLstudies. All the officers and crew of the Frolic, four only excepted, were killed or wounded; while the Wasp, although carrying fewer guns, had only ten killed -or injured.  A few days afterwards the frigate United States, commanded by Decatur,- whom   we left eight years since before Tripoli, clearing out its wretched Bey, - engaged the 1 British Macedonian, and took such a fancy to her that, after some violent flirtation, she completely won her. This engagement went hard with the proud, stiff old people in England, but a repetition of this sort of match-making did much to reconcile them to the first. The second engagement took place on Pacific ground, off the coast of Brazil, between that old sea-flirt, the Constitution, looking out, not for coffee or sparrows, but for a marine flirtation, and the Java, a buxom frigate, long-waisted and well padded with materials, adorned with heavy war jewelry, constituting very at-   THE UNITED STATES AT SEA.      387 tractive charms, at her waist. In less than two hours  after their acquaintance, these ardent strangers became so entangled in each other's fortunes, that the Java gave up, like a true mistress, all her future to hler fond and persistent lover. When tne news ,of this wooing reached the stuffy old parents at home, they were fran- tic with rage. The family pride was alarmed and wounded. They immediately sent out a large fleet to watch that new and fashionable American promenade, the sea, to prevent any more flirtations and engage- ments like poor Guerriere's and the unfortunate Java's. Meanwhile Mr. Madison was re-elected Captain by one hundred ancLtwenty-eight votes; De Witt Clinton receiving eighllty-nine. Mr. C. C. Pinckney, now sixty- six years old, and convinced that his capital was too small, abandoned the business; and as Mr. Calhoun" Nwas yet only thirty, and constitutionally ineligible, ^ South Carolina was reduced to the humiliation of voting either for a Virginian or a New-Yorker. Notwithstanding hler successes on the water, America by no means abandoned the land. She raised and set on foot, although some of course, as usual, got on horseback, three armies. The first of these was the Army of the West, under General      ' William Henry Harrison, whose business it was made to chastise back into submissive quiet the Indian tribes, which England had enticed out to the pillage and harrying of our frontier settlers; a business which he successfully prosecuted at Fort 'Meigs, at Tippecanoe, and again, in October, 1813, at the Thames. At this last engagement somebody killed Tecumseh, and thus gave Colonel R. M. Johnson employment for the rest of, his   388 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. life in vindicating his right to the Shawnee's scalp. The red chief thus, like Homer and others, caused after his death more contention than during his life. Soon after the Thames battle, Gwperal Harrison re- paired to Buffalo, where, in consequence of some un- explained reason, -perhaps overcome by its vigorous Board of Trade, or seized by its enterprising forwarders, --he was transported into a resignation, and to Ohio. The second army was that of the Centre, under Gen- eral Dearborn, Jefferson's Secretary of War, and now Commander-in-Chief of all the forces deployed along the southern shore of Lake Ontario and the Niagara frontier. A portion of this army, in April, 1813, left -Sackett's Harbor, and landing at York, now Toronto, took hold of it, and, shaking it empty of British and Indians, left it so dry, that vigorous drinking since has scarcely sufficed to absorb back any considerable numbers of the brick-colored originals, although some- 'thing has succeeded in getting up very successful exhibitions of English red and white skins. While General Dearborn was absent from Sackett's Harbor; Sir George Prevost thought it a good time to sail in. He landed with one thousand men; but General -Brown, -a real, actual man, although disguised by this myth- ical name, - rallied the local militia, and, setting on the baronet and his thousand, took a large nurnlber of them, and held them as mutilated specimens of soldiers at leisure. General Dearbern soon after re- signed, and General Wilkinson - who had been tried and acquitted for his too great intimacy, while in com- mand at the Southwest, with the American Cain and his schemes - succeeded him; the only success that   THE UNITED STATES AT SEA.     389 he ever had, as he always had the ill-assorted habit of never agreeing or co-operating with any one, especially on critical occasions. Like a rocking-chair in moving time, he took up more room than could be spared, and was pretty sure to be broken when required for use. The third army was that of the North, placed under General Wade Hampton, grandfather of that leader of the Confederate black cavalry in the late Rebellion, who waded to his horse's bits in the blood of his loyal countrymen, in order to keep the black bipeds in the South bridled and saddled to carry the unwading Hanmptons. The army of the North, twelve thousand strong, was stationed on Lake Champlain, and was destined to co-opeate with Wilkinson's for the reduc- tion of Montreal, then holding only a small garrison of six hundred; but the mutual enmity of the gen- erals, growing out of old quarrels at New Orleans, frustrated all co-operation. Each drew himself into warm winter quarters, nursing his private grievances, as Mrs. Gamp did her special infirmities, while the poor unnursed, suffering patient, the campaign, took care of itself. Of course Montreal was not reduced, except to a satisfactory smile over the military pouting of the unco-operating commanders. The Secretary of War preferred charges against Wilkinson. The charges, as usual when touched by court-martials, went off in flashes in the pan. The campaign of 1813, rammed down with the double loads, the armies of the Centre and the North, went off in the same way. The United States were now more at sea on land than on the sea itself.'

Promoted to the Chesapeake, manned' or rather unmanned by an un- drilled, miscellaneous crew which had drifted on her decks, the brave Lawrence, counselled more by a chiv- alric honor than by a cool prudence, accepted the mur- derous, Burr-like challenge of the well-practised Shan- non, carrying a picked and veteran crew and corps of marines. The ill-handled, entangled, and' isabled Chesapeake was boarded, and the intrepid commander,. carried below with a' mortal wound, stammered out that immortal order which hurtles hotly- through histo- ries and navies, "Don't give -up the ship." On Lake Erie, Commodore Perry, in September, 1813, with a small squadron embraced and took a su- ' perior British fleet, announcing his resisted possession in another lively, well-planted -message, which float'  like a buoy in the crowded harbor of historical anchor- age, --"We have met the enemy and they are ours."

Forthwith' English  courts, English premiers, and English writers on interna- tiona I law bristled with freshy sharpened horror at; the sin of privateering, - a most un-Christian practice they averred, as it tended violently to abridge the ma- rine wealth of England.               .

As if to increase the wonders of this taking neighborhood, two days after the capture of Fort Erie, the battle of Chippewa was fought, in which bayonets were actually crossed, -a - rare checker-work, although often talked of in those select romances, the despatches of raw militia gener- als, who, in their first siglit of glancing steel and first smell of villanous saltpetre, see many things crosswise and crooked. Fifteen days later, Winfield Scott made a ghostly spectacle, at Lundy's Lane, of great numbers of well-seasoned British Regulars.

Meanwhile, the veteran English squadrons which had served under Wellington, in Spain and Portugal, glorified by victories over Ney, Massena, Marmont, Soult, and Joseph   Bonaparte, - their bullet-slitted flags inscribed "Torres Vedras," "Talavera," "Ciudad Rodrigo," "Almeida," "Salamanca," "Madrid," and "Vittoria," - mustering fourteen thousand men, and led by-Sir George Prevost, pushed down from Canada upon Platisburg, where General Macomb had assem- bled fifteen hundred men.

Like cedar   THE UNITED STATES AT SEA.    -393 / posts, these unseasoned troops stood rooted to the soil, stulbornly refusing to bend before the furious storm of grape and canister which swept through them for four days. While this heroic endurance was maintained on the land side, in front of the village and on the vitreous surface of Lake Champlain, Command- ant Thomas Macdonough, on the morning of Septem- ber 11, with a squadron of fourteen small vessels, carrying 86 guns and 850 officers arid men, anchoring inthe bay a   waiting the approach of a British fleet of sixteen ships, with 95 guns -and 1,000 men, so charged the common trading waters of the lake with soul-lifting influences, that even commerce seems to bear there its pennons more stiffly ever since, and or- . dlinary smacks to kiss the wind with a lover's trancing1 relish.  Worsted in square fighting, squadron to squadron, and vessel to vessel, the enemy -- not having the fear of this History before their eyes, and 'finding it easier to ha- rass unarmed merchantmen and to pillage unprotected coasts - ravaged the Chesapeake, burned the Capitol at Washington, - whose corner-stone had been laid by the great American himself in 1793,- and laid in ashes the President's house. Unfortunately, the Washing- ton MTonument was not yet begun; and thus by its escape made the destruction as unpardonable by taste as it was by the code of nations.

Souith, a descent: upon the city of New Orleans was finally planned by the British military commander, with fifteen thousand hardy and well-seasoned vet- erans, led by Sir E. Pakenham.  To- two thousand of them it was a sudden descent to Avernus. Their shades, on every recurring 8th of January, have since been vexed by the sad rites of oratory, poured out on every American stump and platform. Cot- ton for the first time was here invested with bel- ligerent rights, from its use by General Jackson and -\ his six, thousand troops as breastworks.] It has ever L since been roundly employed by American laies in ;,  the same way against their ardent admirers. The X result in the latter case, however, has usually been, not to repel but to heighten the vivacity of the attack; and, unlike that at New Orleans, to procure the surrender of the party with the cotton-works. The battle of New Orleans was fought in ignorance of the treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, signed twenty-five days previously, December 14, 1814, at Ghent, - an agreement which, like frequent make-ups of other quarrels, was wholly silent upon 'the questions which had caused the long and harassing contention. On these questions the lUnited States were left at sea. The war had cost thirty thousand lives and over $100,000,000; but we gained flags, fame, self-confi- dence, a fine crop of candidates, and subjects for speeches. Through the annealing flames we came out blue steel. During the December descent on New     Orleans,   THE UNITED STATES AT SEA.      395 delegates from five of the New England States took Hartford and used it to pass some resolutions against the mode in which, as they asserted, those States had been left out in the cold, bare and unprotected by the government. Many conventions have been since held at the same place and gathered up denunciations with characteristic American fervor; but this one has got  somehow   astride of history, and ridden it without' bridle or stirrups. In 1816 the second national bank was chartered, with a capital of $ 35,000,000, lifting the country from  suspension to specie payments. Mr. Calhoun, -its projector and the supporter of a high tariff, lived to denounce both. Mr. Clay and   Mr. Webster, his triangulating rivals, also survived to balance with changing faces the changed front of their Presidential-  competitor.  The strong heats of party, in all times and countries, bring out characters and -lines invisible before. In December, 1816, Indiana, the nineteenth State, came to Washington bearing in her hands a-maize-ing reasons for her admission. * .              CHAPTER VIII.

After the showery storm of Madison's aquatic epoch, rainbows came out in millennial blendings. Warm sun- shine lay upon  all the land.   Under it the happy family dwelt in peace. Federal and Republican inlaid the Cabinet. Virginia was satisfied withll the fourth President.  She had got her thirds.    The humble eighteen others believed in Virginia Presidents. They were content.  It was Solomon's reign of peace para- graphed between David's wars and Rehoboam's troubles.   THE ERA OF '00OD-WILL.     397 Five Territories took advantage of the open doors to step into family relations. Among -the five were -the three leading M's, Maine, Mississippi, and Missouri. Chicago - we mean' Illinois - took the year 1818 to enter. Of course Chicago had not yet begun, for in 1820 the census only showed 9,638,1911 ,- - ;. The keeper of the happy family was re-elected in 1820. There was only one vote against him,-a lit- tle mistake or eccentricity not worth inquiring into. There was a little shimmering over the calm surface for two years, caused by the application of iMissouri to bring slaves with her into the family. Of course Mr. Clay produced a. compromise as a settlement in 1820. Missouri was allowed slaves; but thereafter slavery was banned from all territory north of 36 30'. The bridle looked strong, when there was no horse. When the black charger was brought out and the bridle put on, it was found, however, that he leaped unchecked over the line. In 1819 Florida was bought from Spain for $5,000,000, and delivered to us in 1821. We got with it more than our bargain, -a Ilot of very sharp Indian toma- . hawks. To blunt them soon cost $ 30,000,000. The Dry Tortugas were thrown in. So were the Florida Keys. So were the alligators. Fortunately the night dews were left to prevent the peninsula from cracking off. Our Union is for better or worse. We took Florida in the era of good-will; we keep it for nothing.

Having little to do at home, our statesmen turned their attention to Venezuela and New Granada,   398 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. then fighting under Bolivar for their independence of Spain. Bravely they spoke up for the under cur in the fight; but more courageous still, the President, in his annual message for 1823, declared, as a principle, in spite of the crowds of colonists to our own ports, that no European nation had any right to colonize any territory on the Western continent, -a Monroe doctrine which, like the laws, is very loutd-spoken in peace, but very silent in war.

KIDNEY     SMTH   once said "that he was like an old razor,-  always in hot water or in a scrape." The term of the second Adams had similar agreeable} occupation. The water was very hot when this politi- cal blade was first thrust into it.  Mr. Monroe's double term   was so quiet, dozy, and apparently so long, that several gentlemen, outside of Virginia, felt that they were growing   old, and might, unless they  improved the chance, easily slip out of it. Besides Mr. Adams, there were, as candidates, General Andrew-Jackson of Tennessee, William   H. Crawford of Georgia, and Henry. Clay of Kentucky; among whom General Jackson re- ceived  the highest popular vote, and   Mr. Adams the next.  In  the House  of Representatives, the   ballot taken by States gave Mr. Adams 13, General Jackson       .                    z   400 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. 7,"and Mr. Crawford 4 votes. Eachl of these was a dragon's tooth, which was carefully sown, and pro. duced rank growths of sulphur-colored partisans, whose drifting seeds grew into poisonous crops all along the public roads. Pamphleteering became privateering on private reputation. Industrious falsehoods supplied for many years the warp of history. "' Si non e vero e ben trovato " was the maxim of in- genious and disingenuous fraud. Nursed and reared a statesman, Mr. Adams made a very poor politician. He could no more run his ever- cooling intellect and scholarly attainments into the curious moulds of party than he could make Q fit thle place of A. Worse far, he- had such a small organ for a heart, that it sent no blood to his cold fingers for hand-shaking. He had too much conscience to be popular with office-beggars, and not manners enough to go around in the country at large. He never stirred out of Washington, pat he did not tread on some one's foot. "James," said a father to his malapropos son, "you have only two faults; oae is, that you are good for nothing before breakfast, and the other is, that you are not a whit better after breakfast." So said of the un- partisan President. his political fathers, the heads of committees; and their opinion outhalanced in the scale the petty weights of general prosperity, peace at honme and abroad, a careful, scrupulous economy, that kept - the entire expenses of the government below thirteen millions annually, and a steady payment on the na- tional debt of seven and a half millions a year. The friendly blunder of appointing Mr. Clay Secretary of z Z   TROUBLES BUBBLE.        401 State 'was a political crime; the retention of those al- ready in office, political unrighteousness; the refusal to appoint clamorous partisans to paying places, ex- aggerated political depravity. History at last inscribes over the gateway of his term "Arabia Felix," over the place where popular misconception and partisan dis- appointment had hastily chiselled "Arabia' Petrea." ,   CHAPTER X.

General Jackson carried the defiant bravery of his campaigns against the Indians into the- white den at Washington. He disdained to cover the prehensile claws of new measures with the velvet sheath of offi- cial prudence. Over the eyes of schemes or institutions which he designed to scratch out he cast no glamour. During his eight years of civil campaigning, he stormed several forts that had become mossed by age through preceding administrations. His first care was to live off the enemy, the Adamites, whose Federal offices he took as forage for his own troops of friends , an example from  the military code which every suc- cessor, civil or uncivil, has unfortunately hastened to follow. Lord Palmerston once' declared "that Mr. Gladstone had not a command of language, but that language commanded him."    So it has resulted from- this tough, hickory precedent, that the offices now command the government. This campaign over, his next exploit was to quell an insurrection among the household troops led by Vice- President  Calhoun, Mr. Inghllam, Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Branch, Secretary of the  Navly, and Mr. Berrien, Attorney-General. These officers were soon cashiered and their places filled by Mr. McLane, Wir. Woodbury, and  Mr. Taney. The lily-white arm of a lady, lwhose social exclusion from the Calhoun set the vigorous  old warrior resented, moved the iron sinews of the hickory club which cleaned out the Sec- retarys' stables. The General next moved on the United States Bank,   404 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. up. whose slopes, although jagged with ores and hoary with: legislative fortifications, he rushed, carrying them at all points with a-coup de main. His first term, however, was made illustrious, .not so much by these destructions as by the first appearance of Chicago. This was in 1830. At this time, fortu- nately, the population of the United States had reached 12,866,020, and were thus saved from being overtaken and immediately annexed to that rapid and rapidly pushing place. This Northern cosmical event attracted less attention, however, because- the public mind was at last and about this time fixed upon the State of Mr. C. C. Pinckney, which, under the guidance of Mr. -Cal- houn, threatened to exclude the Federal hickory gov- ernment from its plantation, unless the Tariff Act;was repealed. The old military chief issued a public proclamation, asserting - his determination to execute the laws over South Carolina, and private threats to raise the main nullifier to a lofty post under the government. In- deed, he promised to some of his close personal friends, with ejaculations truly Jacksonian, to put him between two posts for the rest of his life. This was the first sprouting of the carefully engraft- ed scion of slavery upon the stock of State rights. Again, the Kentucky compromiser was ready with a harmonizing remedy, which scaled the tariff rates for the next ten years, and then planed them all down to the horizontal level of twenty per cent. South Caro- lina, lying, like Achilles, near her ships, professed to be appeased. Mr. Calhoun was saved his hempen eleva- tion. A/    THE AGE OF HCKORY.       405: The year following, 1833, Horace Greeley started in New York "The Morning Post," the -first daily paper ever projected, which lived only three weeks, and won- dered why it ever lived at all; "Whose all of life, a morning ray, Blushed into dawn then passed away." The Sacs, Foxes, and Winnebagoes, with tomahawks in their talons, and led by Black Hawk, swooped in hovering circles around the white chickens of Illinois; but were brought down by those practised marksmen, Generals Scott and Atkinson. The old Hawk was cap- tured, and shown through the United States in his drooping feathers. In Georgia, on the other hand, the whites were the aggressors, seeking to push the Creeks- and Cherokees from  their coveted possessions. The Indians fled to the Supreme Court of the United States, which bade Georgia restore the poor Naboths to their vineyards. . The Ahab sovereignty of that State resisted. The President refused to interfere. The nullification by Georgia of a decree of the Supreme Court, restoring Indians to their rights, was, in the eyes of the old' In- dian fighter, quite a different matter from the nullifi- cation by Calhoun-led South Carolina of an act of Congress. So far from being a hair-splitter, the General could not even see whole shocks, if the poll was long, straight, and black. - In 1835 arose another Seminole war in Florida, caused by an attempt on the part of the government to remove that powerful tribe, under a mock treaty, somewhere, nowhere, anywhere, so that it was west of the Mississippi, and away from pres- ent cupidity. On the  public debt, now   dwarfed to $ 291,089, this war was like an April shower.   406 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. Florida had the satisfactionfor the third time in six- teen years, of increasing the obligatiolis of the United States for, if not to, her. In this peninsular cam- paign, we obtained three celebrities to knob the flat surface of our history, - Generals Zachariah Taylor, Jessup, and Gaines,  gains compared with which the loss of life and lucre are not to be mentioned, except to stiffen our virtues by reproaching their sug- gestion.  The red tribes began sensibly to experience the truth of that sad tradition, which depicts their fate under the figure of a spirited bull, Manitou, which, chased from Cordillera to higher peak, across plain and river, ever westward, stands frequently on his reluctant retreat at ,bay, and tosses in vain from his frontlet the burning  spears whose arrowy flames the waters of the Pacific only can quench. After a pause of sixteen years, Arkansas, in 1836, strode, bowie-knife in belt, into the American camp. With Little Rock for its capital, it bids fair for the honor of sheltering the Pope when flung off from the Tarpeian at Rome. Its Saul-like Legares, having been struck down by miraculous lights since 1861, we shall probably see, becoming zealous Pauls, mending apos- tolic nets on the Red River, and preaching to the ig- norant worshippers of unknown gods, in the Athens of New England and the Corintli of New York. At threescore and ten, Old Hickory was trans- planted to the Hermitage. The merits and demerits of his administration, his political principles and his personal character, constitute still the Flanders of American parties, over which much hard swearing and   THE AGE OF HCKORY.               407       i   408 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. fighting are- still vigorously carried on.

All of his disappointed competitors watched him, as hounds the fox in his hole, ready for hot pursuit as soon as the brush showed from cover. A financial earthquake broke through the commer- cial crust the first year of Mr. Van Buren's term, shat- tering most of the crockery in the-great cities, and sputtering red menaces of ruin through almost every 18 3    "O THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. village and country store. In New York alone mer- chants toppled down amid heaps of indebtedness piled up to $100,000,000,--a respectable pile then, now scarcely worth failing for. To help up the depart- ing credit, the President recommended the sub-treasury scheme,- or separate chests for guarding the public moneys. Of course this expedient, like all financial measures, was Dutch to the people generally, who be- came more hopelessly anarchical by the interminably long messages, which aggravated their want of ideas, and somehow fretfully tangled their losing tempers and accounts.  A few defalcations among public officers chafed the popular mind to' an illogical but natural irritation. They looked upon the guard-houses of the national moneys, like an old man's residence, insecure from his broken gait and few locks. The dark phantom of slavery again flitted over the land, its dusky shadow disturbing the vision of commercial and political trad- ers. The President had, in his boresome in-augur-al, promised to his Southern supporters, in advance of Congressional action, to veto any bill forbidding slav- ery in the District of Columbia.  Petitions against slavery were laid under the table, while speeches in its favor were extremely fashionable. Mails at the South were opened for the discovery of antislavery papers. Politicians perfumed their handkerchiefs with extraits de I'Afrzique, and Northern merchants on the seaboard sold to the South their principles and goods at a profit. Still the great trader in the White House kept losing his capital. The new war with the Semi- noles created bad debts. A proposition for a stand- l   THE DUTCH REIGN OF MARTIN VAN BUREN.   4" ing army mined his credit. The sub-treasury scheme drained specie from the people into Federal pools.'

AT the time General Harrison was called from the clerkship  of  the County  Court  of  Hamilton County, Ohio, to preside at the People's High Assizes at Washingoton, he lived at North Bend, a very differ- ent crook from   that of his predecessor. He was sixty- eight years of age, and in feeble health; yet so seldom do  people die in desirable offices, that any life-insur-. ance  company would have    taken his life in a policy at the lowest premium. April 4, 1841, however, he died. Of course John Tyler, the Vice-President, did not.  To the subsequent regret of his party he   lived on a plane of his own, quite apart from    the platform  upon  which he was placed by them, and    bisected by a Virginia ecliptic so oblique   that it rarely touched  anything or anybody.   THE HARRISON-TYER TROUPE.     413 Mr. Clay and the Whigs tried hard and long to shape a bank bill to his amphibious tastes; but as they could not find a body, neck, or feet to suit the bill, they aban- doned the study of natural history as illustrated -by Mr. Tyler. A bank -some bank -he seemed desir- ous to have; because he entertained a profound con- viction that a bank was a good place to put a counter in. Like, the gentleman who possessed a first-rate flint, and wished a gunsmith just to fit a good breech, lock, stock, and barrel to it, the acting President seemed anxious, in 'his interviews with the Congressional banksmiths, to have them fit a good bank, vaults, specie, and circulation, to his admirable counter. As Cuvier objected to the definition of a crab given by the French Academy, namely, "that it was a small red fish which walks backwards," as "wanting three things to make it correct: first, that the crab was not a fish; second, that it was not red; and third, that it did not walk backwards": so the leaders of the party which elected him found equal fault with lr. Tyler as defining in his own. person the name of Whig on three grounds: first, that he was not a Whig in principle; second, nor in theory; third, nor in practice, . The original Cabinet members all resigned, except Mr. Webster, Secretary of State, who remained to complete in July, 1842, with Lord Ashburton, a treaty to disentangle our northeastern boundary lines and fish lines from the hard knots into which they were' running. A Bankrupt Act was thrown out by Congress in 1841, as planks for traders shipwrecked by the tidal waves which followed the earthquake of 1837; but   "4 THE COMC HSTORY OF -THE UNlITD STATES. the principal benefit of the act resulted in throwing the stranded fortunes to the official wreckers, called assignees in bankruptcy, 'who secured most of the stuff cast upon the shore. In two years this barbarous wrecking business was stopped by the repeal of the law. The principal event of Mr. Tyler's term was the successful trick, shown off in 1845 to 'the American people, by Mr. Calhoun, the new Secretary of State, by which' they were led into the belief that Texas was about to pass under an English protectorate. Stimulating the national antipathies and cupidities, he asked Congress, through Mr. Tyler, to secure the slave empire on the Rio Grande. The dark-lantern exhibi- tion was successful. Congress passed alternate reso- lutions, one opening negotiations with Mexico for the impracticable cession of Texas, the other providing for its practical annexation. These little State deceits, covered at the time with solemn diplomatic care, seem very pitiful when historically exposed in their pasteboard cheapness and  tinselled falsity. The Roman-like virtue of Mr. Calhoun was picked out with Carthaginian spots, and his white state toga shot with colored- figures, that will not stand the sun. While he would have scorned with his whole nature any individual fraud for the personal gain of a fortune, he was, like so many other politicians, neither above nor below being more than sharp at a party bargain.

ITHE     committee  of the American   people, in  No- vember,   1844,  designated   new  floor-managers for the coming season of four years. With Washington     and John  Adams the nation had had  the old-fashioned, respectable country dace; the up  and down, square, staid    figures, moving through the  rhythmic performances    and retiring with marked dignity. Then came the Virginia reel, led by Jeffer- son, Madison, and     Monroe, with  the  same partners throughout.   The   Quincy  waltz followed,  ending  in   POLK'S WHRL.        417 a dishevelled gallop, when the heated dancers were led off to chilling ice-creams and whipped syllabubs. This was succeeded by a long puzzling Irish jig, under Jackson, with a lively and frequent change of part- ners and a passionate mixture of feet, heads, and ball- room dresses. A Dutch hornpipe led a, select party through the mazy solemnities, and intermixed fan- dango advances and retreats which characterized the Van Buren schottishe. Then came the quick-footed cachuca, performed by the Harrison-Tyler -troupe, ending in a South Carolina shake-up, where the darkies were the principal performers, although Cal- houned white men promoted the dance and took the profits of the abundantlyfpatronized bar. The floor was now cleared for the polka, an extremely spirited, gyrating series of figures, in which the main object was to balance, by rapid dodges and double-shuffling whirls, the forcibly acquired colored partner, named Texas, with the new incoming free State arrivals. The sets were soon formed. President Polk was of course head manager, having able assistants in James Buchanan, carrying a stately variegated black and white rose; Robert J. Walker, his button-hole adorned with a gold-colored treasury ribbon; William L. Marcy, resplendent with a broad crimson war-sash across his broad chest; George Bancroft, in a navy-blue uniform, open in front for the ready exit of his never-ceasifng orders; Cave Johnson, in mail attire; and John Y. Mason with his narrow cranium   transfigured by a, straitened cross-barred attorney's cap. Southern men, North and South, stepped eagerly forward to join in the popular dance. 18*         .   AA A   "8 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. General Taylor, a modest young man of- sixty-one, was directed by the managers to make an advance, with a party clothed in the United States military dress, to a place on the large floor, chalked out be-- tween the Neuces and Rio Grande, with a hint not to be offensive in his attitudes, but to look as disagreeable as he chose; and that if anybody, espe- cially the blanketed Mexicans, who insisted on having that part of the large ball-room exclusively to them- selves, sliould give him any chance, however small, to fall foul of them, ball or no ball. When one is de- sirous of a quarrel he is not usually, especially at the Southwest, long kept out of the enjoyment. In April, 1846, General Ampudia and General Taylor chanced to touch each other, and off went the chip from the American shoulder. Of course everybody who at the North sold goods to the South, and every one at tohe South who possessed a colored brother in fee- simple, was indignant about the chip, which for the time conveniently represented American honor. The national gorge and the price of negroes rose simultaneously, Fifty thousand men and $ 10,000,000 were voted by Congress to iron out the creases made in 0 our flag. Of course the young man of sixty-one soon got into the adobe-colored tumble which was impatiently expected. May 8, 1846, with the aid of 2,300 men, he tripped up General Arista with 6,000 men, at Palo Alto, and the next day fell violently.. against him at Resaca de la Palma. The chopfallen Mustangs, pick- ing up themselves and their dirtier blankets, made all haste to get out of reach of the rough-and-ready treat- ment, and sped across the Rio Grande to Monterey.   POLK'S 'WHRL.        419 But the young man, excited by the jerking mazourka     i' step into which the dance now broke, grasped'his part- i' ner, the army, around the waist, and flung across the   i! opening spaces against the frightened Mustangs at      X Monterey. It was a hard shock, and, of course, the     i sorry-visaged Mexicans were hurled against the wall. The floor managers for some reason - some unchari- tably thought from envy at seeing the modest young man attracting so much admiration - took away his partner, and sent it off with a younger man, General    i Scott, then only sixty, to another part of the room. The figures which he cut with his set of twenty thou- sand at Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, National Bridge, Churubusco, Contreras, Chapultepec, and city of Mexi- co, were waltzed with unflagging energy.'+ Meanwhile, the young man Taylor, left with only 4,759 raw troops, was set upon in February, 1847, at Buena Vista, by Santa Anna and 22,000 well-baked Mexicans. The South American Warwick left 1,500 men, his carriage, traveling equipage, and the ,best part of himself- his wooden leg -upon the field, and with the fragments escaped southwards. Almost sim-  ultaneously new-comers were seen flying, in move- ments more or less effective, across the room,--Gen- eral Wool, with 2,900 men, at San Antonio; General Kearny, at Sante Fe, New Mexico ; Captain John C. Fremont and Commodore Sloat, in California; all per- forming feats which brought murmurs of applause even from trans-sea critics. At last the Mexicans gave out, tired and glad to ap- ply to their wounds that Mustang liniment, the treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo, mixed up March 2, 1848.   420 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE .UNlTrED STATES. :New Mexico and California were, by this treaty, added, with eight hundred thousand square miles, to our westering borders. Henceforth the Rio Grande babbled a bi-lingual story to the Saxon Americans on its right, and the mezzo-tinted, mezzo-clad Mexicans on its left. The path of civilization, whose sun-lean- ing course through the centuries, from Assyria to America, is not unfamiliar to Americans, was now se- curely macadamized by Yankee pavers to the Pacific. The, Atlantic slopes, of course, were easily turned westward, and their readily manufactured fruits rolled down into the Mississippi basin, and over its heaping rim beyond. Revolvers were boxed and transported in increased quantities to the Southwest, to supply the. judicial demand; as every man who takes up govern- ment land is liable to sudden litigations, where the trials revolve quickly, and cast with fatal speed one of the litigants.' The wonderful vegetation of this newly opened region, gorgeous in tropical luxuriance, was for a few years made more remarkable by the human fruit- age, which not unfrequently hung suspended with impressive weight from the pendulous branches. For- tunately these productions are short-lived. They are but the morning mists that-hide for an hour the mam- moth sierras and wide-armed plains, that nurse conti- nents and- centuries to mainly vigor. The little Calhoun trick had, quite unexpectedly to the wizard of the South, conjured up,- not a few paltry African patches grinning with ghastly spectres, chained in the linked dance of death,- but broad empires brim- ming soon with stalwart men and women. Calhoun proposes, but conscience disposes.  g .   POLK'S WHRL.        421 f ^M         \              ;T f *    cc-1 f 4 , t-   422 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. The yellow-fever broke out, soon after the treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo, in our new Californian posses- sion, carrying off people, not thence, but thither. By the side of palace hotels, now gleaming along golden bays; solid warehouses, through whose opened doors show the well-stored sheaves of Continental harvests; settled industries that spike the land with -stacks, vine- yards, mills, and spired villages ;: palace cars which in a -week have blazoned their luxurious splendors through solitudes threaded only a few years ago by the danger- ous blazed track; and giant steamers wading the Pacific  Sea, and carrying to the Mongolian empires of the Orient a staggering back-load of American products, by the side of these actual marvels, even a score of years has made the contrasted early life of the gold adventurer, gambling in revolver-furnished tents, dan-' gerous. night brawls,- and rude visits of vigilance com- mittees, a theme for romance and its twin ally, history. It had taken nearly three centuries since Sir Thomas Drake proclaimed California the ward of Elizabeth, for the North American boy to acquire sufficient courage to touch her virgin lips, and claim her in happy wed-  lock. Our New Mexico brought immediate and national disturbance. Slavery there was considered objection- able by many; and as soon as Territories were proposed to be carved out of those wide. limits, the Wilmot pro- viso, to exclude slavery from it, arose at the expected Calhoun feast like Banquo's ghost, and, disturbing the revel, followed with reproachful look almost every American statesman. It strode into the Democratic Convention at Baltimore, which nominated Lewis Cass,   POLK'S WHM L        423  and sat alongside of the shivering president and secre-  li taries. It stalked into the Whig assemblage at Phila-   15ii delphia, which took the young man for its candidate,   ; and troubled its peace. Finally, it flitted to Buffalo,- i:  and made its appearance at a mixed gathering which presented Martin Van Buren, - now the political friend of the ghost,-: with just the ghost's chance for the Presidency.  And so the ball and polka party turned out very     Hi much as other balls. Those who had expected a great   -ii deal from it did not enjoy it much; while4 those who had no hand in getting it up had a good time, ate the   i most supper, had the least headache the next mormng,    i." and often spoke of it afterwards with pleasurable rec-   I'! ollections. Among the former were Mr. Calhoun,  Mr. Polk, and the floor committee; among the latter the modest young man, now sixty-five years, of age,  John C.- Fremont, several people who did not part     i their hair in the middle, and a growing set who were -    O!F friends of those who could not divide their crinkled,    i hair as yet either way or any way. j       - '              .     }lt] j .

It had gathered American history enough   NINETEENTH CENTURY ON AMERICAN HALF 4HELL. 425 to be served up in every style to its hungry, impa-     [ tiently waiting crowds of customers.  There was still plenty of it in the raw; heaps of i, materials swimming in abundant liquor; common work     i at rough, resisting nature, bivalved between the ordi- nary shells of laborious days and unwaking, sono-      i rous nights; good honest-minded rough-handed labor, -il swinging the axe among Western settlements, and       i pricking gold, silver, and lead veins, and draining     i off their arterial currents into"Atlantic bowls,;' shaggy- . i jacketed enterprise, brave in work, in patience, and    i cheerful endurance, quelling the rebellions of empty    i stomachs, - those quickly rising, wrathful, and speedily  i! armed revolutionists,- and subjecting them to serve    I, while the wheat ripened, and to wait upon a nourish- ing hope; and ploughmen planting boad and newly claimed fields with tasselled- banners, and marching with their sheaved battalions to take growing towns     - and marts of business.

There, too, were heaped up and ready for the grill, and for tastes more refined, capital, massing itself into cen- tripetal, compacting, aggregated wealth, touching large levers that swing inflowing products from port to port, across wide-reaching inland spaces, or over high moun- tains; multiform industries translating and exchange- ing, without parallel, the growths of every parallel; and associatedearnings of diligent thrift, extracting the best notions from hard,-quartz-headed mountains. There was vivid and intelligent joint enterprise, which plunges- beneath the waves, and places the sensitive nerves of  thought below the gambols of the leviathan, for the.  especial benefit of gamblers in bonds, cotton, gold, and stocks; pries open the shut gates of science, and en- tices her occult learning to minister to the enlarginga demands of commerce, agriculture, manufactures, and   NINETEENTH CENTURY ON AMERICAN HALF-SHELL. 427'     0 trade; sets in motion the steel fingers which pick, cull, card, spin, and weave the cotton, flax, silk, and wool, whose fabrics clothe us through all seasons; quickens the spindles, machines, and contrivances - busy every- where-which create our necessaries and our luxu- rious comforts; drags our fuel from the tight clutches of the mine; adulterates our food, and drinks; sews up our vestments and sometimes our investments, and supplies our dwellings with furniture, our stores with goods, our fields with mowers, reapers, stearm-ploughs, and steam-impelling implements, and our grave-yards with monuments, hewn by machinery and chiselled by the nimble fingers of patented tools. Historical stews, too, those fifty years had, of course, produced in abundance; some flavored with British, others with French sauces. - Domestic ones, too, had simmered and sputtered; but, stirred by bayonet- shaped spoons, they had so far gone off in smoke as to leave only an insipid taste on the homely palate of our peace-loving household. Of these were the Whiskey Insurrection in Pennsylvania, and Dorr's Suffrag":-Re- bellion in Rhodes Island in 1842, made of very poor materials, and smothered with a rude domestic bread sauce, which, more like a poultice for the outside than a relishable compound for the inside, soon took away the vicious appetite. Indeed, since the Great Rebel- lion which severed the long threads that tied us to Great Britain, no insurrections have ever had any suc- cess in America. 'Sharp newspaper dmeutes, looking like imminent war, yes; sectional animosities threat- ening, like the' South Carolina chattering of 1832, to embroil a piece of us, yes; State grievances, bubbling--    428 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. up with heated convention resolves, until the steam of revolution almost arose from the agitated surface, yes, and often; and, to quote an example since 1850, even a land-wasting war of four years, reducing large plantations to cinders, and leaving in funereal gloom many hopes and households,--even this, yes; but a genuine, earnest, well-founded, and just revolt, rising from wrongs and oppressions, and appealing to armed manly protest, and resulting in deserved success, never, never! Upon the half-shell' were served some remarkable mechanical inventions. Water raised into steam was, in 1806, applied by Fulton to propel the first steam- boat over water; an. application never contemplated by the Constitution, but which, in spite of the many pri- vate constitutions suddenly broken up by it, the appall- ing increase in American biographies, and the wreck of matter thrown upon life-insurance reserves, must be kindly remembered as one of the great benefactions of genius to humanity.  In 1832 Samuel F. B. Morse discovered the mode of electro-magnetizing thought, and of ticking down words at places where thoughts were seldom spontaneously produced. The wiry tele-  graph is daily bringing to light other incidental dis-: coveries, which show how great benefits sometimes pendulate with petty remorses. There are developed at most stations a class of people, formerly unknown,  and called "operators," who believe that small acci-  dents, in places unrewarded by thd notice of geogra- phers, are national; that the births, deaths, or marriages of owners of petroleum, fast horses, or other rapid stock, concern all readers of newspapers; that the time, age,   NINETEENTH CENTURY ON AMERICAN HALF-SHELL. 429 and pedigree of quadrupeds, kept for jumping long spaces in a short time, and the weights of bipeds, sent to college to acquire an increase of their intellectual strength, but who punish instead an ash stick some four hours a day, by sweeping with it some frog-pond in the vicinity, are vital statistics; ard that the election of constables, supervisors, aldermen, mayors, and members of Congress are matters which every intelligent patriot, instead of banishing from all recollection as speedily as possible, desires to have forced upon his journalistic readings. If Morse started, re-morsei has often fol- lowed after, the telegraph. In 1833, one Hussey, from Cincinnati, improving upon hints glinting out through agricultural books and poems from the time of the Romans, perfected some- what a mower and reaper, which, as since bettered by Manny, Ketchum, and McCormick, has made such quick work with our meadows and grain-fields, as to break up all the delicious reveries into which pictu- resque men in them, and sentimentalists over books representing them, formerly indulged.  Gone is the mower's scythe, now nicked into the quick-sliding saw which eats in a day through acres of grass andolden- bloomed wheat.  Gone, Ruth-lessly, the maidens in broad hats, turning with a fork the low-lying clover, and with their eyes the uncut young Timothy, ever near at hand. Vanished from American harvest-fields the whistling grain-gatherers, driven from  sight and pictorial illustrations by a single hussy. During the half-century, too, was set up that useful American music-box, the sewing-machine, - a box that now sings joyful songs of shirts, frills, pantaloons, and    A430 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. vests, in all airs, flights, and stories. In 1846 the ap- plication of ether to lure pain into insensibility was first discovered. The honor is contested between three Americans, an honor large enough to be divided up, and a third given to each; but as each naturally covets the exclusive claim, the retort-like monument to per- petuate the discovery must be inscribed, to ether. At the middle of the century populations had begun to gather into city centres; 515,547 in New York; 340,045 in Philadelphia, 169,054 in Baltimore; 136,881 in Boston; 116,375 in New Orleans; 115,436 in Cin- cinnati ; 77,860 in St. Louis; and in Brooklyn, un- scared by German invasions, 96,838. Chicago,with just a score of years, had more than a score of thousands; but its frequent doublings since have run up so many scores, that the sum leaps the bars of all arithmetics, save its own. Since it has taken to drinking out of Lake Michigan, and begun to draw upon the Atlantic and Liverpool, our calculations have become so drop- sical that nothing but tapping can save them. With greater wealth had come, of course, into Amer- ica greater variety of aspirations, tastes, modes of dis- play, versatility of social invention and experiment. Most of our-leading public men had lived long enough to have as many principles as they could number de- cades, as many heads as the hydra, as unlike each other as in cheap-weeklies, and yet at one period or another a faithful likeness. Good-natured voters, who could recall twenty years of ballot experience, could remeniber a vote given for and against almost- every Whigand Democratic chief.

Plutocracy, of cdurse, also, got larger Josses and re-gilded their shrines with many fantastic patterns. Fashions enlarged  and contracted, through the five decades, with every east wind from Paris; and Amer- ican men, women, and children hastened to change the boots, hats, and vestments, so lovely and so much admired before the last arrival, with the same alarm after the new mode was out, as they would have doffed a garment that had encased a cholera patient.

The stormy petrels of disaster had frequently ap- peared over the fluctuating sea of our commercial life, covering it in 1837, and in every few   successive epochs since, with its screaming, ill-omened, harpy brood, while fleets and single vessels .of mercantile adventure broke up and lined the shore- with their shattered wrecks.- Then as now the owner sometimes turned wrecker of his own cargo, and often made more   4:32 -TG OMC tSTORY'OF THE UNI'TED STATES.   NINETEENTH CENTURY ON AMERICAN HALF-SHELL. 433  from the stranded pieces than he would have netted from the entire cargo had it arrived safely in port; as the expected payment of its purchase price would then have reduced the profits. This species of mercantile salvage, by which the proprietor profits by his losses, although not unlnown to the traders of Carthage, has had an extension in modern days, that threatens to put merchandizing among those equivocal ventures, which puzzle casuists in cases of conscience, and often defy even the doctrine of chances as to the pay- m ment. The discovery, in 1848, of gold in California be- stowed upon America the Midas-touch it had fer- vently prayed for. Gold, sweated from the pores of labor, was sprinkled in a dusty shower upon the head of beauty, dropped in bars upon the scales of the veni- dors of dry goods and wet goods, filmed the eyes of marriageable girls with an aureous ophthalmia which indisposed them to see any desirable wedding unless it i was golden, and so veneered the duties and chairs of railway directors, members of the legislature and of Congress, with a yellow smearing, that nearly all bills, resolutions, or orders have refused to dip into or drink from any stream but Pactolus. Many homes, how- ever, through that half-century, we are happy to say, unwatered by the curse of that thirsty stream, had taken root and sent up solid shafts whose numerous branches bloomed with bountiful clusters, while sweet- smelling vines, springing alongside the family trees from the roots of the simple love-knots, spread a pro- tect ing shade over many a family roof-tree. Curiously enough, Midas always 'had a spite against 434 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. children, which grow up thickest among heaps of clam- shells and on poor side-hills. Into our flowering ecclesiastial garden, planted with every known variety, and exhibiting large and vigor- ous growths, Joseph Smith--a Vermont simple- introduced, in 1827, a new shrub. It bore at first a double Mormon flower-looking tip, distributed in pretty equal numbers on its deep-green, sucker-like shoots; but transplanted first to Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1838, and ten years later to the. alkaline soil of IUtah, it im- mediately bore the female variety in alarming dispro- portion. This Salt Lake shrub - of the genus polyga- Ious - has become by cultivation a very rank weed, smelling earthily to heaven. Its numerous Young off-shoots require severe cutting, if not,distinct sub- soil treatment. 'Architecture at last began to raise its tasteful fronts, Elizabethean, Gothic, Italian cottage, or American composite, set in trim yards or on  smooth-shaven lawns, netted and webbed by paths and walks. On headlands, fringed with sea-wave ruffles; in valleys gladdened by the smiles of brooks and rallied into hap- py, healthy, joyousness by the outhursting frolicsome hills that cannot hold in their peculiar humors; on the sloping banks of many rivers seaward running; and on bossed and tufted hillocks where the pines, spruces, and larches hang aloft through  all seasons their graceful flags, tasteful residences :with clustering out- houses, sheltered thrift, corralled the domestic wealth which Midas cannot buy, and resounded with whoops that brought out other hoops in turn. Farmsteads had steadily added improvements, amplified their breadths,   NINETEENTH CENTURYON AMERICAN HALF-SHELL. 435  changed their white coats into colors more harmonious, and gathered around them well-adjusted farm build- ings, and in their neatly fenced yards- better stock, quadrupedal, bipedal, feathered, furred, and scaly. Under improved- cultivation our two national farms -the sea and land-produced, in 1850, crops that weighted the census heavily: The former showed 1,360 new American-built vessels, carrying 272,218 tons; and the latter bore a growth that year of 53,000,000 pounds of wool, 100,000,000 bushels of, wheat, 592,000,000 bushels of Indian corn, 813,000,000 pounds of cotton, 14,000,000 tons of hay, grown on farms valued at $3,300,000,000,' upon which were used implements costing $153,000,000, and stocked with live animals valued at $.544,000,000. But while American hands were thus busy through the half-century, American heads were not idle or unproductive. Of course in numbers political writ- ings led, as political discussion is the intellectual bread and butter of Americans. Histories of many of the States -of Connecticut, by Benjamin Trum- bull; of Pennsylvania, by Robert Proud; of New England, by Hannah Adams; "Annals of America," by Dr. Abiel Holmes, father of the many-tongued, myriad-sided Oliver Wendell, and others -gathered up the variously colored skeins of the busy-fingered past; while lives of eminent, statesmen- Patrick Henry's, by the accomplished Wirt, laus laudato viro; of Co- lumbus, by Irving, himself a discoverer of new worlds in America; Washington's, Franklin's, Adams's, and others, by Jared Sparks; and a long catalogue of others-presented pictures of rare personal daring,   436 ,THE- COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. heroism, patriotism, learning, and worth, set in choicely carved and polished frames. Investigations in, and sketches of, our physical geography' and of the natural history of our flora, fauna, reptilia, fishes, and birds, by Professor Barton, Alexander Wilson, John J. Audubon, Samuel L. Mitch- ell, Timothy Flint, and kindred minds, brought out, in lights as brilliant as our October sunsets, our wide surfaces, and the objects crawling, flitting, -or flyingg upon and over them. In sacred literature, theology, and polemics, Samuel Miller, Edward Robinson, Moses Stuart, William Ellery Channing, Francis' Wayland, Nicholas Murray, the Wares (father and son), Theodore Parker, the Alexanders, George Bush, Edward Beecher, and, a:marshalled host of others, upheld by logical force and with learned or lively dialectics the cher- ished views of their various sects.

In general literature our hemisphere sparkled with fixed stars, like Irving, Prescott, Story, the Everetts (Alexander and Edward), Cooper, Motley, Ticknor, Bancroft, Paulding, Hawthorne, Hillard, Wilde, Legare, and uncounted 'more, which lit it up with beautiful lights, that blent their flames with the soft poetic rays of Bryant, Longfellow,.

Still, there was a very lavish spread, out of which a reasonable . foreigner or an un-Europeanized native might pick a good deal, before he churlishy finished his meal on vinegar, or pettishy gave himself up to sugared water.

Already, however, the apple of discord, or    rather a whole barrelful of very red-faced Spitzenbergs, mixed with meal-colored russets, had been   emptied into the Union, and   rolled over the floor of Congress.   The acquisitions, gained from Mexico by arms and the treaty of 1848, including the new gold weights handed up  by California, -disturbed the adjustments of Mr. Calhoun's patent balances, which    only worked  well when a colored State was put on one side at the same moment that an uncolored one was put upon the other,   "O THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, -an operation about as difficult and just as natural, as that which regulates the number of children in a family to the number of bushels of wheat grown in any season, or to the number of windy days in the year. In 1850, three Territories pressed for admission as States, each carrying some of the fatal apples; Cali- fornia, with a Constitution excluding slavery; New Mexico, formed out of Texas, but disputing with her a boundary line; and Utah, then called Deseret, taking in all the women which could be drawn thither, and, by the aid of its dry air, absorbing them into the Smith -and Young families. Texas herself, admitted into the Union in December, 1847, always swaggering with a rapier in her belt and a patch over her eye, bullied New Mexico lustily on one side, so as to make lustier claims upon the United States on the other,- a cock-eyed way of shooting that made one barrel with two diverging eyes over the sight do the work of a double-shooter. Petitions from the North for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and from the South for a more stringent fugitive-slave act, rolled very large Spitzenbergs and russets on the floor of Congress. Looking from  the legislative galleries upon the newly arrived heap, a Western stroller might have asked of his comrade, as the freshy landed Irishman demanded of his countrymen, at his first sight of a tortoise walking about, "Be these live snuff-boxes common in these America; be they or be they?" and might have received a like answer, "Be asy, and look on I tell ye, for I dunno's they be, and I dunno as they be." \       *      ,       '   THE BEGINNING OF -STRIFE.     441    ! Suddenly, however, Mr. Clay's old established omni-   - bus, belonging to the compromise line, - which gener- ally took up all the passengers, rejoicing at their good luck, although apt to set them down very discontented at the end of the way,- drove in to carry off in one load all of- these fretting, complaining subjects. Just at this time, July 9, 1850, the large-hearted but short-headed President died, and the polite and urbane Fillmore, ( Washing his hands with invisible soap, In imperceptible water," stepped out on the balcony, and, bowing suavely to- wards the driver and the quarrelsome load, begged Mr. Webster, Mr. Corwin, Mr. Crittenden, and other by- standers, to be good enough to assist in getting the carry-all and the disagreeable objects that kept so many people awake o' nights, out of Washington. It was not until September, however, before the tightly crammed vehicle was started, carrying California in a State suit, unattended by a colored servant, New Mex- ico, and Utah as Territlorial passengers, with the liberty of having bronzed property or not along with them, slavers taken out of the District of Columbia never to return, a chest containing ten million dollars for the State with a patch on its eye, and messengers to the Northern free States, informing them  that hereafter they were to break up all underground railroads, and to 'send-stray Southern baggage, without its owners, back whence it had departed.      I  ,Of course everybody was dissatisfied, ept Wendell Phillips, J. Davis, and their following,- the ascend- entalists and descendentalists, - who, sincere devotees 19'*    "2 THE COMC'HSTORY' OF THE UNITED STATES. for equality and inequality, found a novel pleasure in having new stand-points, from which they could each look up to or down upon, a grievance large epough for thought, speech, and action. The political nurses, of course, thought that the pare- goric had forever quieted the crying evils; but wiser people foresaw that these attempts to get remedies for wide-awake consciences and interests out of a Con- gress-water bottle were just as idle as the conjurer's trick to obtain whiskey, wine cordial, brandy, and milk- punch from the same nozzle.( In 1851 Louis Kossuth, brought over from Turkey, whither he had escaped from Hungary in a national ship, put forth, immediately on his arrival here, a very short catechism, which comprised a single question and answer. "Q. What is the chief end of Americans? s.. To fight Austria evermore."  I After spending most eloquent commentaries upon this brief compendiumof duty, in which he braided newly spun English words and upbraided American indiffer- ence, he abandoned the missionary field, leaving a large Kossuth party, but a very small body of proselytes to Kossuth's gospel. In 1852 we obtained an immensely large piece of japanned ware,- a Japanese treaty bargained for by Commodore Perry, - a piece which seems to grow larger the longer we look at it. The death of Mr. Clay in June, 1852, and of Mr. Webster inl October following, left, like the touch of frost in autumn, a dying glory to the troubled and storm-swept season vhich had just passed over Amer- ica.   - HAPTER XVI.

Although by ordinary reckoning but      2  , forty-nine years old when, in March, 1853, he came out of New Hampshire to be President of the United States, he must have lived--so they assert --some- where through several previous existences and brought along with him  the last time the cherished notions of the first. Certainly he was as much of an anachro- nism   as a two-handled  plough, dragged by a yoke of   "4 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. oxen,-contrasted with a steam  one driving its hot shares through dissolving acres, an undecked Roman trireme rowed against an iron-breasted monitor armed with the heaviest modern gun, or an old-fashioned scythe in comparison with a mower. His ideas of government were scant for a good-sized town, and of slavery so patriarchal, that a Red River planter might have taken several lessons from him with great profit. Slavery at that time, like the colossal statue of Apollo at Rhodes, stood with its two feet widely apart. Its right was planted in the commercial cities of the North, covered with a huge stocking of North- ern manufacture; its left, spread out like Sambo's, all over the Gulf States, was carefully enwrapped with raw cotton. Between its wide-spread legs Mr. Pierce, like an ancient mariner, sailed into the harbor, and cast out an anchor, forged at Baltimore, or it may be at Nineveh, with an inscription on its best fluke, "No agitation about slavery." It might as well have been inscribed, "No more thinking." He asked several elderly gentlemen to help him have a good quiet time: William L. Marcy, with the portfolio of State; James Guthrie, incubating the snug':- little Treasury nest; Jefferson Davis, with the appropri- ate red-lettered War rifle; Caleb Cushing, holding the Attorney-General's fools-cap brief; Robert McClelland, bringing an oaken inlaid table for .the Interior; and James Campbell, an old-fashioned letter-weigher. They expected to have a good antediluvian time of it, as Mr. Clay's compromise carry-all had transported into the wilderness the bad-looking lot which had   THE UNION PIERCED.   -  -44:5- broken into the peace of the gentlemianly Fillmore. Mr. Buchanan was sent away to England, and some restless engineers somewhere toward the Pacific,--a pleasant-sounding place far away out West, -to get up a report on a railroad which might amuse the young people to read in the long winter evenings. Suddenly, however, all of these serene prospects were clouded. The great shield, constructed by the Democratic Convention to hang in front of the venera- ble President, and to prevent agitation, was found, in spite of its solid-looking face, to be pierced on the inside by impertinent little teredos, whose ceaseless boring had already begun to weaken its resisting power. Other mariners wished to sail in between the cotton-covered- feet. And in January, 1854, one of these Presidential seamen, from Illinois, namedi  Stephen A. Douglas, leaped ashore on a bluff point just outside the harbor, exclaiming with great lung power that "every Territory had a right to do as it chose about slavery." This declaration from a Demo- cratic friend startled the elderly party not a little; but when that friend rose to a higher pitch and shouted that the Missouri Compromise line of 1821 which kept i ; slavery from all territory north of 36 30', was uncon- stitutional, and leaping upon the solid old dike, with bill and blow, crashed through it,-letting out the bitter waters of strife to flood with  its pent-up strength all the wide land, the antediluvian party started to their feet in great alarm. When, however, Mr. Davis whispered to the President that this was only undoing a modern wrong, and restoring aficient rights, that venerable gentleman folded his arms and ,.i. 1 ^- -- ... .  1  -'1   :44w: THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UhNTED STATES. Lookling out upon the freshet, the bewildered-Afri- cans seemed to feel that their only refuge was the north- pole, now that even the wilds of Kansas and Nebraska furnished only markets for their higher- priced bodies. For a time the " little Douglas " appeared to look as large as the colossus itself. ,He seemed to be as powerful in American politics as the family of his Scottish namesake, which after intermarrying eleven times with the royal stocks of Engla-anand Scotland, became so resistless as to start the proverb, "No man may touch a Douglas, nor a Douglas man, for if he do he is sure to come by the waur " (worse). -But the broad-wasting flood, poured out from the cleft dike, soon sent an alarm throughout the North, and inspired terror among even the conscientious of the South. To protect slavery-however repugnant -where it existed in the old States was felt very universally in, the North to be a duty imposed by law, equity, and good neighborhood; but to batter down a barrier which had been erected by both North and South, every timber in which had been paid for by a price given and accepted, shook nearly all con- sciences into sad action. Wherever the waters swept ,r there were land-slides from Democratic grounds. The : shield against agitation now crumbled like the stricken dike. Kansas became another Flanders, where pikes, knives, and pistols were carried at the plough, into private houses, through villages, and into conventions. They were ever-present adjectives to the noun " man." As in the tropics, whirlwinds rush in towards the sun's hot path, so towards Kansas from Missouri swept advocates   : .  .THE UNION PIERCED.     47 of slavery with bullets for the settler and brands for his dwelling; from New England long-haired men and short-haired women, ready all, some anxious, to be ' offered up for the cause of freedom; from the Middle' and Western   States sharp, bayonet-faced, earnest crusaders to rescue the threatened-sacred ground and to throw down the bronze statues and statutes. On the path of these hot streams backward soon lay the x scorched and burnt relics of slavery in Kansas. , To slavery in the United States a moral blow was dealt by the cane of Preston S. Brooks, aimed May 22, 1856, at the undefended head of Senator Sumner, which had a few days before opened to express in emphatic words its owner's ideas about African bar- barism in America. This appropriate practical illus- tration of the argument was visible everywhere, and became more potent than any books from or in behalf of the running Brooks. The cane given to the chivalrous Carolinian was a poor straw which did not show the way the winds blew.  Still another blow was given by the Dred Scott ,::opinion of a majority of the Supreme Court, which :: advised the people in choice legal terms that the dike was rightfully cut; that men with dark" skins had no, rights which those with light ones need pay any atten- tion to; and that uncolored owners might take ebony bipeds along with their quadrupeds into any State in any part of the Union without getting them out of an unpaid state. This Africanization brought out a new party,- called the Republican,--for keeping the Territories   "8 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. free. Several political missionaries, benevolently in- clined towards our continent, started on trips into the interior of America, bent, like Dr. Livingstone, on exploring regions almost surrendered, like Africa, to the descendants of Ham. The result. was the dis- covery of a race, deemed almost extinct, who actually believed that colored men might live unowned, and that Territories, where slavery did not exist, would get along better without than with it. This party discovered John C. Fremont, and set him up as a candidate. 'Of course some people thought that his election would fracture the Union, whibh, they believed, was held together by gum-bo. The undiked waters would not float Mr. Douglas up to a two-thirds vote for the Presidential nomi- nation. Mr. Buchanan, buoyed up by Southern corks, reached the dock. The Know-Nothings took up the polite Fillnmore, and gratified him with a present of the neat but useless eight votes of Maryland. *    ,             ,t,,?J   CHAPTER XVIL.

Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Buchanan was not so much the representative, of a past age, as the gristled type of unboned nothings. He was unorganized chaos, without any personal will to bring it into usefuil form, swinging through a blind menstruum of thin party air, lit up only by small fire-flies, that left a deeper dark- ness behind their quickly quenched and shifting sparks. His Cabinet was of course a bureau with no two drawers alike. Its principal one, Lewis Cass, was of rosewood, well seasoned, beautifully grained and polished. The money-drawer, Mr. Cobb, was of bird's- eye maple, with eyes enough in it to see all ways. Lower down was one of lignun vite, hard and tough, John B.-Floyd, with a knot-hole in the rear part by which access was had to the drawer above, full of me- tallic corn shelled off the Treasury cob. Below this was one of soft pine, full of treacherous, punky spots, Jacob Thompson, of and from the Interior. And still lower, Isaac Toucey, brought on from Hartford, Con- necticut, looking like a Dismal Swamp cedar, quite unfit for navy purposes, or in fact for aught but the flanges of a dredging-machine, working up stagnant fever-and-ague channels. The cotton-seeds, so widely planted by Douglas,  Davis, Brooks, Taney, A. H. Stephens, and others, dur- ing the preceding four years, now sprouted up in vig- orous shoots.' A Constitution, hastily shaken together by self-made delegates, mostly from Missouri, riding in foamy haste to Lecompton, was tied with a very black cord and sent to Washington, to be indorsed as a good thing for Kansas. Mr. Douglas struck it with his dike-cleaver; but Mr. J. Davis, J. M. Mason, John Sli-   ;!:?/^COTTON-SEEDS ;OUT.   451 ti  *.

Meanwhile, the Mormons in Utah, getting up a sort of magic-lantern show of a rebellion,- outlining on the rocky, walls of the Salt, Lake basin, the shadowy procession of females looking defiantly at United States cannon and canons,- caused a momentary diversion from the new and growing question of a single Union. The next year, 1858, Minnesota, first penetrated by La Salle in 1680, a year before William Penn stood, for the first time, on the future site of Philadelphia, was brought in as a State, giving us St. Paul as a northwestern Cunajfor consumptives, Fort Snelling for gamblers in public lands, and the rather low Falls of Minnehaha to be raised by a Long-fellow into a lofty iridescence, whose rainbow strands have been woven into heavenly fabrics in so many delighted households, American, European, and Asiatic. On paper it is poet- ically higher by-many feet, iambic and trochean, than Niagara, or even the Falls of the Yosemite. The same year witnessed in Thinois the war of the giants for the vacant Senatorship. The two Ana were the dike-breaker and one Abraham Lincoln, thei forty-nine years old, whose various residences in differ- ent States, in Kentucky, his birthplace, in Indiana and Thinois, had taught him the value of the Union; and whose arm, sinewy with labor, antd made more vigorous by his largely pumping heart, dealt blows which resounded sharply and broadly beyond the prairie fields which saw the encounter. :. A -self-made man is too common an object in Amer-   COTTON-SEEDS SPROUT.    -   453: ica to excite or deserve special attention; and most self-made men, so called, are distressingly selfish, un- symmetrical, and one-sided,-- poor jobs abandoned by all creators but. themselves. Even if they did, not proclaim their self-structure to all, every one would at once recognize it by its disjointed architecture. Mr. Lincoln was an exception. More strictly speaking, he was rather a growth than a creation. In his steadily increasing gentle greatness, he reminds one of those slender rills which hesitatingly creep out from some modest, unvisited nook in the Alleghanies, noiselessly finds its way many unnoticed miles, until it begins to glint between cleared farmsteads, and swells slowly into a broad stream, whose brawny shoulders turn with ease mills and factories along its beneficent course. Then gathering volume, depth, and power, it upbears barges, into which whole districts have emptied their ,rich cornucopias, and pleasure-boats, gay with genial tour- ists; while along its great triumphal sea-ward march villages, towns, and cities clap their hands with admir- ing joy.  Mr. Douglas is the same low-born rill, which soon, however, swells into the hurrying torrent, clattering over jagged rocks, between bold mountain- lbbed canyons, jarring the earth with its audacious plunges, shaking defiantly its foamed way through gaps and rent gashes, until it hurls its massed waters over fields which it sweeps with disastrous grandeur.

Suddenly, in the autumn of 1859, through the lurid light was thrust a gaunt, resolute, earnest-looking form, with a face calm with long excitement, over whose lines ran the savage history of Kansas murders and house-burnings, fatal shots -from border rifles at well- loved sons, midnight escapes from Lecompton riders, and years of hunted violence and wrong. From the close-shut jaws, - seldom opened now except for food, for brief prayer before some new raid, or for an im- precation wrenched out by some cruel recollection,-- come no sounds. Across the bridge at Harper's Ferry, through the scared streets of that little garrisoned place, and next into the jail it stalks. Then it flits into court, calmer than the personated Justice, and then, marched between files of soldiers, to fence off a phantom invasion, it mounts the scaffold. An old man, with a grim smile stranded on the iron rim of his lips, swings in Virginia air, and--John- Brown's soul goes marching on. -On the Southern heart this Quixotic invasion by t mistaken, personally injured father, maddened by thl losses of his sons, and unjustifiably wreaking his indi- vidual injuries on a community innocent of any wrong to him, laid a live, inflaming coal. In April, 1860, the Democratic Convention met at Charleston. Some gentlemen asked that body to de- clare- its belief that the Union, having been got up principally to hold Africans in an unpaid condition, a;ny uncolored owner could, by virtue of the laws of his   COTTON-SEEDS SPROUT.       455 own State, take these bronze-colored bipeds,-- always diffusing a bad odor'unless to their proprietors, -to any Territory. Not holding such a notion, the Con- vention declined ;to make the declaration, but, on the contrary, asserted that each Territory was competent to deal with the matter as it saw fit. The question, thus resolved, was not of course to the minority satis- factorily solved. Following a convenient practice, deemed by some persons, unschooled in such things, a little uncommon among gentlemen, of getting, if possible, a decision favorable to their views which shall bind the minority, and if unsuccessful repudiating the adverse decision as affecting them, the delegates of six bronze-statued States left the unreasonable party, carrying a banner with a dimly seen inscription, ' Heads I win, tails you lose, or, tails I win, heads you lose." The convention, thus treated to Breckinridge principles, adjourned to meet in June at Baltimore. Meanwhile, in May, the missionary party, rein- forced by numerous converts, assembled and chose the Anak of Illinois as their leader.  In June the widowed -Democratic Convention reassembled; but :?: only to split up into two family divisions, the. one nominating the dike-breaker, the other John C. Breck- enridge, then Vice-President, and destined in a few years to take, not the Presidency, but the very first prize for a character which total depravity is occasion- ally permitted to offer, lest fiction may invent a com- bination that shall outstrip reality. Of course the Drummond lights now burned bright- ! er.. Tar'and oratory illumined corner grocries ,.and er.,- Ta 'ad,   456 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. open-air meetings. Small men, set to the large honor of presiding over these gatherings, which in an hour or two settled " the most stupendous questions that free- men were ever called to meet," became apoplectic, and were only saved to their country by an application at the nearest bar-room of a remedy reduced to a pre- scription in which Aqua-vitea . .  .  .    92 parts, Aqua-pura  .  .  .  .  .   part, Saccharum   .    .  .   7 parts, restored them to par, or    100 proof. When in November, 1860, the lights were put out, it appeared that Mr. Lincoln had received 180, Mr. Breckenridge 72, Mr. Bell 39, and the Douglas 12 electoral votes. There were 130,773 more ballots cast even at the South against Mr. Breckenridge than in his favor. His opinion of the Union, for which he had run out of breath to be President, was now, of course, very unfavorable; but as it was balanced by its kindred opilnion of him, he was under no obligation to confirm its judgrment by taking the first prize soon: after offered to him.       'l South Carolina, which had often been out voted-before, only waited this time four days -not stopping long enough to see if she was hurt, or how the heads-and- tails fla would look -- before calling a convention which more Cariolense substantially resolved that the Union had broken the Union, and that the people who voted differently from South Carolina were unconstitutional, and ergo, that she might have her own Constitution   COTTON-SEEDS SPROUT.      457 and by-laws. She had helped to rule the roast so long that she could not think of taking turns now. Congress met in December, 1860. Of course John C. Breckenridae was on hand. To. him the Union was a good thing so long as he could preside over its rep- resentatives. While caucusing nights against it, he, could sit in daylight to administer oaths-and even to take them - to support it. The message was full of unginned cotton-seeds vig- orously sprouting. It charged the attempted burglary of the Union safe, not on the burglars, but upon its owners. It chided the people for having done wrong in electing an Anak so absurd as not to agree with South Carolina on the little dark-skinned question; proposed several Africanizing amendments to-the Fed- eral Constitution, and then floundered into the author's chronic chaos; seeming at one moment to believe that a State could not secede, then again that it rather could; then, that if it did, it ought not to; but then if it ought not to, who could prevent 'it if it did; and if it did not, why the fire-flies did not hold out their lit- tie lanterns long enough to light him, or in fact any one else that he knew of, across the miry place. The old hickory-tree had manifestly been chopped down and a very spongy bass-wood had been substi- tuted in the Federal grounds. During January, 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana somehow did something, in some way, somewhere, by someb6dy, - as did Texas in the month of February following, - which was claimed by the head-and-tails party in the South, as indicating- the popular conviction that- Sambo was the only proper 20   -458 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. object of care by Uncle Sam; that they fancied fromn what they suspected that the Anak Abraham   would not carry their pet lamb in his bosom as it had been carried; and that therefore the family was played out. These mysterious, inexplicable somethings, by some- body, somewhere and somehow, were gravely labelled "Ordinances of Secession."  Certain it is, that in not one of these States, except in Texas, were the people consulted about or called to ratify these very grave resolves. Having only three months before voted against their incarnation, - the prize-taker, - it is to be presumed that they would hold to the same beliefs still, in the absence of any act or deed on the part of the Anak to induce a change of opinion. The uncomic truth is, that in this case, as in so many others which have occurred or are occurring in our political history, these overwhelmingly large questions --- upon which hang so many lives, so much happiness or suffering, such accumulated stores of hard-earned savings and character--were undertaken to be an- swered by a few cunning, selfish, dishonest, narrow- headed politicians, audaciously presuming' upon what they ignorantly called leadership, - in the absence of men engaged in more honest work, of clearer head and"i better instincts, - who, idle hands in a country where all just men are busy, too proud to work, too poor to live without the proceeds of others' labor, ever restless and intriguing for luxurious places and foremost positions, -find that, by getting up a strike, they can preside, officer, talk to, and become prominent at assemblages of arrested workmen, and live from their accumulated fund.   COTTON-SEEDS SPROUT.,      459 Disturbed, as well they might be, by these mysterious ordinances, forged by these mischievous idlers, an as- semblage of white-headed and unwisely patriotic gen- tlemen met at Washington to get rid of them. Ord-' nance would undoubtedly have affected it, but ordnance was not to be thought of by those who were recom- mending cotton-sprouts and hopelessly tramping after fire-flies. Some of the Southern Senators gathered up their dark, robes, and loftily chaffing their Northern asso- ciates, strode from the chamber. There was no ordnance in Washington. Of course John C. Breckenridge did not yet followl them; it was more profitable to him and the ordinance parties to stay. John B. Floyd dispersed our little army of 16,000 men into small squads far away from'the ordnance- makers. He knew that the cotton-sprouts would grow better unshaded by bayonets.  On land there was no ordnance where it was needed. General Robert Anderson, of Southern birth, was in the autumn of 1860, assigned to Charleston Harbor, and there left with only 80 men to the presumed magnetic M attractions of that affirmative place. To these his pat- riotism declined to be drawn. December 26, 1860, he removed from   Fort Moultrie ton Sumter, two miles: farther off from the magnets. For eight months pre- ceding, Mr. Floyd had sent heaps of .muskets and am- munition, as desirable compost for the cotton-sprouts. Isaac Toucey, of Hartford, Connecticut, of a cold tem- perament, and from a cool latitude, thought the health of naval officers might suffer from the heats of Charles-   "O THE- COMC HSTORY OF THE UNlTEtD STATES. ton, Wilmington, Savannah, St. Augustine, Mobile, and New Orleans, and so ordered our ships to rove in dis- tant seas. There was, therefore, no ordnance off the seaboard. The little garrison at Fort Sumter now became the pivot of the Union. .Around the question of its rein- forcement the Cabinet swung and went to pieces. Gen- eral Cass, who had broken his sword before surrendering it to those who sought to prevent our Union, now broke his heart over the attempts of those who sought to shiver it in pieces. He was succeeded by Jeremiah S. Black, a gentleman devoted to the black family when en- chained, indifferent to them when free. Floyd, one of the ring-leaders in the strike, skedaddled to Virginia, followed in his rapid journey by an indictment for hav- ing connived at the withdrawal of $ 870,000 worth of bonds from Jacob Thompson's loosely managed Interior. His place was taken by the unbelieving Thomas, of Maryland, who soon became tangled by his want of faith, and was succeeded by General Dix, who had more confidence in guns than in Dixie. On the 4th of February, 1861, the en-gulfed States and South Carolina sent some delegates -chosen also somehow, somewhere, by somebody, in some way un- known-to Montgomery, Alabama, to a convention, ---where the leading strikers of course got upon the plat' form, and had the principal chairs. They proceeded forthwith to concoct that first-class patent medicine for all supposed ills, a constitution. In the compo- sition of this draught radex Africanus largely en- tered. It was to be poured out by slaves, and taken every waking hour. A separate government, called   COTTON-SEEDS SPROUT. 461 ! O   *    "2- THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. - 'the Confederate, was set up by these somehow dele- gates.  A flag was also devised, not in consonance with the avowed object of its bearers, namely,--a col- ored man saddled and running like an unpaid, tireless velocipede with a white rider in the seat working its shackled, eccentric way,-but with stars and bars, -stars rayless as night, and bars destined to be very sinister to the Southern hopes, and eventually to be leaped and beaten down by spirited Northern trampers, To be President of this African Commonwealth, the mysteriously elected delegates invited J. Davis, who was as ready to say yes as the old maid who had done the courting for a series of years. Of a metaphysical turn of mind,--a turn around which all State rights arguments wind themselves up,--sharp-visaged, lean of muscle, leaner of conscience, and leanest of veracity, he had, after being educated at the government ex- pense at West Point, tracked office with a faultless scent, shown much pluck during the Black Hawk and Mexican wars, gnawed the bone of repudiation in Mississippi, and was now ready to bay at Federal flocks wherever -they appeared. Like John Brown, Stonewall Jackson, and those hard Scotch fighters who prayed before the direst slaughters, he was most devout just before writing those calm-looking, philosophy- streaked  messages, which massacred truth with a glaived hand, and shamed fiction by the recital of atro- cities which had no foundation, except at Anderson- ville and in the Libby Prison at Richmond. While these active heats were raging on the edges           *    COT TON-SEEDS SPROUT L     463 of the government, cold chaos brooded at the centre.

Although nearer to us in time, they are not so near to our affec- tions as the elder set.  Most of this younger race some of us have seen; and they have thus lost a certain his- toric grandeur and magnified proportion, always lent by  hazy  distance  to far-off objects.   Most of them have been the subjects of newspaper attack, of conver-   OUR NEWER NATIONAL ALBUM. '    465 sational controversy, of party assault and defence equally damaging, and so have become doubtfully, per- haps disagreeably, familiar. Many of them have been brought into the jurisdiction of our partisan praises and censures for offences against our political principles or passing tastes. Some have been despatched thence with Arizona justice, others by New York equity. Now we have reluctantly dismissed some with Scotch ver- dicts of "not proven," with lurking suspicions more injurious than a positive Saxon condemnation of "guil- ty" , and anon, we have banished others to the penal settlements of our criminal domain:.  Ingenious biographers, taking up characters hitherto surrendered to the public executioner, asking for re- views of judgments alleged to be hasty, and setting forth, in an attractive way, features which even crimi- nals share with the unindicted and facts unstained, perhaps, with the one great crime which slew their reputations, have recently argued for new, trials with a ,  convincing sophistry that few can resist after dinner, and which captivates by its audacious novelty. All of us have discovered what Tacitus long ago so tersely expressed, - our readiness to listen to scandal, and our proneness to praise ourselves for our leniency to the maligned :- "Livor et obtrectatio pronis auribus accipiuntur; quippe adulationi fcedum crimen servitutis, malignitati falsa species libertatis inest." If the puzzled are generally unsafe, the censorious are usually unfair judges. Members of the same family, too, are among each other as likely to do injustice to a fellow-member by DD   "6 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. their jealous criticisms, as they are apt -before stran- gers to make themselves and their fellows ridiculous by undiscriminating praise. Over many mounds - in our national cemetery the, time-stains are growing very dark and the moss thick and undisturbed. As we wander among these with lips less pressed and stern, with perhaps .a feeling of repenting forgiveness, slow though it be, towards those from whom politically or otherwise we have dif- fered, and with occasional touches of tenderness, re- luctant though at first they may. come, for those who nobly erred, if err they did, straining for the right but missing it from the dimness of the light which they carried, let us be sure that in strolling often amid these head-stones, we shall thereby and thereafter be better prepared, by turning out our lower selves, to turn over profitably and pleasantly the pages of our newer National Album which holds a few of their por- traits. If on its first leaves we are confronted by the faces of those whose lineaments --like Clay's, Cal- houn's,?-Webster's, Grundy's, Van Buren's, Quincy Adam,'s, Jackson's, and others -are associated with watch-words that touch party animosities that were born in us we know not how or wfien, and- survive we know not why, we can, at least, learn to be justly proud of what has floated out from the drift-wood and dirty foam of ephemeral politics, which now no longer con- ceal their sturdy and solid timber growths. CLAY, CALHOUN, and WEBSTER! iHow much good ink was thrown uselessly away in bespattering them with blame or praise for the half-century during which they actively and industriously braided 'the public   OUR NEWER NATIONAL ALBUM.      467 history of America through their triple biographies. Of this triumvirate, Mr. Clay was born in 1777, the two others five years later; Mr. Calhoun received the baptism of death in 1850, two years before his life-: long competitors.  They were the three American Fates, holding the distaff, the thread, and the shears of its history and administration. Utterly dissimilar in the place and circumstances of their births, educa- tions, trainings, cultures, and courses, they yet supplied for each other the only parallels over that- wide tract of time through which their prolonged lives reached. In the House and in the Senate, sometimes on the same side, but oftener congenially opposed, yet ever 'divided from eachi other by rival ambitions, they ennobled the scenes in which they spent such large forces. The American Titans, they tossed heavy bars of logic with such ease, wrestled with such matching- power and balanced success, that we, growing up to the gigantic spectacles, almost lose the consciousness of the unwonted masteries that have-so grandly played before us. And yet, somehow, for all this,;compara- tively little love gathers in our hearts as we look at those well-remembered faces; the large, continental visage .of Henry Clay, mapping a hemisphere of vast thoughts and generous though partisan currents of action; the lofty sternness of John C. Calhoun, cast in a Cato-like mould, heroic and defiant; and the square-blocked, cubical, almost repulsive mass, out- lined into the head of Daniel Webster, which looks, or rather is looked at, as if it had for several centuries capped the pyramid of Cheops, and had been finally taken down with state ceremonies and transplanted by   "8 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.

Sadder than a professed comedy or a prepared fu- neral oration over a rich but bad man is the unsatisfied ambition of such tough athletes in the political arena, who, after a long life of great rough play, break up into common earth, and form the subjects for Com- mencement day or prize compositions in an open grove, where young ladies in white, bound in blue- belting-ribbons, summon their uneasy ghosts before the dull-eyed umpires. , From what a-cold well-depth sprang to the curb of Webster's lips those soliloquiz- ing words which, a few days before his death, over- flowed from a disappointed life. Sitting in an open doorway at Marshfield, propped up by pillows, he looked out upon his favorite herd of cattle, which were driven up for the last inspection of their attached owner. As the fine animals passed and turned their large eyes upon him,- some pausing and looking a fond recollection into his scarcely wasted face,- he ejaculated, as his thoughts turned backward over the slights of party and the disappointments of an un- satisfied life; "I love the honest faces of animals. 'They look what they mean." Arriving in the world the same year with Mr. Webster, Mr. Calhoun, and each other, LEWIS CASS, portly in presence as in learning, varied capacity, and many-sided culture, and THOMAS H. BENTON, as solid W as the bullion which a dim tradition mentions as formerly found in these United States, meet us with that full-orbed spherical satisfaction which double- chnned persons are fortunate in imparting, if not of /   470 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. feeling themselves. The "Recollections of Thirty Years in the Senate" would, one would think, be enough to reduce any mortal to very attenuated pro- portions. Fortunate is the memory of any M. C. which is constructed like a mining-sieve, letting through the superabundant dirt and retaining only the loosely silted ore. ANDREW JACKSON and JOHN QUINcy ADAMS, des- tine4 to be rivals for the Presidency in the fifty- seventh and again in the sixty-first years of their lives, were severally born nine years before the Dec- laration of Independence. Their lives were as unlike as their faces. The former passed his first score of years in the hard struggles for a livelihood, and mostly amid the scenes made memorable by the cavalry- swords of Marion and Sumter and the pen of William Gilmore Sims; the 'latter spent his in the study of what could best round up a capable mind by disci- pline and learning, and in the equally advantageous culture derived from the society of his accomplished mother and experienced father. While the stormy incidents of an eventful military life in Florida and Georgia, intercalated with court-martials and official censures, scored in Jackson's face the notches which, until his death in 1845, kept truthiful tally with his warm, violent, generous, resentful, and stern history; over the round, uncreased face of Adams ran the smoothing-iron of literary tastes and pursuits, keep- ing down the -uffling disturbances of a naturally pas- sionate nature, and the ridges which the excitements from 1824 to, 1828, and the antislavery agitations in the latter part of his life, would have otherwise left.   OUR NEWER NATIONAL ALBUM.      471 Jackson's virtues deserve signal praise, and Adams's vices emphatic censure; since the former grew   up under circumstances as unfavorable to their existence as a young ladies' seminary for modesty, or a New York sheriff s office for integrity; and the latter amid ' forces as unassailing as a prayer-meeting to piety or sleep to pure thoughts. Types of American character in many respects are the originals of the two thin-faced portraits to which we next turn, -types in their foreign birth, their obscure social belongings, and their shrewd and successful busi- ness ventures, -STEPHEN GIRARD, coming into life in 1750, at Bordeaux, France, as acid as the claret of his native city, and commanding, like it, very profitable prices by -transportation to this country, a sailor's son, and until his nineteenth year himself a sailor, and JOHN JACOB ASTOR, his junior by thirteen years, off- spring of a poverty-worried peasant, ushered first into a calin at Waldorf, near Heidelberg, where black bread and small hopped beer were all that incessant labor could procure. The former lived eighty-one, the latter eighty-five years upon our planet; and by faithfully gathering up from its surface, water and land, from its ships, stores, and offices, and from its furred and un- furred animals, the gains which persistent early rising, industry, and ceaseless penny-turning accumulate, left fortunes, the first of nine, the last of twenty millions of dollars. "Sic itur ad Astra." , The Astral-lamp Library, obtained by funds be- queathed by a benefaction, like Girard's College, ap- preciative of what its donor had himself missed, sheds   472 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. its genial light on many a poor scholar's desk. If each legacy has been somewhat diverted from its testamen- tary direction, perhaps the best excuse may'be found in the reason why married women were not allowed to have their wills after death, because they had them so much while living. JOHN. MARSHAT T, to whose unmistakably   pure- minded face we turn in safe admiration, was one of those types of leadership, one of those representatives of schools, who, violently liked or disliked when living, has by the touch of death been canonized among the white-robed of the nation. An incarnation, when alive, of Federalism, his ermine has become so white under the fulling of time and by contrast with robes since worn, and his grasp of the judicial balances was, as is now seen, so firm, so unimpassioned& and unshaken by a nervous partisanship, that he has already passed into the very small list of judges, whose lofty character, stainless purity, large judicial capacities and force, are like solid cool rocks amid the ever-shifting scenes and temper- atures of a varied landscape. An artist's head sits manifestly on the shoulders of JOHN TRUMBULL, born in 1756, a year after John Mar- shall, and living eight years beyond him. At his death in 1843, he" left but few as aged. His busy pencil dropped in 1775 for the musket, and, resumed in 1777, has perpetuated in fifty-seven historical pictures, with the fidelity and love of personal friendship, the portrait- ures of most of the leading actors in the first period of our national story. He was President of the Academy of Fine Arts, from its formation, in 1816, until it gave place, in 1825, to the Academy of Design. His dress, ,   *1.   OUR NEWER :NATIONAL-ALBU3.      473 it will be observed, was formally and scrupulously in the mode; his address was as dressy as his wristhands and frills. Quick-eyed mothers would at once, as he took his seat, warn the children, always attracted towards clean vestments, "not to dirty the gentleman's clothes." In 1761 ALBERT GALITATIN was born. Related to Neckar, he seems to have borrowed at the same time much of the financial ability of the French minister, and the ready wit, graceful imagination, and forceful word-power of the minister's brilliant daughter, Ma- dame de Stael. He crammed eighty-eight years :full of remarkable activities, as ambassador to Russia, France, Great Britain, and Holland, as member of Congress, and as a weighty yet captivating and vivacious writer on banks, public credit, currency, and those subjects,. ever rising, like cream, on the public pans, which are skimmed by the most skilfully handled ladles. Turning the page, we meet the thought-bearing faces of REMBRANDT PEATX., born in 1778, and below, that of his brother artist, WASHNGTON ALLSTON, the Amer- ican Paul Veronese, who, Peale's junior by a year, ceased his earthly work in 1853, seven years before him. The -serenity of congenial pursuits gilds their portraitures, and lingers like an aureola around their -heads. Upon Allston's face there seems spread a lis- tening look, as if straining to catch far-off notes, mingled with that gentle hush and composure, as if stilled by that music so subtily described by Wolds- [worth, which "Born of murmuring sound, had passed into his face." A tree does not show more markedly than man the ,Wd   474 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATESI results of ancestral care, wealth, and leisurely- culture. Numerous are the faces and histories scattered all through our national album, which are signalized by a curious mixture of original forest wildness and park growths newly begun, cultivated shoots grafted upon hardy native stocks, and giving off large unsymmetri- cally shaped fruits, - fruits less sour than the natural, but less genial, plump, mellow, and blooming than the full-nursed growth. Of these were, in oratory, FELIX GRUNDY, whose exposed youth shot up on the wilder- ness frontier of Kentucky, where " death was in almost every bush, and-an ambuscade in every thicket," and who attained, in Tennessee, a large altitude and breadth; SARGEANT S. PRENTISS, transplanted from among the pines of Maine to the coarse richness of a Mississippi soil, and through whose waving tops swept sometimes the storm of invective, sometimes the aeolian strains of tenderest, soul-trembling breathings; JOHN J. CRIT- TENDEN, a farmer's-boy, born in 1785, whose prickly logic sheathed, like a burr, the smooth-meated chest- nut; and, among statesmen, SAMUEL HOtUSTON of Texas, shaggy-barked, yet with much tasselling wealth of flower at the top; DANIEL D. TOMPKINS of New York, and a large number of others, strong saplings, pushing up in brave defiance of adversities, some wrought into bureaus, others inlaying cabinets,- American woods, some still sappy and cross-grained, but making as good state furniture as an untechnical taste has hitherto been content to demand or use. Glancing through our book, --in which we treasure only the portraits of the departed,-we dwell with satisfaction upon a group of high-toned, conscientious,   OUR NEWER NATIONAL ALBUM.     475 Christian statesmen, who honored public office in their persons, and shed upon the Senate a light so effulgent, that the many opaque substances, so often thrust into it, have not been able wholly to absorb: JOHN MAC- PHERSON BERRIEN, born in 1781; THEODORE FRELING- HUYSEN and SAMUEL L. SOUTHARD, in 1787; and WIL- "AM o. PRESTON in 1794;- with whom are worthily associated HUGH S. LEGARE, whose fine face brought its welcome into every company, as his radiant mind sparkled and scintillated over every subject; and BEN- JAMN F. BUTLER of New York, whose clear-cut phys- iognomy, like an antique on a fine stone, shows hand- somely in every setting. WrINIELD SCOTT came into life in 1786, and so crys- tallized about himself each of the three wars in which he was the principal magnet, - the maritime contest of 1812, the Mexican war in 1847, and the opening of the Rebellion in 1861, - that his calm front and majes- tic, presence would readily single him out as the model figure for our American Mars. Like a great elm in the Berkshire valley he stands, massive in strength of trunk, spreading out in varied branches of learning, special study, and active experience, and dropping his pendulous, wide-circuiting limbs ]nd generous foliage over a broad expanse of rich meadow. Under this vast, wide-reaching, many-dropping banyan-tree his- tory seems to gather in a sleepy, contented calm. Dearly do we all love to pause over the beautifully bordered page which holds -the genial, sunny-faced visage Of WASHNGTON IRVING. He was four years old when Washington delivered his first Inaugural.

How our landscapes, the lives of our best and worthiest, the graceful legends of our rivers, mountains, prairies, and historical sites, -- barren, voiceless, and dumb before, warm into life, and stretch out their living hands in tender entreaty, instinct and round with charms of per- suasive beauty, as, like the prophet over the child, he stretches, himself over them! Of some of his associates and compeers, still happily spared to us, we cannot speak; for the living are too numerous to   be enumerated, and  too near to be sketched; but of JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE, whose brief twenty-five years of life exhaled such beautiful and deathless creations as the Culprit Fay; of FITZ-GaEENE HATLL,.K, his companion and fellow-laborer, whose rare humor stole into delicious song, as sprites are said to play hide-and-seek in buttercups and honeysucldes; and of JAMES R. PAULDING, linked in literary work as by family ties with Irving, and whose diversified genius gives him  a large, if not a choice place in our Wal- halla, -of all these kindly faces we delight to keep copies in our album. Like Irving, fortunate in the enjoyment of a wide European reputation, but less fortunate than  he in securing the undivided hearts of his countrymen, - whose early history, aboriginal legends, forest scenery, and naval characters he has so well tapestried in' nov- els, essay, biography, and history,--JAMES  FENIMORE COOPER, born in 1789, has, by   his sea tales, caused many a mother's heart to yearn after her runaway boy, and by his land stories, garnered up many of our best sheaves of fiction into a national stack. As we gaze   OUR NEWER NATIONAL ALBUM.      477- on his large, square, massive forehead, we forget his sharply feathered arrows, aimed at our national faults, which generally, of course, missed the conscience and touched only the liver. Remembering "' The Pioneers," "The Last of the Mohicans," "The Spy," "Pilot," and '( Red Rover," we fall to blessing the creations which stalk over our rough fences, and brush away our raw villages, uproarious with faces of civilized red-men, and so, endeavor to get by, as boys do a haunted place at nightfall, the recollection of those twenty-two libel suits, whose damages he found, like most plaintiffs in that species of legal fiction, to end in the payment of the costs out of his own pocket. Others there are, too, whose physiognomies recall to us pleasantly the explorers in science, workers amid Nature's secrets, earlier than those who now push their- daring way into her very robing-room: B RJAXMJ ^t "MAN, the elder, who came in 1779, and throbh a long life lectured so many into the pleasant idea that, they knew something of geology and chemistry, and through his "Journal of Science," establishei -in 1818, gathered up the mental products of his fellow-harvest- ers; ROBERT HARE, two years younger, who, at the age of twenty, invented the compound blow-pipe, and up to his death, in 1858, continued his discoveries, until he left, by his spiritual explorations, his scientific breth- I ren behind him; and BENJAMN  RUSH, born in 1780,  who by his tasteful style, made boluses less distasteful, and even gave the muses such a draught that they be- came delirious over his medical pages.

Stop we a moment to admire the intellectual fea- tures of CATHERINE M. SEDGWICK, born in 1798, whose wise essays and wiser fictions lie upon so many ta- bles; the calm head of HORATIO GREENOUGH, who pro- duced his first work, the "Chanting Cherubs," upon a commission from Fenimore Cooper, brought out the earliest American group in marble, and became a very Medusa, turning many Americans into stone; and finally the grand, quaint physiognomy of NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, given to us-in 1804, and just withdrawn, whose genial tales and humorous descriptions will keep his memory as odorous as woodbines around the porches of houses seven-gabled, mossed, newly Gothic, or indifferently green-shuttered, and up to their eaves  in white paint.

THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.     481- "ROBESPIERRE," says a terse, sentence-packing essayist, "would slay one half of France to get[ the other half to follow his principles of virtue." The cotton rebellion is another illustration of the same horrible tenderness, the same selfish loveliness, the same unsentimental sentimentalism. Like the strange histories of Scylla, of Marius, of Simon de Montfort and his helmed soldiery-against the Waldenses, of Alva in the Netherlands, of Philip II., and of Claverhouse, in Scotland, it exhibits a cour- age, endurance, sacrifices, and heroism which exalt, to compass ends which debase and brutalize human nature. Setting up in the second half of the nineteenth cen- tury, and in- free, much-reading America, a fetich for worship, brought from Africa, slimy with snakes, foul, cruel, deformed, and misshapen, its singularly enthusias- tic votaries, after insisting by books, tracts, primers, by philosophic essay, bound treatise, and unbound poetry, in Congress, conventions, lecture-rooms, prayer-meet- ings, horse-races, and in all places, seasonable or un- seasonable, thirsty or wet, that the fetich, though repudiated by all civilized people, was the true and undoubted patron of government, society, wealth, pro- gress, and human, i. e. white-skinned happiness, at last seized musket and sword to maintain and perpetuate her horrid rites, although this maintenance should overturn and waste all other shrines. The cotton-gin struck, in 1793, springs all over the slave States, whose multiplying flows so gathered head in 1821 as to require damming back. The Missouri dike was erected. The pent waters, however, were found so profitable for foreign mill-owners, for over-shot 21         v   EE   '482 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. feeders to Northern shelves, for commercial pockets, and political ballot-boxes, as well as such wealth-dis- tributing streams over the growing breadths and easy luxuries of their Southern owners, that expedients were devised to swell their volume, area, and back-water power. The dike, cut in 1854, let out the accumulated deluge into new sluice-ways, which promised to some increased profits, but which produced great ravageg in many ways, and at last set towards maelstroms, down whose gurgling throats were sucked, not only the pas- sive and floating citizen, and the compromising, timid politician, but much of the life and wealth of the nation at large. Over the angty ridges, rapidly rising on the 4th of March, 1861, Mr. Lincoln, uneasy at the white caps crisping the dark swells, and himself in disguise, landed at the national wharf in Washington. With- out disguise, however, he at once, in 'a distinct, calm voice, announced the principles, upon which he pro- posed to meet the menacing flood, namely, not to inter- fere with its black tides in States where they were legally channelled, nor to create any new courses in Territories in which they had not surged, and steadily to enforce, in spite of all 'obstructions, the existing rules, regulations, and laws both North and South. This announcement struck the knob of the national shield, and its metallic notes quivered through the air. The three commissioners, despatched from the some- how gathered Confederate assemblage at Montgomery, heard the vibrations the morning of their arrival, March 5th, but failed to shout loud enough tor be heard themselves, and returned speedily with their cross-barred message.   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.  483 COTTON SUPREME.   484 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNllTED STATES, Attention was immediately directed to the ravelled American stocking rapidly running down. The blue yarn of the navy was taken up stitch by stitch. The threads of the little army were picked up, lying loosely around at a distance from the capital, and, by much knotting and splicing, were put upon the old, rusty, war-needles for work. It was very sad business for the -gentle-minded Lincoln, although helped by Mr Seward in the -State Department, - a very vigorous and manifold letter-writer,--by the wide-headed Chase in the Treasury, by the strong-knuckled Cameron in the noisy War Bureau, and by that long-bearded Gideon Welles, whose unthatched upper story became in time like a naval depot, the receptacle of a great deal of odd material, most of it too old to be serviceable. In truth, with his funny ways, dropping anchor when he should be making steam, bothered with new invent tions, gun. bores and spiral devices, which he had nevei seen at Hartford, and quite incomprehensible often by any one, puzzled by stern duties and running about t( know where the ship's waste was, the latter old gen tieman was about the only joke which went about for four years. Notice- by the government of. its intention to add t( the eighty men in Fort Sumter drew upon that littlE stone pentagon a lively cannonade of thirty-six hours by General Beauregard, the Confederate military leader distorting its resolute visage, arid causing wry face everywhere throughout the North, and very man] among the strikers at the South: The first whizzing shot was the first uneasy spasi in that horrible nightmare which crept over Americ' - and held it bound for four years.   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.    485 For the sake of human nature; for the sake of our common past, and our   ow dawning brighter future, we would fain draw over the face of the disturbed sleeper a veil, which should but dimly delineate, if it did not altogether hide from view, the uncoffined ghastliness. The purposes of history, however, forbid us, nurses as we are in trouble, as boon companions in feasting, to quit the room; and so holding still, as best we can, the hand of genial Humor, we sit down amid the uncomic scenes of a fratricidal struggle. Through the evening silences which followed the evacuation of Fort Sumter, April 14, 1861, were heard at Montgomery and in other Confederate cities rhetor- ical voices of gratulation at the humbled pride, flag, and prosperity of the North, and predictions of bold- equestrian sallies into Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston; at the North, wails of sorrow, sud- ,den questions of the causeless blows on the tingling national cheek, mixed with remorseful self-accusations at the weak petting, which had so encouraged unre- strained tempers as to invite to this public breaking of the family crockery and this unconcealable family disgrace. "Had not the rod been so long spared," -was thie general feeling, --"we should now be spared the use of the ramrod."  The next morning, however, Mr. Lincoln proclaimed the need of seventy- five thousand ramrods, with good men to accompany them to' Washington. At the same time he asked the wise men to meet at the capital in July for con- sultation. Ere the next daybreak, a thousand Massa- chusetts lads were on their way towards the Potomac, shining in new-burnished steel and new polished love' in ,n                 ,   486 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. for that old Union mother, whose goodness had been so steady and uniform as hitherto to excite no manifested return. On the 19th of April they reached Baltimore, and were passing through in the horse-cars, when they were set upon by a bad lot of hards and softs of that city, - as others before and since have frequently been -assailed in their transit, by railway and hotel runners. Other regiments soon followed from  "the teeming North, through all her unfrozen loins." Guns were got down from rusted hooks; shoulder-straps straight- ened; blunderbusses and other busses given and taken; officers beaten up from behind ploughshares to be beaten in first skirmishes into good leaders; and shields from all the free States were' clasped around the waist of the capital. Never were there so many gun-holders, nor so few office-seekers, at Washington in the month of April. The soft velveted hand which caressed was now stiffened into the steel gauntlet to smite. Meanwhile the English government, employed since 1783 in looking across at us through the large end of its telescope, suddenly got its eye at the other extreme, and discovered the monstrous size of this country, the large population, and unmanifested pluck of the nine somehow seceded States, and, to her, the very obvious absence of any ties or mutual necessity between two such, admirably designed single nations. This was the almost unanimous opinion, too, of the well-dressed classes; although some Bright Englishmen, and espe- cially the hard toilers in the manufacturing districts,- although working in smoke,- saw more clearly the object and design as well as the final end of the com-   I      THE WAR OF IDEAS ANMD MUSKETS.   487 mencing difficulty than those whose near-sightedness spread a film over all their American observations. I "The Hunited States 'ave too many people," said Lord John. "Haltogether, yes," replied Lord Palmerston. "Suppose that they should fight?" inquired Lord - John.  "Well, two heads are better .than one," replied the facetious Palmerston. "And so are two customers," rejoined Lord John, wiping his nose with a cotton pocket-handkerchief. And forthwith they issued a proclamation of neu- trality in the name of the Queen, whose heart was no more in its sentiments than her hand in its com- position. It was thought at the time by many people to be very smart; and so it was very smart, altogether too smart. It was a state fiction,- a fancy creation, looking in legal phrase as if all the English were bent on rush- ing into the prophesied something, - a buffalo-hunt, a Long Island race, or steamboat explosion; -for what the little flurry was about, or would -be when the solemn state warning was given, no one knew;- unless they were violently restrained by the British government. It was the unnecessarily vehement dec- laration of the very disinterested old maid to the un- suspecting, quiet young man, quite innocent of .such audacious thoughts as her fears excited and suggested: "Now, if you kiss me I shall resist. I shall. Don't *you try it.. Now, there, don't come towards me. Don't make such a noise, for everybody will hear you. Hands off. Don't try it.   I shall scream. Quit now. Don't disturb the neighborhood. Hands   488 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. off, I tell you. I won't have anything to do with it." The warning was as piquant and promotive of the practice deprecated, as the landlord's to the ostler, never to grease the teeth of traveller's horses, for if he should they could not eat oats. The strikers in Arkansas and North Carolina, in May, contrived somehow to get up delegates to meet those from the other Southern States at Richmond, the newly selected gathering-place of Confederated counsellers. The insurrection commenced to grow. . The warned boy began seriously to think of the audacity from which he was so solemnly conjured to desist. Federal war stores, magazines, and naval materials were handed over to the new State claimants by their loose-wristed custodians, who, although educated by the Federal government, generously gave away her property on the principle of that testator, who requested his own debtors, forthwith after his decease, to pay what they owed to his executors, and nobly forgave his creditors the debts which he owed them. Floydism became as fashionable South as cotton, butternut- colored clothing and long hair. Just as the tree was bent the Twiggs inclined. At Little Rock, Pensacola, Portsmouth, Virginia, and in Texas, large masses of stores, cannon, guns, and naval materials were trans- ferred, like the allegiance of the officers in charge, to the strange African fetich. It looked as if the Ameri- can people were moving out of the lower story of their large, constitutional bazaar into the upper lofts, and were giving away generously a part of the expensive fixtures to the new incoming tenant.   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.   .489 In May some Confederate cotton curtains, striped with rough military lines, were hung before Washing- ton. They concealed much real weakness andwant of furniture behind them, and enabled those, who kept up a confused shouting in the darkened recesses and away from the front, to convey an impression of numbers which did not exist. Thirteen thousand Federal troops, -part of the :I - seventy-five thousand,--led by General Mansfield, de- siring to get a nearer view of the curtain, crossed over the Potomac to Arlington Heights. The Virginia soil, it was found, no more spurned Northern-feet than its cul- tivation was spurned by the hands of its white owners. The next day Colonel Ellsworth, with a Zouave regi- ment, entered the ancient town of- Alexandria. Seeing the new flag swaying in its sluggish air, he tore down, as he supposed, the fetich symbol; but received almost on the instant a fatal shot, and was borne away with slow requiems to the vast Northern cemetery, in which new graves were soon rapidly to be opened. The struck symbol of the Confederacy was not Cut down, but only lowered to half-mast, emblem of American hopes and pride. \ May 9, Mr. Lincoln made a new call for forty-two thousand men. As quickly as May blossoms come to the expected call of the shower they came in rosy-hearted responses. General Butler hastened with twelve thou- sand men to Fortress Monroe, whence on the 9th of June he sent a detachment' to Big Bethel. No wres- tling-match, however, came off there, and no pillar of stone, of course, set up. Meanwhile, Missouri, Mary- land, and Kentucky,  resisting the second secession 21*   "O THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. cleavage, started by Virginia, and which had drawn after her Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina,- trembled with the forces contending for ascendency in their several borders. In the first State, General Jack- son attempted in vain to mesmerize Lyons. Failing in these passes, he made several upward strokes, destroying railroads, bridges, and telegraph wires. But the Fed- eral commander, pursuing him to Boonesville, disabled his arm from renewing such tricks. Uniting his forces with General Sigel's,-making from   their junction six thousand men, - General Lyons attacked at Wil- son's Creek, near Springfield, Ben McCullough and Sterling Price, with a force of twenty thousand. The attacking party was repulsed,' and its brave leader killed, but the followers of the Ranger were too weary to pursue them. In Virginia, early in July, General George B. Mc- Clellan, then in his thirty-sixth year, and General Rosecrans, in his forty-second, collecting the, cream of their little armies, skimmed the Confederate pans at Rich, Mountain, while immediately after, the Confeder- ate pails were completely upset or seized by General Morris, assisted by some help from Ohio and Indiana, at Carrick's Ford. General Rosecrans, flowing towards the Southwest, came down like a mountain torrent in the Kanawha valley, even flooding such water- logged estrays as Henry A. Wise and the indicted Floyd. The salt springs of the valley, towards which they sped, could not preserve them from  becoming spoiled, and held ever afterward, even: by their friends, in bad odor. A few days-afterwards, the troops near Washington,   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.     491 numbering about 35,000 under General McDowell, were moved in a body towards the curtain,- which  was drawn back and back by its supporters to Manassas Junction, - where Beauregard, intrenched with 27,000 men, assisted by General Joseph E. Johnston and 16,000 5 more close at hand in Winchester steadied and up- held it. As the 35,000 thousand went forward, the three months' men, whose time :had expired,.went back- ward, seeking the far rear to the sound of the enemy's cannon, until the Federal inspecting force was reduced to 18,000. As they approached that historic little rill, Bull Run, they met the combined forces of the Confed- erates, and after holding the field against them and even advancing upon it, until late in the afternoon, they fell into one of those panics, not unfrequent among troops, raw or seasoned, in which the wild run of frightened bulls or the disordered summersaulting and tumbles of a herd of buffaloes is an orderly march. A mass of huddling soldiers, civilians, team- sters, members of Congress, and other muddled mate- rial was thrown upon Washington. The puzzled Con- federates, unconscious of victory and of course unpur- suing, at length got back to their capital. Discovering at last their stupendous victory, they made up for lost time by shouts so loud that every European echo repeated it, like a very Lurlei. In this big scare were many of the leading generals on either side, - among those. on the Federal, Sherman, Burnside, and Heint-- zelman; and on the Confederate,. Longstreet, Ewell, Early, Bonham, and that praying soldier, Stonewall Jackson, then thirty-five years old, and whose saintly, fanatical bravery recalls the gallant slaughterers in the   "2 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. civil wars of Scotland, who tempered their prayers with bayonet-pushing amens, and ended their fervid; hacking of enemies with hearty thanksgivings to Heaven. The losses on either side in men were nearly bal- anced,--the Federal dead amounting to 481, and the Confederate to 378; the Federal wounded to 1011, the Confederate to 1489 ; but in prestige, self-respect, and that subtle moral force which cannot be weighed even by grains or scruples, the advantage was greatly with the insurrectionists. Congress immediately voted to raise 500;000 men for the army, two hundred and fifty millions of dollars  in money, and to issue fifty millions of treasury-notes. The Confederate gathering determined to set 400,000 men to help the existing 210,000 hold up the cotton veil, now becoming so heavy and thick with dust and clots, that even Mr. Seward began to doubt whether it' could be lifted in thirty days. In August, Forts Hatteras and Clark were pulled by Commodore Stringham into Pamlico Sound. For many months the country in front of Washing- ton was converted into a vast drill-ground, over which Drill-Sergeant McClellan exercised the weary feet of over one hundred thousand soldiers, and the wearier patience of many millions of citizens. During this time ,the echoes of Bull Run, as numerous and diversi- fied as an Irishman's, 1haunted the consciences and - journals of America, and the hollow faith of Europe. If it was all quiet on the Potomac, it was very unquiet elsewhere. General McClellan was always a believer in the Italian proverb,   THE WAR. OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.    493 "Chi va piano.'  Va sano ; Chi va forte, Va alla morte," and so he held his ground near Washington. T n September, a series of severe. skirmishes, lasting three days, between General Robert E. Lee, now fifty- three years old, and General Reynolds, at Cheat Moun- tain and Elk Water, Virginia, followed by another October 3d at Greenbrier, disagreeably shook up --the Confederate commander. These first attempts to turn against his countrymen the science and skill which he had gained at their expense and in their service, were creditable to his conscience, -if not to his head and skill. The sleeper turned over with a sense -of smothering, as in his nightmare horror he saw the drawn sword of his favorite sons pointed at him. On the 29th of October a fleet under Commodore Du Pont, with General T. W. Sherman and twenty thousand men on board, sailed for Port Royal, and after three elliptical turnings in the- harbor, threw out such pills as they passed that Forts Walker and Beauregard, suddenly swallowing them, fell into such a vertigo, that they lost their heads, and tumbled helpless upon the ground. To balance this fatal-bill of mortality, however, the Confederate General Evans, defeated with great loss a detachment of two thousand one hundred men'under General Stone, at Balls Bluff, when Oregon lost one of her best senators and citizens, Colonel E. D. Baker. The cotton veil was becoming very soiled and flecked. November brought out a variety of colors in American   affairs, some light with yellow hues, others as dark as the gusty season loves to whirl over a surface -ever freezing and thawing. General Scott retired from the chief command of the army, to which General McClel- lan- succeeded; the lean Davis was made high-priest  for six years to the Southern fetich, and Mason and Slidell, Confederate commissioners, hurriedly shunning Mr. Welles and his cruisers, were captured by Captain Wilkes off the Trent. They were of course promptly spied by the large, vigilant English telescope, which, in its rapid shifting for the occasion, read English inter- national law backwards, and spelled out our duty from our own precedents. The alacrity with which their surrender was demanded showed that the still anxious young lady had survived the alarm, caused by the un- willing kiss six months before, and was desirous to escape, in precisely the same way, any further -imper- tinences.   , ,   - John C. Breckenridge now climbed down to grasp the depraved prize he had at last so well earned. Elected a Senator of the United States a t the close of the Vice,-Presidency in the preceding March, he readily took a voluntary oath to support the Constitution of an undivided land; played the spy upon the efforts of its government to thwart the attempts to dissever it; and at the close of the session, unable longer to profit by his office and oath, took a brigadier's commission and a new oath against a country which had loaded his  family and hireself with its highest honors. Once the cherished type of a chivalrous gentleman, he engrafted J upon the abused name of chivalry definitions more re- proachful than those which spring from  the addled   eccentricities of Don Quixote; his old friends, if any such survive, must long have desired to feel that he had only lost an arm   in a service which, undistin- guished by any advantage brought to it by a man who had deserted everything for it, sunk the remains of a character once high, and an intellect once brilliant, to a depth compared with which history refuses an ex- ample. Others may plead some excuse, more or less admissible, for their armed heresies: Davis, that his was a logical sequence to his lifelong convictions of State supremacy; Toombs, Cobb, Stephens, and others, that their States dragged them out; Floyd, the neces- sity of putting money in his purse; Wise, the loss of a guiding intelligence. But to not one of these can John C. Breckenridge point to mitigate the just severities of that moral verdict which, in cases of such cumulated guilt, can only appease the general uneasiness at the exhibition of depravity so fathomless, by the most ex- emplary damages. Looking into the dreadful chasms, down which his example cast so many others; the maimed cripples, the hollow-eyed widows, Justice slain by stabs in the back, exiles from  poor homes smitten by the bludgeons of secret agents, even humorous His- tory grows stern-featured and allows a saddening pity to cloud her habitual smile, as she flings her knotted whip over the shoulders of high-born guilt. As the year 1861 drew towards its close, the war, dropping in the old traditional path of empire, trended westward and seated itself in the valley of the Mis- sissippi. Ulysses S. Grant, then thirty-nine years old, newly assigned to the District of Cairo, took Paducah, Kentucky; and settled on Belmont, -not August, the   "6  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. banker, but a small town in Missouri, on the banks of th Mississippi, opposite Columbus, Kentucky. This latte place was then held by that mitred Spartan warrior Leonidas Polk, who had left the light of the star whc guided wise men to the Babe, for the hazy star of the major-general, -one of the dim twinklers in tha milky-way which, after four years' watering,'disap peared from the sight of even telescopic gazers. Gradually large forces were drawn to the State of Kentucky,--nicely balancing on neutral ground,- while her reluctant land Bwas coyly withdrawn fromr any Union by her guardian, Governor Magoffin, and was thereby sought with greater ardor by each suitor, The Confederates offered her a bridal Pilow, but the Federals   sent Ulysses, that wise   and  silent Greek, whose manly deeds soon effectually won her affections. -Christmas eve, 1861, put a million of armed men and two millions of diurnal debt into the long stocking of iron-ridden America.

( How far is it, my boy, by this road to Drains- ville?" asked a mud-spattered traveller of a shrewd lad by the roadside.

Looking, however, only at the delusive finger-boards which cottonized brains had set up along that way; singing  jaunty songs of Southern superiority and Northern low-down man- ners ; and listening to a confused distant cheer, occasion- ally borne to them by certain winds out of the North and by easterly breezes from Europe, they rode on, fancying that they would soon dismount at their journey's end, give their splashed animals into the accustomed charge of the old faithful, colored ostlers, and set down to the old dishes of glorious hominy and glorifying homily.. Instead, however, of this experience, they met inter- minable difficulties, --Generals Crittenden and Zollicof- fer, jostled out of saddle by General Thomas at Mill   "8 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.

These stories always seemed to entertain the hard-travelling party, who frequently called upon him to repeat them, which he did with some charmingly horrible variations. Suddenly, however, on the 8th of March, a novel sight greeted the eyes of all in Hampton Roads. [The steam-frigate Merrimac, raised from her salty bed near Portsmouth, receiving a new coat of mail, an ugly look- ing iron rhinoceros-shaped snout, and the soft, new pet name of Virginia, rolled out in ungainly strength into the wide bay; and commenced goring the Federal herd of wooden frigates, fatally ripping up the Cumberland and Congress, and cruelly gashing  the' St. Lawrence and Roanoke. 'Unhurt herself, her scaly armor un- dented, she slunk back gorged to her lair, prepared for a more savage repast on the rest of the frightened gun- boats and ships on the following morning; when  lo! on the morrow, tumbling out for her cruel pastime, she met the little, pert, saucy Monitor, one fifth her size only, and also clothed in steel, which stepped up close by her side and delivered two unexpected, round mes- sages, each  weighing one hundred and sixty-eight pounds.  Indignant at this interference with her in- tended lunch, the masculine Virginia commenced fling- ing iron bolts and round indignities, but the pert little thing hurled heavier blows back. The Virginia then punched her five times with her indignant snout; but    I.   i500 THE COM HSTORY OF TEE UNITED STATES   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS,.-    501 the wee one only laughed at her impotent raillery, and pitched back at her such crashing logic, that she rolled back again with her maw wholly unsated. On the part of the Monitor -it was a Word-en-a blow. The well-hammered arguments, taught by the new system of military logic, carried alarming weight wherever maritime questions are chopped. Farragut and Porter soon after got up a yachting party, consisting of forty-five vessels, to cruise through the Gulf and up to New Orleans. Forty miles up from the river's mouth they encounteredForts Philip and Jackson, great chains, anchored hulks, and batter- ies, from which came very loud talk, and earnest pro- testations against any farther proceeding on the part of the yachtsmen. At length, however, by cutting the chain, the entire party, except two, pushed through in a terrible iron hail-storm, and reached the Crescent City, where they were received with terrific demon- strations, bonfires of fifteen thousand bales of cotton, illuminated blockade-runners, shipping, sugar, turpen- tine, molasses, and other loose-lying combustibles. Such an incendiary place had to be well secured; and on the 1st of May it was put' into the firm charge of the Union Butler, who occasionally uncorked its riotous effervescence; and bottled up some of the more fermenting qualities. Meanwhile the. long waiting public called for the fine drilling party in front of Washington, numbering nearly two hundred thousand, faithfully schooled for Richmond.  Early in April, headed by General Me- M Clellan, it reached the old Revolutionary camping-   502 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ground at Yorktown. Although, in fact, only five thousand Confederates were stationed there, the Fed-; eral leader suspected traps' ahead, and so went for a month to vigorous spading, road-making, and mining, resuming in this way his early occupations and tastes. These gratified, and no traps found, the army began on the 3d of May to move towards the Chickahominy,- a sluggish, soupy stream, thickened by swamp muds and miasma,-which was reached May 20th and crossed. There was now more spading, and in sight of the Richmond spires. For six-weeks, alas! the spade was busy, not for the living only, through this Golgotha of the war; for now commenced a series of death-dealing combats sel- dom equalled in our well-mounded planet: May- 27th the battle of Hanover. Court-House, the Confederates losing; followed by four days of severe skirmishes; succeeded by the gigantic struggle of forty-eight un- ceasing hours of death-heaping on  both sides, at Fair Oaks-Station, between the corps of Sumner, Heintzelman, Kearny, and Hooker,' on one side, and Joseph E. Johnston, the Confederate commander, Long- street, and the two Hills, on the other; then three weeks of .intrenching, sickness, and decimation; and then on the 25th of June, the retreat to the, James, crowded with six days of ceaseless combats, embroid- ering in gloriously ensanguined characters on the shredding flag of the Potomac the well-fought but disastrous battles of Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mills, Savage's Station, White-Oak Swamp, gnd Malvern Hill, in which fifteen thousand Union lives were spent.   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND  TMUSKETS.   BU General Lee was placed in command of the Confed- erates in the place of General Johnston, wounded at Fair Oaks; and General Halleck displaced General Mc- Clellan, wounded before he left Washington in his military reputation, and, though unhurt bodily, more severely injured by his Peninsular campaign. General Pope was assigned to the head of the Army of the Potomac, but showed in fifteen days of fighting along the Eappahannock that, like another Pope on the Tiber, he was not at all infallible. In September General Lee took a trip into Mary- land, which he hoped to extend to Philadelphia. He was, however, followed by General McClellan, rein- stated to the leadership of his old army. Their meet- ings at South Mountain and  Antietam swept thirty thousand Confederates under ground or into hospitals, largely counterbalancing the Peninsular losses. Cotton had become very mixed, and its skeins tan- gled and knotted. Difficult and dark questions now travelled to Wash- ington,'and closely besieged Mr. Lincoln. Calmly, pa- tiently, and good-humoredly he sat down with them in a conference to which-his own good sense and large- hearted wisdom were-invited. The result was that New-Year's day, 1863, free papers were plumped into the lean, slave stockings throughout all the somehow seceded States. During this period history and paper money were both made in large quantities; and the paper business became very lucrative. We, were -getting rich very fast after the European fashion. In the midst of: the armed clash, however, a very Pacific act was corn-   504 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. mitted, - the passage in July, 1862, of the Pacific Rail- road charter, which gave one hundred millions of rea- sons why the Union could not be broken. So far from giving up the South, Congress provided for making Japan and China American dependencies; reaching out with steel fingers for their teas, silks, and almond- eyed live productions. The, year 1863 dawned cheerfully upon the hitherto sombre whites North,as well as upon the more sombre sable loyalists at the South. Blockades on the coast, a currency as depraved as Breckenridge; railroads undu- lating as saws, over which phthisicy engines groaned, as they drew the ever-lessening transportation; and a population rapidly sieved by repeated drafts, signalled the ravages to which the Confederacy was subjected, and its lessening means constantly clipped and pared away. The curious stories of Mr. Davis had neither wrought a faith beyond his own equestrian escort, nor drawn any recognition from foreign spectators. Little was done through the winter in the field. Early in May, General Hooker, successor to Burn- side, and the fifth leader of the Potomac Army, having gained Lee's rear at Chancellorsville, kicked it severely for three hot days; but was in turn kicked roundly. ]Each army lost about sixteen thousand men,--losses which, if united, would equal the entire number of the American troops engaged in the four principal battles of the Revolution, - Bunker Hill, Princeton, Saratoga, and Yorktown.  While this prolonged fight was going forward, Stoneman and Kilpatrick showed some astound- ing feats of horsemanship, in swinging around Fred- ericksburg and  Richmond; cutting the Confederate              , '  ' 'I   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.    505 lines with such nimble swords that it delighted an enthusiastic audience. In June, Lee, masking large designs on Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, crossed the Potomac and showed his own face with uncounted others at Gettys- burg in Pennsylvania, where, for the first three days in July, he was so handled by Meade, that he left 30,000 dead and wounded, 14,000 prisoners, and 27,000 stand of arms, to add attractions, that need no special adver- tising to Springs that receive so much. The next day, July 4, Vicksburg, fruitlessly assailed during 1862, and beleagured from May 4, 1863, by the reticent, self-contained, ever-pounding, never-com- pounding Grant, - who had inextricably tangled it by parallels and lines unparalleled, - surrendered its army of 30,000 men, 70,000 small arms, 200 cannon, with- out reckoning those dangerous edge-tools, for the use :of which its desperate gamblers had so long been famous. Fortunately the surrender came too late to be abused by the orators of that patient and long- suffering day. The Mississippi River once more bore all its pipes in peace. The mortar-boat masons,'clearing away the ruins which the strikers had caused, had prepared anew the foundations for the prosperity of that noble valley, whose exuberant wealth is hereafter to be rolled adown it -by unshackled hands. While the troops were absent from New York, repel- ling Lee's invasion of Pennsylvania, and the black regi- ments before Charleston were assisting Gilmore to execute the stern Federal judgment upon that place, the anti-war Irish in New York, largely left away 22   506  THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. from the, front by their own consent, gained the peaceful rear of the native-born colored men, women, and children of that city, and took a safe hand in the only kind of contest which they coveted. The valor which for three days they displayed, in destroying property wholly unowned, of course, by themselves, in chasing and hanging colored people, and in robbing all who had watches or purses to furnish lines for their avaricious bravery to attack, was, by a few, almost as much admired as the heroic courage of the regiments before Charleston. At Chattanooga, Grant, in the latter part of Novem- ber, by a heaven-touching struggle of three days, drove away the .Confederate forces out of the cloud-hidden heights of Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain. From- this Tabor he himself came down, but not to Bragg of the transfiguration there. All now admitted that cotton was very mixed and seedy. DIVISION THRD. COTTON WORSTED.

One  rested on-Southern   Arkansas, braced by some eighty thousand regular soldiers; one on Georgia, propped by General Johnston and a large force, drawing their supplies from  the corn-cribs of that empire State of the South; anfd the third and strongest,- planted on the Rapidan, and steadied up by the well-sinewed arm of General Lee. Between these rude legs, however, were springing already along the furrows made by the ploughshare of strife -the sweet-, eyed daisies. Corn gathered its golden blooms out-of the dreadful phosphates which had been strewn over so many fields. Yet while nature's healings were already anointing the ragged wounds of incisive war, over other and wide districts came ills which almost defied the bungling surgeries and irregular- apothecary appliances that were wasted upon or unwisely aggravated them. In these districts predatory bands hovered over and constantly lit upon disorganized and broken industries, as crows cawingly follow a disrupted herd of buffaloes or swoop upon the wounded which fall out of the straggling march. The harryings of cattle; the plunder of farm- steads, of bean-patches, nursed by the patient labor of suddenly made widows,-  and even of houses seemingly secure from their proximity to villages; wayside mur-   508 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UN'rTID STATES. ders from concealed coverts; midnight shots at men asleep in bed, or treacherously called out on pretended errands of charity, and hewn down, frayed and fretted the lives of those who still clung to the Union through- out the Border States. There were daily tragedies, sad- der than the tinselled shows of the stage. There were masqueraders who danced through desultory cruelties at which even the readers of novels, languid over ordi- nary stories, enkindle into activity and excitement, and family feuds encrimsoning their way into living sor- rows and eventually into tales, which in mercy we call fictions. The winter and spring of 1864 pendulated with balanced successes and    reverses to either combat- ant.             - In March, General Grant was made Commander-in- Chief, and immediately set on foot a plan to wake up the uneasy sleeper and free him from   the nightmare. This plan was to start simultaneously, and to keep in motion, the various corps of the Federal army; Sher- man's one hundred thousand at Chattanooga against Johnston's army in Georgia; Banks's and Farragut's in conjunction against Mobile; and Grant himself, unit- ed with   Meade, against Lee and   Richmond: thus shredding, at the same time, the still suspended cotton curtain, and preventing its busy stitchers at one point from assisting those making repairs at another. Meade crossed the- Rapidan, May 4th, and advanced towards Richmond, giving Lee a very lively hunt through the Wilderness for a month, and at length driving him over the soupy and astonished Chickahominy.   At the same time Grant, holding his spirited team well in hand,   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.    509 drove up also towards the Confederate capital, until he halted on the south side of the James. Soon after, in order to divert attention from that long-coveted spot, Richmond, General Jubal E. Early lmade into Maryland a raid, which he repeated in July, but from which he was sent whirling back into the Shenandoah valley. He' renewed his experiments lagain in September and October, but was finally chased out by Sheridan and his centaurs, who seemed to mount the wind, and, on their rapid and supperless rides to live off condensed night air. ft i Along the hyperborean lines rang the warning after the discomfited Confederate:-- "The year of Jubal E. is come, Return, ye wandering sinners, home.' In the Southeast, Sherman, flanking Johnston at Dalton in Georgia, forced him through May and June southwards, delivering battles and defeats,--which were not ordered,--at Resaca, Dallas,. Pine Lost, and Kenesaw ,Mountains, until at last he shoved him be- hind the great southern knob, Atlanta, whose con- verging iron lines held the main door of the Lower Confederacy. Here Johnston disappeared, and the Confederate powers Put a Hood over the head of    / the assailed Southeast; but all in vain. Sherman, pounding about the iron-covered Hood with heavy blows through July and August, cleft the head-piece in two; and on the 2d of September cast him out, and, seizing the great iron knob, opened wide the door. On the 15th of November Sherman advanced through Georgia to the sea, taking- a- swath -sixty miles wide, rolling up winrows at Milledgeville, cut-   510 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. ting down thistles, burdocks, and noxious weeds w: his well-whetted scythe, until, on the 21st of Dece: ber, he reached the farther side of his great hay-fi( at Savannah. Gathering its crop into one bundle, despatched it to Mr. Lincoln with this epistle: "I b to present you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Sava nah, with one hundred and fifty guns, plenty of al munition, and also about twenty-five thousand bales , cotton."

The real sap in the Davis tree was now running\ down, and the top branches were shedding their crimson colors earth- ward.  While these paling evidences of the fall were multi- plying, Mr. Lincoln was re-elected President,-by two  hundred and twelve votes out of two hundred and thirty-three. Andrew Johnson, then fifty-six years old, who had both early and late in life handled the goose, - the one kind as acceptably as the otr, - and had been himself cruelly plucked through the war, by the masked plunderers in Tennessee, was placed in the easy nest of the Vice-Presidency. His first get- ting in was so awkward, that it was manifest some- thing had turned his head. Sherman, taking breath at Savannah, again swung his effective scythe through the thin crop, lying be- tween that city and Charleston, which was cut down, like a rank burdock, February 18, 1865. Then turn- ing northwards, he gathered in Columbia, the capital of South Carolina; turned up to the sunlight dank villages, all unused to Northern implements, - cheered  as he went by sable faces, until at last he halted at Fayetteville, March 11,J1865, to take a hearty shake of the' hand with his fellow-mowers, General Terry and Admiral Porter. From Wilmington, he again whet- ted up his keen blade and cleared the Southern field. Johnston, Beauregard, Bragg, and Hardee manifested a disposition to stop him at Bentonville ; but a blow sent them reeling from his path, and he went vigorously for- ,   512 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.

The autumn leaves here fell on busy workers; - and among the busiest, the Silent Man, who was cast-  ing up long accounts in his head, which only opened   .ii to let out smoke. In him, however, there was much    i fire, American and Greek.  On the 24th of March, the Silent Man issued an    i order for a centripetal movement on Richmond., Lee, ' in every way tried to break the conveing fate.  Along the Appomattox River, at Fort Stedm n, and  at every weak-looking place, he hurled himself  against the links of a chain, now slowly drawing around him; but all to no purpose. On the 2d of     ' April Grant -broke through Lee's intrenched lines  about Petersburg; and Lee at once disturbed J. Davis, "ii although at church in Richmond, by a sudden notice that Petersburg and Richmond were insecure places,    i'i and that he must flee to other refuges, than his old   i ones. Neither sitting nor lying would now do; and    ; accordingly the head of the Confederacy took to his  feet, and fled with the few depraved treasures which had not gone already to corruption. Hurrying through . Richmond, he got 'away as fast as a very un-express train would carry him, over railroads hacked by Sheri- dan, Stoneman, and Grierson.  The next morning- General Weitzel entered the capital of the dissolving Confederacy- so long held by, brave men--with a 22      *      GG   *i1 th1 .   514 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. body of colored troops, - representatives of that fate which four years before had been ignorantly invoked, and now rapidly fulfilling,--representatives, too, of those one hundred and eighty thousand others, with skins colored like their own, who had given themselves to the service of a Union, whose stripes they had often felt, and whose stars for them had just peeped above the eastern hills and were beginning to sing for joy. Lee. at once commenced a retreat towards the Southl- west, hoping to unite his broken forces with Johnston, who, however, was too actively taken up by Sherman to reciprocate his intentions. At Amelia Court-House Sheridan and-- his centaurs suddenly appeared before the astonished Confederates on the 6th of April, and cut seven thousand away from them. The remainder General Lee dragged forward to Appomattox Court- House, and there delivered them over to the generous justice of his brother-in-arms, the silent-lipped, whose magnanimity was a fit type of the large forbearance of a country,: which, wronged by a causeless war,- generated for ends that in other lands would have brought its authors to the place where all ropes termi-- nate, has to look back on no crosses, but for itself. A really fine character, a great strategist, and per- sonally brave man, the chief of the Confederate Army, who had delivered such " bloody instructions to the fathers, became the head of a college, and deals out, it is to be hoped, better lessons to the sons. This surrender was followed, on the 26th of April by that of Johnston; on the 4th of May, by' the re- maining Confederate forces under General Dick Taylor; by the miscellaneous taking of Mobile, Selma, Tus-   THE WAR OF IDEAS AND MUSKETS.     515     X caloosa, and Montgomery, and the unfortunate capture    j, of Mr. J.

Fastness, except in the colors of our cheeks and chintzes and   in the movement of our mails, works its curious ways through all manifestations of Ameri- can civilization.   Over a small, old, long-cultivated territory, like most of the European, life moves re-, spectably slow, careful of its savings, gathered up by centuries of work and put out at low     rates of inter- est; across continental stretches like ours, sweeping in wide districts and   materials of   unbundled, aching o                        ,@B   VELOCIPEDAL.         517  '   -/ plenty, it hastens with panting speed, and can afford to  j lose everything except time. Our great areas, there-  fore, make us lively, their vast opportunities, restless, wide-talking, and manifesting the generous coarseness   ; of a large-grained breadth. Out of these alone would  come marked characteristics; but when -these are fur- i ther quickened by accelerating activities of discovery in all departments, and by mechanical inventions of      vast power in translating man and his products over the earth, the result is rapid brain-work, stimulating  i action, quick combinations, eruptive and vivacious speech.  M. Varet, a French savan, has ascertained that a fly  - caught by him in France made three hundred andg thirty movements of his wings in a second. This is     a rapid work; but a Wall Street bull will toss-his horns twice as fast.    . The larger trains of thought thus started will run i of themselves with time-table exactness. We shall only accompany a few special excursion ideas a short  distance from the main depot.     - An impatient unrest under discipline and restric-  tions, while kept below fever heat by the wet bandages   j of a self-imposed law, makes jails double punishments   i for American criminals, and homes often houses for  the detention of juveniles under sixteen. Confine-  ments, except to a small class of our married popula-   i tion, is an abridgment of enterprising work, which,    e if continued beyond a natural law that prescribes sleep to all and a longer period of inactivity to the special  i class just named, would be a grievance, calling at least  for a convention, addresses, and agitation to get rid of. j ' i    518 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. -The distress of hurry which vexes the vis inertiea out of our brains, stirs our intellectual pans continually, so that we do not always get the natural cream of ideas. An American is always working for condensed milk processes; to compress a cow into a milk-pot, or utilize all the herds in his neighborhood on his breakfast- table, in a way unheard of elsewhere, Of course this wide--reaching hurry, which grasps large results arid scorns the domestic   economies, that occupy the thoughts of people elsewhere, refuses to be concerned for any length of time with the importunities of suf- fering stomachs. American stomachs have not time enough to wait on nature. Hence doctors' gigs and apoplectic whirli-  gigs. A patent stomach that should grind grist for a neighborhood or village, and leave, the unstomached worker to avail himself of his accelerating opportuni- ties, would command a high price. It would be hired out around the neighborhood, like a threshing-machine  or corn-sheller. In fact, American households might in general be- dvantageously grouped around or framed into one of these mechanical digesters, with attach- ments for washing out, ironing, and starching their clothes, and for doing up the wasteful processes of visiting, to economic advantages that would tell on the census. One of the disadvantages would be the dis- cofiragement of that branch of American industry, now so largely prosperous,-of doctors' bills, chasing in vain after many of the living and at last' only overtaking the administrator of the estate, clean out of breath.

It is curious to see how the handles of :Aid these jointpumping and pocket-exhausting companies  ! all lie towards the great cities.            l Most of the business in the United States, north of Washington, is carrie on after an express and ac eer- aste fashion, which is impatient of holidays, and rides over the Fourth of July even, as  ruthlessly asan ex-  press-train over the human obstruction which thus  gets forwarded on his journey out of the United States with a despatch almost  enviable to the   srvivorspeedy Even the Federal Constitution prescribes "  speedy  trials" a s a riglt, and treats a man as injured who  that all are minute-en,    know the qick step; hile the uncommon law in Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada, and Colorado dispenses with the tedious confinement s between the apprehension  of the accused and his  transporting sentence and uprising. "Delaysaredan- gerous," is their condensed code. The-law of dower, as practically enforced, is shaped by the same rapidly revolring lathe, which makes so uc  of our domestic hollo-ware. The wife spends the principa before her husband's death, and thus shuns the tedious complications of legalproceedings,   520 .THE CoMC MSTORy OF THE UNITED STATES.

A marked improvement has also been made in the distribution of estates generally. Among the slow nations of Europe the children generally wait for the unfortunate old people to die before taking their prop- erty. This tardy habit is now found to be often produc- tive of great injury to children, especially to those who, i snatched away by rapid manners before their begettors,  are thus defrauded of their shares. "A .bird in the    I hand" is no longer a rara avis, but a domestic fowl . cultivated by rapid feeding. Gifts to the living avoid ' the taxes and discomforts of probate courts, in which    it is disagreeable -for a family, covered with crape, to a sit and see a politician assess the' estate upon the    heirs.                  '        I Fast progress has been made, also, in preventive jus- tice. Injunctions, behind whose shields such old fogies as Lord Eldon, Lord Somers, Lord Thurlow, John Mar-    , shall, or William Story were accustomed to hide     ' threatened rights until the 'danger was- over-past, have i recently been turned edgewise, and 9ut down corpora- ,tions and others obnoxious Fisc-ally or otherwise, or else pressed against them so that they perspired away their adipose stock until they were comfortably ready for a receiver. The doctrine of divorce, whichihas  puzzled the learned John Miltons in all the sleepy ages that have    dozed before us, has been, in many States, simplified, . so that he who runs through them may read a decree. Some people have uncharitably supposed that the pre-   , miums offered to individual disunions by such States i i I   522 THE COMC HSTORy OF THE UNITED STATES. as Illinois and Indiana, were devices to draw specu I lators thither for a day or so; but these are vagrant suspicions that ought not to be allowed on our trains. In feudal countries, where purity of blood is careful-  ly guarded,--inasmuch as the descents to property are B the rule and not descents from it as in America, -legists declare that a woman may not marry her cousin, her uncle, her grandfather, or even her father,-a wise enough restriction, perhaps, for such benighted folks,  and where care in marrying often leaves the female part of the household to the dangerous company of these relations until far-on in life. But with us women are not shut up to any such necessities, except in Utah, where they may, ins the course of a respectably long Iete, marry tlrough every genealogical degree without snowing it. In other parts they are as necessary as nsurance companies, and so marry very soon; so  hat silver weddings are often seen at an early age, rhile golden matrimonies are more frequent than ma- umities or patrimonies. To every thoughtful man, who roves about otr rapidly dissolving surfaces, where the Pilroad car is the kaleidoscope which turns up the ts of humanity iln new combinations, a wife is neces- ry to put up a monument over him; for moving on such a fixed law, - the only fixed thing in America, cept debt and live corruption, - that while he was ming his majority, all his family relations would ve gone to other States. the two curiosities in the United States 'are fat )ple and servants. Both run away in a velocipedal ?ry; the former into sharp bargains, and the latter independent powers which dictate treaties and  : --         A.

An American family is like a South Carolina regiment,  ! all officers and no privates; a boarding-house, a Swiss confederacy, in which the cantons, wedged into neutral- izing elements, get forward like a stool braced every- - - way and equipoised into an aching discomfort; and a.  -hotel, like twenty German Bunds entangled by contra-  0 rious independent interests that knot themselves into teasing discontents, and fret into jars which hold a  variety of unpreserved, acidulating fruits. The freest joke in all America is one of its large hotels, which fancies Axminster carpets and chandeliers in a' large  a parlor, and numerous discomforts packed in ever-dwin-   dling rooms, to be happiness. But then the { gentle- manly proprietor" makes up for all this in the bills, which convince all the guests, that they must have enjoyed themselves and at an American rate of speed. Trade has also had its great advances, not only in  i the figures which stand in merchants' magazines like pyramids, with bases always widening downwards, but in the dwindling measures, quarts, gallons, pecks, and bushels, and the waning qualities which sharpen up- wards to steady apexes.  How to make up in the bill'what is taken from the body is a critical study, in ' H lwhich most tradesmen have, without any prizes offered  by outsiders, become great proficients. If that man is a public benefactor who makes two blades grow in the  place of one, surely he may be rewarded with a passing i notice, who takes all the steel out of the one sent to  him for repairs, and then divides up the instrument into X i. iH several blades.

To make a- small measure go twice as far as a large one is more than a feat; it approaches creation. What may in time be considered a double bed, it is impos- sible yet to foresee; but certain it is, that while single beds are increasing to an alarmingly wide. extent, their narrowness is becoming such as .to require a new defi- nition of a line to avoid disagreeableh collisions. Mercantile failures, elsewhere hurtfxri ae with us hurried on into vivacious benefits, dividing up, before the expiration of the credits given, the accumulated profits which otherwise might accumulate in stagnating dulness in the firm. A  steady 'increase of wages is solving, too, those perplexing theories how to balance capital and labor; a weekly distribution of earnings keeping down injudicious balances in the bank. The frequent jumps of men from  low places into high ones, with a celerity very pleasing to their fami- lies and often to their creditors, show that the world is governed too much; for acting on this- Jeffersonian maxim, most of these ready leapers leave off the gov- erning part and expend their activities in securing, along with their weak salaries, strong flying benefits, which only light on the vigilant. While the velocipedal ways of Americans thus cut across their own country, it is in foreign fields that   VELOCIPEDAL.         525   i they are most striking and cutting. Crossing the well-  Worn athts of Europe, scattering high-premium gold  !! on those jolly fellows,. landlords and waiters, they ridge ] its old historic surfaces with little histories which the facetious persons, who catch sight of them as they whiz through histories) which they leave grandly be- hind them and all uknown, retail with as much glee, as the travellers themselves once did s aleratus, fine-cut nails, or bobinet. Their- scant intellectual' stores and i unfurnished stock of knowledge, so far from embarrass- ing, only enable them to spin on faster. Mythology, paintings, biographies, architecture, are soon wound up  i on their clean spindles. Another class, like aeronautic vessels, have gaseous heads and heavy undergearing, which enable; them to run over and run down everything abroad by swift-mov- ing slangs. They always float by the bad air of their own heads, and are apt to anchor in vicious soils. These they can-can.. The spent money surprises the hotel squeezers; the spent morals astonish themselves by the ease with which they lose their little all. But of all the fast classes in America, that is the most velocipedal which, having expressed themselves through the modish follies of the largest American cities, are transported to the stronger vices of Paris. Tired of tapping the younger trees of American growth, they spend the rest of their precious lives in pecking assiduously the rotten parts of foreign woods, content with the phosphoric slime of decay and dissolving maturities.   CHAPTER XXT.

The heroic holders of the sabre and musket,--their   j stern, sad work now done, bore them back, - draped in  sable for the comrades who slept in trenched glory along the furrowed parallel, in the storm-swept field,  J or on the banks of the Mississippi, the Chickahominy  and James, - back to the plough, to the workshop, to the peaceful businesses of life, to reunions with those  whose busy fingers and busier hearts had forwarded to   them love messages and mindful tokens while absent, The army of fighters was disbanded into battalions of workers. ' - On the 29th of May the new President commenced the Sisyphus business of Southern reconstruction; first rolling to the top of the. hill the stone of a pro- visional government for North Carolina, which, of course, rolled back again, covered by the old shells of  the Confederacy. By the middle of July he had tugged up the same stone under different names, as Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, Alabama, FErida,and South Carolina, only to find it rolling down speedily, hurting the colored people and Union whites, and creating a butternut-colored atmosphere all around it. The en- tertainment was too often repeated to be jocose, except to Mr. Johnson, who believed in a detached idea in- dustriously pursued. The delegates to Congress under his scheme, who presented themselves at Washington, in December, 1865, were found to- be all of the saffron I complexion and hue. They had already forgotten that there had been any war, and only remembered their   i ancient rights, and were ready to draw back pay,:or   528 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED- STATES. anything else back, except declarations of not having been in the least wrong in the late little unpleasantness; Congress read their own privileges, rights, and duties in quite a different way ;'declared their exclusive right, as representatives of the people, to deal with the new puzzles; passed the Freedmen's Bureau Bill for the protection of the colored property of the South, the Civil Rights Bill, and the proposed Fourteenth Con- stitutional Amendment. While they believed in the dead past burying its dead, they did not embrace the idea of its burying the'living with them. Mr. Johnson now studied the Art of Vetoing Made Easy; and from his cross-readings began to add im- mensely to the American official archives by Xanthippe messages, whose unlovely words have greatly embossed the rich cabinets of vituperative specimens, for a long time accumulating at Washington. In July, 1866, a riot was created in New Orleans, - the counterpart of the pat-riot disturbances in New York three years before, - in which thirty-four loyal colored and three' loyal colorless people were added to- the Crescent cemeteries. The citizens who had participated in the bonfires and illuminations, on the arrival of Fa rragut and Porter in 1862 were merci- fully spared. In August following, the acting Presi- dent, accompanied by Mr. Seward, -whose wonderful pen through the silent diplomatic struggle abroad, which ran parallel with the armed strife at home, cannot, be alluded to with scant praise, - set out for Chicago, to lay the corner-stone of a-.monument to the powerful dike-breaker. Never was a journey so long. The road thither seemed to have got intoxicated -and   PUZZLES ANDi -CRBOSS-READNGS. 529  ou InrC uMsU HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. reeled and tumbled all over the West; while the jerky speeches, hiccuping ,along the wavy ways endeavored in vain to catch up with and to: find the President. -This year was made memorable by the establish- "ment of a wonderful republic for Ireland in Union Square, New York, and the quiet election, without any votes, of Mr. Roberts to be its head; an Irish inven- tion, for the easy solution of that perplexing question of how to get enough votes, most praiseworthy. The novel mode of raising an army, and of replenishing a treasury, whose invisible outflow was so steady and well regulated that it never perplexed Wall Street, were admirable illustrations of the good-nature of the friendly sons and daughters of Saint Patrick. The sham-rock, on which they touched poured out streams as abundant as the rock which Moses struck. Indeed, it was almost as good a milch cow as Plymouth Rock. In February, 1867, the French moths,- hatched out in 1862 in a Napoleonic fancy nest, and darting off into Mexico, through whose chronic flames they played with the usual results,--were terribly scorched in a candle sent out by Mr. Seward.   The head moth, Maximilian, fascinated by the gilt of an imperial- candelabra, was so burnt, that he disappeared like the vagaries of South American empire, which hovered on the wings of that other Gallic moth, that now flits around the gas-jets of the Tuiler'ies. Mr. Johnson's amnesties and pardons are too nu- merous for anything but a calculating-machine. He began May 29, 1865, and only ended March 4, 1869.   PUZZLES AND CROSS--READINGS.     531    J Tired of cross-reading the Constitution, he betook him- self to Scripture, and, with his. mode of interpretation, spelt out a duty to forgive all of the unrepentant, in- eluding Mr. J. Davis, the prize-taking Breckenridge, and other conspicuous sinners.                In spite of the semi-weekly vetoes, however, which obliged Congress to pass all laws twice, it contrived to reconstruct all of the lately disorganizing and disor- ganized States except Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas.   A Some very poor Northern timber and unconstitutional braces were wrought into the hastily constructed and urgently needed fabrics, which, however, it is to be hoped, will be speedily removed. Angry with the so-  lution of the puzzles, the President attempted to read   ! athwart the Tenure of Office Act Mr. Stanton's war     1 duties, for which, March 5, 1869, he was requested by the House of Representatives to appear before the Sen- ate and make answer. From March 29th to May 16th  his trial lasted, interflecked by some fine veins of    I forensic eloquence, and at last bringing out the value of a single vote,-- that which prevented conviction,- - for the benefit of future electoral harangues. The restless, lever pen of Mr. Seward pried up new    i territory for the'screaming eagle to light upon, the distant and hazy Alas-ka, rich in ices and other cool reasons, and St. Thomas the Danish, whose abundant lemons may, when well mixdd, allay, without quench- ing, our thirst for foreign drinks.

Efforts were made the same year to annex New- York to the Erie Railway and to change its name to Fisk-ville. These efforts might have succeeded,/but that the attention/of the leading proprietor was diverted to the Pacific; and the motion for the expected change was postponed to a later term of the Supremest Court in the city of New York.  The last feat of Mr. Johnson was to get Mudd out of the Dry Tortugas.  , .  .    .          ; :: :r-   f PUZZLES AND OROSS-READINGS. :533    CHAPTER XXTI.

M   OST  people suppose that it is difficult to write history:in advance.    There is no greater delu- sion.   Facts -  even when we can get at them    and are sure of them, which    seldom  happens --are great ob- structions to a narrative.   They involve    sudden  leaps   TAKEN FOR GRANTED.       535 into unforeseen depths of human action, perplexing struggles through very dynastic uncertainties, or as-   cents to unexpected developments of character, trying to one's judgment and patience, and often hurtful to one's pride of opinion. -, Our preconceptions, unverified by a set of obstinate facts, are distressed by the un-' satisfactory contradictions. We halt dissatisfied on a, i dusty road, which the tramp of events has worn smooth, and left nothing to novelty or an industrious fancy. Besides, the great majority of readers are -partisans, and have a right to be disappointed at and to blame- those unreasoning conclusions, which slide inevitably out of realities. They confront sternly those facts, m;ll ffront  them, ; by  illsn nnhRnPn in; which affront them, by insisting on happening in a way or order different from their expectations or wishes. Hitherto, we have been obliged to conform to  the hard conditions thus inherent in actual chronicles, and have been forced to submit our readers to these annoying certainties. We can, however, now  dismiss these tantalizing fixities of events, which have run before us, and left- us the wearisome business of catching up to them; and leaving them  to overtake us, if they can, to write up a future history of events, which ought to  happen, and which will greatly disappoint the sanguine expectations of Americans if they do not. The excuse, for failure will be lessened by the outlined path which we here stretch downward into the wooded -future. We take it for granted, then, that all our future Presi- ! dents will be the very best and most competent men--in the nation, spontaneously acclainated to the office, and-   5836 THE COMC HSTORY OF-THE UNITED STrATES. -not wrung- out by industrious party conventions$ for political ends. Uncommitted to committees or political sponsors, and unweighted by onerous gratitude -to ex- working party canvassers, they will naturally hereafter pensively appoint to Cabinet places and diplomatic posts statesmen of pre-eminent ability, patriotism, and integ- rity, who will as modestly wait to be invited ill, as the same class now, when in, stand as if hopelessly deaf, to be distinctly invited out. That they will reluctantly, if at all, subject weak. citizens to the pains and penalties of executing and garroting the laws, or the slow and unpractised, to:the heavy tasks of carrying the public burdens. The public debt will naturally disappear. Perhaps some fortunate speculator in petroleum or Erie stock will pay it off, rather than hrave it in the way, or see it left to bear the market inopportunely. The secret of making money scarce will lead doubtless to the dis- covery of making it plenty; and then the public debt, being of no use to anybody, will naturally stand aside, as poor relations in times of plenty. Besides, gentle- men- being selected, not for their own interests, but for the public good, will, it is to be expected, donate their salaries to a sinking fund, which will carry it off, as some companies do their stockholders' dividends, to un- fathomed bottoms. In fact, if the debt could be cut ,up into dividends, nothing more would be heard of it. If the whole truth may be-safely told, the difficulty in -the extinguishment of the debt will not be so much in its undoubted disappearance, as in settling upon that  plan among the numbers presented, which will be per- mitted to-hurry it out of sight,.              ,'   TAKEN FOR GRANTED.       537  Of course, when the Federal obligations quit, the  State and city debts will not have the face, to, remain behind. These subjects out of the way, members of Congress,   I being then gentlemen, as well as educated, capable, and  n honest men, dragged unwillingly from and not into     1 business, will deal with the few remaining topics with h a wise silen ce,- and this course we take for grant-ed  j now;; or else will discuss them and not each other, or    the encyclopmedia of unrelated questions, the publication i of which now so enhances the price of paper. This improvement in our Congressional debates will have a corresponding advantage, also, to those foreign- ers who, desirous of learning our system, venture upon the speeches made at the Capitol, and, hopelessly mis- led by the terms employed, and the ferocious adjectives that commit horrible murders on almost every para- graph, confound our geography with-that of the Can- nibal Islands., We also take it for granted, that our r public men will wait for events to justify the ,crude t speculations, which they toss out in conversations with reporters, before cruelly amusing the good-natured public withy their vaticinations. Possibly, too, the  spread of common schools and Sunday schools, teaching  . grammar and morality, may lead to the disuse by our  print-rushing politicians of styles of .speech quite in- i comprehensible, and of words so raw in outline and so destitute of middle letters as to lead profane people to fancy that they are imitations of "their own heedless expressions. Of course, in the better days now dawn- ing, ":rings " will only be used to tie quadrupeds- to posts, or to restrain vicious bipeds in state prisons. 23* *"   538 THE COM' HSTORY OF THE UNIrED STATES. Combinations to do good and increase the general happiness will naturally supplant those curious Ameri- can circles, whose peripheries are not , equidistant from the centre, but which consist in fact only of a centre, and that centre, self. Happiness, and not wealth, being thus the main pursuit, of course many kinds of occupations, now   i called business, such as brokers; money-lenders, etc., will cease, and those now engaged in these so-called pursuits - of others, will look after the poor to minis- ter unto them and not to take them in. The sulperior' claims of charity upon the fortunate, who are now living, will naturally be enhanced by the fact that, being at present in the w6rld, they cannot reasonably expect to live much longer than 1970, and may quit much earlier, leaving some selfish heirs not disposed ;p divide except for. an equivalent. Many judges being released from their present ardu- us duties of so administering law as to get re-elected -for   then no one will value an office so much a inecure- -will have some time, especially in New ork, to study law, and some courts of appeal can be epealed. The only injunctions issued will be oral, elivered, not to'railroad speculators, but to indiscreet iveniles, unwarily betrayed into their first and last fience. The expense of court-houses being thus par- ally saved, it is. expected, that the small unventilated laces in which law is peddled out will be .enlarged, id a  humane effort be thus made to save the exposed res of suitors, lawyers, jurors, and judges. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty Animals will naturally, with larger means, extend   TAKEN FOR GRANTED.       -539    its operations, and embrace employers, -suffering- from  servants of, independent ways, from domestics who take six evenings in the week out, and allow their  mistress one, and who, for certain discreet considera- tions, not worth mentioning here, permit those, who   2 divide their estates with them, to occupy a portion of the same house, on condition of not interfering with-  their separate apartments. We also take it for grafted, that woman's rights will not be wrongfully urged or withheld; but will be- so; adjusted, that the public will ascertain what some people would ask for, if they did not become incomprje- hensible through abundant talking, or what--con- Bidering the modesty of the applicants - they really ought to have, although they do not clamor for it in a way that makes some suspect, that men are either to be extinguished outright, or else kept for a few hundred years on probation, until they shall have learned to be respectful, just, and unmanlike. /In this coming good time,:men and women are to be equal, - especially the women. If any differences are discovered in any way between them, these differ- ences are to be submitted to conventions chosen by the wisest women, and the differences either to be entirely suppressed, or the dissenters all expelled from the United States. Uniformity is to be secured at all hazards. If necessary, ballot-boxes will be attached  1 to cradles; and women, by any cause confined from active canvassing, will be allowed to vote twice at the next election, in order to bring up their rights to a point where nature left them.             !

Should reform in this direction not take place as just anticipated, then we shall expect that-infantile precocities will be utilized before they shall have evaporated into the insipidities of manhood and wo- manhood. At present, it is well understood, children are anachronisms, sadly out of place, squandering uselessly their best powers without ally corresponding responsibilities; legally treated as minors, when they are in fact majors; denied the legal rights tot marry until they reach a period when marriage is tame and idle, and the means to support a wife are exhausted; prohibited from going to Congress and being, Presi- dents, while full of original ideas and administrative ability, and allowed to go when they have oozed away through the leakages of active growths all capacity, and become just- -what we see them at Washington; and wasting in pantalets the money which, if suf- fered, they might earn better than the old heads which are now only figure-heads. We shail not be surprised to see, if not during Grant's time, at least-before the century runs out, a   ? - --TAKEN FOR GRANTED.       541  constitutional amendment relieving aged Americans --those, for example, who have attained the ripe, very : ripe age of twenty-one -from the duties and, cares of - office, and securing to the public the benefit of young' vigorous intellects, varying from twelve to seventeen   j years of age.                       I The happy results of this change will be apparent -to any infant mind. Short-jacketed M. C.'s will     \ impart new vivacity to Congressional debate; young  ministers to foreign courts will be able to acquire, if they do not know, some language beside the American, and be able to converse with those with whom they  have business,--an un-speakable luxury now. Active,  bustling infants will give a new ardor to journal- ism, and produce a more enterprising corps of wide- awake, newspaper correspondents, to keep up the stock of telegraph companies by information which, being-'. constantly in advance of the' facts, would fairly repre- ] sent and be fitting types of, the infantile correspondents  themselves, and necessitate additional contradictions. As -territorial governors, obliged to take hazardous journeys on our railways, -which often intervene and' prevent, older men from reaching their destination,- they would be nimble enough to get out of the wreck, or perhaps smart enough to keep their deaths secret, and have their ancestors draw  their salary,--thus accomplishing, although not present, the principal business of that office. Then, too, how much livelier would things go on in our churches, if, instead of the dull, 'old elders, deacons, or vestrymen, nov seldom elected before- they reach the great age of thirty, and who, when they were boys, were smart enough, although   542 Tas cOMXCe msTuO OF TE VlITED STATEs.        r/ (   TAKEN FOR GRANTED.      ..543 not as alert, as their own boys now, were allowed to rest their stiffer awkward limbs in their pews, and ecclesiastical affairs were managed by their youngers?. The sick would be visited by cheerful, round-faced persons, bright with the health which would be brought as a living fact to the invalid; widows would be com- forted by the presence of dark-haired and hopeful youths, and not depressed by the aspect of people en- cumbered with wives and the chilling experience of at least a score and a half of years; while the poor would receive liberally from those who well know, that the best use for money is to keep it in vigilant circulation. Business would also be conducted on youthful prin- ciples, in consonance with the other rapid ways of the times; capital would be nimble and alert, creating profits so lively that they would, leap back into the common and rapidly running current.' Old legislative peculators, bank and trust defaulters, would soon, in 'the natural course of' things, and without the shocks of legal trials, - which generally produce no results, - be displaced; while young iniquity would scarcely acquire the rime antd rust which .now incrust so many of the old instruments  of corruption, making them almost respectable. Biographies, now often running tediously through- so many chapters, would be brief.; as an American life might be assumed to close up substantially at twenty-five at least, and we should get the rich morning cream, without wearyibg our- selves with collecting the thin globules that- float on the pan of age. In the better times to which of course everybody looks, we take it for granted, also, that the every-day   544 'THE COMC HSTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. arts and the familiar sciences, now taught in schools and colleges, will be laid aside; and that Greek, Latin, French, German, Italian, Irish, and other: tongues,-- those sad reminders of Babels and other polyglot at- tempts and results, - will give place to more practical studies. How to cook, so as not to destroy the rem- nants of stomachs left by candy-eating, hot breads, and other delectable addictions of the old barbarous times which America has 'passed     dyspeptically through; how to get a husband or wife, in every way suited to the expectations and ideas of different members of the family, and on a scale mathematically ad- justed to the pecuniary latitude and longitude calcu- lated from the paternal meridian; how to scale a tariff for conductors, which shall not raise the market price of gold rings, studs, and heavy watches, and yet leave something for the directors to oper'ate the stock with; the best methods of acquiring a fortune without the stale process of failure and settling with creditors; the mode of conducting railway collisions and steamboat explosions, without ruining whole families and de- stroying rising communities at a blow, and without leaving so many facetious questions to funny coroners and irresistibly comic jurors , a method of advertising wares and leaving some prAiseful adjectives not used up; a system which should graduate the decrease in weights and measures to the price; and how to make an hour's work go as far as ten old-fashioned absurd hours,--these will help to furniish out a curriculum of study for institutions high and low. The fashions will be regulated by the Secretary of the Treasury, who will issue a 4dily telegraphic bulle-   TAKEN FOB GRANTED    .  ... .5 tin, so that no one shall have any advantage over    i another. rThe President of the United States, by way of keep-  ing his hand in, may practise on a Sunday school every !

A central bureau, located in Wall Street, will so work all kinds of veins and i arteries, auriferous, argentiferous, and .verdibackish, as to entice out all their values on call.        *  The traditions about gold are to be wrought up into  i poetry, and thus forever forgotten.         . We have been put in possession of the advance sheets of several reports, to be made to the vari ous  State legislatures in 1969, on "The Absene of Legis- lative Corruption," from which it is manifest, that  ! nothing with money in it ever reaches the capitals of that 'day, and that the rmembers are left .to the tedious . business of practical legislation, their spare time being amused with antiquarian researches into the capital chances for money-making between 1860 and '1870. It is also apparent from these coming reports that great amusement is to be afforded by a study of the severely virtuous styles of examinations, conducted by commit- tees of our time, into alleged briberies of fellow- members; while the hotel bills of the cautious investi- gators are to be regarded as inimitable specimens of the gastronomic abundance of their predecessors in Amnerica.               '      ' We also take for granted, that the railway system of the United States will be wonderfully simplified. ofI th    546 THE COMC HSTORY OF THE' UNITED STATES. We now make it a matter of boasting that since, the beginning of our railways, in 1829, we have extended them until, in forty- years, they have reached a length of 38,500 miles, or a circuit around the earth one and a half times; costing in their construction aind equip- ment $ 1,700,000,000, or a sum equal to two thids- of the debt of the United States; employing 8,000 en- gines and 135,000 cars, or enough, if placed side by side, to .reach from New York to Chicago, and carry- ing annually 145,000,000 of passengers, or a number more than four times the whole population, men, women, children, and John Smiths put together. We are jubilant over the completion, in four years, of the Pacific Railroad, 1,900 miles in length, forming a line from New York to San Francisco of 3,353 mites, straining across prairies, chasing off herds of buffalo, spitting Utah with a skewer, climbing the Sierras 8,000 feet high, and levelling the Rocky Mountains with iron maces. All these performances are, in the absence of any- thing better, and in our poor beginnings, not disdainful topics of conversation or newspaper comment. But in the near future we take it, that a single consolida- tion of all lines in -the hands of one man,--whose name at present we mercifully- withhold,-- replacing our wooden depots with stone structures tastefully decorated with waving flags and live eagles, our tressel- work bridges with solid granite buttresses, spanned by iron girders,- the old ones being kept under glass cases for curious exhibition,-- will so prolong, carry around, and multiply iron ways, that the entire popu- lation of the United States, excepting perhaps, news- r rrrvy vr ru HY L   i547 TAKEN FOR GRANTED. ,   " , - X e l \   / . * '**    ' .

Grumbling will, also, in those gladsome days, be, left to the unnaturalized Englishmen among us, and to those wry-faced observers of the weather adfd crops, who ,get up such very uhvely stacks of figures, and  elongate their rueful faces beneath their cold- shadows. Patriotism  will, of course, be merged in a' cosmo- politan feeling; for, as our boundaries will naturally take in nearly all the world, what is outside will be the subjects of our pity and commiseration, as those portions of the globe  unfortunately left outside of England were, a few  years ago, to Englishmen. Chicago will then have so many elevators, that she Will raise not' only her surface above Lake Michigan, )ut her manners to a point where mending can begin.  ew York will doubtless be ruled by a descendant of he Fisk-al family, who will utilize New Jersey as a ailroad depot or a  coal-yard.

We need hardly add, that we shall leave off prais- ing ourselves when we shall most deserve praise, and. cease to be sensitive to foreign censure when we shall be-hardy enough to laugh at it. As everybody is naturally expecting to be happy, so we expect that everybody will be, without being  seriously hurt or stunted by any of the little taps of this history. Pax vobiscum. Meanwhile, and until all these blessed times and expectations shall converge into the focalizing future, we trust that our readers, jolly, good, and happy, will get over, as best they can, the intermediate spaces, keeping their eye and faith steadily upon THE END.
