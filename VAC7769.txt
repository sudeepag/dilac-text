M~ DEAR HARRY:-
You have been, in your day and mine, as 'good as a
thousand comedies to me. Why should I not endeavor
to require you, after a very poor fashion of my own?
Yet will you not know, any more than the Custo~m.
House, when some repenting sinner of an importer
makes anonymous restoration of defrauded dues, whose
conscience it is from which this poor acknowledgment
is drawn. It is, you may be sure, a very sincere one,
couphd with the single misgiving that~my little "Com-
edy" will scarcely prove half so agreeable to you, a~
yours has ever been to me. Nevertheless, you excellent
wretch, be you grateful with the philosophy of Sancho,
and look not the gift-horse too narrowlyly in the mouth..

matters that affect the humorous, and hardly a proper

PROEM4
WE were nine of us, packed' snugly enough in a elo~e
stage, and on the high road from Madison, in Georgia,
to Montgomery, in Alabama. The night was d~rk, and
the rain falling. The roads were bad, "and the ddver'
aS d~unk as the least reasonable desperate could desire
under the circumstances. Everybody has an idea, more
or less vivid, of a dark and rainy night; most persons
can form a notion ~of the drunken driver of a stage..
coach-a swearing, foul-mouthed fellow, pestilent, full
of conceit and insolence, fully conscious of his power
over his nags and passengers, and with jwst ~easui
enough left to desire to use his poker so as to keep all
parties appreh~nsive--his horses of the whip, and hi~
passengers of an upset. But if you know nothing of &amp;
Georgia 'road in bad weather, at the time I speak of,
you can form but an imperfect ides of the nervous
irritability of the nine within our vehicle that night, as,
trundling through bog a~d through brier, over stump
and stone, up hill and down dale-as desperate a chase,
seemingly, as that~of the Wild' Horseman of Burger-we
mo~ently cursed our fates, that had given us ever to such
a keeping and such a progress. We could not~ee each
other's faces, but w~ could hear each otherss words,. and
feel each other's hips and elbows.

"Eh! does she? I'm glad of it," was the reply of
another, sincec~ I hope this gentleman will noW suffer
my head to get back fairly upon its shoulders."
There was a release of the victim and an apology.
Xndeed, there were several apologies necessary. We
were niornently .n~akirig free with the arms and sides
and shoulders of our neighbors, under the impulse of a
sudden di'~ad' of the upset, which it is wonderful how
we continued to escape. 'We compared notes.. Our
apprehensions were general. The ~'driver ~as appealed
to; we ~howled to him through the pipes of a Down
Easter, entreating him to drive more gently.
"Gently, ~ 'hanged !" was 'the horrid answer, fol-

went the horses at a wil4er rate than ever, and we were
left, without~ ~hope or consolation, to all sorts ofimagin-

Our. very.efforts to conceal our fears sufficiently betrayed
them to all who were cool enough ~o imake the discovery.
But seIf~esteem was reassured by the general sympathy
of most of our comrades. There were variou~ emotionS
among us-the modified exponents of the one in com-
mon-modified according to age, temper, and education.
Our various modes of showing them made us altogether.
a proper group for dramaticcontrasts. We could have
played our parts, no doubt very decently, upon any
stage but that. We could have strutted. manfully, and
shown good legs, but scarcely upon board~ which
creaked and cracked as with convulsions of thefr own,
as we hurried headlong up the heights,. or rushed whiz-
zing'~ through the mire. And 'we should have had
variety enough. fot character. Our nine passengers
might have represented as many States. Never was
there a more grateful diversity. There was a school..~
master from Massachusetts. Whither, indeed, does not
Massachusetts send her schoolmasters, teaching the
same eternal notion of. the saintly mission of the Puri~
tans, and the perfect virtues, of their descendants? The
genius of that State was certainly born a pedagogue,
with birch in one hand and horn-book' in 'the .other ~
There was a machinist from Maine, a queer, quaint,
shrewd, knowing, self4&amp;ught Yankee, who had lost' half
his fingers in experimenting with his own machines, and
who was brim-full of a new. discovery which is~to secure
us that "phuloso~her's stone" of the nineteenth century
.-perpettial motion! The principle of our machinist
seemed to lie in the amiable good-nature with which
certain balls, precipitating themselves upon: e~ertMn.

ttmibliigs Whieh should keep the great globe it~eif in~
moti~n without ether motive a~noiesi Our New~
Yorker wa~ an eilitor, bound first for New Orleans~ and
then for Mhiand, where he proposed t~ visit' the god: of
his political idolatry. We had a Pennsylvanian, who:
seemed to reel as if all the sham~' of State repudiation
hiy on hi~ own particular shoulders4 ~ud a Mississippian,
who' appeared to deplore nothing so much as that he~
could not claim more than the merit of a single vote in
the glorious business of defying the foreign creditor of
the union Bank. The encounter between these two
parties-the humbled and responding tone of the one,
contrasted with the exulting and triiu~iphant convictions
of successful right in the othei~'-furnished picture of
opposites that wa~ perfectly delightful. The leading
idea which troubled our Virginian was, that Tykr was
t6' be the last of the Presidents which' his State would
furnish to the Union; while the South Carolinian, with
whom he seemed intimate, consoled him with the assur-
'ance that his regrets were idle, as the Union would not
much longer need a President. He indulged in the
favorite idea that a dissolution was. at hand. "The
Union," said he, answeredd the-purposes of the time.
It has survived its uses." Our Georgian,' on the con.-
tiary, was for the extension of 'the confederacy by the
in~corpo'ration ~of as many new States south of us as we
coul&amp;pet~u~de into the f~Id. lie was even then upon
his way to Texas, provided with his rifle only, in. order
to 'be in the way to help in the' matter of annexation.
Then we had a North Carolinian, a lank-sided fellow~
from Tar Rivrn'~ Who slept nearly all the way, spite of
toss. and. tumble, talked only (and constantly) in his

~sleep, and then ~hie~y upon the Wotible of looking aft~r
his own affairs. Ou~r n.intk man ~was a broth of a hey

"I crowd 'you, 'stranger; I'm afeard I crowd' you;"
and he laid his huge paw upon my shoulder with the
:air of onex who ~olioits all possible indulgence. If ~[
had 'been utterly squeezed out of prQper shape, I could
scarcely have forborne the assurance, which .Iiustantjy
made him, that he didn't crowd me in The least.

way, and the thing wa~ to be done over agin. But as
that's not to be hoped for, I d6i~'t complain at all, eC
you don't."
How could, I complain &amp;fter the, last suggestions-
cbmpl'ain of a man who felt his own misfortune with
such a proper conscience! The schoolmaster had some-
thing to say. His tone ~was exceedingly indignant, but
too much subdued for the ears of the Tennesseean.
My amiable recognition of his bulk seemed to have won
hi~ affe~tioas, if, indeed, his great size and my unavoid-
able neighborhood did not suff ciently account' for them.
His great fat haunches nestled most lovingly against
me, threatening 'to overlap me entirely, while his huge
arm encircled~ my neck with an embrace which would
hava honored that of the Irish Giant. It was 'fortunate
that we had no such sulky scoundrels within the stage
'a~s he who lorded it frorri? the box. ~If we swore at 1dm,
we kept terms with one another. If the storm roared
without,' we were pacific' 'enough within; and it was
wonderful, with. such a variety, and with so much to

"Pshaw'!" exclaimed the Georgian. "Go ahead,
man. I'm a mighty conceited fellow, I know, but that's
rw reason yoiv should hold me up to make me say so."
"Gi's your hand, my lad; you're a good weapon, I
see; though, n~ay-1o, a little too quick on trigger."
~Agripe. of'~ the extended fists followed in the dark,
and the Tennesseean proceeded.
"The sarcumstance that I am going to tell you tuck
place in one of the western counties of Georgia, not
many years ago, and there's many a person living who
can jest now lay their fingers on the very parties. I've
seen some of them myself0 You must take the thing
for its truth more than for its pleasantry; for, about
the one I can answer, and about the other I'm as good
as nobody to have an opinion. I'm not the man to
make folks laugh, unless it's at me, and then ItI'm jest
as apt to make them cry~, too; so you see I'm as good
as comedy and tragedy both, to some. But, as I con~
fess, a joke don't gain much in goodness when it leaves
my mouth; and ef so be-"
We silenced these preliminaries viva voce; and, thus
arrested, our Tennesseean left off his faces and began.
In a plain and direct manner, 'he related the occurrences
~hioh will be fot~nd in the following chapters. He was
n4 hutnorist, though he ~uffered' us all to see in what
the humorous susceptibilities of his story lay. It was
the Qddity of~ the circumstances, rather than their hu-
morr that held out the 'attraction ~for me; and Ii cc~uld
readily perceive how, without confounding comedy with
the merely humorous and ludicrous, the materials' thus

thrown together might, by a dext6rous hand, be con-
verted to the purposes of the stage. The story illus~
rates curiously the variety and freedom of character
which we find' everywhere in our forest country, where
no long-established usages subdue the fresh and eager
impulses of originality, and where, as if in very mockery
of the conventionalities of city life, the stranAest eccen-
tricities of mood and feeling dispfry themselves in a
connection with the most unimpeachable virtue-eccen~
tricities of conduct such as 'would shock the demurer
damsel of the city; to whom the proprieties themselves
are virtues-yet without impairing those' substantial
virtues of the country girl, whose principles are wholly'
independent of externals. Let the reader only keep in
mind the perfect freedom of will, and the absence of
prescriptive or ~fashionable discipline in our border
countries, and there will be nothing strange or extrava-
gant in what is here related of the heroine.
In putting these details together, I have adopted a
fashion of my own, though without hoping, any more
than our Tennesseean, to bring out the humorous points
of the na~rati've.: These must be left to the fancy of
the reader. "As good as a comedy" need~ not imply
a story absolutely comic; 'and I do not promise one~

AS GOOD AS A COMEDY:
THE TEN~ES~EEAN'~ STOIY.
CHAPTER 1.
A GEORGIA BREAKFAST.
L1~T us start fairly, and not -on ~n empty stomach.
Reader, we begin with a Georgia breakfast.'. We ~ar~
at one of ~those pIain~~ unpretending, but ~ub~tantial,
farm-houses, which, in the interior of ~O'eQrgia~,and
other Southern 'States,' distingt4shed more e~precia1l$
the older inhabitants; thos6 who, from time 'iii~memo-
rial, bve appeared pretty mueli as we find "tlieihn~w.
These all date back' beyond the Revolution ;~ the usual.
epoch, in 'our country, at which an ancient ft~mily may
be permitted to 'begin. 'The region is one of 'those
lovely spots' among' the barrens 'of ~middle 'Georgia, in
which, surVeyed from the proper point bf view, there is
nothing barren. You a~e not to suppose thesettlement '~
an old 'one~ by any means, for it is not more than twenty
or twenty-five ~r~ars since' 'all the contiguous territory
within a space of' sixty miIe~' was' rested' from the
savages. ]3ut our fcemi1~i is an' Qid' one;' .iiihoriting~ll"
the pride, the tastes, and~ the 'feelings which 'b~ei9~ged
to the old Southern "' Continentaler." This will' be
apparent as we proceed; 'a&amp; it is apparent, -in f~oi~, tOF
the eye which contrasts the 'exterior ofits dwelling"widi

that of the neighboring settlements among which it
harbors. 'The spot, though undistinguished by sur-
prising scenery,' is a very lovely one, and not unfre-
quent in the middle country of the Atlantic Southern
states. It presents a pleasing prospect under a single
glance of the eye, of smooth lawn, and gentle acclivity,
and lofty forest growth. A streamlett, or Iiranch,~as it
is here called, winds .along~ murmuring as it goes, at the
foot of~ ~ gentle eminence which is crowned with a luxu-
riant wealth of pine and cedar. Looking up from this
'spot while your steed, drinks, you behold, perched on
'another gentle swell of ground, as snug~and handsome
an edifice as our forest country usually affords; none
of your overgrown ambitious establishments, but a trim
tidy dwelling, consisting of a single story of wood upon
a brick basement, and surrounded on three sides by a
most glorious piazza. The lawn slopes away, for several
hundred yards, an. even and very gradual descent even
to 'the road; a broad tract, well sprinkled with noble
trees, oaks, oranges, and cedars; with here and there a
clump of towering pines, under which' steeds are grazing,
in. whoSe slender and symmetrical forms, clean legs, and
glossy skins, you may discern instant signs of those
superior foreign breeds which the Southern, planter so
much' affects. The house; neatly painted white, with
green blinds and shutters, is kept in admirable trini; and,
from the. agreeable arrangement' of trees and' shrubbery,
it would.seem that the place had been laid out and was
tenan.ted by those who brought good taste and, a be-
coming sense of the beautiful to the task. There was
nogreat exercise of.. art, itv is true. That is nQt pre-
tended. 'But nature was not suffered to have her own
way. entirely, was not suffered to overrun the face of'
the land with her luxuriance;, nor was man so savage
as to strip her utterly of all h~r graooful deoorations-
a crime which we are too frequently called upon~ to de-
plore and to denounce, when we contemplate the habita-
tions even of the wealthy among our people, particularly
in the south, despoiled, by barbarity, of all their shade-

trees, and denuded of all the grace and softness whieli
these necessarily confer upon the landscape. Here, the
glance seemed, to rest satisfied with' what it beheld,. and.
to want for nothing9 There might be bigger h6iises,
and loftier, structures, of more ~mbitiou~ design and
more commanding proportion~; but' this was certainly
very neat, and.very much in its place. Its ~white '&amp;ut~
lines caught your eye, glinting through openings of' the'
forest, approaching by the road on either hand; for
some distance' before you drew nigh, and with' ~ucii ui:
air' of peace and sweetness,' that you were' insensib'1y~
prepared to 'regard its inmates as very good and welh
bred people. :Nor are we wrong in these conjectures.,
But of this hereafter. At this moment, you ina1y see
avery splendid iron-gray charger, saddled, an&amp; fastened~
in the shade, some twenty steps from the dwelling.' 'Lift"
your eye to the piazza, and you behold the owner. 'A"
finer-looking fellow lives not in the country. Tall,' ~elV'
made, and muscular, he treads the piazza like a prince.
The freedom of carriage which belongs to the gentlein~n
in our forest country is inimitable, is not to be acquired
by art, and 'is due to' the fact that 'they suffer from no
laborious occupation, undergo no drudgei~y, 'and ~are~
subject to no confinement, which, in childhood, conti~aet'
the shoulders into a stoop, depress the spirits, 'enf~eble
the energies, and wofully impair the 'freedom and 'ele-
gance of' the deportment. 'Constant exercise on foot
and horseback, the fox hunt and the chase; these~ with
other sylvan sports, do wonders for the pk~isique, the
grace and the bearing of the country gentleman of the
South. The ~ers6n before us is one of'the noblest spe-'
cimens of his class. A frank and' handsome countenance,
with a skin clear and inclining to the 'fl~rid'~ a' brig'lit,
martial blue eye; a full' chin; thick, massive locks~ ~of
dark brown hair, and lips 'that express a rare ~etness,'
and only do not smile, sufficiently distinguish his~ peeu.
liarities of face. His dress is, simple, after an ordinary
fashion of the country, but is surprisingly neat and be-
coming. A loose blouse, rather more after the Choctaw

than the Parisian pattern, does not lessen the symmetry
of his shape. His trousers are not so~ loose as to con~
ceal the fine muscular developments of his lower limbs;
nor: does his loose negligee neckcloth, simply folded
about the neck, prevent the display of a column which
admirably sustains the intellectual and massive head
which crowns it, and which we now behold uncovered.
Booted and 'spurred, he appears ready-for a journey,
walks the piazza with something of' impatience in his
manner, and frequently stops to shade his eyes from the
glare, as he strains them in exploring the distant high-
way.. You see that 'he is~ young, scarcely twenty-two;
eager in his impulses, restive under restraint, and better
able to endure and struggle with the conflict than to
wait for:it~ slow approaches'. Suddenly he starts. He
turns to a call from within, and a matron lady appears
at ~the entrance of the dwelling, and joins him in the,
piazza. He tiu'ns to her with respect and fondness. She
is~ his mother; a statelyy dame, with features like his
own; -a manner at once easy and dignified'; an eye
grave, 'but benevolent; and a voice whose slow, 'subdued
accents' possess a rare sweetness not unmingled with
command.
* "'We need wait for Miles no longer, my son," was
the remark of the old lady. "lie surely never meant
to come to breakfast. He knows our hours perfectly;
and knows, moreover, that 'we old people, who rise with
the fowls, do 'not relish any unnecessary delay in the
morning meal.".
" Well, mother, have it in, though I certainly under~
stood John that he would be here to breakfast."
"Most probably he did not understand himself."
'" He is,' indeed, a stupid fellow. But, there he is.
Ho! -John"--calling to the servant whom he sees cross~

single colored girl stands in 'waithig,' dressed- in' hlu~
homespun, with a Aean white apron. The aged lady
herself wears an apron, that seems to indicate her own
readiness to share in the labors of the household. ' And
now for the breakfast. .A Georgia, indeed a Southern
breakfast, differs in sundry respects from ours at the
North, chiefly, however, in the' matter 'of breadstuffs.
In this respect our habits are more simple, particularly
in the cities. 'In the South, there is a variety; and
these are valuable chiefly in proportion to their warmth.
.llominy itself is a breadstuff; a 'dish that our mush~ but
poorly represents. -It is seldom eatable out ofa Southern
household. Then there are' wafiles, and rice cakes -and
fritters, and other things of like description, making
a variety at o~nce persuasive to 'the palate and n&amp;t :'hurt~
ful to health. These were 'all in 'lavish array at the
table of the widow Hammond, for such is the name of
the excellent lady to whose 'breakfast board ~we are
self..invited. The breadstuffs had their corresponding
variety of meats. A dish of broiled partridges; a steak
of venison, and a vase of boiled eggs, furnish an a~ple
choice for a Spring breakfast, and take from us all
motive to look farther. Coffee for her son, 'and tea for
herself, constituted the beverage of the breakfast; and

i~ suggestive of a pitcher of foaming buttermilk that
stands at the extremity. Why look further into the
catalogue?
For a while the parties ate in silence, or rather they
did n6t eat; one of them, at least, seemed to need an
appetizer. Ilandall Hammond took several things on
his plate at the suggestion of his mother, but he merely
tasted of them. The, partridge was sorely gashed at
th~first stroke, but the morsel taken from its breast lay
upon the fork unswallowed. The youth seemed more
disposed to exercise his ingenuity in balancing his spoon
upon the. edge of his cup; a feat which, having suc-
ceeded in, he abandoned for the more difficult experi-
ment of standing the egg upon its point, as if to solve
the problem whioh Columbus submitted to the Spanish
doctors. The mother watched with some anxiety these
movements of her son.
"You do not eat, Randall."
"No," he said, "I have somehow no appetite;" and
he pushed away his plate as he replied9
"You have eaten nothing,; shall I send you another
cup of~coffee?",
"Do so5 mother ;~ I am thirsty, though I cannot eat."
The cup was replenished. The, mistress dispatches
the servant~girl or~ a mission tJ the kitchen, and then,
after a preliminary hem or two, she - addressed her son
in accents of considerable gravity, though so, coupled
with fondness as to declare the tendexb interest which
she had,, in~her subject9
"My son, you well know the regret which I feel at
your going to this hQrserace."
~' But IC must go, mother. ~'
"Yes, I i4rlderstand that. You must go, as you l'~ave
promised to do so, and I suppose it's quite unreasonable
on my part to desire that you should not comply with
what is customary among your assocki4es. I can be-
lieve, also, that horseracing is a very different thing,

Georgia."

"0 yes, indeed; a very different thing !"
"I hope so; I believe so! If I 'did not, 'Randall,
nothing should persuade me to give my consent to your
exposing yourself to its dreadful influences."~
"You need fear nothing on ray account,'mQther."
"Ah! my son ;-that is being' quite too bold; persons~.
who are thus' strong in their own belief are' always in
danger. But, I trust, you have heard me too frequently
on this subject; I trust you feel how deeply I should
suffer, did I, suppose that'you could run a horse, or risk
a dollar, in such a practice; to be misled by the per-
suasions of others, or your own natural tendenciess"
"But, why do you think I have any such tendencies,
mother ?"
"Why have you spent so large an amount on. these
foreign horses ?"
"For the sake of stock, mother. I have an eye to
the merits and the beauties of the horse. I know his fine
points. I love to look upon them. I know no spectacle
more beautiful than a group of these beautiful creatures,
wheeling and dashing over the lawn; and as a captain of
cavalry, I must be well mounted myself.' Beyond this
desire, I do not see that I ~have any natural tendencies
that should occasion your fears."
"These tendencies come from this very passion for
horseflesh."
"But with me~ mother, it is no passion."
"Alas! my son, I know better; all passions begin very
modestly. That you have the tendency is enough for,
me, and, at the risk of giving you 'pain, I must repeatt
what I have said before, that you inherit~ this 'passion
from your most unhappy father."
"'No more of that, mother, I entreat you."
"Nay, iRandall, but there must he more~ of ft.~ It
is needful'for your' safety that I should remind you that

and.dangerous. passion. What remains to us of former
wealth was ,happily secured by my fathers providence.
We had else been destitute. You resemble your father

greatly in most respects. You have his sanguine tern-
perament; hi~ hopeful confidence in himself; his eager
will; his lavish expenditure, and his passion for horses."
"But, dear mother-2'
"Restrained only, as I trust, my son, by the constant
lessons of. your. mother."
"And by the love I bear her."
"I believe it, Randall; it is God's blessing that I do
believe it; otherwise, this would b~ to me a moment of
the dreariest hopelessness of, heart. Promise me, dear
son, that y6u will neither run a horse; nor bet upon a
horserace."
"Promise, mother !"
"'Nay, I ask no promise; I will only pray, Randall,
that you will never for a moment forget how much the
small remiiant' of your mother's life depends upon the
heed you give to these lessons of her fears and sorrows.
Let me not mourn the fate of an only son, as I must
always mourn that of a husband."
The youth passed his arms about her, and kissed her
tenderly. They had both risen from the table, and they
now approached the piazza together.
"There is another subject, Randall, about which I
wished to speak with you, but my heart is quite too full
just now. I must keep it for another time. It relates
to this young lady, Miss Foster."
The youth colored deeply. The flush~ did not escape
the penetrating eyes of' the mother. She did not seem
to obserVe it, however, but continued with rare quietness
of manner to remark:
"They tell me that you are pleased with her."
"Who tells you ?"
"No matter. Enough, that I hear also that she is a
maiden of singular levities, of bold, masculine~ habits."
"0 mother! who could have told you this? What a
scandalous story!"
"What! has she not some singular habits ?"
"Some slight eccentricities, perhaps; something in.

The youth was not unwilling to waive the subject.'
His eyes were eagerly fixed upon the highway,' where a
horseman now came in sight.
"Ay, there he is at last, riding like the high~sh6riff,
as who but he! Should he want breakfast, now, mo-
ther ?"
"He can have it in a moment; but, unless I. am
greatly mistaken, he has considered his wants of that
sort some time ago."
A few moments sufficed to determine the doubt.
The new-com~r cantered rapidly down the road, and
was soon within the inclosure.
"Well, Randall, are you ready ?" he cried, as he
alighted from his horse. The bridle was thrown to 3
servant, and Henderson ascended to the piazza, where
he shook hands with mother and son.
"Ready," said Hammond, "and have been this hour.
What has kept you? Why did you' not come to break~
fast?"
"For' the best of reasons. I overslept myself."
"'Then you have breakfasted, Henderson ?" asked the
old lady.
"0 yes, ma'am. I wouldn't keep you waiting;
though I sent word by John that 'I would take coffee
with you."
"And a pretty tale he made of it. We waited for
you."
"I'm sorry-" he began to apologize, but the old
lady silenced him gracefully, and then took her de~
parture, leaving the young men together.
"So, you overslept yourself, Miles ?" was the remark
of Hammond. "Something singular for you. Where
was you last night ?"
The inquirer darted a swift but half~smiling glance: of

suspicion directly to the eye of the other. The answer
was somewhat hesitatingly delivered.
"Where was I'? Oh! at Mrs. Foster's."
"Ah 1" was the significant exclamation of Hammond,
and a pause ensued between the parties. The tone with
whi~h the exclamation was uttered was subdued, the
word seemed to escape the lips of the speaker involun-
tarily, and a keen eye might have detected a slight
contraction of the muscles of his brow.~' But this passed
away in a single moment, and putting his arm within
that of his guest, with a glance behind him to the
breakfast-room, Randall Hammond led his companion
down, the steps, and they walked away in silence to some
distance in the park.

CHAPTER IT.
THE FRIENDS.
THE new-corner, whom we are already taught to know
as Miles Henderson, was tall of size' and graceful of per-
son. In these respects, he resembled hi~ companion;
though it needed no second glance of the spectator to
discover the superiority, in all thtit regards bearing and
general manner, in the person and carriage of the latter.
Henderson was a fine, sprightly, and rather sensible
fellow, but scarcely so courtly, so well-bred, and welL.
looking as Randall Hammond. Still, there were those
by whom the former was preferred. 'He was more frank
and less commanding, as a character; more' accessible,
and accordingly more agreeable to the many, than the
man of superior will and. general endowments. It does
not need, however, that we should strike~ the balance,
just at this time, between them. Such proceeding will
serve liereafter. Enough for us, that the two are most
excellent friends; true, whole-souled, and confiding;
with neither doubt nor distrust of any' kind between
them; ready to share their resources,' ~ind to peril life,
if need be, in behalf of each other.~ And such had
been their tenns of relationship from boyhood. They
had few other associates to divide their sympathies or
provoke jealousies between them. 'Both of them were
the on
were' e~ us widowed mothers; and both of them
~i respect to the wishes of their
parents. They were not absolutely faultless, but 'very
good fellows, as the ~world goes; the one being supposed
to have a very decided will of his own; the' other of
having a tendency to good-fellowship of every kind,
without losing his equilibrium, in the license which good-


86          ~s ~oori AS A COMEDY: OR,

fellowship among young men is supposed to engender.
We may state, at the beginning, that, on the occasion
of their present meeting,~ there was something more of
shyness and reserve in their mutual hearing, cordial and
frank as 'it really appeared, than had ever distinguished
it before. The secret of this, of which each was duly
conscious, will be shown as we proceed. They had got
to some distance from the dwelling, when, somewhat
abruptly, Randall resumed the conversation with an
inquiry.
"So you dined at Mrs. Foster's yesterday, Miles ?"
"No. I got there in the afternoon. I went down
to the village to see Ferguson~about that land business,
and took the good lady in my way home."
"'By going four miles out of the way," said the other,
drily.
"You're right, ~andall," answered the other frankly,
while a slight flush tinged the cheek of the speaker.
"You're 'right; but I reckon it's only what you'd have
done yourself."
To this nothing was answered. A moment's pause
ensued, when Hammond resumed.
"Was that foolish fellow, Barry, there ?"
"No! not then; but I gathered that he had been,
during the morning, from something that passed between
Geraldine and her mother-"
"Ah! What?"
"Why, as far as I could guess, Geraldine had been
rather sharp upon him, in some of her answers; and
her mother was' quite displeased in consequence. She
gave Geraldine a lecture as long as one of Brother
Peterkin's, particularly when his dinner has been a good
and comforting one; a~id Geraldine-
"Mindc~d it quite as little as my roan horse does the
snafile. But how often, Miles, you name her in the
space of a sentence!"'
"Name her! How often! Who ?" ~The response
was stammeringly made.
"Who, but Geraldine Foster? In a single half sen-

THE TENNESSEBAN'S STORY.          87
tence, I think, you contrived to bring in her name at
least half a dozen times."
"Nay, Randall, you're joking. But once,~ 'pon my
honor !"
"Pawn nothing, or you lose. The offence is not
hanging, unless agreeably. The name' is one to be
repeated. It is a sweet and musical one."
This was said good-humoredly, a slight smile lighten-
ing pleasantly the otherwise grave face of the speaker.
His companion discovered a something significant in the
look and speech, was himself slightly confused, and con-
cealed it in silence. Hammond quietly turned full upon
him, and, laying his hand with affectionate emphasis
upon his shoulder, thus addressed him
"Look you, Miles, old fellow, there is one small ki~ot
between us which remains to be untied."
"Knot between us, Randall ?"
"Yes; and the sooner we take it between our fingers,
the more certain are we to escape the necessity of put-
ting our teeth to it. We are here by ourselves, and a
few moments more-"'
"But, have we time, Randall ?"
"Time! Yes; we neither of us care much for the
race; we shall lose bu~ little."
"But little, in truth. The horses I hear of are only
common ones. There is 'Vose's gray, pretty good a~t
a quarter; and Biggar's young filly out of 'May
Queen;' and the old horse '1~ob,' of Joe Balob, which
you know was never of much. account; and Barry, I
understand, means to run his 'Fair Geraldine,' of which
he brags so much; and-"
"Enough of your catalogue," said the othei, with a
smile: "I perhaps know quite as much as yourself with
regard to the horses likely to be upon the ground; for
Tom Nettles was with me yesterday, and he has all the
news. The race, he agrees, will be no great shakes, so
that, if we lose some of it, we lose nothing-~"
"Yes, but Randall, Geraldine will be there early, and
without any male attendance. In fact, I promised her
'4


AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,
to be on the ground at the beginning, in order to let
her know all about the horses. She is full of it, and
is prepared to bet a world of gloves, and purses, and
handkerchiefs. She expects you there early also. She
told me, indeed, that you had promised' her-"
"Ah! she remembered it, did she?-well 1" after a
moment's pause; "we 'shall still be there in season,;
what I have to say won't take many minutes. The chief
difficulty was to get up the resolution to say it at all,
Miles."
"The resolution, Randall? Why,' what can it be ?"
"Can't you guess ?" replied the other, fixing his
eyes 'keenly upon those of hi~ companion. The orbs of
the latter sunk beneath the scrutiny.
2' I see that yoi~ know. Let us sit here, Miles."
They were now beneath a magnificent' cluster of oaks,
covering five or more acres of ground, and looking forth,
from a noble eminence, on lawn 'and field, and plain,
"and high road, that stretched away below. Sylvan
seats, manufactured rudely, but not without a native
ingenuity, ont of wands of hickory and elm, into Gothi4~
and fantastic forms, were conveniently distributed for
the lounge, while great streamers of di'ooping gray
moss festooned the outstretching arms of the several
trees with a drapery not less appropriate than natural.
Hammond pointed his companion to one of these seats,
while he took another close beside him. An incon-
venient pause followed ~f a few moments, which was
finally broken by the strong will of the former, which
was of that fearless and' frank character that could
soon shake itself free of all feelings of social awkward-
ness when resolved on the performance of a duty. His
hand again rested kindly on the shoulders of Hender-
son, as, looking him affectionately .in the face, he thus
proceeded to unfold the matter which troubled him.
"Miles, old fellow, it won't do, after so many years
of close and brotherly communion; years when 'we were
all in all to each other, and seemed to live for nobody

beside; I say, it won't do for us now to suffer any mis-
trust or misui~derstanding.to grow up between us."
"Surely not, Randall !-I wouldn't for the world !~-
But wha1~ mistrust--'what misunderstanding ?"
"Hear me, Miles; mistrusts and misunderstandings
grow very naturally and very silently between friends
from the slightest beginnings. There's no seeing them
at first, unless, the heai~t is watchful of itself, and even
then. they are apt to be let alone to grow apace, as all
ill weeds do, unless the heart is properly jealous of itsdf.
Now, it may be that my heart is equally mistaken in
its suspicions of itself and of yours-"
" Of miiie, Randall ?"
"Yes! I have reason to believe that there has been
a slight falling off between us ever since Geraldine
Foster returned to the neighborhood."
"Randall!" said the other, reproachfully.
"It is even so, Miles; but it must not be so an~
longer. ,For this reason, I have determined to speak out
plainly before the weed grows too strong for the plough-
share. We were friends from boyhood until now, and
your friendship has been, and I trust will continue
to be, quite as precious to me as~ any love of woman.
We must continue to be friends, Miles, even, though we
should both of us love Geraldine Foster."
The other clasped hi~ hands together, as if with
a stidden anguish.
"Ah, Randall !-J did fear it; 'I did !"
"It is unfortunate, Miles, that such is the case, but
it is no longer to' be feared, and it need not be fatal to
our friendship. I can love Geraldine with all the passion
of a Georgian's heart; but, Miles, I can love you too,
and I will love you to the last. To be sure of this, we
have only to understand each other. There must be no
doubts, no 'mistrusts,. no suspicions between us. You
love her; you will seek her; you will try to win her
love if you can; and for this I shall afford you every
proper opportunity, not hesitating to avail myself of
the chances that seem to encourage me. Thus far, we

have both sought her without interference of each other.
We will continue to do so. It is the instinct of a
true friendship which has compelled this forbearance.
I frankly admit to you that, as yet, she has given me
no proofs that she cares one straw for me more than
for another. If you can say that you have been more
fortunate, speak it out, Miles, like a man, and I pursue
her no longer; I leave the field entirely to yourself."
"You are a noble fellow, Randall, and deserve, the
girl; which I don't. I could no more have mustered
the heart to talk of it to you, as you have just done to
me, than I could have found wings to fly; yet I felt that
that was the only way. I do love her, as you say;
but I must own that, like yourself, I have had* no
encouragement. But no more does she seem to show
favor to others. She has several suitors, you know ?"
"Yes! but none, I think, that either of us has need
to fear. You, at least, are the only person whose
chances disquiet me. She has the sense to perceive
your worth-to respect you-"
"I don't know that," was the somewhat sullen an-
swer, with a discontented shake of the head ;~ "she
treats me mighty scurvily, at times. You know her
way!"
"Yes; but I know it is her way, which shows itself
to all others as it shows itself to you, though each
person naturally thinks himself the worst treated of
all. She is a tyrant,' knows her power, and is but
too fond of abusing it; but she is a noble creature, neyer-
theless, with all her faults."
"A beautiful creature, Randall !"
"I don't speak so much of her beauty, Miles, though,
as you say, she is very beautiful; but she is a genuine
creature. $he is wrong frequently, ana says and does
wilful and mischievous things; but I do not think she
has any cunning, which I look upon as fatal to ~ll the
beauty that woman could possess. She' speaks, and
thinks, and feels, very much as if a feeling and honest
heart was in her bosom, which had not yet been tortured

out of shape and nature by the tricks of society and
the teachings of other -women. It is this for which I
love her chiefly, and which reconc4es me to so much of
her eccentricilies and wilfulness. I suppose she treats
you only as she treats me and all others. The truth is~
she not only feels her power, and is rash because of
her own impetuous spirit, but she has learned to distrust
the professions and attentions of gentlemen. She has
met with flatteries ,and flatterers at Savannah and
Charleston, and has learned .perhap~ to despise them,
not because she did not like attention and homage, but
that she required them to be interesting as well as
supplant. It is the insipidity of beaux, rather than
their devotion, that her bold min~I, which resents the
commonplace, has learned to distrust and to contemn.
Fortunately, you and I are no' beaux, Miles; but she
has yet to discover what we are. That she will find
out, if time be allowed her, I make no question. I
confide in her sincerity of mind; in what seems the
very wilfulness of her heart; in its warmth, its impulse,
and the shrewd good sense, which is quite as apparent
to me in her conduct as her eccentricities."
"Ah! Randall, you need to fear nothing," 'was the
somewhat responding answer of the other; "I'm think-
ing she already
else."      y sees you with kinder eyes than anybody
"Scarcely, Miles; for I am not taking the course
to win her affections suddenly. I confess to some policy
in this respect. She would rate me with the rest, if I
sought her like the rest. I must approach her as &amp; man,
and not as a schoolboy."
"You were always a man, Randall, even when a
schoolboy."
"I'm not sure, Miles, that you pay me any compli-
ment in this opinion. My consolation is that it is not
just. Your mannish schoolboys are usually destroyed
by their precocity. Still, if I can persuade Geraldine
that I am a man now-
"You will-you will !" said the other, with a sigh.

"Nay, nay, Miles; I must have none of this de-
spondency. You must pursue your chase with as much
hope and ardor as decision. As I have said already,
I am not taking the usual course for success, and there
is one evil influence particularly at work against me."
"What is that?"
"iler stepmother's dislike to me, which flows natu-
rally from the slights which she complains of at the
hands of my mother. My mother, who comes from an
old stock, and a very proud one, dislikes the obtrusive
and bad manners of Mrs. Foster. It is not that she is
of humble origin, but that she is pert and presuming,
and has made several efforts, without success, to find
her way to my mother's intimacy. Besides, Mrs. Foster
evidently inclines to this little fellow, Barry, who treats
her with a degree of deference which amounts to syco-
phancy, and who, besides, has the prospect of much
greater wealth than either of us could possibly hope to
acquire. The stepmother must have succeeded before
this, had it not been for the native good sense and the
strong will of Geraldine. Yet she may at last-"
"Who, Geraldine? Never! She despises Barry."
"Very likely; indeed, I know she must; but that
don't materially impair his chances, should circumstances
fibvor him. Many a passionate woman, taken in the
lucky moment, has married the object of her loathing.
This is woman's weakness. But we needn't linger in,
this discussion. I have made a clean breast of it. You
have done the same. What next? Why, that we should
pursue our objects, Miles, as we have always pursued
them, with candor, with mutual sincerity and love.
Fair play between us will always keep us friends, let
who will get the lady."
The cordial gripe of their hands which followed was
as an oath between them. Much more was said, which
it does not concern us to repeat. A few n~oments
found them mounted, both on blooded steeds of the
best breeds in the country, and on their way to the

country race-course, not yet famous in the sporting
calendar, which was honored with the name of Hillabee,
after an ancient tribe of Indians, all of whom are
extinct.

CHAPTER III.
IIILIJABEE RACE-COURSE.
TN the more thinly settled regions of the South and
West, a thousand sports are resorted to, to compensate
the want of society, and to supply equivalent pleasures
for those of a great city. On public days, the villages,
or hamlets rather, are always crowded with people.
The County Court brings together hundreds who rejoice
that they have no business within its precincts; while
on days of sheriff and public sales, other hundreds
appear within sight of the auctioneer's hammer, who
have neither meanS nor wish to buy. Muster-day calls
forth its hosts in addition to those who come for training;
and Charity, availing herself of the popular need, opens
her frequent fairs for philanthropic purposes, relying
on the universal desire for society to persuade into use-
less expenditure those whom it would not be easy to
tempt to a benevolence for its own sake. Saturday, in
these regions, is almost as much a holiday with the
full-grown farmer as it is with the schoolboy, ~nd usually
takes him to the nearest place of gathering, which is
usually a grocery, under the pretence of laying in the
supplies for the week; but really with the no less human
motive of procuring ~those, social excitements which do
flGt always result in the elevation of his humanity.
Here, he rewards the patient labor of five days at the
plough with potations which exhaust much more cer-
tainly than any labor. He calls for his quart of
whiskey, which he shares with comrades, who find
similar supplies, and, towards evening, he may be seen
trending homewards, balancing himself with no little
difficulty upon his steed, with a jug well filled, hanging

in one end of a sack across his saddle, the other end
being stored with such supplies as will soothe the appre-
hended anger of his spouse. It is not infrequently
the case that, overtasking his capacity, he imbibes too
many potations for his equestrianship, and man, jug,
and saddle find their way into ditch or thicket, while
the unincuinbered horse gradually crops his way home.
This, fortunately, is but an occasional history now.
There wasa time when it was much more frequent, and
associated with other practices-.the brutal scuffle, the
vindictive fight, the blasphemous language, which left
our hopeful humanity but little of which it could really
boast. Happily, this period is one of which the memory
grows daily more and more imperfect. The sports of
the people of the South and West, even along the border
settlements, are of a more grateful character. The
horserace is that which more nearly resembles those of
the past, since it necessarily brings into most decided
activity the animal tendencies of the people. It is here
that the great masses prove their affinity with the an-
cient Saxon family of Bull!' The picnic and the fishing-
party will suffice for girls and boys in the season of
romance, which is one simply of mutual confidence and
hope; but the turf for all parties, at all seasons. It is*
here that all meet as upon a common ground, and amidst
a thousand inequalities of wealth and life, sho~w and
condition; no one thinks so much or so meanly of him-
self as to be absent. Few think of themselves at all,
at such a period. The horserace commends itself to the
great body of the forest population more than any other
amusement. It i~ an image, in some degree, of war. It
appeals particularly to a people scarcely one of whom
fails to keep, and not one of whom is une~iual to the
most excellent management, of a horse. Commend us,
accordingly, to the Southern turf. Here, the sport is
not an affectation. It is enjoyed with a zest. Here
life and nature speak out in all their varieties of cha-
racter. The dullest peasant looks animation as the sleek
courses wind beneath his sight. His eye becomes bright

and knowing. He looks at head, heels, and neck, with
the eye of a connoisseur. He feels the breast and
shoulders knowingly. He adopts his favorite, and then
shouts his preference in defiance to all corners. He is
ready with or for a banter. He is prepared to stake
his earnings of a year upon his judgment. His greasy
pocketbook lies ready in his grasp. His bales of cotton
are'. folded up in tens, and twenties, and' hundreds, wait-
ing deliverance or companions in bondage. He is no
longer a person of drooping and grave aspect, drowsily
going forward as if 'without hope or purpose. He is
no~w allj life, eager for opposition, and confident of suc-
cess. Nor is it the' inferior taste and understanding
only to which the announcement holds forth temptation.
Edttcation here is not construed to assume the total sub-
jection of -the animal nature, and the elevation of the
moral at the expense and sacrifice of the passions.
The excitement which arises from the contemplation of
the bold, the fleet, the strong and energetic, is supposed
to be clearly consistent, within certain limits, with the
laws of refinement and civilization; and the young dam-
sel, who will prattle sentiment with you by the hour,
quoting freely and understandingly from the pages of
Moore and Wordsworth, yet bounds at the tap of the
drum which warns the courser to depart, and glows at
the progress of the contending floods; her soul as much
excited' at what she sees as the young dragoon for the
first time jingling his spurs in the heady tempest of
the fight.
But a glimpse at the race-course of Hillabee itself
will afford us a much better idea of the scene, as it
ordinarily appears, than we' could possibly convey by
any process of generalization. The ground is chosen
in ~ pine barren, which, being entirely level, and free
from ridge or inequality for a space of several miles,
z'enders it siiitably firm and hard for the required pur-
pose. The trees are cleared aWay, leaving a spacious
amphitheatre something more than a mile in circumfer-
ence. 'Within this space 'the course is laid out in a

circle, and designated by ditches running parallel, with
a track of eighty feet between them. The 'original
forests surround the whole; a 'deep green girdle of mas-
sive pines, at whose feet have sprung up, ~t~king the
place of those which have been ~radie~ted from the
outer edges of the course, a narrow belt, of scrubby oaks.
Among these, you see numerous carts ~and wagons.
These contain supplies of food and liquor. Here are
ginger-cakes and cider, of domestic mangfa~ture. Here
are cold baked meats in abundance, ham and "chicken
fixings," mutton and pork, spread upon long tables of
rough plank, and waiting for customers. On one~hand,
you see rising 't~he smokes of a 6ar6acue; a steer is
about to be roasted entire above a huge pit, over which,
by meaiis of a stake, he hangs suspended. Steed8 arp
fastened in every thicket, and groups of saddles lie
beneath every tree. Their owners are already scattered
about the turf, while hundreds of negroes are ready,
within and withoutthe circle, pushing forward wherever
there is promise of novelty, and anxious to emulate their
betters in perilling every sixpence in their possession
on the legs of their several favorites. There 'is a yet
greater attraction for these in the huge whjte tent,
spread at one extremity of the area; over which hang,
in greasy and tattooed folds, the great stripes and stars
of the nation. The attraction here is a novelty. It is
a company of circus-riders. Their steeds, gayly capa-
risoned, have already gone in clamorous' procession over
the course to the sound of music; 'a thousand negroes
have followed at their heels. Their exercises begin at
the closing of the races, which cannot possibly taker
place before the afternoon. The internal to these ~is
one of the most trying anxiety; to be soothed in part
only by the events of the race. For this, the prepara-
tions are actively in progress. A glance at the opposite
extremity of the ring, where the "judges have a rude
but elevated structure, not unlike a Chinese pagoda,
shows us a handsome 'sprinkling of other visitors, on
horse and foot. Many of these have a deeper interest

in the progress of the day than arises from simple
curiosity. There are the sportsmen, the jockeys, the
owners of horses, their admirers, riders, and those who,
in some way, look to the future with some selfish con..
sideration. They dart about in' large survey, or crowd
in groups around some favorite steed or speaker. There,
you may see a dozen around the drum, whose office it
is to give the signal which sets horse and man in motion;
and not far distant, you may behold the amateur fifer tha~t
perambulates merrily' by himself, discoursing through
his instrument, somewhat imperfectly, of Robin Adair
and Roslyn Castle. Others, again, are more busily
and officially'employed. They. are weighing steed and
rider, measuri~ig the track, taking down bets and entries,
and, altogether, looking and behaving as if the next
movement of the great globe itself dep~bnded upon the
wise disposition which that moment should make of their
affairs.
Looking I3eyond this circle, and the prospect is equally
encouraging. The eye naturally falls first upon the
imposing cortege of the higher classes. Here you per-
ceive, in coach, carriage, barouche,' and buggy, that the
upper ten thousand are tacitly permitted by the multi-
tude to form a little community to themselves. The
vehicles crowd together, as if in sympathy, the carriage-
~poles interlacing; the horses withdrawn and fastened
in the shade of neighboring thickets. Here, seated in
their carriages, appear the ladies, as various in their
ages as in their separate style of beauty. They form
close compact knots, or circles, according ~o the degrees
of intimacy between them, and jealously force out all
intruders ; 'leaving such avenues only as will permit the
approach on horseback of their several attendants and
gallants. Showily and richly dressed, and, surrounded
by tljese dashing gentry of the other sex, all well mounted
and eager to show' their horsemanship, they give to the
scene a gayety and brilliance which wonderfull$r add to
its life and animation. Their gallants whirl around
them with anxious attentions; now fly off to ascertain

the course &amp;f events, and now dash ~back, at full speed,
to report progress. They describe and designate the
horses to the, ,~elighted fair ones, direct them in their
~ choice of favorites, and Jose to them glove and ribbon
with the happiest gallantries. You i~ay. note th~ em~
blems and badges upon each fair bosom; these. are white
and pink, and red and green; they designate the colors~
of the selecte~t horses; 'and beauty, in this way, does
not feel mortified at being made tributary to the 13 east.
The numerous multitude, if less attractive in~
their exhibitions, are much more various and not less
imposing. A. glance to the right coi~fines the eye to
a crowd in the midst of which a wagon appears~ sure
high ed by a r~d streamer which waves tWenty feet
froni the peak of a pine sapling. The' shaft is
rigidly held in its perpendicular by the. embrace of a
group of barrels, from one of which the more abstemious
may obtain a draught of domestic, cider or' switchel;
while from another, the stronger head imbibes his mo~
dicum of whiskey or apple brandy; a poor Western
apology for Irish poteen, which, after the first season,
our Patrick learns to swallow with something of the
relish with which he smacked his lips upon the brown
jug in his' native island. Other wagons and flags appear~
each in the nn~rgin of the thickets, sheltered by .it~.
shade, yet not hidden from the eyes of the thirsty and
hungi~y citizen. They divid~ themselves, according to
their experience, between the several wagons; and it's-
"Ha, Uncle Billy, and what 'have you got~ for a dry
throat to-day ?" Or-.
"Thar you ar', Daddy Nathan, as bright as a bead
of brandy, always bringing something for a' tharsty. sin~
ner !" And Uncle Dilly responds with a smile:
"Yes, Joel, my son,, and it's J tha1~s never too olil
for the service ;"-or, Daddy Nathan shouts back, with
the voice of a "blood-o'nouns,"
"And what would you hey', you great jughelly with
a double muzzle? Ain't I here for the. saving of such
miserable ainn~rs as you, that~ never think you're half

hungry pike jumps up for~the bait, jest because his nose
tells him it's sartainly out 's~iiiewhar' in' the~ pond."'
Then comes the rugged wit' in; answer, fashioned
after ,the same model; a mild, good-'hu~6red banter;
ending'with a summons to' the boys, to "come up to the
rack," and try the peach or apple 'brandy, the whiskey
or the 'cider, each according to his taste, of the uncle
or the daddy.
"Whose treat ?" demands 'two or three in the same
breath.
"Who's~but Joel Norris's?" or Pete Withers's, or Ben
Climes's, or some other well-known boy.of the masses,
whom, they have' learned' to reverence for that equal
freedom of" hand which enables thein~ with just the
same readiness, to bestow buffet or beverage, acoord-
ing to the 'mood of the moment, or the character 'of the
provocation' given. Atici thus the groups form; and the
meeting, leads 'to the drinking; the drinking to the bet-
ting; and they pait, or group themselves together,
busy, from the moment in which they appear upon 'the
add; much more earnest in the pursuit of fun than in
the prosecution of their daily tasks.
He 'must be of difficult taste, indeed, whom such a
theatre will fail to satisfy. Yonder, upon the grass, sit
a cluster of rustic damsels. 'They are only spreading
their baskets of cakes, gunjas~ as they call 'them, and
boiling huge vessels of 'coffee, Beyond them, at a
little distance, a~pc'ar others of the sisterhood, busy in
preparing their tables With, plate; knife, and fork. To-
wards noon you will see them smoking with hot dishes,
and well surrounded by hungry gamesters.' Cards and
dice already begin to 'interest other parties, thai 'crouch
away i~ remoter places along the skirts of the wood;
and' the more ~personal matters of "poker" and "old
siedge"'rensler many an ardent spirit momentarily in-

different to. the a~pproa~,hing. horserace, upon which he
has no sixpence left to stake. You will see, him ~stai~t
to his feet: as the shouts of the crowd without, and
the rush of the horses, announce ~the approach of the
contending steeds; but 8 glance suffices ~ and, satisfied
that he neither wins nor ~1oses by the event, he sinks
down upon the turf or log, and renews the gam~ of
"brag" with fresh noncl~aldnce and audacity.
Look, now~ at the ring forming within the wood, where
an eager ci~'cle. encourage two rivals to a stand-up
wrestle. .They are stripped to the buff; the br~ad br~as~,
and full, rigid muscle, promising a noble struggle. They
approach with equal deliberation and gob4-humor, and
the hug is fairly taken.. They pause, and each lifts the
other from his feet.; and now they bend to it and wave
to and fro,' like tail saplings~ shaken adversely by eapri-
cious winds; now yield, now recover; a stein,' close
issue, very doubtful to the bystanders, who~ soon for~
getting their individuality, unconsciously follow the
wrestlers in all their contortions, and, before they know
where they are, glide frito the ring and into the, em-
brace of welhniatched. opponents, with ~w'hom they tug
and tumble about without a single word of preliminary.
In the shade of yonder avenue~ you see a couple at-
'tended by their admiring followers, coats and shoes cast
off, hands clasped, and about to dart forward in a foot-
race of a hundred yards. Beyond them, still 'farther in
the 'wood, you are called upon to witness, a trial of skill
between the crack rifles of two adjoining counties, of
whom their respective friends have been boasting for
several seasons. They have now, for the~ first time,
been brought together. A race-turf, like that of lila-
bee, will assemble the best fellows of several counties
upon extra~rd~inary occasions. They have planted a
dollar at eighty yards. Could a shilling be seen ~t
that distance; the smaller coin had been preferred

"Well, kiver them I"
"A short horse is soon curried."
"Are you man enough, Ned Ramsey, to curry a long
one ?" cried one from the crowd, who now pressed for-
ward and appeared amid the ring. His presence caused.
a sensation. It was well calculated to do so. He was
small of person; a lively, dapper-looking person, seem-
ingly of gentle birth and of occupations which implied
no labor ;-a smooth, pale cheek, and a bright, restless
black eye. His hair was long, and fell from under a
green cloth cap, from which hung a gay green tassel;
and several great rings might be seen upon his fingers.
But the rest of his equipment was what fixed every eye.
It consisted of a close-fitting jacket, with a short tail,~
like that of a light dragoon, and small-clothes, all of
scarlet, after the fashion of an English jockey, and his
white-topped boots completed the equipment. The habit'
had been copied from an English print; and a good leg,
and rather good figure, though petit, had justified, in
the eye of vanity, the strange departure from all the
customs of the country.
"It's Captain Jones Barry," ~sa~ one of the specta-
tors, in an under tone, to another who had ii~ade some
inquiry: "He's rich enough to make any sort of fool~
ofrhimself and nobody see the harm of it." At the
same moment, it could be seen that Ned Ramsey ex-
changed significant looks with the well-dressed* stranger,
who had been his shadow through the morning, as if
disposed to say, "This is our man."
"I say, Ned Ramsey," cried Barry, "are you man
-enough to curry a large horse? I've seen your nag;~
she's a pretty creature,' that's true; but I know some-
thing of Jake Owens's 'Crazy Kate,' and I don't care
if I could put a customer on her heels, against your'n."
"You don't, eh! well, Squire Barry, you're a huckle-'
berry above my persimmon, but I reckon something 'can
be done. I believe in 'Graystreak,' and will go my

death on her. 'Twon't take much to bury me, that's
true; but what thar is-"
"There! can you roll out against that ?" asked Barry,
as he laid a fifty dollar note upon his palm.
"~Tw~ll go hard to drain me dry, but I ain't to be
bluffed, neither; and though it takes from what II put
away to pay for .the nag, here's at you!" and the re-
quired amount was brought forth; but this time it came
from a side pocket, in the coat of Ramsey, who, it was
observed seemed to find some difficulty in detaching it
from its 'place of security. Lazy Jake Owens was not
insensible to this demonstration. It seemed to open to
him new views of the case, and he now proceeded to re-
examine the strange animal upoii which so good a judge
as Ned Ramsey had so much to peril. But the new-
corner, whom we' shall know hereafter as Squire Barry,
was not similarly impressed with the proceeding.
"Too much," said he, "for 'Crazy Kate,' Ned Ram-
sey! I have a nag of my own, as nice a little bit of filly
as is on the ~ground to-day.' I ~reckon you never saw
or heard of her. Her name was 'Betsey Wheeler,' a
crack mare of this county, and her sire was a New Or-
leans horse, whose i~me I now forget."
"I know the mar you speak of," answered Ramsey,
looking up, but without appearing to discover the man
Burg, who stood behind Barry, ~and to whom he had
* spoken of this same mare an hour before in terms of e~&amp;-
- feeding admiration. "The mar', 'Betsey Wheeler,' was
famous at a hunt. I can't say for the filly; I don't
know that I ever seed her. But you can tell me what
about her, Squire ?"
"She's mine, ~and I believe in her; I believe in her
against your 'Graystreak,' there: that I do !"
"Well,, Squire, you have a right to 'believe in your
nag; she's ~your own, and you know her., 'Gray-
streak~s' mine, though not quite paid for yit, and I've a
notion that i've a right to believe in her; she's got the
heels to believe in. But what's the use of believing
when every picture (bank-note) that ~you have has got its

fellow already? If you was to go your belief ~'ery
strong, I couldn't say a word agin it !"
"What say you to another fifty ?"
"It's tough, but let's see your filly; if she's much like
her dam," hesitating.
"What! scared, old fellow ?"
"No! not exactly seared, but a little dubious! I
know'd the dam; she was a. clean-heeled critter."
* Looking up, he pretended to discover 'Burg, the for-
mer owner of the filly, for the first time. "Ah!" said
he, "Burg, you're a keener." Barry looked gratified..
He exulted in the notion that he had bluffed the bully;
and Ramsey walked forward, with a side-long air,
switching .his whip as he went with the manner of a
man half discomfited. lie was pinned suddenly by Lazy'
Jake Owens, who had just returned from a reinspection
of "O-raystreak."
"Ned," said the latter in a whisper, calling him
aside, "I see your game! We've got but three V's on
this brush; if you'll let me~ I'll take the fence and say'
quits ?"
"What, hedge ?" said Ramsey; " no you won't !"
do as you please; but, if this bet's to hold, you don't
Jones Barry."
"You'll not put your' spoon into my dish, Jake ?"
"I w6n't be dished myself if Ican help it."
"Well! I'll let' you off, if you'll let your nag run.
Keep your tongue, and you may keep your. V s."
"It's a bargain-mum's the word !"
"Do you know this filly, Jake ?" said Ramsey, half
aloud, as 'he saw Barry approaching.
"A nice critter to the eye, but I never seed her run.
Her dam was a beauty for a n;iile stretch or so."
"There she stanAs !" cried Barry; "'I'll back her
against the field for any man's hundred."
"I'll take you I" quickly responded the stranger, who
was Ramsey's shadow.
"Who's he ?" inquired Ramsey, in a whisper of Barry
himself.

"I don't know him at all," answered. Barry. "But
I reckon he'll show hi~ money."
"I'm ready to cover, sir," was the remark of the
stranger, showing his money just as if he had heard the
whispered reply of Barry to Ramsey. The bet was
taken down, and the bill covered in the hands of a third
person. Ramsey did not linger to behold these pro-
ceedings, but occupied himself in a close' examination of
]3arry's filly. The eye of the latter, with an exulta-
tion which it could not conceal, beheld the grave ex~res~
sion in that of the jockey. He saw the head of the
latter'shaken ominously.
"Isn't she a beauty, Ramsey? I call hei the 'Fair
Geraldine,' after the most beautiful lady in the world."
"You're right, to pay the filly such a compliment.
She's the most sweetest little critter! Will you sell her,
squire ?"
"Sell 'her; no! not for any man's* thousand dollars."
'~ You'll not get' t4at, I reckon. But she's got the
heels; that's cla'r! she'll run 1"
"Will she? well! Can she do 'Graystreak?'"
"N-o! I don't exactly think she can."
"You don't?' well! Can 'Graystreak' do her ?"
"Y-&amp;s! I reckon."
"You reckon? well! If such is your reckoning, I sup-
pose you're ready to match your mind with your money.
What'll you go, on the match?"
"Well, squire, you see I'm quite clear up. 'Bating
what I've put aside to pay for 'Graystreak,' I don't
suppose I've got more than a single Mexican or~ two.
I might raise three, or, prehaps, five upon a pinch; but
I shouldn't like to go more."
"2Be it five, then," said Barry, eagerly; and the seem-
ingly reluctant 'pieces were fished up to the light~ out' of
the assorted contents of the deep pockets of the jockey.
"Now," said Barry, tauntingly; "what's the value' of
a horse, if you're afraid to risk on her? You say you've
got money to pay for 'Graystreak?' How much did you
give for her ?"

~C Oh! that's telling, squire."
"Well, I don't care to know; but how much have
you made up towards paying.
"Well, a matter of seventy-five or eighty dollars left."
"Which might be a hundred. But whatever it 10, N"ec~
Ramsey, I'm clear that if~you valued the heels of your
horse at all; if, indeed, you were not frightened, you'd
see it all covered before
course."                you'd be bantered off the
"Squire, you're a little to~ hard upon a fellow," wa~
the so~e~hat deprecating reply.
"Oh! it's the turn against you, then, Ramsey," was
the retort Jf Barry. "You had the laugh and banter:
against everybody before. Well! you can taste the feel-
ing for yourself. Now, if you're a man, I banter you to~
empty yotir pockets on the match; every fip down; an&amp;
I cover ~it, fip for fip, and eagle for e~gle. I'm your
man, Ramsey, though you never met with him before."
It w~s with the air of the bully, desperate with
defeat' and savage with his apprehensions, that ~Ramsey
dashed his hands, into his bosom, drawing forth, as he
replied, a pocketbook which' had hitherto been un-
shown-
"I'm not to be bantered by any man, though 1. lose
every picayune I have in the world. 'I'm a poor man,
but, make or break, thar goes. NQ man shall bluff me~
off the track, though the horse runs off her legs. Thar,
squire, you've pushed me to the edge of the water; and
now I'll go my death on the drink. Thar! Count! Ef
my figuring ain't out of the way, thar's one hundred
and five dollars in that heap !"
"That's the notch," said a bystander, as the bills
were counted.
"Covered I" cried Barry, with. a look of exultation.
He had obtained a seeming victory over the cock of the
walk. The more sagacious "Lazy Jake Owens," how-
ever, muttered to himself, with the responding air of
one who was compelled to acknowledge the genius of
the superior:

"A mighty clever chap, that Ned Ramsey, by the
hokey V~ His mar' is paid for this day, if he never paid
for her before."
Barry~ cook-sure, of the result, now slapped his pocket-
book with the flat of his hand, as he lifted it over his
head, and cried to the circle around him:
"There is more money to be had on this match,
gentlemen. Here 'are a couple of bran new C's (hun-
dreds) ready for company. Who covers them against
the 'Fair Geraldine?'"
The stranger, the distant shadow of Ramsey, again
modestly approached with two similar bank-notes al-
ready in his hands. The bets were closed.
"I must find out who that stranger is," muttered
Ramsey, in the hearing of Lazy Jake Owens and Barry.
The latter did not seem to hear or to attend to him;
but, as he walked away, Lazy Jake whispered to Ram-
sey:
"If so be you ain't pretty well knowing to each other
already, Ned."

in a way that Lazy Jak~ understood, and the parties
dispersed in search of other associates and objects. The

CHAPTI~R V.
IN WHICH THE FLEETNESS OF HORSES, AND TilE CAPRICES
OF WOMEN, ARE EQUALLY CONSIDERED. =
WE left our' two sworn friends on the road, rushing
'3    f
forward, at a pleasant canter, foi~ the race-course. They
were within a mile of it, when they were joined by one
who came forth suddenly from a private avenue through
the woods, which conducted to his homestead. The
parties at once recognized each other as old acquaint-
ances. The stranger was a goodlooking person of thir-
ty; not exactly one whom we should call a gentleman,
but a frank, hearty, dashing, good companion, such as
one likes to encounter at muster-ground or hunting-chib.
He was, simply dressed. in the habits of~ the conutry;
not those of the plain farmer, nor those of the profes.-
sional man. A loose, open hunting-shirt of blue home-
spun, with ~a white fringe, was not considered a habit too
picturesque for the regiQn, and it sat becomingly upon.
the large frame, and corresponded with the easy and
not ungraceful 'carriage of the wearer. Tom Nettles
was a character, but not ,an ~obtrusive one; a i~nan, and
not a caricature. He loved fun, but it came t6 him
naturally; was something of a practical joker, but his
~;   merriment seldom left a wound 'i~ehind it; his, eyes were
L    always brightening, as if anticipating a good thing, and
they did not lose this expression even on serious occa-
sions. Tom Nettles was much more likely to go into a
fight with a 'grin on his visage' than with any more ap..
proptiate countenance. But let him speak for himself.
F "Good morning, Miles; good morning, Hammond;
you're on the road something late, are 'you not ?"
lli~ salutation was answered in similar' manner, and
Hammond replied to his inquiry:

"Something late? No! We are soon enough, I
fancy."
"Quite SOQII enough for the race," said the other;
"but Jones Barryrode by my house two hours ago, and
stopped long enough to tell 'me that' he was to be on the
ground early to see Mi~ss Geraldine Foster. He said
you had both made the same 'promise, and he was ient to
have the start of y~u. He seems to think it a rule in
love matters, as in a barber-shop, first come first served,
and the first comer always the best customer." Randall
Hammond smiled, but said nothing; while Miles Hen-
derson, taking. out his watch,. looked a little anxious as
lie remarked:~
"'We are later than 'I tbeught for."
"Soon enough, Miles,~' said Hammond, assuringly.
Nettles continued
"But you should see the figure Barry has made, of
himself. He's. dressed, froi~head to foot, in scarlet, and'
pretends that it's the right dress for a man that means
to run his own horse.. lie says it's the dress of one of
the ~Englis'h noblemen-I / forget his name-who has'
grown famous on the turf. He owns, you know, that
clever little filly of 'rBetsey Wheeler,' that belonged to
Burg Fisher. ~The dam was a good thing, and the filly
promises to be something more, if Barry don't spoil her
with his notions;. and he's full of them. He means to
~un the filly to-dq, and has~~ christened her the 'Fair
Geraldine,' after a young h~dy you know, both of you,
N   I reckon. But, though he may get the lady, 'if he's not
wide awake he'll be chiselled in the race; for Ned Ram-
sey is out, with his eye set for game, and he's too old a~
hand at the game not to do a, young, 'foolish fellow like
Jones Barry, with mighty little trouble."
The friends allowed. 'their companion to talk. He was
a person to use the privilege. They interposed a "'no"
or "yes," ~t'. intervals,. and this. perfectly satisfied him.
Hammond, meanwhile, was good-humored in his replies,
and quite at his ease. It was not so with Henderson.
Re referred to hi~ wat&amp;IL. repeatedly, and more than

once made a movement for going forwards at a pace
more rapid than that into which they had fallen aftt~r
Nettles had joined them.' But. his companions, on the
contrary, seemed 'both equally determined not to second
the movement. Whey hung 'back, and, Hammond point-
edly said-.
"Don't hurry, Miles. This good little fellow, Barry,
attaches so much importance to hi~ being first' in the
field, that it would be cruel to disturb his prospects."
Nettles smiled, lie understood the speaker, and knew
equally well his character and that of his companion.
"If being in' a hurry," said he, "' would win ..a lady,
then Barry's the boy f~r conquest. But there's the
mistake. It's my. notion' that it's the last 'coiner that's
most likely to do the safe business~ and not the first. A
young girl likes to look about her. She soon gets used
tQ one face and the' talk of one man, and likes a change
that's 'something new.. I wouldn't be. too late; I wouldn't
stay off till the very last hour.; wand I'd .always be near
enough to be seen and heard' of now and then; nay, I'd
like to "be caught sometimes looking 'in the direction of
the lady; but then I'd make it a rule never to be too
soon or too frequent. It's most important of all things
that a man shouldn't be too cheap.1 Better 'the girl
should say, 'I wonder why he don't come,' than 'I won-
der why he does.'"
Our philosopher of the piny wood~ might have gone
on for a ~ longer stretch, had he not been 'inter-
rupted by an event' that gave a new direction to the
party. 'They had 'reached a bend 'in the road which
gave them glimpses of another which made a junction
with it, and not fifty yards off they discovered the. car~
riage of Mrs. Foster coming directly towards theme
They at on.pe' joined it and made their respects, Miles

more sloi~ly following at' his heels.

niece; Sophia Blane, a girl of twelve. Mrs. Poster was

70           AS GOOD AS A COMEDY OR~
an ill-bred, pretentious woman, who had succeeded the
mother of Geraldine in the affections of her father, at a
time when his feeble health and the impaired condition
of his intellect rendered him too anxious for a nurse to
be" too scrupulous about a companion. He had raised
her from an humble condition to one which she was ill
calculated to fill; and, with the ambition to be some-
body, she determined to carry her point by audacity
rather than by art, She was a bold,'forward beauty in
her ~routh; was a bolder woman now, still pleasing in
her face, but no longer a beauty; a woitian given to
petty scandals, and satisfied with petty triumphs; en-
vious of the superior, malicious~ where opposed, and in-
solent when submitted to. What was defective or cen-
surable in the manners of her step-daughter was dearly
referable to. the evil influence of this woman, and the
d~uhtful training of the distant boarding~sChool to which
she had been confided at. a very 'early period of her life.
That she was 'not wholly'spoiled by these unfavorable
influences, was due wholly to the native excellence of
her, mind and heart. She was a passionate, 'selfwilled
damsel; not easily rendered submissive in conflict; ca-
pricious 'in her tastes, yet tenacious of her objects;
delighting in the exercise of power, without any d~flnite
idea' of its uses or value'; and by no means insensible to
those p personal charms which, indeed, were beyond all
question; even of the hostile and the jealous. But, in
opposition to these evil characteristics, 'she was magnani-
mous and generous; her heart was peculiarly susceptible
~ treatment and impressions of kindness. If her tastes
were capricious, they at least were always directed to
objects which were delicate and noble; if she was pas-
sionate, it was when roused by sense of wrong or sup-
posed injustice; if she was slow to submit' in conflict, she
was' never long satisfied with a victory, which a calmer
judgment taught' her was undeservedly won, and she
knew how to restore the laurels which she had 'usurped,
with a grace and ~ti sWeetness that amply compensated
the injustice. Her mind was vigorous 'and active, and

this led to her frequent errors; for it was a mind un-
trained, and steadfast and tenacious of a cause which, it
was yet to discover, was not tb~at of truth and justice.
She was a creature, indeed, of many contradictions; a
wild, high-souled, spiritual, but capricious creature; the
very ardor of whose temperament led her into tumultuous
sports of fancy, such as only shock beyond forgiveness
the staid and formal being to whom there is but one
God, whose name is Fashion'; but one law, the record of
which is found only in what my neighbor thinks.
Randall Hammond was by no means insensible to her
faults; but he ascribed them 1~o the proper cause, He
felt that she was a, character; but a character ~whic~h
could be shaped, by able hands, into that of a noble
woman ~nd a faithful wife. He looked upon her with
eyes of such admiration as the Arabian casts upon ~the
splendid colt of the desert, whom he knows, once sub,'
dued by his art, he can manage with a whisper or a~
silken cord. But he strove-as earnestly as the Arab
who conceals his purposes, and scarcely suffers the ani-
mal whom he would fetter to see the direct purpose in
his eye---to keep his secret soul-hidden from the object
of his admiration. He was not unwilling that'she should
see that she had awakened in his bosom an -interest, a
curiosity, 'at least, which broug~it him not infrequently.
to her presence, but he strove, with all the ~success of a~
man who has a will sufficiently 'strong to subdue 'and
restrain his passions, to guard his eyes and 'his tongue
so that the depth of . his emotions could not easily, or~
at all,' be fathomed. It is sufficient here to say that
Geraldine Foster was not insensible to his superiority.
She had very soon learned to ~distinguish and~ to dis-..
critninate between her several suitors; but the bearing
of Hammond, though studiously respectful, in some de-~
gree piqued her pride. If a suitor, he was not~ a ser-.
~rant. If he spoke to her earnestly, i~ was the woman,
and not 'the angel he addressed. '~This reserve seemed
to betray a caution which no maiden likes to detect in I
the approaches of her h~ver, and seemed to implyade-

ficiency of that 'necessary ardency and warmth' which
was, in truth, the very last want which could be charged
upon this gentleman. Mrs. Foster first insinuated this
doubt into the bosom, of her step-daughter, and the feel..
ing of the consciously underbred woman made her stu-
-dious~ in keeping up the suspicion. She was not satis-
fied with the superior rank of Hammond's family; was
mortified at the coldness and distance of his mother,
whom she well knew to have been intimate with the first
wife of Mr. Foster; and, though the peculiarly respect-
ful' deportment of Hammond himself left her entirely
without occasion for complaint, the very rigor of hi~
carriage, the studious civility of his deportment, by re-
straining her freedom with his own, was a check upon
= that vulgar nature which is never satisfied till it can
subdue the superior nature to its own standards. ,Mrs.
Foster could say nothing against Randall Hammond;
but -she could not conceal her preference for all other
suitors. Miles Henderson was decidedly a favorite ; ~but
there was a charm in the idea that Barry's fortune could
positively "buy the Hammonds out and out," that in-
clined the scale of her judgment greatly in behalf of the
latter. IBut we are at the course, the horses are' taken
from the carriage, the three young - men are in. attend-
ance, and Barry is approaching.
"Dear me, Captain Barry," exclaimed Mrs. Foster,
"how splendidly, you are dressed !"
"Is that your uniform in the mi1i1~ia, Captain Barry ?"
was the demand of Geraldine. -
"l2hey'd set him up for a scarecrow, if it was," said
Nettles; "and he'd have to treat as long as the liquor
-'   lasted, before they'd let him -down."
"0 hush, Nettles; you're always with your joke 'at
everything and everybody. I Wonder what there- is in
my- clothes for you to laugh at-?" - -
"Not much, .1 grant you, while you're in 'em," was
the reply. - "But answer Miss Foster. She' wants to
know what uniform it is you've got 'on."
"Oh! ifs no uniforgi, Miss Geraldine. This is the

exact ~uit wo#n by the Earl of T&amp;tham, at the last 'Den-"
caster  races. "     -  --    -  -    ',' -  - -  -  '  -  -
"You don't say that the Earl of Tothaiu sent 'you

"No! no !0 said Mrs. Fostei'~-' "I understand. Cap-

sporting gentlemen drink deep usually before they leave
the turf, the prospect is that they become deeply ac-
quaint~d with the color of the hills before they reach
h0me."
* "0, Mr. Nettles 1" exclaimed the maternal lady.
~ Nor is the advantage wholly 'in the color," con-
tiniled. Nettles, with gr&amp;aV gravity. "The cut of the
coat is particularly cakulated' to show off the fine person
of the wearer. The absence of all skirt is favorable to
the~horseman; though '1 confess myself at a loss to guess
wlia~ us&amp;to make ot~ that little pigeon-tail depe~nd~nee
in. the rear. I can scarcely suppose it meaiit to be orDa-
mental."
All eyes followed the direction, thus' given them, and
one of' Barry's own hands involuntarily clutched the
little puckered peak which stuck out in the most comical
fashion above his hips. Barry~ began to suspect that he
was laughed at,~ and Mrs. Foster interposed, to change
the suhjeet. run ~~"'~" hI~~~rh and
mean to                    1riu~ him your-

"That I. do, iVirs. Foster; I have pretty nigh five
hundred on his heels, and I'll trust to no rider but my-
self."
*"' Well, that's right; that's what I call manly,"
said Mrs. Foster.
"Y6u have certainly a very beautiful creature, Cap-
tairi Barry," was the remark of Geraldine, turning from
a~ somewhat subdued conversation with Henderson, to
which, Hammond was an almost silent partner. "You
gentlemen," continued the fair~ girl, "are to teach me
how I am to bet. That is, you are tQ. give me your
opinions, which I shall follow as I choose. See, I have
a world of ribbons' here, and am prepared. to wear all
colors. Who has the best horses, and how many are
there to run
"You heau~. of pne, certainly, 'Miss Foster," said Net-
tles.

"Yes! and certainly Captain Barry rides a very
beautiful creature."'
"She has the logs of an. angel," said Barry.'
"Better if 'she had its wings, I should think,"~ w~s the
immediate remark of Geraldine.
"Very good, very excellent,' Miss "G&amp;aldine; cer-
tainly, for a race, the swings *of an angel might be 'of
more service than its legs~' But she will scarcely need
them, Her legs will answer.".
'"Should she lose, Barry, y6iu'il have to change l~er
name.' Do you know the name of 4hi~ beautiful' crea-
ture ?"~-To Miss Foster. She answered quietly-~.-
"0, yes'! I have heard how greatly I am honored'
and, in truth, I shall ~feel quite unhappy if she does not
win. 'I must certainly, at all hazards, 'bet upon my
namesake."
"You may do it boldly !" said i3arry; with . confi.
dence; "I'll ins~fre your losses."
"Who'll insure you, Barry? 'Your chances will de-

deal of her now; they call her 'Grayertreak;' she comes
from Mississippi. I bluffed Ramsey so tightly that I
almost scared 'him off the hill; but I brought him to the
scra~tcli, a~~d I havo covered for him to the tune of a hun-
dred and more on the match between' Graystreak' and
'~eralditic~;' b~esidessoniething like half the amount on
]I~a~y Jake's mare against' ' Graystreak.'"
"And where's this 'Graystreak?'"
The animal was only at a little distance. The pro-
prietor, the renowned Ned Ramsey, was busy, at the
inomen1~, in preparing her for the course. The eyes of
the party were directed to the beautiful creature in ad~
miratjon. She shipped to the sun finely; as if clad in
velvet. Her clean liinbs,~Wiry and slender; the spirit in
lw~r eye, and the airy life in all her action, at once fixed
the regards of so good a judge as Nettles. Nor was
Randall Hammond indilferont' to the beauty of her form,
and the promise in her limbs.
"Thisfool and his money have parted !" said Nettles,
in a whisper to Hammond. "Your horse is the only one
that can take the legs from this filly, and it wotild give
him trouble!"
The answer of Hammond was unheard, as they reap-
proached the carriage where the ladies sat.
"Well, gentlemen 1" said Geraldine, impatiently; "I
am~ eager to be busy. Come, let me have your judgment.
What horse shall I adopt as myfavorite ?"
"Are you not fairly committed to your namesake ?"
asked Hammond, with a quiet manner; his eye, how-
ever, looking deeply into hers. She answered the gaze
~y dropping hers; replying quickly, as she did so :-
"No indeed! the 'compliment to me must not 'be
made to lose my money or discredit my judgment. For
sur~, Captain IRarry~himseif-'lias no such design to injure
me. But I ~Io fancy the beauty of:hi~ horse, and if you
think her fleet, Mr. Hammond-"
Shepansed:-
"The 'Fair Geraldine' is doubtless a very fleet, as she
a very beautiful creature !"

"But," said Nettles, finding that Hammond hesi~
tated, "that strange mare you see yonder undressin
is sure to beat her."
"Sure to beat her !" exclaimed Barry, who drew nigh
in season to hear the' last words. "What'll you go on
the word?"
"Horse, house, lands, ox, ass, and everything that is
mine 1"
"Nay, nay! to the point; look to your pocketbook !"
"Well, if you will have it, we'll say a hundred on
the match; '~raystreak' agaitist ~ny horse in the field,
unless hammond runs his 'Ferraunt,' arid then 'Fer-
raunt' against the field!"
"'Ferraunti' " said Barry ; ' "that, the large iron
gray he rides. Why, he came on him !" looking ~to
Hammond inquiringly. The latter had yielded hi~ horse
to his groom, and was now sitting on the box of~ the
carriage, the driver being withdrawn to look after his
horses. "Fefraunt" was already groomed, and resting
in the shade at. a little distance under~ the charge of the
servant. The finger of Nettles pointed where he stood.
The eye of Gerahilne at once followed ~he direction of
his finger, and while 2 Barry and Nettles arranged their
stakes, and withdrew to look at "Ferraunt," a short
dialogue, not withoiit its interest, took place between
herself and Hammond.
"Is your horse2 so very fleet, Mr. Hammond, as Mr.
Nettles says heis?"
"He 'has the reputation of being a very fast horse,
Miss Foster; indeed, he is probably the fastest on the
ground."
"Well; you mean to run him, of course
"Why of course ?"
"Oh, why not? To own a race-horse, indeed, 'seems
to imply racing. What is the use of him otherwise ?"
"One may love to look at a beautiful animal with-
out seeking always to test his speed;. at all events,
without seeking to game with it."

"To game! Is not that a harsh expression, Mr.
Ilamrnond3" :.
Perhaps it- is, since gentlemen have not often the
of gain when they engage in this amusement. It
~ioble and beautiful exercise of a beautiful animal
that they practise this recreation, and not for its profits."
"Well; and gi~u could have no eye to the gains,
Mr. Hammond ?"
"No. But how small is the proportion of gentlemen,
go~rned by such principles, to those who usually col-
lect at a sceiw and on an occasion like this! ~What a
greedy appetite for gain d6es it provoke among thousands
who have no other object, and find no pleasure iti the
exquisite picture of the scene-in the glorious conflict
~f rival blood and temperament-in the wild grace of
the motion of the steeds-~--in~ all that elevates it momen-
tarily into. something of the dignity of a field of battle;.
who think only of ~the wretched results which are to
fill.. or Jemptiy their pockets. And ~of these, very few
can ~afford to win or lose. If they win, they acquire
certain~ appetites from success, which usually end in
Vheir:iruin.; ami if they lose-though more fortunate in
doing. so, as they ~are probably made disgusted with the
pursuit.~~z~they yet rob their families of absolute neces-
saries, in this miserable search after a diseased luxui~y
for themselves."
"I confess I am no philosoPher, Mr~ Hammond. I
don't see things in the ,same light with yourself, and
can, scarcely believe in such dreadful consequences from
a spectacle that is really ~o fine and 'beautiful."
"Oh," said Mrs. Foster, interposing, sneeringly; "oh,
Mr. Hammond, you get all those queer notions from
your mother.'
"You will permit me to respect the woman of my
* opinions, M~s~ Foster?" with a respectful but measured
bow.
"Oh, surely. She's an excellent woman, and I re-
spect her very much; but her notions on this subject

are very peculiar, I thinks though, in her case, natural
enough."
This was said with .a degree of significance which did
not suffer' Hammond to misunderstand the speaker. His
face was instantly and deeply suffused with crimson, as
he felt the allusion to the fate of his 'father. His head
was, for the moment, averted from the speaker.. In
that moment, the malicious woman whispered to her step-
daughter, "At him again. I know where the shoe
pinches."
A slight expression of scorn might have been seen to
curl the lips of Geraldine. A pause ensued, which was
at length broken by Jianunond, who drew her attention
to a showy procession of the pied horses, the calico
steeds of the circus company. Some comment followed
on the performances of the troupe, when the young lady,
in the most insinuating manner, resumed, with Hammond,
the subject of his own horse.
"But, Mr. Hammond, though you inveigh against
racing as a' practice, you can have no objection to run-
ning your horse, upon occasions, onOe in a way, as much
for the satisfaction of your friends as with any 'other
object. Now, I am quite pleased with your dark-look-
ing steed. What do you call him ?"
"'Ferraunt.'"
"Ah! his name indicates his color. He seems to me
a military horse.
"I got him chiefly as a'charg&amp;r.'~
"Oh, yes; I forgot; you are a colonel 'qf militia.
But, for a charger, you need an animal at once high-
spirited and gentle."
"He is both. That, indeed, Miss Foster, is the ch~
racer of all high-blooded animal's. The rule holds good
among men. The' most gentle are generally the 'most
high-spirfted~at once the most patient and the most
enthusiastic. The race-horse, next to the mule, makes
the best plough-horse.".
"But that is surely a contradiction ~ the' mule' being
the most 'dogged, stubborn, slow-.-"

"' He need not be slow. He is only slow when broken
and trained by a 'drowsy negro. But, though it seems
a contradiction, as you say, to employ animals so utterly
unlike for the same purposes, and to find them nearly
equally good, it is one that we may, and perhaps must
reconcile, on the principle that finds a sympathy in, ex-
tremes."
"Mr. Hammond, it seems to me that all this is per-
versely intended to divert me from my object." A
playful smile and arch manner accompanied this remark
of. the young lady. "But I am as perversely resolved
Wat you shall not escape. Now, then, let me hear from
you. iDo you not intend that 'Ferraunt' shall run to-
day?"
"I really do not, Miss Foster. I came out with no
such purpose.
' I'm ready for you, colonel" was the remark of
Jones Barry, who had just that moment reappeared
with, Nettles. "I'm not afraid of your 'Ferraunt,'
though Nettles tells me he's good against all thjs cro*d.
I'm willing to try him. I don't believe in your foreign
horses, when they come to, this country; the climate
don't seem t&amp; suit 'em. They're always sure to be beat
by the natives; and, after the first 'talk on their arrival,
you never hear anything said in their favor, and you
never see anything they do. Now, your 'Ferraunt'
comes of good stock, but he's awkWard-"
"Awkward !" said Nettles; "ah! Barry, if you could
only dance as well."
"Well, I'jn willing, to see him dance; and, if Col.
Hammond chooses, I'll go. a cool hundred on the 'Fair
Geraldine' against him. There's a banter for you."
"I won't run my horse, Mr. Barry."
"What, bluffed off so soon ?" said Barry, coarsely.
"Gail i~ 'what you will, Mr. Barry; I don't run
horses."
~" But, Mr. Hammond, if you are content to underlie
his challenge, you surely will not be so uneourteous
as 'to refuse mine. The 'Fair Geraldine' against 'Fer-

raunt,' for a pair of gloves. I must maintain the reputa~
tion of my namesake."
"The ~ Fair Geraldine' must excuse me, if my cour-
tesy will not suffer me to accept her challenge.
"What? ~you pretend that your horse must beat ?"
"I know it, Miss Foster."
"And what if I say that I don't believe a ivord of
it? that I equally know that the 'Fair Geraldine' is the
fastest horse? and I defy you to the trial? There, sir,
~yglove'against yours."
This was all' sweetly, if not saucily said. The eyes
of Hammond were fixed gratefully upon the speaker;
but he shook his head.
"You must forgive me, if I decline the trial in the
case of my horse. Bat, if you will permit me, I cheer-
'fully peril my , glove against your favorite in behalf of
'Graystreak,' yonder.
"No, no, sir; your horse, your 'Ferraunt.'"
"You can't refuse,~ colonel," said Barry.
"No, Randall !" said Henderson.
"Impossible !" cried Nettles; who was anxious to see
'Ferraunt' take the field."
"A lady's challenge !" cried Mrs. Foster; "chivalry
forbids that you refuse."
"I am compelled to do so, Miss Foster. 'It would
give me pleasure to comply with your wishes, but I never
run my' horse, or any horse; I never engage as a prin~
cipal in racing of any kind."
Nettles and Henderson both drew Hammond aside to
argue the matter with 'him. They were followed&amp; by
Barry, who 'was in turn followed by the jockey, Ramsey.
Nettles had his arguments, which were urged in vain;
and, when 'Henderson dwelt on the claims of the lady,
Hammond replied, somewhat reproachfully:
"Yo~&amp; know, Miles, that I shouldn't run a horse; were
all the fair women in~the world to plead."
"Well,'.' said Barry, "what a man won

"I must decline, Mr. Barry; I'm no racer, and will
not run my horse; but, let, me assure you, sir, that your
mare, though a very clever thing, could not hold her
ground for a moment against him."
"IF~asy bragging," said Ramsey, with a chuckle,
"when there's no betting."
"And as easy to lay a horsewhip over a ruffian's
shoulder, sir, when he presumes where ~he has no busi-
ness."
Ramsey~ disappeared in an instant; a roll of the drum
followed, giving notice of the approaching struggle;
and the desire to see "Ferraunt" on the ground, gave
place, among the few, to the more immediate interest
which belonged to the known competitors. Barry in-
stantly hurried off to his groom and stable; Nettles
sauntered away to the starting-post, while Henderson
and Hammond returned to the carriage. The latter
felt that the manner of Geraldine was changed. Her
eye met his, but there was a coldness in the glance,
which his instinct readily perceived; but, true to his
policy, he suffered it to pass unnoticed; was respectful
without being anxious, and attentive without showing
too much solicitude.
"You," said Geraldine to Henderson, "you, too, I
am told, ride a fine and fleet, horse; do you not intend to
run him?"
"If Miss Foster desires it."
"Of course I desire it! What do you call your
horse?"
"Sorella I"
"Sorella! a pretty name. Well, how does she run?
Is she fleeter than my namesake ?"
"What ~ay you; Randall ?"
"Oh, do~i't ask him! He will say nothing that'll please

"Let us suppose feared, Miss Foster I" replied Ham-

"I don't know what to make of you, Col. Hatrrmond.
I wish I could make something of you. But I despair;
I'll try no longer !"
"That you should have even tried, Miss Foster, is a
satisfaction to my vanity."
"Oh, don't indulge it. Tt was not to give youany
pleasure, I assure you, that I thought to try at all; only

CHAPTER VI.
THE RACE.-~CROSS PURPOSE$~
OuR preliminaries 'are all adjusted, and the moment
approaches;for. the conflict. The eyes of all' are n&amp;w
directed to the central point from which, at the tap of
the drum, the 'coiitending horses ~re:to start. The card-
players desert their' log beneath ' the shade-trees, the
greasy pack being thrust hto the 'pdcket of one of the
company till the more immediate object of interest~ is
over. The rifle-shooters 'lean' their implements against
a tree, a~id seek the common point of attraction.. The
cooks leave their seething-vessels; the negroes hurry
from their 'horses ;" all parties,' high and 'loW, big and
little, crowd upon the track; pressing upon the ropes that
guard the little space assigned to the running animals,
and crowding absolutely upo~t their heels.' The scenes
that we have Witnessed, in a few striking 'instances
already, are in: progress on a smaller scale everywhere.
Bets are freely offered and taken, now that the' horses
are uncovered and in sight. The flrst1anirnal 'that stripped
for the 'examination of the judges, was a large horse of
Jones Barry's,~ called "Glaucus,"' a great..limbed beasi~,
that proniised much more endurance than speed, and yet
had the look of' being too heavy to endure his own
weight beyond a reasonable distance. 'his. chances lay
in the faet that the race in ivhich he 'was to run~was but
a singh~ 'mile, and his less were quite' sufficient for that.
Yet "' Giancus"' did"'n~t seem much of a favorite.'
"An elephant!" cried; one.
"'Looks more likes a gin-horse than a race-horse,'~' said
another.
No go," said a third.~

more decided, among the multitude, when "Crazy Kate"
made bier appearance in the space~ Now "Crazy
Rate" was remarkable for showing nothing calculated
to persuade the casual spectator into a belief in her
fleetness. She was, in truth, a very vulgar-lp9king beast,
singularly tinmeriting the, appellation of "'Crazy," as
no creature could possibly have looked, more tame.. Her
hair was coarse, confused,' and rough,, as if shedding;
her mane was matted, and an occasional cockle-burr
could be seen hanging among the bristles; }ut all these
signs were regarded rather as the 'cunning devices of
the pld jockey, her owner, Lazy Jake Owens, than as
at all indicative of her qualities of speed and 'bottom.

covered, through all these unfavorable indices, the slen:

which denoted good blood, agility, and fleetness. The
contrast which the Mississippi mare presented to the
ungainly externals of "Crazy Kate,"' was productive
of a shout in her favor. "Graystreak" was the' model

Her skin was glossy, her eye bright and steady;'and ~he
showed, in her: movement, so perfect a union 'of spirit
and docility, that you felt, at a glance, that her training
had done full justice to her blood. There was no r~sist-
ing the impression which she made. Barry himself felt
it,but he relied upon the known cunning of Laq Jake
Owens, and was confident that still greater merits la~
beneath the unkempt, uncomely aspect of "Crazy Kate.'
Lazy Jake himself seemed as confident as ever; feeling
sure in the private engagentent with Ned Ramsey, 'Which
made him safe, at the expense~ of 'all' hi~ backers.
"You have 'now a good view' of the horses that are to
run, Miss Foster," wi~is the remark of Hammond, van-
turing to arouse the damsel from something like a reverie.
"They have already examined them, and weighed the
riders. In a few' moments, they will mount and, be~
ready for' a start. Suffer me to throw back, the top of
your barouche, when you can rise and see the whole ~field
at a glance."
"Oh! do so, Mr. Hammond, if you please.' Where
do you say I shall 'look?" Geraldine eagerly rose as
she spoke, and while Hammond threw back the top of
the carriage, she scrambled forward upon the seat' beside
him, using his shoulder with the utmost indifference'
during the proceeding.

"And theiirst?"
"Jis that 'sleek and quiet animal that 'stands imme-

for fleetness and endurance."
"Your 'Ferraunt' excepted?" said the l~idy, slyly.
"My 'Ferraunt' probably - excepted," was the. some-
what grave reply.
"I wish you would run that horse, Mr, Hammond.
For my sake you might."'
This was said in somewhat lower tones than usual.
"For your sake, Miss Foster, I would do much;' but
there is a reason-but, hark! they are preparing' for the

his shoulder. In this manner, shading her eyes with the
other hand, 'she directed her gaze upon the points to

he locked him, and was, in turn, passed by "Crazy

increase of velocity, evidently under the mo~t adroit
management of' rein. "Glaucus" struggled bravely
against this new adversary, and made a desperate push,
which succeeded in throwing "Flourish and Nabob" out
of the lead; but" Crazy Kate" still kept ahead, utEtil
her backers began to shout their exultation, when, to

"I love horses, Miss Foster; I delight in their beauty,

He disappeared in search of his friend. Mrs. Foster
sniggered, as, h~ went. Seeing her step-daughter looking
seriously, while her eyes followed the retreating form of
Hammond, she said :-

"No, he won't! mother, nor any man. I don't care
whether I marry or not. I don't see that marrying is
so necessary; .and I'm positively sick of hearing women

world to talk about."
"And so it is; a woman's z~obody until she's a wife !"
" And then she's one-body's 1"

you'll marry anybody sooner than a master."

"That 'can: hardly 'be. possible. Indeed, I'm sure,

SORJ~LLA AND THE GYPSY JOCKB~.
THE horses entered were but four in number. Th~s~
were, 912~ Mississippian, "Graystreak," "Crazy Kate,"
the "Fair Geraldine," and "Sorella." The former was
now decidedly the favorite of the field, and odds were
given in her behalf. Numerous bets were offered an4
taken, arid the excitement on the turf was great, and
momently increasing. The "Fair Geraldine" had her
backers, and so had "Crazy Kate" anct "Sorella." Bu~
the latter was little known among the regular jockeys;
and, though a symmetrical and welkshaped animal, there
were none of those salient characteristics in her appear-
ance which are apt to take the spectator. It was seen
that she was fleet; arid that she was rather bony, seemed
to promise something for her hardihood. Ned Ramsey
noticed her with some anxiety; and the watchful Lazy

hundred more.
The examination of the horses showed them off to
great advantage. "Graystreak" looked sleek, quiet,
and confident, as before. "Sorella" was a meek animal
also, with just such a twinkle of the eye as shows that
there is no lack of spirit, with all the meekness. But
the "Fair Geraldine" stripped to the survey with all the
consciousness of a proud and petted beauty. She was
restive and bright; a little too anxious and impatient,
and carried her head with a toss which was not unworthy
of her lovelier namesake. Her appearance compelled
the admiration of all; and many were tempted to bet
upon her beauty, who did not consider her heels. Her
rid~r no*~ was Jones Barry himself. , He was really
not satisfied, that Sam Perkins 'had 'not done justice to
"Glaucus;" but, whether satisfied or not, nothing could
possibly have prevented, him from doing as the Earl of
Toteham had leen said to do at iDoncaster.
~" Your favorite is ready for the race, Miss Foster!
you see'Mr. Barry takes the field in person ;" and Ham-
mond pointed to the gaudy figure of that worthy, as the

Geraldine, with Some interest.
"Yes! I knew that' Sorella' would need every advan-
tage in a contest with the Mississippi filly, and that l~Iiles
was quite too heavy to run her successfully himself."
Unconsciously, 'the girl looked pleased. 'Hamgiond
saw the expression, and mused upon it; particularly as
a querulous exclamation, at that moment, dropped from
the hostile step-mother. But the proceedings of the
course drew all eyes thither. All were saddled, the word
was given, and away they went, like
heroes, into battle.             so many ambitious
The start was .a successful one. The four~ horses
seemed to jump off together, running side by side. for
a while, as if delighting in the line and order of a platoon
charge. But soon the "Fair Geraldine" led o1~ taking
the track for a quarter of a' mile; "Crazy Kate" laying
herself close behind, and "Graystreak" and "Sorelia"
seeming to find their amusement in driving the two before
them. Before the mile was two-thirds traversed, how-
ever, "Crazy Kate" showed symptoms of lagging, and
"Sorella" dropped her with a bound, making even' play
between the "Mississippian" and the "Fair Geraldine~g'
The latter continued well on, not needing any urgency
of her rider, until the clattering heels ~of "Soreila"
and "Graystreak," ji~st at her haunches, impelled her
to an effort. She bridled up at this forwardness, and a
slight smack of the whip shocked her into a still more
indignant determination to leave all vulgar compsi~nion-
ship behind. She went off with a rocket-like impulse,
but without obtaining her object. It was now evi~
dent that the "Mississippian" was resolved to cut
her off from her triumph, and her rider Was seen to
apply the thong smartly to her sides. She passed, ac~
cordingly, between "Sorella" and the object ~of her am~
bition, and the next moment found her, lock a~nd lock, in
affectionate embrace with the high-spirited and, aristo-
cratic beauty. Yainly did the latter try to shake her off.
All her efforts only served to keep the two in this position,

~w1~en, to 4e surprise of both, a shrill whistle from the
r~d~r' of "Soreita" brought that mysterioi~s creature with
a rush between them, and flinging the dust .h~ both their
~ace~, ~she~ass~d ~tinder the string, leaving her tail hidden
between the lifted heads Qf the two emulous competitors.
"Crazy Kate" darted into the allotted 'limits quite in
season to saye her distance, having reserved her ~
for another brush.
Thp race was a beautiful one. Th~. several merit~ of
the first three horses were now fully displayed, though
the extent of their powers of endurance could only b~
conjectured. They 'had evidently 'been ridden with a
dQe regard to their qualities; and the ~ompe~titiPn was
such as to maintain the excitement of the multitude, and
to keep tlie~ in suspense till the very last moment. A
~s1~awl night ha1ve ~lapped them at ,several points in the
race; and an eli of ribbon might have circled them as
they darted 'beneath the string.' It was clear that judg-
ments' were to be revised. "Sorella" had been under-
v&amp;lued. ' "Crazy Kate" looked better than ever, and
her rider s known to be a ~rst-rate jockey; and "Gray-
streak" was under the 'teaching of the ve~ry Machiavel of
the Georgia ~uf~ The "'Fair Geraldine"i'ad behaved too
~han. lsomely to have lost any of her supporters; and,
whether "Graystreak" had yielded the heat through
policy, or actually lost it in spite 6f all his efforts, was a
very doubtful question, even among the knowing ones.
There was a whisper that she. seemed to complain in one
of her pins; but Tom. Nettles, who examined her closely,
made no such discovery. Ned Ramsey showed anxiety,
however, and this was seen by "Lazy Jake Owens," aN
w~ll as INettles. His personal care of Jiis horse was ex-
~rrq4a~ry, ~nd his efforts to enable her to recover and cool
off, without effort, were so many studies for the ~youthful
~~i~eys whq were crowding about a~d emulous of his re-
nown. Jonas Barry was by no means dissatisfied with
the 4oings of his mare. She did not seem. uneasy or
distre~s~4;'~PQlCd ~ff naturally and 500fl, and was ready
fbr the ~econd trial in the shortest possible space. But,

to have seen the affectionate care of "Sorella," which
was taken by her gypsy rider-how, in addition to the
usual stripping and rubbings, he wound his a~xns about
her neck, kissed her as if she had been a sweetheart, and
whispered all sorts of pleasant nonsense in her ears; axj~id
how the filly turned to him with a knowing gesture; and
how, when he stooped to rub her legs, her n6se rested.npon
~s his shoulders with a sort of human ititerest, which drew
~; crowds about the two in unaffected admiration I jtreal-
ized, in some degree, the stories that we hear of the
Arabian and his favorite steed. Logan Whitesides had
first had his ambition lifted by his employment in the
ining of "Sorella." She was a first-love to him, and
it would have come nigh to break his heart had he' not
achieved the victory.
'And so 'Sorella' has really won the victory?" said
Geraldine to Hammond, as he returned to the ~carriage
after a brief interview with Mil~s Henderson.
"The heat only-a third of the victory, Miss Foster.
They are now preparing fox' the second trial."
"You are a witch' in horses, Mr. ilammond.' But
pray what did you say in that short whisper which I saw
you give to Mr. Henderson and his gypsy boy ?"
Hammond laughed as he' replied
the" simply'instructed him

"I don't understand you-lose!"
"That is, not attempt to win, but suWer it to .b~ taken
by the 'Mississippian.""
"And why, pray ?"
"That her strength in the third heat should not be
perilled by an undue effort in the second; when, as most
of the other horses will put forth their best ability, she
might probably peril herself for nothing."
"I see, I see! But why lose to the 'Mississippian?'
You say nothing of my namesake !"
"Your namesake has done 'her best already."

There Was something in the tQne with which these
words were spoken, not less than the words themselves,
which grated offensively on th~ ears of the person ad-
4ressed; bnt he remained silent, and in a few moments
the p~ep~rati6ns f~r the second heat enabled him to
divert the converSatiQfl to a~riothe'r channel. i~t the sig-
nal given by the drum, Geraldi4e again stood upon the
seat of the carriage, an eager spectator of the 'issue. The
word~ was given, and the start was again beautiful; the
four steeds seeming to lap each other, whirling &amp;wa~y for
a while, in a sort of linked movement, which' showed
them all as if locked together in mutual relationship.
"Crazy Kate" and "Geraldine" were soon again in the
lead, as if by mutual consent between "Sorella" and
"G~aysti~eak ;" 'swinging forward by the groups of spec-
tators, 'the' wagons audi the tables, east and west, 'as. if
waltzing with wings at both feet and shoulders. Merrily
did they glide away, leaving a space of thirty feet or
more b~twe~n their competitors, who appeared perfectly
~
neither, yet enabled them to keep always within speaking
'distance of the lively' things in front. Thus trailing for

the ~rst mile and better, they suffered the game to be
played by other bands, only piping moderately to the 'uw
sic. But soon the "'Mississippian" began t~ grow restive
under restraint, and to put forth a much more arnbitiou~
leg than he had hitherto shown. He lifted away from
"$orella~" and was soon upon the heels of the two ahead.
A few bounds enabled him to separate the links between
them, and to throw himself 'towards the back stretch of
the second mile, between "Crazy Kate" and her i~iir
conipetitor. "Sorella" made a similar push forward,
and soon overcame the, space ~ihich kept her from the
embrace of "Crazy Kate' ;" but' whether it was that the
latter was less tempting than the beauty with the beauti~
ful name, she did not prolong the te~te-a-t6te with her,,
but hurried forward to ~ more select meeting with the
"Fair Geraldine;" perhaps it was a feelingof sympathy~
which, at this moment, prompted the latter to 'forego h~
exertions, and loiter for the coming up' of one who sought
her so closely. Meanwhile, the ambitious maid of Mis~
sissippi darted ahead of all opponents, and, with so few
tokens of civility, as to provoke the emuiou~ efforts of
the two nearest riders. Jones Barry w~is seen to apply
the whip with unlind severity of hand, to the tender
flanks of his favorite; while the gypsy boy who rode
"Sorella" appeared to urge her forward with the utmost
seeming anxiety, but without the use of any"weap'on. It
was now perceived that the "Fair~Geraldine," as if under
a feeling of degradation, no longer lifted a hopeful and
exulting head, nor tossed pridefully her luxuriant mane.
That she began to droop was evident to the spectators,
while the repeated' strokes of the lash, from her rider,
betrayed his own consciousness of 'a~~ fact which he was
quite unwilling to believe. ~These exertions still gave
her headway for awhile, but it was, at the expense, of her
heels. She gradually relaxed after' 'these efforts, and
soon had the fortificationn to fincL" Sorella" quietly work~
ing ahead, as they both stretched through the first quar~
ter of the third mile. Hammond saw~ with satisfaction,
that, while the boy who rod~ "~Sorel1a" ~ppeared. to

labor anxiously, he used no whip, or only appeared to do
so, while the beast lifted her legs freely, and set them
down as if on velvet. The crowd, who knew nothing of
his game, now looked upon it that she shared the ex-
haustion of "geraldine," and were quite deceived by the
arts of her rider. Even Ramsey himself counted upon
him as a horse "done brown ;" and whispered to Lazy
Jake Owens that the race was won. But Lazy Jake was
no slouch at an opinion either, in the matter of horse-
flesh; ~and he answered, in the common proverb of war-
ring in the South: "Don't whoop before you're out of
the wood." But this heat was decided. The "Mississip-
pian~' had shown the cleanest heels, taking the track from
all. It was observed that "Sorella," after once or twice
yielding the lead to the "Fair Geraldine," now changed
the figure~ entirely, and hastened forward so as to throw
herself within a few decent bounds of "Graystreak," as
the latter passed in under the string, the final victor of
the heat. The native spirit of" Geraldine" did not suffer
her to fall behind very far, though it was evident to all
good judges that the game with her was u~ for the da~r;
while "Crazy Kate" enjoyed to herself the Irishman's
fun of driving all the rogues before her. Of the three
winning horses, "Sorella" was the only one who hadbeen
economized, and the excellence of her jockey enabled
her to keep' this important fact a secret.' A couple of'
lengths between her and "Graystreak, and twice the
number between her and "Geraldine," left the minds of
th&amp;miiltitude still in that condition of doubt in regard
to ~'the future which makes equally the interest of race
and story. The betting parties were still hopeful; for,
even where their favorites had not won, they came so
near it, with the exception of "Crazy Kate," as to leave
nothing certain in the chapter of coming events.
Well rubh~ed and' groomed, three' horses showed them-
selves for the third' time upon the track. "'Crazy Kate"
has withdrawn in dudgeon, in consequence of the mani-
fest neglect with which her companions have treated her
performances. Her backers have sullenly yielded up

their tjn to the niwierous friends of the "Mississippian;"
while Ramsey, and the unknown gentleman, have been
reminding numerous persons of certain fi4~es, tens, t~&amp;n-
ties, and hundreds-including our, friend Jones Bar4ry-.-
which they unwisely perilled on the heels of .a fem~nin~
creature avowedly non eompo8. This pleasant little
episode greatly relieved th~ otherwise tedious interval
between the second and the last heat. The "Fair Gerald-
ine" seemed to have recovered her fQrrner spirits, as she
came once more upon the turf; and, with the word "Ge,"
she led oW, "solitary and alone," as she had been
ambitious to do on all previous occasions. But, &amp;fte~i'
the first half mile, both the "Mississippian" and "3orella"
seemed disposed to make play., and to show that both
had heels of wing and steam when the exigency was
at hand. It was clear, however, that the two latter
waited for each other. They knew the real adversary,
and knew exactly when to terminate that deference for
the beauty who now led them which, it was evid
had yielded r4laer througE policy than   ent, they
admiration~ A8
the first mile was overcome, they gradually swalloy~red
space, taking the wind completely out of the sails of
"Geraldine," passing On each side of her, and closing
up,, as if an~i~us for the track. Barry at once put on
steam with a heavy hand, but no application to the
flanks, in the case of one so tender, could possThly fur-
nish the legs with the proper facility for fligiw. The
beauty wanted age for endurance. "Send me no more
boys," said Napoleon to the government at home: "they
only fill the hospitals."' The tender years of" Gerald-
me," her delicate training, were adverse to her soldier-
ship. Fan~ous at a charge, she cou1~d not stand the
campaign. The two veterans, better fortified by muscle
and training, of better bottom and not less speed, soon
forged ahead, and left her painfully to struggle up the
hill alone. "Graystreak" was evidently girdling up
her loins for the last great effort. She felt the necessity
of putting all her soul into her heels, as she felt that ~she
had a sterling customer beside her, one who took a deep

shot, and, loved long reckonings. There were bone, and
muscle, and speed, to be overcome, and she had a pride
and reputation at stake, to say nothing of the hundreds
which our friend Jones Barry no doubt found cool' enough
by this time. There was evident mischief in the "Missis-
rnppian." Her rider glared round, in his whit~ uniform,
at the queer little gypsy rogue who kept tenaciously
with him, neck and neck, as if measuring their mutual
strength for the last great struggle. It was neck or
nothing with them both. Both were resolute to do, or
die. The gypsy rogue seemed to crouch, at moments,
in his saddle, as if to take the leap of a cougar on the
fox, and his heels would sink slightly into the sides of
his creature, as if embracing her with a love which found
all its pleasures in hers. Side and side they rode, un-
til, in the eyes of the distant spectators, they seemed to
resolve themselves into a single man 'and horse. The
struggle was desperately close. It was your purse or
mine, as they darted eagerly towards the last quarter
stretch, leaving the wind behind them, and seeming' to
whiz along through air, as a bullet from the cannon.
"The bravest held his breath for a time." The multi-
tude pressed forward along the track. Mouths were
open wide with expectation; eyes dilating beyond their
orbs, with' delight and anxiety.
"How beautiful 1" exclaimed Geraldine Foster, as she
grasped the arm' of Hammond.
"Beautiful!" said Hammond, naturally enough, as
he gazed into her eyes. We dare not look with him while
the struggle is thus at its height. The jockey on "Gray-
streak" now made tremendous efforts; his eye fixed on
the stubborn little, gypsy, a~ if to note the opening for
an advantage. Neck and neck they still clung together,
and but a few more bounds were necessary to the final
~chievemei~t~ "Wliitejacket" gathered himself up for the
last~issue, and, rising in his stirrups, with the whip keen-
ly and rapidly administered, he raised the head of
"Graystreak" for the final bound beneath' the line.,
But "Nojacket," our little gypsy, knew'his moment 'also.

He gave no whip; he rose' not in the saddle; but ciouch-
ing, rather, and clinging upon her neck, he whispered a
word, a single word, in the ear of "Sorella," and the
noble Arabian went out of the lock in a way to make
an arrow wonder. By a single head, she passed ahead
of her resolute competitor; and, as her ~triumph was be-
held, the big, swollen heart of the multitude relieved
itself by a shout that shook the field. Then our gypsy..
jockey dropped from his creature, and seized her about
the neck, kissing her once more as passionately as the
lover, for the first time successful. He felt the triumph
as much more precious than he did the "cool. hundred,"
one of the several that had been transferred on this oc-
casion from the pockets of the wealthy J7ones Barry to
those of other people, with which' Miles' Henderson
rewarded him for his riding. Then might the multitude'
be seen following, the horses-horse and rider-with ex-
ultation and 'admiration. Our gypsy' was, next to his
horse, the wonder of the field. The' boys scampered
after him as their hero, while the negroes, everywhere
exclaiming as he came, pointed him out to their grinning
companions, as "Dat little Login Whitesides; da's a
debjAe hese'f~, for ride !" Glory is a thing of 'various
complexions; and our little friend Logan 'was quite as
well satisfied, no doubt, with the negro form of compli..'
ment, as with that which issued in rounded periods from
more polished lips. Let us now look to other parties.

CHAPTER VIII.
THE GANDER TOURNAMENT.
THE. exc~ilent lady, Mrs. Foster, was quite dissatisfied
at the result of the race.' Perhaps she might have been
still more so, had the victory been obtained by" Fer-
'raunt," instead of "Sorella;" by the horse of Hammond
in place of' that of his friend. She did not conceal her
mortifi-cation, which vented itself in expressions of strong
sympathy with Jones Barry, even in the presence of his
conqueror. 'He, however, either was, or affected to be,
wholly indifferent to the result. He had. various excuses
for the defeat,' which he could- ascribe to any and every-
thii~g, always excepting his mare's ability and his own
riding.
" I'll go you a thousand any day, Miles Henderson,
on 'Geraldine,' against 'Sorella.' I know what- 'my
mare can do. But she wasn't groomed properly. That
little rascal Sam Perkins would give her w~t~r, though
I told him not; and lie girt her ~n so tightly, that the
poor thing could hardly draw a decent breath."
"And you're a little too heavy for your mare, Barry,"
added Nettles; 'who, having pocketed a clever share of
the money of the other, could afford to do the amiable.
"There's something in that," was the admission of
- Barry. "2But, Tom, didn't I ride her beautiful ?"
"You can ride," was the liberal acknowledgment of
the other, with just the sort of emphasis and look, in
the right place, to render the admission satisfactory.
Meanwhile, Henderson and Hammond had both been
conversing with the' ladies; though the latter could not
but perceive that Geraldine manifested, in his case,
a more than usual degree of reserve and distance. He

something of the kind, by sleight of hand.

"Ladies, indeed !" said the lady. "Perhaps so, sir.

"All ~'eady, ma'amn."
"Well,' Mr. Barry, ~re~ leave you. 'Mr. Nettles, we

you to think better of it, and stay for the circus ?'~~
"If one could be' sure that the clown ~wonld act ho-
nestly, and really make a gulp of his own head," mused
Hammond, with gravity.
Barry looked up bewildered, his mouth wide open, as
Nettles proceeded to. assert that the thing was really
done in a most lifelike and natural mannerr; though~ as
the clown reappeared always the next day with his head
on, looking quite as well as usual~ he concluded,~ with
his friend Barry, thatit was only "make believe," mere
sleight of hand or ~mouth, the cleVer trick ~of a clever

gravity, "it certainly takes in everybody-everybody

anxious to escape from the confiding, yet dubious gaze~
of Barry.
The carriage whirled away, Hammond and Hender-
son taking' opposite sides, the former beside 'the window
near which Geraldine sat, while his friend was thepar-
ticular escort~ of the mother. We will leave them on
their homeward progress,~and return to our companions,
Jones~ Barry and Tom Nettles.
These two worthies at ~on~e proceeded with proper
diligence to business~ Under the counsel of the latter,
Barry employed, as the rider of "Glaucus," the' little
gypsy, who had lifted "Sorella" so handsomely over
the track ~ and the result was an improvement in the
events of the contest. But it is not our purpose to
pursue the history of the turf at Hillabee. Ours is not
a racing calendar, and we must leave such histories to
those who are more perfect in the history of the stud.
It is enough that we say that the day continued one of
.great excitement to the close. Some small winnii~gs, at
the winding up, served somewhat to consoTh Barry for
his heavier losses; and he ~was rendered particularly
happy, as Torn Nettles introduced him to a 'couple
of the chief men of the circus, by 'whom he was in-
vited into the hippodrome itself, and permitted, while
yet the' day lasted, to behold the vacant scene upon
which such wonders were so' soon to be enacted. lie

but did not express his desire; as he felt that one who
was destined so shortly to swallow his own head might
very naturally desire tohave all the interval to himself,
that he might~ prepare himself for the' impending ~atas-
trophe. 'Here, ~a table being spread e~tempore, some
cold baked meats were brought forth from a' curtained
interior; and, with the help of a ham and a loaf, iyhich
Nettles gathered from the booths of on'e of his acquaint-
ance, and a stout quart-decanter of' French brandy,
which the equestrians h~d brought with them, Jones

ladies. The decanter was soon emptied and repler~isl~ed,
and thisin time disappearing, the place was occupied
by a couple of bottles of tolerable wino. Nettles was
fond of strong drink, but he bad oni~ of those indurated
heads which could bear* any degree of soaking without
betraying their owners. Jones I3arry was much less of
~t veteran, :though he loved good liquors, after a gentle-
manly fashion. J~nough, however, that, before he left
the table, he had become c4ptious and somewhat unruly;
and it was only by adroit management that Nettles
could conduct him' out of 'the taberuade, so ~as to afford
to the manager an opportunity for preparing for the
performance of the nights In the open air, Barry was
more manageable, though it required an additional 'sup~
ply of stimulus to keep his stomach from entire suhjii-.
gaiion to the hostile power which he had thrown into
the territory. Nettles was not unwilling to indulge
him.' lie was a fellow of fun, and found his capital in
this excellent subject. He had set out to enjoy a spree,
and he was resolved to make a night of it. An hour's
wandering about the encampment, f~r such had ~he race-
course at ilillabee become for the occasion, and there
were a thousand ways for getting up and' letting off
steam, to employ the slang phraseology, of the region.
Wagons were to be upset, drunk en men stripped, the tails
and manes of horses cropped; these, with other practices,
in which the humorists were quite as "rough as ready,"
'servedtobeguiletheinterval between thecloseofthe'
race and the opening of the circus. But it wa~ the
fortune of Jones Barry to make himself conspicuous.
in a more important enterprise. The wanderings of our
companions in search of adventures led them, with a
crowd of otjiers, to an amphitheatre, 4out three hun-
dred yards from the race-course, where they witnessed
a sport in progress, to which it seemed that all they
had hitherto beheld was mere ~childs-play, tame, and
spiritless. This was a" aander-pu~1ling !"
Reader, do ~you know what a gander-pulling is? If
you do not, it is quite as well that you should, form some

idea of the sources of pleasure to the purely vulgar and
u~jcultivated 'nature. Man is undoubtedly a beast, un-
less you, contrive some process for making him a gentle-
man; and there is no question but that,, as he has a
natural appetite for recreation and pleasure, if you do
not contrive for him such as will not be unacceptable to
the Deity, the devil ~will m6re liberally provide with
such as will make the man acceptable only to himself.
aander-pulling, accordingly, is one of those sports
which a cunning devil has contrived to gratify a human
beast It appeals to his skill, his agility, and strength;
and is therefore in some degree grateful to his pride:
but, as it exercises these qualities at the expense of his
humanity, it is only a medium by which his better qua-
lities are employed a~ agents for his worser nature.
Gander-pulling has been described as a sort of tourna-
ment on~ horseback; the only difference is that the
knight has a goose for his opponent, instead of a per-
son like himself. The man is mounted on horseback,
while the goose is mounted 'upon poles. ~These poles,
or saplings, are thrust firmly~ into the ground, some
twelve feet apart; but they are united' by a cord at the
top, which hangs loosely; while, pendent from the ex-
tremity, the living gander is fastened by the legs.
Here he swings his head; hanging downwards just above
the path, 'between the two~ saplings, and just high
enough to be within ~reach of the man on horseback.
The achievement of the rider is to run his horse; at fall
sj~'eed, at the 'bird, and, gr~spi~g~ him by the neck, to
wring his hea4 off as he passes on~ This is not so easy
a performance. The neck of the' gander has been pre-
viously stripped of; all its feathers, and has then been
thickly coated with grease or oil. Nothing can be made
~moro slippery; and, shining and warming in the sun,
the glitterhig ~neck of the unhappy bird looks like that
of a young boa, for the first ~time practising from the
bough, under which he expects the rabbit or the rat to
glide. To increase the difficulty of the exploit, and to
prevent any unfair delay in the approach of the assail-

on each side of the 'track, and at proper intervals.
These, as the 'horse approaches, lay their hickories, upon
'his flanks; and so unmercifully, as not only to make him
go headlong forward, but frequently to make him bolt
the track in order to escape such unfriendly treatment.

in twenty yards of the game. ' Thus guarded, the vic-
tim is not so easily decapitated. It is only the expe-
rienced horseman, and the experienced sportsman, who
can possibly succeed in the endeavor. Young beginners,
who look on the achievement as rather easy, are con-
stantly baffled; many find it 'impossible to keep' the
track; many lose the saddle, and, even where they suc-
ceed in passing beneath the saplings' without disaster,
they either fail altogether in grasping the goose, which
'keeps a constant fluttering and screaming; or, they find
it impossible to retain 'their grasp, at full speed, 'upon
the greasy and eel-like neck and head which they have
seized. Meantime, their failure is by no means sauce
for the gander. 'The tug,. from which he at 'length
escapes, makes him feel excessively uncomfortable while
it lasts. The oil without does not protect him' from~ se-
vere sore-throat within. ' His voice becomes hoarse, with
screaming; and, long before his head is fairly off, he
has lost those nicer sensibilities which teach him exactly
how the event took place. The beating and bolting; ~f
the horses, the emptying of the saddles, the failures of
the pullerss," the 'screams, and wild wixrg-flapping of
the bird-these constitute the glory of the entertain-

time in~ progress, when Nettles and Jones Barry drew
i~igh. The moment the latter beheld the scene, he at
once declared himself the man to. take the gander's head.
Nettles w~ very far from discouraging him from an ad-~
venture which promised fun; the more particularly as
his .companion, if not absolutely drunk, was, as they
phrase it in Mississippi, "in a state of betweenity,' 'i. e.
neither drimk nor sober. A dozen had already tried
their hands~ without success; but, evidently, to the per-
fect disquiet of the gander. There he swung aloft; his
wings flapping furiously at intervals, and., every now
and then, his throat pouring forth a sharp sudden scream,
the nioment he become conscious of a horse in motion.
Barry fixed his eyes upon the shining neck, and shook
his hands at the bird, the fingers spreading out, like
claws as lie pried to the victim: "Here's the claws
that'lJ have you off~ my beauty! You're shining there
for me! Who goes a JZ" against Jones Barry? Who, I
say? ]iiet him show himself, and be -
It is to the credit of Nettles that, though willing to
see the fun, he would not suffer his companion to be
fleeced. He interposed, that his bets should be trifles
only, though, in this friendly interposition, he incurred
the deni~nei~tions of the person whom he saved. Al-
ready had he paid for his "matriculation," and little
Logan White~ides was dispatched for "Glaucus ;" for,
though fuddled, Barry was not prepared to employ the
"Fair Geraldine," his favorite, for such ignohie pur-
poses.
"iLurrah for Jones Barry," said Ben Burg; "lie
ain't tQo proud to jin~ in the pleasures of the poor
man!'~'
"Lt'e's jest drunk enough for any sort of pleasure,
poor ar rich," was the comment of Lazy ~Jake Owens.
"I'll lay you a quarter, Jake," said Burg, "that
he'll take the, gander."
"That'll be because he's near kin to him, then."
"If he do~," said a third, "it'll be owing to his,
liquor, lie couldn't do it sober."

"Shall we go a quarter on him ?" said Burg'; a con-
scientious feeling prompting him to vindicate, to this
extent, the ability of a person from whom he had con-
trived to borrow a couple of half eagles but a few hours
before.
"Make it a half'~, Burg."
"D~o-n-e !" said the latter, ~rather slowly.
The vulgar look with respect, even while they sneer,
at the doings of those above them in 'fortune or position.
It was the fortune of Jones Barry to provoke a sensa-
tion always among this clasr~ of people. They watdied
and waited his movements. ,The gander obtained a
brief respite, while the boy went for "Glaueus".-..
settled down into, a droopii~g quiet, and hushed for a
period his screams. Our sprightly little gypsy was
not long before appearing with the horse. He was
ready saddled and bridled for the heat, and' it was with
more ambition than agility that our hero contrived to
vault into' the seat. Then it wa~ that the uproar grew.
~" Hurrah for Barry !" cried Nettles, at the top of his
voice.
"Who goes a picayune against'Barry ?"
"Done, with you, 'Squire Nettles."
"And here's another! lie's no niore the chap to take
off a gander's head than I am to put 'it on."
"Hurrah for .Lhe captain !" cried Burg.'
"You may hurrah till your throat aches, but that
goose will never catch that gander," was the unseemly
echo of Lazy sake Owi~ns.
A hundred 'voices joined in tlie s~iouting. The boys
rolled, and roared, and tumbled, throwing the dust up
fifty fee.t in air, as the knight of the goose prepared
to make his passage at arms. The men with the flails
did not need to use their hickories. J3arry came~ on at
full speed, and, amidst shouts of congratulation, he kept
his horse steadfast along the track, aiid through the sap~
lings, from whose united tops the gander was suspended.
The bird flounced and shrieked, flapping hi~ wingss With
immense violence. Barry, dropping his bridle in 'his

horse passed instantly from under him, and, for a mo-
zuant, he hung in air, the wings of ~the gander playing
the devil's tattoo rather rapidly upon his face, breast,
and shoulders. It was but for an instant, hoWever. The
cord, calculated to sustainn one goose only, broke under
de4de weight, and down came the pair together, the
gander uppermo~t~. Never' had snch p~ scene been wit-.
nessed before, ~w th~ whole annals of gander-pulling,

encounter and fall, to that when the parties were sepa-
rated, and chiefly upon the face of our hero. iRis cheeks

of ideas Which resulted from the twofold influence of
the cognac and the concussion.
"No,~ I think not," said he. "Goose, eh! Nettl~s;
we've had dinner." Such was the seemingly inconse-
quential reply; in which, however, Kettles detected the
latent meaning.
"Yes," said he, "and ate very heartily, both of us;
why should we want the goose ?"
"Shall we go, Tom'?" asked Barry, sobering by de~
grees, and feeling rather shain4a~ced.
"No !" said the other ; "here's Meredith's wagon.
He keeps good liquor; we'll take a consoler" And they
went aside together to the wagon, where they both ob-

and the two returned, to the gander-tournament together.
The game was already resumed and in full blast. Three
or four assailants had been baffled. IRut they usnailly
came up a second and a third time to the scratch. The
only discouraging circumstance which finally arrested
their efforts being the repeated. charges for new entries.
Th~e gander Was on~ of fortunate fates; his owner was
delighted to perceive that the.. instincts of the bii4d
enabled him to a~~icipate the moment of danger,. and to
exercise his most rapid movements, j~i~t as the grasp
was made upon his neck. He eluded several fingers;
but some clutched him,. and the "scrag" paid severely
from the jerk which followed, ev~n though it finally
slipped from the gripe of the enemy. But Ins voice
was suffering, and his action was greatly diminiske4~
It was then that Kettles found himself plucked by the

off that head thar, ef 'twas never done afore."
Nettles found it no ditlicult matter to persuade Barry,
and almost the next assailant of the goose was our
urchin. lie certainly looked less like one to "ease off
the head" than those who had 'preceded~ him. He
was the smallest of all the adventurers; rode squat, with
a stoop, doubling up. like a frog or monkey on the leap.
But if he lacked in size, he was possessed of rare agili-
ty. He was all wire and 'spring; and, a Thot not gene-~
rally known, he had been trained to the sport in another
county, and when much younger. His ability in riding
we have 'already seen. Nettles was a ju~lge of boys as

there were other customers for similar amounts. Net-

fate of the gander. It was not long in suspense.
Go ahead, Logan 1" was the cry of Nettles.
The boy obeyed him. The '.boys rushed after their
hero with a shout. He himself shouted, and the de-
scending flails of the men of hickory scarcely grazed
the haunches of the fleetly-hurrying "Glaucus." In a
moment, he had reached the foot of the scaffolding from
the top.. of which hung ~the victim. The bird uttered
tremendous screams, and flapped his wings wide and
heavily. Then' could the gypsy boy b&amp;seen to crouch,

CHAPTER IX.
HOW THE HERO OF THE CIRCUS MAY SWALLOW HIS OWN
OR HIS NEIGHBOR'S HEAD.
- ALTOGETHER, the events. of* the day had not tended
to soothe. the humors nor satisfy the self-esteem of Mr.
Jones Barry. The 'first excitement over, by which
even the defeated may be temporarily sustained, he
began to reflect~ upon his losses. His favorite mare had
been discredited; and though "Glaucus" had retrieved in
the sweepstakes the honor which he might have been
supposed to have forfeited in the first races, * this
could in no respect compensate for the defeat of the
' Fair Geraldine," coupled as was this defeat with the
loss of several "cool hundreds." It was in due degree
with the increasing soberness of Barry, that he began
thus moodily, to meditate events. The conflict with the
gander, which had left him with a head and neck quite
as sore as his moral feelings, had somewhat subdued his
vanity; and he really began to think, as people had
long since begun to say, behind his back, that he had
been making a great fool of himself. Reflections such as
these, were they allowed to continue, would probably
almost always result in the improvement of the indi-
vidual. But, in the case of weak persons, who have been
Nacdustomed to avoid and escape such reflections, and
whom fortune and circumstances enable to do so, ~t is
scarcely possible for such a mood of mind to continue long.
There are always some good-natured friends in every
fooPs circle, to 'assist in keeping him a fool; and, by
interposing at moments when self-esteem is beginning
to be rightly humbled, they succeed in silencing the
officious monitor, either by well'.sugared falsehoods and

specious flatteries, or by doing what, our excellent sports..
man, Tom Nettles, conceived it proper for him to do on
the present occasion.~ He saw, as the effects of theapple-
toddy subsided, that Jones Barry was about to sink into
sullenness, which he regarded as a sort Of stupidity; and
he knew but one specific in all such cases, and that
Was to repeat the dose which had been found already
so effectual; they stopped, accordingly, at a wagon on
which they saw co
barrel and were nspicuous a pine sa;pling above a
soon gratified with the beverage they
sought. The spirits of Barry rose with the draught.
The effect was so pleasant that another was called for,
and, by the time that the two had reached the entrance
of the hippodrome, our brave gander-puller avowed
himself as expert a rider on double horses as any fellow
in the circus.
"It's true I've never seen 'em,, Tom," said he, "but
I've heard of them often enough. Joe Smith used to
tell me of what he'd seen in Savannah and Augusta.
Now, Joe used to say of my riding, I was fit to be ii~
the circus. For a cool hundred now, I'd ride against
the crack fellow of this company, who, I suppose, is7 n~
great shakes, and by -, if they~ give me a chance
to-night, I'll challenge the whole kit and boiling 6f
em.
"Oh, you be k-----d, Barry," said the other, irre~re-
rently: "you are the greatest brag I ever heard. Ib@
yourself alone, and don't be trying to be everything.
You're quite enough as you are. You are a good-look-
ing little fellow."
"Little !". exclaimed Barry: "By gracious, Nettles,
I'm as good a man as you are, any day."
"So you are, but not as big !"
"Little! But I don't suppose you' meant any insult,
Nettles, for you said 'good-looking too.'"
"So I did! :1 say; you're a devilish good-looking
little fellow; you're rich; and have everything you
Want. You can ride, though you~'~e, quite too heavy

"Vet yow say I'm little."
"Yes, little and not light. You see, you're a sort
of chunk of a fellow, with more girth than legs, and a
beetle. too ambitious for your weight, Jones."
"You're iiiighty plain spoken, Tom."
"Why yes; friends have a privilege, you know."
".0 yes-fo be sure; but look you, Torn, I feel mon-
strous like licking the best friend in the world, when he
calls me little."
"Well, you don't lick me, for two' reasons; the first is,
that I won't let you, and the next is, that you won't let
yourself. But look you,. Jones, this is dry talking, and
I see you re in bad spirits; let's look after so~ne good ones.
There's a wagon there; I reckon we'll find something,
Let's take another drink, and we'll be fresh for the
circus."
"Agreed," said the other; and, as they rolled over
to the opposite side of the road, amid a confused assem~
blage of carts, carriages, and wagons, the unsteady
gait of Barry showed but too certainly that the apple-
toddy had been already too potent for his perpendicu-
lar.
"Ride!" said he. "By gracious, Tom, I could strad-
dle a barrel of peach, and make it streak away as fast
as them circus fellows make their horses."
~Humph! If you go on at this rate, your swallow
will be as good as the clown's, who means to take in his
own head,~ you know."
"And you, Tom, you a fellow of sense, 'to believe
that cock-and-a-bull story 1"

Ho! there, Gerdts-that you ?"
Nettles kneW the whole, country.
"What's left c~f ine,~ 'Squire. But what'll you have?
here's mountain-peach, and here's apple."
"The apple, then, witha bed of honey for it to dream
upon. I stick to the apple, Jones; I never mix my
liquors, if I can help it."
"What!" cried the other, with a grin; "afraid!

Tom Nettles; afraid of two liquors! h{alloo ! 'there, old
Gerdts, you don't know me~ never mind; give me both;
peach and apple; who's afraid? Equal parts, old still,
and no slow charcoal dropping. Ease my eye, quickly;
it's strained by the heavy sunshine."
Barry was becoming pleasantly perverse, and was
in the very humor for all sorts of cross purposes.
When conducted with some difficulty by hi~ friend,
they entered the amphitheatre where they had' taken
their dinner that day. The scene was now changed as
if by magic. The place was thoroughly lighted, a per-
fect\ blaze of splendor, which showed, conspicuously
clear, the remotest parts of th~ pavilion. The~ seats,.
which encircled three-fourths of the area, were o~ceupied
almost entirely. Our two friends were compelled to
take places on the lowest bench, and within a foot of
the small rim of earth which had been heaped up around
the ring, rather as a mark than a barrier. There w~s
no fence to keep the spectators from. the track, and to
check the erring vaultings of a. vicious horse 'and an
inferior rider. The seats were divided into two great
and equal sections, one assigned to the whites and the
other to the blacks. They were raised' (a rude scaffolding
of plank) to the 'very eVes of the tent, and the heads of
the visitors were in close neighborhood with the shaking
canvas., Hundreds of showy damsels, with ribbons
and feathers flying, might be seen, all impatience and
'sunny smiles, their several gallants being eager in d&amp;
scribing what they knew, and what they anticipated.
Many of these had come, a great distance to. the sports
of ilillabee; as, in ancient times, they flocked to the
amusements of the tournament; and for the same rea~
Son, the equal desire for recreation and niwelty, and
the want of great cities, which afford these habitually.
The dress circle was ~tninently well filled. The girls
and boys had crowded in from all parts of the country.
Ancient ladies, who had heard vague tidings of the cir-
cus, or had probably had glimpses of such a vision in
their youthful days, came hither to revive old memories,

or to gratify long-cherished desires. The old gentle-
men necessarily accompanied their wives and kindred.
The farmer was 'curious to see the reality of those spec-
tacles of which great pictures had already been made
to ack~rn. his hamlet, and jockeys naturally came wher-
ever the heroism. of ho~seflesh could be made to tell.
The negroes were not less curious. Hundreds were in
attendance, from all quarters. They had trudged or
trotted on foot, on xAule, in wagtrn; for ten or fifteen
miles the night before, to ~ee eights and wonders. ]~ach
wa~ in his best. Bright calicos flamed on every side,
to the very summit of their circumscribed domain;
and all was hope 'and expectation, as 'Jones Barry and
Tom Nettles made their appearance, and scrambled to
a seat.
'They were not kept in waiting long. The spectacle
soon began. Horses, pied and spotted, and of all
colors, made their' appearance. Children rode, women
rode, the~ 'clown rode, and it waS all sorts of riding. Of
course, we shall not pretend to describe t spectacle with
~whieh everybody is more or less familiar. Journeys to
Brentford, Gilpin's race, and several other pieces were
enacted.' The equestrians had their share of applause;
lint, after' all, the gloiy of the spectacle was in that
comical fellow, the clown. '~' Buried in a grotesque and
monstrous Egyptian mask, hi§ face thoroughly concealed~
and so artfully that its location could not exactly be de~
termined, his voice seemed to come from some vaulted
and Eollow apartment below the ground. JLLis antics
were~ inaescribable. His jugglery albne must demand
our attention, asit somewhat involved one of our acquaint-
ance. 'It happened that the scene required our clown
to' take wine with an African magician. He was me-
mently expecting him, and he was proceeding to show
the audience how he should bamboozle the magician, and
finally "swallow his soul."
"Swallow his soul 1" exclaimed Barry, in horror, to
N~ettles.

"He'll do it!" said the other, gravely. '~' You'll
see.
"Here, now," exclaimed the clown, "iS a brandy-
cocktail in which I've buried Mumbo-Jumbo's soul.
It's the most beautiful drink in the world; perhaps you'd
like to ~try it ?" said he, and he very courteously pre-
sented it to our two friends. Barry saw, as he fancied,
some of the fine cognac of which he had partaken freely
in that very place, on that very day; and, being exceed.
ingly thirsty, he innocently and incontinently ex-
claimed-
"I don't care if I do-thank you !" Speaking thus,'
he rose and put forth his hand; but, by an adroit move-
ment, throwing the long bunch of streamers- from his
fool's cap full in the face of our hero, the clown gulped
down the beverage himself, exclaiming-
"Perhaps you'll wait till you can get it !"
The audience roared with delight. Furious~ at his
disappointment, and the ridiculous figure 'which he cut,
Bari"y at once mounted the clown; and, at the first
grasp, tore away what seemed to be the entire head and
neek of the unfortunate jester. With this terrible evi-
dence in his clutches, he looked around him aghast,
scarcely daring to guess the extent of 'his achievement.
The clown, meanwhile, had retreated at the first 'assault,
and before Barry could recover his wits and equilibrium,
for he' could not well anticipate a renewal of the conflict
from one whose entire caput he carried in his hand, the
mountebank, squatting low, darted between the legs of
our hero; who had,' in some measure, straddled the little.
circuit of earth by which the ring was circumscribed.
The face of Barry was to the audience, and the' ass~u1t
of the clown surprised him. lie was lifted from his feet
before he apprehended danger; a~d his assailant, rising
under hi~ burden, which he did not seem 'to feel, trotted
with him quite 'across the arena. Barry 'was thus. car-
ried forward horizontally, his head addressh~g the white,
and his heels the negro portion, of the assembly.

could articulate, but he screamed and kicked tremen-
dously. 'His efforts were wasted on the air. The clown
had only attained his great flexibility by exercises which
had imparted~ thd, most wonderful power to his muscles,
and' Barry was but a child in his grasp. His 'struggle
only increased the fun. The audience shrieked and
howled with delight, in proportion to the futile efforts of
the captive ; and when they beheld the captor hurry
with his prey to the negro side of the house, and saw
him pitch the unfortunate gentleman headlong into the
arms of a great fat negro wench, one of the most enor-
ineus in the assembly, who sat trickling with oleaginous
sWeat, 'on the third tier, one would have thought the
whole pavilion would have come down with the delirious
shouts of the multitude.
"Here's an abolitionist for you, mother Possum-fat !"
cried the clown, as he plumped poor Barry into her
embrace.
"1 no want 'em I" cried the woman, shuffling herself
free from the burden. Barry, rolling out of her lap, con-
tinued to roll down the successiVe tiers, until h~ came
plump into the soft bed of sand and sawdust, which had
been prepared for a very different animal. Furious with
rage, h~ rose to his feet, and, seizing a pole with which
one of the equestrians had been balanciyig, he darted
headlong at the offending clown.
"Hurrah, red-jacket! Hurrah, clQwn !" were the
several cries of the audience. "Hurrah, Captain !"
was the more cordial shout of, recognition and encour-
agement from those who personally knew our hero:
"that's being into him with a long pole, indeed !"
But the clown had no idea of meeting such an enemy,
armed in such a fashion; and, eluding the tremendous
blow and thrust with which Barry addressed his ribs,
he vaulted clear over the shoulder of the latter and dis-
appeared behind the screen which sheltered the actor~
from the audience. His enemy thus out of sight, the
fiiriovts eh~1pioD proceeded to wreak his vengeance upon
K the inanimate objects around him. The ~scene in which

the clown was to have tricked the African magician
out of his soul was a most exquisite garden of Bagdad.
There were stands of beautiful flowers, vases of great
magnitude, statues, and several rich things by way of
ornament and decoration, which, seen through the me-
dium of distance, or by the aid of flickering lights,
* looked to be very precious. There ~was also a sort of
close bower, a framework draped with silk, in which
the cunning clown had placed a sleeping beauty. She
was not the smallest part of the temptations with which
the soul of the magician was to be entrapped. Barry,
with his pole, had already thrown down one or two of the
wooden flower~vases, with their precious contents, and
his~pole now descended upon the bower, which a~ single
stroke served to precipitate to the ground. To the sur-
prise of the assailant, not less than the assembly, up
sprang from the ruins a most beautifully dressed damsel;
young, pretty, and habited like a Sultana. It was for-
tunate, indeed, that the~ weight of the pole had not
fallen upon her. But it has grazed sufficiently close to
arouse all her fury; not Waiting an instant, she darted
upon oui?' hero, and, drawing the little stiletto which she
wore as a part of her Oiiental costume, he might have
been made to pay seriously for his frolic; for the rage
of the woman was apparent in her closely, set teeth and
her flre~gleaming eyes. But Barry seized her arm, ~~as
she struck, and dropping his pole stood only on the .de-
fensive~ The farce began to look greatly like tragedy.
The enraged woman now shrieked and struggled. fler
husband rushed out from the interior, armed with an
axe. The clown again made his appearance, followed'
by the whole troupe, each seizing whatever weapon oWered
as he came. There were sailors, and Turks, and magi-
cians, and~ even little Cupid's urchins, ;two~ feet high,
whom papa and mamma were thus assiduously training
in the way they should not go. These all confronted
our unlucky jockey with 'the most ~tincomprornising fury
in their looks,. 'Re had spoiled the proceedings, throwrL
the assembly into' the most admired disorder, and it wa~~

justice only that doomed him t6 a condign punishment.
I3nt, if they were formidable, Barry now no longer
stood alone. Tom Nettles was by his side, and the
long pole which Barry .had discarded Was in his grasp9
"Hillabee boys," he cried aloud, "bring out your
hickories!".
Twenty vigorous youngsters sprang out at the sum-
nions, and ranged themselves on the side of the ama-
teurs. Great clubs of knotted hickories were already
flourishing high; and, forgetting his ia~te danger, Jones
Barry already felt that he was a hero. He still main-
~tained his grasp upon the 'Sultana, and seemed disposed
to carry her oW as the captive to his bow and spear,
when the cool voice of Nettles commanded him to let
her go. He did so; and the sleeping beauty, now wide
awake, darted into the arms of the magician, who was
her husband,.upon whose bosom she sobbed convulsively,
as ata providential escape from~a great danger. Thus
the parties stood, i-confronting ~each other.; both looking
firm and fierce enough, and threatening trouble. Not
only did the "whole troupe of equestrians range them-
selves for hat'tle under the' leadership of ~he clown, but
'one of the horses coolly marched in, covered with
panoply, and, thrusting his head over that worthy's
shoulder,' seemed to promise him sufficient hacking, and
in truth looked very formidable. lilt was a scene; the
clown, as a matter of course, opposed himself to Barry,
who, armed with a pole, looked aghast at the twofold
conflict before him, in the threatening aspect of both
horse and rider. But Nettles fortunately knew Ahe head
meii of tlie~ company. lie said-
~"My friends~ this is altogether a mistake, which I
easily explain, and, I trust, easily reconcile. There's
no fun infighting, though we're by no means afraid, as
you may' see, to meet any number of men or horses.

the gentlemen of the ci~cu~ will 'go on with their exer.
cises as before. In the, mean time,. Mr. Barry' and my~
self will retire with the manager 'here, and we'll adjust
the difficulty in private together." A suggestion so
politic was acceptable to all parties, though, onee on the
ground, the iillabee boys did not relish the idea of, re-
turning without having done something glorious 'by way
~of showing how well their destructive faculties had been
developedd. Barry was a little scrupulous about entering
the mysterious sanctum to which the' clown and, the Sub
tana had retired, but, having great confidence in Nettles,
and being assured by the great coolness and confidence
of the latter, h~ followed him and the manager into the
place of retreat., Here he found himself amidst a motley
group. Horses- were staring them in the face on all
hands. Some of the equestrians were already mounted~
Here, in one corner was a trunk and box;' there a~ table
and chair; and there a chest;~ and there a 'bundle; and
there the uniform of a giant;' and there the dozen
masks and jackets of the clown. There, to~, re~
covered from~ the dust and danger of the arena, ~was
the unlucky colossal, mask. and headdress which our
hero had torn 9ff from his enemy at the first encounter.
Nettles walked in with the air of a man perfectly at
home.
"And now," said he, "IDiavolo," agdre~sing the
clown, "let us begin the work of peace, as you begun
the war. Prepare us one of those excellent brand
cocktails with which you tempted toy friend to despe..
ration. 'Had you known the diabolical thirst that's
been troubling both of' ~us the last three hours, you'd
have known' 'twa~ quite as much as your. head was
worth to mock us with 'aiiything half so delightful.
Quick, now; and let there fre peace' between us' I"'
The arrangement promised to be satisfactpry to all
parties. The cocktails were~ speedily prepared; pre-
pared in a' nice-looking, brass-bouiid bucket, of diinen.

shaken; eyes 'glistened and,' with the consent of the
r~agician, his lovely Sultana freely bestowed the' kiss of
peace upon our hero'. Th~ example was gratuitously
followed by the clown, whose embra,.ce and, salutation
were distinctly stamped ~pon the front of Barry, in
unequal decorations of verxiiiUon and buri~t cork. 1Their
embraces' ~eemed to affect the dextrous Torn Nettles
with a serious delight.
+f' How beautiful," said he, " is it to 1~ehold' brethren
thus dwelling in amity together! What a spectacle!
It is necessary that the audience should see it; that
they~ should see that this is, no mockery; but that the
foes' have freely exchanged forgiveness. 'Another
draught from         t,. gentlemen," said he, address~
ing )~arry' and the clown, "'and then go forth that the
* people may witness those~beautiful 'embraces.
Rarry had no scruples about the dram, but he. rather
~hung back at the prQposal ~for the' embrace in public.
His 'reluctance disappeared with the draught. He
swore that Diavolo was the best fellow in the world,
and made the finest cocktails; and, with an arm about
eaph other's waist, each bearing a cocktail in liatid, they
enwrged from th~ canopy into the' area, and drank to
each ~ther, and th~ audience. If war exulted 'in the
previous sA~ene, philanthropy was proportionally happy
now. The audience were ravished. The old ladies
wept. The 'old men thought it just as well,; and the
negrpes were perfectly well satisfied; wondering only a
little 'to behold.a man drinking with such~ 'a capacious
swallow, who had so,~recently been deprived of his head.
~All, seemed' perfectly well satisfied but young iillabee,
f1~om\whQxn, some' discorda1r~t hisses were heard t'o yise,
whulei' the unemployed hfckories were made to 'clatter
'a~ainst~ the sides of the benches.' ~i.
"'There's a drop yet in the bucket,'. whispered the
cloii to his new comrade. The hint was not lost upon
]~arry~, He returned to the sanctum, where he found
'his friend: Tom Nettles. There thpy remained till the
perfornnrieeswere ovei',~nd the c~owd'departed~; when

they were invited to a hot supper with 'the~ t~oup~; in
the great area of the pavilion. The invitation was not
to be disregarded. The equestrians lived well;, and
Barry and his' friend were both hungry. But, were it
not so, the wishes of the 'latter would. scarcely have had
any weight upon our delighted hero. He kad been the
hero of the night, though after a ~ornewhat~ doubtful
fashion,. it is true.; hut he had been. conspicuous,. and
had come out of the scene with applause. Of course7
he could not doubt that it was his appearance which
was so warmly welcomed when he had come forth in
the embraces of the clowns The~ clapping and shouting
seemed to him the most grateful sounds' to which he
had ever listened; and the brandy cocktails were, the
most delicious of mortal beverages. It was a night of glo-
rification. The supper-table was spread. His friend was
placed on one side of the manager; he occupied the
other. Beside him, sat the lovely wife of the magician,
whose graciousness never even provoked the frowns of
her mysterious lord. At first, Jones Barry felt a little
squeamish on this subject. When she gazed so tenderly
in his eyes, and suffered her finger to rest so impres..
sively on his 'wrist, ~he felt a dubhrnsness, and looked ~
his doubts at the husband. But he knew not the indif-
ference of professional magic to those mortal subjects.'
The latter saw everything without'~ discomposure; and,,
after a little turn of hesitation and doubt, our hero de-
'livered himself up, soul and body, to all the intoxica-
tion of a conviction that he had won the heart of this
most beautiful of all the creatures of Faery. They
'drank together,, and whispered together. The hours
waxed late.' Barry sang a comic song, at the instance
of Nettles, and, at the conclusion, was more delighted
than astounded; as his' Sulana, throwing her arms
about his neck, and seating herself in his lap, in the
face of all the assembly, called him the finest little f'el-
low in the world. He did not know how he. should re-'
compense such 'devotion, but by forcing a great ring from'
his upon her finger. She coyly' suffered him, in a mo~

ment after, to transfer the diamond breastpin from his
to herbosom. He put it there himself; and all this
the magician saw without seeming to regard it as in any
wtse improper. The next morning, Barry found him-
self where he had supped, sleeping upon one of the
benches, with a bundle of straw under his head, and
one of the horse-cloths, green and scarlet, spread above
his body. Tom Nettles, as he opened his byes, was to
be -seen standing with the manager at ~a little distance,
and mixing a couple of rosy anti-fogmatics.
.1'

CHAPTER X.
THE HUMORS OF THE CIRCUS.
BARRY was not the man to suffer from headaches;
but his stomachh was one that needed to be fortified by
tonics. The sight of his friend, when he discovered the
occupation in which he was engaged, fully arcaised him.
He was on his feet in an instant, jerking up his trousers,
and approaching Nettles with the haste of a person who
fears that he may come too late. But there were some
particulars in which Nettles never abandoned his com~
panion. He was emphatically what young people call
"a good. fellow," and good fellowship implies the neces-
sity of assisting your friend and facilitating his ready
attainment of all desirable indulgences. In making an,~
anti-fogmatic for himself, he had not forgotten his com-
rade. There was a huge vessel before him, where the
beverage stood in waiting, and Tom, Jones Barry,- and
the manager of the amphitheatre, were soon engaged in
a hob-a-nobbing match that didn't stop at a single stoop.
Barry declared himself quite happy. He had enjoyed
a pleasant dream of the magician's wife, and he natu-
rally inquired after her.
"Look in," said Tom ~Nettles, with a smirk to the
manager which Barry did not perceive, while he point-
ed the latter to the sanctum where the reconciliation
had taken place the night before. Without a moment's
hesitation, our little h~ro followed the finger, and found
himself in the lady's dressing4oom, he~ toilet only her.
gun, and ~he, in the most loose undress in the world,
employed before the broken mirror which hung from one
of the uprights of the tent. Barry was astounded,
and would have started back; but she saw him in the -


ISO         AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,

glass, and, wheeling round, at once summoned him,
though in the very sweetest accents, to approach.
"You are just in time," said she; "I wanted some-
body to lace my jackets.
"Jackets 1" exclaimed Barry, aghast.
"Yes, to be sure! Come now, you're a nice little
fellow, I know. Let me 'see-you have small fingers.
Show yourself diligent, and help me to fix myself.
That man of mine never gives me any assistance.
There he sleeps. Look at him. He will snore till noon,
and never fairly wakens till it's time to dres~'for the
performance."
She pointed to the end of a wagon that appeared
under a corner of the* tent, from which, sure enough,
the ears of ~Barry detected a very decided snore. But
thi~ did' not encourage him. He was utterly astounded
at the new duty required at his hands. In all his ex-
perience, he had never before laced a woman's corsets
-or unlaced them; and he scarcely knew how to under-
~'tand the Sultana. But seeing his hesitation, Sultana-
like, she stamped her little foot, and repeated her orders.
She did not leave' him long doubtful that she was in
earnest.
"Come," ~aidNshe, "what do you wait for?' Is it
because ,you're bashful? Well! at ~o~r age!; But you
needn't be, here! We know a thing or two! we've no false
modesty heri~, I assure you. A leg's a leg, with us. We
talk plainly, and are not the worse for it. We don't
make a fuss about shadows as long as we keep the sub-
stance; and indeed, it's only those who have lost the sub-
stance that do. Come, stir yourself, and there's a kiss
to begin with, by way of recompense.
A few momei ts found our hero awkwardly busy with
the waist of the Sultana. While thus engaged, the
manager and Tom Nettles came in.
~' That woman,'~ said the manager aloud, "has tire&amp;
out every member ' of ~the troupe in lacing her. She
will have her waist brought within the narrowest com-
pass, and she breaks her cords daily in trying to make it

smaller. There's not a hand among us that she has
not made sfre in the abominable work, and now she
takes to our visitors."
"And why not ?" said the Sultana, with the air of the
orient~ "Is he not rewarded? It- is not often he is
permitted. to study a good model." .
"A little too round, madame," said the manager.
"Too round !" screamed the Sultana.
"Not a bit," said Tom Nettles, coolly interposing to
span th~ waist. "An exquisite union of symmetry and
strength."
"Strength !" demanded madame.
"Yes, to be sure; strength is necessary to grace, even
in a woman. It's the mistake of too many of the 8ex
that an air of feebleness is supposed to imply delicacy.
It is rather the reverse. II wish to see vigor with grace-;
and a woman ought to seem as capable of a fine wrestle
as of a fine sentiment."
"I've a great mind to trip your heels for that," said
the Sultana, pertly.
"And if I am to take a fall, I should wish for. no
worse embrace than yours. But I lea~~e Barry to the
danger. He's a better wrestler than myself', and it
strikes me that his lacing begins to look much more like

Barry blushed to the roots of his hair.

takes a woman's name in vain! Do some of you give
him his dram, his phlegm-cutter, his antifogmatic, o~
whatever else lie calls it, that he may sober himself to a
civil way of speaking."
"Ay, Nell, bring it yourself."
The wife ~eized a tumbler that stood on a chest beside
her, and held it to Nettles, who filled it from the flagon
whjch had been brought in by the manager. She darted
away the nest moment to her, magician, without seeming
to remember that Barry, who, in his clumsiness, was
still busy. at the strings of her bodice, was compelled
to follow after her, or lose the ends of the cord which
had been confided to hi~ care.
"There~ you!" she cried, thrusting the drink into his
clutches.
"Jsn't~ she a beauty ?" said the magician, with a leer
to Barry, as he took the liquor. Barry could only
smile and simper,. and look silly.
"Beauty !" said she; "too much of a beauty for you.
That's thewayhe flatters a woman, with Beauty! Beauty!
on his lips, said half-asleep, and his mouth opening 'on
the ~quart-poV, which alone made him waken up. You
don't talk of my beauties now, but you feel them."
"Yes, indeed," said Nettles, "and he'll stay feeling
them all day if you'll let him."
"Oh, Tom!" murmured Barry with a grin.
"Don't you mind him," said the Sultana. "Have
you done new. There !" she exclaimed, wheeling about
and grasping the unsuspecting Barry in her arms, giv-
ing 1dm an embrace, before releasing him, that half took
away his breath. "There, that's your reward. lit isn't
often a fine woman bestow~a scjueeze upon hersweetheart,
and IL only do. it now to show you what your friend
~neanswheii lie says that the beauty of a woman means
vigor as well~ aa grace. If you'd like, to try the wrestle
after the squeeze, say the word, and I'm ready for you.
"And I'll go a hundred on Nell against the field,"
cried the husband, from~the wagon.

"Oh, beast there, with your' Nell," cried the heroine,
indignantly. "I've done everything, I've even thrashed
him, to teach him good manners, but it's so much love
and labor thrown away."
"But how about the wrestle? Who t~kes me up ?"
demanded the husband. The Sultana herself looked
'about her with the eye of a challenger. She was still
only dressed in part, and her fine bust and figure af-
forded not a bad idea of Ole~patra. Her breasts seemed
breaking through the very partial restraints upon 'them,
and her arms, partly bare, were adniirably white and
rounded, revealing that equal union of muscular and
flesh development which crowns the person with
strength, without lessening its beauty.-. By this time,
however, the admiration of Jones Barry had in some
degree given way to misgivings and apprehension. His
sense of the beauty of the woman was somewhat im-
paired by his disquiet at her boldness. The privileges
to which he had been admitted had certainly shown no
warmth or feeling ~n her part, and, in fact, she' had
treated him rather like a boy than a man. He was'
awed and abashed, by her manners, rather than de-
lighted with her charms; and the single squeeze which
she had so gratuitously bestowed upon him was quite
sufficient to satisfy him, without desiring the wrestle.
He accordingly ~aid~ nothing, while Nettles, with exem-
plary 'coolness, quietly remarked that "he, perhaps,
should have no serious objection to the trial, could he
be sure of fair play, but as he had never found that
from a woman yet, he was not disposed to incur any un~..
necessary risk "
By this time one of the subordinates made his ap-
pearance, announcing breakfast in the amphitheatre..
Nettles gallantly assisted the lady in completing her
toilet, and this affair adjusted, he gave her his army
and conducted her into the temple.. He was fiAlewed
by Barry, who felt nothing hut envy at~ th~ ease and
readiness with which his friend performed the duties of'
the courtier. The" equestrians played the part of ho5ts

with great liberality and good-humor, and the meal lin.
geared for more than an hour, in which, while the cates
were various and ample, they constituted hut a minor
portion of the attraction. The coolness, readiness,
great resource, experience, and anecdote of these per-
formers furnished an unfailing subject of wonder to
Barry. They seemed to know' everything about the
world, and some of them seemed quite at home on the
subject of books. Zerlina, our Sultana, or "Nell," as
the magician, her husband, persisted' in calling her,
was quite a dabbler literature. She was read in the
dramatic poets~ and had an ambition for the stage,
which some mysterious influence prevented her from
seeking to gratify. She made frequent exhibitions, at
the entreaty of Nettles, of her pow ers, while reading
favorite passages, and thus increased the degree of awe
and admiration which Barry already entertained for
he~r. Her civiliti'es were somewhat less free than they
had been the night before, but they were still such as
a matronmight readily bestow upon a moderately grown
boy. Poor Barry, though pleased with much of this
sort of petting, was yet humbled by it! and it was with
something of a feeling of relief that he received a hint
from 'Nettles that it was time to depart. The troupe
were to exhibit another night at ilillabee, as the mul-
titude, though diminished, was still sufficiently large to
compensate the performance. There were extemporary
races throughout the day, but generally with common
horses. To these neither Barry nor Nettles greatly
inclined, and their;separation from their hosts of the hip-
podrome was pretty much a leave-taking of the field.
Nettles had known the manager, the magician, and the
fair~Zerlina, some time before, and they parted as old
friends. The Sultana' squeezed Barry's hands with a
frank earnes4fless, as she bad&amp;him good-by, telling him
he was a nice fellow, and she should always remember
him by his gifts, pointi~ig to his ring and breastpin.
was with a twInge that our hero heard this speech.
He thought sulkily of the half-maudlin tendei'ness of

the. night before, in .w~tich he had heen beguiled of
jewels that he would - prefer to see on very different
fingers. The thoughts of Nettles, in some degree, took
the same direction with his own. As they rode together'
homeward, and when~they had fairly emerged from con-
tact with the multitude, the former, with a quizzical
smile, said to Barry-
"I say, Jones, what the d-l would your sweetheart,
the fair Geraldine, have said, could sh~ have seen
you sitting in the lap of our INelly, eh?"
"I didn't sit in her lap, Tom; she sat in mine.
"So much the better for the sight! What would
she have said, or what could you have said, had she
suddenly plumped in upon you when Nelly was in your
lap, her arm about your neck, and giving you that smack
of the lips, which seemed to you like twine from heaven?
You got drunk almost instantly after it. You hugged
her like a hero, until she' couldn't stand it any longer,
and broke away, as if she feared some harm~frona her
magician husband."
"Oh! I didn't, Tom. Now don't you be telling' that
nonsense about."
"flow can I help it, Jones, my good fellow? The
joke is quite too good to be lost. For the one smack,
the moment you had tasted it, you gave her *a dozen,
till she gave in and cried "nough! 'nough!' as fervently
as the fellow whose sockets are filling fast with sand
from his enemy's fingers; and such a squeeze about the
body that she fairly heaved again, though pretty well
used to tight bracing."
"Never, Tom; never
"But it's a true bill, Jones. Then, you sung a co-
mic song; and, in trying to get on the table for a Vir-
ginny reel, you slipped over into the sawdust, an'd 'lay
there with a gurgle in your throat, as if you were try-
ing to drink and sing at the same moment. You don't
know, I suppose, who laid you out upon the benches?"
"No, Tom, Ii don't."

"I'll swear it! You did! ~2Vones, I'm afraid you're

that will prevent me from interfering, and that is-"
He paused.
"Eh! What?"

"That there's no sort of use for it, as there's no sort
of danger that she'll ever marry you.~~
"And why not, I wonder ?"
"Why not! When you prefer to stay here at a
horserace, to seeing her home. When you let her go
off under the escort of your rivals, while you go a gan-

than her company; and when, not content with the
performances of other people, you take another man's

lived-"
"No, I'll be k----d if I did."
"And I'll be k-------d if you didn't !" responded the
tormentor.
"Tom, by the blazes, you're no friend of mine, or
you wouldn't talk so. But, I know you of old. You
only do it to worry me. You won't blab."
"Well, suppose I don't? What chance do you stand
with the fair Geraldine when you neglect her so, and
when you have such chaps as Ran. Hammond and Miles
Henderson against you?"
"I don't care a curse for Hammond. She shows him
less favor than all the rest. She's cross to him; and,
for that matter,, it don't seem to me that he cares a
curse for her."

"Well! let him come. It costs nothing, and it comes
to nothing. She don't care for him."
"I'm not so sure of that !''

Mrs. Foster brooded over other schemes for 'fomenting
anew the displeasure of her step-daughter.
"Foster Lodge" was. a place of considerable beauty.
The immediate approach to it was through a broad
avenue, itearly a mile in length, guarded and overshad~
owed from each side by the sta1~eliest elms~ and oaks.
The dwelling stoodnpon a genfle eminence, with a broad
and sweet1y~sloping. lawn of green on each side' of the
avenue, extending nearly to the public road. The
house ~was half shaded by great trees, a modest dwell-
ing of two stories, with a piazza 'fronting' the avenue,
the~ roof of which, concealed by a parapet, was sustained
by six great columns, tht4 rose upmajestically from the
basement~to the upper story.
Dinner was in waiting when the parties arrived.
11am and turkey smoked ~upon the board, and there
were birds. and fowl, 'eggs and milk, &amp;nd the usud va-
riety of vegetables, so certain to be found in ally good
farmsteads. Mrs. Foster was an economist. She 'was
a; farmer's daughter; a poor' one too; and had been
early taught in lessons Qf thrift and painstaking. These
~he had not Lorgottenin her improved fortunes. in-
deed, they were her virtues. Her estates thrived~ in
her hands; and, if not' a good tutor for the daughter,
she was a very good nurse of her property. ~This was
ample, if' not~ large. It wasp the misfortune of Mrs.
Foster that, she did' not esteem it ample. This was one
of her reasons for preferring' Jones Barry to either of
her present guests. 'The fact of his greater wealth, and
"   that~ feebler 'character ~hich made him subservient to
',   Mrs~. Foster's humors, were the chief sources 'of that.
favor'Which he had found in the good lady's sight.
Dinner' passed off' pleasantly.' Hammond continued
in the same ~humor which 'had accompanied him from
the race-course. II~yen Mrs. Foster, herself, was 'some-
~times compelled to'smile at his 'sallies; and' when she
did not,' it 'was only from the annoying conviction that
they were rapidly 'undoing all her work. lIt was night
befQI~e the party rose from table,~ and a short interval

was afforded for promenading in. thQ piazza, before t~a
was set. This was tWiowed by, music. Gcraldine &amp;an~

"But why.ndt stay all night?" wa&amp;. the fr~an~ 'dew

inquiry to Henderson. The latter looked to Harnm~ind

CHAPTER XII.
TOUGHNESS OF THE TENDER GENDER.

WE must skip, without notice, the events of several
weeks, in which but little apparent prQgress was made
on any hand. The parties met frequently, now at
church, now at evening assemblages~~of friends and still,
as before, very frequently at the dwelling of 'our hero-"
me. Randall Hammond eontinue4~ his policy, though
with a misgiving, which gradually increased with the
increase of his passion; and an eye less anxious, and ~
mind less excitable than that of Geraldine's, would have
readily detected, at particular moments, the proofs~ of
this strengthening interest. But what with her own
feelings engaged in the issue, and the continued an4
perverse hostility of Mrs. Foster 'to the claims of our
hero, she was kept in the same dogged mood towards
him in which we have beheld, her while 'taking the
strange vow' recorded, in the preceding chapter.. He
saw and felt the influence, but was without any means
to meet and to contend with it; unless by the exercise
of the same patience which he had hitherto displayed,
and the unwearied exhibition of those talents and '~e~
source's which had rendered him still agreeable in her
eyes in the teeth of all her prejudices. His mother, it,
may be mentioned in this place, had expressed h~r
doubts of the propriety of his seeking in marriage the
hand of Geraldine Foster. Of the young lady~herself,'
~the venerable dame knew nothing, except from hearsay;
and rumor rather exaggerated defects than acknowledged
virtues. The objections of Mrs. Hammond lay' tQ the
step-mother, whom she knew as a pert housekeeper em~
played in a neighboring family, when she wasproirioted

by Foster, then sinking with ai feeble constitution, and
"equally feeble mind, into imbecility. She regarded
her influence over the stepdaughter as vicious and dan-
gerous, and, whatever might be the individual endow-
ments of the girl, she insisted upon their abuse and per-,
version in the hands of such a guardi~in. We have seen
that she is' right in some measure; but she overrated
the influence of the one, and underrated the powers of
resistance of the other.. The girl, in reality, in many
'respects, controlled the won~an. The latter, conscious
of low birth~ and 'inferior education, though naturally
clever, was submissive to the daughter in most social
respects; and it was only where the latter was necessa-
rily diffident, as in the case of her affections, that she
exercised~ any influence over her sufficiently powerful
to baffle 'the impulses of her own judgment. In affairs
of the heart, or, rather, where young persons are called
upon to decide between two or more faVorites, the adroit'
suggestions of third" parties hav0 always more or less
weight. The mind distrusts itself but too frequently
whei~ the affections, are busy with its decisions; and it is
because of this fact, that we find so many of that perni-
cious class called match-makers in the world. They
interpose when the will of the interested person is at
fault. They profess friendship, and it is at, such a time
i~hat the poor heart longs for such a succor. They in-
sinuate doubts, or suggest motives,~ and determine the
scales, for or against a party, by 'such arguments or in-
nuendoes as are most likely to influence the feeble nature
which relies upon. them. Mrs. Foster's hold upon Ge-
raldine, in this matter, lay in the morbidly active pride
of the damsel. This she contrived to goad and irritate
by ~daily 8t~ggestionS, in which the most innocent move-
ments of! Hammond were perverted. ~The fear of Mrs.
JJammond,'~with regard to her influence upon Miss Fos-
ter, went still farther. She dreaded lest she should
govern her in all respects; lest she should have tutored
all her moods and feelings 'by the low moral standards
by which the ' step-mother~ herself 'was influenced; and

TILE TEN~ESSRflA~'S STOltY.      169
have made her equally selfish and presumptuous with
herself; coarse in her aims, narrow in her opinions;
jealous of the worth which she never sought to eiwilate;
and ambitious of society, not for its real advantages of
mutual training and attrition, but for its silly dispTh~ys
and petty ostentatious.
We need not repeat that, in these apprehensions, Mrs.
Hammond labored under error; but she did not the less
entertain them. A long and serious conversation with
her son, the day after his return from the races at Hil-
labee, was devoted to this subject. Tn this conversation,
she freely declared her objections to the n~iatch with such
a person, related all that she had 'heard of Geraldine,
and told her son all that she knew of the step-mother,
concluding with an earnest entreaty that he would lodk
in some other quarter for the exercise of his affections.
She was even good enough to mention the names of two
or three young' ladies of their acquaintance, whose
charms were considerable, and against whom there lay
no such objections as she entertained for Miss Foster.
But the son, though grateful for this counsel, as frankly
told his mother that it fell upon unheeding senses; that
he was really and deeply attached 'to Geraldine,; that
he was not blind to her faults, ~nd knew her 't6 be
equally proud and eccentric; but her pride, he said,
arose from a high spirit, sensible only of right purposes,
and her eccentricities were the growth of a superior
'intellect, under an 'irregular education, and were due in
some degree to a consciousness of independence,' falsely
founded, perhaps, of the circle in which she moved.
Like other lovers, Hammond expressed the opinion that
her eccentricities would. certainlyy be cured by marriage,
particularly under the admirable domestic system which
he was prepared to establish. For the s~tep-mother, he
had nothing to say. He had certainly ~no defence to
offer. She was pretty much the woman that hi~ mother
had described her. Besides, she was evidently hostile&amp;
to himself. But her' influence over her step-daughter
was nothing. If' exercised in any way, it was, only iii

opposition. to himself', and he could readily understand
how she might operate successfully .by artifices, pa~rticu-
larly in dealing with' a person who was herself truthful
and unsuspicious, where, she might never attain any in-.
fluence t~y open authority. lie continued, by repeating
the assurance to his mother that he felt too much in-
terested in the lady to forego his attentions, but that he
should watch her conduct narrowly, and not risk his peace
upon any object to whom such objections could apply
as those which she had urged. lie concluded by ex-
pressing his desire that his mother would visit Mrs.
Foster, and see the young lady for herself. There was
no good reason why she should not do so. it is true
she did not like Mrs. Foster, but if people, visited only
those whom they liked, society would be almost empty
of individuals. Mrs. Foster had called upon her, and
had invited her to her ho~ise. True, she might remem-
ber her as a pert housekeeper, but she was now a house-
holder ; .and if pert in this capacity, it was a fault which
could be charged upon a thousand others. At all events
Mrs. Foster was no worse than her neighbors, so far as
the world was permitted to see. And to recognize her
as everybody else 'did, would in no degree impair the
ancient position which Mrs. Hammond held in the pub-
lic esteem. If any other reason were wanting, it was
undoubtedly to be found in the probability of her son
establishing an alliance' with this very family, when,
as a matter of course, all difference of relative position
must be overthrown forever.
The worthy old lady sighed as she acknowledged the
truth of these reasoning, and prepared to submit to
them._~At an early day her' carriage was ordered, and
Mrs. Foster *was confounded when she heard that the
equipage of the stately old lady was in 'progress u~ the
avenue. This was a triumph to her vanity which would
have been eminently grai4fied, but that it seemed to
operate against her project of marrying her daughter to
Barry. One of her. favorite topics of denunciation,
where Hammond. was concerned, was his own and his

mother's arrogance; ~and the rt~glect of the' latter to
return her visits was an argument for, the truth of her
assertions. I3ut neither Geraldine nor herself was in-
sensible to the compliment paid by this visit. Mrs.
Hammond was at the very head of society in that .iieigh..'
boyhood. 11cr position was unquestionable. Hers was
one of the oldest families; i~nd the dignity which she
maintained, along with the virtues of benevolence and
hospitality.-.-.to speak of ho other of the Christian ~hari-
ties-all of which were eminently conceded to her, ren-
dered her quite as much beloved as respected. it had
been rather injurious to Mrs. Foster's pretensions in
society, that Mrs. Hammond had not recognized them.
TIiat she did so now, at this late, day, was undoubtedly
something gained ; but the perverse pride in her heart
prompted a feeling of resentment at the visit so long
deferred, and she suddenly exclaimed to Geraldine-.-~
"We won't see her. She has taken her time about it,
and we will take ours. Let Ch~ra go and tell 'her we
are not at home.''
"No, indeed, mother! that won't d~. You will gain
nothing by it; for people will only say~ you. hate done
it for spite. Mrs. Hammond is not a woman to be
slighted. However we may feel her neglect of us, she
is a lady of worth and character; and I can't thitik of
showing her 'any resentment. Besides, I feel none. I'
remember her when she used to visit my own dear 'mo-
thor, though I was but a child; and I have' heard father
speak of her as his friend, when he needed, friendship.
Indeed, I have heard that she lent him a large sum of
money to save his mills; and, in 'the settlement of' the
afthirs of the estate with Lawyer Griffin, I see the re~
payment only took place the year before my father died~
No! she has had some reason, I suppose,. for keeping
away, and that' she comes now shows that these reasons
exist no longer. We must see her. I feel nothing but
respect for' Mrs. Hammond."
This was said in a way to silence opposition. But
the step-mother had the last word, framed in a fashion

that she had been too much accustomed to employ of
late to forego very readily.
"It's just as you will, my dear. You have very
good reasons for what you say ;~but I rather think that
ifyour heart did not incline so much to seeing the son,
your reasons wouldn't be half so good for seeing the
mother. Take care now.; I see what's coming. You
will be overawed by the consequential old woman, until
you submit~to the consequentitd young man, and then
good-by to all your freedom. I know you, Geraldine
Fos1~er; you'll be imposed upon by the high heads of
these people,. until you forget all your resolutions."
"And I tell you, mother~, that' you know nothing
about~ Geraldine Foster, if you think she is to be im-
posed upon by a~nybody. I am-"
"Well, hush now, before the old witch hears you.
She's coming into the parlor now."
Geraldine muttered something about the improper
use of the epithet old witch, and Mrs. Foster sniggered
at the rebuke. The affairs of the toilet proceeded in
silence,~ and the daughter was the first who was ready
to descend.
"She shall wait for me," said the mother, proceeding
very leisurely. Geraldine left the room, and descended
to th~ parlor. She felt a little awe, certainly~ as she
entered the rotm and encountered the tall, stately form
of the venerable woman, with her dark dress, and her
formal mob cap. But the benevolent manner, and the
sweet tones of tjie old lady's voice reassured her.
"I know you, my child, by your dear mother. She
was my intimate friend. She Was a kind and loving
person. You have her eyes and. mouth. Your fore-
head and nose are your father's, and you are tall, like
your father also. Your. mother was rather short, but
she ~as so ~reli made that she did not seem so, unless
when standing close to others. If you have her heart,
my child, as you certainly have all her beauty.-"
The old lady squeezed the hands of the girl,, but
failed to see the humid witnesses which were gathering

* in her eyes. Those of the speaker were already wet.
The sympathies of the two were becoming active, ;and
Mrs. Hammond had already reproached our heroine
with having failed,, since her return home, after a lapse
of several years, to seek out one of her mother's most
intimate friends; and Geraldine, who had been kept
from doing so only by the perverse influence of her step-
mother, was awkwardly seeking to aecouiit and apolo-
gize for the neglect, when the door was flung wide, and
Mrs. Foster sailed into the room, blazing in her best
silks; and making as formidable a show of trinkets as
if she were the belle of the, evening. At her appear-
ance, the whole manner of Mrs. Hammond seemed t~
change. She drew up to her fullest height her tall
erect person. Her eye assumed a severe simplicity of
gaze, which entirely changed its 'expression; and her
reception of the new-coiner, Geraldine could .not but
remark, was singularly unlike that which had met her
appearance. The' truth is, the absence of simplicity,
the obtrusive ostentation of Mrs. Foster's manner, a
mixture at once of dignity and assumption which. was
neither confidence nor ease, brought out, all the native
superiority of her. visitor, Besides, she. remeitibered
her as the usurper, foisting herself by cunning upon
the weakness of a dying man, and succeeding to a posi-
tion in society for which her training and education
had not prepared h.er. The first meeting between the
two, already prepared to be belligerents, was productive
of impressions which strengthened their mutual dislikes
and distrusts. Mrs. Foster was boisterous and con-
fident; talked recklessly, as if her purpose had 'been to
show nothing but scorn Qf all the usual modes~ of think-
ing and feeling, all the forms and manners, which 'her
.guest had been wont to hold in reverence. The deport-
ment of Mrs. flammond was the reverse of this; but.
it was so full of a dignity jealous of assault, and reso-
lute against intrusion; so cold in its stateliness, so steru
in its simplicity, that ouP heroine, though vexed at the
bearing of her" step-mother, was not less chilled and

offended by that of her visitor. We need not detail the
progress of the interview. The call was a very short
one, and the parties separated mutually dissatisfied.
Mrs. Hammond, chafed with the impertinence ~of Mrs.
Foster, and disposed to see in Geraldine (who had been
very quiet) nothing but the susceptible creature whom
the step-mother had fashioned in all respects to resem-
ble herself; while the latterthough not exactly satisfied
with herself, was yet confirmed in all her grudges and
ancient hosLilities, as she felt the cold supremacy of
that bearing which she had bullied, without being able
to forsake or overcome.
"There," said she to Geraldine, when her visitor, had
been bowed down the steps; "there you have her in full;
the queen of Sheba, with her head in the clouds and
her fs~et among the stars. She's as proud as Lucifer.
You'd have a fine chance with her as a mother-in-law.
She'd rule you with a rod of iron. Do you smile, it's a
look; do you laugh, it's a scold; would you dance, it's a
sermon; and so day by day, until you're broken down
with the sulks and sours: no milk could keep sweet
long under that face of vinegar."
Geraldine was silent. She, too, had been disappointed
the visit. She could see that there was something
wrong in the carriage and language of her mother; but
unfortunately, her ear had become too much habituated
to the modes of speech and thinking of the 'latter to
feel, in full force, the improprieties of her conduct; and
she regarded the stern deportment of Mrs. Hammond as
totally unprovoked by~anything that had taken place.
She was quite, ignorant of that past history of the step-
mother which their visitor knew too well, and it was
really in some degree as the sincere friend of Geral-
dine's own mother that the soul of the old' lady revolted.
~t her substitute. But this the young lady was, yet to
learn. She, as we have said, was silent; while Mrs~
Foster ran, on in a strain cunningly calculated at once
to express her own hostility and to alarm the fears of
Geraldine. She painted the tyrannical mother of Ham-

mond subduing all the spirit of his young wife, of any
wife whom he should bring home; restraining all her
innocent desires, chiding her sentiments, and keeping
her in such a bondage to her antiquated notions, as
would effectually quell all her sweetest impulses, and
embitter all her youth with the mere caprices of author-
ity. From the mother she passed, by a natural tran-
sition, to the son. He was the true child of his
mother; cold, 'stern, unbending, despotic. She was
eloquent on this theme; she recalled and dwelt upon,~
with perverse ingenuity, every incident that could serve
for its illustration,' and it was only when she broke down
with utter exhaustion that she ~was content to stop.
Poor Geraldine said nothing. She was certainly im-
pressed by what she heard. The speech of Mrs. Foster
was not without ingenuity. Yet the girl thought of
Hammond with kindly feelings. lit was only when her
temper was roused that she was' disposed to side com-
pletely 'with 'her cunning and dishonest counsellor.
Somehow, she could not concur with her now, even in
respect to the stately mother. Though chilled to the
heart by the progress) of the interview, she yet remem-
bered the sweetness with which-it had begun.
How different had been the deportment of the 'old
lady before her step.moth'er made her appearance t
How kindly had she spoken; with what affectionate re-
membrance did she seem to dwell on the personal appear-
ance and the virtues of her mother; , surely, she
had seen the gathering tears in her soft blue' eyes at
the very moment when she felt thatcher own were filling.
Whence, then, the change.~ how could the appearance
of her step-mother have effected it? T~iere was a nays-
tery in this, and' the aroused heart of Geraldine brooded
over it; and~ daily, with an increasing pleasure, did she
remember The' sweet words and the sad tears which the
mother of Hammond ha'd shared with herself when the
two were alone together. '

CHAPTER XIII.
SOME TALK OF MARRIAGE.
BUT an event was now at hand which was calculated
to divert the thoughts of Geraldine Foster into other
channels. Her seventeenth birthday was approaching,
a period of immense importance to all young damsels.
It was destined to be regarded as such in the present
instance.. Already, for more than a month previous,
the rumor had gone abroad through the neighboring
country, of a great fete to be given at the "Lodge."
Supplies for the occasiofl were already making their
appearance. Wagons from Savannah and Augusta,
ladei~ with good things, were seen arriving, and public
expectation was on tiptoe for the event. In due season
our young men were all honored with invitations to the
birthday f~te9 Mrs. Hammond was also included in
this compliment, though Mrs. Foster was pleased to say,
while her step-daughter was penning the invitation, that
she knew "very wet that the haughty old hag would
never come again." She was mistaken, as we shall see
hereafter. Th&amp;truth is, as regards herself and her own
feelings, it neVer would have been the wish of Mrs. Ham-
mond to darken the doors of a lady like Mrs. Foster,
for whom she could never feel esteem; but the case was
~altered in respect to Geraldine. She regarded the
latter as the innocent, though perhaps misguided child
of a very dear friend, 'and~ on this account alone she
was prepared to treat3 her with solicitous considera-
tion. There was yet a better reason. Mrs. Hammond
had now satisfied herself that the affections of her son
were really engaged to the maiden; too deeply engaged,
indeed, to render prudent any farther exhortations and

warnings on her part. She resolved, therefore, instead
of discouraging with a vain importunity his pursuit of
the object, to yield herself to his cause, and contribute,.
as far as it would be becoming in her, to the promotion
of his wishes. She distinguished, accordingly, between
the girl and the silly step-mother; and, while.revolting at
the offensive frivolities and forwardnesses of~the latter,
was prepared to take the other, as the future wife of her
son, to her most affectionate embraces. This determi-
nation led her to accept an invitation which she other~
wise might have treated With indifference. It must not
be supposed, however, because we find Mrs. iEoster speak..~
ing in offensive terms of Mrs. Hammond, that the visit
of the latter had been disagreeable to her, or that she
had failed in returning it. Thj~ was very far, from being
the case. While she disliked to meet with the old lady,
from a real feeling of inferiority, and 'from a painful con-
sciousness that Mrs. Hammond knew more of her real
history than anybody else; she yet felt the importance,
in a social point of view, of appearing to maintain an
intimacy with one of a .i~nk so unquestionable. She
soon, with Geraldine, returned the visit in which she had
behaved with so mueh insolent familiarity; and was re-
ceived with the sweet benignity, mingled with
dignity,.
which so becomes a well-bred lady in the character of a
hostess. Geraldine could not but feel the superiority of
bearing in this venerable representative of a passing age,
to that to which she was accustomed* and~ could scarcely
reconcile the gentleness and meekness of the old iady'~
manner and tone with~ that which was so commanding
in her carriage and so irnpressiye in what she uttered.
True to her decision, and regarding the possible relation
in which the maiden might yet stand in regard tQ her
son, Mrs. Hammond was particularly anxious to please her
younger visitor.. While the three ladies traversed the gar-
den, which was a very ample and ~eautiful Qne, she loiter-
ed with the younger of the three, and again renewed the
subject of her intercourse with her mother. The garden
itself afforded a sufficient reason for recalling the ~ubjeot.

AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,

Mrs. Hammond's taste for flowers had been greatly in-
flueneed by the superior sympathies, for these lovely
creations, of the first Mrs. Foster; and it waS in the
power of the former to indicate to Geraldine a fact, of
which she was now for the first time made conscious,
that the garden at the "Lodge" had been laid out
exactly of the size and plan of that which she now ex-
amined. Its fate, how ever, had been very different.
While the latter was blooming in full perfection and
variety, the former had grown into a waste with weeds.
Geraldine only resolved to make amends to the memory
of her mother by restoring her favorite fruits and flowers.
The judicious manner of Mrs. Hammond, the equal
delicacy and adroitness with which she had again man-
aged to speak to the young girl of her mother, and to
show the tender. int?~rest which she herself felt for her
memory, were by no means thrown away upon the
daughter, who was sensibly touched, as well by the
manner as by the matter of her venerable hostess. Mrs.
Foster beheld this with some~ disquiet, and more than
once contrived to divert the conversation to other and
far less interesting topics. She herself was treated
'with the greatest deference, Mrs. Hammond being at
pains, for the sake of the ward, to treat the guardian as'
if she fully deserved to be such a custodian. At the end
of an hour, the visitors were prepared to depart, and
Randall Hammond made his appearance just in time to
see the ladies to the carriage.
A few days after came the invitation to the f~$te.
"You will go, dear mother, will you not ?" was the
inquiry of Hammond, uttered in pleading accents. She
was disposed to plague him, and expressed herself
doubtfully.
"' I don't know. II am old~ These night parties are
not good for me, and I don't enjoy them."
"But, for my sake, mother."
I' I don't~ know but that, for your sake, I ought to
stay away. I am half afraid to give any encourage-
ment to this pursuit."

"Be it so, ;Miles.~ You hear' 'what I tell you. I

'of' the' prize.".
~tBut suppose, seeing no ehanee of you, 'and tired of

woman "for me. I ~ho~ld rejQice in' my escape."

The girl who is in' sttch' haste to get a husband as to

no man's having."
"I don't know but you're right."
While upon this fruitful subject, let 'us pass from the
two friends to another of 'the parties' to our story, WhOsQ
feelings, about this period, were similarly' concerned
with the fair Geraldine, and the approaching festivities..
Sunday was usually 'chosen' by our excellent acquaint-
ance, 'Jones Barry, for his dinners. 'He was then apt
to call in~his acquaintance, to see his' friends, and make
a day 'of it. He never denied, himself on the~e 4ays.
He was a bachelor, a man of wealth, and enjoyed a cer-
tam degree of impunity. He at least assumed that
one, whose behavior was so uniformly good during the
week, should be permitted his 'enjoyments on the Sab-
bath. ~Of course, we quarrel with no man for his opi~~
ions. We are' indulgent, and only propose to show his
practice under them.
Jones Barry had a cleverish cook, who could make
mock turtle to perfection, and dress a haunch of venison
to the equal~ satisfaction of epicure and hunter. He
loved good things, and never stinted himself at any time;
but it was' on Sunday that he' particularly laid himself
out to be happy. The first day of the week had come
in which the birthday fete of Miss Foster 'was' to be
celebrated. He had several guests that day, and an
excellent dinner. There was our old friend, Nettles,
among the former, ~o whom one end of the table was
assigned. Joe Blake; Dick Moore, and Tom Lechmere
formed the rest of the company. The dinner passed off
gloriously. When the cloth was 'rein oved, the host;
raising his glass, cried-
"Fill, gentlemen, and 'drink to the health of'the f~iit
Geraldine."
"Lady or filly ?" inquired Nettles.
"Oomne, Tom, don't be disrespectful. She may yet
be my wife."
Nettles repeated the question.
"Lady or filly, Jones?"

"You're a beast," cried Barry; "drink before I send
the bottle at your head."
"t~o nothing of the kind, I beg, until you've emptied
it at least. j3ut still let me ask. I drink, you see; for
it matters' not much to your friends whom you marry;

shouldn't promote his filly by marriage."
"Psha~! that's all nonsense about the Roman em.
peror."
"True, every bit of it, except that I have ~ny doubts
about the gender of the beast.' But tell us truly. Out
with it like a man. Are you to be married to the fair
"To the lady, perhaps."
"Not exactly, 'but so nigh there's no fun in it."
, "AhI then you have prQposed, Jones?"
"No-~-not to Geraldiue herself, but the mother goes
for me.
"But 'that's not the daughter.",
"It'.s something towards the election."
"Don't believe a word of it, Jones," answered the
reckless Nettles. "It's like your racehorse 'calculations.
You'll be beaten when you're most certain.~~
"And who's tobeat me, do you think ?"
"Why Ran. ~~~mond, to be sure."
"He! he stajids no more chance than my grandmother.
Why, Mrs. Foster hates him as she does ~Olson.~~
"What of that? I can tell you she wouldn't hate him
long, if he was willing to marry her insteadof the daughter.
But her hate don't hurt. ' That girl has a will of her

THE DIRTUDAY FETE.
TPE decision 9f' Miles Henderson was precisely that
of Jones Barry. He had preparedd himself, under the
special instructions of Mrs. Foster, to make his propo-
sals to the fi~~r Geraldine, on the occasion of h~r birth-
day. That excellent lady, the step-mother, had seve~'ai
private conferences with this faVored suitor, without the
knowledge of' the young lady. In these conversations,
she particularly encouraged his hopes, and enjoiii~d'
upon him the experiment during the progress of the
festivities. She did not tell him upon what she 'had
based her calculations of success, ~robab~y with~ some
just apprehensions In regard to his ~~udence ; but she
might 'have trusted him; for, 'in all' his revelations to
his cOmpaniotis oVer the bottle, he never yiel4~d' up
hjs secrets entirely. lie still kept something to him-

only gave more life to the proceedings. The drum be-
came, in a little time, too useful for dismission.
Mrs. Hammond arrived at an early hour. Her son
did not then accompany~ her. He was governed in this
delay by motives 'which we may conjecture from what
we have heard him say, on a previous occasion, to his
friend Henderson. It was his policy not to seem too
anxious. His mother's motive' for coming early was
that she might not 'stay late. She did not come seek-
ing amusement, and she designed returning home before
the day was out. It was in compliment to the lady,
who might yet be her son's wife, that she came at all.
She was received respectfully by Geraldine, and civilly
enough by Mrs. Foster. The latter was too greatly in
her glory not to seem amiable that day. Her vanity
was in full exercise, to enable her to play her part with
suavity and grace.-
Of course, we cannot pretend to describe the persons.
'present. They were very numerous, not less than two
hundred and fifty having been invited. All, certainly,
did not attend; but there were some who came without
being conscious of the necessity of being asked; and
these were usually the most conspicuous and active ~n
their attentions to themselves and one another. 04r
amiable friend Miles Henderson, and our humorous
friend Jones' Barry, arrived at the same moment; the
latter accompanied by his Mephistopheles, Tom Nettles.
It was with a slight shade upon her brow that Geral-
dine observed that Henderson came alone. She had
looked, as a matter of course, that hammond would ac-
company Henderson. Her mother saw the expression
in her countenance, and. remtuirkecl,. in- an under tone, as
Miles rode up-.-.
"So, his friend's not with him. I doubt if he comes
at all. His pride would scarcely al-low him to do any-
thing which seemed to do us honor."
"But his ,piother's here," whispered Geraldine.
"To spy out the poverty of the land, and to go home
and. sneer. We haven't such a display of plate as~ the

Hammonds can set out; and she will have her say about
the difference between old times, when she was every-
body, and now when other people want to be some-
body."
"Mother, you are too harsh 1"
"Too harsh! Well, you can make up for it by being
too tender! We'll see yet if the soft lie~art of the
woman proves too weak for the arrogant pride of the
man."
The daughter felt the imputation, and turned away
with an expressive smile upon her lips. The mother
knew the meaning and the value of that smile, and she
was satisfied. Pride was the weakness of Geraldine;
and upon this characteristic the cunning woman played.
She knew that while she kept this feeling sore and
irritable, her schemes were in no danger; and she knew
enough of Hammond's character, and suspected enough
of his policy, to believe that he would be more likely to
increase this irritability of her daughter's mood than
to soothe or overcome it. We shall see whose politics
were the wisest.
The greater portion of the company having arrived,
the grounds began to be filled with groups, detaching
themselves from the mass, each for the gratification of
his or her peculiar sympathies. Some of the younger
damsels might be seen swinging or skipping rope under
the shade-trees, with a fair sprinkling of dapper young
lads to devour, with greedy looks of love, their several
movements and devices. Here and there; along the
avenue, might be seen a whizzing ball, in the hurling
of which the youngsters were the performers, and the
ladies were lookers on; while tables, spread convenient-
ly, offered cakes and lemonade as refreshments to the
languid and exhausted. But anon, the drum gave the
gratuitous signal, and the clarinet and violin led the
way for a procession. The swing and rope were aban~
doned in a moment, the ball received its last cast. The
youth of both sexes came together, and paired off, by a
very natural movement, which showed how sympathetic

were the instincts of both parties; and away they
march in a procession which led through a beautiful
avenue of oaks and cedars.. It was at this moment, and
while our young friend Jones Barry, being plucked'
by the* sleeve by Mrs. Foster, was breaking away from
the society of Tom Nettles, and rushing forward to
offer his arm to Geraldine, that Randall Hammond. was
seen suddenly to glide from under a clump of shade-
trees, near the avenue, and anticipate his intentions.
Geraldine certainly did not, in her countenance, reflect
the spite which was apparent in the visage of the mo-
ther, at this moment, to Tom Nettles, who muttered to
himself with that sort of grin and chuckle which the
man of mischief puts on when he sees sport.
"It sticks, old lady, does it? and so it should. Ran.
Hammond is the lad to conquer both of you."
his sneer and feeling did not prevent him from play-
ing the gallant with the very lady whose vexation had
so much pleased him. While the anger was yet quiver-
ing on her lip, he drew nigh, and, with the sweetest
smile in the world, and the nicest compliment, he
tendered her his arm; which, as he was a most comely
person and a moderately young bachelor, the judicious
lady at once frankly accepted.
"Really," said he, "Mrs. Foster, you are in every
respect fortunate. The day is just the day for such a
fete, and it is no discredit to the company to say that'
it is worthy of your arrangements. I need not say that
they are worthy of any company.
"Oh, Mr. Nettles, you overwhelm while you delight
me
"True in every respect, my dear madam. I never
saw so excellent and large a collection of fine people
before in the county. I could scarcely have thought,
indeed, that the county could boast of so many fashion-
able-looking people.'.'
"Nor does it, Mr. Nettles 1" answered the lady, with
a delighted smile. "In some instances, I have gone out
of the county for my guests."
"That explains it," said he, quietly, as if assured

AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,

and satisfied. "Miss Foster," he continued, "is a beau-
tiful creature. They would make a noble couple."
The motion of his hand was in the direction of Geral-
dine and Eammond, who were just wheeling out of sight
in a turn of the avenue. The remark, which he well
knew was wormwood to his hearer, remained unanswered.
Kettles was a man to dash his bitter usually with some
sweet; though, perhaps, the bitter was apt, finally, to
preponderate.
"But it is the ~nisfortune of young persons, who have
no guardians sufficiently their seniors to command their
veneration, to be perverse in such matters. I should
fear that Miss Foster is too decidedly your companion
to be sensible of your authority."
"There is some truth in what you say, Mr. Nettles,
though, as her proper guardian, I ought not to confess
it. But, the fact is that, when I yielded to the entrea-
ties of Mr. Foster, I was but a child myself."
The words passed through the brain, but did not find
their way to the tongue of Nettles: "Pretty well grown,
and honestly twenty~eight, if old grandmother Crowell
knew anything about it." He did not suffer any pause
for reflection, as he answered"-.
"The county proverb is a true one, I'm afraid, Mrs.
Foster."
"What proverb, Mr. Nettles ?"
"That which says that the mothers are only the elder
sisters of the daughters, and that the widows are always
in the way of the virgins !"
"But you don't believe it, Mr. Nettles ?"
"At this moment, I have every reason to do so;
and the 'grateful lady was not unconscious of the slight
contracting pressure upon her own of the arm in which
it rested. The thought irresistibly forced itself upon
her--.
"How strar~ge that Mr. Nettles shouldn't have thought
of a wife. Certainly, it's high time for 'him to do so, if
he ever means to get one."
Nettles was a famous mocker, but we must follow the

company rather than the conversation. The procession
continued through most delightful groves, all the way
to the mill-seat of Gushlynn. On the route, the young
people sported like so many kids. Conspicuous among
these was Jones Barry; who, playing his antics directly
in the sight of Geraldine Foster, might, if he had been
sufficiently observant and sagacious, have seen upon her
countenance a scorn quite as expressive as that with
which Michal saluted David when she saw him dancing
along tha highways.' Geraldine, in respect of pride, was
no bad representative of Saul's daughter. Barry was
the centre of a bevy of fat girls, whose dimensions some-
what reminded him of the barkeeper's daughter, whom
Nettles had counselled him to choose for a wife. It was
evident that he was not less a favorite among them,
because he consented to play antics in their eight. He
might have had his choice among them, without leaving
the rejected any better satisfied, or worse off.. Miles
Henderson revolved near Geraldine, but as an escort to
one of the Baileys, a quiet, dignified girl, one of the
three or four whom Mrs. hammond 'was~ not unwilling
that her son should espouse. The procession passed
forward, the music still vibrated along the groves, and
soon the groups began to arrive at the beautiful place
chosen for the picnic, the fine park of open pines which
spread along at the foot of the falling waters of Gush-
lynn. This was an abandoned mill-seat, the great dam
and floodgate of which were still' maintained in repair;
the former being a broad carriage-track, overgrown on
each side and perfectly shaded by great evergreens,~ the
water-oak, the cedar, and several other trees; while the
floodgate afforded a pretty and picturesque fall of water,
whose torrents were always making a pleasant murmur
for the groves. Above the dam lay an immense sheet
of several thousand acres, several feet deep, of water;
while below, the falling surplus found its way, after
passing the wreck of the old mill-house, into a sweet little

and the tot~t ensemble presented one of those lovely pictures
of united elevation, water, and shade-tree which, after all,
present the most durable materials for the landscape
painter. Here' then, along the mill-dam, in the shade of
the pine woods below, and at intervals around the reserve
and the lakelet Qf discharged waters, our company dis-
persed themselves, each after hi~ own fashion seeking
pleasure. Here again the swing was found, as well of
rope as of great grape-vines on which the young dam-
sels reclined, and in which they were rocked occasionally
by the eager hands of the dutiful young men. Here,
too, the ball was again put in requisition among the
more athletic, who darted tifrough the wide green
avenues in graceful flight, or hurried in pursuit, with
good-natured fury. Some of the young ladies did not
scorn to engage in the play, though it was observed
that all who did so had previously taken the precaution
of wearing short frocks and ample pantalettes. These
nice little appendages of the petticoats, it wa~ perhaps
censoriously remarked by some of the elder maidens,
were worn quite gratuitously by several who in no other
way could be suspected of being still in miniature girl-
hood. But this matter does not concern us. 'It may
be well, however, to state that geraldine, whatever
might have been the imputations upon her eccentricity,
was not seen to participate in any of these wilder exer-
cises, though her excellent step-mother frequently urged.
it upon. her, and stoutly seconded the entreaties of our
friend Barry, who challenged her to a. match. at rope4
skipping. That the eye of Hammond and his mother
were bGth upon her, all the while, with some curiosity,
did not discourage Mrs. roster from her object. On
the contrary, somewhat stimulated by seeing that they
watched the daughter, she was more than ever anxious
to persuade her to. the exhibitions of the hoyden. We
have already some knowledge of her policy. It did not
succeed in thi"s instance, even though, stung by refusal,
she said bitterly, as she turned' away from the girl:
"Well, you are perhaps right. 1 see that the Queen

of Sheba, and her ~wise Solomon, are both watching you.
They would never countenance, I suppc~se, any such in~
nocent practices."
The high-spirited girl was half tempted to whirl away
upon the rope, or to seize, and wing, and pursue. the
ball,. as she heard this imputation upon her courage; but
she too had her reflections, and prudently forbore.
Indeed, she now began to feel, not only that she had
something at stake, but that her stepmother was neither
the most wise nor the most disinterested of counsellors.
Barry, sustained by her guardian, she began to feel was
something of a bore; and she was conscious of a purpose,
which she now perforce maintained, which would suf-
ficiently try the sense of propriety as well in Hammond
as his mother. But of this hereafter. It is certain
that she refused to do the graces on the skipping-rope,
or the fairies in pursuit of the flying ball. She con~
ducted herself with a demureness which, while it vexed
her mother, was quite satisfactory to other parties; and
Mrs. Hammond returned home, at an early hour in the
day, much better reconciled 'to the 'object of her son's
admiration than she was before she came.
Meanwhile, the business of the day proceeded with
pleasure, as it had begun. Dinner was spread under
the shade of the great trees; a well-considered repast,
in which the provision was ample, and in good taste.
In this matter, Mrs. Foster received no small assistance
from her daughter, who had brought to her knowledge
the refinements of the ancient and elegant city of Savan-
nah. When one of the plain country ladiesof the past
generation beheld, for the first time, a display of silver
forks, and silver fish and butter-knives, she exclaimed,
with looks of genuine apprehension,. "'.1 reckon the
widow must have 6roke Savannah !*"
The fruits of the West Indies had been brought to
grace the repast. There were. 'oranges and lemons,
plantains and bananas; pineapples and cocoanuts. There
were preserved fruits and foreign cordials, and a very
generous supply of champagne; a beverage which most


188         AS GOOD AS A COMis~DY OR,

effectually entrapped, to their overthrow, sundry per-
sons who had never drank any beverage of similar
flavor more grateful than "persimmon beer." Our
friend, Jones IBarry, through. the agency of Mrs. Foster,
was a conspicuous person in the order of the exercises.
lie was rather a volunteer, when the champagne-corks
were to be sprung, his whole soul being surrendered to
the happiness of seeing the young ladies start with sur-
prise at a sound which was so unwanted from such a
source. We must add that his practice was scarcely so
innocent when he busied himself in decoying the same
simple damsels to such free draughts of the liquor as
rendered them scarcely less ridiculous than himself.
That mischievous creature, Tom. Nettles, was busy,
however, in playing upon Barry the same game which
he played upon the girls, and he watched with no little
pleasure the uncertain strides which the latter took
among the several groups which he haunted, while his
voice equally increased in thickness and rapidity. These
ludicrous proceedings, however, were about to ufxdergo
a change. Tliere is scarcely any human pleasure, as
we know which can be considered certain for three
hours together. Our hero, Barry, in the midst of his
merriment, suddenly remembered that he had a serious
business before him; a look and a whisper from Mrs.
Foster drew his attention to Geraldine, who had wan-
dered off with Miles Henderson to the ancient mill-site,
and was now to be seen at the extremity of one of the
remaining beams - or sleepers. The torrent ran at
considerable depth below.- Beside her, stood Miles
Henderson. He seemed abQut to leave her; and, with
the words, "Now's your time," Mrs. Foster left Barry
to pursi~e his purpose.
'-Barry, who was a creature of simple impulses, imme-
diately started away, and, in his passage up the mill-
dam, met Miles Henderson returning alone. Poor
Miles had giveh in his petition, but without waiting or
seeking for a present answer. He only implored that
Miss Foster would read his billet at the first opportu-

TIlE TE~1NESSEI~AN' S STORY.

189

nity, and communicate her reply as soon as possible.'
He muttered something about anxiety an&amp; suspense; but
he was rather unintelligible to himself, and he could not
trust himself to be more explicit. He was crossing the
mill-bank quietly, without seeking to attract attention,
and was just about to descend to th~ plain, when Barry
appeared below. The latter, however, perceiving the
object whom he was pursuing to be still lingering at
the end of the great sleeper which crossed the chasm,
one end resting upon the bank and the other upon the
opposite foundations of the mill-house, proceeded to take
the shortest route for reaching her, and, instead of keep-
ing the bank, he darted aside, and was in a few moments
seen upon the sleeper. The height was a dizzy one, and
so was the head of the daring suitor. Miss Foster, seeing
his approach, hastily thrust the note of Henderson into
her bcsom. At this moment, and when he was half
way across the passage, he begati to fumble in~ his own
bosom, and before he or anybody could conjecture his
peril, he toppled suddenly, lost his balance, and went over,
kicking and floundering with ineffectual struggles, into
the boiling waters below. Fortunately, they were deep
enough to break his fall, which was some twelve or fifteen
feet, and he disappeared, headforemost, in the petty gulf.
Geraldine screamed aloud, for she saw the accident
instantly, and the scream was echoed by a dozen other
pretty damsels on the opposite side. It required but afew
moments to make the event known among the crowd,
and twenty seconds had not elapsed before Tom Nettles
and Randall Hammond had made their way to the edge
of the lake, where Barry was now struggling with very
ineffectual efforts, his wine being diluted, seemingly, to
the entire defeat of his energies, by the disproportionate
quantity of the inferior liquid which he had swallowed
after it perforce. A couple of long-pointed poles hap~
pened to be convenient, and were seized in the same
instant by Hammond and Nettles. With these they
fished the poor fellow up by his clothes, to the bank,
the mischievous Nettles contriving, more than once,

by seemingly awkward movements, to thrust him down
into the lake just when he expected to be out of it. It
was in vain that Hammond honestly labored to get the
gallant upon his legs. It happened, unfortunately for
Barry, that his head lay nearest to Nettles; and the
wi~ful agitation of the latter, with his pole thrust into
the breast of ]3arry's coat, succeeded in giving him seve-
ral severe dips before he was finally extricated.
"Whoo! Tom! What the devil, man! would you
drown me in a mill-pond ?"
"N Jones, my dear fellow; but I'm quite nervous
at your situation-quite."
And, as he spoke, the head of the unfortunate took
another plunge, at the very moment when Hammond
was drawing him ashore by the leg. He came forth
looking aghast, shook himself like a water-dog, and it
was then seen, for th&amp; first time, that he held a letter
ch~sped in his hand.
Why, Jones, what have you got there 2" demanded
Nettles.
"A letter !" and, with the words, he cast his eye up
to the head of the mill-seat, as if still looking for Ge-
raldine. But she was no longer in sight.
"A letter! Where the deuce did you get it 2-at
the bottom of the lake 2"
"IDon't ask me, old fellow. I'm no better than a
heathen icicle. I'm chilled to the heart. Get me into
the bushes, and bring me a bottle of champagne."
"A good brandy~toddy would be better," said the
&amp;ther, while he hurried off. Hammond then conducted
him into the woods, while he summoned his servant to
go off for fresh clothing.
"Won't you go home yourself', Barry ?" demanded
Nettles, when he returned, having first administered his
drink.
"No; I feel' better now.' I shall be dry soon. Here,
Tony-[to the boy in waiting]-kindle up a fire, and
l~et me know what the natural feeling of dry breeches
is. What ad     daffairitis!"

"Dreadful!" said Nettles. "But that l~tter,~
Jones 2"
"Oh! if you must see it, there it is."
Nettles, reading the address-
"To Miss Geraldine. Foster," &amp;c.
At these words, Hammond disappeared, leaving the
two friends, together. It was night when they showed
themselves again, Barry looking as happy as if nothing
had happened, and ready for all the grateful intricacies
of the Virginny reel.

CHAPTER XV.
TIlE EVENING OF THE DAY.
MRS. FOSTER was greatly discomfited at the disaster
of her favorite. She contrived, however, to keep her
countenance; an effort of which her daughter was not
capable. She, as well as most of the young damsels, as
soon as it was discovered, that Barry was in no danger,
laughed outright at his predicament, and were extremely
amused and interested at the way in which he was fished
out of the pond; the particular part taken by Nettles in
this delicate operation being very intelligible to most of
them. His disappearance in the bushes was followed
by a movement of the whole party. The day had passed
with great satisfaction to most of the company, and even
*     this accident did not materially abate the general satis-
faction. The dinner was excellent; the cates, wands,
the wines and dessert, in especial, were equally new and
grateful to the popular palate; and it was with height-
ened feelings of enjoyment, and heightened expectations
also, that the guests listened to the signal of the drum,
which 'announced the return to the homestead. With
flying colors and triumphant music, the gay cavalcade
moved forward; but in order very different from that
in which they came. There was now more life and im-
pulse, and less formality. People are more at home
usually after the wine and walnuts; and the chatter was
incessant, the laughter wild, and not a few pranks and
petty excesses were practiced on the return route among
the younger people. Hammond did not now escort Miss
Foster. He left that pleasant duty to other gallants,
of whom the fair damset had a liberal supply. Hender-
son also kept aloof, feeling quite too anxious and too

much interested in the result of his application to risk
himself near the person who held his fate in her harad8.
The return of the party was happily timed to bring.them
into the grounds about the "Lodge," just aboutdusk. A
fairy scene greeted the eyes of the guests as they now
drew nigh. A hundred altars seemed tc~ f~arr~e, at in-
tervals, among the trees and along the great avenue.
Here rude elevations had been made of ch~y and sand,
upon which piles of dry combustible pine had been accu-
mulated, and which were now all blazing brightly, in
sharp, upward-darting tongues of fire. The rich illuini~
nation lighted up the scene less softly and brightly, ir~
deed, but even more picturesquely than the moonshine;
and the happy groups wandered through various path-
ways over which the blazing brands cast a rich, red lustre,.
that eminently enlivened the rude forests, and made the
particular trees stand forth, each like a frowning giant
The admiration of the company was unanimous, and
Mrs. Foster exulted in a triumph which she did not
inform any of her guests was due wholly to the fancy
of her step-daughter. For that matter, the entire scheme
of the day belonged to the latter. All that was fanciful
and picturesque in the design originated in her taste and
invention. Tea was served, as the party wandered
among the trees in the park. The tables which had
borne lemonade and cakes in the morning, were now
covered with hissing urns and fairy-like cups of china;
and here the pledges for partners were given f~r the
dances which were to follow, After the pleasant fashiQri
of the peasants in the south of Europe, gay squadrons
prepared to dance under the shade-trees, and by the
light of the pine-blazing altars. Others, more consi-
derate of domestic forms and health, prepared to occupy
the great hail, the parlor, and piazza of the dwelling-
house. The music was already in full discourse, and
the groups whirling in the dance, when Nettles and
I3arry made their appearance. The latter had been for-
tunate, taxing the full speed of his horse "Glaucus;"
the "Fair Geraldine" being in too great esteem to be

used for common purposes, in getting from home a fresh
supply of snugly-fitting garments. His long-tailed blue,
and shining gold buttons, made a conspicuous figure in
the assembly, particularly when contrasted with his pan-
taloons, of the most delicate velvet buff. Mrs. Foster
saw his return with delight. The good lady had begun
to b~ apprehensive of the game. She was afraid that
the ridiculous attitude in which he had been placed, his
somerset from the sleeper' into the lake, and the un-
happy floundering which followed there, had disgusted
her daughter. She was also by no means a satisfied
spectator of the frequent, though brief and broken
sketches of conversation which had taken place between
Geraldine and Hammond. The reappearance of Barry,
restored in appearance, and looking rather attractive,
was refreshing. She drew him privately into an inner
room, and, while she served him with a dish of tea from
her own hands; she could not forbear breaking forth
"Really, Barry, how could you make yourself so ridi-
culous ?"
"Ridiculous I" he exclaimed, sipping the beverage;
"I ridiculous, ma'am?"
"Such a ridiculous 'situation, I mean
"Perilous, you mean
"Yes! it was perilous. But how did you come to
fall? What carried you out on that sleeper ?".
"I reckon the champagne had something to do with
it; champagne and love together."
"Love?"
"To be sure! What else? Wasn't Miss Geraldine
at one end of the log, and alone? Didn't you give me
the hint, and wasn't this the letter?"
Here. he showed the luckless epistle, which, full of fiery
virtue, might be supposed to have been well tempered
by its subsequent saturation, like a hissing blade of Da-
mascus in the sacred waters of the Baraddee. Mrs.
'Foster seized the neatly-folded epistle in her hands.
"Give it to me! I will deliver it myself, this very

night. Meanwhile, do you go out and make yourself
agreeable with the young ladies. Don't be too particular
with Geraldine. Only let her see you, and see that~you
can make yourself agreeable to others. Dance with that
Miss Berrie; flirt as much as you can with Miss Dooly.
Either of them would be glad to snap you up. Let her
see that! There's several others, Miss Higbee, Ellen
Mairs, and Sophronia iRicketts, all of whom will be 'glad
to have you 'squire them. Only don't be rash, don't
venture any strange thing, and all will go right. I'll
deliver the letter !"
"Well! I thank you very much, for I was beginning
to feel quite squeamish about it. I'm a little afeard that
Hammond's getting on rather fast!"
"He! never fear. He has dropped too many stitches
for him to take up in a hurry. Will you have some more
tea ?"
"I shouldn't care if I had something stronger."
"Oh! you mustn't think of any such thing now. I
can give yo~i stronger tea."
"Well; if there's nothing better."
"Taste that," said the hostess, spooning him from a
cup which the servant handed; and the scene was a
good one for the painter. Barry, like an overgrown
boy, sitting back in his chair, while the fair widow-by
no means old or uncomely-.cuip and saucer in one hand,
and spoon in the other, fed him with the smoking
beverage.
"Prime !" said he, with an air of satisfaction. Then
taking the cup, he dashed it off with something less of
appetite than resolution; and, abruptly darting from
the chamber, hurried' out to seek a partner. Mrs.
Foster followed him with eager interest, and was at
length pleased to see him sprightly whirling it with~ the
bouncing Rebecca Floyd~ It was with no dissatisfac-
tion. that she beheld Miles Henderson dancing with
Geraldine. It was somewhat strange that she enter-
tamed no 'such fears of this young man as of his friend.
He was quite a wcirthy and a very lovable person; tall,


196         AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,

graceful, good-looking, very amiable, and tolerably well
off in point of fortune. But, somehow, these qualifica-
tions never occasioned a fear; though they were in all
respects, but that of fortune, very far superior to any
of the possessions of her favorite, She kept the couple
in sight till the dance was over; and then hurriedly
summoned Geraldine, in a whisper, to the inner room,
but not before Hammond had succeeded in engaging
her for the country dance that followed; the silly and
highly objectionable custom of 'securing partners for
many dances ahead, not then prevailing as it does now-.
certainly not "in these diggings." When the two were
safely together in the snug little apartment, where
Barry but a little while before had sipped his tea,
Mrs. Foster, with a very triumphant air, thrust the
letter of that worthy into the hands of the young lady.
"There! There's something for you."
"What's this ?"
"An offer!"
"Indeed! Here's a pair of t~em, then, I suppose,"
said the maiden, somewhat coolly, as, for the first time,
she took from her bosom the billet of our friend, Hen-
derson. "First come, first served," and she proceeded
to break the seal of the latter.
"Who's that from ?" asked the step-mother, with
some anxiety.
"Miles Henderson. He gave it me at the mill."
"Oh, well.!" and the good lady seemed relieved as
the daughter proceeded in its perusal. This done, she
laid it quietly on the table; Mrs. Foster taking it up
and going over it as soon as she had laid it down. The
perusal of Jones IBafry's declaration followed, on the
part of the person to whom it was addressed, and Mrs.
Foster watched Geraldine's countenance with increas-
ing curiosity, while pretending to examine Henderson's
letter. But she gathered nothing from the face of our
heroine. She read the one epistle, as she had done the
other, with a singular calm, amounting to indifference;

THE TENNESSEBAN'S STORY.        197
and, handing it ~to the mother, begged her to take care
of both.
"But what will you say? What are you going to
do? You accept?"
"There's no hurry! I'm not in the humor now to
think of these things. The gentlemen deserve that I
should think of their offers respectfully."
"Oh, certainly! But Barry ?".
"Mr. Jones Barry must learn to wait as well as his
neighbor," was the quiet reply; and at that moment
Geraldine was relieved from further questioning by the
entry of Miss Betsy Graystock, who bounced in to say
that Mr. Randall Hammond was looking for his partner,
the country dances being about to begin. It was with
some chagrin that Mrs. Foster saw the promptness with
which her prote1g~1 hurried out after this notice; and her
disquiet increased as she watched the couple through
all the mazes of the dance that followed. It wa~ her
endeavor to keep these parties continually in sight,
while they remained together; but this was not alto-
gether possible, consistently with her cares and duties
as hostess. Her attention was finally called off to some
domestic arrangements; and, while she was engaged in
the inner room, the dance ceased. Returning to ibok
after her charge, as soon as the confusion of shifting
groups could Possibly allow, she was a little displeased
and distressed to find that they were now nowhere in
sight. It was not her policy to afford to Hammond.-.
whose influence over Geraldine she really began to ap-
prehend-any unnecessary opportunities; and, Seizing
Barry by the arm, she sent him off, with~a whisper, to
look for Geraldine in one direction, while she set off
herself, in another, to detect the whereabouts of her
supposed companion.
Hammond, meanwhile, had readily persuaded Geral-
dine to a promenade under the shade-trees along the
avenue. They were not alone in this measure. - The
gay groups, most of them, after dancing, had taken a
similar direction ; and, as the night was pleasant, they

might be seen straying ~away through the various groves,
glimpsing here and there through the prolonged vistas,
their white garments gleaming spiritually under the
flickering lights from the numerouS blazing pyres of
pine wood, which the watchful care of the negroes in
attendance from time to time supplied with fuel. The
search of Barry and Mrs. Foster was not an easy one,
to examine these various groups and trace out the par-
ticular couple among the scattered flocks that wound
about capriciously in every turning of the wood. It
was still ~more difficult, when the object of Hammond-.
perhaps not unobserved byl4s companion--~was tempo-
rary seci~oy and seclusion. lie led~her away from all
other sets, and, in the doubtful light of a half-decaying
pile, and under the friendly shadows of a venerable
~ak which had lived long enough to know how to keep
secrets, and was probably too deaf to hear, our hero
made his declaration. He spoke in warm and touching
language, evidently with a ~full and feeling heart, but
~tili in accents of a firm and dignified character. The
imperfect light did not suffer him to perceive the emo-
tion which his proposals occasioned on the cheeks of
the damsel ;~ but he felt her hand treuible in his, and
her reply wa~ slow. For some moments, indeed, a pro-
found silence followed his speech, and his heart began
to sink with a feeling of dread and disappointment, for
which, it must be confessed, he found himself very im-
perfectly prepared. But, with some abruptness in her
maimer, a8 if her reply was the result of a real effort,
an~ was, indeed, foreign to the genuine feeling which
wa~ at her heart, she somewhat surprised him by say-
"I am honored, Mr. Hammond, by your offer,
and
There was, a pause, when she again began-
"You have heard, no, doubt, Mr. Hammond, that I
ama very thoughtless, a very whimsical, a very capri-
cious, a very eccentric girl, and, in truth, I am so. I
have been very foolish, and my foolish resolutions some-

times trouble me, as they do in this instance. But the
kind and complimentary declaration which you have
made reminds me of one* of my own, and I am half
ashamed~ to tell you what it is."
"Indeed 1' But, dear Miss Foster, you cannot doubt
that I will be the most indulgent of all judges~---"
"Oh, surely, as far as it is possible; but yo~ir de-
claration makes you an interested one, and my resolve
concerns this very declaration."
"Indeed !" with an air of some surprise
"Yes, indeed !" and there was now some little pique
mingled in with the lady's embarrassment; "but it
concerns not only your proposals, sir, but those of other
persons9 You must 'kn9w, sir, and I do not mention
the fact except from the necessity of the case, that
yours is the third offer of marriage whidi I have had
to-day."
"Then, Miss Foster, I am to understand that I am
too late ?" This was said rather proudly.
"Not so, Mr. lianimond. You are, on the contrary,
rather quick. I have as yet determined on neither,
and a rash resolution-a 'foolish vow-makes it impos-
sible that I should determine directly. [-I have been
very foolish, sir."
The poor girl seemed really very much embarrassed.
Her sympathies were all with Hammond; but her pride
had been committed, and it was still~ watchful~and re-
sentful. Hammond perceived and felt for her embar-
rassment.
"If I knew what to say or what to do 1" said he.
"If I could only conjectur9 the cause of your embar-
rassment !"
And he hesitated. The pride of the girl came' to
her relief.
"I have been very foolish, no doubt; but that is no
reason why I should be cowardly. I must risk the re-
proach of being whimsical and* ridiculous; but you shall
know all. Mr. Hammond, your horse 'Ferraunt' is, you
tell me, the fastest horse in the country ?"

Her companion was confounded. This question,
seemingly so absurd, was put with all imaginable se-
riousness; nay, with something like a vehement earnest-
ness, while the speaker looked directly up into the face
of the person she addressed, as if anxiously awaiting
his answer. He was bewildered.
"Really, Miss Foster, you surprise me. What can
the speed of my horse have to do with the matter?"
"A great deal-a great deal. Only tell me, is it
not so? Is not 'Ferraunt' the fastest horse in the
country? In short, can't he beat Mr. Henderson's
Sorella,' and the 'Geraldine,' my namesake, of Mr.
]3arry's?"
"Such is my opinion. Nay, without an accident,' I
am very sure of it. ' But really, Miss Foster, you must
again permit me to express my surprise at the ques-
tion."
"Oh, .1 know that you think me very ridiculous, and
I am so-I am so," answered the girl, now laughing
playfully and wildly, as if with a heart fully relieved of
a burden.
"Forgive me, sir, I am but a child; seventeen only,
to-day. Forgive ire; but will you spare me tonight?
Suffer me to convey to you my answer in writing."
She gave him her hand as sh~ spoke. He seized and
conveyed it to his lips, and the action was in noways re-
buked.' Bu~ it was witnessed. Mrs. Foster broke in, at
this moment, with "Geraldine, Geraldine! my daughter,
you are wanted."
"I am with you, mother ;" and she whirled away
with the intruder, who had barely time to say, "What
do I see, Geraldine ?" when Jones Barry came up to
entreat the hand of the latter for the next cotillion, and
to relieve her from the necessity ~of answering a very
awkward question.

CHAPTER XVI.
THAT LAST DRINK AND DANCE~ AND WHAT CAME OF IT.
WE must premise that, when dispatched by Mrs.
Foster in search of Geraldine, Jones Barry did not
proceed directly upon ~his mission. He was diverted
from this object by his friend Tom N~ettles, who ap-
peared to have been seeking, and who, seizing' him by
the arm, drew him to the rear of the building with a
look and manner of very mysterious confidence.
"Jones," said he, "champagne is an excellent crea-
ture, and so is sherry. I like them very well in their
way. But they seem to me, in comparison with our
good old Georgia~ drinks, like the dessert to the solid
feast. The nuts are good, the raisins, cakes, and al-
monds; but, after all, my boy, give me a genuine haunch
of venison, a good smoking ham, and a fat turkey, or a
pair of ducks. So with these wines. I acknowledge
champagne to be a fiery, well-bred gentleman; but he
is too uniformly genteel and delicate. I want more
solid argument than he can give me, and so I turn,
when I can, to a sober whiskey-punch, a brandy eock~
tail, or a peach or apple toddy."
"But you can't get any of them here," said Barry,
eagerly.
"Can't I? Leave Tom Nettles alone for finding out
where the weasel sleeps. This fellow Abram, who
serves as a sort of major-domo in the widow's house~
hold-lBy the way, Jones, the widow would suit u
better than the daughter; she's ~a better armfull. Don't
you think so
"She looks well."
"Ay, aDd would wear well, old fellow."

201


"She would, indeed."
"Think of it. It's worth a thought."
"It's too late now."
"What! are you engaged to the daughter?"
"I suppose you may say so. It's as good as that.
I've handed in the letter."
"P-h-e-w! Don't halloo till you're out of the wood."
"But to the liquor. Abram
"Oh, Abram: yes! Well, that Abram's a fellow
after one's own heart; and, whether you marry the
daughter or the widow, I hope you'll give him to me.
reeling the want of the stronger spirit, I said to him:
'Abram, this~'~ is a pleasant fellow, this champagne, to
say a word to at coming and at parting, but he don't
seem to answer so well through a long visit. Now,
haven't you something in the shape of a plain, homely,
sensible old Georgia drink, that won't foam, and hiss,
and sparkle when you speak to it?' Upon which the
fellow whispers to me: 'Old master had a jimmyjohn
of mighty fine peach in the garret, and, since he's gone,
we never uses it.' 'Abram,' says I, 'your master was
a sensible man when alive, and I hope was sensible
enough when he died to go to a place of good spirits.
God bless him, and us. Abram, my lad, can you get
us a look at that jimmyjohn?'"
"'Well?" demanded Barry, somewhat eagerly.
"Well!' Here it is, and here's Abram, and here's
a few fellows like yourself, ready to take a toss at the
tankard."
They had now reached an apartment in the basement
of the building, where a few rude tables sustained a
world of crockery, cups, plates, and glasses, such. as had
already been used above stairs. On one of these tables
stood the ancient demijohn, covered with ~antique dust
and honoring ~cobwebs. Honey, water, cups, and
tumblers were in readiness, and nothing was to be done
but drink. Even the beverage-a sufficient quantity-
had been mixed in anticipation by the judicious Nettles,
and the beaker, that was thrust into Barry's grasp,

glittered to the brim, with equal strength and sweet~.
ness. In the taste of the sweet, he did not recognize
the potency and excess of the strength, and it was'with
a royal mind that he now broke away from the group
of drinkers to continue his search after Geraldine. We
have seen at what moment and under what circum-
stances he found her. As he left Nettles and his
companions, a loud laugh attested the conspira~~y.
"Lie has it," cried Nettles.
"A most mortal shot," said' Dick.
"It'll floor him, sure;" said Ned.
"'Twould floor a~ bullock," muttered Peter; and,
with these calculations, th
their ~rictim. with a view ey all scattered in pursuit of
to watching the results.
Meanwhile, unsuspicious of danger, and with a con-
fidence in himself gradually increasing as the peach
began to "blossom"' in his veins, Jones Barry led his
partner triumphantly to the hail, where the dancers
were rapidly assembling from all quarters. The coin-
pany had begun to thin; the hour was becoming late;
the old people had pretty much departed, except those
inveterate appetizers who will wait through the tedious
rounds of dancing in which they do not share, in order
to partake of the supper, in which they never fail to
insist upon something more than, their share. It is not
every day, with these, that Paddy' kills hi~ favorite
cow, and they make the most of the event when he
does. There they sat or stood about the room, wait-
ing anxiously the close of the last cotillion. Mean-
while, the music sounded merrily, and the dancers
began to vault and whirl. Jones Barry and Geraldine
found themselves confronted by Tom Nettles and Polly
Ewbanks-Polly being the most portly of all the fair
people assembled-as ignorant of the dance as a horse,
and as clumsy as an elephant. But IPolly had a rather
pretty face, and though she felt doubtful of the sort of
display which her legs would make, she was willing to
peril them rather than lose the chance of a market for
her face. With rosy red cheeks, and a rolling, swim-

ming motion, like a great Dutch galliot in a heavy,
swelling sea, Polly went to and Cro, very imperfectly
steadied by the arm, and hand, and counsels of her
partner. "Why the deuce," was the thought of Barry,
"did Tom Nettles choose such a woman for his partner,
when so many so much more comely and compatible
could be had?" But Tom had his reasons. There was
mischief in his eye, only perceptible, however, to his
comrades, one of whom was in the same 'set with our
couple, while the others were eagerly and anxiously
looking on. But Jones Barry had neither the time,
nor was he in the mood, to make reflections. The
peach began to poach upon the territories' of his brain.
He leaped high, he vaulted, whirled, wheeled, clapped
his hands, and at length seemed about to reach that con-
dition of extase in which certain virgins under religious
inspiration have attained, by whicli they can stand upon
the air and dance upon nothing, without the aid of any
unseemly ornaments about the neck. Geraldine began
to be disquieted; but her situation admitted of no ex-
trication. She felt its annoyances the more as she
beheld, at a little distance, the grave, sedate, and cir-
cumspect eye of. Randall Hammond fixed upon the
proceedings. IBut the confusion grew. First, there
was some ~little ~awkwardness in Tom Nettles himself.
lie wheeled to the right when he should have gone left,
and when the figure called him to cross over, he sent
his partner into the arena. She was constantly blun-
dering; but this Jones Barry was now becoming too
happy to perceive. Though a very fair dancer himself,
his errors soon became apparent. Yet he was correct-
ing Nettles all the while
"Wrong,, Tom; to the right about! *Now we go!
how it bja~es! Whoop! She flies! Glorious, Tom;
eli ?" and he strove, while speaking,. to bestow a $igrki-
ficant look with those eyes which were momently be-
coming more and more small. Round. he went, whirling
hi~ partner with him. Round went Tom Nettles, with
hi~ nearly round partner, her enormous sides seeming to

moments, and 4ie event was precisely such as might be
anticipated from the eticounter of the earth with the
tail of the great comet. It was more than a comet's
tail, comparatively speaking, that which overthrew'
Jones Barry; but down he went, his. legs passing com~
pletel~ from under him, and bet~e~n :the' uplifted,'feet
of Polly, e~'eoting that catastrophe ~hich the "mere
jostle with him~ had not Qec~sioned. Pown~ she went
also, in~tlie midst '~f the ring, which spread 'out oni all

THAT night Jones Barry slept at the "Lodge." The.
excellent hostess, who ~but too justly suspected' his eon~
edition, having made the proper inquiries after the' 4ep&amp;r~
ture, of her' guests, soon ascertained where his treache-
rous friend, Nettles, had bestowed, him, and had him
borne to a corofortablechamber. He himself seemed to.
have been unconscious of the transition. it is the tradi-
tion, which Nettles traced up to Abram, that the o~ly
words spoken by him, when disturbed, for removal, were
the same 'which he had last spoken in the ball-room:
"Back to back, Miss I'oliy." ~The next day at ~' late
hour, on opening his eyes, he found Abram in~ waiting.
Coffee and toast were brought him in his chamber~ ; for
his offences were readily forgiven by 'his indulgex~t host-

every opportunity.. He came forth, at nOon, looking
very much ashamed of hinns~lf, with only a confused
recollection of what had taken place. lie said not a

"Perhaps they put too much honey in your peach !"
said the Widow, slyly.
"IL~1each, oh! I' do recollect drinking a little with
Nettles. By the way,. Mrs. Foster, a little of that stuff
it's a fine old liquor,, wouldn't be amiss.
"On the principle," retorted the widow, "so well
known~among yow gay young men, that the hair of the
dog is always good for the bite."
"Ah !" said the offender, "I'm afraid you know every-
thing, Mrs. Foster. You're quite too knowing; yes, you
are!"
"We. know enough to be indulgent, Mr~ Barry.
What say you to the peach ?"
His assent was not, hard to obtain, and while Mrs.
Foster compounded the peach toddy with honey, she
gave' him th~ gratuitous information that " poor dear
Mr. Foster was quite fond of his peach~dram. I made
it f~r him regularly twice a day, Mr. Barry; once about
this hour, and once just before he went to bed."
~"~hat a dutiful wife !" was the reflection of Barry,
as he heard these words, and followed the graceful move-
ments of the ~widow. He remembered the words of Net-
ties: "Not a bad armful, indeed,!" His further reflec-
tions were arrested by her~ presentation of the spoon, as
she' had administered the tea the evening before, but
n&amp;w filled with a very different beverage.
'SHow's 4hat to y~ur liking ?"
"It's the very~ thing. Ah !' you know the way to a
man's 'heart !"
The answeri~ 'to this compliment was arrested by the
suddezi entrance of Geraldine.
"You here, Mr. Barry ?".
"I'm never anywhere else !" said he, quite gallantly.
How are you this morning, Miss Geraldine?"
"1 should rattler ask after your health !" was her
quiet but sarcastic answer. "You were in the chapter
of 'accidents yesterday. How's your head ?"
"Much~ better, I thank you'! If my heart were only
half so well !"

"No! It stays!"
"Then you ought,:by all means~ to 'consult a surgeon.

siniple 'but'r~spectful one. It declared the re~olutiou of
the lady, and forbore all expression of feeling or opin-
ion. He sallied~ off with it to H~mmond. The latter
read it, and 'mentioned that he had also received an
answer to his application, the purport of which was the
same. He did not show the letter, however, and it was
with a secret pleasure that, he remarked a material
difference in the style and wording of the two letters.
While tha~t to Henderson merely declared her determina-
tion, in simple terms, as if written without an effort,
showing the writer .to be comparatively indifferent to
the feelings: which she might provoke, that to himself
w~s distinctly apologetic in its tone. While her requi-
sition wa~ precisely the same in both the letters) she
was here prepared to show something like a regret that it
had been made. "I deem it. right to say," was the
language in one place, "if only in justice to myself,
that it is rather in obedience to a resolution, perhaps
rashly made, bmt' which I must 'still hold inviolate, that
I attach so 'singular a condition and qualification to my
as5ent~ particularly Where, as in the present instance,
the application, as I am well aware, does me' so much
honor..
~This may have 'been ironically said, bnt it was more
grateful to the self-esteem of Hammond to fancy other-
wise: and though vexed and'wondering at the absurdity
of the requisition, it was somewhat grateful to discover
such a decided difference in the language employed in
'Henda~son's letter, and'his own. Besides, he recollected
with feelings of satisfaction the inquiries which the
young lady had made the night previously as to 'the speed
of his horse. All this made it sufficiently apparent to
his vanity 'that she desired his suoc~ss; and yet" the re-
quisUion was not the less offensive to all his ideas of
propriety.
"To 'choose her husband according to the legs of his
hQrse !" said Henderson, with praiseworthy indignation.
"It is astoni~hirig I there is some mystery~about it,"
'said Hammond.

"To put us on the same footing with that 'silly
creature, Barry !" exclaimed the one.
"The mother is at the bottom of it," responded the
jher
"What is to be done ?" cried Hendersot~. "I'll 'be
d-~---~--d if I'll run a race to get 'a wife. If it's in
the heels of my horse that she's, to' find my merits, I
shall be at a loss where to look' for hers."
"Very well said, Miles, and quite spirited. .' ~nt,' as
you s~y, what's' to be done? that's the' question. Now~
I'll tell you what I think. I ~propose to: go and 'see
Miss Foster in person, and to talk the matter over with
her, showing all the absurdities of this requisition, and
the ridiculoi~sness of the position' into which 'it' will
throw all pai~ties. I think she may be persuaded to
hear reason, for Lam disposed' to think that the whole
affair originated with the step-mother. What she pro-
poses to effect by it, uiiless it be merely' to astonish' the
natives-.--a thing grateful 'enough to her silly vanity-.!.
it is impossible for me to conjecture. Now, without
pressing IVliss Foster on my own. account,. I propose
simply to argue the matter with her; to show her how' it
will appear to the public; and endeavor to impress upon
her how uncertain will be the securities of domestic
happiness where the tie is based upon such &amp;~rnditions.
What think you, Miles? Such was my purpose before'
you came.
"Has your mother heard 'of it-have you told'her ?"
"No; and I don't mean ~o tell her; for I know that
she would at once require me to withdraw my proposals.
She would' never forgive~ Geraldine for what she would
regard as an insult."
"And so do I consider it. Bat, as you. say, sh~ may
be led by that woman, her step-mother; who is a~ mi~~

but that quiz, could afford no consolation. The ~nys~-
tery was entirely beyond his' solution. 1ie~ thought the
affair comical "in high degree, and concluded that the
principle once adopted-that of running a race for a
wife-~Would completely revolutionize the concerns of
marriage.
"It would certainly discoixrage me from the attempt
to ehai~ge my condition. II prefer running rigs to run-
ning races; and if I thought ever so much of.a woman, I
shouldn't thank her for admiring the legs oj~ my horse

eztende'd the favorite limbs-showing a handsomely-
turned thigh, calf, and ankle-and stroked them with
the complacency of a bachelor whose frequent escapes
from the snares of the sex have sufficiently shown his
value.
Meanwhile, 'the eyes of the widow Foster beheld our
hero, Randall Hammond, wheel into the' avenue and
come cantering .gently up to the 'entrance of the
"Lodge." She hurried to the chamber 'of Geraldine,
whom she found already acquainted with the fact. She
did not perceive that the countenance of the latter ex-
pressed something like trepidation. She was arraying
herself for theKreception of the guest.

"But I did not mean anything of the sort, sir."
"Then, permit me to say, the case becomes still
'more perilous for yourself, if less offensive to the suitor;
since, if you have a choice, you wilfully subject it to all
the chances of the dice by risking it unnecessarily on
the speed of an animal which may fail, Qf a rider Wh4~
may fall, of a will which may take offence at 50 UIL-

"It appears to me, Mr. Hammond, you describe ~
very feeble passion when you speak of such.".
"By no means, Miss Foster. The passion may b~
as warm and active as it should be-the love unquench-
able and enduring; but the sense of propriety no less
tenacious, and the wholesome laws of principle too
stubborn to give way to any impulses of the heart Un-

chivalry, when the imperious beauty, conscious of her
power upon the heart of a noble knight, threw h'~er glove
into the amphitheatre at the moment when ,~n angry
lion was stalking over it, and motioned to the brave
cavalier to restore itt?"
"And he?"'
"Obeyed her, braved -the lion, recovered the glove,
and restored it to the lady."
"Well! Was it not nobly done ?-"
"Perhaps! In those days stich -follies had a signifi~
cance and merit which they do not possess now. But
there is a sequel to the story."
"Pray tell it."
"The knight who braved the lion for the lady, from
that moment yielded the lady t6 other knights. He
turned away from the reckless beauty who ~euld peril

the life of her lover only to exhibit her power over him;
and the world applauded the desertion, and the beauty
was abandoned by all other knights."
The pride of the maid was touched.
"In this fable, Mr. Hammond, I am to behold a
warning, I suppose."
"A truth-a principle-is a warning, Miss Foster,
to all mankind. In proposing for your hand, I was
prepared to let you see into my whole . nature-my
feelings, opinions, and the principles by wbich I am
governed. I am now dealing with you with the frank-
ness of one who hopes to find a wife in the woman with
whom he speaks. I speak with you unaffectedly. I
would peril my life for you in the moment of necessity,
and joy to do so. I might peril it, as a proud man, at
your mere requisition, or your caprice; but it would be
also at the peril of my esteem for you. There is no
peril in bestriding a blooded horse, and engaging in the
contest you propose; but it endangers self-respept, it
offends public opinion, it degrades the suitor, as it ad-
miTts no difference-except, perhaps, as a jockey-be-
tween him and his competitors, and-"
He paused.
"Go on, sir."
"I almost fear, Miss Foster."
"Nay, sir, you have spoken with little fear, thus far.
You may surely finish."q
"I will! It is only right that I should show the dan-
ger to yourself. It puts the lady in the attitude of one
whose standard depends upon her caprice and whims,
rather than her principles.
"You speak plainly-certainly without fear."
"My dear Miss Foster, I have perilled all my life in
the offer I have made you of my hand. I have every-
thing at stake which is precious. Pardon me, if this
consideration makes me bold, where love, ~alone, would
only make me humble. We are both young, but you
much younger than myself.. You have seen the world
only through the medium of other eyes. It is easy

with the young to err, and seeing thus, to see falselyy
even in the most important interests. I should almost
be disposed to think that, in making this requisition,
against which I beg most respectfully to protest, you
have obeyed any but your own impulses~ Let me en-
treat you to reverse it."
"IReally, Mr. Hammond, you attach a singular im-
portance to a horserace."
"Surely, not so much as you, Miss Foster, when you
are willing to risk all your own happiness upon it."
"It is your pride, sir."
"It is, but I trust not an improper pride."
"I don't know, sir; but my pride too is concerned.
You have been told that I have made a vow. I have
said, to you, that I felt it to be rash, and feared that it
was foolish, but the resolution was taken. I will not
now say whether I do or do not regret it. Enough,
that it is unchangeable."
"Do not say this, I entreat you, Miss Foster; for my
sake! I entreat-~--But no! To you I may be nothing.
For your own sake, then~for your future peace, and
happiness, and hope-do mit peril everything on a re-
solution so utterly unmeaning and without obligation.
It needs but little effort of wisdom to show that truth,
propriety, common sense, all agree to absolve you from
such a vow. Beware how you persist! lit will be fatal."
He rose as he spoke.
"Do you threaten, Mr. Hammond ?"
"Warn! Warn only."

whether it is due more to your notions of principle than
to yo~.ir own feelings of pride, and-"

He took her hand as he ~poke. His eyes were fixed
upon hers imploringly, with an expression of the deepest
interest in her reply. Hers sunk beneath them. The
struggle in her heafr was great, but the whisper of the
evil genius was still i~i her ears.
"It is his pride~ that speaks, anti, you must humble it,

WHAT HAPPENED THEREUPON.
"SHE may whistle for it! I'll never marry a wo-
man who chooses me on the score of my mare's legs
and bottom."
Such was the elegantly-declared resolution of our
now thoroughly indignant Miles Henderson, when
Hammond reported how ill he had sped in his mission
to Geraldine.
"She certainly pays us no compliment."
"Compliment! She* treats us as if one man was
just the same to her as another. Who'd marry a wo-
man on such terms? What man who values his happi-
ness at all will take a wife who don't prefer him to all
other suitors ?"
"Miles ?"
"Well, Ran. ?"
"Geraldine does express this preference."
"How?"
"She knows very well that 'Sorella' can beat Barry's
filly. She has done so. Now, it seems to me that this
must have been in the recollection of Geraldine when
she made the requisition."
"Yes, but 'Ferraunt' can beat 'Sorella.'"
"True, perhaps; but if you will engage in. the con-
flict with Barry, I'll decline it. I'll leave the field to
you."
"No, no, Ran.; that won't do. I sha'n't run at
all. If the lady don't like me sufficiently to answer
'Yes' at once, we're quits. I wouldn't have her now

on any terms.' I think she has treated us most out-
rageously."
"I'm disposed to think her foolish and vexatious
mother's at the bottom of it all, though what she pro-
poses to gain by it, I do not exactly see; yet a thought
strikes me. It's very clear that Mrs. Foster has all
along preferred Barry to either of us. Now, if we
withdraw from the field, he walks the course and takes
the purse. This, perhaps, will be just the thing that
the mother hopes for. That she has blinded Geraldine'
by some artifice, is very possible. Now, I'm 'not will-
ing that' the mother should be 'gratified. I'm disposed
equally to balk her and to punish Geraldine. 'I feel
something of your indignation; and, though' I'm sure
she prefers either of us to Jones Barry, yet I fear she
presumes upon what she thinks our passion for her, to
coerce us With this humiliating. condition. 'She seems
to take for granted that we caiuiot but yield, howeVer
little we may 'relish doing so."
"What's your plan ?"
"To accede to her conditions."
"How, accede 1"
"Yes, apparently at least. We'll write her to that
effect, see Barry, mane the arrangements for the race,
and get all things in readiness."
" Well !"
"It will be easy to throw Barry out-to beat him
after the first mile-and thus defeat the calculations of
'the mother."
"Well!"
"We agree that the wedding takes place the very
day of the race. Let them have the company, let
~them get the parson, let them make the feast, and let

"Ride off as*e came, leaving them to eat the supper,
and marry as 'they can."

whole country:"

"They deserve it! What think you'?"
"It's a sentence! They shall pay the forfeit. The
idea is capital. It'll be a lesson to such people here-
after."
"Then let us proceed about it. What we do We
must do quickly, so that the thing shall not be bloWn
unnecessarily abroad I shall keep it from my mother
if I can; at all ~vents, I must keep from her that I
mean to put in for this prize. To do this, I'll go home
with you, and we'll write and work from your house.
To Barry we must sond to-niorrow~ and have the race
early next week."
The arrangements, as devised, were all made. Barry
was invited to an interview, and readily came into the
arrangements somewhat disappointed, however, to ~nd
'so prompt an acceptance of the conditions, in spite of
the confident predictions of. Mrs. Foster. That good
lady 'was quite as much confounded as anybody else;
but she made the best' of a bad bargain. She encour-
aged Barry to hope; and it was with a confident face
jhat she could now say to her daughter-.
"You see? 'Tis as I told y6u~-yon have only to be
firm, and he submits. This is the way with men, always.
Women yield too readily. Let them only stick out to
the last, and they'll rule in the end."
Meanwhile, the affair got abroad, and was the cause
of no little excitement. The subject is one which still,
to this day, interests the people of t~,he surrounding
country. They call it the "race for a wife." Of
course, it was the crowning event iti the 'history of
Geraldine Foster's eccentricities. They little knew
how small was the share of the poor girl in the~ pro-.
ceeding. Nettles was delighted with th~ affair. Its
novelty charmed him. He did not exactly expect that
Hammond would have engaged in the contest, for he
had quite as high an opinion of that gentleman's pride
of character as was entertained by Mrs. Foster; ~but he
said nothing against it. He told Jones Barry, however,
that the game was all up with him; that the "Fair


224         AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,

Geraldine" stood no chance against either the heels of
"Ferraunt" or " Sorella." "But," he continued, "I
shall be glad to see you beat, for reasons ready
given you. This girl is not the girl for you. Better
the step-mother, Mrs. Foster. She's neither old nor
ugly, and ~he knows what good living is. Besides,
she's a widow, whose gratitude to the man that will
take her off her own hands will make her tolerably sub-
missive. IBut, 'better still, the fat girl, ,Susannah, at
hiram Davy's. corner. She's the good creature, the
sweet laughing armful of happiness, all fat and good-
humor. Even Polly Ewbanks, whom you overthrew at
the ball, would be more suitable, and, for that matter,
she evidently likes you."
"Don't speak of her, the cow! I'll never forgive
her for that tumble, She threw me, thrusting her ele-
phant legs between mine, just when I was caz~orting."
"The boot's on t'other leg, Jones. It was you that
thrust your pegs in the wrong direction, and you did
the mischief. In' truth, Jones, I'm afraid it was more
design on your part than accident."
"I swear to you, Torn, I never designed anything;
but I'm willing to confess that that 'peach' was quite
too much for me, after the sherry and champagne."
"Not a bit of it; but there was a sort of destiny
that~made you and Polly Ewbanks fall together; and,
mark my words, I prophesy that, if ever you marry,
it'll be one Qf the three-Polly Ewbanks, Sukey Davy,
or the widow Foster-and I don't care much which;
though Sukey or Polly, either, ,would make you the
best wife. It's very certain that if Geraldjne Foster
is to be got by running only, you stand no chance
against 'Ferraunt' and 'Sorella.'"
lVl7rs. hammond at length heard Qf the terms of the
conflict, and was shocked at its monstrosities. She at
once appealed t~5 her son in the earnest language of a
mother, to avoid any such competition. He answered
her evasively but satisfactorily, in calm but earnest
language.

"Fear nothing, mother; there is no prospect of my
ever being united' with Miss Foster."
And here the matter rested until the day appointed
for the trial. The three competitors had, itt their
separate answers, agreed upon the terms. They had
also-using a discretion which had been conferred upon
them-concurred in entreating that t~e da~ of the race
should be that of the wedding also. The coinpaiiy were
accordingly invited, and the fleverend Timothy Bind-'
well, of the Presbyterian Church, was entreated to be
present, and made his appearance in his robes of office
at the appointed hour. He was one of those to. whom
it was always agreeable to bring the young together in
the blessed ties of marriage, particularly where the
wedding-supper was apt to be good, and the marriage-
fee a liberal one. his ~xpeetations, on the present'
occasion, were of superior magnitude. It was observed
as an evil sign by Geraldine that *Mrs. Hammond;
though invited, was noV pi'esent when the company was
assembled. She remarked this to her mother, as some-
thing omii~ou~; but the latter had her answer.
"Oh! she no doubt feels as bitter about it as she
can. If her pride could have ruled her son in such a
matter, he had neVer consented to the terms."
"I hardly think that he will consent now."
"How! When we have it in black and white, under
his hands? But dress, my child"-this conversation
took place in Geraldine's chamber-" dress, so as~t6 be
quite in readiness. I'll send Rachel up to help you~"
"Send no one! I'll ring if I want her."
The* mother left the room, and the poor girl, as if
with a presentiment of the mortification w Which she
was destined, sank down listlessly before the window,
looking out upon the long avenue up which the c'om~
petitors were to ascend. How bitter were her reflec-
tions at this moment! How sh&amp; deplored the readiness
with Which she had given ear to her mother's counsels!
and with what warning solemnity did the words and
looks of Hammond, in their last interview, whefi he

came to expostulate, rise to her recollection! She
probably would not have been dressed but for the re-
appearance of Mrs. Foster, who insisted upon her
immediate preparations. She assisted her in making
her toilet, taking care all the while so to speak as to
fortify the pride of the damsel, and excite her spirits
through the agency of her vanity. Pale, but-in the
language of Mrs. Foster-" beautiful as an angel," the
devoted girl was at length prepared for the conflict and
the company. Meanwhile~ let us look after the several
claimants for her hand.
We need not detail the preliminaries, important to
the parties, but not so to us, which were duly arranged
among themselves. Time, place, distance, the signal
for the start, were 'all agreed upon; and at the proper
minute the several competitors, each attended by his
friend, appeared upon the ground. Tom Nettles offici-
ated on the part of Jones Barry, who' had i~ fact be-
come a sort of dependent upon the superior judgment of
that humorist, and never failed to seek him on every
emergency. Henderson and ilammond were attended
by two young men, whom it is not important to introduce
more especially to c~ur readers. The word was given,
and the three steeds leaped off most beautifully together,
but had not~run a hundred yards before the "Fair Geral-
dine," as if fearing the loss of her good name in such
'formidable rivalry~, or frightened by some unusual object
along the roadside, suddenly bolted into the woods, tak-
ing' rider through bush and through brier, a formidable
chase, which, but for his frequent practice as a fox hunter,
'would have certainly endangered his neck. When the
unfortunate Barrysucceeded in reining in his capricious
beauty, who seemed disposed to emulate her namesake,
he found l~is competitors clean gone out of sight, and
himself hopelessly distanced. Tie gave up the, chase
entirely, and, cantering out into the open track, came
forth just as ~Nettles, and the two other bottle-holders,
were riding forward to the "Lodge." lie joined them,
and, putting~ the best air upon his defeat possible, he

told them how it happened. The two friends of Ham-
mond and Henderson condoled with him like men of
proper gallantry; but Nettles openly congratulated him
upon the event.
"The hand of fate is in it, Jones. You are destined
for Polly Ewbanks, Sukey Davy, or the widow. I'm
glad of it. This jade is too high-necked for you, and
would have ruined you forever as a good fellow."
Thus talking, they wheeled into the avenue. Mean-
ivhile, let us hurry to the "Lodge," 4~nd see how things
are working there. Geraldine had not long descended
to the parlor, and was in the midst of salutations and
congratulations innumerable and inconceivable, when
the cry rose from the piazza-." They are coming! 'They
are coming!" This occasioned a rush. The bride was
deserted, and with a strange sinking of the heart, she
crouched, rather than reclined, on the sofa, leaving it
to others to report the conflict, which she no longer
had the courage to behold. Mrs. Foster was the first to
bounce into the piazza as she heard the cry. Parson
iI3indwell placed himself along-side of her, and the seve-
ral groups, according to relationship or intimacy, ranged
themselves in near neighborhood. The banisters were
thronged, two long benches were filled with crowding
forms,' and several stood. upon chairs dragged for the
purpose from the parlor. Poor Geraldine hearkened
breathlessly to the murmurs and the cries from without.
"The sorrel has it!" cried one.
"And now the iron 'gray !" cried another.
"But where's Barry? Where's Barty ?" was the
impatient inquiry of Madam Foster.
"Distanced!" was the answer from one of the party,
"as I always said he would be."
It was evident there were but tWo horsepien, ~nd these'
were Hammond and Henderson.~ The race was evidently
a close one. Approaching in front, the spectators could
see no inequalities in their speed, and opinion was kept
in a constant state of fluctuation as they advanced.
"Now they come! They coma with a rush!"

"No,,' Ferraunt I'"
"It's hard to say which!"

At these words, Geraldine could bear the suspense 'no
longer. She darted to her' feet, rushed to the door-way
just in season to behold the two horses, lock and lock,
wheel before the entrance; while the riders, waving and
kissing their hands to the company, and bowing their
heads, darted away at the same speed in the opposite
avenue leading up the road, and were lost to sight in
a moment.
"What does that mean ?" demanded the parson.

such was the verdict, gravely delivered, of those who
had most closely watched the cohfliot. But where were
the competitors? Where was he who had triumphed,
an&amp; to whom the trembling prize was to be awarded?
Geraldine did tremble, but it was with a joy which spoke
out in her bright eyes, and played in a sweet smile upon
~ier pouting lips. But why did not Hammond appear?
What could be the meaning of that reverential bow, that
wave of the hand, asthe riders continued on their course;

Barry and Nettles, with their companions, made their
appearance. The misfortune of the former was soon

he had sipped his tea and toddy at her hands, tQ~reproach
him, as W0i1 as she could, for his accident and defeat.

by Nettles, that there was really something quite lov-
able in the widow. It was while they sat together that

eyes dilating in anger, her whole appearance that of in-

dignation almost rising into fury. She held a crumpled
paper to her mother, which had once been a neatly-folded
billet.
"' See to what I am brought b~r your counsel!"
The mother read. The note was from Hammond to
Geraldine. It ran thus :~
"Mr. Hammond presumes that curiosity, as to the
respective speed of his and other horses, alone, prompted
the singular requisition of Miss Foster, and that she had
no serious design of making such performance the con-
dition of a 'solemnity so vital' to her happiness as~ that of
marriage. Mr. Hammond has done his 'best to graitify
'her curiosity, and should be sorry to avail himself of'the
result to~the prejudice of Miss Foster. He accordingly
begs leave to release her from' anysupposed obligations.

CHAPTER XIX.
FIST~L5 FOR TWO- j~HE DUEL.

Jorn~s BARRY was greatly elevated by his new com-
mission. His vanity was~ immediately tickled by' being
adopted as the champion of the fair. He, had heard
something of the days and institutions of chivalry, and
he felt all over knight-errantish. It was not that he de-
sired to shed blood, for he was, in fact, rather a kind-
hearted creature; but to be somebody, and to be moving
always conspicuously in some one's eyes, was sufficiently
grateful to make 'him lose' sight of all other matters.
Full of fight, he hurried at once to Tom Nettles, to whom
he laid bare all the particulars of his situation.
"It's d-~d strange V' said Nettles; '.' and yet I
don't know. To touch a woman on that point is to run
into the quick with a rusty gimlet. I suppose, since
you've pledged yourself to the lady, you'll have to chal-
lenge; but Ran. Hammond Will blow you into splinters.
He's a dead shot at a shingle."
"A shingle's not a man; and I can shdot too. The
question is, Tom, will you see to this business for me
"Oh, certainly 1"
'"Well, ride over to Hammond this morning, make
the arrangements, and, after that,' come and give me
some practice at the distance."
"Very good. I'll rida round to your house from
Hammond's in time for diiiner, and we'll make a night
of ~t. 'It's no time for ~practice after dinner, so we'll
leave that for uiext morning at, sunrise.
This being agreed on, Nettles at once proceeded with
the challenge, which was peremptory, to Hammond. It
must, not be forgotten that the bearer of this letter was

'I

a great admirer of Hammond. Nettles only amused
himself ~with Barry, and did not respect him.
"Why, Nettles 1" said Hammond, "how can I go out
with this foolish fellow? The thing is ridiculous. He
is the laughing-stock of the country. A goo&amp;meaning;~
harmless creature enough, but one whom f should be
sorry to think of raising to my level. As a general rule,
I have resolved to fight 'anybody that makes a demand
on me, if only to prevent annoyance from persons who are'
always to be 'found anxious to make for themselves a
capital of courage out of your reluctance. But I should
be afraid of the ridicule 'which would' attach to a formal
combat with one so utterly silly and ridiculous as Barry."
"Well! there'e some danger of that, I confess; but
we'll keep the thing as quiet' as possible."'
"You can't keep it quiet. His vanity will never suf-
fer him to sleep until he succeeds in making everybody
know that he is a champion for the lady."
* "Some~ danger of that; but the truth is, IRan., the
fellow is resolved on it; and when that's the ease he can
annoy you quite as effectually, and perhaps make' the
ridicule much more successful, than it would be if you
were to meet him. If you say you won't meet him, why,'
I shall give up the business; but, in his present temper,'
he'll only seek somebody else, who will be very apt to
follow it up, ,and vex you into' it at last. Now, I have
a plan by which' to shift the ridicule to the proper
shoulders." '
He whispered his scheme to Hammond, who heard
him with a dubious shake of the head.
"If I am to go out," said he, "I should prefer to do
so with a serious resolution. I should never wish to
trifle in such'nlattrs."
Nettles had his 'arguments, and, without being con-
vinced, Han~~mond consented that his decision should
be referred to Miles' Henderson, whoni 'he' made 'his
sense-keeper, as well as friend, on the' occasion. The
two rode ~over~ together 'to Henderson's," and 'the 'whole
affair was submitted to him. Hammond, as, in duty

* bound; put himself in the hands of his friend, and the
subtle Nettles found it much' more easy to impress the
latter than the former with the propriety of his scheme,
whatever that may have been. At present, its purport
is concealed from us. Henderson, indeed, was greatly
tickled' with it, and Hammond,. still doubting,. was corn.-
pelled to submit.
"it'll be rare ~port,~R~n. We shall have the laugh
to ourselves.~ Let him get the lady if, he can, but, at
all events~ gfte him a mighty bad scare. I know Jones
well. ile's got as soft a heart as arxylody in the worid~
with all his 1 luster and conceit, and if we don't make
him run. f~r it, my name's not Nettles."
Hammond, it iau~t be confessed, did not altogether
relish the cool and philosophical manner with which the
other was prepared. to consign the lady to the arms of
her champion. lie still felt a deep sympathy with Ge-
raldine, though sh~ had greatly mortified his pride, and
it was only with the conviction that her conduct had
been dictated by a total indifference to his claims, that
he was reconciled to yielding her up without.~ farther
struggle His' mind was distracted by lurking doubts
of this same indifference, and was continually recalling
the numerous little instances in her conduct which had
encouraged 'him in the belief that she really had a pre-
ference for him~; but these impressions he had been
comiielled to discard, however unwillingly, in the more
recent events which we have described. But her
beauties were more deeply engraved upon~ his imagina-
tion than he had been willing~ to believe, and he now
listened to her final surrender with a secret sense of'
pain, of which he was thoroughly ashamed. The plan
arranged between Nettles ~and ilenderson for the duel
was such as he could not approve of, and he only sub-
mitted to it as one accustoms himself, in such cases, to
submit to the conclusions of his friends, evei~ where he
deems them unwise. it is a matter of punctilio which
decides many such affairs, in defiance of the deliberate
judgment of nearly all the parties. But upon this head

we need not dila~te. Enough that Nettles went off with
an acceptance of his challenge. In three days the par-
ties were to meet. Time, place, distance, and all' ~he
particulars. were fully agreed on between the two
seconds, and they proceeded-one of them, at least.-.
to put their principals in training. Barry, not a bad
~hot before, was practiced every day; at frequent periods,
until he could snuff a 'candle.
"You're now as good a shot," ,said Nettles, "as'you
need be; you can snuff a candle at ten paces.~~
"Ain't that famous shooting ?"
"Yes; but I've seen Ran. Hammond divide a firefly
upon the wing!"
Nettles had his own mode of encouragement, truly,
and possessed the art, in high degree, of warming and
cooling his patient in the same instant-as in Russia,
they tell us, a fellow is taken smoking out of the
vapor-bath and rolled over and lover in a mountain of
snow-and all with the' view to reactions Nettles was
never more happy than when he could exercise the
nerves of our friend Barry with such pleasant ' contra-
dictions. As soon as the duel had been determined
upon, and the preparations made, Jones Barry' pro~
needed to report progress to the lady whose battle he
espoused. Mrs. Foster, we are pleased to state, was
now entirely opposed 'to the affair; but Geraldine's
anger continued. She had few words; but these 'were
all vindictive and wrathful. She'thanked Barry for
his zeal, and renewed the assurance that, with the Thil
of Hammond, he should have her hand. Nothing was
said of ~his own fall;' but, of course, in that event, the
hand could be of no use' t'o him. Before the parties
separated, Geraldine drew h~m aside.
"Mr. Barry, I must be present at this meeting.".
"You, Miss Geraldine?"
"Yes,' I must see it. I must 'see him fall !"
"But how? We have but two friends on each side
present."
"I care nothing for your fantastic forms.. I must be

must manage it that I shall be hidden in the neighbor-

"]3ut,~, Miss Geraldine-p"
"Oh! It's strange, it's unreasonable, it's unnatural.
F know all that But I must and will be there. Tell
me, will you arrange it?"
His answer was a compliance, and he kept hi~ word.
Concealed in a neighbo~ring.c~pseGeraldine Foster was
present when the duel took place. ~he had contrived
to get away from the "ILodge" without her mother's
knowledge9 The place of meeting was at a spot, about
three miles off from it, well known to th'~ combatants of
the neighborhood as "2Pistol Quarter." flere, on a
pleasant afternoon, not ten days after the equestrian
contest for our damsel, the same parties met to decide
a more formidable issue. The preliminaries for a duel
are n~ually very much alike in all cases, and ~they were
not departed from in the present instance. Nettles, for
once in his life, seemed thoroughly serious. Lie pro-
ceeded to~ hi~ duties with the air of a man who antici-
pated the worst, To Barry he said, while placing him-
* "You look quite too fierce and vindictive, Barry.
I am afraid you have bloody feelings. I trust you 'will

"I am Sworn to kill him," was the stern response.
"Then God have mercy on his soul and yours! Should
be entertain a like feeling, you will both be at 'Cedar
Mount' (the' graveyard) before to-morrow night."
Thus saying, he placed his man, and after the lapse
of a Cew seconds, the signal words were given: one---~
two-.~three!. The sharp fire followed, almost instantane-
'.~ ously. For a moment, both parties appeared erect, but,
on a sudden, Hammond was seen to totter and" to fall
right forward.
"The bullet i~ through his heart!" was 'the hurried
'speech; of Nettles to his principal. 'To your horse, at
once, Jones, and be off as fast as Heaven will let you.
It's all over with him."

"Is he dead?-.-.-have I killed him?" was the demand

"Oh! God have mercy! I'm a murderer!"
"IBegone!" and with the words he pushed the paTh

that he claimed to be privy himself to the affair; 'and,

shouting hi~ best, and full in the face of the fire of the
red skins? Jest then, when we were all beginning to
feel squeainish~ he was going ahead, and whooping, with~
Qut a bit of scare in. him. Well, that encouraged us.
We saw the Ingins aim at him, and I reckon his rags
had the marks of more than a, dozen bullets; but he
didn't seem to mind 'em, and they sartainly never one
of thorn troubled him. Away he went, shouting and
shaking hi~ musket, and away we went after him, and

may say, into the arms of the Ingins, without hearing
their rifles; and I do believe, as I am a free white man,


238         AS GOOD AS A COMEDY: OR,

that he scared them a gr~at deal worse than our whole
Tennessee regiment. For, look you, he was a man to
sca e people. He was, as J tell you, in rags from head
to foot. He had been living among the briers, run-
ning into, them almost at -every sound. He had no
covering for his head. His eyes were bloodshot; his
Lace scratched over, and bleeding-on all 8ide~; and his'
hair had~grown ha;lf white in twenty days. He looked
for all the world like a madman. He was a madman;
and, though he fought with us, and, marched with us,'
and did everything pretty much as he saw u~ do, yet
his seflses, I'm mighty sur~e, were, all the time; more
than a hundred miles away. Somehow, the poor fellow
got in with me. We marched together and slept to-
* gather. I reckon he saw that I was a good-natured
chap, and so he tuk to me. I soon saw that he was
miserable-that there was a scare that was gnawing in
him all the time-and after awhile I found- out that he
was haunted constantly by the ghost of -Randall 11am-
mond. One night he ran out of the tent with a terrible
fright. Another time, when standing with a -sentry, he
fired his ~iece~ and gave the alarm to the whole army.
Then he'd. fall upon his knees and bog for mercy, and
cover his eyes with his hands, as if to shut out some
frightful thing he - couldn't bear to look upon~ Some-
times he'd run into the hammock at midnight, tiever
fearing the Ingins, though we all thought it as much as
one's life was worth to go near it. - It was the dead he
was afraid of all- the time. Now, there was a sodger-
among the rig'lars to whom Jones Barry one night made
confession and eased his heart of all its secrets. But
it didn't ease him of his misery. The soldier came -to
me and told me all, and I ax'd Barry; but then he was
shy, and swore that he never told the fellow any such
thing. - But it wasn't more than twenty~f'our hours-after,
when-he come to inc and said-
"-'I can't stand it much longer. I'm- almost crazy
now. Ran. ilanimond comes to me every night. I'm

self up.

till we're mustered out of service, I'll go along with.

at you, as you at him."
"'Yes! but I thirsted for his blood, and he never did
me any harm.' lie was a good man too! I must go
back. I will deliver myself. I see him every night,

from our commissariat, and w~nt off like gentlemen sob

under the table. We -slept in the same room, ~nd as
soon as I could slip on my breeches I made after him.
He swore that the ghost of Hammond sqn~tted down at
the foot of the bed, and looked over into his face, though
he tried to cover with the quilt. 'I told him 'twas the
hot supper that gaveAhim the nightmare, and I 'm~de
him take a pretty deep swallow of apple-toddy, that the
landlord made for us, after we routed him up with ~uoh
a scrimmage. Well, so we went; now better, now ~worse;
now calm, and now stormy, till we got ~pretty nigh his
county, where all' these things took place. Then his
scare came back to him, then his heart failed him; and
just when the ghost stopped troubling him, he began to
be troubled by the fear of the lavr~ But I said to him-
"'Be a man. You've come so far, see it out. Better
be hung and have it over, than to be scared to ~1eath
every night.'
"He groaned most bitterly, but he said, ' You'reright!
I can't stand to suffer as 'I have suffered. I'm only

"And so ~we went forward. It was a most. sweet and
beautiful afternoon when we came into the'very' neigh-

places that were famous in his recollection. There was
Hullabee racecourse, where they had the ~gander-pulling,
and the circus, and 'soon we drew nigh to 4he groat
avenue leading to the 'Lodge,' where the y&amp;ung lady
lived that had been the cause of all the iuischidf~ / But
it wasn't 'there that Barry wanted 'to go. The ~flmt
place he wished, to strike for was the' farm of his 'friend
Nettles, and we 'Were only 'a half a mile from ~it, acoord-
ing to Barry's calculations, when we came, ~bya sudden
turn in the road, upon a buggy dra~Vn by a splendid

horse, and carrying two people. ~On~e of them 'was a tall
and noble-looking gentIeman~ and the '6th~ ~was a most
beautiful lady, perhaps about the most beautiful' I ever
did see. They were coming right towards us at a 8mart
trot~' and, the moment Barry laid eyes fairly. iip6n~ them,
he turned pale as death, and dashed his horse into the
bushes and off the road. I followed after him as soon
as I could get a chance, but not till I had taken a good
look at the strangers that seemed to frighten him so
much. They rode by in a minute, and the gentleman
gave me a civil bow as he passed. Then I pushed into
the woods after Barry. I found him off his horse and
hiding in the bushes, all over covered with a sweat, and
trembling like a leaf in the wind.
"'Why, what on airth,' says II, 'is the matter now?
What has, scared you so?'
"'Didn't you see him?'
"' 'Who?"
"'Hammond! 'Twas his ghost in the buggy!' -
"'And what has his ghost to do in a buggy, I wonder?
and who ever saw the ghost of a buggy before?' said II.
'I don't believe much in. such a notion, and if that was
Hammond's gho'~st, I wonder what woman's ghost it was
sitting along-side of him. If woman ghosts are so
pretty, I shouldn't be much afraid of 'em myself.'
"'Woman!' said Barry, mightily bewildered. 'Was
there a woman with him?'
"'Yes, as surely as there was a buggy and ~ man.
Now look you, Barry; if that was Hammond in the
buggy, he's just as much alive as you and me. The
chance is, after all, that ybu only wounded him, aud
you and your friend took a mortal scare too soon'
"'No! no!' said he, very mournfully; 'haven't I
seen him almost every night? hasn't he followed me
everywhere ?-into the woods, into the swamps, into the
hammock of the Ingins? and aiii't my head gray with his
coming?'
"'I don't know,' says I; 'but if that was fiammond
in the hu~gy, he's no ghost; and it's your conscience

~Nettles winked to the prostrate man, and made certain
motions which, strictly construed, might be supposed to
mean, "Take h.er at her word, marry her on the spot ;"
and the looks and signs of' Hendersn, now thoroughly
cured of his passion, were equally significant to tHe same
effect. But Hammond was superior to the temptation.'
"Nay, Geraldine, you are deceived. I am in no dan-
ger; indeed, I am unhurt."
She started as if to rise, but he now restrained her,
and, koking to his friends, motioned their departure.
"What does this mean.?" she demanded.
~" Hear me patiently, Geraldine, and let me plead in
turn for your forgiveness. ~t ~neans a foolish hoax, in
,which nobody ever dreamed that you would be a party.
I am unwounded, :and the ~object has been simply to
scare the foolish person who, without provocation, has
sought my life."
'~' Without. provocation, Mr. Hammond? Do you
forget the cruel insult you put upon me? Was it no
provocation .to shame a young maiden before all her
friends and people? Oh, Hammond, how could you do
me so~..-you, for ~hom. I showed but too much prefer-
ence from the beginning, in spite' of all that my ~mother
would say ?"
~" Will you suffer me to repent, Geral'dinQ.-~o make

was rotjnd about her waist, and his lips were pressed
npqn hers, and alone in that haunted ~wood, famous for
its' many murders, the. twO were .belrothed with all the
dearest'promises of love., We need not follow the pro-
gre~s ~of. the scene. Enough t~. say that the persons
whom Ba1rry and his friend, from 2Tennessee encountered
in the ~buggy, were Mr. and 'Mrs. Hammond~ They
had been filly' three months married, and were living
very cofrifo~tably' together at the residence of 11am-
mond's mother; while Mrs. Foster, vexed to the heart,
was chewing the cud of disappointment at the "Lodge"

alon&amp; All these facts were gathered from~ Torn Net-
tles, who very frankly declared his agency ~n the pro-
ceedings.
"I'm blowed," said the Tennesseean, "if I was
Barry, if I wouldn't have, a real fight~ on the' strength
of it, and I'd make you my mark, my man."
But Barry himself shook his head.
"I've had enough of killing," said he.
"I can. ~put you in the way of something better,," 8aid
Nettles.' "Folly E'wbanks. is still alive, single, and fat
as ever; Sukey Pavy still' keeps the bar at 'the old man's
cOrner; and' Mrs. Fosterlooks as well as I have eyer
seen her, and 'keeps. a most excellent table. I'm will~rig
to make amends; Joiies, for' what harm I"re done you,
by doing you finally 'for better or 'worse.' Now, 'if
there's a man to manage either of these three pre.tty~

"Or, 'Is it to your liking, sir'?'
" Devil !"
"Or, 'Is it more. of the honey or more of the 'peach,
dear 1Jh'~ Barry?'"'
The Tennesseean lingered a week among, his. new
friends, and became so much enamored of Nettles that
he asked him home with him. But the latter, born for
the use of his neighbors, had a eommission~in hand 'for
Barry that was somewhat urgently pressed. His hints
~had not been' wholly thrown away~. and Barry, among
his latter-day reveries, was frequently and pleasurably
entertained by the recollection of tha~t ou~ of tea~' and
that bowl of toddy, by which the widow Foster had re~
freshed him in the'little baok room of her domicik He
remembered her round, well;proportior~edi figure, the
sw~ect. smile upon her face, the pleasant' sparkle in her
eye, and the grateful beverag~ in her hand;~ and 'he so
earnestly pressed his ruminations and convictions on hi~
friend Nettles, that the latter posted off one pleasant
afternoon to the "Lodge," and did not return home

~unti ~the nest day. He was; as usual, received ia~ the
kindest ni~nner. by the widow.. He had always been
solicitous of her favor, on the score of his just apprecia-
tion of her'dinners and eVening, p~irti&amp;s. If Nettles had
~ Wea~kne8S at all, it lay in. his passion for the creature
comforts. He had always~ taken care to please her
accordingly, and she was always glad to welcome him.
He was a good eoinp~anion, who picked up all the scandal
going, and was. ever ready for any mischief. We~will
suppose that, when the hour came foir the evening meal,
he found ~nd ~enjoyed a delightful supper. The widow
was unusually 'fresh ami attractive.. She had stolen off
soon after his arrival, leaving him to adjust ihis six-feet
upon the sofa, while she consulted her toilet.' She re-
~turned. ju~st as he 'was emerging from his 8iesta, looking
1ike~ Cleopatra, except that 'her dimensions were not so
great, ~her skin: so dark, nor 'her 'jewels quite so magni-
ficent as those of that famous queen of Egypt..
"Really, Mrs. Foster, you grow younger and more
fascinating ever5r time I see you."'
These gallant words accompanied a graceful taking
and s~n&amp;eiing of the fair 'l&amp;dy's hand. "' There is one
thing, however, which I think faulty about you."
"Faulty 1" in ~onsternation.
"Yes, faulty I 'and ',the fault is in, your mind, your
'feelings, ~your thoughtss, your 'sentiments."
'A'1nd~ed, Mr. 'Nettles V' bewildered.
"' Yes; 'madam! it consists in your contentment; in'
that cold disdain oi' humanity~; in that scornful indiffer-

foolisk virgins thut were unprepared at the coming, of
the bridegroom."
"Yes, sir! but 'even were I to allow that, there is still
another difficulty. The' bridegroom does not happen ~so
frequently in a~ widow's chances that she can change
her solitary condition when she pleases; and, unless
there is a prospect Df his coming, what's the- policy of
her admitting that she finds her solitude unpleasant?"
"Mrs. Foster, many a man would WOO if the lady
would only coo; but men, you are aware, are naturally
modest."
"Oh, Mr. Nettles!"
"They are, madam! they are! It is the woman al-
ways that is' the tempter, and naturally enough. If we
put a very high estimate on her value, we are apt to.
feel that 'we fall ~below it, and we approach her rather
with a sense of her superior, merits and position than of
our passion, though it may burn us up all the while.
Now, a case happens at this moment to my knowledge,
and I must say that' you are interested in it.".
"Me,'sir!"
"Yes, Mrs. Foster, you! I know a gentleman who
feels for you a' most profound passion, but who dares
riot-
"Nay, Mr. Nettles! what have you ever seen about
me that should repel or discourage any gentleman ?"
and the lady smoothed down the folds of her dress, and,
smiling sweetly, inclined somewhat to the speaker.
"The beautiful crocodile !" thought ~Nettles, to him-
'self; " she evidently suspects me of being %this bashful*
gentleman. What ~a harpy !"
But, though thus thinking, he never~suffered his eyes
to breathe any but an expressionn of tender interest and
regard~ Still, fearing that she might assume too much,
as Nettles never deceived himself in" the opinion tha't he
was a very personableinan. and likely to prove quite too
attractive for most women, he hurried'forward ;t~ a full
revelation of his object, and of the' person in whose be-
half he came. He had his own way of doing this.

"Mrs. Foster," said he, gravely, "you have certainly
shown yourself to be the most remarkable of women. I
have seen 'you. for six months working busily to procure
for another the devotion which was all the while over-
flowing £er yourself."
"Really, Mr. Nettles, you speak pa~ables. What
are you driving at ?"
"Let me explain. ~ou 'will do me the justice to
admit that if anybody knows the people of this county,
man woman, hoyden and hobby-de-hoy, 'i~ is myself."
"Granted, sir!"
'~ "Some of these have been accustomed to consult me
'~ in the most important matters. Among these persons
is my friend Jones Barry. You partially took him out
of ~my hands, but you played your hands badly. You
perversely tried to persuade him that he was desperately
in love with Miss Geraldine-~"
"Don't speak of that young lady in my hearing, I beg
you, Mr. Nettles !"
"Pardon me; but I can't. help it; it's necessary to
what I've .got to 'say. But I'll not 'dwell upon it. Well,
a~ I tell you, at the very time that you were doing your
best, against nature and yourself, to force this belief 'into
biB heart, the 'poor fellow was devotedly attached to an.-
'other."
"'Indeed! You surprise me, sir."
"Such wa~ your powerful influence&amp; over him, that
'you could persuade him to 'anything; and, yielding to
your seeming wishes and opinions, he 'professed attach-
ment to your step-daughter, while his heart was all the
time ready to burst with a; passion for yourself."
"For me, sir? Jones Barry fond of me
"To devotion-ito distraction; and how you 'could be
so blind. as not to have seen it, passes my iii~agination.
How soften has he consulted witk me on this very' sub-
ject!' How oftenha~e I told him, C Come out hue' a man,
'and tell her what you feel!' His' only answer was:
'No! "She doesn't think of me. ft's evident she thinks
only of the marriage of *Geraldine. She will never

'marry again. Her heart's in the grave with Foster!'
Then he would weep, and say: 'I must marry Geraldine,
if it's only to be near to her!"'
"Poor Jones! and how he concealed it!"'
"Concealed it? No, madam, it was only from 7/0U7
eyes that he concealed it. It Wasn't his art in hiding;
* it was your blindness in' not seeing. Why, the night of
the fete, he said to me that, when you fed him with tea
from the cup, while he satinn a chair in your little back-
room, he thought he should overflow with delight, and
the next day, when you mixed him some peach toddy, he
said, 'coming from your hands, it was the most delicious
dram that ever his lips had tasted.'"
"Dear Jones, and he felt all this?"'
"All this, and was silent!"
"And I was doing n~iy best 'to force him upon ~one
who didn't care a straw for him."
"Suicidally, as I called it; for, aslsaid to him, you
are evidently made. for' each other."
"You said that, Mr. Nettles? Ah! you're a sharp~
sighted person."
"Says I,," Barry! Foster is young and lovable.
She's scarcely older tha r step-daughter. She's un-
selfish. She sees that you are the man to make G~ral-
dine happy, because she, feels that you would make her-
self so; and she ought~ not to be permitted to sacrifice
herself. Go to her, tell her the truth, lay your whole
heart open to her, and my life on it, she will then dis-
cover what, perhaps, she does not yet see, that you
have taken a deeper hold on her own heart than she
has, any idea. At her, like a man ~ and,' if she be the
tender-hearted woman that I think her, she will not~
reject you.'"
The widow sighed deeply. "But he did not 'follow
your counsel?"
"He 'did not believe me. His fears ~bhin4ed him.
He worshipped, you too devotedly. Had he felt, a weaker
passion, he would have been more bqld. But his heart
failed him, and he would have 'suffered himself to~ be

regular army, hoping to be killed in the first engage-
ment."
"But he' must never do 'it."
"It will depend on you. He is at' my house waiting.
I have agr~edithat, if I am successful, I am t6 wave a
white handkerchief, and if not, a red one, just as I get

it'd for you, my dear Mrs. Foster, to' determine his
fate."
"Oh! Mr. Kettles, you see ~oo deeply into the hearts
of us poor women to doubt what must 'be 'my answer.
Poor, dear Barry, I always was fond of him. But I
never thought he had any feeling for me, and so I tried
'only to get for' him' that disobedient girl."
"What blindness! And so
"'Oh !' you do with me what you please, Mr. Nettles.
It's a wonder' you never married yourself. You're
single only because you never wished to be otherwise."
"' Ah! you flatter me, Foster! But I must ,resign
my hopes and wishes to ethers. I live for myfriends
only. But, in giving. them up, I have' my consolation;
and when carrying off the heart of a lady to.~nothcr, I
am privileged, as a matter of course; to take her ~kisses

The' widow 'did not struggle seriously against the
spoliation"~which followed this pretty speech.
Barry will be the happiest man alive."
"But have you' a white handkerchief with you? I

see that you use4a red one," demanded the provident
widow.
"Indeed I have not !" said Nettles, feeling in. his
pockets, and looking disquieted.
"Take mine, dear Mr. Nettles. Poor Barry, he
must not be suffered to throw himself away !"
* How Nettles chuckled as he left the "Lodge !" In
'less than a month, the widow became Mrs. Barry. We
have no reason to suppose that her husband repented
the proceeding, and we know that Nettles did not. He
usually took his Sunday dinner at the "Lodge," and
was master of ceremonies on all occasions. He himself
never married. Why should he, when he could so easily
persuade his friends to do so? Miles Henderson, in
the course of the year, was caught by Henrietta Bailey,
one of the girls of whom Mrs. Hammond thought so
much; and he lived sufficiently happy with her to feel
no repinings at the sweet and singular affection which
existed between Hammond and his wife. lie, it is true,
remained the master, but she exercised, though she did
not assert, all the authority of the mistress.' There
has been no duel at "Pistol Quarter" since the famous
affair that terminated the tragic part of our comedy.
