them with a vitality which fiction only can conft~r. It is. in pur-
suit of this object t at we entleat the reader to suppose the back-
ward curtain with rawn, unveiling, if only for a. moment, the
aspects of a perio not so remote as to lie wholly beyond our
sympathies. We propose to look back to that dawn of' the six-
teenth century; at all events, to such a portion of the historical
landscape of that eriod, as to show us some of the first sunny
gleams of Europe n ligl'~t upon the savage dominions of the
Western Conti.nen. To ~'eview this epoch is, in fact, to survey
the small but im re~sive beginnings of a wondrous drama in
which we, ourselves , are s ill living actors. The scene is almost
within our grasp. The ames of the persons of our narrative
have not yet cease from sounding in our ears; and the theatre
of performance is c~ 'ic, the boards of which, even at this moment,
are echoing beneal~h th&amp; mighty footsteps. Our curiosity and
ijiterest may well l~e awa ened for awhile, to an action, the fruits
of which, in some egree, re inuring to our present benefit.
It is just three h ndred years, since, in the spring season of the
year of Grace, on thous nd five hundred and thirty-eight, the
infant city of Hay na re wounded with the tread of one of the
noblest bodies of S anish rivalry that ever ~et foot in our West-
ern hemisphere. - at g y and gallant cavalierr, Hernando De
Soto-equally the ourtie and the soldier-having won wealth,
no less than fame,~ under Francis Pizarro in Peru, had now re-
solved upon an ind~pende t enterprise, in another region, for him-
self. This enterprise, in the extravagant expectations of that
peri&amp;T; promised tL be o~ even n~ore magnificent results than
those of his grea predecessor and companion, already distin-
guished by his soy reign ~s the Adelantado of Florida.
Florida-that ondro s terra incognita, which, for so long a
time, led the Euro ean' agination astray-our ambitious cava-
lier, was ~iow busi d in making the grandest preparations for its
oonque~t. A. tho sand soldiers, many of whom were of the

and thus it was that he bri~f interval during which our adven-
turers lingered in the ~sland, after reaching it from Spain, passed
like a dream of encha~rtment-one of those fairy tales of pleasure
that '~e read of in tl~e romances of Arabia. But the time was
fast approaching wher~ these gay scenes of pleasure-the relaxa-
tions and the mimicry of war-were to give place to its absolute
and hard realities. ~e arrangements oP our adelantado were at
length nearly completed. The ships had taken in most of their
stores, and two of t~em had been already dispatched with the
view to a better exploration of the coast of Florida, and in search
of a fitting harbor foi~ the dc~scent of The armament. But a few
weeks-perhaps day~~would elapse, and the little city would
sink into its ancient dullness and repose. The sad thought of
separation from such delights as had been enjoyed by all parties,
could only be diss pated by renewed efforts at enjoyment.
(~loomy reflections ere o~ily to be banished by fresh indul-
gences; and, duly, a the time lessened for delay, the plans and
schemes for pleasure were hurriedly increased. The young dam-
sels of Cuba put fo th all their attractions to arrest the fugitive
hearts whose heroic~ fences had but too much touched their
own; and more thar~ one brave cavalier was found to hesitate as
the time drew nigh fpr his departure. His imagination painfully
contrasted the pleasures which he enjoyed, with the toils and
perils which were in prospect. Care and anxiety naturally fol-
lowed such comparisons; and, though the sports of the island were
not forborne until the armament had fairly taken its departure,
yet were they felt t~ be rrjore or less deeply shadowed by the

there will be no wrong done to the damsel. He will repair the

"Nay; nay; I will not have it so, Don Balthazar," was the
impetuous response o~ De Soto ;-" this is too much thy irrever-

when the young cavalier had left the presence, which he did with-
otit rendering necessary the commands of his superior, De Soto
resumed as follows:
"This passeth my lWpe! I had feared a struggle with the hot
passions of this youth~ Few men tole~'ate compulsion in aflivirs
of love; still fewer the necessity of an alliance with the tl~ing
they have dishonored. Strange that we should be so ~heedful of
a stain which is of our own making: but verily such is man's
nature. That Nuno d~ Tobar is so easy in this matter,-though
it likes me as repairing the shame of the Lady Leonora, and re.
living me of some of the trouble in my path,-yet somewhat
lessens him in my fav~r. He seemeth to me rather heedless on
the point of honor."
"Nay, your excellei~icy is now unreasonable," was the answer
of Don Balthazar; "~uno de Tobar is a philosopher somewhat
after my own fashion. He hath made no large calculation upon
the sex; therefore he shall not suffer greatly from experience
hereafter. Thou wilt ~Io well to suffer him to see noAiminution
of thy favor. Hast thou not declared him thy lieutenant-general?
Wilt thou revoke thy trust? If thou dost, the offence were more
grievous than the co~nmand which weds him to this damsel.
That were not so readily forgiven. Tr~ist me, he is one to
resent a wrong done t~ his ambition, where he might submit to
one inflicted on his he~rt."
"It may be so," was De Soto's answer to this suggestion,
- "yet I have resolved that he goes no longer as my lieutenant-
general. I think of this office for another. It shall certainly be
his no longer. He shall win his way to favor ere he gains it.
What thickest thou of Vasco Porcallo for this station ?"
"Does he join the Axpedition ?" inquired the c~ther.
"Will such an app~Antment fail to persuade him to the enter-
prise? Such is the bait which I have passed before his eyes."
"His treasures are ~n object, surely!"

"HAvE you sounded these' Portuguese brothers, as I coun.
yelled you'?" was the ~qu~yof De Soto.
The brow of Don Balthazar slightly darkened as he answered:
"It is not easy to sound them. They are suspicious and re-
sentful. The jealousies of our people have made them so; and
you have been able to offer them no position. I should have
preferred, were this possible, that one of them should have this
very office you propose to confer upon Vasco Porcallo."
"That is out of the question."
"I feel it; and yet, beyond the hope of profit, which is felt
by the commonest arquebusier in the army, what is the motive
for the enterprise on the part of these brothers'? They are both
young and noble-ambitious and full of valor. Their followers
are few, it~ is true, but they will make good fight; and really, the
abilities of the elder brother, Philip de Vasconselos, are proba-
bly of greater valub than those of any of your cavaliers. The
companion of De Va9a, he hath traversed all these wilds of Flori-
da, and probably knoweth all the secrets of which De Va~a made
such glorious boast and mystery Besides, he speaks and un-
derstands the language of the natives; an advantage of which it
is difficult to measure the importance. Of his valor and con-
duct we have sufficient testimony of our own eyes, even if the
evidence of other witnesses were wanting; De Va9a himself
spoke of him as one of the most prudent and valiant ok his
cavaliers."

manhood with the grace and loveliness of woman-counsel her-
self must willingly incline her ear. We were foes to wisdom /
did we refuse to hearken to the words of her best favorite."
The stately~compliment, so perfectly Spanish, was from the
lips of Don Balthazar, upon whom the lady smiled mos!~
sweetly, not wholly insensible, it would seem, to the honeyed
flattery.
"Now, verily," exclaimed De Soto, who beheld the expres-
sion in her face; "now, verily, hath this politician won thy
whole heart by the silliest speech. He is like the cunning knave
who possesseth counterfeit castellanoes, who, knowing their just
worthlessness, yet circulates them for the value which they de-
rive only from the ignorance of him who receives. He hath put
his copper trinket upon thee, and will look for the golden one in
return, even as we look to our Floridian savage fbr the precious
metals, in exchange for others, which are as dear to his eyes, as
despicable in ours. Is it not so,. my lady? And yet, if thou art
thus easily put upon, what shall be my security, leaving the
government of Cuba in thy hands?"
"Oh! fear nothing, my lord; I shall ere long become schooled
in all the subtleties of thy~'politicians, so that thy government
shall have fio wrong during thy absence. Be not deceived, my
good lord, in the supposed estimate which our sex makes of the
flatteries of thine. We receive the coin that thou offerest, not
because we overvalue it or esteem it very highly, but simply as
we know that it is quite too commonly the most precious which
ye have to offer. Were sincerity one of the virtues of the man,
we should perhaps never listen to his flatteries; but it were un-
reasonable to reject his false tokens, when we know that such
constitute his whole treasure; and we receive the tribute of his
lips only in the absence of all better securities lodged within his
heart. It is something of an acknowledgment, in behalf of our
authority, that he is solicitous to show the devotion which he
has not always the nobleness to feel."

his chamber of council without a summons, she was yet satisfied,
from past experience, that her presence in such a place was
never wholly unacceptable or unprofitable! When, therefore,
she declared her pleasure to remain, unless the topics under
discussion should prove ungracious in the hearing of her sex, the
ready answer of her husband entreated her to do so, whilst
assuring her against the exception which she expressed.
"Nay, Isabella," said he; "it particularly concerns thy sex,
that of which we are t~ speak, and much of what has been
spoken. Know then, in the first place, that thou art to prepare
thy lovely handmaid, the damsel Leonora, for her nuptials with
Nuno de Tobar."
"Thou hast then adjusted that matter '?" said the lady, with a
grave accent and demeanor.
"It is settled, and without anger or difficulty. It is for thee to
decide upon the hour of the bridal. Let it be soon, for we must
have dispatch, and advise with the damsel ere the day be sped.
But there is yet another matter connected with thy sex which
troubles me, and prevents my purpose. Their mischievous influ-
ence hath been at work upon my bravest cavaliers. Thou
knowest these two ~roung knights of Portugal. I need not tell
thee of their w~rth, their valor, and the great importance to the
expedition of the elder brother, Philip de Vasconselos, who hath
already sped over all the territory of the Floridian, and is fami-
liar with the heathen speech of its people. Now, it so happens
that these two young gallants grow indifferent to the enterprise.
They have held themselves somewhat aloof from me of late, and
words have been heard to fall from their lips, which declare their
doubts whether they will accompany the expedition, as was their
purpose when they joined our armament at Seville."
"And canst thou not guess the reason for this change of pur-
pose V' demanded the lady, with a smile.
"Ay, verily L Thy smile tells me that I am right in ascribing
their fickleness of purpose to the persuasions and artifices of thy
sex. Our grave Seiior, Don Balthazar de Alvaro, will have it
due only to the jealousies of our Spaniards, with whom these

"Deceive not thyself, Se~ior," said the Lady Isabella. "Men
are seldom the best. judges of such matters, especially where
they are grave senators and busy politicians. You have quite
too many concerns to demand your study-tOo many cares of
business and fortune to suffer you to give much heed to the ten~.
dency of a young and feminine heart. I claim to understand it
better, and I tell thee; Sefior, that if ever woman loved cavalier,
with all her soul, and with all her strength, then doth Olivia
de Alvaro love this elder knight of Portugal, whc~ni they call
Philip de Vasconselos."
"I believe it not! You are deceived, Lady Isabella. I am
sure that such is not the case. But if it were, I should be false to the
duties I have undertaken to suffer her indilnations to have sway
in this. This Philip de Vasconselos may have his virtues; yet
what is he but a b~garly adventurer, who has squandered his
birthright in wanderings where the better wisdom has always
succeeded in \acquirii~ig it ?"
"Not ah~ays, Se~ior, unless old proverbs fall us. The best
wisdom is but too commonly the last to secure* the smiles of For..
tune. Have not your poets made her feminine, and with twK
fold sarcasm made her caprices to resemble ours? Say th~y
not, that he is most apt to win her favor who less ~oes for, a~d
less deserves it; and shape they not their sarcasm~~in such wi~e
as to salve the hurts of self-esteem, by recognizing he propriety
of that favor which provides for him who would never be able,
of his own wits, to provide for himself?. You shall do no slander
to this knight of Portugal, Philip de Vasconselos, who, verily, is
a man of thought as well as of valor. I have enjoyed his wis-
dom with a rare delight, and if his valor keep any rate of pace
with his judgment, he should be a famous leader in ~uch adven-
ture as that on which. ye go. For the younger brother, ii can
scarcely. speak so favorably. He seemeth at once less wise and
more presuming. He speaks as one confident in himself; and I
should deem him quite as rash and ill..advised as, valiant ;-nay
more, he hath the manner of a man whom small griefs unreason-
ably inflame,-whO is irritable of mood, suspicious of those

cav~a1ier in all Spain upon whom to bestow er fortune."
"And will you that I should encourage a passion which will
tend to baffle thy own desires ?" demanded Don Balthazar.
"How so,.-What meanest thou ?" was the inquiry of De Soto,
who looked the alarm which he really felt.
"See'st thou not that the bridal of Philip de Vasconselos with
Olivia de Alvaro is conclusive against his progress with the expe-
dition'? With her estates in Cuba to occupy his thoughts,-with
her wealth in which to luxuriate,-wherefore should he incur the
peril of the Floridian enterprise ?"
"And wherefore should my lord himself incur such peril, Sefior
Balthazar ?" was the quick and ~energetic reply of the lady.
"Hath he not estates in Cuba, a government to demand his care,
and wealth enough with which to procure all the luxuries of the
island? Yet he will leave all these-he will leave me, but lately
his newly-wedded bride-and one, I trow, not wholly without hold
~upon his heart-and go forth upon adventures of incomparable
peril. But this 1~elongs to the passion of a knightly ambition-a
generous impatience of the dull paces of the common life ;-an
eager and noble appetite after conquest, and the glory which it
brings! Of this same temper, seems to me the ambition of this
knight of Portugal, who hath been regardless of wealth only as
he hath been heedful of honor,-and whose pride it is rather to
win a glorious name, than a golden habitation. Thou shalt not
disparage this quest, Seiior, since it is one which is ever precious
in the sight of :a generous knighthood."
"You speak it bravely, my lady; but shall not persuade me
that this knight of Portugal would wed my niece only to depart
from her. He shall need some time after the nuptials, ere his
ambition shall assert itself. His love of distinction will doubt-
less bring him after the adelantado-bilt with slow footsteps, and
when his lance shall be no longer needful to success."
"This is, indeed, a matter to be thought on, Don Balthazar,"
was the reply of De Soto, looking gravely, and evidently touched

"Now hath Dofia Isabella counselled truly, as hath ever been
her wont," said Don Balthazar, eagerly seizing upon a suggestion
which promised somewhat, however vaguely, to assist in extri-.
cating him from a difficulty which, it was evident to his superior,
was one of unusual annoyance.
"Both of these brothers," lie continued, "cherish an eager anx-

fered no sports of this character t~ escape them; and one which
shall make an event in Cuba long to be remembered with wonder
and delight, shall surely reawaken in their bosom all their most
earnest appetites for fame. Let them but draw the eyes of all
cavaliers upon themselves in this tourney, and they shall scarcely,
through very shame, be enabled to escape the necessity of joining
in the enterprise.
"It shall be done," said De Soto, with the air of a man sud-.
defily relieved from his -anxieties. "Thou hast counselled, my
lady, with as just a knowledge of our sex and its vanities, as of
thine own and its sympathies. And now for the plan f this

CHAPTER III.

The devil cannot juggle her from my custody:

.--SHRLEY.

THE day was consumed before Don Baltha4r de Alvaro was
released from his duties near the person of th~ adelantado. It
had been, with the former, a day of protracted~ toil, not without
certain accompanying tortures. The tortures,~ however, did not
exactly follow from the toil. On the contrary , he could have
pursued the former, not only without the slight st feelings of an-
noyance or inconvenience, but with an elastic ity and sense of~-
satisfaction, the natural consequence of his deep sympathy in the
objects of the expedition. His tortures belon ed entirely to a
subject, the annoyances of which, to him, were ot by any means
suspected by De Soto or his noble lady. Littl did they fancy
the deep and peculiar disquiet which Don Balth zar suffered from
any allusion to the probability of his niece's ma riage. Had the
lover been any other~ than the knight of Portu ak-had he been
the most unexceptionable parson in the world the case would
not have been altered. He would still have foun a stern hostility
in the uncle of the lady, for which no reasons o ordinary policy
could possibly account.
But Don Balthazar had the strength of will to conceal fronui
his superior, as from all others, the degree of ncern which he
felt in relation .to this subject. His experience and indurated
nature knew well how to clothe itself; exter ally, in the gar-
nients of a rugged indifference, or of a pulsele s apathy. But
he suffered not the less in secret; and, with the release from the
restraints of that companionship throughout th day, which had
fettered his secret feelings, th~y broke out in depression of cor-

he took his way, at the approach of evening, toward the hr
solitude of his own habitation.
Thi~s was situated in one of the loneliest, as well as the 1
est, of the suburbs of the infant city. The retreat was c
which love and ambition might equally delight to meditate
one on human sympathies, which are always sweetly asso
with the beauty and innocence of nature-the other upon I
hope and prospects in the future, which present posse
princely and beautiful, might naturally suggest to the fierc
and the grasping, eager temperament. The site of the habi
of Don l~althazar was happily found upon a gentle emi~
which afforded equal glimpses of the city and the sea. It~
zon was only circumscribed by its trees,-fruita~e and flp~
an excess of which the best taste, in a warm climate, woul
it difficult to complain. The air that breathed balm ever
its atmosphere-the breeze swelling at frequent periods fr
tributary seas-the chirp of innocent insects, and the sc
uncaged, but never wandering birds-were all suggestive
condition of the dolce far niente of the fatal tyranny of wh
sage and moralist dilate in warning exhortation ever,,
which they are always most ready to submit with pleas
to remember with regret and yearning. Fruits of every li
variety, flowers of the most golden and glorious hues ai
fumes, vines and leaves of all most grateful descriptions,]
nized with this happy empire, where the passions, whether
ing or triumphant, might here find themselves at home
shadiest palms, and other trees of equal verdure and fra~
compensatedd for the absence of grandeur and sublimity,
indeed, must have been inconsistent with the peculiar m
such an abode. The attractions of this sweet seclusion ~w
wholly confined to the gift~ and attributes of nature. Th4
of art had been made tAbutary, in high degree, to he~
wants. The sire of the Lady Olivia, who had left it for h~
in the keeping of his brother, had ~nade it after the fashion:

own nature, which was meek in its desires, and a worshipper of
the graceful, the peaceful and the beautiful. Th~ luxuries of such
an abode were doubly refined and spiritualizes to the soul of
taste, by the sweet repose, the delicious security which hung, as
with a veil, over the partial solitude. ~At a little distance lay the
white dwellings of the infant city, the voices of its daily toil and
struggle rising only as a faint and pleasant murmur, most like
the sweet chiding of distant billows ona rocky shore. The sea, at a
like distance, had also a pleasant music for the dwellers in this
forest home, Where, through long and complicated avenues of
greenest foliage, the fond and contemplative spirit might make its
way, with just enough of the consciousness of life for pleasure,
and not enough of its toils and apprehensions for anxiety or
care.
Here, then, with few attendants, and but one companion, the
subtle, the mercenary, and sleepless politician, Balthazar de Al-
varo, made his abode. Hither he took his way, with slower foot-
step than was his wont, after separating from the adelantado.
He had run a sort of gauntlet of inquiry, as he emerged from the
presence of De Soto, and made his way through the city, by
which his mood had undergone no peculiar sweetening. Rut it
was admirable to witness thQ strength of a much exercised and
well-trained will, in subduing the outbreaks of a temper which
had suffered a series of most painful provocations throughout the
day. He could smile graciously as he replied deferentially to his
equal; nor was he wanting in a certain kind of smile, when he
answered the inquiries of his inferior. The necessities and ob-
jects of De Soto required much exercise of the arts of concilia-
tion on the part of his associates; nor was Don Balthazar Want-
ing in that policy which teaches that none are too humble to be
incapable of harm in season-none too worthless for use in cer-
tain periods. He traversed the interval between the dwelling of
the adelantado and his own, vexed at every step in his progress,
yet without betraying his vexation to the most worthless
spectator.
It was only when he reached the secure shelter of hi~ Own

himself upon the earth, at the foot of a noble palm, whict
encircled by a dense thicket of tributary vines and shru~
yielded to speech a portion of the troubles which had we

me on the rack of fear. You put your foot upon one

thrust it back a moment after, drew his cap above his eyes, and
stretched himself along upon the sward, with his face downward.
Here he lay in complete silence, and scarcely stirring, the full
space Qf half an hour. Meanwhile, the day waned. The sun
- was at his setting, and the night birds began wheeling, with faint
shrieks, about the place whei'e he seemed to slumber. But
slumber was not upon his eyelids, or in his thoughts. It was not
his necessity just then. He rose, at length, with the deliberation -
of one who has recovered the fhll sway over all his moods, and,
adjusting his garments, prepared to move towards his dwelling,
which was still at some distance, and hidden 'wholly from his
eyes by the sinuosity of the avenues, and the denseness of the
thicket. But he paused more than once on his progress, and,
more than once, did words of brief soliloquy break from his*
lips.
"At least, I must soon know all. There must be an explana..
tion. I must fathom her secret. I must probe her heart to its
core. If that be safe-4f she be what she hath been sufficiently
trained to be-what such training indeed should have made her,~"
and a grim smile passed over his features as he spoke,-" then
this Philip d~ Vasconselos can do no hurt. Let him live. He
will scarcely linger here. But if there be sentiment in her
bosom, newly born and from his agency, such as I would have
trampled out, if need be, in blood and fire,-.----.a sentiment hostile
to my hold upon her-then must I strike,-.-.strike fatally,~and
crush the danger in its very bud. But, I must penetrate her
secret. She hath grown subtle of late,.-..-that is an evil sign.
It is enough that she katl&amp; a secret, and from me. That alone is
significant of danger! Doth her reserve signify distrust of
me? Ha! what else? Do her tears manifest a feeling for
another? Then is~it a proof that she holds me in hate and
loathing. I must search, fathom this mystery, and be as swift
and stern as I am vigilant !"
This speech was not spoken all at once, but in snatches, during
his walk, md each soliloquy compelling his momentary pause.

Ai~ length the cottage and its 'gay verandahs opened before Ii
and he paused as he caught a glimpse of his niece, where she
d~ami1y reclining, empowered in the grateful shades of the
tr~es by which the dwelling was surrounded.
Olivia de Alvaro, as we now behold~her, her form dispc
at ease, stretched on ample cushions, in the airy recesseS of
verandah, would seem, from the half-shut eye, and the am
motionless attitude in which she lay, to have been wrapt in
most grateful slumbers. She was evidently unconscious of
rays of the fast disappearing sunlight, which shot, faint and
k~nly, through the intervening foliage. She was a pale, p'
beauty, one whose high and aristocratic features seemed scar
consistent with that despondency of mood and dependency o
ture, which have been described as her present character~
]~Ler features were not regular, but there wa~ a strange ham
between them nevertheless; the lofty brow, corresponding
with the distinctly rounded chin,-the large and well-fm
nose, and that 'drooping darkness of the Moorish eye,' whic
we know,-though it may slumber long in cloud and shado

flash. We have already described her as very young-sca
more than seventeen ;-but this youthfulness was not marks~
the usual frankness-the uncircuni~pect and exuberant flo~
that period. Her countenance was marked by an earnest
an intensity of gaze-and expression, which denoted a mature,
thought and feeling quite beyond her years. It is surprisin~
rapidly one lives, who has learned to feel, and been made t
fer. Yet what had been the sources of suffering in her'?
beautiful, well-beloved, what were the cares of Olivia de A~
by which she had grown so singularly mature'? This we
ascertain in feature pages.. Enough, if now we continue tl~

~reyed the impression of a sense of awe, compelling her fears, and
depressing her elasticity. This expression, particularly at those
moments when she seemed to become forgetful of every other
presence, commended her to sympathy, rather than offended
pride. There could be no jealousy of her superiority, in the evi-
dent feeling of apprehension which she displayed. A vague
sense of danger seemed to accompany the consciousness of her
charms; and the effect was rather to humble and subdue all the
loftier indications that were yet inseparable from the graces
of her manner, and the conscious nobility of blood and beauty.
To these she was by no means insensible. Her carriage was
such as shoWed an habitual appreciation of all her possessions;
yet so modifi d as to make nature more conspicuous than habit
in her demean r. The heart of a young damsel naturally, and
very soon, be omes sensible of the beauties of her person. Her
mirror, and t e common language of society,. read equally in
speech and m nner, soon teach her all the value of her charms.
But a refined aste renders it impossible, if she really should be
attractive, that she should escape this conviction. It is her merit
when she does not presume upon her possessions, and is modestly
content in th&amp; enjoyment. It is in due degree with the devel-
opment of her intellect, and the experience of afflictions, that she
schools her var4ty. That Olivia del Aivaro had, in large measure,
learned to tuto~' hers, might be ga1~hered from many indications.
That she was ~ot insensible to her own charms, was equally evi-
dent from the 4xercises in which she employed them. Few dam-
sels knew so w~11 how to train the glance, to give variety and
play to the expressive muscles, and the pleasing, persuasive
action; to sub 4 ue to sweetness, and the most touching tender-
ness of tone, th~ murmurs of the obedient voice; to mak the
fingers speak, a~ with an endowment of their own, and to inform,
with a nameless, but most winning flexibility, every move~nent
of the well-regi4lated and exquisitely symmetrical figure. ~[Jalf

the slightly waving leaves of the ana~na and the orange, she~
appeared wholly regardless of the timid brightness that sprinkle~
as with fairy eyes, the apartment all about her feet. She seen~
to muse m far delicious fancies, that made her wholly unc~
scious of the actual world in which she lived. Her person, uii
strained by any human presence, had naturally subsided into
attitude equally graceful and voluptuous; and this was altogeI~
the unstudied action of a grace, which, natural always, had~
always recognized in art only the appointed assistant, the ti~
woman and handmaid, of the imperial nature. Her dark, gld
hair, hung.upon her shoulders, from which jt descended in wa
but massive tresses. The art which had, withoutt an effort,
posed their flowing and magnificent folds, ~ad never been
successful in removing all proof of its own adorning fin
Slightly stirred by the fitful zephyrs of an afternoon in May,
season which, in Cuba, recognizes the perfect presence of the
hosomed summer, her ringlets played' upon her neck like y
birds, for the first time conscious of their wings, yet still flul
ing, timidly and fondly, about the parent nest. And thus
reclined, clad in robes of '~#hite, slightly trimmed with blue'
orange, seemingly unconscious of all things but those which -~
deeply hidden in her thoughts, at the moment when Don Balth
drew nigh to the dwelling.
The shrubbery had enabled him to approach unseen,
within a few steps of the verandah. He could detect the fain
~ outline of her person through the leaves of a gorgeous or~
beneath which he stood silently beholding her. She dreamed
f his presence. His footstep had been carefully set down,
riot to disturb her; and thus unsuspected, he stood, for a fe~
ments, watching her with a singular and intense interest. J

paternal affection. And yet there was a something bitter in the
smile which o~casionally played upon his lips; and the slight
frown which d~Lrkened in his glance was significant of a disquiet
or disappointment, the sources of which we may not yet compre..
hend. Suspicion, too, might be seen to lurk ~even beneath the
smile of the observer, and his secret watch might have been dic-
tated by a policy which was not above the indulgence of a
baseness.
And yet his purpose did not seem to be espionage. A sudden
and troublesome thought-perhaps a suddenly suggested curios-
ity-appeared to arrest his footsteps on his approach. Her ap-
pearance, hera attitude, seemed to invite his study. It was to
muse, to meditate, or, perhaps, to' prepare his mind for some
exigent duty that he paused, without seeking to disturb the dam-
sel in her vacant mood. She, too, had her causes for meditation;
though one might readily ascribe the dreamy languor of her atti-
tude to the bla~id and seductive influences of the climate. To the
voluptuous idh~r, already familiar with that luxury of situation
which ~uspend~ the thought, and strips, the fancy of everything
but wings, her appearance would seem natural enough, and her~
conjectured reveries would only be the most grateful, yet unim-
pressive in the world. It would be only to liken her bower to
the wizard do~am of that archimage who wove his perpetual
snares in the C4stle of Indolence, making all things dreamy and
delusive in the half-shut eye. But the meditations of Olivia de
Alvaro were of~ a sort, perhaps, even more deeply troublesome
than those of her uncle. Big tears might be seen to gather in
her eye-slowly, it is true, .and few,-but they were such as we
seldom look to see in the eyes of young and innocent loveliness.
The great dro s silently oozing from beneath their dark and
drooping fringe ,like some gradual stream gliding silently forth
from the overhanging alders, were not unseen by her
uncle. His features became graver as he beheld them, and he
looked aside-he looked down-as if anxious to shut them from
his sight. He turned away hastily a moment after, and, with
careful footstep, retreated silently from his place of watch. Tak~

b~ supposed to arise frona motives of most singular selfisimess
or baseness. But Olivia herself; aware of his aversion to her
marriage, has really no notion that avarice is the infirmity of her
uncle. She knows but'little of his individual resources, but much
of himself. She has seen nothing in hi~ expenditure, ort conduct,
which would m~ake him appear in her eyes to be a mercenary.

ance of De ~oto and his lady, when it was impossible to with-
hold her from the court; her own wealth, her father's name, and
the position of her uncle, equally requiring it. Up to this period
she little dreamed of the treasures which the world had in
its keeping. She little knew the value of her own. But in the

ble strength of endurance to withstand. She had heard of their
betrothal, arid of the forgiveness which De Soto had extended to
the erring gallant. Society at that day in Cuba was not par-~
ticularly jealous of propriety. That Leonora I3ovadilla had
sinned, found its sufficient excuse with knight and lady, in the
simple fact that she loved; and it was only with that class of
ancients, of her own sex, who had survived even the hope of a
change from single to dependent blessedness.-a number singu-
larly few in every community-that censure claimed the privi-
lege still to wag a slanderous tongue under the guise of a jealous
virtue. Olivia de Alvaro had never been of the number to
reproach the poor Leonora for her lapse, even when it was
doubtful whether the sense of virtue, the sentiment of honor,
or the feeling of love, in Nuno de Tohar, would prompt him
to repair his wrong according to the worldly usage, by
making her his wife. Having known her as a thoughtless child,
without guile as without experience, a creature of extreme levi-
ty, but without any impulses to evil more than seemed naturally
to belong to the mercurial temper, Olivia was not prepared to re-
gard her as guilty, because she had been weak. She was
indulgent in proportion as the world showed itself severe. She
knew~ according to a common history, that,
"Every woe a tear may claim,
Except an erring sister's shame,"
and rising above the prejudices of the world, as much through
sympathy as generous ty, she suffered her manner towards the
frail offender to show none of those harsher aspects which for-
ever insist upon its faults~ On the contrary, a tender solicitude
seemed desirous to soothe the humiliations of the suffi~rer, and
make her forgetful of those public disgraces which she could not
always hope to escape. Leonora felt all this, and repaid the
kindness of Olivia by as much devotion as could distinguish a
nature so thoughtless. The first visit which she made, after the
reconciliation of her guardian with her lover, was that which we
now witness. Of course, the peculiar case of the visitors was not

one to be spoken of openly. The silent pressure of Leoi
hand by Olivia, the tender kiss which she impressed upc
cheeks, and the single ~tear which gathered in her eye, ~
whispered a hurried word of congratulation, sufficiently a~
the former of the continuance of that sympathy ~hich h
ready afforded her so much solace. But she erre~l, perh~
ascribing the tear to the sympathies of friendship. Had si
beheld the big drops that fell from the same fruitiful foui
but a little while before, she might have suspected oth
more selfish sources of sorrow in her friend.
Seated in the cool shadows of the verandah, th~ gay L4
soon opened her stores of prattle. She had ga1~hered
rumors of the day,. alkd ~he was impatient to unfol~1 them.
"And 0! dearest livia, have you heard of th9 tourna
The town is full of it. It is to be the greatest 4nd the

The other shook her head very mournflilly.

"Me proud, Leonora !" reproachfully.

The hand of Olivia was passed with a close pressure over her
brows. Little did the thoughtless Leonora dream that the action
was occasioned by a feeling of pain. She continued:
"But of the homage of the knights of Portugal, nobody has a
question. It is in every one's ~mouth; everybody~ sees that both
the brothers love you to distraction. The question with them all
is, which of them you favor. Now, I am for Don Andres, the
younger; but Nuno-"
Here she was interrupted by a loik from her Ietrothed, for
which Olivia was properly grateflil. The subject seemed to an-
noy her.
"Hush, hush, dear Leonora !-.Tell us of the tournament rather.
This is not the season to talk of love, but of war. See how the
adelantado treats the affections, when they come in conflict with
his ambition. Who so lovely, so stately, so noble, so like a
Queen, as the Lady Isabella ?-yet will he leave her, a newly-
wedded wife, to go on wild adventures against the Floridians.
Fie upon such chivalry, such devotion, such love! What need
bath he of further wars ?-hath he not wealth enough from Peru?
..-hath he not grandeur enough as Governor of this goodly island,
and reputed one of the noblest cavaliers of Spain? Methinks
he wantonly ffings from him a living and a glorious treasure, for
a dream-for a shadow which will mock his hope, and defraud
him of all his happiness."
Olivia had spoken rapidly, in order, possibly, to divert the in-
terest of her companions to other subjects. In speaking, how-
ever, of the projected conquest of Florida, she yet trenched upon
the province of Nuno de Tobar, and indirectly assailed his conduct
also. He, too, like De Soto, had, acquired the love of a young and
beautiful woman; he had formed ties equaUy precious, which he
wa~ about to abandon at the calls of ambition; and though his
state was neither secure, nor his possessions great like those of the
latter, yet the imputation, in some degree, lay against him, of a
like disregard to the claims of duty and domestic life. He an-
swered Olivia after the usual manner of knight-errants.
"And how else, dear lady, can chivalry display itself; unless

by deeds of arms and conquest ~ It is by these deeds &amp;~
conquest, that it brings home tribute to Beauty, and crow
with its proper jewels. It is to make love secure in st
home, and refresh its bowers with lasting delight, that it (
ters peril for a season, the laurels and rewards of which si
dure through future years. Love is not abandoned when t
shipper carries ever ~ith him in his heart a passionate d~
which makes him cry upon the beloved one's name in the st
* battle, and pray for her prayers in the tempests of the deei
* prompts him to build for her a temple in waste places, an
wreath chaplets of her favorite flowers in forests which s~
never see. His devotion even warms with distance, and
members her beauties and her virtues the better when
longer may enjoy them. If he goes forth, it is with the
that he may return full-handed with spoils, that he mazy
her feet in guerdon og his faith and homage."
"Ah! Sei'ior, you phrase it well, and it is such fine elc
that.for a season reconciles the: poor heart of woman to to(
of the errantries of chivalry. For me, I confess, wouldd
please me should my knight leave to others the storm o
and the, peril of the seas. Let me have the devotions
heart at the altars of home, rather than in the forests
Floridian. Let me have the idol of my eyes always prc
my sight.. I should not need that he should wander awa
my eyes to be~ able to recall his virtues and grow fonc
devotion."
"Oh! Fie, Olivia, dear,---you have no sort idea
belongs to true chivalry. Why, true chivalry lives on:
and conquest, on long wanderings over sea and land, intc
that were never heard of before, seeking all sorts of ene~
overthrow, and coming home with treasures of gold, gi~
heralds, such as they gather iii Peru, 'pearls,-pearl~
bushel. They gather them, Nuno tells me, by the
among the Floridians. Nay,., you smile,---but the story
from your knights of Portugal.-Philip, the elder, h~
among the savages in that country."

"I have no knights, Leonora, and this reminds me that I have
really no interest in this game of war that is called chivalry.
Let those like it who may. Its splendid shops do not beguile
or satisfy my imagination."
"Ah! but they will in the tournament, which ~aL1~and.
Don't tell me that you hav&amp; no knight. I promi e you, dear
Olivia, that you will have knights enough to. do battle for your
smiles, and to wear your favors. These knights of Portugal
will not be the only ones to break lances in your honor. But lets
them beware how they cross with my Nuno. If he does not
unhorse every opponent, I ~will never, never,~never love him any
more. And that's a vow to the Blessed
"Don't be rash, Leonora," interrupted Nuno, with a smile.
"You may punish yourself by such a vow, much more than you
could ever punish me!"
"Ha! Howl"
He evaded the query, and went on.
"As for overthrowing these knights of Portugal, it is no easy
in~tter. I should rather cross lances with any other foes! Philip
de Vasconselos .-'~
"How! Are you recreant? Will you allow these Portuguese
to pluck the honors from Castile'?"
"Nay, ~y! not if I can help it. flut I should prefer other
hands than mine to make the attempt. The world has few
lances which can safely cross that of Philip de Vasconselos, and
mine, I fear, is not one of them; and I so love the man that I
should find no satisfaction in depriving him of* a single glory
that he desires. But something, as you say, is due to the honor
of Castle, and if Philip overthrows all other combatants, he
must have a chance of including me among his captives."
The eyes of ~Olivia were cast upon the ground. But her ears
drank in eagerly every syllable which had fallen from the gen-
erous lips of Nuno de Tobar. She did not speak when he had*
closed, nor for some time after, but remained apparently a silent
listener to the gay and desultory prattle of Leonora, who, in t~e
fulness of her heart, assured of her own happiness, and relieved

of all doubts of the future, had given herself up to that
and roving method which but too commonly distinguish

in season to prevent her speech.

tinctions in the army, and as their military passion became cooled,
that of love made its appearance to assist in usurping the place of
the former in their bosoms. Unhappily, their affections were
fixed upon the same lady. The devotion of Andres de Vascon-
selos led him almost nightly to her dwelling. Philip was a fre-
quent visitor; but he so chose his periods as seldom to cross his
brother's progress. Andres little knew how friuch he owed to
this forbearance. He was slow to perceive, what was seen by all
the island, that, if the heart of Olivia de Alvaro inclined to either,
he certainly was not the suitor whom she most preferred. His
self-esteem was not willing to accept any such humiliating sug
gestion.
Olivia naturally received him with respect and kindness. She
felt uneasy at his attefitions, but she respected him because of her
attachment to his brother. It was easSr, with his temper, to mis-
take the sources of this kindness. But he was not suffered to
presume upon it. A certain dignified but mild reserve, in the
manni~rs of the lady, served to check every feeling of overweening
confidence, and to satisfy the bold gallant that the fortress must
undergo a regular leaguer before the garrison would be persuaded
to surrender. He endeavored accordingly to school his eager de-
sires, with as much patience as he could command; and to lessen
the duration of the siege, his attacks were rendered more anl
more frequent. It was seldom that a night was suffered to pass
without finding him in her presence; and the gentleness of her re-
ception, and the sweetness of her manners, seldom suffered him
to h~ave her without giving his eager vanity sufficient assurance
of favorable progress. She beheld this confidence with pain, and
her reserves were increased accordingly ;-but as these never put
on harsh aspects, nothing ~was done to arrest the self-delusion of
the lover.
A little awkwardness succeeded his first appearance within the
~t4rcle. Nuno de Tobar was the friend of Philip de Vasconselos
rather than his brother. He had never been altogether satisfied
with the latter. He was aware of the attachment of both for
his fair hostess.......perhaps suspected the nature of her feelings for

But the confidence of Andres de Vasconselos was of a s

subjects which was started. This was the affairs of the

As, thou

wilt be among the first to hear and answer. But, of' a surety,
thou wilt not be wanting to the tournament."
"AAd yet," answered the knight of Portugal, with a smile
that might have been mistaken for a sneer, "were it not as great
a rashness if I should venture in a passage at arms with sih for~
tunate gallants as Don Nuno de Tobar, who wears the favors of
one of' the loveliest damsels of Cuba'? It will need something
more than skill and valor to render a poor knight of Portugal
successful against the cavaliers of Castile, when they couch spear
under the smiles of the most invincible beauty."
There was something equivocal in this remark that made Nuno
de Tobar wince, but his betrothed did not perceive it. She went
on, slily glancing, as she spoke, at the pale face of Olivia, which
put on an increasing gravity as she listened.
"Yet seems it to me, SefYor, that thou wilt scarcely lack in the
auspices which befriend thy opponent. I doubt not but the
smiles of Beauty will give thee sufficient encouragement. At
least, it is scarcely fitting that a true knight should suffer from
such want."
The eyes of Andres de Vasconselos followed those of Leonora,
as she looked mischievously in the direction of her friend. The
reference was quite unfortunate. There wa~ no mistaking the
resolute gravity which absolutely groomed the features of Oli-
via. But her face was no longer pale. A warm flush rose
upon her cheeks at the same moment, of the soi~rce of which
Don Andres readily deceived himself. His vain arA eager fancy
easily construed this flush~ into a confession of weakness,-and a
proud exulting glance, which he did not seek to restrain, betrayed
toOlivia the delightful conviction which he felt. But her eyes
made no answer to his own, and the flush passing immediately
from her' cheeks, was succeeded by an almost mortal paleness,
which was by no means diminished while Andres continued to
speak in answer to the grateful suggestions of Leonora. He had
his reply, full of empressement, to the pleasing insinuation which
she had conveyed, quite as much, perhaps, by the direction of her
glance, as by the language which she had uttered. His reply~

though the mere words might disclaim his sense of trim
yet distinguished by a manner which betrayed the most
assurance.
"Alas! Lady Leonora, thou wouldst betray "me to z

"Ah 1', was his reply. "But 'he who hath set his affections
upon the bird of paradise, can giv&amp; but little heed to the plum-
age or the strains of inferior songsters."'
His eyes again sought the pale countenance 6f the maiden
whom.he worshipped. Her glance was equally wandering and
sad. Nuno de Tobar saw that she was troubled. He himself
was dissatisfied with the thoughtless play of his betrothed. He
felt its mischievous tendency, and his friendship for Philip de
Vasconselos made him unwilling to behold a progress on the
part of his brother which was adverse to his own. He inter-
fered t~ effect a diversion of the topic, which the fanciful allusion
of Don Andres now enabled him to do without an effort.
"Talking of birds and singing, dear Lady Olivia, reminds me
that in the cares of the camp, and in my long term of disfavor,
I have not enjoyed thy music for a weary seasoi~. I pray thee,
favor us with some one of those many ditties which never come
with due effect save from those who feel them. I would I could
persuade thee to one of those antique ballads of El Cid; but I
will not ask thee, remembering the flat denial which thou gayest,
in my presence, to that fine courtier, De Sinolar, when he craved
the ballad of Urraca, and the Moor who lost Vale~cia. Nath-
less, some other strain, I pray thee, if it be only to persuade
Dofia Leonora that Nuno de Tobar is not so entirely her slave
that he dare not seek a favor at the hands of anothe~beauty. I
trust, Selior Alidres, that thy ear, like mine, is accessible to all
the charms of music."
"Verily, Sefior," was the reply, "that depends entirely on the
bird that sings. There are some whose plumage makes marvel-
ously against their strains. That thou hast had the wit to entreat
from the Lady Olivia that bounty which it has heen my first
thought to solicit, is a great vexation. But I must content my~
self now ~ith repeating thy entreaty."
The cavaliers both looked pleadingly to Olivia as they spoke.
But she needed no second soliciting. She was not one of those

upon as affording relief to troubled feelings. She had

"But not of the infidel?" replied the other with a sort of ~1oly
horror, crossing herself devoutly as she spoke.
~, rely, but of a family that haply beheld the blessed
ight of the Christian Church, and of~thoir own free will sought
baptism. But the ballad I have sung comes not from the Njoor.
~: It is pure Castilian. The damsel Amina was of the true faith."
"Ay, lady, but she sang not wisely, knowing the wants of our
sex, and the better virtue in her own. Her ballad is in the per-
verse spirit of the Moor, who, with the true heaven in his eye, yet
wilfully turned away his sight. In heart ~he was but a pagan.
It suits the creed of one who found inns slave ~t1~e thing of his
affections. ,Of such only is it permitted to hink ill of knighthood,
and to stifle all the free faith in the heart of woman. It suit~ for
reproach to a race of misbelievers, who, though they bore them-
selves manfully enough in battle, were yet little familiar with the
laws of Christian chivalry. The true knight loves not less the
treasure because it hath been won. If he keeps it no longer, in
his eye, it is because he hath conveyed it to his heart. I~ he
boasts no longer of its beauty, it is because he fears to tempt the
avarice of others to seek his treasure. If he sings n&amp; longer in
her praise, it is because, when he hath wholly given himself up to
her charms, as he doth by marriage, he hath said the most in her
honor that could be spoken. Verily, I repeat, your Amina ~va~
but a wretched heathen in heart, cold and selfish, a her doctrine
is only true of a people who believe with the iiifidel."
Such was the eloquent commentary of Don Andres, conveyed
In a manner at once spirited and graceful.
"Thou ha~t made a right good and proper defence of thy sex
aild mine, Don Andres," exclaimed Leonora, "and I trow thou
wilt never lack lady's favor to grace thy helmet in the 1ie1ct~ of
~ tourney. Thou wilt take thy part, I trust, in the tournament
which the adelantado has appointed; thou and thy valiant brother,
even if ye go not on the enterprise against the~ Floridian."
With the mention of his brother, the eyes of Don Andres were
seen suddenly to sparkle with a keen and fiery expression. Nuno
de Tobar, knowing the conscious rivalry that existed between~ the

With these words he passed quickly from the subject. KEhe
eve~ilii~ was not much longer protracted, and soon IDe Tobai' and
his betrothed took their departure, leaving the knight of Poi1tugal
behind them. They ~were not conscious, as they d~scende~1 the
verandah into the groves leading from the dwelling, of the r~ove-
ments of another~who led the way through the shady thi~l~ets.
This was no other than Philip de Yasconselos himself. us
not ix~iagine that he had been a li~t~ne~. He had been m~iiing
his way to the abode of Olivia, when arrested, almost o~ the
threshold, by the voice of his brother. He was about to ijetire,
as he had usually done uifder the same ~circumstances.
"Let him have all the chances," he murmured to hims~W, as
he turned away. "He was the youngest born of our ~
and had her fondest blessing. IV wer~ a grievous sorrow ig  e
had not mine."
Just then the voice of Olivia in song, detained his departing
footsteps. He leaned sadly against a tree while he listene~I to
the satirical ballad with which the damsel had answered th~ so
limitations of his brother. The sentiment of the ballad was no
less ungracious in his ears than in those of Andres; an~ yet
there was a secret feeling of satisfaction in the heart of P~flip,
that the ditty had been chosen in response to the prayer of a
I.
rival. He retired, with mingled feelings, from his place of~atch,
as the song ended, and strolled slowly through the alleys. In a
little while he heard the footsteps and the voices of IDe TobaF and
his companion, behind him, and perceived, with a pang, th~t his
brother did not accompany them. His pace was hurriedly in-
creased. He ~elt all the delicious opportunity which Afidres
enjoyed, and readily conjectured that it was with a special purpose
that the latter rein~ained after the departure of her other gue~ts.
"Well!" he murmured to himself sadly, "be it so! If he

hath the word with which to win her,~she is his! I will not nvy
my brotiier. I would I had the strength to pray that he might
be successful. He hath wronged me-he will still wrong me-.
and I will submit. He shall find in me no~illing rival, whether
in love or war. Our mother gave him to my care. I will 1~hink
of her love, though he may never do justice to mine."
The field was clear before Andres de Vasconselos. He was
alone with the woman whom he loved. He was not~ the
man to lose time, or daily long in a fruitless attendance a~ the
shrine of his devotions without making his petition heard. He
was ~one of those impetuous spirits whose fierceand eager willinthe
assertion of its desires, is apt to blind to the prospect of defe~t-
to all prospect save that which is beheld through the medium
of a passionate and almost frenzied hope. Scarcely had Nuno de
Tobar and his betrothed disappeared, before he was at. the feet
of Olivia. But not for us to watch the progress of the brief but
exciting scene which followed. Let it suffice that ere many
minutes had elapsed, Andres de Vasconselos was also spee~1ing.
away from the abode, darting headlong through the perfumed
alleys which surrounded it, and hurrying almost madly in the
direction of the neighboring hills.
With his disappearance,. Don Baithazar de Alvaro~ once n~ore
emerged from the cover of the neighboring thicket. His espio-
nage over his niece and her visitors seems to have been continued
throughout the evening. He had been sufficiently near, in his
place of concealment, to behold all that had taken place, and to
hear every syllable that was spoken. An exulting expression
was kindled in his face, and his satisfaction at the result was audi-
bly expressed.
"So far it is well! He hath his quietus. I had expected this;
but it is something to be sure. That danger is passed. There is
yet another, and a greater! Were I as confident of the answer she
would make to the prayer of Philip as of Andres-nay, were I
not so confident.J should feel at rest. This accursed anxiety!
It leaves me almost a coward. But I must arm myself for the
worst, and against the final struggle. It will come, and I m~ist be

prepared. Olivia de Alvaro must wed with neither of these
knights of Portugal. Shemust wed withuone. The hour that fi~ids
her9a bride, finds me . But it shall never come to this;
we must baffle him, or he must perish. Both shall perish ~re
she wed this man !"
Did Olivia dream of the near neighborhood of her uncle all this
while! Could she fancy what were his resolves and reflections, in
respect to her future fate and fortune~! It might almost ~em
that she did from the pallid features~ of her face, the big tears
swelling in her eyes, the drooping self-abandonment with which,
as soon as Andres de Yasc6nselos had disappeared, she suffered
herself t&amp; fall back upon the couch, her hands covering her face,
and, as it were, seeking to stifle the deep moan of agony which
perforce escaped from her lips. The sound reached 1~on Bal-
thazar in his place of concealment. Slowly he receded from the
spot and disappeared in the more distant shrubbery. He ~iad
not the heart to meet her at that moment.

CHAPTER~ V.
"Uso a vedirrni
Tremar tu sei ~ ma, pin non tremo."-ALnzrRr.
IT was past midnight when Andres de Vasconselos returned to
the bohio or cottage, which was occupied by his brother and him-
self His agitation was measurably subsided,~but not his pas-
~ions. The quiet was only upon th~ surface. A violent storm
w~is still busy, raging in the depths of his spirit. Hi~ features
were rigidly composed, but stern almost to ferocity, and his
emotion was perhaps only concealed by the resolute comp~es-
sion of his lips. It seemed as if he did not dare to trust to t~iem
in speech. Though late, his brother had not yet retired for the
night. Philip de Vasconselos was busily engaged wi4tin~g at the
tableihe only one which the apartment contained. The tight
by which he wrote was peculiar enough, however common to the
island. It consisted of a cluster of twelve or fifteen cocuyos,.-
that larger sort of phosphorescent insect. These were enclosed in
a little wicker-work, or cage, made of the most delicate threads
of gold-wire. They emitted a light, of a color brilliantly green,
ample enough for all the purposes of the student. Philip looked
up, at the entrance .of his brother, and discovered, at a glance,
that his emotions had been violently aroused and agitated. He
welcomed him, however, with a gentle~ord and smile, the an-
swer to which was at once brief and ungracious.
"Are you unwell, Andres'?" was the inquiry, affectionately
made; for the elder brother was touched, rather than vexed, by
the repulsive accents of the other.
"And if I were, Philip de Vasconselos '?" sternly and un~atis.
factorily replied the younger.
"And if thou wert, Andres! This t~o me, thy brother ?"

"Why not? Why should grief or suffering of mine concern
thee '~ It is enough that thou hast neither."
"Nay, Andres, that I myself am free from cares and sorrows
would be good reason only why I. should seek to bring some
remedy to thine. But there is yet another cause for my anxiety.
The epistle, my brother, which is now growing beneath
hands especially reminds me of my duty to succor and to corn-.
t thee. It is a ktter to our mother, Andres; and I am even
now about to speak of thy health and happiness."
"What warrant hast thou for assuming either? What know-.
est thou of my happiness or health ?"
"Nay, Andrea, that thou h~t vigorous and youthful health,
may not be denied. All who behc4d thee, speak loudly of thy
full cheek, thy elastic form, and the brightness of thine eye; and
these things speak for thy happiness als% It is vain to declare
the presence of a grief which leaves the beauty and vigor of the
form unwanted and untouched. Surely, my brother, thou art
imot unhappy?"
"Why troubles thou me with such questions, Philip? Write
to. our mother whatever it pleaseth thee to write. Soy what thou
wilt. It matters but little to me what thou sayest 1"
"Bi~t it matters much to her, Andres," replied ti2e other,
somewhat reproachfully. "Besides, I dare not speak to our
mother indifferently of him, her favorite son, whom she so corn..
mended especially to my affection as a~ younger brother."
"Philip de Yasconsel~s, both thou a~d our mother have~ei'red
greatly when ye claim to believe that I need guardianship. I
tell thee, Sefior, I am, like thyself; a man,-and fully capable of
taking care of my own health and fortunes."
The reply to this rude speech was full of a sad solemnity.
"Something hath vexed thee, Andres, making the4 unjust to
thy brother and ungrateful to the tender fondness of thy mother
for thy youth. Thou wi~t find it less easy, when thou recoveries
thy calm of temper, to forgive thyself than to procure her for-
giveness or mine. I will finish my letter, making my own
report of thy condition, which, until this hour, Andres, hath

seemed to all the island, as to myself; such as it would be most
grateful to any mother to beh6ld or know."
"As thou wilt; and yet !-Look at me, Philip de Vasconselos!
-look at me, ere thou writes down any delusive falsehood f~or
my mother's eyes! Look I like one whom th~ Gods have
marked for happiness ?"
He approacfled the table as he spoke, and grasped, with some
violence, the hand that held the pen. The eyes of the brothers
encountered. Those of Andres were blood-shot, full of rage,
and expressive of a fury that seemed about to break through 91
restraint. Philip rose, as he caught the fearful expression in the
other's face. His o'~n features were calm and firm, but filled
with a tender concern and. sympathy, such as spoke for the gen-
tle and nobl attachment with which the elder brother regarded
the younger, and the favorite of their mother.
"Andres," he said, "I know not that I an~wisej-or like to be
successful in sking thy confidence. Of late thou hast seemed to
regard me r ther as an enemy than a brother -"
"Thou art! Thou art !" was the wild and reckless answer.
"Nay, I c nnot answer thee, Andres, by any assurance in
words. It l~ecomes not me patiently to strive to disprove thy
injustice. I ~ook upon such speech as a sort of madness, on thy
part, rather than a wrong done to met Enough, that I tell thee

"I ask not thy help in battle, Philip de Vasconselos. I am
equal to my own danger. But thou art willing to help my pry-

"Yea! with all my strength, and all my heart I" was the eager
reply.
" Hearken! wilt thou deign then to seek on my behalf; and to
solicit from Don Balthazar de Alvaro, the hand of his niece in
marriage? Wilt thou do this, Philip de Vasconselos ?"
"Verily, o~' a truth will I do this, if the lady hath authorized

thee so to solicit ;" was the answer, in somewhat ~xbdued ac-
cents.
"If the lady hath authorized the&amp;to solicit !" was the mocking
repetition of the infuriate young man: "Go to, Philip de Vas-
conselos, I well kndw that thou wouldst not, ay, thou couldst
not, serve me in this. Would I need to solicit the favor of the
uncle, were I sure of the favor of his niece ?"
"Thou wouldst surely not seek the one, were the other denied
thee'?"
"Not through thy eloquence, surely, Senor Don Philip, lest
thou shouldst haply forget thy client's claims in the prosecution
of thy own."
"Andres, my brother," said the other calmly, but with a stern-
er show of expression than had before been apparent in his coun-
tenance,-" it~ will not be easy to make me angry with thee. It
is in thy madness that thou dost me this, gross injustice,-and I
forgive it. But let us speak no m~ in regard to this matter.
It needs not that I should tell thea what thou seemest already to
understand, that my affections have been placed, as well as thine,
upon the same lovely lady. I deny not this, though I have deem-
e~i it only proper that I should be silent on the subject, seeing thy
secret in the same moment with mine own. It is surely our mis~
fortune that we have so loved. But I resolved, from the moment
when I discovered of hy affections, that the field should
be ope~i to thee from any o struction of mine. I stood not in
thy way. I offered no rivalship to thee,-and, while thou hast
nightly sought the dwelling of the Lady Olivia, it was enough for
me to know that such was the 'course of thy footsteps, to turn
mine in the opposite direction. This very night, when I learned
that thou wast her guest, I left the garden of the lady-"
"Ha! thou wast there,-and thou hast heard'?" was the inter-
ruption.
"I have heard nothing! When I found the verandah occupied

"I know not that !-How should I love thee, when thou hast

(my affections have bee~ set!"
"But I know not this, Andres; I have never spoken word of
love or tenderness to the Lady Olivia."
"But thou wilt speak both; and she  hear thee, and respond
to thee in accents like thine own. No  re of this, lest I grow
wild and foolish, and curse thee, Phihi or thy better fortune."
"Nay, thoi~ shalt not, brother" and he threw his arms tenderly
about the unreasonable youth, who submitted but only for a mo-
ment to~the embrace; he shook himself free from it in the next
Instant. Philip's eyes followed him with a deep and melancholy
Interest, full of sorrow and affection, as he saw him preparing
once more to leave tl~e cabin.
"Whither go you, my-brother, at this late hour ?"
"Forth! Forth o cc more into the night !"
"Nay, Andres; ere it not better thou shouldst seek for
sleep ?"

"I cann t sleep! Thou knowest not what a stifling fullness
harbors he e-and here !" was the reply of Andres, smitinglais
head and osom as he spoke. "I must hurry forth! I must,
have air a d solitude !"
With t ese words he disappeared from the cabin. Philip de
Va conselos followed him to the door, and his~ eye~ anxiously
pur ued t e retreating form by the imperfect starlight, until it
had wholly gone from sight. The elder brother then returned~to
the table, here, seating himself, he rested his cheek upon his
pal , and sunk into a fit of melancholy, which was of mixed
cha acter, t once pleasing and painful. The perverse and will-
ful ride o his brother, his suspicious and jealous temper, must
nec ssarily have been productive of great grief to one by whom
he as ear estly beloved; but it was in~ vain that Philip. de Yas-
con elos tr ed to stifle the feeling of satisfaction which enlivened
and please tly ag4ated his bosom, as he thought of the rejec-
tion by Oh ia do Alvaro of his brother's suit. Love is certainly
one of the ost selfish and exacting of all the passions in the heart
of youth; perhaps because it is the passion which most corn.
pletely abs rbs and swallows i~p the rest. Philip was really
fond of A dres; fond of him by reason of natural sympathies,
as a broth r; fond of .him by habit and as.sociation-.-fond of
all thatwas manly in his character-.-proud~ of his spirit and youth-
ful beauty fond of him, 6n account of their mother, and partic-
ularly so, , for so long a time, he had been the guardian of his
youth and fortunes. But his heart reproached ~him for the still
grateful fee ing of satisfaction, which he vainly endeavored to sub-
due, and w ~ch continually reminded him that, in . this quarter,
there was* o lotiger an obstacle to his own successes. It ~was
to overco e this thought that he proceeded to resume the letter
which he h d beenwritingtohismotherwhenAndres had first made
his appear nce. A few additional lines only were written, when
he flung th reed from him and closed the portfolio. His nerv-
ous system was in too much agitation to suffer him to continue at
an emplo ent which particularly demanded the utmost calm

of the spirit. He went once more to the entrance of the cabin,
and soliloquized, as if his brother were still in sight.
"Unhappy child of passion ! forever erring and repenting-only
to repeat thy error; what a destiny is thine! How shall I watch
and save thee, when it is ever thus, that some c~uel suspicion, the
offspring of thy wild temper and fierce will, continually begets
thy hostility against the hand that is outstretched in thy service!
Thou wilt go with Hernan de Soto, and it may be that I shall
not 1e with thee. Ha! Is this, then, a doubt? Is it so certain that
mine shall be a better fortune with Olivia de Alvaro than was
thine? She has refused thee,-thou, as brav~, as noble, as come-
ly as any of the ge~atlemen of Castile! Will sEe be more likely
to hearken me? It is possible; and I have a hope, a hope in
which I gladden-though I shame to own it,-based upon a broth-
er's denial and defeat! Is there reason for this hope? Do I
~not delude myself-does not Nuno de Tobar, when he encour-
ages my passion, does he not delude me also? The thought
that I too shall be scorned, makes it easy to pardon the violent
passions of my p~or Andres. Well! We shall shortly see!
Now that he no longer pursues the quest, it will be for me to
know what is my fate. A few days, and it may be that I also
go with thee, my brother, into the wild forests of the Apalachian.
And yet, were there other fields of venture, Hernan de Soto
should have no help of mine. He hath favored, rather than
frowned upon, these jealousies of his Spanish followers. They
hold me in their h~te, if not their disesteem; and envy me the
very skill and knowledge upon which they build somewhat for
their h9pe of succ~ss. Let Olivia but smile upon my prayer,

the dawn; while we retrace our footsteps once more to the

the features within his gaze. It might be pride and

sity that it continued to provoke. Some moments
~umed in this serpent-like gaze, and all the while she

side her, and folding his arms about her waist; lifted her with an
air of great affection in his embrace. Then it was that she
started, looked wildly about h or a moment, and then, distin-
guishing the intruder, fixed upon him a countenance expressive
of any feeling but that of tenderness or regard. In an instant
the full, quick, keen vitality, came like a flood of light into her
great dark eyes; her lips quivered,, and were suddenly closed
fast, as if with sudden resolution. She started from the cush-
ions, and shook herself free from his grasp, as if he had been a
viper.
"You!,' she exclaimed in a tone of suspicion and appehen-
sion.
"Even so, Olivia. Who else'? But what now'? Why this
passion'? What has vexed you'? What startles you'?"
How long have you been here'?" she asked wildly.
"But this moment," he answered: "I thought you slept."
She drew a deep sigh, as if suddenly relieved.
"It is late," she said; "I will retire."
"Late! what of that'? Have you any cares for to-morrow'?
Sit, my beauty, and tell us who have been your guests-who
hath been here'? What are your tidings'?"
"I have none," she answered coldly and timidly, still moving
to retire.
"Now, saints and demons! what is in the child I" he ex-
claimed, as he endeavorEd once more to detain her in his grasp.
She shrunk from him with a visible shudder. A heavy scowl
passed over his forehead, and he spoke with closed teeth.
"What! .~till in thy Biscayan temper'? Nay,, nay, my pre-
cious one, thou shalt not leave me thus."
"Suffer me to go, uncle," she entreated, as he caught her hand.
"Why, so I will, when thou hast answered me what has put
thee in this temper again'? Methought, when I left thee last, that
thou hadst been sobered-hadst -grown wiser. What has
w~gught thee into this passion, at a moment when brave cava-
Ue~s grow humble in thy train'? Or dost thou repent thee for

having dis isseA with denial this famous young gallant of Por-
tugal?"
What a change in her aspect followed this speech from his
lips! But a moment before she exhibited aversion, but it was
coupled wi timidity and a feeble, tearful apprehension. In a
moment th timidity wa~ gone-the tear-the apprehension.
Her eyes fi shed full with indignation as she replied
"What! thou hast again descended to the office of the spy'?
Thou hast nce more placed thyself in secret watch upon my
actions'?"
"Not up n thy actions, child-not upon thee, but upon those
who approa h thee. I know thy danger from these gallants, and
it is in de ree as I fear them, my Olivia, that I keep watch
over thee, a thy guardian-thy protector, child-"
He renewed the attempt to take her hand as he spoke.
* "Touch e not," she cried. "Oh, wolf assigned to keep the
lamb!"
"What wouldst thou have, child'? It is surely needful that
I hold ever resent in mind the treasure that I am set to keep."
"Oh, fien ! and thou smil'st as thou speak'st thus dreadfully."
"Nay, na , not a fiend, Olivia, only, I grant you, not exactly
an angel. B lieve me, I am not a whit worse than most other men."
"Thou sl dearest thy race."
"No, trul , no. Most guardians, having such precious treasure
in their keejj~ing, would take care of it as I have done. Have I
not kept thee well, my child-as tenderly, as closely? Shall
others rob ~ne of the treasure before mine own eyes'? Ah,
child ~ if I loved' thee less, I had been spoiled of thee before.
It. is in my f~4ndness, Olivia,-"
"Oh! cease to vex me with these cruel taunts! What gain is it
to thee now, ~at thou shouldst add a sting to a sorrow'? If to
thee I owe t~ie loss of hope, why jibe me ever with this loss'?
Why hold l4efore mine eyes the terrible picture of the woe
thou hast planted forever in my soul'? Forbear thy mockeries.

"Nay, I would not mock thee, Olivia. I but ~peak to thee the
language of a sober truth. I do, indeed, love thee, my child-.
love thee as my own-would have thee ever as mine own, and
thou mightst s~e in this fondness the secret of that distrust which
dogs the heels of all others. Give not way to this blindness and
madness, which can profit neither thee nor me, and see the love
which I feel for thee, my child I"
"Peace! Peace! thou maddenest me when thou tallest to
me of thy love !"
"A truce to thy passion, Olivia. Thou art not wise in its
indulgence. It spoils thy beauty. It takes too much from thy
charm of face, as it disturbs the peace of thy heart. Thus ruffled,
thouremind'stmepainfully of thy Biscayanmother, who was fiercer
in her wrath than the hurricane of these tropic countries. She
would suddenly grow convulsed like thyself; with a tempest that
threatened everything with destruction; but she was not, as thou
art, capable of soothing all down again to the most beautiful
repose I"
"Her passion were much the most fitting to mate with thine!
0! would that she were here! Mother! 0! mother! Where
art thou now? See'st thou thy child-into what hands-into
what fate she has fallen-without hope-as one who drowns,
with all the seas upon him, and no strength to struggle upward
into lif&amp;?"
She threw herself once more upon the cushions of the divan,
her face downward. One single sob escaped her, but one, for
* at that moment the hand of Don Balthazar, in seeming tender-
ness, was placed upon her neck. His touch seemed to recall the
more fiery feeling with which she had at first received him. She
started up, and repulsed him with a spasmodic fierceness.
"Thy touch is like so much poison! Beware, lest I go mad!
Thou wilt drive me too far, as if thou hadst not already driven me
to perdition! Canst thou not pity-wilt thou not spare me? I
have been weak-I know that I am weak still-b:at I feel that 1
have a strength in me that may become fearful for mischief; if
not for good. Uzicle, it were~better, far better, ere you rouse

that strength into exercise, that you should drive your dagger
into both of ~ur hearts."
The brow ~f Don Balthazar was contracted; but a determined
effort dissipa~ed the cloud. His rOle was that of conciliation.
He was not unwilling to acknowledge and to respects that fearful
strength which she asserted herself to possess, though latent. He
felt that he had gone too far. He had given her no credit for
that character~ of which she was now making a fearful exhibition.
Nor, indeed, had he hitherto found any reason to suspect the
presence of such fierce energies. She had hitherto borne her-
self so mildly, if not feebly, that he had come rather to slight, if
not to despise, the weakness of a nature, which had been almost
wholly controlled by his superior will. That he had been so
successful hitherto, in this respect, was due to causes already
glanced at-the seclusion of her mode of life, her extreme youth,
and her imperfect e ucation. The instincts of her heart, suddenly
springing into birth, had opened to her eyes a new survey, and
filled her soul with consciousness not less overwhelming and
oppressive than stra ge. He was beginning to discover the full
extent of her develop ments, when it was perhaps too late. Re-
garding her as a chil ,a~pliant creature in his hands, he had but.
too much given way to that satirical temper which marked his
character, It was n w his aim to soothe. He was not practiced
in this art, but he s piously addressed himself to the endeavor.
"T'ruly, dear~Olivia thou art most perverse to-night. Is it at the
moment when I am ost grateful to thee~-that thou wouldst re-
pulse my acknowle ments ? I do but seek to show how greatly
I prize that dutiful a section which alone, I doubt not, has caused
thee to dismiss this oung and insolent knight of Portugal."
"Dutiful affection !" she exclaimed, interrupting him with a
bitter look and acce , which effectually interpreted into scornful
irony the two words which she had borrowed from his speech.
"And was it not t is, Olivia ?"
"Once for ~ll, Se7 or, let this folly cease. There is no policy
in this hypocrisy. ou caust deceive me no longer. I have
no need to deceive t ee. We know each other. Thou knowest

me---thou hast sounded the hollows of my heart, and the know-
ledge thou hast gained has been fatal to all my hopes. Thou
knowest that I owe t1~ee. neither duty nor affection-that, if any-
thing, I owe thee ha e only-an unforgiving hate that should*
dream of nothing but revenge. But I have no such dream.
Give nie but peace-such peace, at least, as may spring from
thy forbearance, and if I meet thee with smiles no longer, I shall
at least assail thee with no reproaches. I rejected the suit of
Don Andres de Vasconselos simply because- alas! why
should I furnish thee with a reason for this rejection? Enough,
that it was with no regard to thy interests, or thy desires, that
I was moved to decline his prayer.
"And yet, that thou didst so, is a great gain to me, as well as
to Do Soto. Failing thee and thy hacienda, this knight will now
be ready to seek for a slower fortune amongst the Apalachian
of Florida. We had lost him but for this. He and his brother
both-that more wily adventurer-had~ set earnest eyes upon
thy possessions. I doubt not that they knew well the number
of thy slaves and acres, and the exact annual product of thy
jancis.
"Oh! be silentSefior-be. silent, for very shame. It befits
not thee, least of all, to impute such sordid passions to these
noble gentlemen."
Even at this moment, when fully convinced of the necessity of
conciliation, and really desirous not to offend, the habitual sneer
of the uncle obtained the ascendency.
"And thou persuades thyself-though I wonder not-that it
is thy charms alone which have wrought upon the affections of
these knights of Portugal."
The sarcasm smote sharply on the woman sensibilities of the
damsel. She replied instantly:
"I think not of it! I would that I could think of neither them
nor thee. Small pleasure, indeed, do I find in thinking of thee,
and smaller the. profit, in such condition as is mine, in giving
thought to knight or noble, on whose scutcheon there rests no

-he carefully adapted his speech to the task of soothing. In
some measure he succeeded. She grew calmer, and milder, and
he now approached her where she sat upon the divan, and with-
out interruption, save from her sobs occasionally, continued. the
glozing speech which was to quiet her anger. She answered him
but seldom, and then capriciously-sometimes with tears only,
and again with some burst of indignant speech, that drove him
back to his first positions.
"Oh! why wilt thou, dearest Olivia, give way to these pas-

gloomy reflections'? They nothing help your situation or mine.

"And mine! mine is breaking 1"-was the wild finish which
her lips sobbed out at the conclusion of his sentence. The deep

of her lips.
"Nay, nay, my child; not so! The world is but begun with

anything that I do not feel! But of what avail thou ask'st? Of
what avail, indeed, except for' curses-perhaps for 4eath! But
that the grief can bring no relief is sufficient cause for suffering.
Could .it avail-could anything avail-would I suffer thus?

little measure in her anger as her fierce Biscayan mother. Yet
how lately hath this sc~rt of fury developed itself in her., How
wonderfully to-night did she resemble her. There was the same
dark, fiery eye, sending out ~udden flashes; the same sudden
swelling of the great v~in across her forehead, till it seemed big
to bursting; the same show of the teeth, gleaming white, close
set, and gnashing at moments the thin lips that seemed to part
and turn over, like those of a hungry tiger. What a resemblance!
I never saW the like before. Yet, when I beheld the likeness,
that~ I should have dealt in the old sarcasm; that I should not
have forborne. I should have known enough of the mother, to
have waited for the moment of her exhaustion. Who takes the
fish will do wisely n~t to thwart him in the struggle. W~hy
should he not sti~uggle, ~since it avails nothing against his capture?
He is ~o much the soo~ier in the toils. Let him beat the water
while he lists, until it becomes easier to die than to strive. Such
is the true art of deali4g with women in their passion, especially
when they carry tempers of such intensity. It is in her exhaus-
tion only that she yiel4ls; and the exhaustion comes the sooner
where the flurry is so ~xtreme. With opposition, she finds new
strength; but, taken fr~ the lull, with fondness or persuasion, and
she cannot help but yi~ld!"
He paused, rested lAs elbow on the table, and supported his*
brow upon his hands f4~r a whilein silent meditation. A few mo-
ments only passed thus; his mood was too much excited for quiet.
He started up fro~n hi~ seat, and again instantly resumed.
"Something has gone wrong," he' muttered. "She hath dis-

tainted. I preferred th~t the stains shouldforever remind me of
my triumph at tl~e last ;-ay, in the moment when he fondly
fancied he had all to himself the happiness which.he had despoiled
of! He, at least enjoyed it only in his dreams !"
The door opened. T~he soliloquy was arrested. He restored
the dagger to its sheath, and looked up at the intruder.. This
was an old woman of about sixty, a mestizo, a cross of the negro
and the red-man. She ~ombined, in very equal degree, the iiiost
conspicuous characteristics of the two. She had the high cheek
bones, the thin lips, the full chin, the glossy dark flowing hair of
the Indian, with the rel+eating forehead and flat nose of the black.
Tier eyes were of the sly, sharp, gipsy cast, the brows quite gray,
and thus in singular co~ftrast with her hair, which was quite as
black as in the days of ~ier childhood ;-if; indeed, days of child-
hood had ever been kno~Yn to her! She had not the appearance of
one who had ever been child. The wear and tear of vexing pas-
sions had scarred her fare with every sign of premature old age.
Her skin was a series ofi wrinkles, like the ripples of spent billows
upon a gradually rising shore. Her teeth were gone, with the
exception of a couple of very sharp snags, that stood out in
front, between her thin lips, like those of a squirrel. She had no
flesh. upon her bones, t~nd her clothes, thin and light, according
with climate and season, hung upon her skeleton form as if from
a peg upon the wall! A gauze handkerchief; wrapped imper-
fectly abov~ her neck, ~uffered her skinny bosom to appear, but
without increasing her attractions. Her figure, thus betraying
the signs of age, was yet singularly erect. Her step was firm,
though stealthy. You saw that she set her foot down firmly,
though. you did not h~ar it; and, though moving with caution,
she was yet quick of movementt. She did not wait for a sum-.
mons, but advanced at ~nce to her master, and stood up before
him; her eyes lighting {zp beneath the gray brows, like lamps of
naphtha in sepulchral caverns.

"There is something~ more. Are yowsure, Anita, that she has

"No !"
"Well! I am sure that she has made some discovery! The
question is what ?-and how much? She knows the worst-that
is certain."
The woman grinned.
"But does she know by what means we have worked? You
say she eats and drinks little. Is this only the lack of appetite,
or does she suspect he~r food ?"
The woman avowea her ignorance.
"But she ate and drank yesterday ?"
"Yes; but very litt~le."

The woman took a small phial from her bosom and held it up
to the light. It contained a slightly greenish liquor. She desig..
nated, with her finger ~1pon the phial, the quantity given.
"That should be enough, certainly! But if she refuses the
draught-rejects the food! That is the question. The next
question is, whether she refuses from want of appetite, simply?
You must change the food, Anita. Tempt her appetite. Get

The dark-souled man shuddered, as he heard, and saw the
fierce, eager, intense glare of the speaker's eyes. He said hur-.
"No! Anita! no! I will not that. I will that she should
live-iive---yes !-.-the time is not yet come 1,'
"It is as you say! Yet had I not forborne to give her this
poison, but that thou hadst in thy power a more terrible death!
I had rather thou shouldst slay her-thou, of her own blood:--.
and I saw thee do it."
" I slay her, Anita! Thou art mad! I tell thee, I would not
touch her life, for the world, if "
"Ay, W-if she saves thee not the danger and the trouble. But
It was the life of the heart and the hope, and the woman that I
beheld thee bent to slay, and thy poison was so much more fatal
than mine! Ha! ha! ha!"
*"Oh! get thee hence, Anita! The wine begins to work in thee.
But help thyself to another goblet, and to sleep now. Thy watch
has been a weary one."
The woman yawned at the suggestion, filled the goblet, drank,
and was about to retire without a word, when she seemed to re-
collect, and again spoke, as usual, in those low, subdued tones,
which, when employed to utter passionate language, are so sin-.
gularly impressive.

THE moment that Olivia reached her own chamber, she threw
herself prostrate before fine portrait of the Virgin that hung
against the wall of the apartment. She uttered no prayer, no
sob, no sound; shed no tear; gave no outward sign, beyond her
prostration, of the object of her quest, or of the agony that
preyed upon her; asked not, in language, for the peace and se-
curity which she sought, but lay at length, her humility and grief
apparent only in the one action, as if with the conviction that
all her woes were known; her contrition; the shame from which
she suffered; the faint hope which she dared not encourage; the
fond passion, which. she felt to be pure as grateful, but whh~h her
conscience bade her not to entertain. She did not once look up
to the be* and blessing features of that Mother of Love and
Mercy, whose eyes; she yet felt, were looking sweetly and ten-
derly down, even into the secret recesses of her own full and
bursting heart. And thus she lay, prone, motionless, as if her
life and breathing had ceased in the utter prostration of her hope
and person.
There is something very touching in the spectacle c~f a person
totally ignorant of religion as a subject of thought and examina-
tion, who yet welcomes it~ as a faith; who believes with sponta-
neous consent; who receives it as a mystery; seeks not to ana-
lyze or solve it; prefers it, indeed, as a mystery~ and confides,

degree of faith and sympathy which .1 need in my present
strait?" The inquiry was a natural one. Every young damsel
inclines to put trust in her waiting maid, and in this relation
Juana stood to her mistress. But the latter had too long had
experience of the characteristics of the maid-servant. She
was ~not ignorant of her cunning, but she had~ good reason to
believe that this was all pledged to the service of her uncle,
through the medium of the old hag Anita, who was the grand-
mother of the girl. As for her affections and sympathies, these
Olivia had never yet been able to awaken. She had been indul-
gent and considerate; had bestowed her gifts freely, but beyond
the single moment in which they were bestowed, she had no
proof that the benefit was remembered with gratitude. The
blank, indifferent, stolid features which she surveyed were full of
discouragement, and after a brief examination of them, the un-
hapjy damsel, with a sigh, averted her eyes, abandoned her pur-
pose of solicitation-if she had entertained any-and submitted
to be disrobed in profound silence. The girl was not disposed to
bi~eak this silence. She performed' her task drowsily. It was
n~t a protracted one: and this done, she' retired for the night,
leaving her mistress alone, once more, to commune with her
own sorrows;
91           "There is no h\ope !" she exclaimed~ mournfully, sitting in her
night dres~ where the maid had left her, her hands folded. upon
her lap, ani her moist eyes looking vacantly up at the Virgin
wit an expression of the most woeful self-abandonment.
"Yet why should.1 hope! What is there to hope? What

produced into fruits even; the integrity of which one would sup-
pose could not be invaded unless by some external proofs being
appar4t. In this way only could she account for the dreamy
and pr6strating moods which she had occasionally' felt during the
day. Here, then, was a young woman, of bigh birth, proud con-
nections, and ample fortune, an unsuspected prisoner in her :own
dwelling, denied, virtually, the necessary aliment of life. Truly
the case was a pitiable one !-Olivia de AWaro, sustained during
all the scenes in which we lave beheld her, chiefly by the intens-
ity of her excitements, was now near to fainting from absolute
want of food.
The cravings of nature were not to be withstood. She rose
from her prostrate position; seizing her lamp, which she shaded
carefully with a handkerchief on all sides but one, she cautiously
opened the door of her chamber and entered upon the passage
which, more or less directly, conducted to almost every apart.
ment in the house. Adjoining her own was a small room,
not much more than a closet, which had been assigned to the
waiting maid Juana. Into this she looked boldly; intending, if
the girl were yet awake, to speak to her of some object, any
but that which she really had in view. But the girl, as she ex-
pected, from a previous knowledge ~of her habits, already slept
profoundly. She closed the door cautiously behind her, and,
with feet set down carefully, she stole along the passage leading
'to the opposite quarter of the house. The passage, at a certain
point, divided, one arm conducting to the apartment of Don Bal-
thazar, the other to guest-chambers; opposite to these was a saloon
which was usually employed in the colder seasons of the year.
The "stairway, terminating the passage, led below to servants'
apartments, l~itehen, and store-rooms, and constituted, in particu-
lar, the province over which Anita presided. Hither were the
footsteps of Olivia directed; but when she reached the place
where the passage divided-.-her own lamp being shaded-she
caught a glimpse of a light streaming from beneath the door of
her uncle's chamber. Up to this moment the house had been
apparently wrapt m sileiice.; now she fancied she heard voices

resumed her lamp, and proceeded by the little flight which con.
ducted below, to the apartments in the re r, which were assigned
especially to Anita. These were easily a cessible; Anita never
sixspecting any visitor, and least of all the ne in question, during
her absence. Here, the poor girl, after curiously surveying the
region into which she had not before often penetrated, began her
search after food. She reasonably suppo ed that any provisions
which she should find in these precincts ould be found undrug.
ged. There was a basket. of cakes, su as had never been
brought to her; of these she gathered a small number, taking
care so to select them as not to disturb the general appearance
of the pile. She found some "cold baked meats," also-some
fragments of a bird-pie, and other matters of the same sort, such
as had not been displayed among the cates usually provided for
her. Anita, it was apparent, was by no means regardless of her
own appetites. She had a taste for nice things, and, like most
persons. of inferior race, was in the possession of an enormous
appetite. Olivia fed freely while storing her spoils away in a lit-
tie basket which she had appropriated from a collection in the
closet of the crone. With the basket in one hand and her little
half-shaded lamp in the other, she prepared to effect her return to
her own chaiiaber; but hardly had she emerged from the old
woman's apartments, when she heard the shuffling of feet upon
the stair-ifight, while a suppressed cough attested the approach
of the very person upon whose domain she had been trespassing.
Here was a dilemma. To say that she had any fears, in the
event of discovery, would be absurd. The domain was hers.
The food which she had seemed to pilfi~r was, in fact, the proceeds
of her own estates. But the action would have betrayed her se-
cret suspicions, which. it was her policy for the present to conceal,
and would only prQmpt her enemies to resort to new schemes
which it might not be possible for her to detect and overthrow.
With thebitter feelings of her soul duly increased with the necessity
whichshenowfeltof concealment under these circumstances, Olivia
silently receded along the path she had come. Stillthe shuffling of the
old woman's feet was heard, the cough hioreased in. frequency

the place of her concealment. Once sh~ abs~Autely proceeded
tQ take from it some of its articles of be~4urniture; to dispose
of cloaks arid shawls, and rearrange th~ disordered drapery.
Olivia, all the while, cowering and crouching like a guilty person,
dreading to be discovered and haled into the light. But she es-
caped; the crone receded to other parts ~f the room, having, it
would seem, a variety of domestic care~, separate from those
which concerned the young lady and the iI~on, her uncle. Mean-
while, the damsel watched all her proceeding~ with no small in-
terest. With careful finger, she made for herself an aperture be-
tween the massed garments* upon the horse, through which she
could behold all that took place within th~ chamber. And it was
with momently increasing-interest that s e saw what numerous
cares occupied the soul of that old wom n, momently hovering
over the very verge of existence. How she had accumulated;
with what method she examined and arra ged; with what caution
she put away; with what heed she cou ted and reviewed her
treasures, as if she was required to provi e for a thousand years.
Olivia was confounded at the extent and s rt of possessions which
the aged crone could show; the constant s oliations of a long life.
There were chests and boxes, all of whi h she opened and ex-
amined, lifting to the light, and surveying some- of the contents,
with the same gratification, no doubt, whi h she felt when she had
first pulled them from the no!Ae lord or Ia y whom she served, her
master or their guests. Olivia beheld li tle trinkets there lifted
up to sight, which she herself might laim. She recognized
others, which had been the property of f iends. These were all
conimonly associated with treasures of uite another character.
Among the possessions of Anita there was uite an armory. There
were hauberk, and helm, and lance-head, and dagger, an silver
spur, and brass, and gorget,. and coat-of- ail, and escanpi of cot-
ton, and bright targe of polished steel. But we forbear he cat-

That n~orning, Philip de Vasconselos had eaten his humble
meal alo~e, and in silence. Andres was~ absent ~ whither he
knew not, and the younger brother was of a temper, and just
now in su~h a m od, that it was only a safe policy ~in the elder,
not to seem to curious in any of his affairs. Philip, though
naturally and inanely troubled about the fate of Andres,
sympathizing w th him very sincerely in his disappointments,
was yet t0o human to be deeply grieved by the one misfortune
-over al1---whi h his brother felt, in the denial of his mistress.
It would not, in eed, have been quite in nature, not to have felt
his own h~pes r vive pleasurably at the knowledge. He was
conscious of a exulting feeling in his bosom; accordingly;
which, knowing ~ts source, he labored, though unsuccessfully, to
school an4 to re uke. But this labor did not prevent him from
making hi~ toilet that morning with extreme care, and resolving
to visit th~ fair Olivia. In this purpose he was seconded by the
counsels o~' the ~ay gallant Nuno de Tobar, who suddenly broke
in upon hi~n, and finding him alone, gave free vent t~ his encour-
agements. Somehow, he too had heard of the defeat of Andres,
and he urged it as one of the sigus in favor of his friend. But
Philip shook hi head gravely. He valued the Lady Olivia too
highly to i'ancy that she would be easy of attairrment. His pas-
sion ~was too ea nest, not to prompt him to a very severe ques-
tioning of his wn merits, and to this effect was his reply to
Tobar. But th latter loudly denounced his excessive modesty,
and urged a th usand proofs, each conclusive to his own audacious
spirit, for the encouragement of his friend. In the end, they
proceeded together to the dwelling of the lady.
In the meanwhile, her uncle had suddenly made his appear-
ance, bringing with him another visitor. This was a gaily dress-

Olivia was to wed with any body, this was the person whom
uncle was most pleased to tolerate. He may have had sp
reasons for this preference. Such, at least, was the belie
Olivia, to whom Don Balthazar had more than once spoke
the subject. He himself frequently afforded to the young
lant the means of being with his niece in private. Don Au

the externals of devotion. But the essentials of an earnest

The ordinary secret of this ordinary gentleman, who, even ii
workings of his passions, obeys rigidly a conventional arr~
ment, was that which made his policy ; and to do the agreeab
his mistress, as a carpet knight, was the extent of his perf
ance in the effort to secure fav~~r. Had Olivia been of a
temper, De Sinolar would have proved a formidable nw

doubts, yet Was it my thought that Don Hernan had shown you
the better argue t."
"* They say righ ly, Sefiorita," replied Vasconselos to Olivia,
and scarcely notice g Do Sinolar-" who say that I have yet de-
termined nothing. I am truly but half resolved to depart, yet
fully half incline to remain. There be private reasons for
this uncertainty. whether Don Hernan will succeed in per-
suading me-and ~t is one of my doubts if he desires ~so to do
-will greatly rest upon the force of other and opposite persua-
sions than those o war. Perhaps, it were only wise with me,
to yield blindly to Don ilernan's arguments, and look nothing
farther."
It was the tone ith which this last sentence was spoken, and
the look which accompanied, which held the meaning more sig-
nificantly than the ~vords themselves. The sweet, sad resigna-
tion in both went 4irect to the heart of Olivia. But she cast
her eyes upon the ~Ioor and remained silent. But De Sinolar,
who was conscious of nothing but the words spoken, and who was
no adept in looking below the surface of any thing, proceeded in
his usual manner.
"Well, Seflor, it will be needful that you should decide short-
ly. In a few days ~we shall have the tournament, and inafew
more, the caravels ~ivill be all ready to receive the armament.
Then will you embark the horses and artillery. These the first.
Then will the foot soldiers go on board, and at the last the
knights and gentlemen. They are baking famous quantities of
bread, even now, a~ Roja's, and la Granja's. The adelantado is
eager to be at worl~ among the heather savages, stripping the
gold from the altar~ and the treasure fro the rich cities of the
Apalachian. Ah! ~ady Olivia, when th se things are going on,

we shall be as ~luil and quiet here as if we had never
either dance or music.
"These gay knights will all be on the path of con uest.
For my part, I say let them conquer! I have no passion
quest, and I have no faith in its fruits. I believe them t
delusions. One man gets off with a sound head an a full
but a hundred pays. for him with deadly wounds, broken
and beggary forever! If one could, be sure that he sh
the one, and not one of the hundred, why, it we e plea
adventure; but where there's but one white bea to a s

"Bug the fame, Seffor-the glory'?" said Olrvi

answers all my ambition. It lacks but a mistress to be

And here he looked with a sudden tenderness awards
"And have you never felt the eager desire for ~attle, ~
quoth Tobar :-" That joyous desire for the strif~ of swc
the crash of lances, which makes the head thro1c~ with d

"Your huma~iity is commendable, Sefior," was the somewhat
cold response of Vasconselos, who, indeed, had scarcely heeded
what the other ~ad been saying; and now turned from him with a
contempt which was sufficiently apparent. But the other was by
no means discomfited by an expression which he clearly beheld.
He replied very~ promptly and very indifferently, as if' his social
position-his w~alth-put him quite beyond reproach.
"Ah! you scarcely mean that, I know, Sei~or Don Philip:
but it matters nothing. I don't care who knows that I am re-
solved to live while I can, and risk no bones upon reputation.
If heads are to be cloven, let them take the. hardest: if brains
are to be scattered, it needs only that you choose such a&amp;can waste
little: if hard blows are to be struck, get those men only for
the work who have been trained to the boucan. If you love
fighting, Don P~iilip, it is well for you: not for me. I love it
not. You have tried your hand at it, and it suits you. You
have fought against the Moors. You have already had a taste
of Floridian fig~iting, and I have seen you carry yourself; even
sportively, against Bartolomeo de Gallegos, and Sei~or, Nuno,

I should entreat to a supper of blades and lances. I am only at
conflict with gentle woman," smiling sweetly on Olivia ;-" and
leave the pagan to such brave knights as yourself. By the way,
Senior Don Philip, they tell me you served with Francis Pizarro
in Peru! I ha forgotten that."
"It mattered ot," answered Vasconselos coldly.
"Now there is a man for you, that Francis Pizarro. He's
the rough cust mer for a weak stomach. He's what I call a
hero! Talk of Oortez, indeed! How should Hernan Cortez
be a hero'? I'v seen him a hundred times when he was nothing

concern, I fancy, to you, Sei~orita."
"And wherefore not, Sefior?"
"You take little delight, I fear, in such exercises as challenge
the best regarc~s of knighthood. I have seen you at very few
of the gentle passages between the knights."
"True; but I am not insensible. I have heard full reports
of their performances, and found delight in the accounts of such
grace and valor, and courtesy and skill, as has been rarely seen."
"Yet would I have beheld you, Seiiorita, among the gay beau-
ties of this island court, who have stimulated courtesy by their
grace, and pro~npted achievement to great things by their ap..
proving smiles. I have looked for you, Sefiorita, very often,
and,-.---may I say it,-hav"e sometimes left the field, as, seeing
you not, it has seemed to me to lack its best attraction."
"Ah! Seflor, it is the wont of Cavaliers to use this sort of
speech to foolish damsels. And why should you leave a field,
where there have been so many beauties to cheer, and so many
sweet voices to encourage ?"
"Yet was there one, of all,-one only, lady, whom I most
desired to behold."
"AhI and why should the Seilor Philip be insensible to the
praises which have daily hailed his passages on every hand?
Who has wontheapplauses and the prizes at the several tourneys?
Whose lance path been most honored in the conflict ?-whose
name been most sounded ?-in whose fame have the multitude

" Alas! lady, all these tributes are of little value in the ears
of Philip de Vasconselos, compared with the sweeter assurances
thatmight fall from the lipsof one, the loveliestvirgin of all Cuba 1"
The eyes of Vasconselos were fastened tenderly, as he spoke,
upon those of Olivia. Hers sunk, bashfully, beneath his glance;
and a warm re~1 flush quickly overspread her cheeks. Her hand lay
beside him updn the sofa, which she partly occupied. His fingers
fell hesitatingly upon it; and it was not withdrawn. She was

eagerly, and more tenderly.
"It may be that mine is the sin of presumption, l~dy; b

~The hand was instantly withdrawn, and so hastily, as

In faith, you do; and I must sing to you a merry song ere I grow
gloomy as the night. You shall hear a cheerful ditty, such as will
make you laugh, and make us forget-forget-be very forgetful."
She would have risen, and motioned to the guitar lying upon a
table; but he held her firmly by the hand. He was bewildered
by her cond~itct, but grew more and. more firm as he coritempla..
ted her. Tie had s&amp;en too much of the world, and of human
nature, not to perceive that there was some mystery in the pro..
feeding. How else should he account for the feverish hurry of
her manner, at such a moment, so utterly unlike her conduct,
during all other periods ?-how, for that sobbing sigh, that con-
vulsive shuiider, and those forceckhusky accents while delivering
words ostensibly meant to be playful and sportive? Vasconselos
was now no~ to be deceived. He saw that~ the gaiety was all
assumed on~y ;-yet wherefore? He was more ready to believe
that there w~s agony, rather than merriment, in her spirit at that
moment.  ~I'hen why should she seek to sport with emotions, so
sacred, in his bosom, when she had always before shown him a
respect approaching to reverence? Vasconselos felt instinctively
that the damsel sought under the guise of levity only to conceal
the activity ~nd presence of deep and painful emotions. He felt
and sa'~ all this; but it was not the moment, nor was his the
mood, hav g advanced thus far, to be diverted from his object.
He still kept his grasp upon her hand. He looked steadily into
her eyes. They answered his gaze wildly. She trembled all
over. He ~poke.
"Olivi~lady-I cannot n~w be baffled-I must speak, and
you must answer me. It is too~great a matter, to rAe-too
vital to my soul's life, to suffer me to be silent longer, or to
ieave you ' without having an answer. Yet you must not suspect
me of unkindness. I see that you suffer. I am not deceived by
this show of merriment. I feel that there is a secret sorrow which
you vainly struggle to conceal-'--"
"No! no! no secret-I-O! Seflor, release me-let me go !"
And she burst into a passion of tears, and 1~uried her face in
her hands upon the arm of the settee. Vasconselos bent over,

e1asped one of her hands in his own, and was about to pass
a m about her waist, when a sudden footstep was he~ rd in
room. In- the same moment Don Balthazar spoke, -ut a -d
gle word,-but it sounded in the ears of Olivia* like the vo
of the Angel Monkir calling up the dead.
" Olivia !"
*She started to her feet-looked wildly in the face of Vasce
selos,-who had withdrawn ~a pace, and was .observingv Don B
thazar-and then tottered towards her uncle. Philip darted f~
ward to help her, when she recovered herself; bowed lightly
her lover, and followed her uncle from the room. Scgrcely li
sL e got into the passage when Don Balthazar said to her quiclf
- and she now observed that his face was very pale
" When did you see Anita last ?"
"Not since last night. Why ?"
" She is dead !"
" Dead !"
" Ay, dead ! of old age, I suppose. Died in a fit !~ But
to her. You will find her in her room. Meanwhile, I will
cuse you to these gentlemen."
He disappeared.. Qlivia was frozen to the spot, and speed
less. Her conscious soul was full of nameless terrors. S~
too readily, divined the cause of the old woman's death, a~
th:ugh no purpose of crime wa~s in her mind when shie mix
with the contents of the wine-flask the potion from the phial, si
shuddered with such a horror as might well become the guilt
the murderess. When Don Balthazar returned from speakih
with Vasconselos and his friend, he found~ Olivia where he h~
left her, rather the -statue of a frozen woman than a livin
breaathing sufferer. He was startled by her evident incapacit
and putting his arms about her, was about to convey her to h~
chamber; but the touch of his fingers recalled her energies. 'SI
revolted from the contact with as great a shuddering a~ she fd

felt that she ec uld not endure that spectacle. She hurried to her

the couch. TI e new catastrophe, in which she had so much par-

DoN BALTHAZAR found no difficulty in sending o the tw'J
ors. After the departure of Olivia, they had but little 11
to remain. Her uncle was not much a favorite wi h them
was known to be a hard and selfish man, who was believe~
rightly, to.have no sympathies with either. Still, e Was
of the court, and could put on, when he pleased, t e mann

the pleasure of giving them further entertainme t. H~
them, without scruple, the cause of the present co fusion
household; and made quite a pretty story of it.
"His venerable housekeeper, who had been al ost a
to Olivia, watching and tending her youth with m re than
tal solicitude, was suddenly found dead in her sea. Wei
morning, to all appearance, at noon she had passed to judg
and this without alarming the family. Olivia w s, of c
terribly shocked by the event. She had retired console

the ugliest and most fiendish-looking human vultures you ever
beheld. As for tier attachment to Olivia, or Olivia's to her, I don't
believe a word of it. I never saw any proofs of it myself; and
have heard mar~y things which lead me to think there could be
no attachment between them. In fact, Leonora tells me that
Anita was no wore than a spy upon the poor girl, whose steps
were watched a carefully as if every bush concealed a lover,
and behind evei~y tree stood an armed n-ian ready to snatch her
up and make off with her. Be sure, Don Balthazar has no de-
sire that she should pass from any keeping but his own. He
enjoys too mucil good picking from the estates of Olivia to give
her up without a struggle. There is a strange story about a
silver mine whi~h he has somehow wholly appropriated to him-
self.; and by all accounts, he may well dread the day of reckon-
ing with the ma~ who shall become her husband. For this re -
son he keeps he~ immured as much as possible; and ftis certa
that no gentlem~tn can obtain access to his dwelling without fin -.
ing himself watched. You must continue, Philip, your visi s
when the uncle is knoWn to be busy elsewhere. There is som
thing gained, I ~am thinking, by the death of this old woma
It is a special p~o~idence in your behalf. See that you ma e
use of it."
The calculations of Nuno de Tobar, in respect to the adva -
tages gained in favor of the larger liberty of Olivia by the dea h
of Anita, were somewhat those of Olivia herself; for, in spi e
of the shock which she had received by that event, and the n t..
ural horrors which were taught her by her own secret conscious -
ness of the cause of it, she could not avoid reflecting upon t e
probable increase of her own securities in consequence. Th~y
were both deceived. That very night, the place of Anita wt~s
filled by another old woman, another creature of Don Balthaza~',
not so ugly, perhaps, or so old as her predecessor, but equally
hard fiwored and unscrupulous. Sylvia was a mestizo a14,
brought from one Qf the haciendas of the estate, a few miles~n
the country. Olivia had seen and known her before. The sigl4
of this woman, in her new situation, left her little hope of pro~~

by the death of Anita6 Sylvia was as subtle as t~te form r~ and
no less the willing tool of her employer. She ha4 all th fierce
malignity of mood characteristic of the hybrid race t'~ hich
she belonged,-a people usually of fierce passiorts, sudd n im-
pulses, capricious impulse, and tenacious, of the s~nse of ong
and injury to the latest moment of existence. I~on Ba lazar
knew his creatures well, and satisfied of ~his fact, ~Olivia, the
moment, resigned herself to despair agah~i.
But she found an unexpected ally, where she l~ast loo e~l for
one, in the person of the young serving girl, Ju4ia. s girl
was the grand-daughter of Anita. The event whi~h put a ~ther
in the place of her grandmother, had also its injurious c&amp;nse-
quences to herself: She naturally regarded l~erself s the
heiress of her kinswoman; and knowing how large and various
had been the accumulations of the latter, her expectation were
correspondingly large. To her consternation, th~ succe or to
the place of Anita at once usurped possession of all her tores.
Juana was driven out from the precincts altogether, an com-
pelled to confine herself to the little chamber whicii she h d long
occupied, adjoining that of Olivia. Sylvia had assumed he en-
tire control of the household, and her u~urpations, in a few h urs,
were such as to satisfy Juana that her expectations fr the
savings of her grandmother were all cut off. She was ld in
no more favor than her mistress, and soon found herself nder
an authority which was disposed to submit to no ques o ing.
Sylvia had her own children and grand-children to prov' for.
Juana was dreadfully indignant. She did not dare to a oach
Don Balthazar with her griefs; but she condescended to nfide
to Olivia. In her passion she revealed to her all the se ts of
their mutual prison-house, all at least that she knew, an thus,
in a measure, confirmed the unhappy girl in the conviction hich
she had already been compelled to feel that she was the v etim
of a thousand cruel arts. Juana swore to have her re e ges,
and better to secure sympathy, she promised 6livia t a she
should have redress also. What were her plans of ye ance
she did not declare; but when questioned in respect t her

means and opportunities, contented herself with a knowing loo
and 'a sagacious shaking of the head. She was naturally a st~
pid wench, but possessed that sort of animal cunning which is so
frequently found in connection with a base and feeble intellect.
For the present nothing could be extracted from her, and th
business of the household went on without disorder, and wit
no apparent interruption; But, as we shall see in the seque,
Juana was busy after a fashion of her own.
But the day, thus distinguished by the startling events whic
we have recorded, was not at an end. Olivia sat alone in th
verandah. The evening meal had been set before her by Juan
but had been carried out untasted. She had no appetite jus
then for mortal food. Her soul wa~ still agitated to its depths
as the sea that heaves up tumultuously with all its waves, thoug
the winds which have swept it with fearful strife, have wholl
passed and gone. She lay reclined upon the settee of wicker
work where we 'beheld her during her morning interview wit
Vasconselos. There was no light in the apartment; none,
fact, was necessary, while the moon glinting through groves .o
orange and. anana, sufficed for the desires of the sad and contempt
tive spirit. The gay gleams flitted over the floor of the veran
dah, and glided, stealthily and faintly, to the interior of th
apartment, otherwise dimly shaded by the massive foliage whic
curtained the opening in front. Here, saddening under th
sad sweetness of the scene, Olivia brooded,-.absorbed in ru-
minating the events and the prospects of a life, which, at its very
budding, seemed already shrouded with a blight. 'Her heart'
sunk within her as she~ thought; all was dark in the future; all
gloomy, grievous, and reproachful in the past. At length she
wept, and found a momentary relief in her tears. The big drops
forced their way through her fingers,-.tears of a bitterness

Better thou shouldst, without weapon or preparation, arous~ the

thy taunts. Beware! I have been weak, and thou hast taken me
at 'vantage. But if I am weak, I am blind no longer; and if not
strong to bear, I am, at least, tempered to resist and to resent.
The very passions thou hast goaded into existence will be my

She had risen while she spoke, and stood before him, wild and
passionate, with flashing dark eye, and white arm waving. lie
surveyed her with a stern and frowning brow, but somewhat
coldly-his lips compressed, as if with a feeling of pride and
power,.-and his eye looking into hers with the bright fixedhess
which that of the serpent is said to show when fascinating the
bird from the tree.  I1'here was a pause; the parties still regar ing
each other. She, standing, looking on him with a raised spirit, and
wild, fiery glance; he, sitting, returning the gaze steadfastly -
coolly if not calmly, and apparently reserving himself for the
proper moment. At length, he spoke, very deliberately, a~ if
measuring every syllable.

needed to speak again, as deliberately as before.
"Didst thou know, Olivia, that the poor old woman,

that I could have mingled the drug with thy own wine-cup, this
hand should fearlessly have done it ;-not, I affirm, as meaning
that it should be fatal to thy life, but as forcing you to such t~ial

Does yet depend.'~
PHILIP DR VASCONSELOS did not, as was anticipated by Donji
thazar, and warmly counselled by Nuno d~ Tobar, return in~n
diately to the attempt upon the affections of Olivia de Al~~
It would have been quite enough to preclude his visit for thaV
and the next, at least, that there had been a death in the fairli
an event, however, to which his more reckless friend attached
sort of importance. ~But/ there was another reason for dela~

the contrary, troubled $vith many misgivings, which grew ml
faculty the more he examined. The very fact that he really ~
earnestly loved, made him tremble at. the thought of precipitt~t
his fate; and the true lover is almost always prepared to di.
humbly of his own claims, in view of that supposed perfection.wh
he recognizes in the lady of his love. Besides, with the natu
delicacy of a proud and' honorable mind, conscious 'of his o
poverty, he felt the awkwardness of a suit to one who was in
possession of' great riches. He felt how easy it was to susp
the motives of such a suitor, and dreaded lest such a suspic~
should taint the mind of the lady herself. Not that he was c
posed to forego his suit because of this; or any other consid~
tion. On the contrary, he was resolved to bring it to the tri
and know the worst as soon as he could think it proper to do
But all his conclusions counselled him to delay. Nor must

LOVER'S HOPES.                  1~7
He persuaded himself that there was much in what had taken
place between himself and Olivia in that last interview, to shpw
that she was very far from insensible to his pretensions. Ii~ is
true that there were things in her carriage-some curious caprices
of mood and manner, which he found it not easy altogether
to comprehend. But there was still enough to pleasee a lov-
er; and to persuade one, even less bold and ardent than 2ur
hero, to continue a pursuit in which he had certainly suffered no
repulse. She had evaded his application, but she had showi~ia
peculiar sensibility at his approach. She had trifled somewhat
when he was seriously earnest, but what was the meaning of her
tremors when her fair white hand lingered within his grasp? and
had she not encouraged his return ?-and had she not declared an
interest in his presence in Cuba, in language too impressive to be,.
wholly without that desirable signification which the lover seeks?
Vasconselos was very far from being discouraged-nay, without
heeding the confident assurance of Nuno de Tobar, he felt a new
hope springing within his bosom at every moment of increased
reflection; and, ere the day was well over, he had resolved to
bring his doubts to an issue, at least, before the departure of the
expedition. It was his farther resolution, if successful in his
suit, to abandon the adventure with De Soto. For that matter,
he had partly determined thus, whatever might be the result of~is
courtship. This conclusion was reached that very night, and
the next morning, when he was visited by Tobar, he unhesitat-
ingly declared it, to the great consternation of that young gallant.
The latter enabled him to do so, without effort, by rallying him
on the score of his amour.
"Where were you last night, 'Philip? You' promised to be
with us, and broke faith. Truth to say, we had the merriest
night of it in the tent of Juan de Anasco. Better flasks of Xe~es'
were never opened to Don Ferdinand. All cried aloud against
you, and cursed your drowsy courtship, which seems to be noto-
rious throughout the Island. Now, my good fellow, if you must
be in love, there is no good reason why you should' be out of the

world. Every body asks for you-they all look for you mv
You are lost to all good fellowship."
A' You are likely to lose me still more completely than
do now, Nuno. Some day you will fail to see me altogether
mean, indeed, to separate myself wholly from such a band
vicious profligates, who have no faith in anything more lo~
than ~ pearl oyster, and yield their hearts to nothing less per~
sive than a gold mine. What should I do with such people;
who still believe in lQve and beauty, and have a heart still o
to the pleadings of a womail? That I do love is sufficient re~
why I should leave such companions. From this day I am gc
to quit you all. I propose ev~n to forego the expedition to F
ida. It needs me not;' and there are good reasons wherefore
should abandon it."
"Now the blessed saints foref'end, that~ you should speak E
ously this resolution, my friend. Why, Philip de Vasconse
this is mere madness. What reasons can you have'? That
love and would marry, and may marry Olivia de Alvaro, is
sufficient cause, I trow, since the one stands not in the way of'
other, if there be any settled purpose in your mind to go."
"Aye, but there is none."
"How! I thought your going with the expedition was quil
~ett1ed matter. I know that the Adelantado counts confided
~pon your going, and holds it of large importance to the interest~
~he e4edition that you should go: for you are the only person
~ll the party who knows the tongue of the Floridian, and thej
~ages to his country."
"I did, in some degree, prepare and consent to depart '~
the Adelantado, but if he counts upon my going and values
performance, he hath taken but a strange course for showing
the estimate he hath of my services."
"Truth, he hath neglected you somewhat."
* "But this availeth little, and I have no regrets and no c
plaints. Let it suffice for you, Nuno, that, for the time, the r
sion for warlike adventure hath gone utterly out of my heart.

look with discomfort at all warlike panoply-I turn away from
lance and sword with feeling of discomfort, and my shield glares
at me with unpleasant brIghtness from the wall. Love hath sub-
dued me to simpler and sweeter desires. I dream now of long
floating hair and dewy eyes, and a sweet song and sweeter sigh
in the shade of lemon groves in the star-light."
"Shame on thee, Vasconselos, that thow-~shouldst make s~rch
confession! I will report thee for a haggard through the ar y.
I too have had my passions and my loves, as thou knowest, and
I could, on occasion, play me a merry turn of sadness upon the
guitar beneath my lady's lattice, even now; but that she should
wean me from my love of shield and spear, were impossible! I
must not believe thee.~~
"Thou shalt! thou wilt! I am the very thing that I tell thee
and care nothing for all the gold and treasure of the Floridia~n."
" It will greatly anger the adelantado when he hears of thy
decision."
"Nay, I think he is somewhat prepared for it. He hath
treated me with neglect from the beginning, in all substantial
things, and he now shows me a cold courtesy, which argues hos-
tility. This, of itself; were enough to move me to abandon his
banner. _ But thou also knowe~t how much are 'we Portuguese
the dislike of thy common soldiers. My brother, Andres, ~ho
leads a troop of our people, and a goodly one, hath a certain
measu~~e of independence. But I, who am only a single ho~se

A      I could only go as a simple volunteer, the aid to a superior who
hath shown me aversion. Seest thou not how little motive is
there left me for this adventure'? Even the pag~ who heil~ed
me buckle on my armor is withdrawn from me, since he waits also
on my brother, and is his paid follower; and this reminds
Nuno, that I am seeking to buy me a well-made lilackarnoor ;-

except the passion which she feels, she will fall into his 'arms, and
he will drink the moist, warm consent from her burning lips. So
it has been ever-so it will be ever-to the end of the history.
I have studied the sex in vain if it be not so !-and how to prevent
all this, for it must be prevented! The Adelantado must persuade
this knight to continue with the expedition. He must win him. He
hath the charm to do this, when he is persuaded to use it; and he

hundreds-but he must bear him~off; and meanwhile, it must be
for me to encourage him with a promise of Olivia on his return
from the expedition. To gain time is now the thing essential.
The rest may be left to the thousand casualties of such an adven-

to these gentlemen. Verily, I say ~ayse1f) they have been quite
too much slighted in this adventure, the more especially when
we remember the c~aimsof Don Philip, not merely as a brave
warrior, and polished gentleman, but on account of the special
qualities which he possesses from a former sojourn with the
Floridian of Apala9hia. And where is the shame and the dis-
credit to thee of seeking and soliciting this 5ble and his brother?
Dost thou not solicit many,-many who are far less worthy?
What is all thy to~l' here, the parade which we daily make, the
court which we hold, the feasts we give, the pageants and tour-
xieys we exhibit, but the fruit of a solicitude which seeks men,
and money and hoi~ses,-and all that is denied needful to the
success and glory of thy enterprise? Of a truth, my Lord, I
see, as I have long seen, that there is no true wisdomTh looking
coldly on these brave spirits, who, I doubt not, will be most happy
of thy favor, and most hearty in thy cause."
The Adelantado trode the floor with hasty strides while his
wife was speaking. Whe~i she had done, he spoke.
"I see not what ye would have. I gave these knights all the
countenance that was possible. They were entreated to our pres-
ence; they were dealt honorably with when they came. I could
not strip command from other of my followers, born Castilians,
who brought with them their own retainers. I could not for my
own dignity, abridge my o~yn command, that they should find
the followers whom they did~ not bring. I dared not give them
high places in the expedition, knowing well the jealousy of our
people towards the foreigners. But, I trow, all this complaint
of neglect had never been, Don Balthazar, had it not been for
thy niece. It is the passion of this knight for the Lady Olivia,
and, perchance, thy hostility to his object, which hath marred his
purpose, and not any lack of my favor. He ha&amp;..gone, as so

many do, an individual adventurer, a single lance and sword,
but for his passion for thy niece; and thou, I wot, hath put lliy
ban upon is affection."
"I have put no ban upon his affections, your excellence, nor
upon hers. He is free to come and go, and he ~ees my niece
when he w~ll. I have not forbidden him; I do ?iot purpose~ to
forbid. If he seeks her in marriage, and she affects him, I with-
hold no co sent."
"Thou ast changed in thy resolve since we last spoke of
these parti s !" said Donna Isabella.
"True, our Ladyship. I hearkened to your counsels, and re~.
solved in c mpliance with them. But it is, perchance, for this
very reaso that he hath declined the expedition. Had I barred
his passage to the Lady Olivia, he had been less hopeful. I am
free to say that I believe she hath large power over him."
"And h over her," quoth the Lady Isabella, "or the Woman's
eyes have ~n this greatly mistaken the usual signs of the woman's
heart."
"Well!' exclaimed Hernan de Soto, breaking in with ir~ipa..
tience, "w4~1, and what is to come of it? Will ~he sink into
the~ drudge~upon a vineyard? Will he become fruit-pruner on
the hacienda of the Lady Olivia de Alvaro, and prepare his
monthly accounts, as steward and agent, for the examination of
the severe efior Don Balthazar? Think'st thou to bring him
to this? an it be that one of the bravest and best lances in
Portugal- y~ and Spain-will be content with this petty employ
in life wif e great deeds are done in Florida-he who, but a
month ago, had an ambition for conquest, and a passion for enter-
prise, equa to that of the most eager adventurer in Cuba?
Then is kni hthood greatly altered in spirit in the last decade;
and one as he reads may well wQnder if the deeds of Hernan de
Cordova a e not in faith a pure fable,-a silly invention of the
poet. Go to, Don Balthazar, you shall not persuade me to
this."
"I woul persuade you to nothing, you excellence, which you

I


deem hurtful to your honor or your interests, oIf which you find
displeasing to your moods. You hear what is .reported as comn-
ing from Don Philip himself. I' believe the rumor, and think
that he hath so expressed himself. It is for you to say whether
the loss of this knight,-perchance his younger brother also,-be
such loss as you can suffer without grievance."
" Of a truth, not ! we want every man whom we can gkt, and
every brave knight in. especial,-particularly one who brings with
him such manifold resources as Philip de Vasconselos."
" This being the case, your excellency, it may be we,11 to ask,
in what way, without derogation from your high dignity, to per-
suade him to the adventure. I have shown you wherefore I
think he hath resolved to quit your banner ;-the neglect of
favor ;-the jealousy of our Spaniards, and the passion which he
hath for my niece."
" When thou sawest these 'things, and that the hope of thy
niece was that which made him hostile to the expedition, why
then didst thou give encouragement to this puling passion for the
damsel'?"
-"Nay, my lord, thou art again unreasonable," interposed
Donna Isabella. "If there be offence in that, the gdilt of it lies
at thy door and mine. Don Balthazar, as thou wilt recall, de-
clared himself in opposition to the suit of the knight of Portugal,
giving, as reason for it, the very peril which we now fear, that he
would abandon the expedition if successful with the lady. Was
it not so, Don Balthazar ?"
Don Balthazar bowed assent, and then proceeded in reply to
De Soto. -
"I gave no encouragement, your excellency, to .this passion.
In truth, for many reasons I was greatly hostile to it. The calm,
and, as seemed to me, as I trow it did to you, the insolent pride
of this knight's bearing was rarely inconsistent with his poverty
of position and resource, and I felt a pride of nation which re-
volted to think that the large possessions of my niece should fall
into the= clutch .of a beggarly and grasping stranger. I had

19;

chosen another suitor for her-one Don Augustin de Sinolar, a
worthy gentleman, and a handsome, whose estates lie adjoining
those of my niece at the hacienda Matelos."
" And didst thou really seek to match-thy niece with that thing
of silk and straw, De Sinolar ? Fie upon thee, Don Balthazar--
fie upon thee, for designing a most unworthy sacrifice."
.The face of Don Baithazar flushed to the temples, as he listened
to the rebuke of the Lady Isabella, and felt the sharp indignant
glance of her eye upon him. But he had his reply.
."He is rich, lady, and hath a good exterior. He hath the
vanities of youth, perchance ; I deny it not ; but he hath few of
the vices of youth. He hath meekness, and gentleness, and sim-
plicity, and '
" Oh ! hush thee, Don Balthazar; as if the qualities of a chicken
or a hare were sufficient to, satisfy the heart of a woman. Fie;
upon thee."
" Briefly," interposed De Soto, "she rejects your favorite
De Sinolar, cnd must have your knight of Portugal."
"ffy choice was not hers, and, though the Lady Isabella re-
bukes me, I must say I am sorry for it. Olivia had been much
happier, I trdw, with De Sinolar, than she ever could hope to be
with Philip de Vasconselos."
" And why not, I pray you ?" again .spoke the Lady Isabella,
showing a fe mine tenacity on a subject which so naturally inter-
ested the pride and temper of the sex.
"Nay, it d es not matter to our present quest," said De Soto,
" The question is, does she resolve to wed the Portuguese?"
"She- prefers him, beyond all question, but that she will wed
with him is still-as who can answer for-the caprices of the
sex ?"--and this was said with a sly glance at the Lady Isabella-.
"is still a very questionable matter."
" Nay, if she prefers him, and he seeks her, there is an end of
the doubt. . ou do not bar the progress, and none denies. She
will wed with him, I see, and he is lost to the expedition--a loss
greater than fty matchlocks !"

De Soto strode the apartment with a vexation which he did
not labor to conceal. Now, that the loss of the knight seemed
to be certain, he was at no pains to conceal his conviction of his
value. The truth is that, as Don Balthazar had indicated already,
the pride in the bearing of Don Philip de Vasconselos, and the
stately reserve which he maintained to the Castilian leaders, De
Soto among them, had touched the self-esteem of the latter.
Yet this conduct of the Portuguese was not properly a cause of
wonder 6r complaint, when it was remembered with what open
jealousy he was regarded by the Spaniards. Don Balthazar
watched his superior with keen eyes, but a calm, unspeaking
countenance. After a brief pause, h~ spoke as follows:
"Nay, your Excellency, it does not seem so necessary that the
Knight should be lost to the expedition, even should he wed with
my niece. He may be persuaded to follow it after he hath wed-
ded -"
"Better before !" said the Lady Isabella with a smile.
"Yes, I grant you, better before; and, whatever attempts we
make upon him should be 8eaSOflably tried; but, failing to pre..
vent his bridal-which, I repeat, is by no means an assured thing
-then we may negotiate that he follow thee when the honey-moon
is ov~r. Thou wilt suffer one or more small caravels to remain
from thy fleet, wherewith to bring stores after thee, and the sick
soldiers, and in one of th~se he may easily depart with others.
Thou wilt hardly feel his loss ere he is with thee. Thou wilt
consume several weeks in thy progress along, and thy descent
upon the coast-rn the unloading of thy caramels, the landing of
the horses, hogs and cattle, and in other needful preparations.
When thou art ready to penetrate the country' of the Apalachi-
an, he' will, if we use the proper means of persuasion, be with
thee in ~
"And these means of persuasion. Sant' Jago! Shall I go to
this Knight of Portugal, and bend myself before him, and say,
'Sir Knight, wilt thou honor thy servant by taking thy part in
this expedition'?"'

THE EMISSARY.

"Nay, nay, my lord -" began the lady, but the Adelantado
waved his hand impatiently, looking to Balthazar. The latter
did not delay his answer
"Will your Excellency leave this matter wholly to me? I
will use what proper arguments I may. I will in no respect com-
mit thy pride or honor. I will promise office, and the command
of a troop, yet in no way conflict with thy engagements.7'
"How wilt thou do this ?"
"Nay, w~ill it n t suffice that it shall be done ?"
"In God s nam , do it; I shall say no more. Thou wilt re-
lieve me of an e barras~inent; and if thou succeed'st with this
churlish cavalier, ill do ~melp to the enterprise, as none better
knows than thou! Away, Don Balthazar, and let the grass not
grow beneath thy cet. To-morrow thou knowes~t the tournament
begins, and there i much work for thee here as elsewhere. To
thy papers, my se retary-.---my soul, ratl~er !"
And witl~ this s perb compliment, the stately Don turned, to
his wife, a~d pr needed to dictate as she wrote. Don Bal~
thazar, havi~ig cart blanche, made his bow and took his departtrre.
lie lost no time i visiting Philip de Vas&amp;onselos. The office
was one which the uncle of Olivia would have cheerfully deputed
to another; but t s was impossible; and he proceeded accord-
ingly to the work before him, with the promptitude of one to
whom the duty is apparent. His hope lay. in the temptation
which he would ho d forth to the ambition of the adventurer.
having himself litt e faith in the affections as sufficiently compen-
sative to man, he persuaded himself that the aim of Philip de
Yasconselos was t e fortune of his ward. If he could hold forth
a sufficient lure of the same character through another medium,
he flattered himself that he should be successful. None c~oubted
that Florida and t e mountains of Apalachia concealed treasures
in gold and silver, ems and precious stones, equal to any in the
keeping of Peru. He knew that this faith was especially taught
by the Portuguese who h~d been one of the explorers of that
country with the cavalier Cabeza de Va~a. All that seemed
essential, therefore to beguiling him to the enterprise, was to

mollify his pride, and secure him the means of going thither in a
style which should maintain his dignity and afford him an ade-
quate command. For this money was necessary, and De Soto
had none to spare. The resolution which Don Ealthazar had
formed, was to use~ the means afforded him by the large income
from the estate of his niece, of which he had con~plete control.
To employ the wealth of Olivia in ridding her of two dangerous
- lovers, seemed to him a perfectly legitimate measure; though,
in respect to the propriety of the proceeding, he never allowed
himself to doubt for a moment. Thus prepared with his gen.
eral plan of action, he entered the humble dwelling of the Knight
of Portugal.
Philip de Yasconselos beheld the approach of the unusual vis-
itor without surprise. He had, in fact, anticipated the unwanted
courtesy, and we may add, had partly designed it should be so,
when he instructed his friends to declare aloud his determination.
lie knew quite as well as aiiy other person, how necessary he
was to the purposes of De Soto. The appearance of Don Bal-
tliazar seemed to assure him also of the conviction felt by the
latter that his niece would favor the suit of the Portuguese. The
instincts of Philip de Yasconselos on this subject had been
strengthened by the positive reports of Nuno de Tobar. They
were confirmed by the visit of the uncle. His hands were ac-
cordingly strengthened. He was prepared for the interview.
Though yet a young man, hardly more than thirty, he had been
a soldier; had travelled much; mingled much with men; en.
dured those vicissitudes which strengthen patience, teach coolness,
and give insight; and with a mind naturally acute, and a judg
ment well balanced and secure, he was more than a match foi
men of greater age and as much experience. He was a politician
over who~m the habitual cunning of Don Balthazar could obtain
no advantage. It was a curious study to watch the interview
between the parties-to behold the Castilian Don doubling like a
fox through all the avenues of his art; to see him circling around
his object, without approaching it; to note how warily he kept,
in regard to his secret fears, while holding forth his rno~t beguib

He returned with all diligence to the presence of the Adelan.
tado, whom he found in the most joyous mood. The change of
a couple of hours had effected wonders. When he left his pres.
ence De Soto was angry and sullen. Now his mirth was abso-
lutely boisterous. In this merriment, though more temperately,
Donna Isabella shared. Don Baithazar looked on with wonder,
and several times~ vainly essayed to speak. He was always
overborne by the laughter of his superior.
"Tell me nothing yet," cried De Soto, at an interval in his
bursts of mirth,'-." Nothing that shall qualify my pleasure. Ha!
ha! ha! wait, good Don Balthazar, till I can recover breath, when
you shall hear, and then, if it be not wholly against your princi.
ple, you shall laugh too."
"Ay, ay, your excellence, as Sancho counsels, 'Let not thy
secret rot in thy keeping!"'
"Ere long it will be no secret. The story is too good to be
kept from air. It must be sent abroad, and no doubt will gain
addition as it goes. Thus, then, there were some bar ques that
put into pQrt, as thou knowest, from stress of weather yesterday.
One of them had spru~ig aleak, and needed repair. On board of
this vessel came Hernan Ponce, an old comrade of mine in Peru.
We were dear friends in Peru, and we made a brotherhood be-
tween us, which is, as thou knowest,, a copartnership for common
interests and profits, to last through life. We were thus to share
our gains and losses equally, our honors as our profits."
"Ah! and he now comes to claim of thee the half of thy state
here, and thy command in the expedition ?"
"Nothing half so good, Don Balthazar. He claims nothing at
my hands, but his aim is to escape from claims of mine. Thou
must know, then, that Reman Ponce hath made great profits in
Peru, and with immense wealth of gold and silver, jewels and
precious stones, \he hath embarked at Noinbre de Dios for Spain.

"Wilt thou show them ?"
"Eh ! why not? He shall see-the sordid runagate, that I
know him! I will shame him with my discovery."'
"Which is clearly forfeit."
"Nay, the dog. I will not keep his treasure from him. I will
spit upon it, and force his shame upon him."
*" It is a gift of fortune. Thou wilt need it all, Don Her..
nan."
"Nay, teach not that," interposed Donna Isabella; "rather
let it go, lest we be haunted by the prayers of hate and avarice.
My lord will, I trust, need none of the treasure whieli is yielded
grudgingly. I Would not have his honor reproached by scan-
dal."
"But it is his right, Se ora."
"Yes! but one may w 11 forego a right when there would be
feeling of shame, and' not pride, ixi its assertion. Better let my
lord do as he nobly reso es,-spit upon the treasure, and so
upon the baseness of the o er."
It was probably the ad ~ce of the lady that led De Soto to his
determination. He was r ther inclined to grasp at treasure from
whatever source, and his reputation is not above the reproach of
an unbecoming avarice. While they were yet speaking, the
attendants announced th approach of Hernair Ponce, upon
which Don Balthaz r said~'-
"My need requi es me elsewhere. I will not stay to see thy
treatment of this p rtner of thine, particularly, as it seems to me,

THE household of Don Baithazar de Alvaro maintained its ac-
customed serenity to the world without. Its rder had under-
gone no apparent disturbance since the death f old Anita, and
Sylvia, her mesti 0 successor, seemed ~o fall s naturally into
her habits, as if sh had .been trained directly u der them. No
doubt the stern di cipline of her master had t tored her to un-
plicit obedience, w 1e his precaution haci left nothing doubtful
in the directions w ch he gave her for her go eminent during
his absence~. But we may mention here, that e girl Juana, if
not refractory, was inattentive, and the old hag ho now super-
intended the house old had occasion to notice er frequent and
prolonged absences~ for Which the girl, on her me urn, was unwill-
ing, or unable to account. Once or twice during the progress of
the last twenty-four~ hours, ha~ Sylvia fe1~t it in umbent on her
to administer an exj~ressive cuff or two t~ the ch eks of the sul-
len servant, winding~ up these salutary admonitio s with threats
of' more potent handling, and a final appeal to on Balthazar.
But blows and threa s did not much niend. the atter. They

her cruel wrongs. he concluded always, howev r, with a sig-

repeated assurance o redress, both for herself an mistress.
Olivia did not mu h heed these assurances, and listened, sim~
pity, in that mood of listlessness, which had follow d her despair-
ing determination no to wed with Philip de Vas onselos. She

abandoned herself ~o this feeling, an~ its external exhibition was
apathy. Still, she somewhatt wondered that she did not see her
lover-that he did ~iot make his appearance, as her uncle feared,
as her friend' Leono~a de Tobar had asserted he would appear,
and as she felt itcr~minal to hope. A morning visit from Leo..
nora, the thoughtless, the joyous, upon whom neither shame nor
sorrow seemed to ~it long, gave her all the little tattle of the
town; and she ran on, with tongue at random, discoursing of a
thousand matters in whieh Olivia took no interest. It was only
when Philip de Va~conselos became the subject, that the visitor
found an expressio4 of eagerness and concern in the eyes of her
suffering hostess.
"It is certain th~t he loves you to distraction, Olivia. Nuno
says so, and he ought to know; and I suppose he could tell me
a greali many things to p~'ove it; but he won't. He says Philip
is his friend, and ~ie can't betray his friend's secrets. As if a
husband should .h4ve any secrets from hi~ wife; and as if I
couldn't keep a se~ret. Now you know, Olivia, nobody better
keeps a secret then I. I never tell. any thing-never! My
mouth is sealed upbn a secret, as solemnly and sacredly, Livy,
as if it were a-a ~rh~it ?-why a kiss, to be sure. He might4rust
me; I'm sure, with every thing he knows-with every thing he's
seen and done, and not a syllable should ever pass my lips.
And yet, would you believe it, when I ask him about your Philip
and his secrets, only to tell you every thing, why he tells me
that Philip says he will tell ix~e;. and that I will tell you, and then
every body will ki~iow every thing. The fact is, Livy, one thing
is very certain to me, that if your Philip speaks in that way-
though I don't believe a word of it-he's a very saucy person,
and Nuno should r~ot listen to him. But Nuno believes him the
best fell6'w~ in the I world, and says he loves him next to me.
Not close, you know, but far off-that ~s, he has no friendship
for anybody betwixt him and me. Now I'll l~t you into a great

~' ~ever! never!" exclaimed the poor girl solemnly, her head
drooping upon her hands, through the fingers of which the big
tears were seen to trickle.
"Oh! but we will, I tell you. None of your never for me.
It must be so.! Why, Livy, what do you cry for? Because
you will have the very person that you love."
"No! no! I shall never marry, Leonora."
"Oh! I know better than that! Why, what in the world
were you born for, Livy?' What but to marry a noble gentle.
man, and-and-oh, you know what I mean; so don't look so
like a simpleton." I
"I have resolved not to marry, Leonora. 'I hope"-here her
voice trembled-~" I ~aope that Don Philip will never compel me
to refuse his offer."
"Of course, he ~~n't compel you to refuse. No, indeed; if 1

There was another breathing spell necessary for farther pro.
gress. This found, the gay, thoughtless creature resumed.
"But I haven't told you half of my secrets. Nuno says that
Philip and his brother Andres have quarrelled, and it is all on
your account. He told Philip that you had refused him
"He should not have done, that."
"No! and by. t1~e way, Livy, that's what I have to quarrel
with you about. You never told me, your own sister in love, a

have raised them ju~t without the city, in a natural amphitheatre
among the hills. There is a great enclosure for the bull-fights.
We are to have the most splendid bull-fights, as' brave as any
thing they have in Spain. They brought in a dozen great beasts
yesterday from the mountains-the finest animals in the world;
all 'as wild as tigers. Several famous matadors have come with
them, and' w~e are to have' such sport. They ha4e raised high
scaffolds for the noble p'3ople and the ladies, and in the centre is
one- with a canopy for the Adelantado and the Lady Isabella, and
their immediate friends; we are to sit with them, Livy, but on

"And I too can letter weep than rejoice over them, Leonora."
" What can be the matter with the child ~ Livy, there is some-
thing wrong-itis unnatural that you should show such fates at such
a time-you, so young, so beautiful, with such a fortune, and with
such a lover-with every reason, too, for believing that nothing
can now stand in the way of your loves. Livy, I do think that
there is something wnong~-soixiething which I cannot guess."
For a moment the gay young woman forgot all her levity, an4
turning from the rich dresses and the jewels, fixed her eyes on the
gloomy features of. Olivia, with such intense and penetrating cut
riosity, That her cheeks flushed and her eyes. fell; and she stain-

speak so ;-and I must know it, Livy. As your friend, you must
tell me all. You know how well I ~an keep a secret. Come,
dear, tell me what it is that troubles you."
This, recalled Olivia to herself. The very appeal to her expe-
rience in behalf of her friend's capacity to keep a secret, warned
her of the danger threatening her. She did not philosophize ex-
cept through her instincts; these sufficiently taught her that a
secret, once supposed to exist, is already half discovered; and by
a strong mental effort, she threw off her cloud for a spaces and
allowed herself to answer prattle with prattle. She diverted her
friend's curk~sity from herself to her garments, and in the exami-
nation of silks, ribbons and jewels, Leonora forgot that there were
any other mysteries in the world. Tl~us the rest of the time was
consumed while she remained.
q
When her gay visitor was gone, Olivia sank into a seeming
stupor; yet her thought was busy all the while; the mournful,
dreary, ghostly speculation, which aimed at nothing, settled upon
nothing, hoped for nothing, and feared everything. The day passed
thus. Shewas unconscious mQstly when Juana madeher appearance

"Hence !" he e~daimed, with a voice of thunder and a brutal
oath. " Hence! To-morrow you go to the cour~try."
Juana disappeared-b~t not too far. She wai1~d at the door
t~nd listened, her nose dropping blood all the whiP. She did not
observe it. She scarcely felt the pain. The blood of the red
inah in her veins supplied her with one feeling only, and that
was foi~ the indignity. She listened. She reserved herself for
her ow~ time; but resolved that she would not go. to the coun-
try. We shall see.
Meanwhile, a long conference folloWed between Thin Balthazar
and Sylvia, in regard to Olivia.
"She eats nothing that I provide her. I know not how she
lives."
"She has supplied herself secretly from other sources. That
girl-." I have watched her. She has carried her noth-
lug."
Juana, as she listened, reproached herself that such was the
case. She had never thought of the wants of her young mistress.
She now resolved to supply them from her own stores. She
now became more resolved than ever to befriend the damsel,
who suddenly rose before her eyes as an object of sympathizing
Interest. But she did not leave the door. She h~d still other
things to hear.
"Here is more of the potion 1" said Don Balthazar, giving the
I phial. "To-morrow I will see that she goes forth. In her ab-
sence search her apartments. If you find food; you know what
to do with it."
This is all that n~ed concern us of this conference. When
Don l3althazar was ~ibout to leave the apartment, his eye caught
sight (A' the blood upon the floor which had fallen from the nos-
trils of Juana.
"What is this ?" ~he said, stooping.

and loathing. She never rose, but looking on him with pitiless
composure, she exclaimed,-
"This, then, is the noble process for accomplishing my de..
struction !-worthy of a noble knight-thrice worthy a Castilian
gentleman-and altogether becoming a guardian and a kinsman 1"
The uncle rose, recovering himself; with the erect position.
"Thy destruction, girl! What dost thou mean? Dost thou
think I come to murder thee ?"
"And what else should I think, when thou comes in such
fashion, at such an hour, and through an avenue which is secret
to thyself? Why shouldst :thou not murder me? and why, if
such, be not thy object, shouldst thou thus visit my place of sleep-
ing? But thou well knowest I meant not that! Thou know'st
that -thanks to thy ether means of destruction! I have now no
fear of any hurt thou canst do to this poor life. Wert thou capa.

but mine own shame."
"Olivin, thou art       passionate and wild !"

"Well," said he, "hast thou found the wench, Juana ?"
"She is gone. She is not within the house !"

jects of his conversation, as by no possibility to prompt the
mind of the youth to turn in the direction in ~hj~h his heart had
suffered hurt. But Andres exhibited no sense of this prudence.
and forbearance. lie was one of those wilful and wrong-headed,
but otherwise noble and generous spirits, who prefer, under dis-
appointment, to suffer and complain; who, of themselves, irritate
the sore places which they feel, and steadily tear away the plas-
ter with which the physician would cure all their ailments. It
was in despair of saying or doing anything which could be ac-
ceptable to his brother's mood, that Philip de Vasconselos finally
forbore the effort. For the last two days, therefore, an ominous
silence had prevailed in their cottage whe they met. Nothing
was spoken which either might well avoid; and Philip felt with
sorrow, that the chasm between them was l~ourly growing greater
in depth and width. But he felt with st~il greater sorrow that
nothing could then be done to arrest its in~rease. It was to time
only, that great corrector, that the matter could be left.
But time was not allowed them. The tournament approached,
with all its excitements, appealing equally to their pride, their
renown, and the somewhat peculiar position in which they stood
in regard to the Castiian chivalry. Both of them, accordingly,
might be seen, a few days before the event, busily engaged bur-
nishii g and preparing their armor. It had already been remark-
ed, as discreditable to the Spanish knight~, that their Portuguese
auxiliaries were better armed, in a simpler and nobler style, and
kept their mail and weapons under better polish than the former.
Pe Soto himself had been compelled to refer to these knights in
compliment on this account, and to urge their example, in order
to prompt his Spanish cavaliers to get themselves serviceable
armor, and to k~ep it in order. They were better pleased to
show themselves in* gewgaws and gilt thaft in the substantial
coverings which were essential to warfare. One of the histori-
ans of this expedition thus contrasts the appearance of the knights
of the two nations: "And he (the Adelantado) commanded a

Our brothers pursued their task in silence. Occupying the
same dwelling, and with but little space in their somewhat ar-
row limits for any performance unseen by either, this sil nec
was an irksome one. The elder brother had made repe ted
efforts to break through the icy reserve which prevailed in thc
demeanor of the younger from that fatal night, the event of
which have already been described. On that night, after heli
passionate interview, Andres de Vasconselos had returned ron
his lonely and gloomy wanderings, in no way irnproveJ for on~
panionship. his affections were more stubbornly cong ale
than ever; his passions, if less explosive, not a whit more sul
dued or playable. A sullen rigidness was conspicuous in 1 h
features; a gloomy inflexibility in his mood; a hostile r er~
in his actions and deportment. This continued, increased ou
ly by the reports of the city, touching the supposed su en
good fortune of his brother in respect to the affections f t~

never sufThred the proper moment of Consolation to be lost.
Such was the spirit with which Philip de Vasconselos regarded
his wayward brother.
It was two days yet to the opening scenes of the tourney, the
beginning of which we have already seen. The day was at its
close; a day all flushed with beauty, and sweet with the warm
breathing of the budding summer. The sun was at his setting.
His not ungrateful rays fell pleasantly gay upon the greezm slope
which led to the slight bohio, or cottage, made of poles and reeds,
thatched with straw, which the brothers occupied. Soft ificker-
ing folds and remnants of purple, that seemed momently rolling
themselves up, and disappearing with the breeze, only tcLre-ap..
pear and spread themselves out in increasing brightness, on higher
slopes of hill, won, at the same moment, the silent fancies of the
brothers. The hills were fringed with faint red tints that glori-
fied them as with heavenly halos; the woods, flushed with. the
mingled drapery of spring and summer, lay gently waving in the
breeze of evening, rocked in the arms of beauty, and canopied
with the smiles of heaven. It was one of those delicious mo-
ments when the world without passes with all its sweetness
into the heart, and takes the whole soul into its embrace of love.
The brothers, as by a common instinct, threw aside their toils,
and cast themselves down upon the hill-slope, their eyes ranging
over the blessed prospect. Their shields, of bright blue steel,
spotless, and shining like mirrors in the sun, reflected back the
mellow softness of his beams. They hung upon the upright poles
without the cottage, on each side of the entrance, to which they
furnished a rich and befitting decoration. Their long lances, of
well-sounded and seasoned ash, headed with broad shafts of bright
steel, that shone like silver in the sun, were leaned against the
wall of the dwelling, and also without the entrance. The page
of Andres, a gay boy of fourteen, had just made his obeisance,
and taken hisdeparture, under instructions from his master; and
for a moment, the two brothers,, reposing from their toils of the
day, seemed disposed to snatch a respite, in the sweet calm which
had 'descended upon all nature in the grateful approach of eve-

ning. Andres lay at length beneath the slender shadows (
palm, which, at an earlier hour, could have yielded no shelter
none was needed now. His eyes were 'shrouded by his a
which was carelessly thrown across, his brows. While in
attitude, Philip rose suddenly from where he lay, and 'moved
a brotherly impulse, approached him 'and threw himself qui
by his side.
"Andres, my brother," was the affectionate salutation of
el&amp;er, "it is naturally expected that we shall both do our de
in the approaching tourney. It is due to~our reputation, as ~
knights, and particularly to our position among these gentle
of Castle, who would not be slow to remark upon any ux
lingness which we might betray in entering the lists. They
do their best, and we must do ours. That we can maintain
own, and the honor ofour country, in a passage-at-arms, whE
with lance, sword, or battle-axe, with any of these cavalic
nothing question; though there be knights among them, n
who, like Nuno de Tobar, will honor, by their prowess, those
may strive against them. These will afford us sufficient exe
and honor. It needs not, my brother, that we should cross
pon with each other."
A grim smile passed ov~r the features of Andres, as he
drew his arm from above his eyes. The expression was ai
pleasant one to Philip. A brief pause ensued. At lengt~
younger replied:
"Verily, Philip de Va§conselos, it were not wise to
these knights of Castile to suppose thee unwilling to cross
pons with any warrior, even though he were of thy own 1
and nation. Such reluctance, in the minds of persons swo:
cavil, might be construed into doubt of thy own capacity;
prowess."
'"I fear not, Andres," replied the other, calmly, "that an;

that any feeling but that of a natural attachment between kins..
men hath kept us from a trial of skill and prowess, which, though
it be but the mimicry of strife, is yet too nearly like it, and is
but too frequently apt to occasion the reality, not to plead against
our indulgence, adversely, in the exercise. It is not, however,
what the world without may think, my brother, but 'what we feel
within, which should control our wishes in this matter. It is
enough for me that, even in sport, I love 'not' to confront with
weapon the bosom of a brother who is so very dear to mine."
"Brother, mine, I do not quite understand these refinements.
We have crossed weapons in the tourney a thousand times ere
this, in our early exercises,-nay, in the very training which thou
hast given me, and which, as a grateful pupil,"-~this was spoken
with a smile by no means pleasing in the eyes of Philip,-.."I am
* only too glad to have received at thy hands. What is there now
to make the difference ?"
"Ask thy own heart, Andres," replied the other, sadly. "Art
thou the same person that thou wast, when, without a care or
* thought but of the art which thou hadst in thy desfte, thou took'st
thy first lessons from my lance? Since that day thou hast
mingled, for thyself, in the press of knights; thou hast shared
the eager fury of the battle; thou hast won for thyself a name
which thou must maintain, at all perils, to thyself and others.
But thou hast other feelings, fears and hopes than' those which
possessed thee when a boy; thou hast grown a man of cares;
and, I grieve to think it, my brotherthou no longer look'st upon
me, thy Philip, as the loving friend from whom came thy first
lessons in arts and arms. These make 'it prudent and proper
that we should not strive against each other. The accidents of
the tourney are, of themselves, sufficient to keep our arms asun.-

"I am no longer inexperienced, Philip de Vasconselos. I

ing shadow of thy greater fame! I reproach thee not, that
has been thy fortune; but verily, it is no longer seasonable
thee, to discourse to me of the love of kinsmen; and I tell
more, Philip de VasconselOs, thou hast but too much the hab

"And is it thus, my brother ?"' was the mournful answ~
Philip de V~sconselos.
"But I will not upbraid thee; and yet I will not forbear 1

lance, sword, and battle-axe, three strokes of each; with. Luis de
Moscoso, with Balthazar de Gallegos, with Nuno de Tobar; and
it may be with others, whom I flow recall not."
"Thou canst not well escape thy devoir," said Andres, with a
sneering smile.
"Nor, sav~e on tI~y account," replied the other "would .1
desire to do so. But there is that within my bosom, Andres,
whatever may inhabit hi tliine, which makes me shrink from
the thought that we shall cross lances in the me4~e. I know
not that thou designest such a conflict; but I know thy ambition-.~
thy pride-and I fear that evil spirit which sometimes possesses
thee, making thee blind to thybetter feelings, and to the claims of
those about thee, and which, I grieve to say it, has but too fre-
quently shown itself in thy moods of late. Brother, hearken to
me ;4 pray thee let us not meet! Thou wilt find many noble
knights to conquer, who will do thee honor. There will be no
lack of the fit antagonist, even though Hernan de Soto himself
shall take the field. Let us do nothing which may perchance
lessen or change that love which our mother gave us, and which
should be dear to u~, because of her, as because of ourselves."
"It is on my account-for me-that thou wouldst avoid the
encounter with me !" replied the younger brother. "Verily,
Philip, thou ha t betrayed thy modesty. Is it so sure that my

"Nay, broth r, why thus wilt thou mistake my purpose ?-.

The jealous~ spirit of the ~younger brother construed this sen-
tence, which l~e interrupted, to refer to the disappointment of his
suit with Olivia de Alvaro.
"Indeed, thou approv'st the truth of thy disclaimer by thy

"Andres, let not the sun set on this disagreement. I feel that

Philip exteiided his hand affectionately to his brother, as he
made this app~al. The other did not receive it; but, waving his
own in the direction of the orb now rapidly disappearing behind
the last distant~ billows of the sea, he said coldly-
"He sinks !fl and, without another word, rose up and strode
down the slopes which conducted to the city. The elder brother
threw himself upon the eaith, from whence, during the earnest
portions of the dialogue, he had risen at the same moment with
the other, and rested his aching forehead upon his hands.

HAVANA, at the period of the events which we record, was a
growing hamlet of little more than a hundred dwellings.  3ut
a brief space before the arrival of Don Hernan de Soto in the
island, there had been an invasion oIU the French, by whom~ the
little city had been laid in ashes. It had been one of his duties,
on his~ arrival, which had not been neglected in consequence of
his preparations for Florida, to rebuild the town, which he had
been doing with all his energy, and with a free exercise of his
powers as Adelantado. To him the Habanese owe the erection
of the first fort which the place ever possessed. It will be for
the Cuban antiquarians of the present time to fix its location. As a
matter of cGurse, we are not to look to the works of De Soto, in
rebuilding the city, for the evidences of his architectural tastes,
or for any enduring proofs of the labor of his hands. The place

city that we find it now. She then possessed none of those old
gray towers and massive structures, which now assail the vision,
and command the admiration of the spectator. Her heights and
harbors were not then, as now, covered with the mighty and
frowning fortresses that stretch themselves around her, with a
hundred thousand guardian hands grasping bolts of iron terror
for her protection. But, if less threatening and powerful, she was
not less lovely and attractive. Her beautiful bay, then as now,

been trained to endurance, strife, and all sorts of' adventure, by
the unceasing struggles of three hundred years. The benign cli-
mate had not yet done the work of emasculation-perhaps never
would have done this work, if the surrounding savages had been
left partially unconquered. Had the Spaniards, with the profound
policy which is said to have marked the history of Aztec supre-
macy, suffered rival and hostile races still to exist, upon whom pe-
riodically their young warriors could exercise their weapons, the
vigorous energies of their peopl&amp; might have been trained to re-
sist all the . blandishments of climate. As yet, they remained
unimpaired by its insidious sweetness. The savage still harbored
in the mountains; the Caribbee still fed upon his captive along the
margin of the gulf; the Apalachian, a fearless warrior, still roved.
unconquered in his mighty shades; and the Spaniard, still needy
with all his treasures, looked out, on every hand, for empires
which he must yet possess. He was sensible of the delicious lux-
ury of his Cuban climate, but. did not yield to it his strength. That
fierce, vigorous life which distinguished the Castilian character, at
the period of the conquests of Spain in the new world,-to which
was due such a wonderful constellation of great captains-Cortez,
the Pizarros, Ojeda, Balboa, and a host besides-declared the
energies of a people in their prime, with a startling mission of per..
formance before them, demanding the equal exercise of the best
genius and courage. The compound passion of avarice and ambi-
tion left them in no humor for repose. Without pause, yet not
blindly, they pursued their mission; and the impatient and fevered
restlessness which it demanded and excited, rendered them supe-
rior to every persuasion that threatened conflict with their
strength. These could only prevail finally with the race which,
with ample luxuries in possession, find no longer in their thirst
the provocation to performance. For the present, no Spaniard
can enjoythe sweets of Cuban airs with comparative safety. They
have still a great work to do, are still goaded by fiery passions
which will not suffer them? to sleep, and they seize their luxuries

tiful in turn, all-linked together by assimilative beauties, and all
blessing, singly and together,-all nevertheless fail.-perhaps,
fortunately tken,-to supersede, in the minds of our Spaniards,
the habitual desires of their hearts. Still, the heroic p~tgeant is
in the ascendant; the human passion. The crowded spectacle,
the strife of violent forces, the eager scene of human struggle and
conquest, make them heedless of all that is simply sweet and
lovely in their possession. Even women share the tastes with
the passions of the sterner sex, and turn from their groves and
gardens to the gory terrors of the bull-fight.
But why chide ~ These people are simply the pioneers for
other races, who shall more securely enjoy what they neglect

pageants, which seem, over all, to require the highest finish in
art and the utmost polish in society-which seem, in fact, to
belong only to an old civilization, such as that of Christian
Europe,-it was ordinarily found that the ambition for display
was more than commonly ostentatious and expensive. Certain
it is,. that nothing of the sort in Spain, for a long time before, sur-
passed the promise, whether as regards the taste or the splendor,
of the great preparations which had been made by De Soto for
his three days of tourney and feats of arms, in the infant city of
havana. The lists, as our fair gossip, Donna Leonora de
Tobar,. has already told us, were erected in the beautiful amphi-
theatre just without the suburbs of the town. Here scaffolding
had been raised for the spectators, running half way round the
barriers, inclosing a portion of the area. These were to be
draped with showy stuffs. On some slight elevations, along the
opposite space, a ruder sort of scaffolding were reared for the
common people. These, in those days, did not assume that what
was given them in charity should be of a quality to compare
with the best. There was yet a third distinction made in behalf'
of the persons in power, and their friends-the persons of noble
birth and high position. Their place was something higher than
the others, built of better materials, and in more careful manner.
In the centre was a gorgeous canopy, which might have served for
a prince of The blood. It covered a raised seat, richly cushioned.
This was designed for the Adelantado and his noble lady. His
immediate friends and chiefs, and the ladies of his court, were
honored with private places on either hand. Before this seat
were painted the arms of Spain, on a rich shield or escutcheon;
its great golden towers, significant equally of its pride and
strength, fronting the lists and the oi polloi, and forming a beau-
tiful exhortation to the indulgence of the amor patrice. Di-
rectly over the canopy, and streaming proudly from a staff that
rose from behind it, flaunted, in~ mighty f~Ads of silk heavily
wrought with gold tissue, the armorial ~nner of ~astile. A
long series of escutcheons of a smaller size, but similar in shape
to that in the centre, and not inferior in workmanship, formed a

h~d learned to fashion in a style superior to anything beheld
Europe.' Bright armor of various kinds, employed for or
ment, glittered and gleamed at proper intervals, along the spl

signed for the sports, choice instruments poured forth peals
the most gay and inspiring music. The plan of the festivities
quired that the cool hours of the day only should b~ emplo
for the 'more active exercises of the combatants. The heat of
noonday sun in that ardent clime was, even at this early pe
of the year-the close of April-too intense to render agreed
any violent displays of agility, under heavy armor, for n~
amusement . The first day was assigned to the yo~g kni

was to be not unworthy of the future conquests, in the country
of the Apalachian. Very curious was the motley crowd that
showed itself on all the streets and avenues leading to the great
area of attraction. There were muleteers from the mountain;
wandering tribes akin to the gipsies; retired soldiers; and half-
savage groups, in which it was difficult to discern which race pre..
dominated mqst, the white man, the red man, or the negro. They
constituted a curious amalgam; each exhibiting some trait or
characteristic, picturesque, wild, individual, such as Murillo
would delight to paint-.such as would have risen into dignity
under the brush of Rembrandt. Girls came bounding along
with the castanets, by the side of mules on which sat tottering
grandmothers; boys loitered with the crossbow, eager to pick
up a real by shooting it down at twenty paces. Contrabandists
showed open faces, as, on pack mules, they brought the Aguar-
dieite for sale, in stone jugs, one on each side; its mouth open-
ing from the bosom of a panier. The stately owner of a rich
hacienda, where he marked his hundred calves each spring, rode
on a brave barb by the side of his family, occupying a vehicle
still in use, cumbrous but delightful of motion beyond all others,
-the volant6. We must not stop to describe it. As at the
present day in Old Spain, in the rural districts, nothing was more
curious than the various costumes and characters exhibited by the
appearance of the people from the country. Every department
in the old country had its fitting representative, tenacious, in the
new world, of all that distinguished his province in the old. The
gay and vivacious Andalusian, ribanded at wrist and shoulder,
breast and shoe ;-.--the confident and swaggering Biscayan; the
dull native of Valencia; the haughty Catalan ;-you might
mark them all at a glance. Groups wandered on together, the
highways to the city being for hours never without its strollers.
Old songs were to be heardas they wentfrom natural musicians;
sad touches, oddly mingled with lively redondillas, and some-
times, from some rude crowded, half soldier and half priest, or
poet, you might hear extempore ballacle~ ~Ievoted to the deeds of
arms of Cortez and Pizarro. Mules in strings came down with

for the doleful ditties, which no one stopped to hea. The:

But, to enumerate is impossible. Fancy the mo t pictu

Already, at early dawn, the trumpets began to pour fori
most lively fanfares. Already, a thousand cries of ho
expectation arose from the gathering and rapidly inc
groups. Some of the young champions were f3irc~ady

many who aimed at sports of their own, and who found favorite
spots upon the sides of the surrounding hills. Rules had been
published, prescribing the various fbrhis of combat which were
to be allowed within the lists, and the manner in which they were
to be conducted. These were all to be pacific in character, how-
ever deadly might be the weapons which the parties thought
proper to employ. In the hands of tIW good knight, or squire, it
was understood that the sharp spear, the sword, and the battle-
axe, might be used with the noblest shows of skill and power, yet
without hurt to life or limb. There were tilts appointed with the
lance, and duels with the sword; contests of strength were to be
tried with the mace and battle-axe, ~nd of dexterity with ~the
dagger and the knife. But, in each case, the contest was inva.
riablyto be decided, when one of the combatants should be put at
such disadvantage as would place him at the mercy of his op-
ponent, or render necessary for his relief a battle ~z l..'outrcznce.
To compel respect to this regulation was not always easy when
th~ pride of the champion was mortified, and his passions roused;
but De Soto had reserved to himself a~ of right, to be the judge
of the field, and his warder was Don Balthazar de Alvaro, a
person no longer young, of grave aspect, of high authority, and
quite learned, as well as experienced in the business of the to~ir~
nament. It was reasonable to suppose, therefore, that a due re-
gard to the regulations which had been published would be c~b-
served among the combatants. Of these hereafter; we must pause
for the present.

TIlE CROWP.                     189
Havana swarmed with life. At an early hour of the mor~iing,
as we have said.-nay, long, before the dawn-.the hum and buzz
of preparation were to be heard in every quarter. The country
had poured itself into the city; the city had suddenly take~ the
voice and wing of liberty, such as the country usually enj ~ys.
You might see, all night, the gleam upon the hill-sides of tor4~hes
guiding the foQtsteps of long cavalcades Over all the routes f~om
the interior. Knights, nobles, artisans, peasants and mdun-
taineers, barriers and contrabandistas banished rogues, outlaKvs,
returning in. disguise, and reckless of danger, in the passion wl~ich
the tournament inspired; we have seen already how motley ~ind
various were the groups. Crowds, fr6n~far and near, came on
foot. A single mule sometimes confriVed to bring a family;
the cart, the sedan, the volante, were all in requisition; and very
picturesque and beautiful was it to see the long trains, seemii~g,
for all the world, one great continuous procession, winding alopg
the circuitous paths~; climbing suddenly 1~o the hill-top, streaming
though the plain, and vaguely reap~earing~recognize~ 1y
their torches only-in the deep dim ave~lues of the silent fore~Lt.
After a group on foot, gay and rambling, would you see tl$e
stately and swelling hidalgo, on. his great horse, showily capa]~i-

DE SOTO'S &amp;4TTQ.                  191
The banner of' Castile and Leon is alPeady rollin~ out, wit~i its
great, gorgeous and gold folds above it. Not so loftily raised,
but yet so placed in the foreground a~ to attract all eyes, is~ the
personal banner of De Soto: a sheet df azure, on which is parted
a spirited picture of a cavalier, mounted on a fiery charger, toth
armed to the teeth, and about to leap precipice. The picture il-
lustrated one of the Adelantado's great eats in Peru. The m~tto
is Italian, in gold letters~"pj~~~j pu ; eke a trionfar ti ~uic~o.'~
When De Soto was asked by Don Balt~iazar why he put so pr~m-
ising a motto in a foreign language, whi~h was known to so fe~ of
his people, he answered." That it may 1~e more impressiv&amp;pr the
Adelentado Was something of a philosopher. Hardly Was the
banner seen to wave than some one wa~ ready to translate for
the curious multitude the mysterious pi'omise. When told that
the gallant cavalier only swore in Itali 4n that he would conduct
them to conquest, there was not a syllal~le of the inscription that
was not gotten instantly by heart, and ~ht
~a night it was sung as
the burden of a refrain, by a native rhy~nester, who was conte~it
to encourage the enterprise upon which-Lhe did not go himself!
Next to the pavilion of De Soto, on tue right, was that of t~e
Captain General, Don Porcallo de Figu~roa, his banner shining
above it, gleaming with a sun of gold. Don Baithazar de Alvaro
had his place on' the left of the Adelanta~fjo, whom he was to as-
51st as warder or master of the tourney. We need not range the
places of the rest, nor enumerate the good, the old, and the ip-
iluential families, to whom conspicuous seats were assigned for
the survey of the spectacle. Going without the barriers, we ap-
proach the tents or pavilions of the knights who Were expected
to engage in the several passages..at..ar~5 Here they were to
dress and equip themselves; hither they were to retreat and rest
when wearied, and take refreshment Each was sacred to its
owner, and great care was taken by the pc~lice of the field that
they were never trespassed upon by the crowd. In the rear
of each pa~flion Was a tent or shelter of more common material,
where the horse or horses of the cavalier were kept and groomed.

Sc~me of the knights, as the wealthy Seijor Don Porc~
Figueroa, for example, had a score of horses; but the
number, like our poor knights of Portugal, 'had a singh

endurance, and admirably trained. We pass, in review, ~
eral pavilions without the barriers, of the knights first men~
of Nuno de Tobar, of~ Balthazar de Gallegos, of Juan d~
lante, of Christopher de Spinola, and many others, each
bears the especial shield and insignia of its proprietor. M~
ple than all the rest, made of crimson cotton, were the t
the Portuguese brothers. It was remarked by curious ob
that these tents were no longer pitched side by side; the
now opposite each other, one on the right, the other on
of the centre. The banner which floated above the. pay
Philip, bore the image of a ruined castle, from which
had spread its wings and was away. That of Andres e

shields of the several cavaliers hung each at the entrauc
tent, and in a situation favorable for that atteint, or strol
adversary's spearblunt'or sharp, which was the customary
conveying the challenge. At the opening of the passage
were transferred to conspicuous places within the area.
none of the knights, challengers, or defenders, were to
by the multitude. Squires, leading horses, or pages
about' the tents, alone were visible. It remains to men
that the torril, or pen for the bulls, was constructed bei
tiers of seats assigned to the common. people. Fro
closed passage, the door opening right upon the area,
directly to the ring. In the rear of the torril, pavil~
raised for the toreadores, picado2'es, chubs and matad
cl~ss separately; and these pavilions engaged no

Drums roll, trumpets sound ;-a wild burst of Saracenic in sic
rises from the amphitheatre; and the crowds rush forward to eek
their places. The Adelantado, at the head of a gorgeous ca al-
cade of knights, rides into the ring- Already have the n ble
ladies, with their several escorts, taken their seats upon the le-
vated gallery which has been assigned them. The people re
fast filling up the humbler places around the barriers. De S to,
amidst fresh bursts of music, ascends to his chair of state, on
Balthazar seats himself below him. Both carry truncheons. e
signals are given; the sports begin. A troop of young squi es
and pages are running at the ring. The old soldiers and ex e-
rienced cavaliers look on with the natural interest f Vetera 5;
curious to see who are to be their successors in arm and dist~ c~
tion. The riding is very creditable; some instance particul
ly graceful and spirited; though one or two hands e youth a e
rolled over in the dust. The ring is borne off triumph ntly several
times~; and this amusement ceases for a while. Then f llows ale~s~

appeals equally to the sympathies and tastes of nobles ar

A few words, on this subject. When we denounce the hv
of a people, who relish such an amusement, we commit the
error of placing our tastes in judgment upon theirs. T~
is, that the question of humanity is really not involved
the subject, even by our own standards. Our opinion

inanities, when she reads of Gordon Cumming's horrible b~tch~
eries of the elephant, lion, gazelle, and giraffe-...no~J~ creatures
all, harmless where they are found-but passions and appe~ates
-our human nature, gloats Over the murderous page; an~ we
pass, with keen anxiety, in the footsteps of the 8porlsman, and
hear with exultation the crack of his rifle, and rush in with d
eyes of pleasure, to behold his vieVim, ere his ~dying agonies are
over. We take the fish by artful processes, so as to prolong his
struggles, so that our delights shall be prQlonged also; and we
call the angler, "Gentle Master Jzaak," while he details the ~ev

may be made to play, in pain. Our natui~a1ists assert with won-
drous pains-taking, their Own humanity, while they transfix ~he
living butterfly; and opinion, with us, sanctions with this defini-
tion, the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent song-bird, and be~iu-
tiful fly, and wondrous insect,* and curious reptile. Yet none of
these sports, which include all the cruelties which belong to the
Spanishi bull-fight, involve the nobler conditions with which tue
man engages in the latter. In the bull fight he makes his m~n-
hood one of the conditions on which he wages the conflict. Pe
perils life upon his sport. lie does not claim the right to t4e
and torture the life of the animal without giving the beast a
chance in the conflict. The inhumanity in all these practices is
pretty much the same; but much more may be said in favor ~f
the bull-fight than of all the rest. The stakes of th~ opposing
parties are equal in the game. Our opinion, in brief; is more
humane than our humanity. The Englishman and the AmericaA,
man or woman, who once witnesses a bull-fight, discovers th~t
his tastes are superior in strength to his mOrals~.that his virtue~
hold but little, sway in the encounter with his blood-that hi~
opinion is unsustained by his resolutior~that his owit habits are
not a whit more heedful of the claims of the beast, than th~
Spaniard's. lie hunts one class, and the Spaniard another; and
whether he hunts more virtuously than the Spaniard, must be hehi

Alvaro, as Corregidor, or master of cereinonAes~..equivalen~ to
"clear the field" "remove all obstructions from the ain~hi..
theatre."
There is sufficient reason for this order, which is always an un-
gracious one in the ears of "the fancy," "the swell mob," who
have generally taken possession of the ring. They leave it with
reluctance. But, at the order of the C6rregidor, the splen~Iid
body of infantry which De Soto had been training for the Flori-
da expedition, marched in, tQ the sound of martial music, and,
with horizontal lances, swiftly swept the circle. Their ino~ire~
ments were rapid; but the intruders retired slowly, sin~i ly
clearing the barriers, around which they continued to cling, a -
ious to be nigh the scene; to see the 'ninutest movements; a d
to take such part in the affair themselves as fortune would all w
them ;-their delight being found in beating the bull with th ir
sticks, or thrusting at him with iron-pointed staves, from t s
safe entrenchment whenever hi~ course should bring him s
ficiently nigh the barriers. This duty done, the infantry disa -
peared as rapidly as those whom they had driven out. But the nAg
was not left vacant, for a moment. Theirplaces were soon occupied
by the Toreadores consisting of bands of Picadores, of Chulo~r
Banderillero8 and Matadore&amp;. These nowinove inprocessionare~d

sleeves of which are partly laid open and left loose. Their
small.clothes are of leather, the legs coated with a sort of
greaves of plate iron ;-shoes and stockings are concealed by
white gaiters; and a flat, broad, round hat, well ribanded, com-

terminating in knobs, with .which every rascal of the crowc~ goes
properly armed to the circus. Their auxiliary assaults, in fact,
are legitimate, and co~1stitute a fair part of the exhibition.
They contribute greatly to goad a timid animal to the necessary
degree of desperation, work him up to madness; when, no
longer dreading the prick of the lance, though it buries itself an
inch deep in the flesh, he plunges headlong upon his enemies,
not to be again baffled in the assault, not to be turned aside;
and throwing all his brute force into one concentrated effort, puts
the picadores to all their arts for safety.
"El Moro" is a bull of blood. He is a bull of discretion
also. He has only paused to meditate in what manner to use
his force against the skill of his enemies. He has concluded his
plans; and, with a terrible snort, which ends in a i~'oar, he rushes
again upon the picaclores. They meet him handsomely, their
horses' heads a little turned on one side, their spears delivered
dexterously, piercing the neck and shoulders of the beast. This
is no pleasant* sort of salutation. It is apt to turn off ten bulls
in the dozen. They all remember, with keep se~sibiities, the
garrocka, or goad, by~ which the herdsmen have initiated them in
the lessons of obedience. "El Moro" has not lost his sensibili-
ties, or his memories; but "El Moro ' has a prescience which
tells him that he is doomed; and that to feel the pricks too
keenly now, is only to prolong his tortures. He, accordingly,
,resolves to "come up to the scratch" valiantly. Skulking, he
perceives, will avail him nothing. He must die, and he will ~not
die feebly. The spear-point is in his neck deep, deep; and the
blood spirts high, and crimsons his great swart breast and shoul-
ders. But he resolves not to feel his hurts. He does not
swerve: he plunges headlong forward; head downward; horns
.tossing and tail erect, and shaking to and fro like that .of the lion
in his bound, or the serpent in his coil.
"Bravo toro! Bravo El Mioro I" is the delighted roar of the
multitude, as they witness his spirit. The horsemen turn about
like 'lightning; the first darts aside, with excellent skill, and sweeps
out of the track.

THE BULL'S PROWESS.

"Bravo, Pepe 1" cry the mob, as .they witness this dexter y of
the first of the picadores; but the bull sweeps on; he rec ives
the spear-point of the second of his foes; but his own irresi tible
rush, his own headlong bulk, prevents his recoil now, even 'f his
spirit quailed beneath the wound: but it does not. Th pi-
cador tries to wheel and escape his assault, but too late: the
horns of "El IMloro" .are already buried in the flank of the s eed;
he rends his sides, snaps the defensive ribs like glass; stee and
rider roll over upon the plain, the latter upon the off-side o the
animal. The body of the horse constitutes his rampart or a
moment. It is a fearful moment. Life and death hang n it.
An awful hush envelops the amphitheatre; women s riek,
men shout an~,d swear; heads peer over each othcr; eye are
starting almost from their sockets; anxiety and appetite, fe r and
hope, horror and delight, are in wondrous strife in the m ltitu-
dinous soul of the assembly. IE~rery body looks to see th bull
dash down upon the prostrate horse and ridex. The latte lies
close and quiet, expecting the assault: his hope of escape is in
his insignificLtnce. But "El Moro" is a bull of inagnanimi y--a
heroic bull, worthy of the fierce and fearless race after* horn
they have named him. He disdains to touch the fallen ctini.
He spurns the sands.~anew; he dashes after the remaining pica-
dores, who course round the amphitheatre, dexterously avoid~ g his
charge, and seeking to double upon and wound him anew t ev-~
ery chance. Wonderful is the skill they exhibit, and great is the
cheering which they receive. Both bull and picador rece ye it
equally; nothing can be more fair than the applause; it is e ually
merited: and gratitude for the sport alone requires that merit
should be equally acknowledged. "Bravo toro I" "Bravo Pica-
dor I" "Bravo Little Juan I" "Bravo Moro!', These and sirni-
lar cries are heard from all quarters of the ring.
But "El Moro" is not content to share his fame with thers,
-he is greedy of glory. Another picador is overthrown; horse
and man roll on the earth. Little Juan, who won the ravos
lately, is scrambling over the barriers, partly assisted n the
effort by the black brows of the bull himself-his hornsjus miss-

was a narrow escape. The horse of the picador flies wild, with
his entrails hanging from a horrid wound in the belly. The bull
pursues; at every bound he goads tinirblinded .and terrified ani-
mal anew. Both are covered with blood. '%Mira I" c4es the
"fancy "-the "swell mob" from the corridor,-." Mira! que bel
cuerpo de .9angre!" "See! see! what a beauteous body of blood !"
Thus goring as he goes, himself covered with gore, snorting
with fury, his eyes like red fires, flashing in flight, his moi4h full
of foam and blood, his head tossing wildly, the blood and lather
covering his whole body, the bull keeps on his way of terror,
ripping and rending the wounded and agonized horse, until, with
a terrific roar and effort, he fairly lifts the victim from the ~arth,
dashes him down upon the sands, an strikes his hoofs on his neck,
as he bounds over him in pursuit of the remaining picador~

and the c ubos again scatter themselves over the area for the res-

exhaust by his victories. Covered with wounds, he staggers in
the centr of the ring. His eye grows filmy, his head droops,
his tail- ut he is thus far the conqueror, and there is a moment
of silent admiration in tribute to his prowess. But the signs
show that he can make no more sport. He has done all that bull
could do or the popular holiday; and nothing remains but to
administer the coup de grace, and bring on his successors. The
trumpet s unds. The matador-the killer-appears alone upon
the scene. On his appearance, with lifted cap, he make his 6bei-
sance to t e Adelantado. In his right hand he holds a long toledo
-a beauty ul rapier, of the best temper-in his left hand he waves
a little red flag, not much larger than a handkerchief; called the
muleta. e receives the permission which he requires. . "El
Moro's" eath-warrant is given out.
The mat dor exhibits the grace of a posture-master, with all
the coolness of the executioner. He turns towards the victim,
and advance s slowly. He is pale; looks anxious; is evidently
wary. W 11 he may be. Such an adversary, showing as much
cunning as courage, is not often to be met. The matador stops,
and with al the coolness of which he is capable, surveys the foe.
He is a jud e of character, and bulls have a character that re-
quires to b studied. Antonio Pico also has a character at stake.
He is greatly renowned among the Cubans. He has slain his
hundreds, a d he must show himself worthy of his renown. His
movements ere at once graceful and decided; and, his thrusts
were as swi as dexterous. He was the master of his art.
sometimes, t e master fails, and Pico was now evidently cautious.
It is a duel hich he is about to fight. The bull is still danger-
ous-his rag is still deadly. He has lost- his energy, but not
his malice. ico has no shield, nothing but the muleta, and his
beautiful ra ier. His ball dress of silk, satin and ribbon, is at
strange varia ce with the duty to be done; but that is one of the
charming Pea ures of the performance. He commands himself;

restrains himself; a thousand eyes are upon him; he knots it,
but he sees nothing but the eyes of the bull. Their tame, f lmY
expression does not deceive him. He fancies that "El M9ro
understands the whole proceeding, what is to be done, and ~hat
is to ~be feared; and tihat he is preparing himself with more ~han
hull subtlety, to make a fearful fight of it. It must be sub1~lety
now, opposed to subtlety ;-the wisdom of the man to the excit-
ed instincts of the beast. The expectation is, that the bull will
run at the red flag; when the matador will receive him at the
point of the weapon, which pierces him between the shoulder and
the~ bone blade. If the bull has much spirit left, he will d6 this.
The presumption is, if he will not, that he succumbs to his fate-
that his energies are exhausted.
Pico waves his muleta in front of the animal. "El Moro"
makes a single charge, but recoils--stops short, and stands with
head down, as if in waiting. A shout of contempt, from the
"fancy," assails him for this ignoble conduct. It encourages Pi-
co. He advances, waves the flag anew; again the bull charges;
the steel flashes, quick as lightning ;-strikes ;-strikes ;-all see;-
but it is an awkward stroke! Pico's nerves have been troubled.
The steel strikes the bone ;-it flies from the hand of the matador;
and, with a roar, the recovering bull is upon him, with a dreadful
guiding sweep. The brave fellow darts aside, but not unhurt.
He staggers,-he makes for the barriers: the cunning "El
Moro," with brightening eye, surges after him. The suspense is
awful; the women scream; the men shout; the matador staggers
forward to the barriers; falls, without catching them; and, but a
moment-remains for escape! a terrible anxiety prevails. In that
moment, a gigantic form leaps over the barriers from the corri-
dor, He is dark like the red man. He is of that ra~~e~ mixed
with the white and the negro,-a most unnatural and atrocious
combination. But what he is, no one as yet can distinguish.
They see nothing clearly. They only know that he stands be-
tween the fallen P~co - and the charging El Moro. They see a
common red ker~hief waving in one hand. They see not
the short, sharp ki~ife in the other. They see, however, that he

delight, and a thousand voices hailed the signal with triumphant
shouts. The sound~ and clamors from the spacious area were
echoed back from ~all the little hills around. They were all in
motion at ~the music, and clapping th~Ar hands with joy. Soon,
the fierce bray of lihe trumpet was heard mingling wildly with
sweetei' music. '~on came the roll of the drum; and steeds
neighed, and squires shouted, and the mountain peasant began
i~o sing, in his exulting unconsciousness, the rude ballads of his
distant forests. TIi~ere was shouting and clamor on every side;
~and the rushing o~ crowds, and the din of conflicting sounds,
might have led the unadvised spectator to suppose that chaos
had come again, sc~ extreme was the confusion. But in all this
confusion the truncheon of command prevailed. So well had
everything been organized by Don Balthazar de Alvaro, and so
native were such exercises to the multitude, that no conflict or
disorder followed, where all things appeared to promise nothing
less. The people knew their places; the officials their business.
The heralds, and pi~rsuivants, and alguazils were all in sufficient
number and sufficiently active. But, where the popular consent
is with the given purpose, it is surprising how multitudes work
together to the common end. The officers skirted the harriers
within as well as without, and kept them free from encroach-
ment; and, gradually, the throngs, pressing forward like crowd.
ing billows of the sea, subsided calmly into their places along
the galleries. The seats were filled as if by magic. The family
groups, or special j~arties, each unobstructed in its wish to keep
together, formed so many little domestic circles along the im-
mensely crowded jiers; and the hum and buzz of conversation,
free and unembarrassed as in private homes, went on. The
merry laugh, and the smart jest, and the careless comment, were
uttered aloud, as 4f none but friendly hearers were at hand to
listen. It is a common error that the Spaniard is inflexible as
well as proud. This is only true of a high state of. convention
in the old comnwnities. In the new world, where all were
adventurers, even nobility threw off some of its reserves, and
accommodated itself to a more democratic condition of things ;-

a result, Indeed, inevitable from the necessities of the region. But
to our pr~gress.
Suddei~ly, the bands struck up the national air, and thi~ was
the signal for the approach and entrance of the Adelantado, the
noble knights and ladies who immediately attended ~him and
his lovely rife, and such favorites as Were specially invited to the
more eley ted platform which was assigned to the represent~
tive of majesty. This platform, it may be well to state, though
elevated above the lower ranges of the seats assigned to the mul-
titude, wa~ yet somewhat nearer to the circus. It was immedi:
ately above the corridor, which, in all other parts of the area,
was uncovered. Indeed, it seemed to hang almost Over the lists,
and was not so high but that it might be easily touched by a
lance in the hands of a knight on horseback. Along this platform,
and in the foreground, on well and richly cushioned seats, the
ladies were seated, 0C91.lpying preferred places; the gallants in
attendance taking position in the rear. In the centre of this
former range, sate Don Balthazar de Alvaro, acting as warder;
and immediately behind, but on a dais above him, occupying a
richly garmented fauteui4 sate the Adelantado and his lady.
With the entrance of the two last, the viva3 became wilder than
the music, and De Soto bowed impressively and gracefully, to
the popular applause. His noble form and princely carriage, the
splendor of his costume, and a proper regard to the immense
amount of patronage which he had brought to the island, made
him a wonderful favorite. Nor was his noble wife less so. She
had virtues, indeed, superior to his, though of a less showy char-
acter; and her personal beauty, her noble carriages the richness
and exquisite taste of her dress, the equal. grace and dignity of
her bearing, served to make her an object of like and equal at.~

Olivia de Alvaro o~~cupied one of these foremost seats, near her
uncle, and a little below, but quite close to, the Lady babella.
She too was splend~dly habited; but she was perhaps the least
conscious of' the fact of all in that as'~embly. She had made
her toilet with little heart for it, and little heed to appearances.
Her thoughts were of the saddest; and 'her face now was pale
as death. There was a brightness, however, in her eye, of sin-
gular wildness, and occasionally it flashed out with a vivid and
peculiar intelligence. But she seldom trusted herself to gaze
about the amphitheatre. She seemed to dread the encounter
with other eyes. Beside her sate the frail, fair beauty, the wife
of Nuno de Tobar, whose little tongue kept up a surprising dis-
charge of small arms, without intermission. He~ supply of
missiles seemed inexhaustible, and as they were mostly addressed
to the ears of Olivia itis not a matter of wonder if she had nothing
to say in return. ~The lack of opportunity, indeed, was rather
grateful than otherwise. It saved her from all necessity of find-
ing apologies for her\ taciturnity. Behind Olivia stood the pro.
vincial courtier, Don Augustin de Sinolar, redolent of perfume,
and diffuse and gay in silks and glitter. There were other gal-
lants in waiting: but we must not stop to enumerate. The
anxiety of the multitude has brought them to that .hush of ex-
pectation which, e'~en more than militaryy authority, is the best
security for order. Th~ Adelantado, like every good actor, well
understood the impropriety of keeping the stage waiting. He
rose gracefully and waved his truncheon. At the signal, a sud-
den blare from the trumpets, at the entrance, quickened the pul-
sation in every bo~om. The blast was' answered from a dozen
quarters all around, the response from the tents of the challengers
to the signal which required them to appear. But a few mo-
ments more elapsed when the trumpets within and without
pealed in unison ~ a lively and prolonged strain of wild and
chee~fal music; and then was heard the heavy trappings of am
~ proa~hing horse.
" '~?hey come! They come !" was the involuntary cry from a
thousand lately stifled voices. Then the heralds and pursuivants

slowly cantered into the lists, skirting closely the barriers; and
when expectation was at the highest, the challengers, six in num..
ber, made their appearance. And, truth to speak, they showed
themselvc~sright comely chevalier to the eye, and seemed well
able to C rry themselves bravely and keep manfully the field.
They wer headed, as was fitting, by the Lieutenant General of
the army, the stout and wealthy Ilidalgo, Don Vasco Porcallos
de Figuer a. This cavalier, whatever may have been his per-
sonal mer ts, was perhaps rather more indebted to hi&amp;~wealth
for the di tinction he enjoyed, than to his genius as a soldier.
We do no know that, up to this period, he had ever made any
remarkable figure in arms. He certainly had, thus far, taken no
such place in the popular imagination as was assigned to sundry
of their famous men, who had proved even unfortunate~such as
Alonzo de Ojeda, and many others. But wealth, with frequent
largesse, a right generous spirit, and a gracious carriage, .will
work wonders towards achieving temporary distinction. The
reader may not have forgotten the policy of the Adelantado, already
indicated, by which he was moved to depose the amorous knight,
Nuno de Tobar, from the office which *he subsequently conferred
on Vasco de Porc lbs. W~ are not prepared to say that he re-
joiced in the prete t which enabled him to do so. But, i1 was
one certainly whic he did not greatly regret. He was not dis-
pleased at having he means wherewith to buy the favors of the
rich cavalier. An Vasco Por~allos did not defraudd expectation.
lie did not withho d his treasures from the expedition to Florida.
His castellanos wer freely rendered to tl~e wants of his superior,
with whose ambiti us views no man oP the army seemed so
deeply to sympathy e. Vasco Porcallos was seized with a new-
born desire for fa e, without foregoing a jot of ~his old passion

of the conquerors t Florida; and, at the same time, he made
sundry ~shrewd cal ulations of the profit which would ensue
from his landed e tates in Cuba, by concentrating upon then~
the labor of the palachian savages whom he expected to
make captive in h s progress. The two passions, glory and

gain,' strove equally together in his bosom; and, with such rare
harmony, that neitl~er could be said to be, at any time, in the as-
cendant. Vasco Porcallos was of a brave temper; and, though
never distinguished in war, as a captain, had yet e~ijoyed consid-
erable experience in the new world's conquests. Had he been
a few years younger, he might still have hoped great things from
his gallant spirit and generous ambition: But our cavalier was
oi~i the wrong side of fifty, and few soldiers have ever acquired
reputation, or achieved successes in foreign invasion, after they
have passed the meridian line of life. It may be reasonably
doubted, if his prudence was at all conspicuous in his engaging
in a long and hazardQus expe~lition. That he would endure well
enough the toils of a single campaign , was not questioned even
among those who were jealous of his wealth and great appoiiit-
ments; and still l9ss was it doubted that he would carry himself
well in such passages of arms as it should fortune him to en-
* counter. He was acknowledged to b&amp; a good lance and ~a prop-
er horseman, and as now he appeared iivthe amphitheatre, portly
o( figure, tall, erect, covered with shining armor, riding a splendid
bay, whose form ~nd color were equally free of blemish-for
the white spot, of crescent shape, conspicuous in the centre of
the horse's forehead, was held to be a beauty and not a blemish
-the loud shout of applause which welcomed him, seemed to
give assurance of the 'popular confidence in his prowess. His
steed was gayly caparisoned with his master's favorite colors,
green and gold, and his ~own bearing seemed to exhibit a full con-
sciousness of the distinction he enjoyed, in carrying so brave a
rider. The portly knight bestrode him with an air and spirit
worthy of so gallant an animal; and, as he pricked him forward
with the formidable Spanish rowel and made him caracole to the
balcony, where sate the Adelantado and his noble companions of
the fair sex, the populace, again shouted their unsuppressible
admiration. Vasco Porcallos wore a brilliant armor, which be~
trayed never a stains of the soil. A rich surcoat of green silk
(afterwards thrown dif) hung somewhat loosely above his armor,
whieh was of polished steel, fretted in figures of gold and silver,

vines and flower appearing in the sort of jeweler's work which'
is known as van gated gold. ,His helmet was of like material
and ornament, su mounted with a bunch of beautiful and costly
plumes of the he on. The small shield which he carried lightly
upon his left arm was of steel also, inlaid with a circular bor-
dering of gold, 0 vines and flowers, in the centre of which,
splendidly illumin ted, was the armorial ensign of the knight-
a bright, keen eye looking out from a sun of blazing gold. The
arrogant motto s oke sufficiently for the insolent ambition of
the cavalier. 8 mio lo que veo !"-(" That is mine which I
se&amp; !") But this confidence vexed no self-esteem in all the
assembly. It was but the embodiment of the national conceit,
and it was perha s warranted by the fact. They had made
their own all that hey had seen. It was an encouragement to
valor and ~enterprise, that the nation should thus believe, that
there was nothing, in reserve, which its warriors could not, in
like manner, mak their own. The faith makes the victory.
Vasco Porcallos, k own by his largesse much more than by his
valor, was readily assumed to possess a spirit and capacity
worthy of his bou ty; and his 'graceful obeisance before the
dai8 upon which H man de Soto sate, was congratulated by the
repeated viva8 of th multitude, and acknowledged by the gracious
smile and courtesy f the Adelantado. Backing his steed with
an elegant and mea ured, yet free motion, Don Vasco gave way
to his brother chall ngers to come forward.
He was followed by Balthazar de Gallegos, a stout and gal-
lant adventurer; w o, without being quite so matured by time
as Vasco Porcallos, ad, perhaps, seen quite as much service in
Indian warfare. Hi carriage was good, and his skill and grace
in managing his stee were quite equal to those of his predeces~
sor; but there was lamentable disparity in their equipment.
The horse was a fine one, big-limbed, yet of lively motion; but
his furniture was rus y; and the armor of the rider was distin-
guished equally by he antiquity of its appearance, and the
numerous dints of ba tle which it showed. E~ven the slight dec.-
orations which Balth am de Gallegos employed in honor of the

occasion,-consisting of gaudy scarf and various colored shoulder
knots and ribbons, served rather to expose than to relieve the
defects and decayed places in his rusty harness. His shield was
large and cumbrous, but carried lightly on his muscular arm.
It was of a faded blue ground, on which was painted a volcanic
mountain in eruption, the jets of fire ascending without falling-
the motto indicative of a thoroughly Spanish ambition-" Mias
bjen consumir que no exalta~rme!"-(" Rather burn than not rise!")
A few cheers followed the appearance of this cavalier; but they
sounded very coldly and meanly, succeeding those which had
honored the man of fortune; and after making his obeisance,
Balthazar de Gallegos, dr~w his steed into the background, as if
satisfied that his mountain would burn rather unprofitable at the
present moment.
Vei~y different was the welcome which hailed the appearance
of the third challenger. This was our old acquaintance, the amo-
rous young cavalier, Nuno de Tobar. Nuno was a favorite with
all classes, poor and rich, men no less than women. His known
gi'ace and bravery,-his frank carriage, easy, accessible, playful
manner,-the generosity of his heart,-the unaffected simplicity
of his natuie,-all combined to secure for him the, most sweet
voices of the multitude. These became clamorous as the spec-
tators beheld the elegance and excellence with which he man-
aged the iron-gray charger which he bestrode-the dexterity with
which he led him, caracoling, almost waltzing, around the lists,
to the foot of the gallery where the Adelan4TLdo, presided. The
steed himself was one to delight the eye of all who beheld him,-
his symmetrical outline, his fiery grace, and the perfect obedi-
ence which he displayed, even wheiv his spirit seemed eager to
burst from the bondage of his own frame. The armor of Nuno
de Tobar was bright and polished. He had taken some lessons
on this subject from the Portuguese brothers, whom he aimed to
rival. It was not rich, like that of Vasco de Porcallos, nor in
such good taste. In truth, it must be admitted that the tastes
of Nuno were inclined to be gaudy. The decorations of his
armor, due probably as much to his gay young wife, as to his

Aceytuno was a brilliant animal; ha color something between a
sorrel and a bay, but of a blood so rich that it seemed rather to
diffuse itself everywhere beneath the skin, through which it shone
like a purple dye, than to pursue its bounded course through the
ordinary channel of vein and artery.
Each of these knights had his motto and coat-of-arms. The
shield of Christopher de Spinola carried a pair of huge wings,
under which was written, "A solas me sostingo," (Alone I sustain
myself;) not a bad image for a modest bachelor, who had neither
wife nor children, and was not required to feed the orphans of
any of his neighbors. That of the gallant youth, Gonzalo Syl.
vestre, would be regarded in our day as something impious, even
for a-lover, who is supposed to be excusable, by reason of the
amiable insanity under which he labors, for any infidelity except
that to his mistress. His shield represented the face of a very
beautiful woman, and the motto, "Sin vos, y sin Dios y mi,'7 (With-
out thee I am without God and without myself;) was considered
by all the young damsels present as the most felicitous of all sweet
sayings, to which, whatever might be the objections of the Deity
himself; the Blessed Virgin ought by no manner of reason to
object at all. The figure upon the shield of Don Mateo de
Aceytuno was confined to his profession of arms. A mailed
hand grasps a lance; the device was, "No hay otro vinculo que el
7&amp;uestro," (" There is no bond of union but ours,"-or, as under.
D
stood, if not expressed-" we part all bonds but our own.")
Mateo de Aceytuno completed the number of the challengers.
They now rode together round the lists, prepared to undertake
all comers. The first pa sages were tQ be with the lance; to be
followed by the battle-a e or sword, according to the~ pleasure
of the contending parti ; and the breaking of the lance, the

combat in each c~se, and sufficient for the victory.

Liii of charms to which they might more properly assert their
claims; and, despite his rough exterior, Baithazar de Gallegos
showed himself as eager of the notice of the ladies as any of the
rest. Of whom, indeed, does not beauty, when it smiles, make
the fool ~ The roug~a soldier, seasoned to ill usage and strife,
callous to blows, and sworn to plunder, was quite as solicitous
of the approval of bright eyes, as the young gallant just about to
undertake his devoir to secure his spurs of knighthood.
But a rougher parley awaits all the parties. The Adelantado
gives the signal for i~he~ assailants to appear. Don Balthazar de
Alvaro waves his truncheon; the heralds shout, the trumpets
sound, and the trappings of horse again are heard. Soon, the
six assailing cavaliers begin to pass into the amphitheatre.
We shall be excused from such details, in respect to these, as
we have given of th~ challengers, and for obvious reasons. They
do not concern the a4ual business of this true chronicle, and enough
ha~ been shown~to afford a general idea of the habits, manner~,
and characteristics f' the times. We shall, accordingly, confinq
ourselves, hereafter, to such persons only as belong to our dra-
U
matis personae.
Of the six assail nts, then, we are required to report that
Don Philip de Va onselos ranked oi~ly as the fifth. His own
modesty gav~ him his position. He might have led the party,
had it pleased him ~to do so. But he preferred simply to take
his place as one of s~veral. His brother Andres was not of either
party; but this, it must be remembered, did not affect his claims
to take the field agfrmnst all, or any, of those who might remain
the conquerors.
Philip was mou~ited upon a coal-black steed of famous nur-
tui~; large of frai~ne, strong of muscle, fleet of foot, hardy to
endure, and of a beautiful symmetry. It was a pleasure to be.
hold his form, simj~ly as he stood, without motion, obedient to
the rein. His eye~ flashed fire as - he darted into the ring, and
heard the mingled cries and clamors from a hundred trumpets,

a sort of sombre nobleness in his aspect that compelled respect-
ful attention. His kiiown prowess, honored by those who were
jealous of his nation, increased the admiration of those who sur-
veyed his form and w4tche~\l his movements. Of these he reeked
little, and perhaps saw nothing; but there were eyes in that
great assembly whor~i it thrilled his bosom to feel were behold-
ing him also. In the brief moment of communion with the gal-
lery, where sate the ~randees of th~ island and their families, his
glance had encountei~ed with that of Olivia de Alvaro. ~he had

generosity of a nob~e nature, he preferred to keep himself In
reserve for such other inequality in the struggle as might yield
him an unembarrassed combatant wholly to himself. New
lances having been si~tpplied to those who had fractured them fairly
in the passage and without disparagement to their arms, the sig.
nal was given for a fresh encounter; the vacancies, meanwhile,
being supplied in the ranks of both parties. In this second pas-
sage, Don Vasco de Porcallos carried himself so handsomely
against his opponent, who was a huge Fleming of. nearly his own
dimensions, that the latter was incontinently overthrown, and
removed almost insensible from the field. A similar fortune,
though not with such serious hurt, befell Christopher de Spinola,
whose boast "a solas me sostingo," was not justified by the result
of the encounter. He was handsomely lifted out of his saddle
by the lance of Diego Arias Tinoco, a brave captain, rough as a

The latter, being now disengaged, was singled out by Nuno de
Tobar, and his horse falling, and swerving in the shock, he was
adjudged to have been worsted, and very reluctantly yielded for
the moment to a conqueror.
The successes of Nuno were welcomed right royally by the
cheers of the admiring spectators; whose comments, by the
way, were administered unsparingly, whether for praise or blame,
at every charge in the business of the field. Meanwhile, Philip
de Yasconselos has borne himself in a second encounter with the
gigantic Mateo de Aceytuno. In the first, a gentle and joyous pas-
sage, as the heralds styled it, the~ advantage was decreed to rest
with neither. Their lances had been mutually well addressed, and
had shivered at the same moment, both knights preserving their
seats handsomely, though not, perhaps, with equal grace ;-for
Philip had few equals in mere carriage-~and recovered their
places in an instant; but proper judgments remarked, in the
strong patois of the mountains, that the horse of Mateo had too
little bone for his master's beef. In this, he certainly suffered
some disadvantage. But the second conflict was decisive; and

here, had work enough. They will make us glad of all the good
lances that will crowd thither under our banner. The Portu-
guese is a &amp;ood lance, and his brother, the younger, is a good
lance; though where he hides himself at this time, and where-
fore, I cannot guess. I had looked' to see him here. Had he

meat hath been bolt and spear-head, and your drink hath been

brave steeds! To it! to it! brave lances, noble steeds !"
This was one ~of a hundred voices, eagerly urging the cavaliers
to the conflict which was held so equal. Equal in many respects,
there were yet some, in which the knight of Portugal, or as they
called him, "the Knight of the Homeless Falcon,"-in allusion to
his crest-had much the advantage. His steed had been better
trained for such encounters; he himself had seen more various
service; and he possessed. a sedate and temperate coolness of
mind, to which the somewhat mercurial nature of Nuno de To-
bar could not lay claim. Above all, he knew just in what
particulars he himself was strong and his opponent weak, and
he prepared rather to exercise his patience and watchfulness, than
his strength and skill. Nuno de Tobar, ambitious of excelling-
fighting in the presence of the army, and of that beauty which
was usually the source of his inspiration-resolved that Philip de
Vasconselos should have need of both. . Besides, he was to fight
for the honor of Spanish lances. Though, personally, a devoted
friend of his present opponent, he had heard the popular cries
which insisted upon their Castilia~ representative, in opposition to
the foreign~ knight; and he was determined that Spain's honor
should suffer nothing at his hands.
But Philip de Vasconselos had also heard these cries. He
had long since been bitterly made to feel the jealousy and preju-
dices which existed amongst the Castiians towards himself and
his Portuguese associates, and the pride of self and nation, which

Tobar, had been addressed to the shield of. his opponent. This
was the common mark in the tournament of that day; the want
of exercise making the atteint more difficult when addressed to
the gorget, or the helm; but the cavalier of Portugal had prac-
tised the one method as well as the other, and not designing a
surpriseupon his opponent, he shook out his lance, ere the trum-
pets sounded, and levelled it in the direction of De Tobar's visor.
The hint seemed to be taken, for~the lance of the latter was at
once slightly elevated, receiving a new direction in his glance.
Thus prepared, the signal was given, and they hurried to the
shock. At the moment of crossing spears, his point still ad-
dressed to the visor of his opponent, Vasconselos threw suddenly
the lower edge of his shield forwards, inclining it over his own
head, and watching the object of his aim from beneath the very
rim of the buckler. No time was left the other for providing
against this peculiar interposition of the shield, which required
him to have aimed so truly as to thrust his lance directly against
the visor of his antagonist, the crest of whrch was totally covered,
leaving the mark aimed at reduced to the smallest possible size.
The skill of Tobar was not equal to such a manoeuvre. The
point of his lance accordingly struck the edge of the raised shield,
and glanced upward,. and onward, over the smooth surface, ex-
pending itself in air; while the point of Vasconselos, admirably
delivered, was rjveted in the bars of his antagonist's visor, so
firmly, and so fairly, that there was no escape, no evasion of it
possible; and the gall~n~ Nuno was borne from his saddle, with-
out seeming resistance. Indeed, the spear so fixed, the onward
rush of' both steeds gave it an impulse which no skill, no strength,
at such a moment, could possibly withstand. It carried him
headlong to the ground, and the steed went free from under
1dm.
There was a cry, almost a howl, from the multitude, at the
thll of their favorite, and the national~ champion.
"Demordos!" sang out the swell mob in the corridor, who
flung up their arms with their voices, and swore, and tore their

had been so roughly handled, to entertain a reasonable appre-
hension of the consequences to himself; and, if the truth were
known, he was in little humor for this last grand passage. Could
lie have retired from the contest without discredit, and without
utter forfeiture of the honors he had already Won, it is perhaps
doing him no injustice to say that he would most certainly have
declined it. He had not gone through his fatigues without suf-
fering. His portly frame, for a long time unused to harness,
was now shrinking beneath its incumbrance. He was reeking
with perspiration, which a brimming goblet of' cool wine of Xeres,
which he had just~swallowed, had not tended to diminish. But,
with all his annoyances and doubts, he put on a good countenance,
and, closing up his visor, prepared for the encounter, with his
best hope and spirit.
"The fat knight adds but another to the trophies of our Por-
tuguese cavalier. Philip de Vasconselos will remain master of
the field; certainly, he hath most admirable skill of horse and
weapon. He hath but a single joust before him, and then he
may elect the Queen of Love and Beauty 1,'
This was said by Don Balthazar de Alvaro. It was addressed
to the lady of the Aclelantado. But it was meant for other
~ears. At a little distance, on the left of Hernan de Soto, stood
Andres de Yasconselos. He had been a witness of all that had
taken place; and had heard the significant words of Oliyia's un-
cle. For a moment he gazed steadily upon the field; then, giving

Don BaltJaazar judged rightly of the feelings of Andres, when~
he allowed his own nature to provide the standards of judgment.
Why had Andres gone to his pavilion ~ we shall see hereafter.
Enough, that he summons his squire to his aid; that he cases
himself in armor; that he bids them get ready his destrier, that
he buckles sword to his side, and shakes aloft the heavy lance,
and tries its burden with his hands. Let us leave him, and re-

he, no doubt, question ed his ow-n resources of skil and strength

spared some of the fortifications of defeat. A m fortune hap-
pened to. him, while in mid career, which proba ly saved our
corpulent cavalier fro ~ a much worse evil. His steed, which
was as high-spirited a he was powerful, trod upo the barbed

touched the quick of t e animal's foot, and, with a snort of ter-

Portugal elevated his own lance, and, having full control of his
steed, drew him suddenly up, arresting him in his full speed so
admirably, that he stood quivering upon the spot; the unexpended
impulse which he had received now shaking him as with an ague.
In another instant, Philip de Vasconselos was on his feet, an~
had grasped the bridle of the unmanageable steed of his riva1,~
which, by this time, w~s in a state of fury, occasioned by the
agony of his hurt, which threatened momently to unseat his
rider. The timely service enabled Don Yasco to alight, and
gratefully acknowledging the assistance rendered he at the sam~
time acknowledged himself vanquished.' The courtesy of hi~
opponent, indeed, had alone spared him this misfortune. Do4
Philip gracefully rejected this acknowledgment, and, ascribing
the event solely to the sufferings of his rival's horse, propose
that Don Vasco should find another. But, by this time, the
chivalrous feelings of the latter had soniewhat subsided. He felt
much less enthusiastic than before~ and was rather pleased now
~ at a means of evasion, which, whiP it lost him the final honor of
the day, at least left him in possession of the credit which he had
acquired in the previous, passages. The knight of the Falcon.
remounted his own steed, and resumed his place within the list~.
He stood alone, and in expectation. No champion stood before
him, challenging the triumph~which he had won,-the crownin~
triumph of the field. There was a sudden and deep silence
throughout the assembly. The feeling was everywhere adverse
to his claims and expectations; and it was with something of
contempt, not unmixed with bitterness, that our knight of Por-
tugal was reminded of the national prejudice, which felt relu4-
tant to do justice to the achievements of the' stranger. Ther~
w~s no other reason for the silence and forbearance of Don
ilernan de Soto, who, in the case of a Castilian champion, or
in that of one to ~whom he felt no personal prejudice, would, no
doubt, have promptly risen in his place, and summoned the su~.
cessful knight forward, to choose the Queen of Love and Beaut~r,

throw, in the passage-at-arms with his brother. Indeed, to spea1~
plainly, Philip knew too well his own superiority of training,
art, and muscle; though the vanity of Andres was suchrthat he
had persuaded himself to a very different estimate .of their mu-
tual powers. He was yet to be taught a better knowledge of
their disparity. The reluctance of Philip to engage in such a
contest, even though the tournament implied neither strife nor
malice, was based upon his just knowledge of human nature;
upon his thorough experience jn respect to the mood and char-
acter of Andres-his passionate blood; his disappointments of
heart; his jealousy of the superior influence and reputation of
his brother, We can readily divine the several reasons which
governed Philip in his anxiety to escape a conflict, in regard to
which he yet entertained no fears. Now that they stood con-
fronted, and the contest was inevitable, he endeavored to calm
his own blood, and control his temper, somewhat excited by the
circumstances which had marked his treatment by the Adelan-
tado and the assembly. But this was not so difficult. The re-
ception of Andres, by the audience, was of a sort to kindle in
the elder brother a sentiment of passionate indignation, as it
declared~ how grateful to the common feeling wo~ild be his over-
throw. The multitude hailed the entry of the~ new champion

of his desire. Why should he take the field now, unless with
the aim to pluck them from the brow of. his brother ~ It was a
bad passion-hate, revenge, anything but an honorable ambition
-which prompted his appearance now, at the last moment.
Olivia thought all these things. Such were the thoughts of
Philip also. But he strove to restrain and silence them; and, in
the brief interval allowed him, his inward struggle w~s to subdue
himself;-to keep his own bad passions in subjection, and to offer
no such provocation to those of his brother, as would place him
entirely beyond control of human reason. He resolved to be
forbearing in all respects. But this did not imply that he would
forego any of his resources of skill or strength in the conflict.
He was not, by any means, to yield his laims to the honors of
the field, in favor of any opponent. On his point he was reso.
lute; and, thus resolved, it became hi ,if he would effect his
triumph, and avoid giving unnecessary revocation, or inflicting
mortification upon his brother, that he s oul&amp; maintain the cool.
est temper, and suffer nothing to distu b his passions. It re.
quired some effort to do this, for he had felt bitterly his isolation
in the last few moments,-a feeling sadly increased, when, as he
phrased it, his own brother had joined his enemies against him.
We must not allow it to be supposed that the Adelantado
beheld the opening of the new issue between these parties, with.
out being somewhat sensible to the strangeness of its aspects.
His instincts, too, were at work; and remembering to have
heard of the quarrel between the brothers, he began to think
there was something unnatural in the approaching combat. His
conscience reproached him for the ungenerous delay which had
kept Philip de Vasconselos from the crown of victory, and af.
forded the opportunity for the event, of the results and character
of which he had grown apprehensive; and he looked dubiously
at the warder of the field, Don Balthazar de Alvaro, and for
the first time felt suspicious of those motives, on his part, which
had moved him to urge the delay in closing the lists. But there
was now no moment for arrest and interposition, unless by the
exercise of a seemingly arbitrary authority, which would show

-.-~" If thou fail me, I will look to surer w apon."
The third passage was waited for with great impatience by the
multitude. The previous combats seemed to have been mere
child's play to these. Every~ one felt th~t the present passages
were~ marked by passion much more serious than those of chiv-
alric courtesy, even when stimulated bLy ambition, or urged
by the desire of doing greatly in the ey s of love and beauty.
The spectators were now hushed and brea Mess. The occasional
formulas
cri~s of the heralds, repeating the old  of encouragement,
seemed very unmeaning sounds in respect to such a conflict.
They were felt almost as impertinence; and, indeed, by this
time, the heralds themselves seemed to a rive at this opinion, for
they suddenly became silent. All now as eager expectation.
The ~signal followed, and the passage. There was the same
fearful concussion, as before; the clouds f dust; the confusion.'
But the results were more decided, and the encounter was fol-
lowed by a wild, sharp cry, full of rage nd fury. Soon, Philip
de Vasconselos emerged out of the dust- 4oud, and coursed once
round the rThg; a moment after, Andr4s was beheld, on foot,
with his battle-axe in his hand, and dartii~g after his brother with
the ferocity and speed of a tiger. The steed of the younger
knight was down, rolling over in the san~1; by what hurt or ac-
cktent, no one could conjecture. He hi self had all the action
of a madman. His fine scarf was riven; his armor covered with
dust, and his helmet thrown off. His hair, which was long,
~floated wildly; his fake was crimson wit passion, and his eyes
glared with a fury which threatened to destroy everything in his
path. He made headlong way toward~ Don Philip, who had
now drawn up his steed, and stood quietly, if not calmly, await-
ing him at the barriers, which was as fa1r hack as he ~could re-
cede. Here he must stop and encounter what should happen,

roars of admiration, lie knew the value of popular applause,
and quietly rein counting his steed, he stood in ence waiting for
the summons of the warder, to the foot of th dais, where the
Adelantado was to place the crown upon the ance of the con:
queror, who was required, in turn, to lay it a the foot of the
lady whom he should designate as the Queen of Love arid Beauty.
It was her task to accept the tribute, and, lifting up the trophy so
deposited, to place it on the head of her ehampi n.
There was no reluctance, now, on the part of the Adelantado
to do justice to the knight of the Falcon. De Soto, it is true,
had his prejudices as well as his people; and his pride had been
somewhat stung by the reserve which had been e hibited towards
him by Philip de Vasconselos; to say nothing of the olThnce
which the latter had given, in announcing his dou ts in respect to
his farther connection with the expeditioii to orida. But,
though a proud and selfish person, De Soto was ot a base one.
lie had his moments of prejudice and passion, but was by no
means insensible to greatness of soul and heroic character, even
in the instance of an enemy. lie was thorough disarmed by
the conduct of Philip; and some compunctious v stings of con~
science now made him anxious to atone, as far s possible, by
the most prompt acknowledgment, for his past co dress and ne-
glect. lie bade the warder do his duty, and, at signal given,
and amidst a passionate faifare from the whole orps of trum-
peters, the knight of the Falcon was led up to the f ot of the dais.
Here he dismounted uncovered his head, ascen ed the rude
steps, which had ~been hastily placed~ for the purpose, and pre-
sented his lance at the bidding of De Soto, who,~ a warm and

and address, in the tourney,-there were not a few to r
that so much heroism should be accompanied by so very I

It was now the task of Olivia de Alvaro to place the coi

The amusements of the day were over. The trumpets sounded'the
retreat ; the audience slowly melted away ; but long before the
assembly was ~ispersed, Philjp de Vasconselos had disappeared
from the public sight.
-He proceede9i at once to the lodgings of his brother, but did
not see him, as he feared that his presence would only inch ease
the disorder of the latter. He ascertained, however, that hi .de-
lirum and fever -did not increase, and that he was well -at-
tended. The p 1ysician of De Soto himself had been sent,
and had. admini tered some soothing drugs, after taking romn
him a goodly qi antity of blood. He still remained with hiim,
and would not suffer him to be disturbed. The attack had been
severe as sudden, but it was not of prolonged duration; and judi-
cious treatment, seconded by the youth and vigor of his constitu-
tion, en abled hin, after a few days, to rise again to his feet. In a
veek he was abl~ to resume his armor, and to exercise at the
head of his little company. But he remained comparatively fee-
be for some time, and the mortification which he had suffered
hung like a dark shadow upon his soul. He became habitually
gomy and nmor se ; addressing himself wholly to military stu-
dies and exercise ,and never suffering himself to be seen in so-
scey. Gadual he began to entertain more just and generous
feings towards is brother, though from this period there was
no longer any coi iality between them. The events which were
yet to occur served, in great degree, to disarm him of that
jealous hostility to Philp which had been the sole cause of his
recent madness Philip, though solicitous of his health and

present 'all his security. Of course it is understood that he can
never be reconciled to her union with Philip, or, indeed, with any
man. We hav~ but imperfectly unfolded our narrative thus far,
if it be now necessary that we should endeavor to establish this
fact. His selfishness at once of avarice and passion, was a set.

cording to the dictates of her affections.
But it was necessary to confirm her in her Previously expressed
and virtuous resolution of self-denial, lie was required to
strengthen her dE~termination against the pleadings of her owii

unanimity active, ,~s a barrier against her passion. This he now
perceived to be ore Powerful than he, or even she, had previ-
ously suspected, lie had watched her through all the caprices
of the tournament and had seen the warmth and violence of her
feelings, written ii her face and action amidst all the changes of
the struggle. "Sl~ie is not to be trusted to her own sentiments,."
was his reflection. "She may resolve as she pleases, in her quiet
moments of thought; but let Philip de Vasconselos kneel im-
ploring at her feet,~ and she will probably forget all her honorable
resolves. She wil yield to his entreaties, before she~is conscious
of the extremity o~ her admissions. I must provide against this."
Let us see what ar~ his for effecting his objects.
Olivia was recli irig upo a couc in the apartment opening

And she sunl~ into a long, sad revery; and the thought of Don
Philip came to I~er, and brought with it fancies of the most. bi~ight
and cheering feficity. She fancied him at her feet; she tho~igh;
of herself in his arms. The world shut out, in the lone security
of their mountain hacienda, she - said to herself-" Surely this is
happiness,-.this is security and peace! And why," she asked of
herself "should I not enjoy this peace, this 'security, this happi-
ness? What haye I done that I should deny myself to live? Am
I guilty of this crime-this shame? Is it mine? Am I not a
wretched victim only of the toils, and the arts, and the superior
powers of another? Have I, in my own soul, consented to this
surrender of my innocence to' the spoiler? Wherefore should I
suffer more? Rive I not suffered enough? Why should I not
be happy with him I love, true to him ever, and never willingly
false to Heaven or myself? It is a secret from all but one, this
shame that is my sorrow; and that one, for his own. sake, dare
not whisper it to the bird that flies! Alas! alas! my h9art,
whither would you carry me? Would you have me abuse
his noble trust for your pleasure? Oh! be still, lest in my

and heart, m the case of Olivia de Alvaro, is but begun. How
will it end? verily, there is very good reason why Don J3al..
thazar should be apprehensive. Truly, he knows, better than
his niece, how Ngreat is her weakness! But he will not leave
her wholly alone, to fight the battle with her passions. He will
frequently come mockingly to her succor, and, by torturing her
pride into passion, will seek to subdue the force of other pas~
sions. He has all the subtlety of the serpent: will he use it
successfully? It is very certain that he will spare no arts to
defeat the hopes of the two young hearts, who, but for his evil
working, had long since been rendered happy.

yond the reach of a good officer! See to it! This night is all
that is left thee to effect his capture, Half of these people will
be off to the country by the dawn; he, probably, among them.
Seek him at the tents and tables where they game. All of
his class have a terrible passion for cards and dice. At the cock-
pits he may be found. He hath possibly brought with him some
favorite birds from the country. He drinks, too, with a rare
passion, which will no doubt carry him to the shops where the
aguardiente is to be had. Get thee a dozen of thy fellows, well
counselled, who know the man, and set them on the quest for
him in all these phees. If you take him, you shall all be well re-
warded. If not, I shall endeavor to find officers who need no
exhortation to their duty. There is no reason why he should
not be found. He showed himself quite freely and fearlessly at the
bull-fight, relying, I suppose, on certain changes of dress and
costume. He is hardly in hiding any where, and, while in
Havana, will no doubt be found at one or other of the places
I have mentioned. Stint not your efforts, nor the numbers of your
men, nor the needful money; and, if you take him, bring him to
me at "the Grove;" at midnight, even; so that ye delay
not after you have taken him. Enough! see to it, Diego, as you
would be s5e of my favors.
"Seijor, I will not sleep in this search."
"Good! to it at once, for he will doubtless soon leave Havana
for the mountains."
The Hidalgo separated from the Alguazil, and both disap-
peared from sight. Within the same hour Don Balthazar might
be seen riding, on a famous black charger, towards the retreat,
without the city, where the Seiiorita, his niece, maintained her
solitude. It was but a little before this, that the very outlaw,
the mestizo slave, Mateo, might have been seen, on foot, pursu-

keen sight and tenacious memory of Don. Balthazar. Of the
death of the old woman, Mateo had learned nothing until he
reached Havana, a few days before. But, in that time, he had
seen his sister, the sullen girl, Juana, on several secret occasions;
had heard all her tidings; had listened to all her complaints, and
had decided upon the course to be pursued for attaining all
necessary remedies for his own and her alleged wrongs. Of
these remedies w~ shall learn hereafter. We need not say, per-
haps, that he laug~ied at all the labors of his mother, in striving
to procure. his foi~giveness, ~is a fugitive slave. He was one of
those reckless persons, too savage for subjection, too indolent for
toil, who prefer to appropriate the labors of others to the exer-
cise of any of his own; and, by the strong .hand, or sleight of
hand, contrived to extract a very comfortable living out of a
world which he thought good for nothing else. Now that he
was in Havana, he was resolved to bring about the settlement
of all his affairs in that city; and his own and sister's accounts~
promised to employ him actively for a time. His old master
was his chief debtor; and, that he did not emerge from his bamboo
shelter, and insist upon immediate payment, while the knight
was passing, was simply because he thought it very possible that
I2~on Balthazar did not carry a sufficient amount in funds about
with him, to enable him to make satisfactory settlement. It
would have been, otherwise, quite as easy to spring out from his
hiding-place upon the Don, as, from the corridor into the bull-ring,
giving the coup de grace to El .Aforo! The knight was suffered
to proceed in safety to his house, whither Mateo followed more
slowly, and not until the darkness had fairly covered the hacienda.
We shall suffer several hours to elapse with out reporting their
events; but we must suppose that they have not been suffered
to pass unemployed either by the Hidalgo or the outlaw. Nay,
we beg to state that both parties have heen busy, though we do
not just now care to go into a narrative of their several doings.
Enough, that towards midnight Don Balthazar ceased from his
labors for the night; and in his chamber, with his dressinggown
about him, and his limbs released in some degree from the gar-

scrupulous exercise, and in their dying embers exerting a
and more evil sort of influence in consequence of their very 4e-
cay and feebleness. He knew, and felt, and reproached himself
at moments for his terrible abuse of authority and advantage
the case of his unhappy niece. He was sometimes made con-
scious of the awful spectre of his deceased brother, looking do~i~
upon him with loathing and anger, and the saddest reproach
his face; sometimes he fancied his voice in his ears, and at other
times he beheld suddenly, as it were, a glimpse of the fier e
visage of "the Biscayan mother" of Olivia, flaming with indign
tion, before his eyes. His conscience thus, at times, came to t e
assistance of his better reason, and filled him with virtuous res -
lution. But it is not easy for one accustomed for thirty yea s
to give the full reins to his moods and passions, to re-conqu r
them and recover the ascendency of thought and will over habi.
Habit is the most unbending of all mortal tyrannies, and the
better genius of Don Baithazar struggled, vainly against the 4..
petites which he had so constantly fed in its despite. And nob,
when some better feelings were endeavoring to assert themselves~
in his bosom-when a lingering feeling of commiseration for th~
poor child whom he had so cruelly abused had prompted him
reflections upon his own selfishness, which, seeking a m.omentar~
and even mocking gratification, was destroying the very life of~
hope in the bosom of the girl-destroying her peace for ever, anc~
all the gladdening impulses which make youth happy-he harden
ed himself against the kindlier impression by a recourse to soni~
of those hard philosophies, which, in his case, had already over~
thrown all the authority as well of humanity as religion.
"What matters it," said he to himself; filling his goblet with
fresh supply from the wine-flask,-" what matters it in the end~
These passions of love are in fact nothing but the caprices of
fancy; a brief space will reconcile her to the loss of this knight
of Portugal, whose youth, grace, and noble bearing are the only
attractions; when he has fairly embarked for Florida she will
forget him, and she will then remember me with as much tender-
ness as any other lover. She will feel that, though I have

treated, kindly, and without neglect, readily recon~Ale then
to the condition from which they cannot escape. She wi]

that tigress mother; and her eyes,4hough they ~till lool

yielding. Let me but baffle this knight of Portugal, an5
her wholly in my power. He must depart. She mus
his petition; and if not, then I must find a way to siler
forever."
Don Balthazar deceived himself in one thing. The r
of Olivia's present aspect was scarcely in proof that she ~
more reconciled to his power than before. We may say
place, that she was schooling herself to a more cunning ~
that she was opposing art to art, and was never more r
against her uncle, than at the moment when she appear
resigned to her fate. Her game was to lull to sleep his
by appearing more submissive. She was resolved to es~
his tyranny as soon as she might hope to do so with safe

definite and clear, and in the meantime, her policy wa~
and thus far evidently successful. Don Baltha~ar was

resignation, on the part of his victim, by which he hoped to en-
joy more easy triumphs.
As thus he lay, weaving conjectures, and hopes and doubts in he
most intricate meshes for his own fancy, he Was surprised by a sud-
den and most unexpected visitor. But it becomes us to speak of
the proceedings' of this visitor, before we formally introduce im
to our HidalgQ. We have seen that the fugitive, Mateo, was on
his way, pursuing a like rout~ with Don Balthazar, when the p~
pearance of the latter drove the outlaw into shelter. He saw s
ancient master speed forward, and followed him at his leisu e.
A little after nightfall, stationed in a lemon thicket near the dw 11-
ing, Mateo gave a signal whistle, and in a few minutes after, ~~as
joined by the servant girl, Juana. She was his sister; and, rude
and' sullen in her intercourse with all other persons, on him s~hc
bestowed nothing but tenderness and affection. Her whole de-
portment and character seemed to change on their meeting. ~e
clung fondly to his neck; kissed him repeatedly; called him her
dear brother, and' would have continued her transports, had me
not, with a sort of good-natured violence, 'shaken her off.
"That will do, that will do, Juana. There's no time now r
kissing and foolishness. I have come for work. What can e
done? Is there a good chance? Is there anybody in the hou e,
any man body I mean, besides Don Balthazar ?"
"No! nobody! There's my young lady, and the old houn~1,
Sylvia; and there's the cook and Pedro; but she's in the kitch eia,
and Pedro is gone off somewhere. There's nothing to prever~t,
now."
"Well, you must show me a way to get in, and come suddenly
upon the old woman. The master's in his room, eh ?"
"Yes, he's planning some more wickedness, all to himse f~

He's never unprepared for mischief; and if he sets eyes ci

"If I don't shoot him: but that's a game that two can p

try to do so. Do n't you fear. I have arms too, just as 'vi
he, and I know just as well how to use them; and I'm not
of his wickedness. I've got some of my own."
"And you will get all the things of poor mainmy'?"

It was in this way that the outlaw answered the entreati4

SYLvIA, that arch beldame, as Juana esteemed her, in th ov-
ereignty of her domain, below stairs, was, at this moment, the
enjoyment of her highest felicity. She had a good suppe be-
fore her; her toils of the day were ended, and she was co rat-
ulating herself upon the ease and security with which she uld
command all the comforts which were necessary to the cre t re.
Supper over, she would sleep, and the dreams that. uld
follow might reasonably be expected to be all very pleasan~ es.
But Fortune plays fine tricks with human securities, an the
Fates are always busy to thwart pleasant anticipations; m ing
no sort of difference between those of the nobleman and those the
drudge. Humble as was Sylvia s secret of happiness, it w des-
tined to disappointment; and care nQstled in the cup, the ate-
ful beverage of which she was about to carry to her lips, this
very moment, the cruel and capricious fortune, in the asp ~t of
the mestizo, Mateo, stood quietly behind the old woman, pre ared
to cast the sack over her head. Suddenly she felt a rude gripe
of huge, strange fingers about her throat, utterly denyi her

effectually shutting out the supper, and just as effectually s cutting
in all sound. She strove desperately to shriek, but the voi e died
away in a hoarse but faint gurgling in her throat. She was in the
hands of an adroit enemy. Mateo was dexterous in his ye tion.
He had enjoyed some practice in his outlawed life. The ~ es of
the old woman were soon enveloped in another bandage, d as

completely denied to see, as her mouth to speak or swallow. A
stout cord was then passed about her arms, and thus rendered
hors 'lit combat, she might be trusted safely. Every obstack~ was
thus removed from the way of the conspirators, and Mateo now
gave the signal for the appearance of Juana, who, till this mo-
ment, had kept in the background. She was not long in s~ow-
ing herself. Mateo, in the meanwhile, coolly took his place at the
table which bore the supper of Sylvia, and his appetite bein~ in-
vigorated, we may s4pose, by long abstinence and previous toils,
he proceeded to its demolition in a manner which would I~ave
shocked the true proprietor, could she have seen. She suspected
no doubt what was in progress, but there was no remedy. She had
to submit with as much resignation as she could command.
Meanwhile, Juana was otherwise busied .in making inquest into
the secrets of the prison-house. Mateo soon joined her, and the
leading purpose of the conspirators was soon made apparent.
There were closets thrown wide, and boxes torn open. All~the
goods and chattels, the accumulations of old Anita, to whichSyl-
via had so quietly succeeded, were brought out from their hid-
ing-places. One may conjecture the variety of treasures which
had been accumulated by both these ancient beldames, in- the
course of half a century of peculation. B~it the details must be
left to conjecture. Our purpose is not a catalogue. Mateo and
Juana were equally busy. The latter knew where to look, and the
former how to secure. His machete did good service in forci~ig
open boxes; and every sack whiclA could be found, was appro-
priated to the compact accumulation of the scattered treasures.
Slung upon the broad, strong shoulders of the outlaw, they dis-
appeared one by one; transferred, in brief space, from the house
to the adjoining woods, where, it seems, the mestizo haa season-
ably provided a sort of cart for their better conveyance to other
hiding~places. The work was done by a practiced hand, and very
effectually; /
Sylvia could readily conjecture what was going on, but she was*
only able to groan and grieve internally. She did not remain
passive, however, and rose up, blinded and muzzled, and cord~d

as she ~vas, with more than one effort to interfere. It was (
by one or two emphatic exhortations from the heavy fists I
outlaw, that she was persuaded of the better policy of submi I
without farther struggles, to her-fate.
Supposing this work to be fairly over, and Mateo in full
session of all his mother's chattels; perhaps of others also
which that amiable woman could never assert any claim, th~

household. His next work was with the master.

active, and most serenely secure in the possession of the m9st
teeming fancies, that Mateo, the outlaw, chose for appearing[in
the presence of the knight. Now, we must do the mestizo ~he
justice to say that it was no part of his design to disperse tue
pleasant fancies of the Don, or to overthrow the castles of delight
and strength which his imagination was erecting. To Mateo~ it
would be of no sort of moment, how wildly, or how pleasantly,
the knight might dream. He might smile contemptuously
upon such employment, but that he should deliberately set him-
self in hostility to the worker for their overthrow, is really not
to be thought of. Bad fellow as he undoubtedly was, Mateo
was not so malicious. He had very different, and more sol~d
purposes. If, in his prosecution of these, the dreams of Don
Balthazar happened to be dispersed, the evil was unintended;
and, we have no doubt, if properly apprised of what he had uh-
wittingly done, he would have expressed his devout contrition.
Certainly he little conjectured of what a golden domain he dis-
possessed his ancient master in the course of a very little spa~e
of time.
Mateo entered the apartment of the Hidalgo without disturl5-
ing his revery. He did not enter, after the fashion of ordinary
visitorss , through the door. Mateo was no ordinary outlaw. Not
that he preferred the more laborious process of ascending a
column of the verandah and climbing in through the window.
But simply because the door was bolted on the inside. DoA
Balthazar was a man of precautions-a politician who knew that
reveries were not properly to be enjoyed, unless with all reasons-
able securities first taken. That he left his window unfastened~

which opened upon the verandah, was simply to admjt the br eze,
and he never once fancied that his reveries could render him
oblivious to the approach of any less light-footed visitor. lie
was mistaken. Mateo made his way in, without disturbing his
sense of security. Not that he was not heard. Don Bait azar
was sejisible to the rustling of the orange-tree beside the v ran-
dah; he heard the branches scrape rather roughly upo the
column. But that might be occasioned by the puff of wind that
smote just then gratefully over his brow and bosom; a~d so
believing, his eyes were shut, and the thick volume of s~noke
went up from his cigar,~increasing in mass as the exciting yision
~of future lordships in Florida rose before his imagination.
On a sudden he was awakened to full consciousness. His
atmosphere grew heavier. It seemed as if his fancies founc~ ~some
obstruction, and could no longer spread their wings as fre4ly as
before. He felt as if there were some antagonist influence ~n his
sky, which had suddenly darkened all his bright stars. An~ this
consciousness certainly preceded the opening of his eyes.~ He
had not yet opened them, when his ears were saluted w4h the
tones of a strange speaker, and in language well calcu1a~ed to
startle and drive him from his world of visions.
"Well, I must say, your Excellency, that you are very com-
fortable here.''
We have preferred putting the patois of our mestiz~ into
tolerably correct language, taking for granted that the i'eader
will readily suppose that there were certain differences between
the speech of the outlaw and his superior. This will sufi~Ice for
expJanation. We have no taste for that sort of literature which
makes the vulgar speak viciously, when what they have ~o say
can as well be said in tolerable phrase and grammar.
Don Balthazar forgot to smoke. The cigar dropped fr~nn his
opening lips. His eyes enclosed. His head was partly ~raised.
Never did visage more express ~onfpunding wonderment. There,
quietly seated on the settee directly opposite, was the ~utlaW,
whom he had given it in charge to his alguazib to arrest. How

waiting? They had probably taken the fugitive, and were at
hand. All these conjectures, and many others, passed through
the brain of the Hidalgo in a single moment of time. But they
were dismissed as rapidly as conceived. The outlaw h4d no
appearance of constraint. He looked rather like a conqueror
than a captive. There were no chains about his body or his
wrist. Never sat mortal so perfectly at his ease, his great bulk
covering half of the slight cane settee of which he had taken pos-
session. There was a good-natured mockery, too, in his face,
that betrayed no sense of inconvenience. It was evident~ at a
second glance, that he was not only n6 prisoner, but not a~are,
himself; of any risk of becoming one. There was a great knife
in his belt, conspicuous, which the eyes of Don Balthazar fastened
upon. It was the very weapon with which the matador had slain
the bull. The Don began to feel uneasy.
"Who i~ that?" he inquired; though he need not have done
so; for he knew the intruder the instant he set eyes upon h~m.
"Don't your Excellency know ?"
"No !-who?"
"Your Excellency has a bad memory for old acquaintance.
Don't you remember Mateo, that once belonged to the estate of
Don Felix?"
"You?"
"Yes, Selior, the same! I was a bad fellow, you know, and
wouldn't work. Work don't suit me. If it hadn't been for that,
I'd have kept on the estate forever, for I rather liked the place,
and the living was very good. But it's too hard to have to work
for the bread one eats, and I always preferred to take it where I
could get it without work. I don't object to other people doing
all the work they can. It's necessary, perhaps ;--some mu~t do
it, indeed, where all must feed; but I am for leaving it to those
that like it. I don't like it, and as long as I can get my bread~
without digging for it, I'll do so."
" You killed Pedro Gutierrez'?"
"Exactly: because he would make me wt)rk! It was all his
fault. I warned him that I wouldn't work; that it didn't agree

brought it on his own' head."
"You are a murderer, and an outlaw."
"Good words, your Excellency,-good words! What's th~ use
0f fouling your Excellency's mouth with bad ones? I don't care
much about words at any time; but sometimes they make me
angry. I don't want to be angry now, as I'm in a special good
bumor, and there's no need to quarrel with old acquaintance. I
have not seen you so long that it does me real good to look upon
you. Your Excellency don't seem to be much changed. There's
a little more of the salt in your hair, 'your Excellency, and it
shows a little in your beard, now that you let it grow so long.
You should use some of our black root die, which will make the
hair as young as when you were only twenty!"
The blood of the knight was boiling in his veins. But he tried
to be cool, and with great apparent calmness, said-
"Do you know, Mateo, that if you are once taken you will be
garoted without trial ?"
"One must take the tiger, your Excellency, before you can
araw his teeth."
"But they will take you! You cannot resist a dozen men-.
a troop-an army. Now, I happen to know that you have been
heard of in Havana, and that the alguazils are in search of
you."
"Ah! well'! They will hardly look for me here, your Excel-
lency, and I shall not be here very long. I shall soon be off for
1~he mountains. Meanwhile, I must take my choice. Aighazils
~re very fine trencher men, but scarcely of much account where
the only feed is steel and bullet. I shall probably escape from
these of Havana."
"But what brings you here now?"
"Well, you're something concerned in the affair, though per.
haps you don't know it. I heard of the death of my poor
another , Anita -.--."
"Ah! y~s; true, s~e was your rriothe~."

"I rather think your Excellency ought to know, since you've
been promising the old woman to get me pardoned for a long
time past. I suppose you had good reasons for not keeping your
promise."
"Yes; your mother knew. I told her that no pardon was
possible until you should come in."
"Very clear, your Excellency; and' noW that Pve come in,
you tell me that t~he algua7ils are already looking after m~, and
that I shall be garoted if caught. How do the two stories tally,

Perhaps so; but it don't matter much any way. As my

"Property! Why, what property had your mother? She
was a slave I"
"Yes, by the laws, I know; but your Excellency knows I

"Exact~ly; I took possession just an hour ago. I tied up the

of her supper, which I have eaten. The goods I have carried* off
already, and the plunder, were worth having, I assure you. There
will be fine sights of treasure in the mountains when I get back."
The knight grew more and more uneasy. The cool insolence
of the outlaw was almost intolerable. He looked about him
with impatience, and his eyes turned involuntarily to the wall
upon which he had hung his sword and dagger. To his surprise,
they were gone. How had they been taken away? It was evi-
dent that Mateo had been in the chamber already that night, or
some emissary; and he found himself completely in the power
of the ruffian. Pon Balthazar did not lack for courage; but the
gigantic frame of his companion discouraged at a glance the mo-
mentary impulse which he felt suddenly to spring upon and
grapple with him; and he now gazed upon the person whom he
feared with an eye of vacancy. Mateo seemed to read his
thoughts. He had followed his glance to where the weapons had
been wont to hang, and divined his feelings. The outlaw laughed
securely, with a bold, honest chuckle of security and triumph.

the right work is not given him, and the right confidence. Now,
do you try me, and you'll see what I can do. Make me your

Rapid were the thoughts which coursed through the knight's
brain. The philosophy of the outlaw began to strike him favor.
ably. He reflected-" This fellow can be bought. He will do~
any service in return for these things. He will strike my foe,
as coolly as butcher smites ox; he will obey my finger with-

IT will not ~e difficult to conjecture what werethe terms which Don
Balthazar w~s prepared to make with the outlaw, or the character
of t e services which the latter was to ~render, by which to se-
cure the pa~do~ which he desired and the office which he claimed.
The night ~aw, in the appearance of Mateo, the means by which
to r lieve himself from all danger at the hands of Philip de Vas..
cons los. e was one of those persons who readily adapt the
tool o their uses which offers itself most readily to their hands;
and aw, at glance, in what way the outlaw could promote his
purp ses. e are not now to be told that he was a man of few
scru les wh n he was eager for his objects; his fears and virtues
equally faiii~g to suggest considerations of doubt to a very ductile
conscience. Strange to say, the conditions which he demanded
of the outlaw, were not so readily accepted by this person.
Mateo was tiot without his own rude virtues. He had been im-
pressed wit~ the knightly graces and ~yalor of Vasconselos-had
seen with d~dight his wonderful skill in the tournament, and had
hailed his ~uccesses as if he shared in them. Besides, he was
aware of th~ isolation of the Portuguese cavalier,'and well knew
the reluctance with which the Spaniards had acknowledged his su-
periority. iMlateo had too little of the Spanish blood in him to
feel with th m, and adversely to one whose isolation so much re-
minded him of his own; and he gave him his sympathies on this
account, as ell as because of his valiant bearing. But he was
a person in situation which did not suffer him to withstand the
tempter; a d, though slowly and reluctantly, he, at length, yield-

ed to the temptation. He was bought by the promise of' par.
to become the as-
don, and the hope of reward; and consented
sassin of the knight of Portugal. That night lie confided the
whole secret to his sister, Juana, expecting her to be gratified
with an arrangement which promised him security and trust, and
freedom to herself. But he was confounded to find that she saw
the affair in a very different aspect.
"Don't you believe Don Balthazar, my brother!" said the
girl. "He has some snare for your feet. It was because you
had him in your power that he made this bargain with you. He
keeps terms with no one; and I am only afraid that he throws
dust in your eyes, while he puts the alguazils upon your foot-
steps! Besides, you dc~&amp;t know what a noble gentleman this
knight of Portugal is."
"Don't I, then? Haven't I seen him with lance and sword;
on horse and foot; and do~i't I know how these Spaniards hate and
fear him? Jesu! It did my heart good to see how he carried him.
self ;-how he managed the horse and lance, and made the sword
fly, here and there, at every point in the heavens, wherever the
enemy attacked. Oh! but I do know him, and I was very loth
to promise to lift knife against his breast 1"
"And why did you do it?"
"Demonios! What was I to do? Here was my own pardon
offered me, your freedom, and the whole charge of the hacienda."
"You will get none of these! Don Balthazar means only to
betray thee. He wishes, no doubt, to get this knight of Por-
tugal out of his way; for there are precious reasons, my brother,
why he should fear the presence of the Portuguese. Ah! if thou
knew'st! But when thou hast done the service, then will he be
the first to denounce thee. He is a bitter traitor. His whole
life is a treachery. His heart i~ full of serpents. He has lied
tc~ thee with sweetness, and thou hast tasted of the sweetness
till thou dost not feel the poison! He is apoisoner! Ah! if
thou knew'st! Know I not that he keeps many poisons in his
closet? Did I not tell thee that our mother died by poison?

"A worn n! He might just as well have said that I did it,
or the Lady Olivia. There was none other to do it;. for Sylvia
came hither only after our mother was dead. No! no! Mateo,
he was the oisoner, be sure; and thou hast sold thyself to do
this bad 1na 's bad work, making the good man thy -victim, only
to feed on is poison thy sell; when thou little dream'st of such
danger !"
"Hush u ,child! He dare not deceive me! Let him try it!
Let ~ne but find him at his treachery, and I will slit his throat
with a whist e."
if e be not too quick for thee. I nothing doubt that
he will hay the alguazils upon thy steps before another day is
over."
"I shall eep mine eyes about me, girl; and, hark thee, I shall
hide here i tliese thickets, and thou shalt feed me from the
house. The will never dream of looking for me here. I know
the hours w en to steal forth, but hither will I come to sleep.
Dost thou hear ?"
"Yes! It is best, perhaps. The plan is a good one. But
thou wilt not kill this knight of Portugal to pleasure this bad
man?"
"It must be done! I will do as I have said; and if Don Bal-
thazar, then, does not as he hath sworn to me, I will cut out his
lying tongue, and he shall see me eat it ere he dies !".
We need ot farther pursue the conference, which ended in an
arrangement~ by which the outlaw, unknown to any but Juana,
was to find ~is nightly refuge, in the groves and harboring places
belonging tq the grounds of the knight's own dwelling, and be
supplied with food at. her hands. He was also to time carefully
his moments~ of sallying forth; and it-~was deemed only a proper
precaution that Don Balthazar was not to know where he har-
bored, or be permitted any knowledge of his movements; at all
events, until it was certain that Juana's suspicions were ground-
less.
This conference took place outside of the house, and among

* the thick groves by which it was environed. While it was in
progress, Doi~ Balthazar contrived to find his way into the do-
main of Sylvia, and free her from her unpleasant bandagings.
He affected great surprise at her condition, and gave her no clues
to the secret of it. Nor, while he was present, did she conjec-
ture who was the bold ruffian by whom she had been plundered.
But scarcely had the knight retired, when she received a gleam
of intelligence from a simple* discovery enough. The bandage
about her eyes was a scarf which she had often seen in the pos.
session of Juana-that, or one very much like it. Now, where
one is disposed to dislike, or suspect, the proofs rapidly accumu-
late. This discovery, though by no means conclusive-since the
ruffian might very well have caught up, and made use of; the scarf
of the innocent serving-maid-yet set the memories and wits of
old Sylvia busy. She saw the mystery at a glance. Was not
Mateo the brother of Juana ;-was not Mateo an outlaw ;-and
had she not heard that Mateo had been seen in the bull-fight,
and that her excellent master-ever to be honored-had actually
set certain alguazils upon his footsteps '~ Nay, did not Don Bal-
thazar, only two nights before; give her warning to keep a close
eye upon Juana, for that the outlaw, her brother, was at hand?
And, 0, shame to her prudence, had she not been t&amp;o careless
of this counsel; ~and was it not for this very incautiousness that
she had fallen a victim to the robber! Now it was that she
remembered the frequent stealthy absences of the girl at night-
her window open-her chamber empty-and a hundred other
matters; which, in her present keen suspicions, were proofs like
holy writ-confirmations strong-not to be gainsayed in any
court of justice.
Sylvia was resolved, in her suspicions. They were clear
enough as proofs, "And now," mused the sagacious old woman,
"how to recover my property-how to enjoy my revenges! I
see through the whole affair. Juana harbors her brother here!
Truly, a m~bst excellent notion, that of making the house of the
1*
most noble knight, Don Balthazar, the place of refuge for the

very outlaw whom he has sent the alguazils to find! But I will
be toQ much for them both-they shall see! they shall see !"
Her plan were soon devised, and the very next morning,
bright ~nd e rly, she sallied forth on some professedly innocent
pretences. e need not follow her footsteps, but content our-
selves with +eportingin brief; the object of her expedition. It
was to seek ~ut the alguazils-the chief of them, rather-and be-
stow upon him the benefit of her discovery. She made an effort
to see Don J~althazar, and to enlighten him on the subject; but,
to her surprise, he seemed to have left the hacienda after reliev-
ing her of her bonds. He did. not again, that night, occupy his
own chamber ; possibly, because of its assumed insecurity; and
during the day following, he did not re-appear. He was busy
in the city.
Meanwhile ~3, what of Olivia-the poor victim, torn by love on
the one hand, by a bitter consciousness of wrong and shame on
h
the other; .~.y passions which she could not control, by fears
which she d5ed not name; by vague, vain hopes, which fluc-
tuated in a ~ort of shadowy existence in her soul, keeping her
restless, dreaming of possibilities, and the most moQking fancies,
which left heY', half the time, in the greatest uncertainty of reason!
Bier health seemed to improve, however, and, though pale and
sad as ever, there were symptoms of better spirits and a greater
cheerfulness. Love itself was her only stimulant, while it was
also one of her most disturbing griefs. The image of Philip do
Vasconselos was ever present to her imagination, coming always
clothed with promise. The more she reflected upon the proba-
bility of his addressing her, the more she began to doubt of her
own strength to say him nay. But, even then, her conscience
smote her w~th the criminality of consent; and she would thus
sink back into hopelessness and sorrow. But why was it that
he came not? To this inquiry, which again suggested a painful
doubt of her conquest-painful still, though she had resolved to
reject his suit-her lively friend, Leonora de Tobar, brought a
sufficiently- explanatory answer. He was close in attendance
upon, and anxious for the safety of; his sick brother. Now, hew-

ever, that Andres was out of danger, Olivia might look to see
him soon. She spent that morning with the* unhappy damsel,
and her lively prattle alternately cheered and depressed her.
When she was gone, Olivia made her toilet with more than
usual care. Why? The words ot~ Leonora assured her that she
might surely look for Don Philip's coming soon-that very day,
perhaps; and it was with~an interest which the poor girl dared
not acknowledge to herself; that she arrayed her charms to the
best possible advantage; and gazed with a sorrowful sort, of sat-
isfaction into the mirror which reflected them to her eyes. Then
she sighed, with the sudden rush of her fancies from the seat of
conscience, rebuked by the stern judgment of that sacred mon-
itor.
"Wherefore," she murmured to herself; " wherefore this
beauty-this solicitude to appear beautiful in his eyes? Alas!
my soul; I cannot do him this great dishonor. I can never
doom his noble heart to such infamy as embrace of me will
bring I"
She sank away from the mirror-she threw herself upon her
couch, and buried her face within her hands. The next moment
the girl, Juana, was gazing upon her with a look of sympathizing
interest, which touched her soul, The girl looked into the cham-
ber only to disappear.
"Madre de Dios I" Olivia murmured to herself: "Can it be
that she knows-that she suspects ?"
And with the doubt, the apprehension grew to terror.
"I am at the mercy, 0! Heavens, of the meanest slave !"
The fear was followed by an agonizing burst of grief! The
day was one of perpetual doubts and apprehensions. But it
passed away without events. Yasconselos did not appear, as
Leonora haa conjectured, and as Olivia had hoped-and feared!
Her doubts and fears grew strengthened. If her secret was in
the possession of the slave, Juana, it was a secret no longer!
That it should have reached the ears of Philip, was her neW
terror! It prostrated her for awhile! Half the night was passed
in tears and terrors, which were so many agonies. She could

bear his loss-she coul4 be content to give him up forever-but
that he should know her shame; that his noble soul should be.
come conscious of the deadly stain upon hers-that she could
never bear, ~nd live! She prayed for death. In her secret
thought arose a vague feeling, which brought, and commended
to her, the fatal poison, with which, unwittingly, her hand had
bestowed death . upon Anita. Were there not other drops of
silence, and sleep, and safety in that fat~d phial? Where was it?
She would look for it~! She would find it, and at the worst, she
would sleep; and all these terrible agonies of thought would
have an end I In the deep stillness of the midnight hour, the
unhappy damsel resolved on suicide. But there were other
drops of bitterness in her cup of misery, which she was yet to
drink to the dregs. Let us not anticipate, but follow the fortunes
of other persons of our drama.
Sylvia had made her way to the alguazils, and had put them
in possession of all the clues which she had procured, leading to
the pathways and hiding-places of the outlaw, Mateo. Once
roused to suspicion, she had found numerous reasons for con-
firming her in her conjectures. She noted all the outgoing of
Juana. She watched her with secrecy, and comparative success;
and though she di not see Mateo, she yet arrived at a very
shrewd notion of th thickets in which he might be found. The
hacienda which Do Balthazar and his niece occupied, though
* smaller than the est te which he cultivated for her, was yet one
of considerable rang in grove and forest. It had numerous dim
avenues of shade an silence. There were solitary walks which
no one frequented. here were hollows among the wooded hills
which might have harbored a hermit. It seems that Mateo
knew the place. 'H possessed himself( of its various haunts;
and, but for the too ager desire of Juana to seek him out, and
be with him 'i~rhen t ere was no necessity for it, the old woman
would probably nev r have gifessed his propinquity. had the
girl been content to seek him only at night, and to carry him
food but once in the wenty-four hours, and then under cover of
the darkness, he had een safe. But the girl loved her brother,

and was very proud of his prowess. Besides, after the death of
Anita, she needed the solace of association with the only kinsman
left her. She gratified this desire, and sought to gratify him,
twenty times a day, perhaps; stealing forth with Ifruits and deli.
cacies, with nice morsels from the kitchen, and with an occasional
wine-flask, or the remains of one, whenever she could appropri.
ate it with impunity. But the eye of Sylvia was upon her; and
she noted the direction taken by the footsteps of the girl. It was
surprising with what correctness she conjectured the harboring
places of the fugitive, from these observations, and her own
knowledge of the grounds. She put all her clues into the keep.
ing of the alguazils. The result was, that before sunset, some
half dozen of them were quietly skirting the hacienda, divided
into two parties, and gradually contracting their circuits about
the suspected place of refuge.
Mateo, meanwhile, never dreamed of danger from this source.
It is true that Juana had her doubts of the good faith of Don
Balthazar, and labored to inspire him with similar doubts. In
some degree she succeeded, so as in fact to make him circum-
spect as possible. But the great gain of security, of freedom,
and high trust, which the Hidalgo had promised, were considera-
tions quite too grateful and tempting not to prevail in the argu-
ment addressed to the confidence of the outlaw; who, besides,
seemed to understand very well why the uncle of Olivia should
desire to get Don Philip de Vasco~nselos removed from the path.
It was nZt with any satisfaction that Mateo contemplated the
duty assigned him. He would rather have killed any two other
men in Havana than this one Portuguese. L~ut, as he said,
"What am I to do? I can't be a fugitive always, flying for safe.
ty; and to be my own master is a great deal to one who don't

others to do the thing which I don't like to do myself, is certainly
very pleasant! Besides, if I don't take the Portuguese in hand,

the modesty of his character could not be deceived on a subject
on which the common voice of society allowed no doubts, and he
was resolved to bring his own doubts, if any, to a close, as soon
as possible, and terminate a condition of suspense which had
many vexations. But, whether he should address Olivia that
evening or not, was to depend upon his reception, her health? and
other circumstances which need not b9 mentioned. Enough,
that he is at last on his way to her hacienda.
He had just entered upon the estate, and, with slow step, and
musing spirit, was penetrating the avenue of great trees which
led to the dwelling, when he was startled from a pleasant revery,
by a sudden outcry from the depths of the thicket on his right.
There were clamors, as of threatened violence; the shouts of man
to man; a rushing and crackling afriong the shrubs and branches
of the wood, followed by a fierce, wild, savage oath or two,
which came very distinctly to his ears, and which declared for
angry passions ready to do mischief. The suit set. The in-
terval of twilight is brief in that region. A sudden glory suffuses
the sky, as the great eye of day is about to close; the glory
disappears, a faint misty light lingers in the sky; which gradually
deepe~is into dusk. Such was the hour. The dusk was nearly
darkness in the wood; and, for a moment, Don Philip could
see nothing, though he impulsively took a few steps into the
thicket in order to trace the secret of the outcry. He was not
left long in doubt. Suddenly, a gigantic figure, that seemed to rise
from the earth where he had fallen, bounded close beside him.
He was followed by ,three others, who now rushed out of the
wood and made after the fugitive, armed with swords and knives.
They were close upon his heels, and he turned about to confront
them. Three upon one! The struggle was too unequal. The
chivalry of Don Philip was aroused as he beheld. With the natu-
ral impulse of a brave man, sympathizing with the weak, he
drew his~ sword, and threw himself in the way of the pursuers;
the outlaw, for it was he, being some twenty steps in advance.
"Stand aside I,' cried one of the alguazils, who seemed to be
the leader :-~" we are officers of justice."

nations with the Adelantado, and how small his popularity with
the Spaniards at large.
"You are right," said he to the officers; "I have nothing to
do with this business !" and he turned aside, and put up his
weapon. The alguazils started again in pursuit. A shrill whis-
tle sounded from the opposite quarter. It was the signal of the
other party in search of the fugitive. The outlaw was between
two squads of enemies, and he hounded away to the covert, both
parties after him. For several minutes, Don Philip listened to
their outcries, as they severally crashed their way into the
thickets. He half regretted that he had not still farther delayed
the chase after the bold outlaw. In a little while the sounds
ceased. The alguazils were at fault, bewildered in the wood;
and the fugitive laughed at them securely in its deep recesses.
But, of this escape, ~Philip knew not at the moment. He re-
sumed his progress towards the dwelling, his mood having be-
come somewhat sterner by the momentary excitement.. Hardly
had he advanced a dozen steps, however, when he encountered
- the girl, Juana, wringing her hands, and showing many signs of
terror.
"Who is this ?"
"Oh! Seior Don PhiPp, how I thank you! You have saved
my poor brother. They will give him to the 'garote vii, if they
take him; and it is I whc~ have betrayed him."
"You! Are you not 4ie girl, Juana, belonging to Don Baltha-,
zar de Alvaro ?"
"Oh! not to him, but to the poor young lady, the Se~iQrita
Olivia'?",
"And he is y ur brother? And why do they pursue him l
What has he don ?"
"Oh! nothing the world, Seilor; nothing in the world; only
he is toL good to o work at- th~ hacienda. They charge him with
murder and other things. But it is not true. He is the best per.
* son in the world, eflor, and the best brother, and he killed the

Paul himself, if ey'd only let him have his own way.".

matter for future revelation. Philip de Vasconselos turned away
from Juana, and fr9m the hacienda, and with a parting word of
kindness to the giVl, slowly took his rout9 back to his lonely
lodgings.

There are some agencies which are indescribable; beyond which
we may not go-beyond which we may not see-over which the
curtain drops of itself, and which we thence only venture to con-
template through n~eans of conjectures, which still, for the sake
-of humanity, imply uncertainty. We give to the sufferer the
benefit of the doubt, and in some degree feel a relief from having
done so. It is a relief not to believe too much. We prefer to
suppose that the vitim has some alternative by which to escape
from a situation the agonies of which are too exquisite for en-
durance.
How, in what gloomy wakefulness, and torturing thought,
Olivia passed the night, we shall not pretend to describe. Nature
at last, in her utter exhaustion, compelled thought to silence. She
slept, but not till a very late hour. It was midnight when Don

immediately proceeded to assure herself that her door was fas-
tened. The secret 4oor leading to her chamber, of which she only
*    recently had knowledge, she also contrived to provide against by
a heavy piece of furniture, which promised to render it unavail-
able to the intruder. This done, the eyes of the damsel' grew
weary, and after a sobbing prayer, she soon sank to slumber. She
slept late the next day, and was awakened by Juana tapping at
the entrance. Don Balthazar had already departed for the city,

the outlaw to assassinate. In veply to the eager and apprehensive
inquiry of Olivia, she professed not to know. But Olivia knew.
Her instincts readily divined the secret, as she, better than any
body else, knew well what were her uncles necessities and danger,
and how naturally he regarded Philip de Vasconselos as his worst
enemy.
"Holy Maria !" murmured the poor girl to herself: Will
he murder him because he hath destroyed his hope as well as
mine! Oh! surely, I must do something here 1',
Then aloud, to Juana, she said-
." But your brother will never do this horrid deed, Juana ?"
"No! no! Seiiorita; not now, I'm thinking. He might have
done it yesterday, perhaps; but now, when he finds that Don
Balthazar keeps no faith with him, and puts the alguazils at his
backjust as he has made a solemn bargain with him before the
angels,-.Mateo will never trust him, or work for him in any
way.~~
"Hear me, Juana! I will give Mateo and yourself freedom.
It is to me you belong.-."
"Yes, S efiorita, to be sure; but you are not of age yet, you
know, and your uncle is your guardian till then; and he-"
"I know all that, Juana; but do you and your brother serve
me faithfully-do all that I shall require in the~ meantime, and I
will provide that you shall both have your freedom as soon as I
am of legal age. Meanwhile, I will see the Lady Isabella, who
is very kind to meand through her I will get Mateo's pardon
for the crimes of which he has been guilty."

"He did not come !" was the answer, in sad tones.
"That is certainly very curious. He told Nuno that he would
visit you in the evening. That was yesterday morning. Nuno
spent the morning with him, and said he was in the greatest
spirits; that he did nothing but talk of you, and of your beauty
and sweetness, and grace and innocence !"
"Ah I" exclaimed Olivia, with a sudden flushing of the cheek,
while she pressed her hand .upon her side as if in pain.
"What is the matter? Are you sick ?"
"A sudden pain I,'
"You have these sudden pains too frequently. You keep too
much at home. Home always fills me with pains. It don't
agree with the health of any young woman not to go frequently
abroad, where she can see and be seen. That's what I tell Nuno
when he wants to quarrel with me for going out so much.
Though, in truth, I do not go out so very often. I visit nobody
but you, and the Lady Isabella, and Donna Vicente de Ladrone,
and the Sejioritas Guzman, and dear little Maria de Levoine,
and Theresa Moreno, and a few others. But I tell Nuno that it
is not for the love of it that I visit; it is only for my health. I
should have just those sort of pains that trouble you, if I did not
show myself everywhere every day; and I tell Nuno I am not
going to make myself sick by minding what he says. Oh! he's
like, all other men, and would be nothing less than a tyrant if
I'd let him. And do you be warned in time. When you marry
Don Philip take your position firmly at the outset; and seize
the first opportunity of putting your foot down so-and saying,
"Twont do, Don Philip! You are quite mistaken in your wo-
man. I am my own mistress, Don Philip, and if you were a
wise gentleman, and a gallant, I should be yours also!' That's
~~hat you must say and do, Olivia, if you'd be a free woman
and a ruling, happy wife. It's the only way !"
4nd she stamped very prettily, with a properly graceful em-
phasis, with her pretty little left foot, and tossed her tresses with
the air of a sultana. But Olivia only smiled sadly in reply, and
shook her head.

li~ fact, ,Olivia, I half suspect he likes you better, as a woman,
than as a niece, and would rather not see you married to any-
body."
Olivia started at this random shaft; rose from the settee; and
with staring eye and flushed cheek, gazed her answer; vague,
wild, utterly unmeaning, as it seemed, to the remark of Leonora.
"What! dear child, another of those cruel pains? I must
send you some famous drops I have. Sit down again! Lie down,
Olive, dear. I can speak to you just as well when you lie as
when you sit. There, rest yourself for awhile. Poor, dear
creature, how your cheek pales and flushes, in an instant, and
what an odd look you have in your eyes! You must take some
of my drops, and take more exercise, and take advice, Olive, and
what's more and better, take Don Philip. Oh! he will cure you
of all these infirmities. That's the good of a husband! Now
don't be looking so woeful and low-spirited. Positively, there
are big tears in your eyes! What have I been saying to make
you so sad? I'm sure I meant to be very lively and very good-
natured, and to tell you only su~ch thii~gs as would please you.
By the way, something odd of your Don Philip. You must
know that he has the most eccentric tastes in the world. What
do you think? He gave Nuno a commission to buy him a negro
boy, a sort of lacquey, fifteen or sixteen-a lad to go on mes-
sages, and polish his armor, and help lace him in it, and perhaps
dress his hair-who knows what sort of duties the page of a
young gallant has to perform? Well, Nuno, who knows every-

influence which possessed her, and which she persuaded herself
was due to the heat of the day, and the' absence of the freshening
breezes of the sca. She had disposed herself on the settee as for
sleep, when Juana reappeared, much flurried and exhausted.
She had failed to find h~r brother, after a long and very fatigu..
ing search in all the well-known places. It was probable, so
Juana thought, that the late pursuit of the alguazils had driven
Mateo from the estate. We, however, knew better. He had
simply found it necessary to shift his quarters, and to exercise a
little m4re caution. He may have temporarily left the grounds,
but he did not abandon them. In truth, to state a fact which
poor Juana did not conjecture, he found it necessary for his own
safety to elude her search. She it was, who, with a foolish fond.
ness, had brought old Sylvia and the alguazils upon his track. He
kept from her sight, and changed his ground at her approach.
The girl was very much troubled by the failure of her search.
Olivia might have felt and shown quite as much concern on hear-
ing her report, but for the torpor that had now seized upon her
faculties. She repeated her commands to Juana to find her
brother, and arrest his knife, in so many murmurs.
"It is very warm and oppressive, Juana. We shall have a
thunder-storm. I am very drowsy."
Juana shook her head. She ascribed her mistress's drowsiness
to a very different cause. She had enjoyed some of the experience
of old Anita, and she muttered to herself-" She has had the
spice 1', Aloud, she said,-
"It is warm, Seflorita, and close, but I don't think there will
be any thunder-storm. In a little while the sea-breeze will wake
up, and you will feel* better, perhaps."
"I will go to the summer-house, Juana, and take my siesta, if
you think there will be no thunder-storm. Carry my dress for
the evening over there, and my jewel-case. I will make my toilet
there. We need apprehend no visitors now until evening, I think,
and you need not disturb me until the proper time to dress."

exquisitely rounded, such as frequently distinguishes the figure of
the woman trained in a life of luxurious ease, and in that deli.
cious climate. She seems, at once, to sleep. Her eyes close.
Her s&amp;ise is steeped in oblivion. She dreams, yet she does not
sleep. She feels, but she is not conscious. Her blood stagnates
in her veins; yet it works potently in her brain. She is in a
morbid and unnatural condition. She is under the influence of
"periapts"-spells, which steep the sense in oblivion-in un.
consciousness of evil,-making the victim deaf to the very~ thun-
ders that roll above his head, and blind to the forms of terror,
or of danger, that flit before his eye. She has partaken of "the
insane root that takes the reason prisoner." Thc~ potent medi-
cine which now seals up her 'consciousliess was one of the se-
crets of her fearful uncle. She has suspected him ;-she has,-
as we have already seen, endeavored tq evade his arts; but they
have been~too much for her. She littk~ dreams that he possesses
avenues to all her hiding-places, keys of power to persuade to
yielding, every lock and bolt which she deems secure. At the
very moment when she fancied herself most safe, and was begin-
ning to exult in the conviction that she could baffle and defy his
arts, her strength failed her-her powers all frozen by his terrible
spells. Late that day he reached home and asked for Olivia. He
was told by Juana that she was in the summer-house-that she
slept. A knowing smile slightly curled his lip. Dinner was
served him in his chamber. The wine of Xeres sparkled before
him. He drank with the manner of one who enjoys a tempo-
rary respite from all the cares of life. He finished the goblet;
refilled it; finally emptied the flask, and threw himself into his
hammock, with a cigar. He smoked for a while, then rose, drew
forth another flask of wine, broached it and drank freely; finished
his cigar in his hammock, and after a little while, restlessly work~
ed himself out of it. His eye was humid, his cheeks flushed, his
steps uncertain.. He looked about him with an air of hesitation,
then repeated his draught from the flask, and, with a sudden im~
pulse, hurried out into the verandah, and down the steps into the
garden. The keen eyes of Juana followed him from below.

CHAPTER XXV.

"Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon."
MACBETH.
THE day had been one of considerable bustle in Havana, and
Don Balthazar had been very busy all the morning. Juan de
Anasco, the contador, a brave, choleric little fellow, who united
all the qualities of the soldier, with the experience of the sailor,
had been a second time dispatched to coast the shores of Florida,
in order to find a proper harbor to which the expedition might
sail direct. He arrived the previous night, after a protracted
voyage of three months, during which great fears were enter.
tamed that he had been lost at sea. His escape had been a nar-
row one, and it will illustrate the superstitions of his time and
people, to show how he returned thanks to Heaven for his resto-
ration and safety. In fulfilment of a vow, made at a moment of
extreme peril, he and all his crew, the moment they reached the
shores of Havana, threw themselves upon their knees, and in
this manner crawled' to church to hear mass. Then lie made
his report of disasters and discoveries, and described a secure
harbor which he had found in Florida. The armament of De
Soto had been nearly ready for several days before. It needed
now but little further preparation, and waited, in fact, but a fa-
vorable wind. The report of Anasco stimulated the industry of
all parties. De Soto was impatientto depart, and his desires
were so many keen spurs in the sides of the lieutenants, keep-
ing them incessantly employed. Don Balthazar, as we have men-
tioned, had been very busy all the morning, and hence, perhaps,
his rather free indulgence in the pleasures of the wine-cup after
the toils of the day were over.

should I do at this supper? I shall not be a favorite, if present.
I shall win none of Do Soto's smiles, and, in truth, I care not to

when audacity and pride go forth.
The delicious softness of the hour sunk deeply into his soul, as
Philip de Yasconselos passed into the shady and silent defiles
leading throughh the thick woods which girdled the hacienda of
the lady of his love. The sWeet light from the slant beams of
the declining sun flitted from tree to tree before him, like the
butterfly wings of a truant fancy. The bright droplets fell,
here and there, through the groves, lying about like eyes of fairies,
peering through the thick grasses along the slopes. Philip's
heart was fairly open to fairy eyes. His soul warmed an was
thawed beneath the spells of that winged and fanciful su light.
He had thrown aside all the restraints which held him in eck,
through policy when amid the crow~. Here was solitude , and
silence, and the shade ;-~----and the pathway led to love; ai the
smiles of heaven were upon his progress! His step wa free
as air; his soul buoyant with hope! He would soon fe t his
eyes upon those precious features of the beloved one, rhich
seemed to them to make a heaven of the place where t y in-
habited! And the great shadows gathered behind hin~i as he ent;
and the trees grew motionless; and the woods ceased to b eathe
and murmur; and the silence deepened; and the pathway dark-
ened; and all was harmony and security! These tran itions
increased the sweetness of the scene, and as the glances f the
sunlight grew less frequent, they seemed.brighter, and soft , and
more tender and touching in the eyes of the lover. Phili went
forward, meeting with no interruption. He passed from p. hway
to pathway along a route well known. The avenues wi ned:
he was approaching the dwelling. In a few moments he ould
be in the sight, would be at the feet of her, upon whos word

delivered to despair. There was no ref~igc for hope in thought,
and he lay brooding, with an aimless mind, and an agonized
spirit. At last, he rose. The strong man rarely sinks below a
certain point. He may be overwhelmed, like the weakest, by a
shock, at once ter~7ible, revolting, and unexpected: but the heart
gathers its forces aftei~ a season, and nature compels the proper
efforts for her own recovery and repose. The grief may remain,
but it does not o~crcome~ It may prove a lasting blight to the
hope, the fancy, 1~he affections; but there is a calm resolution
which enables th~ sufferer to live and to perform; for perform-
ance is, beyond a~l other things, the natural law, and the neces-
sity of th&amp; true -ian; and even the sorrow, which wounds and
blights the heart, ~serves to strengthen the noble courage and the
indomitable will. Philip de Vascon~elos rose from the earth
at last. He had become somewhat more composed. iHis will
and character were beginning to assert themselves. He was still
the master of himn~elf/ He rose alid! went forward, sadly, slow-
ly, but resolutely; endeavoring, with all the calm he could com-
mand, to shape the course for his progress in the future. This
was soon decided in his mind.
The lights of the city grew before his eyes. The torches and
camp-fires, along ~he hills that skirted the city, became mqre
glaring, and cast their great red shadows upon his path. Tihe
voices of merriment, the songs, the shouts, the joyous crh*s a~id
laughter, with the tinkle of pleasant instruments, became louder
and more frequc~1t on his ear. Suddenly, his eye caught a
glimpse of the bug, temporary structure, of poles, covered with
palm branches, a d the broad leaves of other trees, in which the
knights were reve ling at the last festivities of the Adelantado.
"What            murmured Philip, "but that I go with thk
expedition? Wh~it matters it to me, now that I am no favorite?

Under this new impulse, he hurried forward rapidly
the scene of festivity, as if fearing to trust himself to think
upon the subject of his progress. It'was not long b~

The structure in which the Adelantado and his Floridi~an
held their feast was, as we have said, a rude, simple 'faI~
signed only for the temporary purpose. It consisted
shafts, green trees freshly cut and thatched with bam~
- fresh bushes. It was fantastica~lly adorned in a style w~
climate and productions of' the country naturally suggest
eye of taste. The flag of Spain, the banners of De Sot'
the several captains, were disposed happily around th
ment. Green leaves and gorgeous flowers were wreath
the columns, declaring visibly the wealth of the delicioi
~of which they were the natural tribute. Fruits in' gay
hung down, within reach from the rafters: the luscious~
mellow banana, the juicy and fragrant orange. Of th(

inc than for us to describe. Enough that the Adelantad

soup,-a first course, whiqh was served~p in the uncouth mon-
ster's own, shell; game and domestic poultry, including doves
from the c~te; young peacocks, their plumage artfully disposed
about the birds fter they were made ready by the cook for the
table, so as almost to represent the living creature, his gay
streamers of green, and purple, and gold, looking as bright and fairy
like as when he unfolds them to sight, strutting and spreading
himself abroad from court and verandah. Some dishes were pre-
pared formed wholly of the tongues of singing birds; and we
may add, were eaten with an appetite such as might be assumed
to originate only with a hope to win the musical powers of the
member thus hushed forever. The unripened plantain was
sliced and browned in sugar by the fire;. or, roasted, was macer-
ated with the inspissated juices of the cane. This course, by the
way, was preceded by one consisting wholly of sea and shell-fish,
and was succeeded by fruits of more than twenty kinds, all na-
tives of the island. 'Fresh guayavas, fragrant ananas, bananas
and sapadillos, yielded themselves to delighted palates in deli-
cious sympathy with wines of' Xeres, which had already began to
circulate with potency before Philip de Vasconselos entered the
assembly.
He entered at a moment when De Soto was addressing his
audience. The Spanish language is one of equal grandeur and
beauty; the Spanish character is necessarily one of ambition and
hyperbole. The language of a people usually declares for its
character in its best days. We know from other histories how
a language may exhibit more vitality than a people; how glori-
ously it survives them. A language, known through its literature,
is perhaps the only durable monument of a people. Dc Soto,
as' is well known, was an accomplished cavalier, greatly distin-
guished at a period when Spain could claim a host of heroes. It
is not so well known that he was an accomplished speaker,
thoroughly master of the arts of language, versed in its delica-
cies, and practised in ~ll its graces. His audience listened to him
with ecstasy, and rounded his sentences with their vivas and

scarcely acknowledged, with a stately bend of the head, the
measured but courteous approach of our hero, and the deepening
shadows upon whose~ brow argued o friendly welcome for what
he might say.. But Philip was little oved by these unfriendly au-

had been assigned to the Adelantado, raising him a little above
the re~t of the assembly,-.passing through the crowd with exceed-
ingly deliberate pace, until he stood but a few paces from the
person he addressed.
"Your Excellency," said he, "has been pleased to indulge in
certain remarks of censure upon that unambitious, unperforming
and timid class, who, bred to arms, are yet reluctant to engage
in the honorable adventure to which you invite them. I cannot
deceive myself as to the fhct, that certain in this assembly
are disposed to make these remarks applicable to the person
who now addresses you. I trust it is not necessary to say
here that for any one who would impute to me the want of
courage, I have but a single answer, and that lies at the point of
my weapon; be it lance, or sword, battle-axe, or dagger. I am
ready to enconuter any questioner. That I have been slow in.
resolving to accompany this expedition, has been no fault of
mine. I came hither from my own land for this very purpose;
and until I reached havana, I knewno disposition to change my
determination. It will be admitted, I think, that the encourage-
ments offered to me for this adventure, however, have been very
few; and, perhaps, were I to say the truth, I should describe the
course taken with me as designed specially to rebuke the pre-
sumption which had prompted me to seek a place under the
banner of Castile."

"Not so, Sefior, not so, by God 1" exclaimed De
rupting him energetically.

them. Such was their reconciliation. The speech of Philip had
taught Andres-strangely enough-that the passion of his brother
for Olivia de Alvaro had proved as fruitless as his own. Why?
This was the mystery which none could solve. Philip tore him-
self away from the brief embrace, and was hurrying out, when
Nuno de Tobar rushed up, and, warmed with wine, caught him
exultingly in his arms.
"But how is all this, Philip V'
At that moment Don Balthazar de Alvaro suddenly entered,
and was passing very near them. Instinctively, Philip grasped
the handle of his sword, and his eyes were fastened upon the
uncle of Olivia, with such an expression as made the latter start,
as at the approach of a famished tiger. Philip recovered him-
self in a moment, turned away from the face of him whom he
longed to destroy, and was followed out by Nuno int&amp;ihe open
air.
"Tell me," said the latter, "how comes this change ?"

an eternal barrier between Olivia de Alvaro and myself-aj.ar-

"TJe has discovered all !" was his secret thought. "Yet how ?"
Here was the farther difficulty. "What-was the discovery which
Philip had made ~' "To what degree was he com~nitted by it ?"
His anxieties increased with his unuttered inquiree, addressed to
himself But Don Balti~azar had a rare faculty of self-c6nceal-
ment. His secretiveness was a large development in his moral
orgai~~tion. He could smile, and look calmly about him, and
engage in the frivolous conversation of society,----jn all* the
business of the crowd-seemingly unrnoved,-while t~ie vultures
of doubt, and dread,~ and conscience, were all at work tearing at
his vitals. He joined in the talk going on in the assembly. In
this way he might obtain some clues to the secret of Philip.
But he learned nothing satisfactory. One fact, however, he
gathered from all that was said, which seemed to weigh upon his
thoughts; and that only related to the sudden appearance of the
knight of Portugal, at a late hour, in fact not many minutes be-
fore himself. "Where had he been till that hour ?" While ask-
ing huinself this q~iestion, Nuno de Tobar reappeared within the
circle. "I will sound him /" was the unexpressed resolution of
the Don, as he sauntered around, gradually winding his way
towards the place where Nuno had taken his seat. The counte-
nance of the latter was troubled. His mind was in some confu
sion, as well from the wine he had taken, as from the conference
with Philip. But the approach of Don Balthazar served, in sOme
degree, to steady his intellect, and make him cautious. He knew
that Olivia's uncle had bcen hostile to his friend. It had not es-
caped the notice of Nuno, that the glance with which Philip had
met Don Balthazar, but a few moments before, was that of a de-
termined, if not a savage hatred. Sympathizing earnestly with
his friend, Niino shared, in some degree, his hostile sentiments.
lie had himself never been the friend of Don Balthazar, ~nd
was now more than ever disposed to regard him as an enemy.
In some way, he felt assured that the present sufferings of Vas.
conselos, and his abandonment of Olivia, were due to the evil in-
fluence of her unefe.
Thus feeling, he was sobered by the approach of the Don;

It's that cross-grained uncle that she has. He has done it all. I
wonder what is the secret of his power over her. I'm sure she
hates him. But he rules her in spite of it - and he has compelled
her to refuse him."
"I don't believe it, child; for I believe Philip, and he positively
assured me that he tiad not asked her. He's not the man to lie,

was very earnest about it-very miserable,-.and entreated me
never again to speak to him on the subject."

has been mortified by refusal, when he counted confidently on
success. And I confess, I counted on it too; for though Olivia
always said that she would refuse him, yet I know that she loves
him desperately, and as she will love no other man. But it is all
the doing of Don Balthazar. He hates Don Philip-he hates
both the brothers-I have seen that a thousand times. But what
arc his hates to her,. and how has he succeeded in' making her sa-.
crifice her love to them? What is the secret of his power to
control her against her own happiness and will? That is the se-

"You are right, I suspect, in ascribing it all to her uncle.

"Philip de Vasconselos is like no other man, I know."
"Ah! you are mistaken. In some things all men are pretty
much alike; and in an affair of love-where there is real love-
your strong cavalier and stately Don are just as feeble as the
man of silk and velvet. You are all pretty much alike-all
easily overthrown-where women are concerned."
"It is a very strange affair throughout."
"I'll find it out to-morrow, if I live. I'll. see Olivia in the
morning, and she must have sharper wits, and greater strength,
than I believe, if., she can hide the secret much longer from my
eyes. You will admit that if Philip has seen her, then the prob-
ability is that she has refused him."
"He himself admits that he has seen her-seen her this very
day, but denies that he has spoken with her. The re is the diffi-
culty-that is the surprising fact."
"Seen her, but not spoken with her! You say he went to
see her, and did see her, but said nothing 'P'
"Yes; that is precisely what he asserts."
"Oh! he means no more than this-that he did not propose."
"It may be-yet he spoke very precisely and positively."
"Well, Olivia will be able to answer that. She will, at all
events, confess that there was an interview; though she may tell
me nothing of what passed between them. If she says so much
as that, you will readily suppose that Don Philip has simple
kept back something which his pride will not suffer him to con-
fess."
"Yes ;-though how to believe it of Philip-how to suppose
him so weak, or to think that he should keep back the truth from
me-that is what troubles me."
"Well, leave it till the morrow'!" said the wife.
With the morrow, eager to penetrate the mystery, Leonora
de Tobar prepared, at an early hour, to visit her friend. She
found, unexpectedly, the uncle and niece together. Olivia was
looking paler than usual, and wore an exhausted and suffering

whole extent of which, though, in her sane moments, she h~d
suspicions, she had really no conscious knowledge except by h~r
prolonged sufferings day by day. But, very soon, the conver~a-
tion aroused her. The daring Leonora, according to her ne~w
plan of operation, now addressed herself to the uncle. Turnh~g
to him very abruptly, and when he was least prepared for tI~e
assault, she said-.
"So, Don Balthazar, we are to lose Don Philip de Vasconseh~s
afterr all. The report is, that he joined the expedition last nigh,
after a very eloquent speech. But you must have heard it all,
and can tell us much better than anybody else."
Qlivia looked up with a wild and vacant stare, but the s~n~e
seemed to be slowly kindling in her eyes. With a frown, Do~i
Balthazar replied:
"I do not see what there is to tell. No more, it appears, tha~i
you know already. Your husband was present. He, perhaps ,
remembers the speech, since he regards the knight of Portugal
as something of an orator. Let him report it."
"Well, I suppose, after this, the fact may be held undeniable;
and now the wonder is why he should have left his purj~os.~
doubtful so long. Why, but a week ago, it was in everybody'~
mouth that he was not to go at all-that he had abandoned the
expedition altogether."
"Well, you admire him the more, I suppose, because of hi~
feminine caprices," was the surly answer.
"No, indeed, though I don't see anything amiss in caprices
now and then. They are rather agreeable, to my notion. But,
in his case, people found good reasons for his refusal to go; better,
indeed, than I can find for his present change of mind."
"AhI well! good reasons ?"
"To be sure! Very excellent reasons, Sefior; they gave him
credit for discovering more precious treasures in Havana than he
was like to find in Florida, and at less peril of life and comfort;
and these were surely good reasons for staying.~~

as her born guardian, and protector, and lover, and friend; and
if he wrongs her faith, he discredits himself; not her. That's
my notion in such cases. Don't suppose that you make me feel
at all uncomfortable by your hints; for I am willing to admit,
to all Cuba, that I was very weak, and very loving-too loving
to believe evil of the man I fancied! So now, Don Balthazar,
if it pleases you to talk of my affairs, I can't prevent you. It's
the fool's privilege, as you have just said, against which there is
no law, to say what one pleases of his friends; and you have
certainly the same rights as other people; but, in truth, if y~u
will ~uffer me, I will speak rather of Olivia and Don Philip, as
being just now' much better subjects, and about which I feel
much more concerned."
The little woman's good nature* actually endowed her with
wit and wisdom. Don Balthazar was quite astounded by her
audacity. She was invulnerable to his shafts. He looked up,
and glared upon her more savagelythan ever, but remained si-
lent; and in a moment after, seemed more than ever busy' with
his documents. But Leonora went on, and somehow, his in-
stinCts prompted him to listen. She might have heard from her
husband what the latter had withheld from him; and his doubts
had been by no means quieted by the reflections of the pa~t
night. Leonora now especially addressed herself to Olivia.
"I confess, dear Olivia, that I am surprised and disappointed.
I feel vexed at this strange determination of Don Philip, know-
ing that he loves you, and i~elieving that you love him, that he
should resolve to go without ~addressing you. But perhaps he
1w8 done so, and you have been so foolish as to refuse him! AIm,
my child, can it be possible?"
The sad eyes of Olivia, now full of expression, anticipated the
reply of her lips.
"He has not addressed me, Leonora; he has not even been
here. I have not seen him since the moment when I was taken
sick at the tournament."
"Is it possible'?"
"True !" said Olivia, very mournfully. "True!"

"No! I have not."

she somehow fancied would annoy him. When, tl~ereforp,

two days. He came day before yesterday, and was a

The gh'l hung her head and made no answer. Olivia turned
to Leonora.
"You say that Don Philip came here again, Leonora? Was
here yesterday?"
"Yes-so he assured Nuno last night."
"When? at what hour?"
"Last evening-about 'dusk."
"And saw me 9"
"So he said; but, strangely enough, he mentioned that though
he saw you, he did not speak to you. Yet he came to speak.
He came to offer you his hand."
Olivia pressed her hands upon her heart, with a look of inde-
scribable suffering. Don Balthazar arose, somewhat agitated,
and approached Leonora.
"You say, Sefiora, that Don 'Philip was here last evening?
Last evening !"
"Yes."
"And at dusk ?"
"About that time. He came hither about sunset. Nuno saw
him when he left his lodgings to make the visit, and he told him
all about it."
"And he saw me?" said Olivia. "Where was I?"
"In the summer-house, Sefiorita !" was the voluntary reply
of Juana, who had been eagerly waiting to speak.
"It is a mistake I" said Don Balthazar-" He was not here.
I tell you, Seiiorita, it is altogether a mistake."
This was said with a vehemence meant to cover an agitation
which the knight could not otherwise subdue. Olivia beheld this
agitation through the effort to conceal it. His asseveration went
for nothing, particularly as Leonora insisted that Don Philip had
declared the fact to her husband, only last night, and after the
former had made his speech.
"It is impossible !" said Don Balthazar, in a wanner meant
to silence all further discussion; but the malignant element in the
bosom of the slave, Juana, was not prepared to suffer him to

less.

"Oh! yes, Sefior; Don Philip was certainly here; at

"You, Selior !" cried Olivia, rising and striding~ acro

of mixed agony and horror.
"You !---you !-were you in the summer-house last ever

He was silent . . . . Juana supplied the answer.

She clasped her head with both her hands, and reeled about
dizzily. Leonora caught her in her arms in time to save her
from falling upon the floor. She was in a swoon! It came sea-
sonably to save her from madness. We close the scene. Let
us suppose that Leonora clung lovingly, and nursed heedfully
her suffering friend; and.that Don Balthazar fled from the pres-
ence which, with all his brutal heartle~sness of character, he dared
not face.

hatred which he felt for his superior. Don Baithazar was
not a timid man,~was not easily startled by any event or
presence,-and certainly had no fears of any individual foe;
but the appearance of the outlaw, so apropos to his summons,
brought up to his mind a vague image of the satanic presence,
which, in fact, was the, true meaning of his requisition. It is the
hellish agent which we summon always when we design a hellish
deed. Don Balthazar,, however,, welcomed the fugitive after his
own fashion, withe air of a master who knew his rights, and
had reason to complain.
"You are here at; last! But you have done nothing. You
promised finely! Where are your performances'? Had, you
done: according to your pledges, I had been saved from a very
unpleasant affair !"
"Had I done !-and who is to blame, I beg to know, that I
have not done'? You make a bargain with me, and when I set
about to do my work, I find your alguazils upon my heels.
Your alguazils, bearing your orders to seize and bind me, and
have me properly dressed for the honors of the garote vii! Ah!
indeed! The garote vii for your own ally-the man, who is to
risk his life doing your business! What do you say to that'?"

mistake, any day !"
"I tell you that the alguazils were ordered after you, before
I had spoken with you; I only forgot to see and speak to them,
and they continued the search in consequence. But I will put
a stop to their pursuit."
"Oh! you forgot only! But that was strange on your part.

not even my own. See this handkerchief; there are three knots
in it. Every one marks a life. This is one I put in it '~ hen I
engaged with you to send Don Philip by a short cut to para.
dise. You must knot your handkerchief too, before I tal e this
knot out of mine."
Don Balthazar received the suggestion rather literally He
coolly took out his handkerchief; and proceeded to knot I ; but
the Qutlaw laughed.
"Look you, Don Balthazar, the man who can't write, akes
his knot in the handkerchief; but that's not the rule fo you.
You must make your knot on paper, with pen and ink; and
there must be a great seal to it. Get me the pardon, und r the
hands of the Adelantado, for all past offences; that's on knot
you're to make. Prepare me the paper that proves mi and
Juana's freedom, and when. you give me these, I shall ta e out
my knot here, and Don Philip will fly off to join the an els in
paradise; that will save you from finding him in you way
hereafter."
And the fellow chuckled greatly at his own wit. Do Bal-
thazar was not so well pleased at these requisitions.
"But, when I have got you these papers, what security ave I
that you will do what you promise for me
"Security! Well, it seems to me that your security w~ill b~
quite as good as mine. What security do you give me, ~hen I
have slain Don Philip, that you will do for me what you~ hav~
promised ?"
"Slave! Do you count the word of a nobleman linda
soldier, as of no more value than that of a mestizo a~d an
outlaw ?"
"Pooh, pooh, Sefior; that sort of talk won't do between us!
It's you that are the outlaw, not me! I am to kill Don Philip
on your account, not on mine; because you hate him, anki not
from any hate that I bear the Portuguese. Were Ito kill h5m on
my own account, I should be outlawed: killing him for yo~u, it's
your act, not mine, and you're the outlaw! Don't speak 1~o. me
as if there was any difference between us. There's none; I tell
you, but what's in my favor! I think myself a much Vetter
man than you any way. I don't get other people to light my

Thus saying, he flourished his naked machete in fearful prox-
imity to the knight's face. The cheeks of the Don flushed crim-
son, and he hastily drew his sword half-way from the sheath.
"Oh! put up," said the outlaw; "it's no use-and besides, it's
not necessary. I'm not going to kill you; ,and if I were, you
could do nothing to help yourself. I wouldn't give you the
smallest chance. 4'd be into you, and through you, before you
could get your toledo out of the scabbard. I'm none of ybur
fine knights of Cast\ile and Portugal, to let you put yourself just
in your own attitude to fight; all that seems to me only foolishness..
Here'~ my enemy, and I'm to kill him. If I don't kill him, he
kills me. Now, I don't want to be killed, just yet; and I rather
he should die than me! What then? Will I give him a

'By your leave, senior.' And if it was my profit to slit yours,
I'd have done it. without all this palaver. Don't be afraid.
We're on terms. I've a contract with you; and I'm willing to
work for you, on conditions. But' you must get down from the
great horse when you speak to me. I can't bear to be ridden
over by any Don that ever came fr~m Spain! and I won't!
There now; you know me. Is it a thing clear between us '~
Will you get me the pardon, the free papers, with the big seal?
Shall I kill the knight of Portugal for you ?" -
"You're a bold fellow, Matco ;-.it's a bargain I"
"Very good. When shall I have the papers? I must have
them, to see, and to show; for I can't read, senior, and must get
some one to read them for me, to see that all's right, before I
do my share in the business.~~
"You are hard in. your conditions, Mateo; but you shall have
your own way. Meet me here, at this hour, two days hence,
and you shall have the pardon and the papers !"
"Good, senior; I'll be punctual to the sun."
When the two separated, the knight proceeded, almost imme-
diately, to take horse, and ride into the city; the outlaw disap-
peared within. the thickets. Don Balthazar did not return to the
hacienda that night. In his place, Olivia had another visitor.
While Sylvia slept, Juana conducted her brother to the chamber
of her mistress. The latter appeared. to expect him; she was
certainly not unprepared for his coming.
It was surprising to behold her countenance, as the bold out-
law entered the chamber. Where had she acquired that won-
derful composure-that strength of calm-so suddenly ?-.-after

the overthr w of her hope and pride, so terrible and so recent?
-after that wild compulsion which seemed to have racked
equally the body and the soui~, how had she so soon and
thoroughly recovered? In the utter wreck of her pride, her
sensibilities seemed suddenly to have become blunted. She
had the look of one who felt nothing. There was not in her
countenance the slightest show of suffering. Her eyes were
strong in their glare,-not sad. The muscles of her mouth
betrayed not the slightest emotion. She looked like one of
those wretched persons whom we sometimes encounter in society,
who grow prematurely wise-~-who never know youth or child.
hood-who spring, at a single bound, into manhood, and the full
possession of their minds; and who do so, in almost all cases
at the expense of their hearts-nay, to th~ utter death and burial
of their hearts! Such premature development always makes
monsters. The look of Olivia was that of one whose heart was
utterly dead within her, and who has survived and forgotten-if;
indeed, she ever knew-its loss. It was-to sum up in a word
already used-all stony! The calm wa~ that of death-the
composure, that of insensibility-not apathy! Yet there was
life in her. There was a new-born energy working within
her soul. That had survived the heart-had acquired its
strength-only in the utter annihilation of the hope, if not the
affections. These still lived, however ;-.--but in what manner?
We shall, perhaps, see-as we advance' but they were not now to
declare themselves in the ordinary way, as is the case with those
who do not live to denial-who still indulge, if not in hope; in
dreams-in delirium! Olivia had her purposes still; and, through
these, her lingering and blighted aiThetions were still destined to
exist, and work ;-but she had no more feminine emotions. The
blissful though deceiving reveries of her woman heart were all
at an end! There were now no delicious fancies, tripping, like
nimble servitors, in obedience to thought or will; bringing gay
colors, and creatures of the element, to beguile her saddened
moods. Fancy had been stripped of all -its wings---ruthlessly
stripped-and life now crept on like the worm deposited beneath
the precious flowers, to which it can no longer, fly. But the
worm still had life; and a will, which continued to incline in the
direction of its former fancies. Olivia de Alvaro, we .repeat,
has still a ~urpbse,-whether of hate or love we have yet to
learn! Enough, that it is the purpose of a broken heart,-well
knowing how complete has been its ruin,-how utterly hopeless
is its condition,-how dread its humiliation,-how unrelieved
by solace, whether of mind, or heart, or soul. She is without

aspirations; yct ~he has a purpose! And that purpose? We shall
see as we proceed.
Whatever it is, she pursued it with such energies as she has
never before displayed in the prosecution of any object. They
are such as might become the strongest-willed person of the
other sex. She bends her whole soul upon the task. She ex-
cludes all fears, all doubts, from consideration-everything
which may impair her efforts. Perhaps, we should rather say
that, feeling as she does, her souLis no longer accessible to fears.
She has endured the last sorrow, and the worst; and death has
no terrors, in a sea son, when life is not only without hope, but
without inspiration of any kind. She wrought, nevertheless, as
one dedicated to duty; as one, too, to whom the strength came,
physical and spiritual, only with the duty! An hour had made
her a new person; and, with the due consciousness of a fresh
impulse, she has no time for sorrows. Sorrows! IJiow should
tears, or wailing ,even, or prolonged watching, give testimony
to such a woe as hers! To have been capable of either would
have implied very inferior sensibilities, or a smaller degree of
heart and suffering!
A night of stunning ~nd strange sensations, that seemed rather
to afflict the body than the mind, and she stood up, a new being!
With the dawn she found herself employed,-active, watchfi4,
vigilant,-speaking few words, but firmly,-allowing no ques-
tions,-wiiing, and causing to be done, according to her will
Juana, now honestly prepared to serve, was put in requisition,
and kept busy. At night she was required, as we see, to bring
her brother, the outlaw, to the chamber of her mistress. When
there, the latter had few words, but they exhibited her in a
wholly new attitude, to both brother and sister. Juana she dis-
missed to irnother chamber. From Mateo, now alone with her,
she demanded an account of his interview with Don Balthazar.
He revealed its purport-all! Olivia listened without seeming
emotion. When he was done, she said:
"I have presumed on your fidelity, Mateo. You dare not lie,
to me! You will not! I a'm willing to believe you. You are
too much of a man to deceive me."
"By the Blessed Virgin !"-he began.
"Jt does not need, Mateo, that you swear. I will believe you.
You shall work for me, and shed no blood! There is your par-
don, which I have procured for you through the Lady Isabella;
and there is the paper, which makes you and Juana free people-
no longer slaves of mine. Take them, and then listen to What I
- would have you do."

YASCONSELOS.

The outlaw fell at her feet,-seized her hand, and covered it
with kisses. She withdrew it, indifferently, without emotion.
"Enough," she said: "Enough! How bug, Mateo, will it
take you to procure me a supply of the roots for making the
tawny brQwn dye of the mountains '?"
"1 can get you any quantity, Sefiora, in a short twelve hours.~'
"Be it so. You must set out for it as soon as I dismiss you."
Juana here peered within th&amp; chamber, but the lady motioned
her away, and then, in a whisper, gave Mateo some other inst rue.
tions. Her manner was calm, resolute, emotionless wholly;
her words clear, though whispered; her purpose made fully
evident to his understanding, though at present it is withheld
from ours. He argued with her purpose, but in vain. He
finally submitted ;-Juana was called in, and her brother hur..
riedly disappeared. He returned by noon of the next day, and
brought her the roots of a native dye, such as she required. He
had other trusts to execute, which kept him actively employed.
Meanwhile, Juana kept diligent watch. The espionage of Sylvia
waLs baffled; and, more than once during the day and night,
Mateo penetrated the dwelling in safety,-sometimes with a
package beneath his arm; sometimes with only certain tidings
on his lips. He wrought submissively, beneath a will which it
was neither his policy nor his desire to disobey. Meanwhile,
his eyes Illled, rough and savage as he was, as he gazed upon
Olivia, and remembered that it was by his agency that her~pride
had received its fatal blow-to say nothing of her hope-in the
terrible momemit when Philip de Vasconselos had entered the
summer-house. But he dared not make this confession.
"Yet, how could I help it?" quoth the outlaw, to himself; by
way of apology. "He had saved me, had served me, and was
a noble gentleman. Then, I knew her only as the kin of that
scoundrel, Don Balthazar! Yet~ I wish it had not been so
The regret was unavailing, but it strengthened the desire in
the heart of the outlaw to serve her faithfully in all things; and
it softened him to sw~vey her, so wholly .changed,-a woman no
j~nger,-stern, inaccessible, hopeiess,-having but one idea;
and that-he shrugged his shoulders as he thought of it.. But he
was forbid to argue it again.
"I have heard of such things before; but, after all, it's only a
sort of madness! She will break down in it, or break out,-and
that's pretty much the same thing,-and then it's. all over with
her! Oh! it is so pitiful! and she so young, so beautiful, and of
such a great family! Demonios! how I should like to cure
oil the trouble, if it could be done, by making . three cuts with
~rny machete on the black heart of that mQnster, Don Balthazar!

E de' mali ii timor~"
IT required, in fact, no effort on the part of Don Balthazar to
procure the pardon of Mateo, the outlaw, from the hands of the
Adelantado. He had only to place the paper before him, with
a crowd of other papers, f~r signature, and the sign-manual was
set down without scruple or examination. This was the usual
process. It was thus that, at the entreaty of Olivia, the Lady
IsabeJla had already procured the pardon ~f the mestizo; and
thus it was that the affair had escaped the knowledge of the
knight. In neither instance had De Soto been made aware of
what he had done, and Don Balthazar was thus naturally kept
ignorant of the peculiar interest which his niece had manifested
in the outlaw, and of her intimacy with him. He was utterly
without suspicion in this quarter; the consequence of his impres-
sion of her ignorance of affairs, and of her utter indifference and
apathy upon most subjects. The pardon procured, the Don pre-
pared the legal discharge~ of Mateo, and his, sister, from the ser-
vice of his ward. He signed the latter papers as her guardki~n,
and, as usual, without consulting her. The deed of emancipa-
tion which she had prepared was, in fact, void, in consequence
of her minority; and this was quite as well known to Mateo as
to herself. But it was understood between them that he was to
keep aloof until she should reach 'maturity, when he could boldly
defy the uncle. The parties did not. deceive themselves, or one
another; and though the discharge of Olivia was, for the pres-
ent, of less value than that of Don Balthazar, still .Mateo much
preferred to receive the boon at her hands, though of questiona-
ble validity, than to incur any obligation at the hands of a person
whom he meditated to murder at the first decent opportunity.
Armed with the desired papers, Mateo did not think proper to
keep his engagement with the Don. He was to have xIIet him
in the thicket, where we have already beheld their interview,
but the knight waited for him in vain; and' after lingering
for an hour, becoming impatient, he took his way towards
the summer-house, and thence proceeded to the dwelling. He
little dreamed. that the~person he hoped to see was closely
(860)

following nd observing all his movements. So was Juana.
Mateo ha counselled the latter carefully on certain points,
and the atch maintained by one or the other of them left
no single proceeding of Don Baithazar, when at home, unno-
ticed! hile at the summer-house, the Don had divested him-
self of the papers with which he had proposed to meet the out-
law. As i was in this neighborhood that ~he still calculated to
encounter im, he thought to have them always ready by leaving
them ther . He fastened them up securely in a huge chest
which he k pt in a closet. But Mateo, who watched all his steps,
soon wor ed his way into the closet and the chest. He was
armed wit a bit of iron wire, his machete, and a small drill and
mallet; an it was surprising with what rapidity he persuaded
locks to gi e up their secrets. Such is the advantage of being in
high practi e, wherever the arts are concerned. The worthy outlaw,
however, d d not immediately possess himself of the documents
of the Do . For the present, he was content to know where
they were idden. He preferred that their loss should not be
discovered until the last moment, when the Don should be
ready for departure to Florida, and he to his native moun-
tains. He had much yet to do in Havana, and did not care to
be disturbed again by the alguazils, while pursuing his pleasant
occupation He continued in the employment of Olivia; and~
her present purposes, steadily pursued, with a mind now pro-
foundly coi centrated on the one object, found him enough to do.
But there as a slight interruption to their intercourse. In car-
rying out h s purposes, Don Balthazar, as we have seen, had re-
solved to end his niece to the plantation,-the hacienda, or
country-sea of his ward at Matelos,..-.-.where her large estates
chiefly lay. This was in order to his own security. Her~, he
might best ractise against her peace-perhaps her life. J~iere,
she would e removed from frequent association with the I~ady
Isabella, w o had taken a greater interest in her happiness than
Don Baltha ar cared to see, or to encourage. She was to pro-
ceed thither under the conduct of De Sinolar, whose hacienda was
contiguous, and whom Don Balthazar was not unwilling that
Olivia shon d marry. De Sinolar was his creature,-silly crea-
ture, as we ave seen,.~-vain and weak,-who feared the Don,
~and whom he latter regarded as a useful mask to shelter his
own proceed ings. If she would wed with De Sinolar, she might
live; and t e latter was to be allowed every opportunity of
winning his ~way to her favor. Don Balthazar, however, had~ now
but little h~pe of this, unless through her utter despair of the
knight of P~rtugal, and the desperation of soul which his own

cruel conduct had occasioned. The expedition once departed,
carrying with it Don Philip, and. the uncle was satisfied to trust
somewhat to time.. Time might effect his object, and if not-.
the dagger! This latter remedy was to be~entrusted t6 Mateo;
unless, indeed, Sylvia should prove herself as expert with the
bowl as her predecessor, Anita, had been.
According to these plans, Olivia was suddenly apprised that
she was to travel that very day under~the escort of De Sinolar.
She was silently submissive. She was not allowed words of
parting with her friends, the Lady Isabella, or the fair, frail wife
of Nuno de Tobar. To this also she was reconciled. She had
no desire to see either. She had survived friendship. Mere
society had no attractions for her, and nothing compensative.
She lived but for a single purpose, and this was of a nature to
be rather helped than defeated by her removal from the city ;-.
that is to say, by her seeming or temporary removal. She was
prepared to go,-but her secret resolution was taken to return;
and that, too, before the sailing of the expedition. We shall see,
hereafter~ in what manner. Don Balthazar was rather surprised
at her submission. He -had expected a struggle. But she heard
his requisition with a cold indifference, and answered it with a
single word of resignation.
"I am ready now
He was surprised, and~ said something about her friends.
"Would you not desire to see and part with the Lady Isa-
liella,-with Leonora de Tobar?"
"No! What are friends and friendship to me
"It might be done in an hour. It were proper, perhaps."
"I do not care to see them."
"Well, as you please! You can see them as frequently as
you think proper after I am gone. Indeed, as Leonora will re-
main in Cuba, you might have her as your guest."
Olivia was silent. The uncle proceeded:
"De Sinolar has gallantly undertaken to be your escort, and
you can command his services during my absence, in any mat-
ter in which you may need assistance. He has kindly volun-
teered his good offices. I have given him instruction."
"When does the expedition sail ?" she coldly inquired.
"Within two days. We are all ready, and the wind promises
to be fair."
She asked no more.
"When we separate, Olivia, it may be forever! I go upon
an expedition of great peril. I may never return. Do you for-
give me, child?"

The hacienda o, Matelos was reached in safety about dusk.
Oliviapleading fa igue, dismissed Don Augustin to his Own

retired to her cha ber for awhile, but it was not long before
Mateo made his a ~earance. Certain signals, previously agreed
upon, announced h s arrival to Juana, and he was stealthily con-
ducted by that da sel to the chamber of her mistress. Olivia
was sitting with ha ds clasped, and eyes fixed upon a picture of
the Virgin which h ng upon the wall opposite, when the outlaw*
entered the room. She at once rose.
"You are true, Mateo, and I thank you. You musL now get
the. horses ready."
"Ah! my lady,'~ said the outlaw, "I have been thinking you
can never stand this trial. It is a hard life you propose to under-
take. You will never have the strength for it. You do not
know the toil, the danger. You will surely sink under it; you
will perish, and there will be no one to help you."
"I shall need no help, Mateo; and if I .perish, it is only an
end of a long and terrible struggle."
"But why engage in this struggle, Sefiorita? Of what avail ?"
"The easiest form of death is in the struggle, Mateo. Do not
argue with me now; I am resolved."
"But, I must argue, dearest mistress-I, who know what are
the toils of such a life, day by ~Iay, on the back of a horse."
"You forget, Mateo, that my father taught me how to ride;
that I have been a horse-rider from my childhood, over the rug.
gedest mountain passes. I fear no steed that was e~er bridled.
My poor father, you remember him, Mateo'?"
"Ah! my lady, do I not? Had he lived, I should never have
been a bad fellow; never been an outlaw,-never shed human
blood."
"Weff~ as he had no son, lie made a boy of me, and taught me
the exercises of boyhood. He showed me the uses of the match-
lock and the cross-bow, until I ceased to fear the shock and the re-
port of fire-arms, and could bring down the mountain eagle with
my arrows. I have grown into the \voman, but I have never lost
the spirit, nor the practice, which he taught me. Toil, trial, dan-
ger, have no fears for me. I am bolder and braver now than ever.
Do you have no apprehensions, my good Mateo; for there is that
in my soul now which makes me laugh at danger."
The outlaw continued to expostulate, when she abruptly and
sternly silenced him.
"Have you not sworn to serve me, Mateo, without question-
ing ?" she demanded, with an air of calm authority.

where the saddled steed was in waiting. It was an hour short of
midnight. The stars were few in heaven. The gusts swept, with
a sad soughing, through the woods, and seemed filled with mourn.
ful and warning voices. The ear of the outlaw was sensible to
the sounds, and his more superstitious nature held them to be
ominous. But Olivia seemed not to hear or heed them. She
wrung the hand of Juana in silence, leapt into the saddle, and, fol.
lowed by Mateo on horseback also, she turned once more in the
direction of Havana. Juana remained behind to plead the indis-
position of her mistress, and baffle, for awhile, the curiosity of iDe
Sinolar.
The wayfarers rode hard and fast. In a low and seemingly un-
occupied hovel in the suburbs of the city, we find Olivia safely
housed before daylight. The place had been selected and pro.
cured for her by Mateo, agreeably to previous instructions. There
was a rude couch, upon which she rested for awhile. But not long.
She was soon up and busy. Mateo was summoned, and was
promptly in attendance.
"Are all the things here, Mateo ?"
"You will find them in that box my lady."
"Have you prepared-"
"Every thing, Sefiorita. I have done all; I am ready for all
things: but 0! my lady, it is not yet too late."
"What do you fear, Mateo ?"
"Every thing for you, Sei'iorita-nothing for myself. Nay,
if you will believe me, I would sooner cut for you the throats of
a dozen such villains as Don Balthazar, than see you go on this
fearful business."
"Nay, Mateo, I wish no throats cut for me! Still less that
"Oh L if you would only listen to me, Senorita."
She answered with a strange smile, and so calmly, that he was
disturbed by the very repose of tier voice and manner, as it ar-
gued a resolution so utterly immovable.
"Well,-what would you say, Mateo?"
The poor fellow could only repeat what he had so idly urged
already.
"Say, my lady, say ?-Why, I would say that you know not
what it is you are about to undertake and undergo! That you
are not fit--not strong enough !-" /
"Is it fatigue, pain, peril, loss of life, the agony of wounds?
I am prepared for all these! Must I repeat to you that I should
gladly welcome either, or all, of these, if I could lose those hor-
rors which oppress me now! Horrors! but if you know not-"

"But if y u are discovered?"
"AhI that is the terror! that 4"-after a pause: "But I must
brave it! 1 ell you, Mateo, I cannot remain here! 1 cannot sur-
vive thus! must extort from new griefs, troubles, privations
and dangers, Such7-excitement as shall obliterate the past! I
know not wh t you know, of my cause of agony; but I suspect,
Mateo, that ou know enough to understand that I can fly to
nothing wors , in the shape of woe, than I have already had to
meet! If yo know this, be silent! If you are prepared to
serve me fait fully, be submissive! Let me have no further en-
treaty."
"The Virgi be with youmy dear lady, and bring you help and
succor! I go to do all as you have commanded."
With thes words he left her. She closed and fastened the
door behind im; and, for a while, stood where she had been
speaking; wh lly absorbed in thought; looking like a statue ra-
ther than a b eating woman! Then she spoke, half in prayer,
half in solilo uy:
"Ay! the blessed Virgin! Succor! Succor! I surely need her
help! Woul she have come sooner! Oh! how wild the path-
way seems be ore me! What clouds, how torh! How flitting
with the wind: and what a crowd of changing and frightful as-
pects! They drift along, with the force of the tempest, which
they vainly o r to resist! Now, they cry to one another for help
and succor! ut they disappear, even as they cry, swallowed up
in the fearful oid, and making way for, other forms and aspects!
There is no s n, no moon, no stars; but there is a light as from
the eyes of d ath; sepulchral, and filled with myriads of floating
spectres! W at can it mean! Where am I! What do I see?
Ah! these ar Hernan de Soto, and his troops and followers!

loathes him a he rides !-and yonder is-Oh! Blessed Virgin,
it~ is. myself see! But the spectre lives and moves,-and
serves! It is Don Philip that charges away in front-away!
away! and- ee, how the boy follows him! Ah!.. .
The highly wrought and febrile condition of Olivia's brain,
must account or her apparent vhAon, in which she sees the known
and the conjec ured; in which she mingles a past knowledge with
her owu futur purposes. The madness lasted but for a brief
space! She eemed suddenly to recover, and sank upon her
knees before t~ie image of the Virgin. She now prayed inaudi-
bly; then ros4, calm,-rigid rather in every muscle, and then pro-
ceeded to unfo~d the contents of trunks and chests, as if with the
view of makin~ her toilet. Let us leave her to this performance.


CHAPTER XXX.
"I have surely seen him:
His favor is familiar to me.
Boy, thou hast looked thyself into my grace,
And art mine own."

CYMBEUNE.

THE eighteenth day of May, in the year of grace, one thou.
sand, five hundred and thirty-nine-more than three hundred
years ago !-~-was marked with a white stone in the calendar of
Don Ilernan de Soto; for, on that day, his squadron, eight large
vessels (~small-sized schooners of our days), a caravel (a sloop)
and two brigantines-things with scarce a deck at all-sailed from
the noble harbor of Havana, with their proWs turned east in the
direction of the opposite coast of Florida. But it was rather
late in the day before they took their departure; and though
the armament had been supposed in readiness several days be.
fore, yet, when the time came, there were many things that re-
quired to be hurried. Of these, the Adelantado had his share:
and Don Balthazar more than his share; all needing to be at-
tended to, and ~sped. But, of the cares of these great personages,
we will say nothing in this place. They scarcely affect our nar.
native. We shall confine ourselves to those of Don Philip de
Vasconselos, chiefly; and relate how he was provided With a
Moorish page, almost at the last moment, and on the most libe-
ral terms.
The sun was just warming the tops of the Cuban mountains,
when the good knight was summoned to the entrance of his lodg-
ings, to hearken to an unexpected visitor. This was noother
than our old acquaintance, Mateo, the outlaw. Don Philip was
on the alert, and was not found napping even at that early hour.
He was busy brushing up his armor; condensing his wardrobe
into the smallest possible compass; preparing his steed and fur-
niture; for transfer to one of the caravels where a place had been
appointed him; and adjusting his affairs, in general, for that re-
moval which had now become inevitable.
Don Philip met the outlaw with a grave, but gentle welcome;
spoke and looked him kindly; and asked what he could do for
him. The sight of the features of the Portuguese knight, seemed
to occasion some difficulty in the speech of the outlaw. The
sadnes~, approaching confirmed melancholy, which his face wore,

and which th~tones of his voice so well expressed, reminded Ma-
teo of many matters, and in particular, of one very terrible scene,
in which he ad beheld the brave cavalier wounded to the vej~y
soul; crushe , as it were, into the earth, and partly by his
proceedings. The whole scene came back to both parties as
they met; a d, as the gloom darkened on the visage of Don
Philip, the md of Mateo became agitated and confused, in a
way wholly nwonted with the rough, wild, half-savage charac-
ter of the -A! stizo. But he plucked up resolution to reply, and
in tones as si nple and unconstrained as possible.
"Well, Se or, it's not so much what you cat~ do for me, as
what I can d for you !-You've been wanting a page or squire,
Seflor," said he outlaw, "and you haven't got one yet ?"
"It is true, Mateo. I did not like the looks of any that were
brought me. Can you help me to one? Do you know ?-"
"I can provide you with a Page, Setior; not a servant; a
young lad, a kinsman, a nephew of my own; brown like myself,
but the child pf a free woman of the mountains; who has heard
of you, and 1ould like to see a little of the world, and of ar..
mies, under s ch a brave leader; but he can't be bought. He's.
the son of a free woman, Sefior, as I tell you, and will serve you
for love, not or money; and will bring his own horse, and pro-
vide his own ~means; and will only expect to be treated kindly,
and to be taught; the art of war; and-"
"Will he s]~ibmit-will he obey me
"Certainly,~ as a page, Seflor: and will be happy tQ do so. I
can answer fo all that, Seflor. He will do for you, I am sure,
as no bondma would ever do-will be faithful always-and be
very glad wh n you employ him, for he is pleased with you,
Seflor,-he h s seen you often, and admires you very much!
He longs to g with you, and hasn't let me rest, for the last week,
for urging me to come to you and make the offer. He don't
want pay-he has means of his own, as I told you: his moth-
er, a free wo an of the mountains, Sefior, has property; cattle
and horses; nd though the boy is quite young, and slightly
built, yet he h s health and strength, and can stand a good deal
of trouble an fatigue; all he wants is to be with you ;-that is,
to see war un er your lead ;-and as he's the son of a free wo-
man, SeftorJ thought it right, perhaps, that he should have such
desires, and should l~am from the best teacher."
"Bring him to m~, Mateo."
"He is here at ha~d-I could. not well keep him away, Seflor.
He is 80 anxious !"
Here the outlaw tt~rned away for a moment from the lodge of

the knight, and, stepping down to the highway, he gave a slight
halloo. In sight, stood a boy holding a stout arid spirited steed.
He approached at the signal, leading the horse. When he drew
nigh, the knight, who had retired into the lodge for a moment,
reappeared, and gazed steadily upon the new-corner.
," Let the boy fasten the horse to yon sapling, Mateo, and
draw nigh, that I may have some talk with him. He has a fine
horse, Mateo."
"Yes, Sefior, I raised him myself. He walks like the wind,
and will go like an eagle to the charge. Suppose- ydu step out,
and look at him closely, SeIlor. You must love a fine animal,
Senior, and this is one for a brave man to love, without feeling
ashamed of his choice."
How the heart, already vittdly sore, applies the most remote
allusion to the cause of its secret suffering! This casual remark
of Mateo, smote on the sensibilities of Philip de Vasconselos,
like a sneer. But the face of Mateo was innocent of any occult
meaning; and Philip showed that he felt, simply by an increased
solemnity of voice and visage. He followed the outlaw out to
where the horse stood, still held by the boy in waiting. The
first regards of the knight were given entirely to the steed.
"He is certainly a very fine animal, Mateo. You do not
praise him more than he deserves.~~
"See what a chest he-carries, Seflor, broad like a castle. See
what legs, so clcan, so wiry. There's not an ounce of fat to
spare from., those quarters. There's not a long hair that you'd
like to pull out from those fetlocks. And, look at his eye
It's like that of a great captain! ~2ortez, I warrant, does not
open a finer when he looks down from the towers of the Mexi-
can. See what a mane of silk! It is like the hair of a Princess.
And he's young, but a quarter over four, Sefior; and he comes
of a breed that lasts till forty."
"Unless no shaft from an Apalachian savage cuts him short;"
was the remai'k of Vasconselos, sadly made, as'he turned to be-
stow a look upon the boy.
There seemed to be a new interest springing into the eyes of
Philip as he gazed. The boy was of fine, dark bronze complex-
ion, looking more like the native race of Indians, than the Afes-
tizo cross, from which he was said to have sprung: he was well
made, and symmetrical; with good limbs and much grace of out-
line. But Vasconselos dwelt not so much upon the form, as
the face, of the youth. This seemed to rivet his attention for
awhile. And the effect of his gaze was to disquiet the boy him-
self'; and Mateo, his uncle. The former closed his eyes, involun'

tarily, under the st adfast glance of the knight; and th~ outlaw
hurriedly said:
"The boy is has ful, Sefior: he has never before stood in the
presence of a grea captain, or a knight, or even a fine gentle-
man. He is from the mountains, as I said, and don't know
about the fine beh vior of a young man of the city, who is al-
ways expected to 'qok up, you know, as if he was born to
say to the sun-' s op a little-I must talk with yeu.' Now,
Juan-"                 -
"Juan ?-Is that is name 2"
"Yes, Juan, Seio ; his mother's name is Juana, a free woman
of the mountains, nor-"
"His face remii ds me very much of one that I have seen
somewhere. I have certainly seen him before, Mateo."
"Never him, S flor,-never !" replied the other sturdily.
"Juan has never b en to the city before last week; and you, I
know, have never een into the mountains, Seflor. He is a
mountain boy, you Excellency,-.-.-son of a free woman of the
mountains. He ha seen you, but you could not have seen him
before. But what's in a likeness, Sefior? You will see them
every day, every w ere. I have seen thousands of likenesses,
in my time, for whi h there was not the slightest bit of reason.
Now, Juan looks like several people I knew, and you may have
seen them. He lo k's very 'like Antonio Morelos, a creole of'
Havana, here. Yo must have seen kim. Then, he looks mon-
strous like hi~ moth r, and she has been a thousand times to the
city. Oh! likeness s are nothing now, we see so many~ You
never could have se n our Juan's face before, Seflor."
Mateo talked rapi ly, rather than earnestly, as if against time
and the wind. Vase nselos did not seem to hear half what he
was saying. He St 11 kept an earnest~ eye upon the boy, as if
deeply interested; e idently communing with every feature of
his face-..-as far, th t is to say, as he was allowed to see them.
lut the boy's eyes ere cast down.. lie saw nothing; yet felt,
evidently, that the k en eyes of the knight were upon him.
"The boy is you g, very young, Mateo, and I very much fear
will hardly be able to stand the fatigues of such a campaign as
that we shall have t endure in - Florida."
"Oh! he is stro ~g, Seilor. His looks are deceptive. He
comes of a h~rdy ra e. He can stand fire and water."
"But he deems usually timid. Art thou sure that he has
courage? Will he ook danger in the eye?"
The boy seen~ed lisposed- to answer for himself. He looked
up-he looked Doi Philip in the eye, and without ble.nching.

Nay, there was so much of a settled calm-an unflinching reso.
lution in~his sudden glance, that the knight was~ struck with it.
"Certainly," quoth he, "that was something like a lightening
up of the spirit. He is capable of flashes, Mateo."
* "Ay, and of fire and flame too Seflor! Faggots! Give him
time, your Excellency, and you will see the blaze. But he's
naturally bashful when you're looking on' him. It's not a bad
sign in a bty, Sefior."
"No, truly! But I like his looks, Mateo. There is some.
thing in those features that please me much. Were I sure of
the strength and courage of the boy,.-his capacity to endure,-.
I should not hesitate: I should feel sure of his fidelity."
"Oh! that I can promise, Seflor. He's as faithful to the man
he loves as if he were a woman."
"Pity but ;he were more so !" responded the knight quickly.
The outlaw felt that he had blundered, and he promptly strove
to recover his false step.
"As a woman is expected to be, your Excellency; that's what
I mean! I can answer for Juan; for his courage, his hardihood,
not less than his honesty, Seflor. He's a boy of good princi-
ples."
"Let him answer for himself! Somehow, Mateo, I am a little
doubtful of your answers. You are.too quick to be quite sure of
what you say! hark ye, Juan, are you sure you desire to go
with me, to Florida ?"
The boy evidently trembled: but promptly enough, in a rather
hoarse voice, answered-
"Yes, Seflor! I wish to go with you."
The voice was a strange one, yet, its tones seemed to interest
the knight, as if there was something familiar in them also.
"He has a very peculiar voice, Mateo."
"Yes, Seflor, strange enough to those who heard him only a
year ago. Now, his voice is getting the cross 'twixt man and
boy. It's rather more a squeak than a ~ong, your Excellency.
But I reckon, Seflor, we all underwent some such change about
the same time in our lives."
Don Philip.'; But, my good boy, you don't know the toil and
trouble; the daily marching in that country; where there are
no roads; only rank forests, great swamps, wild beasts, deadly
reptiles; where, half the time, y o~u may be without food; and
perhaps, quite as frequently withoi~t water.

of his education to taste these things. I am to be a soldier, you

Philip. Logical enough, Mateo; yet I have no wish to shorten
his days.
"Try. me, Seflor," murmured the boy, in very low but ear..
nest tones, not daring to look up. There was a pleasant change
in the voice, which seemed to interest the hearer. lie put his
hand on the head of the boy, who started from under the touch,
and visibly trembled. But Philip was not permitted to see his
face.
"Do you not overrate both your courage and, your strength,
my boy? You start and tremble at my touch."
~' 'Tis not with fear, Sei'ior 1" was the ~ubdued reply, still in
the same low, sweet accents,
"No! For why should you fear me, child ~ But you seem
naturally timid-nervous, I should say ;-and such wars as that
we go upon, require hardihood above all other things. There
must be no~agitation when the trumpet rings the alarm. There
must be no faltering when we are bade to charge. The j~age of'
the knight will be expected to do good service, and to follow
close after his master, even if he does not emulate him. Caust
thou carry a lance, Juan ~"
"I am provided with a cross-bow, Sefior, and can shoot. The
lance will come-"
"Thou art so eager for it, Juan "
"Oh! take me with you, Seflor !"
"I like thee, boy. Thou hast something about thee which ap-
peals strangely to my imagination."
And the good knight sighed deeply. His instincts, rather than
his memory,. perhaps, guided his asseTerations. The boy hung
his head also. He dared not, at that moment, look up in the
face of Don Philip.
"I will take thee with me, boy, and fight thy battles, if need
be; will keep thee as much from harm as possible, and share
with thee my spoils----"
"I ask nothing, Sefior 1" said the ~boy hastily.
"Oh! no, Seflor 1" quoth Mateo. \" My sister is a free woman
of the mountains. Her son is able to pay his own way. He
wishes to go to see service and learn a profession, and will share
no one's spoil. He hopes to make his own. Besides, my sister

'~ .fsop. What do we act to-day?
Latinus.       Agavi'~ phrensy,
with Peritheus' bloody end."
MASSXuGEU. fihe Roman Actor.
BUT we are not fet permitted to depart, and must follow, for
a brief space, the fortunes of some other of our dramatispersonw.
The novelist cannot do always, as he would, with his own cre.
nations. He cannot linger, always with those whom~ he prefers.
We must suffer the Fates to exercise their controlling agencies
just as certainly as they do in real life, and among the living peo.
pie whom we know~. He may create, but he cannot control. It
is upon this very condition that he is permitted to create. The
Being, once filled with the breath of life, and having made his
appearance upon the stage of human action, must thenceforward
conform to necessitks over which the author exercises no authority.
These wUl have their origin in the character, the actions, and the
impulses, of his pei~sons; in the events which flow from their
performances; in their conflicts with rival actors, on the scene;
in their strength or imbecility; with some allowance made for
the operation of external causes, which, we are told, will always,
more or less, affect~ the destinies equally of mice and men! Let
us leave Philip do Vas~onse1os, and the dusky page, J~an, to their
progress over the blue waters of the gulf, while we follow the
steps of Mateo, the outlaw.
As soon as the Mestizo had closed the arrarigemenfr, by which
his "nephew, the son of a free woman of the mountains," had
been secured a place in the service of the knight of Portugal, he
disappeared from the, vicinity of~ the Spanish encampment. He
had, we may mention, trised some precautions when "about town,"
by which he had k~pt his person from all -unnecessary exposure.
He had still some decent regard for the existence of a class of'
per'~ons, the Aiguazils, with whom he entertained few special
sympathies; and, in leaving the lodgings of Vasconselos, he had
stolen away into covert, by the most secluded passages. A sin-
gle moment, in private, and i~nder the cover of a clump of trees,
densely packed, with shrubbery, had sufficed for his parting with
Juan. There he night be seen wholly to change the manner of

him seemed to mu~mur of repose. The inanimate life of the
forest declared nc~ unrest-no unruly passions,-no wretched
discontent. The s~y was now beautifully clear, and.' if a voice
was heard besides his own, it was that only of some very tiny
bird, such as harbors only in the stunted shrubbery, where a sin-
gle leaf will afford instant and close shelter for its form. But the
very repose spoke to the violent passions of the outlaw, with a
stimulating accent.
"Ah !"' said he, "If I only had him here ! "and he clenched his
fist savagely.
"But I must ~get those. papers! lie will be in the camp
soon to-day: He will be among the last to sail. In an hour, he
will have left the hacienda. But may he not return to it, in
the hope to see m~, and to learn that I have done his work?
Perhaps; but hardly! He will scarce have time! Humph!
Done his work! ii must do my dwn! Verily, if I meet him
there, I will do it thoroughl5r! Shall I cut throats except to my
own liking? By the Blessed Devils, no! I will cut his throat
if I can! And if I do, what is to keep me from the expedition?
I am a man for the ~vars. I will see how the lances cross with
the shock of thunder. But I must get me those papers. lie
little dreams that I know their hiding-place. When he goes to
th~ city this morning, it will be to make ready.. He will hardly
return to the hacienda. Then will I take possession. Juana
knows what to do. When the ships have all gone, she goes off
to the mountains. She will 15e doubly safe with the papers of the
Seflorita, and of th4 Uncle-devil. She shall be safe! Then, if
1 should find him t1z~re, and ~fe~l my way into his ribs, we are all'
safe! Oh! If I should only find him there! If he goes on
this expedition, will my poor lady be safe a moment? No!
No! There's no blinding his snake-eyes! He will see, and I
know there will be trouble-and more than trouble ;-there will
be a great danger always in the path of the good knight Oh!
it must .be that I shall split his black heart with my knife, and
let out all its poison with its blood! It must be, when there's
so much good to coipe of it-when there's no safety for anybody
while he lives!' I owe him a stroke of my machete! And if
the Blessed Devils give me half a chance, I will pay him with a
vengeance 1"
We have here the passions of the outlaw's s6ul, and the
plans of his mind, fairly mingled up together, in that sort of web
of thought, which is the usual mental process in the setisuous
nature. Don Balthazar, at this moment little dreamed of the
danger which threatened him. While Mateo, making his gray

Don was savag ly meditating, in his turn, up n some of the dis~
appointments w ich he had experienced. T at the Portugues~
knight still live , was a present m~noyance, nd a vital danger.
lie now knew himself to be at the mercy of this cavalier, so far
as his moral position was concerned. Th revelation of his
secret, he well new, would be fatal to his reputation in Cuba,
and the army ;-so long as the government o both was adminis-
tered by persons so severely virtuous as he believed Don Her-
nan de Soto and his noble wife to be. Tr e, he had a certain
security for his ecret, in the very regard wh ch Philip de Vas-
conselos eviden ly entertained for Olivia. S long as she lived,
Philip would pr bably.~be silent, in respect t that which would
hurt her reputaf on. But who was to secure the unfaithful guar-
dian against the speech of Olivia herself? H r passionate blood
had evidently e caped wholly from the co trol of her tyrant.
He had made er desperate, in making he desolate; and he
felt that, in deat alone, could his safety be made certain. He
knew the nature of passionate women too wel ; and now perceiv-
ed that Olivia, i this respect, too much rese bled her Biscayan
mother, of who his experience was suflicien ly vivid, and who,
he well knew, n the madness of her awa ened passions, had
neither fear nor prudence, nor scruple of any s rt. He trembled,
accordingly; pr~ ud, fearless and powerful a he was; lest the
reckless, or the thoughtless word .of either t e knight of Portu-
gal or Olivia de Alvaro, should, at any mom nt, hurl him head-
long from positi n, making him odious to all, and subjecting him
to legal, as well as social, persecution. W y had not the out~
law, Mateo, don his work upon the knight? There were surely
opportunities en not. and Mateo was too w 11 known; as a des-
perado, to supp se that he had either moral s rules, or personal
fears! The qu stion troubled the Don, sine , from his own con-
jectures, he vain y sought an answer.
While he me stated these doubts, an aide of the Adelantado
arrived, and br ught him dispatches from on Reman, which
required his ear y presence in the city. He dismissed the mes-
senger with a re l~y which promised that he w uld soon be there,
and was now si ply making his final prepare ions for joining the
expedition, and superintending the work of inbarkation. The
officer disappear d, riding fast, and was seen at a distance, as he
left the hacienda by the approaching outlaw.
"Demonios!' muttered Mateo, between his closed teeth,
"there goes my last chance! Had I come a hour sooner!"
He had zuista en the rider for Don Baltha r. He now more

leisurely continued his progress, and at length found himself
amidst the silent groves surrounding the summer-house of the
knight,-that lovely and secluded lodge which had been so fruit.
ful in events affecting the destinies of some of the persons of our
drama. It was fated to furnish yet another scene of dcep inter-
est to the parties.
Don Balthazar, burning or preserving papers, arranging arms,
and armor, was busy and thoughtful in his chamber, when the
old hag, Sylvia, suddenly burst into the apartment. He looked
up at the intrusion, with a haughty frown; but she was not ap-
palled by it. She was wild 'with excitement; and her sinister
and withered features were now absolutely fiendish in the expres-
sion of rage which they exhibited. She ~ould scarcely speak, so
agitating were her emotions. When she did succeed in giving
utterance to the cause of her excitement, she was surprised to
find that her master did not partake of her wrath, and seemed
lightly to listen to her communications.
"He is here, Seilor;" she exclaimed,-" the villain, Mateo;
the outlaw; the murderer; the robber of the old woman! He
is here, Senor, in the groves; he is even now gone to the garden
h6use !"
Mateo had evidently neglected his usual precautions. Satis-
fied that the horseman whom he had seen pushing for the city, at
full speed, was Don Balthazar himself; he had been at no pains
to make his movements secret.
"Ah! he is here, then,-Mateo?" and.thc knight smiled with
a grim complaisance, and muttered, sotto voce-" He has done it,
then, perhaps, and comes for his reward! Good! He knows his
time, and has, no doubt, done it efficiently! Well! I must see
him."
He at once rose, and, with his sword only at his side, moved
quickly from the chamber. Sylvia was quite confounded; and
followed, muttering her surprise as she went. Don Balthazar
never once looked behind, and did not see, her; or he wQuld
have dismissed her with severity. And then !-But we must not
anticipate ~
He hurried on; and so rapid were his movements, that the
stiffened limbs of the old woman utterly failed to enable her to
keep any sort of pace with the progress which he made. He
was soon in the groves; had soon overpasses the space; and,
walking in the buckskin shoes, the use of which the Spaniards
had borrowed from the red men,-wearingthern\ commonly when in
their peaceful avocations -he entered the garden house unheard.

"Villain, would you murder me ~" gasped the cavalier, vainly
struggling to rise, and making efforts as desperate as unavailing.
"You have come for it! I thought you safe, and Ecursed the
Blessed Devils, that helped you off. But I did 'em wrong! They
have delivered you into my hands! You thought to buy me, did
you, to kill the good knight of Portugal? I'll kill you for him!
I'll kill you for the poor young lady, my mistress! Oh! didn't
I see, with my own e~yes, just as Don Philip saw? You ought
to die a hundred deaths! But, as it's only once for you as for
other men, the sooner you taste it, the sooner you get your wages.
You shan't have time to say a prayer; not one: for you shan't
have any mercy from God any more than from me! Die! I
gay; die! Die! Die!"
The knight succumbed; he had neither room nor strength for
struggle. Hands and head buried in the chest, and face down-
wards, he was helpless! The hoarse gurgle of his breath in the
throat was already painful to the ear, and the writings of his
form were those of a man vainly struggling with the last potent
enemy; when, suddenly, a sound was heard by the writhing and
pimost suffocated man,-a sound,-a stroke !-another, and ano-
ther !-and the gripe of his enemy relaxed; and there wa~ a wild
yell above him ;-but one !-and Don Balthazar felt relieved.
He began once more to breathe. He felt no longer the incum-
bent weight of the gigantic ruffian upon his back! Gradually, he
recovered consciousness. He heard a voice calling him by name.
He felt hands officiously helping him to rise; he felt a cool but
grateful shock of~ water. His eyes opened to the day once more.
lie looked about him: slowly, but fully, at length his ~1ance
took in the objects around him. He found himtLself sehted beside
the chest, from which he had been rolled out rather than lifted;
and, before him, stiff in death, lay the corse of the outlaw, who,
but a little before, had been so completely in his power! The
old hag, Sylvia, stood at hand to help her master, and soon ex-
plained the agency by which his life had been saved. She had
followed him to the summer-house, curious to see and hear, and
anxious for the recovery of her goods, of which Mateo had de-
prived her. She had come not a moment too soon! Seeing the
knight's danger, she had caught up the hatchet which was em-
ployed for trimming the trees and shrubbery of the grove, and
which ~Iay in the verandah of the summer-house, convenient, with

CHAPTER XXXII.
"Master, go on, and I will follow thee
To the last gasp, with truth and loyaltyy"
As You Lint, IT.
IT was a goodly hour after the event, before Don Balthazar
had sufficiently recovered from his sufferings to resume his acti-
vity, or comply with the summons of the Adelantado, to return
to the city. When able to rise and look about him, he gave his
orders with customary sang froid, for the removal and disposi-
tion of th~ dead body of the outlaw, which was publicly exposed
during the day, and finally hungjn chains by the public execu-
tioner. But this exhibition did not take place till after the de-
parture of the expedition; and the good Knight of Portugal, and
his page Juan, were so~at surprised at not exchanging fare-
wells with the bold c~utlaw~ as he had promised them should be
the case. They little anticipated for him, such a short and hur-
ried transition, from the extreme health, hope and vigor of
impetuous and eager manhood, to the stagnating and corrupting
embrace of death; and did not learn, until they had arrived in
Florida, the history of the bloody and fatal conflict which we
have narrated. It was with a feeling of disappointment, that
they turned their eyes upon the wide waste of waters before
their prows, from the crowds upon the shore, gradually melting
into masses, and to be indiPidualized no longer. As the night
came on, Philip de Vasconselos threw himself upon the deck of
the caramel, musing sadly upon the stars as they silently stole
out to sight, and hardly knew that the boy Juan crouched as
silently behind him. There was scarcely a word spoken be-
tween them that night, yet, somehow, this silent attendance, and
simple devotion of the page, strengthened, at each moment, the
feeling of sympathy, with which the knight, from the very first,
regarded him.
"The boy hath a heart," quoth Philip to himself;.-" he can
feel. He hath not yet survived his tenderness. But it will not be
for long. The world rarely leaves us loi~g in possession of such
a treasure. Were he wise, now, the sooner he flings it from him,
or puts it to silence, the more sure were he to .escape its sor-
rows. What profits it to us that we have the wealth that keeps
us wakeful; when sleep,-sleep,-is the best blessing that we

*     mind and eye, capable of reading a very subtle, profound and mys.
serious language. Now the secret of this capacity is to be found
only in very active susceptibilities, on the part of him who reads.
lli~ open sensibilities must be keen and watchful; he must
possess a~gentle spirit at the core: he must have loved and
suffered; must still love and suffer; must be full of .pity and
sorrow, though he speaks little and doth not complain; and
there must be a rare delicacy of sentiment in his soul, so that
there shall be no change in the aspect of the other whom he seeks
or esteem~, however slight, that he shall not see, and comprehend
at a single glance. Nor wants he to see, except to be solicitous;
nor comprehend that he may slight. It is enough, here to say,
that these conditions, by which kindred spirits seek, meet, and
link themselves with one another, were all found in the respect
of Don Philip and the boy Juan; so that a look, a tone, a ges.
ture, of one or the other, did not fail to make itself fully under.
stood by both, and to command at the same time the most
genial sympathy. And it shall be no long time, after such is
found to be the case between two such parties, when it will be
impossible to maintain cold barriers of society, keeping them
separate; when the two hearts shall so yearn for the close com-
munion, that the mind shall forget all the distinctions of men
on land, and there shall be a gentle law controlling both, which
shall do away utterly with all common usages of constraint,
substituting others of a finer fabric, more subtle, apparent, and
not less strong; which shall grow out of veneration and sympa-
thy. Thus it was that Philip de V~sconselos soon' learned-
even in that short voyage-to love the boy, Juan, as a boy of
truly loyal and deyout soul; as of tender and sweet sympathies;
and of tastes so delicate, as equally to confound the knight at
their possession by one of his sex and race. The boy, on the
other hand, might be supposed to love the knight because of his
justice, his noble purpose and princely thoughts; his gr~at courage
and skill in arm~; hi~s graceful carriage; and for all that was
manly and great in his character. It might be that, had Philip
been of the other sex, these traits would have proved less im-
posing in the estimation of the page! But it matters little as to
what were the causes, respectively working, by which the two
gradually grew to be so well attached to each other. Enough,
that such is the fact, and that they held frequent communion.
With whom else should Philip commune? Never was noble
knight more desolate of soul, and lone of place, than he. Often
did the eyes of Philip rest searchingly upon the bronze features
of the boy, with a curious and tender interest. It seemed to

good duty in the thickest of the flght,-to rend or devour the
naked savages, upon whom they had been. taught to feed. The
chivalry of that day found nothing inhuman in the use of such an
agency in war. But, as mere conquest ~were nothing without
taking heed to its acquisitions, workmen, and the necessary atppa.
ratus, were carried, for the purpose of smelting and~ refinixig the
precious metals which they confidently expected to find. Nor
were the chains, handcuffs, and collars of iron, forgotten, by which
kheir captives were to be secured% in order to be shipped safely
to the plantations of the Cuban. Droves of cattle, mules, and
hoo's, constitu~d a more benevolent provision, made for the wants
of the expedition, when it should reach the country, where the
hogs and cattle were to be let go free.
Accustomed to the easy conquest of such feeble tribes as the
Peruvian, De Soto felt that such an armamei~t, so far surpassing
those of Cortez and Pizarro, was quite equal to the conquest~ over
the whole country of the Apalachian. Never a doubt of this
result crossed the mind of the haughty Adelantado, and he made
instant preparations for throwing a body of troops on shore, and
taking possession of the territory in the name of his monarch,
the Emperor, Charles the Fifth. The wealthy knight, Yasco
Porcallos,.claimed the high honor of leading this party, and per-
forming this act of sovereignty; and the privilege was conceded
him. He was to have the command of a force of three thousand
men, being, in fa~t, all those who could be prepared for disem-
barkation during that day. The shipping, meanwhile, were gra~
dually warping in shore, a performance not so easy on account of
the rapid shoaling of the water, and for which they had to depend
upon the tides. Meanwhile, more for the purposes of solemnity
and state, than because he felt the need to be taught anything, the
Adelantado' called a council of his chh~f officers. Philip do Vas-
conselos was invited to this conference. He, by the way, had been
one of those designated to land with Va~co Porcallos, the better
that he might act as interpreter, should there be any meeting with
the red men. With regard to this sort of service, De Soto now
more than ever felt the importance or having one with him who
not only had some knowledge of the country, but who could thus
become a medium of communication with its people. Though
still a little too lofty and reserved towards our knight of Portu-
gal, he yet descended somewhat from his pride of place in order
to solicit him. He had already distinguished him by the request,
that he would serve about his person as one of his Lieutenants,-
a request which the other had no motive to refuse; and he cheer-

knight of Portugal; and the latter, shrugging his shoulders, con.
soled himself with the reflection, that the lesson which he strove
in vain to enforce, would probably be taught, though at a greater
cost to his hearers, by the Apalachian him'~elf.
"The experience which tutors pride to a just humility," he
mused within himself; "is perhaps, the best sort of lessening;
and he who wQuld succeed, when the warfare is somewhat with
his own vanity, cannot be sa'i~ed from the punishment which fol-
lows close upon its indulgence. It is well, perhaps, that he will
not hear, since it is only right that *he should be made to feel;
and our safety and success, pc~rhaps, must equally depend upon
our being made to feel, at the beginning of the adventure, rather
than at a later time, when we are too deeply engaged in it. But,
so sure ~as there are Fates, Hernando de Soto will be certain
to receive ,his lesson before he hath gone very deeply into his
books."
The conference,-such as it was-where there could be no
dissent and~ no deliberation,~-was soon at an end. De.. Soto
simply detailed his plans at length, and gave his order for the
disembarkation,, the conduct of which was entrusted to the
wealthy Don Vasco Porcallos; and never was ambitious mortal
more eager than he to set forth on his adventures. His ap-
petites for gold and captives had been growing with every league
of progress which he had made on the watery waste, and still
less than the Adelantado was he prepared to apprehend the pos.
sibiity of failure or reverse of any sort in his present frame of
mind. He dreamed only of riding down myriads of jiaked and
panic-stricken savages, selecting the most vigorous captives and.
spearing the rest. But Vasconselos better knew the angere, and
hence the duty. He knew they were not to triumph without
hard fighting, great firmness, and constant 'caution.
Scarcely had the vessels appeared in sight of the coasts, than
the balefires smoked on all the heights and tumuli that lined the
shore, attesting the watch and vigilance of the Floridians. These
were signals of danger, and announced to the warriors in the inte-
rior to gather from all quarters. Philip pointed out these sig.
nals to the page. "See you, Juan," said he,-" already the red
men have taken alarm. Those smokes that rise every where in
sight, will kindle other smokes, which shall give warning to all
the separate tril5es. They will fire piles throughout the mighty
forests, until the answering smokes shall ascend from the great
mountains of the Apalachian. Where a people are thus vigilant
to note and prepare for the first dangers of invasion, they are
wailike; they will fight famously ; ' they will give us work to

"In God's name, boy., have your wish. You say rightly4.
There must be a time, when this lesson must be taught, and
learned, and the sooner, as you say, the better. Get on your
escaupil, and see that your weapons are such as will serve to
risk a life upon. Bring them hither, fhat I may see.~~
We must not linger on these details. Suffice it that all parties
were soon prepared for the landing. It was on the last day of
the month of May, soft, serene and sweet, that the gallant Lii.
dalgo, Don Vasco Porcallos, led the way for his detachment of
three hundred, andi took final possession of the soil of the Flo-
ridians in the name of Spain. The solemnity was a very stately
one, but needs not that w~e describe it. The banner of Castile
was unrolled and elevated in the free air of the Apalachians, and
~ras planted upon one of the elevations nearest to the shore.
The region was thickly wooded, the forests were all clad in the
freshest verdure of the opening summer; the breeze was charged
with odors from worlds of flowers, the choicest natives of the
country; and a natural delight filled every bosom, and exhila-
rated the spirits of tjne soldiery with an enthusiasm that seemed
already in possession of the fullest successes. In pitching th4'eir
can~p, Philip de Vasconselos again ventured to' give such hints
to Don Vasco, as became his experience and caution. But the
latter was even more sanguine than De Soto, and less heedful;
and the manner in which he received these counsels of the knight
of Portugal, seemed .to have been borrowed from that of the
Adelantado on the occasion air~dy~ shown. He was civilly
scornful, and Vasconselos saw, ~it~~i chagrin and apprehension,
that the ground chosen for the ni~ht was such as would rather
invite and facilitate than discourage from attack. But he could do
no more. He had only to submit, and hope against his fears,
and provide as well as he might, against the emergency that he
anticipated; But lacking all command, with but the single fol-
lower, he a child, inexperienced and evidently tired, what could
be done ~
"Come," said he cheerfully to Juan, "come, my boy, and let
us seek out our quarters. We are limited to a certain precinct,
but this~ affords .. choice of sleeping-place, and upon this choice
may rest chance of safety."
The boy followed in silence. The knight rambled over the
ground assigned for the encampment, and chose a little dump of
wood, which afforded sufficient cover for 'a small group, yet stood
apart, as it were, from the rest of the forest: affording an inter-
val, over which the eye could range with tolerable freedom for
some sp~e, and thus note any hostile approaches. To find this par-

vcinient, they selected their own place of repose. The dried
leiwes of the forest furnished a sufficient couch; the forest pines
and other trees yielded a goodly shelter. The evening was calm
and grateful. The warm serenity of the season required no
closer lodgings. The most perfect repose prevailed throughout
the forest, and save the clamor made by the troops, not a sound
was t6 be heard, whetl~er on land or sea. The soldiers dis-
persed themselves about the woods, chose their places of repose
as Vasconselos had done, but without any regard to his precau.
tions. They saw no danger, and apprehended none, as they be.
held no foe, and all was confidence, and all was excitement.
"Surely, Sei'ior," said Juan, "these quiet woods harbor no
enemies.~~
"It is in the quiet seas, Juan, that the shark prevails. In the
tempest he retires- to his ocean caverns. The wolf prowls in the
stillness of the night. The adder is a great traveller in the dark
hours. It is because these forests are so quiet now, that I feel
there are enemies at hand. But let us sup ere we speak of them,
lest we forfeit something of appetite. Where is thy wallet ?"
It was produced. The page displayed its contents, and stood
in waiting.
"Sit, boy, and eat with me. Thou art my companion, child,
not slave. - Sit !"
With a strange tremor in his limbs, and vacant look which
did not escape the eye of Philip, the boy took his seat before
him, but scarcely nigh. This emotion the knight ascribed to
the humility of the page. He strove to soothe this b~y conde-
scension, by the utmost gentleness of manner and fondness of
discourse; but the effect was not ~uch as ~e expected-not just
then, at least.
"Time will weal' off these fears," said the knight to himself; as
he broke the bread and passed it to the bo$~.
"Eat, Juan!, Thou wilt need to learn ow to eat and sleep at
all seasons; if thou would~ become a sol ier. We shall have
to wake and fight, when it shall not please s, the ~ummons; and
shall not be summoned to our food alwa s, or our sleep, when
most the appetite shall call for both."
When they had supped, Philip said-
"Now, Juan, thou wilt watch while I sle p. I will take advan-
tage of the early hours of the night, when the red man seldom
prowls or strikes, and in the middle of it, I will .wake, or thou
shalt waken me, that I may take thy place as watcher for the rest

fancies, dreaming and delicious, yet so touched with a peculiar
sadness, that the bitter predominated over the sweet, and the big
tears might be seen, moulding themselves into melancholy jew.
els in the starlight, rounding theitiselves gradually upon his cheek,
and dropping one by one, as they grew to brilliant. The hours
swam along with the stars, and the stars waned in their silent
progress for the blessing of other eyes~ and the eyes of Juau
drooped at last with the heaviness upon them. He strove to
shake off the drowsiness which he felt; but there was something
in that foreign atmosphere which could not' be withstood, and
while he strove to range along the barrel of the cross-bow,
(which he had taken up with some vag~i e notion that it would
k'eep him wakeful,) over the intervals whii~h spread between him
and the gloQmy shadows of the wood which he had been espe-
cially enjoined to watch ;-it seemed to him as if the wood it-
self 'were swimming, like waves of the sea, and as if the stars
descended to the plain, only to ascend on e more; to and fro;
upward and downward and onward, till all things appeared to
mix and mingle in his sight. Then sudde ly, he started, with a
strange confusion, as he fancied he heard t e voice of Don Philip.
This, for a moment, aroused him; but cooking down, he saw
Don Philip still sleeping; and, satisfied t see thus, he was con-
scious of little more after this for some time, though he might
have been just as watchful as before. B t very soon after this,
Don Philip really awakened. He found t e boy fast asleep,'with
his arm thrown over his neck. He gently ~unloosed it, and rose.
~' Poor boy !"~aid the knight-" Thoi~ hast taken on thee a
perilous labor, which thy slight figure will scarce endure. But
sleep, and I will watch thee. I could wish thee stronger, for my
sake, no less than thine; for verily, of all this host, I have now
none but thee !" After a pause-.--" And there is that about the
child which binds me to him; whichmake~me love him almost!'
Wherefore? It is because I am alone! It is because the nature
of the strong ~'nan requires a charge, a t~ust, a burden, so that
his strength shall be healthfully~at exercis~; so that his muscles
shall r~ot shrink, lacking due employment Well! I will pro-
tect a~d help him so long as I can help an# thing, and then-but
why k~ok into the vast vacancy of that da~k realm of the future,
in whi~h no flower shall ever grow for me."
He ~6se suddenly, as if startled~ se
to his hide, and caught up the     ized his sword, buckled it

forward a few paces, and seemed to listen then returned to his

is like that of a child or girl,-and, wi excited 'puls , and

in time to discover two dark forms,-cl arly men,--wh were
drawing Juan away to the thickets., H readily divin d the
purpose in the action. Again a shriek: nd this time he knew
it for the boy's; but so full of a feminine terror, that hi heart
sickened as he thought of the strange simplicity and ign rance
which had prompted one so feeble to venture upon an ent rprise
so perilous. He thought and felt thus, even in that mom nt of
alarm. He saw that the boy struggled, a~d he further sa v that
the dusky forms, by whom he had been seized, were brand shing,
each, a heavy mace above his head. T~~ere was no ti e fbr

boy, then, as he staggered back, to run hih2i through the body,
-was the work of a few moments. The ~wo savages lay at his
feet in the agonies of death. The boy staggered, gasping, t ards
him, an hysterical sob only breaking from ~is lips. With stern
voice, the knight said
"Seize thy cross-bow, Juan, and collect thyself. Thi is no
time for fears. The Apalachian is on us."
To confirm his words, at that very instant, the wild y us of
the savages rose up in all quarters of t~ie encampment. The
Spaniards struggled out of sleep only to encounter their en mies.
The sentinels had slept. Few were awak~. The surpri was

IT does not lie within the plan of this legen to follow in de-
tail all ~he progi~esses of De Soto in his weary arches, his long
wanderi~igs and fierce battles with the Flori ian and other In-
dian rates of our country~ These details m st be sought in
other histories, and are available in many, to the reader. We
shall only notice the generall route pursued b the expedition,
through what regions, and dwell upon those e ents only, which
concern the persons of the drama, with whom we have already
traveller ~l through so many pages.
The encounter with the red men of Apala~hia., which, as we
have seen, took place almost on the very mol# ent of De Soto's
landing in the country, was only the beginning of a long history
of. conWcts. From tribe to tribe, from village to village, he
pressed onward, only to encounter the fiercest foes, or the niost
treacherous friends. But, at the very outset o~' his career, he re-
covere~ a Spaniard, one Juan Ortizwho had l~een a follower of
Patuphilo de Narvaez, and had become a capti'~e to the Apalach-
lans. ~n a captivity of several years, he had acquiredd the lan-
guage qf many of the tribes, and alx~ost lost l~is own. This ac-
quisitio~i rendered De Soto somewhat independent of the services of
Phulipde Vasconselos. The latter was ~oon ade aware of this
consciousness of independence, on the part of t e Adelantado.
Eager for the attainment of the great Qbjects of the expedition,
the famous cities, and the golden treasure, w ich 'were believed
to be locked up in the Apalachian mountains, Soto lost no time
in unnecessary delays. Dispatching his large t vessels to Ha-
vana with the view to cutting off all thought n the part of his
followers, of returning home-in this policy, emulating Cortez,
and other great leaders,-"Soto retained but a ingle caravel, and
two brigantines, to keep possession of the sea coast and the bay
where he had cast anchor. To this charge, h appointed Pedro
Calderon, an old soldier. He next proceeded o send f9rth vari-
ous sn~all expeditions into the country, seekh~tg gold aud infor-

lay with the Spaniards, but only as a consequence of their

firearms, rather than their valor. In this quality, the Ap~

ISOLATION OF PHILIP.                398
satisfy the spectators-if any may~ be thought to have been spec-
tators at such a time, and in such fields-of h~s stoutness of
heart a~id readiness of aim. Philip de Vasconselos himself was
satisfied, and felt ~nore at ease in respect to the boy's safety, than
he had been at the first opening of the campaign.
He ~yas more than satisfied in other respects. The boy proved
an intelligent companion. In his society the knight found solace,
and oft~n did he fuel surprise, at the equal taste and intellect, so
different from his race, which, as they grew more and more inti-
mate, t~ie boy betrayed. Of course, Philip had not forgotten
what Mateo had told him, that Juan, the son of a free woman of
the mo~intain5, had been carefully nurtured, and had not been
wanting in such education as could be procured by money, in
such a region, during that early period. But the intellect of the
boy declared for gifts; quite as much as acquisition-such gifts
as were not often found in any other than the white race. But,
though such exhibitions surprised Philip, quite as much as they
delighted him, yet his moods and present employment were not
of a sott to suffer him much speculation upon them. - lie was,
after a ~vhile, quite content to enjoy their benefits, in the solace
4iich they brought, without questioning their source; and he
needed all this solace. He was still alone, and still, in spite of
his services and valor, quite as much as before an object of jea-
lousy among the Spaniard~ Nuno de Tobar, indeed, was still
his friend, and he knew others in the army, who were kindlily
inclined; but it was not often that the parties saw each other.
They were in different commands, and frequently detached on
expediti6ns, aside from the main route. There had been* no
absolute reconciliation between the Portuguese brothers; and
Andrea still kept aloof; though we may state that his bitterness
of mood had been modified. But they rarely met. Philip was
* a frequent volunteer when perilous or adventurous service was
required. It was in this way, mostly, that he exercised his skill
in arms, save when summoned to the special assistance of the
Adelantado, to whom he was nominally an aide; but this rarely
happened except when captives or embassies were to be examin-
ed, and interpretations made from their language. This requi-
sition, too, had been of infrequent occurrence since Juan Ortiz
had been recovered. He, however, sometimes failed to under-
stand the tono~ues of foreign tribes, and thus it was that Philip
was needed. ~But for this, his uses in the ar~ny, according to the
estimates seemingly put upon them by his superior, were of little
moment.
Philip felt this treatment, and his boy showed that he felt it

also. The two lived to themselves apart. They lay bcn4
same trees at night: they harnessed their horses in th
glade. They sat together at the same repast; Juan ret:
hind his lord, and speaking with him thus; except when, a
as finally was frequently the case, Philip bade him to sil
him, or before him-a proceeding which the knight adop'
better to encourage the boy, arid tQ overcome his excess
ness. And he gradually succeedect The boy, who shrar
all other associations, gractually grew to him, as the vine
to the mighty tree. Soon he came to speak freely ever
own secret fancies and emotions, and it really pleased the
to hearken the language, still timidly spoken, of a young
lug heart, possessed of the deepest and tenderest feelings
the isolation in which he lived, and the wild seclusion
realm of shade arid forest, seemed rather to expand an~
bk, than subdue and overcome. The deep solitude wI

it was soon felt-by Philip, at least,-that, in this ne

the sharpness arid severity of their sting. He sometime:

to question its sources. When they were apart he muse
his fondness: with curiosity. Why should he, a knight of
gal, feel such sympathy for this Moorish urchin? It was
that he recalled the boy's devotion to himself.-his goodn
heart, his gentleness of mood, the quickness of his mm
delicacy of his fancy, and his general intelligence. These d
suffice to account for the hold upon his affections which tli
had taken. In all his meditations when leff to himself he

SUSPICION.                   895
To all ot ers, Juan was a stone,-inse~sible, unattractive-a
sullen, reser ed arid silent boy,-submissive, but retiring; hum-
ble, but not soliciting; one of whom nobody entertained thought
or question; of whom the common speech in camp was, that this
page was just suited to the haughty and sullen master. There
was an exception perhaps to this general judgment. D.~al-
thazar de Alvaro was observed to note the boy with a persevering
eye. Juan was the first to be aware of this. It did not finally
escape the notice of Philip; but it did riot occasion his surprise
or curiosity. In the case of Juan, however, it was something
of an annoy~rice. Had he been watched, it would have been
seen that he ~otight to avoid the eyes of Don Balthazar-that he
was somewhat agitated when they met suddenly-that he spoke
with a slight tremor of voice in the' hearing of the Don, and es-
pecially when, as was sometimes the case, he was required to
answer his demands. It sometimes happened that Don Baltha..
zar sought V4sconselos at his post, or where h~ had cast himself
down for the night. On such occasions-as he considered the
ostensible si~bject upon which the former came,-he could riot
forbear musiiig upon its ii.~madeqi~iacy as a plea for coming. The
parties did riot love each othc~r. Their instincts wei~e hostile.
There could riot be any cordialit~y between them; and, such b~ing
the case, wh~ Don Baithazar shoiz ld seek him, unless with reasons
of necessit~~was a frequent subject..~of Philip's surprise. At .such
times, he alWays drew an unfavorable augury from hi~ coming.
"He meaki s mischief~" said he aloud, one evening, after the
departure of Don Balthazar from the place where he had laid
himself dow~ to rest. "Why should he come to me, and on
such pretext? What is it to me whither we move to-morrow,
or what new dreams fill the brain of the Adelantado? ~et him
march, east or west, along the plains, or among the mountains,
I care nothing! and, sure, he knows it. He knows, to ~, that I
love not his serpent nature, and his subtle and treacherous eye.

sought to s~ay me ere this, -nevertheless--I feel it-by sure
instinct, I feel it-this man means mischief."
"He is a ~rillain !" was the bitter speech of Juan from behind
the tree, wh4re he ha~1 crept quietly.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
"Hell put it in
The enemy's iriind to be desperate."  MAsSJ ~GsR.
WE can nly give glimpses of a progress, every form of
which was di tinguished by its own interest and capricious varie-
ties. We ha e shown, thus far, the relationships of our parties;
and how the grew, and what were their developments. Each
day gradually contributed to unfold the increasing dependence of
Don Philip nd his page upon one another; and both were
watched, tho gh neither perhaps saw to what extent, by the ser-
pent eyes of on Balthazar de Alvaro. Meanwhile, Philip de
Vasconselos eemed to grow less and less in favor with the Ade-
lantado, who now rarely summoned him to his service; and,
except when. they met, seemed to have forgotten his existence.
On such occasions there was an evident distance of manner in
the bearing o~ D~ S6to, amounting~almost to. repugnance, which
increased the regrets of Philip that he had ever joined th~ expe-
dition. His mortification at having done so, would have been
unendurable but for a certain indifference of mood, which ren-
dered him reckless what became of him,-reckless of all things,
indeed; and ~nade him just as well satisfied to rove without a
purpose, and fight without a cause, as to sleep beneath h~s tree,
when the day had closed in exhaustion. Latterly, his feeling
grew less different. He seemed to be slowly acquiring a new
interest in li~'e. He was conscious of more impulse, c~f aim,
and objects, yague, indeed, enough, and which he did not peek to
pursue, but which served to show, that life for him still ~ad its
resources, even its attractions, and was not wholly der~ied an
object. But ~f the question as to that object was asked 9f Don
Philip, he wo&amp;ild have been without an answer. Enough that
under existing~ circumstances, he could find his associations still
endui'able ;-without an~object in life, he could yet find life not.
wholly a burden and a curse!
The brooding mind was not suffered much opportunity for ex-
ercise, in the progress pursued by De Soto. That ambitious chief-
tain, in his appetite for conquest and power, kept his followers
sleepless. We may now, with tolerable certainty, follow the
route of the ~paniards upon the map, and trace their course from

tam. His next object was to win his favor-a measure conce
to be by no means difficult, inasmuch as the Adelanted

warriors, who had sought to rescue his person. Vitachuco, th
kept as a prisoner, and watched, was still allowed certain p
leges. He ate at the table of Soto. He was still able to c
mune with his subjects, hundreds of whom were employed a
the Spaniards, as slaves and drudges. To these Vitachuco c
municated his secret thoughts and purposes. He was n
willing captive. But he was politic. He met subtlety ~

tion was working in his soul, and he only wanted the pro

a day of feasting, when Soto entertained his captive along
other nobles and princes of the Apalachians, held in sim

TREACHERY.                     p399
According to their, plan, Vitachuco was to spring upon the Ade-
lantado, and kill him if he could, while they were at dinner; his
followers doing the same good service for all the Spaniards pre-
sent-and, without, for all others upon whom, they cot4d lay
hands. The village of Vitachuco was to be the scene of action.
lt happened, the evening before the event, that Juan, the page
of Vasconselos, remarked the activity of Vitachuco's pages, and
that they held frequent communications with their people.
Crowds of the red men were seen i coming to the encampment,
or crowding stealthily about it. he place where Vascoiiselos
found shelter, usually, on the verge of the encampment, was fa-
vorable to observation; and the co stant coming and departure
of the Floridians, compelled the bo 's observation, and prompted
him to communicate with the kni ht, his master. They both
watched, and discovered enough, a all events, to render them
suspicious. They redoubled their vigilance, and found that some
provisions, ra~her~ novel for a feast, had been made by the sava-
ges. They found hidden in the coi tiguous woods, large bundles
of darts, barbed with flints, that we e ready for use; and scores
of huge macanas or war maces, edged with flint also, a single
blow from which, in a moderately strong hand, would cleave the
skull of any Spaniard, though covered with helm of steel.
To effect these discoveries, and to guard in some degree against
the designs of the savages, by putting the army on the qui ~vi~e,
was a work of time, and the Adelantado was ahead at dinner
with his treacherous guests, ore Philip do Vasconselos' was pre-
pared to unfold his discoveries. Now,-speaking of things
without regard to persons-the Spaniards were quite as treacher-
ous as the Floridians; and it was with a bitter smile and sneer
that Philip, commenting upon the small claims of the f~prmer
upon his fidelity, said to Juan
"It is liar against liar, serpent against serpent I-what have
we to do with it, boy ~? It were just as well that we should see
them strive together, and clap hands equally to behold thq good
stroke delivered by Floridian or Spaniard I"
But the sympathies of race and education prevailed, and the
white chieftain, with a feeling of unutterable scorn, which he con-
cealed under the most courtly demeanor, suddenly appeai~'ed at
the place of feasting,-to which he had not been invited,~-J-when
all was most hilarious, and the Adelantado as little dreaming of
the dessert which the Floridian had provided, as of any other
good blessing, with which he might profitably dispense. Vas-
conselos, as we say, suddenly appeared within the circle, and for
a moment, quietly surveyed it 'without speaking.

out. The Indians, Everywhere, seized whatever implements they
could lay hands upon for weapons. Some grasped the pikes and
swords of the Spaniards; others snatched the pots from the fire,
and emptied the contents over their foes, while beating them
about the head with the vessels. Plates, pitchers, jars, the pes-
tles from the mortars wherein they pounded. maize; stools~
benches, tables, billets of wood; in the hands of the fierce Flo-
ridians became instruments of war and vengeance! Never had
such a fight been-seen; so promiscuous; urged with such novel
weapons; and so full of terrQr and confusion. The terror and
danger of the scene were duly increased by others yet, who,
plucking the flaming brands of ligktwood from the fire, darted
into the thickest of the fray, shouting like furies, and looking
more like demons from the i~7Ifernal regions than mere mortal
combatants!
Such was the scene and the character of the struggle through-
out the village. The Spaniards recovered themselves promptly
an&amp; fought desperately, and conquered finally; but they suffered
severely. Besides those who perished, many were terribly
bruised, scalded, burnt, and maimed. Arms were broken, teeth
knocked out, faces scarred for ever; the very handcuffs on the
wrists of many of the savages, becoming fearful means of in-
jury and assault in the promiscuous and close struggle, hand to
hand.
ln the hall of the great house of the village where the Ade-
lantado had feasted the ~Dassique, the conflict, though involving
smaller numbers, was no less fearful and savage in its character.
But for the presence of Philip de Vasconselos, and his active
energies and vigilance, Soto, and all the party, must have pe-
rished. The Adelantado, as we have seen, was stunned by the
first desperate assault of the Indian Chief. The latter clung to
his victim, and would very soon have finished his work, but for
the quick movement of Philip, who darted to the rescue, and
passed his sword through the body of the savage, while, tiger-like,
he was tearing the neck of the Adelantado. The Spanish knights,
at this sight, recovered from their consternation, and a dozen
swords were crossed in an instant in the body of Vitachuco.
The furious savage died without a groan, glaring, with fellest rage,
upon his enemies, in the very ~omcnt when his last breath was
passing. The Indians who remained in the hall were dispatched
in like manner, but not before ~hey had inflicted hurts upon the
Spaniards which left their ghastly marks through life. The end
was massacre. Discipline prevailed over rude and ferocious
valor. The people of Yitachu~o, thirteen hundred warriors, the

Tuis event had a considerable effect in restoring Vascon
to the favor of De Soto. The Adelantado could not ungrac
ly forbear to acknowledge a service to which he owed his
life and probably the safety of his army. He, ~ccordi:
thanked Philip in stately language, hidalgo-~ashion, in the
ence of all his troops. But his pride kepthim still in mer
of that haughty reserve of the Portuguese cavalier, which h~
offended his anwur propre at first; and as Philip, while as cc
ously receiving the compliment of the Adelantado, in a styl
dissimilar from that in which it was couched, abated nothing
his own dignity, it followed, that the debt which De Soto
of gratitude, was rather irksome and burdensome, than gr~
to that haughty cavalier. He had, besides, ever at hand,
pering insidious suggestions in his ear, the wily Don Balti
do Alvaro. This knight did not suffer the natural feelings c
Soto to have full play at any time, in his relations to the P
guese. But for his constant labors, it might have been that
was naturally noble in the bosom of the Adelantado, would
asserted itself lo the extent of doing full justice to the men
Philip; and giving full exercise to his own proper courtesy
honor. As it was, the intercourse between the knight of P
gal and the Spanish Chief, though more, courteous and gra
than before, was. scarcely more cordial; and Philip remains
before, companioned only by the page Juan, who clung to
more closely than ever, and grew daily more and more nece~
to his affections.

that the Adelantado, with a select detachment of a hundred
cavalry, and as many infantry, emerged from the great fo~'ests,
with the view to the passage of the stream. The noble river lay
broad before him in the cloudless light of a noon-day sun. On
the depressed position which he occupied, an esplanade of sw~imp,
liable to occasional overflow of the freshets from the rapid rising
of the waters, he looked up to the high banks on the opposite shore
-now of Carolina-and surveyed a prospect before him wit~i un-
qualified admiration. The mighty forest ranges had been scarcely
broken in any quarter; and the gigantic oak, the hickory, the inub
berry, and black walnut, stood up, and spread away in mighty
ranks, solemnizing the scene as far as the eye could reach. Ter~
minating long vistas, rose the rustic cots and cabins of the people
of Cofachiqui, stretching in a half circle, which followed the course
of the stream, and sufficiently nigh to enable the inhabitants to
take their fish from its waters, without inconvenience, to their
homes. Conical mounts, and terraces, artificial areas, consecrated
to religious rites, or public sports and gatherings, relieved, with
the villages, the monotony of the unbroken forest. Upon a bold
promontory to the right, surrounded by trees of the greatest age,
and most remarkable aspect, rose up the temple of the tribe:
a rude but pictui'esque edifice of logs, encircled with pillars,
around which the wild vine had been trained to run. So that the
whole fabric, relieved of all rudeness to the eye, seemed to be'the
handiwork of the endowing Spring herself; a green and purple
trophy, vines, flowers and fruit, worthy tq be the scene of ~nno-
cent rites, and the religion of a pure and simple-hearted pe~ple.
It was surrounded by tumuli-by the graves of ages, overgrown
b like manner with shrubs and vines. In the recesses o~' the
temple, were other treasures of nature and trophies of art.
There, subsequently, the Adelantado gathered heaps of pearl-
bushels of treasure to the Spaniards ;-and there also were found
some melancholy memorials of their own and other Eurojean
l)eople. Shields, and helmets, and daggers, and spear-h~ads,
cast away by the followers of Cabeza de Vaca, or more probably
by those of the cruel and luckless Vasquez de Ayllen, at the
mouth of the Combahee, which, according to Indian computation,
was but two days' journey from Silver Bluff. But we must not
anticipate.
When the brilliant cavalcade of the Spanish Ch\ieftain arrived
at the west bank of the Savannah, he found the ~pposite shore
'covered with groups of the red men, looking out and watching
his approach. The sighs of vigilance and confident strength
were everywhere present to his cycs. The boats were numerous

along the bai~ks, but they were all on the eastern si e of th r ver.
Bands of warriors might be seen hastily arraying these s in
their rude armor, and hurrying,-each as he mad himself r ady
-with javelin, and spear, and bow, to join the c owds t a ga-
thered by the river. Conspicuous among those u on the uks,
were to be noticed a group of six persons, of very noble ( ear-
ance, all of whom had ~passed the middle pen d of hf. To
th~se, great deference was shown, and soon a gr ~t cano , pro-
pelled by several strong rowers, approached the s ot wher they
stood. They entered the canoe in silence, and, a omen a~er,
it shot across the stream to the spot where De Sot had a ri~red,
at the head oC his array. The fearless chieftains of the forest
approached him with a calm dignity, and a nobi grace, jhich

He soon perceived that he stood in the presence of peopl , ~~rery
far superior to those whom he had hitherto enco entered n the
forests of the Floridian-superior in grace and art, f not in~ ~lor.
De Soto hastily seated himself in a chair of state, w ich he rried
with him for occasions ~like the present. The deput tion of l~iiefs
made three references as they drew nigh,-one to the a~t, a
second t~ the west, and a third to the Spanish Chi ftain. hen,
they spoke through one of their party, a lofty and enerabi i~an,
whose brow and hearing declared for habitual aut rity, a d the
consciousness of power. He demanded briefly-

Philip de Vasconsolos interpreted, and reported he ans~w e for
the Adelantado in the language of Cofachiqui.
"For Peace! we are friends. We ask only for a free p s ag~
through the lands of your people, and their help, with rat and
43anoe, in crossing your big rivers. We will pay r these elps
in goods of our country."
A long and pacific conference~ followed. The red en we e too
well assured of their own pqwer to dread the s all an of
strangers before them. They knew not of the fe rful w ons
which they bore, and the powerful arts which t ey poss sed.
At the close of the conference, the Chief of the eputati n re-
peating his friendly assurances, said that he mu recei e the
commands of Co~alla, the young Queen, his mistr ss. S was
young- had but lately assumed dominion over t em, an hey

this princess, she would do all in her power to pr mote t e ob-
jects of the strangers.

THE PI~INCESS COCALLA.         407

They did not err in this conjecture. Perhaps, their own report
prompted her compliance, or, at all events, provoked her curi-
osity. It was nQt long after their return to the settlements, when
the attention of the Spaniards was drawn to shows of great bus-
tle and preparation along the opposite shore. The crowd con-
tinued to gather. There were sounds of conchs and the oc-
casional clamor of rattle and drum, regularly timed, and s~gnifi-
cant of a gathering and a march. While the Spaniards ~azcd,
~curious and anxious, a procession was beheld emerging from the
woods, in the midst of which, seated upon a sort of palar~quin,
and borne upon the shoulders of six able men, was the form of
a young maiden; who was readily conceived to be the Princess
of the country. The palanquin was wreathed with vines and
flowers, and gay streamers of stained cotton floated above it on
every side. The cushions upon which the damsel half reclined,
rather than sat, were spread with robes of the same richly dyed
material. She was clad in similar stuffs, but of finer quality,
and rich fringe depended from her skirts and shoulders. 11cr
hair, black as ebony, and glossily bright, floated free, but wa~
woven thick with ropes of pearl; frequent strands of pearl en-
circled her neck, falling free upon her bosom. Her sandals
~rere also sown with pearl, and she wore anklets of the same
precious decorations. Numerous young girls, tearing baskets.of
flowers, and habited like herself followed in her train; and she
was attended by goodly bands of spearinen and archers, all
richly and picturesquely habited, and equally prepared for action
and display. Before her, went several musicians, who blew the
conch, shook the rattle, beat the drum, and played upoii a rude
sort of syrinx made of reeds, which gave forth a long succession
of sweet but melancholy sounds. Others kept pace close besk~e the
litter, whose office it was to wave before her huge fans of parti-
colored feathers, the plumage of the wil~I birds of the Floridian,
gathered from all quarters, and wrought with an art which leaves
the modern fan of Europe but little of superiority to boast.
In this state, the Spaniards were allowed to behold her pro-
gress through the forests for awhile, when she suddenly disap-
peared in its deeper recesses with all her train. But her disap-
pearance was for a brief space only. Very soon a great canoe,
of the largest size and most magnificently decorated, with cush-
ions, and canopies, and broad fringes and streamers of richly and
variously stained cotton, was seen to emerge 'from the mouth of
a creek that ran close beside the promontory on which stood the
sylvan temple of Cofachiqui. In this canoe, under the canopy,
reclined the princess in the stern, upon a pile of cushions. She

was attended by eight beautifi4 girls, only less richly]
than herself. Her barge was accompanied, or rather
another ~f like dimensions, in which sat the six chieftain
had constituted the deputation. A cloud of, can es, of a]

PHILIP IN PAYO2R.

"Such gifts, beautiful Co9alla, are only for a great chief. to
wear. Jn~ the noble person who sits in the chair of state, y u
behold the great chief of Our people. He will be proud to w ar
the pearls of the Queen of Cofachiqui."
She looked reproachfully at the knight of Portugal, and s ill
hesitated, the pearls hanging from her hands. IDe Soto had b-
served her movements keenly. He suspected the truth.
"What says she, Don Philip 'e" was his stern and sudden qu s-
tion to the knight.
It was with a blush that Philip felt the necessity of evad~ g,
or suppressing, the truth.
"The princess would bestow upon the Adelantado the pea Is
which she carries in her hands, but fears to violate decoruni. S e
would have me bestow them; but I have counselled her t at
the honor will be more graciously felt, if she will make the g ft
with her own hands."
"Thou art right," was the reply of the Adelantado, and he p-
proached more closely and bowed his head. Slowly and rel c-
tantly still, but obeying the sign made by Don Philip, t e
princess cast the heavy strands over the shoulders of the Adel n-
tado, who, seizing her hand as she did so, passed a rich gold ri g,
with a ruby, over one of her fingers.
With this ceremonial, the conference ended. The princess h~d
complied with the desires of the Spaniards. Her boats conveyed
them across the river; her people brought them provisions; s~ie
received them in her village with favor; and, for a season, the~e
was nothing but mutual pleasure and gratification among the
parties. The Spaniards were delighted with the grace and beau y
of the queen, at which they greatly wondered; and she, as w 11
as her people, was equally charmed with the curious strange $
who brought with them so many strange and charming objec s.
In particular, she thought long, and dwelt much, to her attendant s,
upon the handsome warrior, whose voice was so sweet with n
her ears. She likened his speech to that of the 'trick tongue' (t e
mock-bird), when it is the season for him to seek out a mate, at d
win his favorite by the pleasing of his song.
But Philip retired 'to sad, rather than sweet thoughts and
cies. That night, as he sat at his evening meal beneath a tr e,
with Juan in attendance, he was unusually sad and spiritle s.
Juan was very gloomy, too, but made an effort to revive t e
spirits of his master. He was curious, too, and he chose for Ws.
subject the beautiful queen, who was the topic of universal eul
gium among the Spaniards.

with his-face buried in the long grasses of the plain.

AT first, nothing could exceed the mutual satisfaction o~ the
red men and the Spaniards in their commerce and commu ion.
The latter delighted their simple hosts with gifts of curiosity and
use, which were at-once new to them .and serviceable. Th~ In-
dians, on the other hand, stript their houses and persons, and 4ven
their graves, of the pearls which they possessed in great q an-
titles, to glut the desires of the strangers. To these gifts were
added others which still further aroused the cupidity of oni ad-
venturers. Bits of gold and silver were mingled with their
spoils, prompting a thousand curious inquiries as to the region
whence they came. When told of the provinces of Xualla and
Chalaque, where the gold grew, De Soto resolved upon the ex-
ploration of these regions also. But he proposed awhile -to re-
main where he was; satisfied that he was even now in a worl1 of
great mineral treasures. The very appearance of the blufl of
Cofachiqui, shining with isinglass and mica, led to dreams of sil-
ver ore, which, a few bits found along the shore, seemed gre tly
to encourage ;. and while he remained in this neighborhood, he
actually undertook the prodigious toll of cutting off an elbor of
the river, and turning its water for several miles, in order to lay
bare the bed of the stream for the possession of the pree~ ous
treasures which were supposed to pave it. The proofs of this
great labor, pursued with stern industry and a large bod of
workmen, for awhile, are still to be found in the canal, sh wn
to this day in these precincts, and which still goes by the nam of
the Spanish Cut. But the Adelantado was compelled, tho uh
reluctant, to dismiss this pleasant fancy, and abandon the painful
labors to which it led, His silver proved to be even less valu-
able than lead. It crumbled away at his touch. Better accoi nts
reached him from the interior ; accounts which we now know to
have been strictly true.
Meanwhile, the pleasant relations between the red men nd
the white underwent a change. The Spaniards soon bega4 to
show the simple natives the sterner aspects of their charade er.
Their eager, grasping, despotic temper, began to manifest it elf,
as they grew more confident in their position, and more fam'liiar

Before Philip could reply, his page Juan, with aspect gloomy
and anxious, suddenly entered the apartment, and after a hurijed
obeisance, said-                                    I
"Seflor, your presence is needed without. There is troUble.
The Indians are arming and surrounding some of our pe~pie.
There have been blows already betWeen them, and there is an-
ger of insurrection."
"I must see to this I" said Vasconselos. In a f~~w words he
conveyed to the Princess what he had, heard from Juan, and
hurriedly took his departure. Juan was about to follow, 'when
the Princess beckoned him, and throwing a rich .robe of furs u~pon
his shoulders, itiotioned him to accept it, in a sweet and gracious
manner. But the boy shook the garment from his shoulders, ~and
with a single glance, of a strange and almost savage sternnes~,at
the noble giver, wheeled about and hastily followed his lord.
The Princess was confounded at this treatment. She had~ be-
stowed the gift upon the boy as she had beheld his devotio~ to
his master. It was a tribute prompted entirely by her regard for
the latter. She could not conjecture the meaning of the bo~$, or
the dark and savage look which he gave her; and the rejection of
her gift, apart from the manner in which the thing was done, ~vas
itself an insult. She expressed her wonder, in her own languiige,
and hastily summoned her attendants. These had hardly rAade
their appearance, when one of her grave and venerable forest-
councillors entered also. His brow was full of trouble. 1-Je
hurriedly confirmed the report which she had just heard from
Vasconselos, of the difficulty between her people and the Spa-
niards, and, anxiouS about the resultL she hurried forth also '~ivith
the aged chief; in the hope, by her presence, to quiet the aroused
passions of her subjects.
When Philip de Vasconselos appeared upon the scene of ~om-
motion, the conflict seemed inevitable. The red men were arm-

seemed so easy to destroy? The moment had arrived,
for the assertion of their strength and independence!
The moment was inauspicious for De Soto. O~ie half
forces had been dispatched in different bodies, and directj~i
the exploration of the country. Nuno de Tobar was pr
fifty miles off; with a select body of forty horses, on the ro
Achalaque. Juan de Anasco, with a similar force, was a~v
another route. So was Gonzalo Sylvestre; so was Andi
Yasconselos, with his Portuguese, and other knights. T
mains of the army, with De Soto, at the moment 6f comm
were scattered along the river banks, or in the forests, fishi
fowling. Unless he could quell the commotion Without ti
treme of struggle, without absolute violence, he was in dang
being utterly destroyed. The princessof Cofachiq~ii could
several thousand warriors into the field. It was under the~
cumstances that the Adelantado hurried forth, as Philip de
conselos had done, in order to interpose his person ~ind auti
for the prevention of the strife. It was here that he showe
resources of a good head and a long experience. To th4
prise equally of his own soldiers and the i~ed men, he sei
cudgel and began to belabor the Spaniards, seconded in the
ration most heartily by Philip, who had reached the sce
~ season for this proper, if not pleasant exercise. The pri
appeared at this juncture, and clapped her hands with a soj
girlish delight, which contributed to the success of De S
policy. The chiefs and sages went ai pongst their 'I~arriors
words of counsel; and the outbreak was quelled almost as
as it had taken place. The red men retired to their w
hardly satisfied, but subdued, they knew not well in what I
ner. The Adelantado escorted the princess to her dwelling,
partook of a feast which she had prepared. For the moi
harmony seemed restored. l3ut it was a hollow amnesty. T
were wounds that rankled on both sides, and refused ~o be he~
Pride was at work equally in the hearts of the Spaniards
red men; and passions, of even a worse order, which the arti
of both only labored to conceal-.not overcome.
That night, the Adelantado called a council of his chief off
at his quarters. Philip de Yasconselos was present with
rest.
"1 have summoned you, Sefiores," said De Soto, "that
may confer together as to the policy before us. You have
to-day what is the temper of these savages. For some days]

exertiOnS, we scarcely get an adequate supply, and the return of
the several parties, we have sent out, will find too many mouths
for our granaries. The princess, herself, no longer looks on~ us
with friendly eyes. She treats us coldly; she denies hers~l~
sometimes, when I seek to see her; and there can be no quest~ on
that she looks upon our continued presence with dislike. Sp~ak
fbrth, Se~orC5; declare your opinions freely, and say what is cfL
to us in this condition of our afihirs."
there were many speakers, to all of whonkthe remarks of the Ad-
chmtado furnished the key-note. All w'ere agreed that the qu en
and her subjects were changed in temper towards them; thart it
was evident they were regarded no longer as grateful guests, ~u t
as burdensome and offensive intruders. But no one sugges~ted
the course of action. They all well knew that, while De oto
listened patiently to all, he followed no counsel but his own~ or
that to which he fully inclined himself. Vasconselos ,alone Was
silent.
"We woubi hear from Don Philip," said De Soto, with a s lie
which had in it something of a sneer. Philip quietly and
promptly answered.
"There is no question but it is true that these people arc t~ red
of us. We have worn out their patience. We have consu~ ed
their provisions, occupied their houses, controlled and commanded
their labor, enjoyed their hospitality to the full extent of theiil re-
'sources; and in return, have beaten and despoiled their men and
women, and shown ourselves very ungrateful for all that they
have done with us. For my part; I only wonder that they pave
tolerated us so long. The admirable drubbing which your Ex-
cellency administered this day to some of the runagates who ~iave
turned the hearts of this siniple people against us, was quits as
much due to justice as to good policy. It might have been w~ll to
have administered a little more of it, and to a score or two of
other offenders."
"Well, but admitting the truth of all this, Seflor Don Phi ip,"
responded De Soto, rather impatiently,-" the question is, hat
are we to do,-how repair the evii-.--how put ourselves in ecu-
rity against such mischance as had so nearly befallen s to-
day ?"
"The question is an embarrassing one, your Excell ncy,
and, perhaps, were better addressed to some of your olde and
closer councillors. The solution of it will depi~nd upon yo r ob-
jects. Why should we linger here? The silver which we l~oped.
to gather from these banks of earth turns out a delusion. The

The young Indian Chief whom we sent to her with a message,
slew himself rather than approach her after he haa been fort~?d-
den; and I am sure that we should have lost the favor of the
Princess here, but for the spechif regard which possesses her s~ul,
in behalf of one ofus. How long this will secure us is a probWm
which we shall soon be able to solve, if it be true that the nati'~'es
are out of provisions. Now, we are all agreed to depart frod~ia
region in which we shall find famine only instead of gold; nd
we are agreed also, that we may have to fight our way at every
step, and get our provisions only at the end of. our weap ns.
Well, with your Excellency's leave, we are in precisely the sa e
strait with those great men, Hernan Cortez and Francis Piza ro,
and I see not that we can do better than adopt their policy."
"What policy ?" quoth the Adelantado.
"That of seizing upon the sovereign of the country, and making
her a hostage for the good behavior of her people. This P~in-
cess of Cofachiqui is in your power. Her people hold her in~ an
esteem little short of reverence. Seize her, keep her in ckse
custody, under watchful guardianship, and you secure the g~od
conduct of her people. You are required now to traverse hun-
dreds of miles over which she possesses acknowledged sway: as
you pass west, if, you need to do so, you are told that she is
closely allied to the great powers of the Apalachian, the Alaba-
mous, the Me~hachebe! What follows? The people, in all these
places, obey her decrees, bring provisions, bear burdens, submit
without blows: The policy of Cortez and Pizarro must be 1~hat
of Ilernan do Soto, if he hopes for like success with these heathen
savages. It is the only policy for safety."
"And I deem it a base and horrid policy, Sefior !" cried Vas-
conselos, rising, and speaking with all the warmth of a noble
and ingenuous soul, shocked at the cold cruelty and baseness of
the counsel given. "0! Don Hernan de Soto, beware how you
stain an honorable fame, by the adoption of a policy so shame-
ful, so shocking, so dreadfully ungrateful. This young Princess
has received you with highest honors, has treated you with unva-
rying kindness, has yielded from her. stores all that she possesses.
As a Christian gentleman, and loyal cavalier, you cannot follow
counsels which shall violate every trusted virtue, every security
of feeling and of honor."
The brow of Do Soto darkened terribly.
"You employ strong language, Don Philip do Vasconse~os;
but you may have special reasons for doing so. You, at kast,
would seem to owe special favors to this dusky Princess.~~

The pale cheeks of Philip reddened, but he was silent The
Adelantado proceeded:
"But our obligations are general only, and shared with 1 the
chiefs of my army. You hear how they express themselves , and
what they counsel. In great necessities, nice scruples are ~cious
impediments, and we may not apply to great embarrassed. tis the
principles we submit to when the currents of life flow sm ~thly
on as, we would have them, under ordinary laws. I ho 5i the
counsel of IDon Balthazar to be the only 'means of esca ~ and
progress in this our emergency. It is our necessity, whi~ we
cannot escape."
"0! say not so, your Excellency-" began Philip d4~ Vas-
conselos, but the truncheon of the Adelantado came do4wn heavily
upon the table,-and he thundered out-.
"We have decided, gentlemen-we are resolved-the c ~inci1
is dissolved, We shall see to these things with early mo fling.
Be you each prepared, in armor, to second all my orders."
The council dispersed, each to his own quarters, all leavi g the
Adelantado, except Don Baithazar, who had other matt ~s to
insinuate when he did n9t counsel. Philip de Vasconselos, gr ~ived
to the heart, retired to his lowly lodgings, where he sat do#ito
his silent supper, of which he scarcely ate, attended by Ju~n in
silence.
"0! boy, boy 1" he exclaimed, suddenly-" thou little know-
est, boy," he proceeded-" b~ft if the heart of woman be ~cu-
rably false, that of man is terribly base! If her heart be '~eak
as water, his is more hard and unfeeling than the pitiless iock.
I am sick, Juan, very sick of all things that live !"
And the supper was pushed away; and the knight threw h~m-
self on his couch of reeds and brush, under. the roof of his sii~ple
Indian lodge which had given him shelter, and he felt to wl~t a
base use his ruler had put all the benefits of the simple and
finding red men,, and their sweet and lovely sovereign. And Jirlan
lay between~ two rustic pillars, in the 4iade, half watching the
words of his master all the while. And he drowsed while watch-
ing: but Philip slept not. ile could not sleep because of too
much thought, and long after midnight he arose, and he mutt9red
to himself-
"It shall not be! I will prevent this dreadful treachery !'~
And he stole forth even as he spoke, carrying his sword be-
~ea.th his arm, and he made his way, amidst the dim woods,
gUided only by the starlight, and certain scattered fires o~ the

false, and -"
I The threat was unspoken, or was sufficiently expressed is-i the
angry gesture, and the heavy stroke with which, with clenched
fist, he smote the rude table at which the parties were s~ated.
In a little while after this, Don Balthazar took his leave.
lie proceeded almost instantly to collect a select body 4~f his
followers, all armed, for the capture of the Princess Co9alla.
This labor occupied some time. He had to move with al~ pre-
cautions, rout up soldiers who were sleeping, and hunt up others
who, were scattered; and this brought him to a tolerably lat~ hour
in the night. By that time Philip de Vasconselos had already
proceeded on his generous mission, of arousing the Princ4ss to
the necessity of flight, and ere Don Balthazar had set his little
squ~d in motion: but the latter was not delayed much longer.
Still, the Portuguese Knight is in season for his object, if there
should occur no embarrassments.
It was no small one, however, that of finding access 1~o the
Princess. She occupied a centre mansion, rude enough fo~ roy-
alty, so far as we refer to the agencies of art, but a most royal
abode if we look only to the natural accessories. That great
home of forest oaks, and hickories, and walnuts, towering ~asses
of wood and shrubbery-a mighty colonnade of gigantic forms,
conducting through numerous airy avenues to the lowly mansion
of logs, surrounded by a shady roof of thatched poles,-a~ am-
ple verandah of green, surrounding the habitation, which nestled
in the great shelter of the ancient forest-was an abode or an
Emperor. In this verandah slept a score or'more of wa~'riors
always ready, armed with feathered shaft, and flint-headed spear,
and obsidian bludgeon, stone tomahawk and knife of flint No
Emperor ever possessed subjects more faithful and devote&amp; The
space of forest surrounding the abode of the Princess was filled
up with scattered parties of other warriors, who slept b neath
the trees when the weather was fair, and who kept watch from
hidden huts, when the storm descended. They were as vigilant
as faithful.
Hardly had Philip de Vasconselos entered the tabooed pre-
cincts, when a dozen spears were at his breast.
"Lead me to your queen," he said in calm, but commanding
accents-~-~" she is in danger. I must see her."
A brief and rapid consultation ensued among the forest watch-
ers. The result was favorable to the wishes of the knight, sim-,
ply as all knew him to be the favorite of Co9alla. l~ e was
scarcely a less favorite among her people. He was conducted

silently through the green glad~g, and amidst the dark avenues of
thicket; the boy Juan stealthily and closely following, Unnoticed

lodge, a conch, which hung from one of the pillars of the veran..
Was sounded by One of the watchers at the porch. A door
opened~ and a Whispered conversation ensued between the guard
and some One within. A brief Space, and Philip was adirlitted
to an antechamber a great hall, indeed, at bue side of which stood
a maiden with a blazing torch. Juar~ remained in waiting with..
out the verandah, anxious to press forward, and trembling with
anxiety, yet dreading what he should behold. But, for awhile,
his courage failed him, leaving his anxiety unrepressed
But a few moments had elapsed, a~er    's entrance into
the hall,                            Philip
when the princess made her appearance She was clad
simple white cotton garden~5 hastily caught up. It needed
little time or effort to adjust the costume of the native prin-
cess. She was followed by a group of damsels, and one or two
matrons. In a few moments after, several old men made their
appearance~ from contiguous dormitories.
There was a joyous eagerness in the face of the brigh~eye~
Co9alla, as she looked upon the knight.
"Philip I" She had learned to call his name very prettily2..
"Philip !" and the rest she spoke in her own language, taking his
hand frankly as she spoke.

"ha! say'st thou! Thou shalt see." And she whispered to
her attendants, one of whom disappeared.
"The princess must fly to the deep forests," continued Yas-
conselos. "There alone can she be safe from our people."
"Fly! and from my home,-whife n~y warriors are around
me? Never! never !-And yet-" speaking quickly-" Will
Philip g.o with me to my lodge in the great forests.? Will he
become a warrior of Cofachiqui? Say, Philip,-wilt thou go
with me, and find a lodge among my people-and becon~ea
chief-the great chief-the 'well-beloved of Cofachiqui?' And
she 'caught his hand eagerly.
"Alas !" he said, "I cannot, beautiful Co9alla-my lot is Cast
among the Spaniards."
"Then will I meet them here. I will gather my wa~'r~or~.
They shall fight these Spaniards-they shall fall upon them, and
slay them all-all but thee, Philip. Thou shalt be a great chief
of Cofachiqui."
A group of old men entered at this moment, and were ap-
prised of what Vasconselos had reported. They received the in-
formation gravely. They heard their princess as she invei~hed
loudly against the insolent purpose of the Spaniards. She bade
them gather the warriors together, and meet their enemy. She
was resolved not to fly, unless-and she turned again to the
knight-
"Will not Philip go with Co9alla to the great forests her
people, and. be a chief of Cofachiqui ?"
lie shook his head mournfully. The old chiefs interfered.
Philip un erstood all that they spoke, though in low tone~, to
their quee . They, too, exhorted her to take the counsel of Vas-
conselos, a d seek safety in flight. At the moment, they ~vere
unprepared for conflict. Their warriors about the village were
few in nu ber, hardly more than necessary for a body-guard of
honor for heir sovereign. It required time to call in the warri-
ors, and t prepare for such enemies as those with whom they
had to dea, and the terrible resources of which were already, in.
part, kno i to the chiefs. But the princess grew unreason-
able; still recurring, at the close of her speech, to the one bur..
den, in th appeal to Philip-" to find a lodge among, and bea~
chief ove her people-the chief!" The old warriors looked
grave. T ey renewed their counsels and expostulations. whey
were seco ded by the earnest entreaties of Vasconselos. S~u
said to hu~a reproachfully-
"Does Philip bid me go from him where I can ~ee hi~n n~

more '~ Does Philip say to Co~alla-let the forests grow be.
tween us, so that our eyes shall, never meet again? Ah! Philip !"
and she laid her hand, as if with pain, upon her heart. The
knight felt very wretched at the wretchedness he was compelled
to inflict, and a vague but beguiling thought passed through his
-Ahncy for an instant, with the rapidity of an arrow of light.
"And why should I not depart with this true-hearted arid in-
nocent princess ?-She is young. and beautiful, and powerful, and
more than all, pure of thought and feeling. Why should I fol-
low in the steps of those who hate, when I am persuaded by
those who love ~"
But he dismissed the seductive argument with the resolute ex-
ertion of his wilL The very thought of love, and of another wo-
man, while his heart was still so sore with the most humiliating
experience of the sex, was a revolting thought. He hastily ex-
pelled it~from his mind.
i-" Heed not me," he said, "noble Princess :-I am but an in.
sect in thy path. I am nothing."
"Thou art every thing, Philip, to Co9alla. My people will
honor thee for my sake, and thou shalt be a chief among them.
And thou shalp dwell in a lodge with Co9alla, and there shall be
no Spaniards in the great forests where we go. Thou shalt be
a chief of my people, Philip,-thou shalt be the only chief for
Co9alla."
And With these words, in the eager impulse of a passion which
was no less pure than warm,-the passion of a nature wholly un-
sophisticated, no longer able' to restrain her feelings, she threw
her arms around the neck of Vasconselos, and laid her head upon
his breast.. Her long, dark tresses fell like a shower of starry
night over his shoulders.
At that moment, and before the knight could recover himself;
he felt his arm plucked from behind, and the voice of Juan
sounded huskily in his ears.
"See you not, Senor, that unless you tear yourself away f~'om
her, she will not depart? She will be captured, unless you leave
her at once! Already Don Balthazar is; gathering his troop to
surround the village of the princess. Fly from her in season, or
she is surely taken. These moments are fatally lost."
Vasconselos heard, and tenderly but firmly he unwound the
arms of the princess from about his neck. At this act, silently
performed, she turned, with a sudden' revulsion of feeling, and
threw herself on the bosom of one of the matrons, while her
sobs sounded distinctly through the apartment.

"Now now !" cried Juan, in quick, eager accents, as Philip
lingered---- Now is the moment, Seflor. She will fly when you

"You ar right, boy, right!" answered the knight. The hand
of Juan ea erly grasped that of his superior, and led him away
from the a artment and into the woods, without a moment's de-
lay. They were within a few paces of the lodging of Vasconse
los, when t cy heard a slight blast of a trumpet in the thicket
between th m and the abode of the Princess.
"It is th signal of Don Balthazar," said Juan hurriedly. "We
are safe ;" nd he drew the knight into the l~odge.
"But Co alla ~" said Philip.
"She has had time enough for escape if she willed it; but me-
thinks she ould rather be a captive were Don Philip the jailer,
than be the free Princess of all these forests."
There wa something of bitterness in the accents of the boy.
Philip note it, but his mind was too full of anxiety, in respect
to the escap of Oo~alla, to dwell upon minor matters.
"Now m y the Saints forbid I" he ejaculated.
"This. pr ncess seems very precious to the Senor !" quoth
Juan, moodi y.
"As nobi ity, and generosity of soul, and true virtue in a wo.
man, should ever be to every noble knight !" responded Philip,
somewhat s ernly; and Juan shrunk away, as if an arrow 'had
pierced him suddenly in the breast; and Vasconselos heard no
more words from him that night. The boy had gone aside to
bury his fac in the leaves of his couch, and to weep in secret, as
was his nigh ly custom and necessity.

Am~x~R.

THE effort of Don Philip had been made in vain. The Prin-
cess Co~alla gave herself up to a passion of grief; that resisted
argument and entreaty. She became fully conscious of her
danger (of which even the assurance of' Vasconselos had failed
to possess her mind)-of the danger which awaited her, only
when it was too late. It was only. when the shrill blast of the
Spanish trumpet, speaking in signal to the co-operating squad,
and the crash of conflicting weapons, had struck upon her senses,
that she consented to make the attempt to escape. But, by this
time, the building was entirely surrounded, and she was seized
by a group of common soldiers, as she strove to steal away from
the rear during the struggle between her warriors and the assail-
ants. Her people fought despTerately, even the old chiefs and
counsellors, but only to be butchered. The dawn saw her vil-
lage smoking with blood and herself a captive.
The Princess was from this moment kept under close restraint,
well watched and guarded, but treated with forbearance, if not
with kindness. She was allowed a litter to be borne upon the
shoulders of her own people, when she was indisposed to walk.
The Adelantado, for awhile, paid her a morning visit, as Cortez
had done to Montezuma, in which he maintained all the most
deferential externals. She did not reproach, nor entreat; but
from the moment when she became a captive, she habited her-
self in the stern reserve of character so peculiar to the red men
of America, and haughtily refused communion with her treach-
erous and ungrateful guest. But her captivity disarmed her
people. They dared not rebel against the authority whose sim-
ple decree might destroy the head of the nation. 'They submit-
ted every where-submitted as Tamenes, or porters, to bear the..
luggage of the army, and brought in provisions throughout the

They instantly sought, by a vigorous search in the neighboring
woods, to repair the consequences of their fault. Unfortunately,
they had missed the ca#tive too soon after her flight, to enable
her to escape very far. She was found; her followers ~aflantly
threw themselves in the path of the pursuers, and armed only
with sticks or billets, hastily snatched up in the forest, endeavored
to~defend their mistress. But they were immediately butchered.
Co9alla, who had continued her flight, was soon overtaken, and
violently seized by Pedro Martin. The bold ruffian, goaded by
licentious passions, dragged her into the covert, while Gil Torres'
stood by, as if keeping sentry. Her cries rang through the
woods, and not in vain. They called up a champion in the peril-
ous moment.
Don Philip de Vasconselos had not lost sight of the beautiful
Princess who had so fearlessly shown him how precious he was
in her eyes. But he forbore to trespass upon the indulgence
which she had sho~vn him, and, with a rare modesty and forbear.
ance, a delicacy of consideration, which had few parallels in that
day amongst these wild adventurers, he steadily rejected the
temptations which were held out to him by the warmth of her
affection and the confiding innocence of her nature. He stu-
diously forbore her presence, except when specially required to
communicate with her by De Soto himself. In fact, there was
a policy, as well as propriety, in this forbearance. XTasconselos
had discovered that he was watched. Juan, his page, had made
some discoveries, to this effect, and had made them known imme-
diately to the knight. lie was watched by the creatures of Don
Balthazar. This was the amount of the discovery: and there
were suspicious circumstances, coupled with the conduct of Juan
Ortiz, the interpreter, whose jealousy had been kindled, ~nt the
expense of Vasconselos, in consequence of the better knowledge
of the Indian tongues which the latter possessed. lie had lost
som~e of his authority with 'the Spaniards during the period when
the ortuguese knight served wholly as the medium of commu-
nication between the red men and the' white. Ortiz possessed,
however, a rare natural capacity for the acquisition of language,
and, with a strong m6tF~re to goad his industry, in his pride, his
mortification, and his love of ease-.for, when not interpreting,
he was required to serve in the ranks as a common soldier-he
addressed himself to the task of picking up the dialect of the
people of the new~ regions into which he passed. He had become
to a certain extent successful, so that he was now able to under-
stand and conjecture the purport of the' various conversations
between the Princess and the knight, whenever they took place W

public. On 11 these occasions, Co~alla freely gave vent to her
affections, an spoke with Vasconselos as frankly in respect to
her love, as I no other ear but his own could comprehend the
purport of h r speech. All this matter was reported to Don
Baithazar, w 0, by the way, had been repulsed by the Princess
in every app oach which he had made to familiarity with her.
how Juan, t e Moorish page, had ascertained these facts, may
not now be s id, but he had learned enough to set his master on
his guard aga iist the subtle Ortiz and other spies employed by
his enemy.
But though cautious, and avoiding as much as possible all in-
tercourse wit the Princess, Vasconselos watched over her safety
as ten~~rly a if he returned her affection. He had seen the
growing mdi erence of De Soto to the claims and character of
the Pr~.ncess, nd he strove, whenever he could do so without
provoking su picion, to lighten her bonds and soften her mortifi-
cation~. The boy, Juan, was sometimes sent with tributes to
Co~alla, with delicacies which she might not else procure; and
we may add hat, though he obeyed the knight, he yet did so
with some r luctance. More than once he expostulated with
Philip upon he risk which he incurred, by his attentions, and
strove to ala mu his fears; but he soon found that such sugges-
tions only ins ired the knight with audacity. He then ventured
to change hi mode of attack, and would speak, with a sneer,
about the inc paucity of the red woman to appreciate either the
delicacy of' is gifts or his attentions. But to this suggestion,
also, the repl of the knight was apt to silence, for awhile, the
presumption f the page.
"Cease," o e day he said to Juan-i--" cease, boy, to prate of
what thou k owest. not. I tell thee that this heathen prin-
cess is a mor beautiful soul in my sight, than any that I know
of paler blo d. And why shouldst thou, a blackamoor, pre-
sume to snee at the complexion which is more akin to that of
the Christian han thine own? Go to, for a foolish boy, and say
nothing mor in this wise; for verily, sometimes, when thou
speakest thus, I am almost tempted to hold thee an enemy to this
most gracious yet luckless princess; whofn I hold in such e~teein,
boy, and reg rd, that if I had yet a heart to give, or a faith to
yield, to wo 'an, I should prefer to trust in her, than to any liv-
ing beauty in all Spain or Portugal."
Such spee hes were always apt to humble and to silence the
page for a se son. The knight no ways withheld his kindnesses
and protection from the princess, because of the counsels of the
boy. Yet he suffered her not to see that he watched over her;


4~O                VASCONSELOS.

and now, when the passions of the rude and licentious rufilan
Pedro Martin had dragged her into the deep thickets, and she
shrieked aloud in her last and worst terrors for a champion to
save her, she had little reason to think that the chief whom she
loved before all, would suddenly appear to her rescue.
Philip de Vasconselos was fortunately at hand. He heard
th~ cries of the captive princess. He recognized the voice, lie
knew the present licentious moods of the Spaniards. He had
denounced, as a terrible crime, that requisition upon the Cassique
of Chiaha, which had outraged his people, and driven them away
to the shelter of the woods. His instinct instantly conceived the
danger of the princess; the neglect and disregard of De Soto
tending to encourage the audacity of those who were appointed, to
watch over her. He called to Juan, and hurried with sword
drawn into the thickets. He was suddenly confronted by Gil
Torres.
"It is nothing, SeAor Don Philip, but the cries of the heathen
woman, the Princess of Cofachiqui, who has been seeking to make
escape from us, and whom my comrade, Pedro, has just se-
cured."
"Stand aside, fellow.-I must see this comrade of thine."
Martin raised his lance, and caught the knight by the wrist to
detain him. With one blow of his gauntletted fist, Vas~onselos
smote him to the earth,-where he lay senseless. Philip hurried
into the thicket, where Co9alla still struggled with all her might
against the brutal assailant. But she was almost exhausted.
She could no longer shriek. She could only oppose. Her long
black hair, which swept the ground, was floating dishevelled, her
garments were torn, her 'hands w&amp;e bloody. At this periloi(s
moment she saw the approach of the knight of Portugal. She
knew him at a glance. She could only murmur, "Philip," and
her strength failed her. She sank down senseless. At the sight
of Vasconselos, the ruffian fled.
The knight raised the princess from the ground.
"Bring water,-Juan."
The boy obeyed, bringing the water in the knight's helmet,
which he threw to him for the purpose. He dashed the face of
the princess with the cooling sprinkle, lie poured the grateful
draught into her lips. She opened her eyes. They lightened
with joy. She threw her arms round his neck, and cried-
f~ "Philip! 0 Philip !"
"You must fly," he said-." fly, Co~alla. Do not waste the
precious moments now. It is your only chance. Use it. I will
keep off these villains."

He shoo himself free from her, and darted away. She stood
mournfully looking at him for a while, then waved her hand to
him, and cr ed-
"Philip! Philip I"
He disappeared in the opposite woods; and she turned away,
with claspe~l hands, and moving with slow footsteps, bending
form, and a very mournful aspect, murmuring as she went, the
one word" ~Philip." She too was soon buried, out of sight, in
the she1terii~g bosom of the mighty forest.

CHAPTER XXXIX.
"There is my pledge! I'll prove it on thy heart,
Ere I taste bread, thoti art in nothing, less
Than I have here proclaimed thee."
KING LIIAR.
WRaE these events were in progress, in and about the precincts
of the Indian town of Ohiaha, Hernando de Soto was absent from
the place. He had led a portion of his forces in pursuit of the
fugitive red men, who had left their village in consequence of the
brutal requisition to render u~ their women; and a report of the
gathering &amp; a large body of the savages, in a hostile attitude,
not far ofi; had aroused all the eager fury of the Spanish govern.
or, to pursue and punish them. He had pursued with his
*       usual energy, but without encountering the subtle enemy, who,
when they pleased, could readily cover themselves, in such peu-
fect concealment in the deeper forests, that the whole army of the
Adelantado could never ferret them out, or bring them to battle.
Dc Soto rested his troops, after the fruitless pursuit, in a be~uti-
ful wood, about half a day's journey from the town of Chiaha.
Here he waited the return of certain of his officers, whom he had
sent on exploring journeys higher up the country. Nuno de
Tobar was thus absent with twenty lances: Andres de Vascon.
selos had been sent forward with hi&amp; 'ortuguese, to feel his way
along the banks of the Coosaw, and to prepare for the~ coining
of the army. There were a few other leaders of the Spanish
host, who, like these, might have had sympathies with Philip de
Vasconselos, who were also most inopportunely absent.. There
was probably some design and management in an arrangement,
which, at this juncture, removed from the neighborhood the few
persons who might have resisted the perpetration of a cruel wrong,
and brought back the moods of Dc Soto to such a condition, as
would, at least, have tempered the seventies which he might else
suppose were required byjustice.
The star of Don Balthazar de Alvaro was, at this moment,
completely in the ascendant. He had been left in charge of the
village of Chiaha, when Dc Soto undertook the pursuit of the
fugitive Indians. It was his task to assign the guards to the
Princess of Cofachiqui; to regulate and control, in fact, all the
operations within his command, according to his own discretion.
(432)

MALICE GI~OW~ EXULTANT.               4~3
It was no~ the purpose of De Soto to return to the village,
but to proceed Qnward, following the footsteps of the pioneer
force of Ai~dre5 de Vasconselos to the country of the Alabamas.
With thi~ large discretion in his hands, Don Baithazar was
not the person to forego the gratification of any of his passions~
The person~ whom he had appointed to take charge of the prin-
cess Co9a11a~ were his own creatures, the most despicable of the
common soldiers of his division. Don Baithazar had been
scorned by the princess. He knew the wild licentiousness which.
at this time possessed the army. He knew the character of those
to whose tender mercies he entrusted her. He might have pre-
dicted the event, if he did not,-perhaps he anticipated it; perhaps
he anticipated other fruits from the epidemic of license which
prevailed among the soldiers. It is not improbable that when he
was found by the ruffian, Pedro, who fled from the rapier of Don
Philip, conveniently in waiting in a lonely lodge on the edge of
the forest, that he himself had prompted his myrmidons to their
brutality, and that he had Qther passions. to gratify, not less wild
and intense than that of revenge.
Great was the wrath of Don Balthazar when Pedro Martin
made his report. Gil Torres, with a bloody sconce, made his
appearance soon after, which confirmed it. The report was such
that, by their own showing, no good Christians could have been
more innocent of vil, or virtuously set upon doing good. !The
subordinates saved their superior from much of the necessity of
invention; and w ere they failed as artists, he supplied the de-
fects in their case. They were prepared to affirm it with due
solemnities; and, hus armed, Don Baithazar smote one hand
with the other, an exclaimed exultingly,-
"Now, SeAor on Philip, I have thee at extremity. Thou
canst not escape m now."
He dismissed th two soldiers. He called up Juan Ortiz, the
interpreter, to a pr vate conference. He had secured the agency
of this simple fello , who was naturally hostile to the Potuguese
knight, as the latte had so often superseded him in that employ-
ment, from which e derived so much of his importance with the
army. Don Balth zar had tutored Ortiz already to his purposes,
while persuading t e interpreter that they were entirely his own.
He, too, had certain evidence to give in respect to the treason of Don
Philip-for this w' s the serious charge which Don Balthazar was
preparing to brin against our knight of Portugal. For some
time he had been oncocting his schemes in secret. Like some
great spider, lurki g unseen in obscure corner, he had spread
forth his numerous silent, unsuspecteA snares, like flue threads,

to be wrought by patient malice into meshes, so strong as to
bind utterly the unwary victim. Hi~ meshes were now complete.
The victim was in the toils, and he had now only to proceed to
destroy him at his leisure.
Furious that the Princess Co~aIla should escape, he was yet
delighted that the event afforded him evidence so conclusive
against Vasconselos. He prepared his despatches with all care
to De Soto. He set forth the facts in the case, and his inferences.
He suggested the course of procedure. He knew but too well
in what way to act upon the enormouss self-esteem of the Ade.
lantado, already sufficiently proWoked with Don Philip, and by
what subtle artifices of suggestion to open to his eyes the most
vast and various suspicions of the guilt of the man he sought to
destroy. Yet all this, though done boldly, was done adroitly,
so that De Soto never fancied himself taught or counselled; and,
acting promptly, on the very suggestions given by Don Baitha-
zar, he yet fancied, all the while, that he was the master of his
own purposes.
He sent hack instant dispatches in reply to those which he
received. It followed that, at midnight, Philip de Vasconselos
was summoned, in most respectful terms, to the quarters of Don
Balthazar.
He prepared at once to obey. Juan, the page, would have
followed him; but the summons of the Don had entreated him
to a secret conference, and Philip gave the boy in charge of his
lodge, and commanded him to remain where he was, awaiting
his return. The quarters of Don Baithazar might have been
half a mile from those of Philip; but the latter tobk horse to
compass the interval. lie went in armor also. Such was the
practice; and, in seasons of excitement, and with doubtful friends
around them, such was the proper policy. But Philip was not
at his ease. His instincts taught him to dread treachery. He
knew Don Balthazar too well to put faith in his smooth accents.
He knew that the latter must hate, and would strive to destroy
him. Juan, the page, had like instincts, and an even better
knowledge of the man than had his master. He plucked the
knight by his sleeve, and whispered-
"Beware, Seflor :-this summons-this man
Philip laid his hand gently on the boy's mouth, and said, also in
a whisper-
"The good knight must be bold, ~Juan, and being so,~ m~ust al-
ways beware that he is not too bold. But to caution him at one
ur of a danger which he must confront, by force of duty, at
'il hours, is surely an idle lesson. Hear me, boy :-do thou
beware that thouneglectest not the duty which I now assign thee.

I have, for a long hile, meditated to give thee a solemn charge,
in anticipation of his danger of death which walks ever, side by
side, with the sol ier. There are three letters, sealed with my
signet, and fAde in silk, which you will find in the little lea-
them case with w ich I travel. When I have left thee to-night,
detach them from this case, and take them into thy own keeping.
They are address , one of them, to my mother, in Portugal
another to my brother Andres; and a third to a lady of the
island of Cuba, whose name-but thou wilt read it on the
missive. These t ou shalt, if thou survives me, in good faith
deliver. All oth papers in the case shalt thou this very night
destroy, as soon a I have left thee, and thou find'st thyself alone.
Swear to me, boy on the Holy Cross, that thou wilt do these
things which I hay bidden !"
The knight held up the cross hinted sword as he spoke, and the
boy, with a convu sive emotion, seized and kissed it. Then, with
a sob, he cried-
"Oh! Senior D n Philip, suffer that I follow thee now-that
I go with thee to his meeting with thy enemy."
"Not so: but will send thee word how and when to follow,
should I not retur before noon to-morrow. For this night, boy,
farewell !"
And he laid h s hand gently on Juan's shoulder, and turned
off a moment aft r. But the boy caught the hand quickly in
his grasp, pressed it fervently in both of his own, then released
it, and turned a / ay. The knight looked at the Moor with al-
most loving eyes.
"Verily," he murmured to himself-" verily, this boy hath a
noble heart and ~oul, and he is very loving; and with ~ucli a
depth of feeling a is seldom witnessed at his years. Where
the heart growth ~o fast, and drinks in so much, it is rarely
destined for long ife. Life lingers only with the hard, and the
cold, and those wh are economical with the affections. The cold
toad, it is said, re aineth-it cannot be said that he liveth-for
a full thousand ye rs, locked up in stone."
Thus musing, t e knight left the lodge, and joined the young
Lieutenant who hr ught the message from Don Balthazar, and
who awaited him a the entrance. They mounted horse instantly,
and went towards he village; but scarcely had they entered the
narrow streets, wh n Vasconselos found himself surrounded by a
score or two of h se, from the centre of whom advanced a Cap-
tain, who said, in tern accents-
"Seflor Don hilip de Vasconselos, some time of Elvas in
Portugal, and now in the service of His Most Catholic Majesty,

lency, Don Hernando de Soto, Governor of Cuba, and Adelan.
tado of Florida, under a charge of High Treason. Yield thy
sword!" !" exclaimed Don Philip indignantly. "Treason!
Where is my accuser ?"
"Thou shalt see and hear all in clue season! At present, I
am commanded to bring thee, without speech with any one, to
the presence of the Adelantado."
Resistance,-even if Don Philip had been disposed to offer
any-would have been perfectly idle. He submitted with quiet
dignity.
"Be it so !" he answered, quietly yielding his sword-." con-
duct me to the Adelantado."
The party set off that very instant. The knight of Portugal
did not once see Don Balthazar until they met in the presence
of De Soto. The wily spider had only waited to see Vascon-
selos fairly in the clutches of the party placed in waiting for his
arrest, when he set off; with another party o1~' horse, bringing up
the rear, and watchful that the captive should find no means of
escape.
It was nearly noon of the next day when they reached the
army. It was encamped on a pleasant plain, overshadowed
every where with great trees of the forest. De Soto, with pride
and passion equally roused, was impatiently waiting for the
arrival of the offender. No delay was allowed him; and the pre-
paration for his trial had been made before he came. A rude
scaffolding, upon which the chair of state had been placed in
readiness, had been raised for the Adelantado. His chief knights
were grouped immediately around him. The troops, horse and
foot, including the parties just arrived,-all under arms,-were
dispersed so as to form ~a half-circle about the dais, in which
every thing ~could be heard and seen by the meanest soldier.
There they stood, in grim array, with burnished weapons, in
mail and -escaupil, banner and banneret flying, and the gorgeous
flag of Spain floating in the midst. De Soto was not the person
to omit any of the blazonry and pageantry, the state and cere-
monial, which belonged to his authority. Seated in his chair of
state, surrounded by his knights, he ordered that the prisoner
should be brought before him.
Philip de Yasconselos, conducted by his guards into the circle,
~ibated nothing of his dignity or noble firmness, as he stood be-
fore the presence in which he could see none but enemies. He
looked around for the few persons whose sympathies and sum

This conviction, which threw him so completely upon God and
his own soul, rais A him, with a strength of will and character, to
face the event, w atever it might be.
"I am here, nder bonds, as a criminal, Don Hernan de
Soto," spoke Phil p, in clear, manly tones, his eye fixed brightly
the while upon th face of the Adelantado :-~-" I demand to know
of what I am acc sed, and that my accuser shall be set before
me!"
"Thou shalt ave thy wish, Philip de Vasconselos. The
charge against the is that of high treason to His Catholic Majesty,
with whom thou hast taken service.~~
"I brand the c arge with falsehood. I am no traitor."
"That ~hall we see. Thou shalt behold and see thy accusers,
and the ~itnesseS shall be brought before thee who shall prove
thy offen~e."
Vascoi~selos f lded his arms patiently, a d looked coldly
around t~ie asse bly, while Hernan de S to, who did not
think amiss of hi own eloquence, descanted in a sort of general
speech upon the affairs and necessities of the army; the duties
of a good knight, and faithful~ubject; the hig trusts and con-
fidence which ha been given to the knight of ortugal, and the
imperative neces ity for condign punishment, erever trusts had
been forfeited, ai the trusted person had sho n himself unfaith-
ful. Philip smil d scornfully, in a bitter moo , as he listened to
certain portions f the speech; and the cheek of De Soto red-
dened as he notic d the expression. His cons ience smote him,
though not suffi iently, when he reflected u on the notorious
slight to which t e knight of Portugal had be n subjected from
the beginning, an how small had been the tru t and favor shown
him.
His speech ov r, he proceeded to his speci nations under it.
"Thou art c arged, Philip de Yasconse os, by the noble
Senior, Don Bal hazar de Alvaro, with havin betrayed to the
Princess of Cof chiqui the secret councils f the conference,
when thou wast resent as a member, and wI n it was resolved
that the safety ~ the army required that w should take that
person into cbs custody. It is alleged that thou didst betray
that conference t the Princess, in order to p rsuade her to es-
cape from our h nds."

"It is true that I did so endeavor to persuade the Princess
Co~alla to escape, and in this was I faithful to my oath of chival.
ry. I were no true knight to have kept silence, when so gross a
wrong was meditated against that gentle and lovely young Prin.
cess. But the council knew my sentiments in reference to that
measure. I did not conceal what I thought, that it was a Iase-
ness which would forever dishonor the Spanish name."
"That gave thee no right to betray the councils to which thou
wert admitted on the implied condition of thy secrecy. Thy
pledged to us- an
faith wa             ,  d the crime, if crime there were, fell
upon our heads, not thine. Thou hast admitted the charge, which
we should ele establish against thee by no less than three repu-
table witnesses."
"It is admitted," said the knight.
"It is next charged that thou didst recently set upon the two
soldiers appointed for the safe keeping of the prilicess, didst as-
sault them wi1th naked, weapons, didst wound one of them, and
put in mortal fear the other, and didst succeed in wresting this
princess from their keeping, so that she has made full escape from
our care and custody, thus depriving this army of all the benefits
which grew naturally out of our charge of her person.~~
"I found the two ruffianly soldiers to whom the princess had
been confided, setting upon her with brutal violence and foul pur-
pose, and as true knight and gentleman, I did so rescue her from
their keeping. I had no purpose~ this, but the safety and inno-
cence of the noble woman."
The two soldiers were brought forward, and loudly protested
their innocence, making affirmation'on the Holy Evangel.
~' Thou hear'st ?" said De Soto.
"1 hear, SeAor. Is it Ijo be allowed to these wretches, thus
charged with a heinous cri r4 e, to acquit themselves by their own
asseverations ~"
"It is thy offence, Sefior, and not theirs, which is now before
this tribunal." Such was t1~e interposition of Don Balthazar.
"And it is in answer to tI~e charge against me, that I do accuse
these ruffians and acquit myself."
"Were such privilege a~varded to the criminal, there would
be no witness to be found innocent," replied De Soto. "Thou
dost not deny the rescue of the princess from her keepers '?"
" I glory in the act too greatly to deny it," was the answer.

CHAPTER XL.

"Take this life
And cancel these cold bonds.'
cY~EBEUKL
THERE was a. markedd and lively sensation throughout the
assembly. The savage and mercenary soldiers of that day were
not wholly insensi~Ae to the courage of a truly noble soul, and,
little loving, as tl~ey were, of the foreigners who had mortified
their pride, on sucti frequent occasions, the Castilians were coin.
polled to acknowledge how admirable, calm, fearless and chival.
rous was the wholc~ bearing of Philip de Vasconselos.
But Don Baltha~ar did. not lift the glove. There might have
been seen a red sikifusion coloring suddenly his swarthy cheeks
as he heard the epithets applied by the knight of Portugal; but,
otherwise, he was apparently unmoved. He answered with a
coQl and quiet indifference, which betrayed the long and hard
training of his political life.
"Nay, Sefor, thy glove is no longer such as an honorable
knight and gentle~nan may lift without stain upon his fingers.
Thou hast not the r~ght to claim the ordeal of battle. This would
be thy right were I ~he accuser, and the only witness against thee!
Then mightst ~thou claim to put thy body as thy word against
mine, and cry upor~ God to defend the right! But such is not
now the case. Thy crimes, partially confessed by thyseli are
also proven by st~ndry Christian witnesses, sworn on Holy
Evangel. I claim the judgment, your Excellency, ".-turning
to De Soto,-" upo~i the arch traitor, Philip de Vasconselos, who
hath betrayed the ~ounsels and the trusts of His Most Catholic
Majesty, given him~in keeping, and hath meditated and devised
still further treason~, as hath been shown by sworn witnesses.
I claim the judgme~it upon the said traitor, and that he be done
to death without delay !"
There was a momx~entary start,-a slight recoil on the part of
Vasconselos, as he heard the words. It is barely possible that he
had not apprehende4l that the malice of his enemies would attain
to this extremity; but, if his emotion expressed surprise, it was
without fear. He looked on and listened~ without other show of
emotion.

Philip de Vasconselos was led from the presence of the assembly,
he was followed, on all sides, 'by glances of silent admiration and
a compelled respects lie was withdrawn, by the guards, while
the Adelantado and his council sate in private judgment on his
fate. Long was the conference that followed. Do~i Balthazar
strenuously urged the doom of death. But De Soto, filled with
chivalrous notions, ~Vas not prepared to yield to the malignant
suggestion. It is pc~ssible that he somewhat suspected that there
was some truth in the charge of malignity and slander which
Philip had brought against Don Balthazar. He had long been
aware of the dislike which they mutually felt for each other. He
said to the latter-
"Verily, Don Ba1tl~azar, this knight of Portugal bath bitter

"When had the criminal other thoughts- of him who declares

"But I somewhat fear that thou hast

cause of that denial, and those words and looks of scorn! He
arose, erect, and looked coldly on his judges. But there was a
terrible glare from his eyes, which made all other eyes look aside!
His lips were now compressed, but big drops of blood could be
seen slowly to ooze from between them, and to form themselves
m beads upon his beard. J4e stood, and for a few moments
there was a deep pause in the assembly. Then, at a signal from
De Soto, the executioner came forward with his assistants. They
passed a halter about his neck. He offered no resistance. He
did not even tuyn his glances upon them, when they laid hands
upon his shoulder. But as they led him out, he looked steadily
at De Soto, and said solemnly:
"A Dios!"
The words were not spoken by way of farewell. They were
in the nature of a citation; and so De Soto understood them;
and a sudden palene~s, the shadow of a presentiment, overspread
hi~ face. But the emotion passed from his soul. The drums and
trumpets sounded. The assembly was broken up, and the army,
forming a grand procession, was marched~ at once to the place of
execution.
And there, the central object of that great array, stern, lofty,
helpless, but resigned, stood the noble victim-resolute to sub..
mit, but not wholly able to conceal the terrible emotions which
racked his soul! There, bound by the degrading halter to the tree
by the hands of the common executioner, he was subjected to all
the details of the cruel and malignant judgment, as we have re-
ported them. His sword was broken, his shield reversed, its
blazonry obliterated, before his eyes! The armor was torn from
his person, and battered with blows of a club; his helmet was
hurled into a neighboring morass. 'And he saw and was silent,
-looking the while steadily upon the Adelantado, with eyes of
a deep mysterious solemnity, that spoke for dread and terrible
thoughts, as well as sufferings!
But when the executkner approached with his axe-when the
prisoner was made to lift his feet and place them upon the block,
and when, one by one, the golden spurs of knighthood were hewn
from his heels by repeated blows, then broke .the groan of agony
from his overcharged bosom, and he threw out his powerful arms
and grasped the stalwart executioner, even as he had been an
infant in his grasp, and hurled him away, staggering, while a howl,
rather than a cry, following the groan, seemed sent up to heaven
-by way of reproach, for that it looked on, and beheld this ter-
rible injustice, while the great eye of the sun peered down from
the noon-day skies, as bright and serene as if all below was as

CHAPTER XLI.
"Had they known,

CORSAIR.
THE army of the Adelantado proceeded on its march along the
waters of the Coosaw, but Don Balthazar ~e~Alvaro returned, with
his detachment of cavalry, to the village of ~Dhiaha. To him was
allotted the duty of bringing up the rear-guard, with the heavy
baggage; and he was required to remain in Chiaha until the
smaller bodies which had been sent forth on exploring expedi-
tions, under Nunb de Tobar, Andres de Vasconselos and others,
should return. Chiaha was the appointed place of their rendez-
vous.
There was an exulting spirit in the bosom of ~Don Balthazar,
as he led his troopers away from the field where he had witness-
ed the degradation of Philip de Vasconselos. lie had triumphed
over his enemy; and there was now no danger that the knight
of Portugal would ever cross his path in the progress of the
expedition. The penalty of his return was death. Don Baltha-
zar would have preferred that this punishment should have been
the one inflicted. He did not, himself; attach much importance
to what he thought the fantastic notions of honor and shame,
which were taught by the laws of chivalry; and, were it not that
the punishment of Don Philip implied his utter banishment from
the army, and his almost certain death, in the condition in which
he had been left, from the fierce fangs of the wild beast, or the
reckless arrows of the savage, he might have been still ill at ease
in respect to some of his securities. In truth, he still had some
lurking apprehensions that Philip de Vasconselos was yet, in
some way, his evil genius; destined yet to re-appear, and con-
front him with that danger which had so long haunted his ima..
gination! With this fear, it occurred to him, more than once,
to send back one of his troopers to dispatch secretly the de-
graded knight; but this was placing himself too completely in
the power of his creature; and he well knew that such a fact,
revealed to D~ Soto and the army, would be necessarily his own

should resume the charge of them. There was one letter which
he would not willingly give up,-the contents of which he dread-
ed, yet desired to peruse.
"It is he-it is Philip !" murmured the boy, recovering, and
relieved of the apprehensions which had troubled him for the
safety of the knight.- "It is* Philip !" and he hastily undid the
fastenings of the entrance. The horseman threw himself off the
saddle at this m
cottage.        oment, and hastily pushed his way into the
"Sefior 1', said the pa.ge, somewhat taken by surprise at .the
manner and hurried movement of the knight, so unlike that of
Vasconselos. "Sefior Philip !" he said, timidly and inquiringly.
"Not he, my good lad, but one quite as good, I fancy !" an-
swered the stranger, grasping the boy's wrist and dragging him
towards the light. In the next moment, Juan identified the per-
son of the intruder. To recoil was an involuntary act, as he
exclai~ned-..
"Don Baithazar !"
"Ay, methinks, my good boy, I should be as well known to
thee by this time as the cavalier whom thou serves. But why
dost thou recoil? Dost thou fear me
"No, Seflor, but
It was with very great effort that the boy was enabled to say
these latter words, which he did with husky and tremulous ac-
cents, the sounds~ dying away in his throat.
"Ay, but thon dost. Yet thou shouldst not. llenc~forth,

I' Nay, but a little towards it. I but sped the progress, and
nodded to the judgment, and smiled on the execution. I put the
arrow on the string and found the mark. 'Twas De Soto that
sped it from the bow !"
The boy clasped his hands wildly together. The knight began
to sing a vulgar ballad then current in the army. There was
something very fearful in the strong glance which the page set
upon the face of the singer, whose every look and tone betrayed
the full consciousness of his triumph. He stooped, while sing.
ing, and threw fresh brands upon the fire. Juan suddenly darted
away as if to pass him; but the knight was not unobservant,
caught him by the arm, as he went forward, and whirled him
back to the corner of the chamber beyond him.
"No! no! thou dost not cease to be page, boy, in the loss of
one master! One but makes way for another; and I am instead
of thy Philip; with all his rights and privileges, my sweet Moor.
But thou shalt lose none of thine in becoming page to me. Oh!
no! thou shalt share my lodge, my couch, an thou wilt, for my
taste revolts not at thy dusky visage, when the features are so
fine, and the good faith of the owner so perfect. Thou art mine,
now, my boy !"
"Seilor! I must go and peek Don Philip !" was the calmly
expressed resolution of the boy.
"Thou wouldst 'go in vain. Thou wouldst find his bones only.
He hath given rare picking to the panther."
"Seftor, I must go I"
"Stay where thou art !"
"If thou hast compassion in thy soul---.----"
"Pshaw! I know not such folly."
"As a knight, thou know'st it is my duty to seek my lord."
"Not when he is dishonored, boy! Henceforth, I am thy
knight, I tell thee! Thy master-in whose hands thy life lies,
even as an egg, which I can crush to atoms with a will! What!
thou pre~endest that thou know'st me not! Thou wouldst not
admit to thyself that I know thee! Does thy imposture~ tickle
thee so much, that thou art resolute not to see and believe ?"
The page, indeed, had seen but too well! Yet he was reso.
lute, as Don Balthazar had said, not to see! It was still possible
-so he persuaded himself-that his persecutor spoke from his
drunkenness, rather than his knowledge ;-and that his ~ecrct,-
for he had one-was still unsuspected, or, at least, unknown.
He answered accordingly, with as much calmness of temper as he
could command.         K

We have no such restraints here, as restrained our raptures and
made us fearful in Havana. Here, there is something more than
freedom! Thou know'st the license of the army. Thou hast
seen that it could not save a princess of the people. Suppose it
said to the soldiers, This blackamoor page is the girl whom
Philip de Vasconselos entertained par amour-.and what will fob
low'? I tell thee, girl, in very love of thee, they will tear one
another to pieces, and tear thy delicate limbs to pieces also! Art
thou wise to see this, and to understand how much better it will
be, still to keep thy secret, and to serve me as a page, even as
thou hast served this knight of Portugal ?"
For a time, a strongg despair sate in the eyes of Olivia. But
she gathered strength and comparative composure, while he
was speaking, and when he was done, she said with closed lips
and teeth,-
"I will perish first !"
"Nay, nay, thou shalt not perish! I have done too much to K
secure thee in my keeping to lose thee now; when I have at last
sfi~curely won thee. I have pursued this knight of Portugal, until
I destroyed him, because he knew the secret of thy shame and
n~y dishonor! He is no longer a danger to either of us.-And
thou art won! We are here, alone-in the deep midnight,--

embrace,-shall I now recoil from my possessions ?-shall I
withdraw my claim, and abandon the very bliss for which I have
toiled in such secret ways, and perilled so many open dangers'?
No, my Olivia, thou art now mine, more certainly than ever. It
needs now no subtle opiate to subdue thy senses. It needs now
no future watchful anxiety, to watch the paths, and dread ever
more the danger and detection! Here, we have perfect freedom.
Life means privilege, to take and keep I W~ have no laws but
such as justify the passions; and just now, the passions are the

CHAPTER XLII.
"Now shall we pluck him from his wretched plight,
And make misfortune favor."        Ow PrAY
THE arPny of De Soto marched down the west side of the
~oosa, and were soon buried deeply in the virgin wildernesses
of Alabama. They gave but few thoughts to the noble victim
whom they had dishonored and left to perish in the ravening
solitudes of the forest. To him, the short remnant of the day
passed in such a dreariness as may better be imagined than de-
scribed. Fettered rigidly to the tree, at the foot of which he was
barely suffered to repose in a half-crouching position, Vasconselos
was scarcely conscious of the hours as they glided from daylight
into darkness. A savage gloom covered up his soul, and shut
out the ordinary transitions and aspects of external life from his
vision. In the case of one so noble of soul, so proud of spirit, so
sensitive to shame and honor, we may fancy how terribly intense
were the horrors of such a doom as that which he h~d been made
to endure. We may equally understand how regardless he had
become in respect to the future, from his endurance of the past.
The day passed blankly,. before his eyes; the st~rrs caine out,
looking down upon him with sad aspects through ~he overhang-
ing boughs of the forest trees, with like blankness of expression.
He heeded not, he did not behold the tender brightness in their
looks. He lay crouching, a grim savage, denied the only prayer
which his soul~ could possibly put up in that dreary trial, that of
a manly death, through a fierce and terrible struggle with his
enemies.
And so, hour after hour, in a hopeless craving for freedom of
limb, and the exercise of a mighty muscle in the deadly strife!
and.the hopeless craving became at length debility. Mental and
~phy~ical exhaustion began to supervene. He became conscious
of aspects and influences which taught to his waning faculties the
fear 9f approaching madness. He was conscious~ of an incerti-
tude of thought and sense, which was the most oppressive of all
the painful feelings which he now endured. He felt that his
senses were escaping him, or becoming so diseasedly acute as to
confound his judgment. He felt that he could no longer bring

And the wild savage of the woods,-the most savage, perhaps,
in all the forests of America, the panther, encircled the sleeping
man; and he stooped his nose to the unconscious ears; and there
was a faint murmur of speech from the l~ps of the knight; and
once more the panther retired into his thicket, and the great
vulture, again dropped from the tree-top td the ground. And he,
to~ encircled the sleeper. And once more he spread his great
wings above his head, and he fanned slowly the drowsy air about
him: then Jie sounded a fiei'ce wild note-a great shriek through
the forest-and the sleeper stirred slightly with a lifted arm;
and the vulture resumed the fanning with his wings. But soon
another shriek from the depths of the night was heard in answer
to the signal of the watchful bird; and another followed after it.
And ere many moments there was a family group of the raven.
ous birds about their victim, and each spread forth his wings,
* beating slowly the drowsy atmosphere, and drawing nigher mo-
mently until they stood about the head and breast of the un~on-
scious knight, like so many hooded priests about the corse of
a brother. And still it seemed as if the knight were not uncon-
scious, though unable. A murmur broke from his lips, and ever
and anon his arm was thrown up spasmodically, but only to fall
supine upon the earth beside him.
Again was the child-like cry heard in the forest, and the savage
panther once more issi~ied from its depths, stealthily as the cat,
passing along timorously beside the edge of the wood, and pur-
suing a circling course towards his victim; and this time he came
not alone. He was accompanied by his more savage mate, fol-
lowed by her cubs, and they drew near, whining as they did so,
like kittens that a~~e beckoned to their food. The obscene birds
angrily flapped their wings and shrieked a~ their approach; but
still retreated, and once more lifted themselves upon slow
pinions to- the trees above, where they looked down, watching
the common prey, and waiting for their moment with iinpa-
tience.
Now, could we see clearly the condition of the exhausted
cavalier, we should behold him covered wiiih a cold and clammy
sweat, the proof that there was still a lur~dng consciousness, a
faculty of life, which, though lacking every essential capacity for
struggle and defence, was yet not wanting in the cutest sensi-
bilities of horror. Again was there a feeble murmur of speech
from his pallid lips, and again were his nerveless arms stirred, but
this time uxiiifted, as if striving to defy or to drive away the assail-
ant.

perhaps without his own consciousness-acquired all those
ral laws of travel which the wayfarer in the great forest
hardly forbear to learn. But to these he made: no referee
the present progress. His lessons came t? him through
pulses. They served him as instincts. In ~he ordinary pro
of thought and induction, he certainly c~id not once it
during the long, wild, but well-directed flight, in which we
trace his course.
He dashed headlong through the village of Chiaha, whei'
command of Don Balthazar was still quartered. Little di
cavaliers dream of the bloody fate of their superior. TI
gitive was challenged by the sentry as he entered one
sylvan avenues, and again challenged as he hurried throu~
opposite end into the wilderness again. He heard not t]

was emptied at him as he flew, and he knew not that h

lightened by aspects that sufficiently fill his mind. Even
speeds, he sees, still receding as he approaches, yet still
spicuously distinct before his eyes, the great encampment c
Soto-the amphitheatre of trees and tents, and grouped 501
surrounding and grim warriors presiding in judgment, and a
executioner with bloody axe~prominent over all, and in the~
a noble form, about to sink !-and he cries hoarsely as he

THE MAD FLIGHT.                  463
den-fortunately a light one-resuming a fi ght which, for five
hours, had known no cessation. In this flight the rider had no
terrors-no consciousness of any danger. T e beast had many.
Sometimes he shyod from the track; ~ hile eve y limb shook with
emotion. His keen scent had caught the wind borne to him from
the lairs of the wolf and panther. They, too might have been
upon his track; doubtless were,-but that his flu ht had been ~o fast
and far, and that he seemed to their eyes t carry on his back
a wild terror, with eyes of madness, much mo e fearful than their
own. Of such as these the fugitive never th ught. But, when
the steed swerved aside, he irked him with s ur or -dagger,----in-
dignant-crying out in shrillest tones-.~" Beas ! we have not a
moment to lose. See you not they hasten! ah! Philip, but a
moment more! But a moment !"
And with every word there was rowel stroke, or dagger
thrust, till the flanks and neck of the steed yore clammy with
the red blood oozing forth.
And while the eyes of the rider stared out~ dilating, wild and
red, into the infinite space and vacancy-fii~ ed only with con-
fused and dreadful aspects to his gaze-the daly suddenly opened
the great portals of the world, and the steed Went forward with
more confidence; but Juan saw not a whit i~ore than had been
quite as apparent to him all the night. Nat, he saw less, for
night and darkness, and the solitude, had bee~ favorable to the
creation of such illusions as had occupied his md, and the glare
of day, and the sounds and sights of waking a Tid creeping things,
did somewhat conflict with the mental power o create and make
its own individual impressions.
It was a dreadful ride, like that of Leono~a and the Fiend
Lover, in the weird and fantastic legend of Bi~rger. And, if the
dead lover accompanied not our filfgitive, ther~ were yet terrible
aspects that rode beside, and fearful cries followed on the wind,
while ever ana anon the voice of Don Balth~zar thrilled in the
ears of the page, crying, "Back, you are mhie! You are too
late !"
Then would the fugitive set his teeth closely tether, and
clutch his dagger with determined gripe, amjl hiss through his
shut lips-" What! you have not had enough?1 You would taste
again, would you !"
And so muttering, he would behold. the amphitheatre once
more, wherein Do Soto's knights and soldiers e vironod the noble
victim; and so seeing, the* boy would set on, with driving spur
anew, repeating his hoarse whisper in. his throa The while-" Bpt

page was no longer conscious of the diminished speed of th
mal. His own growing feebleness reconciled him to the
sluggish pace of the beast. But ever and anon he would
out of his stupor with a sort of cry, and using the rowel,
expostulate-" Would you stop now, beast, when we ar
the spot? What, do you not hear him call to me? You kno
voice. Hear! He says-ah! what does he say! But I

And the bridle grasp would relax,-and the form would

graze along the wayside. Then would the rider show a mo
anger, and send him forward anew with prick of dagger, and
ter as before-the poor beast submitting, with the wanted
ity. of the well-trained war-horse, pursuing meekly the b
track until he stood-coming to a full halt-on the very gr
where De Soto's encampment had been made.
Then the page opened his eyes, and was about to smit~
beast and goad him forward-when the rude scaffolding ~
the Adelantado had made his dais-on which had stooc
Chair of State, and where he had delivered judgment-be
suddenly apparent to his glance. With a sudden shriek a

"It is too late! too late!"
He swooned away; while the horse, stepping carefully I

he slaked his thirst. He found tender. grasses in the shady
woods, which he cropped at leisure. And the day thus wore on.
The animal now began to be a ]ittle restive and he whinnied for
companionship, looking round, from side to side, for some one
to approach, and strip off his furniture, and show that solicitude
for him to which he had been accustomed, and which the beast
craves no less than his master.
His whinny made its way to other ears than those of his late
rider. The page still lay insensible, in the shadow of a great
tree; nature thus seeking relief from the sufferings which it had
undergone, and obtaining respite from the fiery stress of thought
upon the brain. Soon, a figure emerged from the thicket, stealth-
ily approaching the spot where the horse had again begun to
feed. The stranger was one of the red men, a subject of the
Cassique of Chiaha. He was followed by two others, one of whom
was a woman. The leader of the party made his way towards
the steed, observing the while the greatest precaution. To the
red mei~ the horse was still an object of terror. He had been
wont, at first, to confound him with his rider. He had thus per-
fectly conceived the idea of the ancients of the East, to whom we
owe the classical monster, the Centaur. Disabused by expe-
rience of this error, he did not yet divest the horse of all those
powers which really belonged to his rider, lie fancied still that
fire issued froig his nostrils. He did not doubt that his teeth
were quite as~ fearful as those of the tiger or the wolf. It re-
quired, accordingly, no small degree of courage to approach the
monster of which so little w~s known, and of whose powers so
much was erroneously thought. But one red man did approach;
the horse seeming so innocent-so gentle and subdued-so quiet..
ly grazing, and altogether inviting approach by the general do-
cility of his air and behaviour. The grasp of the forest hunter
was at length fairly laid upon the bridle of the steed, and he was
a captive.
The red man laughed out with delight. He called his com-
rades to him, and they approached with trembling. He grew
bolder as he beheld their fears.. He encouraged them. He
stroked the neck and mane of the beast, who seemed grateful
and submissive, and they all laughed. And they chattered
among themselves like parrots; until made bolder as he became
familiar, and as the animal continued to crop the grass, showing
himself quite passive, the captor leapt upon his back, and crept
forward to the saddle, and wreathed his hand in the mane, having
abandoned his grasp of the bridle, of the use of which he had no
notion. Pleased with his elevation, the savage persuaded his

comrades to follow him, and his brother warrior leapt ,then
the squaw followed, and as the horse moved slowly fron~ side to
side, cropping the grass, and seemingly heedless of his urden,
but still walking, the simple savages clapped their hai s and
yelled with delight.
But that yell' awakened the destrier to new sensation The
beast knew that he was in the power of his enemies. H char-
acter changed on the instant. His moods, his pa~sioims, re all
stirred with excitement. He threw head and tail alo . He
shook out his mane; the blood of the war-horse was aro sed as
with the shrill summons of the clarion, and he dashed a ay at
headlong 'speed, to seek the spot where he had left his aster.
At the first bound be shook himself free of the squaw, wh rolled
away over his haunches, suffering nq hurt but a prodigious right,
as she settled down in a heap upoi~ the earth, hardly k owing
whether she was dead or alive. The Indians yelled agai with
sudden terror; and the shrill cry increased the speed of t e ard-
mal. Away he dashed with the headlong rapidity of a argc.
The foremost of the savages clung to hi~ back like a cat, w ile he
wound his hands more firmly' within ~e animal's mane. The
other clung to the body of his comrade. Then the animal hrew
his head down, and both of them went over his neck. They
rolled away, on opposite 'sides, quite unhurt, but h ribly
alarmed. The steed flew, as he felt relieved of his burde , and
he was quickly out of sight.
The two savages lay for several minutes upon the ear , not
daring to look up or speak. But as the sounds of the rse's
feet grew more distant, one of them rose to a sitting p ture.
He called to the other in under tones.' It required some t ught
and examination to be assured of the fact that both of the still
lived, and that no bones were broken. One of them wen back
for the squaw. She, too, was unhurt. They were soon bm ught
together, and a rapid consultation determined them to rsue
the monster who had treated them with so much, mdi nity.
Bows were~bent, arrows got in readiness, the stone hatch' was
seized in sinewy grasp, and the two warriors went forward the
woman following at a little distance, and trembling for the vent.
It was a matter of course that the red men should fast n in-
stantly upon the fresh track of the horse, and follow it with
unerring certainty. The beast, meanwhile, had made hi way
back to where the page had fallen, and when the pursuers ' rew
nigh they found him smelling at the hands of his late, ride and
pushing them with his nose. The boy was stirring sli htly.
Suddenly, the horse receded. He had winded the red men. He

dashed back ard, and as he did so, seizing their moment, they
both darted upon the half-awaking Juan, and had seized him
by the arms before he had become fully conscious. The rude
assault brou ht him back to consciousness. He strove to shake
off his capto s, but his struggles were-feeble; his arms fell use-
lessly, unper ormingly, beside him; arid he showed his submission
by signs. . hy should he struggle against fate? What had he
to live for? Why should he dread the death which he now
fancied to b certain?
The red en possessed themselves of the page's dagger, the
only weapq' which he carried. With their stone hatchets
waving in hi sight, they motioned him to rise. By signs they
bade him recover the horse, which he did without effort, but they
were sufficiently wary not to suffer him to mount. The beast
was led accordingly, and the boy proceeded with his captors all
on foot; the squaw having joined them in compliance with their
repeated halloos.
The destrier was now docile enough, following his master.
The page feebly' led him on. But he soon sank down by the
way. One of the red men would have brained him with his
hatchet; but the other, who was the older, and the woman, ~~nt~r-
posed. Th~ latter soon perceived the boy's exhaustion, and
while one of the men went off in search of a spring or .rivulet,
the squaw darted into the woods, bringing back with her, after a
little while, some leaves, and a small round acid fruit. The lat-
ter she squeezed into the page's mouth. The kaves she pressed
upon his forehead. Water was brought in a leaf shaped like a
slipper, of ~rhich he drank freely. In a little while he was re-
vived. When he recovered sufficiently, he motioned them by
signs to let him ride, on~e of them taking the bridle within his
hands. The proposition was a startling one, and led to a long
discussion among the captors, which was finally settled 'by the
eldest of the party, who seized the bridle with the most heroic
air of self-sacrifice, in one hand, while with the other, waving
his stone hatchet, he threatened the head of the horse with sud-
den stroke, at the first suspicious symptom. Juan mounted with
feeble heart and limbs, indifferently, and only resigned to the
wishes of his captors.
And thus the four travelled for six or eight weary hours.
Noon came ~nd went. The sun at length was faintly smiling
farewell over the' forest, at the~ closing of his pilgrimage, When
the Party came in sight of the beautiful river, the Coosa, at the
spot where ~t first acquires an individual existence, from the
junction of the Etowah and the Oostanaula.

t{ere was an encampment of the red men. They co d be
seen in crowds along the banks of the river. But the e es of
Juan were fastened upon a group that 'was gathered ben ath a
'sort of canopy upon the hillside. They slowly approaches this
t3tation. The pages eyes brightened as he drew nigh. S rely,
it is Don Philip that 'he sees, seated upon the ground in fr nt Qf
th&amp;' canopy, while the red men wander about in the back-
ground. But 'the .page doubts. Can it be that the savag look.
ing man whom he sees,-woe-stricken, with matted and 4 ~hev-
elled hair and 'beard,~is his noble master-the accomp ished
knight of Portugal-the man of grace, and stature, and be uty;
of ease and sweetness, and clear bright eye, and generous a~ Oct?
Can he have so altered in so short a space? Juan could sc~ cely
believe. But he had no conception of the change which h had
himself undergone. With a cry he threw himself from the teed
at the feet of the cavalier-
"Oh! Senior! Oh! 'Don Philip "
The knight looked up for the first time as he heard the c y.
"My poor boy, my poor Juan, is it thou, indeed!"
And he took the boy suddenly to his embrace. He s unk
from the grasp: he trembled like a leaf; tottered, and ould
have fallen but that the knight held him up.
"God be praised, Juan, that thou art again with me! I had
feared that I should lose thee forever, my poor boy; and su ely,
Juan, if there be any that I can now love, it is thyself."
He again grasped the page. and drew him to his embrace. The
head of the' boy sank upon his shoulder. His eye was b ight
with tears. The head was relieved. The heart enjoyed a str nge
and sudden sensation of happiness. At that moment his ear
caught the sound of a well-known voice.
"Philip!" said, in the tenderest tones, the beautiful Coc Ila,
the Princess of Cofachiqui; and she laid her hand affection~ ely
upon the shoulders 'of the knight.
"Philipt"

With the big tears gathering in his eyes like great pearls of

MEANWHILE, the Spanish army pursued its progress in o

He had heard of the approaching Spaniards, of their power,~ I
wonderful arms and armor, their strange appearance, an
mystery which seemed to envelop their origin. He was
rally curious to see the strangers, and was too great a pote
himself; and too valiant a chief to entertain any apprehensi
their power. Of their treatment of his kinswoman, Co~alI
had up to this period heard nothing, and his invitation, ac
ingly, through his inferior cassiques, was cordially extend
the Spanish commander to visit him in the recesses of his'
domain. His chief settlements were along the banks of the
which still bears his name-his territories stretched away i
nitely, even beyond the waters of the Mississippi. As the s
gers drew nigh to his royal precincts, he dispatched his son to
them special welcome-.-a youth of eighteen, but tall like hi
~his stature far overtopping that of the tallest soldiers i

his stature,~to compel the respect and admiration of the Ad

But ere the arrival of this youth, as an ambassador, there
some stir in the Spanish camp, in consequence of the treat
which Philip de Vasconselos had received. The return of
de Tobar, and Andres de Vasconselos, led to warm words, a
passion, and finally to a re-examination of the affair. If An
felt coldly towards his brother-and no doubt his conscience
long since rebuked him severely for his conduct, for which his bo
pride would suffer him to make no atonement---his feelings
kindred were by no means subdued. Now that his brother

exile and exposure which followed his sentence, the better nature
of the young man obtained the ascendant, and he felt his error to
its full extent and bitterly lamented the little sympathy~ which
he had shown to a brother to whom he was indebted for the best
training and affection of his early years. Nor was Nuno de
Tobar less eagerly aroused than Andres to the necessity of vindi-
cating the fame of Philip, and, if possible, of recovering and re-
storing him to the army. To this end their earnest efforts were
directed. The woods were scoured where the victim ha~ been
left to perish, but in. vain. He was already in the close keeping
of the Princess of Copachiqui-not so far, indeed, from th~ camp
of the Spaniards~-not so much beyond their reach-but that, had
he himself been willing, he might have been found. But in what
way could it be conveyed to him that he was not pursued with
malice, and that justice should be done to his worth at last? He
might well question the motives for the search on the part of
those from whom he had never yet experienced sympathy or
confidence.
Co§alla and her followers were all well aware of the ncAghbor-
hood of the Spanish parties sent out in search of Philip-nay, he
himself was not ignorant, and he might possibly have suspected
their better motives, knowing as he did that his brother and
Nuno de Tobar were at the head of these detachments; but he
now no longer cared to resume a connection with the associates
who had abandoned him, and with an expedition whose daily pro-
gresses revolted all his human and chivalrous sentiments. Be-
sides, he had been inexpiably disgraced according to all the laws
of chivalry, and there was no adequate power to do him justice,
and to restore his honors. A. savage scorn of all social relations
took the place in his bosom of the centerr sympathies he h~id once
so loved to cherish. A fierce mood~ preyed like a vulture upon his
thoughts, and he brooded only upo~ revenge. This was now the
atoning, the compensative sentiment which he encouraged, ~.nd his
thought was wholly addressed to tl~e modes by which he ~hould
wreak the full measure of his vengeance upon the two whom he
regarded as the principals in his great disgrace, and the bitter
defeat of all his hopes and honor. His thought by day, his dream
by night, found him ever engaged in the hot struggle of the gla-
diator with Don Balthazar de Alvar6 and the haughty Adelan-
tado; and he sat or wandered with his savage associate~, grim.
and silent, following the progress of the Spaniards with e~ye and
mind; a Fate, himself; threatening but too truly the melancholy
doom which attended upon their footsteps.
It was with a gloomy feeling of bitterness and self-reproach that

ence might not have sufficed to confer upon him this authority,
were it not that th~y were instinctively impressed by himself by
the great injuries which had made him the incarnation of that
wild - revenge which the red men so much love and honor, and
by his unquestionable ability as a commander. He, hi~nself,
seemed to take their lead as a matter of course. He neither
asked them nor himself in respect to the matter. He willed, and
they submitted. He pointed with his finger hither or thither, and
they sped. They saw his purpose in his look. They took their
directions from his eye and hand; and there was that of the ter-
ribly savage in his fearful glance, and so much of the sublimely
fearful in the~embodied woe which seemed to speak in every silent
look and gesture, that to submit and obey was the voluntary im-
pulse of all who looked upon the noble outlaw.
The one purpose which Occupied his mind, sufficed to concen-
trate all his faculties. The Spaniards now began daily to expe-
rience the influence of a will and a power which threatened them
with the greatest dangers, the more formidable, as it was still im-
possible to conjecture what shape the danger was to take, or when
and where the blow was to fall. An ominous gloom seemed to
hang upon their hearts. Superstitious apprehensions haunted
their souls-a cloud seemed to hang upon their pathway, in no
degree relieved by the courteous invitations of the great cassique,
Tuscaluza. Weariness, exhaustion, daily toil and march, and
continued disappointments, no doubt combined to render them
especially sensible to such fears and doubts. But there were
external evidences daily offered them which had their effect, also,
in compelling and arousing their superstitious fears. The red
men seemed to have altered their whole policy. They hovered
about the advancing army, but without coming to blows. They
no longer rushed out boldly from beneath the forest trees, in
groups, or single men,~ challenging the invader to the crossing of
the spears. But if they did not fight, they did not fly. There, in
front, and flank, and rear, they might be seen to hover like so
many threatening clouds, retiring into safety when approached,-
not to be overtaken,-.-but still giving proofs that they were unre.
taxing in that haunting watch and pursuit which they had b~gun
from the moment when Vasconselos took command. It may be
that De Soto and others suspected his presence and authority
among the red men, and that a gloomy prescience, and vague
terrors, were the result of this suspicion. To these feelings, each
day added large increase. The Spaniards now longed for the
strife; they felt how much easier and more grateful it would be
to bring this annoyance to prompt and desperate issue, which vexed

Tuscaluza met Dc Soto at one of his villages~, at some distance
from his capital city. lie probably did not design that the
Spaniards should penetrate to that place. But he did not 1no~4
the character of the invaders. The haughty chieftain welcomed the
Adelantado in a truly m~oyal manner, with great show of forest
state, and a dignity which might have 'furnished a model to the
noblest sovereign of Christendom. His immense stature, erect
carriage, haughty demeanor, perfect composure, insensibility to
surprise of any kind, had the effect of awing the Spaniards into
something like reverence, for a season. The Adelantado pre-
sent~d him with a dress of scarlet, and with a flowing mantle of
the same material. These he wore with a natural grace which
showed him superior to the efforts of the artist. With his own
towering plumes, he became the crowning and central figure, of
right, amid the grand assemblage of native chieftains and steel-
clad warriors by whom he 'was surrounded. The Adela~itado
added to his gifts that of a horse also; though it was with great
difficulty that a beast was found sufficiently powerful to endure
the weight of so colossal a warrior;
The courtesy of De Soto, his gifts and attentions we~re not.
nupleasing to the haughty Cassique, and he cheerfully accom-
panied them in a march of three days, to one of his first-class
villages, called after himself, Tuscaluza. This village stood upon
a peninsula of the Ahibama River. The river wa~ crossed with-
~ut difficulty, and the army encamped for the night in a beautiful
valley, about a league beyond the place of passage. There was
feasting and great state for some hours in the Spanish camp, and
Tuscaluza was a guest at supper with the Adelantado. But
when he retired, it was without the precincts of the camp, and
tl~r~ Spaniards, though on the watch to discover his place of re-
treat for the night, failed to trace his progress through the wild
forests through which, with his attendants, he made his easy
way. But there were other watchers more successful, and when
Tuscaliiza entered his sylvan lodge, but two miles from the
Spanish camp, he found the beautiful Princess Uo~alla, his
own niece, awaiting him in the lodge; and seated upon a pile of
bearskins, a stern, silent, savage-looking man, one of the pale-
faced warriors, in whose grim aspect we recognize the once
gentle, graceful, and courtly knight of Portugal.
Co~alla threw herself upon the neck of Tuscaluza, an~ was

welcomed with such a degree of fondness as Wa. consist nt with

THE gigantic and haughty sovereign of the Alabamoi~s
sensibly awed by the stern aspect which encountered him, v~
he turned from the beautiful .Co~t*1la to welcome to his abo~1e
outlawed knight of Portugal. Stern self-possession, calm mi
ible endurance--as significant of the big heart and the unyich
courage-are among the master virtues of the red men. In b
words, Co~alia had conveyed to her uncle the simple outline
the fortunes of Vasconselos, as well as her own, since she
fi~st come to a knowledge of the Spaniards. Tuscaluza had h(

The suggestion corresponded happily with the genius of savage
warfare.
"Good !" said the chief; resuming and shaking the robes, but
without freeing them from the stains which they had already
taken from the earth. When the next day, these stains were
visible to the eyes of the Spaniards, the cavaliers enjoyed a pleas-
ant laugh at the expense of the grim warrior:
"lie drank quite too much of the Canaries last night, your
Excellence," said Nuno de Tobar. "He hath been rolling down
hill, and methinks hath had a taste of the river, which doubtless
failed to relish after the wine."
"Nay, SeiTior Nuno," was the reply, "he walked away with
all the erectness which he showe5Lat the beginning."
"Yes; but did you not see that he never trusted himself to the
back of his horse. It was led off by one of his followers, afid he
strode away on foot."
"Yes; and had thine eyes but followed him as h~ sped, then
wouldst thou have seen that his movement was solid and square,
like a tower. He went not to the right nor to the left, till the
great forests received him."
"Then hath he had a brew of his own ere he slept, for verily.
those stains of the scarlet are those of a man who hath wallowed
upon the bosom of his mother, without knowing well what arms
have embraced him. All these savages possess the art of making
strong drink."
"And upon that thou found'st thy argument for its necessity
and justification. Go to, Seilor Nuno, and let not this heathen
Prince suspect that you laugh at his weakness-if such it be~-for
verily he is as proud and jealous of his state as ever was Lrwifer,
when he had sway among the stars. Away to thy post, and see
that thy detachment be in marching order!, Remember, he is not
to suspect that there are guards upon his person."
Such was the policy of the Spaniards. That of Tuscaluza,
tutored as he was by Vasconselos_ was a few shades more pro-
found. All that night these two chiefs communed together i~r the
hovel; Co§alla, after a while, having retired~ Juan was k~pt in
waiting, but in an adjacent cabin.
We 'design that the strategic of the red men shall gradually
unfold themselves. It is enough to mention here that Philip con-
veyed to the Black Warrior a full idea of' the importance t~ the
Spaniards of their horses, and the necessity of capturing them,
or slaying them. He counselled the latter course as by faK the

the scene of action should always be so chosen as %~ depr'
cavalry oC all share in the battle. It was this coui sel that~ f
determined Tuscaluza to conduct the enemy to o~i of his
towns, named Mauvila. This was a walled town, nd is su
to have stood upon the northern bank of the Alab ma, at
nqw called ~hocta~y Point. The town of Mau ila occ

earth and wood, filled in between great forest tr es; th
being fastei~ied in piles with vines and reeds, and he face (

which hardened into smooth consistency in the sun and air
defenses were slight, of course-such as strong rms an
axes could hew down in short time and through hich th
falconets of that day could have easily blown a cap cious o
But the Spaniards were without artillery of any ki d. Sti
had adequate implements for breaking their wa , if tin-i
allowed them. The wall was pierced with loop-ho es for a

ous towers,. each capable of holding a score of fighting
There were but two gates, one on the east, the oth r on th
side. In the centre of the village was a great squ re, or
ground, around which the buildings were erected. These
exceed a hundred in number, but they were mostly ast fort
capable of containing entire tribes, from five hun red to
hundred persons in each-great halls only, witho t room
red men lodging together as in caravanserais.
To this place, thus constructed, the Black War ior con
his destined victims. He was accompanied by fe perso
tenants, and no warriors. To this he had been counsel
Vasconselos. But he had made preparations els where

So far, all seemed to go as merrily as marriage ~bellsand~e
Soto had 'no cause for apprehension; but he had some occasions
for doubt, when, on entering the town, 'he found that; while ~e,
himself, his officers and immediate attendants, were assigned a
couple of the best houses of the place, his troops were to
lodged in cabins without th~ walls. The great body of the arr~iy
had not yet arrived, but followed on, somewhat too tardily, un-
der the charge of' Luis de Moscoso.
Flanging closely, but unseen, upon the steps of Moscoso-li~e
a gathering thunder cloud that marshals its mighty legions on t~me
very verge of the horizon-Philip de Vasconselos followed with
a force of some three thousand warriors. A dozen times1 as
he tempted by the heedless manner of Moscoso's march to d4rt
upon him with his cloud of savages, and destroy him, if possible,
before he could unite with De Soto; and long afterwards did
he reproach himself with not having done so. Could he have
seen the banneret of Don Baithazar de Alvaro flaunting amidst
the gay array, he could scarcely have foreborne the effort. It
was against Don Balthazar first, and De Soto next, that his con-
centrated vengeance was directed. Neither of these wer~e pre-
sent to stimulate his rage. Besides, he might mar the plot con-
eluded upon with the Black Warrior, by anticipating the desig-
nated moment, and some fugitives might escape on horsehac~,
and convey to the very victims whom he sought, the intelligence
which should enable then-i to guard effectually against'the attack.
hungering, therefore, for the action, he was compelled to control
himself and his red followers-no ?asy task-and which he, per-
haps, never could have done but that he was supported by tl~e
presence and authority of Co9alla, the Princess. She kept clo e
beside him a~ he went, the two followed by Juan, with wild emo-
tions of ft passionate love and anger mixed. The wretched bog!
He, too, had his temptations, and more than once he found him-
self meditating to lift his lance, and strike it into the back of the
beautiful Princess, though with the certainty of immediate dea1~h
himself; that he might end his pangs of jealousy forever. Veri-
ly, they were great, and the tender devotion of the Princess to
Philip, never suffered 4hem to sleep for a single moment. ~t

Sovereign precipitated the issue. They had scarcely entered the
town when he signified to De Soto the abode which had been
assigned him, while he indicated his own purpose to occupy ano-
ther., But the Adelantado replied,.cavalierly perhaps-that he*
did'not approve of the arrangement.
" The BlIack Warrior will remain with me."
The haughty soul of Tuscaluza then blazed out-
" The Black Warrior is the king in all these countries. It is
for him to command. 'It is. for all others to obey. The Spanish
chief is at liberty to depart, but he must not pretend. to say
to Tuscaluza, here shalt thou remain, or thither shalt thou
go. Does sthe Spaniard hear ? Such is the speech of the Black
Warrior."
The moment wais not auspicious for a decisive reply to this
speech, such as, under other circumstances, De Soto would have
given. Tuscaluza waited for no answer to his words. He en-
tered the dwelling which he had indicated as his own abode
leaving the Spanish chief to find his way to the other. Th4t inl
which he took shelter contained a thousand warriors. De Soto
quietly proceeded to the dwelling appointed for his use, andl in-
stantly sent out his officers to go secretly among his troopers,
and command them to hold themselves in readiness for action.
Meanwhile, he resolved, still to keep up4 the appearance of friends
ship and cordiality. Breakfast being prepared, he sent Juan
Ostiz, the interpreter, to invite the Black Warrior to his table.
He was refused admittance, but his message was delivered, and
the reply was civil-" The Black 'Warrior will come." 1
But the Black Warrior did not come. Some time elapsed,
and Juan Ortiz was sent with a second message, receiving the
same answer as before. The same result followed. There wvas
a long delay; and again Juan Ortiz was despatchied with a third
message. -Now, whether it was that the interpreter, vexed at
his repeated miscarriages, became insolent in his tone and lan-
guage, or whether the red men now found themselves read y for
a change in theirs, must be a subject of conjecture ; but, when~
Juan Ortiz, standing at the door of the Sovereign, cried aloud to
his subjects--" Tell Tuscaluza, that the food grows cold upon
the table ; that the Adelantado awaits him, and sends to hinm to
come forth at once,"-then the long suppressed storm broke
ouit in fury. A r'ed warrior, sallied forth to the entrance, crying
aloud, while his eyes flashed fire, and all his face was inflan ed
with anger-.
"Vagabond and robber, begone ! Is it. such as thou that
darest clamor aloud at the doors of a great chief, crying, cohie

blade was ranging through the vitals of the red an, who

tunes of Hernan de Soto. The fate which had be~n hove
like a storm-cloud above his head, was swooping down at
upon his victim.

"Ha I what'shout is this ?"

THE soup of the Adelantado that day was cooled uneaten.
Scarcely had Juan Ortiz entered the dwelling which his master
occupied, and declared his tidings, when the war-whoop rang
throughout the village, echoed by five thousand vigorous voices.
The warriors poured forth from a thousand unsuspectedvomitories.
They slaughtered tl~e scattered Spaniards, as, heedless of their
leader's order, they lounged about street and square. The latter
fought, but vainly. They were driven from the town; numbers
of the cavaliers saw their horses slain, shot down before their
eyes; a loss which they held to be even more serious than of
the soldiery. To slay the horses was especially the labor ofone
large portion of the savages. To this had they been counselled
by their chiefs, under instructions of Vasconselos. Unlucl~ily 'for
themselves, this was almost the only part of his instructions which
they seem to have remembered. But, for a time, their' successes
were too flattering to suffer them to pause. The vanguard of the
Spaniards expelled from their walls, several slain, many more
wounded, more than thirty horses killed outright, or maimed for-
ever, and the whole of the baggage of the invading army, with the
single exception of one knight's effects; these were successes cal-
culated to turn the heads of any savage people, ignorant of their
enemy, and incapable of any true* estimate of the means by which
they had won success.
And such had been the advantages gained by the red men in
their first demonstration against the Spaniard, at Mauvila. They
had lost their general, the fierce hrave who had so summarily
dismissed Juan Ortiz with defiance to his master, and who had
perished under the sudden sword-thrust of Balthazar de Gallegos.
His son, a noble young warrior, had perished also, in the eWort to
avenge his death, but not before he had pummelled Gallegos
about the head and ears with his bow, until the Spaniard was
blinded with his blood, and stunned, almost to perishing, be-
neath his blows. The gallant savage had in vain sent his arro~vs
at 'the mailed bosom of the Castihian knight. In slaying lialf a
score of Spaniards the red men had lost hundreds; but there was
no lack of numbers to take their places, and they scarcely felt

their losses. It was not so with th~ white warriors, 'ho we too
few, not to feel severely the loss of such a large roporti n of
their whole disposable force. The result, whatever he ineq ality
of loss, was a temporary triumph with the Mau ilians. hey
had beaten the invader from their fastnesses, and theyw em
possession of all the spoils of the field. They had also rel ased
the captive Tamenes from the chains of their masters, ha put
weapons into their hands, and thus more than rnajfle up f the
number which had been lost by the battle to their r~nks. xu]t-
ing in the successes which they had won, the red meh closed their
-gates, displayed their spolia opima from the walls, and ru nir~g
to and fro along the parapets, brandished their arm with e ulta-
-tion, while the welkin rang with their wild shouts o triumph and
defiance.
Goaded with fury by what they saw, the Spanish hivairy ith-
-out the walls, organizing themselves, rapidly dashe forwa d to
the gates with the view of assailing them, or, at leas , for the pur-
pose of covering the foot soldiers, who advanced w th their axes
for this purpose. But the brave Mauvilians-too aliant, ager
and exulting to observe a becoming prudence-n~ver su ered
them to approach the gates, but leaping the walls in hun eds,
resolutely took the-field, exposing their naked bosoixis fearl ssly
to the superior weapons of the Castilians. A desperate confli en-
sued: the numbers and reckless valor of the red en pr ving
quite a match for the superior civilization of their f es, whil the
struggle was confined to those who fought entirely on foot. Fi rce,
indeed, was the affray. Mercy was neither asked or expe ted.
The shafts of the savages answered to the lances of t~e Spani ds;
the stone battle-axe and thundering macana did no~ recoil rom
the sharp collision with the polished blade of the Toh~dan. I was
only when~ the cavaliers of Spain dashed in to the support of heir
comrades that the Mauvilians gave ground, and reti~eated t the
cover of their fortress. Thither the moiruted men pursued t em,

walls and loop-holes of the town. As they wavered and reco led,
the Mauvilians again sallied forth, closing with the cavaliers, eiz-
ing on their very bridles, grasping their lances, 1~earing t em
from their hands, and clinging to the retiring horses i~ntil dra ged
away hundreds of paces from the walls. Such a- conflict, val so
inflexible, afforded but small encouragement to the ~iopes of the
invader, and De Soto groaned over the tardy progl'ess of os'
coso, and the absence of more than half his little army.
In this manner had they fought, without decisive re~ults-..u less

Moscoso made his appearance withthe main body of the spanish
forces, and at once engaged in the melAe. But with his appearance
in the field, - that of Philip de Yasconselos took place also.
For a moment let us pause in this place, to say that none of the
relations of this great event, as given by the Spanish and Portu-
guese narrators, are to be entirely relied on. The history yirh~ch the
lion might give of his achievements has yet to be written. The
accounts of the white men are grievously confused and contradic-
tory, for the simple reason that they labored to obscure. to mod-
ify, and even to pervert the details whose results were so disas-
trous to their progress, and, as they fancied, in their natio~~al pride
and vanity, so discreditable to their arms. Now, the reader will
please to understand that our version of the story is drawn chiefly
from the narratives of the Mauvilians themselves, as contained in
the celebrated MSS. of the Great lawa, or High Priest of Chick-
asah, Golena Ithiopoholla, who wore the sacred symbols, some-
where about the year 1619, only about 70 years after this event.
The narrative is written on the bark of trees, in the Choctaw charac-
ter, and, beating some few injuries from exposure and time (which do
not affect it in the portions relating to the battle of Mauvila), may
still be read in the keeping of my excellent red friend Mico Tus-
kina Ithiopolla, a lineal descendant of the venerable Jawa, by
whose hands it was written. Our account of the affair,~ ~rhich we
modestly venture to assert is the only one deserving oP perfect
confidence, is drawn almost entirely from this aticient and vera-
cious chronicle.
To resume from its pages:
"Now had the battle lasted three mortal hours, wher~ another
and a larger army of the Spaniards, under one of their great gen-
erals, by name Luis de Moscoso; made his appearance in the field.
He had been closely watched and followed during the march from
Tuscaloosa by the white chief; to whom had been given the name
of Istalana, and of whose cruel treatment by the Spaniards, and
happy escape, by the help of the great Princess Co~alla, of Cofa-
chiqui, we have already related the account. Istalana (or 'the
chief that broods') led a force of three thousand brave warriors of
Tuscaloosa and Cofachiqui, full command ovei~ whom had been
given him by the Great King. Now, so soon as Istalana beheld
the warriors of Moscoso preparing to join with the troops under
Soto, the Castilian, and to advance against the walls of Mauvila,
he set upon him suddenly, with a terrible assault from behind. Mo-
oscoso was greatly astonied at this assault, for he knew not that he
was so closely watched and followed. But he turned upon Istalana
and his men and made good fight for the victory; and he was joined

by the men upon the horses of Soto, the Castilian, and grea were
the deeds of arms that followed, and many were the blows iven
and received, and glorious was the slaughter. The earth a sun
drank great streams of blood that day; and, for ~ th war-
riors of Mauvila were too brave to need coverings for their
breasts against the darts of their enemies, the slaughter fell most
heavily upon them; while the Spaniards, being covered with
scales of hard metal, or wrapped in many folds df a thici gar-
ment, which shook off the shafts of the Mauvila warriors hen
delivered from a distance, they suffered less gr~evous1y and
many were but hurt and wounded, when, but for reason of their
armor of metal, they would have died outright. But the an-
vilians hurt and smote them sorely, and bruised them with any
blows, so that none of them utterly escaped, while many ere
slain with shafts rightly delivered between the eyes, and, hen
they chanced to turn their backs, with arrows that drove th ugh

Verily, they slew more than seventy of these giant beasts i the
course of the day's fighting, sending the arrows right thr ugh
their huge bodies, so that the feathers only lay hidden in the
bowels of the beast.

"'And they went forth, even as he commanded, with a mighty
whoop of victory, which shook the earth and struck terror to the
hearts of the pale faces. And the Spaniards, who rode the mighty
horses, rushed together, like a great hurricane, between the war-
riors of Mauvila, who came forth from the fortress, and the foot-
soldiers of the chief Moscoso. And they rushed over many. of
our people, and they trampled them under the iron hoofs of the
mighty beasts; but the rest parted each way front before them,
then closed behind them as they sped, delivering swift arrows
that pierced the beasts to the bowels, and pierced the riders to
the brain, so that they rolled together in sore agony, and with
previous cries upon the stricken earth. And even as the War-
riors of Mauvila sank down beneath their beasts, other braves
darted hotly forth to take their places, and it gladdened the big
heart of the great king that day, to behold with what a joy his
braves died for his honor, and to save his country from the
Spaniards. Verily, it is too much to tell; for they alone who
saw could truly report what glorious deaths were that day given
and received, and how the blood gushed from the big heart, and
the brains of brave warriors were beaten out, and how the
bowels of the mighty beasts fell down at the sharp passage of the
lance and knife; for the cunning warriors of Mauvila, while they
lay wounded beneath the horses, smote them suddenly under their
great bellies. And then the beasts grew maddened, and they
fled swiftly as the arrow flies, with a horrid scream, and grievous
groans, the bowels trailing as they sped, until they could fly no
more, and rolled over their riders, the chiefs in armor, whom
they crushed beneath their own weight. And at every horse
thus slain the women and the maidens upon the walls of Mauvila
made a new song of rejoicing. And they sang-
"'Great is the Brave of the Mauvilian who hath slain the
mighty beast of the pale faces.
"'He shall be named the Slayer of the Beast forever, and there
shall be a totem for his bosom, with the picture of the beast.
"'And his name shall be sung forever by the maidens of Mai~-

upon his name.
"'Verily, he shall pass the blue mountains upon the spirit of
the beast that he hath slain. He shall hunt in the Happy Val~

to take them captive; for wherefore should the warriors c

many great warriors of Mauvila fallen on that day. But it was
in the wildness of their valor, which suffered them to fear no
danger, that so many of them yielded their naked life to the ~1eath
shaft of the Spaniard.
"Now, it was even in the moment when the Spanish warriors
who rode were trampling down the braves of Mauvila, striving
to keep them back from the conflict which had begun between
the troops of Istalana and Moscoso, that the chief Istalana ap-
peared in front, mounted on one of the great beasts of the Span-
iards. Verily, the beast was of a beautiful strength and majesty,
and he had a name with his master, and he was called Bajardo.
And when the Spaniards beheld the beast-thouo'h they, knew
nothing of the great chief Istalana, (for he was no longer of the
pale sickly color of the white men~ but had been made comely
by the war paint of the Mauvilians, and he wore feathers of the
birds of Mauvila and Apalachia, and a robe off saffron-cotton of
our people, and upon his shoulders a rich robe of fur which the
Great King had given hiir~ whcn he made him a chief; )-when, J
say, the Spaniards beheld the beast, they said one to another,
'Is not that Bajardo, the horse which was ridden of old by the
Blackamoor Juan, the Page of the knight of Portugal P And
they answered, 'Verily, it doth seem so. Yet bath he long been
missing.'
"But they saw nothing of the Blackamoor, and they knew not
the knight of Portugal, in the costume and the war paint of the
Mauvilian. And the knight of Portugal, now the chief Istalana,
rode forth towards the warriors of Spain, even to where was
seen, making great show above the rest, the chief, Soto, of gas-
tile, their general and great warrior. And Soto and his v~rar~
riors marvelled much when they saw a red warrior of MauVila
so gallantly riding towards them; and they wondered more
when they saw him shake out his lance in defiance, waving it
towards Soto himself, and, in the manner of the pale warriors,
thus~seeming to bid him come to the conflict. And the captains
and chiefs around Soto were angry,, and they said, 'Let us go
and punish this insolent savage ;' but Soto said-
"'Nay! It is for me to punish his insolence!' And he rode
forth alone, a little ahead~ of tfle rest; and, seeing this, Istalana
said to the Mauvilians-
"'Get ye back all, and leave Soto, of castle, to me. Only see
that others come not between us. If I slay him, or ye see me
overthrown, then fall fiercely upon the chiefs that follow' him;
and heed ever the things that 1 have told ye.'
"And the warriors of Mauvila fell back. And Istalana pre..

p ared himself for Soto, though he carried no weapon b~it the
heavy lance, and the great axe of metal, such as the Spa~iar~~
bore. And he had no armor upon his limbs, and he wo~re no
buckler upon his arm. And he went unafraid to the enequnter
with Soto, of Castile. And Soto came on briskly, with his lance
couched for the encounter, and he little wist of the enemy who
stood before him; and knew not bitt that ~it was a brave flative
warrior of Mauvila; for he saw thafithey were a people the most
daring of all the world, who were willing to fight with any foe, auci
with any weapons, or according to any fashion. And knowing
this, Soto said within himself-
"'Now2 verily, these warriors of Mauvila have a world of
impudence. Here is a savage that hath gotten him a beast
which he knows not how to manage, yet would he undertake
the warfare with me after my own fashion. Yet, in sooth, he
keeps his seat with a tolerable grace and steadiness, and with
proper teaching might be rendered a right comely and formida-
ble cavalier. Yet shall I have to punish him with a death thrust,
that I may rebuke the overweening presumption of his people.'
"And so thin king and speaking to himself; Soto, the Castil-
ian, spurred his beast forward to the meeting with Istalana, who,
nothing loth, or slow, made his beast go to meet him, with a
great rushing. And the two leveled their long lances, and
there was a great cloud that wrapt them; and lo, when the cloud
lifted, there could be seen Soto, the cavalier, falling upon the
ground, and Istalana wheeling his great beast backward, and
making towards Soto, with his lance ready to do him to death
with a thrust."

WE have given a sufficient specimen of our Choctaw chronicle
for a while. Relying on his authority as heretofore, we shall y
forego the stately simplicity, and the quaint solemnity of his styl
as far as possible in the future, and trust to that which is mm
natural to ourselves and readers. We need repeat, after th
sample of our authority, that his account is the most trustwort
of all the parties; and our materials will show that he supplies
thousand deficiencies, in the details, which the vexed vanity of t
Spanish invaders would never allow them to put on recor
We proceed now to our history.
The fall of De Soto occasioned naturally a tremendous sens
tion. The wild exultation of the red men rang throughout t
field as for a victory already gained, and a most unexpected t
uruph rendered certain. The A delantado of the Spaniards xv
considered by the simple native~ in the light somewhat of a go
man-a demi-god, who was in some degree invincible, or 11
Achilles, only vulnerable in some small region not easily reached
by dart or tomahawk. They~were now disabused, of this supe
station, and their spirits rose in consequence to the highest pitc
of hope and enthusiasm. They knew not but that he was a
ready slain; at least, he was in the power of their champion; tin
seemed certain, and a single stroke of the terrible lance whk
Vasconselos carried was alone needed for the coup de grac
Istalana, now doubly glorious, and a favorite in their eyes, seeme
prepared to satisfy their expectations. Wheeling about to r
turn to the charge, his lance was couched, and the vulture, con
missioned by the fates for his destruction, already threatened L
Soto with the consummation of his doom.
But the Spanish chivalry were not prepared to suffer the co
queror to complete his work of vengeance. They had seen ti
fall of their governor; and, with a mixed howl and shout, the g~
lant cavaliers who had attended him, and who had only remain
a short distance from the scene of the passage between hinise
and Istalana, now dashed forward to his rescue. They were ju
in season. Our Portuguese Mauvilian was already upon 1

enemy. De Soto who had succeedQd in recovering his feet, had
drawn his sword, and was ~ready to defend himself.
"Hernan de Soto," cried Vasconselos, to the complete aston..
ishment of his opponent, "thy hour is come!* The doom for thee
is written! Thou shalt die beneath the hand and curse of the
man thou hast basely dishonored !"
He knew the voice. He could no longer doubt the person.
"Philip de Vasconselos !"
"Ay! and thy fate! Prepare thee !"
"I fear thee not, renegade and traitor !"
"Ha! thou shalt feel me !"
And the lance was couched at his breast. De Soto raised his
sword in defence. Philip would have sprung from his steed and
encountered him on more equal footing with the battle-axe, but
ju t then the rush behind him required him to guard himself.
Th Spanish knights were upon him. There were Nuno de To-
ba and Balthazar de Gallegos, and many others. Philip gave
the rowels to Bajardo. He dashed through the thick array.
Go zalo de Sylvestre was rolled over upon the earth; Alonzo de
Pi os was reached by ~e lance which failed to slay him, but
kno ked out several of hi front teeth, and greatly disfiguring his
moi~th, spoiled the prettiest face in the army. Others were
handled only less roughly, and thundering through them as the
great buffalo thunders through a forest of prairie dogs, the won-
derful cavalier of the red men broke away from the network of
foes which for a moment seemed to threaten him with captivity
or death.' His forest followers were not idle. The warriors of
Mauvila launched themselves, with desperate valor, into the
thickest of the wild array, and the battle, with all its terrors, was
resumed on every side.
It raged with no abatement for more than an hour, and with
no seeming change of fortune. Many of the Spaniards perished;
many of their horses. Hardly one escaped without ~Mounds;
but the naked red men suffered death, and not wounds, with every
hurt. More than a thousand had perished in the strife, when
Istalana, whose plans had been wholly baffled by the impatient
pride and haughty valor of Tuscaluza and his general, succeeded
in drawing off a portion of his forces to the shelter of the forest,
into recesses where the horses could not pursue, and whence the
arrow could be shot with unerring and unexpected aim. The
red men disappeared almost in the twinkling of eye, leaving the
field strewn with their bodies.
Co9alla was the first to receive Vasconselos. But where was

"AhI boy; and I bade thee not'?" said Vasconselos reproa
fully.
"I saw them as they surrounded thee, Sefior, and I could

Philip smiled sadly on the Moor. But when he looked
second time on Co~alla, he beheld that she toQ had had shared t
dangers of the fray. She had been more fortunate than Ju
and had been wounded in the arm. Oh! what were the pa
of that~ young attendant when he beheld Vasconselos take t

bind up the still bleeding limb., The hurt was fortunately slig

the nature of the wound. Little did he dream what hand h

page and princess had both gone forth to his rescue the mom
that they beheld his peril, the heart of the melancholy kni
was very full. No tears gathered in his eyesb He had forg
ten how to weep; but never did eyes declare such tender e
tions; and he looked from Juan to Co~alla, and he took
hand of the princess and kissed it, while he drew the trembli
Moor to his bosom, and said to him fondly-
"Boy, thou shalt evermore be brother to me. I have
other brother now but thee."
Andres de Vasconselos had been one of the cavaliers wh
ranks that day he had so fiercely broken through. Bt~t he h
raised no lance against that young kinsman's bosom.
Juan trembled with terrible emotions as, for the first tin:

"Oh! Senior, thou art wounded."
The red stain was apparent through the white cotton of his
vest. The garments were sticking to the wound upon his
bosom.
"Let it remain," said Philip, as page and princess, now both
excited with fear, proposed to attend the hurt.
"Let it remain. It is nothing, and now bleeds no longer."
It was but a flesh-wound made by the partly spent shaft from
a cross-bow. He had pulled out the arrow during the fight, and,
pressing the garments upon the wound, had succeeded in stop-
ping the flow of blood. There was no time noW for surgery.
The Spaniards had renewed the action, and Istalana was required
~to go forth again.
Furious with the sanguinary courage of the Mauvilians, con-
scious of the peril which awaited his own and the fortunes of his
army, and mortified deeply with the disgrace of his overthrow in
the sight of foes and followers, Hernan de Soto only de1~yed the
~action long enough to enable his followers to recover from ex-
haustion. It was necessary to obtain possession of the town.
There his people would find shelter and provisions, both of which
they began to need. There had the red men stored their supplies
for the winter. Several of the houses were great granaries of
maize, beans, and potatoes. There, too, were their great armo)
ries-arrows, arrow-bolts, and macanas, darts, and stone hatchets.
To possess himself of these, was to supply his own soldiers, and
greatly to impoverish and enfeeble the red men. There, too, ex-
ulting in his savage pride and power, was the hateful and insolent
Tuscaluza, the only cassique among the native princes who had
ever shown himself really formidable to the Spaniards in Apa-
lachia, up to the present moment. All his passions and all his
reflections conspired to goad him to the most desperate efforts to
make his way into the fortress of Mauvila. To remain without,
exposed to the perpetual assaults of thousands of enemies, spring-
ing up in the twinkling of an eye, and melting away as suddenly
into their great forest shelters, was a prospect that threatened
nothing short of ruin.
But it was necessary to plan the attack upon the fortress with.
a due regard to the thousands who guarded it, and of the other
thousands who swarmed throughout the forests in his rear. The
latter, too, were led by one who knew equally well what was pro-
per to the warfare of the red men and the Spaniards. Bitter and
savage were the moods which possessed De Soto as lie thought
of Philip de Yasconselos.

"ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH."              497
"And I have fallen beneath his lance this day; and, but for
my foil wers, I had been slain by the very man whom I had
doomed o dishonor and left to death !"
His g oomy musings were interrupted by the entrance of
several f his cavaliers, Nuno de Tobar and Andres de Vascon-
selos a ong them. He was about to declare the secret which
he alone possessed, that of the identity of the red warrior Istala-
na with he outlawed knight of Portugal. But the sight of An-
dres, an the recollections of the old affectionate intimacy be-
tween T~bar* and Philip, led him to a prudent secrecy.
"No!' said he to himself. "Not yet! Let them once know
that Phi~ip lives, and that this is he-remembering too that he
bath bee wrongly doomed-and will they strive so bravely
against h m? will they not, rather this brother of his, strive in
his behal ? May he not go over to him? May he not carry
others? In the moment of disaster, who clings to an old leader'?
What n mbers will gladly seize the moment to pass into the
embraces of the successful party? And know we not that many
have sou ht occasion to drop away upon the march, and giving
with the e savage women to grow to power among' the tribes?
No! no! I mt'st hush and hide this damnable discovery close
in the he rt, where it only works to torture."
Such w re the brieg hurried, and natural, but unspokeri~ thoughts
which oc urred to the Adelantado, when he beheld his knights
enter to r ceive their orders. De Soto could not throw off the
savage gi om that possessed his soul and filled his countenance,
but he ga e it an expression of swift ferocity.
"Well, seniors, you are ready. It is time. Let us now to
work, wit all our soul and strength, to scourge these savages to
the utter ost. Before the sun shall set this day, we must be in
in possess on of yonder fortress. If we fall, our day has ended!
Do you h ed me, all? While this sun lasts we must conquer
yon town, and hold it in possession. Yonder forests,"-~and he
shuddered as he pointed to them-" harbor ten thousand ene-
mies, hate ul and hating us, without pity or affection; with num-
bers dest~ ed to hourly increase, pouring in ever as the vultures
throng ab ut the carcass. Let us go forth."
They w re soon in full array, and in the field. De Soto had
already m tured his plans. He had detailed the greater and bet-
ter portion of his cavaliers for the defence of his rear, while a
chosen bo y assailed the for1~ress. The horsemen were particu-

plain in which the, steed can exercise the chief faculty, that of
fleetness, 'which confers upon him his peculiar uses in war.
The battle was resumed. Tuscaluza and his warriors prepared
for the Spaniards along the walls. Istalana led forth his troops
from the forest, and against their rear. He was encountered by
the picked chivalry of De Soto which, in separate bodies of teu
men each, occupied the plain in their front, and, cased in armor-.
all the vital parts protected except the eyes-offered but 'small
marks for the archery of the red men, while in their successive
charges they swept down hundreds. The horse was more vul-
nerable, however, though some pains had been taken to protect
him in the more exposed and sensitive regions of his body. Ista-
lana, or, as we shall henceforth prefer to call him, Vasconselos,
aimed at two objects-to bring his troops, only as archers, into
full play, and at the same time to cover them as much as possi-
ble with the trees of the forest froni the sweeping charges of the
horsemen. But, if he kept the cover of the forest wholly, he
failed to reach the cavalry with his arrows, the plain being of
*      such extent; and not to drive them from it, was to leave the
garrison without succor, or diversion, to endure the whole weight
of De Soto's assault. He accordingly prepared to throw a body
of five hundred active warriors, good with spear and 'battle axe,
between the detachment of cavalry in front of him and the forces
with which De Soto assailed the walls, while the rest of his troops,
covered as much as possible by the forest, kept the horse in full
employment with their arrows. He, himself, on foot, prepared
to lead his~spear-men into the thickest of the fight, and between
the two divisions of the Spanish army.
"And now," saith our 'old Choctaw chronicler, "the glorious
fight began once more, with a shock as of many thunderbolts.
And Soto, of Castile, led his great men close up against the
walls of Mauvila; and the great king confronted him there with
a terrible flight of arrows; and with heavy stones he drove him
back from the fortress. And when Soto, of Castile, was thus
driven back, he fell upon the warriors of the great chief Ista-
lana, and very terrible was the battle that ensued between these
mighty men of war. But, though many of the Spaniards were
slain and more hurt, yet, by reason of the armor of tough metal
which they wore, many escaped, who else had been done to
death, by the valiant strokes o~ Jst~dana and his spearmen. These,

people, e drew them cunningly away from between the ranks
of the S aniards, and gave them shelter for a season among the
great tre s of the forest. And De Soto, of Castile, again strove
with the great king against the walls of Mauvila, and his axe-men
toiled to cut though the walls, and to beat down the gates of the
fortress; and a second time were they driven back, sorely smitten,
because f the heavy stones delivered from the fortress. And
again d~d the brave Istalana 'give battle to the retreating
Spaniard , and to those who fought from the backs of the mighty
beasts. ud the battle went now one way, and now the other,
and, for season, neither party prevailed in the conflict. But
great wa the loss, and grievous the blows of blood which were
delivered on both sides among the champions. And, among the
people o Mauvila, there was great slaughter. Many cassiques
of fame erished in valiant agonies, crying to the gods to open
the blue ansions in the happy valley, and to send for them the
bright m idens, each bearing a cheering bowl to quench the thirst
of the w aried spirit. The mighty Oolenoe Ifisto was the first
to fall, h ing slain many foes. Then Chinabee Himantla gave
up the g ost, wearing more than thirty scalp locks upon arm
and thig ; and there were many more, brave like these, who
sang that day the song of the last fight. And many other great
chiefs we e stricken and hurt in the fighting of this day. -Istalana,
the great hief himself, was stricken twice, but he said nothing of
his hurts, while he gave death, to other men to drink, sorely
against th will of him who hath no thirst.
"But i was not only to the chiefs of Mauvila that the hurts and
the death were given. The Great Chief of the Spaniards, Soto of
Castle, fe t the sharp arrows in his thigh and side; but he was not
slain. T e lying prophet of the pale faces was scored with~a fly-
ing shaft, ike a coward, in the back. But he lived, that men
might say this is the mark of one who fled. And there was a
goodly yo th, a kinsman of Soto, of Castile, one whom they ball.
Carlos, w ose throat The arrow filled, so that he never called for
drink agan. And many were the warriors and chiefs besides,
for whom they made bitter moaning that night in the camp of
the Spani rds.
"But t e truth demands that I declare, that, on the third as-
sault upon the walls of Mauvila, the warriors of Soto, of Castile,
prevailed. And they prevailed by reason of the fact, that the
Great Kin was hurt with a lance that entered his bosom even
where he strove with a great warrior at the gate of the fortress.
And when the warriors of Mauvila beheld the Great King fall,
they sent ~ip a mighty cry. Anithe women, with foolish tongues,

spread it along the walls and through the town, that the Great
Eling was slain, even Tuscaluza; but, of a truth, it was not so.
Grievous was his hurt, and glorious, since it was made upon his'
open breast, in full front, and even in the moment when, with his
mighty stone-hatchet, he clove the brain of a great warrior of
the Spaniards. But, nevertheless, men thought him slain; and
when his people bore him away from the gate to a place of safety
without the walls, and into the forests on the other side-as was
counselled by the prophet-then the women lamented, and the
foolish warriors broke their weapons and lied from the walls
which they were bade to defend, and went hither and thither, not
knowing what to do; and, by reason of this folly, the followers
of Sot~, of Castile, broke their way through the walls,, and beat
down the gates, and their great captains, on their mighty beasts,
rode headlong through the streets of Mauvila, smiting as they
went. Then was it too late, when our warriors hastily caught up
their arms, and renewed the fight.
"And the women ~f Mauvila strove, too, in the ranks of battle, ~
and very great and glorious wa~ the slaughter. But the
Spaniards prevailed in battle against our people, and when this
was beheld by the ilKave women* of Mauvila, they seized bright
torches of the living flame. And they gave it wings; and they,
sent it from housetop to housetop; and they hid it away in the
hearts of the houses. And where they had their husbands slain,
they flung themselves into the burning houses, and they wel-
comed the coming of the Spaniards with arms of flame, waving
them on, as they passed 'over the walls and through the gates
with songs of triumph and defiance. It was a day of rich
blood. And the people of Mauvila left for the Spaniards only a
feast of famine, and music of agony and groans, with a raging
fire to quench the thirst which they knew, from eating at such a
banquet. The brave Tuscaluza, the son of the Great King, was
slain ; but the Great King himself was made safe in the big
forests lying toward Chickasah. Thither came also the mighty
chief Istalana, who had previous hurts upon his breast, upon his
face, upon his arms and side. Sorely was he stricken; and
they brought him upon the shoulders of the Tamenes toward
Chickasah, and the princess Co~alla, of Cofachiqui, tended him,
while he lay hurt, and the strange black page, Juan, watched be.
side him nightly when he slept."

PERICLS.

SUCH w s the terrible battle of Mauvila. The Spaniards had
obtained t ~e victory. They had won the chief fortified city of
the Mauvi ians. They had expelled the inhabitants or destroyed
them. Th sands of the redinen had perished-not so many,
by thousand s, as the conquerors claim to have destroyed, but still
the havoc had been terrible, and the victims were five times as
numerous s the whole army of ID~ Soto. The rash valor of the
Mauvilians their naked bosoms,, the superiority of the Spanish
arms and rmor, had naturally rendered the defeat a massacre!
But the triumph of the invaders was dashed by their own
terrible los es, and De Soto lamented his victory in the language of
Pyrrhus. Nay, it did not require such another victory to leave
the Cpstili n ~onqueror undone. He was already undone, and
he felt it. The gloom of despair was on his soul. His fac~e wore
a perpetual scowl. His language was harsh to all when he
spoke. H was no longer the confident, frank, impulsive cava-
lier, who c uld sweetly smile upon his friends, and who bore in'
his bosom n exulting hope and consciousness of desert, which
filled all w o beheld with unvarying auguries of success. He
was now st in, savage, suspicious; distrustful of friends and for-
tune; with the mortifying conviction that he had not only failed,
in the grea hopes which had inspired his enterprise, but doomed
to other fa ures, involving fame as well as fortune; perilous to
life as to s ccess. He thought of the noble woman, his wife, left
behind hi in the Government of Cuba, and bitterly remembered
that betwe n her and himself rolled the great sea, and between
that sea an his warriors, spread hundreds of miles of impene-
trable fore t, every thicket of ~which harbored its hosts of im-
placable a d sleepless enemies.
'And as t e details of his real condition met his ear, the gloom
grew deep r upon his visage and within his soul. Very wretched
was the co edition of the Spaniards after the battle of Mauvila.
Moire than two hundred of them had been slain or put hors de
corn~at. S arcely a man had escaped entirely unhurt. De Soto

himself was thrice wounded, and though not, in either instance,
severely, yet the hurts were of a sort to goad, to mortify his
passions, and to vex his pride. We have secrn, what were his
personal humiliations also. But he was not allowed to brood on
them. Th~ condition of his army demanded all his thoughts.
His soldiers, covered with wounds, were attended by a single
surgeon, and he was at once slow and unskilfui. There was
neither lint, nor linen, nor liniments; neither medicines w)r
bandages; neither ointments nor instruments; not even clothing
and shelter. The fires of the wild Mauvilians had consumed all
the stores of commissary and surgeon-all the food and physic-
all that was needful fbi' the healthy, no less than the suffering and
sick. The dwellings were all consumed, and but a poor shelter
was found in the miserable tents of boughs and branches, which
could be raised by the feeble efforts of the least wounded among
the Spaniards. For bandaging wounds, they tore the shirt~ from
their backs; to procure unguents for the hurt, the slain I~idians
were torn open, and the fat taken from their bodies; the slain
horses were cut up and their flesh preserved, for sustenance for
all. Even their devotions were interrupted, in the loss of the
wine and wheaten" flour which they had used in the performance
of the mass; and to the superstitious, the question became one of
serious importance, whether bread of Indian meal might be em-
ployed for the sacrament,-a question gravely discussed aihong
them, and terminating in the unfavorable resolve, that it was not
tolerated by thi~ canons of the church. When to the real physical
miseries of their situation,~we add those of their spiritual hunger,
we may conjecture the terrible gloom which overspread the en-
campment of the Spaniards.
This gloom of his followers was naturally of deeper and darker
complexion in the soul of De Soto, than it was among his people.
His had been the loftiest ambition, the most exulting hope. His
pride, and station, and responsibility, were greater than all the
rest. He was proportionately overwhelmed in the common catas-
trophe. He was utterly unmanned by his reverses. Not that
he was unwilling to fight and peril himself as before; but that he
was no longer able to control his passions, and hide his infirrni-
ties, and develop the strength and resources of his genius.
moody irritable and savage, he was now purposeless in his aim,
and utterly hopeless of favorable events in his future progress.
-He had no longer the heart for enterprise, or the spirit for ad-
venture; and, for eight days, he lay in his rude and inadequate
encampment, among the ruins of. Mauvila, like a wounded tiger,
licking his wounds in his jungle. Meanwhile, the wounded suf-

fered, or covered, died or lived; without seeming to arouse his
active se sibilitics. The army, under his gallant cavaliers, began
slowly to repair its hurts, and to recover, after a fashion, from its
maims an bruises. But it was the skeleton only of its former
strength, nd symmetry and beauty. The despondency of their
chief opp essed the spirits of all. Hope had deserted 1~hem, and
they now only sighed for the opportunity to return to those dis-
tant horn s which few. of them were ever destined to behold
again.
It was while they lay thus, and suffered, in the town of the
Mauvilian ,-groaning with their hurts, and dreading every
moment t ~t the red men would surround, and compel them to
resume t e struggle to which they felt themselves so unequal,
that they received intelligence which was calculated to cheer
them with the hope of escape from the perilous meshes in which
their ente prise had involved them. Tidings reached them, un-
expectedly, of the arrival, at Achuzi (now Pensacola) of certain
ships from Cuba, under the command of Gomez Arias and Diego
Maldonad . The moment this news was~received; both officers
and men began to calculate the distance between Mauvila and
Achuzi. t was-according to their eager estimate-but eight
days jour ey to the sea coast; and all hearts began to cheer
themselves with the hope of sooti reaching the ships, the succor
of their c mrades, and finally the pleasant country which all
now were prepared to regret that they had so idly left. No one
thought t remain in a region which yielded them no golden
cities, and he people of which betrayed such implacable hostility,
such indo table courage, and such sanguinary fierceness of
character. They discussed the matter among thena~elves. They
encourage each other with their new born hopes of escape from
a country, n which they beheld nothing but sleepless and bloody
enemies-i 1 which they could now anticipate nothing but disaster
and a gloo y fate for all. These resolVes and desires were freely
spoken. T ey were not confined to the common soldiers; and De
Soto7 by ac ident, overheard one of these discussions, in which the
same opini ns and wishes were expressed by his favorite cavaliers.
From th t moment, his resolve was taken. lie could not re-
turn a vag ond to Cuba. He who had gone forth in such state
and spend r, could not crawl back in the sight of his people, ~
maimed a stricken fugitive. He must first conquer. He
must win t e spoils he sought. He must carry back the, proofs
and the tr phies of the golden cities which he had promised.
He still ha faith in the hidden treasures of the Apalachian. He
still looked to the conquest of a semi-civilized people, such as

6

those of Mexico and Peru, the overthrow and dominion of whom
would crown the close of his life with glory, and redeem and re-
pair the hurts of character and credit which had confes~edly
accrued from his enterprise, up to the present moment. He
resolved to confound his cowardly followers, and to baffle all
their imbecile calculations. He determined that they should
share his fortunes, in spite of all their fears. He did not suffer
them to know that he was aware of their secret hopes. He
simply gave his orders-to turn their backs upon his shipping, and
go forward, deeper, deeper, into the wild abodes of the savage
Apalachian.
His cavaliers, as soon as they heard these orders, boldly nn-
dertook to expostulate with him upon* them. They spoke of
the sea, of the shipping at Achuzi, of their hopes and homes in
Cuba.
"Tell me not of sea, or ships, or Cuba !" was the angry reply
of the Adelantado. "I will see neither, until I have conquered
these savage Apalachians, and won possession of their great
cities."
They would still have expostulated. "There were no great
cities" was the answer. "These people are mere savages. Our
people despond. They have not the heart for further adventure.
Their hearts are set only on returning to the sea coast, and
availing themselves of the shipping, of once more reaching Cuba.
They are already discontent with the delay. They will
mutiny-."
"Ha! mutiny! Tell you this to me? Then get ye ready your
executioner, and prepare to do as I require, for by the Holy Cross,
so long as I breathe, the Yic&amp;Gerent here of our Royal Master,
I will put to sharp justice the soldier who shall only dare to
murmur. Away, Sir Knights, and let me hear no more of
this."'
"The habitual exercise of authority had imparted to De Soto
a power of command, which was admirably seconded by a sub-
mission as habitual, as well among his cavaliers, as common
soldiers. The obedience of the one, necessarily enforced that of
the other. The army was put under marching orders, and, with
weary footsteps and responding hearts, the remnant of the army
took its way into the great solitudes once more.
But the one purpose~ of progress, in Dc Soto's mind, was un-
directed by that aim and design which constitute the first true
essentials of successful adventure oti the part of the soldier.
Disappointed hitherto in the results which followed his several
enterprises, he knew not now whither to direct his footsteps.

WHAT OF ISTALANA.                  505
From th S moment, his only labor seemed to be to increase the dis-
tance bet veen his people and the sea. Haunted by the dread of their
desertion , he simply hurried forward, on a route that perpetually
changed ts direction, now east, now west, hither and thither, but
always t no purpose. He knew not, nor seemed to care to
know, w either he sped. Stern, silent, irritable, he scorned
counsel and forbade expostulation. He wandered thus, in
weary pi grimage, day by day, passing from forest to forest,
from vill ge to village, fighting wherever the red men crossed his
path-w ich they did perpetually-and fighting always without
an object One is forced to think, seeing how erratic was his
progress, ahd how recklessly he incurred all perils, that his real
purpose as to end a struggle which brought him vexation only,
and a life which, his pride taught him, was dishonored by the de-
feat of all his expectations.

what of t e people of the Great King, Tuscaluza? what of the
Portugue e Knight, whom we now know as Istalana, the im-
mediate confidant of the Mauvilian Cassique, sorely wounded
in the fina battle with the Spaniards. Both of these chiefs were
seasonabi borne away by their red followers to a place of
safety in t e contiguous forests. As these proceedings were all
transacted with the greatest secrecy, by a peGple practiced in the
utmost subtleties of savage warfare, as cunning as the serpent,
and as ste lthy as the cat, the Spaniards never dreamed of the
vast num ers, that, more or less hurt, were carried safely from
the meUc; and the still greater numbers, who escaped when the
conflict we t too decidedly against them. The Mauvilians had
lost proba ly three thousand warriors, and a few score of women
had perish d also fighting in their ranks; but a numerous army
still remain ed to the Great King, even of those engaged ~t Mau-
vila; while others daily poured into his assistance, led by the
Cassiques f tributary provinces. Had he or Istalana been able
to take th field, the spaniards had never been suffered to rest a
moment in Mauvila; had never been permitted time to repair
their disas ers and to recruit themselves fqr a fresh campaign~

But, in t e wounds and incapacity of their great leaders, the

red men did not dare to venture upon the enterprise for them
selves. They were content to gather and prepare themselves.
to provide a new armory; to lay in supplies of provisions; to
guard their wounded monarch; and watch closely all the move-
ments of the Spaniards. Tuscaluza had been severely hurt, but
the red men, rarely outraging nature with the too frequently im-
pertinent pretensions of art, were good nurses, and not bad sur-
geons, in that day, when they did not feel their own deficiencies
and had not learned to succumb to the genius of the white man.
They had considerable knowledge of pharmacy, and dealing with
green wounds, which were not necessarily mortal, they were
singularly successful. The conquering people have borrowed
many good lessons, and much knowledge, from their skill in
medicine.
Of course, Istalana shared with the Great King, in the best at-
tentions of his people. Nay, he had probably even better attend.
ance, for was not Co~alla his nurse, and was not Juan nigh,
jealous of her cares, and watchful of every opportunity to inter-
pose his own? Vasconselos had suffered from several wounds.
He had been brought from the field in a state of utter insen-
sibility. Borne on a litter through the forests to a place of
safety, remote from the scene of action, he had undergone a long
struggle with the mortal enemy of life. Youth, great vigor of
constitution, fond and sleepless cares, and a loving solicitude that
neglected nothing; to those he owed his recovery. During all
his sufferings, through a long insensibility, fever and delirium,
Co9alla never slept. Ah! the devotedness of the loving heart-
the loving woman! How it galled the soul of Juan to see her
officious tenderness, when he could not interpose-when he dared
not. How it angered him, when Co~alla bound the fever balm
to the fqreheacl of the unconscious Knight-when she bathed his
hands and arms in cooling waters; when she applied the bruised
herbs to his wounded side and bosom, when she poured the cool-
ing beverages into his burning lips, when she sate' by him, and
lifted his head upon her arms, and against her bosom, and mur-
mured softly in his ears, her fond, exulting consciousness-" oh!
Philip! my Philip."
Then would the page chafe with vexation. He betrayed his
anger. He was rude to Co~alla. He complained even of her
officious zeal, and sleepless attendance.
And Oo~alla pleaded with him as if she had been no princess.
She knew that the boy loved the cavalier, and for this she
forgave him all his offences. It was quite enough with her, that
the rude boy was devoted to his master. That, she saw. She

Never was a war did cease,

Cn1mEUNE.

THE warriors of the Apalachian had been set in motion, by the
impatient Tuscaluza, before Vasconselos ,~as able to take the
field. His pride made him impatient. Advised of every step
in the progress of' the Spaniards, he had commanded that their
steps should be followed; and, taking counsel, for awhile, from
Istalana, he had pursued a cautious policy, which studiously fore-
bore risking anything on a general battle. His present chief
warrior was Chiea~a, who controlled an immense district of'
country, and could bring at least five thousand warriors into the
field. The progress of De Soto had now brought him into the
territories of this Chief. To him, Tuscaluza-preparing himself'
to take the field-had sent instructions to harass the Spaniards,
cut off detachments and supplies, whenever occasion offered, but,
on no account, to engage in general action. It was the fortune of'
the Great King to Apalachia, to possess great Captains, who, like
the ambitious Chiefs am6ng more civilized nations, have too
much self-esteem to hearken to the words of counsel, or even to
obey the commands of' their superiors always. Chicaza ventured
battle with the enemy, and was defeated. But not till a dread-
ful massacre had taken place, as terribly murderous to the red
men as that of Mauvila, and quite as fatal to the Spaniards.
De Soto had possessed himself of' the village of Chicaza.
The first act of the fierce Cassique was the destruction of his own
town. He decreed it to the flames. It was a bitter cold night
in February, the north wind blowing wildly, and dark clouds
scudding across the sky, whei~ the Cassique led his forces, in
three separate bodies, to the attack. The Spaniards knew not o~
their danger, till the dwellings, in which they had sheltered them-
selves, were all in flames. Scouts and sentinels, officers and
men, had been alike neglectful df duty. The red men stole into
an unmatched camp. They gave no alarm, until they had laid
their inflammable torches beneath the cottages, and until their
shafts, tipped with lighted matches, had swept to the straw-roofed

Yet why do ye go with him in your hearts, that ye may the
better pluck down ruin on my head."
"What means his Excellency," demanded the confounded
Nuno de Tobar. The scowling eyes of IDe Soto were set upon
Andres de Vasconselos. The latter proudly answered, and with
a calm cold sterness of manner, which made the resemblance
between himself and brother much more evident than ever.
"I know not what your Excellency designs to say, for a truth
all that you have spoken sounds strange and unmeaning in mine
ears; but if their be any purpose to charge aught of our disasters
upon my neglect of duty or want of loyalty, then do I demand
that you name my accuser, and my sword shall answer to his false-
hood."
'~ Even thus he spoke! Thus he looked! Thus he defied me
ever 1" cried IDe Soto, his memory still retaining full recollection of
the reserve and self-esteem which in the case of Philip de Varco-
melos had always offended the amour propre of the Castilian.
"Of whom speaks the Adelantado?" demanded Tobar.
"Of whom! Jesu! one would think you bad slept, without
hearing the cries of war, without feeling the shock of battle,
without scathing in the scorching flames that swept over us by
nightduring the last thirty days of strife and honor."
Such was the sudden burst of seeming astonishment, with which
the adelantado replied to his lieutenant. He continued, ardently
and wildly-
"Of whom should I speak, but of that insolent Jate which has
dogged our steps from Ghiala, and which hangs over us with ruin.
Oh! ye know not. Ye are blind. Ye will remain blind until the
knife is at your throats, and there is. no means left ye for escape.
Hark ye! Ye have seen De Soto overthrown, for the first time
overthrown, in single combat; man opposed to macn, lance to lance
steed to steed. And ye have seen all this achieved by ~ naked
savage of the Apalachian! No mail upon his breast, no helmet
upon his brow, no crest upon gleaming shield, declaring his deeds
in war. Yet he had a name. Once he had crest and shield, and
cuirass. Ha! Ha! A red savage! and ye thought it was a mere
savage, a naked Apalachian of the hills, whose lance could foil that
of Hernan De Soto, whose charge and thrust could roll the Gas-
tilian warrior into the dust. Oh! blind! Hark ye! It was no
red man no Apalachian, though wearing his semblance. It was
this accursed Fate, I tell you, that pursues us now, that will still
pursue us, that will fee~d upon us all, even as the vulture and the
wolf glean among our bones bleaching in the wilderness. But I
will not fall in vain! There will be a bloody issue yet. His crest

And with the famous slo an of Spanish* battle, the maddened
cavalier dashed forward to ie assault.
Meanwhile, as the Spania ds clearly saw, the red warrior web
comeci the encounter; for e waved his long lance aloft in the
sunlight, and he, too, advance d as if glad to engage in the mortal
struggle with the noble Ca tilian. But it was no part of the
policy of the Spanish knight or soldiers to suffer the Adelantado
to peril himself in single combat, in his present diseased and
feeble state. Besides, they had seen the wonderful and unac-
countable prowess which the red warrior had shown on horseback.
They naturally concln~1ed the one before them to be the same
who had already overthrown their leader, and they began to share
in the superstitions w ich he had taught them to respect. They
dashed forward in a ody to the support of Dc Soto, and, with
their approach, the s range warrior of Apalachia melted fr~rn
sight, man and horse, uto the dim shadows of the impenetrable
forest.
"Whither went he?" demanded the Adelantado. "Did the
earth swallow him? id ye see him ride away ?"
"Verily," said one, 'he disappeared as suddenly as he came!
We saw nQt how! Perhaps into the forest."
"But had he not be~n a fiend from hell, could he have sped
from sight unseen-unheard?"
The knights crossed themselves solemnly, and each muttered
to himself a prayer.
"It is the Fate-my Fate!" exclaimed Dc Soto as they led
him back; "but I shall cross weapon with him yet! Sant Lago
against the Fiend, myrrien ds! I will conquer mine enemy ~"
Days passed; the ~paniards still pressed forward; still har-
assed by their sleepless enemies, and unable, with all their ai~ts,
to bring the wily red n~en to a general action. But Dc Soto was
told of a fortress into which Chicaza, the Cassique, had thrown
himself; upon the very borders of his province, and where he
appeared preparing to defend himself. The news seemed to con-
centrate all the energies and purposes of De Soto. It gave him
a definite purpose. Them fortress was called Alabama, and stood
upon the banks of the Yazoo river. The garrison was large.
The fortress was strong and built like that of Mauvila. The
Adelantado at once led his army against it; clouds of the red men,
under Tuscaluza and Istalana, hanging upon his wings and rear.

shame together in t~ie depths of the wilderne s. He was a fine
example of the terrible selfishness of ambition.
The erratic progress of De Soto at length brought him to the
banks of the Mississippi. His was the first European eye, ac-
cording to the authentic history in our possession, which ever be-
held the , turbi~1 and wondrous streams of the "Father of
Waters." De Soto gazed upon them with but little interest.
He dreamed not of the glorious territories which they watered.
He saw not, through the boundless vistas of the future, the nu.
merous tribes who should dwell upon their prolific borders,
crowning them with the noblest evidences of life, and with the
loveliest arts of civilization. The spirit of the Adelantado was
crushed. The fires of ambition were quenched in his bosom.
His heart was withe ed: his hope was blasted forever. He was
now a dying man; not exactly a maniac, but with a mind ill at
ease, disordered, vacant, capt'icious; striving with itself: weary,
and longing only for the one blessing, which he had never suffered
himself to enjoy ;-Peace! His heart did not exactly crave a res-
toration to his home in Cuba, but the image of the noble wom-
an, his wife, rose frequently, reproachful in his sight. He had
loved her, as fervently as he could have loved any woman; but,
in the ambitious soul love i
love, but accords in s a very tributary passion. It craves
little return. Its true passion is glory!
We have foreborne a thousand details of strife, anxiety, dread and
suffering, which the Spaniards were doomed to experience before
they reached the Mississippi. They were haunted by the perpetual
terrors of th~ Apalachians. Tuscaluza and his Portuguese Lieu-
tenant Istalana gave them no respite. They crossed the Mississip-
pi. They penetrated the country of the Kask5kias, and still they
were under the eye ~mnd the influence of the Great King of the
Apalachians. The terrors of his name met them on every side.
The powers of his arm smote them in all their progresses. "The
Fate! The haunting and pursuing Fate! Oh! Philip de Vascou-

CHAPTER L.

"Last scene of all
That ends this strange eventful history."

sHaKSmEAR.

OUR previous narrative of events has brought us to the open-
ing of the summer of the year 1542. We have reached the
melancholy close of all those glorious prospects, and triumphant
hopes, with which Hernando de Soto left the shores of Cuba, for
the country of the savage Apalachian. He was a subdued and
broken-hearted man; humbled in spirit, mortified in pride,
ruined in fortune. He hadtsurvived all his hopes. Despair had
taken possession of hi~ soul. To crown his misery, physical
suffering was superadded to his griefs of mind, and wounds, and
travail, fatigue and fever, had combined to prostrate the iron
frame of him, who, in the pride of muscular vigor, had never
dreamed that any toil or trial should have forced him to succumb.
Nothing short of this utter prostration of his physical strength
and energies, would ever have compelled him to yield the point
to Fate-.would ever have moved him to listen to the entreaties ~of
his followers~now urged with a stern resolution that would no
longer brook denial, to turn back from the forests to the sea,~
and endeavor once more, to regain the shores of that beautiful
island, which, even the proud spirit of De Soto himself, be-
moaned in secret, with a fond and fearful anxiety. On the banks
of the vast and lonely Mississippi, occupying the Indian village
of Guachoy-a, the Adelantado gave his orders for the construction
of a couple of brigantines, such as would enable him to seek the
sea.
His people set themselves to this work, with the eagerness of
rn6n, to whom the fruition of all their hopes is promised. While
bodies of 'them were engaged felling and seasoning timber, others
scoured the country, seeking adventures and provisions; and
above all, to prevent the too near approach of the swarming
hordes of red men, by whom, ever since their approach to the
~territories of Tuscaluza, their fortunes had been followed. That
Fate, as De Soto himself esteemed it-which had hung upon
their steps and striven against them, with a bitter hostility from
~the moment when Vasconselos was lost to the Castilian columns,

town, and the scattered dwellings of th~ place, required to be well
watched. De Soto, to his usual habits of precaution, had, of late,
adopted others of an extreme sort, betraying a morbid appre-
hension of' danger. His sentinels were doubled; each night his
cavalry mounted guard in the suburbs of the village, bridle in
hand, and ready for the sally or defence. A patrol of troops
alternated, during the night, between the. several stations;
while, along the river, cross..bowmen in canoes kept vigilant
watch upon all approaches from the opposite shores.
But this vigilance was observed only while De Soto was him-
self able to assert his authority. With his increasing illness, all
this organization fell to pieces." The extra sentinels were dis-
pensed with; the cavalry found it hard to mount guard during the
night, when they had probably been on a foray all day; the troopers
findingthere were no alarms, gave up patrolling; the cross-bow.
men fell asleep in the canoes. The Spaniards were now stead-
fast only in the labor of building their brigantines; and all duties
that seemed to interfere with the prosecution of this work, were,
either in part, or entirely foregone. Gradually, as the heats of
summer began to prevail, all toils in the sun were relaxed. The
forbearance of' the red men, for several weeks, had persuaded the
Spaniards that they had endured the worst of their dangers from
this source. They little knew how much of this forbearance they
owed to that person, who had grown into the embodied Fate
of their great leader; and to whose agency, in especial, he as-
cribed the defeat of his enterprise and the destruction of his for-
tunes.
Philip de Vasconselos-the Cassique Istalana,-who had now
the entire charge of the forces of Tuscaluza on the Mississippi -
seeing how the Spaniards were engaged in the construction of
their brigantines, readily divined their object. He had no motive
to prevent their departure, and, consequently no desire to em-
barrass them in their progress. Still, there was one hostile feel-
ing, the gratification of which he had not enjoyed. His revenge
was incomplete. Could he have separated the Spaniards from
their Oaptain-could he have struck at kim-Aim and another-
there had been nothing left him to desire! He well knew that
through him De Soto had been baffled-that he was a subdued
and broken-hearted man; but it must be confessed that he still
yearned for the opportunity to bring the long issue between
them, to the final settlement of blood! This was the black s ot
in the soul of the Portuguese Cavalier.

"Ha! slain! slain !-and why did'st. thou tell me nothing of

"The Seiior will remember how little hath been said between

And the page looked gloomily in the direction of Co~alla.
Verily, the page had heen suffered but few opportunities to com-
mune with his master.
"And wherefore thy reserve of speech in the hearing of the

"Ha! dagger stroke, and from unknown hand! Speak, boy,

The lips of the page quivered. He cast his eyes upon the
ground. He was silent. Thronging memories and violent
emotions seem to confound his speech, and to shake his frame.
Philip beheld his emotion, and a new light seemed to gather
before his senses.

* as he went; Juan also saw and followed him. He rowed him~
self rapidly across the creek, and stood upon the Opposite bank,
at no great distance from the line of lodges which the Spaniards
occupied.
All w~ quiet in the encanipinent. Groups of the soldiers and
workmen could be seen in the distance, along the banks of the
river. An occasional figure wound his way along the public
thoroughfares. The approach to the cabins was Partly covered
by trees: but beneath them not a single sentinel could be seen.
Philip eagerly pushed forward, but with the subtle stealthiness of
the red man, and taking care always to cover his person from
sight. Flow was the page, Juan, astonished; when, crossing the
creek as rapidly as he could after his lord, and ascending also to
the level of the high ground leading to the Spanish camp, he
beheld the Knight entering one of the lodges of the enemy!
At that moment, he was called to by name from some one in
the rear. He looked back. Co~alla had crossed also; bow and
arrow in hand, and her face and voice equally declaring her
alarm. She was followed by several well manned canoes. Very
hateful was the beautiful and loving Co~alla in the eyes of the
page. He never answered her call, but, as if vexed by her pres-
ence and pursuit, he too pushed forward, in the direction which
his lord h~d taken, seeming quite reckless of the peril which he
ran.
Hernan De Soto, a mere skeleton of himself lay weak, ema-
ciated, weary of life, upon his bed of death! He was alone-he
had been left to sleep by his attendants who had withdrawn
to an outer apartment. The building was one of those great
lodges of the red men, which were capable upon occasion of
holding a thousand men. It had been divided by the Spaniards
into several compartments by the employment of quilted stuffs,
hides of wild beasts, and of their own horses, and matting
wrought by Indian art from native grasses and the bright yellow
reeds which grew along the banks, woven together with wild
oziers which were every where found in great abundance. The
couch of De Soto was prepared of like materials, over which
~ soft dry rushes were strewn in sufficient quantity. The lodges,
thus divided, as we have described, afforded several capacious
chambers; the best of which, fronting the south west, was occu-
pied by De Soto, but having in front ~f it a verandah which had
been carefully enclosed with vines and mats, in order to the ex-
clusion of the fierce glare of the sunshine. In this verandah, lay

gamed, or wandered in the shady thickets.-they did anything
but watch. They left this duty to the foragers, who, under
several of the most active knights, usually made a daily progress~
over a circuit of ten or fifteen miles along, the higher country, and~
thus scouring it daily, persuaded themselves that they kept th~
danger at a distance. It would have been easy to have darted ~d
upon the camp, thus loosely guarded, destroyed the growth otj
the brigantines, and cut oW at one fell swoop, the entire garrison,
with its once brilliant captain. But the soul of Philip de Vascon~
selos, even while it nursed fondly the passion for a great revenge,
was not prepared to fall upon the people with whom he had so
long marched as a companion. He found it easy to persuade the
Great King to consent to the wiser policy of suffering the Spaniards
to depart, rather than to risk the lives of thousands more of the
red men, in the effort at their violent extermination by battle.
Tuscaluza had lost so many of his bravest warriors already, that
he listened to the counsel thus given him, and the war, thence.
forth, was conducted a~ the discretion of Istalana.
But Philip de Vasconselos demanded his one victim. Had he
been able to see liernan de Soto, in field or camp, he might have
curbed his passion until the opportunity should offer of cutting
him off when but few troops should be engaged on. either side.
Not seeing him for so long a space, he began to apprehend that
he, too, might have fallen in battle, or by disease, and had been
buried secretly by his followers, who naturally dreaded lest the
red men should wreak their savage fury on his remains, should
they be discovered. Curious to ascertain the truth, eager to
pacify his great revenge, Vasconselos could no longer forbear the
inquiry, though urged at the peril of his own life and liberty.
Circumstances, as we have shown, favored his adventure.
There were no guards in attendance; there was no watch about
the lodge of De Soto, and though certain esquires occupied the
closed verandah upon the south-west, whom Philip could not see,
and whose presence he did not suspect, yet were these as little
prepared for danger, or assault, as were the several groups that
lay in the shadows of' the trees, and brigantines, or who loitered
among the broad avenues of the woods. The greater body of
the Spaniards in camp, were distributed among the several
lodges, either gaming, or enjoying that repose which the heats of
the season began to render exceedingly grateful, after several
hours of labor in the sun. A deep silence overspread the dwell-
ing in which De Soto was sighing away his life, when Vasconselos
passed between its portals. He had been utterly unseen. He
paused in the ante..chamber, on the northern side of the building,

"Thou dost see, Hernan de Soto! thou dost not dream. The

"Ha! then! It is true. Thou art here. \Ah! wilt thou strike

de Vasconselos, by the Holy Virgin, thou shalt see what is the
prowess of a true man, against the bosom of the renegade and
traitor !"
And the feeble chieftain lifted his hand and pointed to his
armor hanging against the wall, and motioned as if he would
have risen; but he sank back feebly and shut his eyes, mur-
muring-
"Be it as thou wilt! strike, if thou hast the heart for it! I

"but I will not strike thee. I will lay no hand upon thee noW

crossed weapon with his own; arid the river swamp was nigh, on
the edge of which lay his canoe. -
4t that, moment, the voice, of Juan was heard behind him, cryL
ing aloud,
Hasten, Senior Philip-hasten my lord, they prepare tc
He turned with surprise, in the direction whence the sound .
arose, much wondering to perceive the boy behind him; when,
even at that instant, the bolt was delivered from the cross-bow of'
one of the Spaniards, and he beheld the boy, as he threw himselfP
directly upon his path. .The next instant he saw Juan roll over
upon the sward, with the arrow quivering in his bosoni. The
boy had thrown off his armour of eseaupil, as most of thie red
men had done in that warm season, and not expecting strife; and
in his jacket of thin, unquilted cotton, the deadly shaft had met
with no resistance.
-With a deep cry of sincere sorrow, Yasconselos darted back-
ward tjo where the lzgy lay upon the strand. To gather him up in
*his powerful arms, and hurry with him down the slope, to the
canoe, was the work of a few moments only. As he. reached the
shore, he heard the voice of Cogalla, crying--
" Hither, Philip, hither ! Here is a great canoe."
He followed the sounds, and safely entered the canoe with his'
speechless burden. The rowers bent to their task, the boat shot
through the reedy thicket, and had nearly reached the opposite
shore, when a crowd of Spaniard , all armed with arquebuse and
cross-.bow, appeared along the n argin of the shore which they
had left. There were shots sent after the fugitives, bullet and
arrow, but with hurried aim-they were delivered fruitlessly.;
and while a thousand of the red men answered with their fearful
whoops, the shouts and threats of the Spaniards, the war canoe
of Coealla shot safely into cover, in a lagune hidden from all
sight by the dense thickets of its reedy shore.
In a green lodge 'by the river side, they laid the insensible form
of Juan, the page, upon a bank of rushes ; and Philip de Vascon-
selas, with a grievous sadnesss at his heart-.-for he saw that the
wound of the boy was mortal-proceeded tenderly to withdraw
the deadly shaft from his bosom, where it was deeply lodged.
But, at the very first effort, when it became -necessary to tea'r
open the vest of-the boy, his eyes opened, and he raised his hands,
and pressed down his garments, and murmured that they should
desist. -But in this effort he again fainted; and while he was
thus unconscious, Philip de Vasconselos cut the strings which
secured the jacket of the boy- in front, and ho, when he had open-

"Alas'!" he said, "my poor Olivia, it needs not. Know 1
not r~ow!"
And she answered-
"But thou knowest not that I am innocent of wrong doing,
Philip, and. this is what I would show thee."
She spoke but little more, but of this she was most eager to
speak. And she bade him look into her jacket of escaupil, where,
a packet had been sewn up, which should teach him all her cruel
history; how she had been wronged, but how she was inno-
cent; how she had been dishonored, but how she was an unwil-
ling and unconscious victim to the base and cruel arts of her
brutal kinsman. In this packet thus delivered, he read the tern-
ide history of her griefs, even as we have already delivered it.
But he did not read until she was no more.
She died in the arms of Philip; but she bade that Co~alla
should turn away her face, and leave the spot, e~e the parting
moment came. Then she bade that Philip shoul~l lift her from
the rushes, and when he did so, she threw her a~ms about his
neck, and laid her head upon his bosom, and so her pure and
suffering spirit went, with a sweet sigh, and a fond embrace, the
memory of which, in long years after, sweetened greatly the soli-
tude to the heart of the knight of Portugal. They buried her,
in the great solitudes of the Mississippi, under the shades of many
guardian trees, and the river rolls ever along with a deep mur'-
mur near the hallowed spot, as if it sang 'fond anthems for the
repose of a troubled soul.,
Midnight, and there was a solemn stir in the spanish encamp-
ment. There was a roll of martial music, and the wail of solemn
voices, as they'sang the awful dirge of death over the remains of
the once mighty Adelantado, ilernan de Soto. Then, in the
deepening darkness of the night, they placed the corse of the
Adelantado in the core of a green pine tree, which had been hol-
lowe~ out to receive it, and, nailing over this a cover of heavy
plans, they towed it from the shore, under an escort of an. hund-
red canoes, to the centre of the river, and there, with a solemn
service,:t~ey consigned it to a' bed beneath the great stream,
sinking it deeply, lest the avenging red men should possess
themselves of the corse of him who had wrought them so much
evil while he lived, and wreak upon his unconscious frame the
fury which possessed their' souls against him.
But Philip de Vasconselos, who beheld the scene,, and readily
divined the nature of the solemn service, would not suffer his
warriors to disturb its progress; and from the banks of theT rivers
