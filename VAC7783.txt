perchance tell tales to arouse the ire of this free coun~
try. Such tales have been told by some of the very
few captives who have regained their liberty; but they
have been drowned in the clamour of those who know
that no legal means exist for verifying them, and
whose i'eligion teaches that to lie for the honour of
the Church is meritorious.
But if the inmates of convents be happy, what
possible harm can ~c~crue from letting the world see
their happiness-from overwhelming with confusion
those who~assert the contrary? If nuns desire above
all things to remain in their paradises, why wall in and
ba; anabolt, and lock, and ~guard those paradises more
jealously ~than our gaols? If access be still denied,
we~c~1nuot believe th~t there is no crime to hide; and
we must persist in the attempt to have it ascertained,
l~y ]~,w, whether frightful rumours be not true; Let
~ix En~1ishman ~be. r~portedto have done, deeds of vio-
lence ir~ his own house, be it but to haye beaten a

mg~.rded only as ~a proof and aggravation of his crime;
anl so would ]~nglazid judge of conventual secrecy if

and sending out diamonds to stud the overhanging
foliage ; and now it has found a quiet, lowly channel,
where it ripples, clear as crystal, over white pebbles,
and green and olive moss ; and its little wavelets are
like .liquid gold when the sunbeam glances uponi
thdims
A child is standing with her eyes fixed upon the
stream; its beauty has entered into her very soul, and
s      forgotten that there is aught in the world be-
:very golden ripple, every changeful hue of
idpebble is painting itself upon her heart, and
apand passionate love of nature has taken pos-.
session of her young spirit. A sudden burst of music
from an overhanging bough has broken the spell of
the waters ; and lookingup to espy the. tiny chorister,
she sees him perched against the clear blue sky, with
the trellis-work beneath him. How beautiful ! Her
eye now wanders over the heavens, and they, in their
turn have woven their charm around her. Her foot
is upon a stone, her clasped hands are resting upon
her knee, and her head is thrown back while she gazes
reverently upon the sky. She is already an enthu-
A little lower down the glen, near the arch of an
old bridge, a lady is seated upon a grey stone, with a
small basket in her hand. She rises and approaches
the child, saying, ' Come, my love, we must gather our
primnroses and return home.'

' Mamm a, m amma! did you ever see the sky so
eautiful 4s it is to-day ' cried the little maiden. 'I
to love spring above all the other sea ons;' Well, the
rimroses ! ah ! there is a tuft slily peeping out from
he root of that old tree among the moss. I will ga-
her moss to dress them in, dear mamma, and then
hey will never know that they have left their own
eautiful bed.' And then she sung,
"Now on mossy banks so green,
"Starlike primroses are seen."
Is it not sweet to sing to the water ?~ Tinkle, tinkle,
inkle, theyr are singing too.'
' You ought to be a fairy, to live on he green sward
eside the waters,' said Mrs. Percy4 smiling, ' with a
rimrose cuip for your bower.'
'OCharm~2ing ! but the primrose would wither, and
hen I should have no house. I wishb those golden
tars woul: not wither ; that they would hide them-
elves here all the year round.'
' Prim oses will wither, and so will you, dear
hild,'
'But summer flowers will come, mamma, roseg
nd harebells ; and winter will bring bright icicles,
anging down from the fall; and green holly with red
erries.'
' God's world is beautiful always, my love ; and

'Are there flowers in Heaven? dearmamma.'
'Yes, flowers that never wither.'
'Delightful! And a blue sky and little streams?'
'A sky that is always bright, and a river of the
water of life.'
'Then I should like to go to heaven.'
Ah! poor child, she would go to Heaven for earth-
ly skies, and streams, and flowers! So would many
besides her.
~fhe primroses were gathered, and the wanderers
returned homeward; but the child's mind was filled
with heaven, such as she fancied it,-a paradise of
blue skies, and dancing streams and little birds. She
pictured too the form of a baby-brother there, with
bright eyes, and flaxen hair and wings. She had
been told that the child was now a cherub; and often
she had wondered that her mother who had wept over
his death, could not bear to hear her speak of his
beauty and happiness. AS'he would always have been
talking of him and of his fair home, feeling neither
sorrow nor separation; living in an ideal world where
he was present. She had sometimes dreamed of him,
ud sometimes fancied a rustling among the trees as
of viewless wings; and once she had awakened in the
morning with the song of an angel ringing in her ears.
Those wings and that song, she felt sure were her
baby-brother's.

INTRODUOTIOK.              13
It wa a splendid spring night; slight frost had
ade the stars sparkle like diamonds in the deep blue
ky; but he curtains were drawn, thE~ fire was stirred,
nd the h rp, on which Mrs. Percy h~d been playing,
as returned to its corner.
Mary coaxingly begged for a pro~nised less on on
he names of the stars. The window was thrown open;
hey ste4ed out upon the balcony, ~nd the wish of
he little ~irl was complied with.
'1st at Heaven up among the stars? I should
ike very, very much to go there,' cried she, clasping
er hand eagerly, while she seemed to see her little
brother I oking down upon her.
'Oh! Mary, Mary!' exclaimed l~{rs. Percy, with
an expre sion of pain.
K 'Ho! you star-gazers! do you can to cheat me
f my ga~e at blindman's buff, wit~our astrology ?
ou shall~ tell me my fortune by those stars,' cried Mr.
~ercy, darting out of the window, an4~I snatching up in
~is arms he youthful student, whom he bore laughing
and strug ling into the drawing-.roon~, 'What say the
planets? ou little gipsy.'
'The say that papa is a very ba~I man; and that
I will cat h him at blindman's buff,' tittered the child;*
all her co temptations put to flight l~y the sudden ir-
ruptiono fun. I
'And that the gipsy will catch 4old, and get no-
thing but water-gruel for a week. ]~idn't that come
next?'

'No! the big star said that papa should get wa-
ter-gruel, and I grapes and tamarinds.'
'Well, saucy one, look for the stars now,' said Mr.
P. tying a handkerchief over her eyes; 'That is the
way to the moon, and here is Orion's wand in your
hand. Come, you are walking into the sun, it will
burn you, young astraiaomer~.'
'I have caught you, sir papa, ha! ha I'
'No, you have caught the Great Bear, ready to
eat you; ho! ho!'
Worrying, laughing, struggling and screaming,
the game rose to a perfect uproar, till the appearance
of tea acted as a sedative; and when the child retired
for the night, stars and primroses were mingled in
her dreams. The gentle sleep of childhood fell upon
eyes that had looked only upon loveliness and mirth.

CHAPTER II.
FIRST SORROW.

"A mother's grave, amid the earth!
"Arrayed in flowers of summer dye;
"Is like the moon-cloud that comes f9rLh
"To darken all the radiant sky;
"For all the joys that life possest
"Our ilrooping hearts to soothe and save,
"Seem buried with the tender breast
"That moulders in a mother's grave"
Two yea s had passed away. Pri roses had come
a second ime, and violets and wood anemones were
also in t e glen; but they were ui~visited. There
was no so nd of mirth in Avon louse; but people
spoke low, and trod softly, as if fearf~il of awakening
a sleepin~ infant. In a half-darkene~ bed-room hung
with black, lay a lady very fair, stilt and silent, like
a finely-chiselled marble statue. IBeside the bed
kneeled l~er once happy husband, hi~ evening merrb
ment gone for ever; and the dark v~sta of a lonely,
desolate existence opened despairir~gly before him.
There wa~ no light in his soul; all ~v1as black as mid-
night; his eye was glassy, unmois4ned by a tear;

16             SISTER AGNES.                                                   FIRST SORROW.

and his fevered brow and clenched har~d told of the
utter departure of joy and hope. H~ presented a
strange contrast to the calm, passionless form upon
which he gazed. I -
Her harp was covered and put into its corner,
never more to be played upon; and all the little
articles of needle-work and drawing wJ~iich could re-
mind him painfully of her, were carefully removed by
a faithful old domestic.
'Why are the blinds all drawn d9wn~~ said Mary,
chokingly, to herself. 'ill want light a~nd. air.' So
with a feeling of suffocation, and a strange sense of
misery, as of some intolerable load up~n her heart,
she put her head behind the blind, and gazed upon
the lawn and trees; and then she wi4ied to run-
to fly-whither, she cared not, if it wer~ only away;
to be any where but in that dim, desolate house.
She heard a voice in the room, 'Miss Mary, the
dressmaker wishes you a few minutes.' She looked
round; a black dress was in the woman hand, she
burst into tears, and wept long and passionately.
The dressmaker was gone, and the house was still
and silent again; and again the longing~ as of a pri-
soner for escape, seized the child. She crept into the
hall, looked around her, and seeing no one, gently
opened the door and fled. With beating heart she
ran until she had reached the glen; and then, faint
with the violent exertion, and, the terror of' pursuit,

she threw herself upon the grass besi~le the grey-stone
where her mother used to sit, and wept herself to
sleep. Two hours passed over, and still she slept;
the sense of misery was lost in tlT~at sweet uncon-
sciousness.
The loud bark of a greyhound awakened her, and
immediately her favourite Di bounded towards her,
whined and licked her face, and barked again. She
looked up, wondering where* she #as, and saw the
old butler, John, approaching her, while her father
followed at a little distance. John looked grave and
angry at first; but perceiving the tVaces of tears on
the countenance of the child, who jnow stood trem-
bling at the remembrance of her flight, he said, 'lilt
is as II thought, sir~ this is where my lady used to
sit, and Miss Mary has been weeping here.' The
old man's lip quivered, and tears rolled down his
cheeks.
Mr. IPercy spoke not, he sat dow~ upon the stone,
and folding the child to his bosom his tears also, of
'K
which the fountain had hitherto b~en locked, burst
forth in a copious and refreshing to rent.
At Mary's earnest request, she ~was taken to see
her mother. Awe-stricken, she conid not speak, she
could scarcely breathe. From the cold form before
her, so still, so white, so solemn, life~ intelligence,' and
love were gone; and in the heart df the child, filial
affection gave way to dread. She dared not touch

the~corpse; and wondered when nurse kneeled down
and kissed the clayeyy hand. Her dreams that night
were frightful; she screamed in her sleep, and
awakening, entreated to be taken to nurse's bed. Her
father bitterly regretted the shock which had been
given to her, and ordered her to be carefully kept in
future from the room of woe. She never identified
that solemn form with her mother; dreams of heaven
visited her again, and there in the midst of flowers,
and woods and sparkling waters, her~ fancy placed the
beloved one, as a being of light, and joy, and beauty;
~~-a being, having no connection now with the for-
saken clay. In an agony of grief, she saw the fune-
ral procession~ move from the house; and yet, the de-
parture of the body was rather a relief, for it was not
her mother. Away, beyond the blue skies, that be-
loved mother walked in* white with her baby brother;
and though she wept now when she thought of heaven,
it was not quite for sorrow. More sorrowful were
her tears when she thought of her walks in spring,
and of her merriment on winter evenings. So strong-
ly was she possessed by a pleasant idea of her dear
one visiting her as a ministering spirit, that on one
occasion, she actually uttered aloud the words her
heart had dictated to the unseen, whom she imagined
to be present.
Mr. Percy was not a religious man; he lacked
the true source of consolation in his bereavement;

and it fell with almost intolerable weight upon a heart
that had nothing to sustain it but I~uman pride and
cold philosophy. He had loved his wife passionately;
and with her death the sun of his existence had gone
down. He never spoke of her even ~o his little girl;
but in the twilight when formerly ~they romped to-
gether, or when her mother used t? sing, he often
took her on his knee, and while the f~re was unstirred,
and the shadows were deep in the room, he rested
his face upon her silken hair, and she thought that
he wept. In daylight he moved about sad and silent,
calling her some me to walk with him, but uttering
scarcely a word as they went. The glen he utterly
avoided.
Thus the child became more and more contempla-
tive, and a shadow of premature sadness settled upon
her youthful features. She delighted to go alone to
the shrubbery, or to entice nurse to the glen, where
she marked every varying aspect of the changing sea~
sons with deep and passionate deli~ht. Kature be-
came her idol; and while she wandered in the midst
of its beauties, her imagination rove I in the fields of
the unseen, and she held strange converse with. the
loved and the lost.

MRS. PERCY had superintended the education of her
daughter, which was now for a time neglected, except
by her French teacher, who still visited her twice a
week. M. Bouquet was a favourite at Avon House,
and sometimes Mr. Percy conversed with him for a
little after Mary's lessons were over. Mons. B. ven~
tured one day to suggest that the time was now come
when the careful cultivation of his pupil's mind had
become a matter of deep importance; her talents he
believed to be considerable, and her disposition so
amiable, as to present the promise of a very superior
character.
'My sister has been urging me,' said Mr. P., 'to
send my daughter to be educated along with her
children, but this is a sacrifice which I cannot make.'

EDUCATION.              21

And this was a sacrifice which it would not at all
have suited the plans of Monsieur, that Mr. Percy
should make at present; though he looked forward
with exultation to the time when, after his own ineth-
od, she should be torn from her parent's heart, He
therefore replied that it would be cruel in the extreme
to deprive one so solitary of his only remaining corn-
fort; and suggested that a judicious governess might
carry on her instruction without depriving him of her
society.
Mr. P. started. He disliked governesses from
unfortunate recollections of his own childhood, and he
haughtily replied that he would not see a governess
at his lonely table.
Monsieur B. dropped the matter for the present,
trusting that time would assist in effecting his pur-
pose.
Soon afterwards, during a visit from his sister,
Mr. P. was again assailed by remonstrances on the
subject of Mary's education. He firmly refused to
part with her; but promised to consider of the pro-
priety of engaging a governess.
About this time Monsieur Bouquet mentioned to
Mary that he was obliged to go to the continent for a
week or two, and that, if agreeable to her father, her
lessons would be carried on during his absence by a
countrywoman of his own, who had resided some time
in England with an aged father, whose death had left

her solitary and poor. 'My only fear, Miss Percy,'
said Monsieur, 'is thai you will be so much ena-
moured with your new teacher, as to dismiss me on
my return.
'Non, non, Monsieur!' replied Mary, laughing,
'you know I like old friends better than new.'
Mons. B. was six weeks from home, and he had
proved a true prophet;, for so completely had his sub-
stitute wound herself around the heart of her little
pupil that the child wept at the announcement of her
departure.
'Dearest papa)\ she entreated, 'do invite Made-
moiselle Dupin to stay with us a little while; she is
so very good, so very kind; she tells me such beau-
tiful stories, and seems to love me so much; and she
has no home, papa: she must seek one among stran-
gers in the wide world, Her mother is dead, and her
father is dead,' added the child, bursting into tears.
Mr. Percy took her upon his kneewiped her tears,
and after a pause inquired, 'Should you like to have
this lady for your governess?'
'Oh! charming, charming! ' cried the child, spring-
ing up and clapping her hands. 'Shall I go and ask
her? Let me run, papa, she is not gone yet.'
~ Stop, my love,' said Mr. P., smiling; 'you know it
will be necessary first to make many inquiries. So
you must not excite expectations which may be disap-
pointed.'

'In~juiries? papa. Oh! you know she is good and
gentle: at least, I know; and Mons. Bouquet told me
how kind she was to her sick father,' urged the little
maiden.
Mr. P. smiled again, and kissed the youthful
leader. 'You must wait,' he said; 'you must not
mention it to Mademoiselle; but I will take means to
ascertain whether she is a7 proper person to be your
governess.~
'Kind, kind, dear papa; how happy I shall be!'
And the sudden sunshine having dried the April
shower of the child's tears, she skipped about the
room and sang merrily, while her father summoned
all his resolution to do what seemed to be for the
welfare and happiness of h~s little daughter.

went to her own room to weep and pray for her d r-

Notwithstanding the change effected, White as
still with Mary more than it suited Mademoise le
that she should be; her entire removal from e
family was necessary.
One or two small articles of jewellery were mi~s~

honesty fell, upon a new housemaid. Then the but er
reported the mysterious disappearance of ~ piece or
two of plate; and, finally, a portrait of Mrs. Per~~y,

Miss' Percy until the officer came.

preliminary search was, made. That having failed to
discover any of the missing articles,~it was resolved to
proceed by rotation, examining first those serva ts
whose position in the household was the lowest, a~d
proceeding upwards, until, if not found, they should
.be sought even with the governess. This plan ~as
the suggestion of Mademoiselle, 'who' remarked that
thus the upper servants would probably be spa~ed
the painful investigation.
Nothing had been discovered; with the n w
housemaid was found nothing to excite suspicion; he
rest were equally faultless; White, the housekeep r,
and Mademoiselle Dupin, alone remained.
'It is enough,' said Mr. Percy, 'I cannot ins It~

White and the housekeeper requested that ~he
search might proceed-the former spoke faintly; he
had religious papers in her box ~which she 8hr nk
from having unveiled. The officer noticed her h si-
tation, and fixed his eyes upon her.
'In justice, sir, you must proceed now,' said'  he
governess.
"Tis amazing, sir,' remarked the officer, 'k~ow

At the foot of another and smaller box, belengi g

'That thought would shield the proved guilty, and~

Mr. Percy shrank convulsively, 'In 'my' state' ~f

Dawson was the upper-housemaid, and sh~ was

'No. suspicion rests upon us, n&amp;w that .t~ guilty
party is discovered,. but if we should hear a whisper
of doubt, we can open up all, you know,' replied
Mademoiselle.
1*ittie imagined the. simple houseke~pe~ how 'Un-
willing 'the governess would "have been "to have any
examination of her private repositories. But she
had. rendered it certain" that matters would. not be
.p~iished 4o this extremity; she knew right well where
the missing articles would be found, or she would
uev~er h.ave hazarded a search. She had in her pos-
~~~ion documents which would not baar the light of
d~yL.~~correspondei~ce with Ferrara, directions from
the g~eral of the Jesuits-~.aualyses of character-
notes .of the. ntost secret affairs of the family-a
~scheme of her operations, and a journal, on the ex~
posure of which any single-minded man or woman
would 1~ave stood aghast.
These might have escaped unread; but there
were &amp;lso s~k~eleton keys, popish symbols and books,
a manual of Jesuit moralss, and other things which
owo~d have rendered the exposure of mademoisellee
Dupiti's secret repositories' far more astounding than
if a1,l'thejewel~ in the hottse had been found in them.

some persons would. have called it intolerance to in~

are showing in what its "free exercise" consisted.
Every tree is known by its fruits; and we displa~r
the fruits of the sincere, the devoted MademoIs~ll~
iDupin's piety. The conveyance of the jewels and
plate into the boxes of the nurse, and the contrivance
of their being found where they were, could hardl~r
have been accomplished save' by a conjurer or a
Jesuit.
The end was answered, White receive her dismi~-
sal. Mr. Percy stedfastly refused to see her;' he
sent her her wages for the time she had served hin~i,
and an additional sum of money to ward off preseiit
destitution until she could find employment. S~he
received the wages-having earned~ them ~ but fold-

with the following note.

Mr. Percy was touched; he paced about the

mood, and finally summoned Mademoiselle, who had,

'Ifear that is tootrue; ~have known some strange

Mr. Percy shrank as with sudden pain. "mi..

another ~such ordeal. I fear there is no doubt of her

servants. What has now happened, will, I trust,
'quicken me to greater and more affectionate vigilance
in the care of my sweet young charge.'
'I thank you, Mademoisella.'
Meanwhile Mary had crept up stairs to. her
nurse's room. She tapt at the door, but receiving no
answer, she stood a minute, and heard the voice Qf

MADEMOISELLE'S TALE.
"Thought and affliction, passion; hell itselZ
She turns to favor and to prettiness."  HAMLIrr.
IT 'was a winter afternoon. The shutters were not
closed, nor the lights brought; but the blinds were
drawn down, and the' fire stirred, and its cheerfulxrays
glanced and flickered upon our young heroine and her
governess, as' they sat together before it, throwing
their shadows far into the room; brightening promi-
nent objects with changeful gleam, and ' deepening
into chiar.oscuro'all behind those objects~ 7afld every
recess. The lights~and. shades would have gladdened
the very soul of Rembrandt or Corregio. I{dt with
the eye of an artist, 'but with that deep poetic feeling
which was a part of her nature, Mary gave herself up
to the enjoyment of the hour. There was nothing to
mar its pleasure, for not~ merely the elegancie~of life,
but all the elements that enter into that IEngii~h' idea,
comfort, wer&amp;th~re.' Mademoiselle 'lounged iii a high-


backed seat, cushioned with green, and' her pupil,
with slow and measured time, moved backwards aud
forw~r4s in a rocking-chair, or-balanced herself on its
edge to look around her into the 'room. The child
was happy, but not satisfied; there was a longing in
her soul aft~r something higher and nobler than earth
can give, but she knew not where to seek it.' 'Tell
me, Mademoiselle,' she said; 'one of your dear de-
lightful stories about the supernatural; and first say
if you think that there really a'e angels here, up in
the height towards the ceiling, or far in the ,depths of
those recesses;' as the cherub heads and wings peep
out in that sweet -picture' of Saint- what is her
name P
Mademoiselle replied, 'Millions of spiritual crea-
tu~es walk the earth.'
'A tale. about them, then,' said her pupil.

dinner:?7 .aske.d Mademoiselle, looking at her watch.
'Dear, good, naughty papa!' said Mary, 'if he
come before we~are done, I will kiss him away again.
'Ahi here is a short one,' said Mademoiselle, and
without preface she tEus coimnenced:
At the base of the Pyrenees, in a lowly valley of
Spain stood the' castle of Don Alfonso Alcarras. His
son Ferdinand was a.handsomehigh~spirited youth;
none so graceful as he in the .festive hall, or so.~Iaunt-

manding, with slashed double and velvet cloak, he

marble forehead, and the depth of. soul in her~ large~

being.

blessed, er bountiful hand; she was as an angel of
light to many a dwelling darkened by disease and
poverty; and her alms went up to heaven as the
sweet incense flung from a golden cen~er. The very
bandit would.not have touched a h~ir of the head of
the Donna Isabella, so greatly was she re'&amp;\ered.
Thus her earliest days were passed, and many a
patrician youth sought the hall of Don Alfonso to
kneel at the shrine of his lovely daughter.
But Isabella's heart was fixed on heaven; 'no sha-

unagitation had been fostered and fed with legends

her with saintly countenatic~s, miraculous apparitions,

When the firat~-emotion had smbsided, he led her
into conversation upon the early history of the

She took the ,passive hand that rested near her

5untent~'nce, thi~.t the desolate heart was touched, and
tears rushed forth irresistibly. 'Wilt' thQu take this

Then offering his arm to Mary, he led~ her away to

without blaring to allude to the book, which Padre

The 'court was a gloomy square, surrounded 'by
dark~ *tiil0; black' doors md grated windows. The


centre door, opposite the gate, opened, and the La
Superior stepped out. She was tall and sallow, w
white -hood, serge gown, rosary 'and crucifix ;
features were fine, but stern and melancholy. Sta
ing erect, she stretched out both hands to Miss Per
then kissed her forehead, and pronounced a bene4
tion. She led her into a small room where a fru
repast 'was spread, and bade her be seated.
hushed solemnity of all around, awed and plea
her, although the place was plain even to meanne
and she felt a little disappointed by the want of h
fretted'roofs and stained windows, which, someho
other she had pictured even in the domicile of a 1
Abbess. She ate but little, and was shown to
own: apartment, which she found small and dim,
tolerably comfortable;' and she gladly threw her
hausted frame upon the little cottage-bed w
occupied one corner, for sofa or easy chair there ~
none. Two cane-bottomed chairs, a small rot
table, with a crucifix upon it, and her bed, were
chief furniture of the room; and a transient de
sion stole over her as she contrasted it with her
elegant chamber in her father's house. Shex
her eyes, however, upon the crucifix, and strove
meditate ; but her thoughts flitted to and fro in
fusion, until they were dissipated by the ringin
the convent-bell, when a sister entered 'to inqui' e
s he was sufficiently refreshed to attend vespers.

She accompanied her through the narrow corridor,
to the door which opened into' the cloisters, where
they joined the procession of the nuns moving slowly
along the aisles in their dark robes. The architec-
ture was not remarkably striking, hut the solemn
gloom pleased her ; it accorded with her ideas of
religion, which was truly a religion of the senses.
The chapel was small, but fine ; the tapers on the
altar, the officiating priest,' the dark kneeling figures
of the sisters, the high vaulted roof; filled with the
swell of music, wrought up her mind to a high pitch
of what she considered devotion. She was overcome
and wept.
The service over, the Mother Superior offered her
her arm, and conducted her to her own private room,
where they had tea alone. She spoke soothingly to
her victim; assured her of the deep interest sihe took
in her; promised her peace and holiness beyond her
most sanguine expectations, and crossing her hands
on her breast and looking upwards, exclaimed, ' Oh !
the life of a nun is indeed a holy, happy life.'
Miss Percy looked upon her with reverence and
something like affection. 'Reverend Mother,' she
.said, 'it cost me a pang to leave those I loved ; to
leave them so desolate; but the vanities of the world
were hateful to me ; I sighed, for purity and spiritu-
ality. I will pray for the consolation of my father,

may not touch a mite of it-sworn to poverty, forsootl~!
I am building up power, and am rewarded by chains
aryd slav~ry-vowed to obedience!
'My order is enriched and glorified, truly, but
what is that to me, so long as I have personal con-
sciousness, and not brahminical absorption into the
great essence of the church? What am I benefitted
by all I am doing? Like the bee, I am but toiling for
others; and when my honey is made, if it suit them, I
shall ~be destroyed. This is the fate of Rome's obe-
dient sons! Fools! to heap up treasures which we
may never touch,---to build a chariot, at the wheels
of which we shall be dragged. It is well enough for
those who fancy they have souls to be saved, and that
such deeds will save them; but for me, and for hun-
dreds like me who know better-.--who know that the
grave is our endless home-why should we deny our-
selves andtoil night and day? "Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die!"
'Rome, I could almost cast thee off, turn heretic,
and revenge myself upon thy despotism, by exposing
and crushing it! Nay, this would not improve the
case; it would not aggrandize me; it would only gra-
~ify the adversaries I have sworn to quelL
'But stay. Have I really achieved nothing for
myself? I have. I have gained a victory; there is
delight in that. I have Aaccompli~hed my purpose-
satisfied n~y will---what more could Jove have done?

My will is myself, or what am I-vanity, appetite,
fame? For these all the world labour\; but my vanity,
my appetite, my fame, are something I possess; they
are not myself: nay, they are things which may be
my masters, while my will is a part of my essence, an
emanation of my very being.' * * *
Here the father lost himself in a labyrinth of me-
taphysics. After some time he proceeded.
'It seems to be an immutable law of nature that
atoms can effect nothing separately; they must exist
and act in masses. In a universe of unconnected par-
ticles, no one particle could possess any thing except
its own existence. In an army of self-governed, self-
acting soldiers, no one would achieve a victory--all
would be defeated. Each atom shares the good of it~
mass; each soldier reaps the glory of his army. I
must e content to lose my individuality; 'tis hard,
but it is fate! The church allows license enough to
its pr ests in pleasure, if not in profit: few delights
save hat of liberty are withheld from us.
et why am I, with this burning soul within me,
kept y the tyrant laboring in obscurity? I will de-
mand a higher mission-to the salons of Paris--to the
court of princes; life I mu.9t, I will enjoy. Let those
who ave souls, labour for theirgood; mine it shall be
to li~e while I live,-.--or Rome, I abjure thee!
KPool ! might not I have wooed this heiress for
myself, instead of for the church? Ah! Padre Carlo;

'Well, he is not vulgar like Father Dennis, bu~

it for that you chose him?' said Miss S.
'Oh! never mind my reasons, choose for ~ourself~
replied Sister Agnes. 'Father O'llooran is the mor
dignified, but Father Dennis, I dare say, will be th
more indulgent.'
'And will understand such matters as mine best,
said Miss S.; 'but no, gravity is the thing whe
one is in distress. Will you, dear, request th

'Immediately, dear?' asked Agnes in surprise.
'Yes, immediately; my heart ~s breaking, and
must confess.'
Sister Agnes did as she was requested, and t
her surprise the Superior made no objection, bu
instantly dispatched a messenger for Fathe
O'llooran.
The secret was duly confided to his ear, and re
ceived with becoming concern. 'There is consider
able cruelty, my daughter,' he said, 'in treating yoi~
so. I do fear all is not right with him. For th
sake of your own peace, you had better withdraw~
your thoughts as much as possible from one who~
seems to have so little appreciation of your value.

it is well that he shows his neglect before the matter
is irremediable. You may thus be saved the pang
which hundreds feel, of being slighted after mar-
riage.'
'Is that a common case, father ~'inquired Miss S.
'I must not betray the secrets of the confession-
al,' said the father, 'but I may say that all young
women ought to mark the first appearai~ice of coolness
on the part of those to whom they entrust their hap-
piness. I believe that nineteen out of twenty mar-
ried persons wish themselves loosed again.'
'Then, father,' said Miss. S., 'you do think the
letter cool'?'
'Distressingly so,' replied the father.
'What shall I do?' inquired the poor girl.
'If after his treatment, you think him worth the
trouble,' said the confessor, 'you may say ten ayes
and perform five stations every day on bare knees,
from the chapel-door to the image of the Virgin. It
may be she will reconcile him to you, if for the good
of your soul.'
'Endure such humiliation for a man who neglects
me!' cried Miss S. 'INo, father, if he cares not for
me, I care not for him.'

What was the end she had in view? To be a stunt
-to be fre&amp; from sin, to utter no murmur, to lhwe
self subdued, to lose herself in extatic eontemplat~on,
to rise by a royal road of suffering to a throng in

gatory. Well; that was worth suffering for now;
therefore she would persevere, she would set before
her this end to inspirit her fiuiling heart, to quicken hexi
lingering footsteps. But such a load of earthiness
and sin hung around her-how was she to get rid
it ~ Only by suffering-by voluntary suffering. L
should be done. She had given up 'all her worldly
happiness, and it would be folly to lose both that and
eternal life; therefore a saint she would be, a saint
according to the true, orthodox idea, revolting as that
might be to all her natural feelings.
'I must have discipline, father,' she said to her,
confessor, '1 am still so worldly, have so much regret
for the past, so much recoiling from the present.'
'Recite the psalm Miserere,' he said, 'and be-
tween each verse receive four lashes from the hands
of two of the sisters; then pass half-an-hour pros-
trate before the Virgin, in meditation upon her
merits. Jf there are any of the sisters who you think
have a grudge at you, select them to ~give you the
discipline.'
Sisters Monica and An~elica were selected, the
penitent kneeled down, her shoulders were bared;
the women, each with a scourge in her hand, took
their places beside her; she chanted the first verse,
and then sharp and heavily the strokes fell. The
psalm numbers twenty verses in the Vulgate, so that
eighty stripes were inflicted; ~he habit was then

drawn over the excoriated shoulders, and the victim
9rawled to the image of the Virgin, where she lay
prostrate haIf~an~hour.* Imagine the effort of rising,
with the dress here and there adhering to the wound-
ed flesh, and the exhaustion which had been induced;
and wonder not that as she lay, her meditation was a
mQckery; that holy thoughts an~1 blessed feelings
refused to come, and that all her heroism was re~
I
quisite to repress visible impatience and audible cries
of pain.
Was she holier that night than before'? Alas!
no. But she almost thought she had a conflict with
a demon. This was a privilege of saintship.
Sister Agnes was next directed to fast for a week,
taking only once a day a little water and bread
sprinkled with ashes; and twice each day to proceed
round the cloisters on naked knees; then retire to
her cell, and spend the remaining hours in meditation
on the sufferings of Christ in unison with her own.
No one will be surprised that she fainted several
times while performing the stations, and no Protest.'
ant will wonder that her own sufferings occupied her
mind more than those of the Saviour. This she
deeply deplored. The spiritual exercises of Loyola
were next resorted to. Physical weakness had now
induced mental languor, for she was enfeebled by

fasting and pain; she could not control her thought
Eagerly she commenced the first sacred subject, an~
yet with all the tangible assistance which knowledge
of human nature, and ignorance of God's grace ha~
suggested, she could not continue. In ten minute~
there was a vacuum in her mind, or it was listlessl~r
roaming among images of the past, or occupied with
some petty detail of daily life. She wept, she faste
she disciplined herself; she could force the body t~
obey, but that ize~tless, roving, uncontrollable thin
the mind-what cords could bind it-what suffering~
could subdue it? Day after day, it seemed to be~
come more rebellious. Often she lost the thread o~
her subject, and had to return after an interval of~
vacuity; and oftener still, no emotion was excited~
by the thrilling theme upon which she tried to
meditate.
Well does the true Christian know the bitterness
of such a conflict; but in his case, it is maintained
in a strength beyond his own, and he is made more
than a conqueror through Him who loved him.
* Poor sister Agnes knew of no such Almighty
helper. She struggled with corruption alone.
She almost resolved to give up the contest, for
despair seized her, ~s the enmity oii~er natural heart
to divine things unfolded itself. She should never
be a saint; then let her be a daughter again. She
was only a novice; she need not become a nun. She

would return toher forsaken home. But, ah! would
she be received? Her father did not deign to notice
her now; she could not hold up her head in society;
and her soul would be irrecoverab4,' lost. Her
destiny was fixed-fixed in this breathing tomb for
life!
Such thoughts tormented her.

WE have, as yet, introduced our readers t&amp; only two
of' the. nuns of this convent-sister Moni~a ar~4~ sister

~ istingiiish them, that it is not worth while to describe
them.~ Sister Mary de Sale8 was rather young and
rather fair, and had it' no~t b~eeu for. hei"dress,, might
have been considered pretty; but even she had the
elay&amp;y conIDlexioll which want of fresh air and exer~

nuns, ever ready to assist. the iAhers, and t&amp; perform
such ittle good offices as the habits of the convent
allow d. But she went about her daily tasks~
wheth r secular or religious, quite mechanically, ana
took ittle advantage of the, permission to ~pe~k~
which was accorded at certain hours, and on certa
occasi ns.
If here was one feature of character which chiefly
prevai ed in the establishment, we may term ~ sullen-~
ness. The inmates had nothing to~ make them think,
little t make them feel, scarcely anything to~ arouse~
them om their machine-like state, but the visits of
the pri sts, and an occasional festival, when;the church
was to e adorned for, ~display, and the ~hoir~ to prae~
tise, V ewise for display. The monotQn~s , pray,
the eq ally monotonous chanting, the~ vn1ga~ ho~sa~-
work, erformea in silence, (the washii~g~d~y. was a
charini g exception,) the silent. meals, the. s9ulItesFs
obedian e, were chiefly varied by petty quarrels, ~ow~
jealousi s, small acts of' revenge, and heavy penances.
Wh 11 a new sister was admitted, it WaS nsi~l~r
her~ for while to fret at her chains, to wince ~t her
work, a d perhaps to weep over her, uiiser~y;j but in
process of time she sank into a moving statue like ,the

Yet sometimes the monotony was broken by a

which a school-girl might smile, to be followed by the

THE case of Miss S. required tactics different from
thiat of sister Agnes ; it was l~ess difficult to secure
the former than the latter ; for the relatives of Miss
S. b~ing' Romanists, were under the control of priests-.
Major O'Oallaghan and~his daughter wished to
see Miss S. in her sickness, which was duly reported
to them, as cold caught by a chill after dancing ; but
were told that she had been ordered to be kept perM
feotly quiet., Their director* went on a visit to father

THE nuns were seated at breakfast in the refectory;
not a voice was heard, for they ate ~n silence. Their
scanty meal was only begun, when ~the superior com-
manded them to pause.
'My daughters,' she said, 'a gre~t privilege awaits
you to-day. A holy man from a distant land is cx-
peeteci to arrive soon after noon wits a most precious
relic, which he will exhibit to you; ~t is a fragment of
the sword which, on the d~y of her Son's crucifixion,
pierced the heart of the blessed Yirgin: as it is
written, "Yea, a sword shall pierce thine own soul
al~o." You must adorn the chapel ~for its reception;

Y~u will be permitted to kis's the shrine in which it is
encased, and for this act you will receive an indul-

the blessed privilege.'
The hungry nuns arose from table and one of
them collected the remains of the' cal which, if
finished, would have been quite insuffic ent for their
healthful sustenance. Considerable in nt attached
to this abstinence; and several of their number con-

WE have mentiofied sister Marie as a remarkably ami-
able, though pensive girl; along with sister Tiieresa,
she had charge of the young prisoner, Phemie Keegan.
The strong piety of the child made a deep impression
upon the mind of' the nun, and she treasured up in
her heart many expressions which fell from her ward.
The Spirit of God carried them with saving power to
her heart. She had had early exercises of mind some-
what similar to those of Luther, although less intense;
she had been convinced of sin, and had fled to the
usual popish arts to quiet her conscience,---to atone
for her guilt. But the more she labored, the more
unhappy she became; all her efforts after sanctity
issued only in stronger and more fearful convictions
of guilt. So far, there was a siniilarit~r between her

case and that of sister Agnes; but tjaere was one ir~

her the means by which she had attained it, und~

one of the l~ly sisterhood, and they were commanded

by their obedience, to divulge any attempt she might
make to pervert them; but she feared not man when
duty to God lay before her, and she courageously un-
folded to sister Marie, the simple plan of salvation by
Jesus Christ, made known in the Gospel. The nun
sought no proof of the superior claim of that doctrine
upon her faith; she felt its adaptation to her spiritual
wants; she saw that what fasts and vigils, and prayers
and tortures, could not do, Christ had done; she
accepted him as her Saviour, with simple7 child-like
confidence, and the burden of her soul fell off at the
foot of the cross. Fain would she have spent hour
after hour with her instructress, who repeated to her
as time permitted, portions of the word of God; but
this could not be. To excite the jealousy of her Supe-
rior, would have been to cut herself off entirely from
intercourse with her young friend, and to s~ibject both
of them to the greatest, danger. But she had an
efficient teacher. The iloly Ghost can enlighten the
soul thr ugh the most imperfect medium; and He
convey saving truth to the mind of the nun, as it
fell in so aps and short sentences from the lips of his
suffering child. Marie soon grasped. all that was
requisite for salvation and jcLy, and became a humble
believer a heretic if you will.
Very sweet were the light and peace which entered
her soul after its long darkness and conflict; she truly
rejoiced in God through Jesus Christ her Lord


that joy strengthened her Lot a fiery trial which wa
to try her. Her youthful instructress had sought onl
to convey to her mind the truths of the Gospel; bu
these necessarily overthrew some of the errors o
Rome. The doctrine of justification by Christ alon
of course shook to its foundations that of the men
of 'saintsandof penances, and of good works; th
doctrine of One Mediator, struck at the root of adora
tion of the Virgin; and forgiveness of sins by Go
himself, rendered useless absolution~ by a priest.
Marie's change of feeling, therefore, ~ould not long
remain unknown; but meanwhile her faith rough
in her some of the graces which are ~ts fruits. She
became still more amiable than before; and sister
Agnes in particular, who had always 'loved her, now
clung to her more closely.
She ventured one day to say to her,' Sister Mari~,
I begin to despair of ever becoming a saint. You~

that I think you must have attained to much sanctity.

practise; help me, Marie, if you can.'
'I practise no secret fortifications at all,' replied
Marie.
'None!' exclaimed Agnes, in surprise.
'None; h~ve found One who bore all the penal-
ty of my sine ~&amp;,,me.'

all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all thy strength;"
and again, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus
Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha." A horror
of great darkness fell upon me; I became conscious of
a fearful sin I had never seen before-the absence of
love to God and Christ; and while I tried to love
I felt I hated. Then I was anathema, maranatha.

'A sweet conversation, sisters, apparently,' cri
the lady Superior, suddenly appearing, 'you wi

'We were speaking,' replied sister Agnes, 'i
our sins, of the difficulty of resisting them, and of ti
penances which ~vere ordered sister Marie for h(
great sin of not loving God.'
'Sister Marie had better think a little more

- the Superior, 'she is the Qate of Heaven, the Que~

Agnes was astonished, and still more so when tE
reverend mother commanded Marie to retire to hE
cell, where she was to have nothing but bread and w~
ter for three days. She forbade sister Agnes t
mention the subject of their conversation to the re&amp;
and remarked, 'There is too much reason to believe
that that girl is touched with heresy.'
'She 1' exclaimed Agnes, 'who i~so gentle an

'Little know you of obedience,' said th~ Superio
snappishly, 'if you consider sister Marie obedient

Sister Agnes followed the lady, and then was de-
sired to lace her boots. As she stooped to obey, and
commenced the lacing of' one boot, the Superior
placed her other foot upon the head of the nun, who
attempted to look up in mingled astonishment and in-
dignation; but her head was firmly pressed down,
and she was commanded to be still.
'I make a footstool ofyour head,' said the Superior,
'to test your obedience, and your humility. It is
good for you. You will please not to stir till IL re-
move my foot? Lower your head.'
The poor girl repressed by a sudden effort, her
rising anger; resting upon her knees and hands,
with her face nearly touching the ground, she remained
until the blood suffused her brow, her head palpitated,
and she 5~sped for breath. The Superior at length
released her, satisfied with her "obedic~nce."
She felt insulted, but she tried to acquiesce in the
scale of her merits-a scale light enough, she knew.
She never saw Marie again; the nun was heard
of no more; no one in the convent seemed to know
what had 1~ecome of her. Agnes felt that she had
lost a friend, and her heart was withered mo~e and
more. She strove to dismiss from her mind the
words which the Superior had stigmatised as heresy
but a portion of them stuck fh~st, like an arrow in her
conscience ;-they were the same which had wrought

'I'm not saint enough to wear your eyerence~s
cloak,' said sister The~resa; 'maybe S . Benedi9t
c-ame down and made a mistake.'
'Erom their mortified appearance,' said Father
O'llooran, with a grim smile.
Now i~ather Dennis was a true Irish cleri&amp;d
dandy; fat and grea~sy-1ooking, with broad cheek~,
large mouth, and small eyes. His unbrushed clothes
were made of the finest possible cloth, tinted with.
dust and daubs. How much this cloak had cost I
am quite unable to tell; but its clasp was of massive
gold, and) its lining of the richest silk, torn here and
there, while the mire through which he had riddeii
had not been brushed off it for a month; it used to
wear gradually off when the~weather was dry.
'The cloak seems to have vanished,' said theLady
Superior, when the lobby had been searched vain.
'Oh!' cried Theresa, 'by the Virgin! this wil~
be it; they have fun up stairs---someone is dressing~
up ; 'if your reverence will come and see we'll find i~
on some sweet sister.'
The priest Th~ughed, and followed the nun, as sh~
led the way up stairs; but she ran so fast, that th~
stout friar had fairly lost h~s breath before he was
~, half way up~ the ~staircase~ He had to stand painting
to recover.

SISTER AGNI~S~
'Thg your pardon, father,' said Theresa; 'I'm so
1 t with fasting I never touch the ground at all, at
all.'
The nuns were quite grave ;~ no cloak was among
them; and they all turned out to search, but in vain~
'A light seemed to flash upon O'llo~rau, and he
suddenly inquired, 'Are your daughters all 'safe,
kreverend mother? Can any one have fled in dis-
guise?'
The bell was rung, all ,,the nuns assembled; no
one was missing. Miss S. and. the heretic girl were
thew sought.; the latter was net to be found; and the
servant nun now mentioned a priest having let him-
self' out at the front-door.: Father O'iooran darted
to the lodge, ~and inquired if the ~uter gate had been
opened since he came in.
'Only for his rever9n~ce,? replied the .~woman.
'Whose reverence?' . inquired the ~r~est, fiercely.
'The; sko4 father that went out in .the hull's, and
said niver a benedicite to a poor, sinner that opened
for him,' said 'she.
'It was a girl in priest's clothes; how dared you
let her out?' thundered' Father O'llo0ran, sei~i1ng
the porteress hy ~tli~ shoulder,' and~shaking her. The
woman shrank~back.
~ An' ~ your rivereiice,' she said, ~ how wa~
any~ livin' woman to ~think that there was a ~irIeen
under a holy priest's. cloak, when Satan himself

puffed out the lamp, that I couldn't see; and for tinder
respect to his riverence, I did not keep him in the
cowid till I lighted itV
'You'll 4ceep a, different gate to-morrow,' cried the
priest.
'Aid now,' said Father Dennis,' his' sense of' the
ludicrous' softening his anger, 'now that the girleen's
off with"my habiliments, ihow am I to get' home in th~
cold and the rain, barrin' the scandal of their being
t
found upon a woman ?"'
'Turn it to              charity, father,' said
the account of
sister Theresa, 'the whole paAsh will hear of yoiu~'
benevolence to-morrow, and praise your~ alms, to the
honour and glory of the holy 'Catholic Ohu~ch.'
'And who will get another cloak for mb?' aske4
the priest: 'How am Ito get homo?'
'Since we never go out, we have nothing where-~
with to supply thi&amp;want,' said tb~'Superioress, looking
puzzled.
'The night is dark,' 'said sister Theresa.. 'If the
holy father should go home in some of our garments,
no one will see. The reverend mother 'has warm'
hoods; and a shawl or two may be found in the
convent.'
With some difficulty and much laughter, the holj
father was arrayed in hood and shawl, and took hi~
departure 'along with . his brethren. Three young
fellows, half-tipsy, were going merrily home in the

gleam of a4lanip fell upon the. hood.'
'Och'! and by troth! what's this?' shouted one;
'a runaway nun-saze her!' No sooner said . than
done; six brawny arms were forthwith around Father
Dannis, who struggled violently.
'By the Y~argin! but she'\ hasn't fasted at all at
all,' cried one; 'she's as fat as Father Dennis.'
'Let go! you scoundrels!' cried father O'llooran,
seizing one by the collar, and draggir~g him o11 The
man ~vigorously used hi~ ftsts, and then a regular
wrestling ensued; the English priest stood aloof, and
father Dennis, rather~roughly handled, shouted, 'Irs
never a nun I am, but your own priest, ye graceless
gorsoons! Let me go, and ill luck to you!'
The fellows sprang off, and making very low bows,
one of them exclaimed, 'Bedad, ye'r riverence, it's
niver ~ mother's son would ha' thought ov ,ye takin'
the veil!'
'I ax ye r           pardon,' said the 1~er;
'but the honor an' glory o' the holy Church wash so
strong in me, that I couldn't let a blessed nun escape
widout bringing her back.'
By this time father O'llooran had finished his
conflict, having got his handsome eyes a little black-
ened, to render him the more interesting atAhe trial
on the morrow. Some explanations ensued, and really
for once the priest~ ~considered it p~Aitic to tell the

I

truth, and nothing but the truth; although the whole
truth-that is, how Phemie Xee~aii got into the' con~
vent-they did not consider it r&amp;piisite to relate.
Groat was the astonishment of father Dennis to
find his cloak at home before him. Poor Phemie's
conscience would not allow her to deprive the father
of his goods; 'that would be stealing ' she said; so
when about half-way from the nunnery, she took it
ofi; folded it up, and, before going to Mr. MoMurphy's,
she knocked ~at the priest's door and silently handed
in the parcel, to the great astonishment of 'the poor
housekeeper, who concluded that her master had been
murdered, and forthwith raised a commotion :in t~ie
village.
The people were proceeding with lights to search
for their priest, when the trio* appeared;. father
O'llooran and the Englishman properly arrayed, aiid
father Dennis 'in' a' nun's hood and shawl. Many,
loud and varied were the exclamations of astonis~i-
ment and commiseration, and not a little was the
suppressed laughter which his appearance excited.
With the ready wit of an Irishman, skilled in' equiv-
ocation,' he told them he had been robbed of his gar-
ments, and father O'Hooran added the conjecture, that
the robber had been so plagued with evil spirits as to
be obliged to disgorge his .booty.
'Sacrilege is a fearful crime,' said he; 'and to rob

Mick rehearsed his part to admiration, and was
duly cautioned to put in nothing else, lest he should
tell what was not the truth. 'For how,' said the

stood to be the law 'of the land;' and why a few

Rome, were to be paramount in this portion of the

witnesses for the defence were then called. Fa..

much annoyed by the agents of the nssioi~-sehool
bribing away the children of their flock, b4odd; and
clothe , and. 'money, and instilling\ into their minds
conte pt of their religion and of their parents. S~v#

ers ha been induced to attend. the Protes~tant' meet..
ings, d to abjure the Roman Catholic 'faith, chiefly
through bribery. The morality of the parish was
much -i paired. The Protestants had frequently in-
vited discussion on the articles of faith; and on the
evening of the riot the two priests, accompanied by a
few e bers of their flock, went to the place of meet~
ing t accept the challenge. They found the doors
bolted, n , on knocking, were assailed by a storm
of abus . But at length they were admitted, when,
upon a templ~ing to speak, they were silenced by
hooting and howling, and finally sticks were resorted
to, to d ive them out. In self-defence they used their
own, bu not ui~til their lives were in danger. As
to Phe ie Keegan, she had in terror' fled to the
monaste y, and requested to be admitted. But the

The journey was performed partly by moon
the sweet sadness of which agreed with the to
her mind. IBut she regretted every day that passed,
for it brought her a day nearer to her imprisonment
again. She sometimes wondered whether escape was
not possible, whether she might nt~t suddenly dive
into the depth of a forest and elude her keepers; but
that eye of father O'llooran-oh! it haunted her like
some evil spirit. She felt that she was contin-
ually under its inspection; and if for a quarter of an
hour he was away, the I~'rench priest mounted guard,
and the eye seemed transferred to him. The small-
est auberge at which they rested, was always secured
in some manner against liberty.

* 'Fathers,' said sister Theresa, to the priests, 'we
are somewhat sad on leaving oui~ own country, and
this sisterZf mine has another sorrow. May nuns for
once have recreation?'
'What r&amp;~reation do you wish?' inquhed the
French priest.
'To see the beauties of Genoa. We could not be
seen in a heretic land, but in the realms of the true
fait1~, we ~should not be hooted at. We would learn
to love the land of our adoption.~
'I think we may give our fair wards this enjoy-
ment,' said father Bourienne to father O'llooran.
'Surely,' replied the latter.
Ah! reverend fathers, you have your prisoners
now, where, if they attempted to escape, they will be
hunted down by the police. They are safe at length.
,The view of Genoa from the sea is truly "superb."
Skirting, like a vast amphitheatre, a noble bay, it
rises tier above tier, on the side of ~the Appenines;
fortifications, churches, villas, adorn it, and orange trees
on flat roofs of the houses add to its~ picturesque
effect.
The streets through which they passed to the
hotel were narrow, but some magnificent churches
were greatly admired by the travellers. They visit-
ed the cathedral, and joined in the evening service,
and next morning drove to the sea shore at the earnest
request of sister Agnes, who deeply longed once more

to yalk by the waves before being shut up for ever.
It seemed to renew the days of her childhood, and
she stood gazing fixedly upon the long, pale-blue
waves rolling slowly in, their crests broken into snowy
foam upon the smooth sand ; the &amp;xquisite shading of
blue and white and sand colour ; the fresh, yet gen-
tle breeze; the pure soft sky ;. the line of green be-
hind the beach, and farther back, the noble forms of
the Appenines, combined to weave a spell almost
overpowering to the heart of the long-imprisoned
nun. She was not permitted to remain long ; the
priests had busines in Genoa; and the girls were to be
shut up again till it was transacted. They were taken
to the convent of St. , and indulged by the
abbess with sauntering in. the spacious garden kept
in order by the nuns. .Here were fountains, orange-
trees, and all manner of paradisaical things ; and if
nature could have made her adorers happy, sister
Agnes had been happy that day. She reclined be-
side a fountain under a shade of myrtles and orange-
trees ;-adyet she wept.
.Sister Theresa chatted merrily with the French
nun who accompanied them. She was unacquainted
with Italian, and therefore could converse with none
of the sisters of the convent. The superioress alone
spoke French.
Next day they set off for Florence, through a
magnificent country. Ascending a steep road that

expanse of sea on the one hand, and of hills on 'the
other, hills at whose feet, and along whose sides,
were scattered villas, and vineyards, and orchards.
~All the way to Florence it was one continued luxury ;
and the environs of that city, different as it is from
Genoa, presented new-beauties to their eyes. Stand-

' Is it in Florence we are to live 3' she inquired.
'No, my daughter, not 'in a town. Important

north, where the scenery' is still more romantic, and
the air more healthful. ~We shall remaain in Florence
a few days. Among the sisters of the convent there,
you will be~happy for awhile,' said father O'lloortrn.
Very magnificent was the exterior of the convent;
very dismal and horribly filthy was its interior,
Many of the nuns were vowed to perpetual silence,
and they moved bout like spectres. 'They were
clothed in filthy rags. The establishment was one

ing, wounded by stripes, stupified by silence, the
nuns of this convent looked scarcely like human beings,
and the olfactory nerves of poor sister Agnes rebel-
led sadly~againt the odours of this " most sanctified'"
place. If the object of sanctification were t1ie utter
degradation of the human species, it had been truly
attained here.
'Alas ! sister,' she said to Theresa, ' What if our
convent should be like this ? we cannot exist.'
' We need not,' replied the sister with an expres-
sion of countenance that terrified the gentler nun.
'It may be like that at G3enoa.'
~ It may--I care little.'
The meal that day was of black bread, grapes,
-and sour wine ; in the morning they had bread and.
water. Some of the nuns ate their bread sprinkled
with ashes, others had their cup of water soiled. The
silence at meals was unbroken, save by the tread of
the sisters who waited upon the rest. Not even a
legend of a saint was read at meals. The convent
was seldom swept; the clothes of the sisters were
never washed ; the garden was uncultivated ; so the
nuns had nothing to do. They sat in listless indo-
lence, or performed stations on bare knees, or flagel-

lated themselves or others, or kneelen1 before a pic-
ture telling their beads. The vacant countenance of
more than one bespoke her an idiot ; the wild snatches
of song that proceeded from another, as she passed
unheeded to and fro, told that she was. a maniac.
Agnes wondered how any one could retain reason for
a twelvemonth there. Sister Theresa had managed
to gain the intelligence that one third of the nuns
died mad ; that few of them lived more than five
years.
Sister Agnes was horror-stricken!
-' The abbess is a wonderful saint,' said father
O'llooran, when he had resumed his charge, and they
proceeded northward, ' Her nuns usually die in the
odour of sanctity ; itais not uncommon for angels to
be seen hovering over their beds, ready to carry their
souls to heaven. It is av blessed place-the convent
of Santa.

THE spirits of sister Agnes had been miserably de
pressed ever since she had received the intelligence
of her father's death. The beauties of nature, through
which she had passed, had exercised a tranquillizin~
~though not an elevating effect upon her mind; bui
the gloomy fanaticism of this convent sank her agair
into the depths of despondency. These cadaverous
women, hunger-bitten~ diseased, filthy, with county*
nuances indicative of continual pain, she was told were
great saints, and she trembled at the portals of thai
saintship which she had been so~eager to have opened
for herself. Purgatory could be. scarcely worse, she
thought, ~than so sad an* existence in this world; and
in her recoil she had almost said, "Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we die."

There is but a step from fanaticism to epicureaw
ism,~ just as there is a very slight division between the.
credulity that accepts all things and the infidelity that
believes nothing.
She remembered Genoa~, and the luxu6ous rooms
of the priest's house in London, andi she became puz~
zied with her reflections.
One of the sisters of this convent had features so
exquisitel~chiselled, that in youth and health she
must have been beautiful; but this sister had only
one eye; and the one side of her face contrasted
strongly with the other. Agnes was told that saint
Helena,-.--all the sisters here were denominated
'Saint,'-had been r~rnarkable for her loveliness; but
finding it a snare, and wiwilling to be distinguished
by any thing but her humility, she had, by the advice
of her confessor, submitted to have her right eye burxi~
ed out. When the abbess had finished the recital of
this story to sister Agnes, she proceeded to speak of
St. Rose of Lima, a virgin who, by austerities un-
sparingly practiced, attained to sublime heights of
sanctity. * 'Even from the cradle she shone with~the
presages of future holiness; her face being wondrous-
ly transfigured into the image of a rose, caused h~r

said the abbess, 'wear similar girdles, even after they
have been scouredd'

show you a very holy penitent. She has expiated
many sins, and the Madonna will not permit h~r to

sanctity.' Sister Agnes was then led down a dim
staircase, into a passage perfectly ~iark, and in-
0
describably chill, being underground. The abbess
struck a light, and desired the nun to follow her.
Agnes trembled; she apprehended some trap for

k
after the abbess. They entered a cell dark as mid~
night; the walls were crusted over with mould, and
a foul, damp* odour filled the place.~ A coffin was
on the ground, and in it, amids't ashes, lay the sem-
blance of a human being, attenuated and filthy to
horror. The creature raised a bloody hand; it had

' The convent of Santa Helena cannot be worse

a deep ravine, they espied the~. thundering waters.
They often left their carriage to walk; ~and the spell
of nature again was wound around 'the heart of the
young enthusiast who had renounced it. Yineyards
clothed the lower parts of the mountains in many
places; and stretching far up towards the deep blue
sky, pine-forests towered on the heights. They halted
for a meal beside a rivulet that came tickling down
a hill, and they drank of the sparkling water. A
black wooden cross was erected by.its side, and they
prostrated themselves before it. Their conductor.
told them that a man had been murdered there by a
bandit, who, after paying largely to the Church, and
receiving absolution, erected the cross in memory of
his fault. 'Ah! 'tis good to be a bandit, and gain
money,' said the conductor, 'money procures all things
-bread, grapes, and salvation.'
'Dishones% gains need to be atoned for,' said father
O'llooran.
'Ah! they atone for themselves,' rejoined the man.
'Divide them with the church, and the one half sauc-
tifies the other. It is easier to get absolution for mur~
der and robbery, than for eating mutton on Friday.'
A week or two afterwards, the conductor was
snatched from his family and thrown~into a Tuscan
dungeon, for blaspheming the church.
To the great satisfaction of sister Agnes, it was
necessary to discard the carriage, and alternately to

sa~lAe for wheeled vehicles. There was there
nothing to obstruct the view of the magnificent s
ery, and the progress being slow, it could be leisu~
inspected. But long confinement had diminished
power of walking in the nuns; and ere long they
greatly fatigued. They halted for* the night at a
OQnvent-among the mountains.
INothing material occurred during the journ~
"sister Theresa was permitted a little to enjoy her ~
of rattle; and sister Agn~s to sit sometimes up~
rock meditating upon the scene spread out before

cbthed Appenines; varied beauties lay all around;
groups of chestnut trees; green pastures on which
cattle and sheep were browsing; ~easant~' huts, and
elegant villas. Agnes looked on with melancholy
pleasure. 'Beautiful,' she said to herself 'beautiful;
buttl shall be shut out from nature"-s~1~i in among
the walls, and perchance the dungeons~ there.'
I have been told,' said father O'llooran, as if he
had read her thoughts, ' that the gardens are lovely,
and the walls are oVertopped by those grand moun-
tains. You will find that convent a beautiful and
peaceful home, my daughters~'
Sister Theresa looked fixedly upon the? counte-
nance of sister Agnes, into whose eyes tears were
springing.
There was a bi~idge further down the river; but
a little skiff waited for the party, and they crossed
directly opposite to the convent. A smooth lawn ex-
tended to the edge of the water; a high ~and exten-
sive wall ran along the bank, and in the centre, a
noble gateway reared its massive columns. The bell
was rung, and an ancient porter opened, admitted
the party, and closed again the thick' iron-studded
doors.
'In prison again!' was the mental exclamation of
sister Agnes.. Yet the prison was a noble one. The'
monastery of the monks occupied one side aiid the

down the court. Like the generality of Tuscan villa
the lower story of the convent was arched, and my
tles, and orange-trees, and flowering shrubs, gre
here and there against it. The nuns were conduct
to their own quarter, while the priests were receive
by the Abbot on the~ opposite side.
Sister Agnes felt a little relieved when the do

thing of. comfort might be found there.
The abbess appeared-a little sprightly Italia

was tastefully arranged, and ~somewhat of a coqueti
afr pervaded her monastic dress. ~She saluted ea
of the nuns with a kiss upon the cheek, conduct~
them to her own room, and set before them fru~
bread, and wine.

with Rome, has. taken the place of F' worship in spirit
and in truth." Dead lope has an easy resurrection;
she readily 'revives when called; and this evening
she opened her eyes and languidly raised her head
while sister Agnes listened to the rich Italian music,
and gazed upon the noble architecture around her.
She whispered, but her whisper was faint-that
peace and holiness might after all be found on earth.
We shall see how long the echo of that 'i~hisper
lasted.
- On the following morning the new residents were
taken to see the beauties of the monastery; for the
abbess was very proud ofNier domains. They in-
* specter the fine paintings in the church and in the
cloisters, along with some statuary and- other treas~
ures which adorned them. Many of the pictures
were really excellent-some by the bes1~ old masters.
A Madonna by Guido, especially attracted the atten-
tion of sister Agnes, for she was a. devoted idolater
of the Virgin. Some precious' relics too were kept
in silver shrines; one of the many thousand nails of
the true cross; a fragment of the Virgin's petticoat;
bones of two or three saints; a bottle of martyr's
blood; and a few hairs plucked from the garment of
St. John the Baptist. These were most reverently
exhIbited.. There was a fine sacristy also, designed
by some eminent architect; and an edifying array of

cross bones and skulls. The nun's garden was truly
beautiful, according to the Italian style' of gardening.
There was a fountain in a~ myrtle-shade, surrounded
by rich velvet turf; which especially delighted our
heroine; the flower parterres ~were very rich. A
little rivulet murmured through the midst, and es-
caped through a grating under the wall to join 'the
river, the banks were of turf mingled with flowers,
and orange-trees; and here and there a chestnut
drooped' 'its branches to kiss the water. If sister
Agnes had not known that human passion can trans~
form paradise into pandemonium, she would have
dreamed of paradise here. But she now knew what
it is to be a prisoner, and she had discovered that
something in her own heart which ever disturbs
repose; and therefore her pleasure was mixed with
sadness~ '
*1
She was surprised by the announcement. that a
play was to be performed in the evening by several
of the sisterer and that the Abbot, the confessors,

The washing-day in Ireland had not more greatly
surprised sister Agnes than this evening's amuse-
ment. The play was well performed ; the priest~ ap-
plauded vehemently, and remained to supper with
the nuns.
When sister Agnes retired to her cell, she pon-
dered wonderingly upon her varied experience of
convent life-the vulgar Irish establishment, the
luxurious 0-enoese; the wretched Florentine; and
now this scene of beauty and gaiety; and ever and
anon there flitted before her the priests' house in
London, with the apparition of Mademoiselle Pupin.
The whole formed a mystery which she~could not un-

know the dept1~ of villainy, which lurked under the
polished and dignified exterior of the priest; for with
his acute perception of' character, he had soon disco-
vered, that with sister Agnes he must be a sair~t, if
he would maintain influence over her; and tha1~ the
infliction of a little painful disci~1ine would but
strengthen his ascendancy. FLe easily perceived th~t
many of the monks of~t. Helena were very irreligious;
and he was glad to find a few young men of a differ~-
ent character: one-a priest, he perceived to. be just
the sort of person suitable to direct the conscience of
sister Agnes. Not that he cared about conscience;
he had none himself; but it is one of the instruments
for making fast the chains of the Church, and, as such,
requires to be judiciously handled. Sisters Agnes
and Theresa were therefore introduced to~ father Fran-
cesco; the French nun found a confessor of a differ-
ent stamp.*
Father Fran~,esco~was about thirty years of ~,ge,
of a handsome but pensive Italian countenance, and
the gentle bearing of nobility. HighTy intellectual,
his mind often rebelled against ~the absurdities or his
faith, but with many a penance he had striven to check
this deadly sin; and as often as reason asserted her
sway, so often had he resolutely chained her down.
He was constitutionally devout; his nature impelled

him to worship, and, unconscious of the true object of
adoration, he bowed before the god~ which Rome ha~
exalted; and if the qualities which she ascribes to
them sometimes failed to awaken his veneration, he
clothed them with others created by his own fancy.
He dwelt among the romances of the past-the annals
of martyrdom, and miracles, and transcendentalism;
and he panted to emulate the Christian heroes of an-
tiquity, who foiled demons in the desert; or the mis-
sionaries of more modern times, the Loyolas and Xa-
viers of world-wide fame.
Unlike his associates, he was not satisfied with
bodily service. It was the mind which he sought to
discipline through the sufferings of the body, and it
was sin that he sought to subdue. For this purpose,
though not a Jesuit, he ardently followed the course
of meditation prescribed by lLoyola, and had really at-
tained to some height of what he considered spirituality.
He loved nature: her beauties in his own romantic
land sent a thrill of joy through his heart; and he
peopled her solitudes with saints and angels, and made
them vocal with Ayes and Paternosters. It will be
perceived that his character bore a considerable i'e-
semblance to that of sister Agnes; his desires and
'aspirations were the same as hers; but he had the
vigour which springs from comparative liberty; while
she had the languor and depression which fasten upon
the slave. Father Francesco could refresh his spirit

with the beauties, and his frame with the breezes, of
his much-loved Nature; sister Agnes pined for this,
but pined in vain. The benevolence too, and human
sympathy of the monk could find a sphere of action
among the poor and the miserable; and this kept his
heart alive: while the nun, sighing for affection and
communion, dwelt apart in enforced loneliness and
uselessness, and in bitter solitude of spirit. She was
about to find a mind like her own-a mind to hold
communion with hers: but, alas! it was but to in-
crease her misery.
The account given by father O'llooran to the con-
fessor of his new penitent greatly interested him.
The establishment was a large one. There were
the abbess; a vicar or assistant; a mistress of the
novices-for here the novices were not permitted to
have intercourse with the nuns, a very politic regula-
tion~-a bursar, sacristan, fortress, infirmarian, keeper
of relics, &amp;c. The nuns at this time were twenty-five,
the novices six.
A few of the religious formed almost a separate
community; they were thoBe who desired to become
saints. According to the directions of St. Liguori,
they abstained from the opera, never indulged in the
parlatory, ate very sparingly, and often fasted entirely;
held no intercourse with the priests and monks who
i~isited, except for confession; scoured themselves
frequently, washed seldom, performed the most menial

and disgusting offices from which others were glad to
escape; entirely avoided the bath; and preserved an
almost continual silence. There were four who ob-
served these rules in all their strictness.
For a few days all went on si~oothly; the three
sisters freshly arrived, were initiated into the ways of
the monastery, had their work assigned them, and fell
into the routine of life there. But sister Theresa's
liveliness attracted the attention of some French
brethren, with whom she could converse; their visits
became too frequent, and the abbess frowned; in fact
she used herself to hold a little harmless ftirtation*
with one' of them, and she felt jealous of the new nun.
With Italian vindictiveness she resolved to punish
her, and sentenced her to be confined to her cell for a
fortnight upon bread and water. She likewise told
Sister Agnes that the instructions of an abbess were
positive, to permit no peculiar friendships among the
religious; that she perceived a dangerous attachment
to have sprung up between her and sister Theresa,
and therefore she must interdict them from speaking
to each other~at all for a month; and after that, from
ever conversing longer than five minutes in one day.
Sister Agnes bitterly felt this privation, but she sub-

emitted quietly. When not employed, she used. to go
to the garden to enjoy its beauties; but a dreadful
solitude of heart oppressed her. At these times her
father's image haunted her, ~nd her distress was ag-
gravated by her utter ignorance of all the circum-
stances of his death. Nothing but the fact itself had
been vouchsafed her. During her travels her mind
had been sufficiently occupied to keep it comparative-
ly calm, but now it preyed upon its own imaginings.
She went to confession, and discovered that father
Francesco understood all her feelings. He soothed
j~er; appointed some religious exercises appropriate
to her case, and enjoined frequent prayer to the Ma-
donna, and meditation upon her merits. Very gently
he spoke of her father, and enjoined hei~ to feel con-
vinced of the salutary nature of the discipline by
which she was kept in ignorance of the circumstances
of his death. He would not permit her to reproach
herself with being the cause of it. The act of devot-
ing herself to a religious life was a right act, he said,
and she was not answerable for the consequences.
Alas! by what precept of the divine law did he find
that act to be right'? The truth is, a doubt arose in
his mind even while he spoke; but that doubt was
smothered, for the Church had given forth her in-
fallible decree.
Never had Sister Agnes been so tranquilized by
confession. It was not long before she returned.

Stunned, desQlated, sister Agnes retired to her

took their $aces; and when the service commenced,
the scene t6 a stranger would have been imposing.
The magnificent architecture, the gorgeous altar-piece
-the work of Titian-the images of saints, the dark,
kneeling figures of the sisters, their sudden rising, and
the bursting forth of the rich peal of music, formed a
spell not easy to be resisted by the young and en-
thusiastic. Yet to many of the nuns themselves this
daily routine was wearisome and monotonous; and
this morning many thoughts were wandering to some-
thing which was to break the tedious dulness of their
existence-a gorgeous ceremonial awaiting them.
Matins finished, a few lingered behind in the
chapel, telling their beads; some went to the garden
to gather flowers, and others proceeded to the con-
fection-room to finish the preparation of some of those
beautiful preserves for which Italian convents are re~
markable, and which, by the bye, are like the lives
of their niakers, bright and tempting to the eye, but
insipid in their cloying sweetness to the taste. The
glittering frost-work sparkled upon the almost tran
parent fruits, and the triumph of their art was com-
plete.
Our English nun, with one or two companions,
walked slowly to the garden.
'We are allowed to speak this morning,' said she.

nor &amp;our rose will find liberty I assure you, miladi
Agnes, however you may try.'
The nun-s assembled in silence to their morning
meal of black head and grapes and water, during
which not a -word was-spoken. When they had left
the refectory-' You are to dress my hair, dear
Agnes,' said. a young novice, who was that day to
take the veil, 'dress it like an English lady's.'
Agnes threw her ar~is round the neck of the love-
ly girl; and as she kissed her, a tear fell upon her
bosom, but one word of pity she dared- not speak.
'Have yoi not been happy since you became the
bride of heaven ~'inq~.ed the novice.
Very happy,' was the reply, th~ words of which
4
were contradicted by the:tone.
'The world is s~ hollow!' said the novice. 'My'
father was the only being that loved me, and -he is

grating. He fancied that her eye was fixed upon
him, and as he scrutinized her countenance, so sad,   4
yet so sweet, a strange feeling passed over his heart,
and his eyes became riveted upon her.
Reader, have you ever seen, in the features of an
unknown person, something that touched a chord in
your spirit for which you could not account? You
could not detect a resemblance to any one you loved,
but a thrill as of some old affection passed through
your inmost soul, and you could not but gaze. So
felt Colonel Hayward; so was he attracted to watch
the nun, while she stood immoveable as a statue,
with her races turned towaris him. He became al..
most unconscious of the service, and forgetful of his
sympathy with' the heroine of the day.
At length theloud burst of the hallelujah chorus
awakened him from his trance. All wa~ over, and
the new. recluse was about to be lost to the world for
ever. A basket of fresh flowers was handed to her,
and she advanced to the* grating to distribute them
to the bystanders. Colonel Hayward pressed for~
ward among the rest, to receive a flowered from the
fair but trembling hand; but, when he approached
the 'grating, the nun he had been watching 'rushed
forward to it; throwing up her arn~s, and dashing
them against the bars, she screamed wildly, 'Uncle,
save me!' In vain she clung to the grating; in a
moment she was drawn back, and the curtain fell;

She was placed before them, and the gag w s

Despair now seized the nun, and it gave h r
strength. Hope had fled; she saw her doom, a
summoned courage to meet it,-such courage as ma -

abbess spoke. 'You are accused,' said she, 'in t
first place, of disturbing profanely a holy solemnity

'I object to the charge of profanity,' said the nun

APPENDIX.
WHERE startling statements have been made they
will be shown to be quite consistent with the author-
ized tenets of the Romish Church. In' doijig so, it
will he requisite frequently to quote from the wriP
ings of St. Alfonso Liguori. These have been by
that Church stamped with infallibility. In 1803, the
Sacred 'Congregation of Rites decreed, that "In
all the writings of Alfonso IAguori, edited an~
unedited, there was not one word that couldjustlyb~
found fault with." Four days afterwards Pope Piu~
VII, solemnly approved and ratified the decree.
On 5th June, ,1831, another decree of'the Sacred
Chamber confirmed the former; and in 1839, Li~uori
was canonized.
The extracts here given 'from the writings of the
latest saint of the Holy Church will be found to b~
authentic, although the author of this volume has not
personally drawn the gems from that mine of morality.
If a dian~ond be real, it matters not that the jeweler
has not 'himself excavated it from the earth.

One of the chief dangers of BAtish convents arises
from their being affiliated with others on the. conti~
nent; so that on the smallest risk of discovery by, or
interference on the part of friends, the prisoner can
be deported to a Pbpish country, where no law can
reach her; where, even in case of escape, she would
be hunted down by the police as a criminal; ~nd
where horrors unki~town may be perpetrated. Tli9
moral and religious ~tate of some Continental nur~-
neries has been of late laid open; and a recent cas~,
widely published, has proved that the mere caprice
of an Abbess is sufficient to determine the destination
of a captive, in spite of ailremonstranee and opposP

The correspondent in Rome of the Daily News,

"1 ~visited this morning the works going on in
the subterranean vaults of the Holy Office, and~ was
not a little horrified at what I saw with my own eyes,
and held in my. own hands. Though I have been
familiar with everything in and about Rome for a
quarter of a century, I confess I never had any curi-
osity to visit the Inquisition, taking it for granted
that everything was carried on there fairly and
honestly, as I was led to believe by people worthy in
other respects of implicit trust. Be0ides, the place
itself is out of the beaten track of all strangers, and

in a sort of cul-de~,ac behind S . Peter's, where it
naturally retired to perform its blushing operations,
and 'd~ 'good by stealth.' I was struck with the out-
ward appearance of civilization and comfort displayed
by the building, which owes its erection to
author of the last creed; but on
character 'of the concern was no entering, the real
longer dissimulated.
A range of Strongly-barred prisons formed the
ground-floor of a quadrangular court, and these dark
and damp receptacles I found Were only the prelimi-
n~ry stage of probation, intended for new-comers, as
yet uninitiated into the Eleusinian mysteries of the
establishment. Euitering a passage to the left, you
arrive at a smaller courtyard, where a triple row of
smalbbarred dungeons rise from the soil upwards,

accommodating' about sixty prisoners. These
barred cages must have been often fully manned, for~
there is a sup eme ry w constructed at ~the back
of the qua angle on the ground-floor, which faces a
large gaa' en. All these cellular contrivances have
strong ir rings let into the masonry, and in some
there is large stone firmly imbedded in the centre
with asi lar massive ring. Numerous inscriptions,

atores mendaces exterminabuntur.' I read another
somewhat longer, the drift of which is, 'The caprice
or wickedness of man can't exclude me from thy
Church, 0 Christ, my only hope.' The officer in
charge led me down to where the men were digging in
the vaults below; they had cleared a downward flight
of steps, which was choke~I up~ with old rubbish, and
had come to a series of dungeons under the vaults
deeper still, and which immediately brought to my
mind the prisons of the Doge under the canal of the
Bridge of Sighs at Venice, only that here there was
a surpassing horror. I saw imbedded in old masonry,
unsymmetrically arranged, five skeletons in various
recesses,'and the clearance had only just begun ; the
period of their insertion in this spot must have been
more than a century and a-half. From another vault
full of sculls and scattered human remains there was
a shaft about four feet square, ascending perpendicu-
larly to the first floor of the building, and ending in
a passage off th~ hall of the chancery, where a trap-
door lay between the Tribunal and the way into a
suite of rooms destIned for one of the officials.' The
object of this shaft could admit but of one surmise.
The groun 'of the vault was made up of decayed ani-
mal matter, a lump of which held embedded in it a
long' silke lock of hair, as I found on personal 'ex~
examination, s it was shovelled up from' below. Why

lying outside the structure, this charnel-house should
be contrived under the dwelling, passes my ken.
But that is not all: there are two large subterranean
lime-kilns, if I may so call them, shaped like a bee-
hive, in masonry, filled with layers of calciued bones,
forming the substratum of two other chambers on the
ground4ioor, in the immediate vicinity of the very
mysterious shaft above mentioned. I know not what
interest you may attach to what looks like a chapter
from Mrs. Radcliffe, but had I not the .evidence of
my own senses, I would never have dreamt of such
appearances in a prison of the Holy Office, being
thoroughly sick of the nonsense that has for years
been put forth on this topic by partizan pens."

volume, was extensively, circulated, and promptly re.

their memorials to the Queen, and~also to Parliament,
and the subject was taken up by influential members
of both Houses; and the bills of Mr. Chambers and
Mr. Whiteside, for inspection and regulation of nun-
neries, have been submitted to the legislature. A.
ropish faction seemed sworn to defeat them: by fair
means they cannoP-they will not long do so by foul.

One, in the shining circle of England's nobility,
has indeed been plucked from the mela~iieEoTy seclu-

of Britain bestir themselves in behalf of their weeping
sisters, whose very cries f~r liberty do but commit
them to deeper dungeons. Let the case of the op-
pressed be carried to the foot of the throne. J#t the
Queen of England be petitioned to recommend to the
consideration of Parliament a measure for the opening
of the Convent cells; not to force out of them any
who may wish to remain, but to give free egress to
those who pine in the chains of the Priest and the
Abbess. The genius of British liberty detests the
underground mysteries of the DOonvent. If all be
right which is enacted there, why is not all open?
If the inhabitants stay willingly, why are they shut
in with high walls and iron bars? Are they prison-
ers, 'or lunatics, or both? Both, we believe. Many
a nun dies raving mad. Some try voluntarily to seek,
as they vainly think, the ways to heaven. Let them
stay. It is only the constrained, the oppressed, the
wretched that we would liberate.
