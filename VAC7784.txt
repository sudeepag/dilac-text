In fact it is scarcely too much to say that, with the late bondsman's admission to stations of high public trust, the struggle has already be-. gun. As the black man accumulates wealth and, intelli- gence in keeping with his improved opportunities, and- especially as he reaches political position through the instrumentality of the ballot, it is n6t 'to be- supposed that-he will patientily consent to remain socially ostra- cized on account of the, color of his. skin. At the same time it is equally certain that any claim he may make in  that regard will meet with a bitter, and probably pro-- . ., tracted, resistance Hence whatever tends to illustrate  the passions which are to take part in the -coming con-  test between the strongest forces of our nature, canno. -. be wholly devoid of profitable entertainment. .' :;   : With a change of circumstances not here necessary to : be detailed, came a change in my location and employ-' s ments.

An inspection of the manuscript, for such the package' was, showed an attempt on the part of the deceased to follow my suggestion with regard' to the tale I have re- ferred to. It was manifest, however, that the' work had ; been ' but partially accomplished when failing 'strength  had- arrested its progress. Portions of the story had been apparently prepared to the writer's satisfaction, while other parts remained only in outline. No word-of,infstruction or request from the author accompanied the document. Left thus tomy own respon- sibility, and still entertaining the views relative to the value-of the tale I have already signified, I felt it to be a duty to secure its completion. Accordingly I set about the: execution of the task by supplying, as best I could, th e-arts that were incomplete, and. by introducing suo:, 3 rei'^f^^rilS ; in:the balance as seemed to be called fii ;: b ^ ^ owever, consistedlof nothing more than modifica: -(: '.f:rr )ti!,o ::the sakle of greater intelligibility, in dialect, as?-I:r:; -.  di  n i: dnce'rtai conversational passages, and a thor- } ;"--" ," a:stiution of names, founded upontthe apprehension ' ' -:i ti:ifihOse given in the original' draught might possibly : -lWato' identification, and be productive of unpleasant  !  :,v::&ssf S -;.'

His eyes, which were overhung - ,bybushy brows until they somewhat resembled dormer- 7: windows, were grayish, large and cold.

'One "affair" in which he '" had: figured, quite established his reputation. The parties ;:had met, exchanged shots, and then had shaken hands. - ,^There were whispered insinuations of sharp practice :,:;:nm orethan one occasion in his business, but all in a; ;proessional way, which assisted in bringing confiding ^t^ ,Itents. , ..  :, Jits,:office was in a central and prominent building.

I 3 some bound and some in paper, of the most popular sen- sation novels of the day. Upon still closer inspection ,it might have been found that the dust had not accumulated to the same depth upon thispclass of literature as upon the leather-protected volumes, suggesting that the latter did duty chiefly on exhibition as. evidence of the erudi- tion. the establishment was understood to -contain. It should be mentioned, however, in justice to the respect- able head of the office, that for the tomes of' lighter liter - ature he was not responsible, they being the property of two subordinates, half clerks .and half students, rendering service on half pay, in whose charge this room was usu-  ally  left.  .     ' The -other sides of the apartment were taken up by windows, a tall 'case of pigeon-holes crammed with iman- uscripts and old correspondence, and a couple of desks g .:. at which the students or assistants 'referred to were sup- s posed to pursue their labors and studies.        : ' Besides the students, the only regular occupant of the . \  room was Tully, a colored office boy; so named by some- , - body--his mother probably--at a period beyond which -  his. memory ran; but whose classic appellation his:, mis- : chievous room-mates had taken the liberty of changlngi/ - ; by the ,substitution of a letter, into "Bully." -. '  - Tully, or "Bully," the name he most frequently had to . !: answer to, was a waif in the most absolute sense. He  belonged to no race of human beings. He had had a    i: mother; and, as for that matter, a father -too, who, being -Y a man of wealth and high social position, some .others, i ? more fortiunate than he, were ,proud and happy to address : . ^ as the author of their being. But that. great and. good ' ii man, as society regarded him, would have turned ip gt- :1 nose in horrible indignation had Tully, the nlm r, pre- . -. :^ sumed upon such: a liberty.

Tully's X countenance told the -tale of his maternal progeniture. : - That 'was quite sufficient to'absolve the aristocratic white man from all obligation to the yellow cub he had helped I :to bring into existence. Some might think there was a - moral claim in the case, but if there was, it troubled i either parent nor child. The latter was quite indifferent to (the luxury of a father. He had heard of such a parent as he had of heaven, with a vague idea that both were '. good things in thleir way; but beyond that he neither knew nor cared. " ". :The result of such 'anomalous position was, that the boywas neither a white person nor a negro. The white ' idrace, to which he bore the nearest kinship, repudiated -I ,him' Utterly; whiile -the blacks could not rightfully claim ' him as belonging to them. He had no people. That , -'he'-, did'bel1ng. to somebody, however, was proved by a I dee:d of triansfer held by Seabry Anthony, in which it was expressed thiat, in consideration of one thousand dollars, , 'hid and received, all right and title in and to him had -:' -::11'become the property of that respectable barrister. The  'instrument was: signed' by the worthy and eminent indi- . :-: -;::;idualirwho was understood to be the natural progenitor- w:!:: i wer Natural his' conduct might appear'to some- -":"h' '"tle:-'c:e aforesaid.

His time was largely occupied in sitting target forthe paper-pellets and tobacco-quids the latter were 'at inter- C ' vals moved to .discharge at his head. 'Sometimes he. ( was set up as, judge by his tormentors, and gravely ad- dressed as "Your Honor," when,; as dpposingcounsel, in the course of moot trials, they were inclined to exercise their wits upon knotty legal questions. - But in such cases, t " he was no exception to the rule which makes'a judge odious to the losing side. A,decision being always ih- sisted upon, his unfailing reward was a cuffing from the unsuccessful pleader.  But nothwithstanding occasional discomforts, his situa- tion was by no means a trying nor very disagreeable one. The punishments to which he was exposed were no greater than a " nigger " was made to endure, if not such as he positively enjoyed.  Had he reflected-upon the- subject at all, it is possible that he might have been brought to a feeling of adequate thankfulness. As it was; he knew his position well enough to give ready obedi- ence to his master, and to grin good-naturedly when the aim of the students, in hurling their harmless projectiles, happened to be more than ordinarily accurate. By way of compensation his tormentors occasionally supplied him with small sums of spending money, and-what- inf the end proved to be of much greater advantage-assisted him in acquiring a knowledge of reading and writing,- for  which, since he had become-an inmate of a law office, he had conceived an extraordinary longing. ^,  Nor was the slave-boy's experience, at this time, de- void of other profitable results. One advantage he -pos-  sessed was in being presumed to have been born without' :; ears,' except when directly spoken to by his superiors .  when they were required to be-sharp enough.

But -as Tully-" poor Tully!" :perhaps sone one will be moved, to exclaim, in view of i,-hi isolation from humanity-is not to figure as actor or hero, in any sense, in the scenes and incidents hereafter -tobe introduced, an apology is, at this point, due to the reader for the attention that has been bestowed upon him.

On the opposite side of the table was a well-worn -lient's chair; so that between, the anxious seeker after legal erudition and the attorney was a formidable barrier of documentary matter, across- which the man of law was accustomed to gaze with dig-- nified and awful gravity, his eyes speaking when his lips were' sealed. Into this. inner room, in the year i8-, a young man was ushered by Tully, who, that duty performed, took his - station behind his master's chair to await orders,- and, , where his presence was quite overlooked. The visitor "had the exterior of a gentleman of the peculiar Southern ' type, or what has long been recognized as such.- His apparel was faultlessly fashionable, but carelessly worn;  his manner confident and aristocratic,' butt marred by  , swagger; his countenance handsome and distinguished, but exhibiting evidences of fast living. He was clearly  "somebody," for on'his entrance-a most unusual thing -Lawyer Anthony rose from his chair and stepped-quite  round to the clients' side of the table, warmly greeting.  the new-comer, and inviting him to a seat. Having-  politely inquired after his health, the attorney proceeded;  in a most unprofessional way, to .refer to a subject con- : cerning which a. person of his standing might be, pre-  sumed to be profoundly ignorant.           -.

Grandaville, or the person addressed by that name, did not appear altogether to relish the subject introduced, replying rather evasively, and changing it as soon as he could with reasonable politeness. I have some business i your line, Mr. Anthony," he said. "Ah!" rejoethe lawyer, settling himself back in lhis chair, and(puttg on his professional look. "I am yours to command for anything in my profession, pre- pared to render the most conscientious service." "I want no conscientious service," replied Grandaville bluntly. "I want help in a matter in which conscience is' out of the question-in fact' apiece of downright ras- cality."  "You-you astonish me, Mr. Grandaville!" began Anthony with an air of offended dignity, making a move- ment as if to rise. "What do you take " "I take you for :a lawyer--no worse than the majority of your profession--and no better. Pray don't be dis- turbed. I don't propose to question your honesty, except by assuming that your practice-professionally, I mean- has an honest side and a rascally side. I want the bene-. fit of its rascally side :., that's all." To this plain- statement, the attorney making no reply, perhaps because he had none that was satisfactory to make, Grandaville continued: :J ," You need not be alarmed. My business will require nothing at-your hands worse than your action in the case o6f the Bolton heirs, and the Moffatt insolvency settle- ment, sand .probably a'half-dozen other cases I could mentio spon^i little reflection." ; ,It is sunnecessary, Mr .Grandaville," responded the 4 8 lawyer coldly, "that you e uter upon a review of my pro-. i;. H fessional- eer. I flatter myself that it presents nothing '^ \, ,*  ' , * , .'  , ^  '    , . (   - o' Lawyer and Client.'           19 I need be ashamed of.  I will assist you, if I can.- But ) let me know now whether you want merely my profes- sional services, and the responsibility of the business, whatever it may be, is to be yours.-  - "I want you to act solely as a lawyer, Mr. Anthony. All responsibility otherwise shall be mine." "That quite alters the case. We lawyers, Mr. Grand- aville, are often required to do things professionally at which our consciences, if we were acting in any other ca- pacrty, would rebel. You see the difference, isuppose?" "Hcan't-say-that-I-do, but I am no lawyer, and con- sequently not versed in lawyer's ethics. But that's your affair, not mine." "Well, well; state your case." "I wish to deceive a young lady '" * "Young gentlemen 'do not generally need the help of a lawyer to do that," interrupted the counsellor with a comic expression of countenance that was the caricature of a smile. "Into the belief," continued Grandaville, without seem- ing to notice either the lawyer's remark or the tone of levity in which it was spoken, "that a certain thing is legally accomplished, when, in' act; nothing of the kind is intended." "A sham marriage! You do not mea-  " "Nothing of the kind. Listen. The affair is this: I am about to marry a y6ung lady who' is the owner in laW of a valuable lot of negroes which she has derived through the will of a relative. The negroes she wants to , set free, which, by the terms of the will, she can only do upon attaining a certain age; unless before that time she marries, when she can do so at once with her husband's co-operation. - Before she will c6nsent to the marriage being solemnized, she -insists upon some legal document  '        -   20      The Sisters oOdelxcans. which will .work the negroes' manumission--a sacrifice which I, as her intended husband, cannot afford to make. Now you see the point. What I want is something to satisfy the lady-something on its face appearing to ac- complish what she requires, but which in law will be of no earthly account. That's my plan. You are a good enough lawyer, I take it, to prepare a document that will answer my purpose." ' O! is that all? Not such a diabolical plot after all. A- young, romantic female, with certain silly, philan- thropic fancies in her head, which she has obtained from novels, or. other equally mischievous books, of which there are entirely too many in circulation, wants to do-an- unreasonable and indefensible act, which you propose to prevent by the use of a little legal strategy. A clear case of justifiable deception' unquestionably, looking to the greatest ultimate good of yourself, the lady and the negroes. I can see no harm in it." ":That would be a very good way to put it, Mr. Anthony, if you were addressing a jury of twelve nlen iho did. not know their own minds. Your argument,. lowever, is wasted on me. My mind's made -up. I can bee nothing in the affair, I am perfectly ready to admit, but base and cowardly knavery, to which I resort only- because it is a case of absolute financial necessity."1 "Before I can give you any assistance in the matter, VMr. Grandaville, I must have a copy of the will under which the lady in question holds title to the negroes," ;aid the lawyer. "So I supposed. There is the document." With that Grandamille took a paper, folded into' pack- ge, from his pocket, and handed it across the table. The awyer took the paper, opened it, threw himself back in his chair, crossed his feet upon the table with 'his heels   Lazwyer and Client.       21  on a level with his nose, -and proceeded deliberately to read.                  , The document proved to be a copy of the last will and testament of Howard Mathewson, deceased, regularly probated in the proper court. It began pretty much in the usual way. After stating. his belief in the goodness and mercy of the Supreme Being, whose loving-kindness' he expected to enjoy in the life beyond the grave, the testa- tor went on to declare that he had accumulated a consid- erable property as the result of many years of patient toil, the greater portion of which consisted of negro slaves; that he had reason'to believe that his relatives, who would be his heirs-atf-law, the majority of whom resided in New England, whence he had emigrated years before, . were imbued with the false and abominable -heresy of abolitionism, and he feared that, in case his slaves passed into their hands, the accumulations which had cost him so much exertion and industry would be sacri- ficed to an execrable fanaticism. He, therefore, be- queathed all his estate, real, personal and mixed, includ- ing his slaves, to Isabella, infant daughter and only child of his oldest and best friend,; Ferdinand Castellos, and issue of his marriage with Juliana Castellos, deceased, cousin in the fourth degree to the testator, knowing the mind of the devisee to be yet too immature to have re- ceived any-erroneous impressions on the subject of own- ing and holding slaves. To provide against -the contin- gency of the said Isabella acquiring false notions on that subject, whereby the evil which he deprecated might fol- low, it was directed that she should have no control over the slaves bequeathed, to manumit or otherwise dispose of them, their issue and increase, until she had attained, to the age of twenty-four years-at which time of life it was to be presumed she would have outlived any foolish '. * .           .    22      TThe Sisters of Orleans.  and unsubstarntial'opinions she might before that time have imbibed. Provided, however, that if she married before reaching that age, she could at any time thereafter , ; dispose of the negroes with the consent and co-operation of her husband, who would be presumed to suppl the judgment she might lack; and in case of marriage, such consent and co-operation should always thereafter be nec- essary. '- Ferdinand Castellbs, father of the beneficiary, in con- sequence of the faith reposed in his judgment and sound- ness of views on all questions by the testator, was ap- pointed -to execute 'the will, and specially charged with its faithful performance. After having carefully read the document to 'the end, the lawyer elevated his eyes and suffered thepn to rest for a considerable time upon the ceiling; then, turning to Grandaville, he Said: "Of course the young lady is not yet twenty-four years of age?" "But little more than twenty." "Hum! hum! 'I see. Then if she marries at present, without an ante-nuptial agreement securing the freedom of the negroes, for which the marriage might possibly be a sufficient consideration in law, she forever puts it out of her' power, except with her 'husband's concurrence, to carry outher philanthropic intentions." "Precisely," responded Grandaville. "You have now reached the point to which I have all along been direct- -ing your attention. I wish to persuade the young'lady that, in marrying me, she is accomplishing the liberation of the slaves several years sooner than will otherwise be possible; when, in fact, she will forever be putting it out 'of her control, and so making her object absolutely unat- :taimable. Can it be accomplished through such a d'ocu- :ment as I suggested?"           -  #      .  .         . -X* i\   Lawyer and Client.

Homogeneousness, under -the circumstances 7 of its creation-organization it 'cdn scarcely r  be said to have-could not be looked for. Made up of little by little from nearly all portions of the - T ? habitable globe, the lines that have resulted from the A unionof the parts-those seams 'which a composite fibr ic must have, if the simile first introduced is to be continued -have not had time to disappear.   . *;j That the combination of nationalities thus fornmed is  superior to any of the parts separately considered, I  believe to be a proposition established by the verdict of acknowledged results. Philosophise as the advocates of the Old World's social systeins may upon the danger of combining representatives of different peoples and differ- ent classes in a community of equal pivileges, the experi- ment, as tried in our own countrr, testifies powerfully, if not conclusively, in its favor. Who that has studied the  effect with tolerable candor will deny either its actual  practicability or its elevating tendency? How far the - practice may be safely and profitably carried, when color enters as an, element, time must determine; but the prin- ciple is assured. - - i   ;i In a society like ours, the stereotyped notions of older - communities that are fouhded upon the ordering or the  accident of birth, scarcely exist. Such a thing as the "family" is, hardly known -among American institutioins. - 2      . !  '     \  '   *  * . :q   26       liThe fSisters of Orleans. An ancestry is not looked for; and blood itself-that most sacred of all possessions in some people's eyes-is accepted as it comes, as a thing to be neither remark- ably proud nor ashamed of. With us, generation suc- ceeds to generation, not so much like one link in a chain to another, as like the annual ,yield of the soil to that of the preceding season. Each is an independent produc- tion, to be measured or weighed according to its abun- dance or quality. . No man in America takes a position by inheritance. His father's mantle is buried with his father's person. Instead of the name of an ancestor bearing its possessor, as a boat in the water bears its occupant, it is more often received and carried as the triveller bears his pack. It is sometimes a burden--rarely a help. Ancestral fame, consequently; in ourI market is a thing which neither makes nor breaks. It is a commodity without a valua- tion. The blood of a family here, so far from flowing through generations as a brooklet pursues its way through successive meadows, as in the Old World, resembles rather a mountain torrent-sometimes expanding into broad sun- lit basins, and sometimes rushing boisterously through narrow and crooked gorges quite overshadowed by moun- tain and forest. The result is, that society is forever in a transition state. It reminds us of those boiling-springs which are perpetually reversing the order of their parti- cles. In the everlasting ebullition going forward, involv- ing the constant interehanging of the parts, it would be supposed that the course of individual drops would soon be lost sight of, and the. entire mass bIcome indissolubly blended. Such is the case, to a certain extent, undoubt- edly; but is there'no exception? In America,' it is said, the/question of a man's origin rarely affects either his social or his business standing,   By Way of Preparation.       27 beyond the influence it may have upon his own character. Yet it is the purpose of the writer of these pages to relate a story, purely American in its incidents, which will depend for its interest chiefly upon - distinctions and prejudices founded upon an inheritance of blood. Nor are the conditions it will be found to involve either occasional or exceptional. No more common or power- ful sentiment than the one upon which they rest is- known  among a people proverbially positive ' - - h likes and dislikes. And what will be found to make the story more extraordinary is the fact-that the dis- tinctions upon which its leading incidents are to turn" -although the author does not write with any purpose  of enforcing a dogma-are distinctions of caste, not of  merit.  There is an exception, therefore, and one so marked     i and potential that its effect has often been to bring upon inoffensive men, if not the best in the community, the; conteimpt and persecution of the worst, upon no other ground than a  difference in birth. To the intelligent  reader it is scarcely necessary to explain that the excep- tion which is so novel in its features and pronounced in      its results, involves the question of color. I   need only appeal to the black man, whose blood is  vholly of African descent, to prove how much of a load Le was born to carry with him through life, under the hadow of American democracy. It is not necessarythat  e  should have felt the weight of legal servitude, to which: ie majority'of his race in this country have been exposed, realize the merciless, cutting discrimination to which e   accident of parentage has doomed him. He has      a arned what it is to be socially accursed. He has found  at to be black is worse than to be criminal. The seal    I rich Heaven, in its inscrutable foreordination; has set-          28      The Sisters of Orleans. upon his brow is more terrible than- the mark of Cain. His lot is one admitting of no alleviation. Guilty of no crime, he can make no condonation. Born to a social ostracism which has had no inception in reason, and which is'infinitely more galling than physical slavery, he soon discovers there is no, ransom for color. All his life long must he journey beneath a cloud- deadlier than the inight-shade. Nor does thetrial end with death. The grave, which is supposed to be the receptacle of all mortal sorrows, 'gives him no assurance of relief; for full well does he know that the life he leaves behind him in the souls and bodies of his children is to be a continuation of the same unequal struggle-the same remorseless, reasonless pro- scription. ' What- more cruel torture. to any' reflectivel' being than the bitter knbwledge that he must deny him- self ,the consolations of family and home, or transmit, as - an interminable curse, an inheritance of shame to the 'innocent, issue of hiis blood.? : But there is still a greater sufferer, Would you know who he is? Seek out the person whose skin shows merely the trace of African kinship-less than the mu- latto's -the Octoroon, or, possibly one with not even so much of. the fatal contamination, and his experience will advise you. Such an one is compelled to, bear not merely the full weight of odium attaching to negro origin, but he has 'superadded a harrowing, sense of personal injustice. He feels that his rightful place is with his brothers and sisters of .the favored race, to which the pre-, qprnderance of his blood allies him, even as he finds him- self forced back to the ranks of the proscribed to wlo6m he bears the slightest relationship. He is permitted to enter the gates of Paradise, but to partake of. none of its sweets. Could there be anything more galling than the '  .       , -   By ' Way of Preparation.  '    29 existence he leads? .Whatever his aspirations, he can j" make no progress towards a higher social station. dare not raise his eyes in the spirit of honorable love to one whose blood may be but a particle purer than-his own, however powerfully his heart may be stirred; and as for  his sister or his daughter, though her soul may be as stain- less as a seraph's, she cannot receive the smile. of one whose birth has been a trifle happier than her own-even while love laughs at the distinctions of social caste-save. at the sacrifice of all that honor holds dear and virtue sacred. A single drop of blood may be all that separates them, but that single drop is as formidable as if it were an ocean. That one fatal particle taints the whole life current from the fountain to the grave. Society never forgets nor forgives it. While the crucible of an in nse democracy goes on melting and mingling the contribu- tions of nearly all lands, blending them with a harmony which has excited the world's profoundest admiration, no sooner does that one forbidden portion enter the solution than the whole becomes a chaotic, worthless mass, to be rejected with infinite scorn. And why? Is it because color is naturally offensive to the white man's tastes? If so, we might,look for the prejudice to be as wide-spread as the blood of the Caucas- ian, and all races, whose skins are darker than his own, to share proportionably in his dislike. SOrfar from such being the case, 'however, in the majprity of countries where men of lighter shades predoninate, the African meets with no repulse on macount o  his complexion; and, even in America the native Indian, whose skin -is nearly as dark, and whose character is immeasurably      i inferior, is often the object of a romantic admiration.     The origin of the antipathy I, have described as so harsh    in its animosities and so exceptional in its practice, is , At              ,   30      The Sisters of Orleans. tndoubtedly traceable to the influence o6f an institution which was itself an exception in the'system of govern- ment under which it prevailedl Founded upon the idea that property could exist in man, that institution, for its own justification, was forced to teach the doctrine of the -inherent inferiority of the race upon whose degrada- tion it built its strength. Although the institution itself has passed away, it has left its impression, like an un- seemly scar, upon the American mind in one of the most deeply-seated prejudices the world has ever known, or can know. As the reader is to witness the workings of that preju- dice in the incidents which are to fill the following pages, he will not be surprised when I invite him to a field in which, more than anywhere else in this country, it has had its most striking illustration. Nowhere within the United States might the antipathy of race to race, on ac- count of color, be expected to be less violent'than in the State of Louisiana; and especially in the city of New Or- leans, at a period prior to the late Rebellion. That city, besides having a population of a more than ordinarily miscellaneous description, possessed a large African ele- ment, and while many of its colored residents were slaves, a no inconsiderable portion were free, and embraced a fair representation of wealth and educational refinement. Were the negroes, on that account, treated with more con- sideration than elsewhere? Alas, no! as many a man- free, intelligent and proud-spirited-could testify when silently smarting under-an indignity from one of the low- est of the dominant race on, account of his complexion; andS which he dared not for his life resent; as many a woman-virtuous, beautiful and accomplished-could tear- fully confirm who had learned from sad experience that, spite of the graces of person, the endowments of intellect,   By Way of P epa atin,.       31 and the attractions of external wealth, an inherited stigma, of which she' had ever to wear the evidence upon her brow, entailing a curse seemingly as ineradicable as that visited upon our first parents, was forever to seal against her the gates of society's adorable Paradise. Ei *     .W1   CHAPTER III. THE MASTER AND HS PLANTATION. {" -J-- O be sure I will! Nothing could give me greater pleasure than to bear you company. Thanks, many thanks for your kind " "Then let us be off." With this unceremonious check to the voluble flow of his companion's thankfulness, drawn out in response to an invitation which had clearly been received with greater satisfaction than it had been given, the last speaker arose and strode from the room. The first speaker, nothing daunted by the other's manner, if indeed he noticed it at all, after standing in pleased contemplation for a few mo- ments before a large mirror, followed in the best of humor, and was soon by his'side. Arm-in-arm the two men proceeded down the street, until lost to view in the hurrying crowd. Before undertaking to follow their footsteps, I shall embrace the opportunity of more formally introducing the persons, of whom a glimpse has, thus been given, to my readers. . The one first to leave the room, whose speech and manner were abrupt almost to incivility, is not al- together a stranger, being no other than the Grandaville who appears in the introductory chapter of this volume. Some idea of the man can be had from his conversation, as given there j but as he is to bear a leading part in the incidents hereafter to. be related, a brief sketch of his history, with a passing reference to some prominent points in his character, may not here be amiss.   The  Iasler and-His Plantation.   33 He is manifestly the elder of the two men just brought a the reader's notice. - Precisely his age it would be difficult to tell, because of the uncertain effect of indul- gence in the more popular dissipations of the day, of which his countenance furnishes too conclusive evidence. A certain maturity of expression is, likewise, incident to a positiveness of disposition, of the existence of which, in his case, no judge of physiognomy could be, mistaken. The first impression of the man is by no means wholly a disagreeable one. As in all faces of commanding pres- ence, for such his strikingly is, perfect regularity of feature. , is not to be found. His brow is too square, and the lower portion of the face too massive, and, it must be added, too sensual, for thorough symmetry, but the effect is not inconsistent with good looks. If there is Inothing about  it positively to admire,-there is something which no one would fail to observe, and from which it would be found difficult to withdraw the eye. It is one of those faces we occasionally encounter, that at once rivet attention, al- though we cannot tell why. There is nothing about them 1 we can exactly describe, and yet we single them out in the midst of the largest assemblages, and dwell upon them in practical forgetfulness of the many by which they are surrounded. We   do' not stop to inquire what the attraction is; we simply know that our attention has been fixed by the presence of a hidden, perhaps mysterious, power. In person the-subject of our sketch is rather over the average height, and admirably proportioned. 'His figure is faultless, whatever may be said of his face. Grace and i strength have been so combined in the physical man that neither is sacrificed to -the other.        - Ruy Grandaville-for that is the name in full-is the descendant of an old (three generations) and honorable   A34      The Sisters of Orleans. family in his native city of New Orleans. What society calls " good blood " was in it at the time of its transfer to American soil. Report went so far as to say that it was a slip from the nobility of France, from which country it came-sent over to the New World to take its chances of securing a root-hold, the parent vine- probably not caring whether it lived or died. Spite of the strangeness of the field, it lived, and flourished with tolerable vigor. The great grandfather and his son and immediate successor, the first and second representatives of the family in its new location, had been men of mdre than ordinary char- acter, as appeared in the fact that they had laid the foun- dation for a considerable estate. The third in the de- scending line, the father of Ruy,-w5 a person of quite another sort. Of easy and indolent disposition, he had made but little exertion to add to /i inherited possess- ions, and his few feeble efforts in t{}a Pdirection invariably led -to unfortunate conclsions. He was generous and sociable, and rightfully esteemed an excellent citizen, but in all matters of business he had been what Americans denominate a "failure." The result was that the prop- erty he inherited, sufficient, with proper mnanagement, to have-insured a princely fortune, constantly diminished in his hands. Appearances had undergone no change, it was true. A reputatiofJor wealth was still maintained; but debts had gradually accumulated, represented by mortgages and debentures, which were slowly eating the substance away. Exposure and ruin were simply ques- tions of time. The representative of that generation, however, was to escape humiliation as,Jhe died in time to anticipate the crash in his affairs, leaving behind him the name of a rich man, and very little besides. To Ruy, the heir, descended t+ wreck. Thlere was eyen then, in the hands of a competent business man,   The Master and His Plantation.     35 35 substance enough to have realized a comfortable prop- erty; but, like American fortunes generally, being left to the operation of natural laws, the Grandaville estate, hav- ing passed the periods of healthy growth and maturity, was fulfilling that of a sure decline. The vegetable pro- ductions of the country are not more certain to ripen-and, having ripened, to enter upon a season of decadence-- than the wealth which has been gathered by the enter- prise of one or more generations, when it reaches the hands of reckless and extravagant heirs. The competi-  tion of poor men's sons, fresh, sharp'and eager, is fatal to their possession..  Ruy had capacity enough, had his abilities been turned in the right direction, to have held his own against all competitors ; but his case was no exception to the gen- eral rule. He had not only some of his father's weak- nesses, but positive vices-besides. The greatest of these was an acquired fondness for gaming. Considerable sums of money had been dissipated in his father's time among dissolute companions, and when he came into pos- session of what he at first supposed to be an independent property, it was to give loose rein to his extravagance. When the truth appeared, as it soon did, that but a nar- row margin lay between him and bankruptcy, that fact, instead of inducing reform and a prudent husbandry of resources, made him the more desperate in his ventures. He reasoned that the easiest and speediest way to restore his broken fortunes was to employ his skill with cards as a  means of pecuniary accumulation, and, as a conse- quence, played more deeply than before; although the indulgence of his evil propensity was the real motive for his conduct. Hence there was no check in his down- ward career. It is not to be inferred that, during all this time, he was -. X   36      The Sisters of' Orleants.  publicly numbered with professional gamblers, although such men were his daily companions. No young man held a higher position in good-society. As the represen- tative of an old and wealthy family, his name was the "open sesame " to the most fashionable houses; partic- ularly as the public knew very little of the real condition of his pecuniary affairs. The public, in such cases, never does know anything until ruin comes. It had never en- tered into the imagination of that stupidest of bodies, as among the possibilities, that the heir of the Grandavilles could be near the brink of vulgar beggary. Besides, fashionable society, in such cases, is not inquis- itive.' If the exterior be fair, it does not want to look  beyond and beneath.. Being of the surface-superficial itself, it is not favorable- to close examination. It hates surprises, and accepts the thinnest evidence of respecta- bility-veneer, paint or gilding, if passably laid on, as all- *sufficient for its idols. Its rule is to take things-and men are things in its eyes-as, they seem, not as they are.-;: The man was well born, wel bred, well dressed and well received, and what ir )re/d it need? Whispers there were, to be sure, that all was not right, and sober heads were sometimes shaken when rumors of Ruy's questionable courses obtained circulation, as they occasionally did. But what cared society if he did play cards and lose money, as men of wealth and fashion were accustomed to do, and, had a right to do, as long as it was. understood to be merely for :amusement. That consideration raised him quite above the class of men who played professionally, and with whoin he played. It is astonishing how long people-fashionable people, I mean-can cheat themselves with such a distinction. Htad it been publicly known that Ruy, though a Granda- ville, was gaming with a view to making, instead of losing, :; '        ' . *'   '}.1   The Iaster 'and His Plantation.   37, money; and that he looked' to his winnings as a means of, supporting vulgar existence, his position would have been gone at once. He then would have been nothing  more than a gambler--the lowest scape-grace in the social scale.  , There were two other reasons why the tongue of scan- dal was cautious in Ruy's case. ' One was that he was a miost fascinating companion, and personally popular. He had really some good quali-   A ties. He was courteous, sociable and generous to a fault, not merely with his own means, but towards others' weak-  I nesses. He could do a kind .action from an honest, though not lasting, impulse. He was extravagant, but, he did not merely throw his money away; some one was profited by his folly. When occasion required, nobody could exhibit a more splended turn-out, or give a more charming supper. He was what the free-and-easy world -which extends from the highest fashionable heaven down to the lowest social pandemonium- -delighted to pro- nounce a "capital fellow." He consequently had friends who, if not valued for their affection, were dreaded for their enmity. The other reason was, that he was a dead shot. While no one accused him of being quarrelsome, no one doubted either his skill or his courage. He had figured in several "affairs," and had killed his man-an individual who had been celebrated as a duellist  A person whose repu- tation is thus guarded, is not one to be lightly talked about.                    ,i Thus did Ruy manage to float along; but with both vices and his virtues conspiring to make him prodigal of his means, it is no wonder that the remnant of property his father had left him rapidly disappeared. .One portion of the estate after another had been parted with, until, at J   38      2 The Sisters of Orleans. the time our story opens, nothing of the once great landed property the Grandavilles had owned in the city of New qrleans remained. Even the old- homestead, the house ; which both Ruy and his father before him had been born, was sold. Absolutely nothing was left of his inher- 'itance except one plantation, located at a point some distance frdm the ciy, to which the family had, in former years, on. account of its healthful situation, been accus- tomed to go during the summer months. Something there was about that plantation which made its spend- thrift owner cling to it with: unyielding tenacity. No dif- ference how urgent his pecuniary necessities, he woild neither consent to part with its title nor suffer any en- cumbrance upon it.- For some reason it was sacred in his eyes. Of his plantation Ruy would& often speakl,-and his fre- quent reference to it may have assisted in keeping up the illusion of his wealth. Btit whatever the explanation of its owner's conduct, of the existence of that one,remain- ; ing fragment of the Grandavile estate there could be no doubt. ( Massa tRuy's Plantation " was not only a fact, but before I have finished my narrative, the reader will be acquainted both with its location and the secret of its value in its master's eyes. / , ,e'   ! '              . ' * '   "t CHAPTER IV. FRIEND AND VICTIM. ---^&^HE other party brought to the reader's notice in the last chapter, was Grandaville's opposite in almost every respect; younger, if appear- ances were trustworthy, by several years, and in comparison but in4iffererintly qualified to be reckoned a man of the, world. Edmund Solorgne, the scion of a wealthy house in , Southern France, of which country he wa's a native, had been sent to New Orleans, partly to acquire a knowledge  e of the world by foreign travel, and partly to look after the collection of certain claims there owing to the firm of which his father was the head. It was his misfortune, immediately upon his arrival, to be thrown into the soci- ety of Ruy Grandaville, and to pass almost without re- striction under his influence. For this there was partial apology in the fact that the young man had brought let- ters to Ruy from his father in France, who had for years been a business correspondent of the elder Grandavilles, and held an exalted opinion of the honor and integrity of the family, earnestly beseeching him to take an interest in his son. But, without such introduction, the characters of ihe two men were such that, once having met, they would almost inevitably have attached themselves to each other with the same result. And yet two persons would rarely be encountered with seemingly so little'in common. - I There was not a single point in which they appeared to. ,i correspond. While one was resolute,-bold and exacting, ' , *: *fl !'    40      The Sisters of Orleans. the other was frivolous, timid, and the plaything of men' of stronger willswthan his ovn. Physically the same dis- similarity was apparent. Solorgne, in person, was the exact illustration of the inner man. His form was grace- fui, but effeminate; his features regular, but wanting in expression; and hAis weight scarcely up to the ordinary standard. His entire demeanor was such as to convey an impression of immaturity. It was by no means the first instance that individuals' as radically dissimilar have been strongly attached to each other; but here there was at least one bond of fel-  lowship. Both were fond of pleasure, and both inclined'  to seek it in such pursuits as furnished the largest measure of excitement. Solorgne was not long in arriving at the conclusion that Grandaville was an accomplished leader in those dissipations in which he, above all things, was ambitious to excel; the more so as he felt how formida- -bly his own lack of experience and courage stood in the way of success; and his admiration grew accordingly. Ere long he had become, not- only the ardent friend and the constant companion, but the servile imitator, almost wor- shipper, of his older and more capable associate. Grandaville, whatever may have been his real opinion of the unsophisticated, luckless youth, encouraged the com- 1    ^panionship. He was not long in discovering that it could be made a source of advantage to himself. Solorgne' commanded an abundant supply of money, and was ready to spend it freely in the indulgence of his foibles and tastes. Rarely did the friends meet to pass an hour to- gether without cards being proposed to lighten the time, terminating invariably in Grandaville being the richer and ,   Solorgne the poorer-a result which seemed to affordi, more satisfaction to the loser than to the gainer. When, as .ee sometimes did, Grandaville would protest against   Friend and  Victim.      4I1 taking his companion's money, as theywere friends play- ing merely for amusement, Solorgne would- resent such e disinterestedness with a warmth that speedily silenced all denial. At the next meeting he was certain to insist upon larger stakes, and would play with greater reckless- ness than was his wont. The'two men became almost inseparable. Not a day passed which did -not bring them together. Solorgne went as regularly to Grandaville's apartments as to his own. On the morning on which they are first seen by the reader, the young Frenchman, at an earlier hour than usual, had sought his friend to consult about the amuse- ments of the day. His disappointment may be imagined when informned by Grandaville that their separation for that day was unavoidable, as he was compelled to be ab- sent from the city. But when told that his friend's des- tination was the plantation of {vhich he had heard him so often speak, and to which Grandaville informed him he was called by urgent business, he took heart, and insisted that that circumstance need not work their separation, as nothing would afford him so much pleasure as the privil- ege of visiting the plantation referred to, in company with its master. His companionship, thus tendered, could not have been rejected without a degree of rudeness that must have been fatal to their friendship. Grandaville was compelled, in consequence, to extend the invitation to his friend to join him in his contemplated journey, which led to the acceptance and response to be found at the outset of the last chapter. But while I have been supplying these preliminaries, the men have passed quite out of our sight. Let us hasten to overtake them.   CHAPTER V. ON THE ROAD. TARTING in pursuit of the two friends, so fully introduced in previous chapters, we have several blocks to go, leading us quite out of the more fashionable streets, before we are able to overtake them. They have stopped, as we come up, before a large, low, barn-like structure, over the prin- cipal entrance of which is a-sign announcing an establish- ment where horses and -vehicles are to be had for hire. Leaving his companion on the sidewalk, Grandaville entered for the'two-fold purpose of ordering out his own  horse and selecting one for his friend; for the journey they were about -to undertake had to -be made in the saddle. A choice having been made to his satisfaction, i he returned to the stree.  A colored man soon appeared leading a graceful and , high-mettled animal, his eye flashing and his teeth champ- ing the bit. No sooner did he notice Grandaville than he set up a sharp, cheerful neigh of recognition, and be- ? gan to rear and plunge, swinging his attendant from side J to side with a degree of violence which threatened each , moment to prove too much for his control. Grandaville  stepped forward, and with a kindly word and a few gen- s tle strokes of the hand speedily quieted the restless brute, until he stood, although still tremulous with excitement,  in graceful, pleased submission-a picture of satisfied obedience. ,Soon another horse was led forth. The second animal   On the Road. 43 was of quite a different order. A heavy, lumbering - beast, with- a dull eye and an excess of flesh, he appeared much better suited for the shafts of the market-man's cart than for the saddle. Solorgne was no judge of a roadster, and so proceeded to place hims elf, without pro- test, upon the back of the clumsy brute, as Grandaville's steed was already pawing the ground in impatience to be off.  The road selected led the travellers into the depths of one' of those great swampy regions lying contiguous to the city of New Orleans. A more uninteresting country to the eye, and one more wearisome to the traveller, Could I hardly be conceived of. Solorgne soon found his experi- ence very different from the entertainment he had antic- ipated. Owing to the opposite qualities of the animals  they were riding, for the 'most of the time. he and his companion were  so far apart as to make conversation extremely difcult, if not impossible. The separation, he began to suspect, was not altogether unintentional Grandaville's part. He noticed that 'there was a cloud I upon his fellow-traveller's brow and an irritableness in his manner which he was wholly unable to account for; and that his friend was really desirous, for' some unknown and incomprehensible reason, of escaping his society, was the conclusion that gradually forced itself upon his mind. A feeling of vexation', not altogether unmixed with resent- ment, sprang up in his own bosom in consequence. It was the first unpleasant sensation that-had occurred't0 disturb the cordiality of the two men. But, meanwhile, Solorgne was encountering other tri-als that severely taxed his equanimity. The daywas warm, and the unaccustomed exercise of the saddle more and more wore upon his strength and spirits. H eartly did he wish himself back in the city, and nothing but his   "44      The Sisters of Orleans. pride prevented him from returning. The indignation which the seeming churlishness of Grandaville had ex-. cited, determined him to persevere at every hazard. He was not willing to do that which he believed would grat- ifylhis friend. His disposition had its full share of the  obstinacy of weak men. So, between petulance on the one hand, and a motive that events had not yet made clear on the other, the men, whose intercourse had always been most intimate before, rode forward in silence and apart, although with no great space between them, each busy with his own thoughts. The middle hour of the day had already passed when Grandaville,'who happened at the time to be some dis- tance mn advance, drew rein ifponj coming in sight of a clearing in the heavy forest through which they were passing, the principal feature of which was a cabin con- structed of unhewn logs. IA more forbidding spot could scarcely be imagined. 'The clearing had been. made by in- part deadening the great trees of native growth, which were left standing to decay and fall piece-meal, in their own time, to the earth. The low,rakish log' structure, 'which was the central fig- ure in the scene,'consisted of two originally independent cribs, which had been so connected together by the exten- sion of one roof over them as to leave an uninclosed cov- ' ered space between. In this shed were collected agricul- tural implements, harness, saddles, and seemingly all the utensils and trumpery belonging to the establishment. The ground, which had been partially improved, was a :sort of elevation in the midst of a swamp, evidences of which were to be seen all around. The swlmp fordst on -every side 'was a compact mass of foliage, almost black )  in its sombreness, except where long patches of grayish moss hung trailing from the branchdies of the trees. That   On te Road. human beings could be induced voluntarily,.to dwell in such a place, seemed a mystery past comprehension. "Is that your plantatin? ', asked Solorgne, as he ap- proached Grandaville, who was waitingfor him to come up. The tone in which the question was conveyed might indicate either surprise or a disposition to affront. ndi Ve stop here for the' present," was Grandaville's indifferent reply. The prospect of rest, even in such a place, was a relief to the sore and weary Frenchman, and he, therefore, gave no further sign of dissatisfaction.

"THre Sam! here Pete! come an' git the hosses.' Quick, yer lazy, sneakin', good-fur-nothin' niggers! Quick I say, or Ah! how is y'er anyhow, neighbor? Glad ter see yer, 'pon my soul! Come in an' take sumthin', won't yer?" As he finished the last sentence, the speaker, who had stridden across the space between the cabin door and the road; seized Grandaville cordially by yhe hand. "Thank you, Walker,"' replied Grandaville good-humor- edly. "We will be glad to take some dinner with you. This is my friend Solorgne." "Glad ter see yer, Mr. Cowshorn," exclaimed the man addressed as Walker, as he seized the Frenchman's hand and shook his arm as if it had been the handle to a pump. He then led the way to the cabin, turning at the door, however, to deliver a few more rough injunctions to the invisible Sam and Pete to expedite their attentions to the travellers' horses. "'Now, old gal,stir yerself, an' git sumthin' ter eat as quick as fire an' water'l do the bizness-an' yer, yer cus- sed,.yaller-skinned varmints, out of this, every one ov yer! 'Git, I say!"

Walker's commands were' obeyed with a promptitude ,.    On the Road. 47. that showed he enjoyed the respect, or what was proba- bly a substitute for it, the fear of his household. The woman went about the preparation of a meal ina matter- of-course way, without so much as opening her lips; and the children, driven from the cabin, filled the doorway 'with bushy, grinning heads, intent upon every movement of the strangers. "And now, gentlemen," resumed the host, after seeing the visitors seated upon three-legged stools of horne man- ufacture, "won't yer take sumthin' after yer ride Its mighty cooin' ov a hot day." With that, and without waiting for an answer, Walker produced from beneath a bed in the room an earthen jug, and having po  ured some of the contents into a tin-cup presented it to his guests--first to one and then the other, at the same time highly commending its cooling qualities, although the taste was almost that of aqua-fortis.  The visitors having, out of politeness, each taken the smallest possible sip of the fiery liquid, their entertainer emptied the cup at a draught, smacking h is lips, after the self-bestowed treat, with manifest satisfaction.  Dinner over, Walker and his guests retired to the shade of a  tree outside of the cabin, there to pass the Lime until the travellers' horses  would be sufficiently . -:ested for a resumption o the journey. The three mnen eated ' themselves upon stools, and the children stood watching them  intently at  a safe distance. Grandaville r  oduced a case of choice cigars, and passed them to his   . ompanions.  Walker took one, but at the same time rawing a   pipe of home manufacture from  his pocket, 'ushed the fragrant Havana - into- it. Then, -having owned the mass with a  living coal, which one of th e  ildren by his order brought from the cabin, h e pro-   I eded to smoke with great complacency.  *  T adi   48.      The Sisters of Orleans. As I shall have occasion, in the course of the succeed- ing narrative, more than once to visit the cabin of the man Walker, and as he was a fair representative of a con- siderable class of' persons living in the slave-holding States at the period of which I am writing, I have not only given the foregoing details, but shall avai(myself of the opportunity, while he is busy with hi; pipe, to ac- quaint the reader with certain' facts concerning him and his household. He had gone into the swamp to live, partly to escape social and. legal restraint, and partly because- he there found a home rent and tax free. In other words, he was a "squatter."     . Although intellectually and morally not superior to the average of poor white men of the South, from whose ranks he had sprung,. he -enjoyed, at the tine he is in- troduced to the acquaintance of the reader, one ad- vantage which, in his own estimation at least, lifted him quite above the mass of his fellows. He was a slave- holder. By some means he had acquired title to a colored woman of about his own'age, and the result had been a family of children who, inheriting the legal condition of the mother, had come into the world the absolute prop- erty of their father. Walker failed- not' to realize the im- portance that fact gave him. No father could be more proud of his family than he, for his offspring were, in the most literal sense, his treasures, being esti(Zted exactly according to their supposed market values. True, he had a sort of affection for his children; and so hffwould have had for horses and pigs. of his own raising. But that fact never caused him to forget the important point that he was the owner of slave property. Of course, under such circumstances, there could be no more staunch be-   On the Road. " liever in, or ardent champion of, the system which secured hiim such valualble privileges., Being a slave-holder, he looked upon himself as agen- tleman. But while, for that reason,'he did not scruple to meet the most refined with the freedom of assumed equality, he could not fail to notice that there was a wide,  although to' him incwmprehensible, difference between'  himself and men who had been born and reared as-gen- tlemen; and on that account he was as slavishy syco- phantic towards such persons as he was domineering to men of his real condition: Ruy Grandaville, being the  finest gentleman -he knew, was his highes conception of manhood; and ad he been born a negro, and 'led the life of a slave, he c ould not hav e been more ready to do his bidding.                 , t d "Buyin' niggers ?" The   question was directed, or, what seemed nearer it,  spit, at Solorgne. Walker, given up to the I uxury of his pipe, had for    I several minutes maintained an Unbroken silence; -but luring that time his eyes had rested upon the young ;renchran.

Not in the least disconcerted, Walker took the vacated stool and set it between himself and Grandaville. Then, taking a pack of greasy cards from some place about his person, he laid themn upon the stool with a challenge to play, which was good-naturedly accepted. Solorgne dimly saw the two    i men handling the cards, and the next moment was sound asleep.               - - ' When he awoke, he was surprised and startled to per- ceive from the lengthened shadows that he had slept for several hours. He was about to spring to his feet, with an apology upon his lips, when something in the conver- sation between Grandaville and Walker, who, -cards in  - hand, occupied the same position in which he had last seen them, arrested his attention and his intended move- ment at the same time. "You now understand why I have gone so much out of my way," said Grandaville. "Sartin I does, an' the nixt time---" Walker was prevented from finishing the sentence by a significant motion from Grandaville, who had discovered Solorgne's return to consciousness-a motion, however, which the latter noticed as well. Once upon his feet, Solorgne began to express his re- grets at the delay he had unintentionally occasioned; butI was told that, the evening being preferable for travelling, no inconvenience would result. Butnow, the sun being low in the west, Grandaville announced that they must be again upon, the move. Accordingly Sam and Pete were directed to bring the horses; the travellers were soon in the saddle; and, after being warmly pressed to partake  of that " sumthin " which Walker protested " wus fust rate   52   .   The Sisters of Orleans. to keep the blood warm ov a cool night," they- bade their host good-by. The balance of the journey was simply a repetition of the morning's experience. No attempt at sociability was made. The travellers pursued their way, generally with a considerable space between them, busy with their own reflections. Solorgne was indulging an unusually-for him-sober train of thought. The fragment of conversa- tion he had overheard between Grandaville and Walker led him to recall numerous minor incidents of the morn- ing, tending to show that his friend had, on that day, been totally unlike his former self. That there was something about the plantation they were on their way to visit which was the cause of the phenomenon, strongly impressed -itself upon his mind. What could be the mystery? He resolved, while concealing his own suspicions, and avoid- ing everything that would arouse his friend's, to possess himself, if possible; of the secret. Day had disappeared, and the second hour of the night had well nigh passed, when Solorgne became ,aware that his companion, who had been riding in advance, had stop- ped in the road and was waiting for him to come up. "The plantation;" said Grandaville, upon Solorgne's approach. The latter looked in the direction indicated, and, sure enough, at a short distance from the road the outlines of a large building were plainly distinguishable through the darkness. A halloo from the proprietor had the effect of- produc- ing a decided commotion. The dogs, began the alarm, but their clamor was speedily drowned by the shouts of an excited negro population that came rushing in a body towards the travellers, who found themselves surrounded by an indistinguishable collection of men, women, chil- dren and dogs, all exerting their vocal powers to the   Oin te Road.         53 utmost. Grandaville sternly commanded silence, and a few cuts of his riding-whip, judiciously administered, se- cured prompt obedience. A lantern being brought, dis- closed a circle of glistening eyes and teeth on the outer line of illumination, while the dusky-bodies to which they belonged wedre scarcely visible in the darkness. The spectacle, to one witnessing it for the first time, was  strangely weird and almost alarming. Solorgne could not suppress a shudder, and a presentiment of evil took  - possession of his mind, which he in vain struggled to expel. Mechanically he followed Grandaville towardsthe  /  Indoors, they were'guided through a long, gloomy hall by a tall, slatternly negress, carrying a lamp whose light was just sufficient to betray a sable countenance staring at them from almost every doorway they passed. A house inhabited by ghouls could irot have appeared more unin- viting. It was not until the master's apartment had been reached, and the door closed behind the travellers, that the effect upon the visitor's mind began to wear off.   CHAPTER VI. THE HDDEN BEAUTY. WONDERFUL change came over Grandaville as soon as he was under his own roof. At / once his former freedom of manner returned. ... He Seemed determined to make'up in affabil- ity for his churlishness of the day. He ordered supper; and, meanwhile, to take the edge from the fatigue they felt, as he expressed it, he directed wine to be brought which proved to be an article very different from the "sumthin" Walker had lauded so extravagantly. Again and again  he insisted upon filling the glass of his friend, nor was he i backward in repeatedly emptying his own. Between the    generous qualities of the wine and the fascination of  i Grandaville's society, the impressible Frenchman speedily forgot his suspicions of his companion and the other dis- agreeable incidents of the day. By the time supper was   finished, and never were travellers in condition better to enjoy it, the old cordiality was fully restored. Weariness ! was forgotten, and the trials of the journey were made ccasions for heartiest joke and laughter. :The wine, if the truth must be told, had already made such an impres- sion upon both of the friends that neither was'capable of the strictest discretion. "Plantation life may be veiy agreeable to some people,"' saidS Solorgne, as he balanced the glass he had just emp- tied'upon the palm of his hand, " but may the devil catch me, if he ever finds me so far from the city again, after I lhave once got safely back to it."   The Hiddezn Beaty. Bmw oc The laugh Grandaville indulged, in response to this ex-  l hibition of spleen, was a mixture of amusement and con- tempt, the latter not at all disguised. '  "For the soul of me," continued the impulsive French- man, now piqued to a still more decided expression of his opinion, "I can't understand what possible attraction. such a place as this can have for a man of taste and- breed- Ing. You may smile, but to me its perfectly horrible. The whole establishment appears to be filled with gor-  gons, ghouls and goblins, and I don't know how many other children of darkness. I've not seen a Christian countenance, save your own, since I have been in it:" "Which proves that you have not seen all it contains," rejoined Grandaville with enough heat to show that he 'esented the imputation cast upon his favorite property. "Thlen I should like to behold its redeeming feature, f such. it has, for no other purpose than to drive away he impression the black devils I have already seen have 'ft upon my mind.,           -  "So y9u shall," exclaimed Grandaville warmly. "Fol-  )w me, and you will be convinced.' " With these words the  host arose hastily, and taking a  mp   from the table at which they were sitting, led the  ay. Solorgne followed with curiosity thoroughly aroused. The proprietor of the mansion conducted his visitor  )m one long hall into another, both as gloomy as it was ssible for them to be, until a half-open door was reach- , through which a cheerful light was streaming. With- t stopping to knock, or giving other notice of his pur- se, Grandaville threw the door wide open andcl entered  apartment. Solorgne followed wifthout hesitation had scarcely set his foot across the threshold, when,  paused in utter amazement. The spectacle that met . eyes was the very last he had expected to see. He     ' S^^Zr^^S                 -h   56   '   The Sisters of Orleans. found himself surrounded with evidences of taste and elegance, which, in contrast with what he had witnessed elsewhere, appeared like the work of enchantment. The apartmentwas large and handsomely decorated; the furniture rich and varied, and arranged with a view to harmony of effect. A, lighted lamp, standing upon a small table in the centre of the room, and just sufficiently shaded -to give a softened tone to the scene, revealed quite enough to produce. a most agreeable impression. Some one of-refined and genial tastes, it was clear to Solorgne's ready perception, was occupant there. But what, after the first hurried survey, which took in the general adornment of the room, riveted his attention, was a female seated at the table upon which the lamp was resting. An'open book was in her hand, as if she had been interrupted in the act-of reading. Her face, :at the moment, was so far hidden by the shade of the lamp that the visitor could 'form no idea of it, but her hand, in which the book was held, rested in the full blaze of the light, and was so softly and transparently fair, as well as so perfectly moulded, that he had no hesitancy in coming to the conclusion that the owner was not only a white person, but that she was young and beautiful. That she was strikingly, if not becomingly, attired, he at. the same time perceived. His first impression was fully confirmed;lwhen the girl, or rather woman, as she really was, hastily arose. from her seat, and stood, with the light falling full upon her features, as if to ask the meaning of such unceremo- nious intrusion. A view of her form, at the same time, was thus unintentionally given. One more perfect it would be difficultto imagine. She was tall, and in the attitude of indignant, though silent, protest, in which she )' then appeared, absolutely queenly. Her apparel, while   Th  t Hidden Beauty.     57 not without certain negligences, and in accord with no   i strictly approved fashion, was such as harmonized with form and' features, heightening the effect of both. A l loosely-fitting robe, gathered about the waist with cord and tassel, had been left, on account of thed heat of the Weather, so far unfastened as to expose a snowy neck, and afford a glimpse of shoulders equally chaste. Her hair, which seemed remarkably luxuriant, had  been gathered to the top of her head, and there plaited and  arranged in resemblance of a crown, except a single tress which rippled loosely down upon her shoulders like a brooklet scattering in its fall. Her eyes were large and darkly luminous, and would have been too bright but for a shade of seriousness amounting almost to melan- choly. Her features were regular, giving evidence at once of sprightliness and energy of will. Her brow was like alabaster, its complexion transparent almost to pallor. A diamond ring--the only jewelry visible-appeared upon one 'ungloved hand, and: sparkled' sharply in the light. While her attitude, at that moment, doubtless exhibited greater stateliness than was habitual, her appearance, as she stood silent and almost defiant, was certainly sin- gularly impressive ; and at that time and in that place, to  the man who for the first time found himself in her pres-i ence, fairly startling. No vision could have been more unexpected and embarrassing.  While Solorgne did not at once take in all the p6ints  of the picture, he could not fail to realize their'full effect. His confusion was so great that, when Grandaville under-  took to give him a f6rmal introduction, he was powerless  ' to utter a word.  "Isabella, my friend Solorgne." Of the ease and grace of manner for which his coun- ase and grace            un.   58      The Sisters of Orleans. trymen are celebrated, Solorgne ordinarily possessed -a full- share, and never more so than when in female soci- ety; but now the fluent Frenchman was at a loss for the most simple compliment. He continued to gaze upon the unexpected vision without opening his lips. Seeing his complete bewilderment, Grandaville added in a louder tone, accompanied with a smile bordering upon la sneer:           . "You will admit now, my good fellow, I think, that you ; were too fast in d eouncing the attractions of my planta-  tion. Nothing but gorgons, ghouls and goblins, ha!" I The bantering words of his companion recalled So- lorgne to himself. He bowed awkwardly to the lady, and ' i replied with what was intended for a candid confession  of his error, What he said, he hardly knew. The manner of Isabella, as the lady had been called, A,  was not such as to reassure him. Her greeting was    most formal,'showing manifest displeasure at the way in which her privacy had been invaded. Resuming her    :seat, after a bare, ackroowledgment of the visitor's bow  and salutation, she remained rigid and silent, her open  book still in her hand, but without resting her eyes upon  it.' Solorgne felt that ordinary civility required him to X say something; but so confused was he by what had occurred, and so uncertain concerning the person to be addressed, that he was. totally unable to begin a con- versation. Grandaville, by a single word, might' have removed the difficulty, but he evidently enjoyed his friend's embarrassment, Consequently he said nothing. At last growing desperate, and resolved in some way to end the oppressive silence, Solorgne, instead of speak- ing-to the lady, turned to his friend: "You certainly are entitled to the credit of knowing how to keep a secret. When I sought to be your companion   The Iidden Beauty.    '         '9 to-day, J dreamt of no such surprise. This is, indeed, unexpected happiness."    ' .  The answer was' a sarcastic smile, which Solorgne's    I profession of happiness, Under the circumnstaices, might well have provoked. The words he had spoken, however, were productive of a result he did not anticipate. She, I who had been called Isabella, gave him a quick, search- ing glance, as if still suspicious, notwithstanding his pro- fession of previous ignorance of her existence, that his, visit had some reference to herself. The result of her scrutiny was evidently in favor-of his sincerity, as her features relaxed their expression of offended pride, and a  look different from any they had worn-pleasant and kindly-took its place. It said, as plainly as words could have expressed it, that all antagonism between the stran- ,er and herself was at an end. It is not probable that he  fully caught its meaning; but in some way Solorgne be- :ame conscious ofthe change. ,Before she opened her lips, -  le felt that a barrier had been removed from between- them. The newly-awakened friefdship oN' her'part was not to ,e, merely of a passive kind. With the ready tact in suchB latters for which women are justly so much more cele- rated than men, by asking an unimportant question or Mo concerning the day's journey, she- uicl put her isitor at his ease. From that point, conversation flowed adily and naturally enough. It did not take Solorgne long to discover that he had et a person of no liriited intelligence. He was particu!- rly struck with the information she possessed concern-  g his own country. Incidentally mentioning his native   - y, he was surprised to hear her refer to points of local . :erest it contained, with which he supposed no one but 'esident to be familiar. Had she ever visited France? Never, except in imag-  ept in ih a  fg ,'   60 oTe Sisters of Orleans. ination. How then had she come to learn so much about it? That was a matter easily explained. Books had been her companions.   - "France," said she "has been almost a passion with me. I have always delighted to read about it, and its merry, sunny people. I have dreamt about it too, and to my imagination it has seemed like fairy-land. If I were (endowed with wings, and could fly away to whatso- ever spot I thought the brightest, I would never rest nor weary until I had reached your delightful country." We can faintly imagine the effect of such words upon a stranger in a strange land. Even to the ear of one less excitable and less patriotic- than Frenchmen usually are, they could not have failed to bring the most agreeable emotions. Solorgne was more than gratified. He was charmed, and began to pour out a profusion- of thanks and compli- ments that contrasted oddly enough with the difficulty he had experienced in finding the most common-place civil- ities a few minutes before. With a'musical laugh, at which no one could take offence, Isabella interrupted the flow of his acknowledg- ments. "But what puzzles me," said she, " is that, if France be really what my imagination paints it, and what all enthu- siastic Frenchmen like yourself describe it, you could per- suade yourself to leave it for a sultry clime like ours, here to wander amid forests and swamps in quest of you know not what." "Ah, mademoiselle!" responded Solorgne, nobw driven back to his native gallantry for rejoinder, "when such attractions as the plantation of my friend, Grandaville affords are awaiting us, we can go anywhere, and would - cheerfully risk any peril."   The Hidden Beauty.       6I . "But what, puzzles me," he added in a half bantering tone, by way of retaliation, "is to find in this retired spot a flower fairer than any the city boasts, wasting its/fra- grance and beauty in the solitude -of the dull country." "Dull country!" replied Isabella warmly. "Don't call the country dull. I love the country.- We have na- ture* in the country. In the city you lead but artificial lives. Existence there is like the landscape on canvas. It may possess the colors, but where are the fragrance, the warmth; the soul? To me, the country, with its sun- shine, its music and its busy life, is never dull. The birds, that are the keenest pleasure-hunters alive, will nrot ' live in the city, except in cages. Here they stay unbid- den. I have an orchestra of the happiest songsters, and every song is a free-will offering. Every hour in the day brings a serenade from knights and squires of richest plume. I could live nowhere but in the country.' ' "But society--the lack of society!" hesitatingly pro- tested Solorgne, half silenced by'his companion's enthu- siasm. ' "Scciety!" rejoined Isabella as warmly as before. "You do not suppose we are without society here?"  "Doubtless not; but probably, until I met you, I had seen only the dark side of the picture." "I understand. You think there is no society in negroes. Again I must differ with you. I find the same society in negroes 'that I find in-children; and I would pity the man or woman that could grow lonesome in the midst of children. Their spirits are elastic. It is not intelligence that creates sociability. Of that we can have enough in the country. I have the brains and the wisdom of a hundred great mef and women shut up within my library here, and very dull companions I sometimes find them, too. I delight at times to fly from them, and: seek 4 r:S   62      The Sisters of Orleans. reanimation in the company of those very children of nature you think so unworthy. If their bodies are black, their hearts are always gentle and kind. If they were not so, how could the poor creatures sing songs that are so sweet and tender? O, I do so delight in their wild, sad min- strelsy!" Solorgne had already noticed a piano and other eviden- ces of a musical taste in the apartment, and now eagerly ?   took advantage of her last remark to ask Isabella to favor him with one of the songs she had applauded so highly. Without Apology or pretended hesitation, she suffered herself to be conducted to the piano, and, after lightly touching the keys, began one of those simple negro melo- dies which, coming from the heart, have never failed to reach the heart; for in true pathos, which is the soul of music, however inartistic they may be, they far surpass the greatest productions of the great masters. Her voice was rich and variable, and her command of the negro dialect perfect-; while the instrumental accompaniment, probably her own composition, was in full accord with the spirit of the song. Solorgne was enthusiastic -in his commen- dations at the conclusion of the first piece, and eagerly asked for another. So often was the same request re- peated and complied with, that he was at last, spite of the enjoyment he realized, forced by a sense of propriety to desist, with an equal profusion of thantks' and apologies. "' There is another kind of music of which I am almost as fond," said Isabella, as Solorgne stepped forward to lead her from the -instrument. Then, without appearing to notice his purpose, she ran her hands over the keys, apparently at random, until, as if by a sudden thought, she struck upon France's great revolutionary hymn--the Marseillaise. - - -               .   The Hidden b'eauty.         63 Solorgne was alike surprised and gratified as the notes of that boldest, maddest and most thrilling of airs rolled out from the richly-toned instrument; but his emotions were changed to astonishment ;when the voice of the singer burst forth in the clear, crisp words of the orig- inal song, in his own melodious French. Up to that mo- ment he had not suspected her of beirfg familiar with but     c the one language, all their conversation having been car- ried on in English, of which he was almost as thorough a master as of his own tongue. Without pausing, at the conclusion of the song, long enough to allow her excited auditor to give expression to his feelings, Isabella dashed into the rollicking air of Yankee Doodle, and went through its romping, giddy measure with quite as much enthusiasm as she had shown in any of the others. Solorgne did not know what to make of it. Utterly uncertain what eccentricity her inspi- ration or fancy might next suggest, he could only wait in awkward, but pleasurable, silence, ready to welcome whatever came.   Then, stopping for a short time, as if lost in earnest thought, clearly and firmly, but in a tone of sadness so plaintive that her heart seemed to be speak- ing rather than her lips, Isabella proceeded to sing, softly striking the-keys as she did so, the following words: ' Because my brow is clothed in smiles,.  Dream not my heart beneath is light:  What though the glamour still beguiles When joy has ta'en'its lasting flight. 'Tis like the light of fading day, That lingers when the sun is set: How lovely the delusive ray, So beautiful and lustrous yet! I've had my morning with the rest; Ah I never was there fairer dawn: Hope waked its music in my breast- 'I Then died as others' hopes have gone.   "        The Sisters of Orleans. I do hot sorrow nor complain; I shed no tear o'er raptures fled; I let the old, old smiles remain, Brght garlands for the early dead. . , How strange is life's resistless tide! Its changing currents come and go: AA pang is born, a joy has died- Ah I little can we see or know, When peacefully its waters sleep, The riot of the tempest o'er, What forms lie buried in the deep, What wrecks are cast upon the shore I Better, far better come not near; Look rather at my smiling brow: A sunny face'shall still appear, Whatever'pangs may lurk below. J ,        Better by far to leave my heart, My crushed and silent heart, alone: Nothing but pain could it impart, Were the unspoken story known. What could it mean?      Solorgne was like one dream- ing.  The music had ceased, but not a word was spoken. Isabella remained at the instrument, silent and abstracted, like a performer who had forgotten- the part she was to play.  Solorgne said nothing, did nothing.      He was still listening to the strains of the singer, which seemed to linger in  his ears like a cry of distress.   Could^the sor- row be real?   Was it a confession, or were the words he had heard simply the adoption of a'morbid fancy-of an eccentric musical- taste? He, did not know what to thin'k about it, and in his abstraction, regardless of the demands l of courtesy, with  his eyes fixed eagerly upon Isabella, remained like a statue. The silence was broken in an unexpected manner. There was another person in the room, whose very ex- istence at least one of the parties to the- scene I have been- describing, had    .entirely forgotten.  During  the greater part of the time that the incidents. just related   The Hiddenz Beauty.       65 were transpiring, Solorgne was utterly unconscious that there was such a being as Grandaville. Isabella was the only person he had seen. Grandaville, however, had-been far more observant. Not one word or movement of the others had escaped his notice. The effect of the wine, which had roused him to temporary gayety and badinage, and which, as we have seen, led to the meeting between Isabella and Solorgne, soon passed off, leaving him in the same sullen, silent mood he had manifested during the greater part of the day. In that condition he sat by and heard the conver- sation already detailed. But when, in the music scene, he witnessed the glances of unmistakable admiration his friend bestowed upon the beautiful singer, and the 'free- dom with which she elicited them, his eyes fairly glared, his lips were compressed until they became colorless, and he seemed scarcely able to control some powerful resent- ment. He held himself in check, however, until the song above given was finished, during the rendering of which he had by turns grown flushed and pale, when, springing to his feet, he gave a bell-cord that was near at hand a violent ptill. ".Send Caesar," he said to the female servant that im- mediately appeared in answer to his summons. "Caesar," exclaimed his master, as a colored man pre- sented himself, "conduct that gentleman to his room." ,His voice betrayed his agitation, especially when the word ! "gentleman " passed his lips. Then, as if conscious that ' he had gone too far in showing passion, he added, "I owe an apology for not thinking of the day's fatigue be-  fore now." "No apology is needed," replied Solorgne with aston- ishing lack of penetration. "The time has never passed so agreeably." Then, bowing a cheerful good-night, he ^         .  ..    .1-   " .     The Sisters of Orleans. followed the servant, utterly unaware of the scowl with which his departure was watched. Reaching his' room, he was about to disrobe for the night, when he observed that his conductor, a great, sul- ; len negro, remained stationary in the centre of the apart- ment, with his eyes fast riveted upon him. He motioned him to depart, and; not then stirring, ordered him sharply to " begone!" Caesar turned, and slowly stalked from the room. But a moment afterwards, casting his eyes in the direction of the door, Solorgne was surprised -to see it half open, and the imperturbable negro, standing like a statue just outside, still gazing stolidly at him. "Perhaps this will remove you," said Solorgne, half irritated and half amused, tossing a silver coin towards the grim sentinel. The statue picked up the coin, displayed a line of ivories, and disappeared behind the shut door. "What a strange place!" soliloquized  Solorgne. "What a strange place!" he repeated, as he laid himself down. So strange was it that he continued to pass in review, weary as he was, all that he had witnessed since entering it.         . A wonderfully beautiful image occupied the foreground in his thoughts. He had now discovered; he felt confi- dent,'the cause of Grandaville's strange behavior during the day, in the person of her who was called Isabella, and whom, for some unaccountable reason, he disliked others to see at his plantation. But who was this Isa- -bella? That was now the mlystery. , Intimate as' he had been withGrandaville, and often as 'he had heard him speak of his plantation, he had'never known him to allude to such a person, either as tenant or visitor. She was not his wife, because it was well understood that he was espoused to a lady of wealth and position -in the city, but whom Solorgne had never seen. That she should occupy ,             . ,   The Hidden  Beanty."      67 a more equivocal relation towards him, Solorgne- could not believe of one so accomplished, and holding the sen- timents she had expressed. No, no; nothing of that kind could be possible. Was she his sister? And what, whoever she might be, could attract or detain her there? Was there sorrow, as well as mystery, in the case? Here the words of the song he had heard her sing came back upon him, and he seemed to be listening once more to the mournful strain. As everything else grew more and more indistinct, louder, clearer, more earnest and plain- tive swelled the last sentence that had escaped her lips, again and again repeated i Nothing but pain could it impart, Were the unspoken story known. I '  -  '  '  '   . .    CHAPTER VII. GARDEN AND BOWER. HE morning was well advanced when Solorgne  awoke from the heavy sleep which the excite- ment and over-exertion of the previous day! had induced. He was doubtful, at the first return of consciousness, whether he was not under the influence of a frightfil dream, as the first object that met his gaze was the countenance of the negro Csesar, his great whitish eyes fixed immovably upon him. The head of the African alone was visible, that portion of the  body being projected: through an opening in the door-  way just wide enough to admit it, whiie the balance made ;g use of the door for a shield.          -i "What do-you want, you infernal scare-crow?" roared iL the Frenchman angrily.               I "Breckfust ready," slowly responded the apparition.  "Then clear out!"              -, The. head disappeared from its post of observation, and Solorgne, springing out of bed,.proceeded to clothe t himself as rapidly as possible. Outside the door he  found the patient Coesar waiting to conduct him to the morning meal.  'There, instead of finding Grandaville, as he had ex- J pected, he found a note from him, announcing that busi- ness had called the writer away for the day, and convey- ing the hope that his guest would be able to amuse him- self in examining the plantation. Solorgne, in view of his entertainer's conduct of the day before, was not disap-   Garden and Bower. I        69 pointed. In fact, in the frame of hind in which he then was, he was decidedly gratified. Here was an opportu- nity to prosecute, without the fear of observation, an in- quiry into a matter that then interested him more than anything else. Why not begin the investigation at once ? he asked himself. There was Caesar-why not make a witness of him ?  " Caesar," he began, " where's your master ?" "' Gone 'way." "Where's your mistress, then ?." The negro looked at his examiner steadily, as if he did not understand the question. "Don't you understand, blockhead? I mean Miss Isabella." The same imperturbable stare. " Is Miss Isabella not your mistress ? " The same result, " Do you know where Miss Isabella is ? " This time, after a long delay, the fixed expression of the eye was followed by an indecisive shake of the head. The first attempt was a failure. Breakfast over, the baffled inquirer sallied forth in the hope of finding more favorable' subjects upon which to prosecute his search for information. Being the first plantation he had visited, his interest was naturally enlisted in its examination. The mansion he discovered to be a large and rather imposing building, made up of two long wings combined in the form of the letter " L," the whole surrounded by a veranda or open stoop.  The building was two stories high, and crowned at the highest point of the roof with a considerable platform or observatory, unenclosed except by a balustrade. The structure had evidently, when :new,   Sisters of Orleans. been One of considerable architectural pretension, but been one of CO now plainly showed the mnarks of age and inadequate attention to repairs. ' About the house was a magnficent grove of native forest trees, large and thrifty, making a beautiful 'ark, and a delightfully-shaded lawn. The plantation itself was a valuable one. Its situation could hardly have been more attractive. F bac ground was a sparkling sheet of water-one of those lakes or bayous so frequent in that region, whose shell- covered beach furnished the plantation an exquisite bor- der for its mantle of dark green. The place had, however, seen better days. Every- where- evidences of waste and hastening dilapidation were observable. Thv is was the natural result of the man- agement to which it was sub)mitted. With its owner absent the greater portion of the tit--, enjoying the pleas- ires and dissipations of city life, it ,eas left chiefly to the charge of slaves.- Such care as they bestowed was totally inadequate. However faithful and devoted to their mas- ter's interests bondsmen might be, it was not in the nature 'of things that they should exercise the vigilance that a proprietor would.' Deriving no benefit from their indus- try in any event, beyond a mere bodily support, what inducement had they'to put forth any exertion which conflicted with their personal comfort and ease? The laborer is worthy of his hire, and if there be no sufficient wages, there will be no disproportionate effort. Deeply interested in all he saw, but at the same time disappointed in not meeting one who had now become the plantation's highest attraction in his eyes, the visitor wandered on, until his attention was called to an enclos ure, at no great distance from the mansion, which seemec to be a plot of ground specially set apart for the cultiva tion of fruits and flowers. Seeking a gate he entered   Garden and Bower.        71 and was surprised to find the evidences of a degree of taste and careful cultivation of which he had elsewhere seen no indication. Thelgarden, for it was nothing more, was not extensive; but the arrangement of walksLnad bowers, with a view to labyrinthine effect, was so skilful as to confuse the casual visitor, and create in his mind an impression of much greater extent than the fact justified. Everything was in the best possible order, neat arid care- fully trained. The productions of this favored spot were simply such fruits and flowers as were indigenous to the soil, but so rich in coloring and abundant in variety, that the place looked like the work of fairy hands, or of magic. Solorgne followed the windings of a path, delighted with what he saw; but, had proceeded but a little way, when he became aware that the garden had other occu- pants than himself. Turning the angle of a walk which, presented a view he had not before seen, he found himself close upon/ an 'individual engaged in training a vine upon the lattice of a bower. It was a female, singularly, if not fantastically, dressed in a loose skirt of gaudy colors, and, a turban consisting of a scarf or handkerchief ingeniously interlaced so as to form a light but graceful and striking cover for the head. There is no article of personal apparel which com- bines so much dignity and 'taste as the turban, and much of our pleasure in oriental painting is due to that feature in'dress. The female slaves upon Southern plantations, not exempt from the vanities of their-sex, and frequently displaying rare judgment in the use of the limited mate- rial they possessed for personal adornment, often out- stripped their free countrywomen of fairer complexion in picturesqueness of costume, when not too critically exain- ined--a result due in large measure to their almost uni- versal adoption of the turban. To a person of Solorgne's   72        The Sisters of Orleans. excitable temperament, who had seen but little of planta- tion life, such novelty of dress was .striking in ttie extreme; particularly when his imagination was ready to supply face and form of the most perfect type; for he was not mistaken in supposing that she whon) he beheld, although her back was towards him,. was Isabella. Her occupation was such as to display the attractions of a faultless form to the best possible advantage. At one moment she was standing on tip-toe, securing a vine at an elevated point of the trellis; and the next bending nearly to the earth. Her movements were quick and full: of grace, showing a degree of elasticity which nothing but considerable practice in such employments could have produced. Solorgne stood perfectly still, quite overcome by the sudden vision.  For several minutes he remained thus, as if spell-bound, an unsuspected witness of the girl's labors. But to play the spy, with all his weaknesses, was no part of his 'nature. He was about to retire unobserved, as he had come, when he was arrested by something which irresistibly fixed his 'attention. Isabella had begun to sing in'her work.  The words he heard were as follows: The walls of the castle were massive and high, So high, so high : The lady within them could nothing but sigh, But sigh, but sigh. Said she to the Sbuth wind that played with her hair, Her hair, her hair: O! could ye a message to Lionel bear? ' Could bear, could bear? The South wind went singing with joy on its way, Its way, its way: 'The lady, she sighed in the castle all day, All day, all day. She knew not, and dreamt not, that succor was near, Was near, was near: For the South wind had whispered in Lionel's ear, His ear, his ear.   Garden and Bower.           7 At this point, noticing that a vine had    become de- tached near the top of the trellis, the singer broke off in her song, until she had placed a garden-step in such po- sition as to-give her the necessary elevation to restore it :to its place.  Standing upon the step, as her fingers were busy refastening the vine; she took up the song where she had left off:  The walls of the castle were massive and high, So high, so high: .       ( But Love over rampart the strongest can fly,  Can fly, can fly. It laughs at defences of iron and stone, And stone, and stone: It enters strong gates by a way of its own, Its own, its own. ff(  -  .The lady heard sounds at her lattice that night, That night, that night: The morn found her far, far away in her flight, Her flight; her flight. -Oh! here, in this prison, I sigh to be free, Be free, be free: But who is there coming with succor for me?  ,  Forme, for me. The words were very simple' and, perhaps, meaningless; but there was something so plaintive in, the tone in which -they were sung, that Solorgne, at, the moment, believed them  to be :the expression of actual feeling.  He forgot everything except the   singer and -her appeal for deliver- ance. Before he was conscious of what he was doing, he had stepped forward and    exclaimed: "Lady! I know not what may be your distress, butyou shall find at-least one friend in me." The next  moment, he would not for worlds-that he had thus  spoken. Isabella, turning  quickly, gave him  one glance, and   then, springing lightly from the step, moved away without a   word. A  moment took her to the oppo- site side of the  arbor and  out of sight.  Nonplussed b y   74-     7Te Sisters of Orleans.  j he abrupt departure, and chagrined at his ow indiscre- tion, Solorgne knew not what to do; but finally resolved to follow and offer an apology. Before, however, he had reached that conclusion, she was nowhere to be seen. There were several paths leading from the spot, bounded by shrubbery higher than a person's head, and by one of these she had made her escape. As he Was looking to discover in what direction she had gone, his attention was suddenly arrested by some- thing gazing and grinning upon him, as if watching his movements, which he made out, after some little examin- ation, to-be a human countenance. Nothing could be seen but a face peering out of a clump of bushes, small, mischievous, and perfectly black. Whatever body be- longed to it, was hidden behind the branches and leaves. "Out of that, you rascal, this minute," exclaimed So- lorgne angrily. There was a movement among the twigs, and out from among them bounded a small black object, which rolled over and over, until it brought up some dis- tance from where Solorgne was standing. There, with body crouched down upon hands and feet, it looked searchingly at the intruder. Whether it belonged to the human or the monkey species, it was some time before Solorgne could tell, "Come here!" he said to it at last. The creature continued to look steadily at him without ,stirring.  - Remembering his financial experiment with Caesar, he concluded to try it again. Taking a silver coin out of his pocket, he held it up in his fingers. The black ob- ject appeared to be affected. At length, putting on a more than ordinarily comical grimace, it spoke:, ( Be'se you'se trader?" "A trader.! That's what you're afraid of, is it?" And *I-    I!        Gardeli and Bower.    Solorgne broke into a hearty laugh. "No  I'm no \  i trader," he said. "I wouldn't take such a looking thing as you are in a present, much less buy you." Thus assured, the negro boy, for that was what the creature was, slowly arose to his'feet, and approached timidly, and with a look of suspicion, until able-tr- reach, the coin in the extended hand. "Having received it, he bounded quickly back, until again at a safe distance. "What's your name?" asked Solorgne. "Frog." "Frog! What makes them call you that?" The boy gave a leap into the air, and before again becoming stationary, had executed a half-dozen sum- nersaults with surprising agility. Then, looking up in Solorgne's face, his own wore an expression of triumph exceedingly grotesque. iI see, I see. Who is your father?"  "Dragon." With this the boy pointed towards a, gray-haired negro who was watering some plants not far off. "Frog, the son of Dragon!" exclaimed Solorgne, laughing heartily.  'What a-queer place! But tellme, Frog, who was that lady that was here a minute ago m, "Does you'se mean Missus Bella?" Yes! yes! that's the very person I  mean.. Who is "Missus Bella." "  You rascal! But who is Missus Bella?" A look, half of cunning, and half of suspicion, followed by a  sunimersault, was the only reply. "Where did she come from?"  Another summersault. "How long has she lived here? Speak, I tell you." It was of no use. The boy could do nothing but play   76      The Sisters of Orleans. frog, taking care to keep beyond his questioner's reach. Even another silver coin was displayed in vain. The white eyes sparkled with longing glances, and his mouth fairly watered with eager covetousness, but the lips ab- solutely refed to open. "'PshawJI'll try the old one," exclaimed S-olorgne angrily, leaving the son in the act of balancing himself on head and hands, and approaching the ancient Dragon. "Good morning, old gentleman!" he began. The negro went on deliberately with- his work. Another "good morning," in a louder key, had no more effect; when the Frenchman, losing all remaining patience, sharply applied a twig he held in his hand to the old man's shoulder. That reminder had the desired effect.- The aged negro looked up, and no sooner did he see the stranger, than he snatched off a remnant of a hat from his head, and began a series of elaborate bows. "Did you see a lady in the garden a short time ago?" inquired Solorgne. ' Dat der melia," (meaning camellia) 'responded the old man, his attention on a shrub he had just been watering. " 'Ums berry tender when 'ums fust moved; needs lots ob der water." "No! no! no!" shouted Solorgne in a still louder voice. "The lady, I mean-not the shrub; the white lady in long dress and with red scarf upon her head." "Yas! yas! I knows 'umrn," replied the negro with the utmost gravity. "Dat der zalea " (meaning the azalea). "Der flowers am white an' red, an' you'se wuthless, good-fur-nuffin' nigger, what der mischief is you'se doin' dar?" The conclusion of the sentence was addressed to the old man's hopeful progeny, Frog, who, in some of his gymnastic exercises, had tumbled headforemost into a   Garden and  ower.       " bed of rare and beautiful flowers, where he was then roll- ing about in a vigorous effort to extricate himself. And with that, the irate old African, leaving his questioner to inform himself as best he could, rushed, scolding and sputtering, to drag his son from among his favorite plants. "Stranger and Sgranger," soliloquized Solorgne, as he walked slowly away. "Everybody is either deaf, dumb or crazy. What an extraordinary place! What would I not give to be at the bottom oftall this mystery!" But with all his anxiety, no satisfaction did he obtain. Of Isabella he saw no more that day, although several times he revisited the garden in the hope of meeting her. The slaves he found communicative enough, .until the subject which was uppermost in 1his mind was approached, when invariably they grew taciturn, or seemed incapa- ble of understanding the simplest question. The close of the day found him no wiser than he had been in the morning. With evening Grandaville returned. He was in'excel- lent spirits. Wine was ordered in, and when supper was over, cards were produced. Solorgne longed for a differ- ent disposition of the evening; but so uncertain was he of everything about that singular place that he dared not give expression to his wishes. Grandaville seemed to think only of the game they-were playing, in which so little interest was taken' by his guest that, when the hour of midnight had come, the former's winnings fully can- celled certain obligations he was owing the latter on account of loans with which from time to time he had   ' been accommodated. "We start early for the city," said Grandaville, as he observed that midnight had come. "I would cheerfully give you the opportunity of reversing the order of our luck to-night, but we will both need rest for our journey."   78      The Sisters of Orleans. With that he summoned Caesar, and put Solorgne in his "charge. At an early hour Solorgne found Caesar waiting 'to attend him. -Breakfast was quietly dispatched, Granda- ville seeming taciturn, even to moroseness. "Now to horse!" said he, as they rose from the table. At the door the gentlemen found their horses in wait- ing. They mounted without a word. The question So- lorgne was burning to ask, he was utterly prevented from breathing by his companion's manner. Already were they in their saddles, when his heart gave a leap. A door of the mansion opened, and out swept Isabella, becomingly attired in a loose morning wrapper, and moved directly to the point where the riders were in waiting. In that light and comfortable costume, with the sun's early rays revealing her clear, fresh complexion, she appeared even more beautiful to Solorgne than she had in her own apartment. Lifting his hat he began an elaborate and somewhat confused compliment on her appearance. Without seeming to notice his words, she proceeded, with a winning smile, and in appropriate language, to express the pleasure his visit had afforded her, and the hope that, when convenience permitted, it would be repeated, concluding with her best wishes for a safe and pleasant journey. Grandaville had marked her appearance with a scowl amounting almost to fierceness. Waiting to permit no further conversation, he struck spur and dashed forward. Solorgne was compelled to follow, Isabella slowly walked back to the house, where, taking, her stand in the doorway, she watched the receding forms of the travellers. Long after they had passed out. of sight, she remained standing there with her hand sha- ding her eyes, and an expression upon her countenance, oh! so sad and wistful.   CHAPTER V"I. POOR MOTH. ;.DMUN:D SOLORGNE had not paid his last ('g -) visit to Ruy Grandaville's plantation. A few ft 3?  days saw him there again, and, from that time c'.   forward, rarely did forty-eight ho urs pass with- out bringing him to that out-of-the-way place. But no more journeys did he make in company with the planta- tion's owner. Henceforward he rode alone, and the direction he 'took was not even communicated to his for- mer friend and companion. In fact a coldness, dating from the events already detailed, sprang up between them, which operated more and more to hold them apart. There had been no quarrel, and when they met, a revival of something of their former cordiality would take place; but there was no longer that attraction which had daily drawn them together. The intervals between their meet- ings grew longer and longer. As a result of the separation, Solorgne was enabled to dispobse of the greater portion of his time without the knowledge of his friend'as he still considered him, although that consideration did not restrain him firom using his opportunity to ride often in the direction of his friend's plantation. He had discovered that the. route taken on the occasion of his first visit was far from being the shortest and most agreeable. He found that, with increased practice in horsemanship, and the selection of a more spirited roadster, the journey'was nothing more than a pleasant ride. He. now bestowed a great deal of   80      The Sisters of Orleans. attention on out-door exercises, persuading himself that his health was in danger of suffering from confinement. For that reason he discovered a necessity for frequent airings. The atmosphere in the direction of Grandaville's plantation seemed by all odds the most, bracing. While he would not have thought of such a thing as visiting his friend's, establishment without that friend's knowledge and concurrence, he could see nothing wrong in calling there, merely to rest himself, when taking his accustomed exercise. With such- casuistry did he justify his conduct in his own eyes, without stopping to inquire too closely what his real motive was-an inquiry which would speed- ily have shown the fallacy of his reasoning. To Isabella he presented himself in the same light in which he sought to appear in his own eyes-merely as one whose calls were incidental rather than designed. In fact, with the limited knowledge he possessed of the lady, and their brief acquaintance, he could not well have ob- truded his society on any other ground. In the charac- ter he assumed, he was received by Isabella with the courtesy due to a friend of the mansion's proprietor, and his stay made as agreeable as the most considerate po- liteness on her part could make it, and no further. Her conversation was always intelligent and-cheerful-some- times sprightly and ,amusing, her manner frank and cor- dial, and her enjoyment of his society undisguised ; yet, when the limit of a friendly call had been reached, and he reluctantly arose to withdraw, she never insisted upon delay nor urged his return. Neither did he make any progress in unraveling the mystery which surrounded her presence in that singular place. He longed to Ok her about herself, but so closely did her unexceptionable reserve keep him to the boundary of a guarded civility, that he could find no opportunity for turning the conver-   - 0or ith.         8I sation upon personal matters. On each occasion he went out from her presence more dissatisfied than ever with the relation he sustained to that beautiful and fascinating woman, and more impressed with her superior -attrac- tions; and, as a consequence, more fatally drawn towards her. Eabh time was he firmly resolved, as he went away, that the next meeting should reveal something that would be decisive of their intercourse. Poor moth! he was cir- cling round a flame from whose deadly influence he was hourly growing less able to break away. Had he stopped to calmly analyse his feelings, he could not but have dis- covered from his increasing restlessness, when absent, from Isabella's society, how imminent was the danger he was risking. But when did person, intoxicated with any powerful stimulant, pause to seriously calculate 'the prop- erties and effects of the overmastering draught? But an incident, purely accidental and seemingly dis- astrous, was approaching which promised to end the un- certainty and suspense. As Solorgne, after one of his indecisive and unsatisfying interviews, was about to leave the plantation in worse temper with himself than ever before, he found the horise he was riding, a high-mettled steed, disposed to be uncommonly restless. He had mounted to the saddle, and was paying his parting re- spects to Isabella, who was standing upon the veranda of the mansion, when the animal attempted to start. Drawing him back with an angry pull, Solorgne petu- lantly administered a sharp cut with his riding-whip. The result was that the spirited beast, stung with the blow, and not permitted to proceed, rearing upon his haunches, threw himself backward upon his incautious rider. The horse quickly sprang up, but Solorgne re- mained upon the ground motionless and senseless. With a piercing cry Isabella rushed towards the fallen   82      1Y/The Sisters of Orleans. '  man, and bent distractedly over his unconscious form. It might have been womanly sympathy alone which led her to throw her arms about him, and press an eager kiss upon his lips.. Certainly she had never exhibited any- thing but a friendly regard for him before, and then only under a most cautious reserve. Equally certain is it that a by the time the negroes had reached the spot, a goodly .. number of whom displayed astonishing alacrity in dis-  covering what had occurred, and came flocking pell-mell about, she had entirely recovered her usual composure, and sternly commanded silence in the excited throng. Directing the more able-bodied among the slaves to take - : the wounded man carefully in their arms, she quietly led ! the way into the house. There she exhibited equal calm- i ness and authority. By her direction he was placed upon :: 4 a comfortable couch ; the windows were raised to secure -a freer circulation of air; and a restorative, for the prep- aration of which she gave instruction, was administered : by her own hand. In a short time animation came back,  X and Solorgne, totally unconscious of what had befallen him, or where he was, began to talk inhis delirium,   j passionately calling on Isabella to save him from some  X fancied danger, accompanied with unmistakab-e terms of endearment. At onge ordering the throng of servants to retire, she remained, with a chosen assistant, by his side, administering soothing draughts and such other remedies as her judgment suggested, untif consciousness was fully restored, and he had obtained a fair measurWe  of relief. - From that time she was his physician, as well as his principal nurse. He rapidly recovered; at the same time secretly rejoicing in the calamity which had made him a physical sufferer. He now thought he saw his way to relief from mental pain greater than his bodily afflic-   Poor Moth.         83  tion. He resolved that the opportunity of putting his mind to rest should not be lost. But the difficulty, as he soon discovered, of reaching the point he had n- view, when a sagacious woman was to be dealt with, was greater than he had supposed. Although Isabella was much with him, he found it quite impossible to have communication except as she chose. Being the stronger power, her will predominated. Whenever he attempted  to turn the current of conversation into a channel leading to the subject uppermost in his thoughts,' she would adroitly' give -it another direction, or, as- his nurse, on the ground of necessity for quiet, order- an end to their talking, always pleasantly, and sometimes laughingly, but with a gentle authority which could not be, dis- Dbeyed. Instead of the mystery of her position being cleared ip, it was deepening under his very eyes. First one :hing transpired, and then an-other, calculated to make natters more and more incomprehensible. One day, having fallen into a protracted sleep, he was Iwakened in the midst of a dream, in which he fancied, limself walking through a grove of magnolias whose )ranches were brilliant with richly-colored-birds, all hav- ng human voices, and all employed in pouring forth the ;trangest, sweetest music, to find his room filled with a - ow, sad melody. Raising his head quietly from the pil- ow, and looking in the direction from which the sounds )roceeded, he discovered Isabella seated in an easy chair,  i ;lowly rocking backward and forward, and singing to lerself in apparent forgetfulness of any other presence. -ier face wore an expression of quiet, helpless melan-   {a :holy, totally unlike the sprightly, resolute look ordin- -U trily seen upon it. She was singing a plaintive negro'!! ;ong, one of those common, but mournfully tender, strains *. -:!   84      Tyhe Sist'a- of O'lealns. with which the over-taxed plantation laborer was accus- tomed to beguile the time, the burden of which was: "De perfec' peace ob dat long, long rest, In de ground where de dead am sleepin'." i Why was it, the listener asked himself, that while Isa- bella's conversation was always cheerful and strengthen- ing, her singing invariably had a mournful tinge? Was it because of her isolation from Congenial 'society, giving a sombre turn to her meditations, or  He did not know what to think about it. At this point, glancing suddenly towards the bed, as if iust recalling the sick manll's presence, Isabella's eyes met those of Solorgne. Iristantly-the expression of her coun- tenance- changed. The mournful, dreamy look it had been wearing passed away, and the singer broke into a cheerful laugh. "So you have been playing eaves-dropper, have you? But I fear I have disturbed your rest. I entirely forgot." "I fear I have interrupted your singing. Do not stop on my account. I was interested." "O! it was nothing but a simple air I had picked up among the negroes; the words partly'theirs, partly mine." "And do negroes and slaves have songs like that? I :thought they were ignorant and barbarous--little better than wild savages, in .fact; totally devoid of education and sentiment." "So are the birds without what we call education; and' yet they sing songs which, if we were able to translate. them, I doubt not, would be found to contain more true sentiment than all the fashionable music extant. As for the negroes, poor, patient wretches, I can understand why they sing. Music to them is as necessary as air. It is their outlet for feelings for which they can have no other expression. Trampled upon and' crushed as theby /      .   Poor fMoth.         85 are, if they did not find relief in songs which no master s authority can prevent or control, their natures would harden under a sense of their wrongs, and life become intolerable. It is their poetic temperament which ena- bles them to exist as slaves, and derive a fair share of life's happiness; not their want of sentiment. If they did not sing they would rebel or die. Music is the safety- valve of their natures." "I confess you give me a new idea of the negro's char- acter. I had supposed it was lack of sensibility that made him so patient as a slave-the absence of the finer feelings leaving him susceptible alone in the way the ox is. But do you, indeed, believe that he possesses the nature that would mall him resent a wrong as a wrong, and choose the right because it is the right?" "Your question, implies whether I believe the negro to be possessed of a soul; for, without the attributes you speak of, there would be little to separate him from the beasts of the field, with which, unfortunately, his position too closely associates him. I know it-may appear para- doxical to speak of courage and manly virtue in connec- tion with the life of a slave, who submits to insult and violence without protest or resentment; but we can all understand how a musical instrument may, be capable of sharp and thrilling notes, when none but the-lower and coarser tones are elicited, depending entirely upon the keys that are struck. The negro's soul is an instru- ment from which the hands that have been laid upon it have been employed in .calling out only the harsher and sadder utterances. Do not suppose because the life-long slave uncomplainingly wears his chains, and finds partial compensation for his sufferings in a fund of self-awakened pleasure, for which heaven has supplied the means, that he is insensible to the wrongs of which he is made the He                        86      The Sisters of Orleans. victim, and that he will not some day assert the stronger farces of his nature in avenging them. I can plainly foresee the time when, the measure of his afflictions being full, he will turn upon his oppressor and demand the res- titution of every right of which he is robbed, and, if unre- strained by a hand stronger, and a sense of justice higher, than his master's, will strike to regain it. I can myself feel   But what am Hdoing? I forgot I was talking to a sick man. I trust you have sustained no harm. There, no reply-not another word. As your nurse, I'command silence and rest."  The countenance of the speaker, while such sentiments were being avowed, wore an expression stern, positive, almost malignant; and her eye, ordinarily so calm and mild, glowed with a light as intense as it was unusual. As she spoke she arose from her seat*and stood as if defying contradiction. A moment afterwards, and all trace of her agitation was gone e Solorgne was more than ever mystified. The enigma was more impenetrable now than before. He could not comprehend why Isabella should so warmly espouse the cause of a people so generally despised, and whom he had seen obey her commands as if she neither exercised awlimited authority over them, nor scrupled to use it. But while the circumstance excited his wonder, it in no sense diminished the infatuation that had come over him. On the contrary; it added another element to his passion ,--an enthusiastic admiration for the higher nature with which Isabella seemed: to be endowed. A comparative stranger in the country, he had no prejudice on the sub- : ject of holding slaves which her views had shocked. In fact his-secret sympathies agreed with hers, and here, he -fet, was another bond between them. The more he re-. flected upon the scene we have described, the more was   Poor Moth.         87: Solorgne persuaded of Isabella's superiority, and the more resolute did he become in his purpose of securing the prize of her love, if he could. He was resolved that the next favorable opportunity should not pass without putting an end to his suspense. That opportunity, however, was slow to-come. From that moment Isabella seemed studiously to avoid all con- fidential communication. Servants were sent to supply. his wants: .her own visits were simply for inquiry, and at times when protracted conversation was impossible. Solorgne had so far recovered' from the effects of the accident that, but for the) one unsatisfied desire that bound -him to the plantation, he would gladly have re- turned to the city. While,- in no cheerful frame of mind, discussing the problem which now wholly engrossed his thoughts, he wasone day surprised by the entrance' of Isabella. Her countenance gave indication of unusual agitation.       ' "Are you willing," she began without ceremony, "that Ruy Grandaville should meet you here?" "Grandaville is my friend, and I know of no reason why he should not rejoice at the kindness I have met with under his roof." "It would be safe, neither for you nor for me, that he should know that you' had been a visitor at this house without his knowledge; much less that you had been an inmate for days," proceeded Isabella, almost without seeming to notice what Solorgne had said. "He will be here in less than an hour. Fortunately you are now so far recovered that 'you can leave without peril to your health. I have secured an easy carriage to convey you to the city. There is yet time for you to avoid meeting  your friend, and, as for the servants, ,a word from me will seal their lips.".. )'                ; -  '-. ." .

You cannot be ignorant of what attraction brought me here. Who are you? What mysterious power is it that keeps .you here? Oh! if you but saw my heart, you would believe that it is no idle curiosity that makes me ask. Shall I not have an answer?" "Yes; sometime, perhaps; "-for Isabella saw that So- lorgne meant all he said-" not now; not now. But you hads'better strive to forget me, for there is danger-- danger that you do not suspect, in this intimacy. There! no :more at present. I must, indeed, beg of you not to press this matter now. For my sake, if not for your own, think only of leaving this place at once. There is not a mobment to be lost." -: An appeal like that, Solorgne could not disregard, in- -tense as his feelings were. He made no immediate re- -sponse, and almost before he was aware of it, Isabella had left the room. He saw nothing more of her until, he was assisted to the carriage, by thie side of which she was standing. Surrounded by servants, there was no oppor- "-tunity there for satisfactory conversation, even had Isa- iRbella permitted.

I THE SWAMP-SQUATTER'S HOME. e G] HE condition of things I am dealing with, while familiar enough to the majority of persons  now living, will appear strange, almost incom- - prehensible, to those of the next generation. AMen in their prime at the conclusion of the present cen- - tury, will find it very hard to realise that, during more than one half of it, there existed within the United States - of America an institution, protected and encouraged by . law, which recognized, at one time, more than four mil-  lions of human beings as property-merchandise, and '.   - absolutely made them such.

It would be difficult to tell which, the colored slaves or those whites who were distinguished by the. not inappro- priate designation of "poor 'white trash," in the slave- hplding States, were most to be commiserated.- The chief difference seemed to be that the former wore their chains compulsorily and with stolid submission, while the latter wore, theirs; voluntarily, but, with constant grum- bling at the hardness of their fate. As long as slavery 'predominated both were doomed to dependence. The spheres of each were rigidly circumscribed.. Negroes might secure their freedom -by purchase or flight, and poor white. men might escape serfdom through enterprise and energy'; bu:t the instances of actual deliverance were about as ( numerous in the one case as the other. The third class,  -theslave-holders, ruled and used, or rather misused, both ' ;of-ihem. To both of the dependent classes the revolution brought- emancipation.

The man Walker, heretofore introduced :to the reader,'   ,     - **The Swamp-Squatter's Home.    9 I was a fair representative of the " poor white trash " of the; South, illiterate, debased, and full of prejudice. Through a piece of exceptional fortune he had been raised to the  ruling class, .but without Any corresponding elevation in  character. Becoming a slave-holder, he had become, in'  his own eyes, a gentleman, entitled -equ fied, as, he honestly supposed, to put on the ai Sand authority of a gentleman. But as his power of imitation was limited by  - his knowledge, which extended only to the vices of his' superiors-their idleness, their swagger, their insolence  and their cruelty, as may be inferred, his improved 'cir-. cumstances led to no improvement in manners or morals. ,  As has already been explained, his estate consisted of his family-his children and his children's mother. That  ::circumstance, however, neOver caused him to forget that  they were ,property, and that he was their owner. En- dowed with no very liberal share of natural affection at the best, he was not inclined to waste what he possessed of that virtue upon "niggers." In this he was merely  exremplifying the philosophy of a system which taught   - that it was not wise to bestow too much kindness upon  slaves, as it tefided to disqualify them for their position and duties. Heaven knows that in this way they were not often corrupted.                - . Nevertheless, -the peculiar, although not altogether  exceptional, relations existing between Walker ahd the  other members of his household, had ,some influence'  upon their intercourse. His children did not call him"  - : ' father,"7because he was their master; they did not- alf him "master," because he was their father. The diffi- .  culty was compromised by the use of the, term i boss,'  which was supposed to express- effectually the happy,    , blending of the two relations.

The. oldest girl in the family was a delicate, but grace- ful, yellow girl, nearly grown to womanhood, who, out of - compliment to the State of her nativity, had received the name of Louisiana. But as the name, in its integrity, was entirely too. long for any slave to bear, it had-been reduced to the -rather pretty abbreviation of Lou. The day following the visit of Grandaville and Solorgne to, the swamp-squatter's home, found Lou and her mother sitting alone in the principal room of the cabin-the .one :answering for kitchen,. dining-room, parlor and sleeping apartment for the heads of the household. A coarse piece of cloth was lying upon the knee of the elder ,woman, who was patiently, but unsuccessfully, with her : -fai!ng eyesight, endeavoring to introduce a thread into - 'a-needle.  / - .Hand 'um here, mamma, an' jes see how quick I'se will do dat fur yer," spoke up the daughter. - ":Bless you, chile! how could I'se eber git 'long with- out yout?" responded the mpther, as the girl held up the - needle and thread with the proper connection established - :between them. :. ," :" -Now de cloth, mamma! -You'se knows how cross de -boss will be, if dat jacket's not done 'gin de time he -: -comes back. i'se ken -do it quicker -dan you'se ken. iTain t nuffin so wonderful, when de pieces all cut so nice, - ter .stitch-dem togeder-; jes runnin' de needle through ::;. :anthrough.

Purty soon I'se ken do all der work, an' you'se will hab nuffin ter do, but rest an' git well."  And here the girl proceeded to enforce her appeal with an application of arms and lips which seemed to produce a most consolatory effect.                , But in the very midst of this affectionate passage, the sound of footsteps was heard. Barely had the women    - disengaged their arms from about each other, and fixed their attention upon their work, when. the 'master and - father came stamping into the house. Without a word of salutation, Walker seated himself upon a stool, threw his hat upon the bed across the room, -: and settled his eyes, with a grim, impatient stare, upon  the busy women.  - "That jacket not done yit?" he began. "Well now, you'd better hurry up, I tell yer." . .. There was no reply.  "Git me my pipe, some ov yer!" he next exclaimed   ' : with a heavy growl.  Lou got up and took the article referred to from the'  mantel over the fire-place.          . "Does yer want it filled and lit, Boss?" she timidly asked.'                    '  Y' Yes, ter be sure.!"        -  : -  Then taking the pipe, prepared as he waiited,- witith-  out a word or look of thankfulness, from the girl's fingers, Walker put it to his lips; but' his' eyes followed-ehis daughter as'she returned to a sealt by her-mother's side.: He smoked on for some-time in silence, but the direction  of his look did not change.  /111/i:.ili   -:: ::94   =,h Sister of Orleans.- or IC'^ ,Bold's that gal?" he at last abruptly inquire: of the mother.

There could be no question, i of his sincerity.' Then, bowing her head, she covered her --' face with her hands. It was but for a moment. Remov- ing her hands, and brushing away a tear, as with indigna- ' -3 tion at her weakness, she looked steadily before -her and spoke:   - -                       i . i! "You must hear my story.

These words were hissed rather than spolen, while, if to disprove her assertion, her cheeks arid brow h; grown pale almost to ghastliness. It seemed as if eve particle of blood had left them. Recalling all her streng with an effort, after a brief delay, she went on: "What I received from my mother I am compelled give to others. It seems as if the curse will never en I became a mother.

Better, far better, that she should be wi the angels, than stay here to take my place.' I cou not find it in my heart to give her nourishment to prblol a life of bondage. Nature's claims were denied.

Oh! it seemed as if my heart must relent- or break; that I should be compelled to give her the means of life. 'Heaven helping me, I did resist, rejoicing when shewas dead. She was free. Therp  one door through which we can all escape to liberty-the grave. I buried her here in this garden, and it is my sweetest task to train the flowers that grow and bloom above her." The speaker's emotion was at last too strong for her. She hid her face, and her whole frame shook with the  internal conflict. The tempest was long and violent. Minute after minute passed, and she still bent beneath it. At last, summoning flish resolution, she raised her eyes, and, turning calmly to Solorgne, who sat- like one stupe- fied, she said: "You now know who and what I am. A slave, a mem- ber of that Helot race whose name is a by-word; the slightest trace of whose blood is a badge of endless shame; a social outcast, and the victim of a master's wantonness-you can despise, hate, spurn me, as all the others would!" "Never! by the God that sees us, never!" exclaimed Solorgne impetuously. "I admire, love, adore you more than ever. Heaven forbid that your misfortune should change my heart.' I do not see you as a slave, as the off- spring of negro parentage. In my eyes you are a beauti- ful, noble woman, made to love and be loved. Born and reared under other laws and influences, I have never learned that dreadful prejudice of race against race you describe. -I care nothing for that traditional lineage which here makes you an outcast. No! no! I have pledged my word that I would be your friend, your more than friend, and here I declare that, if you will consent, I i     1o04     The Sisters of Orleans. - will not only set'you free, but will- give you the protection , of my name, my wealth and my social position. You shall be my wife!" -, This is folly," calmly responded Isabella. "How- :;ever sincere your purpose, and heaven': forbid that I should' doubt you for an instant! the law stands irrevoca- bly'in- our way. You forget that I am a slave-Granda- ville's property. His claim--that of a master-would be ' superior to yours, even were you my husband." 'But the law does not prevent him from parting with -the title to his property. I know his financial condition. : He' wants money, and for a few paltry dollars he will sell . you-a jewel worth more than 'rillions of gold." "You are mistaken. You do pot know Ruy dranda- ville as I do. He may need money, but I understand :the value I hold in his eyes. He loves me, slave as I am; has-loved me long, and, perhaps, had I not been in his power, I might have. loved him. He possesses my -body, and I possess his heart. O! there's some recom- pense in that. He has surrounded me here with every (Uxury his means could afford. He tells: me that he is ; -about to be married to a lady of great wealth; not that he'loves her, but that he may continue to supply me with ' every comfort. I do not doubt the truth of what he says.

Let us fly at once."            o The longing look that took possession of Isabella's eyes, upon hearing these words, was terrible to behold. Again she bent forward and hid .her face. The tempest had returned in all its fury. Nothing was- heard for a time but her convulsive sobs. Then she acted. She spoke not a word. She uttered no reply to her lover's appeal. She simply reached forth her hand and placed if in his. He seized it and covered it with kisses., The decision was made. Then came the serious discussion of plans by which they were to make their escape from Isabella's master and ' - from the country. Aware of the terrible risk they were about to incur, they talked calmly enough now: the  lover's impetuosity was laid aside. It was decided that, on the third succeeding day,;Solorgne was to arrive as usual at the plantation, and tlt Isabella was to order out her favorite saddle-horse, as if to accompany him in a ., i: short ride for exercise. To conceal from the other slaves the direction they intended taking, thdy were to start in one nearly opposite; 'but, when out of sight of the planta- tion, were to change their course,' and proceid by unfre- quented paths, as rapidly as possible, to a point on the, - Mississippi a few miles below New Orleans., There So-  lorgne was to arrange to have a swift steamer in waiting, to take them to the mouth of the river, where they would i be transferred to an ocean-bound vessel going to Havana, .  or some port of Mexico. Thence their way to France:   - would be easy enough. Their plans matured, fearful that their longer stay might : excite suspicion, they arose and passed out of the garden.  5* * 4 *, s , \ , ..i.-%)   -io066-   Tbhe Sisters of Orleans. -  Scarcely had they left the spot, when there crept noise- lessly from a clump of-shrubbery just back of where, the lovers had been sitting, a silent, dusky form. .It was that of a woman, a mulatto, of about Isabella's age. Her fea-, tures were sharp and cunning in their expression, her eyes sparkling with excitement and a keen treachery, and ' her teeth, white and regular, gleaming brightly through her yellow lips. She'watched the retiring forms of So- lorgne and Isabella with a lo6k half triumphant and half malignant, plucking a-rose from its stem, as she did so, and tearing it to fragments as if with a fiendish pleasure. Then striking the air with clenched hand, and moving her lips as if speaking in her thoughts, she turned and stole silently away by another path.                ,        ,' ., , .         .            .

The above specimen of plain and and homely talk was ddressed by-Farmer Josiah Brown to the Reverend Mr. unnyman, pastor-of an interior New England congrega-   r-, on, about the time the anti-slavery agitation began to  i l isturb, and divide the minds of men in that section of ie country.          i! The farmer's wife being a member of the: Rev. Mr. unnyman's congregation,' and .the farmer himself one of ie most substantial and influential men of the neighbor- ood, the reverend, gentleman' made free in his calls at le farmstead, and hoped soon to number its head among   - he yecognized pillars of his church. The conversation, \ -             .      ,: * *    A -Northern an M i the South.    I09  rom which I have given a significant passage, occurred   : n the parlor or best room of the house, on the occasion )f one of these visits, and had incidentally turned upon' :he subject which was then beginning to absorb so large  t share of public attention. The Rev. Mr. Sunnyman  dopted with considerable warmth the view which was at  Lhat time-the most popular concerning the} justice of negro slavery,"and- expressed very decided disapprobation 3f such as chose to avow a contrary opinion. To his great surprise, he failed to find in the farmer a sympathi-, ser withi himself and the public generally. And upon    : that individual declaring his conviction that -slavery was wrong, the pastor had undertaken to disabuse his mind  e of such a dangerous heresy by quoting a few passages. of Scripture calculated, as he believed, to prove the divinity* (f- of the disputed system. The response has just been given.  The result of the'discussion was, that the Rev. Mr. Sunnyman, on the next Sabbath, preached an unusually forcible ,sermon upon the great absorbing question. -His discourse abounded in Scriptural quotations, and his re- ' marks, which were usually of a-very mild and persuasive-  character, on this occasion grew warm with denunciations and threatenings of wrath when he came to speak of those whose fanaticism endangered thehiarmony of Church and   'I State. It was noticed-that, as he reached this portion of'i his discourse, his remarks seemed to be directed more especially towards the farmer's pew, which, as a conse- quence, for many Sabbaths thereafter remained unoccu- pied. From that time forward, F/armer Brown became known .to. his neighbors as -an " abolitionist," and was' criticised Accordingly;. although it was not observed that ; - his dealings were less upright, nor his manner less kind. and hospitable.                     .:  As for the Rev. Mr. Sunnyman, he continued to- give   II0 .    The Sisters of Orleans. warning against theinsidious and growing doctrine until r-it had acquired such strength as made it formidable in both Church and State, and even threatened the disrup- tion of hil own congregation; when he began to see mat- ters in quite a different light, and was enabled to find texts upon the other side of the question. So rapidly did his conversion go forward, that he was, soon after, moved to preach' a powerful discourse against the iniquity of one man holding another in bondage, quoting largely from the,:Scriptures to sustain his position. During the conversation referred to, and which involved such lasting consequences, Charles Brown, the farmier's only son, a lad of fourteen or fifteen summers, was present, and a deeply-interested listener. Under the influence of such parental teaching, it is not strange that; when the boy had become a man, he entertained opinions decidedly adverse to slavery, and, like his father, he was in no wise- reticent in their expression. At school and college they involved him in numerous controversies, and on one occasion led to a personal encounter between him and the son of a Southern planter, who addressed him in a grossly insolent manner on account of his unpopular views. A blow from the young New Englander, in return for the insult, laid his defamer sprawling in the dust. The college faculty, being very anxious to retain the good opinion of their Southern patrons, required Charles to apologize in an abject, manner to his adversary. He refused, and was expelled from the institution.; With the disgrace of a college expulsion, and an unvarnished state- ient of the facts, he presented himself at his father's fireside. : "Right,-Charles, right!" exclaimed the old farmer en- thusiastically, after listening to a history of the affair, as he seized his son by the hand. "You did right, boy;   A Northern  Man in the South. -   II  I'm proud of you. You're a chip of the old block, and that's sound timber, if it is rough and crooked. Always  stand up for your principles, if you do have to fight for them." At the date of the events narrated in the preceding chapters, Farmer Brown had been gathered to his fathers  in the village churchyard, and Charles had come both to his father's and to man's estate. It so happened, like- wise, that he then found himself at a great distance from his New England home. This latter circumstance was     Al owing to the fact that his mother, who was still living, had had an only brother who, some years before, had  gone to New Orleans in the expectation that a fortune  could there be more rapidly accumulated than in his native State of Massachusetts. In that respect his anti-  cipations had been realized. His Yankee tact and energy  soon enabled him to accumulate a handsome property inJ his new home; but, before he had time to enjoy it, he was carried off by a two days' attack of yellow fever, the scourge of Southern cities. Having been too busy with  money-making to get married, his estate, upon his death,  went, by operation of law, to his only sister, the widow of Farmer Brown. That good old lady was alike grieved  and perplexed to hear of what the world pronounced her "good fortune "--grieved on account of the loss of her only and much-loved brother, and perplexed to know what to do with her unexpected prize.          , It was out of the question for Mrs. Brown to go in person to New Orleans' to look after her interests; her neighbors told her the lawyers there were terribly dis-  .. honest, as has, in fact, been said of them in other places; and, as for her son Charles, he was the apple of her eye.  ( To send him in the footsteps of her ill-fated brother to a place as full of physical and moral dangers as New  A:: ; *  ,  ,    . .:A " * '                           'I 2     The Sisters of Orleans. Orleans was represented to her to be, seemed to her like sending him to the grave, if not to something worse. In this emergency, Charles, who was anxious to see some- thing of the world, by laughing at his mother's fears on his account, decided the question according to his wishes, but much against her will.' She finally consented that he -might go South, upon a promise that he was to return as soon' as his business was concluded; and with many prayers and tears saw him depart. At the period-my story fairly opens, Charles had suc- ceeded, by close attention to the matter in hand, in so arranging the affairs of his deceased uncle's estate that his presence in New Orleans was no longer necessary. He had fixed -a day for his departure, and had written to his mother to that effect. During the few months of his stay'in the Southern metropolis, his mind being occupied with the one purpose of' his visit, he had made no general acquaintance, and had avoided, rather than sought, admission to fashion- able society. Among the few persons with whom he had become intimate, was another young New Englander who had settled in New Orleans, of the -name of Henry Max- well., Congeniality of tastes and the attraction of a com- mon. nativity had made fast friends of the two young men. "So, Brown, you are determined to leave us next week? I am surprised at such a resolution, when New Orleans offers so many inducements to a man of your energy and capacity to remain." "Such, Maxwell, is my purpose. A stronger inducement than any this city offers calls me back to my old home." "A woman in the case, I'll venture. Nothing else -would be powerful enough to take you away from such brilliant prospects as you have here opened up to you." "Yes, there is a woman in the case. My mother is in   4A Northern Man it the South.   113 New England, and I am bound by a solemn promise made her to return there as soon as the one object of my coming here was accomplished." "Well, if that is the case, I see no way of keeping you, except by setting the counter attraction of a young woman against that of an old one. And, by the way, while I think of it, there is to be a grand hop to-morrow night at:  the house of a friend of mine, one of the richest and most prominent of New Orleans' citizens; and I have influ- ence enough to secure you an invitation. All of the first- class fashionables will be there. You must go. I There is no telling what may come of it, when you behold the marvels of the enchanted land." Charles could assign no sufficient reason why he should not go, and so the proposed arrangement was made. On the evening referred th, the two friends made their way to the place of entertainment, a stately mansion, which they found brilliantly illuminated and filled with the best society, so called, of the great city. Nearly: all'pres- ent were strangers to Brown. "'Eligible,' I suppose, is the word in introducing you," whispered Maxwell, when they found themselves in that brilliant assembly. "I shall look for the best the market affords. Ha! here is the very thing-an article which everybody recommends-a combination of wealth, beauty, and the very bluest aristocracy. That tall young lady standing beneath the chandelier yonder, is a represen- tative of one, of the oldest and richest families. She is considered very attractive." "An opinion in which I should say the lady herself fully coincided," replied Brown with an indifferent glance. The person referred to was a-stately beauty, whose cold and haughty bearing showed clearly enough her own estimate of the importance of her position.   !I 4  .   7The Sisters of Orleans. - Shall I introduce you?" "No, thank you! my fancy does not happen to run in that channel. Blood and money are very well in their way, but -.I should like some evidence of heart where I am expected to bestow my admiration." "Well, then, if you do not approve of that style, here is something else to offer you of quite another description. You see, seated on an ottoman across the room, that -splendid combination of silks, laces, pearls, gems, flowers and so forth.  A little too much toilet, perhaps, to suit everybody's taste, but the wearer can afford to cover her- self with diamonds if she chooses. You notice that a dozen moths are fluttering about that flame, which proves there is something very seductive there. Its not blood, certainly, for her father came to New Orleans a runa- way ship boy, and was for a time a porter in a warehouse. He. now owns whole blocks of buildihgs, and is one of the m6st extensive slave-holders' in the State. There ought to be some sympathy between you, for her father was a  New Englander born and bred." "And is now one of the most extensive slave-holders in Louisiana; I would beg to be excused." This was said by Brown with a significant shrug of the shoulders. :. "Well, I  declare, I hardly know what to do for you," said "Brown's companion lauglingly. "There's some- thng very fascinating over there-now coming this way -that- grateful black-haired girl leaning on the arm of that tall, aristocratic gentleman. She is first-class in every respect; comes of an old family; blood pure Cas- tilian ; an heiress in her own right; and,!besides, is said to be a gdod daughter and kind mistress--but she's be- spoke. The tall man with whom she is promenading is to be her, husband. Its a   family affair; agreed on   A Northern Man in the South.    iI5 about the time the parties were born. So there's no use of bestowing any further attention in that quarter." Brown turned his eyes indifferently in the direction of the person who had elicited these remarks. The first glance, he hardly knew why, awakened his interest. She was not beautiful in the sense in which a ball-room belle might be expected to dazzle. Rather slight in figure, a brunette, with dark and wavy hair, a not very fair com- plexion, and eyes large and almost pensive in their ex- pression, her appearance was suggestive of quiet dignity; but there was, at the same time, something singularly sweet and engaging in her countenance. Her companion was evidently her senior by several years. He, however, needs no description in this place. He was Ruy Grandaville. Brown suffered his eyes to follow the two, steadily and without comment, for some minutes; when, turning to his friend, he surprised him by remarking: "I should like an introduction to that lady." "After what JI have told you?" replied Maxwell. "But that is as you choose. You shall be gratified the first opportunity that offers, which cannot be long de- ferred. Her companion will soon be seeking the card tables, which, if report speaks truly, interest him more than the society of his prospective bride. There, he is excusing himself, and will be out of the- way immediately. Now is our chance, while the lady is disengaged." Following the introduction came the usual common- places, and then a conversation in which Brown spoke of his intended departure for the North. "So you are about to leave us so soon," remarked the lady pleasantly. "You surprise me not a little. The majority of your people visiting our city, find so much that is attractive that they conclude to remain and iden-   II6     The Sisters of Orleans. Itify themselves with us. Why should you prove an ex. ception?" "To be perfectly candid, there are some things I am compelled to see here that I very much dislike," was Brown's reply. "You probably refer to the relation existing between master and slave." "I do." "I am astonished " "At my indiscretion in speaking on such a subject." "Not at all ; but that such a sentiment should come from a New England man." "It is my turn to be astonished."' "Then you may understand," replied Brown's com- panion with a musical laugh, " that although I have heard a great deal about New England abolitionists, and cer- tainly not much in their favor, you are positively the first New Englander I ever met who did not avow himself enamored of our 'peculiar institution!' I had almost come to the conclusion that you cunning Yankees, in coming South, ingeniously contrived to leave your North- ern opinions at home, and adopted new ones, on arriving here, better suited to our climate. "So far," she went on, " from the sentiment you have avowed being disagreeable to me, it is- one which I fully sliare." Brown was wholly unable to withhold a look of surprise, accompanied with enough admiration to make it tolerable in his companion's eyes. "I thought it not unlikely," he remarked, "that you were yourself interested in the disputed system."' "'So I am," she replied, "and that is what has made me question its justice. It has taught me that the people I am accustomed to call my slaves, are far-too kind and   A ANovthern zMan zi the South.  \ 117 true to be treated like so much merchandise. It may surprise you to hear me say that, next to my own father, whom I have all my life loved more than anybody else, the person holding the highest place in my affection is a slave. I call her 'mamma,' and she has honestly earned the title. Iy mother died before a time I can recollect, and dear old mamma, who was my nurse, has been .so faithful and loving-I don't believe there's anything in her power she would not do for me-that I can't help thinking it wrong that she should remain in servitude. But these things cannot interest you." They did interest Brown, however, and so deeply, that the conversation was protracted unusually for a ball-room conference. At its conclusion the lady politely invited him to call upon her at her residence, an invitation which he very cheerfully accepted. 'For the balance of the evening, although he lingered amid the pleasure-seekers, he made no further acquaintance, and greatly puzzled his friend Maxwell by his unaccountable reticence. The day which Brown had selected for his departure came, and still he remained where he was. Another and another followed, until the time lengthened into weeks, with the same result. He had at first written to his mother that he would be detained a few days beyond- what he had anticipated, without assigning any cause. Next he wrote that some " little matters," would occasion further delay, but that he would be home very soon. Again and again he found himself compelled to commu- nicate what he knew would be most unwelcome intelli- gence, without being able to give any reason that he felt would be satisfactory. Presuming'upon his mother's ignorance of business details, he left her to infer that the condition of his deceased uncle's estate was the cause of his detention; meanwhile, to allay what he supposed   1I 8     The Sisters of Orleans. would be her most serious apprehension, assuring her in every letter that he was in perfect bodily health. That excellent old lady, besides putting the house in thorough order, had been busy with the preparation of certain delicacies of the table which a New England housewife, of the old school, knows so well how to pro- vide, all of which were carefully set aside to await her son's arrival. When he failed to appear according to her expectation, she had upon her mind a double anxiety-7 the safety of heir son and the care of her treasured luxu- ries. As the time of waiting lengthened from days to weeks, her solicitude became excessive. Day and night she fretted herself, until, but for that strength of body and will which an active life had supplied, she would have been wholly prostrate. Her most painful reflection was upon herself for having consented that Charles should leave her in quest of that wealth which had been destructive to her only brother, and which, she was now almost persuaded, would be equally destructive to her only son. That'her boy could, in any way, be intention- ally responsible for the cause of her anxiety, she never for a moment supposed. Equally mystified was Henry Maxwell. He knew, what the old lady did not, that there was no business necessity detainig Charles, and he was aware of no other inducemen't sufficiently powerful to overcome his oft-expressed desire to reach his Northern home. "Tell me, Brown, what has come over you," said Max- well one evening, as the two friends were sitting near each other, several weeks after the main incidents herein- before recorded. , "I can't understand you at all of late. You seem altogether like-another man. A short time ago you were fully resolved on hurrying back to New England, and here you are, weeks after the time you had selected   ,4 Northern Man in the Soulth.   1i9 \      X for your departure. Your manner is changed, too, In- stead of being all life and energy as before, you now seem almost misanthropic. What can be the trouble? Your business, I know, is satisfactorily arranged. You do not appear to be contemplating any new venture. You avoid society. Since that affair of three or four weeks ago, you have absolutely refused to bear me company to any more fashionable gatherings. I know you don't dissipate. In short, I am completely bewildered by your conduct. Believe me, when I say, that I do not inquire out of idle curiosity, but with the hope and desire that I may in some way be able to serve you." "I believe I am bewitched," was Brown's reply. -   CHAPTER XII. THE TRIANGLE BUILDING AND THE CONTRABAND -SCHOOL. a e -a AM now compelled, in the development of my  story, to ask the reader to accompany me to one of the most uninviting ;districts of New S   Orleans. Entering a portion of the city which was almost entirely given up to foreigners and free per- sons of color, we would, at the period with which I am dealing, have come to a building which then made, and possibly it may do so still, a conspicuous feature in its neighborhood. It stood at a point where two streets came together in such a way as to leave an acute angle between them. Built upon the tongue of ground at its narrowest extremity, it became known, from its peculiar Shape,'as the "Triangle Building," and in the neighbor- hood was spoken of simply as the "Triangle."  Al- though it had been constructed with some architectural pretension, the "Triangle," at the time of which I am writing, had lost all claim to outward respectability. It was old, weather-beaten, and sadly exhibited its partici- pation in the blight of a degenerate locality: its windows were broken, filthy, and spotted with numerous substitutes for glass; its cornice was ragged with great seams, and many of its doors and window-shutters hung by crippled hinges ; its walls were garbage-stained ; and everything about it was suggestive of evil days. Internally, there was nothing to redeem its character. The entire building had been given up to renters of the 4l I L UULL   !1   T7he Triangle Buildinz-Contraband School. I21 poorer sort. The first or ground floor was occupied by shops supplied with very limited capital. There was a saloon for the sale of indescribable liquors; a pawn- broker's establishment with its three balls of golden promise, in this instance considerably tarnished; a re- ceptacle for old clothes and second-hand furniture; a barber-shop with its serpentine pole, and the additional sign of the barber himself lounging or sleeping for the greater part of the time in the chair intended for custom- ers ; a variety store whose assortment included meat, vegetables and hardware; and one or two other establish- ments of a nondescript order. The building was four stories high, and in that respect obtained prominence in a neighborhood where6"e struct- ures were generally low anid small. Above the first floor the rooms were let to families; but here it was a notice- able fact, that the tenantry, which appeared remarkably populous, was composed almost exclusively of persons, in whole or part, of African lineage. With such a population inside, it is easy to judge of the throng which frequented the streets adjoining. Ne- groes were here often to be seen collected in, such crowds as quite to occupy the sidewalks. On pleasant days, especially, there were bevies of juveniles, in which every shade was represented, from the purest black to a single remove from unmixed Caucasian. There were two street fronts to- the building, facing -the two avenues that made the long sides of the triangle. Running through the structure from street to street were several narrow halls, with a door or entrance on each street, through which the tenants of the upper stories se- cured access to their quarters. Ascending from these halls were narrow, rickety and generally filthy stairways. It will thus be seen that the building was, in fact, a row 6   I22     The Sisters of Orleans. of tenement houses, regularly varying in depth according j   to the distance they were located from the point of junc- tion between the streets, or in one sense the apex of the triangle. The reader, being made acquainted with the construc- tion of the building, or rather succession of houses which, being under one roof, were known by the designation of the "Triangle," will be prepared to follow the incidents now about to be related, and which, without such knowl- edge, might only lead to confusion in his mind. 'Not long after the day. first fixed upon, by Charles Brown for taking his departure from New Orleans,'a plainly, but neatly, attired female might have been seen to enter that quarter of the city to which the reader has just been introduced. That she was young, would be inferred from the lightness and energy of her step; but of her countenance no very definite idea could be formed on account of the long, narrow bonnet she was wearing, then popularly called a "shaker." It quite hid'her fea- tures, and might very well have been purposely adopted for disguise. She proceeded with a rapid step directly to the point where the "Triangle " stood ; passed partly along one side ofthe building; then quickly entered one ofthe doorways spoken of; glided along the narrow hall to the foot of the stairway, and 'ascended from floor to floor, until she had reached the upper story, where she, disappeared through a door that opened on her right hand as she went up, carefully closing it behind her. About the same hour, on the same day, a young man might have been seen to approach the same point by an- other street. He, likewise, proceeded rapidly, and in a manner which might have suggested the idea of a desire to avoid recognition. His features were shaded by a broad-brimmed Panama hat, so Irawn down over his face   The Triangle Building--Countrabnld School. I23 as to quite hide all of it except the lower part. His des- tination, as it proved, as well as the lady's, was the old "Triangle Building." Here, however, taking the side- walk on the other side of the building from the one she had just passed over, he entered the hall next beyond the one she had entered, ascended rapidly to the upper floor, and there disappeared through a door on his right hand, but which, on account of the direction from which he ap- proached it, admitted him to the same-room the lady had entered but rew minutes before. It will thus be seen that, owing to the peculiar construction of th/ old tene- ment building, the room in question could be reached from two streets, by means of separate halls and separate doors, and in such a way that a person watching one pas- sage, might know nothing of a person approaching or escaping by the other. Once inside the room the lady hastened to remove her bonnet, and, in so doing, revealed the same pleasant, thoughtful countenance which, at the first glance, had so interested Charles Brown on the night of the social gath- ering to which he had been persuaded to go by his friend Maxwell. In this she-was by no means unobserved; for as soon as the door was closed behind her, a motley col- lection of children, who had apparently been anxiously - awaiting her appearance, not noisily, but eagerly, crowded around her with an enthusiastic, joyous greeting. Almost every shade of color was there, from the deep black to the light octoroon; all, however, betraying some African kin- ship. They were of all ages, from the child of six to the youth almost grown to womanhood or- manhood. Their garments were as various in fashion' and texture as were their ages and complexions. In one thing only did they , appear to agree, and that was the satisfaction with which : they hailed the new-comer. As for the lady herself, her   J124'     The Sisters of Orleans. gratification at the meeting seemed almost to equal theirs. She stooped down and kissed two or three of the smaller ones- that clamored importunately about her, and spoke a pleasant word to all. While she was yet in the midst of the happy throng that had given her so hearty a welcome, the door oppo- site the one by which she had entered swung open, and in walked the gentleman who was seen approaching by the other passage. As he did so, he removed the hat which had so effectually hidden his features, and Charles Brown, for he it was, bowed politely to the lady in the midst of her demonstrative friends, and addressed a kind "Good morning " to the others. The reader will, by this time, be pretty well able to infer the object which had brought parties so dissimilar in all their circumstances together in that remarkable place and manner, A glance round the room, had any question remained, would have told the balance of the - story. The apartment was long and narrow, extending lengthwise the entire width of the building. A conse- quence was that, from windows at the ends, a view was to be had of the two streets forming the triangle. No better location to observe the approach of a hostile party could have been selected. et either end of the apart- ment was a small platform, on which stood table and chair, while a row of plain wooden benches nearly filled up the intermediate space. On the wall, at one side, was a large blackboard. It was easy enough to be seen that the room was used for school purposes. Charles was the first to call attention to the business which had brought them there. "'It is time, Miss Castellos, we, were proceeding with the exercises of the day. Are our pupils all assembled?" An affirmative answer having been returned by her   The Triangle Building-Contraband School. I25 who was addressed as Miss Castellos, all present took their places, the teachers the seats upon the platforms, and the scholars, divided according to sex, the benches in the central portion of the room. The recitations and instructions proceeded rapidly and orderly. Only the more simple elements of learning were attempted to be taught, and those in the plainest and fewest words. Altogether it was a most singular spectacle. Not the \ least curious feature resulted from the unequal advance- ment of the pupils. The smaller scholars were fre-. quently by far the most proficient. Not only did the darkest skinned mingle on terms of perfect familiarity with the fairest present, but young men and young women stood side by side with mere children in laborious efforts to master the alphabet. While it was evident enough that none but the most limited opportunity had been enjoyed by any of them, all the scholars seemed eager to learn, and not a few-dis- played remarkable aptitude. The looks of undisguised elation which lit up their countenances, when some more than ordinarily difficult point had been mastered, brought smiles even to the grave visage of their New England teacher, to whom the scene had not yet altogether lost its novelty. L But the highest evidence of progress was to be seen in the superior appearance and bearing of those in attend- ance, when brought into contrast with their companions / of the surrounding streets.' Coarse, and even ragged, as their apparel often was, it furnished signs of unaccus- tomed care, and their manner was characterized by a confidence and courtesy which showed the infusion of new ideas and new hopes. Through their efforts the school-room was swept and polished untilj it had become   I26      Trhe Sisters of Orclans. almost cheerful in its cleanliness, and, in the expressior of a newly-awakened taste, even rude attempts at adorn. ment had been made. At various points throughout the apartment branches and garlands of evergreen had been fastened to the walls, or suspended overhead; while upon Miss Castellos' table, the joint contribution of a number of little hands, sparkled a fragrant bouquet, brilliant with gaudy flowers, which seemed as strangely out, of place in that locality as did the lady herself. In such things was the influence of a work, which was, to the performers, a labor of love, chiefly to be seen, proving affition to be far the best teacher. Kindness was of mote account, under the circumstances, than learning. What those des- pised ones most needed, was the instruction which came from the heart rather than from the head. Their greatest incentive was the recognition of an equal humanity. All the knowledge the world contains, crammed into the brain of one who feels that he is a subordinate and infe- rior, would never raise him to the grade of a an. A  few hours sufficed to go through the customary exer- cises, at the conclusion of which, Charles, who assumed the chief direction, addressed a few words of commenda- tion and advice to the children, and then dismissed them to their homes. One at a time, and without noise or con- fusion, they passed out of the two doors already spoken -of, and melted so gradually and imperceptibly into the variegated mass of humanity that was always collected in anad around the "Triangle Building," that an ordinary observer would 'have noticetd no addition to its numbers. There was none of that exuberance and recklessness or- dinarily displayed by children on such occasions. On the contrary, the avoidance of everything calculated to attract attention, showed how sensible all were of the danger to which they and their instructors were exposed. For it   The'Triazgle Building--Colotraband Schzool. 127 must be known that the work in which Charles Brown and his coadjutor were engaged, however commendable in itself, was one so liable to arouse the suspicious temper of a jealous slave-holding community, that not only its success, but its continued prosecution, depended entirely I   "upon the secrecy with which it was conducted. None realized this fact more clearly than the children them- selves, who had been taught, with the first bitter lessons of a hard life, that they belonged to a proscribed race, and that learning, like the majority of luxuries they en- joyed, was to be acquired only by stealth. Caution with them, in the presence of their superiors, seemed almost an instinct. It had been the lesson of every hour they lived. Light-hearted as the negroes, taken as a people, un- questionably are, it is a mistake to suppose they were ever given to noise and gayety where slavery has pre- vailed. The pictures which have been so -often drawn of     boisterous meeting and hilarity among plantation-slaves I    are pleasant, but baseless, fictions, owing their origin to I the imaginations of the master-race. The songs-and songs are always the truest expression of a people's heart -in which the negroes, in their dependence, gave ut- terance to their freest thoughts, were low and plaintive; sweet because of the tone' of sadness with which they were pervaded. Living under the shadow of a wrong scarcely understood, but realized almost from birth, they early learned to-put the rein upon their tongues. Know- ing that they were under constant surveillance themselves, the very air they breathed was full of suspicion. With nothing in their lives to inspire confidence, they would have suffered all the pains of martyrdom before betray- ing a member of their own race, or .one whom they be- lieved to be a true- friend to their race.   I28.     The Sisters of Orleans. All the pupils had taken their quiet departure, except one. That one, a tall and graceful girl of some fifteen years of age, 4 mulatto, and a scholar of more than ordin- ary sprightlinress, as well as of prepossessing appearance, lingered behind. Rhoda, for that was her name, had become an especial favorite with Miss Castellos, both on account of her intelligence and the gratitude she dis- played for the favors she had received. She now stood with downcast eyes and timlid manner, -as if something was upon her mind which she dreaded to communicate. Noticing her embarrassment, Miss Castellos asked her kindly to speak out. - "What is it, Rhoda? Speak freely. We will gladly hear you, and help you, if we can." "  O! Missey Castellos, you'se too good. I'se not de- servin' ob such kindness at your hands, fur-fur I'se bery, bery mis'rable." Here the poor girl could restrain her tears no longer, and for some minutes. sobbed too violently for further ut- terance. But, quieted at length -by the kind things said to her, she became sufficiently composed to tell her story. "- Long as ole Massa lib, I'se neber hab no trouble. He whip de oders, but he allers say pleasant tings to me, an' let me go purty much whar I'se pleased. Dat's de- way I come to dis here school.

Dem twenty-four hours am up dis bery afternoon, an', ! Missey Castel- los, Missey Castellos! what is Pse 'gwine to do? what is I'se gwine to do?" The poor girl had fallen on her knees, and buried her face in her teacher's dress. Charles and Miss Castellos exchanged' glances, the eyes of the latter half blinded with tears, and those of the former burning with illy sup- pressed indignation. Brown was the first to speak. "My detestation of a system which puts one human being absolutely in the power of another is so great that, to this moment, I never have supposed it possible that I could consent to become a party to the purchase of a fellow-creature. But if, by buying this poor girl, I could secure her escape from that brutal master and give her freedom, I feel that I could overcome my scruples. What-think you, Miss Castellos; could I accomplish her deliverance in that way?" Miss Castellos, thus appealed to, shook her head sadly. "I fear the attempt would be unavailing," she replied. "Money would probably be but a slight temptation in the eyes of a person as self-willed as Rhoda's' master. Your interference would only make him the more determined in his purpose, besides bringing suspicion on yourself." "Then what can we do?" asked Brown. To this question there was no answer, Miss Castellos being evidently as much at a loss as the inquirer. A painful silence ensued. Rhoda herself was the first to suggest what promised a solution of the difficulty.    The Triangle Buildin5g-Contraband School. 13 I "I'se heard tell," she began somewhat hesitatingly, "ob a place, somewhar 'way up in de Norf, whar all de cullud folks is free; an' dey says dat de darkies dat am slaves sometimes runs off an' gets dar. Oh! I'd risk whippin', an' cold, an' starvin', an' eberyting to reach dat place, if you'se only show me de way. But," she added after a slight pause, "would it be right fur me to run 'way? I'se a slave -Massa's prop'ty. Wouldn't it be like takin' his ring without his 'sent, if I'se war to go?" "Go! go!" exclaimed Miss Castellos impulsively. (' Heaven will forgive such robbery, and may it 'help you to reach the land of deliverance you speak of in safety." It now took but a few minutes to decide upon a plan of action. Miss Castellos undertook to conceal the slave-girl in her own house, until some means of escape from the city could be devised. Brown, on his part, ex- pressed the belief that he could secure a passage for her with the captain of a ship about to sail Northward, the impression being conveyed,'as far as could consistently be done, that she was a free person. This matter arranged, the parties left the schoolroom separately, and by the same passages by which they had been seen to enter the old "Triangle Building."   CHAPTER XIII. LOWLY LOVERS. THE sudden appearance and singular conduct of the mulatto woman or girl, who stood watching the departing forms of Solorgne and Isabella, at the conclusion of the inter- view in the flower-garden heretofore described, whichl brought them to an understanding of each other's feel- ings, require an explanation. The person who had been playing spy upon the lovers was a slave belonging to the plantation, known as Yellow Jule. The expression of mingled cunning and malevo- lence her countenance betrayed on the occasion referred to, showed that she had inherited the worst properties of the two races from which she was decended. But a mere love of evil, and a propensity to pry into others' secrets, would hardly account for the look of intense hatred with which her eyes followed the retiring forms. Another passion was at work--one no less powerful and danger- ous than Jealousy. Of Isabella, it would not be presumed, that one so far inferior as the mulatto evidently was, could be a rival; although both, as has now been made to appear, were slaves, and the property of one master. The rivalry which, in this'instance, was' the cause of ill-feeling, had for its object Isabella's waiting-maid, a negress of un- mixed blood, of the somewhat inappropriate name of, Rose. Rose was a clever, merry girl of some sixteen summers,   Lowly Lovers.        133 whose warm heart had won for her a high place in Isa- bella's affections: The result of such preference was that, being made a personal attendant upon her mistress, slave though the mistress was like herself, she became the happy recipient of many tokens of regard in the way of dresses and jewelry, a rather ostentatious display of which failed not to excite the animosity of some of her fellow- servants. The superior privileges enjoyed by Rose, would haave been enough to make Yellow Jule her enemy, had no other cause of irritation existed. But there'was' another and much deeper provocation. Rose had secured the unmistakable preference of Jefferson, the acknowl- edged Apollo of the plantation. Jefferson, was a negro of undoubted purity of descent. Tradition said that his father had been an African king, who had been brought to America on a slaver. It was certain that his fellow-bondsmen looked upon him as,- in some respect, greatly their superior. His commands were as cheerfully obeyed by them as if he had been their master, instead of a slave like themselves. His appear- ance and bearing, as far as such things could do, justified his claim to royalty. He was fully six feet in height, magnificently proportioned, and- carried himself with an air of great dignity and conscious worth. Nor were his pretensions without some justification in his deserts, not- withstanding his menial position. He was singularly quick as a mechanic, and his skill was almost invaluable on the plantation. The judgment he displayed in all matters coming under his supervision and his authority over his fellow-servants, soon pointed him out as one who could safely be trusted with responsibility; and Isabella, to whose direction Grandaville left everything in his ab- sence, had selected him as her principal assistant in the management of the plantation. Never was trust more   - / I34      The Sisters of Orleans. faithfully discharged; for Jefferson, exacting as he was from those of his own color, was ever ready to execute the slightest w'sh he could gather from- his whiter mis- tress' lips with a zeal and promptitude proving the sin- cerest devotion.  It will thus be seen that' Jefferson was a person of con- siderable consequence, and Yellow Jule obeyed a very 'natural preference in aspiring to his good graces. All of her advances were,..unavailing; partly because Jefferson, proud of his unsullied dusky stock, looked with secret disdain upon one whose saffron countenance showed adulteration, and partly -because the cheerful,. buxom Rose had taken full possession of his heart. The' last-mentioned fact was. attributed by the disap- pointed and enraged mulatto, not so much. to Rose's superior personal attractions, as to the advantages she enjoyed through her mistress' favor. To one of her jealous, malignant spirit, that was quite enough to arouse a feeling of bitter resentment against the mistress as well as against the maid, and make her ready and eager to seize the first favorable opportunity for doing her an injury. With the acuteness for which many of her class are distinguished, she had reached the conclusion that the young Frenchman's repeated appearances at the planta- tion meant more than friendship for the master. Accord- ingly, she watched every movement of Solorgne and Isa- bella with the sharpness of a practiced detective. She had, on the occasion heretofore described, seen them enter the garden, and quickly placed herself in the most favorable position to discover all that transpired. The, thickly-growing shrubbery favored her purpose, and, hav- ing heard every word that passed, she was fully advised as to the lovers' contemplated flight. The look of almost   Lowly Lovers.        I35 fiendish satisfaction that lighted up her sharp, sallow fea-  tures, as she gazed after their receding forms, showed clearly enough that she was rejoicing in the prospect of coming revenge. But that day was not alone to be an important one to Solorgne and Isabella. Others on .the Grandaville plan- tation were, at the same time, gaining a knowledge that. to them was of equal interest. For a considerable time back, Rose had discovered alarming indications of a growing coldness on Jefferson's part. Such a phenomenon she was wholly unable to ac- count for, and no artifice to which she could resort had extracted the secret from her moody lover. In her dis- tress of mind she applied'to Isabella for sympathy and counsel. The latter advised her, as there ought to be no secrets between affianced lovers, to speak frankly to Jefferson of her mistrust. Circumstances that day had favored such design. Her mistress had, upon:the arrival of Solorgne, probably with a view to removing as many- inquisitive eyes as possible, sent her with a commission to a distant portion of the plantation. On the way, she encountered Jefferson. She found him more reserved than ever, but she was not to be put off with either frown ' or absent look. She demanded to know the meaning of his altered conduct, and, as a passionate burst of tears accompanied the request, it was very natural that her lover's coldness should partially yield to her persistency. ( Dar'se some oder one you'se ben tinkin' 'bout. I'se knows dar is from de way you'se ben carryin' on ob late. Dar'se no use ob yose e denyin' it; cause why should you'se keep 'way so much ob de time, an' look on de groun' when I'se 'bout, if 'twarn't so? I'se not changed t'ward you, an' you'd not change t'ward me if dar-war no oder 'traction."   136      The Sisters of Orleans  e B Jefferson's reply was a complete surprise; as Rose had expected a flat denial to her accusation, which she was only in part prepared to believe herself. "Yes, Rose, you'se right. Dar is anoder 'traction on which my toughts hab run a great deal ob late. - Better you'se should know--at once, an' dat we'se should hab understandin' with one anoder. I'se glad you'se hab spoke." "Dar, I'se knowed it!" exclaimed Rose, breaking, as she spoke, into another flood of tears which her compan- ion made no effort to check. "I'se knowed you war false, from de way you'se ben gwine on. You'se a wicked, 'ceitful, treach'rous nigger; dat'se what you'se is, but-- but--but who am she " "Who am who?" "Why, de t'oder 'traction." Receiving no immediate reply, Rose went on spitefully: "Some great buty, IPse 'spect-white p'haps--most as purty as. Missey Bella." ' "Yes, Rose, she'se bery butiful. She'se white too-- white as de angels in de picter books we'se looked ober t'gedder, an' her face am like Heaben itself. Shel'e far purtier dan Missey Bella, dough dat am skyin' a" good deal." s: Lor' a mercy me! den dar'se no more hope fur poor : black Rose." And the tearful girl turned her eyes up- ward with an agonizing expression. "But whar in de wide world does she lib? I'se sure dar'se nobody purtier dan Missey Bella 'bout dis plantation." "No, Rose! she lib a great way off-'in de clouds." "Jefferson, you'se crazy; talkin"bout white folks pur- tier dan Missey Bel-la, an' 'bout gwine to de clouds fur some one, to ltub, when I'se here on de groun'. But what's de name ob dis wonderful buty?"                  /   Lowly Lovars.        '37 "Her name am Liberty, -Rose. You hab neber seed heri an' but few ob our 'plexion hab. I'se had only glimpses ob her in de stillness ob de night, when I'se ben layin' on de groun', lookin' into de sky an' tryin' to tink ob you. Den somehow or oder her face would come in 'tween you'se an' mine,: an' she would look so butiful an' kind, I'se felt like gettin' down on my knees an' prayin' to her." "O, Jefferson! what does you m nan?" "Dat I'se wants to be free. ItS not dat I'se lubs you de less, Rose; fur my 'fection ful you fust started dis new longin' in my heart. When I'se 'gins to tink ob makin' you my wife, I'se says to myself, ' She'll neber be mine long as we'se slaves. She'll still b'long to-anoder, who may take her 'way any time he chooses, an' leab me nothin' 'cept vexation an' mis'ry. An' de little children, if Heaben eber bless us with dem, won't be ours neider. Some one comes 'long when we'se learned to lub dem better dan our own selves, an' tears dem from us, an' we neber, neber see dem 'gain.' O, Rose! when I'se tought ob dese tings, my heart hab jess come up into my mouf, an' I'se hab 'dlared I'se neber gwine to hab wife nor child long as I'se a slave, neber! neber!" "But," timidly suggested Rose, frightened by her lover's terrible earnestness, and half convinced of the soundness of his views-" but we war born slaves." "No, Rose, dat's not so. Heaben made 'us free. It war de white folks dat make us slaves. Dey stole my 'fadder an' mudder, an' your fadder an' mudder, way ober in Africa 'fore we war born, an' dey stole, you an' me when we war born, an' its ben -nuffin' but stealin' eber since. But fur dem, I'd dis day be a king, with a spear huntin' de wild beasts in de country whar I'se b'longs i  an' my wife, Rose, would be a queen. 'Stead ob dat,   1x38     The Sisters of Orleans. I'se a ting ob no 'count, 'cept to work Massa's field, 'like Massa'S horse an' ox. Its de white folks' power an' knowledge, not de white folks' right, dat make, us slaves. But dar'se one thing dey can't steal," resumed the speaker, after a brief pause, and who, in his agitation, had risen to his feet, and stood before his trembling com- panion a splendid specimen'of a great, nervous man- "an' dat's de lub ob liberty de great God dat made us puts in ode soul; an' sure as he'se de juss God I'se b'lieves him to be, he'll some day make dem dat robs us ob dat liberty pay fur dar 'pression' with dar hearts' blood."      - "But what," replied Rose, thoroughly alarmed by Jef- ferson's fierce talk and manner, " hab we to 'plain ob here? Don't Massa gib us eberyting we needs ;'an' ain't Missey Bella more. like a sister dan anyting else? I'se can't see how we'd be better off, if we war free." "Dat's true,. Rose," responded Jefferson slowly and meditatively. "But 'spose Mass' Grandaville die, or gets into trouble, as dem sort -ob folks sometimes does, an' deysells de plantation an' de slaves. Or 'spose he marry some fine lady, as dey say he'se gwine to do 'fore long--what den comes ob Missey Bella? She am slave, too. 'Haps she be sold to some'oder-fine gemman. An' when Missey Bella's sold an' gone, what den comes ob de little Rose, with her fine dresses an'grand ways? An- swer me dat, will you?" The' picture thus drawn was too much for the simple- hearted girl. She began to weep bitterly, speaking, as she could, through her tears: "Poor Missey .Bella! poor Missey Bella! I'se knowed dar war sumthin' 'stressin' her. - She habn't ob late ben t'all like what she used' to war. She habn't sung an' played; an' more'n once I'se seed de tear drops runnin'   Lowly Lovers. '     .  39 down her cheeks, an' when I ax her what's de matter, she jess brush 'way de tear an' neber answer. O, dat wicked Mass' Grandaville! to-tink ob marryin' with Missey Bella here, an' he allers littin' on to lub her so much-de onreasonable, 'ceitful critter!" With this the poor girl broke down completely. Her sobbing became so violent that Jefferson's sympathies were touched, and, to make amends for the pain he had inflicted, he began a- series of lover-like endearments that were speedily effective in restoring her to a better frame of mind. "Now Rose," said he, "its better dat we'se clearly 'stands one anoder. My mind's made up dat I'll neber marry in de state obslavery, neber! I'se ready to do all I'se 'greed; but if we'se marry, it must be on de 'spress 'standin' dat we'se starts at once fur a place ob freedom.." "You'se don't mean dat we'se to run 'way, does you? Why dey'll set de dogs arter us, an', if dey cotch us, dey'll jess whip de life out."  "Yes, Rose, I'se means dat we shall try to reach dc land whar de cullud folks is as free as de white folks is. Dar's plenty cullud folks dat gits dar spite ob de dogs. An' if dey do cotch us, dey can't do more'n kill us, an' r dat dey'se welcome to do, if dey wants to. Better die dan lib de life ob de slave. Yes, Rose, I'se in earnest. You'se got to make up your mind which you'se gwine to do-run 'way with' me, or stay an' quit tinkin' bbut Jef- ferson." The climax thus reached-was decisive of the question. All the terrors which had arisen in the girl's mind at thought of the /pursuit, the dogs and the whipping, fled before the more dreadful alternative of losing her lover. She lastened to make known her decision. "O, Jefferson! I'd Jo with yoh anywhar, if 'twarn't fur At   "O      The Sisters of Orleamns. Missey Bella. I'd risk all de dogs an' de whips; but when it comes to leavin' Missey Bella, who'se ben so kind an), lubin; and she 'stressed an' troubled-dat, dat's sumthin' I'll neber, neber, neber do." Such manifestations of fidelity and affection so power- fully appealed to Jefferson's sensibilities, that he began to think of compromise. The result of the interview was an agreement that Jefferson should restrain his longing for freedom until such time as Rose could obtain Isabel- la's consent, or was released from her service,'when the two were to unite their fortunes in a resolute attempt to reach a land of liberty. Everything being thus amicably settled, the world prob- ably containeA no happier mortals than those colored lovers, so pooh at they did not even own their own per- sons,/'and yet rich in 4boundless affection. Who that could then have seen their glowing countenances, but would have been convinced' that hearts as loyal, and sympathies as strong, may find a place beneath the mask of the negro's skin, as dwell in the bosoms of a fairer and more favored race? In the enjoyment of that bliss un- speakable, which follows the restoration :of interrupted harmony between spirits that have learned to accord, we must, for the time, leave our sable hero and heroine, to pursue the fortunes of other actors in' this tale. '/. . *  j           v  ,.   CHAPTER   XIV. THE DRAGON'S DEN. "' -ir^Tjg- F I'se owned dat nigger, I'd jess kill him, dough he am my own son."  The object of the above sanguinary obser- - s^G1^  vation was our restless ,acquaintance of a previous chapter, the negro boy Frog, who had been de- tected in some juvenile indiscretion, and its author, the boy's mother and wife of another of our acquaintances; Dragon. The remark was every way worthy of a drag- oness. The time of its utterance was the early twilight of the day on which the incidents recorded in the last two chapters had transpired, and the place the cabin in whith the Dragon family dwelt. The auditory to which the unnatural declaration was addressed, consisted of Dragon, who, being as deaf as the walls of his hut, was totally unconscious of the denunciation pronounced upon his progeny; ,another elderly colored female who went by the title of Aunt Rach, being probably an abbreviation of Rachel; and the mulatto girl Jule. The cabin .in question, which was not inappropriately known as the "Dragon's Den," was one of the most un- ( attractive of its class. It was a structure of one room, without floor save the earth, and with a single window made by sawing a square opening through the logs, and left without glass or sash. A more gloomy quarter could not well have been imagined, particularly at that hour. Nor did the appearance of the inmates relieve the other- wise sombre aspect of the place.  The old women, in the - i , /  /         .. /.    s;   ;:   i42      The Sisters of Orleans. increasing darkness, looked like two resuscitated mum- mies;'and the yellow girl's lighter complexion and sharply- cut features gave her an appearance that was weird and fiendish. The: occupation of the elder females added to the- unnatural effect, they being lusy with their home- made pipes, through the smoke of which their countenan- ces, as the light of the tobacco fires occasionally flashed over them, gleamed and glowered with an expression truly diabolical. "Sumthin's gwine to happen," sagely observed the Dragoness. "I'se feels it in de bone. Sich rheumatics as I'se had all de day in de lef shoulder hasn't corned ,fur- nuffin'."  "Sartin ob it," responded the other crone. "I'se had de pain in de right side under de las' rib all de day drough. I'se had de same pain de day 'fore my third husband -die, an' I'se says den 'somebody's gwine to be dead, an' sure 'nough it happen jess so." "Lucky darkey! to hab de three husbands die, an' feel de pain but de one time." This shot was from the mulatto, whose white teeth and small twinkling eyes, in the uncertain light, imparted a -peculiarly malicious expression to her grinning counte- nance. "Shut up dar, you yaller nigger! What does you'se know 'bout it? My two fust husbands didn't die; dey war sold," And at this Aunt Rach, laughed as if she had said a particularly good thing, thinking, doubtless, she had silenced her tormentor. She was mistaken. That saucy young person was ready with-her retort. "I tpught, p.'haps, dey mought hab runned 'way." Here it .was the yellow girl's turn to laugh; but such a low- order of wit was evidently regarded by the elder op-  .   2              .    a   '*   The Dragon's Den.       143 ponent as unworthy of notice, a"s she attempted no reply. "But dar'se sumthin' mighty cur'ous gwine on roun', dis plantation," resumed the Dragoness, as soon as the above diversion was ended. "Dar war lightnin' in de Norf las' night, an' not a cloud to be seed; an' sure 'nough dis bery day dat young feller de horse most kill, coined back sound as eber. Mighty cur'ous 'bout- his colmin' hei e." "An' Missey Bella," struck in Aunt Rach; "she jess ought to be 'shamed ob de p'sumpttion with which she carries on with dat Frencher feller, when Mass' Granda- ville's not 'bout." "Not so cur'ous as you'se tink -fur," interjected the yellow girl, " if you'se only knowed what I'se knows ob de doin's ob Missey Bella an' dat Solorgne. 'Spect Mass' Grandaville l'get his eyes open to de 'ceptiousness ob de lady he'se ben makin' so much ob 'fore long. 'Spect he'll find dat a little less ob de white blood would do jess as well, when it comes to de nigger's place." The support thus brought to the old woman's insinua- tion was, however, far from being well received. The same slander that is sweet to our own lips, is often nau- seating when it falls from others'. So, in this instance, the mulatto's reflection upon her fellow-bondswoman, although but an echo of her companions' words, at once roused all their ire.      / "Now you'se jess hush, you 'spicious, jealous critter," began the female' Dragon. " 'Cause Bella's whiter dan you'se is, dat's/no reason you'se should 'buse her when dar'se no groun'. 'Spect Missey Bella knows what she's 'bout; an' Mass' Grandaville, too, when he maked her de lady an' you'se de kitchen gal. 'Haps you'se tinks dat by 'busin' her you'll make folks tink she'se no better lookin' dan you'se is. Nuffin you'se can say is gwine to  .   ! 44    nThe Sisters of Orleans. make this darkey b'lieve harm ob Missey Bella. If dar eber war a lady, she'se am de one." "Dat she am," echoed Aunt Rach. "She'se de good angel ob dis plantation." -"Didn't she;" broke in the Dragoness, "when Frog, de darlin', war bit with de pisen snake, with her own white han' gib him sumthin' to drink, an' de bite neber do no harm nor nuffin? Frog, de rascal, jess say he want to be bit agin," "An' when my ole man," quoth the echo, " war took -with the rhuematics, an' war groanin' and moanin', didn't she send de liniment to rub on de limb, an' de whiskey to take inard ; and he say dey do him so much good, 'spe- cially de whiskey." "Dat must hab been de fourth husband," wickedly remarked the mulatto. "Better hab 'four husbands dan not be able to hab none at all," was the sharp retort. "You'se spiteful, 'licious critter," resumed the Drag- oness more vehemently than before, directing her epithets at the mulatto. "',Dar you'se is, dis 'bery minute with one ob Missey Bella's dresses on, which she gibs you, an' yet you'se comes roun' 'busin' her an' 'sinuatin' dat she'se no better'dan she ought'r be. Tain't ob no use, dough. Eberybody. on this plantation knows dat Missey Bella couldn't do nuffinri wrong nohow."' The-fire of her adversaries was growing too hot for the girl, causing her to beat a retreat; but before entirely quitting the field, she sent back one shaft from the door- way. ' Jess you'se wait, an' 'fore three days am ober, you'll see whose de f6ol an' whose de sensible darkey. You'll see den whose de laff will be." - "What. dat gal mean by de: three days?"! anxiously -, .;'                      .. -.   Th e Dragonss Den,      I45  asked one of the crones, as soon as Yellow Jule was out of hearing. "'Spect she knows more dan she lits on. I'se allers tought dar war sumthin' wrong 'bout dat Bella. What right hab she got to be puttin' on? She'se nuffin but a slave like de rest ob us niggers." "An' dat Solorgne," interposed No. Two, "what biz- ness hab she to be carryin' on with him, when Mass' Grandaville's 'way an' knows nuffin ob- what's gwine on? Dar's mischief comin'." "I'se allers knowed," resumed No. Two, "dat gal'd bring ebil on dis place.' When she fust comedl, didn't one ob my ole men take de feber an' die, an' de worms take de cotton, an' de hurrycane come 'long an' tear up de big trees? She'se de ebil Spir't ob de plantation, sartin."  J "Dem's nuffin, dough," answered No. One, who was the Dragoness, "to what's gwine- to happen, if de rheu- matics an' all de oder signs izzn't ob no 'count. 'Why, de Lor' help us! de strangest tings hab been gwine on 'roun here you'se eber hear ob. De oder night, as my ole man dar war comin' through Missey Bella's flower garden, what should he see but a white woman kneelin' t  by de side ob one ob 'de-arbors, an' swayin' an' rockin' jess as if de wind war blowin' her 'bout; an' dough he'se deaf as dat log, he hear her moanin' an' cryin' jess as plain as nuffin. Den he knowed she war a Spir;t. De nex' day he war workin' in de garden, an' Missey Bella war fixin' dat bery arbor, when all at once she goes-right down out ob sight in'de groun', an' dat French feller comes up in de bery same spot." "De Lor'hab mercy!" groaned the other negress, and the two ancient hags drew close together in their fright, while the light from their pipes, roused to unusual activity by the intensity- of their -breathing, flickered and.   "6      The Sisters of Orleanizs. danced with a giddy measure over their black and shriv- eled features, making their haggard countenances almost as distinct as in the light of day. Nor were they, at that moment,'without cause for appre- hension. Scarcely were the words out of the last speak- er's mouth, when a crash overhead was heard, and a black body came crushing down upon them. A'hand, armed with. no inoffensive projections, lwept the, face of one, scattering pipd and tobacco in its way, while the other re- ceived a heavy thump on the rhuematic shoulder. Both rolled upon the floor, kicking and screaming like lunatics, while a black object, not unlike an imp of darkness, went tumbling out of the door, and there executed a half-dozen summersaults in rapid succession. The stronger outside' light showed it to be the youthful gymnast, Frog. In the exercise of his peculiar talent, he had quietly climbed the cabin wall, and, crawling noiselessly along some poles stretched overhead, had taken a favorable position to listen'to the conversation below. His weight had proved to be too great for the support, and hence the catas-  trophe. Although the phenomenon is thus satisfactorily ex- plained to the reader, the sufferers in the affair always attributed the assault directly to " de debel," who, besides being as tall as the house, -and having horns as long as their arms, according to the lucid account they ever after- wards gave,of the occurrence, paused long enough in the doorway to pronounce a solemn warning of the tragical eveits related in the next chapter.    CHAPTER XV. THE FLIGHT AND THE MDNIGHT DUEL. ? ---- E third day from the meeting in the garden "between Solorgrie and Isabella, of which an !account has been given, found the former promptly at the plantation. There was noth- ing in an occurrence which was witnessed so often, speci- ally to attract attention; nor was any unusual interest  awakened when Isabella ordered out her favorite saddle- horse, and the two rode away at a leisurely pace, as if for ordinary exercise. Sharp eyes, however, were upon them. The mulatto Jule was watching every movement, and as the riders pursued their way, she quietly disappeared in a strip of forest that skirted the road, and behind the cover of the treeskept them in sight, although herself un- observed. The pursuit in this manner was kept up, until the girl saw the equestrians turn from the main road into one less frequented, that led in the direction of the Mis- sissippi at a point below New Orleans. Instead of returning to the mansion, Jule quietly hid herself among some bushes at the road-side, in a position 'to see any one approaching, without herself being seen. Here she remained, keeping all the ;time a sharp look-out, for more than two  hours. Her watch was at last re- warded by the appearance of a horseman approaching at a rapid gait, a .sight which gave her manifest satisfaction. The rider was Grandaville. As he neared the point where the mulatto was crouching. among the bushes, his horse, the same high-mettled beast he rode the time So-   "8      The Sisters of Orleans. lorgne bore him company to the plantation, pricked up his ears, and began to show signs of uneasiness. And, as the girl rose up from 'her place of concealment, he gave such a sudden and violent spring that, but for 'his excellent horsemanship, the rider must have be n unseated. 'With a curse Grandaville first brought jhe agitated animal to a stand, and then turned witi an angry brow to seek the cause of alarm. His riding-whip was raised menacingly as he discovered a woman, evi- dently from her dress a slave, silently standing by the road-side. Jule threw back the old bonnet she was wear- ing, and so secured her master's recognition, just in time to avert the threatened chastisement. f "You yellow devil!" he exclaimed in some 'surprise, '"what brings you here?" Approaching her master, notwithstanding the horse's continued uneasiness on account of her presence, the girl proceeded rapidly to relate what she had seen and heard transpire between Solorgne and Isabella, describing par- ticularly the interview in the garden. Then she stated the events of the morning, the arrival of Solorgne, and the departure of the lovers in companv. "What did Isabella do before she started?" "Nuffin' t'all, Massa, 'cept dat she runs into de gar- den whar de flowers is, an' dar I sees her, fur Pse war bound to know all she done, kneelin' inside ob one ob de arbors, an' gwine on as dough she war cryin'. Den she gits up, pulls off one ob de flowers, shoves it in her bosom, an' goes-right straight to mount de horse, an' rides 'way with dat Solorgne. She neber offers to gib me nuffin' to 'member her by, nor stops to say one kind word fur, all I'se done fur her. I'se jess tinks-----" "Who cares what you think? Tell me what road they took, quick!"   The FAlght and the Miduiqght Duel.  I49 "De lef' han' fork road 't'oder side de wood dar dat runs--- - Before she could finish the sentence, Grandaville had put spurs to his horse, and was off at a gallop towards the mansion, leaving the mulatto gazing after him in no very amiable temper. a De white folks is all alike," she muttered. "Do what you'se may fur dem, dey neber tanks de cullud people. Dat war allers de way with Missey Bella; but Mass' Grandaville, won't he raise de ole Harry when he cotch her? ha! ha! ha! 'Spect he'll tink arter dis, dar's somebody else on de plantation worth 'siderin' 'side de grand white lady with dat nasty black Rose a snickerin' at her heels." And evidently relieved of a part of her spleen by this reflection, Jule set out as rapidly as she could in the direction of the mansion, to which her master had pre- ceded her, to watch the development of events. There she found intense excitement. The arrival of Grandaville, his command to Caesar and two other pow- erful negroes to mount swift horses and follow him, and the riding away of the four men at a rattling rate, were quite enough to throw the entire population left behind into a state of unprecedented fermentation. Frog was rolling and tumbling about in everybody's way like one possessed, and even the venerable Dragon had left his plants to join in the general confusion. But the chief centres of attraction were the two old women, Aunt Rach and the Dragoness, who were relating .to staring circles their experience of " 't'oder hight," when "de big black debel jess comed an' told all 'bout what war gwine to happen." But amid all the excitement there was sagacity enough left to reach the conclusion, that Isabella had " runned   150      The Sisters of Orleans.' 'way with dat Solorgne," and that," Mass' Grandaville," if he caught- them, would not leave " a har on dat feller's head."s At that juncture, it would have been difficult to have told with which party, the pursued or the pursuers, the sympathy of the assembly was. First let us overtake the'fugitives, and follow their for- tunes. Though unaware of an actual pursuit, they per- 'fectly comprehended the danger to which they were exposed. Theirs was no ordinary-case of elopement, in which heart-disappointment would be the- penalty of failure. They were lovers, with lovers' anxieties, but there was. added a fearful realization of personal peril. One -was a slave, the absolute property of a master whose power to punish had scarcely any other limit than his will. Before her was freedom-'France-a wedded life-the realization of a dream long indulged; behind her that despotism whose greatest mercy might be death. She knew Grandaville well enough to picture to herself the fury that would take. possession of him, when both his anger and jealousy were aroused by the discovery of her flight. The other was not simply despoiling a friend of his mistress; he was robbing him of his property, and Id that property a slave-an act severely punishable by law as a crime. .He knew not only that the legal penalty was excessive, but that public opinion had so stigmatized ;the offence as to justify almost any private revenge the injured party might take. He realized, too, the terrible wrath of Grandaville, when he learned all the facts. While he felt conscious of no guilt-having been reared in a non-slaveholding country-but, on the contrary, ex- ulted in the 'moral aspect of what he was doing, he fully recognized the terrible risk he was incurring. -   While each, therefore, endeavored to assume a cheer- fulness that was not felt, concealing their fears from each "         . i    '.      ,        .            .,   The Fl,-/oght ied the- 'Midnight Duet. 151 other as far as possible, it was not to be expected that many words would pass between the travellers. For the greater portion of the time they rode forward in silence; but O! how sensitive were their ears to. every sound, and how often did their disturbed imaginations convert the most inoffensive objects into the forms of dread pur- suers. But there were difficulties in their way far more serious than those of the imagination's creating. To the extent that Isabella's occasional rides for pleasure and ekercise had familiarized her with the surrounding country, they had no trouble in determining their way; but beyond that limit they found themselves in constant perplexity. The roads were indistinct at best, and swamps and for- ests frequently intercepted their course. All-the vicissi- tudes Solorgne had experienced in his first journey in that cheerless region, were now renewed under far more trying circumstances. The tortures of the keenest men- tal anxiety were added to the hardships of the way. To crown their troubles, the day was nearly spent with- out a knowledge on their part of how near they had come to their intended destination, concerning which they were afraid to inquire, lest it might lead to their betrayal. Night found them in the depths of a gloomy forest of unknown extent, with scarcely the trace of a path remaining. They endeavored for a time to press blindly forward in the direction which seemed the proper one; but without a single known object to guide them, they ere long realized that even in that they might be mistaken. They drew their reins, and the-terrible truth was confessed, that' they were--lost. With sad and fear- ful hearts they took counsel together; but no alternative offered, except to remain where they were until the morn- ing's light would enable them. to:.resume their journey. ,   J ,I52    The- Sisters of Orleans. After some searching in the darkness, an abandoned cabin was found, the hut of an absent hunter or wood- chopper, windowless and- doorless, but it was their only hope of shelter for the night. Their horses -kere accord- ingly secured to branches of trees outside, and the weary, heart-sick fugitives entered the miserable hovel. The first step was to secure a light. This was accom- plished by igniting a pile of sticks which had been col- lected in the cabin's fire-place. As the flames leaped up- ward, they spread a deceptive cheerfulness throughout the desolate room, and even infused a gleam of comfort into the hearts of the weary travellers, as they looked lover-like into each other's eyes. Little did they think of the betrayal that agreeable, but treacherous, light, as it flashed in long lines through the many openings in the cabin's walls, and shot far into the forest's recesses, might make of their whereabouts, and the danger it was liable at any moment to bring upon them. For a time they quite forgot their depression, their fatigue, their peril. They talked of France, and the home they would have where no slave-holder's claim could interrupt their fap- piness. Solorgne boasted of his triumph in introducing a bride, whose beauty would make her the leader of fash- ion, and him the envy of all his companions.' But de- lightful as such anticipations were, the necessities of the terrible present, and the prospect of the equally terrible morrow, could not be wholly ignored. The morning's struggle was before them, and they needed all the strength that rest could give. With their saddles'for pil- lows, -and masses of drifted leaves, which the wind had collected about the cabin, for beds, they stretched them- selves upon the earthen floor, and for the first timereal- ized in sleep the sweets of absolute forgetfulness. How long unconsciousness had lasted, Solorgne had   The Flight and the Midniaht Duel.   153 no means of knowing, although it was past the hour of midnight when he was aroused in the midst of a dream which had carried him back to France, and, with Isabella by his side, surrounded him with the smiling countenan- ces of his friends. He was not long, however, in discov- ering that other parties than those of his vision were present. Ruide hands were upon him, and a clearer re- alization of the situation showed-that two athletic Afri- cans had raised him to his feet, and were firmly holding him, while a third was binding his hands behind his back. Nor was he long in discovering that a fourth person was present, whom a glance showed to be Grandaville. Stand- ing where the light from the dying embers in the fire- place, the same which had betrayed the fugitives to their pursuers, was flashing across his countenance, disclosing a grim, malignant smile of exultation, Solorgne's former friend and Isabella's master stood, with .folded arms, silently gazing upon his prisoner. Their eyes met, and for a time neither abated the intensity of his look. So- lorgne, however weak his general character, was impul- sively brave, and, unaffected by any consciousness of guilt, his first emotion was indignation, not fear of the man who was exulting over his helplessness. In such a contest he was the superior of the two. Grandaville was not long in discovering the advantage his adversary possessed, and put an end to it by ordering the negroes -to lead their prisoner into th open air. There was a small cleared space in front of the cabin, and there the two men again met face to face. Cocking a pistol, and presenting it to Solorgne's head, almost within touching distance, with a bitter sneer Grandaville -began :. "And this is the way, Edmund. Solorgne, you repay my friendship. You avail yourselfW'of my courtesy to gain   ,                  ,       :I54     r7ie Sisters of Orleans. admission. to my house, and then steal my property. Scoundrel, thief, your hour has come!" : The reply was deliberate and intensely irritating. "Friendship! is that what you call coming upon a man in his sleep, binding-his hands, and then presenting a pistol to his head? You do well to talk of courtesy, Rty Grandaville. You can take my life, if you choose, because it is in your power; but your accusation against me is false. You voluntarily brought me into the pres- ence of a woman whose charms were irresistible; a wo- man whom you deprived of the liberty which makes life worth having, and held merely for the gratification of-an -unlicensed passion. 'I was not adamant, and a spectacle of such loveliness, united to such distress, awakened a sentiment stronger than friendship, stronger than cour- esy. It was love, an honest, manly love, which led me to attempt' your victim's rescue from your cruel, brutal power." "She was my slave." A  provoking smile played over the features of the shackled man, as he saw how he had driven his opponent to the defensive, and, he hastened to press his advantage. "Yodur slave! butt your slave had beauty which fitted her for a court,; she had accomplishments which would have made her the idol of society; she had a heart which qualified her to be an honest, honorable man's wife. She. was one to be loved, truly, generously loved. And yet, because you had the law. on your side, you chose to-hold : her in a low, debasing servitude, making her the play- thing of your lusts. I saw her not as your slave, but as a woman---a pure, beautiful, suffering woman-; and I should have been all you call me, and worse, had I made :po effort to wrest her from your polluting, cowardly " "Villain.! enough by " hoarsely interrupted Gran.   The Flight and the Midniht Duel.   155 daville, now fairly beside himself with rage ; and another moment would have ended Solorgne's earthly career for- ever, had not, at that instant, a hand been laid upon the out-stretched arm of the impetuous man, and a soft, but emphatic, voice sounded in his ear: "Stop!" It is needless to say that the speaker was Isabella, who, at that moment emerging from the cabin, had at a glance taken in the whole scene. "You claim to be a man of honor, of courage, Ruy Grandaville," she went on, when she saw that her inter- ference had been in .time, "and yet you would kill a man unarmed, with his hands bound, without the power to strike a blow. For shame! Ruy Grandaville, for shame!"           . ' You are right," responded Grandaville, whose ebul- lition of ungovernable fury had by this time partially subsided. , "You are right. It would be the act of a coward. He shall have a chance, thief, scoundrel, as he is. Here, Caesar, unbind this man's hands." Then, as soon as the prisoner's arms were free, taking the companion to- the pistol he held in his hand from his belt, and cocking it, Grandaville handed it to Solorgne. "Here, take that," he said, " and let us settle this matter in a way that nobody can say is unfair. Caesar, measure off ten paces." The imperturbable negro. coolly stepped the specified distance, as directed. "Now, sir, take your place at one end of the measure- ment; I shall take the other." Solorgne quietly obeyed.   '           - "And you, Madam," continued the speaker, turning to  Isabella, " as you have been the cause of the quarrel, and are to be the prize of victory to whichever survive- :;   ; I56     The Sisters of Orleans. you have your part to perform in this affair. You shall take your stand there," pointing to a position a little to one side of a direct line between himself and Solorgne, "and give the word to fire." -Isabella moved to the point indicated. "Now then," Grandaville went on, addressing her, "when we ;are readly, you shall repeat the words, 'One- Two-Three,' and at the word 'Three, either shall be at liberty to fire as soon he chooses. Ho, there, you fel- lows i get us some'light, so that we can see to transact this business with some kind of certainty and order." The negroes, to whom the last command was addressed, hastened to strip some dry bark from a fallen tree near by, and, having kindled at the fire in the cabin the great torches they made, two of them, with the blazing bundles in their hands, took their stations a few steps from the principal actors. . As the flames rolled up into the air, the light fell upon the waiting duellists, bringing out each line and expression of visage as clearly as if it had been in the broad light of:day. A look of settled defiance wras the challenge each countenance bore. Everything was ready. Within the circle lit up bythe blazing bark, every object:was painfully distinct. Beyond, - thei gloom was doubly intense. Overhead, the branches of the nearest trees, half in the light and half in the :  shadow, hung silently like the wings of great monsters toverlooking the scene, and breathlessly waiting for the tragedy to begin. Far away above, through a rent in the ' '-tree tops, a: narrow strip of sky, set with brilliant stars,  was to be seen'; but the principal parties to that awful tableau looked not above them. They apparently thought ;-- not of Heaven. Each watched the other's countenance, : ::^ ::as they stood with pistols half advanced in their hands :    gleaming in the light, with a sullen scowl which told   The Flight and the Midnzight Duel.   I57 only too plainly how resolutely their minds were fixed upon the murderous work before them. The stillness of the hour was terrible. They waited nothing now but the signal for action. And Isabella, what was her bearing in that terrible ordeal? It might have been the reflection of the light, but every particle of color seemedr to- have fled from her face. Nevertheless, she gave no sign of faltering. Once she turned- her eyes upward, as if asking for strength, but whatever her thoughts, she was given littleVpace for their indulgence. "Ready," said Grandaville firmly. "' Ready," as firmly responded Solorgne. Isabella's part in the drama was reached. Somewhat tremulously, but distinctly, she began: "One."  Two."  C Three." The last word was lost in the .crash of two pistols, so simultaneously discharged that they seemed to give but a single report. Grandaville stood firm and easy, his right hand sink- ing slowly to his side. Solorgne for a moment main- tained an erect posture, his arm with- the Smoking pistol"  still out-stretched, as if in bewilderment; then plunged heavily forward upon his face. A shriek rang ouit on the still night air, and Isabella was quickly bending over the fallen man. A minute went by ,without sign of life or motion in the prostrate form, when, at a word from GrandavilIe, a negro ad- vanced and turned the body so as to bring the face fully into the light of the torches. A convulsive tremor passed over it; the eyes seemed to rest with a brief glance of' recognition upon Isabella; as if a smile were strugging   158     .The Sisters of Orleans. to break through, and then settled into the fixed stare of death. Having pressed a long kiss upon the silent lips,: Isa- bella sank into a kneeling posture by the dead man's side, her face hidden in her hands. Here she remained like a statue, except by an occasional low sob, giving no indica- tion by sound or motion of the grief that was in her heart. "'Caesar," said Grandaville, speaking in a subdued tone, " mount your horse, and follow the road to the right. for about a mile, and you will come to a cabin. Rouse the proprietor, and tell him that Ruy Grandaville wants him here. At the same time get from him a couple of shovels and a mattock. Be off, and lose no time." While the negro was absent on his errand, Isabella never once changed her position, nor was a word spoken. Grandaville, with arms folded across his breast, occasion- ally walked softly backward and forward upon the grass in front of the cabin, but the greater portion of the time he stood as stationary as the mourner at the dead man's side. After the lapse of nearly an hour, CIesar returned on foot, carrying the tools his master had sent for, and riding the negro's horse was a white man, who proved to be Walker, the swamp-squatter. "Hullo, Granderville! yer here again? Glad ter see yer! Glad ter see yer!" shouted the new-comer, as he rode within speaking distance. Then, as his eye fell upon the dead man, and his mind seemed to take in something of the nature of the case, he added apologeti- cally, "I'm allers glad ter see yer, yer knows." "Shootin' somebody, has yer?" .he went on. "Ho! ho! I see how'tis," lihe proceeded, as he caught a sight- of Isabella. "Ben a-foolin' with one of yer niggers, the   Thze Flight and the Middioh t Duel. I59 villain! Served him right, Granderville! served him right! Well, well, spilt my eyes, if t'izzn't that :stranger feller from the country whar they hasn't got no slaves. Didn't 'ject ter take one when he could, though, ha! ha! Like all the other abelrlitioners. Not bad lookin' though; jist the kind of chap to play the devil with the wenches. They takes ter that sort like flies ter a honey-pot. The likes of us don't stand no chance when they're buzzin' 'bout, does we, Granderville? ha! a! ha!" "For God's sake, be quiet!" exclaimed Grandaville, putting an end to Walker's pleasantry. "What; neighbor, yer not troubled with 'punctiousness,' is yer, arter the job's done? I'm never huht in that way ,when I've killed anybody, an' I've spilled some blood in my time. I jist considers the thing's done, an' thar's an end on it. But I 'spect as now what yer wants is ter have the feller planted. He'll never be of no more 'count 'bove ground, that's sartin. So boys, thar's the tools  jist git ter work, an' we'll soon chuck him under.-"  The negroes thus addressed took up shovels and mat- tock, and in a slort time a shallow grave was in readi- ness. The body was lifted up and lowered into it, and the earth being shoveled back to its place, soon hid all that remained of Edmund Solorgne from mortal sight. Isabella had knelt at the head of the grave, as the work of interment was going on, weeping profoundly, but silently. But, when the last shovelful had been pressed down, she threw herself forward with a piercing cry, and touched her lips to the cold ground, retaining her pros- trate position, -No one interfered with her. Even, Walker took off his hat and stood silently by. It was for a few minutes only. Rousingherself, she again rested on her knees. At a sign from Grandaville her horse was brought for-,   I60      The Sisters of Orleans. ward, and, without protest on her part, she was assisted to the saddle. The others quickly mounted, and as the- first rays of the 'rising sun were touching the topmost branches of the forest, a quiet procession, led by Granda- &  ville, who was followed by the bowed form of Isabella, moved on through the fading darkness below, in the di- rection of the plantation.                    .   CHAPTER XVI. A LOVER'S PERPLEXITY. THE intelligent reader will experience little dif- ficulty in comprehending the chief induce- ment that made Charles Brown a party to the scenes at the oldoTriangle Building described in a previous chapter. His early trainting had something to do with it, undeniably. He was an Abolitionist, as the opposers of slavery on principle were opprobriously called, by education. His sympathy with a people whom he sincerely believed to be the subjects. of legal outrage and unreasonable prejudice, prepared him to labor cheer- fully in their behalf. But, at the same time, common sense taught him that the little benefit he could render a limited number of them by the course he was pursuing, was by no means commensurate with the personal risk he incurred. No one better understood the temper of the people among whom he was sojourning. He knew their inveterate hostility to any one, and-especially to a citizen of the North, who might presume to interfere be- ' tween them and the colored race. He was aware that, in assisting the slave-girl Rhoda to escape the custody of her master, he had violated a statute, the penalty of ,which was exceptionally severe. He felt that every hour he persevered in his Quixotic undertaking in connection with Miss Castellos, exposed him and her to increasing peril. All this was perfectly clear to his mind -a mind which had always been accustomed to reasoq closely fl   162     7Te Sisters of OrIains. upon every line of action it had contemplated; and yet he did persevere in a course which his cooler judgment told him was little better than madness. It is not to be supposed that he had ventured upon a policy so full of danger without a struggle, or that he ad" hered to it without serious misgivings. The process by which he had become involved, was simple enough. When Miss Castellos mentioned to him, and in that con- fidence which made the communication far more interest- ing, that she was giving instruction to certain colored children who were without other means of education, in the frame -of mind in' which several interviews with that young lady had left him, it was a very easy thing for him to offer his co-operation. Tlhe proposition was made without much reflection upon the possible consequences its acceptance might involve, beyond the increased op- portunity it would afford him for meeting a person whose society-he had found strangely attractive. He was not then in a mental condition to practice the same cautious- ness he would have ordinarily brought to bear upon so important a matter. Who in the first stages of a love attack ever is?  His: ,:ffer was accepted, and then, when he did begin :oison somewlvideliberately concerning the matter, iahid-: his judgment tld him of the utter impolicy of the step,. he felt that he had gone too far at once to recede. Honor was brought into the service of Love, and made to become the scape-goat for its follies. So he resolved to go ahead with the proposed undertaking, in good faith, as he expressed it to his own conscience, trusting that the arrangement would be of but brief continuance. Meanwhile, every possible precaution was adopted to in-  sure the safety of himself and of his coadjutor, The old Triangle Building was selected as the seat of opera- ol                      oea   A Lover's Perplerity.      i63 tions for very obvious reasons. There was no place in New Orleans where a considerable number of colored persons, old or young, could be brought together with less liability to discovery or suspicion. A room in the upper story, suitable' for the purpose, was obtained, and there, for several weeks, every second day, at a given hour, did Brown and Miss Castellos meet a certain number of colored youth for the purpose of imparting!, not only harmless, but useful; instruction. As for Brown's/associate in the, under the circumstan- ces, singular, if not fool-hardy work, she was not so situ- ated as to have a very clear realization of its risks. She wds a simple-hearted woman, to whom the task was purely a labor of love. Consulting her own feelings towards the unhappy blacks, she did not seriously con- sider the prejudices by which others in her- own station in life were controlled. .Had she even suspected the extent of the peril into which her influence was leading her New England friend, as well as herself, she would not for the world have consented to the part she was destined to play. But Isabella Castellos-for that was the name in full-was ignorant of two very important elements in the case. She did not understand the state of public feeling about her, and she did not know that Charles Brown, in his seemingly philanthropic labors, was actuated less by sympathy for the blacks than by love for her. Being, as will in due time appear, the only acknowledged child of a weak and doting father, flattered and petted by soci- ety, and accustomed to have her own way in pretty much all her inclinations, especially such as-were Of a charita- ble tendency, she did not stop to reflect upon the conse- quences which her erratic benevolence might bring upon herself and others. Supposing that Brown had properly weighed the liabilities, and was itn a temper to consider   J164     The Sisters of Orleans.: them fairly, she was disposed to trust such matters to his judgment, in which she had been led to place great con- fidenice. Thus it was that the Contraband School in the old Triangle Building- was opened, and for several weeks had pursued its uninterrupted course. The first sensation Charles Brown experienced in his labors was intense sat- isfaction. He was brought into almost daily communica- tion with the person who had excited the warmest interest he had ever felt in another. There was no love-making, it was true-nothing but occasional stolen glances of admiration, of which he would not for any consideration have had her conscious. It was, for the time, enough for him that they were in the same room, and engaged in the same work. For the time!-but unhappily that tinf was not to be of long continuance. Love is in its nature essentially aggressive. It never yet was entirely satisfied with any- thing short of full and absolute possession. Brown soon found to his sorrow, that distant worship was not enough to satisfy his heart's cravings. He discovered that he had become another Tantalus, dwelling in sight of pleas- ures beyond his reach, and which he knew not how to ap- proach. Clear-headed as he naturally was, he was not long in ascertaining that he -had become involved in two great perils. To the danger from a surrounding slave-holding com- munity to which he was hourly exposed, was added one of which he was far-more keenly susceptible-that to his -peace' of mind. He began to realize how trying it was to be misunderstood. While willing to be credited with a fair share of philanthropy, he would have greatly 'peferred that Miss Castellos had accepted a portion "?,:Mf the sacrifice he was making, as a tribute to herself. * t-    A Lover's Perplexity.     165 Not that, by word or deed, he would have avowed such a thing; but he was disappointed that she showed no recognition of the fact. What is so irksome as a want of appreciation on the part of those whom we esteem? He was chagrined, too, for that, while he could not be- insensible that his -regard for his co-laborer was grow- ing more and more decided, she seemed to undergo no change of sentiment towards him. Her manner was the - same from day to day, always pleasant, always fascina- ting, but showing no growth, no increase of warmth or interest. Were not his society and his sacrifices de- serving of something better? he began to ask himself. It was time, he thought with a lover's impatience, and possibly with a lover's unreasonableness, that the qual- ities he believed himself to possess-should be making some impression--his zeal be meeting with some return. It must not be supposed that, during all this time, he was an unresisting victim to the infatuation that had come over him-that he had no desire for emancipation. Again and again did he discuss the whole matter in his own mind, and again and again did he acknowledge the blindness and folly of his course. Not only that, but he resolved time -and again to set himself free, as far as pos- sible, by removing himself beyond the range of immedi- ate temptation. The difficulty was not in deciding upon what he ought to do-his mind was clear enough upon that point-but in the policy he adopted to effect his deliverance. To diminish the pain of separation from . the loved object, he set about the endeavor to convince x himself, by a process of reasoning, that Miss Castellos was, in some way, unworthy of the adoration- she had inspired. This led to a review of her character, her- merits and demerits, in the hope of finding some assail-   66      Te Sisters of Orleans. 'able point, some unlovely traitS There was the secret of defeat. Such reviews are always fatal to doubting hearts. They invariably result in bringing the superior qualities of the one considered into greater prominence. Such was Brown's experience. He could find defects in Miss Castellos' character, but he at the same time discovered greater beauties. While he condemned her for a lack of feeling and appreciation towards himself, he was led to a fuller acknowledgment of her noble and generous efforts in-behalf of the poor, unappreciated negro. Whenever he undertook to pronounce judgment against her, his imagination carried him away to the low and gloomy school-room in the Triangle Building, and showed the gentle and high-born lady condescending to labor for, and with, the unfortunate ones whom others sought only to degrade and oppress. The picture was fatal to all his endeavors. Each such struggle left him .worse entangled than before. He-could only conclude to delay his final decision until another, and possibly more favorable, oc- casion.  Thus did the strife and bitterness, the danger and the sacrifice, go on.        ! Another circumstance added to Brown's embarrass- ment. He had been led to inquire closely into the char- acter of the man whom  report assigned as Miss Castel- los' prospective husband. The result was most disheart- ening.     . -            . ,The world spoke well of Grandaville, of his birth and fortune, of his social qualities and his chivalric bearing; but, penetrating a superficial favoritism, Brown became convinced from the actual facts of his life, that the man was false and corrupted, possessing those traits of extrav-. agance and libertinism which a New Englander's educa- -tioh taught him to regard with special repugnance. "        ,   A Lover's Perplexity.      167 He had learned, too, the'truth concerning Solorgne and his unhappy fate. From the statements publicly made, that affair had only increased Grandaville's popu- larity. All the world knew, or cared to know, was that he had killed a man engaged in an attempt to rob him of one of his slaves. The act was loudly applauded. It was a manly vindication, said a slave-holding public sen- timent, of the right of property, and a warning to others alike evilly disposed. But to Brown, who had traced all the circumstances by which a friend had lost his life at the hands of a friend when engaged in a generous and honorable act, the transaction wore-a very different as-. pect. But what was he to do in consequence of this knowl- edge? He did not even know that there was ground for the rumored engagement between Grandaville and Miss Castellos. She had never alluded to the subject in his presence ; and, if the' statement were correct, he felt that under the circumstances his lips were sealed. He could/ not speak to her upon a subject so delicate, without the: liability of his motive being misconstrued-without thfe secret of his heart being laid bare. She might be stand- ing upon the brink of a precipice, and yet, as matters were, he could do nothing to save her. There was only one thing he could see within his power to do, and that was to wait and watch. The pos- sibility that, something might transpire, which would make his presence of service to the woman he loved, seemed a sufficient pretext for that course. He could dream, but scarcely hope for anything beyond and still more consonant with his wishes. In order that he might be near Miss Castellos, in case the emergency he con- templated should arise, he deemed it best, while he re- mained in New Orleans, that the school in the old Tri-   - I68     The Sisters of Orleans. ang!e Building should go on, even at the risk it imposed. So, while Maxwell Wondered, and his mother in his old New England home was fretting and sorrowing over the absence of the son' she loved, he was dwelling beneath the shadow of a great danger and a great unhappiness. ,   - - ,'               ' ,   CHAPTER XVIT. END OF SUSPENSE. I'  MPENETRABLE as seemed the gloom by which Charles was surrounded, there was at least to be some intermission to the darkness. S -^Q Unexpectedly appeared a rent in the cloud through which he thought he saw the bright sunshine beyond. After the pupils had been dismissed, at the conclusion of one of the sessions in the old Triangle Building, a casual conversation sprang up between the two teachers, which happened to turn upon the moral question of hold- ing slaves. Prompted by a motive which the reader can more easily penetrate than could his companion at the time, Brown advanced the opinion, that the act of retain- ing an ignorant, degraded race in involuntary subjection, might be tolerated, provided all masters and mistresses would labor for their improvement as Miss Castellos was doing. Abstractly he did not believe the doctrine, but so candid did he appear in its expression, and ,so little had he been given to anything resembling flattery, that his companion supposed him to be entirely sincere. "I cannot altogether agree with you," -she replied. ' You and I might suppose we were laboring for the best interest of the slave, but of that who has the right to judge? If left to his own government, he might see fit to pursue a very different course. When both are liable to err, why should his judgement be ignored, and ours alone be consulted? If he had the power, he might en-   I70      The Sisters of Orleans. slave us under -the same argument, and be just as -hon- i est-according to his light. In that case we would prob- ably think the doctrine a very hard one. The trouble -would- seem- to be. that when we interfere with free- dom -of action in any one, and thus destroy individual - responsibility, there is no fixed limit to the power as- sumed. Is not the difficulty in the system itself, and the error a fundamental one?" "I acknowledge myself vanquished," replied Charles - laughingly " partly because I believe you are right, and partly because I am unwilling to be placed in the seeming attitudeof a defender of anything I so thoroughly detest as- negro slavery, under .any circumstances. But what -'appears marvellous, is to hear such an argument from the - !Jps of one who, if I am not misinformed, is herself the downer of a considerable number of slaves." "Your information is correct," rejoined Miss Castel- los; " at-the same time you are wrong in your inference.  :W hilje it is true that I am the legal owner of slaves, it is -?at .the same time the fact, that the title came to me by the -bequest of a relative, which imposes a condition that at present ties my hands.

By that time he trusted }amore:sefish code would regulate my actions.

The truth is, , ,hat ;th opint he was desirous of reaching, was one that (topthim was of the very highest interest, although ;he   End of Suspeense.      I7L sought to approach it in a way that would indicate indif- ference. Before his embarrassment had become obvious, he determined to proceed in the manner that his mind had first suggested. "But suppose that, before the time you speak of, you should be married. Your husband, who would then be entitled to a voice in the matter, might not share in your very liberal views." If Miss Castellos discovered anything, either in her companion's suggestion, or in the manner in which it was spoken, that indicated a more than ordinary inter- est in the subject on the speaker's part, she carefully con- cealed all evidence of such knowledge. With perfect calmness she replied to his observation: "I shall not marry, except upon -an understanding to be supported in such manner, legally, as will precludeethe 'possibility of failure, that my pleasure in that regard shall prevail." There was not much in these words for Brown to build a hope upon. Yet, in his despondency, they operated -almost like magic. Perhaps others similarly situated have even built extravagant theories upon less support. He pondered over them for hours, and the longer he con' sidered them, the more he discovered favorable to his -wishes. It was clear, he argued, that she was not yet positively affianced to any one, because she spoke of a contingency in connection with any marriage engagement she might form  as a thing of the future. There was a condition, too, involved, which would be an impediment, more or less serious, to any such engagement:with a pro- slavery man like Ruy Grandaville. The only one from whom, she could look for agreement in the importast matter of disposing of her property, was an abolifionift 'like himself. Thus did his mind run on, leading from :one inference to, another inference, from ne fancy to Inference,     'N- - '..   !

He began to raise airy castles, vhich it is easy to imagine the principal occupants. i idea of returning td his old home, to astonish his :her with a Southern bride, suggested a picture that d: no limited space in his thoughts. The delight ch he and his wife--yes, his wife--would experience giving a goodly number of their fellow-beings their dom, and listening to their words of thankfulness for great a boon, furnished the ground-work ifor another ansive fancy painting. He seriously contemplated- er, practical man as he was---the reality of such Ims. Whether he should not, the very next time he  Miss Castellos, declare his feelings, and so put an to suspense, was a question he earnestly debated.; did not know what to conclude upon.  But while t point remained unsettled, he contrived to live in the osphere of a beatific vision until his next meeting I his fellow-teacher at the school room, and then- 'then he was awakened to the truth of his crowning low. Ihile the'ordinary exercises of the school-room were ng forward, he noticed, or thought he did, that his ipanion appeared unusually depressed, as if a weight e resting upon her mind. An apprehension which he Id not account for, as a consequence of that impres- i, forced its way into his own thoughts. Anxiously he dted the coming interview. All doubt was speedily red.

I3 who was about to become her husband did not, she re- gretted to say, sympathise. in her views concerning the - elevation of the colored race. Hence it would be unwise for her to continue personally in the work. She hoped it would not lose anything by her withdrawal. Her sympa- thy and her assistance, as far as it would be in her power to give the latter, would still be continued. She had not contemplated anything so sudden; but the engagement she was about to fulfill was of long standing, existing, in fact, from the time of her childhood. Others were urging  speedy action.- The gentleman she was about to marry, although a strong pro-slavery man, had generously con- sented that she'should direct the liberation of her sla ves as she saw fit, and had voluntarily prepared and executed a legal instrument placing that matter under her own control. She would, at the next meeting, announce her purpose to their scholars, but she: thought it right that she should first make it known to her co-worker. Brown was confounded.  He could make no reply, and the interview, which was manifestly painful to both, was speedily brought to an end. "Fool! fool! fool!" he exclaimed, as soon as he was by himself. Then a feeling of indignation came over him. It seemed to him as it he had, in some way, been made the dupe. of a heartless designer. It never entered his thoughts that Miss Castellos might herself be the victim'of cruel deception; that her ratification of a mar- i. riage agreement might have been secured by a craftily - : studied fraud.          - The feeling spoken of was of service in enabling him  to take a more rational view of the situation.

GATHERING OF THE STORM. ^  ^--.- HE dav on which Charles Brown sadly took ,    ' ^^"^his way, for the last time, to the school-room  in the Triangle Building, in pursuance of the  resolution he had formed, as stated in the last chapter, was destined to be made memorable in the his- tory of New Orleans, in consequence of the following , ! announcement which occupied a prominent place in the city journals of that morning: '  PUBLIC MEETING. , "PROPERTY AND LIFE IN DANGER I     -.  "All citizens solicitous for the public peace, and inter- ! ested in the security of private property, are earnestly - invited to meet this day, at 12 o'clock, at Palmetto Square. The purpose of the call will then and there be . more fully explained. It is enough, for the present, to state that evil-disposed persons are in our midst, and that their machinations threaten the integrity of our prin-  cipal institution, and with it, life 'and property. Come, one! Come all!" lXo name was appended to the call, but that circum- stance, as it increased the mystery of the movement,  secured for it a more general discussion. To add to the excitement produced by the notice, nearly all the journals :  publishing it contained editorial articles of a violent-and - inflammatory chatacter.                 : One, in discussing the leading topic of the day, spoke ? ; :. r * * * Z  ;  ,    1 76  Th  e 7%istes of Orleanss. -of slavery as "the corner-stone of the State,' the chief :ornament of the; Church, and the main pillar of the social fabric of the South." o No one must 'be suffered," declared another, "where we have the power to prevent it, to assail an institu- tion which is the soul of our entire industrial system. vlspecially must it not be in New Orleans, the com- meirial emporium 'and metropolis of the South. Its ,people owe it to themselves to see that/the reputation of their city for fidelity-to Southern interests receives no stain." -Another, more specific in its charges, announced that, '-It has, of late, been. noticed that servants have been growing alarmingly insubordinate, and that escapes from, their masters have been of almost daily occurrence. It is reported'-that Northern Abolitionists are at the bottom of the trouble.

Such appeals, in the then excited state of the public mind, owing to the acrimonious discussions that were going forward upon the Slavery question, both 'in the . Northern and Southern States, could have but one effect. At the time and place named for the meeting, a large and earnest concourse of people had assembled. No one appeared to know from whom the call which had brought. them together had come, nor the grounds upon which-it was issued; but all concurred in the opinion that it had/i relation to movements on foot among the'enemies of sla- very, and that there was real 'danger to the community. Stories of threatened negro insurrection and of outside interference with slaves, starting from mere expressions of opinion in the first instance'; from circumstances of little or no consequence inx-themselves; or from no trace- able source whatever, rapidly spread' throughout' the , assembly and found plenty of believers. Great excite- ment was the result. Loud denunciations of all aboli- tionists, and especially of Such parties as were suspected of. instigating negro conspiracies, were heard on every- side. All classes were represented. The wealthy slave- holder and the poorest day-laborer were alike intent upon ferreting out the commod enemy,-as the adversary of slavery was held, to be, and bringing him to speedy ' punishment.  Precisely at the" hour of twelve, some one made him- r  ' self heard with a proposition that the mayor of the 'city  should preside over the meeting. A general expression  of approval followed. That functionary, being p"resent' :' thanked the. multitude for the compliment it had, paid  him; declared his ignorance of the immediate objectthat had brought so many" ofithe people together, butt ex-i  (        '-   178      The Sisters of Orlekas. pressed the belief that there must be some sufficient cause for the agitation that prevailed; and closed by avowing his desire to serve the public to the utmost of his ability. No sooner had the mayor taken his seat, than a call was made by some one upon a local politician of pron-  inence and popularity, who was seen to be present. The name once mentioned, was taken up by the assembly, and clamorously repeated. The individual thus honored, ia never averse Ito acquiring notoriety and giving expression to his views, came forward with well-feigned reluctance. He confessed that he did not understand the particular fants which they had been called together to consider, but expressed himself as fully sharing the common feel- ing, that there was an evil which called fr prontpt and idecisive laction and thence he proceede in a nManner which, from- long practice, he thoroughly understood, to play upon the passions and apprehensions of his audi- ence, and arouse them to the highest state of excitement. At the same time that he was ministering to their fears, he flattered their vanity, by entering upon an eloquent vindication of the institution of Slavery. He argued that A - it had been of incalculable advantage to the negro, in bringing him from barbarism to civilization, and extolled its benefits to the dominant race. Its practical working, wherever it-had prevailed, he said, had been to make men brave and women virtuous.  It had developed a higher social grade than was anywhere else to be found. A contemipt for small things, a tenacious regard for per- sonal honor, and a chivalrous respect for the weaker sex, were its legitimate results. The Southern gentleman, under its elevating and refining influence, was without a peer, and his wife and -daughter, relieved of the drudgery of domestic toil, became his fitting companions, and the brijatest ornaments of-society at home or abroad.   j' : Gat/zering of the Storm.   I79 By way of contrast, the speaker drew a satirical pic- ture of the New Englander in his Northern home. The Yankee, he said, was never so happy as when looking after other people's business. He kept his wife and daughters in the kitchen, and preached against a system which' would promote them to the parlor, He was relig- iously opposed to enslaving negroes, and so made ser- vants of his own flesh and blood. His ideas were narrow I and bigoted, and yet he was forever thrusting them in other people's faces. He was jealous of Southern supe- riority, and so wanted, to rob the South of the principal element of its financial and social wealth, which he was l, i , endeavoring to do upon the hypocritical pretence of an enlarged philanthrqphy. i'      "Such 'are the men," continued the orator, "who con-l ceive it to be a Christian duty to send missionaries among us, to teach the white master to elevate his slave to an equality with himself, while they are educating the negro in a code of hatred and insubordination that will prepare him to cut his master's throat." Other speakers followed in a similar strain; but while the multitude was freely entertained, and .roused to an equal pitch of indignation and enthusiasm, no practical result seemed likely to follow. While matters were in this condition, an eloquent speaker having just concluded his remarks, the mayor, as presiding officer of the meet- ing, arose and stated to the audience, that he was about to, introduce to them a representative of a name honora- ble in the city's annals, and a gentleman who, by reason of his own worth and social position, was entitled to be heard with more than ordinary deference. The person referred to, upon coming forward, was greeted with a hearty burst of applause. He was Ruy Grandaville. Unlike his predecessors, Grandaville attempted no   18o      The Sisters of Orleans. oratorical display. His words were few, but delivered with unusual emphasis. "Fellow citizens," said he, "I have come here, not to speak, but to act. Either let us go home, or do the work that has called us together. If there are enemies to our institutions among us, let us final them and having found them, let us adopt- the shortest method of dispos- ing of them. Abolitionists and ourselves cannot remain in the same community. Either they must be destroyed, - or we shall be. The first question, therefore, is: Are there Abolitionists among us? and the next, if the answer be, Yes: Who and where are they? I do not propose to take up your time, but call upon any one present pos- sessed of information upon those points, to come forward-) and state it." The speaker here folded his arms and remained silent, while the audience, already beginning to weary of much speaking, greeted his proposition with hearty applause. Then there was silence to see if any one would respond to Grandaville's call. Intense was the excitement when, some distance back- in the midst of the assembly, a person was discovered pressing forward as if in answer to the demand for infor- mation just made. Unable to make his way through the dense throng with a rapidity equal to the anxiety of those about him, he was suddenly lifted up, and borne forward above the heads of the intervening mass, to the speaker's stand. , There, as he turned his face confidently to the audience, he was seen to be a young man, whose stylish dress and abundant jewelry, quite as much as his manner, showed him to belong to the class of fast men of which every Southern city, at that day, possessed so many rep- resentatives. Of the facts he had to state, the reader is already ,artially advised; for he was the master of   Gathering of ,the Stotm.     18I Rhoda, thteslave-girl, whose history, as it came from her own lips, had so deeply impressed both harles Brown and Miss Castellos. The tale he told was quite a different story. He was the owner of a slave, a female, whom he had always treated with the grcatest indulgence, and who, for a long time, had given no evidence of discontent. All at once, however, the manner of his servant changed. She be- came sullen, restless and disobedient. He had endeav- ored, by' increased kindness, to reconcile her to her con- dition. It was in vain ; for suddenly she disappeared, and with all his efforts, he had-been unable to find her. He had instituted an investigation, however, and the result was the discovery of a state of things which fully explained the mystery. He had ascertained that there was a place in the city where blacks and whites were ac- customed regularly to meet. The object, of course, was to concoct treason against their institutions, if not con- spiracy against their lives. He had learned that a New Englander, recently arrived in the city, was the leader in these gatherings. To the place where the meetings were held he had traced his slave, but beyond that point he could get no information. "I have positive assurance," continued the speaker, " that the conspirators to whom I owe the loss of my property, are, at this very hour, as- sembled at the place to which I have alluded." At this point the audience, which had been wrought up to an intense degree of feeling as the speaker proceeded, burst forth into a clamorous, demand for the name of the locality to which he referred, intermingled with oaths and dire theats of violence towards the hated Abolitionists. As soon as order was sufficiently restored for his voice to be heard, the speaker bent forward and announced a name which operated like magic on the assembly.

SO absorbed was Charles Brown with his own bitter reflections, and so busy with the-prep- arations he- was making for hs expected journey Northward, that he paid no attention to what was going on about him. On the day he was resolved to make his last appearance in the old Trian- gle Building, he did not so much as look at a news- paper. Had he done so, a very different result might have followed. But as it was, at the usual hour of meet- ing Miss Castellos and their pupils, he set. out for the school-room totally unconscious of any disturbaince in the community around him, and without athought of the storm that was soon to burst upon his head. As he. entered the room, he/bowed coldly' :toMiss:Cas- tellos, who had arrived before him, and took iis accus- tomed seat with as much ap: rentid:ueOtcemr as:i :there was nothing unusual' in the .occasion. :He.:had nerved - himself to this seeming indiffer'enXceIwith he dlibertly-  for'ed resolution that his co-laborer should knowith h- o ing of the suffering of which she was the cause.'

Nevertheless, he could not restrain himself from cast- ing an occasional glance in the direction of his fellow- instructor, as she proceeded with her duties, severe as was the pang it gave him, and trying as it was to the res- olution he had formed. More than once he thought he detected her in the actl of brushing away a tear, and her cheek certainly wore a hue of unusual pallor. The st rug- gle was not all on one side. As for Brown himself, he went on with his labors mechanically, only anxious for the trial to be over. At last, greatly to his relief, the hour for dismissing the scholars arrived. Then, however, was to begin a scene quite new to that quiet room. Miss Castellos, with as much firmness as she could command, attempted to'ex- plain to the children present the purpose she had already announced to Brown. It was not at once possible for the hearers to realize the fact that they were to be separated from their be- loved teacher. When, however, the sad truth did pene- trate their minds, there was at first a painful silence, as if their surprise was too profound for utterance; then a wail was heard, low at first, but quickly swelling into a general burst of grief; and then, all restraint giving way, they left their seats and crowded round Miss Cas- tellos, kneeling, kissing her hands, and testifying, accord- ing to the impulse of the froment, the emotions by which their bosoms were filled. Not the least affected of those present was Brown. With his own sharp sorrow gnaw- ing at his heart,'it was impossible for him to remain an unmoved spectator of such a scene. It was with diffi- culty that he refrained from casting himself down among the weeping children before Miss Castellos, and join- ing his prayer with theirs, that she should reconsider her resolution, and that they might continue the pleas-   Thze Mob.       '1- i 85 ant, although perilous, labor in which they had been engaged. Into what indiscretion he might have been led it is impossible to tell, had not his attention at that moment been diverted by other sounds that rose even above the sobbing and entreaties of the wailing scholars. It seemed as if a multitude of feet were gradually coming nearer and nearer, while the voices of angry men were mingling hoarsely in the strange uproar. Sensitive to the sugges- tion of danger, from a consciousness of the hazard they had been provoking, Brown hastened to the nearest window, and there a spectacle met his eyes that almost froze the blood in his veins.  Down a street leading dir'tly to the old Triangle Building was pouring a dense body of men, fiercely shouting and gesticulating as they came. Brown could not distinguish what they said, but he needed no such knowledge to give-him warning of their purpose. He realized the danger at once; but was it not already too late to escape it? Almost before he had sufficiently recov- ered from the shock to give a thought to the situation, the leaders of the mob had reached the street in front of the Triangle, and there paused as their eyes ran over the building, in doubt what next to do. The delay was but momentary. The multitude behind pressed on, and the accumulatingr mass swept round the building, completely investing it. Other sounds began to be heard.: Cries, of women and children arose, and pretty soon the heavy tramp of many feet upon the stairways and floors of the old house became audible. Brown comprehended -,that, whatever was to be done, no time was to -be lost. Turning to Miss Castellos and 'her companions, whose safety was his first thought, and who, having caught the unusual sounds that filled the air, ^si si " " *.; '. " - .. * ' i. - , ^ ',  '  ,   1 86'     The Sisters of Orleans. had sunk into breathless silence, tremblingly awaiting the solution of the mystery; he exclaimed-- "  Fly, fly! we are discovered-mobbed!" The youngest in that little assembly knew perfectly the meaning of those words, so familiar were the negroes' minds with the idea of violence. But where were they to fly? Already footsteps. were heard approaching their retreat. All escape seemed to be cut off. A few mo- ments more and the mob would be upon them. Reso- lutely, Miss iCastellos arose, and approached the door by which the sound of footsteps showed their enemies were about to enter, thus placing herself between the children and the threatened danger. The next moment the door flew open, and strange men stood confronting her. The foremost, a young man, flushed and excited, but with something of the look and bearing of the gentleman, stopped short as his eyes met hers. "I-I beg pardon. We were looking for Abolitionists!" and with that the speaker instinctively and unconsciously lifted his hat. ' This unexpected interruption checked the crowd be- hind, but the delay was for a moment only. A burly, hard-visaged ruffian, perceiving the cause of detention, pushed- past his leader, and with a boast that he 'was not afraid of a petticoat, laid his hand rudely upon Miss Castellos' shoulder to shove her aside. Scarcely had his hand come in contact with her person, before a lusty blow sent him reeling backward among his companions. Brqwn's strength- and activity made him no indifferent boxer, as the effect of this demonstration showed. The fall of their new leader again staggered the intru- ders. Brown, now thoroughly aroused, was prompt to avail himself of'the delay. Calling upon Miss Castellos land the children to fly by the other passage to the room, ^ - - H-*-*  ^ -"-  .--^-   The Mob.         I87 which so far appeared not to have been discovered by the mob, he wrenched a leg from a stool that happened to be near, making a bludgeon by no means inoffensive in the hand of a resolute man, and thus, formidably armed, took his position in front of the door to dispute its passage. The doorway was narrow, only wide enough for two persons to enter at a time, and they not without impeding each other; so that the odds he would have ,to meet was not so great after all., With his club upraised, Charles and his nearest adver- saries stood face to face, exchanging looks of mutual hatred. It was evident that the latter shrank from the attack'; but it was not possible that one-man should long hold a multitude at bay. "Down with the Abolitionist!" came 'from those standing further baclq and who, pressing forward, forced those in advance to begin the assault. There was a rush, and the twomen composing-the first rank went down like beeves. The next two shared the same fate. Their im- mediate successors, seeing the fall of their leaders, panic stricken, pressed back with such energy that the crowd behind was forced for a moment to recede, and the New Englander, for the time. remained master of the situation. "A pistol!" shouted one. "Shoot him!" "Shoot him!" screamed half a hun- dred voices at once. These exclamations convinced Brown that the attack was about to be renewed, and in a form to which he could make no successful resistance. Whatever was to be done, therfore, had to be on the instant. Casting a glance about him,-he saw that Miss Castellos and the children had, by this time, passed out of the room by the other passage, and to remain where he was, would be simply to defend an empty apartment. His resolution,  :     I       .  ' )   - .   188     The Sisters of Orleans. accordingly, was quickly formed and acted upon. Sweep- ing his club in the faces of his adversaries, he sprang backward, and, rapidly crossing the room, passed through the opposite door which he closed behind him. In rushed the mob, and, as he had calculated, led by curiosity to in- spect the Abolitionist's den, they scattered through the room, overturning desks and benches, and destroying books, papers and everything they could lay hands on. In this way, valuable time was gained by Brown. The attention of fiis pursuers, however, was in this 'manner not to be long diverted. Nevertheless, something had been secured. Seeing that Miss Castellos and her companions in flight had effected their escape, either from the building, or into rooms leading from the' halls below, and, by mingling with the general throng, had a chance of avoiding detection, nothing now remained for him but to think of his own safety. He knew that if once in the crowd outside of the building, his identifica- tion .would be almost an impossibility, and he could easily baffle his enemies. To accomplish that, it was nec- essary for him to descend three flights of stairs, and to pass to the street door of the lower story, without detec- tion from below. It was his only hope. Pausing only  long enough to satisfy himself that the mob had not yet found that passage from the street, he dashed down the stairs, and had reached the head of the last flight before the pursuit was- resumed above. A few seconds more, and he would be out of the building and in safety; when, with a crash, open flew the street door, and in rushed a portion of the mob, filling the hall below. He was now between two bodies of his enemies, one cutting off his re- treat, and the other closing rapidly in behind him. He knew not what to do ; but as he looked despairingly about him, his eyes fell upon what. appeared to be a narrow   Thze Mob.         89 passage leading at right angles from the hall in which he was standing, being upon the second floor of the build- ing. He sprang to it, without knowing Iwhere it would take him; when, to his dismay, le discovered that only a few feet from the entrance it was cut off by a door, and that door was securely locked or bolted, All his strength was not sufficient to .force it open. He was in a trap; but a glance about him told him that even that trap might be of service in his defence. Standing where he wasy in that narrow passage, he could only be assailed in front. He was resolved to sell his life as dearly as possi- ble, and here he could meet his adversaries upon some- thing like equal terms, becaus e ly. a limited number could reach him at once. He had barely time to note these points, and place his back to the door that stopped his progress, when his ene- mies were upon him. Thefirst comers paid dearly for their temerity i but it was not possible that such an un- equal contest could be of long duration. Twice- had Brown been beaten down, and his club had been wrenched from him. For the third time, covered with blood--and nearly exhausted in strength, he had struggled to his feet, and renewed the conflict with his naked hands; when, standing upon the stairway, so as to be-above both him- self and those immediately pressing upon him, he saw some one deliberately aiming a pistol at his breast. The sight afforded him a sense of relief, promising, as it did, escape from a lingering and painful death. He, therefore, glanced gratefully in, the direction of his new enemy, and gave a sudden start. He had seen the coun- tenance before. His intended assassin was Ruy Gran- daville!  The crash of the pistol rang out sharp and clear above all the noise of the place; ;a sudden darkness passed I    190      The Sisters of Orleans. over Brown's vision, and unconsciousness came to his relief at the very moment that the door against which he was being pressed, unable to sustain the increasing weight, gave way, and the bloody, senseless body fell backward and disappeared.  It was swallowed up in what seemed to be a deep, dark pit. To understand this singular and unexpected disappear- ance, it is only necessary to know that the door spoken of opened into that portion of the- building farthest from the sharp point of the triangle, and consequently that por- tion which was the longest between the streets. As there was a' space left between the rooms that fronted upon the streets, to which no light could obtain access, it had never been finished; not even so much as a floor laid to correspond with-the hall in which the conflict had taker C/   place. Consequently, when the door gave way, there -was nothing to break the body's fall, until it reached the floor or the ground below. As the space beneath, which was used for a cellar or storage-room for one of the ad- joining shops, was entirely closed at the time, no lighl could reach it, except by the door which had just beer broken open. That was so limited a supply that, to a ,pe ron, standing in the doorway through which Browr had fallen, no object beneath was distinguishable. I was like looking into bottomless depths. The first of the rioters that piressed forward to discover the whereabouts of the body(recoiled at the darkness and stench that met them. -- He's on 'his way to Hell, and I propose that we le him take his own road," exclaimed one of the foremost as he shoved back from that noisesome hole. A hoarse laugh greeted this exhibition of wit. Neverthele$s, there were others less inclined to let their victim go, who woulc 1hSave insisted upon securing the body, had not their at r  z w ;  *     w    +     t $  e  * r  *   Thae Mob.         9 I tention been suddenly called in another direction. Just then a great clamor arose not far off, made up of shouts, cheers and groans. That portion of the crowd which had been surrounding Brown, eager for any new excitement, rushed 'fron the spot in quest of the fresh sensation. So entertaining did it prove to be, that they speedily forgot the old one. \ The attraction which so suddenly called away Brown's late assailants, turned out to be a colored man, who was being suspended by the neck from an awning-beam in the street. That he was black was evidence sufficient to the majority of the spectators that his punishment was deserved. But, in addition, he had been guilty of an act which could, by no possibility, at such a time be forgiven., - He had struck a white man. ,  Attracted by the cries of his wife, from whom he had become separated in the attack upon the Triangle Build- ing, of which he was a tenant, he had found her strug- gling in the grasp of one of the rioters. Without stop- ping to consider the difference which color had established between them, the enraged, husband seized the first weapon he could lay hand upon, and stretched his wife's assailant to all appearances lifeless at his feet. The deed was wit- nessed by some of the stricken man's companions, and the audacious perpetrator was instantly seized, and borne, amid insults and execrations, to summary execution. The multitude was just then in excellent humor to enjoy the exhibition. The announcement of the. fall of Brown, the Yankee and leader of the Abolitionists, had excited the wildest enthusiasm. Consequently, the ap- pearance of the struggling negro, and his suspension in air, writhing and gasping in the agonies of death, were greeted with the liveliest manifestations of approval.

Proofs of violence were to be -seen on every hand. A reign of terror prevailed.  The journals of the' citjr the next day were, filled with. accounts of the riot. Browni, 'the Abolitionist," was spoken of as a man of great strength and desperate cour- age, who had severely wounded several parties before he was finally dispatched. To Ruy Grandaiilte was, ac- corded much praise for his part in- the affair.. He was - described as not only, by his coolness and: 'decisioti, gi-' ing the principal direction to the movement, but aIs 'tf-e one who had put an end to the Northern desperado.

That circumstance at one time gave rise to the startling rumor that he had finally made his -escape. Nothing could be more absurd. Apart from the testimony of a number of persons who saw him cut and mangled until almost past recognition, and finally shot dead, we are now prepared to give the facts concern- ing the disposition that was made of his body. "It seems that, after the darkness of'the night had ren- dered their movements in a measure secure, some of the negroes returned to the scene of yesterday's riot, and- removed the dead Abolitionist without being observed. -Preparations were immediately made for his interment. Fearing further interference, owing to the excited condi- tion of public feeling, they made their arrangements to bury him before morning. Accordingly, after the hour of midnight, he was conveyed to one of the colored peo- ple's graveyards outside of the city limits, and there in- terred A large concourse of negroes assembled at the : :cemetery, and their manifestations of grief are said to have been such as to furnish unmistakable proofs of L gratitude and affection. The scene at the grave is des- cribed as truly affecting.'  "Attracted by the movement, several members of. the ' police were present, and saw the coffin containing the b-ody deposited in the grave. There cai, therefore, be  no doubt of the facts stated, which were furnished us by I :: i'eye-witnesses :as- we were about going to ,press. There I was no interference on the part of the authorities. Per- ia-ps it was better so. There is certainly an appropriate- ness in one who chose to make negroes his associates in life, resting among them after death."   ,  .  .          *    The Mob.         195 But others than journalists of Net Orleans, and of the South, published accounts of the affair, and indulged in comments to suit their own views and feelings. The public mind everywhere throughout the country was be- coming intensely inflamed; for those influences which soon afterwards culminated in civil war, were then ac- tively at work. The events which have been described, added another element to the -bitterness of.,the strife. Northern journals took up the matter, and made it the text for their most fiery articles. Brown, .according to ' their accounts, was a martyr to a' great principle. His heroism, his disinterestedness, his untimely end, were all glowingly portrayed. Poems- were written upon 'his death, and orators upon the stump and in the pulpit made it-the theme for many-discourses. Not the least eloquent of these was the Rev. Mr. Sunnyman, who improved the opportunity by making a pointed and pow- erful attack upon negro slavery, which he showed to be condemned by many passages of Scripture. While to'politicians and professional manufacturers of sensations the event'was only so much capital that was to be made the most of, to one heart it brought a sorrow that was intensely real. Charles Brown's mother, in her'  New England home, for a time was like one that was stricken with death in life. - She lived on, but the send of existence was gone. Then there came a change. Her- eye grew strangely bright, and a singular infatuation took possession of her. She thought her boy was coming home, and she could think of nothing, talk of nothing, but his return. She busied herself in the preparation of numberless little luxuries to be e'ady for his arrival. Poor woman! They said in low, sad tones, that she " was out of her head."   ,.   PART II. CHAPTER I. ABOUT GOOD BLOOD. V-'ERDINAND CASTELLOS was one of the r tij  most attractive young men connected with the Spanish Court, at a time when it was the most brilliant in Europe. His descent was uite enough to make the fortune of an ordinary courtier ; rT, although marred by a taint of illegitimacy, it was aceable directly to the loins of the great Ferdinand of ragon. Bulte had many things besides birth in his Nvor. Not the least of these was a remarkably hand- )me person. Nor was he lacking in mental gifts, par- cularly that one which imparts efficiency to all others- nlbition. 'What he chiefly labored for, was military ad- ncement. His chosen reliance was the sword. With iat he trusted to clear his way to the one desirable thing [at had been denied him- fortune. Nor was there a. doubt of his success, -had he been suf- red to follow the bent of his own genius without inter- iption. But that was not to be. Love's sorcery, as it as done a thousand times before, and as it will continue do as long as human nature endures, intercepted him ! the shining road to wealth and station, and led him ,ide to dally with its enchantments. He was fascinated, Id entrusted the happiness -of his life to the keeping of   About Good Blood.       Ig9 one whom he fondly believed to be fidelity itself. Had. i he sought rank and fortune with a wife, he might have  - commanded both with the hand of the proudest about;I the 'Court; but, governed by a loftier sentiment, he gave b his heart to one whose beauty was her wealth. Other- wise, she was as poor as the man whose faith she ac-  cepted. Unfortunately, she failed to share the disinter-  estedness of her lover; and when a man of inferior qualir ties of heart and mind, but of high station and abundant possessions, offered his rank and name, she deliberately transferred her allegiance to him. ,    j When Ferdinand returned from a distant expedition in  the king's service, covered with new laurels, and hastened  under the combined promptings of love and expectation to claim the prize he believed to be in waiting, he was amazed, confounded, infuriated to find his solemnly be- trothed' the wife of another. Naturally headstrong, and stung to madness by the wrong of whichhe had been a victim, he looked to nothing but his sword for redress. His successful rival was forced to meet him in a combat that had to prove fatal to one or the other, and soon lay a lifeless form beneath his challenger's pitiless eye. - Had his position been less secure in the royal favor, ' : Ferdinand's punishment must have been most severe;  for the fallen man was one of the king's, highest subjects; but, in consideration of the eminent service he had ren-t dered, he was merely sentenced to banishments to the 'New World, a destination which then wasj of all things, : the most acceptable -that could have been ordered.  Henceforward, he was a soldier pure and simple. Always foremost in undertakings involving danger, he seemed to ^ have lost all care for praise and distinction. His life was as austere as it was disinterested. He clheerfully  : shared every. discomfort, as well as every peril, with his   I98      The Sisters of Orileazs. meanest soldier. ' His only object in life seemed to be the performance of his duty in his sovereign's service. Hence, when the territory of Louisiana passed under the. dominion ' f Spain, and it was known that its pos- session could be retained. only by a long and arduous conflict, Ferdinand was selected as one of the ctptains to accompany the new commandant to that almost unknown country, In this capacity he became a resident of New Orleans, and was soon looked upon as its most trusty defender in those wars with the Indians which so often threatened it with destruction.  In time, there was not an inhabitant of the infant city but honored and loved the name of Ferdinand Castellos. The affection was a mutual one. In fact, so strongly did the kind-hearted' soldier, now grown. to be a grizzled and time-hardened veteran of middle years, become attached to his new home that, when the supremacy of the country passed from the hands of the Spanish king, he chose to remain and share its destinies. From that time on he was one of the leading and most valued citizens of the place. Among 'those whose fast friendship he secured, was Amade Dectoval, a French nobleman of broken fortunes, who, carried away by the excitement attending the specu- lations of the notorious IJaw, had invested all he pos- sessed in the famous Mississippi Scheme of that desper- ate adventurer, and come to Louisiana as a manager of -the. company. When the bubble burst, he found himself reduced almost to the condition of a beggar in a new and unsettled community. He had no inducement left to return to his native-country; and, with blighted -hopes,  continued an unequal struggle with poverty and misfor-  tune:in the home of his adoption. Being a manof supe- -rior culture, Castellos, who, beneath, the soldier's rough exterior, retained all the elegance of his earlier life, had * e  eror  retai et-     ,   About Good Blood.       I99 been drawn to him, partly by compassion, and partly by reason of their kindred tastes, and supplied him the only solace he possessed in congenial companionship; They became established friends. But, notwithstanding the comfort such an association afforded the. mind of the fallen nobleman, it could not restore health and strength to a constitution undermined by a long train of disasters, and, when he found himself suddenly attacked by one of the diseases incident to the climate, he knew that his end was near.: He was in very great mental distress. For himself he was indifferent, but he had a daughter, except himself, the sole surviving member of his -household, who would be left destitute and alone among strangers. To add to the difficulties of the case, Eugenie was only seventeen years of age, and very beautiful. She was too young and inexperienced to be safely left to her own guardianship in that remote ald half barbarous place. What to do, the unhappy father did not know; but, aS was natural enough, his mind, in this dilemma, reverted, to the only friend'and confidant he possessed. Accordingly, Cas- tellos was sent for, anid, upon his arrival, was made ac- quainted with the situation of his friend's affairs and the cause of his distress. In the name of that charity which goes right to the heart, he was appealed to by the-dying man to prove a protector to the child, as he had been a benefactor to the father. The old soldier was-seriously embarrassed, He was a bachelor, and in the matter of worldly possessions very little better off than the man who was breathing his last. His heart was willing, but -he scarcely knew what it was in his power safely to promise. /"You are right," said he, " in supposing that I will cheerfully do all I can to serve the child of my friend;   200      The Sisters of Orleans. but I greatly distrust my ability. I know of but one way in which I can take the girl under my protection, without periling her good name ; but as you say she is young and endowed with much beauty, I fear her heart would with- hold its consent. My day of gallantry has long. been over, and little is left to this weather-tarnished form that would be endurable in a maiden's eyes; nevertheless, as the sacrifice would be hers, if she should see fit to accept the ,best offering I can make, she is welcome to such protection as a husband would give." Eugenie was called into the presence of the two men, and told what had transpired. Thle old soldier and tihe girl looked at each other, it being the first time they had ever met. Castellos was then nearly fifty years of age, and retained few of those graces of person which, in his youth, had made him so popular in the most polished Court of Europe. As for the girl, she was all that her father had- described her. No shoner, however, had she learned what had passed, than, stepping up to :the vet- eran,.she freely put her hand in, his, and, in a frank and cheerful voice, delivered her answer: ; ^ ,t'.Be assured, Sir, that any one that has been kind to my father, cannot be indifferent to me. Such an one I already love for his sake. Nor am I unmindful of the distinction you would confer upon me. Although we have been personally strangers, I have been made famil- iar with your virtuesy many tongues. Therefore, be,- lieve me, when I say that I will gladly become your wife, should you deem me worthy of such hghl honor." Not only did Eugenie make the dying man happy, but the living one, also. She was not simply content to be an-affectionate 'wife; s'e took a deep interest in her husband's affairs. By her persuasion he engaged in cer- tain business transactions that proved, highly profitable. '         .            '    C,        About Good Blood.       20I The result was that, without exactly dying a rich man, he succeeded in laying the foundation for an abundant estate for his family. One son was the issue of Ferdinand Castellos' singular marriage, and he was a mere boy at the time of his father's death. He had, however, a very competent guar- dian and adviser in his mother. That eminently practi- cal woman managed affairs with great prudence, until her son had reached an age to assume control. The young gentleman fortunately inherited a large share of his mother's sagacity, and, after living a quiet, but busy, life, died one of the richest men in New Orleans. At the time that this story opens, the Castellos family and estate were represented by a gentleman who, on account of his intimate connection with many of the incidents related, deserves more than a passing notice. Ferdinand Castellos, for the name in full had regularly descended from father to son, was a universally respected citizen of New Orleans. Apart- from the name and wealth he had inherited, however, he was distinguished for nothing except his extreme stateliness of appearance and manner. Although fifty years of age at the time he is introduced to the reader, no more commanding figurq than his was to be seen upon the streets. Tall and graceful, thoroughly aristocratic in his bearing, and with hair like snow, he never appeared in public without securing a large share of respectful attention. Otherwise, his virtues were purely of a negative- kind. Being possessed of an ample inheritance, he had led an inactive, and, in .a measure useless, life. He was a most thorough aristocrat. His philosophy was one admirably suited to an indolent man. It taught him that the good things he enjoyed came nothy chance or accident, but in accordance with a universal law regulating human des   202      The Sisters of Orleans. tiny. One principal tenet in his code was the1 control- ling efficacy of blood, ,not in any sanguinary sense, but as a transmissible quality.' He believed he was more for- tunate than the majority of men, because he was better born-synonymous in his mind with being born better- an opinion shared by a good many people who have been lucky ehough to come into the world with crowns on their heads or silver spoons in their mouths. He had great respect for his American ancestors; not because of those solid qualities which had provided him the means of living in ease and idleness, but because they were an off-shoot from European' nobility. Like all habits of thought, the argument just indicated had strengthened with his years, until, by the time he appears in these pages, he was accustomed to judge of men less by their own characters, than by lthe characters of their fathers and mothers. The first -question with him had become, What kind of blood does he or she possess? The better portion of his youth had been passed in the Old World, where, he had succeeded in tracing his lin- eage to a very satisfactory origin. Called home by the death of his father to take possession of a considerable estate, he found little that was congenial among a people who rarely inquired concerning each other's grandfathers, and who, if the truth were known, in very many instances could not have told who their own grandfathers were. His circle of intimate friends, consequently, was limited, being: confined to a select few of equally aristocratic tastes  As may be inferred, the difficulty the young aristocrat experienced in choosing acceptable parties for social intercourse, was greatly increased when it came to the selection of a companion for life. There were plenty of charming women, and, being a courtier both by habit and  .t   About Good Blood.       203 instinct, he could easily make himself agreeable to the other sex; but the one indispensable qualification in his eyes for a wife he found exceedingly rare. More than once did his heart carry him to the verge of a positive committal before investigation disclosed some fatal de- fect in the lady's pedigree.' The consequence was, that his more ardent years had passed before he met with one whose lineage was in all respects unquestionable. The lady herself was not so much of a favorite in .his eyes as some others; nevertheless, he married her. The satisfaction which followed this unromantic con- nection, for'.the marriage was not an unhappy one, was of short duration. The wife lived only long enough to give her -husband an heir to his estate and name, perish- ing in the fulfillment of that obligation. ' The mourriing widower made no serious effort to supply he:t rvacant place. . The trouble of finding a suitable suc-. cessor, according. to his standard of qualification, besides his increasing indisposition for serious effort of any kind, was too great to be thought of after his previous experi- ence. Furthermore, he now had -an object to love in his daughter Isabella, whose gentle, loveable nature called out all the warmth of his disposition. Nor was he without other agreeable companionship. Philip Grandaville, the father of Ruy- Grandaville, and. he were most intimate friends.' For such an association the reader will be prepared to account, from what has been said of the elder Grandaville in one of the opening ' chapters of this work. Rarely were two men more alike, both in their antecedents -and their tastes. Both were descended from, noble families; both had had enterpris- ing ancestors; and both were content to live upon the accumulations and the memories of their predecessors. That Ferdinand Castellos afid Philip Grandaville should ,                      *   c204"     The Sisters of Orleans. be attracted to each other was perfectly natural; their very weaknesses strengthening the association.   ' That such men should seek to cement their friendship, and' continue in its purity the superior blood that flowed through their veins, by a family alliance, when the oppor- tunity offered, can be readily understood. They were made happy in the fact that, the heir of one House being a son, and of the other a daughter, and the chil- dren being separated by a few years only in their ages, they were enabled at the same time to execute a mutual desire, and put in force their favorite theory concerning the transmission of personal qualities, by arranging a marriage between them. Under such auspicious circum- stances it was not deemed necessary to 'wait until the preferences of the young people might be consulted; for their consent to such an admirable arrangement could safely be presumed. So it was settled, while Ruy Gran- daville and Isabella Castellos were yet children, and too young to appreciate the importance of the step taken in their behalf, that they should marry as soon as a proper age was' reached. With this understanding' duly im- pressed upon their minds, they grew to mlanhood and womanhood, both accepting the situation as one from -which there'was no likelihood of escape, even if the in- clination to seek it should exist. And, as for that mat- ter, there was no apparent cause why the wishes of. the parents should not be executed by the children. True, there was no romantic attachment between them; but plenty of happy marriages, as the world goes, have been -consummated without it. There was a proper corres- pondence in their ages, and neither had ever contem- plated nor desired any other result. The only serious impediment that had' been interposed, grew out of the unexpected desire of Isabella Castellos to secure the lib-   About Good Blood.       205 eration of the slaves to which she had become heir through the will of her deceased relative-the more un- expected, because she had always been noted for her pleasant and yielding temper. Why the marriage had not been consummated, as had originally been proposed by the parents, several years be- fore the period at which this story opens, is to lbe attrib- uted to a combination of circumstances. One of these, and by no means unimportant, was a secret preference, on the part of both of the young people for the freedom they were enjoying, without so much as a thought, how- ever, on either side, of an. ultimate withdrawal from the  arrangement to which they were parties. -But what con- tributed more than anything else to the delay which had lengthened from one year to another, was the death of the elder Grandaville, occurring some time before the prin- cipal events herein related, and which left young Ruy to the freedom of his own choice of gratification. While still, fully assenting to the marriage as an event which was inevitable, and even desirable, he had shown no eager- ness to have it carried into effect; but, on the contrayy, had quietly interposed obstructions that had led to a continued procrastination. The only party that had ex- hibited an earnest desire to have the marriage concluded, was Isabella's father, who insisted that it was due to the memory of his deceased friend; but with whom the lead- ing inducement was an anxiety to have the subject off., his mind. But so feeble had become his will with the in- crease of years and the growing indolence of his temper, that he was incapable of a resolute assertion of any pur- pose. Periodically he had been accustomed to bring the matter up, when one or both of the young people were, present, and express his solicitude on the subject; but the seeming willingness of both the parties more im- 2   206      The Sisters of Orlcans. mediately interested to an ultimate compliance with his wishes, had always removed any present apprehension, and contented him, for a time at least, to await the move- ment of some one more energetically disposed. At last the time had come when Ruy Grandaville had decided in his own mind, that the marriage so- long delayed, was necessary to save him from financial embarrassment, and that at an early day. But, before dismissing the subject of the old people, and taking u. the thread of events with which we have more particularly to deal,- it is proper that the reader should be made acquainted with one or two additional incidents growing out of the intimacy which had so long existed between the elder Grandaville and Ferdinand Castellos. The latter had occasion, at one of those indolent con- ferences between them, which had been of almost daily occurrence for years, to make known the affliction he was enduring by reason of his inability-to find an efficient and reliable body servant. "You can't imagine the distress," said he, " which my man's ,awkwardness gives me. Why, could you believe it, only dray before yesterday he spilt a bottle of cologne upon. my best waistcoat; utterly spoiling it; and though I had him well whipped, this very morning he emptied a glass of wine upon my dressing-gown. I had him pun- ished, of course; but it seems to be of no use. Its in the blood, and nothing can change it. That's the way, you know, everything that's good or evil comes in this world." "Why did you not speak of this before?" said his sympathizing friend. "Its too bad that you should bo suffering in that way, when I happen to have the very thing you need. A capital article, I assure you, Quick,   Abouzt Good Blood.      207' willing, and as intelligent as a slave has a right to be. He's only half black, and you'll know how to account for my confidence in his qualities, when I tell you that I con- sider myself responsible for one-half the blood in his veins. His name is Felix." "I understand,'3 responded Castellos with a knowing laugh at his companion's allusion to the source of Felix' qualifications. "Now, my dear sir," continued the other, "you must accept that boy as a proof of my desire to profnote your comfort. You will-find him a treasure, I assure you. And for my part, I will have the satisfaction of knowing, that he will be in the best of hands. We never can wholly repress a parental feeling, you know, although in such cases it doesn't answer generially to acknowledge its existence. But then, between old friends who understand each other as we do, its all right." The concluding observation was spoken in a tone of solemnity due to the gravity of the subject. "Thanks! a world -of thanks! my dear Grandaville," replied Castellos. - "You don't know how I appreciate your kindness. But the obligation shall not be all on one side. Fortunately, I am in a situation to repay your generosity both in kind and quality. I have something, likewise, I can recommend. The best of blood, too, I assure you; direct from the veins of the great Ferdinand. She's a beauty--my little girl is. Her mother is almost white, and her own complexion is so ,pure you'd never suspect there was a particle of negro in. it." "A boy and a girl-well, that is a -coincidence, I confess," exclaimed "Grandaville, with a lightsome laugh. "An idea strikes me right'here. We have happily ar- ranged for one union between our families, -but why should we stop with one?'

Why not strengthen the alliance between the Castellos' and the Grandavilles by a marriage of children We do not pub-, licly acknowledge; as well as of the heirs and representa- tives of our houses? What say you?" "Excellent," responded Castellos. "The very thing, I declare!" And, before the friends had separated, it was under- stood that another link was to be added to the'bond be- tween them, by the intermarriage of the slave children who had ben the subjects of the conversation just given.  /            ? Two or three days afterwards there was a formals exchange of papers -between Ferdinand Castellos and Philip Grandaville, whereby the first was made the owner'of Felix, and the latter of Isabella, both described as slaves. The effect of the documents was not only to: change fhe masters, but the destinies of two human beings. Castellos was delighted with his acquisition. Felix fully sustained the character his former owner had given him. He soon made himself indispensable to his newq  master's comfort. The latter was profoundly grateful, \ not to Felix, but to Philip Grandaville, to whom he gave all the credit for the' slave's good qualities,; for was it not the blood that was in his veins that accounted for his superiority? !His case furnished another confirma- tion of Castellos' favorite theory. Nevertheless, Felix failed not to receive numerous sub- stantial tokens of his master's good opinion; and, in addition, was assured of a still greater reward, in pros- pect.  That reward, he was told, was a wife, for whom provision had already been made.  Whatever his real appreciation of?such a favor, the slave-boy was crafty - pprc .crafty   About Goo'd Blood:      209 enough to exhibit nothing but seeming delight at the in- teiligence. But, satisfactory as seemed the arrangements for the union of the two families to all parties .concerned, it was to end in failure, so far as the unacknowledged children! were involved. The circumstance which mainly affected that result, wlas the sudden and wholly unaccountable dis- appearance of Felix. In vain did his master wait one morning for the attentions he was accustomed to receive at his hands, being almost as dependent upon his valet's offices as a child upon -the care of its nurse. Felix failed to present himselfwith his usual promptitude, and, upon being sent for, was nowhere to be found. Castellos- was in equal distress of body and mind. His dressing- gown needed airing; its owner was to be shaved; his coffee had to be served; and numerous attentions were required, which no one coul-d render like Felix. But where was Felix gone i To the intimation that, perhaps, :he had absconded, his "master returned an--indignant neg- ative. The thing was impossible. What had he to com- plain of? Had he not always been treated kindly? Did he not know all/ about the wife he was to receive? And, besides, was he- not of the very best stock, which was a sure guaranty of his fidelity? And still further, if he had intentionally fled, how did it -happen'that Lhis master's money and jewelry, to all of which he had had access, was untouched. No, no; Felix had not run away. That he was the victim of foul play was the conclusion of his afflicted owner; and upon that hypothesis the po- lice were applied. to, and the) case extensively advertised. But all to no effect. Days, weeks and months-went by; and nothing was learned of Felix, until one day a letter was received, bearing the post-mark of Montreal, Can- : ada. The epistle was as follows: f                -   2I0      The Sisters of Orleans. MONTREAL, November    18-. "My Dear Sir, and my late Master: "As you are, doubtless, surprised at my absence, and will naturally be solicitous for my safety, it is due, on ac- count of the many kindnesses I have received at'your hands, that I should acquaint you with my whereabouts, as well as explain my conduct. "I did not run away from you like a slave; I left New Orleans like a gentleman. Thanks to your liberality, when I resolved upon the attempt to obtain my freedom, I possessed ample means to pay for first-class travelling accommodations. I went on board a steamer about to sail for New York, and, as Hamilton Smith, Jr., secured passage for that port, paying for the best the vessel af- forded. I was treated with marked respect by all on board throughout the voyage. I did not find it very diffi- cult to disguise the limited amount of African that ap- peared in my complexion, and- you know that in your service, and that of my former owner, I enjoyed every opportunity to acquire the manners of a gentleman. . For any one to have hinted that the easy- and affable Hamlil- ton Smith, Jr., was not what he purported to be, would have been looked upon as a perilous proceeding; for he made no secret of the fact that he was a Southern gentle- man, entertaining a Southern gentleman's peculiar views. "( Well, I reached New York in safety, stopped at a leading hotel, took my time in seeing the city, and then proceeded Northward, via Saratoga,- the White Moun- tains, etc., journeying leisurely, and stopping at prominent points of interest, as a young Southerner seeking pleasure might be expected to do, and. in due time reached and crossed the border. "Once in Canada, there was no further occasion for disguise. I became plain Felix, and at once sought the means of earning an honest livelihood. In this, with' the experience I had had in your service, I found no diffi- culty. I am now comfortably established in a first-class barber-shop in the Rue Notre Dame, of this city. My health is good, and I think this climate will agree with my constitution. *- "    About Good -Blood.       21I $ Why did I leave my pleasant home with you for a life among strangers? I know you will ask. It was because I was a slave, property, merchandise with you, and I wanted to be a man. I felt that I was a human being, and that it was a duty I owed alike to myself and to my Great Master, to assert the right to which I was born. It was no sudden fancy. The desire to be my own master was a dream from' childhood. I have no doubt it was born with me. And let me tell you, that there is not a slave on a Southern plantation, whatever the color of his skin, with whom that thought is not ever present. I say this, that you may gee itwas no act of. yours that drove me away, and that nothing you could have done would have prevented my effort for freedom; ".I did not leave you without a measure of regret; and here, by way of partial compensation for the loss I have caused you of one slave, I release you from your promise to provide me a wife in the person of another slave. -I will undertake to secure a wife for myself. And, what is equally to my satisfaction, my children, should Heaven ever bless me with any, will be free. "I have another offer to submit-besides very many thanks for your indulgence, which I beg of you to accept -and that is a tender of my services as your grateful at- tendant, should you ever come North, as long as you re- main upon the soil of Canada. I hope you will do. so. The visit would be beneficial to your health, and I doubt, not would give you new impressions of men and things. I can vouch. for the agreeableness of the journey. Let me know, should you resolve to travel this way, and I will meet you at the border.

It showed how even   212   u  The Sisters of Orleans. the best blood, such as Felix had ih his veins, might be corrupted and neutralized by the infusion of another and the inferior African element, thus proving the inestima- ble value of a pure, tried article. The inconsistency involved was of no consequence to a mind so comfort- ably constituted, that it could make premises bend to conclusions-not conclusions to premises. Nor was the slave-governing system the only one to'foster such a di$- position. Religion, politics, science--have they not all been witnesses to the same phenomenon!   ,   - //  CHAPTER II. SOUTH VS.

I detest the whole race of them; but a Yankee negro-trader, bah! Its bad enough for a South- ern man, born and bred in the midst of the thing, to deal in his own flesh and blood; but- a Yankee, when he gets   214     7The Sisters of Orleans. into it, seems positively to like the business. He's a natural born buzzard. A Southern man wlio follows it as a trade to which he's been educated, knows the mean- ness of the thing. He keeps out of sight, when decent people are about; but a Northern man, when he takes to the negro trade, will fling both himself and his busi- ness in yourface.

' Come, come, Boney, hurry up with the shaving. I must be ready to meet the villain. I wish it was with pistols for two, instead of to drive a detestable bargain. But what's the use of scolding? I can't help myself. But it won't do for me to show weakness, or the Yankee will skin me alive. That's his nature. He must not suspect my necessity. My game is to put on. an air of importance, and then-he'll do the cringoing for both of us. If I'm-indifferent, he'll be eager. ' There, Boney, that will answer. Now, my coat--no, my morning-gown. I'd better appear in easy costume. A little negligence's the thing. Too much care would make him think I had been preparing to meet him.

But the fact is, I'm hard up, want money, must have it, and yourself and the darkeys on the old plantation are all I've got to make it out of. Boney, do'you want to be sold?"  "No, Massa, no!

My luck's been awful of late, and it won't do to have any- thing said about it now,: Old. Castellos must not hear of my losses, or he might get his eyes open. If he were not a regular old granny, he'd have known all about it long ago. The only way is to pay up, and maintain my credit. Ha! ha! its comical to be sure-the rich Ruy Granda- ville, whom everybody flatters and courts, yes, and swin- dles, having to sell the family niggers to meet his debts of honor. That affair with Solorgne, Boney, was a mighty unlucky piece of business. By the way, I dreamt of the poor devil last night. Wonder what business he's got to come back? He's dead. Yes, that time, Boney, I killed the goose that laid the golden eggs. But it couldn't be helped (a sigh). 'Twas my fault, though. I ought never to have taken him near the plantation. I might have known Isabella would bewitch him. Fool! fool! that I was, not to know the power of that woman-she who fas- cinated even me, Ruy Grandaville, who's made playthings of so many of her sex. By Heavens, I love her still, spite of her infidelity, and her defiance!P" At this point the speaker was walking hastily up and down the room, with a heavy frown upon his brow. "That woman's-a mystery," he went on. "She's more like a queen than a slave. - How she did stand up to my face, and demand fair play for her lover-her paramour; she a slave-me her master!

The time's come when I must act. .Its reformation' now, or marriage. Its a dreadful alternative, I know; but when bankruptcy and dishonor stares a man in the face, he ought to be prepared for something desperate. It would be more magnani- mous, I suppose, to give up my vagabond companions, release the girl I don't love, and let her make some more worthy fellow happy, and go forth myself to starve. But no, there are not many that would do that. I've drank too long at the giddy bowl to throw it away now. Its vastly easier to smother conscience, and re- sign one's self to a marriage of convenience and a life of luxury, even without the condiment of love. Money's too important an element in my case. Yes, yes, I'd better marry, and marry soon; .The glass, Boney! Just another drop! There! there! that will do. Now I'm ready for the Yankee. There's somebody at the door now. See who it is. If its Hawks, tell him to: walk in." It is needless to explain to the reader who was the principal in the above conversation, or rather soliloquy, for the most of it was addressed to a companion merely from the force of habit, and a block of wood would have answered the same purpose. As will be inferred, Boney -Napoleon Bonaparte was the name in full-was a slave and Ruy Grandaville's valet. He had, in fact, been his master's attendant from his boyhood up, being by quite a number of years his senior. Small in frame, his body was as light and activie a/a boy's, although his kinky hair had .turned nearly white with age, contrasting strangely with his full African complexion. He faithfully loved his master, and thought of nothing in the world but -.- .   Soutlh vs. NVorth.      217 how to serve him. And as for Grandaville, his confi- dence in his servant was -attested by the habit into which he had fallen, of making him a talking post for all his humors and fancies. Grandaville was correct in surmising the new-comer to be Hawks, the Yankee. That individual, who has not heretofore been introduced .to the reader, as he appeared in the doorway opened to admit him, was a tall man, withl a thin face that had somet!ling so apparently rueful in its expression as to make it alinost comical to look at. He was, on this occasion, elaborately gotten up. His clothes were of the most fashionable cut; a profusion of jewelry glittered about his breast; and a small cane was awk- wardly held in one gloved hand. As the door was opened by Boney, in dashed the vis- itor with a movement so smart, and a bow so profound, that his body came in collision with the negro's, and his descending head gave Boney's a considerable thump. There was a recoil, and the Yankee looked about him-in grave'bewilderment before he could speak.  "Beg pardon! beg pardon! Dem it, what d'u mean, you black scoundrel? Fine morning, Mr. Grandaville, fine morning. Out of the way, you infernal-nigger. Hope I see you well, Mr. Grandaville; hope I see you well. Don't care if I have cracked your blasted skull, you tarnal scare-crow." During the delivery of this mixed salutation, Granda- ville stood withhis back to the speaker. He had taken his station before a large mirror, where he was indus- triously engaged in adjusting his cravat, but in a position to see all that transpired. It was some-time before he could trust his voice to respond, if he had desired to do? so.  Meanwhile, Hawks had been bowing and scraping in the centre of the room. Io0   The Sisters of Orleans. "Sit down," said Grandaville gruffly, when at last he did speak, without turning from the mirror. Hawks dropped into a chair as if he had been shot, astonished and crest-fallen at the incivility of his recep- tion. Grandaville went on with his occupation at the mirror for a minute or two longer ; then assumed one or two postures before the glass, as if studying the effect of the arrangement he had made; and then, as if suddenly re- membering something, he turned sharply upon his visitor. "Good morning, Sir; and to what, may I ask, do I owe the honor of so early a call ? " " I-I beg pardon, if-if I've come too soon. I did not know--that is, I'm a man of business. No offence, I hope. Thought you wanted me. Beg pardon, if--beg pardon." Grandaville had placed the Yankee at a further disad- vantage by suggesting to his mind the idea of some breach of etiquette, a point on which-he was particularly sensitive. "Ah! I remember now," began Grandaville slowly, as if undergoing a mental effort, retaining at the sametime a standing position. "I believe, Mr. Hawks, you hold some of my paper. No great amount, I daresay, as I make it a point to take care of it, before it greatly accu- mulates. I suppose you-are anxious for your money." "Not at all, Mr. Grandaville ! not at all! I would not have mentioned it-hope-you won't suspect such a thing. I really dew."  Another disadvantage for Hawks, in supposing him- self accused of an intention to dun the man whose good- will he was anxious to secure. "0 !its of little consequence, Mr. Hawks. I merely asked to satisfy myself," replied Grandaville in a tone of quiet indifference.  Then, as if the matter had just > .          .     .    '   South vs. North.            -2I9 suggested itself, he added: "I believe you sometimes deal in slaves as well as negotiable paper. Am I rightly informed ? " Here was a relief for the embarrassed Hawks, He was proud of his business, as it was one which brought him in contact with slave-holders. And besides, believing that he thoroughly understood the subject, it was one upon which he felt that he could talk without blundering. "O yes, Mr. Grandaville, I buys and sells a deal of niggers. I dew indeed. I flatter myself that I'm as good a judge of 'em, if I wus brought up in New England, as the best of you Southerners. I rather think I'm naterly suited to the business." "I should certainly think you were." The sneer which accompanied these words was lost on .Hawks. "Thanks, Mr. Grandaville, thanks for the compli- ment! I appreciates your good opinion; I dew, indeed. Can I dew anything for you in that line?  Would be pleased if I could."  "Perhaps you can," said Grandaville coolly. "I hap- pen to have on hand at present a few people that I do not need. You may have them upon fair terms. I have made out a list of them, with their ages, qualifications, and the prices which I think tlhey ought to bring. I suppose, Mr. Hawks, my word will be accepted as a suf- ficient guaranty for the character of the property." "Certainly, certainly, Mr. Grandaville. Your word is  sufficient for everything connected with it." " That being the case, Mr. Hawks, the amount of those. notes of mine you hold can be credited on the price of the slaves, and the difference you can pay me in cash." With these words, Grandaville handed the Yankee the paper he had alluded to.    220      The Sisters of Orleans. Hawks winced- terribly as his' eyes ran over it. -'He saw at a glance that the prices set down considerably ex- 'ceeded the market value of the property. For some time he sat irresolute, debating whether he should repudiate the arrangement or submit to it, during which his counte- nance took on such an increase of ruefulness as to make it really pitiable to look upon. He was excessively fond of money, but, at the same time he was beset by a craving desire to gain admission "to fashionable society, having made up his mind that he had accumulated wealth enough to stand the increased expense. Ruy Granda- ville he looked upon as the leader of the set he was ambitious to enter, and whether the amount of money involved was worth the loss of his friendship, was the question. His natural avariciousness might even then have gained the victory, had he not been conscious that Grandaville's eye was upon him, and the secret dread he entertained of his companion proved sufficient to turn the scale., So, gulping -down his chagrin witlI an effort, he endeavored to put on a grateful look, and Announced his satisfaction with the terms proposed. His point gained, Grandaville's manner quickly changed. He argued that the Yankee might be useful to him an- other time, and it was better, therefore, to treat him with courtesy. Accordingly, putting on an air of graciousness that quite fascinated Hawks, he invited him' to join him at breakfast. Concealing the fact that he had already breakfasted, Hawks gladly accepted the invitation, and the two men were soon seated at the table upon appar- ently the most cordial terms. ' That's a right handy -nigger you've got," said Hawks, turning his eyes full upon Boney, 'who at the time was waiting upon his, master and his guest. "What amount have you concluded you would part with him for?"   South vs. North.       221 "O, Napoleon Bonaparte and I are such old cronies that I have not yet made up my mind .to dispose df him," replied Grandaville, smiling at the fire he saw in his old servant's eye. And, in fact, the look with which the old negro re- garded the Yankee, exceeded in wrathfulness the one which followed the awkward collision at the door.' Nor was he long in obtaining satisfaction. Having occasion, a moment afterwards, to pass a cup' of steaming hot coffee over the Yankee's shoulder, his hand-something it had never been known to do before--suddenly grew unsteady, and down went the contents upon Hawks' arm and hand. With a yell of pain the Yankee sprang to his feet, and made a grab for the -offender, which the latter was agile enough to elude. Then began a most exciting chase. Round and round the room went pursued and pursuer, the latter fairly foaming with rage, while Grandaville leaned back almost convulsed with merriment. The con- test, owing to the superior wind the Yankee's youthful- ness gave him, was likely to bet an unequal one, when Napoleon changed his tactics, by taking a low ottoman in the course of his flight. Over it skilfully skipped the negro, but Hawks, whose eye was fixed upon his prey, stumbling at the obstruction, plunged forward and came heavily upon the floor. He was considerably stunned by the fall, and his fashionably cut garments and stylish jewelry suffered even more than his person. A woeful figure, with bloody nose, torn clothing and broken watch- chain, did he present, when Grandaville, having suc- ceeded in overcoming his laughter, assisted-him to-his , feet. By the use of water and towel, and encouraged by   ' some gracious words from hid host, and some cros-s ones   i addressed to Boney,' Hawks was at last restored to good -   222      Thle Sisters of Orleans. humor and his seat at the table. There, under the skil- ful flattery of Grandaville, and the influence of a few glasses of excellent wine, he was soon in such jolly mood that he went forth, after the meal was over, with an uin- common light in his eye, and a step, although slightfly unsteady, more than ordinarily buoyant. "Wal,.that Southern chap did git a leetle the advan- tage of me this time," said he, as the fresh air brightened up his faculties, and set him to reviewing the bargain he had made. : It all comes-of the superior manners and breedin' of them. Southerners. I can manage the nig- gers with any of them, but I'm not yit up to some of the ways of the bosses. But I'll be even with him yit. I've got what wins in the long run. It's my gold agin his brass. He'll be wantin' more money soon, and then'll be my chance. He'll have more niggers to sell. Such fellers is always wantin' money, land I calc'late in the -end I'll own both niggers and master. Meanwhile, if I can make him shove me inter good society, I've made the main pint. I can take my time to pluckin' the goose afterwards. But now for my new purchase." With that, Hawks took out the memorandum Granda- ville had given him, and looked it carefully over. It was as follows: "Washington, age 44, field hand, sound, . I,200 Jefferson, age 24, mechanic, sound, . . . 2,560 Pomp, age 50, field hand, one eye, . . . 800 Hester, age 30, cook, sound, . . . . 1,8oo Columbus, age I5, mulatto, sound, . .  . ,oo000 Pete, age 20, field hand, sound, .. . ,400 Susanna, age i8, handsome mulatto, sound, 2,oo000" "' Susanna," repeated Hawks, s age eighteen, handsome mulatto, sound, price two thousand dollars-it's a big fig- ger io give, but them's the kind that brings the money."   CHAPTER III. TAKING UP THE THREAD. HE reader has learned- that there were two persons of the name of Isabella, children of Ferdinand Castellos, one the daughter of his deceased wife, the other slave-born-a state of things not very remarkable under the somewhat patri- archal system of American slavery. By a singular coin- cidence, one of these children became the intended wife of Ruy Grandaville, and the other, having been trans- ferred to his father, in exchange for the slave-boy Felix, became Ruy Grandaville's property; and, as he con- fessed to his servant Boney, or rather to himself in Boney's presence, the latter had the stronger hold upon his affections. A word in further explanation of the events leading to this state of things may not here be amiss. The slave daughter was the elder of the two by a few days only, and her mother had been called in, upon the death of Ferdinand Castellos' wife, to take charge of the newly-born infant that survived'her. The two children drew their nourishment from the same breast durihg the first months of their existence, and were inseparable play- mates until the fourth or fifth year of their ages. To any one's but the father's partial eyes, the slave-child would have appeared to possess more of the paternal characteristics than the other, being taller, stronger, and even of a fairer complexion, the slave-mother having barely a trace of the African' stock. But to Ferdinand %,t .   224      The Sisters of OrleaZs. Castellos the delicate, timid little girl that was the hope of his house, iwas, the object of such absorbing interest that he scarcely gave a' thought to her companion. It was not until the age above mentioned, that his attention was seriously called to the peculiarities of the two chil- dren, when an incident occurred that led to their perma- nent separation. Happening one day, about that time, to be a witness of their plays, the father noticed that the slave-daughter assumed a very decided authority over the other, putting on all thie little childish airs of conscious superiority, which were meekly and cheerfully submitted to. He was astonished and chagrined to think that the lawful repre- sentative of his illustrious line should submit to-direction from one of inferior origin, and he determined to remove the objectionable influence at once. Still, as he could not be wholly indifferent to one whose natural claim upon him was so strong, the act was marked by no spirit of unkindness.  The little slave-girl was sent to a distant boarding-school, whose educational advantages were first- class, where she was permitted to remain from year to year. There she grew up, nothing in her complexion be- traying her birth, not only without a suspicion of her ser- vile origin among those about her, but in ignorance of it herself. As for her father, whose care for her was limited to paying her bills as they matured, he rarely gave her a thought. - Not having seen her since she went forth from his house, he continued to regard her as a little girl, and acted under that. impression in making the transfer to his friend Philip Grandaville. It was under an equallv erro- neous impression that the transfer was accepted, Granda- ville supposing that he was about to come into possession of a  servant whom lie could send immediately into his kitchen. Great was his astonishment and confusion when   Taki g Up the Thread.      225 there was placed upon his hands an accomplished and brilliant young lady, whose qualifications were such only as became the parlor and library. What added to his embarrassment, was the fact that his son Ruy was daily expected to return from a foreign tour, to fulfil, as was understood, the matrimonial engagement long arranged for him with the heiress of the Castellos' estate. Natur-  ally, he feared the effect of such charms as he saw the new servant possessed, should she come in the way of    ; his son. In this emergency, he could think of nothing better than to, send her to his country plantation. The arrangement would have answered very well, had not Ruy, while on a hunting excursion, visited the old plan- tation, and there encountered the hidden beauty. His fascination was complete, the circumstances of the case giving quite an air of romance to the meeting, particu- larly as Isabella, though a slaye, was not one to yield to the first overtures of a lover. 'Henceforward, he became  such a devoted Nimrod as to pass much of his time in hunting excursions. And, at the same time, he was moved to invent numerous pretexts for delaying his con- templated marriage; and his father soon afterwards dying; he found himself,in a position to further postpone his nuptials with the one Isabella, while he could assert a master's authority over the other. Thus had events run on.  -                        ; But while the presence of the slave-daughter was  found objectionable to Ferdinand Castellos, the mother was not only permitted to remain, but to 'retain the principal charge of the heiress of his' house. This  woman was far superior to the majority of her class.,  She was nearly white, and possessed, .not only of de-  Ail cided elements of character, Jbut of-considerable personal . beauty. As may be inferred, she was something of a I O*, *  ' *                       -   : 226    The Sisters of Orlealns. .  :  favorite with her master before the birth of the,'hildi and circumstances then transpired to greatly stregtheln her hold upon his regard. Her care of her little mother- less charge had been most devoted, abating nothingw:hen her own child had been sent away from her. She se- cured the entire affection of the daughter, which was the surest avenue to the heart of the father.- And besides, having been advanced, step by step, to the position of principal housekeeper, she had managed to make-herself so useful to her-master in his increasing years and indo- ':*, lence of disposition, as at last to appear indispensable to his comfort. At the time that my story opens, nearly everything connected with the household was entrusted to her management. The power she enjoyed was used with fair discretion, although it was not at all strange that even her master sometimes felt its exercise to be somewhat tyrannical and irksome. He, however, had by that time lost'the strength of purpose necessary to throw off her authority, had he felt'so inclined. Her name was Esther, and by the time she appears in the incidents here recorded, she had, after the manner that prevailed among slaves,.become known as Aunt Esther. The foregoing preliminaries being disposed of, I will now ask the reader to accompany me to the apartments of-Ferdinand Castellos, at a date preceding, by a few days, the riot of which an account is given in Part I. The suite of rooms reserved for the private use of that- gentleman, were such as became an elegant and wealthy'citizeno As we enter, we find, the proprietor re- clining in a large, luxurious chair, in the enjoyment of that- state of idleness which was becoming daily more and 5,' more grateful. His quiet, however, is not to be undis- turbed. A' gentle tap comes at the door.  Without -  changing his position, Castellos bids whoever is there to   Takzing Up tie Thread.     227 enter, at the same time that a slight shade, indicative of annoyance, passes over his brow. The door opens, and a female, rather over the middle age, large and matronly in appearance, with something softly winning in the ex- pression of her countenance, quietly enters. Her com- plexion is touched with just enough color to betray an African connection, and her hair waves slightly, but her features are remarkably regular. She is Aunt Esther. The policy of the woman at once appears in the pleas-, ant manner in which she inquires after her master's health. The shadow entirely leaves Castellos' brow, as he assures her of his comfort. Then there is a moment's silence, which is clearly one of anticipation. "I'se come," began the woman, seeing that the time to speak had arrived. " to speak 'cernin' your daughter." "Isabella!-is she sick, or has anything happened her?" inquired the old man, partly raising himself in his seat, and looking anxiously in the face of the woman.  "No, no! de dear chile am bery well. ;de Lor' forbid dat anyting should happen her!" responded the servant with a warmth that could not have been wholly simu-  lated. Then there was a pause, after which the speaker pro- ceeded : ' What a comfort a 'fectionate, 'bedient chile must be,. to be surel " "And what a care!" added the father with a sigh. "' There is no telling the anxiety the dear girl has caused me, left motherless to my sole charge-and yours," the last words being accompanied with a glance of kindly acknowledgment. "But, thank Heaven! the greatest burden is taken off my mind by an arrangement with my deceased friend, Grandaville. My daughter is secure in a good husband, and a happy settlement in life, and I   228      Th e Sistcrs cf Orleans. can dismiss the subject from my thoughts. What a satis- faction !"- "An' am it really so, dat de 'rangement fur de mar- -  riage 'tween Missey Bella an' young Grandaville, dat I'se heard spoken 'bout, am to come off?   I'se hab tought    " "To be sure it is! To be sure it is!" interrupted Castellos with decided emphasis, mixed with a little pet- ulance. "Its what I've been anxious for all the time, *:,' ,  that the subject might' be off my mind; but the young 'folks did not seem to know what was best. I did not /^'l ' ' like to press the matter." "I'se did not feel certain  " "No uncertainty, no uncertainty about the matter," interrupted Castellos ,with some impatience, "and no more delay, Heaven be praised! Ruy Grandaville at last seems as' anxious to have the contract concluded as I have been all the time. Consider all the arrange- ments about the house in your own hands. I give you full power. A woman's judgment in such'matters is bet- ter than a nman's, and you were always wonderfully cleaver. What a relief it will be when the 'affair is over! Let, there be no delay !" "But Massa, I'se wants to ax you     one question. You'll'pardon de liberty I'se takes 'count ob de 'fection -,  ' I'se has fur MAissey Bella.  I'se jess feel'most dat she am my own chile, and dat I'se has de right to speak. Is you certain dat, in de 'rangement you'se made, Bella's !; ;    gwine to hab de man dat's worthy ob her ?" -' Worthy of her ! What do you mean ? " retorted the old man with a sharpness that betrayed no little irrita- ? tion. "Worthy of her! Why, Philip Grandaville was i':  not only fmy best friend, but the best man I ever knew. His.son has the best blood in the country.  Its blood   that's been tried for generations; mixed with none of your latter day, the-Lord-knows-where-from -adulterations. What can you say to his disparagementi I should like to know." "Nothin', nothin' ob my own knowledge; but dar is, reports. Thar may be nothin' in demn-I'se hopes thar izzn't-but might it not be well dat you'se should inquire ? " " Well, what has report to say against Ruy Grandaville ? Jealousy of his birth, I doubt not, is at the bottom of it all. Some of thoke low-born, worthless creatures' talk." " Dat may be so. I'se hopes it is; but dey do say dat he .gambles-0 ! so terribly; dat he'se spendin' all his money." "Ruy may be a little too easy with his money. I re- member that his father was always very free-handed. The young men of the present day, I fear, are entirely too thoughtless.  When I was young, I occasionally risked something at play myself. I siall speak to Ruy. A word of caution can do no harm." "But   '" "But-what next ?" "Dey talks ob his-what is him called?--lib-liber- libertinism-dat's de name." "A charge, I apprehend, which might be brought against a good many young men of respectable birth. The times are a great deal worse than they used to be, Esther; and yet few of us were altogether, blameless. You would hardly say that I was not fit to become the head of a family, and, at the same time, I don't think you would assert that, when somewhat younger than I am, I was exactly a Joseph. We must trust to time to do its work with Ruy." The quizzical glance -with which they were spoken,   230      The Sisters of Orleans. more than the words, brought a bright color to Esther's brow and cheek. "But dat's not de wust." "What! more accusations? But of course, of course they will talk against any one of Ruy Grandaville's birth --the miserable pack of fatherless nobodies. O! their malignity is unbearable. But what else have they to say?" "Massa, dey says dat Ruy Grandaville's 'fections am eleswhar; an' dat, after spendin' all he'se got on de favorite an' dem dat's wuss, he'se jess gwine to marry your chile, Missey-Bella, dat's an' angel, fur de sake ob de property, to save hisself front 'sposure an' ruin." "O, the villains! the slanderers! the low, base-born miscreants! whoever would have supposed their jealousy could have carried them so far?" The speaker was now on his feet, his former listless- ness all gone, pacing up and down the room with nervous footsteps and a countenance hot with anger. "But stop," he added after a few rapid turns. "I'll hear no more of their inventions. To question the honor of the son of Philip Grandaville, who was closer to me than a brother. I know every drop of blood in his body. Its come down through generations of honorable men- men that were noble in a noble land-and to think of creatures positively ignorant of their own fathers, imput- ing baseness to the inheritor of such qualities. But not another word, not another word of their villifications. Esther, hasten the preparations for the marriage. Let us get this business iover, that the matter may be off my mind. The worry of it will kill me, if it goes on much longer. Use your own discretion in everything. There now, let us say no more about it." With that, Ferdinand Castellos threw himself bk into   Taking Up the Thread.      231 his chair, and the old complacent look began to steal over his countenance. Esther was crafty enough to see that nothing more was to be- accomplished by pressing the subject at that time, her master's love of repose, and still more, his confidence in the efficacy of inherited blood making him proof against all charges derogatory to Ruy Grandaville. Accordingly, with a gracious smile upon her countenance, she bowed herself out of his presence. But no sooner was the door shut between her and her master, than a bitter expression took the place of the smile upon her face, and raising her clenched hand, as if to threaten some obnoxious object, she hissed out be- tween her teeth:   , "He'se not a-gwine to marry her, if I'se de: power to stop it-dat he shan't. Jess as if one woman warn't 'nough fur him to render mis'rable fureber an' fureber." It was evident that Aunt Esther had not lost sight of the other Isabella. The outward exhibition of anger was but momentary.. Quickly suppressing all evidence of such feeling, she went directly to the apartment of her foster-daughter, and with a brow perfectly composed, entered her presence. "What's dis I'se a-hearin' 'bout you'se gwine to marry an' leab us so soon?" asked the old lady, as soon as kindly greetings had been exchanged. "O, no, dear mamma! my marriage need not involve our separation." ( But it brings anoder in 'tween us." Then, after brushing away a tear, or seeming to, she went on: "Dis Massa Ruy; is -you'se sure dat you'se lubs him -iubs himwell 'nourgh tobe his wife?" "I have always liked Ruy," replied Miss Castellos with a look of some amazement.   232      ThZe Sisters of Orleans. "Den does you tink dat he lubs you agin, 'way down in de heart as de man ought'r dat takes de woman fur his wife? I'se foolish, 'haps, in axin' dese questions ; but, Bella, I'se allers lub'd you as my own chile, an' I'se so 'ticular when anyting 'cerns your happiness." "Yes, yes, mamma, I know you are the best old soul in the world; and you are certain of my love, whether anybody else is or not." And with that the speaker enforced her words with a -kiss. "But why should I doubt Ruy's sincerity?" she con- tinued. "He has asked me to be his wife. He has lived in the expectation that I should be his wife." "Dat's jess it. De old folks 'ranged it all when you war a leetle prattler on my knee, an' Massa Ruy, he'se been all dis- time a-makin' up his mind to hab de 'greement 'forced. Dat makes me 'spicious. It's been a bery long time." "Well, for that matter, I presume I have been quite as much to Iblame as Ruy.   But I don't see why you should begin to distrust him, when he does insist on his right under the contract." "De fac' is, chile, I'se don't understand Massa Ruy. If dar war only you'se own sweet self, I'd neb& 'spicion nuffin'--but dar'se de property." "O, mamma, I begin to discover what's the matter," said Isabella, laughing. "You're jealous. You want to keep me all to yourself, you dear, loving, old darling, that you are! There's a kiss to cure you. But, mamma, I've got something to tell you, which will quite relieve you of your apprehensions. You, perhaps, know that a large portion'of the property I  have inherited consists of slaves, amounting, it is said, to a good many thousand dollars. Now, I am resolved that all my people shall be free. If I had the power, I'd set them at liberty at once,   Taking Up the Thread.      233 without anybody's help. But it so happens that I can do nothing of the kind for a good many years yet, owing to something a certain will has to say about it, unless I get married, and my husband, helps me in the matter. Ac- cordingly, I've made up my mind that whoever marries me, must bind himself in advance to conform to that one wish of mine. So, you see, I've got a test for my lover. If he marries me without the property, I'm sure of his affection. If he declines, I can congratulate anyself in having so perfect a touch-stone to apply to his feelings. I've notified Ruy of the condition. I have not done so because I distrust him, but because I regard it as a mait- 1 ter of justice to the poor people whom Providence has placed in my power, and who, I believe, to be as much entitled to their freedom as I am. Now Mamma, don't you think I'm safe?" T1'e look of pleasant triumph with which the last words were spoken quite silenced the questioner. If not exactly satisfied, Aunt Esther was shrewd enough to see that the' surest way to interest Isabella in Ruy Grandaville, would be to attack him, and make her his champion. Accord- ingly, she ceased her opposition, and changed the direc- tion of her remarks. "I allers know'd you'se had de best heart in de world,  ( an' dat proves it. But Bella," she continued, " dar'se one ting I'se should like to ax fur my own self." Meeting with an assuring smile, the speaker went on: "Your father, Bella, allers told me dat, in 'sideration ob my care ob you'se when you'se war a baby, he war a-gwine to make me a free woman. Now so long as ole    : j Massa lib an' I'se can stay with you, I'se don't want no change; but Massa's gettin' to be an ole man " "I understand, Mamma. I shall speak to father about - 4 , it at once, and have him fulfilfhis promise."       :i   234     -The Sisters of Orleans. "No, chile, no; you'se don't understand de whole. Fur myself I'se care bery leetle. I'se got to be an ole woman now, an' it don't make much difference what comes ob de balance ob my days. But dar'se one fur whom I'se does care. You'se may not 'member her, fur you'se war a bery leetle girl- when dey sent her 'way; but O! I'se nheber, neber shall forget de leetle chile dat used to play with you." Here the old servant hid her face in her hands, and her voice, was choked with emotion: "' You mean your daughter!" exclaimed Isabella Cas- tellos with a responsive quiver in her voice. "You want her free,- too. O! --tell me how I can help you, and I will do anything I can." "Your fadder gib her to ole Philip Grandaville, so dat 'how she'se Ruy Grandaville's slave," resumed the old woman in answer to this assurance. "But if ole Massa, your fadder, war, in de same deed dat sets me free, to say dat he gibs me de title to my own chile dat I might set her-free,'too, Massa Ruy, 'specially, if he'se gwine to tmarry you, couldn't 'fuse to 'firm de 'veyance. Does you'se see de pint?" "I catch your' idea fully," replied Isabella, "and I heartily approve of it. I will have my father, in the in- strument of manumission which liberates you, insert the clause you desire concerning your daughter, and should I become Ruy Grandaville's wife, I promise you that all my influence shall be given to have him confirm it." Heaben bless you," exclaimed the old servant pas- sionately, " fur all your goodness to an ole slave-woman dat can neber tank'you half 'nough! Dey 'prived me ob one daughter,- but dey shant neber rob me ob de oder." And with that Esther threw her arms about her young   Taking Up the Thread.      235 mistress' neck, and folded her in a close embrace. Nor was the, emotion all on her side. The warm heart of Isabella melted fully and at once. Long did they con- tinue locked in each other's arms, their souls stirred with an affection as honest as if they had been mother and dild.   CHAPTER IV. CONTINUING THE THREAD. "-B"y MONEY, has any of those confounded' duns been after me to-day? They have, you say. How many? One, two, three, Satan 'take ... them! But Boney, we'll soon be rid of them. Matters are so arranged at last, that we are mas- ters of the situation. There'll be plenty of money before long, and then for life in earnest. But now to business. I must write that letter, and so fix matters. Bring me pen, ink and paper, gilt-edged, recollect. Now let there be no interruption." Availing ourselves of our-joint privilege of story-teller and story-reader, if we look over the shoulder of the man to whose voice we have just been listening, we will find him busy with the preparation of the following epistle: ' "BACHELOR'S QUARTERS,  ,18-. ("DEAREST ISABELLA: "Yours of yesterday was duly received, and its con- tents considered with the attention to which any com- munication from you is entitled.  f' In reply, I have to say, that the condition you men- titoffers, in my judgment, no obstruction to our union. "i'am, at the same  time, free to admit that I. do not share your peculiar views on the subject of .owning and holding slaves. I  am a pro-slavery man, sincerely believ- ing- that -the most favorable condition in which the negro can be placed is under the protection of a kind and faith- ful master. As an owner of slaves myself, I have always regarded it as my highest duty to provide for their happi- ness and moral training..   Contizuing the Thread.-     237 "You look at the matter in a different light. Well, perhaps you are right. Woman's impulses are, possibly, safer than man's judgment. I respect, nay admire, the spirit which' prompts such benevolence. If you do err,     it is on the side to which your good and loving heart inclines you. "But, apart from all question of right and wrong, I feel bound to respect your preference in this matter for another reason. The property is your own, and your pleasure must govern in its disposition. I feel that I have no right to interfere, except to aid in the execution of your wishes, which you will always find me, ready to do. "As an earnest of my desire to serve you, I will here mention that I have this day engaged the services of the eminent attorney, Seabry Anthony, Esq., whose reputa-     i tion is a sufficient guaranty of his fidelity, to prepare for my execution such a legal. instrument as will, upon our marriage, secure you in the sole control and disposition of your slaves. As soon as it is completed, I will see that it is submitted for your examination and approval. "And now, dearest Isabella, the onematter, which might have proved an impediment to our union, under other and less favorable circumstances, being happily dis- posed of, let us lose no time unnecessarily in sealing our . happiness. Although, from a life-long association, my manner may at times have appeared cold and undemon- strative, believe me, when I assure you, that I have     i! always lived in the hope of claiming you for my wife. I rejoice that I am now given the opportunity of rendering another proof of my devotion, "I should call upon you this evening, dearest, to re- ceive .from your own sweet lips the plaudit which I know your heart is ready to bestow, did not a pressing duty call me elsewhere. The bed-side of an afflicted friend requires 'my presence; but the consciousness of your approbation will cheer me in the discharge of the work I owe to friendship and humanity.      :        i "With this explanation of what may seem like neglect, I shall hope to see you soon to arrange any preliminaries necessary to our marriage. Your father, I am aware, is .   238      .7The Sisters of Orleans. anxious that the long-deferred arrangement first sug- gested by our parents shall be speedily concluded, and I trust that your own heart will second his zeal. Never- theless, your pleasure in this, as in all else, shall be supreme with       Ever yours, "RUY." "Brandy, Boney!  Some brandy, quick! After that job I need something to brace me up," exclaimed Ruy Grandaville, as he threw his pen aside, and leaned back in his chair. "O, the falsehood there is in the thing," he continued, speaking to his old servant and himself at the same time, "but it can't be helped. I'm in the stream, and can do nothing but go with the current. If Niagara comes in the way, I must take the leap. Money I must have, and so I'll take the chances of matrimony. "Here's to the sweetest woman in Christendom! Boney, she's to be your mistress. A curse on the weak- ness that brings another face before my eyes! It has no business here. The matter is fixed. "Boney, I have an engagement with Colonel Masters to-night. He's the sick man, ha! ha! ha! It will be a stiff game. He got decidedly the best of it the last time. I will not be back 'til morning.

Father is right about Ruy. There is something in blood after all." Such were Isabella Castellos' comments, upon reading Ruy Grandaville's letter, to Aunt Esther. Whatever her private opinion, that old lady had nothing to urge in opposition. "Well, I suppose that settles the matter," continued the young lady. "Really I don't know whether I'm sorry or glad, although I suppose I ought to feel very happy."          .  And in confirmation of her last 'remark, Isabella heaved a long sigh. In due time came the document prepared by Seabry Anthony, the lawyer. It was a most formidable paper, very voluminous, full of legal terms, and had-at the end of it several great broad seals, opposite to one of which appeared the name of Ruy Grandaville, where it had plainly been written by his own hand. The document purported to bestow upon Isabella the authority, after her marriage with Grandaville, to do with her slaves as she might see fit; and she put it carefully away, congratulating herself that the freedom of her people was secure beyond ,all contingency. The lawyer had pointed out to Ruy at least half-a-dozen defects in the instrument, any one of which, he said, would' prove fatal. So the time for the wedding was agreed upon, and Aunt Esther allowed no one to surpass her in the appar- ent zeal with which she labored in the work of prepara- tion.   CHAPTER   V. THE TWO ISABELLAS MEET. THE marriage did not take place at the ap- pointed time. Isabella Castellos was then in bed, languishing with a slow fever brought on by alarm and excitement at the time of the riot. She had escaped without bodily injury, but her agitation had been too great for a nervous organization never strong. She, however, did not appear to be the greatest sufferer. Her afflictions were borne so patiently that even Aunt Esther was unconscious of their full ex- itent, and, perhaps, that faithful servant and nurse experi- enced' greater anxiety from a knowledge of that fact. Ruy Grandaville was keenly irritated by the- interruption in his plans, although to Isabella herself and her father he showed no other feeling than solicitude for her health. Annoyed by duns, constantly increasing in number and importunity, he manifested his vexation by longer sittings with Colonel Masters and similar associates, and by keeping Napoleon Bonaparte, when in his own apart- ment, in a state ofconstant apprehension with threats of selling him to' the Yankee Hawks. fib .But of all the parties concerned, no one was so much disturbed as Ferdinand Castellos. Affection and anxiety for his daughter were, beyond question, partly the cause- of his discomfort; but disappointment in his expectations ;  afflicted him far more. 'He fretted continually and openly. He(.cofmplalned bitterly of the worry which the delay in ; .:.'.?   The Two Isabellas Meet.     241 the wedding was occasioning him. He had hoped to have the matter off his mind. Isabella's sickness was quite as much of the spirit as ,of the body. To Aunt Esther, who had always been a confidant in her troubles, she freely admitted her tortures inspired by the remembrance of Brown, and her supposed responsibility for, his fate, the more keenly regretted be- cause not realized until the evil was done. "You did not know him, mamma," she said one day, "nor did I, until that terrible calamity came upon us. I " t! never dreamt of the nobility that was in his soul, until that fearful hour. O, that my life could be given for his! Too late! Too late! ' How often the image of her late co-laborer recurred to her thoughts, as she lingered from day to day in the pros- tration of disease, and what were the secret meditations of her soul, she alone was fully conscious. It was certain that her countenance took on a mournfulness of expres- sion beyond what sickness would ordinarily occasion, and the heart of her old nurse, who had her own private im- presssion of the cause, bled accordingly. "Mamma," began Isabella, one day, when sufficiently recovered to sit up in her bed supported by pillows, " was there no account published of that terrible affair, giving the particulars of his fate, and showing the disposition made of what remained of him?" Esther understood well enough to whom she referred. "Yes,. chile, the papers tole all 'bout it, 'but you'se should not 'cite yourself with such tings now. Wait 'till  you'se stronger." - , - "I shall not wait, ".replied Isabella with a petulance wholly unusual to her. "I'm strong now."'  Esther interposed no further opposition, but rising, , proceeded to take from a receptacle where it appeared ".   242      Thze Sisters of Orleans. to have been carefully deposited, a journal containingta full account of the mob. Without comment, she handed it to her young mistress. Hastily did Isabella run her eye over the report of the publics meeting preliminary to the riot, her hand shak- ing a little, and her brow growing deathly pale, as she came to the' account of Ruy Grandaville's share in that portion of the proceedings; but she said nothing to indi-' cate her agitation. Silently she continued to read, and pretty soon the pallor on her face was succeeded by an unusual flush, and her-eye fairly sparkled with excite- ment, as she came to a statement of the protracted and heroic resistance whicfl Charles Brown had made to the :mob. It was plain to be seen, from her rapid breathing and her animated countenance, for which party her sympathies were enlisted. Then suddenly She gave a scream; the paper dropped from her hand; and she fell back upon the pillows. "Ruy, his murderer!" was all she said. Aunt Esther ran to her as quickly as she could, and sup- ported her in her arms. Her mind appeared to be wan- dering. She imagined herself back in the school-room of the old Triangle'.Building, and was striding to restrain the mob from inflicting violence upon some one. Sud- denly she seemed to recognize a familiar countenance., "O, spare him, Ruy!" she piteously exclaimed. "He will not injure you. He is kind and gentle and good." Then she screamed out in her agony, and began to talk incoherently, as if she saw some one bleeding and dying in her presence. It was not long that the struggle con- tinued, Her strength was not equal to the strain. Un- consciousness ;'succeeded, accompanied With n' almost total suspension of the bodily functions, and it was long -before a reaction could be obtained.     -   The Two Isabellas Meet.    243 A relapse was the consequence, followed by fever and greater prostration than ever. When the disease again took a favorable turn, Isabella was perfectly calm, and made no reference to the inci- dent which had so disturbed her,;or its cause. Esther hoped that the circumstance had' entirely passed from her recollection. She-was, however, surprised and per- plexed not long afterwards by another singular request from the sick girl, which was insisted upon with all the authority of an invalid. "Mamma," she began, "I should like to see my old playmate and namesake, whom I can just make out among the recollections of my childhood." "Gracious me! I tought you'd forgot all 'bout de gal; you war such a leetle ting when dey sent her 'way." "I fear I have been- remiss in my duty, if, for no other reason, on her mother's account, in not hunting. her up before this." "Bless you, chile, dar's nobody got a heart-like yous- self; but my gal's growed so changed, you'se wouldn't know her nohow." " Leave that to me. I insist upon your bringing her here the first opportunity you have. I do so want to see her. You will not fail, will you, mamma?" "No, chile; I'll see 'bout it." A day or two subsequent to the above conversation, Esther having upon some pretext left the room, Isabella was surprised by the unannounced entrance of a tall and graceful female, whose appearance was that of an entire stranger. While there was much that was attractive in her look and bearing, her countenance had an expression so worn and depressed as plainly to tell of recent and severe suffering 6f body or mind. Her manner was lady-like, even diffident, notwithstanding tht singularity of her intrusion. ' .            *   ,    l  .     *,    , * 244      The Sisters of Orleans. The two women looked at each other in unbroken silence, their eyes busy with- the work of examination. Isabella Castellos was the first to speak. Her counte- nance suddenly lighting up with equal intelligence and pleasure, she exclaimed: "It is. I remember everything. Isabella, my early companion!" Scarcely were the words spoken, before -the two women were in each other's arms. The reader could have no desire to be present at the interview that followed. It was full of tears and sad disclosures. At her foster-sister's request, the slave- woman detailed the leading incidents of her sorrowfully eventful life; her surprise at learning the story of her birth; her acquaintance and intimacy with her young master; her bitter ltrial in the death of her child; the suddenly awakened dream  of freedom  and an honest love; and its utter extinguishment in the death of her lover by the hand of her master. "And your master's name is  " "Ruy Grandaville." The utter sinking of the heart with which Isabella Castellos received t&ie confirmation of her worst fear, deprived her of all power of'exclamation. She re- mained like one benumbed, in whom  life has not been destroyed but frozen. There was no altered expression of the countenance to -betray the severity of the shock. She was simply, for the time, left without sensation. Her companion did not even suspect that she had any other feeling than pity, and oppressed with her own un- happiness, was grateful for the silence that ensued.  When Isabella Castellos, through a powerful effort of the will, recovered the power of deliberation, she rejoiced that she had given no sign of the blow she had received,   The Two Isabellas Meet.     245 saying to herself that her companion was already suf- fering enough, without suspecting that her words had brought such agony to another. She even undertook the part of comforter, and administered such consolation as the goodness of her' heart at the moment suggested. With miany assurances of continuing affection, the two Isabellas then separated. Aunt Esther did not return to the sick room until some time after the visitor had left. Isabella Castellos was anxiously, even nervously, awaiting her. "O, mamma," she began, almost as soon as the old nurse had appeared, "there is a question I do so much wish to ask you, but I'm afraid you would not like it." "No, chile, dar'se nuffin you'se can ax dat I'll not like to answer." "oPerhaps I ought not to inquire, but is-is not Isa- bella-your Isabella-my sister?" There was no immediate reply, and, after a moment's delay, the speaker went on: "I noticed something in her countenance, when she first appeared, which so reminded me of my father. All the time we were talking,' I could not help recalling my father in her every look and word. You will pardon me, I know, if I have done wrong." / "O, chile! you'se hab guessed it; you'se hab guessed it. Bella. an' you'se is, indeed, children ob de same fad- der. My chile war born a leetle de fust; oderwise, when you'se war babies, you'se might hab passed fur twins." "An' now you'se understand," resumed Esther, after a pause in which both women had been engaged with their own thoughts, ' why I'se been so 'sistent 'gainst you'se , marryin' Ruy Grandaville. Dat man's already 'stroyed de happiness ob one ob my children; an' O, Bella.! when you'se does seem so much' like my. own flesh an' v    -246     The Sisters of Orleans. blood, can you'se wonder dat I'se don't want him to hab de oder?" "O, mamma, you are so good! How can I ever repay you. for your love and watchfulness? You mean well, but it is too late; too late. I must marry Ruy Granda- ville.'" Must marry! What does you'se mean, chile?" "I mean that it is clearly a duty to those I love to do X so. Ruy Grandaville, I admit, is not-the person I should select for my husband, were I choosing for myself; but, alas! I am only one of many parties concerned. My father' " "Your fadder wouldn't certainly 'sist, if he'se know'd -all. He'.TSs you'se dearly. Why, doesn't you'se go, strait' tell him he'se gwine to break you're heart?" , 'Wy father loves - me dearly, devotedly; but his views are very different from mine. In his eyes Ruy Granda- ville is an honorable man, and it would be vain to at- tempt to persuade him otherwise. His faith in blood is unbounded. It has become with him a philosophy almost as' steadfast as his religion, and Ruy Grandaville's father was his trusted friend. He measures Ruy by his father's example. If he were even told all we know, it would not greatly shake his belief.- He has been reared in the midst of slavery, and looks with a tolerant eye upon its vices. He would call Ruy's conduct, in heading the mob that murdered my poor, dead friend, chivalrous. And as for his dealings with your daughter, how can we expect one to sit in judgment, who took the same advantage of his position with the mother? No, no; an appeal to my father would be vain. He has set his heart upon this marriage. It has been with him a cherished scheme for years. He is now an old man, feeble both in body and mind, and I do believe that to break off the arrangement   The Two Isabellas Meet.     247       l and defeat the provision he has so long contemplated for the family honor and my happiness, as he regards it, would kill him. I cannot think of such a thing." "Chile, you'se is a bery anlgel." "Then, there are my own people," continued Isabella. "By marrying Ruy Grandaville, I secure their freedom at once, which, in case I should die before the age at which I am authorized to act alone in their behalf, might never come. Ruy's disinterestedness in their case goes very far to compensate for all else that he .may have done." "Dat's a fac'." "And lastly, there are two other parties deeply inter- ested in my marriage with Ruy Grandaville. They are yourself, mamma, and my sister. You know you wanted freedom papers for yourself and your daughter. I have arranged to obtain such a document as you'wisl from my father, but as Ruy Grandaville is the legal? owner of your daughter, it can only show his desire that Whe should be made free. As Ruy's wife, I can insist up1l his com- pliance with my father's wish; but otherwise, ais Isabella is his own absolute property, I have no right, no claim, to ask her liberation at his hands." "Do you know, mamma, what I have- been thinking of," continued the speaker, " since I have met my sister? Here, where slavery prevails, you and your daughter can never be respected, even if you were free. The prejudice against color is so intense that nothing can withstand it. But away up North there are places where there never was any slavery, and where that prejudice cannot be so strong. There you and Isabella could live respected and happy. I have been thinking that, as soon as you are both free, I can secure you a home there, and you and my dear sister, in your new life can soon forget       *                   ,   248   i  The Sisters of Orleans. all the sorrowful past. Nou do you thi k the sacrifice on my part will be too great '   \ ' "Bless you! bless you, chile! you'se is too good! too good! You'se willin' to gib far more dan we'se hab any right to aix. No, chile, no; it can't be on our 'count, nohow!. I'se an ole woman now, an' while I can stay with you, I'se don't want my freedom. . An' as for Bella, She'se suffered 'bout all de wrong Massa Ruy can 'flict. Why should de remnant ob my ole days, or de balance ob Bella's broken, widdered life, from which all de ver- dure's clean gone, be made de'cuse fur de sacrifice ob you'se fresh young heart? O, chile, its axin' too muclh! too much!"        1 The tears with which this disclaimer was accompanied, gave conclusive proof of the old woman's sincerity. Isa- bella was profoundly touched, and in the beneficence of her nature hastened to administer such consolation as was within her reach. "But, mamma, you have not heard all of my argument. The sacrifice is not one thousandth part as great as you suppose. It is true that, after all I have learned, I can- not even respect Ruy Grandaville; but that is iot the only reason why I cannot give: him my heart; I have no heart to give. It would be a crime for me to marry any one worthy to be loved. My heart is buried. Its in the grave with the only man I ever met who, I now know, deserved it wholly, and to whom it, could have been wholly given. I never knew it until here, within-the quiet'of my sick-chamber, I had nothing to do but to think. Lying here, with all the events of the last' few weeks crowding upon my mind, the noble qualities of that brave man who laid down his life in the cause of the lowly and oppressed, sharing with me, alas! to his own undoing, a labor of love, came before me in such bright   The Tzeo Isabellas Meet.    249 array, that suddenly it burst upon me that I loved him, and loved him with an affection that can come but once. I could not realize that he was dead. It seemed that we were both alive, and that our hearts were in communica- tion. I thought I heard his voice, telling a tale of -sur- passing sweetness, and pleading for the return of an over-: mastering passion. I know that my impressions-were, in part, the fancies of a disturbed imagination, generated by a diseased body, but the effect upon my spirit has been unmistakably real. It may be folly for me jo surrender to such a feeling, for I knew nothing of his feelings towards me. When he was alive, he never spoke of love, and now he is gone;but the sentiment which his memory has awakened is such that I can never, never love another." "An' if dat poor dead man, dat Massa Brown you'se speakin' ob, war livin' now, an' war to tell you what he tought, fur I'se 'spect his labors fur de cullud people war as much 'count ob de teacher as de scholars, would you'se 'sent den to drop Massa Ruy fur de abolitioner?" "Hush mamma! How can you ask such a ques- tion? He is dead, and to speak of such a thing only gives rise to fancies that leave a deeper gloom behind them." a Forgib me chile! I'se wrong an' you'se right; you'se allers is. But dar, dat's talk 'nough now. You'se not strong yit. Better be quiet an' sleep." Soon the sick girl, overtaxed with exertion and excite- ment, slept peacefully. The old servant continued to gaze upon her long after slumber had closed her eyes and deadened her senses. Her look showed that an in- ternal conflict was going on. At one moment the expres- sion was full of the sweetest affection, and then a dark, vengeful frown would settle upon her countenance. At II-   250       The Sisters of Orleans. last, rising and standing over the pale and exhausted sleeper, she muttered half audibly: "Dar'se no help fur it; it must be done." What it was that, to the mind of the old slave woman, was unavoidable, and which necessitated some decisive action, the reader will learn as the story unravels; but now it is proper that we should turn to the movements of other actors in' these scenes. , -      .  . !"?     ^   CHAPTER VI. THE SWAMP-SQUATTER'S HOME AGAIN. in the chapter which last introduced the reader to that unhappy domicile. Walker had said nothing further to excite the suspicions of the woman at the head of his household, and he, in his own mind, was(entirely satisfied that the rough treatment he had administered, had wholly exorcised the spirit of rebellion or, that occasion displayed. Confidence, how- ever, on either side, was fully restored. The mother narrwy watched her master's movements, full of appre- hension on account of her eldest and favorite child. Nor was she without ground for disquietude. Walker had, on more than one occasion of late, brushed his hair and paid some attention to his personal appearance, before absenting himself from his home. A proceeding so un- usual she believed could not be without a hidden mean- ing, and she did not fail to draw the most unfavorable conclusion. On one of those occasions the squatter did not return to his cabin at the usual time. He was absent all night and part of the next day. When he did return, he was accompanied by a tall, dandyish man who, although a stranger to Walker's household, was no othethan Hawks, the Yankee negro trader. Having seated the visitor as comfortably as possible in the main apartment of his house, the master bade the   252      The' Sisters' of Orleans. "old gal'" get them something, to eat,. at the same time roughly intimating that she should cease her staring at the stranger. "Take sumthin' ter brace yer after yer journey?" said the host to the new-comer.  ! "Don't care if I does," replied the latter. "Lou, yer gaping nigger, git that jug ov whiskey from under the: bed, an'-be quick about it," directed-the squat- ter. The whiskey depository was duly produced. "Now the cup," added the master. The article last referred to happened to be on a high shelf, which compelled the girl to stand on tip-toe to reach it. Having got it into her possession, she stood apparently undecided what to do with it. "Why don't yer pour some fur the gentleman? Hasn't yer got no manners nor gumption?" exclaimed Walker. i   Thus prompted, the girl poured out a cupful of the liquor, and timidly presented it to the Yankee. He took it from her hand, but instead of raising it to his lips, sat insolently studying the shrinking young crea- ture before him, inspecting her face, her hands, her feet, and her whole form with perfect composure. The exam- ination having been continued to his satisfaction, he raised the cup to his lips, and disposing of the contents at a draught, handed it back to the waiting girl. That done, Lou was ordered to get her father's pipe; then to bring a cup of water for the stranger; and in that way, with one direction after another, she was kept constantly employed in the presence of the two men until dinner was ready,- when she was required to wait upon her master and his guest at the table. 'Her mother, during all this time, although forbidden to stare at the stran(er, was by no means unobservant. %s      The Swamp-Squatterss Home Again.   253 By means of stolen glances, she pretty closely observed the Yankee, discovering that his eyes continually fol- lowed the girl in all her movements; and more than Once she detected glances of intelligence passing be- tween him and her master. When the repast was finished, Hawks and Walker left the house, taking seats under a tree near by, for greater coolness, as was remarked; but in such a osition that no one could leave thebin without passiqnder their observation. "A likely article that, I tell yer," began the squatter by way of opening the conversation, indulging at the same time in a good-natured chuckle-. "'Spect yer don't often come across sich in yer dealin'." "Purty fair," replied the'Yankee with an air of indif- ference. "'Purtv fair, but she doesn't 'pear strong." "But," replied Walker, with a perceptible fall of the. countenance, " consider the looks and the blood." "The looks is all well enough," rejoined Hawks, "but there's two sides to the blood question. While the whiter shades does fetch a leetle the highest figger in the market, the risk ov the thing is far greater. The devil seems to be in white blood, when it gits mixed with the nigger. The yaller ones I've allers found worse to con- quer and harder to hold than the real charcoal. They're more inclined to run off, and more difficult to catch when they does run. There's more grit in them sort, too. I had one on 'em once, jist about the stripe ov that gal ov yourn, who, when she found I wasn't goin' to 'low no foolin', jist went an' drowned herself out ov pure spite, involvin' the loss ov a clean thousan' dollars. There's a mighty sight ov cunnin' in 'em, an' you never knows whether you've got a fortin' or nothin' at all. I doesn t want to say nothin' agin the blood, seein' that, probably, J"    254      The Sisters of Orleans. there's some ov your own with it, but to my notion, it doesn't add much to the value of the property." "Well," said Walker, more and more disheartened by his companion's talk, " what will yer give fur her, any- how?" 4"What'll you take?" was the Yankee's characteristic reply. It is unnecessary to follow the negotiation through its various stages; suffice it to say that, after a great deal of dicker, a bargain was concluded, whereby Lou was to become the Yankee's property for seven hundred and fifty dollars. The trade completed, the Yankee arose, and putting his hands to his lips, sent forthSa sharp and peculiar whistle, in response to which, .coming out of thie dense forest where they must have been in waiting, two mounted men - appeared, each leading an extra horse. When the stran- gers had come up, Hawks took out a piece of paper partly covered with printed matter, and a pen and pocket ink- stand. Having filled up certain blanks in the printed instrument, he handed paper and pen to Walker, blurting out as he did so: ( Here, old feller, put your fist to this here document. Its the bill ov sale that you've to sign." The squatter merely looked at the paper in an irreso- lute sort of way. O, I see how it is," observed Hawks. "Your educa- tion doesn't embrace writin'. School houses, I reckon, wusn't plenty where you wus brought up. No difference, your cross will do allithe same." The squatter having attached a mark to his written name, and the new-comers having duly witnessed the instrument, Hawks coolly folded it up and put it in his pocket. Then, taking out his pocket-book, he delib-   The Sw  am ssp- Squatter's -lHome Again. 255 with hungry eyes, eagerly held out his hand for the money. "Not yit, old feller," said the Yankee, twisting the bills  into a roll and slipping them into his pocket. hat's not the way I does business. The money goes when the property comes.

There sat the mother with a quiet look of unconcern upon  her face, but  the daughter was now here to be In vain was the woman asked .concerning the missing girl. She satin d ogged silence, wholly refusing t o open her lips. Equally unavailing was the search that was instituted. L  ou was no where to be found about the g"aDidn't I  tell youm" said the Yankee, "that thems the slipperiest kind. There izzn't much about a nigger that I don't know; I've handled so many ov 'em." What's ter be done?" asked Walker, thoroughly non-- plussed, and turning appealingly to Hawks. "Wehat's to be done?" repeated the Yankee some- what pompously. th Either we've got to give up the game, or make that old 'un tell where the yungm'un's hid. She knows the spot, and its not fulr off neither." "But how's she ter be made tell?" asked Walker. "  How is shetobemade tell? repliedHawks. "In one ov two w  bays We've either got to flog it out ov her, or make her cry murder till te you un hearsher yel- lin', an' then she'll come out ov her hole quick enough.

There's a mighty sight ov feelin' among them sort ov Yankee   -. ne JIsters ojf Urleavs. critters; more, I've sometimes thought, than among their betters. -What do you'say?" "Go ahead," growled Walker. Threats proving useless to wrest the secret from the mother, preparatibns were made to employ force, The woman's back was bared to the waist, and one of Hawks' assistants, whose eyes fairly gloated ,at the prospect be- fore him, took his station, whip in hand. " Whish " came the first cut of the lash, and a straioht white line appeared on the bare flesh from shoulder to shoulder. But sharp as the pain must have been, the woman merely grinned a bitter smile, and pressed her teeth more firmly together. Then came another blow and another, and another; and so they continued to fall until the blood trickled down the flayed flesh, and the strong man plying the scourge, suspended his work from sheer exhaustion. But while the smile upon the victim's face had given way to an expression of intense agony, not a sound had issued from her lips. "Waal, that's grit, anyhow," said the Yankee, "but there's another trick that'll bring it out, if anything will." With that, Hawks took the lash of the whip that had been in use, tied it so as to form a small loop, and hav ing'first put the whip-handle through it, slipped it over the: woman's thumb. Ngo w," said he to his assistant, "give it a twist, but go slow." The man commenced slowly to turn the stick, bringing a constantly increasing pressure upon the thumb. The pain 'must have been excruciating. The blood, forced out from below the nail, fell off, drop after drop. But still the woman, though sinking down upon the floor from weakness caused by pain and loss of blood, did not even utter a groan. Her face, at one moment, was fiery   The Swanp)-Squatter's Home Again.   257   red; the next deathly pale. A bloody foam began to ooze from her lips. "Stop," suddenly exclaimed the Yankee.  Blast me, if she izzn't fainted-or dead." It was true. The poor creature had become insensible, and lay without sign of life or feeling. " Its no use," said Hawks. "She's the devil hisself, or his daughter."  "Don't yer be uneasy," he added, as Walker showed some concern, not for the woman's sake, but at the prospect of losing a valuable piece of property. "She's not gone yit. I've seen dozens ov 'em brought to that afore. Them sort stand a sight ov killin' afore they peg out. But that does'nt bring the gal. There's jist one chance left." "What's that ?" asked Walker eagerly. " Jist wait a bit, an' I'll show ye." With that the Yankee put his hands over his mouth, and began to imitate the sounds likely to be made by a person in distress. -First came groans and feeble cries, followed by shrieks and prayers, as of one undergoing some terrible punishment; but delivered in tones so: shrill and womanish, that any one not seeing the author would have believed them to come from female lips. "What d'you think ov that?" he asked, as he paused for breath. " Wonderful," replied Walker. "You see," said Hawks, "I've been so long among niggers, an' heard so much ov their cryin' and pleadin', mothers fur their children, and children fur their mothers, that the thing now- almost comes nateral to me. Its got to be a sort ov second language. But now, you fellers, listen sharp when I try it on agih. I'm agoin' to give an extra touch."        -  25-8     The Sisters of Orleans. 4 Sure enough, with that the Yankee commenced scream- ing and wailing once more, imitating the female voice in a most surprising manner. Having gone through a suc- cession of shrieks, he suddenly cried out. "Come, come, Lou! Save me, chile, save me! O, I'm dying! Fur de Lor' sake, come quick!" Then followed a scream so loud and piercing that it really seemed like an expiring effort, and all was still. At once all ears were strained to catch any responsive sound.      - They were not to listen in-vain. "Mother! mother!" came a wailing voice, but so faint as to be barely distinguishable. "That'S the gal," said -Walker, exultingly. "We'll have her now." But the victim of deceit was not to be secured so easily. Distinct as the voice was, all were at a loss to -tell from whence it proceeded. It seemed to issue from the ground at their feet. As an inspection had already been made beneath the floor of the cabin, the four men looked in each other's faces with a stare of blank per- plexity.  Hawks was the first to suggest a solution of the mystery. "Sounds," said he, "as if that voice might come from a  well or cistern." The idea was at once acted on. Outside the cabin,.but almost beneath an opening in the wall that answered for a window, was a well which - supplied Walker's household with water for cooking and drinking. Down in that dark cavity, as the men bent over the curb surrounding it, just above the water's -surface, was seen the pale face of her they were seeking, looking'up with a sad, pleading expression. When Hawks and her -   The Swanp-Sguatter's Home Again.    259 father had been discussing her purchase outside of the I  house, she had easily passed out of the window, which was on the farther side of the- building from where they were sitting, and had descended into the well, which hap- pened not to contain water enough to cover her without her stooping, and where she would have been secure from detection but for her own betrayal. She was soon drawn up from her hiding-place, when, springing from her captors, she rushed into the house, and threw herself, with a piteous cry, upon the prostrate form of her mother, just then returning to consciousness. 0, chile, chile, dis am wuss dan death!" exclaimed: the poor woman, when sufficiently recovered to under- stand the situation.

CLA AND HS PATIENT. 1-"HE 'progress of my story now requires our return once more to the neighborhood of -the old Triangle Building-not to enter, for- "--(i   although several weeks had passed since the riotttverable structure remained a ragged and ten- antaess wreck. Not one of its former occupants had re-. , turned, partly prevented by fear of further violence, and partly by a superstitious dread of a place so vividly asso- ciated with scenes of blood and murder. It stood deso- late and repulsive. A curse seemed to be upon it. Passing by that silent and empty structure, we would have found ourselves in a narrow street which was evi- dently the quarter of a numerous population. There was little evidence of wealth to be seen, and none of luxury. The first floors of houses which were rarely over two stories high, were mostly occupied with shops of unpre- tending character, while the upper rooms were used as dwellings by the proprietors and their families. It was a street inhabited almost exclusively by free persons of color. ' Passing, at the time of which I am now writing, by a certain building in the street referred to, and externally : among the- most respectable it contained, at any}hour between midnight and morning, we would have been led to suppose that every one belonging to it was buried in profound repose. It appeared perfectly dark and quiet. ,Had we, however, attempted in the body to enter it, we   Dr. Clay and his Patient.    261 should have been met by a watchful sentinel stationed upon the only stairway leading to the upper rooms from the street, who would have stoutly disputed our passage. But by availing ourselves of the incorporealism with which both writer and reader in cases like this are en- dowed, and passing the warden unseen, we might have. made our way to a good-sized room on the upper floor where, even at that hour, we should have found several persons, not merely awake, but manifesting a deep-solic- itude about something in their midst. The party con- sisted of three men and one woman. 'then they ad- dressed each other it was in whispers, ant all their move- ments betokened extreme wariness. Looking about for an explanation of such unusual watchfulness and caution, we would have found it in the indications of a sick cham- ber. On a small table were to be seen a number of vials and apothecaries' preparations, while the atmosphere of the room was oppressive with the odors of drugs and medicines. But more conclusive still was an object stretched upon a bed in the centre of the apartment, neatly hidden by the cover of a snowy sheet. A closer inspection would have revealed that-object to be a man, although the first impression obtained in the dim light that filled the chamber would have been that it was no' longer a living being. The face, which was that of a white man, besides being nearlyconcealed by patches and bandages, was pale, haggard and death-like, and the body lay perfectly passive. One of the men already spoken of, at the time we are supposed to enter the room, was bending over the bed, with his ear near tothe object referred to, while his com- panions appeared to be anxiously awaiting his decision. They were all colored persons, or at least had colored blood in their veins.    '    262     '.The Sisterls of Orleans. i "Tank de Lor' he sleeps! - De crisis is past," said the man, rising from his stooping posture, and speaking in a whisper just loud enough for the others to hear, at the same time eljoining silence by a motion of the hand. A sigh of relief was the only response. "Now let's all 'tire," continued the speaker, who evi- dently exercised a considerable authority over the others, "'cept Esther. She had better stay 'til he wakes. He'll be rational den, if tings go as I'se 'spects. He'se been a-callin' on his mudder, which shows dat he'se got a mudder somewhar, an' Esther habs de mudderly look.

'   ' T, he words of the speaker were obeyed without a ques- tion by his-- companions. All left the room except the female called Esther, and whom the reader will readily recognize as the Aunt Esther who appears in several of the preceding chapters. She took her seat by the side of the bed, and as the quiet hours wore on, attentively kept watch over the object that was lying so passively there, But' while that silent watch continues, it may be as well to satisfy the reader's curiosity concerning the person who appeared to give direction to all movements in that dimly-lighted and closely-guarded chamber. He was a person--well known in New Orleans' at the time of which I am writing, where he went by the name of, Doctor Clay. Although a mulatto, he was a man of i,some attainments, and was. reputed to possess more than ordinary skill in some branches of the profession that gaive him his title. His career had been a singular one. Born -a slave, he had, for several years prior to, the date of his introduction to the reader of these pages, enjoyed    Dr. Clay and his Patient.    263 quite an extensive practice as a physician. Fortune had  stood his frierfd by making him, while a boy, the property of a gentleman who, besides being a distinguished prac- titioner of medicine, was a man of just and liberal views. Taken into his master's office in the capacity of an errand boy, he speedily displayed considerable aptitude for the business of his owner. Hence he came in time to be entrusted with the preparation of drugs, and in some instances was allowed to fill some of the more simple prescriptions. But the slave progressed even faster than his master gave him credit for. Being present at consul- tations, and when important surgical operations were per- formed, in some of which his services were required, he suffered no act or word to pass unobserved; while, having managed to acquire a knowledge of reading, he gathered from his master's library a store of information which no one suspected him to possess. The opportunity for its practical application came in due season. A colored man who had met with a painful and dan- gerous bodily injury, was one day brought into the office of Clay's master during the physician's absence. The sufferings of the wounded man were intense, and his case, to all appearances, was one demanding immediate atten- tion ; but Clay did not at the time know where his master was, nor when his return might be looked for. Hastily examining the case, he conceived the idea that he tin- derstood the treatment required, and, moved with com- passion for the sufferer, he seized his master's instru- ments, and proceeded to perform a really difficult, but successful, operation. When the physician returned, he found the wounded man quite comfortable, and every- thing indicating a satisfactory termination of the case. He immediately inquired by whom the operation had been performed, supposing one 'of his professional breth-    264, .    The Sisters of Orleans. ren had, opportunely been at hand. Clay was standing by, and at once began to tremble, anticipating summary punishment when it was discovered what he had pre- sumed to do. His master would have found it difficult to credit the information he received from others who were present, had not the terrified expression of the slave's countenance confirmed what he heard. Then, upon instituting an inquiry; he learned the extent to which Clay had prosecuted his unaided studies. He was alike surprised and gratified. His benevolent heart de- cided him upon a course of action. "Clay," said he, " would you like to be a doctor?" 4 "Yes, Massa." "And why would you like to be a doctor?" "Dat I'se might help de 'flicted cullud folks dat habn't got nobody like you'se, Massa, to 'sist dem when dey'se sick." ' "Good for you, Clay!" said the kind-hearted physi- cian. :"I see you have the stuff in you, and the motive ; t bring it out. Nobody has any right to keep such a - nattire'as that in slavery. You shall have your wish." -. '^ With that, Clay's master told him that, for'a certain - time, he should have every facility his office could afford ; ' to perfect himself in a knowledge of medicine; and if' : -e made a, good use of the opportunity, at the end of :: 7 that timelhe should have'his free papers.  - ::"'ou are my property," said the master, "and I am not a :rich man; nevertheless, I ask no return for myself : for-what I give you. Should my family, however, in case - of my'death, ever be in need. of assistance, I hope you w. ' Will- remember, for their sake, what I have done for-you." : The, speaker:  sgood as his word; and in due : ;:time Clay we^nt forth,  having diligently profited by his -:-? '   I{ iibetait,': a free man; and prepared to practice L , :r o w -    Dr. Clay and his Patient.     265 successfully the profession to which he had given his study and his heart. Within the sphere to which his labors were devoted, he became an instrument of great  good. The -colored population of New Orleans had abundant reason to be grateful for services which were never denied to the humblest and poorest of their num- - bers. To them his time and skill were cheerfully given, although, as his reputation increased, there were not wanting white persons who gladly availed themselves of his knowledge, and members of the medical profession, holding a high position, had in certain cases been known to consult his views. He might have rapidly accumu- lated property, but that seemed not to be his aim.-/- The motive which governed his life went no further than the improvement of the race with which his destiny had become identified, although that purpose did not shut out the grateful remembrance of such members of the' other race as had, by their kindness, placed him under obligation. His old master had died soon after he had- become successfully established in his new calling, leav- ing a family behind him illy prepared for the struggle. they were compelled to encounter. Then it was that the former slave proved himself the devoted and useful friend, rendering assistance to widow and children which many times over repaid the price he would- have commanded upon the auction block. Such was Doctor Clay. The first rays of the morning were fighting a successful  battle with the powers of night; typical of the strife thAt was going on within that silent chamber between health    I and sickness, life and death, when the 'object that had . been reposing so quietly under the watchful guardianship of Aunt Esther, began to exhibit signs of animation.  There was a slight movement of the cover, a low, sad .  -.. moan as 7extorted by pain, a feeble endeavor .to effect a  I2    266     - The Sisters of Orleans. change of position, which was a- failure, and then, after a moment of stillness, faint and tremulous came the one word:                    , "Mother."   - "Here, chile, I'se with you'se," responded the old * woman, bending-forward and pressing a kiss upon the brow of the speaker.                  ; The voice was evidently strange to the sick. man, and j yet there was nothing to show that the effect was other than agreeable. Slowly opening his eyes, he looked up into the face of the sympathizing attendant. "You--you are not my mother-are you,?" The words came slowly, showing that the invalid's fac- ulties-were yet in a state of considerable bewilderment. "No, chile, I'se not you'se nateral mudder, but I'se you'se friend; an' I'll be you'se mudder, too, if you'se let me." The last words were accompanied with another appli- ,cationof the lips. The effect -was manifestly soothing. A grateful Ismile faintly passing over the sick man's fea- tures was his reply. There was a lapse of a minute, during which the inva. - lid's eyes were closed. Then suddenly opening them, -as his body gave' a convulsive start, and looking up ! wildly in Esther's face, he asked: .  "Where am I?"  --' "You'se with you'se friends, safe an' a-growin' well." -;-The? reply did not seem to be sufficient. The sick man's. eyes :stared still more wildly, and his face lighted up with a flush that contrasted strangely with its former pa!lor, as he continued to speak - "I remember now; They were all about me--and the pistol. I It-it is  '::: Nobody but de cullud folks dat's here." '    i Dr. Clay and his Patient.    267    ' The words were Dr. Clay's.    /   -  The strange voice arrested the sick man's attention,  and, seemingly, at once changed the current of his     v thoughts. His eyes looked inquiringly into those of the  speaker. The result was evidently satisfactory and as- -  suring. A glance of confidence passed between the two men. "How did I come here?" asked the sick man calmly.     "Not now," replied Dr. Clay.  "Some oder time we'se tells you'se. You'se ben sick-had bad dreams-    J is weak. Dar, no more talk! 'Must hab quiet. When  you'se stronger, we'se tells you'se all." ' Again the sick man closed his eyes peacefully and  gratefully, and again, suddenly rousing up, he inquired:  "And she-she, I say-is she safe?"          :! "She is safe," replied Aunt Esther,. seeming at once to catch the meaning of the words.        .  ;  I "Thank God! ' exclaimed the sick man, sinking back  upon his pillow apparently quite exhausted. :His repose, however, was not of long duration. Again rousirgs:-up,  and looking anxiously in the faces of his companions, he began:      '              - "Is she-is she  "              - Then, as if changing his mind, the speaker closed':iis  eyes with a moan. Dr. Clay was thankful for quiet event thus, and administering a soothing potion, soon had the-  satisfaction of seeing his patient breathing regularly 'in  the midst of healthful slumber. He then took his de-   I parture, but before going, :he laid a strict injunction upon those left in charge, that 'there was to be no unnecessary conversation-no excitement .               i    CHAPTER -VrIL IN THE SICK ROOM. : jt.

Brown endeav- ored to spring to her assistance, but found that he could - not stir from where he was. Again and again did he strive to break the spell, that held him fast, but in vain; until, in utter agony of spirit, he cried out with despair. At once the vision fled at the sound of his voice, and he awoke to find himself in his own sick-room.        ; "Chile, chile, what am de trouble,? Dartse no one    A here but friends."

The flame that had illum- ined it for a moment had been quenched in blood, leav- ing nothing but ashes behind. Look whithersoever she might, she could discover nothing but night, rayless and perpetual. She uttered neither complaint nor lamenta- tion. Yet her changed appearance told how fatal was her grief. Her eye had lost its fire, her cheek its full- ness, her frame its elasticity, and years appeared to have been added to her age. Her flowers were forgotten; her . musjic was abandoned; and those out-door exercises which -: had before brought health and forgetfulness of harrowing reflections, were no longer indulged. She did not sur- ' render all employment, but continued to exercise her - accustomed control over the plantation in a mechanical  sort of way, which showed that she was fast settling down d / into the stereotyped existence of the slave. .    : Whatever had been the rdal state of her feelings.  towards Solorgne prior to his Heath, when a desire for  freedom probably influenced her quite as much as any - positive ,love, the events that have been related worked a ; thorough revolution in her mind.

The poor girl was sorely puzzled by that view of the case, ' and hardly knew how to frame her answer. She still -.io0ved Isabeila, and her heart told her that in the latters -grfeat distress was no time to leave her; yet she found it very hard- to deny her lover. In this dilemma she had ,'finally concluded to go to Isabella and tell the whole story of her embarrassment. To her surprise, her mis-, tress approved of Jefferson's resolution not towed, except upon the condition of a trial for freedom, and promised a :hearty co-operation in their schemes for reaching a land Pf'!liberty.- Upon her suggestion a day for the wedding - was' fixed, and preparations were begun for a merry- 'mmakling, under'.cover of which, it-was expected, that the :ine*wly -wedded pair could be well on their way Northward before their absence wouldbe observed. Accordingly, the announcement of the intended mar- - age was made, much to the joy of the other slaves, who -:, Were ready to welcome any promise of amusement. The :bnilyexception was Yellow Jule, who, upon hearing the n^ews, openly proclaimed her astonishment, "dat a nigger ':!, Jefferson would take up with sich a baby as dat Rose."

Before the tirade was finished, tie object of if had fled, and was safe beyond the Dragoness' voice, from which, when pitched in anger, every one on the plantation was accustomed to fly, except her husband -and her son. The first, the ancient Dragon, was so deaf, that he did riot know when it thundered, and the ,second, the restless Frog, cared not for her tongue as long as he could keep beyond the reach of her hand, which his agility generally- enabled him to do. The wedding-day had finally arrived with all its ex- citements and anxieties. The old sensation was quite forgotten in the presence of the new. Even Isabella  found relief in superintending the arrangements for the ; important occasion, and some of the old lustre came back . to her face. The entire strength of the plantation, old-' ' and young, gathered on the lawn in front of the mansion. There the marriage was performed-a most simple pro-': ceedingj consisting of a union of hands, and a mutual pledging of love and fidelity, according to the form of words in use among the negroes. ' But unostentatious'as  the ceremony was, many there .are that are wedded be-. neath lofty arches and by surpliced priests, who would- gladly exchange hearts with that -simple pair that did not even own the hands with which they bound their troth. The scene was cheerful and inspiring. The bride was blooming and happy, and Jefferson, whose blow, even on  that festive occasion, wore a thoughtful expression, almost forgot the trial that was before him, as he looked into the ,.

' After the'marriage, came the great event of the day-- the dance.". The proudest man there was old Eph, the h head&;wagoner of the plantation, who, fiddle in hand, and-supported by one assistant handling ti bones, and :'another straining at a home-made flageolet? and seated high upon a temporary platform, led the music and gave ?direction to the movements of the dancers. There was barely an idler to be- seen. Frog, at the head of a bevy of half crazy juveniles, was tumbling about in everybody's way; and even old Dragon with one foot kept step to the measure, of his younger associates while, as for his wife, the Dragoness, the flaming- red Bandanna that adorned her-head, was to be seen flashing hither and thither in the thick of the melee, like a flag in the midst of the battle. ':The enjpyment had reached to'the very highest point, When suddenly the music stopped, and Eph, the leader, was seen with his bow motionless' upon the string, sitting as -if struck with petrifaction. The effect upon the others was almost as immediate. "Wal, I'll be cussed if here izzn't a purty how-de-do. No wonder Grandaville's goin' to the dogs, when his nig- gers is 'lowed to carry on in this 'ere style. He doesn't understand how to manage 'em; that's sartin."   - These words, spoken in a loud, sharp, and slightly tasai tone, first making known the presence of uninvited -:}sts, explained the interruption. The intruders were -tee, in number. Foremost was Hawks, the. Yankee Itrader, and behind him were the two assistants whom we fsiin his company af the home of Walker, the swamp' suatter.. In the.: hands 'of the latter were heavy whips, -. ;^          yefferson and Rose.      281X while about their persons were belts containing each two  revolvers.- Their countenances, as became their calling,  were sensual and brutal in expression. " Sorry to spile your. fun," resumed the Yankee, with a  malicious grin, as he noted the effect the presence of his party-had produced, "but the fact is, we've come on busi--^ ness, and not calculatin' on a dance, have left our pumps at home. You'll, therefore, jist excuse us, until we git -: our little matter 'tended to, and then those of you that's not wanted, can keep up the shindy as long as yer wants to-leastways until you get a master that will find you: somethin' better to do."  "Now Jordan, take charge of the niggers as. I reads off the list.'  The last words were addressed to one of the assist-  ants, whose reply was a crack of his whip, and the dis- play of two scraggy rows of tobacco-tarnished teeth. - "Now you niggers whose names is called," continued Hawks, opening out a piece of paper, "must know that I've bought ye of Ruy Grandaville, and all you has to do is to step out, and be quick about it, or " The conclusion was a significant motion of the head   - towards Jordan, and his whip.; "Washington." ,  The negro bearing that honored name, a broken-spir- -   ited and prematurely aged man, who had been sold and.  resold until he had almost lost the sense of care for any- ".: thing, at once obeyed his new master's direction, by sep- arating himself from the others. "Columbus."  A shriek, loud and piercing, was the 'response, as a  colored woman threw her- arms about a boy of some fifteen years of age. It was clear that they were motherj and son..    282      rhe Sisters of Orleans. It was ,found necessary to separate the two by force, and most summarily was It done by Jordan. Stepping forward, he tore them apart, hurling the woman to the earth with one hand, and ith 'the other dragging the boy to a place by the side of Washington, at the same time :administering:'a few cuffs as a matter of discipline.  Name after name followed, the calling of each being accompanied with more or less violent lamentation, until the' last on the list was reached. Hawks paused, a mo- ment as he came to' it. "This 'un," said he, "must be the pick of the hull lot. Twenty-five hundred dollars is an awful price to give for -a nigger." "Jefferson."  - ,- Rose was standing by the side of her husband, trem- bling with apprehension, and clinging to him for support, as the name of the loved one smote on her ear. Instantly her arms were about his neck, and a cry of agony burst forth, so, intense, so thrilling, that it caused even the Yan- ' kee to look with astonishment. ",What, in the name of all creation," said he "have we.*,here? Wal, I 'declare if this chap izzn't one of the weddeners, and that's the gal. Now, now, don't take it so hard, little snow-ball! It'll be easy for you :to get another feller that's jist as good, and like as not a deal whiter, if that's a recommendation to one ov your sort." * ." Rose heard none of his cruel words. She had fainted. Tenderly disengaging her arms from about his neck, Jefferson laid her upon the soft grass at his feet, and standing erect and. motionless, looked calmly into ithe , face of his new owner.  "Comeon, old feller!" said Hawks. "Now's your time, when the little 'un's quiet.' She'll be comin' to   yefferson and Rose.      283 afore long, and then there'll be, another row. So let's be off. March!"            -  Jefferson moved neither limb nor muscle. "Don't yer intend to mind me?" exclaimed Hawks in a rage. "No," said Jefferson firmly. "Ye don't, hey! don't ye? We'll see about that," cried the Yankee, snatching a whip from one of his atten- dants, and at the same time ordering Jordan to "move that faintin' critter out of the way," referring to Rose. The ruffian, stepping forward to execute his superior's command, was in the act of laying his hand upon Rose's person, when Jefferson, seizing him by the collar, gave him a whirl that sent him spinning round and round like a top, until finally he landed at full length upon the ground. "Seize him!" furiously bellowed Hawks, but at the same time cautiously taking several steps backward, so as to place a greater distance between himself and the dusky Hercules., Jordan was soon on his feet, and he and the other as- sistant made ready for an attack. As for Jefferson, he simply folded his arms across his breast, giving no indi- cation of a purpose to resist. Seeing which, the two men - advanced and seized him, each by an arm, and held him fast.           }) .  "Now jist hold the critter there," exclaimed. the trader, "'til I teach him a lesson he needs to learn. He'll find he's got another master now than Grandaville, who seems to have spoilt his darkies."               - With that, Hawks brought the whip ringing down upon the head arid shoulders of the negro. Sharp as must have been the sting, Jefferson paid not the least attention- to it, his face retaining the same cold and haughty de- rg   284      The Sisters of Orleans. meanor. Then came-blow after blow with the same result, the seeming indifference of the victim only adding to the rage of his persecuto:r. Howr much longer the torture would have continued, it is quite impossible to tell, had not Isabella, just as a heavy blow was about to fall, confronted the Yankee. -The excitements of the day, and especially of that mo- ment, had removed all traces of recent suffering, and as she stood with fresh fire in her- eye and a rising color upon her cheeks she was as beautiful and commanding as at the happiest moment of her life. Hawks lowered the whip he had just poised on high, and, looked in amazement upon the unexpected vision. He had never seen a more lovely woman. "I--I--I beg pardon. H hadn't no notion, really, there was a lady present. I was jist teachin' this nigger . "  "No apology to-me, sir, is necessary," interrupted Isa- bella. ;"I do not ask your indulgence for this poor man, on my-account, but on hers." As she said this, the speaker pointed to Rose, who was then returning to consciousness amid groans and tears. "She is as much entitled to consideration at your ;hands, as I am," continued Isabella. "She-she-a nigger-as much entitled to considera- tion! Then who, in the name of goodness, are you?" -"I am Ruy Grandaville's. property--one of the people belonging to this plantation." Hawks gave a prolonged whistle, and his look of bash- ful deference instantly changed to one of insolent admir- ation. "Wal, I'll swear, if this doesn't beat thunder," he be- gan. "What a place Grandaville has here, to be sure. -Wish I'd know'd this when I was a-tradin' with him. But   efferson and Rose.    ,  285 no difference; we'll have more business. What a mag- nificent critter! A regular picter, as I live! Ha! ha! ha! and so I stopped thrashin' the nigger to pay my respects to one of Grandaville's slaves. That's a good 'un!"              - Having concluded these remarks which, although in the nature of a soliloquy, were spoken in a voice more than ordinarily distinct, the Yankee gruffly bade Isabella stand aside, as he resumed his exercise with the whip. His employment, however, was to meet with further in- terruption. Rose, by this time, fully restored to con- sciousness, rushed forward as the lash fell upon her hus- band's back, and throwing herself at Hawks' feet, with a cry for mercy clasped him about the knees. The Yankee gave her one glance of ineffable contempt. ': G'way, you infernal blubbering wench." And with-that the speaker, raising his foot, gave her a blow in the breast that sent her reeling backward. Catching the insulting word, and seeing the action, Jefferson, at once dropping his immobility, and hurling the two assistants who were holding him from him, as if they were, men of straw, was upon Hawks in an instant, and had clutched him firmly by the throat. The Yankee went down like a broken reed, and his face quickly grew livid under -the vice-like pressure of his assailant's grasp. But ere consciousness had wholly departed, his hand sought his side; something, bright flashed in the sun; and the report of a pistol rang out on the air. Jefferson slowly relaxed his hold, and staggered to his feet. He drew himself to his full height, but stood as if lost in bewilderment. It was for a few moments only. Reaching out his hand as if feeling his way, while his lips moved and a gurgling sound was heard in his throat, he fell heavily and at full length. With a shriek of an-   :286 .    The Sisters of Orleans. guish, Rose threw herself upon his motionless form, and was as silent as himself. By the time Hawks was sufficiently recovered to keep his feet, and take note of the situation, husband and wife had been separated, the latter being in the hands of Isabella and-other females who were applying restora- tives; but the former was beyond the reach of all mortal remedy. "A bad go, by all the devils!" growled the trader, as he stood over his now worthless property, with his foot moving first the head, and then other parts of the body, as he would a beeve or a swine, to see if life was wholly extinct. "Twenty-five hundred dollars gone in a jiffy! But its the only way to deal with niggers. 'Twon't never do to let 'em git the best of ye." "Boys," he added, addressing his two assistants "git the other niggers ready, and let's be out of this place." Then, giving the prostrate body a kick, when convinced that life had wholly fled, he continued: ' This fellow, I calc'late, we'll have to leave to comfort that black wife of his'n, if she ever comes to-hope she won't." ' The balance of the people purchased being fJrmed into line of march, the trader placed himself at the head, while his two assistants brought up the rear, and the pro- cession, amid the wails and prayers of parting friends and relatives, moved slowly away from the plantation As Hawks rode forward at the head of the company, his mind was busy with the incidents of the day. It was not so much the loss of Jefferson, although twenty-five hundred dollars was a large amount in the Yankee's eyes, as the recollection of Isabella that engrossed his thoughts. Passion and vanity alike suggested to him the desirable- hness of her possession.   7efferson and Rose.     287 "Golly, what a magnificent critter!" he said to him- self. "She's an article worth the havin'. Not one of them chaps that puts on-so much style has anything to touch her. With her, I could take the shine off any of 'em. mI'm bound to have her somehow. Grandaville's hard up, and money's the thing that will do it." The reader will have no difficulty in comprehending the motives that influenced the Yankee. Isabella's beauty had captivated his fancy, being of the kind most attract- ive to his coarse nature. But- there was another incen- tive. In the society of fast 'men in which he was ambi- tious to shine, there was as much rivalry in the posses- sion of beautiful slave-women, as elsewhere, with the same class, becomes conspicuous in eager emulation for fast horses and extravagant equipages. In the city of New Orleans, at the time of which I am writing, the pre- vailing system of slavery enabled those so inclined, and having the means, to gratify their tastes in that direction to the full circuit of their pleasure. Hawks, aware of the inferiority of his accomplishments, and often made to feel the contempt of his chosen associates, thought he saw in Isabella the means of acquiring importance in the eyes of the men whose good opinion he was especially anxious to secure. Having, therefore, two inducements to urge him on, he determined to lose no time in making sure Of the prize. Accordingly, on the very next day, he set out for Gran- daville's apartments at as early an hour as he supposed- the latter's habits would justify. His visit could not have been more unfortunately timed. Luck had been unusu- ally perverse the night before; and besides, there was  another cause of irritationjust then operating with Gran-  . daville. Isabella Castellos' health had become so -far restored, that a day for the marriage had again been fixed. ,i   288      The7 Sisters of Orleanzs. This fact, which ought to have been a source of joy to the expectant bridegroom, and which was a consequence of his own urgency, became, on the contrary, the occasion of unanticipated annoyance. Grandaville had never loved Miss Castellos, much as he had respected and admired her, for the reason that he had once devotedly loved the other Isabella; and though his passion had grown dull with satiety, he now found, as he stood upon the brink of matrimony, that the image of his cherished mistress had strangely come to vex him. Do what he could, he had that morning been wholly unable to banish her from his thoughts, or the consciousness that she was still very near to his heart. It was in vain that he con- sidered the folly of such meditations; the face of the slave-girl, as it appeared on the occasion of first meeting her, or at the time of her maturer beauty, or at that mid- night hour before the abandoned cabin in the swamp, when she had stood up before him and demanded the duellist's opportunity for Edmund Solorgne, constantly presented itself, until thoroughly provoked, he had quite lost his temper, and a dozen times over had frightened Napoleon Bonaparte with the threat of immediate sale to the Yankee trader. The consequence was, that the old servant, as he opened the door in answer to Hawks' summons, was so confounded by meeting that individual face to face, that he could do nothing but stand and stare at him, com- pletely blocking the way. The Yankee was too impa- tient for delay, and so quickly shoved past the old negro, giving him, as he did so, a violent push to one side which greatly increased his hostility. Once in the room, Hawks, without noticing Granda- ville's look of irritation, proceeded to recount his expe- rience of the day before, making no concealment of   effersonl and Rose.      289 any of the circumstances attending Jefferson's death. In fact he gloried in the incident, illustrating as it did his boasted method of dealing with " niggers." "He's the second 'un," he remarked with no incon- siderable consequence, "I've- used up fort disputin' my 'thority, though 'tother 'un was regularly killed in the whippin'. I don't 'low no opposition from niggers, but it costs like blazes, as ye can see, to carry out the princi- ple. The trouble is that the most valuable 'uns is the most spunky." Callous as Grandaville had grown under the hardening influences of the life he was leading; such talk only served to increase his disgust for the speaker; while Napoleon Bonaparte, who had been listening with scarcely restrain- able indignation, heartily longed for another cup of scald- ing hot coffee to bestow upon him. "But now to the point," said the Yankee, putting on a business air. "Ye see .I'm not one that talks for talk's sake.  "'Mong other things, I discovered that ye had a likely sort of gal on yer plantation. If she hadn't told me she wus one of your slaves herself, I wouldn't have know'd she wusn't white. Isabeller's the name, I be-- lieve. Now I've took a fancy for that gal, and have come round this mornin' to see what you'll take for her. Bein' as I'm a good customer, and was unlucky with 'tother purchase, I suppose ye wouldn't think of axin' more than twenty-five hundred dollars, the price of the dead darkey. Its a big pile to give for a gal, but as she seems to be sumthin' rather extra, there's the money, if its all right." With that, the Yankee took out of his pocket a roll of bills, and in a free and familiar sort of way held it towards Grandaville. Ruv looked, first at the money, and then at Hawks, I3                    . *,    l90      The Sisters of Orleans. while he seemed to be struggling to keep down the rage that was swelling up within him. It was in vain. Sud- denly bolting from his seat, he made a dash at the Yan- kee and grasped him by the throat: "Insolent scoundrel!" he exclaimed, as he applied a tremendous squeeze, accomparlied with a vigorous shak- ing, " dare you insult me with such a proposition? Sell Isabella to you!-(another shake). I'd give her to the dogs first- Mention such a thing to me again, and I'll give you what you deserve, you villain!-(more choking and shaking). I'll strike you dead on the spot." There was something good in Ruy Grandaville yet. By this time Hawks had grown almost black in the face. Completely taken by surprise, he was too much frightened for resistance, if he had possessed the ability, seeing which, Grandaville relinquished his grasp. "Now," said he, 'out of this, and never let me see your sneaking face again." Then, seeing that the Yankee was too much weakened, or confused, to. stir, he turned to Napoleon Bonaparte, and said: "Boney, help this fellow to his feet. If he don't go willingly, tumble him into the street." The old negro, who was almost beside himself with glee at the performance, obeyed with alacrity. Taking Hawks by the collar, and the Yankee was only too glad to get out of the room, he led him to the door, opened it, and gave him a pitch-then closed the door behind him.   CHAPTER X. A YANKEE TRICK. B T would be useless to venture upon a descrip- tion of the Yankee's fury, when he found himself upon the street, after his ejection from Grandaville's apartments. "The mean, rascally cuss, if he was born on Southern sile!" he began. "He sells me his worthless niggers that I have to shoot, and chokes me when I tries to buy what I wants." Here Hawks had to stop to relieve his throat, as rage, at this presentation of the injustice of which he had been the victim, threatened to do what Grandaville's hands had come so near accomplishing. "But blast himi," he went on, "I'll be even with him yit! I'll have him 'rested for 'sault and battery." And with the enunciation of this dreadful purpose, the speaker started rapidly in the direction of a magistrate's office. But, having reached the door of that functionary, he paused and'stood for some time upon the step, as if in a brown study. Then, turning about, he walked away in another direction. And as he proceeded, gradually the cloud lifted from his brow, and a smile, although bitter and revengeful, appeared upon his face. Broader and broader grew the grin that lit up his features, until he seemed almost ready to break into a laugh, by the time that, having entered a narrow, filthy street, he found him- self before a door over which was the sign: "PATRICK WELDON, BROKER AND AGENT." The room into which the door opened was a gloomy   292      The Sislte's of Orleains. hole. The floor, 'in lieu of carpet, was covered with spittle and litter. The walls werenearly black. The fur- niture consisted of a wash-stand, on which were a handle- less pitcher and a cracked basin, two or three rickety chairs, and a secretary whose pigeon-holes were crammed with dusty papers, and upon whpse open lid were an ink- stand dnd some loose sheets of foolscap. Curled up in one of the chairs, as Hawks entered, was an old man, whose filthy and generally repulsive appear- ance suggested him as the proprietor of the den. He was a thin, skinny creature, with narrow face, scarcely -any hair, and either weak or sore eyes, which kept his hollow cheeks constantly wet with running moisture. He "was very lame, too, as was to be seen when he attempted to walk, having to hobble upon a crutch that had never received any coating except the grease and dirt that had come by use.  His apparel was in keeping with the wearer-coarse, ill-fitting and soiled. Altogether, he was a most wretched-looking object. "How's the devil to-day?  Such was Hawks' salutation upon confronting this ill- favored creature. "You ought to know best.  He always comes when you do, he! he! he!" The old man's laugh was a wheezy cachinnation, most painful to listen to, which ended in a cough so violent that it seemed that the rickety skeleton must explode, anrid'be scattered about the room. By the time Weldon's composure was restored, the Yankee had seated himself in a chair, and elevated his feet upon the secretary's open lid, overturning the ink- stand in so doing, and scattering its contents among the papers lying about. Indifferently regarding the accident which the old man did not observe, Hawks proceeded:   ,A Yankee Trick..     293 ' Got many lame ducks in your trap. these times?" "Some-not many-have you been spotting any? he! he! he!" And again came the explosive cough. "Wal, I reckon I do know ov one that's in purty good order for the pluckin'," responded Hawks, when his com- panion's serenity had returned. "Nobody's so likely to pounce on it as a Hawks, he! he! he!" And at this pun upon the Yankees name, Weldon went off into a fit of coughing more violent than ever. "See here, old man!"'said Hawks, when silence had come, "if you don't quit that he-he-in' and nonsense, one ov these times you'll choke." Hawks stopped short at the word " choke," putting his hand impulsively to his throat, and making a very wry face. "But the duck--the lame duck- who is it? Who is it?"  This was spoken by Weldon with a quick, nervous voice, and without either laugh or cough. "Would you like to jine in the business-the pluckin', I mean?" answered the Yankee with characteristic indi- rectness. "If its safe, if its safe. It must be very safe." "Do you know Ruy Grandaville  ?   "  "I ought to. I've got some of his paper, and its overdue." "Wouldn't wonder. He's mighty extravagant--one ov them chaps that come into the world to spend money, not to make it. They're useful to us, though they do lit on to despise us. Wal, lit 'em." The last two words were ejected with spiteful emphasis.. "But what about Ruy Gra/ndaville?" asked Weldon eagerly.   :94      7he Sisters of Orleans. "Has he paper floating about?" "Plenty of it." "Cheap?"  "( A drug." "Then buy ten thousand dollars of it-that's what I've got to say." "But has he got the money?" -'No; but I have."     ' - "What! will you indorse his paper?" "No; but I know sumthin'." "What is it?" "He's goin' to marry a fortin." . The old man shook his head. "A poor dependence," said he. "The woman may die, or change her mind. Women are uncertain at" best. I've lost a great deal by them. Only last year one deceived me terribly-shamefully." "You don't pretend to say that any woman ever agreed to marry you, does ye?" asked the Yankee, grinning maliciously. "It wasn't .in that way," replied Weldon. "I'll tell you how it was. . You see I'd bought up a young fellow's paper--a quantity of it-cheap-twenty-five cents on the dollar. Another day would have made it all safe, when the unprincipled womana--she was a widow, and twice the boy's age, too-got wind of the debts, and repudiated her engagement. I went to see herlas soon as I heard of her conduct. I put the matter feelingly-told her how much of the poor boy's paper I held, and how poor I was. She just laughed in my face, and offered me a picayune. Then, when in my indignation at her base- ness, I -accused her of dishonesty, She flew into a tem- per, called me an old thief, and ordered a black -man to throw'me out of the house, and he did it."   A   Ya1nkee Yick.      295 The fit of laughter into which the Yankee fell, on hear- ing this doleful story, was long continu'ed. "Wal, wal," said, he, "I doesn't wonder at your bein' shy ov the wirmmin; but in this case the gal has nothin' to do with the property. Listen, and I'll tell ye how 'tis. Grandaville, as I told ye, is goin' to marry a fortin. That will make him anxious, you see, that there shan't be no trouble 'till the wedden's over. .Now Ive had dealin' with Grandaville ov late,- and that's lit, me into the mar- row ov his affairs. I have naterally an inquirin' turn ov mind."              I "Impudence, some call it, he! he! he!" And again the wheezy laugh was followed by the chok- ing and explosive cough. "Now, see here, old fellow," exclaimed Hawks petu- lantly, " this thitg's got to be stopped, or I stop right here. I ain't goin' to stand it, to be blackguarded in that ere sort ov way, nohow." "Go on, go on," said W-eldon, good-humoredly. "Wal, as I was a-sayin," resumed the Yankee, ' I've discovered that Grandaville, spite ov his nonsense and r fast livin', has got property, mostly niggers, that's worth twenty thousand dollars, if its worth a penny. For rea- sons 'taint necessary to explain, its property Granda- ville doesn't want to part with, and for reasons equally of no account to the like ov you, its property I wants'to git. Now there's jist one way ov forcin' it out of his clutches, and'that is by compellin' him to raise a nice little sum of money before he can git married, and'so come into that fortin. And to do. that, I can't think ov no surer way than to set an old dog like you a-dunnin' and pesterin' at. his heels, and worryin' the life out ov him, until he'll raise the money jist to git rid ov ye. ' I know all about your tricks. When ye git a man's- paper, you're worse than   The Sisters of Orleanzs. the seven year scratches. You'll follow a critter until he either has to pay, or hang himself to git peace. And ye can do it as nobody else can. You're sich a wheezin', rickety old skeleton, that everybody's afraid to strike or kick ye, lest the next thing he'll be on trial for murder. You're safe in sayin' things to Grandaville for which he'd choke the life out ov me."` Here Hawks pressed his hand upon his throat and grinned dolefully.  "Besides which," the Yankee went on, "ye have the impudence of the devil. In "fact, I believe you're some 'way related to Old Scratch. You look like him, anyhow." "Thank ye for the compliment, he ! he ! he !" 'Now ye see my plan," resumed Hawks, when his companion had got over his coughing. "You're to buy up Grandaville's paper, now when-its goin' rag cheap, and, then take to follerin' and persecutin' him, callin' at his room, waitin' at his door, stoppin' him on the street, and finally threatnin' to go the church when. he's gittin' married, and dunnin' him at the altar. And then, when he's worried past all patience, and a-feared, besides, that the noise ye make may interfere with his marryin' that for- tin, I'm to happen round as his friend, and relieve him of that property of his'n for what will buy his peace from you, ye old carrion scenter. There's a speculation for both ov us." "I see, I see," said the old man, with a greedy fire in his eye. "We are to put our heads together and squeeze him." "Choke him- choke him," screamed the Yankee, bounding from his chair, and with great vigor going through the operation of compressing an imaginary wind- pipe. ,, Yes, yes; together we are to choke him." The result of tha interview was, that Hawks left the note-broker's establishment in capital spirits.   r-J   CHAPTER XI.   PREPARING FOR THE SACRIFICE.   T HE wedding-day had at last been definitely and finally fixed. Isabella Castellos' health was so far re-established that her medical attendants could interpose no further objec- tion, and there wvas no one else anxious or willing to ask for delay. Ruy Grandaville had acted with great discretion. He had urged no unseemly haste. He had even expressed solicitude, when the concluding arrangement for the mar- riage ceremony was being entered into, lest the excite- ment attending it would be too great for the invalid. His bearing, throughout Isabella's entire sickness, had been characterized by delicacy and tact. While diligent in his inquiries, and in many ways giving evidence of affectionate interest, he had been guilty of no intrusive- ness. He had never wearied Isabella with importunate and unwelcome attentions, acting more like an old friend than a lover. But while he was thus careful, and even reserved, in his intercourse with his expectant bride, he, had pursued quite a different policy towards Isabella's father. Losing no fit opportunity, when not engaged with Colonel Mas- ters and other boon companions, for seeking the old gentleman's presence, hq had craftily and successfully striven to render his society agreeable. He had humored his weaknesses, fallen in with his accustomed trains of thought, and brought fresh arguments to the support of 13*  298     The Sisters of Orleans. his favorite theories. He had especially deplored the degeneracy of the times, as shown in the facility with which mere upstarts and adventurers secured connections with- the oldest and best families, thus corrupting the only pure blood in the land.- lie feelingly alluded to Isabella's sufferings, and unconsciously, as it appeared, showed his impatience in consequence of the delay in the nuptials, thus more End more winning the old man's heart, who daily thought he saw more of the father in the 1 son, and making him the stronger advocate of the meas- ure for which he was most anxious. By way of compen- sation for the hours thus lost, he scolded Napoleon Bona- parte more vigorously when in his own apartments, and the more eagerly sought the companionship of Colonel Masters and' the balance of that set, as opportunity offered. As for Isabella Castellos, she manifested no disposi- tion but one of compliance with her father's and her intended husband's wishes. While her manner indicated resignation rather than any other feeling, her compla- cency deceived her father into the belief that she was contented and happy, and comforted with that assurance, and still more with the reflection that he would soon have the worry and anxiety of the whole matter off his hands and mind, he was supremely happy himself. Aunt Esther understood the true situation of affairs far better than any other one, and upon her devolved the chief responsibility and labor of making ready for the marriage. Apparently accepting the situation and its probable issue as inevitable, she not only busied herself -with commendable  'zeal in meeting the numberless ar- rangements that were rendered necessary, but sought to: strengthen Isabella for the trial that was before her., To this end she not only assumed an air of cheerfulness her- &    Prepiti;g fo - the Szcrifice.   299 self, but endeavored to interest her young mistress in various details of preparation, consulting her on all propdr occasions, and laying before her the results of her labors with great seeming pride and satisfaction. Nor were her efforts to go without reward. On the day before the one selected for the marriage ceremony, Isabella availed herself of the opportunity when they were alone together, to hand the old lady a paper which, she stated, she had that morning received from her father. It was a deed of manumission, wherein it was ex- pressed that, in consideration of the long and faithful services which the grantee had rendered, more especially in nursing and watching over the grantor's only child, the maker, Ferdinand Castellos, conferred upon Esther, commonly called Aunt Esther, her immediate and abso- lute freedom. The instrument contained another clause. 'That was to the effect that, whereas the grantee had had a daughter, born a slave of the said Ferdinand Castellos, who had been sold and transferred to his late friend, Philip Grandaville, he, the said Ferdinand Castellos, in further acknowledgment of the said Esther's services, boundliimself to use all reasonable efforts to secure such a reconveyance of the said daughter, who had been named Isabella, as-would lead to her liberation likewise; and to that end and purport, he therein and thereby made over to the said Esther all interest and right he might at any time have and acquire in and to the said Isabella, that the said mother might have the title to her daughter in her own control. The thanks of the old lady to her young mistress were so warm and abundant, that the latter was compelled to remind her that the act was not hers, but her father's. I'Pse knows bery well whar it all comes from," was Esther's reply.       -  i   3      The. Sisters of Orclans. How the only other important party to the arrange- ment was being affected by the anticipated event, can best be shown by Ruy Grandaville's remarks to his faith- ful old servant, Napoleon Bonaparte, on the morning of the day preceding the one fixed for the wedding. "Brandy, Boney; a full glass of brandy! I feel awful, this morning. Last night was a fearful one. That sim- pleton, Solorgne, was back again, and your friend, the Yankee trader, paid me another visit; only this time he choked me, instead of me choking him. Ah, that re- minds me! Did you give him my note?" "Yes, Massa." "So he'll be here this morning. 'Well, there's no help -for it. I've got no other resource for money, and that old villain of a broker is remorseless.- Whoever would have supposed it could come to this, that a vile note- shaver would dare stop Ruy Grandaville upon the street to dun him for money, and dog his steps from morning to night as if. he were a felon. And the worst of it, to tell me that he would attend my wedding, and stand by my side at the altar. I've no doubt he'd do-it. * He has as- surance for aniything, and he's too weak and insignificant' to chastise. And all for ten thousand dollars! O, was ever mortal man so beset! Curses on the luck that has brought mle to this!" "And now 1comes the bitterest cup. I have to meet that detested Yankee, and sell him Isabella. It has to be done, but Heavens! who would ever have supposed it possible? I have seen the time when I wiould have given my soul for that woman, and I love her yet. Her face haunts me like a spirit. But-but, perhaps its best after all., I won't think of her so much when she's off my hands-gone.  And besides, what business have I to keep her, when I'm, about to be married to a woman who   Pi eparing for the Sacrifice.   301 is purity itself? Yes, I'd better let her go, but its hard, hard, hard i Boney, a little more brandy. I need all the strength it can give me." - The .trial Grandaville so much dreaded was near at hand. He had little more than announced the resolution above conveyed, which he did as he walked up and down his room with half-completed toilet, clenching his fists and spitting out his words with feverish energy, when the presence of the Yankee was made known. A very noticeable change in the manner of that, individ- ual was apparent, as soon as he entered the room. Strid- ing loftily past the old negro as he opened the door, he bestowed upon Grandaville a scarcely perceptible bow. It was evident that he felt himself master of the situation. His triumph, however, was not to be without its draw- backs. Backing towards a chair, in obedience to a polite request from Grandaville to be seated, it so happened that he settled himself into a basin of hot water which Boney, in anticipation of his master's ablutions, had care- lessly left upon that particular chair, and still more care- lessly failed to remove, when he observed what the Yankee was about to do. With a yell of pain and rage Hawks sprang to his feet, but the effect of the accident was in one sense most salutary.' In his mortification, a large share of the visitor's stiffness was lost. Seeing which, Grandaville hastened to offer the apology which his for- mer conduct made necessary as a preliminary to present negotiations. "I have to express my regret," said- he, " at my haste on the occasion of your last call upon me. I ought hot to have allowed anything you could say to affect my temper." - a  a more discerning .personi there would have been moi of insult than confession in the words, but the   3.o  i   The  istelrs 0f Or'lealts. speaker rightly calculated upon Hawks' obtuseness in their use, as that personage was highly elated at what he regarded as the Southerner's condescension. 4' "Don't mention it," replied the Yankee, with an air of unconcern. "It wusn't nothin' Ircared anythin' about. I wusn't hurt a particle." "And now," continued Grandaville, anxious to get the disagreeable business over, "that matter being sat- isfactorily explained, to the point of interest to both of us. I find that I have a few more people whose services I do not need, and as you have already made one pur- chase fromn me, I presumed that you would be reedy for another. The fact is that I wish to raise money, as a party holding some of my paper is pressing for payment." "Is he an old cripple ov a critter, blear-eyed and lame, who looks as if he might be a-beggin' for old clothes?" asked Hawks with the most innocent expres- sion of countenance. "The same," replied Grandaville, surprised at the ac- curacy of his companion's description. "I thought it might be," remarked Hawks carelessly, as I  met jist Sich an old scare-crow at the street door, as I  was a-comin' in.  He axed me if I was a-goin' to see Mr. Grandaville. I  told him I was. - 'Tell him,' said he, 'that I want to see him, but that I ain't in no hurry, as I  ain't got nothin' else to do to-day. I'1l wait here,' said he." The irritation betrayed on Grandaville's countenance, at the receipt of the Yankee's story, which -had, in fact, been manufactured for the occasion, satisfied Hawks that he had succeeded in making a point. He, therefore, waited for his companion to take the next step in the business. "Wishing to discharge my obligations which the-'ld scoundrel has secured, I have made out a list of ce:n I ,.   PrTepring for the Sacrifice.   303 slaves I am prepared to part'with," observed Grandaville with assumed carelessness. "You will find the prices very reasonable." Hawks held out his hand for the paper, and it was with difficulty that he concealed his exultation, when he- saw that the first name on the list was "Isabella," being described as " housekeeper." His Yankee cunning, how- ever, did not desert him. "Should like to accommodate you, should indeed;;" he drawlingly replied, " but the fact is that money jist now is most awful tight. I don't see " Here he stopped. "Cannot you manage' to take the property," inquired Grandaville wiith an air of deep anxiety. "Wal," slowly: replied the Yankee, "I don't know. The price I see you've set down on the paper's twenty thousand dollars. Perhaps I might manage to raise ten." "It is yours," said Grandaville emphatically and at once. It was arranged that Hawks was to see to securing the paper in Weldon's hands, and call at Grandaville's rooms 'at twelve o'clock on the morrow to receive the convey- ance for the slaves. The marriage was to be an hour  later. Hawks was almost beside himself with exultation, as he again found himself upon the street. So erratic were his movements, as he skipped along with grinning coun- tenance, and hands every moment or two brought to- gether with a ringing smack, that the passers-by stopped and looked after him. They concluded that he must be crazy. "That," said- he "closes accounts atween us, and leaves a right handsome balance on myr side. Them Southern chaps can beat me on style, but they're no match for   .              J   304      .The Sisters of Orleans. Yankee pluck and genius. Rather calc'lated I'd come out ahead at the end ov the business. And the gal, golly! but she's one to make a feller's grinders water." And here the Yankee executed such a leap into- the air, and- gave expression to such a peculiar exclamation of delight, that he barely escaped arrest by the nearest policeman as a lunatic who had strayed from his keepers. Rushing into the den of the old note-broker, who at that moment was curled up half asleep in his chair, he startled that hoary reprobate by shouting in his ear: "We've won the game, old feller; we three." "Three!" exclaimed Weldon, opening wide his wat- ery eyes. "Yes, three; you-me--and the devil." v   ,-   X   CHAPTER XII. AT THE ALTAR. "A   d RANDY! Some brandy, I say !" &")  The words had in them more than usual , IVYI eagerness, when uttered on the morning of Ad.4  the day fixed for the speaker's-Ruy Gran- daville's-marriage. The old servant Napoleon Bonaparte fairly started with affright, when, in obedience to his master's demand, he approached him with the glass containing the stimu- lant for which he had called. Grandaville was sitting up in his bed, his cheeks so hollow, his eyes so wild and feverish, and his whole coun- tenance so haggard and pale, as to be scarcely recogniz- able. "Boney," said he, as he handed. back the empty glass, his hand still shaking, notwithstandingath e strengthening draught, "this is to be my wedding-day, and I believe I'm the most miserable dog in creation. I'm to give awav the only woman I ever loved, and tie myself to one I never did love. Its a terrible drag, but I wish it were over. Then, perhaps, I'd have some peace. They were all back last night, Solorgne, Isabella, the Yankee-all pointing their fingers at me and hissing, and I couldn't raise my hand to drive them away. Curses on these visions! We'll have to be very busy, though. There's fifty things to attend to this morning. Has the tailor sent in my clothes?" "Yes, Massa."   306     iThe Sisters of Orleans. "The lawyer, has he sent round any paper!?" "Yes, Massa." "Then I'ln ready for Hawks, the villain!" "Boney,"continued Grandaville, after- a brief pause following the mention of Hawks' name, during which the speaker's countenance assumed a cast of intense loath- ing, "I wish to Heaven we could exchange places. I'm more of a slave, ten times over, than you are. I'm about to do what my very soul detests, and all because my masters demand it. You have but one. I have a hun- dred, and every one of them a devil. O, Boney, there are no tyrants like a man's own crimes and vices. But it can't be helped! It can't be helped! A little more brandy, and we'll begin the work of preparation. I want no breakfast this morning." The day opened no more cheerfully to the other party to whomin it was-likely to prove so important. Aunt Esther almost screamed out as she met the pale, sad, but tearless, face of Isabella Castellos, upon enter- ing the latter's apartment that morning. There seemed to be no life in it. The snowy gown that was round her, and the pillow upon which her head rested, were scarcely whiter than her cheek.       '  6 "O, mamma, I'm so glad you have come, so glad! I have been so miserable."  And the girl, half rising, buried her face upon the old woman's bosom, as the latter reached the bed-side, and the tears that had been restrained to that moment, began to flow freely in the presence of conscious sympathy. "Cheer up, chile! dis will neber do," said the old ser- vant briskly, though her own eyes were wet at the time. "Remember dat dis is de day when you'se needs to be bery strong. Dar, dat's a good chile, now!" "Yes, yes, mamma, I know how foolish it is to give   At the Altas.       307 way so. But I've had so much to try me. All last night it seemed as if I was not alone. I was back in the school-room once more, and that poor, dead man, my, generous, brave co-laborer, was there. He spoke not a word, but his eyes seemed to say so much. I felt that they were reproaching me for going to give myself to one of his-enemies; and I could not meet them. Their very gentleness carried a curse. It was only a dream, I know; but mamma, mamma, it was so like reality." Then, after a few moments of silent weeping, Isabella raised her head, and looking up into the old woman's face, resumed her speaking: "Mamma, I want you, when-when its over, and you go to that country up North where you can live in free- dom, to find the mother of 'that noble young man, and tell her there were hearts that bled for him besides her -own-won't you, mamma?" - iNo, no, chile, I'se can't neber go 'way an' leave you'se, neber, neber! I'se don't want no- freedom with- out you'se." And here the old woman broke down completely, throwing her arms about Isabella and straining her to her bosom, while her sobs followed hysterically. The effect upon her Companion was most beneficial. It caused her to turn comforter, and thus gave her strength to master her own feelings. "There, that's a good mamma!" she began. "Don't weep any more.  I'm sure there's nothing to cry for. I'm simply going to do my duty. I'm going to please my father, and help you and my dear sister, and give free- dom to ever so many poor people that otherwise would live and die in slavery. Its a great privilege I have. I ought to be very happy. I'm proud of the work before me.  No, no, I'll not cry any more. I'll be strong.   308      The Sisters of Orleans. You'll wonder to see how strong I'll be. So, so, let us begin to get ready. There's a great deal to do this morning, you know. Has the hair-dresser come? And the dress-maker, has she sent round that skirt? The confectioner, I'm sure, ought to have been here for his final- orders before this." And in a very few minutes more the two women were busy with their preparations and arrangements, both wearing countenances that were almost cheerful, what- ever the hidden feelings of their hearts. Isabella was to pass through one other preliminary trial. Every household that has had a marriage in it, knows how powerful are the emotions it awakens. It is an event which unlocks all hearts. Differences are forgot- ten, if not forgiven, under the -softening influences of the most trying, and at the same time most wholesome, crisis, and slumbering affections are awakened to fresh life and energy.  The summer's rain is not more grateful to the arid soil of the sun-parched field, than a wedding to that family whose sympathies have become benumbed -by the slow attrition of duties languidly performed, or perverted by the presence of jealousies that ought never to have existed. Isabella's father sought a final interview with the child he loved, before yielding her to the guardianship of another. His countenance was beaming with compla- cency, the result, in part, of the affection he bore her, and in part of his own great personal satisfaction. The meeting was full of endearment. "For one thing I know you will give me credit," said the -old man, as his voice slightly trembled, "that every- thing I have done has been directed with a view to your happiness. In arranging with my  oldest 'and dearest   At the Altar.       309 friend for your permanent, settlement in life, I knew that I was providing a companion whose unexceptionable birth would furnish the surest guaranty of spotless honor and a constant heart. 'The knowledge that you are about to be established according to the view I have lopg entertained, is the crowning gratification of my life." "O father, there is nothing I would not do to secure your happiness." "I believe you my dearest child, I. believe you. It has always seemed as if your heart met mine more than half way. - Our love is one that can never be destroyed. Although you are about to pass under the authority of another, I feel that there is nothing which can ever come between our hearts." a O father, you cannot tell what comfort those words give me. Is there, indeed, nothing that can ever divide us in our love?" "Nothing, child, nothing." And having spoken a few more well-meant words, in- tended to strengthen Isabella for the exertion that was before her, the old man hastened away to prepare for his part in the day's proceedings. He could not have been more delighted if the wedding that was about to take place had been his own. The pallor of his daughter's brow he could not fail to see, but he attributed it to her recent illness and -the excitement of the occasion. That any one could be unhappy at such a time, he never for a moment imagined, he was so joyful himself. Twelve o'clock came, and with it Hawks, the Yankee trader, at Ruy Grandaville's apartment. The transfers of the slaves, through the professional diligence of Seabry Anthony, Esq., were ready, and it took but a few  minutes to conclude the business between vendor and purchaser, there being no courtesies to waste on either   3Io     T7he Sisters of Orleans. side. Grandaville handed over the conveyances of the slaves, and received in return ten thousand dollars in his own paper, which Hawks had obtained from the note- broker, Patrick Weldon. The delivery complete, the Yankee lost no time in ridratng Grandaville of his unwelf come presence, so eager was he to .acquire actual posses- sion of his new purchase. Mounted upon his swiftest saddle-horse, he was soon on his way to the plantation, his mind full of delicious fancies concerning the beauti- ful woman who had become his property. What was the issue of his'journey, will appear in a subsequent chapter. One of the largest and most elegant churches in the city of New Orleans had been selected as the scene of the marriage ceremony that was to unite two of its oldest families. As became the position of the parties, an eager and brilliant assembly had collected as witnesses. The great building was crowded with representatives of wealth and fashion.  The names .of Grandaville and Castellos were quite enough to attract the elite of society, even if ' Rty had not been one of its most honored members, and Isabelhl had been less widely loved for her many estima- ble qualities.  There were the usual stir and flutter and careless gayety, followed by the hush of eager expectation as the bridal party entered. Ruy Grandaville appeared somewhat pale and haggard, but calm, self-poised and commanding. All of his na- tive stateliness was apparent as he advanced to the altar. Equally quiet and composed was she who leaned upon his arm, but so white and shadowy did she seem in her sweeping marriage robe. and wreath of pale, delicate flowers, that a shudder ran through the assembly as it gazed upon her. l'There was not one there to whom the thought of a funeral did not come. Yet there was no 7        At the Altar-.        3" sign of weakness or hesitation in either look or bearing of the fragile girl. Her brow carried the serenity, if the enthusiasm, of the martyr.          ) One radiant countenance there was in the party. Old Ferdinand Castellos was /conspicuously happy. The smile that irradiated his features showed plainly enough his supreme satisfaction, the only possible regret that could enter his mind being that his quondam associate, Philip Grandaville, was not there to witness the fruition of their hopes, and share in the triumph of the hour. i The altar was reached. The parties had taken their    g respective places. The blessing of Heavenr had been invoked, and the reverend and saintly man who was to conduct the ceremony, amid the deepest stillness on the part of the assembled multitude, was in the very act of beginning the marriage rite, when there was a most, un- looked for interruption.       ,  "I object! The words were naturally, even calmly, spoken, and yet so distinctly as to be perfectly audible to every one inthe house. All eyes instantly sought the speaker, and now, for the first time, the old servant, Aunt Esther, was observed- standing a short distance from the altar. Every one recognized her as the cause of the interruption. In one hand she held up a paper in such a way as, at the same time, to draw attention to herself and give emphasis to her words. The amazement of all was intense. Unbroken silence for a moment prevailed, the officiating clergyman looking hopelessly upon the disturber, and a spell seeming to rest upon all the others.     . Ferdinand Castellos was the first to recover from the general surprise.        312      The Sisters of Orleans. With face fairly scarlet with rage, rushing before the - old woman, he exclaimed: "Slave, are you crazy? Hence this instant!" "Pardon me, sir; I am no longer your slave!" And the woman held up before her former master his own deed of manumission, while her eye fearlessly met his. "Then what-what does this conduct mean?" Angry as he was, the speaker was surprised into an attitude of deference by the other's singularly deliberate manner. "It means that you are about to dispose of myv prop- erty," replied Esther, now dropping entirely her negro patois, "without asking my consent. That woman," pointing to Isabella, who was standing as white as a marble statue, and almost as rigid, "is, by virtue of the instrument I hold in my hand, my slave. She is my daughter. Ah! I see you start, Ferdinand Castellos; but listen, and I will explain all. When your wife died, leaving an infant'daughter, I was the mother of a child but a few days born, which, as you well know, was your child as well as mine. I was given the motherless babe to nurse. The children, as I soon discovered, bore a striking resemblance to each other. Both were white, for I have but ilttle negro blood in my veins.. It would have been strange if, under such circumstances, I had not thought of the interests of my own flesh and blood. An exchange was easily made. Little more than a transfer of garments was required, and my assurance supplied the balance of what was- necessary.  The fraud upon my master did not greatly trouble me. - I considered that both were his children, that both had an equal natural claim upon him; and when one was to be a  lady, and the other a  slave, I simply sought to give my own off- spring the preference. That woman at the altar is my    AI the Altar.        313 child, born of my loins, and by the conveyance which I hold from her and my former master, now my property. Where the other child is, you, Feirdinand Castellos, ought to know." "It is false, false, false," shouted Castellos; but his lips were white, and his voice, as was noticed, was tremu- lous, as he spoke. "-Woman, where is your proof?" "At hand," replied Esther with perfect coolness. "Doctor Tallifarro was your family physician at the time of your wife's death and the birth of her child. He will recollect that on the same day, but before the other infant was born, my child through the carelessness of another, was severely burned upon the arm between the elbow and the shoulder. He dressed the wound, and continued to prescribe' for the little sufferer., fThe limb was saved, but the doctor, remarking upon the whiteness of my child's complexion, was accustomed jokingly to say that the scar that would be Heft for life, would always remain as evidence in, case she should attempt to pass herself off as a person of free 'birth. Doctor Tallifarro is now present, and can speak for himself." At once all eyes were turned inquiringly upon a distin- guished and venerable appearing man, who was present among the friends of the Castellos' family, being the emi- ; nent physician whose name had been used He came forward in obedience to the universal, but unspoken, demand. "I remember the circumstance of which the woman speaks," he said. "Then look here 1 " And with these words, Esther, having suddenly ap- proached Isabella, with a quick movement of- the hand tore the fragile material composing the bridal dress firol the shoulder to the elbow of one arm, exposing a deep, I4  14   -               . '    3I4      The Sisters of Orleans. wrinkled scar as if made by a burn, midway between the two. An exclamation partly of surprise, and partly of horror, broke from the lips of all witnessing the act and its re- sult. Ferdinand Castellos, totally unmanned, could only wring hishands. But the trial-was not ended. "Doctor "-and this time the speaker was Ruy Gran- daville--"is it, not possible that the scar might be the result of an injury secretly inflicted by this crafty woman, without the knowledge of others?" "Under certain circumstances it would certainly be possible," replied the physician. "It is wrong," resumed Ruy, speaking with noticeable :almness, "that the innocent should suffer, and at the same time I have the greatest interest in being assured that no imposition is practiced. I must, therefore,-ask you, Doctor Tallifarro, whether there is anything else you can see, either to disprove or confirm the woman's words. 'If possible, let the question be settled at once, and this-terrible suspense brought to an end." Thus appealed to, Doctor Tallifarro could not decline entering upon, such an inspection as was possible under the circumstances. Sinking upon one knee, he first glanced at the exposed arm of the now insensible girl, who had been borne tO'the nearest seat,. Then, looking searchingly into her face; he examined her hair, her lips, er eyes, and every minutiae of her features. This done, e:rose mechanically to his feet. Several minutes passed, nd yet he did not speak. With one hand covering his yes, he seemed to be lost in deep reflection, but it was Do evident from the pallor which' had-overspread his -atures, that some painful thought had possession of his ind.  The suspense on the part of those who were waiting hig decision was terrible.   At the Altar.        3 15 "Speak," at last said Ruy firmly.  Thus apparently recalled to a cnrisciousness of what was expected ofShim, and glancing hastily, almost timidly, about him, the old man, with a visible effort, slowly re-  sponded to Grandaville's demand. "This young person, whoever she may be,-undoubtedly has negro blood in her veins."               1 "My God! My God!" wildly exclaimed Ferdinand Castellos, as he staggered back, and would have fallen prostrate, had he not been supported to a sect. His cry of agony aroused Isabella, who had given no sign at the physician's dreadful words, and springing up, she suddenly threw herself at her, father's feet, and  clasped him about the knees. ^ "O, father, father, do not cast me off! You said nothing should ever come between our hearts."  At these words, as if awaking from a painful dream, Ferdinand Castellos looked down into the up-turned face  : of the kneeling girl. He did not speak at once. It seemed as if he was gathering strength for the trial. Then, stretching out his open hands as if to repel some- thing from him, he hissed'through his white and tremu-i lous lips the words : "Slave-impostor-wench-curse upon ye!" The repulse was too much for the overtaxed girl. She sunk down upon the floor at her father's feet;,-helpless, and to every appearance dead. And there she lay. Of the hundreds gazing upon the scene, not one stretched forth a hand to raise her. An hour before every arm in that assembly would have been at her service,-but now-- poor, hapless inheritor of the blood of a proscribed race, though of not enough to dim thm lustre of her brow-, she  was a thing discarded, scorned, accursed!         ? Help, however, was to come from an unexpected source.   I   3I6      Tle Sisters of Orleans. Being suddenly lifted up, she was quickly removed from the pressure of the throng and from the building. At the same moment her mother disappeared. Strangely enough, in the confusion that prevailed, not one of the many lookers-on took sufficient notice of the proceeding to afterwards describe the parties by whoin the deed was done. All that could be learned was, that the insensible girl had been lifted into a close carriage that was appar- ently in waiting, belonging to whom no one knew, and driven by an entire stranger, and which, after an elderly lady had entered it, was driven rapidly away.   CHAPTER XI II. A WOMAN S POWER. (-^b'-HERE was one other person who quickly dis- appeared from the scene of confusion into which the wedding-party and the attendant spectators were thrown by the disclosures re- corded in the last chapter. Ruy Grandaville had no doubt of the truth of Aunt Esther's story. He only wondered that he had not suspected as much before. Now, when the discovery had been made, there was no one among the many that had beel. proud to do honor to the supposed heiress of the Castellos' estate and name, but at once recollected how often his or her suspicions had been aroused by something in the appearance of the young person upon whom they had so long lavished their flatteries and attentions. But Ruy was in possession of confirmatory evidence that the others did not have.. He knew the other Isabella. He recognized in her chaste and brilliant beauty the indubitable proof of rightful heir- ship to the blood of an ancient and haughty ancestry. The whole case flashed upon his mind, and with it came the resolution that decided his course of action. He did not regret what had occurred. He had never loved her who was so near being his wife, and now his passion for the supposed slave-girl--the true mistress, as it had proved-came back to him with a most pleasant memory. Why not make her his wife, he asked himself, and thus secure the property which had become so much of an object in his eyes in accepting matrimony, and at   t, At t-1r erS oJ Urleans. the same time gratify the only real affection of his life? There was another inducement that urged him to this course. The real Isabella- Castellos was well calculated to shine in society, and Ruy was familiar with her quali-.a fications. There would be a novelty, a positive charm, in introducing her, with all the romance surrounding her singular career, among his aristocratic acquaintances, when he knew how brilliant would be thelposition she would achieve. With such incentives, conling with the force and rapid- ity of intuitions, to spur him on, it is no wonder that Ruy Grandaville was anxious to withdraw himself from the crowd of noisy, gossiping idlers and ostentatious sympa- thizers by which he found himself surrounded, that he might at once take steps to secure-the realization of his newly-awakened dream of happiness. Nor was there acking another almost as powerful motive. He'remem- ered with a cutting twinge the conve ance of Isabella oe had that day made to the Yankee trader, and he was Ufficiently aware of the character of that individual to now that he'would lose no timo e in possessing himself f the prize. What if the, hated Hawks were to reach sabella first, not merely to subject her to insult, but to rpose the heartlessness ofthe man who was about to k her to become his wife! No timne was to be lost. , quietly withdrawing from the excited and oppressive rong, he hastened to place 'himself in the saddle, and once set out for the plantation.  But his progress was not to be equal to his anxiety. In :t, his:haste proved to be the chief hinderance to speed. ght having fallen soon after he had set out, he contin- :to urge the animal he wasd riding at a gait which led a-fall in the darkness, and the serious lamingof the tst The accident occured in the midst of the swamp, h .        w mp   A Woman s Power.       319 where no relief was to be obtained, and the only alterna- tives were to prosecute the journey on foot, or attempt to urge on the limping brute in the hope of his recovery. The latter seeming preferable, Grandaville, dismounting, led the poor creature for a distance, conforming to his- slow and halting pace. The hurt to the beast, however, was more serious than his master had supposed, and at last losing all patience, Grandaville abandoned him, and pressed forward on foot as best he could. But time had already been lost, and other obstacles intervening, there were so many unexpected delays that the hour of mid- night had arrived by the time the weary traveller reached his destination. Hawks had not been much more fortunate in his jour- ney. Having the advantage of an earlier start, he was the first to arrive at the plantation, but, owing to a chap- ter of accidents it is unnecessary to recount, night had already set in. There was, therefore, no alternative but for him to remain till morning. Nor did that result promise to be in the least disagree- able. His reception by Isabella, to whom he lost no time in announcing himself the owner of -all the people on the plantation, herself included, had been exceedingly gracious and flattering. He had expected some little demonstration of repugnance, but there was nothing of the kind. On the contrary, Isabella received the an- noincement of her transfer with a smile that quite fascin- ated her new master, and set him to congratulating him- self more and more upon his good fortune. The truth is that Isabella was not greatly surprised by Hawks' appearance in his new capacity, and shocked as she must have been by again meeting the man whom she knew only as Jefferson's brutal murderer, so thoroughly tutored had she become in the school of affliction, that   320   ;  The Sisters of Orleans. she was quite able to control any manifestation of her real feeling. What other motive she had for dissimula- tion, the sequel will show. So, bidding the Yankee welcome, when he had told the story of fher purchase, with a courtesy she conducted him into the mansion, inquired about his journey, and indulged in all the agreeable attentions which an accom- plished, and especially a beautiful, woman, can so well bestow.  Nor were the physical comforts he required forgotten. Wine was set before him, and in due time an abundant repast was at his service. *But still more to his taste did the susceptible Hawks find the cheerful talk and skilful blandishments of his entertainer. She rattled on with the freedom  of an old and familiar friend. He was fairly bewildered. He had not been without some dread of meeting the woman who had so abashed him at their first encounter, and was now more than delighted with his reception.  Little accus-.' tomed to the society of elegant females, he had no idea that a woman could make herself so ,clever. While he possessed sufficient knowledge of human nature to sus- pect that his character as master had something to do with her affability, his vanity led him- to believe that his own attractions were not without their influence.  But as Isabella, in his eyes, was his property, he could not see but that the fascination she exerted, whatever the cause was rightfully his to enjoy, and' he gave himself up to it accordingly. Supper over, Hawks was conducted by Isabella to  lher own sitting apartment, the same inf which Solorgne, upon his first visit to the plantation, had met her, and there placing herself at the piano, she played and sang in a way which more and m6re transported herauditor. As he listened to the rich tones of her voice, and gazed ad-   A Woman's Power.       32I  miringly upon her voluptuous form, -as she sat at the instrument, the treasure he had acquired each moment gained fresh attractions in his eyes. , But music and a woman's charms were not all he had to intoxicate him. By Isabella's direction, wine was brought in, and again and again did she urge him to par- take of it. If, the superior quality of the liquor had not been inducement enough, her persuasions would have been quite irresistible. The influence of the insiduous stimulant soon began to appear in the language of ex- travagant admiration he lavished upon his entertainer; and so graciously did she receive his uncouth compli- ments, that any suspicion he -might have had of her sin--  cerity quickly disappeared. Only once did he meet with a repulse. Having, in a moment of unguarded enthusiasm, attempted to take some liberty with her person, she gave him a glance so full of reprobation that he shrank back quite intimidated. His  embarrassment was but for a moment. A reassuring smile from Isabella, and the reflection that, being wholly in his power, she must sooner or later defer to his pleas- . ure, quite restored his spirits.              ; "Now," said she, "I am about to sing my favorite piece. You must honor it by drinking the glass I shall pour for you." He was in no way averse to the proposal.     - Pouring a tumbler full of the wine, her hand, in pas- sing over it, paused for a moment, and there was a move- ment as if something were being dropped 'from it; and then, with a bewitching smile, she extended the goblet to the already half-intoxicated man.; He took it from her hand, and at a draught emptied  the vessel, smacking his lips after the delicious; bever- ? age . . rq'   3-22     The Sisters of Orleans. She took her place at the instrument, and began to sing one of her most inspiring songs, throwing all the strength and -fervency of her voice into the music. Hawks listened for a few moments with an air of stupid admiration; then, as if catching something of the spirit of the piece, broke out into the words of a ribald song with which he was familiar. The first stanza he delivered with considerable unctions; after which, the words came further and further apart. At last leaning forward, he rested his head upon his arms, crossed upon the table before him. Then the words ceased altogether, and the only-sounds that came from him were those of the labored breathing of a heavy sleeper. With a crash upon the instrument, as if in sudden anger, Isabella stopped the music. Rising, she turned and looked at the insensible man, and, as she did so, an expression of intense loathing and bitter hatred came over her pale, but animated features. Then, stepping to one side, she gave a bell-cord a sudden pull. Rose appeared. ( Rose, tell Pomp and Mark to come here at once.' Upon the entrance, of two great, burly negroes, Isa- bella pointed to the slumbering Yankee. , "Take that thing," she said, " to Massa Ruy's room, and lay him upon Massa's bed." She was obeyed without a word. Another pull of the bell-cord. "Rose, tell Eph I want hig."  Soon the old negro bearing that name appeared grin- ning and scraping at the door. "Eph, at the hour of midnight precisely, it is my order that everybody on this plantation shall be in the Mag- -nolia grove near the goblin's tree. Remember, at the hour of midnight!"  .       .               .   A Woman's Power.       323 'Yas, yas, Missey; I'se understands. Dey'll all be dar." And the old negro went away grinning, evidently full- of his commission. Stepping into an adjoining room, a few minutes after- wards Isabella re-appeared so disguised by a change of apparel as to be scarcely recognizable as the same per- son. She was now dressed in a costume which gave her a strangely weird and resolute look. A short skirt had taken the place of the flowing robe she had been wearing, and from beneath a handkerchief wound round her head in the form of a turban, her unbound hair flowed loosely over her half-naked shoulders. The fire in her eye showed that she was meditating some desperate purpose. Bidding Rose accompany her, Isabella then passed out of the house, leaving the lights burning, and everything unchanged behind her. Soon afterwards Grandaville arrived at the mansion. In vain did he look for conscious human being. Isa- bella's apartment he found as if it had just been occu-. pied, but she was nowhere to be seen. The servants' rooms were all empty, although giving evidence of recent occupation. He wandered on, until he came to his own apartment, and there he discovered Hawks in the condi- tion that has been described. Surmising that the others could not be far off, and being utterly worn down with. fatigue, he threw himself upon a lounge, and was soon' fast asleep.   CHAPTER XIV. A WOMAN'S VENGEANCE. EVERY one accustomed to mingle with the negroes upon Southern plantations, at any time during the period of their enslavement,  was aware that they retained many of the su- perstitions of their African ancestors.* Not the least common of these was a belief in demons which exercised a supervisory control over humankind. The usual hab- itations of the goblins or spirits were supposed to -be groves or trees, and these, in consequence, were regarded with extraordinary reverence. From the whites the ex- istence of this veneration was carefully concealed-; and yet there w'as scarcely a plantation without its grove, which was looked upon as sacred because of the imnpute. residence of some deity. To this the poor bondsmen, whetl least suspected of an inclination to paganism, would secretly resol t on occasions of unusual anxiety, to bestow *their native offerings, and implore the kindly intercession of the invisible spirit. In this regard "Massa Ruy's plantation " was not an exception. It had its sacred grove and its goblin's tree. Not far from the mansion stood a  collection' of dark magnolias, one of which, with a top that quite over- looked the others, and with foliage so dense that a deep shadow always slept beneath it, was looked upon as the chosen abode of the controlling demon of the place. This had been the destination of many a midnight pil- grimage, when trouble had entered the cabin of the slave,   M A Womadn's- bVelgeance.    325 and numerous were the offerings which had, from time to time, been left beneath the wide-spreading branches of the great tree, in the hope that the patron deity might be induced to restore health to the wasted body, or love to the alienated heart, of the cherished one. The superstitious beliefs of the people left upon Ruy Grandaville's plantation, after the Yankee trader's first visit, had been greatly strengthened by the incidents attending it, casting a deep gloom, as they did, over all their hearts. The marvellous stories told by the Dragon- ess and other croakers of supernatural visitations and warnings had, likewise, had their influence. There was a general feeling, therefore, thiat evil was threatened, and that need of assistance from the Spirit that presided over the affairs of that plantation was --more than ordinary urgent. Had anything more been required to develope that feeling to the fullest extreme, it was had in the fact that the negroes' heathenish faith had received a most re- markable; but important, convert in Isabella. With the occurrence of the incidents heretofore' described, she had begun to culti/ate new relations with her fellPF-iervants. Always friendly with them, and beloved by th m'she had before discouraged their barbarous beliefs, and sought to inculcate among them the doctrines of the Christian code, but since her return from the grave-of Solorgne, she had pursued quite a different policy. Suddenly she had appeared in the secret religious gatherings of the other slaves, had given countenance to their heathenish rites, and by the time which I have now reached in the progress of my story, had come to be looked upon as one possessing in an eminent degree the favor of the local deity. When, therefore, the message was sent round, that Isa-   326      The-Sisters of Orleans. bella required the presence of all the plantations people in the haunted grove, for the purpose of making a mid- night Visit to the goblin's tree, in connection kith thefact that a knowledge of the Yankee's second arrival had set all tongues to work with tte dissemination of new stories of threatened evil, there was no one that dreamt of dis- obeying the command any more than if it had come direct from the demon himself. -Accordingly, the approach of midnight found a most singular collection of persons gathered upon the outskirts of -theMagnolia grove. It embraced every resident hu- man Being on the plantation, except Isabella and her at- tendant Rose; The little party was huddled closely together, as if seeking safety in contiguity When any one spoke, it was in a whisper, and had the darkness per- mitted an inspection of the countenances there assem- bled, it would have been no difficult matter to see that a great fear was resting upon the entire body. It was easy to be seen that they were anxiously in wait of some person or thing. What the object of their solici- tude was, appeared upon the sudden arrival of Isabella. At' once there was a movement of welcome, which eemed 'to be both- an exhibition of affection and of relief. There was  no noisy demonstration-only that sort of flutter which showed the removal of restraint. Buteven that was speedily quieted. Standing in the centre of the group which gathered about her as its controlling attraction, Isabella, now seeming in her new costume to have gained such an in- crease of altitude as to rise above all the others, spoke a few impressive words by way of preliminary explanation, and then proceeded:    - "In yonder mansion is your enemy and mine. There lies the murderer of Jefferson, and the man who calls XS04 and the mn wh .Icalls   A Wioma/n's Venzgeance.    327 himself our master. Do you want to know your fate when he has got you in his clutches? I'll tell you. There's not one of you but will be whipped, starved and tortured. There's not a husband among you that can longer claim his wife ; not a mother that can longer keep her child. Some of you will be killed,/ not as Jefferson was, but by inches, by days and nights of agony and blood. Some of you will be sold to the sugar planta- tions; some will be used to feed the lusts of the monster, and of men like him. There's not one of you but had better be dead! Listen. We are slaves. That means that we have been robbed of our freedom by those who are stronger, not better, than ourselves. Your fathers and mothers, and mine many generations back, were as free as those who now call themselves our masters. They were stolen and brought here, that they and you and I might be made slaves. It is thus that we have be- come the spoil of our oppressors. But we are not with- out help. The gods of our fathers have followed us to the land of the stranger. They still hear our cry of distress, and wjll stand between us and our enemies. Let us go to the demon. Let us ask him for counsel. Let us obey his voice." The words of the speaker, as here given, can convey but little of the emphasis and potency they possessed, as they came-hissing from the lips of that tall-and passion- ate woman,' and fell upon the ears of men and women who were ready to receive them as the direct result of in- spiration. 'Of course there could be but one response, and the entire company, Isabella leading, was soon making its way with quick, but almost noiseless, tread, among the shadows of the dark magnolias, towards the goblin's tree. The night was one well calculated for the strange and solemn work of superstition. The moon was shining i                    H  ^   328      The Sisters of Orleans. brightly, but swiftly-flying clouds obscuring its face, made long and mysterious shadows that chased each other like things of life, and the winds, brief and fitful, sang and sighed among the branches which one moment were lifted threateningly, and the next had sunk to a sullen repose. Everything about the hour and scene tended to produce the wildest and most fanciful conclusions. No wonder the half barbarous and untutored beings who fol- lowed Isabella's lead, believed that they were going into the immediate presence of deity! Ere long, they stood before a dark mass of foliage that rose between them and the sky, and in which they be- lieved to be hidden the spirit they had come to consult. Isabella fell upon her knees, and extended her arms towards the great shadowy body. Then her voice rose sharp and distinct upon the still night air. "Demon-god of our fathers, behold. us at thy feet! If thou dost still hear the cry and avenge the wrongs of the race thou once didst love, hear us, and make thy presence known!" There was absolute stillness for a minute, during which the position of the suppliant remained unchanged. Then the leaves in the great tree began to rustle, although not a breath of air at the moment was stirring.; next the top- most branches were violently shaken, as if some heavy bddy were moving through them , and then there came a sound, first like an infant's wail, which gradually grew louder and louder, until in a burst of demoniac-like laughter it ceased- and died away on a passing blast of wind. Such a demonstration, under ordinary circumstances, would have completely unmanned the ignorant people who had followed Isabella to that singular place. But now the effect was directly the reverse. Believing the , . ,   A Woman's Vezngeance.     3  29 sounds they h  ad heard to be the voice of their god, thus showing his readiness to befriend them  in the hour of their peril, they were filled with a strange and enthusiastic courage, preparing them 'for any desperate deed that might be ordered. Amain the'voice of Isabella arose.  "Spirit that loves and helps the oppressed I show us, we pray thee, how we are to escape the 'hands of one who would crush us to dust, the cruelest enemy of thy Again there was silence, and then the branches began to move; but this time, instead of the voice being heard, a light suddenly burst upon the scene, and a greathlaz- ing object went hissing upward, until far in the air it burst- with a loud report, sending out hundreds of fiery serpents that hissed and sparkled before going out in darkness. By the time the blacks, to whom such a display was wholly unaccountable, except as a result of supernatural -power, had partially recovered from their surprise, another object, equal ly mysterious, ad claimed their attention. A ball of fire was seen descending through the branches of the tree, slowly bounding from limb to limb, and which finally, reaching the earth, flamed up until the space be- neath the great magnolia was brighter than it had-ever been at noonday. Anotherwonderthen appeared. Piled up around the trunk of the tree were to be seen a num- ber of torches ready for the lighting. "The command of the demon!" shouted -Isabella, springing to her feet, and rushing forward. "We are to destroy our enemy with fire." At once all was confusion and-urry. Eaerly seizing the torches, each one, following Isabella's example, kin- dled his or her brand at the supposed spirit-lighted flame,   330      The Sisters of Orleans. and the entire body started furiously in the direction of the mansion. It was a strange and terrible spectacle. The torch- bearers, soon falling into line, wound in and out among the trees, and sped across the lawn, like a great fiery ser- pent. At their head was Isabella. With one naked arm she held aloft ljer blazing fagot, while her long hair, floating loosely backward, fairly glowed and sparkled in: the sheen. Followed by her black-skinned attendants, each with a crackling, smoking, brand of flame, she seemed like a Fury leading a troop of devils in a murderous forray. Scarcely had the excited and now half-crazed company rushed from the great tree, when another object might have been seen descending among its branches. This time it was something black. Striking the ground, it rolled over several times as if endowed with volition. Then rising to its feet, it might have been seen to He not only a human being, but the boy Frog, whose presence there, under such circumstances, sufficiently explained the phenomena that had just been witnessed. He -had been the instrument used by Isabella for reaching per- sons so utterly dispirited by a life of oppression that they could be aroused to a deed of violence only through an appeal to their superstitions. Having at last got himself securely on his feet, the boy picked up a torch, kindled it at the rapidly disappearing fire-ball, and waving it several times round his head, set off in pursuit of the others. At last the long line of fire became stationary. The mansion had been reached.  One after another the torch-bearers halted in the presence of the familiar struc- ture. In the light of their blazing brands the great, solemn form and long verandas of the old building were sharply revealed. All was silent and dream-like. The   A Wornar's Vengeance.     331 window-panes glistened in the unwonted illumination, but no human countenance looked out upon the extraordin- ary spectacle. By its very speechlessness the venerable pile seemed to protest against the threatened devastation. The delay was but momentary. Isabella, detecting the first faint sign of hesitation on the part of her follow- ers, rushed forward and pressed her fagot against the side of the building, at the very point where her own luxuri- ous apartment was situated. That act revived the flag- ging courage of the others. The next moment every torch was applied, and the mad, fiery riot had begun. The old building, dried by the winds and suns of many seasons, was little more than a mass of tinder. It seemed but a second before the consuming element, seiz- ing upon its prey, set about the work of annihilation. The flames crackled and sparkled as with demoniac laughter. The long fire-tongues shot upward, licking the parched timbers and converting into a mass of glowing flame all they touched, higher and higher ascending, until, overlapping' cornice and roof, they leaped far in air, and waved to and fro like the arms of victors in their triumph. Wider and wider spread the circle of illumination, until tree and shrub and arbor, one after another, came into view like so many wondering spectators. The heavens above put on the angry, brazen glare which always marks the conflagration, and the stars disappeared, lost in the depths of that fatal splendor. But the only fury was not that of the elements. 'The negroes, catching the fierce incentive of the scene, leaped and danced and sang with equal madness. The excite- ment of the hour had driven them almost to lunacy. The consequential Eph vied with the scampish Frog in the grotesqueness of his pranks, and the shrewish Drag- oness for once seemed immoderately happy.   '332    . The Sisters of Orkans. \ There was one exception.  With her arms folded across her bosom, her eye sternly surveying the ruin of which -she had been the instigator, and her whole body at ease, Isabella stood with the light falling full upon her as quiet, and apparently as indifferent, as if she had been carved from marble. ;  Meanwhile the work of desolation went furiously on. The flames roared with a horrid jubilation showers of sparks whirled swiftly upward; and the' black smoke, gathering luridly overhead, floated silently off into the darkness beyond.  The whole building was now wrapped in a sheet of leaping, blinding fire, except one solitary portion.  That wasa sort of observatory, such as is often seen on Southern houses of thie old style, consisting of ,an uncovered 'platform, near the centre of the building -raised a few feet above the highest point of the roof, and enclosed with a  broken balustrade. It could only-be reached by a  stairway ascending from the inter ior of tile house. Thatportion of the old structure, having so-far escaped the' destroyer, stood sharply and vividly revealed, an island in a surging mass of flame. t was soon to become the point of absorbing interest. Slowly, as the triumphant fire was tossing and sweep- ing around it, reserving that last nmorsel of the doomed mansion for its terrible feast, a hunlman figure, emerging by the nterior stairway already spoken of, was seen rising into view.  A shout, fierce and derisive, from the jubilant negroes greeted its appearance, for who could be there at that time except the hated trader, their new master, and the murderer of poor Jefferson? Quickly, however, the shout died away, as the devoted man gained his feet and turned his face towards the jeering specta- tors. He was Ruy Grandaville! How utterly hopeless his situation, he seemed to real-   A4 Woman's Vengeance.     S33 ize at a glance. Turn which way he might, he was belted with fire. Calmly folding his artns, he looked about him with the stoicism of a martyr. All were not so composed. ' A scream, so wild, so loud that it rose even above the roar of the flames and the crash of falling timbers, rent the air, and Isabella sprang towards the blazing mass. Her purpose, whatever -it might have been,: was to-fail., A sudden current of blinding air and smoke meeting her, bore rather than drove her back, and left her lying insen- sible, but secure from the hungry flame; The doomed man, amid all that terrible surrounding, caught the sound, and his eye witnessed the act. Bend- ing eagerly forward he stretched forth his hands. A look of horrible agony passed over his face. His lips moved, but before a word he uttered could be caught, a crashing sound arose that drowned every other. - The fire had won its final victory. Roof, observatory and all went *down into the red, seething billows below. A pillar of flame and smoke, and crackling, flying fragments shot upward, and everything was!lost in the whirl and rush of an indescribable commotion.  When the appalled and blinded spectators again looked on the scene, all was changed. The old mansion was gone. -Both it and its master had disappeared. Naught remained but an indistinguishable, sweltering mass of fire.   CHAPTER XV. NORTHWARD BOUND AND CONCLUSION. 'N the day, and at the hour, of the interrupted wedding, a vessel about to sail for New York- was lying at the New Orleans, levee. Steam 1 t'   was up, the cargo was on board, the pilot was at his post, the captain was impatiently pacing the deck, and yet the commnand to unmoor was not given. Sud- denly, however, a carriage was driven to the landing, a female closely enveloped, as became one who was mani- festly an invalid, was lifted out and carried on board the ship, followed by an old woman and one other attendant and then was conveyed to a state-room in which she and her companions. disappeared. The carriage, having thus disposed of its inmates, was driven away as rapidly as it came; and the plank connecting it with the shore being drawn in, the vessel moved out into the stream, and was soon speeding away on its voyage. 'The person thus carried on board, as the reader will readily infer, was Isabella, before known as Isabella Cas- tellos.- 'She was still in a great measure unconscious, but plied with restoratives she began to exhibit signs of a clearer comprehension. It was evident, from her occasional ex- clamations, that her mind, as far as it was capable of any distinct conception, was running on the exciting incidents through which she had just .passed. "Father, father, I am still your child!" she would cry out with a sudden start; and then she would sink back into a weary rest even more painful to the beholder. **  . . -    Northward  ozund andd Conclusion.-  335 But gradually, soothed by the tireless efforts of her attendants, assisted, as they were, by the dreamy motions of the boat, she went off into a more natural slumber, broken only at increasing intervals ; and as the night was passing into the morning, seemed to be enjoying a health- ful and refreshing rest. All the night long, Aunt Esther, for she was the elderly person referred to; sat by the couch of the worn and deli- cate girl, without closing her eyes. There was a troubled look upon her brow, such as it had seldom shown; and well there might be'. Had she not dragged that poor creature down from a position of envied eminence to the very lowest in the world's estimation? Birth, wealth and social rahk had all been stripped from the slumberer lying so helplessly there, in an instant and by a single blow, and she-that silent watcher by her side-was alone responsible for their loss. No wonder she awaited, with painful solicitude the waking moment. It came at last. Isabella opened her eyes, just as the rays of the rising sun had reached her couch. She looked about her won- deringly for a moment, and then closed them again. It was evident that she was recalling, one by one, the inci- dents through which she had passed, and thus was ex- plaining to her own mind, as best she could, the mystery of her situation. O, how the heart of that old woman by her side, dur- ing that interval, beat and throbbed!l The trial was soon to be over. Opening her eyes once more, and turning them "on Aunt Esther, Isabella began: "Mother!  That word told everything. It was a recognition of the new relation she was about to sustain to the} woman   336   !  The Sisters of Orleans. addressed. The term "mamma " might be employed by an affectionate mistress in speaking to a faithful servant, but "mother" was the language of a daughter to a parent. : Before she could say another word, the old woman's arms were about the speaker, straining her to her bosom. ! O, child, child, you have so relieved my heart! I was afraid you would never forgive me." "Forgive you, mother! I had nothing to forgive. I know what you mean, but the wrong was not towards me. You did right in exposing the imposition. If I was not the lawful heir, I had no business with the position. And if I have lost a father I have gained a mother; but oh, poor, poor, dear, dear father!" At this point the speaker broke down completely, hid- ing her face on her mother's bosom. Soon, however, regaining her composure, she proceeded: "I dreamt as I was awaking, mother, that my sister, Isabella, had become the wife of Ruy Grandaville. Is it so?  "I presume it is, child. Ruy wanted to marry you for the property; and when he found!t to belong-to the other one, he would not miss his opportunity of securing, it. I think his heart inclined him more to your sister than to yourself." "Then my dear sister has been raised in my fall, and my father will still have a- daughter to love-thank Heaven!" "But where are we, mother?" exclaimed Isabella, looking about upon the strange objects surrounding her. "This room seems to move. J Is this not a vessel, and are we not upon the water?" "Yes, child, we are upon the water-going to that Northern country you were speaking of, where there are   Northward Bound and Conclusion.    337 no slaves, and where the children are not forever cursed because of their parents' blood." "O, then we will see the mother of that good, dear young man who died for the like of you and me, and we can comfort her with tidings of the dead!" "Yes, my dear child, we will see her, and we will com- fort her; but it will not be with tidings of the dead, but of the living." "What do you mean, mother?" "You shall see." With that the old woman left the room, and very soon returned. But she did not return alone. Charles Brown and Isabella once more had met in the land of the living.     A Not long after the incidents above described, the slave- boy, Tully, in passing along one of the streets of New Orleans upon an errand for his master, Seabry Anthony, Esq., was attracted by a crowd of people, partly colored and partly white, collected about some object of more than ordinary interest. Elbowing his way among them to the interior circle, he found an old man in a thin and tremulous voice appealing to the persons about him. He was tall, and in person and apparel gave evidence of former dignity and consequence, but now it was plain enough that he was a wreck both in body and mind. The weak, indecisive expression of his countenance, and the hopeless, hungry look of his eyes, as well as the lan- guage he was using, showed that his reason was unset- tled. Nothing could be more pitiful than the imbecile, helplessly eager way in which, turning from one to an- other, he repeated over and over his appeal:   338      The Sisters of Orleans. "Have you seen my daughter? She was white; they lied when they said she wasn't. She has good blood  noble blood, I tell ye. Oh! have you seen her? Tell me, have you seen her?" "What does the old cove say?" cried some one on the outskirts of the crowd. "He wants ter find his gal," shouted one from the in- terior. "Has any ovyer chaps got her?" And then there was a loud, thoughtless laugh. "Stand aside there," exclaimed a powerful, well-dressed man, forcing his way through the throng of idlers. "Are ye not ashamed to be making sport of one like him?" Reaching the side of the old man, the new-comer took his arm and led him away like a child, but casting about  him, as he went, a look of helpless, piteous inquiry. A few days after the incident just described, the New Orleans papers announ'ced the death of Ferdinand Cas- tellos, containing at the same time lengthy obituary no- tices full of praises of his life and character. A  short time passed, and the same papers contained an advertisement subscribed by Seabry Anthony, describing himself as "administrator of Ferdinand Castellos, de- ceased," wherein a liberal reward was offered for any information which would lead to the finding of Isabella, daughter and sole, heiress of the deceased intestate. The reward was never claimed, because the desired information was never furnished. After the night of the ,burning of Ruy Grandaville's mansion-house, Isabella, the legitimate daughter of -Ferdinand Castellos, wholly disappeared. Some thought she had taken her own life; others that she had changed her name, and taken refuge in a convent. The only thing positive was that the most diligent inquiry failed to reveal any trace of her; and the large estate that was rightfully hers, remained to occupy   Norlhward Bound and Conclusion.    339 the courts, and eventually th enrich the lawyers, among whom, it is scarcely necessary to add, that Seabry An- thony, Esq., was one of the chief beneficiaries. That very respectable gentleman continued to increase in wealth and his own estimation, until the breaking out of the rebellion, when, being a Southern man, and a slave- holder, he espoused the cause of treason; and upon the arrival in New Orleans of the Union troops under Gen- eral Butler, he was not only compelled to leave the city, but lost a considerable portion of his property, including Tully. The war was over, which had brought doubt and ap- prehension -and mourning to millions of hearts, and to others hope and gladness, because it brought them free- dom. Boston had a gala-day. Her heroes who had sur- vived the battle for the nation's life, were returning to their homes, and her patriotic population had turned out with banners and music and grateful words to meet and welcome them.  Among the handsome equipages that lined the princi- pal streets through which the procession was expected to  pass, was one that attracted more than ordinary attention. It was an open barouche, of elegant construction, in which were seated a lady and two children. The happy countenance of the lady, notwithstanding a complexion that indicated a Southern origin, can be readily accounted. *for, when it is known that she was the wife of Colonel Charles Brown, then commanding a Union regiment that had been stationed for some time in New Orleans, and which was that day to make part of the expected pro- cession.             ..   340      The Sisters of Orleans. The younger child, a sprightly boy of five or six, who was bravely dressed out in a suit of blue and a military cap, and who carried in his hand a miniature national flag, resting his arms upon the lady's lap, and looking up anxiously in her face, asked: "Mamma, will papa never go away to war any more?" "No, Ferdie dear, he will ,never go to war again; for now we are to have peace." As she' said this, the proud and happy mother bent down and pressed a kiss upon the glowing cheek of her boy, upon which at the same time fell a tear not born of unhappiness. But just then a great cheer arose. The military had come in sight. The swords of the officers and the bright bayonets of the rank and file gleamed in the sun. Ban- ners that had gone through many a battle-storm, and bore upon them the marks of the conflict, swayed and flashed as with the pride of victory. Nearer and nearer came the music and the roll of the drums, and pretty soon was heard the tramp, tramp, tramp of the veterans who were executing their last march amid the cheers and welcomes of grateful countrymen. O, it was a gallant spectacle, and a joyous one! At the head of the regiment which, on account of its honorable service, had been assigned the leading place in the procession, rode a tall and graceful officer, yet in the prime of life, who was honored, as he rode forward, with round after round of applause. Pleasantly, but gravely, he acknowledged the compliments he received from time to time; but O! what brightness lit up his* bronzed and manly features as, coming opposite the barouche already spoken of, he caught the tearful smiles of that happy mother, and witnessed the exultant, gleeful happiness of the dancing, shouting children by her side. "         -    Northward Bound and Concl'usion.   341 There was not a soldier in that regiment but was proud to have it known that he had served under Col- onel Charles Brown; and certainly there was not among all those who had followed and served with him, one who, on that auspicious day, was more grateful and happy, nor had greater reason to be so, than Tully, once a slave, but now a freeman. Having become attached to the com- mand of Colonel Brown, first as his body servant, in the South, he had accompanied him to the North, and that lday followed him, with the consciousness that he was henceforth to know him as his benefactor and friend. Slowly, column on column, rank on rank, moved on those battle-tried warriors, with their burnished arms, their shot-torn banners, their great grim-mouthed cannon, and their pealing, stirring music, until the glorious pa- geant passed and faded away; the carriages, with their joyous occupants, one after another disappeared; and the thousands who- had gathered to welcome and honor the returning heroes went to their homes, rejoicing in the knowledge that a work, in the results of which mil- lions were to be blessed, had been nobly,%bravely done. So ends my story.

The history of our life as a nation loses both its philosophical and its practical importance if separated from the,/history of the- Revolution. A careful study of the War of Independence would have saved us thousafnds of lives and millions of money in the War of the Rebellion. Next to the life of Washington, it is in the life of Greene that this history is to be sought : nbr can it be fully understood wita- out reading both.
