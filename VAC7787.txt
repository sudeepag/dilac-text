TEE history of the world is, and has always been marked by progression
and regression. And as we see the wrld emerging from darkness, or retro-

~he present age, especially inour country, ia 'distinguished for great light,

This work is founded on facts: this I solemnly aver-I will not pretend
to say that I have not embellished; but many of the occurrences I describe, -

I have adopted the.double 1~arrative and Dramatic form something differ-

The hero of this tale, Nelse is still living, and I have faithfully followed
the side of truth in his relation.
The names of the persons are false names; for instance, the real name of
"Morse," is Moore; a wholesale can~y" maker on, Main st., Louisville.
~RuskV is Rust, Lexington, Jawer; an so on, I have varied the real names
throughout.
Some ma~ ask, why is there not more negro language? The reason is
with some exceptions that most of the slaves talk the English language as
properly as we do ourselves.
If any part seems to appear too violent, I solemnly declare that I have

into the world to abolish sin and

followed, made it their object to abol-
ish false systems of worship. Men
have used every means to abolish in-
~'m prance. And now these Aboli~
onists of whom you talk, saw that
Slavery was a damning blot upon the
land,~ and abolished it in their own

Hennie directed their attention to

now passed away, and the lovers look-

which they would be united forever.
But fatal destiny! -
Mr. Puver~i had been-Q~listener to
the-school teacher's conversation with
a slave, who -had repentiy been pur- -
chased ~'~r the plantation~, His suspi.-
cions were aroused, and he soon
found owi ~the n~iscbief that 'Mr. Hor-
ton; 1~d - don~-the lioi~ of his nature
ro~ised, and he resolved that such
a man shouldAi~ver possess k~s daugh-

heait he; ~o~teinpjat.~d the perpetra-
.tioi~ of 'a criment the~ecital of which
we-shrixk back with lx~i'ror. -'
- It~'was one 9f the1 wll4eet' winter

ea4b, an4 the overcast ~kies ~~trctch.-

of day into the gloom-of night. -
''On this. -Sa1~urday,~ -Mr. Puverne-
haviug..~ome busin~ss -to transact at
some distance'. as ;Ii.-~---, invited
the school-teache to accompany him.
~The invitation - was- readily accepted, -
and after diimer they-mounted their~.
horses and left 4 use.
After ridi ng. the main road
for s9me.Aist&amp;rice,~hey branched off

into a bye-path in the woods. An
eastern person has but - a slight idea
of the roads out West. For miles
you will squeeze through the-narrow
openizigs of the forest, then mount-
ing some steep acclivity on the other
side, ~rou descend into a low valley, at
the bottom of which you suddenly
plunge into a swamp from which you
find it difficult to extricate yt~urself.
This is the reason that horse-back rid-
lag is so universally in vogue in all
of the southern and western states.
The two riders continued in the
narrow path, their way becoming
mere and more 'tangled, till at length
jhe thick brushwood and fallen trees
prevented their further progress alto-
gether.
At the suggestion of Mr. Duverne,
they both' dismounted,- and tied their
horses. "We are now,'? -said Mr.
as they proceeded --through
the narrow openings. "-sixteen miles
from home.' It is neiirly night, and
I am right glad that our place of des-
tination is well nigh at hand. Mr.
Horton, I am as you -know a slave- 1
holder. The estate I now own is in-']
herited from my father who ~was of
French descent,; though born in Virgi-
nia. Coming in this manner into pos-
session of a-large'- fortuneMr. Horton -1
what could I do? Itwouldnotbehuman 'I
nature if a person would refuse such
gifts,' and prefer t~ remain in absolute
beggary; for, to tell the truth, I, al-
though, a slave-owner, abhor the very
n~ime of Slavery, and it is my firm re-
solve to emancipate my slaves in' a
few years, at' the 'longest. But ho! 1
Here we are I"                - -
And now they had arrived at a
small log house, alu~ost hidden, from
view by briars, underwood ai~d rocks, r
It was a wild place, this spot. -Gi-
gantic trees drifted by the 'lightening .1
into countless eplhrt~s loomed up I
against the cold sky.; Huge racks I
covered with the teen moss of cantw. r

ries projected over yawning precipi-
ces, and the wildness of the scenery
was indescribable. That' small hut so
still-.with no signs of life-so fbi
away from any human habitation
seemed to be a fit place for the ao-
complishment of nefarious designs.
'4vMr. Duverne !" exclaimed the
now alarmed school-teacher. "Why
have you brought me to this place?
I feel a presentiment of evil, and I
think that we had better return."
"We will see 1" replied- the Ken-
tucky planter as he disappeared be-
hjnd the mound in front of the cabin.
In a few moments he. returned with
something that resembled a human
being. He was diminutive in stature,
not more than four :~nd a half feet
high-he was humpbacked-his legs
bent in the shape ofbows-his head
res9mbled. a bullet in shape-in ph~c~
of eya lasbes, there' was a broad, red
stripe 'upon - his eye lids-his nose
seemed to have bean eaten off - by
u~x~e disease, and the nostrils were

And they carried the dead man to

an effort they threw him over. The

good nature '(for he had never been'
known to get angry buti~nce, during""
his life,) and greaV wealth h~ad been K'
the cau~e of promoting' him to xnauy'
offices despite the "softness" that
marked him 'from men~f "cents."
'Hewas 'a short, thick set man, of:
great corpulency. His 'white' flabby

"bristles" 'was butIi~d up into a pyr-

tart of himself was industriously
knitting upon a stocking with varie-
gated colors for "baby's," the two lit-
tle beings that were seated upon the
floor, playing with the "old tom-
cat." Never were resemblances mbre
striking-" like father--.like the fam-
ily I" It was truly a fat house-
hold.
One held the feline creatures head,
while the other tugged with might
and main at the tail; the a~irnal
bore this martyrdom with evident dis-
like, as its low growls and struggles
attested. At length, roused beyond en-
durance, it uttered a fearful yell, and
a battle ensued. Then there was
scratching and pulling, and scream~
ing and cries of

"The baby's-the baby's I" shriek-
ed Mrs. Tinkey, as she rescued her
"darlings" and placed them in the
arms of her hu~~ ud; then seizing
the tongs,: a rsuit commenced.
When the enraged lady raised her
weapon to annihilate the~" critter," it 1
was sure to dodge under a table or

by Ii~*ing her fore paws.
Atilils juncture, the door bell rang, T
and~Mr. 'Pum Potter was ushered in. a

from the farm-houses. It was about.

far away into the distance, seemed to

"Ndw, we have some clue to the

said the rest, and the party dispersed
to carry out their nefari6ua designs.
Aunt Polly had originally belonged
to a Mr. O'Neil, a very humane man,
who gave her the chance of PuTchas-
ing her libertyfrom the ext*:means
that she~ could lay by. Slowly, but
surely, the little savings accumulated,
and at the end of fort~r eight years,
she joyfully proffered the desired sum I
to 'her owner. It was accepted, and
she was 6'ee ~the winds.
She had been twice. married; but
both of her husband's had died. -She
had a son by her first,, called Anse;
now aged eighteen who belonged to 1
Squire Moody. Her other two, Tony 1
andJanie, were as yet mere infants.
'~Her son, Anse, had? built her a
cabin in a little glen in the woods, at
a short distance from town, and here c
she had thought of passing her last m

da in quietude and happiness. Be-
ing free, ,she sympathized with the
poor slave, and Anse, also had per-
mitted fugitives on several occasions
to remain harbored in the house of
his mother.
On the day following, as Old Aunt
Polly. was seated in the door, with
the little ones playing at her feet, she
was surprised to see Constable Sliy-
der approaching her, accompanied by
two assistants.
"How is you, Massa Snyder I"
said the old negresswith 'her usual
pleasant smile, and~. brushing down
her apron as she arose from her
seat.
The ster~i officer was a man of few
words arid without heeding her greet.
ing, he replied. "Aunt Folly, piok
up your duds, and ~bllow me, for you
are to be sold to-morrow at lime
o'clock. So make haste I"
The flice of the negress changed
from its blackness to a lighter shade;
and pressing her hands against hey-
temples asif to prevent their burst-
in~, she staggered against the door-
post, while a deep groan echoed
from the depths of her very soul.

lips moved, but no words came forth.
His limbs gradually stiffened-a shiv-

glazed eye closed forever. And thus
he died-the 'noble, the brave, and
true.
The next day he was buried. And'
there were tears shed above his grave
by many, for well did he deserve'
them. (Ancient history tells us of a
warrior who died, and whose lifeless
body was left dis-entombed on the
arid plains; but the winds sprung up,
and heaped above his form, a mound
of sand, from 'which palm- trees and
bright flowers grew forth. A spring'
of water also gushed up.
And at this oasis the tired caravan
paused. The weary camels quenched
their thirst, the traders refreshed
themselves, and performed their mys-
terious religious, rites beneath the
spreading shade. Though the grave
of the "down-trodden" was not form-
ed like that, yet it was suited to its
occupant as well. It was in a quiet
nook, where tall trees towered upward
to heaven. Where the songs of birds,

"knocked down" to a Mr. Morse, a

Thus the sale continued until all
were sold. Some to go. to New-Or-

and lamentations they were ruthless-

to their leaving. .
(It's a hard sight this-a sla~ve auc-

no cares, that theirs-is a life of hap-:
piness, when contrasted with the ex-
treme poverty of the free negroes.

But it will not do-I say it will not
do.' It is a damning curse, and those
who advocate slavery, know it. * We  -
know it. It' is against the laws of
reason and conscience.
We enslave them because they are
of a darker shade than. ourselves.
Because God has not given them our .
advantages, we trample upon them. I
Thepe are the reasons. -
Our striped flag, waving its tri-
,umphant folds from every nook of
the habitable globe, and sweeping
with the storm-clouds above the
mighty deep, is indeed, a fit emblem.

on this (Friday) night, given a ball
in honor of his sons birth day. The
elite of Kentuckyr were there assem-

sitely beautiful women were moving
in the mazy dance, or promnenading
arm in arm around the room. There
was o'ne-the belle of the evening.
Who she was, none knew. Proud,
and Juno-like in her bearing, *she
moved like a queen above all others.
Lovely as a dream was she, surpass-
ing even the haughty beauties there. ~
*Her dark, oval orbs languished volup-
tuously-her delicate complexion was -

of slavery. It is this that will prolong
the curse. The punishments may in
time become less severe, the "traffic"
may eventually cease. But does this
suffice? No 1 It must be swept
from our land. The motto of our
ancestors was "the rights to take a
pound, implies the right to take a
thousand." So with Slavery I The
right to enslave mildly implies the right
to enslave severely. The latter method
of enslavement will always continue
the most in vogue, if we judge the
future by the past.

POLITICS.-4HE DUEL.
ELECTIONEERING out west is a dif-
ferent thing from elecfioneeriug here,
in-the East. If the candidate expects
to be successful, he must ri around
the country, and make a long speech
at evety. cross-road. He must happen
to be at all of the horse races to
bet 'and "spout." He must buy a
q~santity of "Old I~ourlon Co. Whis-
key'" and set tho "stream a running"
for~the ." rested travellers" to quench
their thirst. He must enter every
log2 cabin, to -flatter the "'wf~min,"
kiss t'lie babies, and talk to the . men
about the "crops." Besides' this, he
must have grqat fecundity, and un-
derstand human nature. If the as-
piraiit possess not these qualities his
chances for political preferment are
small.
Mr. Tinkey, and Aminidab Mar-
shall were the two opposing, candi-
dates for the borough of Lans--
downe.
Tinkey, Esq., voted the "demi-
krat," and Aminidab, the "tig wig-
get."
*       On the day in question, the two
warriors had unsheathed their "swords
of controversy" in a "Oampbellite"
meeting-house, in k-i!.
"Gentlemen l" said Mr, Tinkey

rising with great dignity. "1 say
gentlemen's! I am before yous this
day, to ask for your votes. (Ap-
plause.) I am known to you, my
feller conspicitents. (Tremendous ap-
plause.) I was born a little boy
among you, only reaching up to my
knee. (Cheers.) I tell ye'r I want,

Tinkey.
"You lie I" yelled Marshall from
the other end of the platform, "and I

in great cJnfusion. For blood had to

We look, around at the crowded gal-
leries, then at the august representa-
tives of~ a nations power. All is si-
lence, savethe low hum of many voices.
At length the" hammer calls to or-
der. Now a tall, and aged man slow-
ly raises from his seat. He looks up~
on the attentive crowd, and his deep
voice echoes-" Mr. Speaker." What
a breathless stillness falls upon the au-
ditory? Hew their very souls seem
to be riveted upon the subject? What
i&amp; the cause of this attentiveness. I
will tell you.
But yesterday a handbill was post-
ed up in themarket place, announcing
that one Henry Clay-a man fresh
from the wilds of Kentucky, who was
formerly "The Mill-Boy of the Slash-
es," was to speak ~n the subject of
Slavery Compromise in the Senate.
Why,~ this excitement, then? Why
did multitudes pause suddenly in the
street, and gaze upon those flaming
characters V Why did eome knit
their brows, and compress their~ lips,
hissing-" the Abolitionists-the most
villan~us of sIb-the vile Abolition-
because a furious faction was
~"the nation to its very centre
and arrayed against each other, were
the frierijis ofLiberty, and the adhe-
rents of Slavery.
So, ott this day, they had swsem-
bled to hear the words which fellfropi
the lips of the "backwoods orator."
Ai~d why had his sentencessuch pow-
er. Thereason was, that they came
spontaneously from the ~ieart-..they
were.nol4inged with affectation-.--they'
were the eu~ouriuga of Nature
A~ain he spoke. "Mr. Speaker,
this is an eventful day. The transac-
tions of this day will be recorded in
our national historyand be handed
down toftiture posterity." ~Thus he
commenced, and his spiriV~' soared
into ut~explored mazes of"~rofound
knowledge. Metaphar, simile, and

syllogism came to his aid, and for
three long hours he seemed .insensi~~
blc to all around. At last amid
thunders of applause he resumed his
seat.
He was followed by the youngest
senator in the house, Charles Ather-
ton, the author. He had been re-
cently elected, and on this occasion he
was to make his debut.
As there always is on such occa-
sions, the greatest curiosity prevailed
to learn what his views were.
His manners and actions were* at
first so awkward, that an involuntary
titter ran through the crowd of spec-
tatora; l~'ut as he proceeded he warm-
ed with. his subject. Then the sweat
stood in huge globules upon his highr
white forehead-his blue eye darted
around like lightning-his'~estures
becax~e as graceful as the waving wil-
low, and his sad silvery voice had a
magic spelt which bound the heart.
He became ~rancendentally eloquent.
Worjls, sciences, politics, and laws
were but stepping stones-he went
further. His vigorousintellect went
forth, and dwelt among new theo-
rems, biased "on "~JogicaI deductions,
and poised with undiscovered si~ns
and prophecies, the existence of which
had before been doubted~ His rea-
sonings were conclusive, and every
hypothesis tenabld.
The audience were spell-bound.
Astonishment was depicted in every
feature. It was so silent that you
might have heard the beatings of
many hearts-it was painful to breath.
Still those silvery cadences seemed
to come and melt away to the ear
like .&amp;liau Symphonies. They satr
the p~or bleeding slave as he was-
they saw the infuriated overseer in
his most diabolical colors..-..they saw
the gross darkness ~ which pervades
the mind of man in relation to Slave-
ry. Yes! I say that they saw these
things, and it was &amp;n arrow U con-

eviction piercing to their ~ouls And
there were slave-holders there-men,
rough, stern, and unfeeling who wept
when they heard the cruelties which
they themselves had often perpetra-
ted as described by Senator Ather-
ton.
When ~the speaker had ended, no
shouts of applause greeted his ears.
There was no occasion Tor any-the
subject was too dee p -too soleinn.-
But whkihever way he turned, tearful
eyes met his gaze, and low sighs came
soft upon his ears from those "fair
ones" who are averse to all chains ex-
cept the ones which they throw around
the "lords of creation."
Atherton's triumph was complete,
and though ~sfte"rwards obnoxious laws
were passed, yet" many things which
would haverendered them still more
odious were rejected through the in-
fluence of the Abolition speaker.

CHAPTER XXV.
NELSE.
ABOUT this time, a child was born
tome. M~r joy~knew no bounds~ and
for a time in my solicitude for the lit-
tle stranger, I forgot my many woes.
Day after day, she grew apace, and~
her features were the exact counter-
part of hermother's, regular and beau-
tiful. 'Zilly, for that was her name,
was a gentle child. Poor little slave.
I thanked God that he implanted in-
fantile unconsciousness within her
breast so that she saw not the misery
in store for her future years.
On the bright Sabbath mornings, I
always hastened to the cabin of Fi-
dole. Then with little Zilly in icy
arms, I would walk to the green shade~
by the crystal waters of "the little
creek, and then I was happy. Hap.
py in my love for my wife and' child..
On~ day, I called as usual, and was
surprised to find little Zilly in a burn-
ing fever, and very ill. Fidele pre-
veiled upon. me by her earneat"solici-'
tations to remain with her-during the'
night... Towards morning the ~young
sufferer fell into a. gentle' slumber, and
with my heart filled with the hope of
her speedy recovery, I retui~ned to the
plantation The' first person that I
saw was the overseer; a cloud had
gt~thered upon his brow. "Nelse, you
rascal where have you been-how did
you dare to remain out overnight?"
"My child was ill, and I thought to
watch by its side."
"Tending your black brat. 'Well,
that's a pretty story. If the thing
wants to die, who cares
"I care I" I replied firmly.'
"None of your sauce, Nelse, or by
heavens, I'll stripe you I"
"I am not afraid-for I have done
xo harm."

*         "You d.- scoundrel! Off with
*      your jacket!',
"I shall not, sir.!"
The enraged supervisor rushed to-
*       wards me; but before he reached me
I seized a~small board, and.atru,~k him
to the ground, where he lay br some
time insensible.
The whole circle now sallied out,
and I was beund hand and foot. I
had committed an unpardonable sin,
according to the views of my oppres-
sors-for to their'ey~s, the person of
the overseer is sacred, and we be to
the poor-negro who resists his power.
Well, what do you think was my
~ punishment. Conceive of the most
horrible infliction of pain. Conjure
up the most direful image of torture,
and you will faUshort. You will not-
cannot have an idea of my sufferings.
TAey~deformed me! Yes, it is too
horrible for belief!! They changed
the shape of .that body which God had
created.
For six long monthawas I chained
in a damp, dark dungeon under the I
ground. My shoulders were bound
around with cords, a~d my head was
drawn down, soth~t my chin rested up-
onmy breast. Thuiwasi suffered to~ re~
skialn, without seeing th~ light of day,
except only ~a few- glimmering rays
when one of the slaves brought me a
dry crust, and a cup~of impure water.
All the rest of the time it was night
'.black midniglft. ,Half of the suf-
ferings I there endured as the long,
long hours passed drearily away, my
tongue can never tell. It seemed as
if I was' in pandemonium, the sole sur-
river, for all others were dead.'-.-there
was a loud ringing forever in my ears
-my blood ceased in its circulation,
and my body became so numb, and
painless that you Might have pierced
to ~he very bone,.and I would have
felt it not. Reason tottered on its'

throne, and my aching brain was filled
with images of dying infants, weep.
ing mothers, and crazy. fathers. At
times I laughed, so horribly, so fear-
fully, that at' the sound thereof, cold
chills like crawling serpents caine up-
on my hack. Then again I would set
for entire days without having the
least recollection-all would be blank
and obscured. God, knows how I
ever regained my reason, I do not.-
For I was mad there-in that dark-
some hole. It's a tale of diabolical
malice, and the quicker I relateit,,the
better, for when the memo~ of those
hours crosses my mind, I shedder
from my very soul, with strange hor-
ror.'
When I awoke from my stupor I
was lying in my own bed. I ti)rned'
to look around wh~en ~ sudden twinge
of pain shot through my back. I en-
deavored to rise, and now I found
9ut that I was kump4ackecj. That I

gladdened my heart, and I thanked

me of every solace.

Mr. Duverne bad resolved to take
a pleasure excursion in company with
Ada and Verni. The eventful day at
last came, and the trio took their do-
parture~ Thd~y visited Niagara~ Falls,
and were lost in coiiten~pIa~ting the
.grandeur of Nature 's most sublime
works. Verni had a taste for the
beautiful, and he passed. whole days

the most intricate caverns, lie gazed
at the shifting rainbows.circling above

loitd thunders of the Lataract.
After remaining at the "J~'alls" for
some time~ they left for Saratoga, to
participate in its giddy pleasures-to
swill down champagne, and to flutter
around the blaze of fashion.
Among the visitors, was one Col.
Sanford, a wealthy planter who resi-
ded at New-Orleans. He became ac-
quainted with Mr. Duverne, and was
by' him introduced to his daughter
(unnat~iral daughter) Ada. Her e~c-
treme beauty, her natural grace, and
great vivae.ity won the regards of the
Southerner, and he became her con-
stant companion. lie rode out with
her, he danced with her, and they took
moonlight walks together. The sea-
son was now about over, andMr. Du-

RODDEN; OR,
verne left for Philadelphia, Col San-
ford accompanying the party. They.
remained in the city two months, at-
tending balls, parties, and soirees. At
the end of that time the stranger in-
formed Mr. Duverne that he had ob-
tained the consent of his daughter, and
if he would. acquiesce the marriage
ceremonies would immediately take
place. The consent was given, and
the day fixed,. It was rumored through-
out the fashionable circles that the
rich Col. Sanford was soon to be~ uni-
ted to the lovely brunette who had
caused such a sensation.
The night at length came. The
wedding was to be consummated ~t the
princely mansion of Mr. Archer No.
~O Franklin Square. The rooms were
filled to overflowing with invited
guests. Lights were flashing-around
music gave forth its sweetest strains,
and costly perfumes were wafted
through the apartments. And there
were women, beautiful as a dream,
their. silvery laugh rhiging out as clear
asif they hadnever known a day of sor-
row. Men, too-men ehiyalrous, and
handsome.
The couple stood up to be united.
And now a death-like stillness fell up-
on the assemblage, all eyes were di-
recf~ed toward the splendid pair. And
Ada-Oh, she was wondrously, sur-
passingly b tiful. ~Never w~s being

aroup4 her shoulders in a thousand
glorious ringlets-her large, midnight
eyes shone lustrously, and her bosom
swelled like ~ heaving wave of the
ocean-she appeared to be so happy.
Her dress was of white satin, and she
was decorated profusely with jewelry.
And at that hour-when~ a deep
stillness was around, and solemnity
marked each face, a shrill voice was
heard in the hall, and the door was

burst open while a being entered.-
This being was a negress! She was
so old, that her crisped hair was as
white as the driven snow. Her flesh
hung in folds upon her stiffened bones
-her upturned eyes revealed a horri-
ble ~vhite, and her grinning teeth
chattered together. The company
stood mute as if the "Witch of En-
dor" was before them. "I've trabelled
all de w~y from Ole Birgiany to come
hero. Ohwa I ohwa I" And her
loud, shrill voice struck a chill to ev-
ery heart, but no person stirred.
"Yes,~~ said she, "ye're a fine gem-

brow. The bride fell insensible to the
floor, and the old negresa disappear-

as if they doubted their senses; but
when they looked around, she was
gone.
Au universal shriek of horror re-
sounded through . the apartments.-.-
The bridegroom stood transfixed to
the floor, his whole form quivering
like an aspen leaf, his eyes glowing
beneath his shaggy brow like living
coals. "Incarnate fiend I" burst
from his lips---" Demon, what dam..
fling contrivance impelled you to palm,
off you foul offspring-the child of
a negress upon me. Deceiver I Take

drew a revolver from his breast pock..

Sanford believing that he had slala
him fled from the house.
This was &amp; tragic conclusion. Some
of the party swooned away-others
were carried out screaming, and all
was confusion.
A few gathered around the wound-

he was confined 'to his room, and the
agojiy he suffered was great. Verni,
in the meantime had departed for
Kentucky,' but Ada remained.
Spring was now at hand, and Mt.
Duverne was impatient to proceed
home. According y, they proceeded
to Hnrrisburgh, by railroad, and then
to2k a stage coach to finish another
part of their journey. For six days
they had passed through the beautiful
scenery, and rough crags which are
found on the high mountainsof the
Key Stone state.
It was a cold, blustery day in March
that the coach stopped at a little inn
on the summit of the Alleghanies. It
was a very old building, and its crazy

Well, as I said, she was sold to a
planter in Old Virginny. Shn man-
aged to escape after remaining in his
service awhile. Since that time she
has wandered amid the fastnesses of
the Alleghanies, and her horrible ap-

for her the cognomen of" The Witch

till to-day.
For three days they rode along in
the coach. At the end of that time
their course was obstructed, for sever-
s.1 bridges had been torn away by
late freshets, consequently they were
obliged to perform a journey of nine-
ty-six miles on foot, before they could
reach the next stage connection.
It was a perilous undertaking, this.
At Qne time swimming deep and rap-

swamps and pathless forests, then
wandering over high hills and' level
plains, the route seemed long and
toilsome. And what must have been

first opportunity which might offer.
But Spunk was an old hunter-wary,

designs of the slave-holder were frus-

LIGHT AND SHADE.
THIRA FAIRCHILD proceeded to
Fraukfort; but her petitions were now
disregarded, for this second trespass of
her father had debared him from ex-
ecutive clemency.
She returned to her home. It was
now noticed by all, that a change had
come over the minister's cottage.
The-smoke no longer curled from the
stone chimney, the shutters were
closed and solitude reigned unclisturb-
ed. The hovers #ere neglected, and
weeds choked up the delicate plants.
Thira was very rarely seen, or if seen,
it was but for an instant for she im-
mediately retired.
The time of her meeting~ Pur-
ceval Maturiz~ had now arrived. '1~ut
it was now winter-eold, blustering
winter. Snows were upon the earth
and tempests came forth from their
hidden lairs.
Night came on apace, and the little
cot shook to~ its very foundation, as
the winds shrieked past. A thousand
times had Thira resolved to fulfil her
promise, and as 'many times Aid she

other consideration, and hastily put..
ting on her shawl and bonnet she sal-

against her flesh, and the cold drift-
ing slows were wafted full into her
face. Onward she went, heedless of
the storm without, f~r a ~atorm was
raging within her, soul-4he conflict
between love, aud duty.
She reached the old gray tree.
Nothing was to be seen. The dry
branches groaned, and it seemed as
if fiends were mocking her from the
tree-tops.
Was Maturin false.-.or had she
come too late?
it *as now midnight. The fury
of the elements had abated, and no
sound broke the solemn stillness save
the continual fall-fall-falling of
snow flakes.
Suddenly a faint groan was borne
upon her ~ar. Her heart panted like
a hammer: she peered with distend-"
ed eyes through the gloom. All was
still I She saw nothing.
Again she stood motionless as a
statue listening forth repetitionof that
sound. The light flakes fell upon her
brow an4 dissolved,~Heurs passed on,
and though she'was perishing with
the cold, an enchainment bound her
to the spot.
The thought that Maturin might
be dying a~nid the snows aroused her.
His piety, his devotion, his love for
hererossed her mind. Then the feel-
ingn of her soul which had been pent
up for years, burst forth, and in a mo-
ment she knew ho~ madly she loved.
She cried, and her voice resounded
far over the dreary waste, 'Turce-
vaL"
r Ah, that word brought a response.
A low, smothered moan followed.-
Thira flew to the place from which the
sound proceeded, and there iay, half
buried in the snowy a dark object.
"Purceval l~' she shrieked.
No answer met her ear. She felt
his face..-~it was like ice. His' pulse

beat not, and his limbs were frozen
stiff.
"Oh, God I" she cried, as she stag-
gered backwards, "I have killed him.
But I will not leave him, I will perish
byliis side! No, he may. still live.
I will save him."
So saying, ~he raised him from his
freezing bed, and being sustained by
hope, bore him, after great exertion;
to the cottage.
She laid him upon a bed before the
blazing fire, bathing his forehead. with
camphor, and chafing his limbs.-
Her efforts were successful, and to-
wards morning the sufferer 'opened
his eyes. He gazed around him ab-
stractedly., "Oh, this horrible dream.
Am I in the land of spirits I"
With a cry of joy Thira rushed to
his side, and was ~nclasped in his
arms.
In a few days the young minister
was able to walk about. When he
had sufficiently recovered, she ques-
tioned him.
"Yes, Thira," he answered, "I had
wandered miles that day amid the
whirling snows, and night fall found
me beneath the trysting tree. You
came not. I thought that you would
appear in time, and hope still linger~
ed within my breast. But when the
long hours had merged into midnight,
then indeed did I despair. Chilled,
and benumbed, I sank upon the
ground. A feeling of drowsiness came
over me, and I dreamed. Scenes,
brigl4 and beautiful, rose before me,
and then I saw you, TEira, holy and
lovely, as when you first burst upon
my sight. And then came thoughts
of my Hoosier hcine, a father and
mother awaiting my return. Then
there came a blank, a dull monotony;
I felt myself to be dying; yet it was
easy dying, so calm, so painless. I,
felt happy. Then the thought of

your seeming unfaithfulness, caused
me to groan. Shortly aftet, I beard
your voice; but it was too late, dark-
ness was around me, and I knew no
more. Now, Thira, you have my
story, and certainly now, you will not
refuse me y~ur hand.
She answered, "Purceral. I had
resolved never to wed. B~ut ziow~ my
father is incarcerated in the ~looiny
dungeons of Kentucky. He is dead
to me now, for I know that he will
not long a~irvive..--death will soon re-

loved you, Purceval-loved you long,
and now I am yours-.-yours forever."
W~will~a8s over the rest. 5i4-
fice it is to say that the lovers were
united. Happiness attended their
steps-.-religion diffused a benign
renity-.--love entwined their heart~, and
the only alloy to their felicity was
the doom of Thira's father.
For aught, we know they still live
in the little einbowered cottage. The
flowers still bloom as sweet-.--pweeter
perhaps than before-and the warm,

JnRRY.-NSL53.~THE ESCAPES
ASOUT this time, my brother Jerry
escaped from his master, and arrived
safely at the land of freedom.-Can-

But in his new situation he was not
contented, and he left, Toronto for Sy-
racuse. Here he remained for some
time; but b1~ed-hounds were on the
scent, and he was one morningg sud-

denly arrested by the slave-holder, and
his friends-the police
He was conveyed to the court-room,
but in the meantime the crowd had
become so immense that the'court
found it necessary to retire to other
quarters; and now came the "tug of
war." One vast, mighty shout came
up from that surging multitude-'
"Save him .Save him."
In vain did the officers of the law
resist; Marshall Fitch, of Rochester,
had his ,a~i broken ii~ the melee.-.
The fugitive was forcibly torn away,
and conveyed t~ a place of saTety.-
He was rescued.
The intelligence of my brother's

CHAPTER XXXIL
*            CONCLUSION.
Wu left Spunk and Mr. Duverne on
the steamer.
It was now near the hour of mid-
night, and' the two, after conversing
- confidentially, Went below to view the
huge glowing furnaces. This oc~u-
pied them for some time.
Presently the hunter went to the
rear of the boat; the planter follQw-
ed-a thought flashed across his
mind. It was but the work of an in-
~tant to push the backwoodsman
through the open space of railing. It
w~s done.
The man clutched on the guards of
the boat, his face was turned npwa~'d,
and on it was depicted baffled venge2
ance intense hate, despair, and horror;
"Do you know who I am I" said the
planter in a deep, low voice, "I am
Ichabold Duverne, the father. of Ver-
ni."
The huge form of the poor wretch
quivered from head to foot, he raised
himself partially up, but his hands
were pushed off, and he disappeared
from the light of. the furnaces, into
the darkness below.
At a short distance he arose, the
reflection on the water revealed his
blanched features upborne by the
waves, and then he sank forever.

Mr. Duverne returned to the saloon'
Here he found a party engaged in
gambling. He joined them.
Opposite to him, sat a young man
whose features were nearly concealed
by a broad rimmed, slouching hat.
Stake after stake was swept away by
him in spite of all the contrivances of
his opponents. At midnight the game.
ended, and the company 'arose from
the table, having lost in all an enor-
mous amount.
The stranger pocketed his ill-gotten
gains, and walked out upon the deck.
It was starlight, and the. monoto-
nous dipping of the wheels broke up-
on the ear; on either side lay the dark
forest banks of the Ohio.
He looked upward at the half ob-
scured moon, and listened to the moan-
ing winds. He felt a hand laid upon
his shoulder-a glittering stiletto
flashed before his eyes.. He turniA.
The dark, ferocious face of Duverne
was turned upon him, embodying the
hidden fires of despairing murder, and
anger.
"Give me the ten thousand dollars

fell low, but fearfully.
The stranger flung his hat far away
-shook back his long, matted locks,
and laughed so ,wildly, so horribly,
that its ringing peals smote upon the
heart of the assailant with a strange,
unknown, freezing power.
"Die! Ha! ha! ha! And is
that not ~hat I have been trying to

Die. Strike-strike here?' And he
bared his bosom for the blow.
The slave-holders arm fell nerveless
by his side.
"Ha! ha !" again broke' out that,
loud, unseeming lAugh. "Do 'you

"Spunk! Zorah I You I" gasped
the father, and he trembled as with
an ague fit.
"I know it. Ha!' ha! Zorah! Oh,

Wherever there was purity, I left the
dark mildew of sin. If I found love,~
happiness, and confidence, I left in its
place, madness, despair, and reckless-

And around this depraved, this
loathsome mass of iniquity, I threw
the net work of religion, purity, and
generosity. I breathed into ~the ear

the misery I inflicted. The spirit of

amid the blackness of desolation, and
bade the gray haired father's curse me,
for it was sweet~nsic to my soul.

There they both stood in the dark~
some night, the father and son, glar-
ing upon each other with deadly. hate.
At length the father broke the si-
lence, he echoed tremulously-" Ver-

The bosom of the gambler swelled
with the pent up emotions of his soul.
"Take thy gold."
And he tore open his vest, and
showered the metal around. It fell
upon' the deck with a ringing sound.
Then with a yell of madness, he
started back a few paces, then sprang
from the high deck into the air. A
dull', heavy splash broke upon the ear,
and Verni Duverne had met a watery
grave.
Then there wis the picture of the
grey-headed father, straining his eyes
through the night gloom as if to see
his child again appear.
The passengers hearing the noise,
rushed out from the cabin, just in time
to prevent the planter from following
his son.
He returned home. But he never
spoke again. His pro erty was scat-

saying, "Ven~eanc~ is mine, I will

Bertoldo, before he quits Sicily
seeks an interview with Camiola to
press his suit with her. We are first
introduced to her accompanied by
Signior Sylli, a mere vain fo~l, who
seems to imagine that every woman
that looks on him must dote on him.
So satisfied is he of his own perfec-
tions, that he has sworn never to take
a wife who cannot hold out a month
against him. The gentleness with
which Camiola ~ndures his fantastic
follies, is an earnest of the noble na-
ture she displays in afl her future life.
While she ispntiently listening to the
warnings of her silly suitor, to be on
her guard against his many perfec-
tions, her waiting-woman informs her
that Bertoldo, the brother of the king,
craves an audience. He is a suitor of
a different sort; for, although Signior
Sylli feels no jealousy, confident that
a woman who had once looked on
him could never love another; yet
we learn from Oamiola herself; that
Bertoldo is a man "absolute and cir-
cular in all those wished-for rairities
that may take a virgin captive,"-a
suitor, whose presence, courtship, and

e loving language, would have endan-
t gered even thechaste Penelope. And
s though she owns, to herself; her love
~, for him, her reason tells her she ought
e neither to yield her love, nor seek'
s his. Bertoldo, entering, salutes her,
, trusting that being a parting kiss will
- qualify his boldness if not altogether
,, excuse it. Oamioi4' disturbe~at the
idea of parting, asks. what nation,
envious of the happiness which S~ily

north-star and guide of all hearts,-
and where he holds so high a position
as brother of the king? Bertoldo,
* keeping out of sight, the fiery heat
* with which he has urged on his en-
* terpr~se, tells her that it is she who
has driven him into exile~-that h~r
unexampled cruelty has' enforced his
absence, and deprived him of those
blessings which she insinuated that
he possessed; and yet she accuses
him of rushing into wilful exile.-
What are titles to him, he says" Or

crown ?-or what would it be even
to be Sovereign of Sicily7 'is~heu she,
who is the essence of his being, the
anchor of his hopes, by her disdain
turns all these blessings 'into deceiv-
ing shadows Camiola protests that
he accuses her without cause. But
Bertoldo still urges her to answer love
with love, and to look on him with an
eye of favor. damiola modestly c~ii-
fesses her love for him, and says,, that
if at that moment all the sceptred
monarchs of the world were his rivals,
and she worthy of such competition,
he alone would carry off the prize.-
But the consciousness of her own
inferiorty 'prevented her indulging
the love she felt. They were like

divided lines, that could never meet
in 'one centre. His birth alone was
an am~1e dowry for one of fairer for-
tunes; his personal appearance above
'all value, elren if he were ignoble';
and his mind- "so furnished with hay-
mopious faculties, moulded from hea-
von," that though he were of no hon-
orablAeseent, as deformed in person
as Thersites, and as beggared in for-
tune as Irus, he still would force all
to admire him. But all these quali-
ties bound uptogether were far above
h~r deserts; she only craves leave to
look upon' them with admiration, but
does not venture top resume she' may
'enjoy them. Bertoldo interrupts her,
to exclaim that he knows of no dis-
parity between them: she is sprung
from a noble family, fair, rich, young,
---every 'way his equal.
~ But Camiola is not to be flattered
out of her sense of right: 'she holds
that the eagle and thh wren cannot
dwell in the same nest; that it is mon-
strous to put tissue an freeze in the
samegarment. "But," she goes on,
"e~n if yonr perfection were dimin-
ished, and my deserts increased, the
strong bar of religion would oppose
our union. You are a knight of
Malta, bound by the holy vows of
your order to a sin le life ; you can-
not marry me; an~ J believe you to
be too honorable to seel my love for
baser ends."
Bertoldo, however,.treats his religi-
ous i~ows very lightly, and thinks a
dispensation of them could be easily
obtained, which would ~entirely ab-
soWe him fr~m them.
But Camiola'~ high and proper no-
tions of honor are shocked at this.-
"Oh, take heed, sir," she says;
"when what is vowed to heaven is
dispensed with to serve our ends on
earth, a curse must follow an#d not a
blessing."

Bertolde, on hearing this, exclaims
Is there no hope left me I"
And Camiola sorrowfully respond;
N~,r to myself; true love should
walk upon equal feet: with usit does
not. In all things, excepting this,
rest' assured I shall be devoted to
your service,"
And this being her determinate
sentence, and riot to be revoked, Ber-
toldo takes leave of-the "fairest cruel,"
resolved that all thoughts of' women
shall perish in hum That as love*
only lends him light to see his folly,
the blaze of war shall extinguish that
dim tape; and glory be his only mis-
tress. ,. And Carojola feels that, after
the fierce contest she has endured,
where love was battling with her
sense of honor, though honor had
gained the victory, yet now that he
was gone, her sun had set never to
rise again.
Bertoldo and his followers having
embarked without taking leave of the
king, who is thereby angered; Ful-
gentie, the king's favorite, takes the
opportunity further to incense the
king against his brother, by making
it appear not only that this was a
gross neglect, but that Bertoldo, and~
those who accompanied him, had
thrown off their allegiance to the
monarch; that they were disaffected
to his person and his government;~ had
discarded their loyalty, and were dan-
g~rous to the State. This determines
the weak king to send messengers to
the Duchess of Sienna, excusing him-
self from having sent these forces
against her, and withdrawing all pro-
tection from them as his subjects.
Astutio selected for this office, and
ordered ~not to spare an oath, if neces-
sary, that the ~king had never con-
sented to it; being reminded that
"swearing for the king, though false,
is no perjury." Astutio had scarcely

needed this injunction, for he tells us,
"they are not fit ~o be state agents
whose scruples of conscience will not
permit them to be prodigal in such
tijiles." Fulg9ntio had a double
~object in view in thus increasing the
king's anger against his brother. His
iiesire was to keep Bertoldo out of
the way first, as he might become a
dangerous rival in the king's affection;
and next, because he knew Bertoldo
'was a hindrance to gaining the love
of Camiola, to whose fortune he
aspired. He reminds the king of his
I. -
promise to aid him in his project on
Camiola, and receives the king's ring
as a pledge that the king will make
(rood whatsoever Fulgentio shall say
entreats or commands. And Ful-
gentio prepares to make his attack
upon the lady, and command her to
receive him as her husbanc~.
Cainiola, shut up in retirement, is
mourning the absence of Bertoldo.
Among the dependents of her house-
hold, is a well born gentleman of' the
name of Adorni, whO though he does
not wear her livery, yet acknowledges
a duty to her: him Fulgentio orders
on his ai'rival at Camiola's house, to
command the lady's presence. Ador-
ni, indignant at this haughty tone,
refuses, telling him he must wait her
leisure. Fulgentio, with his natural
ari-ogance, and also presuming on the
King's favor, draws his sword upon
Adorni to compel his obedience;
Adorni resists him, and the noise
mtde in the scuffle calls Camiola
from her retirement. She orders
them to refrain, and tells Fulgentio
that, although his glittering outside
might lead her to expect a 'gentlenian,
the rudeness of his carriage a'id
demeanor speaks him a coarser thing

all other persons to do so. This news
makes her mutter treason in her
heart, and exclaim against those
impious times, when not only the
subordinates of justice are corrupted,
but kings themselves forsake their
honor. A world of thoughts press
- on her, how, consistently with her
honor, she cail redeem Bertoldo from
his misery. She seeks for a friend to
assist her, and fixes upon Adorni; for
* they who at a reverent distance love,
are ever faithful. She sends her
waiting woman for Adorni; and
when she has brought him, she bids
her leave' the room, for wise men
might think that in a secret of such
weight even one woman were too
much. And then she proceeds to
unfQld her plans to Adorni. She
adjures him, by the love he owes her
-love born of duty, no farther,-
that he will undertake a service for
her, in which his faith, his judgment,
his discretion, all that is good in him,
must be engaged; nor must he study
anything in the execution but the
ends~ she aims at. And having
received his promise, she proceeds
with vehemence to explain her will.
"You have heard of Bertoldo's
captivity, and the king's neglect; the
greatness of his ransom-fifty thou-
sand crowns-two parts of my estate.
Yet I so love him, to you I will con-
fess my weakness, that now, when he
is forsaken by all others, I purpose to
ransom him, and receive him as my

faithfully to fulfil her commands,
although they destroy all his own

where we find the Duchess Aurelia in
possession of the town; the' Duke of
Urbin a prisoner, and Bertoldo in a
dungeon. Adorni having paid the
required ransom, seeks Bertoldo in
his prison to set him~ free; he finds
him ptostr~te on the ground, almost
senseless with despair; he causes his
irons to be struck off; and watches
with anxiety his awakening from his
stupor: and when fully rouses, in.~
forms him he owes his deliverande to
Camiola, TEE MAW or IIo~o~t. Ber-
toldo pours out his gratitude to herr
anxiou~Iy demanding what service he
can render in return. And Adorni,
faithful to his trust, informs him all
she desires in return for his freedom
is, that he binds himself by a solemn
compact to marry her. Bertoldo,
enraptured, declares this was' the
highest object of his ambition, and
wishes all were prepared to' join their
hands with the same speed 'as his
heart leaps to her. When told that
he must swear to do this,-

Thus having got rid of one of her

Adorni comes-and comes alone.

Doubts seem to be springing up in

a~There is he? with whom ?"
"At the palace, with the Duchess of
Sienna; he's very gracious with her:
you may conceive the rest."
All her anticipated joy is ended;
she bids Adorni tell the tale; who
relates all that has happened ;the
oaths Bertoldo had sworn, the break-
ing of those oaths, and his contract
with the 1)~ohess of Sienna, which is

speedily to be s~uictit1ed with mar-
riage.
"Didst thou not grieve, Adorni,
when you saw this, as I do now to
hear it I"
But Adorni thought he had little
reason to grieve, ' as Bertoldo's fall
t~rom goodness might raise her opin-
ion of his owi~ faith and truth. lint
GambIa rebukes him for this feeling.
"Here speaks the evil of your
disposition9 As a man you should
lament it, and not glory in it as flat-
tering your false hopes. When good
men pursue the path marked-out by
virtue, the. blessed saints look on with
joy; fiends and men made up of
envy, with mourning. Whereas, if
their divinity could partake of pas-
sion, with me would they weep to
behold the fair temple of Bertoldo's
honor destroyed by his inconstancy;
fiends only could rejoice. It is not
well in you, Adorni."
Adorni, in surprise at the rare tem-
per manifested by her, says,~-
"Can you pity him who showed

"His example," she replies, "should
