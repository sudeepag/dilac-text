CHAPTER IV.
STORY OF THE HAUNTED~ CASTLE.
AUNT PHEBE continued her story:
"Bad men fear haunted places. I knew there was a
Castle 'near the coast that was believed to have 'ghostly
visitors; and many were the stories of unearthly revel-
lings through the halls of that spacious old building.
Tli~ leg~iid of the Castle ran thus:
"A great many years ago, an immensely rich miser
lived there, who had a daughter of great beauty; her
ha~nd s sought 'by wealthy and distinguished suitors,
all o hom she turned aw~y without the coveted prise.
She loved only one, and that was a Page in the house.
He could play the harp and sing with more melody than
the lovely maiden had ever heard before. The old man
never suspicioned what was going on, until an occur-
rence took place in the house Which brought the whole
matter to light. The young lady was affianced to a
young nobleman by 'the 'positive commandd of her father.
The engagement had been made and arranged by the
parents of the 'couple.
"One evening this young nobleman: was in the' parIo~
with his affianced. The Page was present. He seemed
to be arranging the sheets of music for his' young mis~
tress, and really paying little attention to what was
going on Lu the room. The young lady excused herself

and withdrew for a moment, and the nobleman walked
to a table, upon which was a decanter of wine. Pouring
out a goblet full he turned to the Page and said, as he
drank:
"'Here is to your beautiful mistress and my affianc&amp;t'
"The Page walked boldly up to the the table, with a
hai(ghty expression of contempt depicted' upon his face,
and filling a goblet, said:
"'May the young lady bye me with the intensity of
feeling that she detests you, and may her devotion to
me be as constant as her disgust is for the man who
seeks to obtain his object by parental coercion, and not
by any merit possessed by himself.'
"The keen black eye of the Page evinced the anger
he felt, as he drank the wine.
"'What! ~jou dare insult me? villain, servant!'
"At this moment the Page felled the nobh~ an to
the floor with~ his fist; and he lay there sense~ ~' for
some time. The proprietor of the house, hearing the
noise in the parlor, rushed in to ascertain the cause.
"There stood the Page, cool and resolute, and his
antagonist stretched out on the carpet.
"'What does this mean? inquired the old man, evinc-
ing great excitement.
"'It means that I have knocked that man, you see
lying there, down.'
"'And for what cause?'
"'Because he would impose on the weak.'
"'Upon whom do you mean?'
"'Your daughter, 8ir!'
"'How?'

claimed the old man, swelling with rage.
~ ~Itfove I~er myself,' replied the Page, sternly.
"~ Begone from here, instantly !~ replied the 01(1 man;
and ~thexi he commenced the most horrid strain of blas-
phemy.                            /
"'I can do so,' replied the Page; 'and I shall go
with the consciousness of heing a better friend to your
daughter than you are yourself!'
"the young, handsome Page retired down the long
corridor with as much dignity as ever a cavalier trod a
bari~quet hall. As he passed out, he met his lady love-
"'M~et me in the garden,' he whispered, and passed
on.
tly they were together in the garden. has-
tily ., Page related what had occurred, and that he
was now under command to depart. They renewed
their vows and parted.
"Tim.e swept on.
"The old Castle, a year after, was filled with a gay
brilliant throng, met to join a wedding celebration~ The
young nobleman, Don Leon, was to wed the beautiful
(laughter of the proprietor of the Castle. The- bride
was adorned in the costliest silk~ and satinss, and da~-
zling jewels. But this was to her an empty pageantry.
The maiden felt that she had rather be dressed in ~
burial clothes. The liveliest strains of music were dis~
coursed; but it was not, to one ~heart, worth anything
compared to the tender notes of a harp she had heard

in other days,' 0!'. how this pure heart reoolled'~at this
empty, heartless festival-as from a crueVmai'tyrdom!
"Thou father! sell honor-.-.rcputation----all-..-.but seal
not your fate with the deeper damnation of selling' th.
matchless wealth of your daughter's heart--c6ndemu~
ing her to the companionship of a' man she does not and
cannot love!
"'But I will not be a victim,' muttered the maiden.
'No, let me sleep in the garderi-sweetly sleep-beneath
the bending willows, away from the din and treachery
of this world; and perchance he may come at evening
and weep over my narrow bed!'
"There was gt'e'at confusion in the 'Castle. One of
the bride's-maids entered her chamber and' found th&amp;
maiden lying upon a couch. She thought the bride was
asleep, and caught hold of her hand to awaken her. It
was icy cold! She shook her, and asked,
"'What! asleep qt the bridal hour!' but tli air
sleeper moved not. S~he was dead!
"A scream startled the crowd beloW, in the hall, and
they rushed into the bride's apartment.
"In the midst of the alarm and c~nfusiou of this scene,
a tall handsome man entered and'forced his way through
the crowd to the dead body, and frantically gathered' it
in his arms.
"In the maiden's hand was a pale, beautiful rose-bud,
and a small miniature.
"Don Leon stood aghast for a moment, andsudidenly
exclaimed:
"'The Page! The Page!!'
"' ha! ha!' answered the frantic stranger; 'Ha! ha!'
and his voice grew husky; 'yes, the Page!'

* "Siiiiultaueously every one recoiled back, as if ter-
rifled by this fearful tragedy. The lovers were facing
each other.
~ "The sharp report of a pistol, followed by a stream
of blood from Don Leon's breast, sent a thrill of ter-
ror through the crowd of spectators. The father fell
down upon the floor and cried wildly:
"'Retribution! Retribution!'~
"Don Leon staggered back, fell and expired.
"'Ha! ha! they thought to rob me of my lady love.
I see her now!' His eyes was fixed wildly upon the
ceiling. 'I a coming, Adelaide!' and, as he spoke,
he stabbed himself, and fell, clinging to the cherished
~' hziage."
"How strange !" exclaimed Madeline; "but, pray,
what has this to do with &amp;Iour narrative?"
ill tell you. It was to this old Castle we fled
afte e occurrence of what I told you last evening.
As 1~said, it was reputed to be haunted; and, for this
reason, it was ~seldom frequented. The house stiTi re-
tained its furniture-the carpets, table, beds, pictures-
although they looked old and dusty enough. As we
arrived at the Castle, the clouds were just breaking up
-floating about in the blue sea above, lik~ so many dark
images from the Infernal Pit. Anon, the moon showed
her mild face, as she was permitted by the passing
clouds. The scene was one I shall never forget. My
own peculiar feelings-the awful thought that I was,
probably, a murderess-before me spread out the token
of a great Presiding Genius of worlds-made an im-
pression upon my mind never to be effaced.,
"But I must hurry on with my story.

"I s~nt my carriage and Mr. Carson back to my resi~
dence, while I and my faithful servant, old Juan, re- *
gained at the Castle. The arrangement was, that Mr.
Carson should secrete himself in a subterranean vault
under the mansion. They were to return the n'~&amp;~t
night.
"The carriage rolled away, and left me standing on
the huge marble steps. How I felt my heart sink with-
in me, as I saw it disappear. There I stood for some
moments' hardly knowing which way to move. Fortu-
nately, we had brought with us a lamp and some match-
es. I at length walked up the steps into the great high
passage, and felt a chill of horror run through me as I
entered and heard my foot-steps echo through the great~
building.
"We wandered about through the different apartments
to find the~ best quarters for the night; and I zed cu-
riously at the~many mildewed objects I saw. n the
walls hung old and unique pictures. Scattered~ ere and
there was fine furniture. But, at length, we fonr~d our
quarters on the second floor. I threw myself uprni an
old couch, overcome with the excitement of the night's
adventure.
"But I will reserve my story of A Night in 'the C~s-

aro~s~d~by a noise in the passage below. My servant
had h1ow~i out the lamp, and was snoring away on the
flo~, ~Th~ noise sounded like the dragging of a chain
up and down the long passage, accompanied by a groan
ind4~gre~t distress. I was terrified. Presently I
heard a wild, though very musical voice, in low,. sooth~
ing strains, in which the accompaniment of ~ guitar~
mingled-all the while the chain noise was kept up.
This was continued a great while, until I, at lengthfell
asleep, although I ~truggk~d to overcome the drowsiness
that came over me.
"Again I awoke, and that was my terror to ~beh,~14
a young woman, scarcely older than myself, seated by

my side, with a candle in her hand, looking intently in
my face! At first her eyes gleamed fiercely upon me, and
then seemed to inch into tenderness.
"'Who are you?' I asked.
"'The Prophetess of Fire,' ivan the reply.
"'And what has your prophecies to do with fire?'
"'It obeys me.'                            /
"'How shall I know this?'

me. II felt that I was now doomed. The monster's
eyes flashed wildly upon me, and laid roughly hold of
my shoulder. I trembled with fright. I knew the de-
mon would be deaf to my supplications, as I saw that
madness, instead of reason, had possession of him.
"'I will brhig my coffin,' said the womar~.
"'Goffin P thought I! 'am I to be buried alive, or
murdered?'
"Here came the woman with the coffin upon her back.
Deliberately, she put it down upon the floor, and took
the sor~ws out of 'the lid and laid it aside. Inside of
the cofflh was some linen, nicely folded, and as white as
riven~ snow. it was to be my winding sh~at! It was
soon around ~and then they laid me down in the cof-
fin--here they stopped for funeral services; and began
to ehaunt a most solemn dirge, which the woman accom-
panied ~with her guitar. This concluded, they knelt
down d the man began a most fervent prayer. I was
pr~afrd for as one who had died a natural death. This was
noVel, certainly, the hearing of one's own funeral! I
imagined that I could almost hear the clods rumbling
on ?my coffin.
"The vicissitudes of an hour! Who can tell? It is
often the work of one short hour to unhinge enterpris-
es, overthrow governments, and inaugurate new systems.
Human destiny turns upon the small pivot of an instant.
A Louis Phillipe of one hour, with the insignia of Roy-
ality; may in the next be a trembling fugitive, fleeing
from an angry populace; and a Napoleon springs to the
throne from obscurity, and for~ the rough chair, has a
splendid ~hroie-~-for dusty garret rooms, has the splen-
did chambers of a palace! I seemed the creature of

quickly varying circumstances, whirled from one event
to another.
"As this service was going on, I arose softly from~ the
coffin, and got out without making any noise, and slip-
ped to my servant and shook him. lie sprang up and
gazed, aifrighted, at the scene~before him.
"'Courage! courage!' I exclaimed; 'out with the
fiends.'
"In a moment he grappled the man by his long hair
and hurledhim, headlong, out into the passage. Quick-
ly after him followed the woman, while I closed the
door.
"And they \vere ghosts !" interrupted Madeline.
"No; I afterwards learned that t14 woman; who had
so grievously tormented me, was a maniac, and that the
man, a poor* lunatic, was laboring under the delusion
that he was her attendant. I know not wha 2 becomes
of the spirits of the dead; yet I feel that i They do
linger for awhile about this earth, they are invisible to
human ken-that, in a state of spiritual essence, they
can no longer be viewed by mortals. As soon expect
to see the light-winged zephyr-or the strong winds.
When w~ have our spiritual sight, we may beh4d what-
ever is spiritual-aye, God, the Great Universal Spirit
of the Universe, whose life we feel in every bouiiding

above the rest-a beautiful marble shaft. , I walked
thither; it stood over two graves; and on that pure,
white Italian marble was the inscriptionn: 'The LQvers

a tear over the last resting place of those faithful by-

"AND did old Juan get any satisfaction fror~ the
maniac ?" asked Madeline.
"No; when asked for her story, she raived, tore her
hair, and' wept bitterly. I looked curiously at her-.
viewed her narrowly-for in that wild, frantic eye-in
that haggard face, I thought I could discoverer features
that I had seen before.
"'What is your name?' I asked.
"'My name! it was Carrie Dudley; but that sweet,
pure name has been swept away.'

A. OLOoMY, cold evening in th. last days of January,
the prairie was covered with deep snow, which was en-
oru5tedIwith thin ice. The clouds hung heavy and som-
lire, and indicated a bitter, stormy night.
White Fawn, an Indian girl, (so-called, on account of
her ~'clearwhite skin, and her graceful form,) set out
upon a fleet, wild Indian pony across the prairie, in a
full :gallop, just as trio broad, red rim of the sun tipped
the Western plain of snow, and seemed to be sinking
into a sea of molten gold. She rode on, facing the rude,
chilling blast, as if upon some mission of 'great impor-
tance. In her countenance was a sternness, a heroinism,
which evinced a degree of prowess of which your fash-
ionable, belles would never think of possessing.
White Fawn was the daughter of an Indian chief.
She 4was just blooming into woman-hood--au intelligent~
beautiful gix'l. You ~uId hardly believe that ske was
an Indian. True, her cheeks were slightly bronzed-
and very alightly-but her forehead and chin was. per-
feet~fair; her face possessed a peculiar attraction; the
o~ix~toii~ was ~bold and well ;marked; her eyes fl~st~ drew

spoke Ua.dlola, with great confusion.
"C~rtainly! why not?"
"I w~s thinkii~g of another affair," was the reply-
and the Indian chief grew stern again; and White Fawn
retired musing upon the strange questiQn-
"Am Iyour father?"
It was only a few days after the events above narrated
that~ we have seen White Fawn crossing the prairie-
uu~lauuted by the fierce blast, or the dangers of the Wil-
deruess.
Night ~axue, and this Indian girl-the fearless child of
th.e ~or~st.~dashed on her way, greeted uiow a~id then by
the~hoWl of a ~olf, or~the screa#i of a panther. ~ The
sn~w began to fafl faster an4 faster~ until, it became ~

WhiWFawn, benumbed with ~eold, was wrapped in warm
blankets, and stimulated freely with wine, which ~&amp;~n
rester~ed her to comfortable~ feeling.
An explanation ensued. White Fawn had received
information that Hawk and a few of hiss warriors intend-
ed to surprise the party that night, and kill them. ~he
knew fro~n the time they ~tarte&amp; from a certain point,
that she could reach the camp, upon her fleet pony, ~n
time to prevent this wanton, cold~blooded murder-and
for ~he life~ of her lover, she felt that she could sui'mount

CHAPTER IX.
STORY OF THE LOST CHILT~.
"Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,
Accurs'd, and in a cursed hour he lies."
2dilt0~&amp;'# P0rv4is~ .1~ot.
LET us relate the story of the captive and Lover of
White Fawn:
lie is Percy Carson-the lost, child. Wandering
down to the beach on a beautiful ~pring morning, to
view the many objects of attraction to be seen along the
"sounding shore," he met with a man who seemed to be
selecting shells.
"What is your name ?" asked the stranger.
"Percy Carson, sir," replied the lad, raising ,hi~
bright eyes to the questioner's face.
The man started back as if an,~ apparition was before
him, and then recovering his self-possesion from '~he
shook, assumed an air of perfect indifference. Like
Lucifer, in the shape of i~ toad, to whisper in the ear of
Eve while sIi~ reposed beneath the fragrant bower in the
Garden-while the silver 8tars glittered above Par~adise
and trembled uponthe four rivers, and the iingel wateh~
ers winged through the mystic light-.-this man had as-
sumed a shape, a countenance, not his own, and to be-
guile, like a lurking demon, an innocent child.
"Come, my boy,~' he said in a tone of great kindness
"come help me select some pretty shells, and let me

see~what ~sort of taste you possess. Let us walk down
the beach, where there may be a greater variety."
The thoughtless boy, drawn by the feigned kindness
~iX the stranger, walked away with him.
Ah !~ ho~ little he dreams he is walking into a snare!
This is a faithful pi 4re~.4~tie ~t&amp; Life.-of how we are
all ~drawn into the meshes of the Evil One by the man

~ ~Thia~m~n is~Don Montie. The inferual spirit of re-

the m~in "who had hiedwelling among the tombs" inthe
d~iya o% Ohi'ist. i~t has been his accursed it~centive over

Percy was carried, byJ)on i~ontie,4o a~ hoteV in the
city,' and locked up in the room that ha4'beea assigned
to this bad man. During the day, Don Meutie att.appt~
ed to pacify the distressed boy by telling hii~ikf fthe
many things lie would give him, and of' the amusen~nts
in Ua~var~a.
~ Ihit, please, sir, let me go to mother?"
'~ a~h!" said Don Montie ;~and be stamp~4 ~bie foot
with J~age; "I will have no more of it!"
Night came, and little Peroy cried. himself to ~1eep..
The 'next morning t1~ey took a. st4amer for' Havana,
a~ud in due course of time, landed there.
~?or 4ays and weeks Percy 'wept' as if his heart w~tdd
break; but by degrees the poignancy of~ bis grief pass-
ed~ away. He was permitted to go at large, a~d~ was
alI~wed freeegress and ingress at the splendid villa of
Don Mou~ie, which, in costliness, arrangement sand
maguificence, had few equals on the Island.

deep veins of the world; singing. and flashing in. the

and swelling in the grand old ocean; or glittering in
the~18u~Ilight in descending water-drops; or spanning
Heaven's bright arch in the gorgeous iris, reminding
us of Heav~n's beauty and ~God's covenant.
Don~oiitie's object in letting him go at liberty was
that his morals might become vitiated. If he couldkac~
oomplish this, and bind the noble-spirited boy with dark
chains~ of. dissipation, and then send him back to his
dating rnother-a captive of the Evil One~-~to 'crush
her heart, it would give him some gratification. The

how sad it is to see such beating along the dusty path-
way: of life, all lonely and dreary-feeling the heart
yearn for the music of a soft word and the joy of a
kindly glance!
The pleasure of this moment nearly repaid our little
hero for days nd nights of tears and heart-throbs
Mr. Shelley took Percy into an adjoining apartment,
and said, as he came to a covered statue: "This, Percy"
-and he i~emoved the veil as he spoke-" this is a bust
of my wife and your aunt !"
The piece of sculpture was exceedingly beautiful, and
looked like a thing of life-of beating pulse and breath-
ing vitality.
They stood for minutes and looked upon the cold mar-
ble face-at an image that seemed to transcend earthly
loveliness, and the admirers were mute and motionless
as statues themselves.
"This is the image of my heart," said Mr. Shelley,
breaking the profound and s6lemn silence. "It is my
good, my blessed angel; that ever hovers around me,
whether in the dreams of the still night, when she comes
and whispers peace to my troubled spirit, or wending my
way along the bustling highway of life-whether brood-
ding over ills and misfortunes, or standing before an ap-
plauding theatrical audiQnce-whether praised or scan-
dalized she is ever with me, exercising a spiritual control
over my thoughts and actions~"
We will exp1aii~.
Mr. Shelley married Aurelia Carson about two years
after her brother's flight with Phebe Laniz. The fate
of these two fugitive lovers, was, to her, wrapped in
mystery-a mystery that was not dissolved to the day

'MA D E LUNE.

of 'her death. The events which followed their flight
were the direct cause of her acquaintance with Mr. 'Shel-
ley, and led, 'two years after, to a most felicitous mar-
riage. The circumstances were briefly as follows:
Aurelia's estate and her brother's were in a state of
amalgation. When Don Montie came with the officials
to Seize the goods of Mr. Carson for confiscation, Au-
relia protested against the appropriation of her 'own es-
tate for the so-called offence of her brother.
The officers gruffly pushed her aside and tauntingly
insinuated that she herself was,, in all probability~ privy
to the crime for which her brother had fled, unwhipped
of justice, and that a little impertinence might invoke
an investigation.
Rising proudly, and her eyes flashing with the spirit
of true independence, she hurled the false insinuation
back in the following words, that evinced a republican
heart that could not yield to the gascoriade and over-
bearing tyrants. An Americam imbued with the great
principles of this glorious land of freedom, can never
be overawed by tyranny. The words of Crittenden,*
who fell nobly by ignoble hands, illustrate this fact.
She said-
"It is 'false that my brother fled for the commission
of a crime. It is meanly false that I have had any coin-
plicity in a conspiracy against the government of this
Island. We were both, however, boWl too free, upon
the soil of America, not to despise, upon the one hand,
the grinding tyranny of the government, and, upon the
other hand, the cowardly submission and servility Qf a
large ~portioi~ of the population; and 'had I power corn-

This rebuke, severely administered, was fokl~we&amp; by
demonstrations of applause; but Don Moutiew~s re-
garded by many as a fearless Mid desperate man, and it
*was believed that Percy would rue this language.
"I can show that this man is a knave and a1 coward-
that the mask has only to be torn from him, to disgust
alt honorable men. He is indebted to his own insolence
and breach of good breeding for this truthful exposure,"
spoke Percy, rising proudly and defiantly.
"I challenge you, sir; choose the time, place, weap-
ons and your seconds," spoke Don Montie, attempting
a false show of courage, while inwardly he quaked with
fear.
Percy replied, first addressing the audience and then
his antagonist-

~)on Montie still paced his ph ber.
~I~rtip~p! ~ tramp 1. 5~tilJ sounde4, mo~iotonously
through the huge building; butt the outward ~storin had
passed, ~and the light of the moon glowed ~brightly from
pendant water-drops and spreads silvery gauge ~overjake
a~id forest,:and turret, a0d tQwer! and peace reigned in
8~'lyan bowers and in the walks of the city; where noise
and bustle were supreme a few hours before.
N&amp;ture was as: calm as a sleeping infant-a holy, sub-
lime stillness prevailing, inviting the way~woru chiWren of
the earth to repose.
But there was no quiet for the troubled spirit of Don
Montie-the unrest of a guilty conscience he must cnn-
tmue to possess.
As well attempt to flee from one's own shadow, as to
endeavor to hide from a sense of guilt.
Don Montie was walking the floor, when a light rap
on the door knob aroused him, and he asked hastily:
"Who's there?"
"A friend," returned a soft and gentle voice, "please
let me in."
The door was opened. In stepped the strange woman
who so unceremoniously leaped up behind Don M~ontie
at the pld cathedral, and rode home with him. She was
dropped in a piece of clean, white linen, which served
as a sort of gown. or wrapper.
Don Montie ~t~ggered back and asked:
"What do you Want?"
"I will," said the woman, approaching &amp; step ~r 'two,
and 'drti~wing herself up sternly, "I will that you shall

MID~I~Pr~.                  83
go ~ and it aliall tsty6~idei1i.l~. Or-
der your horse--and I will ride behind."
As tfie ~bo~ ~rei~iark~ were tittered; ~ b~it 6f~eapons
was~&amp;~eie~sly~ bxp&amp;s~d.
"C6riscien~e makes cowards of us all!" In his own
house, surrdii~ded by a crowd of servants, Don M6i~iie
suc6i~ibs to a fe~iiale. He~ is afraid to disobey. 1'he
ghostLy ~ftguieis a perfect terror to him. He straight-
way commanded the ostler to bring forth hi~ horse.
DoiiMontie mounted hi~ horse, and the woman sprang
up b~hihd.
Firmly seated, the woman slapped the horse with a11
her might-.--.using her open palm-and exclaimed:
"NoW go!"
She held the reins in her own hands and guided the
horse.
On and on they dashed, not a word was spoken, ~x-
cept the frequent exclamation-.-
"Faster! faster~
Turning from the main road, they plunged into the
forest, and finally halted in a thicket of undergrowth.
They dismounted, and altering the horse securely to
a tree, the woman said:
"Ooixie; go with me."
Taking Don Montie by the hand, she led him along,
sibrhis~i9~iy, as the culprit goes to the gibbet. Pres-
ently they came in front of a vaulted cave. ?ei~ha~s
nature had done a p&amp;rt of the work, but art h~d evi-
dently given its present shape and .dimen~ions. Run-
ning into a bhtfl' ~t tht4 foot of 'a hill~w~ a l~ge ~irault,

iron door ~h~sed the entrance~ and it was fastened by a
secret spring.
A~great while ago---perhaps more than a !entury-
thta subterranean vault was to a wealthy Spanish family
what t1V.~aepelah was to father Abraham and his descen.
dants, a family burial place. The wom~n touched the
hidden magic spring, and the door turned upon its
things slowly, and with a heavy grating noise, the dark
va7ult dungeon was opened before theme
Don Montie was commanded to enter, which he did
reluctantly, and the woman followed after him,, closing
~he door and lighting a small lantern which she had
brought with her. After walking some ten paces, they
entered a square apartment, which was the end of the
vault.
The view was at once awful-they were in a charnel
house-a~ Golgotha. Human bones lay profusely about,
while in the centre there was a heap of bones some two
or three feet high.
"Now, sir," spoke the woman, as they came to the
vault, "I have brought you hither to show you the place
where yqur bones will soon be piled. No grave yard
shall be your resting place, but here your body shall
remain until the day of final accounts. Do you know
me?"
Don Montie shook his head solemnly in reply to the
interrogation.
"Ah! you feign forgetfulness of one whom you in-
jur~dvietimi~pd-~-robbe.d of her chastity," continued
tY1e woman, ~ ~h~er9 WS~ a: f~a4ul ~h~sis ii~ h~er~ex-

"Swear thyself a villain!"
"I8Wear!"
"You have only lived," said the woman, looking
down angrily., at the form kneeling at her feet;~ '~you
have only lived to persecute-to blast the happiness of
others~-to lurk about and accomplish inischief~-to 'war
upon women and children! You are a forger-a mu~-
derer-and-and-"
The woman paused for a moment, and laughed fran~
tically, and then continued-
"A 8edu~er! You turned me loose upon the world,
covered 4with shame and scorn and misery; blasted-..---
robbed of hope-debarred from virtuous society-with
no claim for sympathy, while you mingled in the festive
throng, and was admitted in society-and all the while
you laughed at the credulity of woman. You shall now
realize that a woman,, weak though she may be, is yet
strong enough and capable of avenging herself. In this
place you must remain until I have done what I will
with you. Arise, and take your seat upon that pile of
bones."               £
Don Montie obeyed, and the woman disappeared.
There he sat upon that heap of human bones, shut up
in a dark vault, with no hope of delivery from the
hands of one whom he had deeply wronged years ago-
whose life he had made miserable and valueless.
Than rob a woman of her chaste reputation-which is
a jewel beyond value-'twere better to take away her
life.
For a long time Don Montie sat reflecting upon his
career through life. And as death inevitabiy'~tood 1e-
fore him, the mind naturally turned to Eternity!


M&amp;DELINR.
~Eternity! The word seemed to f~Jl free4ngly upon
the heart; and the life-current flowed coldly through
vein and artery. Awful thought 1 to the man stp~n4ing
up~n~ .tjte crumbling brink of hfe and can almost feel the
dark c~irre~s of that boundless ocea~n. cutting awq the
sand beneath his feet, with not one ray of h~peto ~heer
the heart for the voyage upon which it must soon enter!
Ite thought first of kneeling and imploring the mercy
of the Great Judge; but the thought of the great ex-
tent of his guilt, made him feel unworthy to raise his
prayerful eyes towards heaven. Musing for a great
while, sleep came, as a ministering spirit to the "v&amp;ult-
prisoned" sufferer-but there was no repose fQr~ the
troubled spirit,
A corpse stood before him, with long fingers-a skel-
eton face, and deep sunken eyes. It was Mrs. Shelley.
The apparition said, waving her right arm in a solemn
gesture, and the bones rattled in the joints.
"Man! you sent me to the lonely grave, away from
the man Iloved!"
The dreamer sprang up-the vision had fled-the
vault was dark, and the bones beneath him all seemed to
stir and send forth a grating sound that made Don
Montie's hair rise and his flesh shiver.
He sat for a great while, afraid to go to sleep, yet
desiring relief or escape from his own thoughts. In
spite of resistance, sleep overcame his exhausted nature,
and he fell into a slumber. An angel of tho Infernal
Pit, poised upon great outspread pinions, having feet
and~hands with great ~sharp claws, and fierce burning
eye-ball; hovered over him. After a while th~ demo-
niacal spirit said-

MAI~BLINE.                 8't

"We will be companions; when man is deserted both
~y his fellow and heaven, we always embrace him in the
~ rms of our never failing sympathy." /
This time Don Montie sprang to his feet, and his tor-
entor.'-4he woman who had brought him into the vault
was standing by his side with a lighted candle in her
hand.
"Oh! wretched life!" he exclaimed, and ho seized
the candle and rushed towards the passage that led to
the iron door.
In a moment the woman wheeled upon him with. a
pistol in her haud-.-.flred !---.and Don Montie leaped into
the air, yelled and expired!

Upon a gathered lily almost withered.

"0! hush, Aunt!" said the sick girl to the kind old
lady who leaned upon the bed, and as she spoke she
covered~ her eyes and wept. "I know this is foolish
and childish," continued the girl; "but I can't help it.
If you knew all, then you might excuse a part of my
weakness; but here are cold words that chill my heart."
She read the letter, which ran as follows:
"November, 18-.
Miss MADELINE LINDSEY: I do not wish to hold you
to a disagreeable engagement-and to say the truth,
your letters express so little of affection for me that I
already feel my own ardor abating. 'Let our engage-

Douglas hardy have been engaged over tw4VemoJith8.
He has been in the North-west, 'with his friends, nearly
two years.
"Well, to my mind, this is singular," began Aunt
Phebe, after thoughtfully considering the letter she had
just heard read, for a short time. "You have often
represented him to me as a brave, sincere man. Now;
if this be true, and you have been at no fault in the
premises, I cannot conceive what could have led to this,
result."
"I never realized before how fondly-how profoundly
I love him! but it' is all' over now!" remarked the in-
valid mournfully.
"Let us' hope for the best,' replied Aunt Phebe;
"this is, perhaps, only one of those little quarrels that
most kvers have, and may not last long.' When 'yo~u
get calm and feel well enough, you must sit down and
write to him, in a moderate and dignified tone."
"I think' I' could do that now,", replied Madeline, if
you will have the kindness to supply me with the mate-
rial for' writing,' and raise me up in the bed."
Aunt Phebe furnished the necessary material-raised
her young friend in the bed to a sitting posture, and
propped her with'pillows.
Madeline began her letter. It ran thus:
"December, 18-.

The letter was sealed and dispatched to the office~
"~Wi1l flerbert Leslie come this evening?" enquired
Aunt Phebe.
#'i~e appointedd to come this evening," answered
M~delii~e, ~"and to read for me some fugitive poems that

tu     she whispers from the dark blue pavilion of
night, or gleams forth in the resplendent glory of her
stars--" peace on earth and good will to man "-all of
these are attributes of poetry. Nothing so touwhingly
attests the divine image in man as the ability to create
those wonderful images that are everywhere to be found
in true poetry.
"I do hope Herbert will come and read for me this
evening."
herbert Leslie was a young gentleman of excellent
schol~mhip; rand possessed some attractive qualities;
bu4~ he ~was' one of those secretive characters th~t you

can never understp~nd. ,There was a. reseh~e, ~
ness, about him, and at times he was exeeedi~igly ~gIoomy
and taciturn-and even repulsive, except to these to
whom he wished to appear agreeable.. He had enpu~h
poliC-44ypQ~riSy-&amp;b9ut hi~ to appear a~iakle An~l
cheerful, frequently. when his feelings wore tke i~everse.
"Ih~te the necessity of this dissimulation," remarked
Herbert Leslie to a friend. "I~ut, then, you know,
Tom, we must sometimes appear to be what we really
are not, or else make ourselves obnoxious in the eyes of
the world. I would be detested and shunned in. less
time than one fortnight, if I should present myself to
the world as I am; for, to tell you the truth, I have no
sympathies, in common, with the mixed multitude of
society. If I should doff the false show of enjoyment
-cease the smiles that are mockeries, my prospects of
"a good time coming" would go to nothing. I intend to
succeed in my plan, and I know that the world is ~very
practical income things, and thus I am induced ~o~nake
a heavy sacrifice of feeling to appear affable and £, y
to every one, when, in truth, I am a perfect ma*1ut~e P
There was very little of "the milk of human kind-
ness~' in Herbert Leslie's bosom. It is plain to be seen
from his own words as recorded above, that there was a
bitterness in his nature towards almost every~ one. He
is a narrow, selfish, ovei~bearing man. But' we shall get
further index to this mai~i's character by the colloquy
which followed:
"I say, Herbert!" said Leslie's friend, Tom Martin
-"if J~ ~nay change .thesu~bjoe~ of eo~versstjo~, JJe~l

p~h respQnded. Herbert with a half'-eon-
t~t~1ou8v~ntraction ~f his eye4ids, and' drawing his
fa~e full ~ wrinkles. "This 'is punctilious indeed!
are getting over-sensitive. IL imagine you' have
boon leading a ~Sabbath School tract, or some other
pi9us nonsense, and you are now ready to march up to
th~ 'CQnfessional.' All things in courtship, as well as
in war, are held to be fair-and nothing can be any
fairer than the plan that bears off the fair prize. The
whole business every body understands to be a system
of systematic deception."
"No, Herbert Leslie! there is no deception in Made-
line Lindsey. If you could win her by this sort of
fraud, it would be base and cruel.. Your weapons, cun~
ning 'and address, are legitimate only in a contest with
those 'who recognize them as honorable."

an , jok~ has gone far enough for all practical pur-
poses. ~y~hat time I will have established my claims
as a good husband, an&amp; we will laugh it all over as a
clever bit of pleasantry. It will no doubt divert her,
that ~Qu' could so successfully counterfeit Douglas Har-
dy's handwriting."
"By thunder! Herbert never mention my name in
connection with this disgraceful affair. No, let the
curse $~ Douglas Hardy 'and Madeline Lindsey fall
upon the head~ of the one who persists i4~ this 'diabolical
sol~e~,'~ a~d iutei~ds to make permanent the results,"
replied 'Tom Martin, with warmth. He' continued: "I

self unworthy of life and des~tving th&amp; seem ~of 'man-
kind, if I should be a party to victimizing a pure, un-
suspecting female. The restitution you sugg~st~ will
only be adding insolence to an iix'emediable ir4~ury.
Thesekare plain word.~, Mr:Leslie, but'they are truthful."
"What do you mean, old fellow?" enquired Herbert,
affecting a composure he did not feel. He addressed
Tom Martin in a conciliatory and patronizing maimer.
"It means "-was the jpm~ompt and firm response-
"it means that we have both done wrong, and I d~ not
intend to go anf further in it."'
"Well, then, ihis is no killing matter," said Herbert.
"I suppose you will not expose the affair."
"No, if it shall end where it is)" was the reply.
"So far as you are concerned it shall," responded
Herbert.
"And, as far as you are concerned it must,'? ans-
wQred Torn-" or I will out with the whole 'matter."
"Now, I hardly reckon you will make greai to
announce yourself as a forger," retorted Herb , as-
suming a sort of independent, triumphant air. ~' No
one will' thank you, and all will look upon you with
conter.ipt."
At this, the friends parted, with not the pleasanest
feelings from the interview.
Tom Martin was one of those urLsuspe~ting men, that
may be easily lead astray in an unguarded ix~oment; ~but
his heart waS right, and he was always sure to abandon
the error into which he had been inveigled, whenft~re~ he
had 'time for calm reflection. Herbert had le~d him into
the affair, just di~oussed~ a~ a joke, and he exp~edted~ to


'MAD~Lx1tE.
h~ve~.itrefrble with his dixp~, land to be able to ikiake
good use of him; but Tom's better feelings revolted, and
no persuasion could recokidile him.
He~ert Leslie loved Madeline Lindsey, and he had
'faileti upon' the wicked plot of intercepting the letters
that ~*ore passir~g between Madeline and Douglas, and
of' sending others written in their stead, filled with re-
proaches.
We shall witness the results.
"Herbert is coming, Madeline."
~'I am right glad," returnedd Madeline. "Please in-
vite him in this apartment."
The sick girl raised herself up in t~ie bed to a sitting
position, and brushed out the folds from the rich grey
robe, which she wore to receive visitors. It was a mag-
riificent article of dress, sent her by a friend in Eng-
land, intended as a costume for horse-back riding; and
to combine both ease and elegance in the studio. It
was rich enotigh for a royal robe. It was of silk and
s ~ This robe has its associations, to be explained
in th~ conclusion of our story.
Herbert entered the door with a bland smile. There
was something imposing about him whenever he wished
to appear ~well; and this evening he intended to make
his ~best' effort, as he imagined 'that everything was hi a
train to overthrow Douglas Hardy. The only thought
thaI~ interrupted him, was the recollection of the 'inter7
view with Tern Martin.
"Right glad to see you, Mr. Leslie," said Aunt Phebe.
~"Y~;"'j 6in~d Madeline-"you will read some poems
foji ii~thi~ evening."
"Tn~ afraid you only Want the music from the instru-

mont and not the performer," replied Herbert, good
hunioredly.
"0, no! that's a little unkind; we love the music,"
said Madeline, einplQying Herbert's own allegory.; ~ and
we honor the genius of the musician for his §kill~ in
bringing it forth from an instrument that is really pos-
sessed of no more music than a piece of wood or stone,
and we value the man for his genius."
"I am glad of my assault on account of the re-
joinder," said Herbert pleasantly.
"Madeline has not been quite so well this afternoon,
notwithstanding her cheerfulness now," interposed Aunt
Phebe, "and this flow of spirits is encouraging, truly !"
"I understand," observed Herbert. "Not love4ick,
I hope, Miss Maddy? If so, poetry is not the medi-
cine.* It will only increase the fever and aggravate the
malady. We should give you. some sketches of life
matrimonial behind the curtain, from every day obser-
vation. I think you would mend rapidly wnder the
treatment."
"Why, Mr. Leslie, who should I love? and wh~ could
think of loving so homely a girl as I ?" enquired Made-
line.
"Ti~the first question, I answer, Mr. Douglas Hardy;
and to the second, more than will ever find their affec-
tions reciprocated."
Madeline blushed deeply, and she looked so confused
that any one could plainly see that Herbert had named
the man.
"Well, never mind, he may return after awhile, and
then we shall expect the bloom of health to your cheek,"
said Herbert, "and you will be as cheerful 'and happy

again as a bird at the return of Spring. But I prom.
ised to read for you, and must comply."
He read several poems to M.adeline, and when~he had
finished, sh~ looked o~ieerful; she wads absorbed in poetic
dreams, ~and was loath to break the spell, to utter a
word; lest the visions should float away.
"Now, then, Miss Madeline, I am no Doctor, it is
plain," began herbert, after he had concluded the read-
ing, "the poetry acts like a charm."
"Just what it is!" responded Madeline.
Herbert, feeling that he had remained as long as
proprietywou14 allow, retired with mingled feelings of
se~fpride and self-condemnation. He was proud .to
witness the telling effect of his person and manners on
the inmates of Woodland. He felt condemned when
he reflected how meanly he had acted in the letter busi-
ness, but he was not disposed to discontinue his plans.
The following conversation at Woodland will show
how well Herbert had succeeded in insinuating himself
ir~to the esteem of two-thirds of the white family.
"I think Herbert is an excellent young man, and
possessed of rare qualities. He will finally command
the entire respect of our neighbors," said Aunt Phebe.
"I agree with you," spoke Madeline, "there is much*
promise in him of usefulness and honorable position in
community."
Herbert's cunning had been taken for sincerity. He
has succeeded in deceiving Aunt Phebe and Madeline,
and so hid from their view his deformed and forbidding
~haraeter, that a graceless, unscrupulous villian is be-
lieved to be "excellent," "worthy," &amp;c.
There was one of the family, Herbert had not so suc-
4

cessfully hoodwinked. Uncle Ben Carson, who usually
looked deeper than the mere surface of things,~ signifi-
cantly hinted that all is tiot gold that glitters.
"You are suspicious, Undo Ben!" said Madeline to
Mr. Carson. "What leads y~u to question Mr. Leslie's
sincerity? Is there anything objectionable in his de-
portment in society?"
"I see the tinsel," began Uncle Ben. "I am not
blind to the outward show. Every thing is fair-ever
fair. In fact, this leads me to question Leslie's char-
acter. He has been in the vicinity but a short time,
and he is now on terms of familiarity with almost every
,one in the neighborhood. Nothing but outright pre-
sumption, to say the least, can prompt a man to seek
terms of familiarity with a whole community, when he
is conscious that his own past character cannot be
known. A meritorious, modest man, has some pride in
quietly waiting until his character, qualities and worth
are fully known and appreciated. In taking this course,
he shows profound respect for society, and observes ~a
rule necessary to its protection. Every accomplished
villain that happens to be wandering over the country,
if he be as forward as Leslie, will walk in to our parlors
and becAne familiar with our families-unless a short
probation is required upon the part of the community.
Society should seek the man. I have been a close ob-
server, and I ha~ve learned to be suspicious of forward
men."
Madeline felt quite vexed at uncle Ben for the re-
marks quoted.
"For my own part," she replied, "I think Herbert
a brave, generous man; and as to his accomplishments

*and~ fine taknts, there is no one questions them, I be-
licve.
"Well, child," said uncle Ben, kindly, "I shall re-
joice if it turns out that you are correct in your opin*
ion;' and I regret to take a position that may appear
unkind to ~yo~tir friend; but. I feel as if you were my own
daughter, and that I must act the part of a father to-
wards you. I could not, therefore, withhold the views I
have just expressed upon a subject of so much manifest
Importance, and to show you that I am not alone in the
ffosition I have taken, here is a note I received yester-
day. It runs thus:
'Mu. CARSON-DEAR Sin: It is in your power to
do great good, by preventing certain mischievous and
wicked schemes intended to victimize a lady friend of
yours. You do not dream- ~nor does she-of what has
already been accomplished. Leslie is a monster; and
events will proVe it. I only fear that they will come
out too late.
Yours,
Persecution never drives a true-hearted woman from
a man. She is our first, last and best friend. Slander,
scandal and vituperation only makes her cling more fond-
ly to man. Her sympathy "droppeth as the gentle dews
from Heaven" upon the wounded and disconsolate spir-
it, ~nd in her tears gleam 'out the bright stars' of Para-
* dise, mirroring Joy arid Hope-a purity as sublime as
the- gentle breezes of childhood. ' If in her too cozifid-
ing ~nature she lost us Eden, and 'brought 'down the aw-
fur'wrath 'of the Almighty, she annointed th~. head ~of

Sepi4ch~. to behQld the arisen Savior, and proclaim the
glad tidings that the Lion of the Tribe of Judea, had
triumphed over the monster, Death.
When Madeline read the note, she quickly replied-.
"There ~8 r~o signature attached, and J suppose no
one. responsible. Herbert must fall a victim to the
madduations of a secret foe."
"I ~tm furnished with a responsible name on another
slip," answered uncle Ben.
"If the writer anticipates anything like a matrimonial
allh~nce between Mr. Leslie and myself, he will be dis-
appointed. I only speak of him as an acquaintance.
The only relation we can ever sustain towards each
other."
"I admire your devotion to a friend-it is creditable
to you, and I have only to hope he will prove himself
worthy~ of it," remarked uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben knew nothing~ of the remarkable letter
Madeline had received from Douglas Hardy-that their
engagement was now broken-and as he rubbed his large,
graceful hand over the sick girl's forehead, he said, jok-
ingly, with a smile-
"Never mind, Miss Maddy, I will let Douglas know
that you have a new friend here, who may possibly grow
into a formidable rival."
"Oh I uncle Ben, you do not know Douglas has thrown
my love away. He has gone out into the world, and is
now ashamed of so.. simple a creature as I for his in-
tended. So gifted, and brilliant, and with such a future
of fame and fortune before him, it is not strange that he
should seek in the Court of this world's fashion a more
famous and worthy alliance."


~Tk~e' ~ords came from the depths bf M~d~Ui!ie's
h~art.~
"Ha! this is news, to be sure," replied Mi~. Car-
son.
A suspi~ion at once flashed through hi~ mind. ~Phis
sentence of the note he had received, came to mei~ory-
"You do not dream, nor does she (Madeline) of that
as already been accomplished!"
"There is a trick in it!" exclaimed uncle Ben, una-
e ~o ~withhold the conviction that rested upon his mind.
He read the sentence of the note to Madeline and
continued~~-
"II affirm that IL do solemnly believe that Herbert
Leslie has had some hand in bringing about this result."
For several minutes Madeline lay pensive, and then
arousing herself, said-
"Oh! no, he is innocent. In the midst of my dis-
tress he came and sympathized with me, and his gentle
words fell upon my heart like dew-drops on the droop-
ing flower. No, I will not dim or sully the faithful mir-
ror of friendship by the hot and vapory breath of sus-
picion. But I feel, alas! that-
'My days are in the yellow leaf,
The flower and fruits of love are gone,
The worm, the canker~ and the grief,
Are mine alone.
'The fire that in my bosom preys,
Is like to some volcanic Isle,
No torch is kindled at its blaze,
A funeral pile.
'The hope, the fear, the jealous care,
Th' exalted portion of the pain
And power of love, I cannot share,
But wear the chain."'

When. Madeline had finished quoting thQ above lines,
tears gathered fast in her eyes, and fell rapidly' down
her pale cheek. Uncle Ben, whose heart was almost as
tender as a child's, was touched with sympathy, and
turned sside to hide the flood that was swelling in his

CHAPTER XII.
THE CONFESSION.
'WHAT'S the news?"
"The Doctor says she's worse."
"Not dangerous, eh?"
"Yes, Herbert, very dangerous."
The above colloquy occurred between Herbert Leslie
and a young friend.
"It is whispered," began the latter, "that Douglas
Hardy has deceived her, and that she is taking' it to
heart. I cannot believe that Douglas is capable of 'such
a thing, for I am confident that he is ~s true 'a man as
ever walked the earth. That he did love Madeline
Lind8ey, I. have not a single doubt. I will write to him
this evening."
Herbert turned pale as these words were uttered.
"What's' the matter, Herbert? Are you sick? You
are deathly pale !"
"I am subject to momentary fainting spells, but they
are~ only momentary."
Herbert felt condemned. At that moment he would
have yielded his scheme; no matter what the prospect of
success, if it would repair the mischief now resulting
from it. Like his alleged "fainting spells," those feel-
ings were only momentary. The citadel 'of his heart
was too well guarded by evil passions-sleepless senti-

nels-to allow any good resolve to remain long ~it'hin
their dominion. It was the sudden shock of threatened
consequences o~ a melancholy nature that had discon-
certed him. But he was not long in regaining his
former self-possession, and his purpose was as fixed -and
determined as ever, though the very pavements of the
earth should tremble beneath his tread.
"I think I will call this evening and see Miss Made-
line," said Herbert. "Perhaps the affair is not so se~,
rious after all, as we have been lead to believe."
Herbert called late in the afternoon.
When he entered the room, by invitation, Madeline
was supported by some pillows, in a half-reclining posi-
tion, looking through the window at the setting sun, and
the soft rays lingered upon her faded cheek, and cast a
delicately beautiful, but melancholy, glow over her face.
"Are you better?" tenderly asked Herbert.
"I do not know, Mr. Leslie," answered Madeline.
".1 was just thinking," she continued, "that I should
not mind to die if I could sink to rest as quietly as yon-
der sun glides away in its beautiful vermillion shroud.
I love to look upon the serene face of nature,' and im-
agine that I can see God smiling with goodness, mercy
and love; and that I can see bright angels standing
upon the craggy points of the snow-white little clouds
that float dreamily in the blue sea: that I can see harps
in their hands, and diadems upon their brows. Yes, I
love nature. There is no dissimulation in the works of
our Father. There is no deceit 'graven upon Jehovah's
heart.'"
Herbert's head dropped updn his bosom. These
words found their way to his heart.

-utterly unconsciouss of what was passing-sand l~'e

and pray.i.h~.

He must have a cdd, unfeeling heart who can stand
by a death-bed and hear, unmoved, the loud wail of dis-
tress. It would have melted down the stoutest heart to
have heard the sobs of old Nellie, whose he~d was iiow
whitened by the frosts of seventy winters.
"Old Nellie will soon go too, and meet the darling'
child at the Judgment."
Reader let us drop the curtain upon this melancholy
scene, and go to our friends in the North-West.
"I cannot realize that she could be so false to me,"
said Douglas Hardy, to uncle Tom, one evening a month
previously to the occurrences we have just been reTh-

CHAPTER XIII.
"PRETTY NANNIE," OF CLIFTON VALE.
EMBOWERED in the thick forest of Clifton Vale, was
au elegant mansion, a massive granite gothic building,
surrounded with lawns, and walks covered with shells
and white pebbles, and gardens, and~parks, and green
meadows.' In front of the balcony, extending the full
length of the building, with large, tall pillars, that sug-
gested to the mind a union of wisdom, strength and beau-
ty, there was 'a marble shaft, about ten feet high, stand-
ing by a large basin of the same material. From this
column, or shaft, a beautiful fountain gushed, and fell
sparkling into the basin below. Everything had~ the air
of comfort and neatness.
The chain of hills that circled around in the dim and
shadowy distance towering up the welkin, as if the blue
dome .rested upon the peaks "as eternal columns that
end 'in the starry vault and prop the spheres' '-that
mighty chain encircled Clifton Vale, and shut out all
vieW of the world.
Late one evening, just as the grey twilight began to
shut in, and the light of the moon tinged the tops of
the trees, and glanced through leafy woods, in silvery
lines, and' pictured. upon the earth strange figures and
hierQglyphics, while dewy lawn and meadow sparkled as
if countless gems hung upon the bending grass-a weary

~ This uRexpected meeting called up the crowding
iuemories of days agone-.--.when they romped together
over the fields 1and through the woodlands-when life
itself was "as merry as a marriage bell"-when they went
to -the village school, and gave each other simple love-
tokens~ and exchanged shy looks of attachment when-
eve~the austerb master's back was turned. iWave, no-
ble girl! I weep for thy fate. I could. flood these
p~ges ;with- my burning;tears.
.1~Xr. Wolsey was very ambitious for his own children,
and wl~eu he looked upon the noble, 'spirited and imtelli-
gent youiig man before him, he indulged the. hope that
an attachment might spring into existence between him
aud his daughter Louise-might spring forth at ~once
fr~m this meeting, "like Minerva from tha brain of Ju-
pite~ full grown in a day." He was jealous of Nan-
nie, and felt~ half' angry when he saw he~ present her-
self in so neat and lovely a style. Louise and Nannie

siour of~ admiration upon the young maWs face, when he
shQQk the hand~ of Nannie, and he entertained not a
single 4qub~ of his; preference for her.
Wool~ey had cherished a secret prejudice against- the
J~eighton orphans, and all because they elicited more at-
tention from the public than his own children.~ How;re-
volting~ that;a ma~ should have prejudice. against an in~
nocent, fatherless child I How terrible must be the
curse that awaits such a being. Alone in the world-
untaught-in the- great business of life-.with no great
throbbing heart of sympathy to lean" upon when fever
racks the' brain and gives hot eye-balls! Vile man!
to feel no kindly impulse for the orphan in your charge!
Woolsey-was:unkind to these orphans. That was not
all, he- was cruel to them. It is written against him in
the Great Book which St. John saw.
The guardianship of the Leighton orphans placed a
large sum of money into his hands, and this h~ u~ed to
edueate~ his own children. Poor orphans! they must
stay at home and do drudgery, while the -Woolsey ehil~
dren were ~abroad, rioting with their money.
Nannie submitted as best she could, on her mother's
account. - Mrs. Woolsey bought Nannie- a neat silk
dress, but Woolsey affirmed she should not wear -it.
She neVer mufrniired when the silk was folded and laud
aw~y.

Fi~esh fliers, sir-.-beautifiil flowers-won't you buy

These words, so soft and gentle, aroused him, and he
looked up. An Italian flower girl, plainly., but neatly
clad, with a willow basket, swinging on her arm, filled
with ~the Flora~r collection, stood before him upon the
outer edge of the pavement. The little merchantess
was ~about fourteen years of age, of brunette complexion
tiil l~ge swimming blue..eyes.
"ll~yQt1 buy flowers?" said tho little Italian.

"I have no change," she said.

"Th~it this is more than all my flowers are worth."
Very well-this little boluet will do."

"Is that you, Gabriclla?" answered a tall and slender
woman, advanced in years, but possessing ~a smith
pleasant face, and a lively, quick eye. This' woman
had evidently seen better days than these.
"I am glad you have come so soon! Your presence
always makes me happy in the midst of all our misfor-
tnne~-and, oh! my darling child! how my heart aches
when I know you are out in the street, to meet with in-
sult and contempt from low~bred, vulgar people. I've
sometimes reproached myself for not consenting that
you inight~go and stay with the baron De Harman, who
was so anxious, before we left Germany, to take you as
his protege, but I felt, my child, as I now feel, that I
could riot live 'without you."
The daughter threw her arms around her mother's
neck, an~1 imprinted a warm kiss upon the matron's
cheek, and they mingled their tears.
"I am glad ~you did not give me away, mother, for I
should not be happy without I could look daily and
hourly into your' sweet, pretty face. God will help us.

Thus Madeline ruminated, and listened earnestly for
a continuation of the dialogue.
"Did ypu know J~iridsey?" asked Maci

"And is he not dead according to report?"
"He may be for all I know 'bout it !"

As these reflections passed through Madeline's m1~d,

CHAPTER XVIHI.

MAD$iMNE was-an underground' prisoner, with Snow
Ball, her only companion, and without anything to' sub-
sist upon. This was a gloomy~ imprisonment, add the
hope of relief 'lay entirely in making herself known to
the robberaband. At this humiliation cher 'feelings and
pride rebelled~-~and besides, Herbert Leslie was a mem-
ber of thie clan. She 'could hope for no mercy at 'his
hands, edi she trembled as she thought that even he
might be the first to find her out in. her dismal hiding
eAfter using a great while, she ventured out again
intodthe main open channel, with a view of finding but,

She again leached the; curve, and then the rotunda,
followodgelosely by Snow Ball.
A sunalkbeaten path through the largest arch that led
from the rotunda pointed the way to the 'den of high.-
waymen.
Timidly, she passed through the arch, which looked
like a piece of artistic workmanship, rather than the
work sof nature. There was on each side, a heavy, round
coluilan; upon a very close examination of it, however,
their natural formation was perfectly clear. These beau-

tiful pillars were formed by the slow, but continuous
dripping of water for ages, in which were carried sand
and pebbles and lime-stones, which became cemented and
hardened. The arch that rested upon those pillars saas
probably formed in nearly the-same manner. In the
last instance the water did not fall iin -drops, but ran
down on both sides of the surface above, with the com-
bination of material, and deposited, of course, when -the
pillars themselves, had reached the curve .or beginning
of the arch. Before the pillars were formed, these 'little
drops that found their way down the curve above, fell
upon the forming column, and thus nature went on, har-
moniously, noiselessly, and sublimely in her work.
She ventured forward into the dark corridor, and it
seemed that her heart beat so loudly that it would be
heard and lead to her discovery. Feeling her way, and
groping along, she entered a narrow defile, leading in
Northern direction, through a fissure in the cavern, which
would barely admit the size of Snow Ball. It seemed
darker still. The few wandering rays of light that crept
faintly through the rotunda into the arch she first ene
tered, did not penetrate this primeval darkness;-but this
only intimidated, for the moment-did not drives her
back; and safety being the desideratum.-here Made-
line-ensconsed herself behind a large fragment off rock,
which fate seemed to design for the very purpose. -The
broken rock stood upright, and was all covered with moss
upon the South side, whilst upon the Northern extrem-
ity, there fell a little stream, whose rippling and splash-
ing was the only pleasant noise that broke upon the Si-
lence of the eave. This was interrupted by a serpentine his
or the ceroaking of frogs. The pelting of this little-streama

f6i~a~s a~id ages, upon. the' northern .extreniity, had
foii~d~ a '~6rt of ~en~Voylinder." She now 'heard'the
r61Th4i~s c&amp;friing' down th'e passage towards whei~e she-Was
sta4ding..~ It was the work of a moment to discover
thai she and Snow Ball could enter the cylinder, but it
w~ ~narrow work.' In a: low muimur ~he seemed to coin-
mnnicate to' her pony the necessity of profound silcn7ce.
Snow Ball, with quivering ears, and frontal' and 'nostril
rai~d high-and Madeline reQlining against the rock
with .folded~ arms-the npble steed and his brave mistress
awaited the coming of the robber band in painful ens-
peiise. But it was not long that they had to wait. The
tratnpini~ of feet in ~he corridor fell distinctly upon Mad~
ell.d d's ear, and the rumbling sound seemed to roll jar-
ringly down the dark labrynth, until it found a great
i'e~ervoir below-a bottomless abyss. At this moment
o~i4of the band entered the aperture leading directly to
tTiV place where our 'trembling little victim sat.' Fortii-
n~.tely, the foremost one rode a very large horse; as Mad-
eline~ could tell from the fact that he could hot pass the
entrance. Still he' persisted and' was- half way through,
when fragment of rock struck him in the sid~, which
g~e hii~ al~m, ~nd he sprang forward with a' treinen-
dou~ ~exerti6n, that sho7pk the very rocks-atid plunging
froM side to 'side,' fell, at length, into the awful abyss.
It w~s frightful to hear the wild 'neigh of the steed,
min~Thd with the deep groans of the rider which came
up froni the chasm, and go echoing solemnly through the
hwidi~edM ~of ramiffeations of that -infernal cavern; and

the answer of prayer!

with trembling step-she passed cautiously a1or-.a~s-
cenaing. some fifty. feet-for the passage through which
the ray of light came gradually ascended-.--.the Opening
became more capacious. At this moment, strange,
sweet music came stealing along down those dark sub-
terranean aisles! and rose and swelled, until the very
air seemed full of melody.
"What can this mean? Are these earthly sounds?
Or is it a bancpiet of enchanters and fairies~ Methink
these notes are as sweet as those of the syren! that litr~,
even the wary mariner upon fatal rocks. Surely, if
tl~iere be sweet music here, in this dark Tartarean place,

While these reflections were passing through Made-
line's mind, she stepped suddenly and unexpectedlyinto
aJarge apartment that was filled with a dim grey light,
a sort of twilight, in which you could discern distinctly
every object in the apartment. It was a complete J~all,
with a high dome, with a chandelier suspended by a long
iron Qhain and great collossal pillars, standing, .he~ and
there, with beautiful carvings. It evidently had~, ho&amp;n,

It wasa strange, dreamy, enchanted place. Madeline

me~i~gJigli~, as each pendant brilliant glowed with
pr~sm&amp;tic colors. A moment more, and the spell was
br~ken~! A rustling near by aroused Madeline from
her dreamy* contemplation to behold a female standing a
few~. paces in front, of her. The lady gazed first at
M~ade1ine, and then at Snow Ball, who stood tamely by
her mistress.
"Who are you?" required the lady, after several
+ ~ients of silence.
'I am, as you see, a woman, who has had the mis-
fQrtune to wander into this c~ve, and am now endeav-
oring to escape from it and the clutches of the wicked
* men who infest it," answered our heroine.
'~And~ uow, may I be so bold as to repeat your own
questi~rn-'who are you?' "-she continued.
"4~n~iserable woman, duped, betrayed and ruined by
a ~ma~n who mingles in the nightly ogeries that are held
kelow,' "w~s. the immediate reply of the hermitess, who,
as~ she spoke, t~irned her face up to the light, and wiped
her eyes in which tears were gathering.
4Plie light revealed a beautiful, earnest countenance.
4We pass the interview. The imprisoned beattty had
beep~ eptr~ped ir~ the cave; and xiow that she had' been
dishonored, she sought not to leave its gloomy confines.

"There' are several secret passages, hut n~uie lead

"It is now closed by the storm."
"Ah! well, there are other routes, but I do not k~A~W

Madeline turned to retrace her steps, with a h~v~y
heart. Down the dark way she groped along, with her
hand upon Snow Ball's foretop, until, at length, she
found herself again at the shelving rock where. she had
taken refug~ from the robbers. Remembering that*
there was a great abyss near her, she stopped a moment
for reflection. A 'hoarse growl aroused her, and she
turned aroi~nd and beheld, by the dim ray of light, a
huge monster only a few paces from the place where.~
she stood. Snow Ball raised her head, and with a W
snort, sprang between her mistress and the monster.
heroine no~v discovered that the animal, a large. gri~'zly
bear,'was standing on the edge of a cavern--the one
in which the robber had fallen-and was probably
startled from his deep cavernous den by the fall of the
robber-his groans and the wild neigh of his horse.
The bear reared upon his hinder-legs, looked alternately
at Snow Ball, who maintained a firm, war-like p'ositi~xi,
and Madeline, i~emembering that aunt Phebe had~cha~g~ed
her not to go abroad without some means of defence,
placed her hand upon' the pistol, and' awaited the
threatened onslaught. The bear seemed to prefer M~d-
eline for his victim, and crouched himself for' a ~bbld
leap, but Snow Ball whirled in an instant, and 'with~her

yesterday evening, and fearing some accidents would
'befall you, as IL knew these woods were infested by a
band of robbers, I followed the tracks of your horse,
and when I saw that you had taken this route I feared
that you were lost. My apprehensions were increased
when I discovered that you had gone into the cave, and
I could see no signs of your return. I took my stand here,
determined to remain for a great while in the hope of
finding out something which might throw light possibly
upon your fate. I saw two robbers yesterday, and I
gathered by accident from their allusions to Herbert
Leslie's villainy towards yourself that if you were in the
cave you had not yet been discoverca, and I took en-
couragem~nt to remain. 'While they were yet in the
open channel I retired from the brink, least I might be
discWered and my object thereby be defeated. I
walked not away from fear, my child, for I have lived

CHAPTER XIX. Ar
CLOSE OF THE~ INDLAN WAI. .
"Now that rI have related all the incidents my
trip to Woodland, I want to hear of the incidents that
have occurred here since my departure," said Dougu
fas Hardy .to Percy Carson-" and how you escaped
from the Indians -how this Indian war has been
so quickly closed. In a, word, tell me all, not forget.
ting your friend, White Fawn, and all about her."
"With all my heart, I will,'' said Percy; "aMd I
must commence with my own deli Very from the Indians,
as that was the turning point of all the rest, and
brought about a close of hostilities.
"The next day after I wasp betrayed into the hands
of Hawk, the Indians all left th'e camp for a short hunt,
except the Chief, who felt that he would have no diffi-
culty in keeping me a prisoner, inasmuch as I was
bound hand and foot to a tree. I had not been given
a morsel to eat up to that time, and Hawk spent the
timne in tantilizing me with every sort of nourishit
even placing food close to mny lips, and then remodvi@i
it. I told him freely that he was a base, unfeeling
wretch, and a coward. He became greatly incesned at
what he- deemed my insolence, sand were inethe act -of
splitting my head with a tomahawk, when a voice niear,
exclaimed-

"The~ hatchet fell at hi&amp; feet, and he stood motionless.
"U~l&amp;Tom ~and the masked Indian were upon him.
Th~ ~bdth sei~ed1 the terrified Chief, each with one
hand and with the other presented pistols at his temples.
He was then compelled to lie down, while they boi~nd
hihi. I was then released. There were two horses at
tl~e camp; I mounted one ~f them, and Hawk Was
p1~c~d' on the other', and uncle Tom and the masked

diol&amp;~ ~The iilght following he attempted to escape im-
isotiment, and was shot. This led to a termination of
the war.
"FixlI of life and hope, I prepared to set out after

Whole life. When I was ready to go, uncle Tom handed
me a letters Here it is now:

that bad results might come of my peculiar distress ljad~
fallen upon this piece of deception to gradually prepare
my mind. I read the note again and discovered that it
was the handwriting of a female. This gave me more
confidence in the reliability of the note, for I have no
female friends or even passing acquaintances in this vi-
cinity, and the news could not have spread. Further-
more, it then occurred to me that the facts co~ild i~ot be
known to any one in this reghn, without the apprehen-
sions expressed in the letter were true and she was ac-
tually in the country. I was puzzled the more I at-

TRIALS OF AN ORPHAN.

A'~Yot~ xuust be patient," said jDouglas Hardy.

unusual for him.

"Neber saw de cliii' in such a figity afore!" said un-
cle Tom, to himself.
The party consisted of Albinus Lindsey,~ Douglas
Hardy and Percy Carson.~ They threw their heavy
cloaks over their shoulders and walked out to the chaise
that was standing in waiting for them at the gate.
It was now near nightfall, and the black clouds lay
piled up, mountain high, and vivid liglitnings shot
downward across the sable bosom of the coming storm,
as Lucifer fell from the crystalline battlements of heaven,
down through darkness, to the sulphurous regions 9f
hell.
This is certainly an unpromising night for an adven-
ture, ft must be a mission of some importance that
induces them abroad, while nature seems so unpropi-
tious.
In the carriage-the curtains drawn closely down-
the coachman sitting, twirling his whip several times
over his head, with manifest pride, as if there. was great
art in cracking a whip-and there is for aught I know
to the contrary-the chaise was soon rattling down the
road-bou~nd for the vicinity of R
Leaving our friends to the perils of a dark, stormy
night, with twenty-five miles to travel, over a bad road
-a ride withal in which we are glad to have no part-
we will relate some occurrences that transpired a short
time before the circumstances just mentioned.
John Leighton, a cousin of Nannie Leighton, ~o~-
sessed considerable wealth, and was a gentleman of lib-
eral feelings, and a generous~ sympathy for the op.~
pressed. He had heard, with great regret and dis~
11


MADELINE.
p~asu~e, of the unkindness of Wolsey to his orphan
co~s~ns, a~l of his expenditure of their property. He
sel~* 1{anni~ an invitation to visit him, and~p~nd' a mohth
or two with his family. Another cousin of th~ Leigh-
ton ~rph'an~, J~nies Denman, happening in the neigh.~
borh~4 'obout this time, proposed to take KN"annie home
wit~i him; and after she had spent sometime at his
house, to send her to Mr. Lekighton~s. Denman, wish-
'ing t~ b~ i~espectful, asked Wolsey's conseiit to the ar-
z'ai~gement. It was given with seeming cheerfulness,
but iii j~is heart he objected. He "wished to appear kind
to these orphans in the presence of their relatives, and
to huve denied Nannie this privilege would have been
an acknowledgement of an unkind disposition ~towards
"She is welcome to go, and to stay as long as she
may. desire!"
Thus spoke Wolsey; but 'IDenman had scarcely passed
the outer 'door with Nannie, who ~nade haste in getting
Te~dy, ere a tirad~ of abuse was opened upon Mrs.
Wol~&amp;y-~--who usually came in for a 'large share upon
every occasion ~of Wolsey's displeasure towards the or-
phans in hi~ charge.
Bad~'inen are' usually hypocrites, and like Proteus, a
sea~g9~ Oan assume any shape 'they please.
"I' hav~ had never a' wdrd to say in this matter.--yQu
gave your owti'oonsent," 8aid Mrs. Wolsey.
"Po~'~apa. not!" retorted Wolsey, bitterly.
~ pure-~pirited orphan! Fly from the hate-
ful pre~h~9ts of, the plane, where thou has not a single
prot~p~oi~.iio1~even in that mother who gave thee~exi~t-
ence, but dare not defend her own offspring. Would

that I could give thee speed of swift-iVing~d Mbrdi~i'y,
or of Uriel,' in' his transit 6n a ~u~be~m. ~o ! Jet p~fre
frbsh air~bathe thy throbbing temples, and ~ive~ easet to
thy aching heart. Youth, beauty, ho~ei and heal1~h are
thine.
It is due that the wife should yield to the ~hu~bain&amp; to.
a reasonable extent, and under some circumstances bven
beyond-~but' the mother shouldnev~r be less true to'h~r
offspring than the tigress is in defence of' her young.
Our orphan girl spent a fortnight with her coUsin
Denma~, 'whose' heart was too true and gallant to be
other than kind to his' fair relative and visitor.
She then went to 'see Mr. Leighton, who conversed
with her often, with a view of ascertainiPg the extent
of Wolsey's 'unkindness to hei'. She always, however,
in' her calm and unexcitable manner, avoided the recital.
"Would you like to go back? or would you prefer to
remain with us? If you choose to remain with us, I
will pay the expenses of your education, including, of
course, your board, and the supply of your wa#drob~."
These words were uttered by John' Leighton, in thegen..
erosity of his heart.
This sal)y placed Nannie in a position where she felt
bound, from gratitude, to express herself fully-t6 ut-
ter what she had intended to keep shut u~p in kei' own
bosom.' She said:
"I do not desir~ to return to Mr. Wolsey's. lle:has
treated myself 'and my brothers and sisters uimkindly
and 'unjustly.' Thi~ a r'evelati~n I 'di4 'jiot i~it~nd 'to~

~ I wish to avail myself of it."
Johi~LeigJaton ~rose fram hi~ chair, almost uncon~-
sciou~Iy~ ~xcited~by the true courage and heroism of his
ybu ig cousin;~ and advanced a few steps' towards her,
a~aMd~ wi~ht great~emphasis-
Iiia~ve abundance of the goods of this world, and
whM you tall ~ lib~ratitii'is only DUTY. I assure you
that I feel grateful that God has given tue enough pros~

deavor to meet this difficulty when it arises. A contin-
gency which we can in no wise anticipate, for certainly
no thi~hearted' mother would ever wish to lead a daugh-
ter backinto captivity and oppression.".
* A cloud seemed to pass through her' mind. She
looked sad shook ~her head ominously.
She kn&amp;w that if Wolsey determined to bring her
back to hi8 hoii~e he would in all probability adopt this
ruse ~te se~~ure h~r return and to obscure his 'town bad,'
overbearingdisposkion. He could allege that it; ;was
her mother that desired and required her return. She
knew~Vhe cunning :and~ address of Wolsey, and that he
was a~ deterniiu~d in whatever object he undertook to
accoi~ip1is~has 'Lucifer was to pass the gates of hell in

"And do' you apprehend that your mother coul4 be

who readily perceived that some unpleasant misgiving
was passing through her mind. "If so, then I ~ht~ll

"If you refuse to go,. I defy Wolsey or any one else,
to attempt force, and it shall be a dear piece of busi-

his ward, if he wishes."
"He is afraid that-" began Nannie, and a deep
crimson blush suffused itself over her beautiful face, and
she stammered and did not finish the sentence.
"Afraid of what? Tell me all, and I will prove wor-
thy of your confidence; and, as your proteetor4'it .may
be essential that I should'know all."
This assurance 'gave Nannie confidence ~to continue
the revelation she had unintentionally begun.
"The magic of your kindness, and my own profound
sense of' obligation and gratitude, inclines me to express
what else would have remained unsaid."
"I thank you. Go on," interrupted Mr~' Lei~1iton.

paired thither. As he entered, a young man ~arose and
introduced himself.
The personage was Mr. Albinus ,Lindsey.
John Leighton was by nature a sociable, OQiflp~fli9n-
able man. ~e was, if' we may so speak, a talk-lqver.
The few moments preceding tha announcement of read-
iness to receive Mr. Lindsey at the supper table ~erve4
to remove restraint in a great. measure.
After Albinus had concluded his meal and was
ducted back to the hail, a conversationn arose,

They swept from one- theme to another, and whether
on political issues-the probable result of certain? cou$~
binations-and theories, and policies-or whether enter-
ing the more agreeable field of Theology, the young
visitor evinced the same research and ability.
It was easy to discover why Nannie had fallen in love
with Albinus. True, he was not an Adonis in ~beauty
or person, but he possessed what is really more attract-
ive to a sensible woman, spirit and intellect, lit was
Lindsey's heart-his great sympathetic heart-and his
genius that had captured the young, chaste and beauti-
f~il girl. Nor did she regard him as being entirely free
from faults. She had known him long and well enough
to observe those facts,, but they were spots upon the
bright face of the sun.
Lindsey at length requested the presence of Miss
Naunie Leighton.
She soon presented herself', and the ardent lover
thought she looked even more bewitching than when he
saw her at Clifton Yale. Perhaps it was because the

.maiacles had been broken from her spirit, which was
now buoyant and free-and life was in every swelling

CHAPTER XXI.
H OM E WA RD B OU ND , &amp;c .
THE night we saw our friends venture forth, bound
for an adventure, from which storm and darkness 'did
not deter them, Nannie Leighton was taken away
from her cousin's by her friends, and next morning the
party, including White Fawn, were on their way to
Woodland.
Albinus Lindsey had received information that Wol-
sey had gone to John Leighton's with the view of ef--
fecting the return of Nannie, either by stratagem or
force--and he set out to rescue her, and did so.
Wolsey was at Leighton's, and having failed to ob-
tain Nannie's consent to return, and her cousin having
refused to allow her to be taken away forcibly, retired
to rest, disappointed and mortified, but. sleep came not
to his eyes. Evil thoughts passed through his mind.
"I will not be defeated. No, -I swear that my pur-
pose shall in no wise be thwarted." These words of
soliloquy were spoken so loudly that Wolsey started up
lest -he should be overheard by John Leighton in the
adjoining chamber.
*But hark ! Wolsey starts !
"Wolsey! God will resent the wrongs of another!
Provoke no more the thunders of His wrath!"
These words were distinctly uttered-slowly and sol-


emnly-and Wolsey, half-terrified, started towards the
door from whence the soirid proceeded.
"Stop! Stir not another inch! How ~.airst thou
think to go unwhipped of justh~e? You are a base
coward-a snarling puppy-and I have q~i1y to say to
you, that Nannie Leighton i~this ~na~ment in the com-
pany of friends in the carriage with Albinus Lindsey,
and is now ready to leave. You are unworthy of her
resentment She forgives you, and ti~usts that you
yseek~ and ~btain mercy from thy God!".
~W~18ey~ h~ard the retreating footsteps of the one who
bad ~ddressed him as above, an4 ~presently the rattling
of carriage wheels ia's heard down the road.
With beating hearts, and with renewed hopes, the

CHAPTER XXIII.
IN WITH7.'THE TRAPPERS.
NIt~HTFALL set in, and Percy Carson and ~Douglas
Hardy were Wandering through the forest. The moon
that sheds her light into the alleys and broad streets and
i~rowded highways, shone as brightly in the forest; the
staV~that glitter above the spires of the city, when the
wei~ry ehlldr~n of toil lie down to repose, were not less
brilliant in the bhie canopy that spreads over the wilder-
ness. Whose heart is so frigid as not feel thrilling
emotions of joy, worship and love, and drink in the mys-
tic inspiration of Nature, as we behold the :primeval
forest? How I have longed, when contending with ad-
verse fortunes-striving with the cold world-.struggling
to achieve the ends of right living, to retire from the
crowded walks* of life to those distant rural retreats,
that Nature1might whisper to my troubled spirit, "be
still."
"Listen !" exclaimed Douglas.
They stood still. They* heard the approach of a ye-
hide in a Northern direction.
"Down!" whispered Percy.
They immediately got down upon the ground, and
waited in almost breathless suspense.
"And, be jabers, will ye niver be after stopping ?"
"Mend your English, and we may."

MADflLI~E.                 115
"Well! it was not myself that learned to mend any-
thing; but my ould father-barring it ~as my. uncle-
could do the like of it."
"You are a cussed fool, that hain't got any sense, to
be a bother to us."
"Well, it's myself that want's a bit to eat."
"If you had as much brains a~ stomach
"Och! be jabers! and, by my soul, I had rather have
the most stumic.-for there was the chap, little IBai~ney
McOonnel, that died when he quit eating."
"And there was John Smith that died when he quit
breathing."
Percey and Douglas, in their prostrate condition,
heard the above colloquy, and at once decided to make
themselves known to the party who were lumbering along
in a two-horse wagon.
They arose and crie4 out to the party.
They were answered by a yell that sounded like a
trumpet through the still forest.
"And will ye be after stopping a body?"
"Sorry, gentlemen, to detain you, but we are alone
in the woods without any food, and ~without the means
of a comfortable repose."
A brawny fellow thrust his head out through thecur-
tam, and said:
"Stranger, jist fall in behind, yer have no business to
be caught in sich a trap as ye have, but Jerry Ripiim's
not the man to niglict a feller-trapper.'~'
Douglas and Percy got in, and discovered ~ party of
four hardy, rude looking men, lying in the wagon with
apparent contentment. The Irishman, who rode one
of the houses and drove, made the fifth.


1T~               M4DELIN.E.
~" Tj~ught you were trappers, stranger! but you must
be ~onie high4a~rned folks !" spoke Jerry-" city men I
reckon ?"
"No, we are not 'city men,"' ansWered Douglas-
nor are we trappers."
"And bless me soul! here's some water, at last!"
exclaimed the I~ishma~..-and he brought his horses to
a halt, and leaped down with great glee, and began to
unh~rness his team.
This spot was well adapted for a camp. It was a
sni~di, grass-covered valley-that was shut in by abrupt
hills on every side. Out of a bluff gushed a bold stream
of, water.
It. was not long before the horses were alteredd, and
the camp~flye raised. The bold and hardy men circled
around the fire, while the Irishman, whom they called
"old Mal," was busy, preparing a meal. The meat was
soon in the pan and frying away, and the steam rose
beautifully from the spout of the coffee pot.
"Wall, strangers be'nt we're going~ to stay together
to-night," sai4 a low but stoutly built man, who, from
hi~lQ~ks, was about forty years of age, and a regular
backwoodsaian, with a sharp nose and cheek bones, and
shr~w4, puck, black eyes-" you may tell whar, you're

of the cunning of his character; and then it was hand-
ed to the only rrnpaining one of the party, ~ho was ap-
parently not above twenty-five years of age, of fine,

could be seen that he was the leader, although he was
the youngest, f~r they addressed him yery respectfully

littedal'l the circumstances which brought them out alone
and provided for, in the wilderness.
Captain Malcolm was aroused by the story, and ex-
claimed-
"You have friends, gentlemen, in these trappers and
myself."
"That's gospel true, Cap'n-' old Trap' is in to catch
the cussed beavers."
The rest all responded, even to "old Mal," who cx-
"The spalpeens! and could 'myself jist see the bastes,

\VIIITE FAWN'S IMPRISONMENT.
THE pearly gates of morning opened wide for the
chariot of the Suit The bright sunlight glimme~ed and
played upon the little: brook, as beautifully as smiles
upon the face of innocent childhood. Little Ilewers,
dew-drboped~ raised their heads and opened their petals
to behold the sun, and drink in its life-giving r&amp;ys.
Iflirds flew out and chirped away, as merrily as boyhood
joins in the train of a brilliant ovation, in which mar-
tial music mingles.
Th~wn in the valley, where we have seen our trappers
camp for the night, you could see the smoke ascending
upwards, like a grey column, to heaven. The men were
all astir, hurrying to depart-some of them at least.
it was arranged, the night previous,'that '"Slim Leg"
should go early to an ~old liubter's, some four mil~rdis-
taut, and obtain two horses, to be employed in scouring
the country to find out the robbers, and rescue White
Fawn. lie set out while yet the stars were brightly
twinkling in the crown of 014 Night-while yet the
catydid and locust mingled their unique songs.
We have-not attempted to describe the deep agony
that was raging in the bosom of P~rcy Carson. As
there are sentiments of affection and joy that no tongue
1I~

19


can speak, no language convey, so there are deep
sorrows that' are yet untold and unwritten.
What were t~e feelings of White Fawn, a delicate
aiid devoted female, borne ruthlessly, by a band of rob-
bers, away from one she loved? But let us leave the
camp and discover her condition and whereabouts.
The two highwaymen, with their captive; pursue
their way for tke remainder of the day and the night
following. The next morning, early, they rode up to a
spjedrnansion, and jkalted at the gate.
i~e in, gen~leinen! come i~n, gentlemen! I's b~n
lo~k~n' for ~, aome time, Where's the other boys~"
Thus spoke a grey~ey~d little ~nan to the two high-
w~yWen.x, It was easy tQ detect the mean, scoundrelly
p~m~iple. Qf the speaker by the very expression of his
1~e~1anee. His eyes were never raised above your
feet, and had a wild glassy appearance. A low for~~
head, and flat chin, formed the contour of this peculiar
soaup4xeb We ~say pe~rn1iar, because he had more ec-
cen0~ic ways to illustrate his villany than any man you
ever knew or heard of. I do believe if you were to
paint, a .worthless picture of a dime-or cut a wood rep-
r~sen1~ion ofj one cent, he would steal it the first op-
portiuiity-~-not that you had succeeded in deceiving him
into the belief that it possessed value, but merely~ for
the gratification ~f such a reflection as this: jf it had
beezi~ money~ 1unv~qunning1~ 1 got it. Our hero was ~,t
the head of the highway~nen all over the country, 4~d
his splendid residence was their head-quarters. lie
was~ w~akbhy $p iard-Gonzoles~ by name-and had
n~oved out. into the ~North-Western territory, perhaps to
leave the. pale. of' refined society where he was unwel-

come; or, it may be, whe~e 'better opportunities of
thieving were afforded with less chance for apprehen-
sion and punishment. Here he had built, in the'superb
old 'Spanish style; a costly '6illa, which was edolosed
with a' granite wall some fifteen or twenty feet 'high,
which had two heavy, massive iron. gates, ~ne 'at 'the
north4ide and the other at the south, at whkh stood
sentinels, to admit only those who possessed the secret
sign and pass-words. A retinue of servants was kept
up-sentinels, porters, grooms, steWards, and ~xn~ssea-
gers, so that everything was reduced to a ~tyle of
princely living. The building was of granite, with
towers running up as wings, at the front cdrners.
As'the two highwaymen approached the villa, 'Gon..
~oIese was up in one of the towers and beheld'theni at a
great distance with ~his spy-glass and he went down to'
the~gate to receive them.' As they rode up, the heavy
gate swung open, and they entered, and the gate blos~d,
and' the great hon bolts gratingly moved back into~t~bir
sockets.
"Well, Boss," spoke one of the highwaymen, "things
haint gone to~ our notion, by no means. The boys had
their triggers knocked by some cussed fellers, but we
fotch this critter 'long fur you."
"Don't say so, gen'men!"
"Fact, Boss-give us bringer that crack."
Grooms received the horses, and White Fawn was
carried by Gonzolese to the east tower. Stairway after
stairway was passed-up and up they ascended the dark
tower until they reached a room with a 'small window,
affording a view in the direction the highwaymen came.
This was White Fawn's prison. $he was gruffly pushed


in and the door was locked from the outside, and the
retithig $ootst~ps of old Gonzolese down the long stair~
ways belo* was all that greeted White Fawn's ear.
She )i~d' no time to behold her situation and to realize
fully ~the extent of her misfortune. She walked to the
nafl4ow window anci gazed out upon the forest, musingly.
"is life real? is hope an allusion ?-an ignis fa-
tut~s? Why durst thou toil and struggle, vain, foolish
cr~ttire ~f the earth, 'to obtain wealth and 'pomp, when
th6t~ ihalt be' crushed as a worm beneath the feet of a
gia~ntV' I
At~d as~ White Fawn mu~ed, she' beheld far off four
horsemen,'arid her eyes kindled with animation, but~ then
she reflected th~t they were in all probability robbers.
At this reflectionn, her heart sank within her-~-in fact
hope, tinder the circumstances, seemed out of the ques-
tion..
Wearied and heart-sick she drew an old sofa that was
in 'the room close to the little window, and exhaneted
natuto was ready to seek repose.

CHAPTER XXV.
RESCUE AND RE-UNION.
WliITE FAWN spent a night of feverish repose. The
morning rays of the sun illumined her prison. She
arose from her couch and went to her little window to
inhale the cool, refreshing morning air, andahe beheld
again the horsemen, nearer this time than before. What
a thrill of joy she experienced at beholding Percy Car-
son and Douglas Hardy. She threw out, from the win-
dow, a 'red scarf, and held it by one hand. It fluttered
to the breeze some moments before it was discovered by
her friends, when she saw them return a sign of recog-
nition. Looking down to the yar4 below, she beheld old
Gonzolese and the two robbers walking slowly towards
tho iron gate in the direction of her friends. She waved
her h:t ud and retired from the window.
Gow~olcse and the robbers passed out of the yard,
and walked slowly up the road. White Fawn returned
to witness the result. Moments' of extreme, painful sus-
pense passed. Percy Carson and Douglas Hardy and
the two trappers watched them narrowly, and at the
proper time rushed out' from their covert upon the rob-
bers. They were confounded and attempted to flee.
"Old hess, now, don't be in sich a fidgity to get back!"
naively remarked Slim Leg, extending his long arm and
seizing old 'Gouzcilese by the, VhrQat, Tht~ grip was as

firm as steel, "Ye old cuss! Slim Leg's gwine to have
satisfact on!"
"SatiM~etion for what?" gaped Gouzolese.
"Fur that lick old Mal gin me! ye cussed booger !"
replied Slim Leg, at the same time giving his trembling
prisoner a severe bQX. "Old hess, that ain't a circuni-
stance !"
I' Couldn't say 'bout it's hem' a1 circumstance, but it's
a li~z~ll of a lick 1" remarked old Trap, grinning with
delight.
Whik these incidents were transpiring, the othor two
ro~b~s were captured by the rest of the party. Their
arm~ *ere pinioned behind them, and they were ordered
to return' before their captors to tue mansion.
"You only want the lady released, gen'men !" re-
niark~d 0onzolese.
"That first!" remarked Percy Carson.
"Hope ye don't want nothing' else," continued Gon-
z&amp;lese.
"One thin
value g~at a time, sir-and no more words, if you
your lives a copper !" replied Douglas Hardy,
sharply.
~,Tb~other two robbers walked on sullenly.
They were presently at the gate, and the sentinel
opened it-~and, in his alarm, was about to flee.
"Got a word with iou! Brought this here shoe-
string 's~essly~ for ye !~' remarked &amp;ld Trap, drawing
fro~m hi~ pocket a piece of rope4 "'Sense me!" he cow
tinued, "for~ tying yQU!"

the way up the steps while he fo~wed~ close bel~ind

robber~~
"Old Trap, just walk this here way~!" e~cJaiii~ed Slim
Leg. , ." Blast ef they hain't got; a fine breakfast snok-
in 'in here!" pointing into a large hall. "Pernal-as
the good i~ook says-"
"That's a lie! Slim Leg! Derned ain't in the Bible 1"
interrupted old Trap.
"Pooh! I was gwine to say my bowels yearned after
that thar breakfast-derned ef they doesn't!. And
'spose we set down and help ourselves, just~ as~ 4 this
here belonged to us? Slim Legs bound tQ have all 4ch
doing's as this here, some of these days. But he7s not
gwine to git it, as, these cusses, who have no conscience.
Slim Leg's gwine before God with a clean conscience 1"
Thus spoke Slim Leg, as the two trappers sat down
to the table, and began to eat right 'heartily.
Going before God with a clean, conscience! What a
noble sentiment! Think of it ye that have grown i~pary
in your rascality. You that have accumulated wealth
by nameles~ and countless little and big villainies. Will
you go before God with a clean conscience? Thou ~er~d!

"WM~LA~'D! '~ exolaiined the coachman. Wood

"~D~t~&amp;a fact! bless God! ~Old Tom neber did spect

voiee. "Only see the blossoms peeping through the

~Aii&amp; 'we~ too,. exclaim how beautiful! It was after
ni f~ll,~ and quiet reigned. There ~yas Woodland,
suim~wded by those grai~d old trees, standing around,
quiet and motionless, lik&amp; midnight seutitiel8; and the
light of the moon poured through the thick foliage sand
brightened the~ meek face of each little flowered, and
glowe4 brilliantly in the dewArop.
"And do you design -to stop with us?" asked Ak
binus Lindsey, (for we may as well say he is one of the
party,) addressing ~an aged gentleman, who alighted
fromu the coach.                A
"And is this not an inn?" -asked the gentleman,
rubbhi~ his eyes.
"N&amp;, sir, but we would gladly have you remain over
with us until morning'

"I need repose, and will ~therefore aceej~ yowr offer
of hQ~pit~dity with .gratitu4e."
The baggage of the ~1d. gentleman was taken oi~t of
the coach with the other baggage. The car4s i~poi~ his
tvunks bore the inscription: "LeRoy knuanee, Man~
chester, England." The traveler's bearing betokened
rank and intelligence.
"But hoW came this trunk marked to Woodland?"

'Aft~ the confusion of the meeting was aver, Made-
lin~e was intro~mced' to White Fawn and Pretty Nannie,
and' 'she received them 'with evident pleasure, and"gave
them marked attention.
Woodland, usually so quiet, had quite a number of
gueBt~. flesides the pt~rty if' six that we have Just in-
tro~dueed, two elderly gentlemen' had requested lodgings
for ~the ~1ight, and had been freely permitted to remain.
They did not' come 'together, arid were strangers to each
A half hour~rom the 'rival of D6uglas and Albi-
nus, 'and their friends, they' were all sitting in the ~neat
parlor; 'atid~the light gleamed brightly 'from the chatide-
her ~that 'suspended from the centre above, and each
pendant brilliant, flashing and glowing, arid dazzling
with prismatic colors, seemed to possess new, fresh
beauty.
'~" Mr~ Pennance, I suppose, from KN[anchcster, Eng-
land ?~' said Albinus, addressing the gentleman who
oaine on the coaoh with them; "I will introduce you to
myif$ends."
* "L9Roy ~ennance !?' exclaimed one of the strangers.
~" Ay! why?" was the answer.
~4And'ho#is'this ?" inquired the first speaker, evine-
ing great agitation.
'# Loa~rnovtell;" answered Mr. 'Penn'ance-" who' are
'~ Ihtnptori' Lindsey," he answered.
"What! Hampton Lindsey ?~' exclaimed the other.

"1~a~pto~' Lindsey !'1' 'exolainied the third stranger.
The effectt was electrical. Here ~wa~ HamptourLind-
sey! long believe' to be dead-~iftei~ an absence of
thirteen years-standing in the presence of his~farnily!
Could it be reality?.
Albinus' looked at his father with am expression of
doubt, but all incredulity soon vanished away, when
Lindsey exposed a deep scar on his left breast~.
"My Father !" explained Madeline, an4 she rtr8hed
into the arm~ of Lindsey. He sustii~irie4 her for some
minutes, and then, looking earnestly into 'her faee,~said:
"No, Madeline! I am not your father; but he is hez'e;"
and the speaker turned and pointed to Mr. Pennatice.
"Here is your father. Yo~r name is~ not Lindsey, as
you have supposed, but Pennance !"
LeRoy Pennauce gazed ~earnestly and affectionately
upont his beautiful daughter. 'Madeline felt half bewil-
dered by these developments, but she presently k~ecol-
lected the conversation between the robbers in the ~~ave.
r
Mr. Pennanoe received her hand and led her to ~Csofa.
'~And it wa~you, father, that sent me the robe from
England."
"Yes, my daughter! The material of which it' Was
made was bought a great while ago for your mother,
who proved unworthy of It, and-"
"Who was my mother V" required Madeline.
Just at this moment Uncle Tom entered and ran to
his master and fell at his feet, crying alotid~ Old m~man
Lindsey *epb without restraint when he beheld Ida a~ged
servant at his feet. In came old Nelly, and, ru~hiiig1up
to her master, she began to pound him right hardly with
her hands on the shoulders.

Wbile th%~ scenes were rapidly tran~pi~g, ~ third
~ now the o~ily ~tranger.~-evinoed ex~rdi-
nary emotions by springir~g to hjs feet and started back
with, paie% ghastly features. This attracted the ~tten-
tion of Limd~ey and he addressed him in this wise:
"Sir, we~ met here three strangers, under one roof,
we wish, now, tOr become acquainted witli you, so that
we may enjoy these scenes as friends."
"Hampton, you do not ki~w ;me~ ?'~'
"Jerrald! thank God, the reunion is perfect."
"Forgive me, Hampton !"
"In the r~ame of God~ I do."
The brothers embraced.
"De Lord knows! here'~ massa Jerrald~-a4fter jump-
ing off ob de rock at Olifton~"
"~Clifton Height I" exclaimed INannie.
"Clifton Height!" joined White Fawn and Albin-
us Lindsey.
"How's this?" asked Douglas Hardy.
'~' Wonders will never cease," remarked Percy Car-
son.~
"What* of my child?" asked Jerrald indsey of uncle
Torn.
"Iij~'e she is !" replied the old servant gatheri~ig
White Fawn in his arms. "Dis is de child, G~brelia,"
and he bore Jiek' to her real father, Jerrald Lindsey.
"OldTorn was j~i8t gwine to 'vest her wid de 'state,"
and as he spoke he drew from his bosom an old greasy
p~ckag~, :the one he had received from. Clifton Height.
A~W0ll, d~ ~o now !" interrupted Jerrald.
"And make the talk I was gwine to?"

"Well," said uncle Tom, clearing his throat, rising
proudly and facing the bewildered White Fawn.
"Well, Miss White Fawn-.-'cept that ain't your
name, it is my duty to give you de 'state left you by
your poor dead father, who ain't dead now-but he was
dead, case I seed him jump off ob de r6ck."
A smile spread over every countenance and shone
forth brightly amid tear~.
"And what of-of----what of-Mary?" asked Jer-
raId of his brother.
"Ah! that is ~ painful question," answered Hamp-
ton, "but this is the proper time to anSwer it," and as
he spoke he regarded LeiRoy Pennance earnestly. "She
became the wife of my friend, Pennance, and he was an
affectionate, kind, indulgent husband, and their union
was blessed with the birth of Madeline-but distrusting
and jealous by nature, she doubted her trust-worthy hus-
band. She left him, fled to disgrace and infamy. Mad-
eline was left to my charge. By her father's request
she was to pass as my daughter until she became old
enough to know and consider properly the facts con-
nected with l1~r unfortunate mother. But let us pass
them now, since Mary has long since paid the great debt
of nature which, sooner o~ later, all of us must discharge."
As the last words were spoken tears gathered in the
eyes of .Pennance, and he turned aside.
The evening following, witnessed the marriage of the
three happy couples.
Our story is finished.
