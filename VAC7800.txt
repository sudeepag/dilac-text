Some ; -men don't appear to! be able to get along without them. Mar- riageable orphans are scarce. It has been sung (by an old bachelor, for money) that "a child in the house is a well spring of pleasure." It remains for me to sing about mothers-in-law as well- springs. My lyre is all right but my voice is none of the best. But there is no use of entering'into a tedious description of this "well-spring," for although they are alike as a general, bhing, no two men have the same experience.. I will simply give mine in a round, illustrated tale. Of course I was in love with Harriet Ann, or I. should nev- er have married her. So far was 1 gone on her that I never stopped to ask myself if she had a mother. But I distinctly remember that she hinted at being an orphan, probably by 'way of encouraging my interest. We were made one and struggled through the saccharine effulgence of our honeymoon,             . A month or so after that happy event was over with, my wife said to me one morning: "Brickey, my dear, I have just .  received a letter from my mother, and she says she is coming to pay us'a/good long visit. Ain't you delighted?"    MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. NN "BRICKEY, MY DEAR, I HAVE JUST RECElVIB A LET'IT'K  FROM MfY MOTHER, AND SHE SAYS SHE IS COMNG TO PAY US A GOOD "ONG VISIT. AIN'T YOU DELIGHTED?"  She was holding the letter in her hand as she communicated  this pleasing bit of intelligence to me. I looked up from my paper. Wasn't I 'lad? Somehow or other I can't say that I was. But I was "fresh," and tried to make myself believe that my mother-in- law was only the ripened goodness of the beautiful bud I had snatched at the altar. I distinctly remember of looking in the glass a few moments after she made the announcement to me, and of not being able to recognize myself, my face had elongated to such an extent Seemed to anticipate something, as it were. I had never experienced a mother-in-law, but I somehow felt that I didn't hanker after one very much.   MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. During our honeymoon trip we had paid a, short visit to her mother, and although she was all smiles and good advice, I somehow thought that I would not care to have that two hundred pound mother-in-law for a boss. I dismissed the thought, however, for I was so happy that I could think of nothing but my own woutsy poutsy-ducky-dim- ity-of a wife. We left the old lady, who, by the way, was a widow, and continued our journeyings until the moon had waned and we became sensible enough to settle down to housekeeping.  OH YES WASN'T I GLADI  I K'iEW I SHOWED IT IN PM FAOcB FOR I 'ELT THE BLOOD TINGLING THE END OF MY NOSE.   6         MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. A year had passed and we were getting along very nicely hen my wife made this startling announcement, that her mother was coming to live with us. "Pay us a good long visit," was the way she put it, but knew well enough, felt it in my bones somehow, that her good long visit meant a permanent residence. Oh, yes, wasn't I glad! I knew I showed it in my face, for I felt the blood tingling the end of my nose. "Ain't you glad, Brickey?" she asked again. Well, yes, of course anything that will make you happier Harriet Ann." "But you don't look very happy. Oh, she is such a splen did woman, my dear. So careful, such a good calculator. Not a bit like most mothers I assure you.'      I "I hope not; for if she is, Harriet Ann, she will rouse a sleeping lion. If she attempts to fill the bill of the average mother-in-law, I will teach her a lesson that she will not for get," I replied, almost fiercely. "Oh, oh! how can you talk so?" "Because I mean it, I will be the master of my own house and don't make any mistake." "Oh, arn't you awful, I never heard you go on so before But there is no occasion for it; my mother is a perfect angel of goodness and I know you will like her." "Well, I hope so, but if she is not-" here I banged my hand over my head and strode from the house, leaving my Harriet Ann in tears. But I meant business. How sorry I was that I had neg lected my physical training. My muscle was all down, and ' resolved to set about getting it up again without loss of time not knowing what might happen. After attending to business at the office I went directly to     8.         MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. a gymnasium and made arrangements with the proprietor to get my muscle up. There was yet two weeks in which to work before that two hundred pounds of " ripened goodness" arrived, and wonders might be done in that time. The professor under whose care I placed myself advised me to diet on oatmeal porridge and milk, as that was one of the best dishes in the world to feed and sustain the flAscle. Then he put me at the dumb bells. The next day he gave me Indian clubs to swing and the next I practiced on the flying trapeze. Even this was not deemed sufficient, and the next day he gave me a pair of boxing gloves and set me to knock- ing a suspended sand bag around. This was my delight, for I made myself believe that it was my mother-in-law, and ,the way I did "lam" it was a caution. But it must not be supposed that I got through 'with all this exercise without some mishaps. One day I would go home with a black eye, a bunged head, a crippled leg or bruised body. The artist 'has relieved me of a fuller ex- planation by picturing a few of my 'bouts in his own graphic way. All this, of course, did not escape the anxious eye of my wife, but I made various excuses for my mishaps and she never mis- trusted what I was up to. I can't swear that I made as much progress with my muscle as I ought, for the labor attending my violent exercise was al- most too much for me. In fact, at the end of two weeks I don't think I was so strong as I had been before. This might have discouraged another, but my heart was in it and the signet of conquest was stamped on my towering brow.   MY MOT"HR-IN-X&W.       9 SEEING NO HOPE IN THS DIRECTION I SHOVED MY HANDS INTO , MY POCIETS AND BEGAN TO PACE UP AND DOWN TI F TRACPI. WASN'T I HAPPY? Well, at length the day of her arrival came, and I went to the depot to meet and welcome her. Wasn't I happy, though? We live just a little way out of the city and I haunted that depot an hour before it was time for the train to arrive. But the principal charm for me was the telegraph office, I listened to the clicking instrument and watched the expression of the operator's face.         .  You see, I didn't know but that train might run off the track or some other accident happen that would kill everybody on it. I venturec to ask the operator once if there was any newt regarding the next train, but he replied No, and said he guesse it was all right.    How good that was of him! H-e probably thought I was anxious regarding the safety of some friend who was on board. Well, I was. Seeing no hope in this direction I shoved my hands into my poekets and began to pace up and down the track. Wasn't I happy! While thus employed I did not hear the approaching train and might have been run over had not the station agent yelled at me and asked if I was ambitious to give the coroner a job or trying to get the insurance on my life for the benefit of my wife. This brought me to my senses and I leaped upon the sta- tion platform just in time to save myself. The train came to a. standstill and out came the old lady, pulling and shoving half a dozen bundles and bandboxes after her. -I heard somebody who was looking out of the car window say, "Good riddance," and instantly concluded that the old lady had made herself felt among the passengers. She did not see me so quick as I did her, and after gazing up and down for a moment, she sat her luggage down upon the platform and began to hunt for me. She found tne very soon, and she made a break for me. I tried to avoid her but she covered too much ground and so scooped me in. "Lordy, massa, son-in-law, how de dew? I am so glad tew see you," she exclaimed, swinging her huge umbrella and div- ing for me. I extended my hand for a shake, but that did not satisfy her; did not give vent ti her great and overwhelming love. No, no. Throwing her asrms around my neck she proceeded to give me a hug that made every joint in me creak. Then she sought   mY MOTHER-IN-LAW.'.1*l THROWING HER ARMS AROUND MY NECK SHE PROCEEDED TO GIVE A HUG THAT MADE EVERY JOINT IN ME CREAK. my dewy lips, and in doing so nearly bit my nose off, and "gave me a kiss that woul have annihilated a large sunfish. , "My son, I am so glao to see you," she said between her hugs and smacks.                ' "Ye-yes-so be I," I gasped, a t the same time thinking what a poor show my muscle had with hers. "How is Harriet Ann? '       ' "Quite well." "Oh, my son, how glad I am to see you," she said again, and once more she made for me.                -  1 But I dodged and her huge arms came together with a sugm gestive thud. S.* a:   MY MOTaER-Im-LAW..  "You're not looking near so well as you was." "Oh, but I am feeling first-rate," I replied, bracing up with the intention of showing her that I was no kid. "Glad tew hear it, real glad. Come tew stay with you quite a while. Arn't you glad?" "Oh certainly." What a lie!  "Young people allers ought tew have an old hand around when they're first commencin'. But I'll set you agoing all right. Know all 'bout it." I groaned.  "But come, where's your kerrige?" she asked, looking around. SHE TURNED AWAY TO SEE THE STATION AGENT WHO WAS INSPECTING HER TRAPS, WHLE I WENT FOR A CHREW OF "MAYO FLOWER TO TAoE THE TASTE OF ER KIESX3  OUT OF MY TYOUTH.   "Haven't any. No carriages in town."           . "Wa], that's smart. What kind of a town is this, anyway?" " she asked, sharply.                   . "Oh pretty good I guess."   .. "Why don't you live in New York?" "Can't afford it." "Oh, pshaw! I've hearn you're rich." "Nothing of the kind I assure you." "Wal, I'm sorry. But how 'm I going tew get my things tew the house 8 Where d' you live?" "About a mile up this way," I replied. ' Goodness gracious!" "But I guess I can carry your things." She turned away to see the station agent who was inspect- ing her traps, while I went for a chew of "Mayflower " to tako the taste of her kisses out of my mouth. "rWal, come here," she called, turning to me. I walked leisurely to where she and her luggage stood. She gave me a sharp glance of iniuiry. Didn't appear to think I was very enthusiastic at her coming. "Now be careful," she said, pointing to a pile of her en. cased duddery. I stooped and begrn to load up. "Mighty queer that there arnt no kerriges in town," she muttered, as I was loading myself. "Are these all yours?"I asked. X "Why sartin. Don't call that much, I hope. Guess you don't know much 'bout traveling. Careful now!" "All right, ll do the beat I can." "I didn't exactly 'spect this. 'Taint exactly the way to re- ] ceive your mother-in-law, d' you know it 2"  1 made no reply and started towards home loaded down with bandboxes and bundles, while the old lady marehed           M!

She was evidently disappointed with me and the reception Tshe got, and the ground fairly shook as she put her big feet down upon the road. But wasn't I happy, though?  Not a word passed between us for some time. She was probably quite as busy with her thoughts as I was with mine. : How would it end? I gave it up.  While meditating over this conundrum a big dog that hap- pened to be passing along suddenly saw a smaller yellow one that he thought he could shake the stufing iout of, and evi- dently feeling that he wanted something of that kind, he set upon the poor cur and he ran between my legs as if seeking protection. Reader, did you ever get run into by a yellow dog Did you ever know a yellow dog that did not make trouble I had rather be run into by a locomotive. Then I know what is coming and what to expect. This yellow dog ran between my legs and tripped me up Yellow dogs always do that. I went to mother earth in a most demoralized style. Some of the bandboxes reached the ground first, and I was saved a broken head by striking it upon one of these bandboxes. But I went clear through it, I buried my mug in the mys- teries of that affair, completed the destruction of it while trying to extricate myself from its contents, while that yellow purp continued on and ran between my mother-in law's legs, and -over she went, wildly flourishing her umbrella and shouting. S' Scat!"Git out!" and making her teeth chatter as she came 4ownf.   MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. 1 WENT TO MOTHER EARTH IN A MOST DEMORATTZn STYE.. SOME OF THE BANDBOXES REACHED THE GROUND FIRST AND I WAS SAVED A BROKEN HEAD BY STRIKING UPON ONE QF THEM. Ithink a demoralized yellow dog would throw Homer Lane. Always get people down. My mother-in-law collected a crowd. Her voice would do. that anywhere. I extricated myself and attempted to assist her in rising. But she wouldn't have it. "Go 'way, you graceless scamp!" she cried, flourishing her umbrella over her head as she sat there on the ground. "Are you hurt?"I asked. "Hurt! you good-for-nothing scallawag you. See what, you have done to my best bandbox. "Itt. mv dear madam. T couldn't beln ;t. 1--"   MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.        1? 'Don't you dare tell me you couldn't help it. I see through you like a book. You are mad because I have come, and you, have smashed my things." "But the dog-" "Don't dog me!" she screamed, struggling to her feet. "Don't dare to dog me." a But I assure you-" "You do, eh?" she exclaimed, seizing me by the nose and' giving it a fearful twinge. Perhaps I can Phcenixize this by saying that I incautiously placed my proboscis too near her two digits which were at that moment contracting their grasp and that I held her there; with my nose until she cried enough.                     , t\      \ "YOU DON EH Ad SHE EXOCTATIVrnX, gSIltlNj B B Y THE NOSE AN GIVING IT A.

"How dare you treat me in this way?" she asked, trying- to twist the whole snoot off of me. "Madam, release your hold!"I cried. "I'll show you what is, what. I'll learn you to treat your mother-in-law in this way." At that moment some mischievous boys began to- have fun with the wrecked baggage. But she did not notice it, she had  her hands too full of the business before her. "Madam, I shall strike you if you do not release-my nose,". -said I. "You will, hey? I'd'like tew see you strike me, I would inn -deed," and she gave me a slap which nearly threw me to the ground. "Old woman, you are an old beast!" "And you, sir, a're a poltroon." "H-'7   - "Silence Pick up my things carefully and lead me to my- saceriflced daughter."  I felt just then as though I was the sacrificed individual, but I was not sure about anything. However, I gathered up her things and started on, resolved upon asserting- myself after. wards. Oh, wasn't I happy? But I resolved on a deep and swift revenge, I would teach -her to trifle with me thus. We finally arrived at my house, and mother and daughter flew to each other'sarms. I was willing, in fact, I wished they would get warm enough to melt together and be unable to get .apart. But, oh, wouldn't I assert myself? "My poor, dear child I " * c    X20        -MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. "My dear, dear mother!" , hen they hugged and simpered and kissed. "Oh, my poor child, you have thrown yourself away I fear," said she; glancing at me. "Why so, mother " asked Harriet Ann. "Because your husband is a bad man." "And you are an old catamount, madam," I hissed. The old lady was holding my wife in her arms as she held her about weaning-time, and hugging her fondly. She started ,up as I spoke. "Do you hear that, Harriet Ann? Do you hear how your poor mother is being abused the first time she comes into the house?" "Oh, dear me, what is the matter " my wife asked, anx- iously. "Well, well, I guess he won't put on many more airs over me; I'll learn him his place," I overheard her say. "Madam! H" I approached her. "Shut up, sir." She approached me, but we didn't come to blows. "This is your angelic mother," I sneered, as I took my hat and started--towards the door. "But she will be wise if she neglects to rouse the lion in me." I glanced back as I was about to leave. The old lady had again returned to her daughter and once more taking her up on her enormous lap she was rocking p and fro, and both wer, indulging in " a real good cry." I drew my proud nose to one side in scorn and passed out of the house. The first battle had been fought and I was stir the boss of my own house. Things failed to work well th-atday. My bristles were up and I disdained chin" from anybody,   ANT MOTHER-IN-LAW.        21 I caught myself banging away at imaginary fat old women, ,veral times, and once while I was sending out my "awful right" for the purpose of giving that imaginary mother-in-law, one on her "bugle," my friend Carboy entered my sanctum unexpectedly and received it on his nose. He didn't like it a bit. "I'm sorry, old man, but the fact is, I was just showing myself how I shall 'paste' my mother-in-law if sle attempts to make any trouble in my house." "Well, I wish you would keep on showing yourself or showing her, and keep y,our fist off of my nose," said he, gath- ering up the gore in his pocket-handkerchief. / "Carboy, consider yourself an experimental sacrifice." He went away mad about something, How belligerent I was! I wrote blood-curdling editorials, 1 refused to take a drink when asked, and treated everybody uncivilly with whom I came in contact. The fact was, I had only begun to ponder seriously upon the indignity that had been offered me by my wife's mother, and the more I thought about it, the madder I became. Zounds! She had actually laid hands on my person! Had actually taken me by the nose because I tumbled over that dog and burst the crust of several of her bandboxes. Flesh and blood could not stand it; neither could gristle. And to think of it again, how did she dare to take my nose between her thumb and finger? I tried to think why I had not smitten her to the earth and then and there asserted myself! I finally concluded that her sex alone had saved her. But it would never save her again, that I felt sure of. My blood was up. She had roused the sleeping lion--let her take the consequences.  I grew hotter and hotter as I thought of it, and I longed for ^   82 *  9    MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. the endof my day's work that I might-once more return to my' home and even more fully assert myself than I had done in the morning. When night came, I took a drink to steady my nerves. That is to say, I wasn't afraid of anything, but I don't believe ui going into battle with unsteady nerves. All great generals have contended against it. It did quiet me wonderfully, for by the time I got within a quartar of a mile of my house, I began to feel less inclined to figt. But not to be fooled with, oh no! "3 -'  C]DA. , YOU DON'T KNOW ME," I Y-FT T,n,'D THRUSTINI MY FP4C - CDSR INTO HER OWN, "YoU SPERAK oO IMPOSsrnr ITTES, MADMr    MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.        23 . If she behaved herself and did not molest me, I felt that I would exhibit enough of the Christian spirit to forgive her  for what she had done already. "But let her beware of the purring lion," I said as I opened the door and entered my Aomicil.  I summoned all my dignity and sternness as I entered the -sitting-room where I expected to find my enemy. But she was not there. My wife sat there alone. She did not look up as I entered, which was quite an uncommon thing. On the contrary, she always made it a  practice to encircle my willing neck with her fond, round arms, and ask me what I had brought her home that was nice. I at once suspected that her mother had been setting her  against me. "What is the matter?". I asked.   - She looked half-way at me with a half-way frown but  made no reply. Then my blood leaped again. "Madam, are you sick?"I again denanded, in a louder 'key. Well, perhaps not, although I might be happier than I am," she replied, with a little dash of bitterness.  "Yes, madam, and so might I be if the spirit of trouble had not entered my house."                  ' "I will not hear you abuse poor, dear mother in that  way, sir. She is a dear, good woman, and I wish you were as good." There it was! The cause flung right in my face. "Madam, you don't know the lion that is in me. Your mother must leave the house or I shall." \  She made no reply, as though she didn't care a fig wheth-  er I went or stayed. I felt myself grow a foot in my ain- dignation.    -s-  ^      mzy D IOTHER-WN-LAW. o I SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING ON HER LAP AND HOLDING HER nTO * THE CHAIR, EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS RAINING BLOWS TPON TPE IXTREYMTY OF MY SPINE WITr[ HER SHOE. "Where is she?"I yelled. "In the kitchen." '  "Ah! I'll see whether I am to be traduced in my own house. I'll see who'll stay and who'll go," saying which I made a stride for the kitchen where in all likelihood the old' woman had already established herself as her headquarters, Mothers-in-law boss the kitchen. I  found her there as I expected, with her s eeves rolled up and putting things to rights. "Madam, either you or I must leave this house!" I hissed. She turned around and surveyed me from head to foot with. out making any reply. She was evidently afraid of me. "I  have always heard that a mother-in-law in a family is a source of trouble and blight, and I see thus early that you are , not an exception to the rule," I added.   MY MOTHElR-IN-LAW.        e-e "You behave yourself like a man andyou'll have no try -j le; but if you show me too often that my poor dear child threw herself awayi you may expect' to hear from me," said she, plao- ing her big arms alimbo and marching up in front of me. "Zounds, madam! This is my own house?" "Yes, mind your business and go in fand try to cheer up your poor neglected wife." "She needed no cheering until you eame." "What's that? Don't you give me any of your sass or I'll take you across my knee," she said, slapping her huge hands -together. "Madam, you don't know me," I yelled, thrusting my fice sclose into her own, "You speak of impossibilities, madam." "I do, hey? I'll show you." With this she attempted to seize me, but I warded off her hand and gave her a slap in the face. Then there was a strug- gle during which I succeeded in getting her into a chair and placing myself upon her lap, face downwards - and at right an- gles with her, and in that way holding her partially at bay. I don't pretend to say that I escaped unscathed. Science and right can not always succeed entirely against brute force. But I succeeded in keeping on her lap and holding her into the chair, even though she was raining blows upon the extremity of my spine with her shoe. She must have noticed how plucky I was in holding her in. to the chair and maintaining my place so earnestly. "There, have you got enough?" she asked, ceasing from her spanking for an instant. "Have you got enough, old woman? , If so, I'll allow you- to get up and go a-bout your business," said I. "Don't you sass me," she replied, again assaulting me. I soon saw that she a ore than a match for me in point   92     6Y MOTHER-IN-LAW. "of brute force and felt that I could not conquer her save by the exercise of my superior strategy. Have you got enough?" she asked again. "I'm satisfied if you are"I replied, bound not to admit that I was not fighting.  "' And will you behave yourself?" "Release me, woman.!" "Will you promise not to sass me again?" "Yes. I'll promise not to take advantage of my victory." "Well, let's see if you will," she said, allowing me to regain my feet, while I did the same for' her. "But if I ever hear any more of your sass I'll spank you harder than I have this time."  "UltE, I HAVE MADE YOU UP A COUPLE OF NICE SANDWICHES, mOSE OF THEM OF HAM AND THE OTHER CORNED BEEF, AND IT'S ATLL WUr NEED.

Superior brute strength had done it and I was forced to hold my tongue when in the house.  But the mighty were not yet fallen. What I lacked in muscle I made up in brains and cunning, and while nursing  my wrath to keep it warm I concentrated my genius upon a  plan o operations against her.  For a week we never exchanged words. But the old wo-   .l man kept right along about her business, getting things to rights and revolutionizing the entire interior workings of our household. In the matter of economy she was heavy. She said we could reduce our family expenses one half, and she would show us how to do it.                 '  The old gal might be a sort of a hard-times angel, after all,  I thougt, but I felt sure that I should never learn to tolerate her, even if she taught us how to live for nothing. I was still determined to be rid of her.      , I-was putting on my hat and coat one morning for the spur. pose of going to town to business when she approached me with something done up in a napkin.  "You spend altogether too much money for your luncheons.  You have a good breakfast, and supper and not having any. thing to do, you don't need much of anything for your lunch." "Oh, ah, indeed. Who told you so?"I asked. "I know what you men are. You'll spend a'dollar or two, for a dinner and never think how quick that money you squan- i . der foolishy would buy your wife a new silk dress. Economy is wealth, and I want to see you get rich." "Doubtless."  a Here I have made you up a couple of nice sandwiches, one ,              M'Y 3O1THR-IN-LAW.-   MY MOTHER-IN-LAW         29 - of them of ham and the other corned beef, and it's all you needc I'll place them right here in your coat pocket," she added, div. ing into the depths of my coat tail. "But : don't love sandwiches." All right I'll risk you.' You won't starve so long as you have such a lunch as that in your pocket. If you loved your- wife or your mother-in-law you'd love cold lunches and save your money."- "Oh, I do love my mother-in-law intensely," I replied, bit- terly, while drawing on my glove. "I can't help whether you love me or not, but don't let me , hear yer giving me any of yer sass, or I'll-" -^  "Old woman, if you ever lay hands on me ain I'll shoot, you in cold blood," said I, savagely interrupti'gher. , "Stop yer talking back in that way or I'll take you over my knee again." I shot one of my terrible glances at her, but I had no time then. to enter into another wrangle-I should miss the train, so I1 strode majestically from her presence. 'here were deep and dark -plots working under my hat as I journeyed towards the scene of my daily toil. How grand nd complete should be my great revenge at last!  When a man is thinking of his mother-in-law, he is apt to, forget most anything else. It was so with me on this occa- s ion. So completely did she fill my thoughts that I forgot the lunch of sandwiches which she had placed in my coat-taill pocket, and might not have remembered it even when I got hungry, had I not been reminded of it by a pack of' half-starved dogs who were following closely behind me. At first I did not know what the curs saw in- me that-- attracted their attention. I never fancied dogs much anyhow, /  but this crowd evidently took uncommon interest in me.."   30.        MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.          1 There were all kinds, degrees and bredds, but they all ap. peared to be nobody's dogs, and all very hungry. At length one more bold or more hungry than the rest, made a snap at my coat tail 'and I understood what the trouble was right away. I certainly might have passed for more of a philosopher if I had only thrown them the coveted lunch and thus got rid of both them and it, but I did nothing of the kind, I simply skipped, and the dogs simply ambled along after me at an easy gait, creating much excitement on the street as well as for me personally. "Hey, Bob," I heard on'e gamin shout, "Seethe cove as is a gadderin' up dogs for. a sassage mill. Hey!" "Twig his. nibs!" "Stop thief!" and various other complimentary remarks were passed upon me as I sped along. But I soon gained-the ferry and escaped from my pursuers, greatly to my delight you may well believe. Confound dogs, confound sandwiches; confound mothers-in-law. On board the fer-y boat I found myself in a crowd, and in trying to obtain standing room I forgot all about my trouble for the time being. I was crowded up in front of 'a very pretty girl, and you know how quickly one forgets home troubles under such circumstances. I suppose good looking young ladies travel on purpose to make poor afflicted men forget themselves. And they gener. ally succeed in making them do it. I feel certain that I should never have stood up under my afflictions had it not been for the pretty faces that smiled on me while going and returning to my abode. Well, I forgot all about 'my mother-in-law's lunch, and went to the restaurant as usual when I got hungry and was again made happy for less than a dollar. i           '    MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.         3X Man wants but little here below, But wants that little strong. As night approached I again wended my weary way homeward, or, rather, to the little kingdom where my mother-  in-law ruled. With my mind completely engrossed with the great ques- tions of the day, and watching which way a fascinating widow was going, I left the boat and started for the cars which were to take me within a few rods of my house. But those confounded dogs somehow got scent of me agai  and followed me to the cars. Of course I was safe then, al- 'N ADAM"SAM I, "THS IS ALL- YOUR WORK, YO-U PLACED TlA ONOND5ED LUNCH IN By COAT POCKET AND THESE DOGS HAVB BEEN FOLLOWXG      W     OD AN DAT, AD O ONTNT 00 T1  GETTING IT, T0    WIFM BY aOAT TABUSY T"Y HAVEN FO I LOWED MEH OME n zo-WAI't MYe flOAT TAiS Ti   2 MY OTHER-IN-LAW. though I was not aware of it any more than I was aware of their hang-dog presence. They had evidently made up their minds to have that savory lunch, and so they followed that car until I got out. I had gone hardly a dozen rods before they made a bold and determined attack upon. me. "I fought them off on one side and they came on the other; but, to curtail my story, they succeeded in tearing the, skirts of my coat entirely off, and in getting away with that lunch. The curs curtailed me. But they succeeded in doing so, only because they could run faster than I could. Even the securing of the sandwiches failed to satisfy them and they kept up the chase, as if anxious to see if the sandwiches were a sample of myself. iatt         "        l M!

She looked at me, at the pack of hungry dogs, and asked if I was going to take them to the pound to get the bounties. "Madam," said I, " this is all your work, you placed that confounded lunch in my coat pocket and these dogs have been oAllowing me around all day, and not content with getting it, together with my coat tails, they have followed me home." "Stuff and nonsense. It is only a weak invention of yours to dissuade me from my revolution in behalf of economy. But it will not succeed, sir," she said, stamping her big flat foot. "Harriet Ann shall have a new silk dress from what can be saved from your extravagant lunches. So, sir, drive off your miserable dogs, and remember who you are dealing with. "I can't drive them off," said I, shrugging my shoulders. ' I can, then. Git out!" and she made a dive for them. The dogs had evidently been waiting for some one to com. mence business, and when she attempted to kick one of them the cur grabbed her by the leg and began to pick the bone. She yelled and so did the dogs. I saw a chance for revenge and encouraged them on. "Sick em!"I yelled slapping my hands smartly. This had the desired effect and they all made -for her. -She fought for a moment and then turned and fled. Oh, it was such fun--for me and the dogs. I felt sure that they would kill her, and as my Wife was away on a visit, there was no witness at hand. I was about to be revenged! What a funeral I would give her. I laughed until I fell on the floor in a paroxysm of delight. I rolled in exuberant satisfaction. I tried to make an exclama. tion mark of myself by standing on my head, and for five rin-   YA MOTHER-/IN-LAW.

But while in the midst of it, while actually tottering on the top wave of my supposed felicity, I glanced up and beheld my mother-in-law looking in upon me! Here was a dramatic situation. Not a word was spoken by either of us during the tableau.. I could feel the change in the expression which came over my face. I slowly gathered myself up and she slowly entered the room, all the while regarding me with much the same look that a cat wears when satisfied that her prey cannot escape. But I was not afraid. If worst came to worst; if she at. tempted to use personal violence towards me, I would again TE-N  LB  ORN  I!UO   Z   MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. .3 HEOWEVEI, I MET MHR GAZE WITH A LOOK OF CALM INQUIRY, AND WHEN SHE GOT TO WITHN ABOUT TWO FEET -O ME SHE SUDDENLY DREW HER FIST AWAY FROM MY NOSE, AND I SAT DOWN -ON THE FLOOR. throw her into a chair and place myself at right angles with her person and hold her down. She approached me, still without speaking a word. The lightning in her body was well pent up and sent out no warning thunder. But I judged from her looks that she was  mad about something. However, I met her gaze with a look of calm inquiry, and when she got to within about two feet of me she suddenly drew her fist away from nose, and I sat down on the floor. But I should not have sat upon the floor if that had not been the nearest thing at hand to sit on. Had there been no ob- struction I might have sat down a rod or two away. Of course I felt hurt at her conduct, but she didn't appear to care. She stood ove I me with her arms akirbo, still re. o cr W-   36        MY MOTER-IN-LAW. garding me in silence. So of course I could say nothing, I wasn't going to open the battle by asking her what she meant by her conduct. But she soon found use for her tongue. "You are a nice man, arn't ychi? You sicked the dogs on me, didn't you?" Of course. What was the use of getting into an argument over a thing that was self evident? So I made no reply at alL If she had only mentioned some subject about which there was a question, then I might have joined her in the debate. But this is one of the mean ways about my mother-in-law. She always wants things her own way. "And- you were dancing, and laughing, and rolling your- self on the floor like a tickled hog, hoping I should be eaten up by your pack of hungry curs, wasn't you? But I wasn't, was I?" she said, again introducing a question which had only one side to it. "I am sorry they did not eat you up," I said. "You are, are you, you villain," she exclaimed, rushing upon me and raising her huge foot over my head as though about to crush me. I thought somebody had opened an old-fashioned umbrella over me, I got out from under it right away. It was quite evident that she didn't dare to step on me. She knew that that would be going a step too far, and that there was danger of rousing the lion within me. "You mean, despicable creature, you deserve more than the bloody nose I have given you." "Oh, that's all you can do; call names," I said, spitefully. "Oh, it is is it! Come with me," she exclaimed, seiz- ing me by the ear. She asked me to go along with her. and was strongly inclined to take my ear whether I went or not. So what 6   MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.        37 was I to do? But I wish it distinctly understood that I wouldn't have gone simply because she said so. I was too independent for that-I went to keep company with my ear, for fear it might be lonesome. "Come along, you  lily-livered apology, I'll-learn you what it is to set dogs on your wife's mother." "Be careful how you talk to me, madam, for it would not take much more to rouse the lion in me," said I, walking a trifle faster in order to keep up with and show that I was not afraid of her in the least. "Lion! Jackass more like," she sneered. "Ah, but even they have fangs behind. Be carefil, madam." "I'll be careful that you get what you deserve" she said, opening the door of the kitchen. X\                           I MY VIOLE E    THE PAST FW N   S    MY VIOLENT EXERCISE FOR THE PAST FEW M1NUTiIS HAD GIVEN ME A BAD HEADACHE, AND SHE EVIDENTLY KNEW IT AND WAS ONLY BENT ON CURING IT.   38        MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. Of course I followed her in. I wanted to show her that I was not afraid of her, and that I could go just as fast as she did, even if she was leaning on my ear for support. In the center of the kitchen floor stood a tub half full of water. She walked towards it. The idea suddenly oc- curred to me to give the old she-devil a ducking in it. It would only be serving her right. She still retained her hold upon my ear, evidently being afraid to let go. The time for action had arrived. Sum- moning all my strength I seized her by the neck and we struggled over that tub. She appeared to be afraid of fall- ing or being thrown, so she seized me by the hair of my head.  But the struggle was of short duration. I suddenly re- membered that when I had complained of having a head. ache she always told me that holding it under water was a sure cure. My violent exercise for the past few minutes had given me a bad headache and she evidently knew it and was only bent on curing it. So I made no further re-. sistance and allowed her to have her own way. I told her afterwards that she had no occasion to be so rough; that if she had only said that she wished to ex- periment upon my headache, I would have allowed her to do so. But the way she went to work about it, made it seem as though she was forcing me to try her cure. And the words she used after holding my head under the. water until I was nearly drowned were very rough and un- called for. "There, you good-for-notaing gander; you sorrel-headed monkey, now see if you will ever set dogs on me again." The language was entirely uncalled for. She was connect- ing it with another affair altogether than my headache. But what can you expect from a mother-in-law, anyway! She ev.

But I humored her for the sake of peace. There was a coldness between us for some days after that, in fact we did not speak at all. But one morning soon after- wards Harriet Ann informed me that her poor dear mother was sick, and unable to get up. I had not yet risen, but this an- aouncement nerved me. I visited: the chamber of that dear old lady and found her in bed, groaning with some kind of eolic. She seemed very low and wanted me to go right away to town for a doctor and I promised her I would. So after break- fast I set out, but I believe that this was the only time in my ife that I wished I lived ten miles from a doctor and was lama,   40         MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. I BOUGHT A CIGAR TO ASSIST MY MEDITATIONS Perhaps the old angel was about to be removed from her hearth. stone! Perhaps I was on the point of losing my mother-in-law! Perhaps if I did not hurry I should be too late! I bought a cigar to assist my meditations. It was while meditating upon such a great mishap that I passed a newspaper office and beheld a startling bulletin giving forth facts something like these: "Horrible Triagedy!"A mat kille his mother-in-law!" The jury acquit him "!"All about it!" Here was news of a very interesting nature surely. There was something about it that fascinated, charmed me.

So I went to a, saloon near by and ordered a drink. Tak- ing a seat at one of the tables I proceeded to 'brace up and read the account of that tragedy. But it wasn't so sensational after all. It was all about a man whose mother-in-law made his home so hot that he could not endure it, and he had set a trap or an infernal machine for her, in the shape of a bottle of !:4IP"    t   '" /f-%.   W0         JE M OTER.-IN-LAW.

And he had been acquitted by a jury of married men. The thing pleased me and I ordered another drink. Thea I meditated. Should my mother-in-law survive this attack could I not make a two hundred and forty pound angel of her in the same way? I placed my feet upon the table and folding my arms I was soon lost in the realms of imagination. From there I was swept into the open arms of Morpheus, and I dreamed-dreamed all kinds of dreams about murder, hanging, explosive bottles, and I know not what all, when I was suddenly and rudely awakc .

Then I saw the paper and remem- bered having come into the saloon to read it. Then the fact of my having started off after a doctor for my dear, sick mother-in-law came to my mind. How could 1 have been so careless as to have forgotten that important matter? I would attend to it at once. So I paid for my re-                F   "        AL MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.

I chanced to find him in and in the course of half an hour we started on foot for my house. -I should not have accom. panied him back, but I thought perhaps I might have to at- tend to the arrangements for the funeral, and so I concluded to forego the pleasure of regular business that day and pay strict attention to home matters. I was always a domestic man. I pass rapidly over a space of time at this point, for the good and sufficient reason that I do not distinctly remember all that occurred during the next few days.

I remember that she must have recovered rapidly after I left her in the morning, and also that she met us while on our way to the house, and that she had some words with me, etc.  The probability is that there was a severe personal encoun- ter between us. At all events I came to my senses some time afterwards and found myself in bed with a sad and bandaged  eye, together with other black and blue spots on different parts of my person; which led me to believe that I had either been fooling with a mule or that my-mother-in-law and I had had another personal understanding. Perhaps I had killed her. Was I in prison No, I was in my own chamber and everything looked natural with the  exception of myself. Where was she, I asked myself. Harriet Ann came in soon after, with a dish of gruel in her hand and tears in her eyes and on the end of her nose. She smiled sadly when she saw me, and informed me that I had been unconscious for three days.  I asked her what had happened me, and with tears starting   -- "'^a T:^'^ we'Ima'^  I2 ^ ^  'i^ ?^  ..   Ii e She inro A.,L ']Ir!edMe'WRDS-VTuI  WA- Cause Ihad s  Paaeo   ITaC.

I did not hear what my wife said, but I heard the old woman's reply very distinctly. "You tell him," said she, "that if I hear any more nonsense out of his head, that I will give him more than he has bar- gained for." Just as though I was not then having more than I had bar- gained for! That settled it. That sealed her doom. She actually de- fied me, defied me in my own house. Then I began to ponder over the situation. It was evi- dent that she cared nothing at allfor the many bodily chastise- ments I had given her. She seemed to be able to endure any amount of physical pain, and the only way to effectually rid myself of her, was to make her a subject for the coroner at one fell swoop. But'how should I do it, how bring about a consummation so devoutly wished for? I pondered on the subject long and- earnestly, I could hear her sharp voice every now and then coming up from below stairs if I needed any prick to the sides. of my intent, and I resolved. I had lately discovered that the old lady was partial to a. drop of whiskey now and then, and I made up my mind to see the man who had exploded his mother-in-law by some- concoction, and learn from him the secret, after which I would. proceed to put it in practice. The next day I was able to be out and attend to business If- people asked what ailed my eye, I told them I raan against a door in the dark. But I was soon myself again and my mother-in-law seemed to fear the result of her wrong-doing and kept pretty well out-   MY xOTM-nEg-IN-LAW.  i A 1e WE SAT DOWN TOGETHER IN THE SITTIm  BOOM, HARNESSED:  OURSELVES TO OUR PIPES MND tE TOLD E FUNNY STORIES FOR.

I hesitated a moment, but finally went; I thought there was no use in kicking up another row with her, for since corporal  punishment failed to reform her, I concluded that the easiest way was the best for the present. She followed me up stairs. This store-room was a sort of safe deposit, a room with a strong, burglar proof lock on the door, wherein we could deposit valuables which were not used every day. She opened the door and directed. me where to find the re. quired preserve cans. "I'm going to put up some preserves," said she. But I made no particular reply. I wasn't going to sa r her that I felt entirely satisfied with her conduct. ,V!1l       1 /jlji   / i ( i -A. :'t WILL I?

I pulled out a barrel, got on the top of it, in order that I might reach the shelf in question, when I suddenly found my-.  self in darkness and heard the strong lock click and the key ' removed. She had shut me in!                 I "Hullo!"I yelled, "what are you doing?"  Putting up preserves," I heard her say. "You old wretch, unlock that door."            X "Ha, ha!

I found myself wondering whether a jury would hold me blameless if I should blow her head off with a double-l  barreled shot-gun.                      i I In moving around my hand came upon a bottle.

I re. :solved to make amends for my shearing, Ind continued to sample from first one bottle and then another. I voted it a triumph over the situation.

But somehow it didn't last long. She broke away and gave me a whack which sent me to grass.

Like Tilton, I simply recall the picture, and it was as if I was the undermost dog in the fight, and she was seated upon Iny prostrate form, banging my nose upon the floor and at inter- vals fondling with my sparse auburn locks as though anxious to get enough of them to make a rag carpet. Since then I have taken no stock in Dutch courage. Since then I have bought no more whiskey for emergencies. I came then to the conclusion that the brain must be fed in order to compete with muscle. She had the advantage of me in brute force; I must brace up on my brain power in order to hold her in check. From that moment I commenced to study stratagem. I tried to find the man who had blown his mother-in-law into a full blown angel, but failing in this I commenced to study up- on explosives myself. I -became convinced that she loved a drop of the ardent herself, and on that ground I worked. I visited the Astor Library, and every other library that would afford me any information on the subject. From that - moment I resolved to scatter her mortal remains to the four, winds of the earth. - At last she had succeeded in rousing the lion within me. Ha! ha! Book after book, tome after tome I waded through, with all the devotion of an alchemist in search of the transmuting secret. Finally I found it. Ha! ha! The subtle agent of my wrath was discovered! My mind was -now made up, and no compunctious visit- ings of nature should shake my fell purpose, or keep pace be- tween the effect and it I had already learned my mother-in-law's weakness for gin, and other nervines, but especially gin, and on that hint I resolved to work.

I was very sober and thoughtful Fate was against me and Hhad better submit. One day Deacon Coldslaw called on me. He was a-man I hated above all other men in the world. He was a hypocrite.

In fact, he had never been known to do anything without some selfish motive; and I was bound to suspect him. Deacon Coldslaw was a widower forithe third time. Three winwPs had developed into angels under his dispensation, and he was now looking around for somebody to fill the void in his bosom and house, especially the house.     , I didn't suspect at first that this was his object.. I thought he was trying to find where he could bag the most on account of that new church steeple that he was chairman on. I am bound to suspect a homely man, especially if he is a deacon. The artist has reproduced Deacon Coldslaw from a photo; graph, and beyond saying that it is ai excellent likeness, it would-be -entirely superfluous to add a word. It is a speak- ing likeness and speaks for itself. So there is no occasion fot speaking about it. The deacon was a truly good man. Second to Deacon Richard Smith of Cincinnati. He was an eminently pious man. He was remarkable for the length and loudness of his. prayers. As a wrestler with the throne of grace he had few equals, and he could wrestle with only one eye shut. With the other he watched the effect on the sisteren and saw what. the boys back by the stove were doing. He was a great favorite with the sisters, for he never failed to take each by the hand and ask tenderly about how they felt. So when the deacon became a widower again he was trebly an object of interest in the church. Husbands were not very plenty and he had served the unmarried feminine portion of the church very well during the past twenty years, having reo   II r   M 9rY MOTI113;--N-LAW.--67 HB BOWlED VERY LOW AND POLITELY TO 1HE1, AND SHE WAS EI- *EINTLY BOTH PLEASED AND FLATTERED.

I hated him almost as much as I did my mother-in'law' e came twice to the house, pretending that he felt anxious regarding my health, before I " dropped " to his little game, before I com- prehended the depth and breadth of his charity and good will. On the occasion of his second visit I introduced him to my angelic mother-in-law. Then I saw where hisinterestlay. He was trying to get acquainted with her.

He bowed very low and politely to her, and she was evi- dently both pleased and flattered. He took her by the hand and hoped she was well. He held her hand while he con- versed about the weather, the crops, and made a tender allu. aion to the late Mrs. Deacon Coldslaw. Was it possible that he was actually taken with her? Was there about to be an opening out of which I could go and leave all my sorrow behind? I could scarcely believe it. Good luck had never been a friend of mine and I was hardly prepared to believe that anything of this kind was in store for me. I watched her while he held her hand, and actually saw her blush and look at the old rooster with a coy, maidenly tremor in her eyes. The old hen-! But it pleased me and I resolved to leave no stone un. turned to forward the thing. If she was willing I was determin. ed that he should be, if I had to give her a dower to lighten the mntrimonial bed. Such an opportunity for doing good and paying off an old score at the same time could not be lost. I had asked myself a hundred times how I could get square with Deacon Coldslaw, and here seemed to be an opportu- nity. I waited only a day before I made some excuse to call on the deacon, at his place of business, and as adroitly as I could I brought my mother-in-law into the conversation. I found that he A mas interested right away. Then I seized him by the buttonhole and poured warm and eloquent praises in his ear regarding that angelic woman. "She is a jewel, my dear sir. Why, I never knew what it was to live and enjoy housekeeping until she came to live with us. She is the angel of my household, barring, of course, her lovely daughter.

"I do, though. But why I should sound her praises to you, save in a general way, I don't know, except that you have seen her and canjudge for yourself," said I. "Oh certainly, I understand." Did he 2   @ - MY OTHER-IN-LA W. "Well- good day, Deacon. Come and see us often. My wife likes to have you call very much," said I, starting to go.' "Thank you, I shall do so." We parted. I seemed ten degrees nearer heaven. Be assured that I lost no time in interviewing mny dear mother-in-law. That very night I dawned upon her while she was sitting by the table. "I saw Deacon Coldslaw to-day," said I. *   "' Oh, did you?" she asked, looking up with some interest a Yes, and he sent his kindest regards to you." "Ah, did he " ^ Wished to be remembered kindly to you." i La!" said she, dropping her eyes in maidenly confusion. BE ASSURED THAT I LOST NO TIME IN iATEifiV1BWfKi1GG MY TRmAM ra-M-LA.

They had been talking about him, had they? ^    "And he has the reputation of being a very kind husband and a good provider." "I dare say." "And, by the way, you knew he was a widower?" "Yes, Harriet Ann told me so, and he said something about it I believe," said the coy creature, without looking up. "And he is looking for a wife I believe." "La me! ' You don't say so! How long has he been be weaved?" she asked, with a little sigh. "About a year I believe."    "i 'Poor man!" How tender and pathetic she Was getting! "I don't wish to say a word, but from the way he inquired after you I suspect that you have found favor in his eyes." "Oh, pshaw! How you do go on. You know he never thought about marrying me," said she, coquettishy. "I beg to differ, by believing that he saw your good qual. ities and took a fancy to them and you. Of course I spoke in the highest terms of you," said I, earnestly. "Did you? How kind. But you know I never had any idea of getting married at my time of life." Hadn't sle, though! ' At your time of life! Why you are a premium person- ification of ripened goodness. And you are not old. .Why, women nowadays are not fit to marry until they are forty."   MY MOTHER-IN-LAW. "Well, I sometimes think so myself. What does a green girl know of the responsibilities of a married life?" "To be sure. Do you know, I think no woman should get married until she is a widow?" "I perfectly agree with you," said she, without seeing the evident contradiction of my assertion. "So don't give yourself any uneasiness on that score. 'IThe deacon sees things in precisely the same light as I do." "Yes; but, la me! you are only joking. You are such a funny man!" "No, I was never so serious in my life.^ , - Well, marriage is a serious subject." "I agree with you." We parted that night with the most harmonious under. standing. She was evidently as much taken with the deawn as he was with her. If it could only be brought about; -if he would only mar ry her and take me off her hands-I would go on a three weeks' spree in commemoration of the event. The next day the deacon called before going to town to his business. He had a fine lot of turnip and lettuce plants; would I not like some of them? If I did, he would only be too happy to give me any number of them. I encouraged him. He shook hands cordially with the old woman, and talked for half an hour about the various kinds of turnip and lettuce. She seemed to know all about them. In fact, vegetation was her strongest hold. I left them alone, ate my breakfast, and at the end of an hour announced myself as ready to go to town. The deacon would accompany me. They parted slowly-the deacon and my mother-in-law. They somehow clung to each other's hands, and as they parted he was in a gay, almost ecstatic mood, and promised to come around early the next morning   ,  XY MOTHER-IN-LAW, . , ..

Yes, he was there bright and early the next morning, but she was up and dressed, looking her loveliest, ready to meet- him. And they set out turnip and lettuce plants. They lingered in the garden until our late breakfast" was announced and then they partook of it as daintily as two doves. What a mockery to square appetites which they both had I: And they both spoke of the work they had done, and what. good appetites it had given them. We went to town again together and the deacon was pro; *   v    7rE4      - MHMY ]t[OTHEIR-IN-LAWo fuse in his praise of my mother-in-law; said he had not met such a woman in years. I encouraged his hallucination. That evening he called again. . There appeared to be an understanding between them thus quick, and when she went to the front gate to meet him--it was just at dusk-they flew to each other's arms like two young lovers. I kept out of sight; I took Harriet Ann out for a walk and kept away for two hours. I know what company is, and what constitutes a crowd. I didn't wish to crowd the old lady and the deacon the least bit in-the world. I spoke of the deacon to my wife as being the finest man I ever knew. She looked up in my face and asked-what had changed my mind so suddenly. I told her I was always down ,on a man until I found out all about him; and she never suspected me. "Do you really think he wishes to marry mother?" she asked. "It looks very much like it. -He certainly would not trifle with the old lady's feelings." "Old! She is not so very old." "No, she's' very young in some of her ways." "But if he should marry her, how lonesome it would be at home. Don't you think so 2 " "Oh, dreadful lonesome. Hardly to be endured. But we must not interfere with the ways of Providence, you know, my dear." She sighed a little. "Yes, it will be dreadful lonesome. I shall miss her so mnuch, I can hardly bear to think about it." We returned home and found them going through a reg. ular old-fashioned courtship in the parlor. But we did not   KY MOTHIEB-IN-LA. %       76 disturb them  We went to bed and left them still at it, and I haven't the slightest idea when they disbanded.- It was prob- ably late I am sure of it, for the old lady slept late the next morn-. ing, and I went away without seeing how she looked. This was a rarity for me. But things progressed and began to come together. Luck appeared to be preparing a broad grin in my behalf. Night after night for a month the deacon came and courted. the old angel. She appeared to like it, or at least she took to it as naturally as a duck takes to water. And what a change came over her! She was always dressed .in her neatest and wore pink bows. She appeared to grow younger every day, and the little coquettish and maidenly ways she had were surprising. To me they were laughable, but I hardly dared to breathe for fear something might happen to break it all: up. So I "I '   kept a stiff upper lip, smiled all by myself, and hoped for the best. At last she confided to us that she was engaged to be married to Deacon Coldslaw. f My heart danced like a jumping- jack. When in town I drank health and prosperity to the deacon, and the toast that she might succeed in all her undertakings. Still I hardly dared trust myself to such expressions as my joyousness suggested. I had never in my whole life been lucky enough in warranting the belief that this would-not all end in a bottle of pop with the cork out,. Well at length the marriage day, the happy day, was fixed, and I began to take hope. She bothered herself no more about our domestic affairs, but seemed to be busied in her mia&'s eye with her own future ones.   76        WY MO'lTlfiR-IN-LAW. I could come and go when I liked anid no questions were asked. Happiness already dawned upon me. I bought a wedding dress for the old girl and did, all in amy power to forward matters. I would have mortgaged my house and my future prospects- rather than had the thing go back on me at that point. But there appeared to be no danger of it. The deacon was all attention and anxiety, and she certainly met him half way and enjoyed it. Gossip was busy with their names and when it was given out that they were soon to be married, the old ducks of the chuich held an indignation meeting and protested against the deacon's going outside of the fold where he had browsed so long in order to relieve his lonely condition. Several of the sisters had spread themselves on purpose to catch the old man. They had even attended the funeral of his last wife and sympathized with him, and bade him take hope, and to see him ignore their painful condition and go to a widow for consolation, and one outside of the church, was too much for human flesh to bear. But he heeded them not, and to put a stop to their objec. fions regarding' her being an outsider, he prevailed upon her to join the church just before they were to be married, and thus won his way into everybody's esteem save those old dried herrings who linger around churches for the purpose of seeing some wife die in hopes of an opening for themselves. That great and glorious day at last arrived. Hope which had dwelt with me so long was about to end in fruition. Unless something larger and louder than a soda cracker ex- ploded, I was on the eve of emancipation. The wedding was a grand affair. It was held in the ehurch, and the church could not hold all who came to wit-   MY MOTHEl-IN-LAW.   THE WEDDING WAS A GRAND AFFAIR. IT WAS HELD IN THB H TURCH, AND THE CHURCH COULD NOT HOLD ALL WHO CAME TO WIT- NESS IT. ness it. Hundreds were there who had known the deacon as a married man. At least a half dozen were there who had fondly hoped to be made Coldslaw themselves. They were there to criticise. They were there with gall and bitterness on their tongues. And there were three burnt-out i others-in-law there. The mothers of the deacon's other wive- still lived, and they were there in all the glory of weeds and snuff. They had a common interest in seeing what sort of a creature Mrs. Coldslaw No. 4 was. It was only natural, you know. When the groom marched up the aisle with his bride, every tongue was hung in the middle. What a fright she was I How old she was! How much better he could have done! The half dozen anxious and disappointed ones were the ,loudest in the latter remark.    , uv       yJr 1 -.I:1 jIIU jlYMO' -LERIN-LAW.. But the great majority commented after this fashion, "The deacon has sodded down three wives, but this one will have the pleasure of planting lettuce or something else on his grave." (  Well, it did look a trifle that way. But I was happy.: nevertheless. Harriet Ann and myself had seats of honor. In fact, I gave the bride away. I never gave anything away with so much pleasure in my life. I was reckless and was on the point of giving her away twice for fear she would not stay. The rector entered into the business with much heart. He had got somewhat used to marrying the deacon and it ap- peared to come easy to him. He had to take the book close tohis eyes, being -very near. sighted, but he did not fail in any particular. They were married! I certainly should have stood on my bald head had there been room for revolving. -I subscribed one hundred dollars on the spot towards putting a new steeple on the church. I felt like building a new church. After the ceremony was over the deacon's coach took them and ourselves to our house. I was anxious for them to go home. I wanted a 'fair chance to express myself. We indulged in a bottle of wine and said heaps of congrat- ulatory things, and finally they re-entered their coach and started homeward. Harriet Ann remained at the front gate watching them. She had thrown one of my old shoes after them and was watching them out of sight. But I was not. I retired to the house and began going through with all kinds of gymnastics and pantomime, indi cative of my delighted soul. I stood on my head. I yelled for joy. I skipped like a six-months-calf. I was never so' happy in all my life, and I actually hugged Harriet Ann and tried to stand her on her head in order to express my supreme delight. At last I was revenged on the deacon! At last I had got rid of my mother-in-law! Was ever man so blessed? Was ever man in such luck? The woman who had submitted to all my personal abuse, all my chastisements without flinching, the woman who esa caped explosion and all other death-traps, the woman who, '.                     . .     . *1     JUY MUTHA2R-i-NY-LAWo      aV ^bY alI,, ----.
