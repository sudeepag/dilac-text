                  BILL ARP'S   PEACE PAPERS. WITH ILLUSTRATIONS BY MATT   O'BRIAN, OF AUGUSTA, GEORGIA. NEW YORK:.  G. V. Carleton E& Co., Publishers. LONDON; . SLOW, SON & CO. M DOC, .T,4XxnT.   Entered according to Act of Congress,' in the year 1873, by W. CARLEToN & CO., In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at-Washington   DEDIKASHUN. To the unarm'd, unleg'd, uney'd, unpenshun'd, unwept, unhon- or'd and unsung soljiers of the Confedrit States, so. called, I dedicate this book. Their unaffekted, uncom- plainin patience in peace, so called, is equaled only by their untar- nish'd and unteryfide valor in war. When the patriotism and honor of our brave boys is rekognized by their northern brethren, so called; when they draw the same penshuns and reseeve the same bounty land; when evry dollar of back pay is voted in the bill, when the widders and orfins of our Confedrit dead are lifted up on the same platform of a Nashun's jestice; and when the peepul of these United States, so called, shake hands and make frends over the green graves of their heroes, then, and not till then, will there be shore enuf lasting and unpre. tended peace. That blessed time is cuming. Take courage and wait for it ye maimed, neglekted and pennyless boys; cheer up and hope for it ye widders and orfins of a noble band. May you all live till it hap pens if it takes a thousan years.       BILL ARP. P. S.--If it dont cum soon the compound interest on the back pay will brake the Guverment, and they know it. It's bound to cum.                       B. A.    CONTENTS. PAGE PREFASE ..............................

PREFASE. X T^^ ,     GENTEL  READUR:- One'day as I was goin along I heard a man gritin his teeth, and:I saw his eyes flash fire, and he slapd his fist in his hand, like poppin wagin whips, and he was' a tellin an- [The Author, writing "Peace Papers."] other man about a fite he had had. His upper lip was all in a trimble% and thebig vaines on his forrerd was swelled up like mackarony. He was powerful mad. Feelin- -an intrust in the like of 'that, I stopd and listend, and I looked all over him to see if there wasent   -12       PREFASE. blood or dirt,: or hair on his cloathes. Well, as I dident see eny, ses I, "Mister, when did all that happen'?"He pawsd-and shuttin one eye like he was a thinkin, ses he, "Well-its-now-been- nigh-onto-27 years ago." We aint that man. We hope nobody will pre- soom to think we carry our war heat that long. The fakt is, it aint the war that our peepul is mad about no how. Its this" confofinded, everlastin, abominabal 'peace-this tail to the comet-this rubbin the skab off before the sore gets well. The other day I seed a piece in a big. radicul paper from Saint Louis, about Genrul Long- street; sum feller had sed that the Genrul turnd trator at Gettysburg, (which was a lie), and the Saint Louis paper tuck it up, and sed that the time had cum when the honor and the patriotism of the Suthern soljiers should be defended with as much pride as if they had fout for the North. Now thats the tawk we like-thats a sine of shore enuf peace-; that man's head is level-only I think he's a little'premature in the fax.- It 'dont look like the time had cum, the way our northern ,   PREFASE.        13 brethren are doin us. They've sorter let us slip back into the Union, but they've put task-mas- ters over us, and sent carpet-baggers down to plunder us. They wont let us throw flowers on the graves of our poor boys who fell on their side of the fence. They wont give our invalid soljiers, or our widders and orfins any pensions. They taxd our cotton fifty milions of dollars, and their courts sed it was illegal, but they wont pay it- back. If they haint got laws strong enuf to keep what they stole,. they'l go to Washinton. and set and set and set till they hatch em. Now, if our soljiers' honor is as sakred as theirs, why dont they honor our dead? Why dont they penshun our cripples? Why dont they wipe the stain of treason from off our orfins? There's Gim - Wilkins who stood up like a-man in'186I, with a. heart in him as big as a meetin-house, and when in his new, soljier cloase he cum to a '"support arms," I thought he was as fine a pikter of an Amerikan patriot as I ever seed. But he lost a leg and an eye at Frederiksburg, and now here he is goin about hackd, "i;d poor, and ragged, o.   I    1- 4      ' PREFASE.   - and. the great Amerikan guverment sees him and skorns him, and so; " support yerself," you dirty booger. [See Frontispzece illustratlon.] Now, its useless and hipocritikal to cry pease, ) when there aint no pease. We may all mix and mingle, and trade, and joak, and carry on to- gether, but away down in our bowels'there is a burnin goin on, and if our northern brethrin dont do sumthin to put the fire out, it will break loose sum of these days, and play the' devil generully. I'm tawkin "futures" now, and my advice is for evry body to keep their " bonus" good. Now, it stands to reason that if this big family -. hav got to liv together, they cant liv in harmony while-the' strong men keepimposin on the weak ones. It stands to reesun that a guverment ort to sekure the love of all her subjeks. It stands to ' reesun that if a big furrin war cums along sum of these days, an enemy in: the rear will be more dangerous than an enemy in the. front. That's what we say, and the sooner foak's believe it the better.    . But there's no use tawkin. Nobody keers any-  ,           '. -..;,   PREFASE.        I 5 thing about us,- exseppin ourselves. Nobody aint got time. - The peepul would be all right if they wasent in such an everlastin hurry, and so they leave everything to the politishuns, and' the poli- tishuns is the devils agents, and that's what's the matter. To keep anoffis, they must hav votes  for the party, and so they manage to 'mix up the skum and filth of our sosiety with the- niggers, and back em up with carpet-baggers and sustain em with bayernets, and all- we can do is to stand  off and look on.' They dont keer no more' for our rights or our feelins, than a Sinsinnatty butcher  does about killin a hog. Never mind. These chickens will cumr home to roost sum of these days. I'll bet Grant a thousan dollars agin the best bull terryer dog he's got, that if he lives 25 years, he'l be set down in history as a reglar aksi- dental bust.. I'll bet there was ten thousan sol- jiers in the Yankee army who would have made a better fite, and a hundred thousan who would h av made a better president. -Darn a genrul, who, in - time of war, trades off three men for one. Hang a president who gives his guverment no carakter,   ' I6       PREFASE. who wont run the masheen, who smoaks around, a frolikin with hosses and dogs, and retailin old army joaks- in exchange for sickofantic smiles. A man told me he heard another man say that Gen- eral Grant axd old Butler to tell him when Queen - -Viktoria's term of offis would be out. He sed he dident know whether he had an idee of runnin agin her, or was only seekin informashun. But I dont know that its any of our business who is president. I suppoas its none of our fu  neral, only we do sorter feel, sumtimes, a- lingrin pride in the respektability of the American guv- erment. When furriners cums over here and is a lookin'^around for our King, we would like to show em sumthin better than a figger-head. But I wont rite any more prefase. It aint harmonius. I wouldent hav writ any, but I thought it was fair to giv evrybody warnin of what rollers in the sea- quell. If they was afeerd the dog might bite, it was fair to let em hear the tune of his bark first. The letters in this book wasent got up with any masheenry. They all jes cum along spontanyous, - without malis aforethought, and extends from the . ?   PREFASE.     - X  17 beginin of the war down to the present time. Spontanyous combustions are sed to be always exskusable, and if the sentiments which bubble up in this volume :dont soot sum foaks, they will be gratyfide to see what a fool a man can make of himself without tryin:. If a man dont like an- other man, its a cumfort to see him do that, and I've always thought it was a luvly trait in my carakter that I was disposed to gratify the w;ishes of all my Amerikan brethren-exsep sum. With these random remarks I Subscribe myself, Yours hopin, BILL ARP. / - '. - -  ,      -  ' ,. V1.. * '  e   ...*RoM% GA., A prile. 86. MR. LINKHORNSUR: Thse are to inform you that we are all well, and hope these lines may  'find you it statue ko. We received our prokla- , mation, 'and as you ,have put us on very short notis, a' 'few of us boys have conkluded to write you, and ax for a little more time.. The fact is, we are most obleeged to have a few more days, for' the Way things arehappening, it is utterly onpos- sible for us to disperse in twenty days. Old Vir- ' 11:: giny,'and Tennessee, and North Callina, are con- inv.'                  . n  tinually aggravatin us. into tumults and carouse- ments and a body an't disperse GA., Antil youput a stop to sich onrue all condukt on their prt. I trieds may yfindarndest yiste rday to disperse and eouire, butpr it was no go -; and besides, your mdrshav here ain short oing-the  darned thin g--he don't reisad the riotact nsible for us taenrnaout'to disperse in twenty days. Old Vir- giny, and Tennesserat e, and North Callina, are con- ,   -20   BILL ARP l0 ABE LINKHORN. turned out. If you conklude to do so, I am or- thorized to rekummend to you Col. Gibbons or Mr. McLung, who would attend to the bizness as. well as most anyboby. The fact is, the boys round here want watchin, or they'll take sumthin. A few, days ago I heard they surrounded two of our best citizens, because they was named Fort and Sumter. Most of em. are so hot that they fairly siz when you pour water on em, and thats the way they make up their mili- tary companies here now--when a man applies to jine the volunteers, they sprinkle him, and if he sizzes they take him, and if he don't they don't. Mr. Linkhorn, sur, privately speakin, I'm afeerd I'll git in a tite place here among these, bloods, and have to slope out of it, and I would -like to have your Skotch cap and kloak that you travelled in to Washington. I' suppose -you wouldn't be likely'to use the" same disgize agin, when you left, and therefore I would propose to swap. I am five feet five, and could git my plow breeches and coat to you in eight or ten days if you can wait thlat long. I want-you to write to me immegitly about things generally, and let us know wherebouts you intend to do your fitin. Your proklamation says somethin about takin possession of all the private property at i'All Hazards." We .can't find nor such place on the map. I thot it must be about -- Charleston, or Savannah, or Harper's Ferry, but they say it aint afnywhere down South. One man   BIaLL' ARP TO ABE LINKHORN.     21 said it was a little Faktory on an iland in Lake. Champlain, where they- make sand bags. My  [Testing the Volunteers.]      .  opinion is, that sand bag bisness won't pay, and it  is a great waste-of money, Our boys here carry    :   22   BILL ARP TO ABE LINkHORN. there sand in there gizzards, where it keeps better, and is always handy. 'I'm afeered your Gover- ment is givin you; and-your kangaroo a great deal of onnecessary trubbul, and my humble advice is, if. things don't work better soon, you'd better grease it, or trade the darned old thing off. .I'd show you a slite-of-hand trick that would change the whole concern into buttons quick. If you don't trade or do sumthin else with it soon, it will spile or die on your hands, sertain. Give my respekts to Bill Seward and the other members of the kangaroo.  What's Hannibal doin? I don't hear anything from him nowadays. Yours, with-care, BILL ARP. P. S.-If you can possibly xtend that'order to thirty days, do so. We have sent you a CHECK at Harper's Ferry (who keeps that darnd old ferry now? its giving us a heap of trubble), but if you positively won't xtend,:we'll send you a chek drawn by Jeff Davis, Borygard endorser, payable   on sight anywhere. -      Yours,   SECOND PAPER. TO MR. ABE LINKHORN.  a SENTERVILLE, Ginnerwerry 12, 1862. MR. LINKHORN, SUR: In the spring bf the year I writ you a- letter from my native' sile, axin for a litle more time to disperse. I told you then that twenty days was not enuf-that the thing could not be did in that brief interval. You can look back and see I was right. We tried our durndest thkomply with your skedule, but as you kept callin for vol- unteers, our Cherokee Georgia Democrats kept- comin out from under their clay roots. They shuk themselves and spit fire, and wouldn't go back as long as the Whigs would read em the news about  all this fuss. Mr. Abe Linkhorn, sur, the spring hav shed its fragrance, the summer is over and gone, the yaller leaves of autum hav kiveredthe ground; old winter is slobberin his froth on the yearth, but we hay not been able to disperse as yet. Me and the boys   24     TO MR. ABE LINKHORN. started last May to see you pussonally, and ax fer an xtension of your brief furlo, but we got on a bust in'old Virginny, about the 2Ist of Jewly, and like to hav got run over by a: passel of fellers run- nin from Bull Run to your city. Arter that we tried to git to you by the Potomak River, but Mr. Whiting said you were not ;runniin that Masheen at thesepresents. We next went.:.to Mr. Harper's -.  Ferry, to take the Baltimore Railrode, but we couldn't find the konductor, and kars seemed skase, and foaks sed you were not runnin that masheen much. We thought, however, to take a deck pas- sage on the kanal, butfan dam broke, and General Jackson sed you were not runnin that masheen skeersly any. After" that we cum back, and thought we would get captain Wilkes to ship us over, but Mr. Bennet sent us word that the captain had fuit a seafarin life. Mr. Seward made him quit to pacify an old English Bull that was bellerin about and pawin dirt iin the air. Mr. Linkhorn, sur, if that Bull is ofthe same stock as the one your foaks seed here in Jewly, he is a dangerous shore, and will have a bad effek on-your populashun. You had better surcumscribe hilnbefore -he hurts some- body. Mr. Linkhorn, sur,. what are your faktories doin -nowadays? I hearn you had quit runnin their masheens, owing to a thin crop of kotton.. If you would 'put sweet ile on your faktories, they wouldn't rust while standin idle. I was glad to  *  I                -   /  .  *  *  * ,  ,  , * - TO MR. ABE LINKHORr. 5. hear that you had got enuff kotton to do yours and Seward's families. The boys say you got  enuff to make as many shirts as Fallstaff had in his, kompany. Mr. Linkhorn, sur, how do you come on with your stone fleet-do- it pay xpenses -are it a safe investment-could I git any stok in it at any price? Don't you think it's most too fur to hawl rocks, and won't it impoverish New England sile to take the rocks offit?  - Mr. Albe Linkhorn, sur, the 8teenth is the anny- versary of the day when Gergy tore herself fran- tically loose from the aberlition dienasty--when she ' ripped her star from offen the striped rag, and spred a new piece of shirtin to the breeze. We kalkerlate to celebrate that day, and I am author- ized to invite you and Bill Seward over to purtake of our- hospitalities. Where' is Hamlin? I allow that he's ded, or I would ax him too. Let me know if you and Seward are kummin, so we can fix up and swap a lie or two with you ; couldn't you all kum along with Mack when he makes that ad- vance he has been talkin about so long? Bring your knittin when you kum, and, a clean shirt or two.  Do you chaw tobakker?  We have got some that is good. Ely chawed, and Mr. Davis give him a whole warehouse at Richmond. Mr. Linkhorn, sur, I wish you would ax Banks to send me a kodfish. Polekats. are bad aroun here, and we want somethin to drive em away. 2   --26 -  . TO MR.- ABE LINKHORN. If you 'bring Banks and Butler with you, you needn't bring the kod.   Yours till deth, o -       BILL ARP. P. S. -Where is Freemount? I hearn he has gone up a spout. & X d    THRD PAPER. ANOTHER LETTER FROM BILL ARP TO MR. "NKHORN. DECEMBER 2, iX86 MR. LINKHORN, SUR: A poet hav sed that "Time ontiedwait- eth for no man." To my opinyun it are ontied now and hastenen on to that eventful period which , you have fixed, when Africa is to be unshakled, when Niggerdom ar to feel the power of your proklamation, when Uncle Tom are to change his base and evakuate his kabin, when all the emblems of darkness are- to rush frantikally forth into the arms of their deliverers, and with perfumed and sented gratitude embrace your exsellency and Madam Harriet Beechers toe! What a galorious day that ar to be! What a sublime ery in history! What a proud kulmination and konstfmation and koruskation of your politikul hoaps! After a few thousand hav clasped you in their ebony arms, it f8          '         t.   -  s . ' f  . ' 28  ANOTHER LETTER PROMN -BILL ARP. -  'willbe ia fitten time, Mr. Linkhorn, for you to lay yourself down and die. Human ambition can hav no hier monument to klimb. After such a work you might komplete the immortal heroizm of your karacter by leapin from 'the topmost pinnakle of your glory upon the yearth below. But alas for human folly--alas for all subloonery things-our peepul will not believe, these krazy Rebels will not konsider I Christmas-is already cum - only one more breef weak to slide away before we' must part, forever part, with all our nigger heritige, and yet-our stubborn peepul continue to buy em and sell em, and the shorter the lease, the hier the price they are payin. What infatyashun! I verily be- lieve they will keep up their-old ways until next Wednesday night, just as tho they dident have to giv em all up the next mornin afore breakfast. Some say the stay law affecks the niggers and will operate to make em stay at home-some say you havent transportashun nor rashuns for four millions of darkeys--some say your call is premyture! but the majority are of the opinyun that a'little diffikulty you met at Frederiksburg hav interfeered with your rangements, and xtended the time like a siny die.               - - Mr. Linkhorn, sur, I forewarned you about krossin them sikly rivers.

Mr. Linkhorn, sur, when are this war to klose? How much longer kan you renew your note of ninety days which you said was time enuf to settle  this difficulty-do you pay the intrust? How much terrytory hav you subjugated-what makes kotton sell at 67 sents a poun .in your diggiris-is it not orful skase--what do your boney wimin do for -stuffin and paddin? I hearn they had to use hay and saw dust and sich like, and I thot it must be very painful to there tender buzums to hai to're- zort to sich a coars commodety! I would like to send you a bale, but Guvnor Brown would seeze it. It is sed by sum that the war are about to klose bekause of the Guvnor's late rade on-lether. - They say the war begun with a John Brown rade in Vir- ginny, and will end with a Joe Brown rade in 'Georgia. I allow not, for I think the Guvnor only tuk, that way of gittin the State ridcof its serplus, for he wanted to drive it into-the jinin States where things was more skaser. I would like to see you pussonally, Mr..Linkortn, and hlear you talk and tell sum of your funny antydotes, like you told Guvnor Morehead. I laffpd when I read em tell the teers fairly rained from my eyelids. I know I could make my fortune, Mr. Linkhorn, compilin your wit. Mayn't I be. your Boswell, and follow you about?

LINK- HORN. MR. LINKHORN, SUR : Are it not possible that you are usin too much proklamation. More than 8teen months ago you published an edik;orderin the boys to retire and be peasable, but they disretired and went to fightin. The effek war bad, very bad. Now you have proklimated the niggers free after Ginerwary, and I am afeerd it will prove a fee simple for all time. Every free nigger will git in the kotton patch now, shore; for the tarnal rebels do everything by kontrarys. Niggers hav ris twenty per cent, and are growin more darker and blacker every day. A big plantation now looks like the sun wer in eklips. Your proklamation hav entailed Afrika upon us so strong that you can aktually smell it. Tippio says (we call Tip for short,) that he is pus-   32  ANOTHER LETTER FiRQM BILL ARP. : '  sonally interested, and he thInks you had better make em free fust and ishoo your proklamation 7   afterwards. Genrul Hunter tried it yore way, and overcropped hisself. Tip got no free papers  :   at, all. :..: Mr. Linkhorn, sur, I am afeered you are takin in more ground than you can tend. You aretryin to do too much at onst. Genrul Hunter tried your plan and couldn't work it over three States, so you had better practise on homypathik doses. If you'll begin on Dade county you can tell what your masheen will do, as there is but one nigger there, and they keep him in a kage as a curiosity. If they won't aksept your' freedom, why, let em alone., Its useless to call em if they won't cum.

More than two hundred years ago,Genrul D. Soto had a big'fight with the Injins on or about these konsecrated-grounds.

But rollinyears will change a program! Anno domini will tell! Just afore the broke of day on Sunday, the third of May, I863, the sitizens of the Eternal Sity were roused from their slumbers by the korus of the Marsales him. "To' arms, to arms, ye brave; Abe Linkhorn are peggin .away; the  Yankees are ridin to. Rome on a raid." Ah! then were the time to try men's soles; but there were no panic, no skedaddlin, no shaken of kneeze; but one unyversal determinashun to do sumthin. The berryal squad organized fust and' foremost, and begun to inter their money, and spoons, and four pronged forks, and such like in small graves about the premises.' Babys were sent to the rear. Hosses hid in the kane brake. Cows milked onkommonly dry.  Kasheers and bank agents carried oph their funs in a pair of saddle bags, which very much xposed their fasilities and the small kompass of their resources. It were, how- ^': ever, a satisfaktory -solution of their refusin to dis- ," ' ' kount for the last 3 months. Skouts wer sent out on evry road: to snuff the tainted breze. Kotton ;:- bags were piled up akross evry highway and low '- way. Shot guns and kannon, powder and ball\, were brought to the front. The yomanry and millishy jined a squad of confederate troops, and formed in line of battle.

In fact, a man kould hear enything by gwine about, and more too. Shore 'enuff, however, the important krisis which was to hev arriv did- acktually arriv about ten- o'clock in the mornin, a. m., on May the 3rd, i863. I am thusly partikular, Mr. Editur, bekaus it are I to be entered on next year's almanax as a remark- abel event. The head of the rade did acktually arriv at the suberben viller of Mr. Myers, and ther , it stopped to rekonnoiter. There they larned that we had six hundred hed of artillery, and six thou- sin kotton bags, and a permiskuous number of infantry' taktix, and wer only waitin to see the whites of ther eyse. Also that the history of Gen- rul Jackson at New Orleans wer. read in publik, . and that everybody were inspired to do sumthin'; whereupon the hed of the rade turned pail, and sent forward a piket. At this -orspishus momenta a foot skout on our side let fly a whistlin bullit,   40    BATTLE OF ROME- OFFICIAL.  which- tuk effek somewher in them rejuns. It were resunably suposed that one Yankee were killed and perhaps- two, for even to this time : sumthin ded kan be smelt in them parts, though the berryal squad had not been able to find it up to a late hour yistiddy. After rite smart skum-  mishin the hed of the rade fell bak down the road to Alabam, and wer pursude by our mounted yonmanry at a respektabul distance. Now, Mistur Editur, while all these valyant feets wer goin on hereabouts, Genrul Forrest had  been fitin the boddy and tale of the rade away down at the Alabam line. Finally he proposed to the-rade to stop fitin, and play a game or two of poker, under a seder tree, which they acksepted. - But the Genrul wer not in luck, and' had a pore hand, and had bet his last dollar. The Yankees had a Strait, which wood havy taken Forrest and raked down the pile, but he looked em rite in the eyes and sed " he would see em and 4,00oo0 better." The Rade'looked at him, and he looked at the Rade and never blinked. -The Rade trimbled all over in his boots and giv- it up. The Genrul bluffed em, and ever sence that game were plade, the lit- tle town klose by have been kalled "Cedar Bluff." It were flush times in Alabam, that day, shore. Well, Mr. Editur, you kno the sekwel. The Genrul bagged em and brot em on. The planks were put bacE on the bridge.

One of the side wipin :kannon went off on its own hook, and the ball went ded throu a house and tore a buro all to flin- ders. Sum sed it wer a Niter Buro, but a potash man who xamined it sed he rekoned not. By and by the Kamanchy skouts and pikets all cum in, shuk their ambroshal loks and reseeved the klongratulashuns of there friends. Then begun the ovashun of fare wimmen and brave men. Bo-  kays and teers were mixed up permiskuous. Big hunks of cake and gratitude were distributed gen- rully and frekwent, strawherries and kream, egs and'inguns, pise and pan cakes, all flu round amazingly, for every body were determined to do sumthin. Genrul Forrest subsided, and Genrul Jubilee tuk kommand, and Rome were herself again.- The 4 pronged forks and silver spunes rose from the ded, and even the old hen that one of our sity aldermen had berried with her head out, wer disenterd and sakrifised immegitly for the good of the country. Thusly have ended the rade, and no loss on our  side. Howsomever, I spose that Mr. Linkhorn will keep peggin away. Yours truly and immensely. BILL ARP.

Wonder if Brown would let me go and fite awhile under the' confedersy? But then I would be in fur the war, and I don't like that. Durned if I know what to do--I'm still on the durnd old staff. Hanged if I kno whether I've got my commishun or my com- mishun has got me. Jim, I'm jist in old Scog- gins'es fix. Potash.-How's that, John?

He woke up about midnite, and his steers was gone, but the waggin was there. His brane was so fuddled that he didn't kno who he was, nor how he cum there ; so he thout over as well as he could, and finally says he: "s Am I John Scoggins, or am I not John Scoggins?

WITH sum few xseptions too tejus to mention, the Konfed hoss cavilry, whitch ever and anon and sumtimes more oftner migrates and varygates and preambulates thru and thru a poor, bleedin koun- try, are perhaps the most majestik site in the ani- mil kingdum.

Their bril- liant appearanse is too powerful for weak eyes to stand more than about seven days in a year. The Infantry and the Artillry are kalled the two arms of the servis, and do very well in their plases, but the hoss cavilry are the two legs-they are the in- gine of lokomoshun, the wheels of progress, and hense they can travil more better and retire more quiker, and okkupy a heap more ubikwity.

The slite and rapidity with whitch they purform their evolushuns are sed to be akkomplished by their pekuliar drill, which is kalled damin--they dam their eyes, and they dam-their ears, and they dam their guns, and their boots, and their mill saw spurs, and they dam their hosses to make em go faster, and they dam the fenses to make cum down, and they dam the poor farmer to make him dry up.

S/wappin hosses is a weakness to which they are subjek, but they give a man very little trubble that way, for they can swap with him when he ain't at home, or when he's asleep, just as well as if he was awake and was there.

When a big battle has been fout by the infantry, and the inimy is runnin, how majestik and sublime the cavilry appear, as, they foller up the skedaddlers. and holler "go it  bob tail, we're gainin on you."

No, Mr. Editur, sich senes never happened in Bill Shakspear's day, or he would not hav writ that line. I don't kno that the luvly inhabitants of your butiful sitty need any fourwarnins to make em avoid the breakers upon which our -vessel wer wreked; -but, for feer they should sum day shake their gory locks at me, I will make public a breef allusion to sum of the painful sirkumstances whitch lately okkurred in the eturnal sitty.   Not many days ago the everlastin Yankees (may thevylive always when the devil gets em) made a valyunt assault upon the sitty of the hills-the eternal sitty, where for a hundred years the Injun rivers have been blendin their' waters peesfully to- gether-where the Choktaw children built their. flutter mills and toyd with frogs and tadpoals whilst these magestik streems wer but litle branches a babblin along their sandy beds. For three days and nites our valyunt troops had beat back the fowl invader, and saved our pullits frum their devourin jaws. For three days and nites we bid farewell to evry feer, luksuriatin upon the tri- umf of our arms, and 'the sweet juices of straw-   BILLZ ARP, THE ROMAN RUNAGEE.,   67 berries and cream. For three days and nites fresh e  troops frum the South poured into our streets with showts that made the welkin ring, and the turky- bumps rise all over the flesh of our peeple. We felt that Rome wer safe-sekure against the as- saults of the world, the flesh and the devil, which last indivijual are supposed to be that hord of fowl invaders who are seekin to flank us -outen both bred and xistense. But alas for human hoaps! Man that is born of woman (and there is no other sort that I know of,) has but few days that is not full of trubble. Altho the troops did showt, altho their brass baind music swelled upon the gale, altho the turky bumps ris -as the welkin rung, altho the commandin Gen- rul asshoored us that Rome wer to be held at every hazerd, and that on to-morrer the big battle wer to be fout, and the fowl invaders hurled all howlin and bleedin to the shores of -the Ohio, yet it transpired sumhow that on choosdy night the mili- tery evakuashun of our sitty was preemptorly or- dered. No noat of warnin-no whisper of alarm, no hint of the morrter cum frum the muzzled lips of him who-had lifted our hoaps so high. Kalmly and koolly we'smoked our killykinik, and surveyed the embarkation -of troops, konstruin it to be sum 'grand menuver of militery-strategy.

BILL ARP RETURNS TO THE ETERNUL CITY. MR. EDITUR, SUR: I hav not up to this time made any re- marks in publik about the trials and tribulashuns, the losses and crosses, the buzzards and ded hosses seen on our jurny to the eternul sitty. I shall not ' alood to it now, only to remark that our comin bak wer not so hasty as our leavin. It wer in the ded of winter', thru snow and thru sleet, over kreeks without bridges and bridges without floors, thru a deserted- and. deserlate land wher no rooster was left to krow, no pig to squeel, no dog to bark, wher the-rooins of happy hoams adorned the way, and ghostly-chimniz stood up like Sherman's sentinels a gardin the rooins he had made.

The doors creeked welkum on their hinges, the hoppin bug chirrupd on the herth, and the whistlin wind was a singin the same old tune aroun the bedroom korner. We wer about as happy as we had been miserble, and when I remarkd that Genrul Vandiver, who okkupide our hous, musthe a gentleman for not burnin it, Mrs. Arp replide-- "I wonder what he done with my sewin ma- sheen "    ,  "He didn't cut down our shade trees," sed I. "My buro and karpet and crokery is all gone," sed she. "It may be possibul," sed I, "that the Gen-, ,  rul--" "And my barrel of soap," sed she. "It may be possibul," sed I, "that the Genrul . moved off our things to take kare of em for us. I rekon we'll git em all back atter while." "Atter while," sed Mrs. Arp like an echo, and ever, sinse then when I  alood to Our Northern brethrin, she only replies, " Atter while." By and by the skatterd wanderers begun to drop in one by one under the welkum shades of our sor- rerful sitty, It was a delightful enjoyment to greet em home, and listen to the history of their suffer- -  :  e                e  .'i   RETURNS TO THE ETERNUL CITY.         - ns and misfortins.

I was a standin one day on the banks of the Injun river a wonderin in my mind who would cum next, when I saw the shadder of a objekt a darkenin the sunlit bank. It warn't a load of hay nor a elefant, but it was my friend Big John a mdvin slowly doun to the dugout landin dn the other side. His big roun fase assoomed more lattytood when he saw me, and without waitin for remarks he sung out in a voise as deep as a well, "' There cum to the beech af-oor xile of Erin." "Call him fat," sed I, " and you'll fill the bill." Prouder to see him than a monky show, I paddled the dugout over in double quick, and bid him wel- kum in the name of the     .

So Bobby pitched in, with might and with maif, To slaughter this terrible Bruin; And he cut him and gashed him, again and again, And he foamed at the mouth like a man insane, And it seemed like a bull fight away off in Spamn, For his motto was "Rule or Ruin." But while they are fightin, 'tis easy to see The struggle will all be in vain. At least that's the way it seems to me, And a soldier remarked he would wager a V That Aleck, and Bobby, and Joseph, all three, And Rip Van Winkle, with whom they agree, Would fall in the fight and the verdict would be, . "They died of a bear on the brain."   MEDETASHUNS AMONG THE TOOMBS. I03 A POSTROFEE TO GEN. JOHNSTON. Hail, General, hail! the deuce is to pay, The devil has got in your rear, Just stack up your musket and listen, I pray, To the newspaper bullets a poppin away And fillin the people with fear. Send forward your flags and your banners of truce, Tell Sherman to hold on a while, Just tell him to wait, for the devil is loose, In the language of boys, cry " kings excuse," Your spurs lay aside and your sabre unloose, Till Bobby discharges his bile.

BILL ARP FILOSOFIZES ON THE WAR, ETC. MR. EDITUR,         FEBRUARY, 1865. SUR: If I could dizzern enything gloomy in the politikal horizun, I would keep it to myself and not go to puttin my long fase in the papers; but seein things as I see em, things ain't more distressin than usual.              Is My doktrin hav always bin that if we was to fite and fite and fite till our army was played out, the biggi part of the Yarinky job would be just begun. Atter they hav whipped us, then they hav to sub- jugate us. They hav got to hold us down, and they'can't do it. I used to hav a nabor, who was one of these meen, little, snarlin, fice dog si of men, and I had to whip him about onst a week for three months, but I didn't make a thing often him. He would rase a new fuss in a hour atter I had made him holler, and finally I sold him my   I rF   FILOSOFIZES ON THE WAR, ETC.   105 land and moved away just to git rid of him. Now the idee of the Yanks takin possesshun of so many towns and syttys, and so much terrytory, and holdin it and keepin so many people down, is non- sense, and it can't be did. Besides, we ain't whipped yet-not by three or four jug fulls. Spose Sherman did walk rite thru the State. Spose he did. Was eny body whipped? Didn't the rebellyun just klose rite up behind him, like shettin a pair of waful irons? He parted the at- mosphere as he went along, and it kollapsed agin in his, reer immegitly. He'll have-to go over that old ground sevrul times yet, and then sell out and move away. Well, they say that old Abe's Kongress-hav finaly and forever set all the niggers free, by mendin the Konstitution. How did that free em, or how did freein em mend the Konstitution? The darned old thing hav been broak for forty years, and it is broak yet; but spose they hav freed em, it's no more than old Abe done three or four times by his proklamashuns. What does 'it all amount to? I want to by a nigger, and I had jist as lief by a chunk of a free nigger as eny other. I don't keer a darn about his bein free, if I can subjergate him ; and if he gits above his natur, I'll put 39 whelks rite under his shirt, and make him wish that old Linkhorn stood in his shoes. But, Mr. Editur, sur, if we are; to be whipped at all, then the infantry, which are to say the web he      A .'   106  'FL OSOFZES ON THE WAR, ETC.  feet, are to be whipped fust. Atter that, the- cums the tug of war. Whippin the cavilry will be theldevilishest ondertakin of this or eny preseedin  konflikt. I tell you, sur, they can't be whipped ' till they are kaut,- and that event will never trans- pire. The truth is, that the Konfederit cavilry cab fite on, and dog elr, and dodge em, and bush- w  ack em, and bedevil em for a thousan years, and that is as long as the most sangwinery hav kal- kulated this war to last. The Konfederit cavilry is ubikuitous and everlastin. I hav traveld a heep of late, and had okkashun to retire into sum v sequestered rejuns, but nary hill nor holler, nary vale or vally, nary mounting gorge or inaksessibel  raveen hav I found, but what the cavilry had bin there, andjest left. And that is the reeson they can't be whipped, for they hav always jest left, and took a odd hoss or two with em. For four years the konfederit hoss-stealin cavilry hav bin pirootin aroun, preparin themselves for the friteful struggel that are. -to cum. By dodgin aroun they have kompleted their inspekshun of stock, and tride all its bottum,'and now it are reesunable to spose they are reddy to fite. The fakt is, Mr.  Editur, steelin -froi our side is most playd out, and I feel ashoored our enemies will suffer very soon. Sich a krisis is, I rekon, a blessin to the kountry, for when we hav -lost all our property, there .wont be nuthin to rekonstrukt, and we.. will all go to fitin. Property. in sich a time    FILOSOFIZES ON THE WAR, ETC.  107 are the bane of libberty. Old Blivins remarkd, that if -we all had bin as poor as him when the war begun, and had held our own, the Viik- tory would have bin won long ago,  "How poor are you, Blevins?" sed I. "Jest 4 years ago," sed he, ' I was even with the world, which are to say that I owed about as many as I didn't, owe, and had nuthin to boot, and that is the fix I want the Konfedersy to git in." We are that way in these parts, Mr. Editur, shore. What the Yanks didn't git in six months kontinuous plunderin, was brot out to enjoy when they left. Suddinly sum frendly skouts appeerd upon the arena, and made a genrul grab. Every- thing visibul was appropriated without pay or sere- mony. Our indignant sitizens appeeled for pro- tekshun, and his xcellency the Guvnur sent up a kumpny as the avenger of our /rongs, and the protektur of our lives and--property. The-Majer and his gallant boys appreshiated our kause, and in order to prevent a rekurrense of sich robberyss by, the wanderin skouts, stole all the ballance them- selves and then run away. Sich is war, Mr. Ed- itur, but nevertheless, notwithstandin, I am for it as long as possibul, and longer if necessary. We are now tryin the melish-the Georgy me- lish-luxuriatin under their benine and peesible rule. Slandered as they hav bin from the mount- ings to the sea, they are now the gardeens of our sleepin libberties. Like a wall of fire they environ !    ,'          1i, as.   108  -FIL OSOFIZESO ON'THE WAR, ETC. . the outposts of Cherokee Georgy, and we will stan by em as long as-they stan by us. Let their slanderers beware, and rekollek the fate of Ike Jphnsing, that old vetran from the Virginny army. Ike was at home on a bustin furlo, and he rode up to the melish and pulling out his repeeter, xklaimed, " lay down, melisk, l'm gwine to bust this cap."

For sum sevrul weeks I have been wantin to'say sumthin. For sum sev- rul years we Rebs, so called, but now late of said kountry deceased, hav been a tryin mity hard to do sumthin. We didn't quite do it, and now it is very paneful, I ashoor you, to dry up all of a sud- den,-and make out like we wasn't there. My frend, I want to say sumthin. I spose there is no law agin thinkin, but thinkin don't help me. It don't let down my thermomyter. Imust xplode myself genrully so as to feel better. You see I am tryin to harmonise. I'm tryin to soften down my feelins. I'm endeverin to subjergate myself to   I IO BILL ARP ADDRESSES ARTEMUS WARD. the level of surroundin sirkumstances, so called. But I can't do it till I am allowed to say sumthin. I want to quarrel with sumboddy and then make frends. I ain't no giant killer. I ain't no Norwe- gun bar. I ain't no Bo Konstrikter, but I'll be hornswoggled if the talkin, and the writin, -and the slanderin hav got to be all done on one side eny longer. Sum of your foaks hav got to dry up or -turn our foaks loose. It's a blamed outrage, so called. -'t your editers got nuthin else to do but to peck at us, skwib at us, and krow over us? Is evry man what can write a paragraf to konsider us as bars in a lge, and be always a jobbin at us to hear us growl? Now you see, my frend, that's what's disharmonyus, and do you- jest tell em, one and all, E Pluribus Unum, so called, that if they don't stop it at onst, or turn us loose to say what we please, why we Rebs, so called, hav unani- mously, and jintly, and sevrully resolved to-to- to-think very'hard of it-if not harder. That's the way to talk it. I ain't a gwine to kommit myself. I know when to put on the. brakes. I ain't a gwine to say all I think. Nary time. No, sur. But I'll jest tell you, Artemus, and you may tell it to your show! If we ain't allowed to xpress our sentiments, we can take it out ill hatin; and hatin runs hevy in my family, shore.

But talkin the way I see it, a big feller and a little feller, so called, got into a fite, and they fout, and fout, and fout a long time, and evry boddy all around a hollerin hands off, but kep a helpin the big feller, till finally the little feller caved in and hollered enuf. He made a bully fite, I tell you, selah. Well, what did the big feller do? Take him-by the han and help him up, and bresh the dirt often his close? Nary time! No, sur? But he kiked him atter he was down, and throwd mud on him, and drug him about and rubbed sand in his eyes, and now he's a gwine about a huntin up his poor little property.- Wants to konfiskate it, so called. Blame my jacket if it ain't enuf to make your hed swim. But I'm a good Union man, so called. I ain't a gwine to fite any more, I shan't vote for the next war. I ain't no gurilla. I've dun tuk the oath, and I'm gwine to keep it, but as for my bein subjer- gated, and humilyated, and amalgamated, and enervated, as Mr. Chase says, it ain't so--nary time. I ain't ashamed of nuthin, neather-ain't repentin--ain't axin for no one hoss, short-winded pardin. Nobody needn't be a playin preest about me. I ain't got no twenty thousan dollars.

They shouldn't eat roots and drink branch water no longer. Poor unfortinate things? To cum into this subloonery world at sich a time. There's Bull Run Arp, and Harper's Ferry Arp, and Chickahominy Arp, that never seed the pikturs in a spellin book. I tell you, my frend, we are the poorest peepul on the face of the yearth-but we are poor and proud. We made a bully fite, selah, and the whole Amerikan nation ought to feel proud of it. It shows what Amerikans can- do when they think they are imposed on-"' so called." Didn't our four fathers fite, bleed; and die about a little tax on tea, when not one in-a thousan drunk it? Becaus they sukseeded, wasn't it glory? But if they hadn't, I spose it would hav been treeson, and they would have been a bowin and scrapin around King George for pardin. So it goes, Arte- mus, and to my mind, if the whole thing was stewed down it would make about -a haf pint of humbug.  We had-good men, grate men, kristyun men, who thot we was right, and many of them hav gone to the undiskivered kountry, and hav got a pardin'as is a pardin. When I die I am mighty willin to risk myself under the shadder of their wings, whether the klimate is hot or cold. So mote it be. Selah! Well, maybe I've sed enuf. But I don't feel esy yet.

We had killed foaks and killed foaks until the novilty of the thing had - wore off, and we were mity nigh played out all over. Childern was increasin and vitels dimin- ishin. By a close kalculashun it was perseeved that we didn't kill our enemies as fast as they was imported, and about those times I thought it wer a pitty that sum mirakel of grace hadn't cut off the breed of furriners sum eighteen or twenty years ago. Then you would have seen a fare fite. Genrul Sherman wouldn't hav walked over the ^trak, and Ulyses would hav killed more men than he did--of his own side. I hav always thought that a Genrul ought to be perticler which side he was sacrifisin. Well, if the war is over, what's the,use of fillin up our towns and sittys with soljers any longer? Where's the libberty and freedum?   The fakt is, Genrul {Sherman and his katterpillers made such a clean sweep of evrything, that I don't see much to rekonstruk. 4 They took so many libbertys aroun here that there's nary libberty left. I could' hav rekonstrukted a thousan sich Statesi before this. Any body could.  There wasn't nothin to do but jest to- go off and let us alone. We've plenty of Statesmen-plenty of men for Guvnor.

Everybody's tired of the war, and we don't want to see any more signs of it. The niggers don't want em, and the white men don't want em, and as for- the wimmen-whoopee! I golly! Well, there's jest no use talkin-when the stars fall again, maybe the wimmun will be har- monised. That mail bisness-that oath about git- tin-letters! They always wasjelous about the males anyhow, and that order jest broak the cami's back. Well, I must confess that it was' a powerful small consern. I would try to sorter smooth it over if I knowed what to say, but I don't. If they was afeerd of the wimmin why didn't they say so? If they wasn't, what do they make em swear for? Jest to, aggravate em? Didn't they know that the best way to harmonise a man was to harmonise his wife fust? What harm can the women do by re- seevin their letters oath free? They can't vote, nor they can't preech, nor hold offis, nor play sol- jer, nor muster, nor wear britches, nor ride strad- dle, nor cus, nor chaw tobakker, nor do nuthin hardly but talk and rite letters. I heern that a valyunt Colonel made a woman put up her fan bekaus it had a pikter -of Borygard on it. Well, she's harmonised, I rekun.

Until Mr. Johnson sorter took up for us, you never sent a sheet to Rome that didn't hurt our feelins and bore into our harts like a kotton gimlet. You coppid from Yankee papers the meanest-of their slander, and it seemed to be perfekly kongenyal with your sentiments. Well, sur, we bore it like a Injun. We, bore it silently and proud. We looked at our desolatid land, our loansum chimniz, our grave yards, where you unburrid our ded, and sunk your rifel pits; where you broak to fragments the iron ralin, and took our tombstones to put in your fortyfications. You pitched your tents right over the ground *  \ 8   TO THSE  CHATTANO GY GAZE T.  125 wher our lovd ones were restin in hallowd peese, and beat your tatoo and revella, and sung your- rude songs with devilish merryment right over the hoams of our ded, where we had planted the fair- est flowers to sweeten their sad graves.

RESPECTABLE PEEPUL: I address you on this okashun with a profound admiration for the great konsideration which kaused you to honor me by your votes, with a seet in the Senit of Georgy. For two momentus and inspirin weeks, the Legislater have been in solem sesshun, one of whom I am' proud to be which. For sevral days we were engaged as skouts, makin a sorter of reconysance to see -whether Gorgy were a State or a Ingin terrytory; whether we were in the old Union or out of it; whether me and my foaks, and you and your foaks wer sumbody or nobody; and lastly, but by no means leastly, whether our poor innersent childern, born durin the war, wer all illegal, and had to be born over agin or not.' This last pint are much unsettled, but our wimmen are advised to be cam and serene. My friends, our aim has onestly been to git you all back into the Union.

They know we've got nuthin, for they eat up our sub- stanse, and as for puttin rings on our fingers, we couldn't xpect it til they bring back the jewelry they karried away. I can't say in the language of the poit, that our laber has beeni a laber of luv, for we've had monstrus poor enkouragement, to be -shore; but we had all set our heds 'towerds the stars and stripes, and we jointly determined that, cum wool or wo, sink or swim, survive or perish, thunder or litenin, we'd slip back, or sneak back, or git back sumhow, or we'd stay out for ever and ever,. and be hanged to em, so called, until there was anew deal of the cards.

He seems to be doin his best, but then thar is Sumner, and Satan, and Stevens, and Davis, and other like gentlemen, who keep a hollerin at him, and crackin his whip, and konfusin his idees, so that sometimes we don't know whether he's geein or hawin. My frends, about them fellers I don't know what I ort to say. If you do, or anybody do, I wish they would say it. I don't enkourage kussin in nobody ; not at all; but if you know of a man that cant be broak of it durin hiss natral life, it mout be well to hire him by the year.

Them Western boys fout us for the Union, but didn't care for the nigger. By double teamin they lickd us, and'we gin it up, but now the one don't want our niggers and the other don't want our Union, and its the hardest skedule to pleas em both that. 6*   I30  ADDRESSES HS FELLER CITIZES N. ever a poor vankwisht peepul undertook. It's the hardestwar to wind up that histry'rekords. Sum- ner, Satan and company are still a fussin and fumin about the everlastin nigger-want him to vote, and -make laws, and set on a jury, and wants to per- hibit us rebels from doin the same thing for thirty years to cum! Jerusalum! Where is the cussin man? They say it's all right for a nigger not to vote in Konneticut, bekaus there ain't but a few of em thar; and it's all rong for em riot to vote in Georgy, bekaus there's a heap of em here, and they talk logik and retorik amazin to show how it is. Well, I hain't got a whole pasul of sense like sum; but as shore as I am two foot high, a nigger is a nigger, I don't care where you smell him, and a vote, is a vote I don't care where you vote it. I golly, they can't git over that. The truth is, my feller sitizens, I sumtimes feel like we didn't have no Guverment. I felt that way sorter when Mr. Gibson appinted me a com- mittee on the state of the Republik. When the Sekretary red out my name all mixed up with the republik, I felt that I was obleeged to resine. Risin majestically to my;feet, says I, "Mr. Presi- dent, I beg to be respektfully xcused, sur, if you pleas. If there's any Republik on this side of Jor- dan I can't perseeve it at this time with these speks. There was a place in Old Virginny, called Port Republik, but Stonewall Jackson wiped out its kontents genrully in I863, and I hav not. sinse a ,   ADDRESSES HS FELLER CITIZENS.   131 heerd of it in Northern literature.

I spose, sur, it is to be mooved to Bosting or the infernal rejuns in a few days, and I don't want nothin to do with it. Xkuse me, sur, but I must insist on being respektably discharged." I took- my seat amidst the most profoundest and tumultuous silence, and Mr. Gibson remarked that he wouldn't impose the Republik on no respectabul man agin his wishes.- He then transferrd me to the finanse kommitty, and said he hoped we would take immegiate action, for the State had no munny, as well as himself, and board was high, and et sete- ras frekwent.

Fourthwith i telegraft varyus gentlemen for a tem- porary lone, but they wouldn't lend a dollar until Mr. Jinkins wer inorgorated, for they wanted his name to the note. Think, says I to myself, there's a tap lost about this waggin. If we are a State we can borry mfinny in Augusty. If we aitht a State, it's none of our bisness to borry any at all. If Andy wants. to run the masheen his own way, let him pay his own xpenses. What in the dickens is a provisional guvernment for if -it ain't to git up provisions and provide for a feller genrully?

He wants us backabout as bad as we want to git back, and a little badder, perhaps, and he needn't put on so many unnessary airs about the Senator bisness. If he fools with us much, we won't elect nobody. I fourthwith returned to the capital, and stretchinl fourth one of my arms, says I, "Mr. Gibson --sur--I'm your frend --I'm the frend of your wife anid childern, but if Mr. Jlankins ain't inorgurated soon the and was karried tumultu State will kollapse.

For the last few years you have traveld roun rite smart, and must hav made a heep of loominus, observashuns.

I have always endevord to. see 'the brite sides of evry pikter, if it had eny, but there is one or two subjeks about which I have mighty nigh giv up. I want you to tell me if you can, about what   ZBILL ARP TO HS OLD FRIEND.   1 $35 time are the black republicans a goin to quit per- sekutin our peepul? What are they:so everlastin mad with sus about? Old skewhall says its- for treason, and that I am the slowest persevin man he ever seed not to hav found it out. Now tresun is a mighty bad thing, and eny man found gilty of treason ort to be talked to by a preecher right under a gallers, and then be allowed to stand on nuthin for few hours by the clock. Shore enuf treson I mean. Treson where a man slips aroun on the sly in time of war, and takes sides agin his kountry. Jest as though, for in- stanse, I should hav worked agin my suvrin State atter she'd seseded, and had stole her powder or had deserted her in her time of perril, while she wa /a defendin herself against the kombined assalts -of the world, the flesh and the devil. I wouldn't hav blamed nobody for hangin me for the like, would you? But skewhall says we ain't got no suvrin Spates-that the war hav settled the question., agin us on that pint. I don't think so, my frend. I admit that we ain't nuthin in pertikler now, but we 4id hEav suvrin' States afore the war, and the sword ain't settled nor unsettled no great principles. There ain't no trial of right or wrong by wager of battel now-a-days. For mighty nigh a hundred years this kountry hav bin a big debatin sosiety on these questions. From the time of Hamilton and Jefferson down to I861, the right of a State to dissolv her own partnership hav bin :   136  BILL ARP TO tHS OLD FRIEND. argud by powerful minded men, and there hav bin more for it than agin it. More Presidents, more - Senators, more statesmen, more judges, more peepul. Massachusetts and Conneticut was for it at one time, and bellerd aroun and pawd dirt amazin to git out, but they found out that Barcus was willun and they didn't go. I believe, however, that old Nutmeg did stay out about two hours and a half. Well, the South went out mity unwillinly, Mr. Happy, as you know.  She had bin mity nigh kicked out for a long time, and there was a big party that wanted us to git out and stay out.. Evrybody knows we didn't git along in pese, so we konkluded to do like Abraham and Lot-to seperate our households.. What they wanted to keep us for I never could see, and can't see yet. I wouldn't hav a nigger or a dbg to stay about me that didn't want to. Sum say they wanted us to strengthen em agin their enemies--in case of a furrin war. Does eny man in his senses xpect us to. help the Black Republicans whip enybody? Hav we got eny wurse' enemies than they are? They can't -:- , make us fite, I rekon, if we don't want to. We've fout enuf, and made nuthin by it but glory, and we ain't a goin to jine in another war to gratify other peepul. Dodd says before he would pull a trigger for Thad Stevens, he'd hav his soul trans- migrated to a bench-leggd fice, and bark at his 'daddy's mules 2000 years. I wunder if the xpe- ,   BILL ARP TO HS OLD FRIEND.   137 ryence of the last four years ain't satisfide them fellers that our boys are a dangerus set to be turned luse in time of war. Wouldn't you think that as a ma ter of polisy they would soft sodder us a little and quit their slanderin? But I want you to tell me, John, if I am right about the histry of this bisness. It ain't a long story, and I'll tell it the way I see it. Old Pewrytan, went off one day with sum ships and took a few beeds and juse harps and bought up a lot of kaptured niggers from the Hottentotts, or sum other totts, and stole a few more on the kost of Afriky and brought em over, and edykated em to wurk in the field, and cut wood, and skeer bars, and so forth, but not inkluding votin, nor mus- terin, nor jury bisness, nor so forth. Well, atter while they found that the cold winds and kodfish airs of New England didn't agree with nigger, and so they begun to slide em down South as fast as possible. Atter they had sold em and got the munny, they jind the church and bekum: sanktifide 'about slavery, sorter like the woman that got konverted and then giv all her novels away .to her onkonverted sister. Well, the Old Dominion, and sich of her sons as Washinton, and Jefferson, and Madison, and Randolph bought em and workd em to satisfakshun; whereupon Old Pew got jelus and begun to preecli agin it to break it down. Atter while they went into the striped almanak bisness, makin bloddy pikters of poor las-     serated niggers a gittin a hundred lashes for nuthin, and mournin for their fust born bekaus they was not. -Then they started the stealin pro- gram, and while we was a tryin all the big courts and little courts to git back one sikly melatter, by the name of 'Dred Skott, they was a stealin from five to fifty a day, and kuverin their karkasses over with nigger larseny, and a smuglin the konstitution into an abolishun mush. They bilt a fense-aroun the institution as high as Haman's gallus, and hemd it in, and layd sege to it jest like a army would besege a sitty to starve out the inhabitants. They kep a peggin away at us ontil we got mad- shore enuf mad-and we resolved to cut loose from em and paddle our own kanoo. Now at this time we had sum good frends among em-sum who swore we was imposed on, and sed we had good caus to dissolv'partnership. They sed that' if we did seseed, and the abolishunists made war on us, they would stand by us and throw their lives, and fortins, and sacred oners right into the breech, and the fuss would be over their dead boddies, and so on. My memry is bad, but I remember that sum of em was named James Buchanan, and Dan Dickinson, and John Cochran, and Logan, and Cushin,. and Butler, surnamed the Beest, and McLernard, and Stephen A.

But a man ain't responsibul for the bad kondukt of his rela- shuns, and I dont throw it up to nobody. I spose that our President are a doin the best he -can, and Mr. Ethridge oughtent to be a takin up his rekord. Well, the war cum on, and shore enuf, Logan, and Cushin, and McLernard, and Butler, and kom- pany, buzzed about awhile like bumble bees, till they was bought up and then they lit over on tdther side. They got their reward and they are welkum to it as far as I am konserned. How is it now, Mr. Happy? They conkered us by the sword, but they havent konvinced us of nuthin much that I know of. WAll is lost save onor, and that they can't steal from us nor tarnish. If they had held out the hand of fellership, we would hav made frends and burid the hatchit. But the very minit they whipped us, they begun to holler treson, from one end of the country to the other, jest like they had made a bran new diskov- ery. It seemed to strike em all of a sudden like xpost fakto law, and they wanted to go into a genrul hangin bisness, and keep it up as long as they could find rope and timber. Now, the idee of sevral millyuns of Amerikan freemen bein gilty of treson at onst!

But, we can't satisfy them Radikals, I don't keer what we do. We elekted Mr. Stevens and Hershel Jonsin to the Senit, and they are mad about that. They wanted Josh Hill and Jeems Jonsin bekaus they was Union. Well, now, Mr. Cox, its better always to tak sum' men who hav done sumthin than men who hav done nuthin.

That's what's the matter, Joshua! if I may be allowed to postrofise you; you didn't take no side at all. You say you can take the -oath and git in. Well, I don't see how xactly. You run for Guvner in sixty three, and you writ a letter agin rekonstrukshun, and kompard, the old Union to a porcelane vase that was broak, and couldn't never be mended agin-no, never. Well, we didn't elekt him, Mri Cox, and the devil may cum. In the langwage of Pat Henry, "Let him cum"--I repeat it, sur, " let him cum. There was ahother kandydate, Mr. Cox, whose name was Jeems Johnson. Well, I like Jeems purty well. He didn't run nobody down, nor put on airs. I mite have voted for him, if he had lived in the State, and I hadn't liked Hershel better. The Truth is, I was parshal to Jeems for his "old lang syne." He was a powerful war h oss in sixty one. How galorious he figured at *  the Columbus war meetin. He enkouraged the boys amazin, and he beet enybody gittin volun- teers. How proud we was of him that nite, when he and Col.

Howsumever, it don't-matter much, I rekon, for we've got another Johnsin, and they-are a high roostin family, shore. Now you understand the trubble about this elekshun. We was a huntin for the two full blooded Union men, who could find their way to Washinton. and bak without a way-bill, and we couldn't find em. They ain't in the State, I tell you.

It's as natral to hate em as it is to kill a snake. It's utterly onpossibul for me to tell the hight and depth and bredth of their con- tempt for that party.

"That's suffishent, sur," says old Boutwell. "Ef it was in their power to do so, would your peepul renew the fite?" - "Not onless they could fite the Radikals all alone, and all the world agree ' hands off.' Even then there wouldn't be no fite, for we couldn't ketch you." "What do tall your peepul say upon the subjek of nigger ekwality?" "They say its a lie, sur-it don't xist by natur, and never can in practise. Foals were not created free and equel. That may be a theoretikal truth, but it's always been .a praktikal lie.

"What makes President Johnson so poplar in the South?" "Contrast, sur, contrast. The more he ain't like 'your 'party, the more popular he is. He would treat us about right, I rekon, if you would let him alone, but you bedevil him so that sum- times he don't onderstand himself.

"Do ,you think, Mr. Arp, that if the South should ever hold the ballance of power, they would demand pay for their niggers?" ".I can't say, sur, but Hdon't think the South has lost anything that way. We got their laber before the war for their vittles and close and dok- tors bills, and we git it now for about the same. It's all settled down that way, and your Buro couldn't help it.

A gen- rul is a mity high up man. His ears are away up yonder like a church steeple, and we poor devils aint got any ladder. Red tape mite finally reech him sum three munths atter the thing happened, but there aint much kumfort in that. The charges would be "Respectfully referred" about fourteen , times, and/a few red ink marks skattered around by the A. A. A. A. Genruls, until they finally git back to the akkused, who indorses" not troo," or sumthin equivalent, and sends it back again,-and that's the end of it.   '   I66 -BILL ARP ON THE ROME BURO. Well, there it is. If a satrap wants a few bao- nets to pint around and skeer foaks with, he sets down and rites about this way : "Gen'i, I hav. de much honor to report you grand outrage perpe- trate in dese ceety.

No. 2.   ROME, January, I868. MR. EDITUR :-Clubs is still trumps. The Buro has turned up Jack, and playd the duse, and the feer is, he still holds the ase in hand. 'Can't you do nothin? I'm afrade you've lost your influence. The sirkus hav been here and throwd the Buro into eklips for a while; but Dan hav gone now, and the Buro is a showin as usual, to the white foaks for nuthin, and the niggers for half price. It's a good show, if ther was no other side but the funny side-no other performer but the klown; but then there's a Proprietor, and a Ring Master with a whip, and we poor hosses hav to streek it like the devil was atter us. It 'pears that sinse I rote you last, sumbody hav been reportin sum of these funny proceedins to the Genrul, and the Genrul ordered an investigashun. The way it was done up here reminds me of old John Dobbs, J. P.   BI L ARP ON THE ROME BURO.   69 He was a good feller,' John was, but he had ways of his own. 'A feller was sued in his kourt on forty 30 dollar notes. Old Dobbs allowed Under- wood to. speek for two hours, and to reed sum two hundred pages of law, more or less, in defendin the case.' Atter he got thru he wiped the swet off his fase and set down, and wated an hour or so for old Dobbs to say suthin. But Dobbs made no sine- went on with his dokit. Finally, says Underwo9d, "may it please your Honer, I've got a good pese to ride, and its a growin late,. and I would like to hear your Honer's desisshun." "Oh yes," says Dobbs: "Well:, I can tellyou, Mr. Underwood, I judgmenticated them cases afore I left home. :!j Bogin, you can adjurn the kourt. I beleeve she are about thru." If the Buro hav got the ase, Mr. Editur, the fun and fewry will be amazin. Dan Kastello and "Wo Janyary," won't be a sircumstance to his moshuns. I rekon you never seed him on a fillibustero---a  gettin atter a feller that sum darkey had reported. He goes forth feersly, frantically, quixotically, like a troo nite, and he cums back with a sort of a veni vidi .vsi look all over him-that is to say, unless he strikes a sawyer, and gits snagged. Sumtimes he don't dig-a-nose well, as the'Doktors say. He jumped out of his buggy the other dfay, in front of a big, ruff lookin farmer's gate, bounsed j   up and down a few times, a tryin to lite, an, says he, "Tornton, I came to see Mr. Tornton-vat 8  -a        170  BILL- ARP ON THE ROME BURO. name you?"  "Thornton is my name, sur." "Vare veil; vat for you no pay madam Jospheetn, de freetman, you hav? Answer me queek; vat for you no pay heem?" "Bekause I dident hav tha money, sir-that's all." "How much yous ayyou owe heem?" "Nine dollars, sir." "No sare; no sare; you owe heem forty doller. It is not so, no time. You make try to swindle heem, but I makes you-." The rest of the sentense has never been finished, Mr. Editur. "Tornton" took the Buro by the throte, backd him up agin the house, opened a big jack knife with his teeth, and was about to play Othello on him; -but the Buro surrendered jest mi time. "Pardon, senor mousarp, Mr. Tornton, it ish nine dollar. Oh, mine Got! Sacre Dios! Pardon! It ish nine dollare. You no understanny me-I no mean- Sacre Dios -Prdon! Mr. Tornton, it ish only nine dollare, sure. Oh, sare, no killy me." Mr. Editur, you've seed a fish worm bate with the hook in him? Well, you understand. Mr. "Tornton" relented, and took the hook out, and the Buro is to this day aboundin in- gratitood. He says the "' negare ish von lyin husse, and Mr. Tornton one ver fine man-no man so fine in de county all." But the new isshu, Mr. Editur, is a funny one. I don't allood to Konfederit money. The Buro stands charged with imbibin corn juse to xcess while he wer on a resent filibustero,in Chattoogy county. The Buro says " he vas no intoxicate-   BILL ARP ON THE ROM E BURO.

Did the like ever happen to you, Mr. Editur, and if it did, did you eat the whisky or-drink the lunch, and what was the effekt of the medisin? But to throw sum lite on this particuler case, I will proseed to giv you the substanse of the Buro's speach at a nigger barbyku, near Rome, on the last 4th of July. The eloquence of it'was grand, glumy, and pekulyer. Cullert Peepuls-I ish von American-hoopee -take off yer hats-I shay take off yer hats. "Tree sheer for de flag.

About 20 minits of sich stuff settled his hash, and the Rev. Mr. Turner, of your konvenshun,   i72  BILL ARP ON THE ROME BURO. was allowed to proseed to the releef of all kon- sernd. As this took plase before lunch time, can you akkount for it on filosdfical prinsipels? For the rest of the eloquent Buro's remarks you can call on your feller citizen, the Rev. Mr. Turner, cullud, who was to be the orator of the day, but cum mity nigh bein Burode off the stand. Yours, still a hopin, BILL ARP. P.

If he can be cured of judgmenti- catin his cases before he hears the white side of em, I think we could git along.

EDITUR : I'm sorry I can't fill my promise to call on you. I'm-a goin home, I am. I'm tired of this everlastin fuss. There's sum devilment up, and I'm jubus about it. I've heer d lots of war talk in the Legislatur to-day. There's sines of fite. I didn't think 9 dollars a day would provoke such hostyle language. One feller sed they was jist a rarin and a chargin for their constituents, and that it was all 9 dollar gas, buteit didn't smell like gas to me. The day I got here there wus shootin all about, and a man killed. Then agin I see the members and the outsiders dividin up in little skwads about at nite, and whisperin, and jugglin, and piroutin aroun. They are plottin agin sum- body, I know. I heerd one feller say '"' prolonga- shun," and another said "hell,' and another "dam," and I heard jaw teeth grit. I was a privit in Corputs Battery, and I knowd what a prolong is. It's a big hemp rope with hooks on the ends what hitches the kannon to the powder box. There's a going to be shootin, sertin, and sum-   I74   BILL ARP VISITS A TLANTA. body's goin to be hurt, and I want Captain Corput to onderstand that I've resind. 'A man in the gallery was powerful mad with sum-editur. Maybe it was you. I don't know, but he ax'd a man whether he should whip the editur or not. The man sed he didn't know and couldn't say, for he hadn't red the piese, but as a general thing, in the abstrakt, it was right to whip em. Ef I was you I would karry-a weepin of some sort, even if it were only a umbrell. I got tired of all this, and walked over to White- hall for peace. A frend (I spose he was a frend) foynd me, and sed he wanted to see me pertiklerly. He took me away back and hawled out sum little thumb papers full of figgers, and sed he wanted me to insure my life. That skeerd me. wus than anything, for it danger, and he hed just found it out. I, axd him if he thought there would be a fite. He xplaind things to me, and I felt re- o leeved, and deklined to insure for the presy ent. You see I fet I mity well, and couldn't see the necessity. At the next korner I met another frend, who seemed ;   BILL ARP VISITS A TLAbANTA  - I 5  glad to see me xseedinly. He held my hand in his sum sevrul moments. He axd me if my life was insured. He sed he was agent for the very best cumpany in the wurld. I axd him how long a man would liv under his cumpany. He then xplaned to me that a man mite die at any time; that they didn't ondertake to keep a man from dying. So I deklined, but xpressed my gratitood for his interest in my welfare, and promised to'- buy a polisy as soon as I got rite sick. Jest as I left him I heerd him call some feller a dam phool. When I got to the hotel there was a feller a waitin for me on the same bisness.- He talked to me for a hour on the onsertainty of life and the sertainty of deth. I thought perhaps he was a misshunary. He seemed much consernd about my wife and children, and onst or twist wiped his eyes with a white pokithankerchef. I knowd he was a frend, and told him I would reflekt seryusly about the matter. I beleeve that that cumpany is a purely' filan- thropik'institushun, and swould lend a poor feller a few dollars if he was a. sufferin. I think I will try to borry a little from their agents to-morrow. This mornin the first one cum to see me agin and I konkluded I was lookin mity bad, and axd him to xkuse me, as I was not feelin well. I went to Dr. Alexander and got a dose of salts. He axd me if I was sick. I told him I stosed I was and the reeson why. He then told me all about it,   I76   BILL ARP VISITS ATLANTA.' and sed there was about IOO of them fellers in town, and they all had orgers, and they bored about half a inch at the fust interview, and an inch at the sekond in the same hole, and so on til they got to the holler, and the pashent giv in and took a policy. I don't know about that, but I will say they are the frendlyest, most sympathisin and kind harted men I hav ever struck! only I don't like so much talk about coffins and graveyards. I didn't take the salts.           f But, Mr. Editur, I tell you there is trubble a brewin. I saw old Rock and Genrul Gordon, and Col. Styles a talkin together, and old Tige wasn't fur off. Old Rock's grey beerd was a waggin ominously, and old Gordon's skars was a jumpin about all over his fase, Styles looked like he wanted to e at sumbody. I heerd him say sumthin about "Orgean stables." I spose that is where he keeps his war hosses. Scott cum up and sed, sumthin about the " reer gard." He's the devil on "reer gard," and the army knows it. Jim Waddell dropped in and remarked that he had "jest as leeve die as live if old Rock sed so." At this moment a feller cum along a singin. "I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel like a mornin star," ' The whole party looked like Gettysburg, and old Tige was jest a waiting for old Rock to tree. I tell you, Mr. Editur, there's trubble a bruin. Says I, "Mr. Mackworter, you are speeker, you   BILL ARP VISITS ATLANTA.    " know it all from the steepul to the cellar. You hav capacity, and sagacity, and vivasity, and rapasity and the like--do you think there will be a fite?"                    i ' "Yes, sur," says he. "Yes, sur: they will fite, shore. They are obliged to fite. Old Bony- part can't get out of it, and Bismark has got a-chin just like Jo Johnson. France wants a bloodlettin like we had-" "Is it that fur off.?" says I. "I thought it was to begin in Atlanty to-nite." "Oh, no," says he, and went on. I got some cumfort from my old frend, Ben. Thornton. He sed that if they did git up a fite the old soljers wouldn't be into it much, xcept the Genruls, for that the original consistent Union men, like Josh Hill, and Dunning, and Tom Saf- fold, and Judge Wright, and Akermari would make short work of it. He sed they was mity slow men to git mad, and it had taken em about ten years to git to the bilin pint, but that sich fitin as they would do now the world, nor the flesh, nor the devil never saw. He sed one would whip, a thousan, and two put ten thousan to flite. I hope so. I like a man what takes ten years to git mad. Yours truly, BILL ARP. -8*    \   TWENTY-SEVENTH PAPER. BILL ARP ON NIGGER EQUALITY. MR. EDITUR :-Of course I take it as a goak for you to ax for my views on polytix, but never- theless notwithstandin I won't be more backward than other peepul about tawkin. If I tawk like a fool it's consolin to know that it's a common complaint. Pollytix is a fateegin subjek and has got to be as monotonus as a one tune hand orgin. Before the war it had it's ups. and downs, and ockasion- ally, was quite varygated and pekulyer. Now-a- days it's settled down into two principuls which is to plunder the goverment and umble the South. We've sorter got used to the first, for it's dun with a knife that cuts both ways, but the other makes a new sore evry time, and nocks the skab off the old one before it gits well. I don't know xactly what them radikals think about the nigger. I supposed they was jest a fool- in him to git votes enuf to elekt, and then would   BILL ARP ON NIGGER EQUALITY.   I79 be satisfide and let him relaps into his nativ ob- skurity. I supposed that when Yewlisses got in for the sekund'term he would let the -nigger slide and try to make friends with the white foaks. I thought, maybe, he had sense enuf to want the re- spek or the pity of them peepul that licked him in evry fair fite, and that he would like to go down to posterity in as decent a way as possibul, consider- in that if the country had to hav a fool for a presi- dent he couldn't help it. I thought it was a good sign when he tawked about cumin down South and mixin with our peepul, and I dident say a word when the Makon papurs said they would be glad to see him. I knowed it was a lie at the time, but it was lyin for peace and mout be exkused under the sirkumstances. My opinyun is that Grant got in a quanderry and dident know what to do. One set told him to cum and see us and git frendly, and the other set, backd up by some slick tungd Yan- ky preechers, told him he must stand by the nigger -that he must have em put on jewries, and make postmasters of em, and so fourth; and that if he cum downh-lere sum heathen rebel would shoot at him for amusement, and so he got skeered and con- cluded to stay at home. Now ain't it a beautiful spektakle to see a man behavin himself so badly that he's afeared to travil through the country that he rules over. I'll bet King William can walk in- into evry corner of his kingdom without a guard, and hear evry subjek say "God bless you" as he   180 .BILL ARP ON NIGGER EQUALITY. goes along. But Mr. Grant couldent cum, and the nigger must be elevated soshially, and he makes em postmasters, and puts em on jewries. Noqw this nigger bisness is a sore that I thought would be al- lowed to cure up sum time. I don't want to speak disrespekful of Mr. Grant nor myself, but I'm obleeged to think that either him or me is a fool. He beleeves in nigger equality and I don't-that is to say, he beleeves a nigger is as good as a South- ern man, tho not quite so good as a Yank. He won't shampoo in a nigger barber shop, but we must. - He wouldn't swet by a nigger in a jewry box, but we shall. He wouldn't set by em in a car, or a' hotel, or a meetin house, but we've got to. That's the law, and that old pewrytan lie has been ding-dongd into him until he caved in. He ain't got sense enuf to argu the question. He sees sum smart niggers like Fred Douglass, and 'sum' fool white men like that Congressman who re- funded his back pay, and he gives it up. He can see a difference in the breed of hosses and pups but not of foaks. Now I've seen a blooded pinter that would suk eggs, and I've seen a nigger's houn that wouldent, but that don't prove that houns is equal to pinters. There's as much difference in races of peepul as in dogs, or cats, or chickens, or bears, or sheep, or hosses, or elefants. One kind was made better at -the start than another, and mixin em makes em worse instead of better. It's agin natur.. A mu- ,   BILL ARP ON NIGGER EQUALITY.    8i  latter runs out like a mule. He don't run out so suddenly, but he runs out shore. I've watchd em all my life; and they keep degeneratin till they play out entirely. Jest so you may try to cross a game chicken with a shanghi, or a Newfoundland dog with a bull terrier, and the froot is a failure. If you want to improve any kind of animals you must cross em, with their own breed. Evry animal has its natur and its fitness the world over. That's the law, as Judge Hammond used to say, and we can't ' change it, and mankind ain't no exception to it. There is an aristokrisy all over creashun in man, and beasts, and birds, and fishes, and vegetables, and trees, and minerals. There is a better kind and a worse kind of evrything, and evry kind is in- tended for sum partikler thing. The nigger wasent made to keep a post offis nor set on a jewry. He wasent made for intelektual persoots. He was made to dig, and ditch, and grub, and hoe, and plow a mule, and tote things about for white foaks, and nothin else don't soot him, and that don't soot him as well as doin nothin. I hav no idee that he ever sprung from a white man, nor the bible don't say so, the way I see it. There's the heathen Chinee, and the Injun, and the nigger, and the Eskimo, and the Jew, and the European, and, maybe, some - others that was all different at the beginning, and as the good book says their name was called Adam. : They was given orders what to do, and what not to  do, and then left alone, and the devil was a -hang- -:   I82  BILL ARP ON NIGGER EQUALITY. in aroun like a hyena and he coaxed em over to his side and took charge of em. My opinyun is, that these different peepuls was put in different parts of the earth when they was created, and a separate lot of animals, and birds, and fishes, and froots, and flowers, was put with em to soot the peepul and the country. Injuns was planted in Amerika, and the Eskimo way up north in the ice and the snow, and the nigger in Afriky, and the heathen Chinee in Asia, and the Jews in and about Jerusalem. Them last was hard cases. They had the best chance and made the worst use of it, and they got washed away in a freshet, and had o6 take a new start. Neednt tell me that that freshet kiv- ered the whole earth, for if it did, how did the In- juns, and the lions, and tigers, and the wild hosses, and deer, and bears, and wolves, and the like, get over here after the flood was over? How cums it that evry country- has its own sort of beasts and birds, and if you move em from their natral home they play out in one generashun. Needent tell me that all peepul had the same parent. I ain't obieeged to believe it, and I don't. I heerd a preecher say onst that all- the languages was purty much alike, and must hav cum froni the same one. Well, spose they are? They ain't as much alike as the howl of a dog is like the howl of a wolf, or a cat bird's song like a mockin bird's, and they never cum -from the same parent. But akkordin to my thinkin there ain't much like-   BILL ARP O0 NrGGER EQUALITY.   183 ness between our talk and that of a Injun or a heethen Chinee. Itneverheard of a peepul changin their faces, nor theirhair nor their size, nor their cullo.. Animals won't do it, nor birds, nor baboons. You can improve em, and refine em, but that's all. A blak Alabama nigger is jest the same as his great gran daddy was in Afriky two thousan years ago. He's got sivilized and behaves sorter decent, but it's bekaus he lived with white foaks, and is obleegedto. If you turn him loos on an iland by himself, he'll relaps into a vagabon in ten years. He'd quit wearin close and go to beatin tin'pans and eat lizzards before you git out of site. Shore as- you are. born them niggers ain't no kin to us, and they ain't no more fittin for jewries and post offises than a monky is for a meetin house. But I ain't agin the nigger. I like him. I'm his frend, and I want him kept jest where he belongs. I don't want them radikals to be foolin him about his own natur, and puttin fool ideas in his hed. It's a mity strong sirkumstanshal evidence that a President or a Judge who tolerates it is a knave or a fool, and probably both, and if they don't like this sorter taWk they can lump it, and be durned to em. What's a nigger ever dun for the world or hisself. They've been livin free in Massa-, chusetts for a hundred-years, and goin to free skools, and mixin with white foaks. Did they ever invent a steembote, or a telegraf, or a cotton   - 84  BILL ARP ON NIGGER EQUALITY. gin, or a sowin masheen? My daddy ownd em for fifty years, and they barely larned to make a hoe handle. They don't do any better since their freedom. The highest enjoyment of the biggest half of em is to shout in a meetin house all Sat- urdy night, and go to a funeral on Sunday, and be a steelin sumthin all the ballans of the week. Of course there's a heap of good niggers that behaves like white foaks, but them sort is the xseption. I'm alludin to em as a race of peepul. The gails and the graveyards are catchin em every day. They were made to be kontrolled by white foaks, and taken care of, jest like we control our childern. They are nuthin but ignorant childern all their lives. They never do git grown up in brains or behavyour, and it's God's blessin to em to hav to liv under sumbody's dominyun. Them Yanks find it out mity quick when they move down here and go into business. They would do em worse than they do them poor faktory gals in Yanky land if they was allowed to. Slavry for the white foaks and freeadum for the nigger runs mity well together now-a-days. Sunset Cox knows how it is, and he told em of it in his big speech in New York, but they don't keer as long as they can make munny there and bedevil us here. I wunder how much longer it will take to satisfy em. I would hav thought that eight years-develment and oppression and insult would hav satisfide the devil hisself, or any other radikal. It's lukky for em they haint   BILL ARP ON NIGGER EQUALITEY.   185 got into a war with sum furriners. I tell you, sur, they are sleepin over fire and brimstone and don't know it. Butiful guvernment they giv us in South Kallina and Louisany, arid the other States, ain't it? Nigger votes and radikal meanness does it. These niggers hav been free for eight years and didn't hav sense enuf to vote for their best frend at the last elektion-the man that hadobeen workin for their freedom for forty years. But it ain't no use in tawkin or writin. It don't do any good as I see, only it sorter lets off the bile and makes a man feel better. As long as a man can speak his mind freely he ain't dangerus. He won't-shoot nobody. So I will now close more cam and sereen. Yours trooly, BILL ARP.   TWENTY-EIGHTH PAPER. BILL ARP ADDRESSES THE LEBANON LAW. SCHOOL, AND GIVES HS OWN SAD EXPERIENCE. MR. KUMMUNS AND ET AL-GENTLEMEN: I hav reseved your kind invitashun to address -your Law school. In the situashun in which I am situated, it is onpossible for me to go. I wish I could, for I would like totell you all I know about law bisiness myself, at this place. We are engaged in manufakturin it by holesale, and atter while it will be retaled out by the lawyers to any body that wants it. It's an esy bisiness to make law, but the greatest diffikulty is in onderstandin it atter it is made.  Among the lawyers this difficulty don't' seam to lie so much in the hed as in the poket. For five dollars a lawyer can luminise sum, and more akkordin to pay. But he ortent to luminise but one side at a time. The fust case I ever had in a Justice Court I emploid old Bob Leggins, who was a sorter of a self-eddicated fool. I giv him two dollars in advanse, and he argud the case, as I thot, on two sides, and was more luminus agin me  .        /   ADDRESSES THE LEBANON LAW SCHOOL. 187 than for me. I lost the case, and found out atter- wards that the defendant had employed Leggins atter I did, and gin him five dollars to lose my case. I look upon this as a warnin to all klients to pay big fees and keep your lawyer out of temta- shun. My xperience in litigashun hav not been satis- faktory. I sued Sugar Black onst for the price of a lode of shuks. He sed he wanted to buy sum ruffness, and I agreed to bring him a lode of shuks for two dollers. My waggin got broke and he got tired a waitin, and sent out atter the shuks him- self.' When I called on him for the pay, he seemed surprised, and sed it had cost him two dollars and a half to hav the shuks hauld, -and that I justly owd him a half a dollar. He were more bigger than I was, so I swallerd my bile and sued him. His lawyer pled a set-off for haulin. He pled that the shuks was unsound; that they was barred by lim- itashuns; that they didn't agree with his cow, and that he never got any shuks from me. He spoak about a hour, and allooded to me as a swindler about 45 times. The bedevild jewry went out and brot in a verdik agin me for fifty cents, and four dollars for costs. I hain't saved many shuks on my plantashun sence, and I don't intend to til it gits less xpensiv. I look upon this as a warnin to all foaks never to go to law about shuks, or - any other small sirkumstanse. The next trubble I had was with a feller I hired   i88 ADDRESSES THE LEBANON LAW SCHOOL. to-dig me a well. He was to dig. it for 20 dol- lers, and I was to pay him in meat and meal, and sich like. The vagabon kep gittin along til he got all the pay, but hadn't dug nary a foot in the ground. So I made out my akkount and sued him. as follers, to wit: Old John Hanks, to Bill Arp,    Dr. To I well you didn't dig.     $20 Well, Hanks, he hired a cheep lawyer, who rared round xtensively, and sed a heep of -funny things at my xpense, and finally dismissd my case for what he calld -its "ridikulum abserdum." I paid those costs and went home a sadder and a wiser man. I pulld down my little kabbin and mooved it sum 300 yards nigher the spring, and I hav drunk mity little well water sence. I look upon this case as a warnin to all foaks never to pay for enything till you git it, espeshally if it has to be dug. The next law case I had I ganed it all by myself, by the forse of sirkumstanses. I bot a man's note that; was giv for the hire of a nigger -boy, Dik. Findin he wouldn't pay me, I sued him before old Squire Maginnis,beleevin that it was sich a ded thing that the devil couldn't keep me out of a ver- dik. The feller pled failur of konsiderashun, and non est faktum, and ignisfatuis, and infansy, and that the nigger's name wasn't Dik, but Richard. The old Squire was a powerful sesesh, and hated the Yankees amazin. So, atter the lawyer had got /   ADDRESSES THE LEBANON LAWY SCHOOL. 189 thru his speech and finished up his readin from a book called "Greenleaf," I rose forward to a atti- tood. Stretchin forth my arms, ses I, "Squire Maginnis, I would ax, sur, if this is a time in the his- try of our afflikted ko-untry when-Yankee law books should'be admitted in a Southern patriot's Court? Hain't we got a State of our own and a code of Georgy laws that's printed on Georgy sile? On the very fust page of the gentleman's book I seed the name of the sitty of Bosting. Yes, sur, it was ritten in Bosting, where they don't know no more about the hire of a nigger than an ox knows the man' who will tan his hide." I' sed sum more things that was pinted and patriotik, and closd my argyment by handin the book to the Squire. He put on his ,speks, and atter lookini at the book about a minit, ses he : "Mr. Arp, you can hav a judgment, and I hope that from hensefourth no lawyer will presoom to cum before this, honerabul court with pisen dokyments  to proove his case. If he do, this court will take it as an insult, and send him to jail," I look upon this case as . a warnin to all foaks who :     - gambel in law, to hold a  good hand and play it well. High jestice and patriotism are winning- trumps.   ICo ADDRESSES THE LEBANON LAW SCHOOL. My next case was about steelin a hog. -Larseny ?,'   from the woods, I think they call it. I didn't hav but one hog, and we had to let him run out to keep him alive, for akorns was cheeper than corn at my house-. Old Romulus Ramsour sorter wanted sum fresh meat, and so he shot my shote in the woods and was catched carrying him home. He had cut off his ears and throwed em away; but we found em, with the under bit in the right and swaller fork in the left, and so Romulus was brot up square before-the jewry,-and his-.defense was that it was a wild hog. - The jewry was out about two hours and brot in a verdiik: "We the jewry know that shortly atter the war the kountry was scarce of provishuns, and in considerashun of the hard time our poor peepul had in maintanin their families, and the temtashuns that surrounded em, we find the defendent not guilty, but we rekommend him not to do so any more." The motto of this case is that a man ortent to keep hogs in a poor naber- hood.           - After this I had a diffikulty with a man by the name of Kohen, and I thot I wouldn't go to law, but would arbytrate. I had bot Tom Swillins' wheat at a dollar a bushel, if he couldn't -do any better, and if he could do better he was to cum back and giv me the prefferense. The skamp went off and sold the wheat to Kohen for-a dollar and five cents, and Kohen knowd all about his kontrak, with me. Me and him likc to hav fit, and perhaps   ADDRESSES THE LEBANON LAW SCHOOL. I9I would, if I hadn't been puny; but we finally left it to Josh Billins to arbytrate. Old Josh deliber- ated on the thing three days and nites, and finally brot in an award that Kohen should hav the wheat and I should hav the prefferense. I hain't sub- mitted no more cases to arbytration sinse, and my advise to all' peepul is to arbytrate nuthin if your case is honest, for there aint no judge there to keep one man from trikkin the other. An honest man don't stan no chance nowhere xceptin in a court house with a good lawyer to back him.  The motto of this case is, never to arbytrate nuthin but a bad case, and take a good lawyer to advise, and pay him fur it before you do that. But I got Fretman. I didn't but my lawyer, Marks, did.  Fretman was a nutmeg skhool teacher who had gone round my naborhood with his skool artikles, and I put down for Troup and Calhoun to go, and -intended to send seven or eight more if he proved himself right. I soon found that the little nullifiers warn't lernin enything, and on inquiry I found that nutmeg was a givin power- ful long resessess, and employin his time cheefly in carryin on with a tolerbul sized female gal that was a goin to him. Troup sed he heerd the gal squeel one day, and he knowd Fretman was a squeezin of her. I don't mind our boys a squeezin of -the Yankee gals, but I'll be- blamed if the Yankees shall be a squeezin ourn. So I got mad'and took the childern away. At the end of the term   192 ADDRESSES THE LEBANON LAW SCHOOL. Fretman sued me for I8 dollars and hired a cheep ' '   lawyer to kollekt it. Before this time I had lerned sum sense about a lawyer, so I hired a good one and spred my pokit book down before him, and told him to take what would satisfi him. And he took. Old Phil Davis was the jestice. Marks made the openin speech to the effek. that every profeshunal man ort to be able to illustrate, his trade, and he therefore proposed to put Mr. Fret- man on the stan and spell him. This moshun was fout hard, but it agreed with old Phil's noshuns of "high jestice," and- ses he, "Mr.* Fretman you will hav to spell, sur." Marks then swore him that he would giv true evidense in this case, and that he would spell evry word in Dan'l Webster's spellin book correkly to the best of his knowledge and beleef, so help him, etc. I saw then that he were a tremblin all over like a cold wet dog. Ses Marks, "Mr. Fretman, spell 'tisik.'" Well, he spelt it, puttin in aph and a th and a gh and a zh, and I don't know what all, and I thot he were gone up the: fust pop, but Marks sed it were right. He then spelt him right strate along on all sorts of big words, and little words, and long words, and short words, and he knowd em all, til finally Marks ses, "Now, sur, spell 'Ompompynusuk.'"Fretman drawd a long breth and sed it warn't in the book. Marks proved it was by a old preecher who was a settin by, and old Phil spoke up with power, ses he, "Mr. Fretman, you must spell it, sur." Fret-   ADDRESSES THE LEBANON LAW SCHOOL. 193 man was a swettin like a run down filly. He took one pass at it, ;and missd., "You can cum down, sur," ses Marks, " you've lost your case," and shore enuf, old Phil giv a verdik agin him like a darn. Marks was a whale in his way. At the same court he was about to nonsoot a Doktor bekaus he didn't hav his diplomy, and the Doktor begged the court for time to go home after it. He rode 7 miles and back as hard as he could lick it-, and when he; handed it over, Marks, ses he, "Now, sur, you will just take the stand and translate this lattin into English so that the court may onder- stand it." Well, he jest caved, for-he couldn't do it.                      '   He lost his case in two minits, for the old squire sed that a dokter who couldn't read his diplomy had no more right to praktise than a magistrate what couldn't read the license had- to jine two cuple together. This is a warnin to all profeshu- nal men to understand-their bisness, and the moral of the case is that a man ortent to be a squeezin the gals where enybody can see him. But I don't want it onderstood that I'm agin it on proper ok- kashuns, and in a tender manner. There ain't no squeezin necessary. But I must close this breef epistle.

We   whipd it at the first and in the middle, but they whipd  us at the last. We never counted on havin to fite all creashun in front, and Ellik Brown and Joe Steph- ens & Co. in the rear.

I95 ashamed of their konduct I'm willin to drap it and make frends. The pure breed of Yankees never was a favorite stock with me. When it's jewdish- ously crossed it does very well, but even then the old Yank will crop out ever anon and show the skrub. There is as much difference in peepul as there is in hosses. The pure Sutherner is bludded stock. With him honor and fair dealin and family pride are bigger things than miney. The pure Yankee is a philthy luker skrub. Money is the big thing. Their cheef end of man is to keep all you git, and git all you can. They like what other peepul hav got better than their own, and they go for it and call it spekulatin: If they can't get it fast enuf that way they pass laws in Congress that will get it by degrees. Through tariffs and bounties and appropriashuns they got nearly all we had before the war, and hav stole all the ballans since. They look upon us as' fomen worthy of their steal. When a Yank' gits rich and don't want any more, he gits sorter honest and gives away sum to churches and colleges. Then he lays down and dies and has a whited sep- ulker bilt over him, and goes about huntin for Abraham's buzzum. A poor Sutherner don't keer for a thrip, but a Yank will git rich off coppers. He will buy nails at four dollars and go cents a keg and retail em at 5 sents a pound. Ten sents and the keg is consid- ered a fair profit in Konnetikut. He will speku-                 96 ILL ARP ON THE STOCK MARKET. late on anything in the world. I knowed one to buy his wife's dower for two hundred dollars and sell it to his daddy-in-law for a thousan. That was a cute way of makin the stingy old cuss giv him sumthin, before he died. A regular Yank is a perambulatin man.? He out travels all creashun when huntin round for money. He don't mind goin frum Maine to Mississippi no more than we mind goin to the post offis. He insinuates him- self into every land that's got anything he can git. He's smart, and he's diligent, and he's never left 'by the train. These is good qualities, and I wish- our peepul had em. When a clever Yank cums down South and mixes with our foaks, he im- proves rapidly by contact, and if he comes in his youth and -stays long enough and marries in a respectable family he is apt to be a good sitizen. It helps him and it helps the family, especially if its poor and proud. This kind of a cross genrully does well and brings good froot. The offspring is apt to be lively and shifty, and hav the love of money; and the love of honor so butifully mixed up that you- can't tell tother from which. The only danger is that the Yank may crop out occa- sionally and produce sum mortificashun. A cross between Massachusetts and' South Callina does very well now a days. One is chuck full of money and the other of honor. The money keeps the - honor from perishin, which is a good thing, for if it an'tkept cumfortable it is inclined to degenerate,   BILL ARP ON THE STOCK MARKET. 197  and the stock runs into skrub in two generashuns. Honor, nor nuthin else, ain't bumb proof agin the debasin influence of an emty stomak. ---If a race hoss ain't well kept his offspring will play out ; and so when a first family gits poor, the childern be- kum a sekond family, and so on and so forth, ontil you can't tell em from common stock. Now, my opinyun is that a State or a Guver- ment ought to keep up its human stock jist like peepul keep up their cattle stock. When a man looms up above the horizun as a great man, he ought to be penshuned and supported So that- he wouldn't hav to think about munny. He ort to be required to marry into another penshuned family, and in this way 'keep up a family of brains to draw from for our Presidents and Guvenors and law makers. They ought to be paid enuf to keep em out of temtation, and then we wouldn't have no carpet baggers nor Mobilliars, nor Cleweses, nor pig iron Kelly's, nor lobbyin bills through the house for pay. I like to see a family of brains keepin up the family reputation for generashuns to cum. I like the Adamses and Prestons and Brek- enridges, and Lamars, and Bayards, and all sich, and I'm glad they was born rich. I want all great men to be rich as long as they are good. Their influence spreads all over the country and we can pint our childern to em and say "there's your mark, now shoot at it." As it is now, the strug- gle seems to be who can git the richest, and it don't   198 BILL ARP ON THE STOCK MARKET. matter how they git munny so they git it, and ain't cocht a stealin of it. Sumtimes you see the worst sort of skrub stock blessed with an oncommon quantity of brains, and then you may look out. You moul as well surrender, for they are goin to hav a slice of your property. -If they can't git it no other way they will run down an offis, or a rail- road, or a Michel estate, or a lease, or git up a war and sneak out of it, or git a guvurment con-. trak, or git sumthini that pays ewithout Work. A smart skrub is a dangerus animul. A cow that horns down the fense, or a hog that roots open the gate, or a hoss that lets down the draw bars is a nusance and a cuss. They are skrub. A pure Durhtam, or a Berkshire, or a Harney won't do it. The old fashund fusf families wouldn't do a mean thing. They was above it. They wouldn't lose their self respek. : I like them sort, espeshually if they are rich. I like to live in their naborhood. They hav big ideas and big ways, and 16ok like foaks ort to look. They hold their heads up and look at you strait when they talk to you. They don't ride nor walk like common foaks. I can tell one of em a hundred yards., It takes all sorts of foaks to make up a world, and I'm glad that kind is in it. I'm as poor as Lazzyrus, but I ain't fool enuf to hate rich foaks. I like em.

In fakt a country is obleeged to have em to keep rich foaks in munny. That's what I've been doin all my life, and if I don't grumble at it nobody needent to.

Three score years and teh must be a provokin long time to, foaks that's waitin. And there's that needle eye bisness, and the long divishun, and the quarrels of the lawyers over the estate. But after all I like munny, I've got nuthin agin it so far as I'm concerned. If enny- body should leave me enny, I should aksept it arind shed a tear to his memory. The fakt is I would like to feel the feeling of a rich man for a little while. Maybe it would stretch me up a little. Mrs. Arp says I'm gettin hump shouldered. I would like to be an elder in a church, and give 500 dollars a year to the preacher and shake hands with the brethren and sisters at the vestybule. That would be'elegant. I'm obleeged to think I'd like that. Well, after all, it don't matter much whether a man is poor or rich. One man is about as happy as another if his hart is in his buzzum and not in   200 BILL ARP ON THE STOCK MARKET. his poket.

BILL ARP ON THE COLLAPSE.    209 We've- got. all the State officers from Gov. Smith down to the bottom, and I'm satisfied. Hurrah for old Georgy! BILL ARP. P. S.--I remarked to-day in a crowd : "We are a nation of thieves," and an offis holder slipped up to me and whispered; "Call no names, Bill, call no names." Thars something wrong about that man.                B. A.   THRTY-SECOND PAPER. BILL ARP ON BILL TELL. PROFESSOR KOLL has just found out that there never was such a man as William Tell. I don't know that krout-eatin Koll, but, I'll bet he's mad with some feller by the name of Tell, and went to work to undermine his family. If there is a passel of folks upon the face of the earth who enjoy my contempt, it is them fellers who are always tryin to pull down and never build up. A man may do a heap of good things, but if he makes one little mistake they'l talk about that and throw it up for- ever. They always mention it with a but. "He's a very smart man, but. He would be a great man, but. His intentions are very good, but," Regu- lar sappers and miners they are. They suck all the sap out of a tree to kill it, and then undermine it to throw it down. Now, here's a feller who can't make himself no- torious in any other way, and so he goes to sap-   BILL ARP ON BILL TELL.     2II pin and minin Bill Tell. Now, I don't believe one word of it. I was named for Bill, and if there want no such man, then I'm nobody but Arp- that's all. That feller is a fool, and he's got- a big job on hand if he thinks he can rob history of its best story, and make a hundred million of folks believe what- he says. He's envious of Bill. Be- cause he can't shoot an apple, or string a cross- bow, or make himself famous, he dodn't want any- body else to. 'Every few years some conceited fool -attacks history. I understand they've got a society to bile it down and stew it. Well, its sor- ter like washing for gold--they lose more than they catch. Now it aint been very long since one feller de- nied that Bill Shakespeare ever lived. Well they are sorter hard on the Bills, aint they? Another wrote several columns to prove that old Bona- parte died before he was, born, and another man took up forty pages of a Yankee magazine to prove that one of the Bourbons was livin in obscurity on the banks of Lake Michilimackinack. He hated old Bonaparte's family so bad that he was willin to swindle a half-bred Canady Indian onto the throne of France. Now there was ai Gesler, and he was a tyrant, and Bill Tell wouldent tip his hat to him, and he put him in jail, and Bill's son Henric was a noble little boy, and Henric was to 'die unless Bill shot an apple off his head, and little Henric was blind-   212    BILL ARP ON BILL TELL. folded and stood firm as a rock and still as the grave, and there was a prayer, and a shot and a shout, and the little boy was saved, and the apple was hit in the center. All that's so, and Tell way- laid old Gesler afterwards and killed him and set Switzerland free. Its all so. Its been in the books ever since I was born. I've read it a hun- dred times, and told it to Bull Run and Chicka- hominy and Bob Lee, and all .the little Arps, and I'm not going to take it back, and if I had found out it wascnt true, I wouldent have told it for a thousand dollars, and I don't like the man who did ':T - - tell it, nor the man, woman or child who believes it, for its like robbin a dead preacher of his tomb- stone, to rob history of William Tell. -My opinion is that the peace and happiness of the country is in danger from these sappers and miners. We'll all have to have a creed and swear to. it. I believe in Geo; Washington and his hatchet, and Isaac Newton and his apple tree. I believe in Bonaparte and Shakespeare, and Andy Jackson at the battle of-New Orleans. I believe in Santa Clads and Pocahontas and John Smith and Ben Franklin and Jefferson Davis and Dixie, and the 4th of July I776. I believe that an old man onst found a rude boy up one of his apple trees a stealin apples. I believe the milk maid spilt her milk when she tossed her head and said, "Green it shall be." I believe in Robinson Crusoe   BILL ARP ON BILL TELL.    213 and his man Friday, and the island of Juan Fer-  nandes. I believe in old Mother Goose and Cin- derilla and John Robinson's Circus. I believe in Greeley and Bennett and Prentice, and other dead editors, except Sam Bard, late of the Chat- tanopga Herald, deceased. I believe most sol- emnly that Ben Butler stole spoons. I believe in the big battles of Waterloo and Bull Run 'and Thermopylee and Dorking and Leather's Ford. That last battle was immortalized in verse by Jack Jones when he wrote, "Big fitin John Sanford, he. fit a mity battle. He fout it at the ford, where Leather's stole the cattle." I believe that Gen. Grant told the truth when he said they had two f million six hundred and eighty-eight thousand of soldiers in the field in the late war. I believe that old Sherman marched through Georgia about half a mile behind me and my folks, and that Big John was saved by tieing a knot in his steer's tail.

If I can keep in work and out of money, I'm happy. I want a heap of work, and I would like it at home. I don't want to be runin about over the country a huntin of it. Bill, I'll tell you what's a fact, I dreamed one night that Old Master spake to me, and says he, "George." Says I, "Sir." And says he, "You're a good plasterer, and you love to work and you want a job., Now I want you to go to building your stag- ing, and you must build it high, for I want all the blue sky above you plastered over with a hard finish, and I want a center piece put round every star." Thinks I that's a job that will last awhile, and I went to making out my bills for poles and staging. lumber as 'fast as I could. Golly, Bill, what a job it would be if a feller could get at it. I could plaster and whistle and sing all the year   HAPPY GEORGE.        215 round. I like work, but I don't like money. I rather be paid off in little orders-orders for meat and meal and molasses and mackerel. Money bothers me. It gits mixed up in my pocket with my knife and tobacco and tooth pick and strings and nails and all such. Somehow I was born with a dislike of money. I never see a rich man that I ain't sorry for him. I sympathise with him, for I know he must be enjoyin a sight of trouble in this world, and then his chances in the next are so mortal slim. I dispise a lazy man, Bill, as much as anybody, but if I thought I was in any danger of gittin rich out of mortar, I'd put the price down to ten cents a yard, shore. I want to eat and sleep and sing in peace, and I know a man can't do it who is jist a workin his day-lights out to in- crease the size of his pile. I don't want any sur- plus about me. I don't like surpluses. I never have surplus provisions, nor surplus room in my house. It gits me into trouble. My house had three rooms in it and I swapped it- off for a smaller one. I ain't stingy a bit and. I'll divide the last cent with my friends, but if folks will all work there'wont be any occasion to divide. They'll all have a plenty. Last year when me and Jinny Ann was trying to live in three rooms, one day a great big, double-shouldered second cousin of hers by her step-father's side came poking in just as we sit down to dinner. He is the houngriest lookin man generally you ever seed, and he swept the      -   2 2I6     HAPPY GEORGE. platter clean that time. He was powerful glad to see-Jenny Ann and the baby; and that night he come back to supper and L he set by the fire a chaw- in his tobacco and swap- ed lies with us untill bed time, and we put him in the. surplus room and he sawed gourds s oide, and he it was after midnight be- stayed on for thfre    we got  to weep. a sa  n les ad can tae. Next mornin Jinny Ann cooked two middJin size mackerel for breakfast and he took half' a  one on h is plate and it was gone at two swipesum,  and  Jenny ann axed him to take sumook up thmore and he did. itHe was my wife's what herecond cousin by her ste p-father's side, and he stayed on for three days jest a knockin about town a swappin lies and chawin tobacker.

Well, you see when she told me what -her-second cousin by her step-father's side   HAPPY GEORGE.       2 -7 was up to, I reniged. I had stood it about as long as possible. I told Jenny Ann that I had a power of respect for her kin, but seein as how her mother was dead and her step-father had married again and as how her second cousin by her step-father's side was always hungry and could eat as much and as often as a nigger's houn, he and his gals shouldn't Carter on me, -so we jest locked up the house that evening and took a week's board across the street at a neighbors. Shore enuf they come that night about dark, him and the gals and they all got out of the little old rickety carryall and about that time he looked towards the house and hollered, "hello;-?' then waited awhile and hollered "hello" a little louder. Nary door opened, nary dog barked. We was watchin him from our nabors window and mity nigh dyin with laffin. HELLO! HELLO!! He went up to the door and tapped it with the butt end of his thrash pole and says in a sorter sickly way for the last time, hello; Jenny thought about the "purty baby " just then, and says she, "George, we oughtend't to do 'em so," but I was as firm as.. a rock and I chawed my tobacco with a satisfac- tion when I saw my wife's second cousin by her step-father's side whip up that old swinnied mule and drive them hungry gals over to a third-class boardin house. Now, Bill, that trouble and fuss cum from havin a surplus, and as for me and my folks we hav quit it. May the good Lord have 10   I        .,   218     . HAPPY G-ORGE. mercy upon me, and give me plenty of work and ',n   a mighty little money is my prayer. Lime and water and sand and hair, and a wall to spread it on will do-me. If I can git plenty of that I'll risk the ballance, and my wife's second cousin by her step- father's side throw'd in.   1   ' THRTY-FOURTH PAPER. BILL ARP MAKES SOME REMARKS. I REKON I've lived as much as most foaks accord- in to age and I aint tired of livin yit. I like it. I've seen good times, and bad times, and hard times, and times that tried men's soles, but I never seed a time that I couldent extrakt sum cumfort out of trubble. When I was a boy I was a lively little devil and lost my edycashun bekaus I couldnt see enuf fun in the spellin book to get thru it.- I'm sorry for it now, for a blind man can see what a fool I am. The last skhoolin I got was the day I run from John Norton, and there was so much fun in that my daddy sed he rekoned I'd gotlarnin enuf. I had a bile on my back as big as a ginney egg and it was mighty nigh ready to bust. -We boys had got in a way of ringin the bell before old Norton got there, and he sed that the first boy he kotch at itwould ketch hail kolumby. Shore enuf he slipped upon us one mornin and before-I knowed it he had me by the collar and was layin it on like   1   220  BILL ARP MAKES SOME REMARKS. killin snakes. I hollered "my bile, my bile, don't hit me on my bile," and just then he popped a a .. center shot and I jumped three feet in the atmos- phere and with a hoop and a beller I took to my heels. I, run and hollered like the devil was after me, and shore enuf he was. tHis long legs gained -.  , on me at every jump, but justlas he was about to grab me I made a double on h aind got a fresh start. I was aktiv as a cat and so we had it over fences, thru the woods, and round the meetin house, and all the boys was standin on skool house hill a hollerin, " go it my Bill-go it my Bill," As good luck would have it there was a grape vine a swingin away ahead of me, and- I ducked my head under it just as old Norton was about two jumps behind. He hadn't seen it, and it took him about the middle and throwed him the hardest summerset I ever seed a man git. He was tired and I knowd it, and I stopped about three rods off and laffed at him as loud as I could ball. I forgot all about my bile. He never follered me another step,' for he was plum giv out, but he set there bareheaded and shook his hickory at me lookin as mad and as miserable as possible. That lick on my bile was about the keenest pain I ever felt in my life and liked to have killed me. It busted as wide open as a soap -trof and let every drop of the juice out, but I've had a power of fun thinkin about it for the last forty years. But I didn't start to tell you about that.   BiLL ARP MAKES SOME REMARKS.   221 JIM ALLCORN. I was only thinkin how much better it is to be in.  a lively humor than be goin about like a disap- pointed offis seeker. Good humor is a blessed thing in a family and smoothes down a heap of trubble. I never was mad but. a few times in my life, and then I wasn't mad long. Foaks thought I was mad when I fout Jim Allcorn, but I wasent. I never had had any grudge agin Jim. He had never done me any harm, but I could hear of his sayin around in the naborhood that Bill Arp had played cock of the walk long enuf. So one day I went .over to Chulio court ground to joak with the boys, and shore enuf Jim was there, and I soon perseeved that theodevil was in him. 'He had never been whipped by anybody in the distrikt, and he outweighed me by about fifteen pounds. A drink or two had made him sassy, and so he commenced walkin around first to one crowd and then another darin anybody to fite him.- He would pint to his forrerd and say, "I'll give anybody five dollars to hit that." I was standin tawkin to Frank Air and John Johnsin, and as nobody took up Jim's offer, thinks, says I to myself, if he cums round, here a huntin for a fite he shall have one, by golly. If he dares me to hit him I'll do it if it's the last lick I ever strike on this side of Jordin. Frank Air looked at me and seemed to know what I was                    t   222  BILL 44RP MAKES SOME REMARKS. a thinkin, and, says he, "Bill, jest let Allcorn 9- -   alone. He's too big for you, and besides, there ain't nothin to fite about." By- this time Jim was makin rite towards us. I put myself in position, and by the time he got to us every muscle in my body was strung as tite as a banjo. I was workedi up powerful, and felt like I could whip a camp meetin of wild cats. Shore enuf Jim stepped up defiantly, and lookin me rite in- the eye, says he, "I dare anybody to hit that," and he touched his knuckles to his forrerd. He had barely straitened before I took him rite in the left eye with a sock- dolyger that popped like a wagin whip. It turned him half round, and as quick as lightnin I let him hav another on the right temple, and followed it up with a leap that sprawled him as flat as a foot mat. I knowed my customer, and I never giv him time to rally. If ever a man was diligent in busi- ness it was me. I took him so hard and so fast in the eyes with my fists, and in his bred basket with P.  my3 knees, that he didn't hav a chance to see or to breathe, and he was the worst whipped man in two minets I ever seed in my life. When he hollered I helped him up and breshed the dirt off his clothes, and he was as umble as a ded nigger and as sober as a Presbyterian Preacher. We took a dram on the strength of it, and was always good frends afterwards. But I dident start to tell you about that. ,. !    BILL ARP MAKES SOME REMARKS.   223 JIM PERKINS (cousin of Eli). I jist wanted to say that I wasent mad wit; Jim Allcorn as sum peepul supposed; but it do illus- trate the onsertainty of human kalkulashuns in this subloonery world. The disappintments of life are amazin, and if a man wants to fret and grumble at his luck he can find a reesunable opper- tunity to do so every day that he lives. Them sort of constitutional grumblers aint much cumpany to me. I'd rather be Jim Perkins with a bullit hole through me and take my chances. Jim, you know, was shot down at Gains' mill, and the ball went in at the umbilikus, as Dr. Battey called it, and cum out at the backbone. The Doktor sounded him, and, sez he, "Jeems, my friend, your wound is mortal." Jim looked at the Doktor, and then at me, and, sez he, " that's bad aintit?" "Mighty bad," sez I, and I was as sorrA for him as I ever was for anybody in my life. Sez he, " Bill I'd make a will if it warnt for one thing." "What's that, Jim?" sez I. He sorter smiled and sez, "I haint got nuthin to will." He then raised up on his elbow and, sez he,' "Doktor, is .there one chance in a hundred for me?" and the Doktor sez, "jest about Jim." "Well, then," sez he, -"I'll git well-I feel it in my gizzard." He looked down at the big hole in his umbilikus, and sez he, "If I do git well won't it be a great naval viktry,   : .  224  BILL ARP MAKES SOME REMARKS. Doktor Battey?" Well' shore enuff he did git well, and in two months he was a fitin the Yanks away up in Maryland. But I didn't start to tell you about that. IKE MACKOY. I jest stuck it in by way of illustratin the good effeks of keepin'up one's spirits. My motto has always been to never say die, as Gen. Nelson sed at the battle of Madagascar, or sum other big river. All things considered, I've had a power of good luck in my life. I dorn't mean money luck, by no means, for most of my life I've been so ded poor that Lazarus would hev been considered a note shaver compared with me. But I've been in a heap of close places and sumhow always cum out rite side up with keer. Speakin of luck, I don't know that I ever told you about that rassel I had with Ike McKoy at Bob Hide's barbyku. You see Ike was perhaps the best rasler in all Cherokee, and he jest hankered after a chance to break a bone or two in my body. Now, you know, I never hunted for a fite nor a fuss in my life, but I never dodged one. I dident want a tilt with Ike, for my opinyun was that he was the best man of the two, but I never sed anything and jest trusted to luck. We was both at th barbyku, and he put on a heap of airs and strutted around with his shirt collar open clean down to his waist, and his hat cocked   BILL ARP MAKES SOME REMARKS.    225 on one-side as sassy as a confedrit quartermaster. He took a dram or two and stuffed himself full of fresh meat at dinner time. Purty soon it was norated around that Ike was going to banter me for a rassel, and, shore enuff, he did. The boys were all up for sum fun, and Ike hollered out "I'll bet ten dollars I can paster the length of any man on the ground, and I'll giv Bill Arp five dollars to", take up the bet." Of course there was no gittin around the like of that. The banter got my blood up, and so, without waitin for preliminaries, I shucked myself and went in. The boys was all powerfully excited, and was a bettin evry dollar they could raise; and Bob Moore, the feller I had licked about a year before, jumped on a stump and sed hed bet twenty dollars to ten that Ike would knock the breath out of me the first fall. I jest walked over to him with the money and sed, "I'll take that bet." The river was right close to the ring, and the bank was purty steep. I had on a pair of old breeches that had been sained in and dried so often they was about half rotten. When we hitched, Ike, took good britches hold and lifted me up and down a few times like I was a child. He was the heaviest, but I had the most spring in me, and so I jest let him play round for sum time, limber like, until he suddenly took a notion to make short work of it by one of- his backleg move- ments. He drawed me up to his body andlifted me in the air with a powerful twist. Just at that   226   BZLL ARP MAKES SOME REMARKS. minit his back was close to the river bank, and as my feet touched the ground I giv a tremenjius jerk backwards and a shuv towards, and my britches busted plum open on the back, and tore clean off in the belly, and he fell from me and tumbled into the water, kerchug, and went out of sight as clean as a mud turtle in a mill pond. Such hollerin as them boys done I rekon never was heard in them woods. I jumped in and helped Ike get out as he riz to the top. He had took in a quart or two of water on top of his barbyku, and he set on the bank and throwd up enuf vittels to feed a pack of houns for a week. When he got over it he laffd and sed Sally told him before he left home he'd better let Bill Arp alone--for nobody could run agin his luck. Ike always believed he would hav throwd me if britches holt hadent broke, and I rekon maybe he would. One thing is sertin, it cured him of braggin, and that helps anybody. I never did like a braggin man. As a genrul thing they aint much akkount, and remind me of a dog I used to have, named Cesar. DOGS. But I dident start to tell you a dog story--only now, since I've mentioned him, I must tell you a circumstance about Cees. He was a middlin size broot, with fox ears and yaller spots over his eyes and could out bark and out brag all creation when he was inside the yard. If another dog was goin   BILL ARP MAKES SO-ME REMARKS.   227 along he'd run up and down the palins and bark and take on like he'd give the world if that fence wasent there. So one day when he, was showin off in that way I caught him by the nap of the neck : as he run by me and jest histed. him right over and drapped him. He struck the ground like an injun rubber ball, and was back agin on my side in a jiffy. If he had ever jumped that fence before I dident know it. The other dog run a quarter of a mile without stoppin. Now, that's the way with sum foaks. If you want to hear war tawk jest put a fence between em; and if you want it stopped, jest take the fence away. Dogs is mighty like peepul anyhow. They've got karacter. Sum of em are good honest trusty dogs that bark mity little, and bite at the right time. Sum are good pluk, and will fite like the dickens when their masters is close by to back em, but aint worth a cent by themselves. Sum make it a bizness to make other dogs fite. You've seen these little fices a runnin around growlin and snappin when two big dogs cum to- gether. They are jest as keen to get up a row and see a big dog fite as a store clerk or a shoemaker, and seem to enjoy it as much. And then, there's them mean yaller eyed bull terriers that don't care who they bite, so they bite sumbody. They are no respekter of persons, and I never had much respekt for a man who kept one on, his -premises. But of all mean, triflin, contemptible dogs in the world, the meanest of all is a country nigger's - . . .:   -228  BILL ARP MAKES SOME REMARfKS. houn-one that will kill sheep, and suck eggs, and lick the skillet, and steal evrything he can find, and try to do as nigh like his master ,as pogsibul. Sum dogs are filosofers, and study other dog's na- tur, just; like foaks study foaks. It's amazin to see a town dog trot up to a country dog and interview him., How quick he finds out whether it will do to attack him or not. If the country dog shows fite jest notis the consequential dignity with which the town dog retires. He goes off like there was a sudden emergency of bisness a callin him away. Town dogs :sumtimes combine agin a country dog, jest like town boys try to- run over country boys. I wish you could see Dr. Miller's dog Cartoosh. He jest lays in the piazzer all day watchin out for a stray dog, and as soon as he sees him he goes for him, and he can tell in half a minit whether he can whip him or run him, and if he can, he does it instanter, and if he can't, he runs to the next yard where there's two more dogs that nabor with him, and in a minit they all cum a tarin out to- gether, and that country dog has to run or take a whippin, shore. I've seen Cartoosh play that game many a time. These town pups remind me pow- erfully of small editurs prowlin around for news. In myopinyun they is the inventors of .the inter- view bisness.

When a man gits into trubble, these sub editurs go fur him right strait, and they force their curosity away down in- to his heart strings, and bore into his buzzom with an augur as hard and as cold as chilld iron. Then away they go to skatter his feelins and sekrets to the wide, wide world. You see the poor feller can't help himself, for if he wont talk, they'll go off and slander him, and make the publik beleeve he's dun -sumthing mean, and is ashamed to own it. I've knowd em to go into a dungeon and interview a man who dident have two hours to live. Dod rot  em. I wish one of em would try to interview me. If he dident catch leather under his coat tail it would be bekaus he retired prematurely--that's all. But I like editurs sorter--especially sum. I like them that is the guardeens of sleepin liberty, and good morals, and publik welfare, and sich like; but there's sum kinds I don't like. Them what makes sensation a bizness; feedin the peepul on skandal, and crime, and gossip, and private quar- rels, and themn what levies black mail on polytiks, and won't go for a man who won't. pay em, and will go for a man that will. -Them last watch for elekshun times jest like a sick frog waitin for rain.

BILL NATIONS. You-never knowd Bill I rekun. Hes gone to Ar- kensaw and I dont know whether hes ded or alive. He was a good feller, Bill was, as most all whisky drinkers are. Me and him both used to love it powerful-especially Bill. We soaked it when we could git it, and when we coudent we hankered after it amazingly. I must tell you a little antidote on Bill tho I diderit start to tell you about that. We .started on a little jurney one day in June, and took along a bottle of " old rye," and there was so many springs and wells on the road, that it was mighty nigh gone before dinner. We took our snack and Bill drained the last drop, for he said we would soon git to Joe Paxton's, and that Joe always kept some. Shore enuff Joe dident have a drop, and we concluded as we was mighty dry to go on to Jim Alfords and stay all night. We knew that Jim had it for he always had it. So we whipped up and the old Bay had to travel, for I tell you when a man wants whiskey everything has to bend to the gittin of it. Shore enuff Jim had some. 'He was mity glad to see us and he knowd what we wanted, for he knowd how-it was hisself. So he brought out -an old fashend glass decanter, and a shugar bowl, and a tumbler, and a spoon, and says he, "now boys jest wait a minit till you git rested   BILL ARP MAKES SOME REMARKS.   231 sorter, for it aint good to take whiskey on a hot stomack. I've jest been readin a piece in Grady's newspaper about a frog-the darndest frog that perhaps ever come from a tadpole,. it was found up in Kanetucky, and is as big as a peck measure. Bill, do you take this paper and read it aloud to us. I'm a poor hand to read and I want to hear if. I'll be hanged if it ain't the darndest frog I ever hearn of." He laid the paper on my kneesLand I begun to read, thinkin it was a little short anticdote, but as I turned the paper over I found it was mighty nigh a column. I took a side glance at Bill, and I saw the little dry twitches a jumpin about on his countenance. He was mighty nigh dead for a drink. I warent so bad off my- self and I was about half mad with him for drainin the bottle before dinner ; so I just read along slow and stopped two or three times to clear my throat just to consume time. Pretty soon Bill-got up and commenced walkin about, and he would look at the dekanter like he would give his daylights to choke the corn juice out of *it. I read along' slowly. Old Alvord was a listnin and chawin his tobakker and spittin out of the door.

I've got over the like of that, boys, and I hope Bill has too, but I don't know. I wish in my soul that everybody had quit it, for you may talk about slavery, and penitentiary, and chain-gangs, and the yankees, and General Grant and a devil of a wife, but whiskey is the worst master that ever a man had over him. I know how it is myself. But there is one! good thing about drinkin. I almost wish every hnan was a reformd drunkard. No man who hasn't drank liker knows what a lux- ury cold wafer is. I have got up in the night in cold wether after I had been spreein around, and gone to the well burnin up with thirst, feeling like the gallows, and the grave, and the infernal regions was too -good for me, and when I took up the bucket in my hands, and with my elbows a trem- lin like I had the shalkin ager, put the water to my lips; it was the most delicious, satisfyin, luxurius draft that ever went down my throat. I have stood there and drank, and drank until I could drink no. more, and gone back to bed thankin God for the pure, innocent, and coolin beverig, and-cursin my- self from my inmost soul for ever touchin the ac- cursed whisky. In my torture of mind and body I have made vows and promises, and Blroken em "within a day. .

THE amount of religion that appears to go to church of a Sunday mornin, it seems, ort to satisfy any reasonable man. Whether its all genuwine and lastin or not, I can't say, but sertinly its a heap better to have a little religion on Sunday than not have it at all. Suppose you do smell a little fire and brimstone about a, man of a week day, 'when he's dealin in, money, its a great releefto see him on Sunday goin to meetin with a brass bound hime book under his arm, and lookin like he was -in about three feet of hevin. A meetin house is a mity good place to fix up the comin week's bis- ness. A man' can set there and be a lookin rite strate at the preeCherwith a pare of glazed eyes and an iron klad bozum, and premeditate evry trade he wants to make next day.

The time may cum when we'll need em to keep off the shower, for I'm not sertin there's enuf men in Rome to do it. I beleeve old Abraham sarched diligently for ten and couldn't find em. Well, maybe there is that many here in the fork of these rivers, but I'm afeerd DeSoto and Lickskillet, and all such little places would go up. But I think the wimmin will save us, so fat as this world is concerned. The danger is that if the shower does cum, and they hav to git away, that salt bisness would be a big thing. My goodness, there would be enuf salt staks a standin roun to make deer licks for all this kountry; for the blessed wimmin would look back, salt or no salt. Our foaks are resunabul, and clever, an'dakkom- odative, and all that, but their idee of brakin sperits, and contritin harts, and drinkin in grace in a meetin house, likes a heep of bein developed. They would enjoy a power of religion if they could   WORSHP.     L  237 buy it. If a dollar or two would allow a man to do a rite smart of devilment, it'would be a good way to support the church. That suits human natur mity well. You see, then, our foaks could cheat a man in a trade, or lie a little, or git on a bender, or go to a sirkus, or bet on a hoss race, and it wouldn't be enybody's bisness. It wouldn't be talked about, for he had paid for it to the church, and got a lisense. It would rase a power of -money, shore - Them emty pews, and them poor preachers. Im sorry for em. The Lord keeps em umble, and the peepul keeps em poor, but-they are hopeful. Their faces shine as they keep pullin up the hill of Zion. We've got all sorts of peepul, but they are the best, and I would rather see all the balanse go down than hav the preachers and the churches sunk. I like preachers bekaus they is human, though a heap of 'em hav tuk up an idee that they aint. Thers a haf a duzen sorts a claimin to have come rite strait along down from St. Paul in a postolik sucksesshion, and maybe they did, but the trubble is they are all discreditin one another, and keepin the people in a ferment, as to which line is the genuwine. Now my opinyun are that every good honest friendly christian preacher is good enuf for the like of me and is a blessin -to mankind, and that all of em come down in a sorter of a chain, but then it has been broke so often and the devil has slipped in so many spurius links it aint much ak-   238       WORSHP. kount now. I never liked foaks Athat was always a braggin on their ancestors. I like good stock but I think its a heap better for every tub to stand- on its own bottom, andjes so I think it would be a heap better if-them pre chers would quit tawkin about chains and draw the people towards hevin by the force of their own example. They can do it. I knowd a man onct who was so feard he would take the wrong rode that he jined the Methodist Church and made em dip him in a mill pond and then moved away and jined the Piskopa- lians so as to be shore he was in the true Church. The poor feller took sik not long after and sent for a Catholik Prest to give him the grand junction before he died. The good Lord only knows where he went, for I dont, only I know the quarrels among the preachers got his poor soul awfully tangled. I l'e the umble misshionary preacher whot goa about huntin up poor foaks and helpin em on to hevin through the briars and cane brakes of life. City Preachers is mitygood and very nesses- ery I know, but they do hav a powerful hard time tryin to keep their Churches from dyin of respec- tability. If you want to see religun thrive all over and kept lively jest go out into the back- woods and hear em sing oldfashend himes without a orgin and listen to em say " amen " when the preacher is a prayin " we thank thee that it is as well with us to-day as what it is." I tell you them   WORSHP.       239 brethren can hoe more corn next day than a sin- ner can in a week. Old father Bogin was the man for them peepul, tho he had a power of human devilment mixed up with his religion. I hearn 'him preach to a house full of niggers one mighty hot night, and he tawked to em jes like brimstone was a ranin down on top of the house. The dar- kies groaned and shouted tremengious, and kept gittin up closer and closer to him until he was mighty nigh suffocated with the colored perfum- ery. He looked over to John Divine who sot by a winder, and ses, "Bro. Jack, will you please burn a rag while I pray.' I axd him one day what made him -preach so hard to -them niggers and was he tryin to carry out Gen'l Grants Civil rites Bill. He sed he wished Grant and his Bill was at the bottom of the Black Sea; that the niggers was a volatile race, and had to be konverted onst a week, just like goin to mill. He said a big skeer of a Sunday night would jest about last em to the next Sunday, and keep em out of jail and saved the county right smart ex- pense. He sed he tried- to get the Northern Meth- odists to preach to em but they sed the niggers dident pay em, and they dident cum down here to work for nuthin.  .         ' Daddy Bogin had a power of Hardshell fun, in him, and would get up a big argument about any sort of an abstroosity. He was the feller who split up the-church of Zion's Hill in old Rabun by   t , 1  240       WORSHP. arguin that because Adam wasent born of a woman, he dident have an umbilicus. The Elders submitted the question to Dr. Mil- ler, who used to live there and he decided that akkordin to Pope's Essay, and other State papers, it depended upon the conglomerate theory of sur- roundin sircumstances.

Its a wonder Ive ever got over the like of that, and I ain't shore I hav, but sumhow I hanker after them good old times. I suppose they hav gone, forever gone. Now the big thing is a trip to New York, and as most evrybody had been there but me, I sudently started one moonshiny evenin to see if I could find my way there and back without a guide. My companion was Genrul Black, an old fash- ioned -man, who was teetotashiously blind. He was going to Baltimore in the hope that Dr. Chis- holm could remove the skales from his eyes. The Genrul was in fine spirits, for he had hopes of once more lookin upon natures butiful and lovly face--and womans too. To a man who has been led about for four long years in affirikan darkness its a mighty big thing to see. At times he seemed serious' and anxious about the venture he was making. I cheered him up all I could, andas we jurneyd along through the butiful valleys of East Tennysee I fed his blind eyes through his memry. I expatiated upon the rivers and the mrountins and :^  the crops and the nice little towns and the butiful women who got on and got off at the various stations. "Theres a fine oman Genrul," sed I. "Is she young and is she purty," sed he. "She   BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM.    25 I steps as young and proud as a fine blooded filly, bookd for her first race at a fair," sed I, " and she is as purty as a pigeon just takin her mate." The Genrul heaved a long sigh, and -said nothing, but nobody ever will know how bad he wanted to see  that Tennysee gal. By and by we came to the dinner house at Rogersville; and this reminds us that right here is the place where Judge Underwood always calls for eggs fried on both sides and loose in the middle. He says it's the. only place in the world where they cook 'em that way. A good eatin house is a good thing on 'a railroad, and saves a power of cussin. If a man wants to hear genuine cussin let him open his ears at the taverns on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. The same man never throws but one dollar away on that line. I heard } of a man tellin the landlord, as he give him his dollar, that he looked upon his eatin' house as, a regular swindle. The landlord took the munny -and the slander as serenely as if it was a compli- ment, but in a few days he got an important dis- patch from Mobile, for which he paid two dollars. He opened it and read :  "MY DEAR SIR--I told you the other day in 1 my haste that your eatin house was a swindle. I now repeat the akkusation at my leisure. You will please pay the Western Union ,two dollars, and charge it to ,FLY BLOSE.   252   BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM. Passing through the nations capital I gazed upon the marble pile whose' doam pierced the clouds and \sed to the Genrul, "There is a granj old buildin." He replied mournfully, "I can't See it, but I recomember it. It- is a magnificent struct- ure, but it is a whited sepulker, and has been the birthplace of more villainy than all the gamblin hells of Christendom. It is the birthplace of in- ikwity in high places. If there never had been a hell one would germinate spontaneously from the corruption that breeds within its walls, like mag- gots breeding in the karkases of the dead. Hy- pocrisy, avarice, lust and lies dwell there, and their foul influence spreds from this central fokus to the very confines of the Government. If the honest workin people who really support the na-  tion at the anvil and the loom and the plow-handle knowd one-half of the devilment that is laid and hatched in that buildin, and could' realize that all the stealin and plunder cum out of their sweat and their toil, they would raze it to the ground, and scatter its polluters to the ends of the earth." The Genrul's sightless eye balls rolled around wildly, but he soon subsided into a state of melan- choly reflektion. Arrivin' at Baltimore, an honest Irishman drove us to Dr. Chisolm's eye-shop. The Genrul made me take an Irishman, for he said they wouldn't deceive strangers. We found the Doctor up to his eye-brows in-eyes. There was two rooms full   BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM.    253 of patients, and not a sound eye among 'em. Thinks I to myself, if this is his daily bisness, there's more sick eyed people in the world than I ever dreamed of. After a little while the Genrul was led to a room in the hospital where he washed the travel off and dressed himself in a new suit of store clothes, and got the hang of the room by feelin' all around for the buro and the bed and the fire-place and the winders. We then went down to interview the Doctor, who had pretty well gone through the eye bisness for that day. After makin' his pleasant akquaintance he took the Gen- rul into a room as dark as Afriky and throwd a lokomotive head light right into his eye-balls. In a minute or so he remarked " all right, Genrul, I'll send you home without a guide in two weeks." He then showed me an eye as big as a, kokynut, which I suppoos cum all the way down, from opie Gog or Magog, and he took it all to pieces and explained the concern to my entire satisfaction. He showd me the irish and the pupil and the cata- line lens, and the conjunktion, and the sky-roket, and the victorious humor, and the erie canal, and the corny copia and the cataract. I always thought that the cataract was somthin' growin' on the outside, and that he cut it off with a thin bladed knife, but he sed the eyeball was a room, and the pupil was a winder, and the seein' was done from inside the room, and the cataract was a curtain that got in betwixt the organ of sight and ,.   ,254   BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM. the winder, and he had to go into the room with a knife and 'cut away the curtain and then the sight was restored. Since these explanations I hav had a very high respekt for my eyes and for sience too. I learned the whole bisness as well in- 20ominets as if I had studid eyes for a year, and I've seriously thought it my duty to open an eye- shop at home, just for the sake of sufferin' human- ity. The Doktor remarked that some folks learned a heap quicker than others, and I thought at the time he was alludin' to me. Eyes, I think, is my specialty--my fort. I've always had a mekanikal eye, and my mother says I cut my eye-teeth easier than any of the boys. Next mornin he set the Genrul up in a big bar- bers chair, and techin a spring it laid down with him just like it had sense, and the Doktor propped his lids open with a parcel of small wire crowhars, and he told the Genrul to look down all the time. Then he cut into:his eye-ball with about as much indifference as he would have cut into the- eye of a potater, and as the Genrul flinched he told him to look down.  The Genrul says, "I am looking down."  "No  you are not," says the Doktor.  "I tell you I am " says the Genrul. The Doktor cut away a  lick or two and says: "Genrul if you don't look down your eye will be ruined." A' I'm looking down all I can," says the Genrul. ( I've lost control of my optic nerve. I believe you would expect a man to look down if you was cut- ,     .   Of .   BILL ARP VISIT'S GOTHAM.   255 ting-his head off." The Doktor says, "I'll have to give you chloroform." The Genrul says "I won't take it-go on with your butchering." Well, it was perhaps the funniest quarrel you ever heard ; but the Doktor went on, and throwin down his. knife, he took another little instrument and dug round inside that eye-ball like he was picking the goodies out of a hickory nut. Then he took sum bull dog pinchers and pulled that cataract out shore. He took the curtain from behind that wii-  dow in a jiffey, and then turned the Genrul over to the tender care of Mrs. Bryan and Miss Banks, sisters and ladies of Charleston, who have charge of the hospital. Their kindness and-attention to the Doktor's patients is equalled only by their re- finement of manners and their Confedrit indepen- dence. Born rich and raised rich, they did not hesitate as to their duty when the crash of the war - wiped out their property, and they gladly akcepted the offer so kindly made em by Dr. Chisolm. I willjump over a fortnight just now to-say- that the operation was a grand success and the Genrul is at home pursuin his daily avokations as in days of yore, full of thanks to God and gratitude to sci- ence and Dr. Chisolm. The doctor showed me a  bottle full of cataracts floating about in spirits like little milky peas, and I couldent help thinking  how much of gloomy helpless and melonkolly night had been turned into joyful day by the teachins of *              "3  ;   256    BILL ARP VISITS GOTETHM. science and the- skillful knife of this eminent sur- geon. Arrivin at the Grand Hotel in New York I reg- istered my name, and purty soon a white Irishman took my baggage and said " this way sur." I fol- lerd him into a little room about 8 feet square with a carpet on the floor and two sofas settin on the sides, I had no idee what he put me in there fer. There wasent a sine of a bed nor a winder nor a table. I set down and waited for him, to come -back. It struck me that perhaps this was a little reseption room, and he was agoin to brush off my clothes or clean up my boots so that I wouldent dirty up the fine room I was to sleep in. He comrn back in a minit and the room giv a trimble and as I looked out I saw the ballance of the house agoin, down. Thinks I theres arabian nights and genii about this place shore, but I never let on. - All at once it flashed all over me that I was in a elevator and I felt intensely releeved. The white Irishman carried me up about half a mile, more or les, and put me in my- little bed and I went to sleep. Next mornin I dressed up as fine as possibul and went out of my room to look round-sorter on a skout-and to see about gittin down stairs. I found the hole I cum up in, but there wasent no- body about it, and seein sum stairs I cautiously -went down 'em to a floor, and seein another pair I went down again, and so on and so forth and' so on, till I was down. Watchin around I saw foaks   B IZ ARP VISITS GOTHAM:    257  buyin. newspapers and then goin into a room, which I perseeved was the eatin room with a few hun- dred little tables in it, more or less. So I bought me a Herald and walked in, and another white Irishman with a gal's apron on showed me to a seat. I picked out a few things on the bill of fare, and then told him to bring me-anything else he thought I would like. He was gone a-right smart while,vbut he did bring me an elegant breakfast. I did think that Spanish mackerel vas the best thing I ever did eat. If there is anything in the world that I'm a judge of its vittals, and that's why I mention such things so often. I was tellin Gim. Anderson that day about that breakfast, and he 'looked at me sorter quizzikul, and sez he, "Bill, you know that house is kept on the Uropean plan?"  "What's that?" sed I.  "Why the more you order the more you pay for. I expekt that breakfast cost you two or threedollars." Yes siree, and that's xactly what it did cost,. $2 75, as I found out when I settled my bill. I mention it as a warnin to all peepul to find out the plan of your tavern before yoiu order your breakfast. Startin out purty early as a foot skout I made' for Broadway, and in,the course of two hours I got to the City Hall Park and saw the new rock post office a loomin up with its hat off. I axed a big dubble brested poleesman how much it would cost. He sed he dident know exactly -but he thought about as much as it could-that it was a sorter of                             / 258   B BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM. a cash Mobilier. Seein a crowd about the Mayor's ,   s  z office I slipped upon em unawares and found em all mad as the dikence. Pickin out an Irishman (I always pick out an Irishman) ses I, "What seems to be the trouble?" "It's the domd nagur polees," ses he. "They talk about mixin up the black andthe white togither and it cant be dun in this town. The first nagur that wears a shtar and a shillaly will' hav his domd head smashed into a smithhreen-and that's all." "{ Is it the sivil rites bill thats workin like a medisin?" says I. "Dom the sivil rites bill,' says he. "It niver was a bill for nuork-it was a bill for the domd rebels and they shant send their black nagurs up here. Nuork is a republican government-,so it is." Suspektin that he knew me I slipped away to anothlercrowd and they was all cussin the niggers and the injuns and shokin and shoknasty and the modoks and the hethen chinee. I heard a man talking furiously, and he sed he was a Genrul Grant Republican and this was a white mans country. About this time a big man with a low boosum cum out of the Mayors- house and spoke. He sed he was instrukted to say that it was all a mistake-there wasent no nigger polees nor never would be-that they had only employed a few dar- keys to clean up sum assafidity--that had been thrown in the rear of the tooms. The crowd then giv three cheers and dispersed to their respective drinkin places.   BIZL ARP VrSITS GOTHAM.    259 Squeezin my way along down towards Wall street to see the big gamblers corner on cotton tg^bcagold, I saw a- buryin ground through the crack of a fence and -several hundred old dingy brown toomb stones a: standin around. Most all of em was ornamented with pikters of little boys' faces with their cheeks swelld out like they was blowin little toot-horns at the foaks that went by. A man sed they was old fashund angels and that most of these peepul died a hundred and fifty years ago. I wasent aware that any body had been ded that long, but suppose it is so. There was a meetin house in the yard and it took me sometime to see to the top of the steerpul; They sed it-was built at the head of Wall street so as to be a witness agin the gamblers in the day of -judg- ment. When I got down to Mr. Drexels new marble bank I saw a- few thousan peepul standin still and lookin up at the top of a nine story house. Purty soon a chunk of a boy stood up in the highest winder. He had sum straps buckeld under his arms and- a big tape line rolled up in a spring in his-hand and the other end tied to sumthing inside of the room. Suddenly he stepped off into the atmosferejust like he was a ghost and the tape line cum slowly out of'the spring and he floated down to the ground like a feather. Then the crowd all give a cheer and dispersd. They told me it was a new fire eskape and was to be put in ,?A   -2-60  BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM. all the hotels and high buildings so that in case of a -fire anybody could fasten one end of the bed- stead and the other under his arms and leap fourth with perfekt impunity. I think it a good invenshun and would like to see it tried in a-shore enuf fire. -Wouldent- it look-entirely angelik of a moonlite night to see sum of the fair sex takin a sail from the ninth story of the Grand Hotel, with their natral hair all flowin and their white nite gowns all fluttrin in the breeze, wouldent it be a humane ok- kupation for a kind harted man like myself to ketch em as they cum-to take them on the wing-to I reseeve em with open arms and an affectionate em- -brace. I think so-exceptin perhaps sum dutch angel weighin about 200 pounds, more or less, and the bedstead cumin along down with her. Under such sirkumstances it would perhaps be prudent to stand from under. Greatly to my delite, I met with my old friend, -George Williams, on away down William street. He was just from the city of Charlston, where he rains as a king, and was in a very happy frame of mind--I mean financially. I knowd George in Nacoochy sum  thirty years ago when he used to -work like a nigger in a little corn patch on the side of the hill and carried water in a big soap goard to keep his truck from burning up with the drowth. He was always hard workin, and a mighty liberal man akkordin to his means. He  is liberal yet, but in spite of all he can do his money will ak-                       . *   BILL ARP VISITS a-GOTHAM.   261     - kumulate faster than he can give it away. I'm - afeerd this worries him and it does look like a pity to see-a man so discumfitted with money in his declinin years. Considerin that he is a Georgy Methodist I hav thought he might build em a col- lege in Nacoochee jest to spite old Vanderbilt in . - Tennessee. Ive no doubt he will do it if he ever thinks of it. I notised that he was quite thin in the flesh and remarked that it was a favorable sircumstance for he could cum nigher goin through that needle's eye the scripters tell about when the ; time cometh. That thing has bothered me so all my life Ive been afeerd to lay up any money. The truth ' is, however, I have never had a chance as yet and the prospekt for the future is mortal dim. George says that money is all vanity and vexation of spirit, and the way he talked about the trubble and the care that it brings I know he would have cheerfully given me a few thousan dollars if he hadent had such a high regard for my family. He was afeird- it would prove a burden instead of a blessin. He .. . sed that when he was up on a visit to his Nacoochy farm last Summer, he put on some old clothes  and an old hat, and started on a- tramp around the  plantation. Gettin tired after a while, he set down, on a log by the side of the road and a man- cum - along with an ox wagin, and ses he, "a Mornin,   . - sur." "Good mornin, ses George: "Do you     ^- work for Geo. W. Williams?"' "Yes, sir," says   -; George. "How  much does he give you a; a,   - 262    BILL ARP VISITS GOTH4AM. *y *? ',         a :year?'" "My vittels .and clothes, and tobakker, and pays my doktor's bills," says George. "How long have you been workin for him that way?" -"About 30 years," says George. "Well, you are an oldi fool, and that's jest the way the stingy old cuss has made all1his money.- Good mornin, sir ;" and he popped his bark whip and drove on. In the course of time I got back to my tavern and after havin feasted on sum more Spanish mackerel and a'few etseteras, I went round to Mr. Booth's theater to see Miss Nilson play her great peece. The music was purty good I reckon though I think if they could hear Uncle Jack :. - ,Beasly play the Arkansaw Traveller on his old fiddle one time that band would pine away and die of mortifycashun. I'm sorry to say I dident see Nilson, but there -was a sweet little oman cum out on the stage called Amy Robsart that carried me away up into the heavens and let me down easy every few minets. Onst or twist a big ruffin got mad with her and: dragd her about the stage in her night close and I felt like I ought, for the sake of humanity, knock the day lights out of the ihfernal broot; but- I didn't. I got so sorry for her I cried, and I felt like I could jest choke the juice out of any man that dared to laff at my tears. A clever ;- : .manl settin by-me told me it was only aktin, and: that the same thing had been going on every night on ;that stage for two months. I told him:I didn't - - keer,:that I knowd they hurt that gal a draggin her:   -               a .. - o ;  BILL ARP VISITS GOT-HAM.   263  about with no close -on hardly-that she didn't hav; no iron clad body, and looked to me like she was ' as tender all round as a suckin fawn. I saw Queen  Lisabeth struttin about in hifolootin style. She - was a game oman and a grand one, and it done me good way down to my -aikle bones when she took my poor Amy's part. But after while they got the- poor girl in another trap, and fixed up a bridge for her to cross, and there was a snappin spring in the middle .of the bridge, and when she crossed it it : f ' was to break right in two, and she was to fall down- into a deep whirlpool and get drownd. I shall al- ways feel- thankful for the privilege of- sayin that  though the bridge busted my Amy didn't fall. No,  sur-she didn't-and she's alive yet I reckon unless . they hav wore her plum out a draggin' her about. , If they don't quit it I., wouldn't giv much for' the meat that's on her second jint bones. Durin'the play the -Queen had a festival show. About fifty young girls cum out with torches in their hands and danced around with no close on scarcely except - a few mermaid fish skales shingled up to the middle of their bodies, and a. small invisible quantity of fuss and feathers sorter hiden- their palpitatinr :: boozums. They danced 'and they pranced and. they reeld and they squeeld and they wriggled and they giggled until everybody seemed satisfied -and :: then they-went up sum marble'steps and marched  away over a mountin and I never saw: em any  more. On the whole I think that .liked the shoiO . - v:  c ss I'.; lt   264   BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM. ::t:, only I'm sorry I dident see Nilson. Her pikter ;   that I saw in the winders all over town was power- fully like that poor little Amy and I expect she is sum kin to her. Next mornin I went down to my publisher's, under the Fifth Avenue Hotel. Mr. G. W. Carle- ton, the book publisher was there and said he thought he knowd me, and when I told him my V name he sed he recomemberd readin sum of my letters-wich I writ Mr. Linkhorn along time ago- sed Mr. Linkhorn or sumbody else showd em to him he wasent sertin which. He had a big book store under the hotel and there was a power of nice +   people a peroosin around. He introduced me to  '  Mr. Elie P. Perkins, Esq., with the -first P. left out. He sed that Elie spelt his name with a small e and a big lie and was known in the citty as Big lie Perkins. They sed he was the sucksessor to Arte- i mus Wards wax works and from the way he is pilin up money I suppose his wax works well." I like Elie. I always was partial to white men, and hes the whitest man I saw in New York. The next man I saw was Josh Billings.. He was a sad lookin man with a large, open countenance, and wore his hair all- over his head and neck like a Canadian , : pony? I suppose :that ine and him will always - differ about wearing our hair.  About this time a very large man with a white cravat cum in to see Mr, Carleton, and axd him how he liked-his manu- - skript, and Mr. Carleton sed it was too heavy, and *' '- -         .              ,    BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM.    265 he axd Carleton if he meant ther was too much .  of it. He laffed, and sed no; but that there was most too much led in it-that he would advise him to go to Skribner or Lippincott--that he only pub- lished such books as the people would read. The large man looked thoughtful and disappointed, and takin his manuskript, went clean away. The title of his book was "The Metaforik Analasis of Kim-  erean Abstroosities." Next a little frisky man with a lively, open countenance cum along, and axd Mr. Carleton what he thought of his book. ' Don't suit me exactly," sed Mr. Carleton, I its a -most too light, too much froth for the syllabub, don't think it would go." The title of his book was "The Ting-a-Ling of Aunt Tabbys Door Bell." I was sorry for the big man and sorry for the little man, and told Mr. Carleton I thought he ought to let 'em down easy. He said it was an every days business, and he had got hardened to it--that he rejekted ten books to where he aksepted one, and 'he published a good deal of trash even' then. Dis-  likin to disagree with him 'on so short an akwan- tance, VI sed "Yes, I think you do." Next mornin I seed in the Heraldthat a grand moral question was -to be tried that day involvin the rights of women, and that Soosan Antny would be heard from. Now. Soosan Antny aint, nuthin  - to me-that is nuthin pertikler. No woman aint exsep Mrs. Arp, but when I heard they was a tryin her for votin, my feminine instinks carried me 12 -   } ' -   ,'     - ,- 266   BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM. straight to the court house. I was on her side be- fore I got there and :I'm on her side yit. Women in general is my weakness and espeshually a woman whose name is Soosan. I always envied a man who could fondle over his wife or his sweetheart and call her "Soosy". It sounds so meller and soft. So when I seed Soosan Antny arrained up before the judge like a konvict I was mad-mad with. the whole Yanky nashun. They raise a hel- lybilloo over the old broken konstitution and mend it up so as to let the black babboons vote in the rebbel States, but if a white woman of sense and ':  spunk dares to do it, it shocks their pewritan mod- esty. , The old Judge tried to look' fierse and said a woman shouldn't undersex herself. I have seen a heap of men who when they got sorter old, took up a sour-grape spite against good lookin women. But Soosan looked at the Judge as straight as an egul. She stood up square on her paster joints and remarked that she was free-born and nativ- born and had property of her own, and had a right to vote for the law makers of her choice. She said that women done as much for the country as the men, and if they didn't fight in a battle they raised the boys that did. That havin. em -and nursin em and tendin to em in sikness and in helth was a harder job than fitin, and if the men dident believe it jest let em try it awhile. She, sed if the Judge could name one good reesun why they shouldent vote she wanted to know it,   -  s/ I ,    r- ' BILL ARP VISITS GOTHAM.   26 Soosan's eyes flashed a little- angelik fire when the Judge fined her a. hundred dollars, and she're- marked that every advanse in sivilization had to have its martyrs, and she was reddy. She throwd a hundred dollar bill over to the clerk, and sed she would bet another hundred that that money never reached the State Treasury. She dident mind that  old Judge no more than if he was a monkey. She told him that if they would base the votin bisness on, morality, or property, or intelligence, or all three put together, the women'would be satisfide; but they based it on" wearin britches,-and drinkin whisky, and chawin tobakker, and :1eepin one wife at home and another sum where else.' She de- clared that she had as much ritfe to choose her po- litikul masters as the Suthern niggers: or the hethen Chinee. That if the' women could vote there wouldent be a drunkard, nor a thief, nor a fool on -the bench, nor in any other offis, and whisky would be harder to get than arsenik. An old, red nosed, swell faced man winked one eye at her and hik- kuped " the h-he- hell you say." When the court adjourned the crowd cheered Soosy, and one man sed he'd pay the fine;, another sed hie'd-see her. a A fair fite with the Judge ; another sed the law dident say whether the britches must be worn outside or' - inside, and another sed he'd rather risk the women-  to, vote than thousands of the drunken furriners . and fools who elekted John Mors ey. ' Now I've been thinkin -a heap about this votin   2268  BLL ARP VISITS GOTHAM.       . "bisness myself, and my opinyun ar that Gov. Jinkins is a mity smart man.

He was for drawin in the lines insted of letten-em out, and the melankolly sequel , 'hav proved that he wer right. If I was a king I  wooldent let anybody vote who couldent tell  -whether Generul Jackson was ded or alive, orwho took more than three drinks a day as a regular thing, or who chawd tobaker after he had gone to bed, or who was a meaner man than his daddy, or ' -1 who believed-in gosts and witches, or who dident  put on a clean shirt onst a week, or who dident earn 50 cents a day at sum respektabel bisness, or who shouted at nite meetins more than two hours on a stretch; I heard a blind freenologist say that the way to test a-man's sense was to draw a strait line from the top of his upper lip 'to his forrerd and another from the lower corner of his nose to :the hole in his ear, and if the angle between was less than 60 degrees he might be smart 'for a monky but he was a fool for a man. He sed that this test would rule out nearly all the idiots and Afrikins from votin, and if it dident their faith in witches would. I wouldent let a furrinervote until he had lived here and behaved himself for ten years, and he shouldent vote then unless he had married an amerikan gal or was a' raisin children on amerikan soil. I wouldent let no unmarried man vote who    BILL ARP VISITS GO TAM.    269  ' -t ,                   . was over 30 years old; though I would let all sich  justify by swearin that-they had tried but nobody would have em. I'd maker em name the gals in their affidavit. - I would let every married man and his wife and every widder vote if they wasn't cut off by the foregoin exceptions. They should have one vote apiece for themselves and one for every child they had. This last would elevate the Arpian lfamily  ;, about elektion times shore. Akkording tO Solo- mon, all sich ought to hav a heap of privileges, for it ain't no pikayune bisiness to raise a big drove of children.- Jest let any hide-bound bachelor try it and see. I look upon respektable children as the hope of the State, and if I had my way-these stagnant -old rips who-won't marry, but prowl round and live easy and die rich and leave no sign, at least none to speak of, should be taxed heavy. ; : and the money appropriated to the orfins' fund. What's a man worth to the State who leaves it'no defenders after he's ded and gone; who patronizes no Sundy- schools or Mundy schools-buys no candy or: baby clothes, or balls, or barlow knives, or long stockins, or jackonet muslin, ,or hoop skirts ? or galluses. What intrust has he got in perpetuatin great principles? . Why, a chronick .old bachelor can jest turn over in his one-horse bed and die'and  not keer a darn if the world cums to an end in 15 - minutes.- He wouldent keer if the devil was to  - break loose and eat up the women and children alive.   27Q    BI-LL ARP VISITS GOTHAM. Now Im not sayin a word agin them married foaks who sumhow or sumhow else haint aksiden- tally been blessed with offspring. By no means. They showd a willingness to hav em and thats enuf for me. -I've always apologized for peepul who done the best they could, whether they suck- seeded or not. I aint no Bonyparte to chop a mans head off for losin a battle, whether he was to blame or not. Im a frend to married foaks, chil- dren-or no children. Lawful wedlock is sosietys main spring-its back bone-its life inshoorance. I've no patience with these stingy old stags who wont imarry without they git a pile of penshun money, who want to be hired to do it, who hang around a town waitin for sum rich gal to turn up, while theres lots of poor ones, purty and clever, just', waitin to take shoogar in them. Now I don't want to be misunderstood about this votin bisness. I ain't in favor of women mixin up with skalawags and trash at the polls. By no means. I want the moral strength and influence of their votes bekaus they are better and purer and honester than the men, but I would hev em to stay at home and let their husbends, or their fathers, or their next friend vote for em as the case may be. If a man fooled his wife out of her vote it wouldent be exactly the clean-thing, but it would be a family matter, and nobody's bisness. It wouldent be the only thing that some men fool em about. There's strong minded women and weak minded men, and ,f, . . , . '                   RZLL ARP VISITS GOTHAM..   27I in such cases I would let the longest pole knock down the persimmon. The time used to was when a married woman dident hav no voice in nuthin--  exsept makin baby clothes. She couldent own  any property-she had no sivil existence. If any' body give her anything the law required a man to v keep it for her. If she couldent liv-with adrunken husban and quit him the law giv him all the chil- dren. But as the world grows older she keeps a steppin up higher. Now she can own as- much property as anybody, and she-can make a will, and in sum States set on a jewry, and in 9 cases out of 10 she gets the children whenh-there is a: divorce. Sum of em are studyin medisin and make the best sort of doctors for women, and for children a half hour old and under. They do clerkin and book- keepin and telegraphin and printin, and can keep a post offis better than a man and never steal a sent. If they do peep into other women's letters its only out of kurosity, and they always seal em up again. Take it altogether it looks to me like the time has mity nigh cum when the men hav got to admit that a woman is just as good as a man if not better in most everything that requires more sense than muscel. I wont say she ort to vote if she don't want to, but I do say that no politishun could buy her vote with a drink. BILL ARP. THE END.   NEW BOOKS   AND NEW EDITIONS, RECENTLY ISSUED BY   G W.
