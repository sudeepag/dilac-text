THE "Grave-yard" and the "Meeting-house " of the days gone by, contrasted with the Cemetery and the Sanctuary of to-day, are no doubtfill declaration of the age of Puritanical severity, and dogmatical strife, which has given place to an era of Christian union and brotherly love. In the olden time no blossoms were planted where the dead were sleeping, and no grounds were laid out with mounds, ravines, and running streams. The place was only a "Grave-yard," surrounded with a rough stone wall, within which bushes and brambles grew in rank luxuriance. But to-day, the army of flowers with its bright and beautiful banners, has charged upon the thorny hosts of bramble, bush, and briar, and driving ,them from "God's-acre," has set a guard of Statuary at the gates of the Cemetery. The Church Edifice, with its order and appointments, is still more expressive of THE PAST and THE PRESENT. Who does not remember the Meeting-house, where in childhood he used to sit in solemn awe, and reverently i listen to a sermon, which he could not understand; and if an attempt was made to slip away into the land of dreams how the timely jog, or sober shake by the hand of one ever watchful for his spiritual growth would in- stantly bring him back again to the holy service. The VII   57ni       INTRODUCTION. pews with their high paneled partitions and their iron bolts! and the pulpit! that awful place, where stood a huge tub, perched high upon a plain post, around which a spiral stairway led in mysterious windings from the floor to the preacher's lofty station, far above the heads of the congregation. (The minister was very much " looked up to" in those old times.) Higher still the broad "Sounding board," at once a cover and a peril to the good man beneath it. The whole scene sug- gesting the idea of the candle of the Lord in a wooden candle-stick, with an "extinguisher" above it, ever threatening to fall, and put out the light. Or that invention of later date,-yet to be found here and there in the land,-representing a mighty fortress,s itself like the towering tub, "high and lifted up,"' far from the reach of the nearest foe; a sure defence, from behind which the gospel warrior could-fire his doctrinal guns with perfect impunity. . In that old Meeting-houso no sound of instrumental music was ever heard: and no odor of sweet flowers everl known, unless perchance on a summer Sabbath day some fragrant evangelist should steal in unseen from the' neighboring fields, and silently 'exhort the solemn assembly to " consider the lilies.' But a boquette of flowers upon "the sacred desk!"It would have been sacrilege itself. In the church to-day the backs of the seats are so low that the worshippers can see each other and shal]e hands of fellowship if they so desire ; while the pew doors are gone altogether. I The preacher's discourse is no longer " a tale of a tab.", The champion of truth no more fights the good fight from behind a barricade. The pulpit has made way for the platform: vases of flowers adorn the simple stand; and the sound   'NTl'lODUCTION."       I of " stringed instruments and organs" mingles with the voices of the choir and tho congregation. --The high- backed people have gone with the Mgh-backed pews, and the sharpness of sectarian controversy has disappeared with the briars and the brambles. The beautiful Ceme- tery, clad in garments of gladness, is the daughter of the Sanctuary, and both are but an outward declara- tion of the spirit of the ago in which we live. It is useless to attempt to call back the past. We cannot detain the shadows of the night when all the eastern hills are singing- - "The morning light is breaking, The darkness disappears." - - A man may shut himself in his own darkened room' but the sun will steadily rise I He can stop the clock, but he cannot stay the advancing foot-steps of time! What battles have been fought in by-gone years be- tween contending hosts in the Army   of the Lord! "Calvinists" and "Arminians"' "Old-School"  and "New-School"' Presbyterians, Baptists and Pedo-Bap- tfists! In that day of doctrinal strife, each sturdy war- rior looked upon his antagonist as a man arrayed in the armor of, dangerous and deadly error,;and felt that: victory in controversy was the triumph of righteous- ness over sin. Satan must have laughed to see the soldiers of Christ fightinog each other, with weapons given them by their great Captain to dobattloe against the hosts of evil..; What would have been thought in that day of the brotherly" bands and Christian Unions seen to-day all over the broad land? Methodists and Presbyterians, IEpiscopalians;- Baptistsi and "all other branches of the Church of Christ-" oNE IN THE LORD." The-sectarian batle ,fieldsof the past, are the Gospel   S        . -IMTODUCTION. wheatfields of to-dy. But have denominational lines disappeared? No. They exist, and their existence is the strength and efficiency of the church. But those lines are fast losing their sharpness and severity, bathed as they are in the mellow light of love. LOVE is stronger than LOGIC.- Where, in the " one army of the living God," may tho glorious old Baptist Church lbe found? Her soldiers to-day stand shoulder to shoulder with the other hosts of Israel in the common battle; her trumpets give " a certain sound," and the foe confesses her power. What is the position of the Baptist, Church? 1, NOMNALLY? 2, ACTUALLY? In common with all branches of the Church of Christ, she declares Baptism to be the door of the Visible    Church; the order of the Lord's house. She firmly    X maintains, and joyfully proclaims immersion only to be  Baptism, as she points to the Lord- of glory rising from : the waves of Jordan; or repeats the declaration of tho great Apostle in his letter to the Romans. She insists ' upon the trinity of duty-Repentance, Faith, and Bap-  X tism-and urges with a zeal " according to knowledge,"  the necessity of a complete obedience.         M What is the LoGICAL attitude of the Baptist Church  - in relation to her sister churches? It is briefly this :-  A Church is composed of baptized believers. Immersion onlyis Baptism. Therefore there is actually no Church l on earth but the Baptist. The Church alone has power  to administer the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, there- e fore the table can only be spread in the Baptist Church. Baptism being the door of the Church in which the Supper only can be found, a disciple of Christ unbaptized, no matter .what may be his growth in grace, has no   INTEODUCTIOX.  right to tho table of the Lord; and tho Church being the guardian of that table, it is her sacred duty to see that only the worthy shall partake of the feast. Logic demands that the law shall be In all cases enforced. 'The officer of tho church has no discretion, no election in the matter. To allow an unbaptized person to partake of the Supper, though he be pure as the saintly Payson or Chalmers, is a willful violation of the law of the Lord. Still farther, for a Baptist to sit down at the Lord's Supper (" so called ") in any other Church (" so called,") is giving fellowship and countenance to the disobedient, and shall subject the offender to the discipline of the Church.  Such is the profession of the great Baptlst  Church in America to-day.  What is the result of this logic? What are the fruits of this theological tree?  Thousands upon thousands of trte disciples of Christ, believing that only immersion is baoptism, have sought   ] refuge and home in the pedo-baptist church. The Baptist : Church is a great feeder, continually pouring into other Churches, the strength-spiritual, mental and financial, that she herself needs. It is an offence too great to be 1 borne in this day of Christian Union, to separate among , tho blood-washed disciples of a common Saviour, hus- bands from wives -parents from children-brothers irom sistcrs, because of a doctrinal distinction; and to foribid  fhose who have knelt at the same cross, to sit at the same able. What is the SPIRIT and actual PRACTIOE of the Bap-    a ist Church, in this day of gospel liberty?   She, in omMOn with all- branches of the Church, has learned nd adopted the dialect of love. She daily speaks of ther denominations, as "sister churches in Clhrist."   ;i --:  X   XII        INTRODUCTION. She gives hearty fellowship to all who love Jesus ip all the glorious enterprises of holy benevolence, which so signally distinguish this day. But what of the Lord's Supper? The Baptist Church declares, that while no," thus sanit the Lord," nor the law of example, as declared in the upper chamber in Jerusa- lem, may enforce the doctrine of baptism, as a pre- requtisite to the Lord's Supper: and while she acknow- ledges that her only argument is an inference, (and the Bible-loving Baptist is justly suspicious of a11 inferential arguments) yet baptism is and ever has been, since the day of the Apostles, the order of' Christ's house. But this usage of the Church, she will not, and does not to-day enforce, by maling her officers to act, as a police, in removing from the gospel banqueting Chamber, the humble disciple of Christ, who, though ignorant in doc- trine, but obedient in heart, has honestly taken his place at the Lord's table. Shepractically leaves the privilege of afeast (established byHTim whose death it commemorates before the Church was erected) to the Conscience of the Communicant. She says with Ellen Hart-"-Let him eat, and teach him the way to the sacred river after- ward." This is the SPIRIT and PRACTICE Of the vast majority of Baptist' Churches to-day. The scene described in this book, as occurring in the Evansdale Church, in the forcible expulsion of old Deacon Saybrook of the Presby- terian Church, from the Lord's table, belongs to a past age. The Baptist minister who would so enforce the law now, would peril his position in the Church, and publish himself to be full fifty years behind the day of gospel liberality in which he lives. Yes, the Baptist Church practically says of the pedo-baptist disciple found within   INTRODUCTION.        III her territory-" let him feed undisturbed in the green pastures, which are beside -"the still waters," rather than drive him with ecclesiastical clubs to the distant hills; and by this discipline of holy charity, he will find his way into the glorious river before many moons shall lhave passed by." THE DUTY of to-day, is to bring our PROFESSION, by open declaration, into harmony with our PRACTICE. To announce THE LORD'S SUPPER , and declare, in the language of Paul to the Church in Corinth, "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat." Leavo the privi- lege of the feast with the conscience of the communicant and to Christ, the only governor of the banquet, and to whom, and not to the Church, the disciple is to answer for the act. This is the PRACTICE and SPIRIT of the Church; LET IT BE HER PUBLISHED PnROFESSION. Then will the multitude of disciples who believe that immersion only is baptism, remain in their true and  natural home, the Baptist Church.  Mr. Hart is right--the world is moving! the Church is moving!' It is a  day of holy brotherhood; of gospel kindred, when the saints are looking rather for points of agreement and  christian fellowship, than opportuni- ties and advantages of conflict. And ther6 is coming, by the way. of the Sabbath School, an innumerable host- "an army with banners "-and LIGHT, LIBERTY and LOVE are their watchwords. They have been taught that aH who lovo Jesus are brethren of one household, and it -ill be impossible to imprison those soldiers in the close ' and cold cells of sectarianism. The author of this book is proud of a name and a place in the Baptist Church, and glories in an ordinance   XIV        INTRODUCTION. which has the sanction and example of his diving Miaster. An ordinance which is at once HSTORICAL, DECLAR- ATIVE and PRnoPHEr'llC-telling of the Burial and Resur- rection of Christ; declaring the Christian's burial from the world and resurrection into the new Kingdom; and prophetic of his burial in the earth and his resurrection at the last day. In common with all Baptists, he declares baptism to be the door of the visible church, and claims the supper as the holy feast spread in the house of the Lord. But in the spirit of Christ-in the spirit of gospel- liberality, which now so generally pervades the Church- a spirit which is rapidly advancing to a complete and glorious victory-he will, if he finds an humble disciple at the supper of the Lord, unbaptized, neither turn him from the table, or withhold the cup and the bread from him, but rather Jet him eat and teach himn the way to Jordan afterward. "To his own Master he standeth or falleth." LET A MAN EXAMINE HIMSELF, AND SO LET HIM EAT, HAVING THE ANSWER OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE TOWARD GOD." To set in contrast the bigotry of the Church, in an age fast passing away, with the liberality and love of the present day, I have told the story of TnE BAPTIST CHURCH OF EVANSDALE.    -CiAPTER I. -THE9 POOR OPENING. THE world is moving!" exclaimed Mr. Hart, as he sat one morning reading a New York paper, in Deacon Roberts' parlor, with Ellen Roberts sitting at his side. "The world is moving! What changes in Church and State! The Bible open in Papal Spain! Papacy extending the courtesy of a Catholic graveyard to a Protestant corpse! Think of that, Ellen I -in old, heretic-burning Spain. The age of miracles has returned. I read here in my Times, that in Havana, ., a Protestant dying, his body is allowed Christian burial in L consecrated ground.' See Austria, too-' the right arm of the Pope,' building school-houses for the educa- tion of the common people: Light is breaking through the darkened windows of Cathedrals, and knowledge- the grand  Iconoclast-is going forth in the Pope's dominions, to break tho imagres of papacy. Then," continued le, "look into the Protestant world, and see how the men of different creeds are steadily getting nearer each other. The old days of bitter doctrinal warfare are passing away. "There is a story, of two knights who met on a com- mon highway, where was a way-side shield, surmounted by a cross. The knights--so runs the story-made a halt; the one on the one side, and the other on the ' other side of the shield.  Said one,' this is a beautiful   16       TH- E DOOR OPENING, silver shield, Sir Knight!' '-It is a beautiful shield, fair Knight,' said the other, 'but its face is gold and not silver!' ' Pardon,' replied the first, 'pardon Sir tnight, it is silver and not gold, this face of the shield! ' That was enough-with visors down, and lances in rest, they rushed upon each other in deadly combat. In the conflict, each fell with a mortal wound; and in the fall, the combatants changed placer N' owr, as they both lay bleeding upon the ground, each looked up at the strange cause of their fatal battle and, behold, the shield had two faces; one of silver and one of gold! The advocate of the silver side, looked upon the golden face, and the advocate of the golden side, saw the silver face. Each learned, that his oppo- nent was at once right, and wrong, and with tho lesson, died. In this day," said Mr. Hart, " the double-faced shield is getting to be understood, and the battle is waived, where our fathers'broke many a lance. "It is a practical age, and the church is to make progress, I think, by going back to they day of Christ and the Apostles. There' must be different churches in tho One Church. "Men looking through different eyes, at the same common sun! Two men may look up at the full moon-- to one, it is the size of a cart-wheel; and to the other, it appears no larger than one of Grandmother Avery's bright pewter plates. But thereo need be no quarrel. Each knows it is the moon, and each equally enjoys its light.  "Yes, Ellen, the churches are moving, and, do you know, I, as a good Baptist, sometimes ask myself the question, are there any steps for us to take?

' "]But still I say, I often think, is there notMng for the Baptist to do, in this year of our Lord, 1869? We  hold the great Bible doctrines. The denomination, in our own land, numbers its hosts by hundreds of thous- ands, Oer a million of soldiers for Christ, rally under its glorious standard. . Its missionaries are carrying the cross to all the darkened corners of the earth. "Ellen," exclaimed Mr. Hart, "I could wish that one great barrier between us and other churches was broken down! if it was consistent with truth, that we could meet all--yes, every soul that loves Jesus, every Creed -and Nation, every Church and Covenant, if so be they acknowledge Christ as the Divine Saviour, and worship at the foot of His cross--meet all, at one common, glory ious banquet. I know this is heresy, and, if your good father should hear of it, I should no more hope to unite my destinies with a Baptist deacon's daughter." "' Why, Ed," said Ellen, " and do you renounce close communion? we are quite as liberal," she added, "as those who daily taunt us with bigotry." They require baptism, as a   pre-requisite to the Lord's Table, and so do Moe. They judge what baptism is, and so do we. They think it one thing; we think it another." "All true," said Mr. Hart, "I have gone over that a thousand times. The battle is ours on that",ground. But, my dear, we should go back of all that, to the only standard.

Now, Ellen, just exactly there I am, this day-an enquirer. I dare look for myself, and act for myself, and the man who dare not, is a coward; and the man, who will not, for fear of new light, is a bigot. It is the impulse of my heart, to be very close corn- munion. I want to get closer to the Methodist, the Presbyterian, the Episcopalian-to every disciple of Christ.

"I alvays used to love to read the proclamation in my Yankee home, ending :-' Godl bless the Common- wealth of M1assachusetts.' And I feel a healthy exercise of soul, in saying :--God bless the Commonwealth of the Church of Christ! "One thing I do know, Ellen," said Mr. Hart, " tho day of controversy is past,- if the church would hold her proper place in this matter-of-fact age. "The world 'is asking, and has a right to ask of the professed representatives of the DMan of Nazareth, what t are your credentials? Give us proofs of your mission to men! Not arguments-Acts!

If this is treason, let the Evansdale Church make the most of it! "I am a Baptist, Ellen," continued Mr. Hart, "and as such, I shall take my place, next Lord's day, at the table, but I feel, as I have no doubt multitudes of good Baptists do feel, a desire to extend the boundary of our denominational tabernacle-to ' lengthen the cords and strengthen the stakes.' I am a [Baptist, but I would leave the question of communion with the conscience of thie commnunicant. "The Cross of Christ is the grand and glorious centre around which all the blood-washed can gather; and the Table is the manifest declaration of that Cross. Nay, of the Table-not the hill, not the tree,-Christ declares: 'This is my body, broken for you!' The right to the Cross, is the right to the Table. He who has been to the one, may go to the other. Men, in all ages, have attempted to fence within their own creed, the purchased salvation of Calvary; and, discovering that only a chosen few could be saved, it has ever happened, that they invariably have found their own good names on the limited roll of the electf "Ellen, every sinner has equal access to, the broken body and shed blood.

Walter Burden, was an able minister of the gospel, and a great favorite in the village, being in the best sense, popular, both in, and out of his pulpit. While holding his creed fjrmly, and, at proper times, contending for it stoutly, he ever lived upon the most intimate terms of Christian fellowship with men of all shades of faith. He recognized in every man engaged in any service having for its end the benefit of society, a companion and a brother; "the fellowship of labor," as he loved to call it. The texst on that Sabbath morning was from 1st John, I--3 "; That ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly, our fellowship is withll the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ." It was a good sermon. The preach- er's heart was evidently filled with love, and -his lips, that day, were in his heart. Men, who had soughalt rest in the sanctuary, from the toil and strife of every day life, were refreshed and greatly strengthened. God is apt to bless such sermons. Men are more liable to be drawn heavenward by the silken cords of love, than to be buffetted thither by theological clubs. 21   22        COMMUNION DAY. The preacher dwelt at length upon the Gospel, as the ground of all holy fellowship: setting forth the sacred brotherhood of the Saints; the common spiritual com- munion of all the blood-washed, as one in Christ. Mr. Hart and Ellen Roberts sat together, and, in the same pew sat also Deacon Roberts and his good Meth- odist wife. There were many members of other churches present, and among them, Deacon Saybrook of the Presbyterian Church ; a beautiful, silver-haired old man, of nearly four-score years. God seems to love to let his ripened wheat stand for a while in the field, tlat the passers by may behold the gospel grain, before the reaper with the sharpened sickle shall take the sheaf to the heavenly garner. The good old man evidently enjoyed the sermon. The appro- bation of such a man is a ministerial seal, not to be despised. At the close of the discourse, the usual invitation to the Lord's Supper was given out by the pastor, as fol- lows:-"All members of sister churches of the same faith and order, who are in good and regular standing, are invited to take seats, antd partake with us." The pastor added, that he did not require those who could not commune to leave the house, but would be glad to -have them remain, and look on upon the solemn service. As the separation was taking place between the worthy and the unworthy, the preacher remarked, that he earnestly hoped, that the division might not be pro- 'phetic of the final assortment at the day of judgment. He alluded also to the mran mentioned in the gospel, who was found at the feast, without the wedding gar- ment. I have spoken of Deacon Saybrook, as much inter-   COMMUNION DAY.        23 ested in the discourse. When especially pleased, he would raise his hands, and look upward, his face fairly shining with a holy ecstasy, and then instantly he would turn again to the preacher. Again and again, that morning, did the venerable man "telegraph with heaven," as Ellen Roberts called his upward glancing and sudden elevation of hands. The choir were singing the hymn: "Jesus himself draws near,  To feast his saints to-day," and, as I have said, the communicants were taling their places in the body of the house at the table. Deacon Saybrook must have known the usage of the Church, but still there he sat, directly in front of the pulpit. He seemed utterly unconscious of all that was transpiring around him. His eyes were turned toward   the pulpit, but he appeared wrapt in visions quite beyond the scene pass-  i ing so close to him. Meantime, the pastor and officers of tho Churchl  had taken  their places at the table. As one and another of the Church entered the pew in which Deacon Saybrook was sitting, he mechanically moved to give room, until he finally sat at the extreme end of the seat,  farthest from the aisle. Quiet being restored, tho preacher arose at tho head of the table, commencing the service with the usual form,-"Our Lord Jesus, tAe same night in whzic76 he iwas betrayed, took" . ... At this moment, Deacon Roberts interrupted the minister, whispering something which could not be heard by the communicants, and at the same time. pointing apparently to Deacon Saybrook. "Certainly] It is the law, Deacon;" responded tho   - pastor. Then, fixing his eyes upon the  unconscious   COMMUNION DAY.  offender, he said; "I observe some at the table who have no right to partake: while it is a matter of great delicacy to ask any one, of whose fervent piety I have so full an assurance as I have in the case of the venera- ble father before me, to leave the Lord's table, still, as this is a Baptist table, and good Deacon Saybrook has never been baptized, (myself being a guardian of the ttable, -whose duty it is to enforce the law of Christ's house,) I am under the painful necessity of kindly requesting Deacon Saybrook to leave." All eyes were fixed upon the man whose presence had interrupted the sacred feast. I especially noticed the expression of his countenance, as the pastor made the announcement enforcing the rule of the Church. There was a look of interruption-a disturbance of holy thought, instantly succeeded by an expression of surprise and confusion, mingled with grief-but not the slightest show of anger. He immediately rose up, and Deacon Winston handed him his hat and cane, to facilitate his escape from the table of his Lord. But he stood, and, with that soft, gen- tle voice of his, he simply said : " I humbly beg pardon of the pastor, and all my brethren and sisters in Christ Jesus. I ought to have remembered ;5 but the fact is, I was so taken up with the train of thought presented by the preacher, setting forth the fellowship of the saints, that I utterly forgot the usage of the Baptists, and was not aware of the announcement, which, no doubt, was made at the close of the sermon. "Truth to tell," he added, with that smile of his, scat- tering the momentary surprise and embarassment upon his face like a gleam of sunshine breaking through a cloud,"I was far away in the bright land beyond the   COMMUNION DAY.               25 ;   ,   -  Y river, sitting in 'the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, at the heavenly communion, where I confidently expect I shall meet in God's good time, the company of believ- ers which I leave this day at the table. With the ear- nest prayer that the Lord, whose table is spread before me, will give us all, through riches of grace, a name and a place at the heavenly banquet, I obey the pastor's request." So saying, he walked slowly down the aisle-the peo- ple waiting until he had gone out of the house. The sexton said that he noticed, as he passed him at the door, that he was in tears. I confess, this painful scene at the door of the ban- queting chamber, spoiled the feast for me. I tried, as the service went forward, to fix my mind upon Christ and His Cross, but I could not. I took my piece of bread from the plate, and bowed my head in prayer, but to my closed eyes, there was the white-haired old man with hat and cane, going away. Then, as I turned in spirit to look upon Calvary and the broken body  visibly set forth," I saw the old man there, by a divine invitation', kneeling with all the penitent company, on a hill, rising quite above and beyond all creeds and conditions of men. Different groups and companies there were, but all on the one hill: and, in their midst, lifted up in the sight of every kneeling soul-the Cross  I knew my thoughts were heresy against the faith of my Church, but I could not help thinking, if the old man had access to the body of the Crucified, and part in the great sacrifice, if the falling blood cleansed his soul from sin, had he not a right to celebrate the sacrifice which bought his ransom ? True, he might be in error of   doctrine. He was! iBut was not his eternal hope born in the agony of Calvary  If the body was broken for him, was not the sacred saying at the supper, his,-" this is. my body, broken for you?"If redeeming blood had cleansed his heart from sin, and imparted to him everlasting life, had ho not a share with all the redeemed on earth, in a cup, whicch is handed to the communicant with the words,- g: "Take.! Drink ye all of it-for as oft .as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show forth the Lord's ! death until He come. Do -this in remembrance of me?" Then came the thougrht, he was not baptized. ie Il thinks he is     Yes ; but thnking-so, does not  make it so. True, but God looks upon the heart,-"As : a man thinketh, so is he." The law of Christ must be ij obeyed. True; but the spirit of complete obedience is 1 in -this man's heart.  Is there not, after all, in the judgment of a heavenly charity, the same sacred mantle, dropped alike upon my  own poor shoulders and his, by the lhands once nailed c to the Cross?       - He loves Jesus more, I fear, than I da. He presents  the eloquent argument of a Christian life thrice beyond j -my ownI. WThen his hand droeps that pilgrim staff, it  will sweep the strings of a heavenly harp. Could not that hand have taken in righteousness a crumb from his Master's table to-day? Those lips have prayed the prayer of penitence, and spoken words of faith, and, beyond the river, shall sing the song of Moses and the Lamb!  Would it have been sinful to have wet them this day with sacramental wine, even in a Baptist Church? But baptism is the divinely appointed ordinance of   COMM U.NION D.4Y.      27 Christ's church on earth; and there is no baptism but immersion. I believe it! And then there came to me a part of the chapter read that morning in the opening of tho service-the twelfth chapter of Matthew, in which Christ rebukes the self-righteous Pharisees:-"At that' time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the. corn; and his disciples were ahungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat. :But when the Pharisees saw it,  they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which  is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day. But he said unto them, have ye not read what David did, when he was ahungered, and they that were with him? How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shew-bread which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them  which were with him, but only for the priests?" Are there no circumstances, thought I, in which a blood-washed soul, without " the washing of baptism," nay be justified in eating bread and drinking wine in the kingdom of Christ? Jesus, in the test, refers to a positive law, clearly ecorded, and openly and knowinigly broken in the    * )odily necessity of David and his men. , Is theo law equally explicit in the6 declaration of bap- d ism, as in all circumstances, a--pre-requisite to tho  - upper? Where is it-the book, chapter and verse      a nd if it could be founld--it cannot-does not the pas- age in Matthew seem to suppose a case, in which the unger of the soul may be satisfied with better bread,  nad that soul be justified by the Lord of the Sabbath?  Nay, more; in the case of good and erring Deacon aybroolk, Ewe are to suppose, in order to a complete lrallel, that David and his men were in the delusion at they had a legal righlt, and so ate through mistake.   28        COMMU2oON DAY. These thoughts forced themselves upon my mind, and disturbed my attempted devotions at the table, and the communion hour had passed. God forgive me,% I whispered, as the church rose to sing the parting hymn; God forgive me for any evil thoughts at the table, this day--make me to know more of Thee. At the close of the supper, the people gathered in groups at. the church door, and there seemed to be a division among them. I only heard Deacon Roberts say in reply to some rebellious spirit,-"well law is law- there you have it. Deacon Saybrook is no better than any other disorderly Christian: we cannot allow an officer of a so-called church of Christ to violate the law of God's house." "I suppose that isso," replied Mr. Hart," but, grant- ing the supposition that Deacon Saybrook was to-day, a tare in the Lord's wheat-field, there is a question in my mind, whether the Lord's advice would not have been better followed, by leaving the Lord of the harvest to make the separation hinself, at a later period. ,; I rather guess," he added, " some gospel wheat was pulled up to-day." Ellen Roberts seemed quite overcome at the sight of an old man of God, actually driven from the table of the Lord. As Mr. Hart walked with her to her home, sho said that she supposed it was Baptist law; but sho thought it was" more honored in the breach, than in the observance." "That is good Shakrspare," said Mr. Hart, " but it is poor Bible, and poor law. As a lawyer," he continued, "I would say, your father was legally right in calling the pastor's attention to tho offence of Deacon Say-   brook's presence: and the pastor could do no less than to enforce the law, by sending the offender away. He had no election in the matter. He boldly discharged a duty, which devolves upon every Baptist minister under like circumstances. "If the-law is right-scripturally right-should Bap- tists shirk it, as though they were ashamed of it? If it is not a law of the Lord, should weo not have moral courage great enough, to abolish it from the statute book of Baptist usage? Let me tell you, Ellen, there is hardly a table spread in all the bounds of 'our denomi- nation, but you may find there some communicant who is  legally unworthy. The Baptist Church shrinks from en- forcing one of its cardinal doctrines. It is ashamed to do so I "I felt a little roguish when I spoke of the tares and the wheat, believing as I do, that Deacon Saybrook is as good wheat as may be found on all the gospel farm. "Nay, more ;" said ]Mr. Hart, " if I were a Pedo-bap- tist, I would rather Ibe courteously sent away from tho table spread in a Baptist house, than to bo allowed to remain by grace, or by stealth, in Iknown violation of Baptist usage and Baptist doctrine.    . "But, Ellen," asked Mr. Hart, "can it bo the law of the Lord? This is the whole questionl  If it is wo should glory in it.' Is baptism in all cases and under all circumstances a pro-requisite to the Holy Supper? Does it not seem strange that He who saw the end from the beginning should have ordained a law which He knew would incapacitate for'all timeonine-tenths of..His disciples from renderingobedienco tod His ositive com- mnandment, as governing His Hemorial Supper.?' Is not. the question'of privilege witththe man s-own conscience. and with God?   30        COMMUNION DAY. "Ellen," he continued, "I will tako notlhing less than the plain--' thus saith the Lord ' on that! I must read the statute for myself, and I will not take the inferences and deductions of the pulpit lawyers." Here the conversation was brought to a close, as they entered the house, and Ellen went immediately to her mother's room. "Well mother," asked Ellen, "how did you like the sermon?" "I was delighted with the sermon," replied Mrs. Roberts, " it was at once timely and tender-the Spirit of the Lord was in the assembly.. Dut," she continued, "you well know, my child, that to my'benighted mind, as your dear father calls it, the separation of Christians at the close of the sermon, when the strange invitation to the table was given, quite destroyed the good effect of the discourse. To conduct a company of believers to Calvary, and then to commence the work of division, oven at the foot of the Sacred Mount, is to me a strange inconsistency. For a mortal to say to a part of the blood-washed company,-wo have a right, and we only, to ascend tho Holy Hill, and keep the memorial feast at the foot of the Cioss! but to those who are required to stand aside, we say in all charity,-you, alikel with our- selves, have climbed Calvary's hill on knees of penitence ; the-cleansing blood has fallen on your poor souls, even: as upon ours,\washing away the stains of sin, and your hope with ours, was begotten at the foot of the cross: -still, you are unworthy-unworthy, though Christ is, found within you the hope of glory-unworthy, though in your hearts you' honestly believe that you have rendered 'fulland. entire obedience .a %he gospel requirement. You must: stancl hoerse,wlhfil - e go yonder. to. worship.-   COMMUNION DAY.        31 We are the judges of your conscience, and you shall not join the blood-washed company in the celebration of-a banquet which was spread by our common -Lord and Saviour, for every new-born soul. Daughter it was too much! Those cruel words, as we were forced to leave the Lord's table, about the man -without the wedding garment: and the expressed hope, that the separation then taking place mighthnot be significant and prophetic of the final division, at the judgment seat of Christ! If I had been' a hardened sinner," she continued, "I should  have needed the terrible admonition. I am not angry: my heart is broken! Yes; my heart is broken, my child, by this violence! Your father must never request me again to attend the Baptist Church on ordinance day. There is not, I fear, grace enough in my poor heart to risk the dangerous experiment. I had a fearful warfare with Satan, all the way home, but I have gained a victory in my closet, by the grace of God. I can forgive him, who, in the- name of Jesus, drove me from my Lord's table! That is great grace. I was anxious to remain. My soul was hungering and thirsting for the bread and wine of the kingdom. Yes I can fully forgive a sentence which separated me from  the two-fold kindred of husband and child, as unworthy to feed from the same plate, or drink from the same cup. M"Mr. Burden is a Christian-he is a good minister of Christ, and I shall ever love him, as the man whose hloly teachings and fervent prayers were blessed of God to your own soul's salvation. Were there not manv ex- cluded?' asked Mrs. Roberts. "The audience was so large, that I am sure there must have been many present from other churches."       -  "Yes," replied Ellen, "the number of those who left   32        COMMUNION DAY, was larger than of those who remained.+ But," added she, "you know that-only those whom I personally knew as Christians from other communions, could I identify, for all' went out- together." "Yes," said- the mother, " all under condemnation. All alike, in the fact that they were unfit to sit at tho Lord's table. I know your preacher is honest, Ellen, to the last degree conscientious- for, he long since re- quested his Presbyterian wife to remain at home, or to go to some other church on ordinance day, to avoid tho scene of going out with the excluded at the close of the sermon. "But to return; did you know who went out? For I saw no one in my confusion, but hastened from my father's house, for the close communion of my closet." "Yes," answered Ellen," sitting so far front, and in a side pew, I had a good opportunity to see all who left. There was Deacon Ward's son, with his bride ; the latter a member, you know, of the Methodist Church. I won- dered what he would do--himself a member of our, church. They both left!" "Tied so strong in matrimonial bonds, that they could not separate at the table," said Mrs. Roberts, " she, poor soul, could not stay; and he, loving soul, would not stay--'unequally yoked with an unbeliever,'-as the Elder would say, but, nmlike the preacher's fair yoke- fellow, in this case the bow was not slipped, but they went out of the field together." "I am sure," said Ellen, '" we shall have another trial for discipline, mother. For young?Ward's course was a violation of his church obligation. Well," she added, "that will only hasten his departure from the church of his fathers, altogether, as has happened again   COMMUNION DAY.        O0 and again in these church inter-marriages. And it is natural enough-the Pedo-baptist companion cannot go to the Baptist table, but the Baptist can sit at the table in the Pedo-baptist Church. "Churching brother Ward, will only hasten his jour- ney to his wife's spiritual home as his chosen dwelling place."- "But," said the mother, " how can he in conscience subscribe to our views of baptism? and that would be the attitude of his new relation." a "Just, mother," said the daughter, " as multitudes of real Baptists are in the various Pedo-baptist Churches, to-day. They are not thoroughly at home : still, they know they are with Christ's disciples. They would gladly bring their faith and practice into harmony, if the Baptist Church would only take down the offensiveo bar of close communion, and admit the disciples of all branches of Christ's church to the privilege of the Lord's table. Thousands have joined the Pedo-baptist Church by immersion, assured in their minds that it was the only baptism, and are lost to the Baptist denomin- ation, because of the peculiar doctrine. There is no reasoning, mother, against the heart in this matter. I am a Baptist-a true Baptist; but oh, the struggles through which I have this day passed! I never dare see you go away. Like brother Ward and his bride, I fear I should go out too, and risk the discipline. "I do sometimes long, mother, for the time so eloquently described in the sermon this morning, when we shall all sit down at the table in heaven.  No going out." "I think," said Mrs. Roberts, "the Baptist saints had better try the union here a few times,by way of rehearsal.   34&       COMMUNION DAY. lest they might be a little awkward at the heavenly banquet in their first sitting together with those, who, like myself and the minister's wife, were deemed un- worthy to commune with them when on earth.  Your need not," said she, smiling, " you need not repeat this remark to your father, for you know he is very sensitive on this communion question. But I could not help thinking it and saying it. Oh, my dear child! I am sure it will be a relief to some Baptist (Greathearts' now shut up in their creed-prisons, to enjoy the liberty of the New Jerusalem." Ellen then added that she could describe a sad scene, which occurred in the removal of dear old Deacon Say- brook, but,-she Iknew she would hear it all when they went down into the parlor. "As your father was to invite tho Elider homo with him, we had better go down," said Mrs. Roberts. "Mrs. Burden knows the engagement, and will come directly from Dr. Parson's church, to our house." f           ,  "  '     COtAPTER III. THE   TALK AFTER   FHURCH. 'SB"OFD rwill talk the matter over after dinner," said Deacon :Roberts, as Ellen and her mother entered the room. "We will talk it over, brother Hart, after dinner ; but law is law, and there is no going back of scripter." "I agree that it is law-church law,"--said Mr. Hart, "but my only question is, as to the Scripture side of the question." - The company took their places at the table, and grace was said by Elder Burden-the company all standing during the prayer. There is a fashion even in prayer, and that was the old-fashioned way. I do not know why it was, but, for some reason, I especially noticed the language of the pastor: he thanked the Lord for the fellowship of social life, and the privilege of household communion, in being permitted to gather around theo bountiful board of His Providence for the supply of the returning wants of the bodvy; and praised the Giver of all good, above all, for the boundless gifts of His grace, in meeting the higher wants of the soul by satisfying the spiritual hunger and thirst of every saint. At the close of the meal, the company sang a hymn of praise, and left the table. For a short time after dinner, a general conversation ensued, in which all present took part, the preacher leading the same. Tho usual staples of health, theoweather, and so forth, opened the informal service. 35,   -   36       TALK Atralt CHURCH.  "Well, wife;" said the Elder, "what have you to report from your church to-day?" "It was ordinance day at Dr. Parson's church, and a very interesting service," she replied, "the sermon preceding the Supper was from John's Gospel :-' That. they all may be one. That they may be made perfect in one. " i"It is remarkable," said the pastor, " how frequently two minds will run in the same channel, without any concert of action, but, as the world would say, by acci- dent." IHis discourse," said M[rs B.," was necessarily brief, but it was certainly excellent, and a good preparation for the Lord's Supper." "What do you thinlr Deacon;" said the pastor, turn- ing to Deacon Roberts as he spoke, " what do you thnk of a Baptist minister having a Presbyterian wife?" "Well;" said the Deacon, in that way of speaking where the cruelty of intention is partially veiled with a smile, and the semblance of a jest, "I am an out-spoken manu in all these matters. You know the Scriptural injunction:--'be not unequally yoked with unbelievers.' The apostle says,' it is better not to marry,' but I am sure that Paul, in allowing a license in the matter, would never have given his consent to a Christian minister marrying one even as good asmy-as your excellent wife, who you know has denied the only true baptism, and when you come down to it, is not really a member of the church of Christ. No offence; " said the Deacon, with an awkward bow and a half smile, looking at the pas- tor's wife, " no offence, Mrs. Burden!" Tho good woman, just ready to burst into tears, man- aged to control herselffor the moment, and even smiled   I TALK AFT .ER ChUCII.            37 in answer to Deacon Roberts, whilo her faca was "rimson. "You know, Pastor," said the Deacon, "for youl arek stout in doctrine: you know-come right down to it- that the whole thing is just cyphered down to this: the church is a body of believers, who have rendered obedi- ence to ' the law contained in ordinances.' That church, in its visible form, has one door, and that door is immer- sion. There you have it! So then, the church is a company of baptized believers, and no other. The church only can spread the Lord's Table: and the members of the church are the only people who can partake. Then," said he, with a significant shake of the head, and a very sol- emn countenance, "thero is a test of scripter, which is terrible on the Pedo-baptists--my wife need'nt shakeo her head; truth is truth, scripter is scripter, and a man must'nt be more liberal than the Bible-as I was saying, there is a test of scripter which makes me tremble for the eternal fate of the Pedo-baptists, and it is this :- H:o that believeth and is baptized, shall boe saved, and ho that believeth not shall beo damned.' And there is no baptism in the Iible but immersion, so there you havo it! It does seem hard, but as I said, truth is truth!" His wife here interposed-for poor Mrs. Burden was dumb with astonishment and grief-saying: "Husband, do you believe that I, your wife, rejoicing in Christ-I haveo nothing to say for the evidence of my life-I, a 1 member of tho Methodist Church-(' so called,' said tho Deacon)-am a sinner under sentence of death; a child of Satan, because I have never been baptized in your senso of the term 8 When you were converted, were you in danger of hell from that moment, until you were bap- tized?

By the way, I thought that in the talk you had, about being unequally yoked with unbelievers, that I knew of a young Baptist a good many years ago, who worked a long lime, and very hard too, to get yoked with an unbeliever. Yes, indeed! heo put the bow on his own neck first, and followed the mate a good while, before she was willing to slip it over her nock. Perhaps he hacl better go out to Indiana, where, I believe, they arc ready, in Scriptural language, to ' break every yoke and let the oppressed go free! "But seriously, do you in your soul believe, that I am now on the road to hell, because I was never immersed? "And do you believe ;' said, Mrs. Burden, embold- ened by the language of Ilrs. Iloberts, " to say nothing of myself, that my dear sainted mother, who, for fifty-two years professed religion, and bore her children in arms of faith to God, until they found Jesus, who died looking upward to Heaven and exclaiming with he' last breath, 'come, Lord Jesus'-do you believe," she continued, summoning all the strength she possessed, while her eyes filled with tears, "that she who was a Presbyterian, never belonged to the true church of Christ? never sat at the Lord's Table?--and abovo all, that her spirit went from that triumphant death-bed to all the . . .  -The dreadful words died on her lips; she could not finish the sentence, but instantly rosoe up and left tho room. In a few moments Mrs. Eobcrts also withdrew, remnarling that she would return soon, and entering theo room up stairs, found Mrs. Buirden lying on tho bed, with her face covered by her hands, while through her fingers the tears were triclkling thick and fast. Putting her arrns arou-.nd tiho weeping woman, said   TALK ArFTEr CeIHu .     39 Mrs. Eoborts, ":there, dear child! there now-don't tako it to heart this way-! .you know it was a mere doc- trinal talk, and I always dread to have husband get on this matter. Ho didn't mean all he seemed to say! ' "' Didn't mean!" exclaimed Mrs. Burden; "didn't mean! Must I bo-told that I am an unbeliever, with all ' the offence of that terrible word! must I be told that the church of my fathers and my church is no church at all! That it cannot spread the Supper of the Lord! That I havo no claim to the Supper--robbed of the rights of a dclisciplo in this world, and in danger of condemna- tion in tho world to come! TWell might David pray, 'leaveo mo not in the hands of men!' Blessed bo God! our Heavenly Father says ' I wrill not leave you in his hands, nor condemn you when you are judged.' "Oh, lIrs. Roberts!" sheo exclaimed, " how should I feel with such a faith. I know in my heart that all who love Jesus and worship Him as their divine Saviour, are His ; and being His, aro my brothers and sisters in Him --witfh errors of doctrine it may be; but a part of tho church of Jesus Cirist, no matter of what creed, color, country or condition.

The books of the visible church on earth do not contain all thoe names of God's children. There are other church books than those wo seo and handle.

She had talked herself into comparative composure "How can your husband," asked Mrs. Roberts, " with such a warm, liberal heart as wo know he has, and speak- ing as he does of all who love Jesus as his brothers anad sisters, believe, that no one but a regular member of a Baptist Church has a right to the Lord's Supper, and that it is a sin, calling for the discipline of the church, for a baptized believer to sit down at the table with a com- pany of Pedo-baptists ? I asked him, one day;" said Mrs. Burden, "how ho reconciled this :--'first,' said I, 'you say the Lord's Supper cannot be spread in a Pedo-baptist Church, and second, you discipline a member of your church for sitting at the Lord's table, in the Pedo-baptist Church. What has he done ? It is either the Lord's table, or it is not. If it is, he has a right to it: for on your own ground, he is an obedient disciple, and the disobedience of an- other communicant does not invalidate the right of tho obedient man, but his own. And if it is not the Lord's table, he breaks no law by sitting there!' HIusband smiled and only said,'you and I, my dear, will not talk doctrine. I have enough and too much of that, else- where. The battle of the saints,' ho added, 'does not seem so much in fighting Satan, as in warring with themselves. It is a sad and cheap victory, for a soldier of an army arrayed against a common and mighty foe, to conquer a fellow soldier under the same flag. There may and must be many rooms in Christ's house: in tho earthly habitation, we do not all live in one apartment. No; like the heavenly house, there are 'many mansions,'   TALK A.1; CliLlnUCt.   - d but the house should not bo divided "against itself.'  "Oh, Mary!." said Mrs. Roberts, "if he would only come out on this broad ground I Baptist papers would attack him of course; that is to be expected: but he never would fall by the paper balls of such a battery. Regular Baptist Churches, a few perhaps would be closed against him, but I am sure that those who would bo for him would out-number those against him. "There must be a great multitude of liberty-loving men and women in the Baptist Church who, in this day of holy activity and Christian union, would stand by him. But these are minor questions. You and I believe that the bold step would advance the Gospel standard which he so nobly carries to the high vantage ground of true battle. "But we must go down," said she, "for they will wonder at our absence. Now do you go with me, my dear, and don't feel hurt at any of those hard and un- charitable sayings.". " If I am cut," she replied, " I cannot help but bleed; but I will conceal the wound if possible, for the com- pany's sake.". As they entered the room- tho' zealous Deacon re- marked: "I was afraid that perhaps you felt a little hurt at what I said, coloring up as you did and going out so suddenly. : I meant nothing personal or nlkind, you know. I.was led along to those plain statements; and, while in conscience I have nothing to take back or soften in the great doctrines declared, I am anxious for you to believe that I did not mean to hurt your feelings. It requires," said th -Deacon, turning to the Pastor,' " great firmness of purposegreat grace, to stand square up for thse great truths.

"But the right eyes must come out, and the right bands must come off!"   l Tho Pastor made no reply, and the Deacon continued: ' now, in that matter of Deacon Saybrook this morning at the table, I say it to your face, that there ain't one man in a hundred in the Baptist pulpit to-day, who would have been brave enough to enforce the law. Yet they know there is no escape from the great doctrinal conclusion. Ours is the church of Christ-a company of baptized believers. Only a baptizedl'believer, and a member in regular standing, in a regular church, has S a right to partake. It's the law of the Lord's house, which is a Baptist house ; and in view of this law, a. Pedo-baptist, as good a man as old Deacon Saybrook is, has no more right than a heathen." "Why, Deacon Roberts!" exclaimed Ir. Hart, for thi first time breaking silence. "I don't say he is as bad at heart as a heathen;" re- plied the Deacon, " ho may boecalled a disobedient dis- ciplo of Christ--' disorderly member,' as some have it. ]But this I say, and you say-and all true, close com- munion Baptists, as they call us, must say, or deny our faith and bo open communion at once-that in -no case, under no circumstances, has an .unbaptized be- liever, or -een a baptized believer, not a member of tho a-ptist Cih',h a right to tho Lorcl's table.    TALK A'TEli CHUlECH.      43 So I say, Deacon Saybrook has no- right, for ,one reason; and a heathen has no right, for another reason. And therefore, both are in a common condemnation as to the claim to a place at the Lord's table. There you have it! Now, don't you say I called my good neighbor. Saybrook a heathen. I believe he is a Christian with a thousand virtues, and could wish and pray that he might have light, and take his place in the church of Christ. "Yes ;" ho continued, addressing the Pastor, "it was a duty you could not shirk,.and be a true Baptist minis- ter. And I will say further, that this modern growth of Baptist ministers is getting contaminated by a mock liberality. In nine churches out of ten, if the Pedo- baptists didn't go away when told to by the notice, which musts bo given before the communion, they wouldn't saya word, but let the offender stay. Now I say, this is dodging the question, andis open disobedience to law! If they believe close communion, they should act close communion: and if not, let them come out of the pul- pit. hlere you hlave it! iElder Warren tells me-and ho knows and talks with a great many Baptist ministers-- that they ar o at heart two-thirds of them open commun- ion. They have told him as much, and say that scarcely an ordinance Sunday occurs but there are Pedo-baptists at the table, in their churches. Especially. is this the case in cities, where those Christian Unions and such like, bring Baptists and Pedo-baptists together.- The Elder named over prominent men in the Baptist pul- pits," continued Deacon Robcrts,- "in such towns as Boston, H:,artford, Irooklyn, New York, Albany, Cincin- nati and other places, who are getting too-liberal for their faith, and who',le thinks, aro at heart open communion,   ";      TAL  1 sAlKT  C11'U:CnI. uand some dlay will throw off all disguiso in ttlo matter ' Wolves in sheep's clothing,' I call them.

" It sets the offender a thinlking--' why do I leave? he is led to ask himself." ("No doubt he asks that," whispered Mr. Hart to El- len.) "This must have been in the minds of those whc went out this morning. Who knows but that Deacon Saybrook himself will be struck under conviction by this very act, hard as it seemed atr the time. What a victory over the Pedo-baptists that would bo I What an ornament to the church. We ought to pray ovei these things. "And you and I, Elder, in our own homes, in the dear partners of our lives, have daily sorrow." W "There husband ;" interrupted Mrs. Roberts, "there husband, let us drop that if you please." "No hurt, dear ;" said the Deacon. "It's my plain talk.

"Well," said the Deacon, "you know you have the whole time in the church; and as for us laymen our chance is outside the church." The Pastor smiled and said "I have been very glad to get your views clearly set forth. It is in such inter- views that the minister comes to know more thoroughly his people. Your reasoning, I will say, was correct, touching the law of the Baptist Church. I can see it in no other light, than that in which you present it. ' All members of the same faith and order, in good and regular standing'-that is the invitation, and tliis declaration is a saying, that any intelligent Pedo-baptist must understand, forbidding him a place at the table. And, as in the case of the venerable Deacon Saybrook, if he does not happen to notice the rule, it is the duty of the church kindly to inform him, and, were he still to remain, the church would have no right to proceed with the Supper, for we have no authority to commune with an unbaptized believer, or oeven with a baptized believer not in good and regular standing in a church of the same faith and order. So, it is just hero: the offensive person must leave, or the Supper must be suspended. While I  am in the- Baptist pulpit, at the head of a church, I  have no alternative, but,. sustained by the church, to enforce the law. I am the executive officer,   "       TALK AITE I  CIURiCI!. as well as the preacher and pastor of the church. I have no desire to extend remark, especially as I must go home and rest before tho evening service, as, baptism is to bo administered. I will only say, that, I think brother Warren is correct, in supposing that the dis- affection is very extensive in the Baptist pulpit. There is no doubt," he continued, " that the spirit and general tendency of the age is calculated to loosen the rigid doctrinal bands drawn, as the church is made to believe, from the word of God, and fastened so firmly by the fathers. I personally know many strong men-tho boast of the Baptist pulpit in this country-who have told me with their own lips, that their minds and hearts are in sympathyv with the religious progress everywhere around them; and that they feel a secret and strong rebellion against our strict communion. And if this is the present condition of the pulpit, I think there mnust be an equally prevaling sentiment in the pez. That there is, I may perhaps say, an alarming liberty of thought, quite regardless of the letter of creeds and the example of the fathers, is manifest to all. Christians of all professed faiths seem to be growing to a belief, that, holding the great truths of the Divinity of Christ and the saving efficacy of His blood, they may attain unto a common fellowship of the saints. The great headlands of' doctrine, such as once divided the Gospel territory, seem to be unnoticed by the mnultitude floating on the broad surface and with the strong-setting current of so- called Christian union." "Well," said the Deacon, "it is for' the Baptist Church to stand out like a rock against this rolling river." "Yes;" said Mr. Hart, "the rock, if deep bedded,   TALK AFTEr:r CUErnaC.     47 will not bo moved; but its stationary strength will not stop tho rivcr, and in a freshet, tLe water rising may hide the rock." "Temporarily;" said the Deacon. "The waters once again reaching their level, the old, memorablo rock will surely appear." As the Pastor was about to leave, brother Hart saidl he would like, at some other time, to express his senti- ments and compare notes a little. Being young in the Christian life, he needed light. He added that the scene at the table this morning had rather tried him. Heo supposed i twas perhaps all right, and that he was all wrong.  At any rate, the church was a school of in- struction, and as a pupil jus5 entered, he was anxious to know the right, and act accordingly. Elder Burden replied, that he liked his spirit, and would bo glad at some early day to meet him in his Study. An engage- ment was accordingly made, and theocompany broke up. On the way home, the Pastor's wife asked her husband- "ow lhe liked Deacon Roberts' views, as to the present condition and futuro prospect of unbaptized believers. "Drop the subject, may dear, for the present;" said Elder Burden.  "It was a   poor preparation for my evening service. I have learned for the hundredth time a lesson, whichh, I tI u t, will henceforth need no repetition and that is, to avoid Sabbath visits between services. "K nowing the peculiarities of good Deacon Roberts, [ dicld not want to ofend him by a refusal.  But this ends t! Satan shall not again use a Deacon to dissipato the 'eigious spirit begotten in my pulpit  ministrations. Deacon Roberts is a good man ;  but he is, to say the sast, a  manl whose zeal for tho truth leads him, often- imes, to use intemperate languago.

Burden again repeated, "he ,is a good man. I :lave seen him as tender as a child. But he is possessed by a spirit of controversy."   CHAPTER IV. THE 3APTISM   AND THE SERMON. FE^HE church was crowded in the evening to -wit- ness the ordinance of baptism.  Jordan is always a popular orator. It was a time of glorious revival, and no less than twenty candidates awaited the service. The sermon was appropriate to the occasion, and was delivered with all that Gospel unction which character- ized the preaching of Elder Burden. He poured his soul through his sermon. His text was from Romans, Sixth Chapter:-"Buried with Christ, in baptism." His subject was ---"THE THREE-FOLD SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ORDINANCE OF BAPTISM." He described the scene on the occasion of the bap- tism of Christ-:-the multitude gathered-on the river bank; Johnl the Baptist overwhelmed as he beheld Jesus presenting himself for baptism, when he ex- claimed, "I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?"-the answer of the Lord, "Suf- fer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness; " the watery burial and resurrection; the voice from heaven, "-This is my beloved Son, in who m I am -well pleased." He dwelt at length upon Christ's baptism, .and set forth the nature and character of the baptism by John. He argued that John's baptism could not have been the baptism known to the church-to-day. 3s   Ovu      BAPTISM AND SESMON. '  Tho acceptable candidate, hoe contended, must bo one who has repented of his sins-one who, by faith in the sacrifice for transgression, has laid hold of the hope sot before him in the Gospel. He is, said he, regenerated by the power of the Holy Spirit. Christ was "holy, harmless, and undefiled;'" and therefore Hoe had no ex- perimental knowledge of the emotion of penitence. No office work of the Holy Ghost was wrought upon Hilm. The Trinity -met in glorious declaration on Jordan's banks. The voice, proclaiming the presence of the' Father; the descending dove, declaring the immediate power of the Spirit, and God incarnate, standing on the shore, just risen from the watery sepulchre. 1But this baptism, said the preacher, is alone in the records of the church. It is without parallel. Witl tho church to-day, the sacred ordinance is not properly administered, unless the declaration is made, "IN (on INTO) THE NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE HOLY GHOST. ' No such announcement sounded on Jordan's banks on that day ever memorable in the church. We know not, he added, if any word was spoken: and he supposed rather, that in solemn silence, the baptizer -laid the Lord of Glory in the river, and raised Him from the "water; the vast multitude meanwhile muto and motionless, looking on. That the first sound, breakling that silence, was the voice from Heaven-the approving testimony of God, the Father. I.--This baptism was a PROPHECY.  So should His body be laid in the Sepulchre, even as John buried Him in the water. And as John raised Him out of the water, once more visible to the people, so should He be raised up from the dead, and manifest ;ITinmself to the world- i   BAPTISM AND SEMO.        . . ' 51 alive t) die no more! It was, he- repeated, a beautiful oand glorious prophecy of the burial and- resurrection of jHim who is our Resurrection and Life. II.-It was an i-XAMPLE--law in action. He main- tainecd that in this example of the great Head and Dishop of the church,- alone dwelt the declaration of duty to every believer. He further contended, that John's baptism lacked the essentials of Christian bap- tism, in all else save the mode of administration, and in that only because Christ adopted it as the law of His disciples. John's candidates " had not so much as lheard whether there be any ttoly Ghost." (Acts, XTXth.) They had no knowledge-he who baptized them had no knowledge of the efficiency of redeeming blood. They were discipled into the one single belief of the great fact, that the Messiah should immediately appear. And that Messiah, whose coming was foretold by- all tho pro- phets, was, without doubt, to them a temporal Prince, who should more than restore the throne of David and of Solomon. He declared, moreover, that any Israelite to-day converted from his error touclhin the appear- ance of the Messiah, and yet an utter stranger to the work of regeneration wrought by the Holy Ghost- simply believing that Christ had come, and determining to live a moral life-would have been, in John's sight, an acceptable candidate for baptism.       ; He added further, that the great Apostle to the Gen- ' tiles did not consider that to be valid baptism, for the I reason that such disciples knew not the Holy Ghost, i whose visit to the church awaited the ascension ofi Christ. The Spirit at that time. could not havo been here :i, IIis official power, for Christ had said, "I muist needs go away or the Cooforter will not come."   52 '      BAPTISM AND sE rMOmx. Therefore Paul baptized the men named in tho ninoe teenth of Acts, which he would not have done if they had been before baptized. Christ's immersion was the law of the Church: and the man born anew in Christ Jesus, and he only, had a right to an ordinance, whose servide told of an inward cleansing by the Holy Ghost, through the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice. Hence those wwho were immersed by John were not, in the sense of all holy teaching of the word of God and all practice of the church, baptized. "I.--BAPTISM WAS THE PUBLIC DECLARATION OF THE BELIEVER, THAT HE WAS CRUCIFIED UNTO THE WORLD, DEAD! BURIED! AND RAISED INTO THE NEW KINGDOM OF CHRIST! He then quoted that beautiful passage in Dr. Chalmer's Commentary upon the first part of the sixth chapter of iomans--- Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so, we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we- should not serve sin.  For He that is dead is freed from sin." (Romans VI, 3-7.) On this wonderful passage, the great Presbyterian preacher says:-" the original mean- ing of the word baptism, is immersion; and though we regard it as a matter of indifferency, whether the ordin- ance so named, be performed in this way, or by sprink- ling, yet we doubt not that the prevalent style of the administration, in the apostle's days, was by an actual submerging of the whole body under water. mWe advert to this for the purpose of throwing light on the analogy   B ASrTISS: A16;D SERMON. I3 that is instituted in hese verses. Jesus Christ, by death, underwent this sort of baptism, even immersion under the surface of the ground, whence he soon emerged again by his resurrection. We, by being baptized into his death, are conceived to have made a similar transla- tion. In the act of descending under the water of baptism, to have resigned an old life; and in the act of ascending, to emerge into a second or a new life." IV.-IT SETS FORTH THE BELIEVEr'S DEATH, BURIAL, AND 'RESURRECTION IN CHRIST, AND HS CONSEQUENT FREEDOM FROM THE PENALTY OF THE LAW, oMVING MET AND ANSWERED ITS REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE DEATH OF CnIsT. So he died in Christ-he was buried with Christ-and in Christ's resurrection, was his spiritual resurrection, to die no more. "He that liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die." This, said the preacher, is the ground of the apostle's triumphant challenge, in the eighth chapter of Iomans: "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It. is God that justifiethh; who is he that condemnethl It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also mnaketh intercession for us." - THE CHRISTIAN'S BAPIISM, LIKE THAT OF EIS DIVINE EXAMPLE, IS PROPHETIC. In wm  rinistry, said the preacher, in the death chamber of a Christian woman, who was dying with consumption, I one day asked her if she had not an instinctive dread of theo grave. She replied that all her life-time sho had been in bondage, subject to the fear of death; but, that in these last days, God had signally delivered her from that bondage. "A contemplation of the glorious sig- nificance of my baptism," she said "has scattered the   BAPTISM AND SERMtON. darkness and dread of thi grave. It was a beautiful Sabbath in June, vllen I was baptized in the North iver.  The Cohurc h, and  great company of people beside, shood on the shore; and, as the minister took me by the hand and led me out into the river, tho Churcl sang one of tlao songs of Zion. Tle water wlas a littlo cold, but I was thinking of folloving Jesus, and I hardly felt it-mhen we had reached the proper depth, wo stood still; then he took my two hands in one of his, and, with the other at my back to sustain me, he laid mo beneath the ater. He was a strong man, and I knew he would not lose me. 1or an ins/ant I was buried in tme water; and then he raised me up.

No,") said she, I am nog- afraid of the grave"  The dyin g woman was eloqueno in setting forth tim beautiful teaching of -the ordinance of baptism, as mgnifent and Ur  ofe ;' rdia burial, and resurrectioa ofthe Sints. Ch rish, sidthe     BAPTISM' AND SERMON,      55 preacher, would perpetuate the memory of the two mighty facts of holy Illstory. For this purpose, he hu1ng two paintings on the -walls of the Christian temple; the one, in the supper setting forth His death; the other, in the baptism, declaring His burial and resurrection. He closed by calling upon the church to remember the lesson of the ordinance as a burial from the world, and the publication of a new life in the Kingdom of Christ. Such was the substance of a discourse which lheld the audience for over an hour. It was free from all unrind langua ge, in reference to other churches. He always respected the views of those Wvith whom he differed, and evidently felt, as. he told his good wife, that abuse was not argument. If there is a vulgarity amounting almost to blasphemy, it is that of ridicule in speaking of the sacred ordinance of baptism. Who would dare-professing to be a Christian--to mako the rite showing forth the Lord's death a matter of jest? Is it less sinful -to ridicule his burial and resurrection? The baptism was adlministered with great propriety. The candidates were calm and composed, and nothing occur- red to mar the solemn n and sublime service of the church. Deacon ,bcerts was everywhere present; he seemed to be anxious that all in the-houso should see him, and realize, too, that he was an officer of  great importance. During the sermon, he left his seat, which of course was conspicuously forward, and walked clown the aisle to say a word to the sexton. Then, on tip-toc-a kind of pious tip-toe-he made his way back to the seat. I saw, too, tha*t ho was very active in helping the candidates to and from the Water. It was quite evident, that he felt himself  to be the main- spring of the church; yet Deacon R oberts was a good man.   CHAPTEP    T V JNTERYIEW  BETWEEN  eLLEN  fOBERTS AND HER  MOTHER, "By OTF17rti," said Ellen, "did not the Pastor's wife that day-'dark day,' as you well call it - -:when she left the room, and went up stairs to cry, quote- something from a book, called 'Credo,' which she said was in SMr. Burden's library?" "She did," replied the mother, " and I was very much struck with it." "Well," said the daughter, "Mr. Hart and I hlave been reading it all the morning, over at the Pastor's Study. Mr. Burden was away, and so Mrs. Burden said to us, you can go off in there, and perfect your theolo- gical studies. I told Ed to take down. that book, for I wanted to read it, and that father would not have it in our house. I said that father had declared that it must be a Pedo-baptist work, or the Pastor's wife wouldn't have loaned it to me. And now father, said I, is worse than ever, because Elder Hartley, who, I will venture a six- pence, never read it or saw it, says it is dangerous. "I do wish, mother, you would read it sometime. It is just what you would like. It is so broad and liberal. Mr. Hart-- Ed,' as I call him-says ' Credo' is a book after his own heart; and so ho says, as he himself is mny Hart, of course the book is after my heart. We read some sayings that I just copiedfor you to see. The writer clearly declares the glorious doctrine of the Divinity of 56   PRTTxN AND HER MOTHEE1?.     57 Christ, and leaves no one in doubt as to salvation by Jesus Christ, the great sacrifice for sin : but his faith is broader than the sectarianism of this day. "I will read you something which Mr. Hart greatly admired:--'It is upon this principle of justification without the deeds of the law, so frequently set be- fore us throughout the Scripture, that we base the glory of the Gospel of Christ.   And also upon this same principle, we base a conviction that the number of-' those finally saved will be greater than many daro believe. Not that we lower the standard, or destroy the terms of salvation, but we believe the terms are complied with oftener than we generally imagine. 'The books of the visible church on earth do not contain all the names of God's children. There are other church books than those wo see and handle. Heaven is thronged with those who have not fulfilled the legalcode. Indeed, there would be few there if the exact fulfillment were required. ' The Jews thought Jehovah was their own exclu- sive right and property. But the principle under discussion shows, that IIoe belongs no less to that large other world of men and nations. The Scriptures, though especially portraying the history of the Jews, are not silent respecting other nations. Now and then they pass across the border of Judea; to find elsewhere some of. the truest servants God has ever had on earth. We- are told of Job, of [Melchizedek, of Rahab. God has every- where had his secret friends, at all times and in all nations; silent guests, ready at a critical moment to do His service. Oh yes, there is a church on earth larger than our narrow hearts dare hope for . .   .  'One has found what answers to the atonement with- 3               g-   3  ..  FJ7.TT.,N AND HERw lOTnEr put a preacher; another has walked by faith in iieathen darkness; another has vrought for God valiantly; and all, who have taken up the'.cross found at their doors, are the children and friends of God.' And this led Ed out. I know, mother, I am probably prejudiced  in his favor; but if it is like praising myself to praise him, I will say that, Edward Hart has got a clear head, and does his own thinking. \ You don't know how lib- eral he is! He says he expects to bo churched some day. I have no fear however, if it comes to that, but Ed will hold his own.'"He says he is half inclined to break square out, only he don't want to mako trouble in the church." "Why, what does he mcanmy dear?" said Mrs. Rob- orts. "Not open communion?" "*No," said Ellen, "not as the peop1le understand that word. Uie says this idea  of 'dear brothering a man ol anotner denomination, everywhere, in- all tho meeting places of Christians, except under the cross, is inconsistent.' . You know they are agoing to open the new Association room in ]lunt's buildings next Thursday evening, and it is arrangecd that after the speeches and the o singing, they will havo a supper: and tho sale of tickets is to go toward meeS. ing the debt on the roon. The -President bchig sick, and Ed being first Yice-President, he will have to pre- side. He was talking to meo about it. How beautiful it vill be, said he, to see members of different churches, each holding their own views of doctrine and advocating them in their own religious homes, sitting togetlecr in the Association as noc church: all eating and drinking, as one family; all believing in the one.

Now Ed says; it- is hard for him to say that they, thus united in holy brotherhood, must separate at the Lord's table: that in that Association, himself and little:' Willie Drake, according to Baptist doctrine, are really the only ones, out of the whole company of Christians who ever sat at the Holy Supper; that the table spread in the other churches with such solemnity, is not the Lord's table.,. "And then, he says, it is strange that Christ should put such honor on a sham table, as he often does in a, Presbyterian or other Pedo-baptist church, where the deluded beings think they are at the Lord's table. - He says if we Baptists are correct, he does not see but the unbaptized company experience full as much of the 'real presence' -as ourselves, especially if we have such a scene as the turning away of old Deacon Saybrook that communion Sunday. In the Pedo-baptist Church, ,he says, there is one of two things, according to Baptist doctrine:-first, it is the Lord's table, but spread in the midst of a, disobedient people-and still Christ blesses these unworthy communicants, as much as lie does the disobedient disciples ;-or else, in the second place, it is neither the Lord's table, nor are they his obedient disci- ples-and yet the blessing ts just the same. "Paul says, that those, who ate and drank unwor- thily did not discern-what? Jordan?  No, Calvary. Not discerning the Lord's body at the table;- and for this they had' fallen asleep; that is, they were spiritually dead. But, says Ed, over all the Chris- tian world, a sham table is spread, at which nine- tenths of the so-called church of Christ gather; and those disobedient disciples eat, and gain life; drink,   60'   -  TF TN AND HER MO'llER. and gain strength. Oh, mother; Ed is very bold. He says the Lord's Supper stands out like Calvary's Mount, alone, even like the cross! that no man shall farm out that hill, or fence in that cross! It is the man's own matter--between himself and his- God. Iy Christ's death, he lives'! ' alive in Christ!' Penitence and- faith gave him a right to go to the cross; and love gives him a right to go to a feast, which shows forth the cross. Nay; the supper is the cross, because it shows just what the cross shows-it sets forth the Lord's death. Ho says the supper no more belongs to any sect or denom. ination than Calvary belonged, of old, to any tribe, or any man in Syria. "I wish you could hear him! He says it is just like the sun: the light is for each man who can see. And while that sun is to that man all he wants, a whole sun to him, yet it is equally so to every other man who has eyes, no matter what may be their color. No man need, he says, to borrow his neighor's sunshine. The supper is the type of God's love to man, and the table is as wide as the diving love.   The Lord's table for tihe Lord's people! Not the Lord's rich, or the Lord's poor-the Lord's learned, or the Lord's ignorant--the Lord's black, or the Lord's white: but the Lord's disci- ples. As father would say, 'there you have it!' "Ed says there is progress everywhere in the Christian world, except in some Baptist Churches. Old theologi- cal marks on the churches, which have in years gone by -been battle lines, are now obliterated. "Christians are getting nearer to each other, so thev can ' see eye to eye '-with different views of doctrine, but one central point where they can rally for the Lord. The cross is that centre! The Lord's Supper is the   T T.VjEN AND HER MOTIEhEL.    G1. sign of, that cross! -The mere cross is empty: the table holds the broken body: for Paul says, 'visibly set forth, crucified in our midst.' Let it be so for all. One man believes in predestination; another man honestly disbelieves that doctrine. Both believe in the cross; both celebrate the death!  One man believes in immersion as the only baptism, which, Ed says, is to him this side the cross, God's most sublime tlhought to man: another man   thinks there are other modes of baptism. Both believe in the cross; both celebrate the death! It is, says he, a practical ago of the world ; people do not want a two hours' argument on- doctrine. The church, holding the great, central, all-vitalizing truth of salvation from the effects of i, through the sacrifice of a Divine Saviour; and, with-thio cross, symbolized by the table, setting forth that mighty fact of God's redeeming love, must move forward, or the people will go around the church, and over it. I thought he used a good figure--you know he is full of figures:-he said, if a multitude of people were starv- ing, and some men were charged with the duty of giving them bread, what would be thought of their entering upon a debate as to the character and quality of true bread, going back to the growth of wheat and the best kind of mills to grind it in; and then at last get to quar- relling as to the mode of distribution, while the hungry crowd was crying for food. "It is not, Ed says, so much CREED that the .world needs-to-day, as CHRISTIANITY. Less creed! and more Christ! Coleridge says it best:' Christianity is not so much a definite system of conceptions as a POWER or LIFE' I do believe Ed is right, mother, and I am tired of this going round and round on the theological tread-mill,   62'      ELLEN AND IiER lMOTHER. with no corn in theo hopper, and no meal in the bag." "' Why,. I am afraid, Ellen," said the mother, " that you have made that Study a dangerous place for theo good Pastor to make his sermons in." "No, I guess not;" replied the daughter, "'I only wish the air could have become charged with the holy contagion of religious liberty, talked by Ed to-day. It has seemed to me, over since that interview, as though - I had come out of a close room into the bright sunlight ; and the pure clear air. I would loveo to go and kiss dear old vhite-haired Deacon Saybrook. Oh mother, such bigotry as that manifested in sending him away, belongs to the days wlhen the grave-yard was full of brambles and briars,-when it was wicked to have instrumental music in the church; and when a bouquet of blossoms fresh from the garden to be placed upon the pulpit, was an- act of sacrilege calling for the discipline of the church."/ "Well," said the mother, " you- know my feelings in all this matter; and, as to your course, I -want you to act for yourself; at least, for peace sake to go your own path, independent of mo. You know how rigid your father is, quito beyond the Baptist Church to-day, I am sure." I "No doubt of that, mother ;" said the daughtcr, "I know well enough, that there must be thousands upon thousands of noble Baptists, who long for theo day when they can feel free to go to the table of the Lord, where- ever it is spread, and invite all who love Jesus in other churches ; yes, and any hungry soul that has not joined the church, but is in spirit a member, to eat and drink in the house of the Lord, leaving the quncstion with tho man's own conscience.

"Your father tells me very little of church matters," said the motlher, '( butI heard him saying to Elder Hartley, that there were a number to be disciplined, and I heard Mr. Hart's name mentioned in the list. So, I think, the storm is at 'hanld." "Well mother ;" said Ellen, " if it comes to that, I am with Edd!" "My child, you should remember your relation to your home.

It was just such a day as is in many a human calender : inspired with the fullness of faith-the perfect love, which casteth out all fear-the future, kindling with all the nameless joys of two trusting hearts. As Ellen intimated in her talk with her mother, they read "Credo," and mutually enjoyed a little private heresy; as each avowed the largest gospel liberty, not having the fear of the Evansdale Baptist Church before their eyes. It was during this interview that Mr. Hart read his letters on communion, which he said should come under the head of "neglected addresses," as- he had once sent them to a denominational paper, and they had been rejected. And these papers Ellen read to her mother. THE OUT-DOOR TABLE. This fall the Lord's table will be spread from one end to the other of all this broad land. The deacons, clad in robes of crimson, secarlet, and gold, will bring in the bountiful store with which the Lord shall spread His table, All manner of fruits of the earth, and every kind of fruit from bush, and vine, and 65   "      tMR. IIAT' S PAPERS. tree, will they bring. Yellow wheat too, and golden corn shall be there., The sacramental wine will the deacons set forth in the little blue and purple goblets, wherein it was poured by the hand of the Lord. Surely, this is the Lord's Table. Only the love and liberality of a God could spread it! Now, this table is governed by a two-fold law-at once of man's devising, and God's ordaining. -Man has made a law, by which he assumes to say, who shall and-who shall not partake at this out-door communion table. Men may hunger for those delicious fruits---they may crave the wheat and the corn, and their lips may thirst for a drink of the wine which fills tlhe delicate cups of, the purpling vine; but all in, vain, unless they can show a property right to the table; or establish their lineage with the owner of that part of the table, which is spread in the land, wherein- they dwoell.        * Moreover, there is a strife of titles to this table; and different men, assumming claimp over the same property, are at war with each other. One section of the table is fenced in -by one man's farm, and another section by another man's farm; and so this table is divided and subdivided among many contending owners. That part, which lies through Mr. A.'s grounds, is lno6wn as Mr. A's table: whichl simply means, that as this man has made laws for this section, the table is at once the table of A., and theo table of the Lord. So, men in their own limited and selfish councils legislate for the right and government of this great out-door banquet-table, and presume to say who may eat and drink, and who may not. DBut there is a higher lacz. The table is not man's   era. nART's PAPEns.      67 table, but the Lord's table. It is presumption for man to call it after his own name. He is, in his best estate, only an humble steward; and let him beware how ho exceeds the boundary of his office. The table is the Lord's: He spread it and gave it its full supply. He alone ordained the law, by which it is governed-a law, written long before any human statute was enacted, and clearly inscribed on the fleshy tablets. That law is appetite-zoant! Not deeds written on parch- ment, and laws passed by men; but human need. A body, adapted by Himr who created it, to the fruits of the earth; the vines and the trees ; and those fruits adapted to thlo body! Over this table in letters of light, tho Lord of the table has written the law :--"BLESSED ARE ALL THEY WHO HUNGER AND THlltST, FOR THEi SHALL BE FTTiTE D." But here is a man who has broken some statute writ- ten in his nature. - He cannot go unto the table for a season, even until he-has paid the penalty of his fault. He is " under discipline." Appetite refuses its office, and hunger declines to conduct him to the feast, until he is restored to health, and thereby to fellowship and com- rmunion at the Lord's out-door table. THE LIGHT AND THE EYE. God has made the light. The eye has a right to the light, by virtue of its creation-because it. is an eye. Now men may stain and paint their windows according to their fancy, and those who desire can takE their sun- light through siuch windows in house or sanctuary: but the glorious light of the sun may not, and cannot be entirely appropriated by the men who dwell within the houses having the stained windows. {    .    68    -  --LIr. aRT's PAhPE rs.  The sun shone, before the building was erected, and will continue to shine when the house is in ruins. It' shines through the curtained windows of wealth, and into the poor man's cottage. It shines for all. It is theo: right of every healthy eye to behold the sun-light; whether through the curious colored windows of the Cathedral, or out in the broad day. If a man abuse his eye, then for a season this commu- nicant at the table of light shall be " under discipline;" being withheld from the glorious banquet. Health restored, it again returns to its place at the sacrament of sun-light, a child of the light and tihe day. God made the light for the eye, and the eye for the light, and ordained laws for both. This feast of sunshine is at once within and without the dwellings of men, and is the common right of all the eyes made to behold it. No man must give laws to my sunlight, nor keep back the two bright communicants of my forehead from this table of the Lord. No man may claim my sunshine--the sun shines for all! THE BIRTHRIGHT COMMUNICANT. A child is born! By virtue of its birth it has a right to sustenance. In all its utter helplessness it is clothed with the authority of its Creator; and its cry is the declaration of the law of God. There is a Lord's table for this little communicant, and that table of love is governed by the Lord's law. Want -appetite: the law of adaptation is the law of the table. Now, let us suppose that the'doctor should say: this new-born child is hungry--it needs nourishnAent, but it has no right under any circumstances to take sustenance from the divinely appointed source, until it has been   MB. HART'S PAPERS.       69 named. The astonished nurse would ask of the learned' doctor his authority to hold back a hungering child. Weo can imagine the grave and solemn physician, with great show of wisdom, answering, as though by his declaration the matter should be settled -forever :-"It is a law written in the one only and acknowledged book for the sick room-the hand-book of all true physicians. In that book, it is declared that no child shall, or can nurse, until, with proper rite and ceremony, it has been named. ' The child that shall partake before it is so named is guilty in act, though unconscious of the sin; and shall gain no strength thereby, being illegally fed." I hear the nurse saying, " that is the acknowledlged law, even the book in thy hand; and, if it so declares, I must surrender my judgment to its declaration.' But I must, with my own eyes, read the words of the law in the book. Nurses have long since learned not to put implicit faith in doctors. Where is the passage?"  The doctor replies, " it is not in the book in so many words; but it is my best judgment, that such law is a fair infer- ence from the general teaching of the book, and tho practice of many physicians. 'That is quite another thing," answers the nurse. "Let the hungering child feed first, and name it after- ward. It may- starve, while you are disputing about the name.' The nurses argument prevailed. The child was first fed and afterward named, thereby taking a sign by which it might be known and designated as a member of the fapmily. But its righlt to sustenance was not by right of its name, but by virtue of its birth. The naming was simply the ceremony, by which it formally took its   * }70     MPr. IIART S PAPERS. place in the household: it was a memnber of the family the moment of its birth, and had the same claim to nursing that it had to naming, and that unanswerable claim was its birthright.      , THE ADOPTED CHLD. A benevolent man finds a poor boy wandering the streets of the great city. Hie is fatherless, houseless, homeless. The good man takes him by the hand and says come with me and be my son. I will clothe you from my wardrobe; feed you at my table ; give you my name. Now, let us suppose that in the house of this good man there was an appointed ceremony, by which an adopted child was declared to be a member of the family. It is the usual order of the house, that this adoption service shall take place, before the new name is publicly assumed, and the privileges of the house enjoyed. The head and lawgiver of the house, however, has never: said, that an adopted child szall not eat before the ceremony of adoption takes place; although it is the goodly custom of the house, that washing-a part of the ceremony--shall ordinarily follow immediately upon adoption, even at the ve:ry door of the dwelling. But this boy is hungry-he will faint unless he is fed, and as the man and boy enter the house, the family are -at the table. lits father takes his place at the head of the tables- his brothers and sisters are eating and drinking. There is no late against his sitting at the table. He is a son, and a brother. The adoption ceremony cannot make him more so; it can only publish a union, which took place in the street the moment- the good man said,   MR. HAT' S PAPERS.      VI **thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee!" Shall he not first sit down at his father's table, and, having satisfied his hunger, then pass through the adop- tion service, with its naming, its bath and its robes? "BELESSED ARE THEY WHO HUSNGEIt AND THRST, FOR THEY SHALL BE FILLED.           ? THE SOLITARY FEAST. In the alms-house there is an old colored woman. Sickness and age, some years since, threw her a pauper upon the cheap charity of the county, and the evening of her troubled life is passing away in the Poor-house. "Aunty," as the people call her, is a devoted disciple of Jesus, a member of the Methodist Church. She is rich toward God. She owns by inheri. tance much real estate, in " the City which hath found. ations;" yes, real; all other property is but the fiction and the dream of an hour.         * It was my privilege, when visiting the alms-house on Sabbath morning, to look in on the old saint. The man who conducted me to her little room, told me, that we had better approach without her knowledge, as it was about the hour of her worship, and he believed that this was ordinance Sabbath. "And do you have the Supper administered here, in the alms-house?"I asked. "No,' he replied, " but 'Aunty,' is too feeble to go out to any church ; so she spreads the feast in her room: at least," he added, " she thinks it is the Supper, and I sometimes-think the old soul gets as much real good, as though she was sitting in the assem- bly of the saints." "But who  administers the ordinance?"I asked.   72 '      M. IInAT'S PAPERS. "Herself alone;" replied the man, "' Aunty 2 is min- ister., deacon, and church." The scene presented, as we reached the room, was a picture for a painter. -*.The door, which was opposite a raised window, was partly open. A vine had climbed the wire grating of the window, and it was filled with -blossoms, whose fragrance came in on the Sabbath air with the bright sunshine. There, on a bench, sat the old woman, quite uncon- scious of our-presence. She had clothed herself in the best that her-pauper wardrobe could afford. Her dress was clean, and neatly ironed, and the cap upon herhead was snow-white, and carefully adjusted. Tmnmediately before her stood a little pine table, covered with a clean white cotton cloth. The entire furniture of the table consisted of a white earthen plate on which were a few small pieces of bread ; and an earthen tea-cup filled mritl /water; while at her side lay a copy of the Bible, and a small lhymn-book. ' Aunty' began the service, by singing from memory two or three verses of a sweet, old, communion hymn, in that tonle and manner so peculiar to her race. She then opened her Bible, and read the story of the crucifixion, as given by Matthew. At the close of the reading, she reverently repeated the words, "'The Lord Jesus the same night he was betrayed, took bread and blessed it "--and then, holding the plate of bread in her hands upon the table, she bowed her head for some moments in silent prayer. The supplication ended, she again took up the Gospel language,s "Take, eat; this is my body broken for you. This do, in remembrance of me," and, as she spiake the sacred words, she took a crumb from the plate, and with   MB. HAT' S PAPEnS.        73 eyes closed, in silence, and in tears, she ato the bread. Again sheo sang a verse:- "Nearer my God to Thee, Nearer to Thee! E'en though it be a cross, That raiseth me Still all my Song shall be, Nearer my God to Thee, Nearer to Thee." Then succeeded the service, beginning, "after the same manner also, he toolk the cup and gave thanks "-and with tho tea-cup of water in her hands, once more she Offered prayer: but this time though her voice was low, almost a whisper, I was able to catch nearly every word. She pr:aised God for temporal blessings-for food and raiment-the shelter of a home in her old age, and for all the countless manifestations of her heavenly Fathler's love in his daily providence. But it was when she passed from earthy blessings to the nzs2peaZkable gift, that her soul took fire, and she spako as one inspired. As I listened, I quite lost sight of the alms-house hall. Christ was visibly set forth crucified before me. She prayed for the poor rich people, who were without Christ; ;and praised God for the heavenly joys of the rich poor people, who were on their way to glory. Then she thanked the Lord, that from the top of Calvary's hill, she could see the IIoly City and hear the singing of the angels. Her offering of thanksgiving and supplication made, she solemnly took the cup, and as she lifted it to her lips, repeated, " drink ye all of it-this cup is the New 4   74       - am. HART S PAPERS. Testament in my blood, shed for the remission of sins; this do in remembrance of me." With these words, she drank from the cup, aEd set- ting it down upon the table, again bonwed her head in silent prayer. "Hallelujah! glory to- God!" she sud- denly exclaimed, as a smile, almost a laugh of holy ecstacy was upon her face. "I sees de gates!" she said, looking up to the ceiling of her little room-"I sees de open door of Heaven! I hears de angels singing! Yes," she continued, "I am on de road, and almost home! tHallelujah!"   Then she sang:- "I'm but a traveller here, Heaven is my home: Earth is a desert drear; Heaven is my home. Danger and sorrow stand, Round me on every hand, Heaven is my fatherland, ^ Heaven is my home. ' "There at my Saviour's side, \ Heaven is my home: I shall be glorified; Heaven is my home. There are the good and blest, Those I love most and best, There too, I soon shall rest, Heaven is my home." At the close of the service, ' Aunry,' turning around, discovered myself standing at the door. "Why, chile," she exclaimed, "I didn't know you was here.  I thought there was nobody near 'Aunty' but de Lord and de angels!" AsI walked taway from  the alms-house that day, I asked myself the question, what in the sight of "do   MR. IIART'S PAPERS.   Lord and de angels," was the full import and signifi- cance of the service I had just witnessed, in the old black woman's room. Might it not have been the Lord's Supper? True, there was no building dedicated to God -no assembly of the saints, and no ordained minister of Christ officiating, according to the forms of the church. In the place of the stately and sacred edifice, only a pauper's little room in an alms-house-instead of the massive table, with its tankards and plates of silver, its bread made of the finest of the wheat, and the goblets filled with the costhest wines, there stood the little, pine table, covered with the coarse cotton cloth, and on it, only an earthen plate holding a few bits of cheap bread, and a white tea-cup filled with water. At that table sat alone, an old black woman, devoutly eat- ing from that plate and drinking from that cup; repeat- ing the sacred language of the Supper,-remembering that Holy One, who, though He was rich, for our sakes became poor.           - Could not the Lord have turned tho alms-house into a sanctuary that day? Might not He, who wrought the miracle at the feast in Cana of Galilee, have changed the cup of water into wine, on that little table? I know not! This I do know, that never have my eyes behelc sacramental vessels more sacred than the plate and cup on "Aunty's " table, and I think that in the book before the throne, there is a record' of holy -communion cele- brated in the county Poor-house, that bright Sabbath morning, by one whom the world calls a pauper. THE TEACHNG OF THE OUTSIDE TABLES. EJ-Thero is a feast, spread at greater cost than tho out-door table, stretching through field, and orchard,   I     75   76   -    M. H ART'S PrAPERS. and vineyard. He, whose hands of lovo- hath laden the table with heavenly wealth, and not man, hath pro- claimed' the law governing the banquet. Soul hunger is the card of admittance to the sacred table. II.-A new-born soul hath a birthright to the banquet of loe. "I.-Tho eye, opened by miracle of graco to behold the light of the Sun of righteousness, hath a claim, above and beyond all human law, to enjoy the lighrt. IV.--The poor child picked up in the dark, cold streets of the world, and by repentance, faith, and love adopted into the holy family, hath a divine right the instant it cries, "Abba! Father!" to all the wealth of its heavenly home. Beyond all creeds and customs of men, it hath -the right by spiritual hunger and thirst, to cat and drink at the feast of the Lord. V.-The alms-house was the Lord's house; the pauper's table was the Lord's table. 4' There," said Ellen, as she finished reading, " these are the papers which Ed read to me in Elder Burden's Study. What do you think of them, mother?" "I like his sermon," said Mrs. Roberts, " with its texts from the orchard, and field-from the nursery, the sun- light, and the dark streets of the city. But I will tell you, daughter, what is uppermost in my mind just now. I should like to have sat down at the pine table in tho Poor-house that day, with'that sister in Christ whom they call' Aunty.' Oh, for a crumb from that plate, and a taste of water from-that earthen tea-cup! It would not have hurt the editor to have published the papers; and I am sure it would have wrought no injury to the reader to havt read them.," ,   CHAPTER VII. DEACON  FOBERTS VISITS THE PASTOR. EARLY one morning there was a rap at the door of the parsonage, and Deacon Roberts entered. ,' Good morning, brother IBurden! Good morn- ing, Mrs. Burden!" he exclaimed. "Beautiful morning; makes one feel young and cliildlike to hear the birds singing, and to smell the buds and blossoms. I some- times almost wish I could get back again into my boy round-about, and take a freshstart. However," said he, thoughtfully, "'spose I would travel the same road that I have come over, with all its crooks and turns. "I have stepped in on an errand," said Deacon Roberts, " and have but a few moments. By the way," said the Deacon to the Pastor's wife, as he turned to go into the Study, " by the way, Mrs. Burden, sister Robin'- son of our church is quite sick. I wish you would happen in some day." "Mrs. Burden! and sister IRobinson-! Mrs. Burden! and brother Burden!" whispered the Pastor's wife, as she was left alono in the room. "It is hard! And he knew it hurt me. If the Baptists," she continued," anre right, it is not such treatment that will ever bring me to join them. That is not the way to transform Mrs. Burden of the Presbyterian Church, into sister Burden of the Baptist Church! I wish Deacon Roberts was only back in the boy's jacket, and would stay there!" As the Pastor and Deacon were seated in the Study, "   78      DEACON EOBERTS' VISIT.  Deacon Roberts said :-"Elder Hartley is in town, and says'he may tarry over Lord's day. Ho is at my house --you know we are old friends-and I think, from a hint he dropped at the tea-table last evening, that he would servo our pulpit a, part of the day, if he was asked." The Pastor replied, that he had no especial objections that he knew of; he had never heard the Elder preach, although he had often heartl of him. "s You say no special objections," said the Deacon," as though you didn't much want him to preach. You havo nothing against him, I suppose?" "Oh, no! I have no charge to make," said Mr. Bur- den. "M3fy only thought was that perhaps, in the present state of feeling, it might be questionable as to the pro- priety of a man of his peculiar mako filling the pulpit." ' Well, I am sure," said Deacon Roberts, "my idea simply was, that he might help tho cause along a little, besides spelling you. I have been a good deal worried to see you working so hard, for fear you would give out. I am nowa-ys anxious in ilho matter. This I know Elder Hartley is a sound man, and tremendous in doc- trine.  Doctrines are really his great forte--has the scripter at his tongue's end." "May have so much there as to leave little for the head and heart," said Mr. JBurden. "However, to settle this matter, let him preach, nest Sabbath morning. I shall not be present." "Stay home, and rest a little, eh " said the Deacon. "No ; it tries me- more, Deacon, to stay at home on Sabbath, than it does to preach," said Mrr. Burden. "No, brother Farewell is quite sick, and his little boy   DEACON ROBERTS' VISIT.     79 was over this morning, just before you came-in, to know if I could get him a supply for a part of next Sabbath." The Deacon looked at the Pastor, with a peculiar expression of countenance which said plainly, dare I tell him now just my thought? Will he stand it? 4 For brother Farewell, eh!" said Deacon Roberts. "You brother a great many people don't you Elder? I have often -noticed that. It is a little peculiar. Well," he continued, "every man has some peculiarity; I know of myself, people say I am a dreadful plain-spoken man.  I was a thinking," said he-he hesitatedl- "Elder,"  .... "What is it, Deacon?" said the preacher. "Elder," he repeated, " now you won't be anyways angry, if I just say a few things between you and me alone, all in love: now will you?." "Am I apt to be angry, Deacon; or at least to show it?" asked the Pastor. "No! bless you, no!" replied the Deacon. "'I did think you was a little touched at my talk about tho Pcdo-baptists, on Sunday at my house. Angry  Oh, certainly not I But do you know, Elder, I have wanted for a long time to say a few things-to you, especially as I know how the church feels in the matter." "Speak your mind, Deacon;"  said the preacher, getting weary of his word-skirmishintg. "Well," said Deacon Ioberts, " to come right to the point, in my plain way, A good many of our-best people, don't likeo your going around so much to these union meetings, band making union speeches. You know that such gatherings are largely made up of Pedo-batists anyway, and that they are alwaysvery ready to give us Baptists the cold shoulder." -    80 '     bEACON ROBERTS' VISIT. "I as not 'aware of that," said the Pastor; ": and if you could convince me that such is the,; fact, I would make some change in my present course." "Oh, I know that ;." replied the Deacon. You would not knowingly lower the glorious old standard!' "Not quite that Deacon,"' responded the Pastor. "Convince me of the spirit which you charge upon my brethren of other denominations-- ' . . "Now," said the Deacon, smiling, as he broke in on the sentence ';if you don't beat all the men in brothering folks! however, you were saying--."  "Yes," said the Pastor, 1 was saying, when interrupted, that convinced that your charge is true, I would, as you sometimes say, double Vmy diligence by going to all the meetings, so far as possible, in view of my own home engagements." "You don't say!" exclaimed Deacon Roberts. "Certainly;" said the Minister, "if it was nothing more than to rebuke my misguided brethren-- "Yes, brethren ;" said the Deacon-" by showing them a better spirit. -The best and only Christian provocation is to provoke men to good works."  "But," said the Deacon, ': you know, that with all our brothering, it is always a trick of theirs to throw us out at last--to draw the line of separation in one place, and that is the Lord's table. The way, Elder, is this. After they ha hahad a grand union meeting for a number of days, they propose the celebration of a feast, at which they know we, as good Baptists, cannot take seat. And so, having used us as long as necessary, they then virtually turn us all out of doors. This was the case in-Phila- delphia, and the same thing was repeated at St. Louis. Now, between us, Elder, how do you get over that? You know Baptist usage. Your conscience won't let you   ' DEACO=I rLOBIERTS7- VSIT.    81 sit clown at what - they call the Lord's table. It is, as the Gospel has it, eating and drink7ing damnation, to our souls. There you have it!"- "I will not," said the Pastor, " now go into that mat- ter. - I will only say, that if I was of their faith, it would hardly bo a question whether I should forego what I would deem at once a right and a privilege, because tho conscience ofsome one present would not permit him to sit down with me at the banquet. "This, I say, I would declare, if I was a Pedo-baptist; five hundred men, of churches other than our own, were in a church, and a hundred Baptists were present; the simple question was just this: should the five hundred forbear to enjoy what they honestly deemed- a holy privilege, because of the views of a lundred men of another faith? No doubt," he added, " some' unworthy man might have a cheap triumph by such a result." "But," said Deacon Roberts, " you didn't stay." '; I did not," said the Pastor, " you know. With my viO ws of doctrine, I could not: I left; that was my rilght-they stayed; that was their right. I cannot' see in this the manifestation of that unkind spirit which you imagine ; nor can I call it as you say, a PIedo-bap- tist trick. Therro aro mice and men in every church. Dut, as I before said, I will not go into this matter now. And as to the qucstion of brotherhood, and all other questions of liberality, at some futuro and early day I -will give my views at length. "I will call my official advisers and counsellors the deacons together, and we will talk the matter over in that Spirit of brotherly liberality' and Christian frankY- ness which has ever marked our intercourse." "So then you will preach for Mr. Farewell, next Sun- .. , v   82      .DEACON EOBERTS' VISIT. diay, and brother Hartley will fill our pulpit," said the Deacon. ." Now understand,' said he, "I don't want to dictate in this matter in the least. If it is not perfectly satisfactory to'you I wont have him preach." "He can preach next Lord's day morning Deacon," said Mr. Burden, " and I will preach in theo evening." "By the way," said the Deacon, as he was going out, "' we ought to have a meeting of the deacons. There is young Ward, who went away from the table with his Methodist wife: I have had a talk with him, and he shows a very unchristian spirit. There is a work of discipline to be dono in tho church; and the sooner the better. There is no question in his case. The Master says, if a man loves his wife better than the Lord, lie is un- worthy." "Where did he go?" asked the Pastor. ("Home I believo," replied the Deacon. "And he was not out in the evening, thouTgh it was baptism. They say he was seen with his wife at theo Methoclist Church but I don't know. Something is to bo doneo Elder; something is to be done to fence in the flock -My judgment is that the doctrinal rails must bo put up." "Well then, I will say to Elder Hartley that he will fill the pulpit next Lord's day morning," said Deacon RPoberts. '"Yes ;" said the Pastor. And Deacon Boberts left him, 's for a season." As he went out of the Study, Mrs. Burden came in. "Well," said she, " husband what is the matter with the plain-spoken mian  I hope heo took no offence at my conduct last Sabbath.  '"No," said the husband, ' I think he feels a. little f    DEACON ROBERTS VISIT.      83 troubled at his courseoat that time. - But his errand was to get my consent for Elder Hartley to preach next Sabi bath morning in my pulpit." "Well you said no, did you not?" asked Mrs. Burden. "Oh no;" said 3lr. Burden, "I have consented. I shall not be present however. You know brother Fare- well is sick, and I will immediately let him know thaft'I will serve him, by filling his pulpit in the morning.' "I will go with you," said Mrs. Burden. "I would munh rather," he replied,- that you would go to our church, and hear Elder Hartley; that I may know from you how the affair goes off." " ( But (do you think it right," asked M-rs. Burden, " in tho state of feeling existing in the church, to let that man in? He cannot be in sympathy with the peculiar religious interest now prevailing, and may undo all that you havelabored to accomplish for days and weeks in that congregation." "I know it, my dear," he replied, "I know it; but for peace sake I said yes. You know Deacon Roberts as well as I do. And although he said he would leave the matter entirely with me, still we both are aware just whdt that talk means. I think, as it is, that he is angry because I am not to be present on the occasion, andoyou know he does not like to have me preach in a Pedo-bap- tist pulpit any way." "Husband," said the wife, " they seem to feel that they have bought you, body and soul, mind and estate, for so many dollars and cents per year, and a small price at that; and for you to use your influence in any way elsewhere is a, breach of contract" ' Some may feel so, my dear," he replied, " but this is not the sentiment of the church." l   841      DEACON ROBERTS' VISIT. "I hope it is not," she replied; " but I hear more than you do."' '"Some Sabbaths ago, when you preached for Dr. Parsons they talked pretty plain in the matter. Mrs. Sanger said she thought if they hired a minister they ought to have him. And if he worked for others, other people ought to pay a part of his-salary." "They do not seem to know," said M[r. Burden, "thbat in -proportion as I extend my influence in the fields around me, I increase my own church. They are not intelligently selfish in this.". "God is my witness,' he added, " that I recognize my covenant obligations with that church: it is my place of special labor. Its people are my people, and its faith is my faith. But," he continued, with an emphasis which made his cheeks tocrimson with excitement, "I will use my judgment in this matter. That church is the centro: from it, I will work out; and to it I will gather all the influence and strength within my power. A true minis- ter's life, my dear, is much more than the regular ser- vice of a church, with its Sabbath and its weekly meet- ings, all important as these meetings are in their proper place. My religious influence is my treasure, committed to me by the Master, and I must put it out to the best usury. "I will not neglect, or in any way slight my work in my own church; but if I do ' overwork' for God and humanity elsewhere, that is my business- and not theirs.' So the next Sabbath morning Mr. B. preached for his Pedo-baptist brother, and Elder Hartley held forth in the Baptist pulpit. The Elder came to the church in the Deacon's own carriage, and was evidently under his   x,/?        DEACON ROBERTS' VISIT      83 especial care. As the Deacon led his man into the house, and conducted him up the aisle, his look said. plainly as words could say: "here I come, bringing with me a preacher to give you each a ' portion in duo season.' " The Preacher was a man of strong frame-his large head was covered with steel-mixed hair, which was combed carefully back behind his ears. His deepset eyes and firmly compressed mouth, told of a man of' great determination ; while the general- expression of his countenance was of great self-reliance and self-con- ceit. He evidently knew that he was quite equal to the work before him, and that nothing less than an inter- ference of Divine Providence could check or disturb ldis purpose. His dress was plain and old-fashioned, and he sported a very large red bandanna handkerchief, which was ever and anon brought forth from- its lhiding place, and shaken out to its full proportions, as prelim- inary to a long trumpet blast from his very long noso. Frequently, during his discourse, a whole sentence was lost in the sound of the nasal trumpet, as that famous organ was buried in the folds of the huge handkerchief. His pulpit oratory was marked by great muscular eloquence. At the close of any earnest, doctrinal sen- tence, he would smite the desk with his clenched fist, and then, with both hands, rib back his long grey hair, as if preparing to go head-foremost through some con- troversial door. He wore spectacles, which, a pait of the time rode in gleaming triumph astride his nose, and at other times were on the top of his head, as though he would with one set of eyes look up to heaven for inspi- ration, while with the other pair he steadily measured the astonished audience. IIo hade a peculiar way of   86      DEACON RiOBERTS"VISIT. looking over tho top of his spectacles at times, and giving to his face a most quizical expression, while at the same moment he would come down solidly upon his heels, as though he would show the audience how firm was his foundation, hdw immnovable his doctrinal basis. In his prayer, which was very long, he first carefully set-forth the divine attributes-described the angels as vailing their faces-took. a grand excursion to the furthest boundary of the universe, and informed the Deity as to his own purposes and plans for the children of men, and finally closed, with a petition for a blessing upon the word about to be declared at that time by " the Lord's unworthy dust."' As he opened his eyes upon the people, his look seemed to say, " there is a prayer for you worth hear- ing ;" and taking up the hymn book, he lined the hymn, and with evident relish joined in the singing, " making melody" with his nose, and frequently attracting the attention of the audience; interrupting the voice of praise by a flourish and free use of his pulpit appendage L-the great bandanna handkerchief--and prolonging the echoes of sacred sound, with a long and loud blast front his trumpet nose. Before entering upon his sermon, he informed the people that he was "' troubled in his pipes ;" and, there- fore, he should not- dwell as long as he would othlerwise. His sermon was full an hour and a half in length, and the pipes held out, although at times the preacher bellowed like a bull of Baslian. It was a sweeping discourse. He utterly overthrew the lMfethodists--scat- tored the Presbyterians like chaff before the -hurricane; and, indeed; put all the Pedo-baptist host to flight,   DEACON noBERTS' VISIT.      87 routed and ruined. As for the Universalists, lie sent them in one unbroken column down the steeps of ruin, and dealt eternal death without one gracious exception to all men of papal faith.

H With a preliminary blast of the nasal trumpet, and a careful adjustment of the old horn-bowed spec- tacles upon the top of his head, he began:- "This my brethren, is tho voice of the prophet, to a degenerate and wicked people. But the text is equally applicable to all the generations of men, and never more so'than in this our own day. "The Covenant people had fallen asleep, and the shout of a prophet, yea, even the blast of a trumpet was needed to awake them out of sleep--' Cry aloud and spare not; lift up your voice like a trumpet!' "They had backslid! Backslidin' was the favorite mode of travellin' of them Israelites. Yea; nor them alone; but the same may be said of the entire human race. Let us-go back th Adam.

Satan came and preached open communion, and told them they had a right to eat of any tree they could find in the garden." Deacon Roberts and Deacon Winston sat in the pew directly in front of the pulpit, and at the close of this sentence, Deacon Roberts, turning to his brother, exclaimed with an air of triumph, " there you have it!" The Elder continued: "AlasI they listened -to the voice of the evil preacher. Eve went first ; then she led her husband to this Pedo-baptist table, even as it is to- day my brethren"--"What a shot 1" whispered Deacon nWinston to Deacon Roberts--"What was the result?" shouted the preacher. a Fell!

"But," he continued, "let us come down; for time is passing, and I have a burden to the people in this land. As I have said, the sin of open communion turned our first parents out of the Garden of Eden; thoe great first church established for the race of man. Here let the Baptist Church read her duty of discipline.

The Elder-continued : : I pass over the ages and gen- erations of men. The great church of Israel was close communion-shut up in its own land.

"A little church got into the promised land-grew to a countless multitude.- Again they took to brothering   ELDERn H 'AEEYs BuERMON.    91 the heathen.

Where does the Methodist get his Arminianism from? limping with may-bes, and stumbling with ifs. Don't tell me of their works of charity, and labors of love. The tree is proof enough of the fruit.

Her tree of doctrine is corrupt, root and branch I -and therefore it cannot be of the Lord's plantin'. Therefore, again, there is a moral impossibility that that tree can bring forth love and good works. Take the Episcopalians.

"( And as for the Roman Cath6lics, it works both ways with them. They won't send their schools, anl tho other schools won't have them. So I guess they'll stay. But as I was a sayin' of the Episcopalians, they boast of their Sunday Schools; and' in the cities, their Mission Schools; their works of charity in building Hospitals and IIomes.

Now we know ive are right ; so we know they are wrong." "What wouldn't I give if our Pastor was here," whis- pered Deacon Winston. "You'll see!" said Deacon Roberts.  "He hasn't reached the heft of his argument yet."' "What do I see?" exclaimed tho orator. "Shall I declare the vision of these two eyes?"IBis eyes were turned toward the distant door -of the meeting-house, and lxis spectacles were in their old location on the top of his head, and it was a question in which direction, perpendicular or horizontal, he discovered the revelation. "'I will lift up my voice like a trumpet; I will cry aloud and spare not.' I see, my brethren, tho dreadful-door- way of perdition, and standin' at its side Satan, with eyes flashing with hellish joy--his face darkened by sin, and as it were blackened by iniquity, lookin' a look of triumph and of victory." (The ,negro sexton, alarmed by the looks and words of the excited preacher, fled from the door to a side room.) "I s6e a vast procession movin' on-I see the ioman Society gpin' through that door into outer darkness ; and the ]Episcopaliah Society goin' into the place where the IPoman Society stood- the lMethodist Society goin' into the place where theo Episcopalian Society stood-the Presbyterian Society, and the Reformed Society goin' into the place where the Miethodist Society stood; and the Baptists-Ah, breth- ren, the Baptists! where are they? Thousands and thousands of them at the encl of the procession, movin' and movin' steadily on in that misguided, infatuated multitude. And now, I behold an Angel in shinin' gar. ments drawin' nigh to a true Minister of the Gospel. I see him tallkin' to him, and with his hand pointin' to the   "     ELDER -HAnTLEY'S SERMON. - procession. I behold him puttin' into the man's hand a trumpet, and the man, obejent to the 'vision, takes'his stand upon a knoll near the passin' crowd, and puttin' his trumpet to his lips, he cries aloud: ' Stop I Stay, in your mad career ' '" The Roman Society has already gone through, but he calls to the Episcopals, anid all the- other societies: "Stop! And ye, misguided Baptists, turn round, and march back to your native river! Stop not till you reach the banks of Jordan; slop not there, but move onward and let all the societies follow. There is no salvation, except in Caaaan's fair and happy land, and there is no reachin' that land but by the way of Jordan, and there is no bridgin' the stream. ' Lift up your voice liko a trumpet; cry aloud and spare not!' " X1 this was shouted at the top of his voice, and at the conclusion, he seemed for a moment utterly overcome. Said Deacon Roberts to Deacon Winston, " did you ever hear anything equal to that in all your born days  That's what I call preachin'. Why, they could have heard him over to the Methodist Church." Having leaned a moment upon his spear, the recovered Warrior resumed the fight. -  Who is my brother?" ("Now for it!" said Deacon Roberts.) "I answer, every member of the church of the Lord! "What is the church? I answer, a body of baptized believers. Who are baptized believers? I answer, those who have been immersed, on a profession of their faith, and they only. Who is my brother?  ELvcry regular Baptist, and he-only! When I brother a ma n, I thereby declare my relation to him-in the flesh, a blood re- lation; if in the spirit, a church relation." i .   ELSDEn HArITLEY'S SEnMO. --   95 "There you havoe it" whispered Deacon Roberts to Deacon Winston. H'e's a giant in argument," responded Deacon Winston. "Truth is mighty! -We'ro getting the heft of the argument now," said Deacon Roberts. 'L Wliat oou ldn't I give, if only our minister was here." "Well, his wife is here, that will do," said Deacon Winston: " his sermon is like a thunder storm, and the shower is right over us." That was true; the lightning was striking and the thunder rollingtrees were uptorn, and goodly dwellings were cast down; but unlike the summer storm, no bright rainbow was hung upon the cloud to relieve its blackness; and no blossoms sprang up in its path, breathing fragrance sweet, as charity. The preacher went on: " the declaration! of brother- hood is, the publication of kindred--whatfellowsMp 7ath - Ight iviht darkness? You know the whole passage, my brethren. What brotherhood have we with the unbap- tized? men in the darkness of error! I will eat with my brother, and he with me at a common table in our 'father's house, and he shall not stop me nor I him; nor need we go through the formality of inviting .ono the other, as though wo were not blood relations, and under the same roof. Is tho Pedo-baptist Church--so called -my father's house? But say you, in my father's house, the Lord declares, there are m any sions. Exactly so, my brethren ; he spake of the house in heaven. In the earthly house, there is only one room, and the door of entrance is baptism, and baptism is immersion; and he yho isn't immersed isn't baptized; and if he isn't baptized he hasn't passed through the door; and therefore, my brethren, therefore he is notin the house ; yea, the house where alone the Lord's table can be spread. 'Lift up your voice like a  trumpet; cry aloud and spare not!'   O6    .  ELDER HARTLEY'S SERMON. -Now to make him my brother, puts him in ho house, seats him at the table, nakces him a disc2lo I/ "Lastly my brethren, as to the final condition of the unbaptized, what shall we say? Truth is truth. I can.. not go back of the Bible, or be more charitable than the sacred word of Scripter itself. To the law and the tes- timony. The word is plain: ' He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.' I only say the Pedo-baptist is not baptized; I say nothing of his futer. Is lie in the, church? He is in wilful disobejence. I say wilful, for he will not come to the light, because he loves darkness better tlan light. Then he is in open sin. "What! shall I say he cannot get the truth, with the Bible in his own tongue, on the table, in his own house? Not responsible for stumblin' in theo dark, when he can buy a damp to his feet and a light to tis path' for two shillings? Don't hie hold the ungodly responsible for the sin of ignoranco? Shall not WeU do so by the same argument?" "There you have it!"' whspered Deacon Roberts. "Just as I said at my hou"selast Sunday. Brother Hart thought it dreadful language, and so did my wife. LAnd our Tminister's wife, she went off up stairs and cried, for she said it was equal to saying her mother, who died unbaptized, was lost. I wonder what they think now .") The preacher continued: "Brethren, let us hear the conclusion of tine whole matter. Keep the command- ments-all the commandments. Now let me, in closing, say a few fwords by way of counsel and warnin' to the members of this church. Who believes a Roman Catholic can go to heaven? Why not? Because he is not in the church-he is wilfully ignorant. Who believes   ELDEt HAMTLEY'S SERMON.     97 a Universalist can go to Heaven Why not? 3ecause he is not in the church--he is wfl/?ly ignorant.

"Shal I e brother the wicked? Shall we have fellow- ship with unbelievers? Shall we commune with them  What communion hath light with darkness s Beware, my brethren; it is a sickly age.

We must be consistent with our profession atnd docrine. Stand up for the  truth! Yea, ' cry aloud and spare not; lift up your voice like a. trumpet. Amen. When the preacher was throug, he said, "the choir will sing a hymn of their own selection;" and they sang that beautiful hymn, by good old Dr. Baldwin, of Bald- Wrin Placo Baptist Church, Boston:- beginning: "From whence doth this union arise, That hatred is conquered by love? It fastens our souls in such ties, As distance and time can't remove. [qNoT o..- The writer has given, in this harangue of nElder Hartley, ill many respects the counterpart, if not in'matter, 'at least in style, of a discourse, which it was his lot to hear, one summer Sunday, lp among the   98      ELDER HA TLEY'S SERMONo mountains of Pennsylvania, from a man known among the people as a "Hardshell Baptist." Perhaps some one of the company, who was in that country school-house that day, will remember the scene, and especially call to mind the frequent and terrible blasts from the preacher's - trumpet, and the flourish of the great, red handkerchief, as the hearers "' suffered a word of exhortation " for two mortal hours.        . The preacher, at the close of the sermon, said he would like to dwell upon other " pints," but must stop because of a trouble in his " pipes." Some of the noblest, of all the list of those whose names may be found in the-army roll of Christian warriors, are men, rough in appearance, and rude in speech ; ignorant in the wisdom of the schools, but " wise toward 'God ;" inspired with a heavenly eloquence, and mighty in the Scriptures: men whose whole life is a succession of battles and of victories under the Captain of Salvation. These brave old warriors are the -pride and glory of the church in every age of her history. They won their epaulets on the field of holy conflict, and no one reveres their memory more than the writer of these lines. But this Elder Hartley is the representative of quito another class, most abundant in years gone by, although the race is not extinct to-day. Men, who believe their church to be the only people of God, and who give but doubtful hope of salvation to the poor soul--no matter what his Christian character--who happens to differ with them in creed; men, whose anathemas were supposed to:blight and blast all the territory of mankind lwhich was not fenced in, as the foreordained, divinely appointed enclosure, of their own peculiar faith.]   CATTAPTER IX.,'  FLDER    ARTLEY AND PEACON  FOBERTS YISIT THE  PASTOR. IDER    HartlEey's sermon hadl wrought all the evil g V for which the worst enemy might have most fervently prayed. The church had been - indoc- 'inatec]," but it was an expensive process. Neighboring churches were embittered and disgusted; for the 13aptist denomination in general, and thaevans- dale Village Church in, particular, had to bear all the offlnce of that JSabbath sermon. While it was true that the strength of the church was shocked at the bald bigotry and vulgarity of Elder Hartley, still it put a weapon in thie hand of every enemy. And the friends of other faiths could ask, with some emphasis of argument, if the legitimate logic of "close communion" did not inevitably conduct the  candid mind, to tihe conclusions presented in their worst form by the rough old man that morning. So, for a long timo, the members of Evansdale Baptist Church had to undergo a sort of theological inquisition, and, in a thousand ways, encounter " RIaptist doctrine, " as presented by Elder Hartley. The Pastor, the- nest day, meeting  a brother of the IMethodist Church, saluted him, as usual with a "good morning, brother A." ie responded, "I don't know about the 'brother,' after brother; arley's sermon. I am   afrid the IRaptist faith, as set forth last Sunday, *  ' * ^ *   *'    -    100  ELDER HARTLEY & DEACON IODIERTS' VISIT. leaves me in a doubtful brotherhood with you of the ' close communion' creed. Indeed, for all I can see, all Pedo-baptists are quite outside the church, and with no comfortable prospects for the land beyond the river. Your preacher declared, again and again, that we-not being baptized-had no right to sit at the Lord's table. And surely, if we 'are unworthy to have 'a name and a place in the Lord's house on earth, we are equally unfit to sit at the banquet spread in the heavenly mansion. He, moreover, proclaimed the doctrine, in no doubtful language, that there was no salvation without baptism, and that there was no baptism but immersion. "Coming out of the church," said this man, "I asked one- of your leading men-Deacon Roberts-what lie thought of the sermon. ' Endorse every word of it!' exclaimed the deacon. ' Good, old-fashion Baptist doc- trine!' "' Knowing that your wife was a Presbyterian, and Mis wife a member of the Methodist Church, I replied . but Deacon, it was rather hard for your good Pastor and yourself also, each with a wife unbaptized, and in full membership with the Pedo-baptists." "'Never mind where it hits,' he answered : 'truth is truth! we mutst not be more charitable than the Lord.' "You are in no danger of that sin, I replied." The Baptist Minister answered: "I do not need to tell the inhabitants of this village, yourself not excepted, my brother that I love all men who love Jesus, and that my hearty and joyful fellowship of the Saints knows no boundary but-the extent of the sacrifice for sin, the saving efficacy of the blood of Christ. My wife, sir, is, I have nodoubt, a devoted disciple of Jesus. I know that I shall meet her in a world of glory, which long since   ELDER HBRTLEZ & DEACON nOBEnTS' tS.   101 opened its golden gates to my Presbyterian father and mother. A  world, my dear brother, in which the denominational distinctions and doctrinal divisions, now found on earth, shall have no place! Let me acd," said Elder Burden, "that the great Baptist Church, as you know, looks upon every blood-washed soul-baptized or not baptized-as an heir'of heaven, a member of the universal church of Christ. You know, for yont are an intelligent Christian, that the charge so often made, that with the Baptists, baptism is a 'saving ordinance, is utterly without foundation. Weo believe baptism to be the ordinance of the church, even as the Lord's Supper is the ordinance of the church. "Baptism is the door of the visible church, and there is no entrance to regular membership in that church, but- throughi that door!" "Well then," said the man, "I don't see but that you and the Elder agree at least in this, that our Pedo- baptist churches are just no churches at all. "Tmmersion only being valid baptism, o ehave not entered the only door of the church, and therefore are not in the church.  This was Elder Hartley's argument, and if his premise was right, there was no avoiding his conclusion, which- was that only the church could spread the Lord's table, and therefore the Lord's Supper was not in the Pedo-blptist Churches so called.' "And still further, that it was a moral impossibility for a  Pedo-baptist, while in that faith, to partake of the Lord's Supper, having no right, because of his disobedi- ence, to go to that table spread in the Baptist.

It is not my desire to open a school 'of   102  ELDEI HARTLEY '&A DEACON IOBERTS' VISIT; theology on the corner of a street: but just tell me yourself, now, what else can I say?" He replied, " there is much that you could say! . "Much that that warm, loving heart of yours, I should think, would say, and I believe some day it will say! This you could say!-every soul that loves Jesus is in Christ; and though he may have errors of doctrine, yet if he has, by all the light shining upon the path of duty, according to his conscience, taken his place with the people of God, let him go to the Lord's table, for he is the Lord's disciple and a part of the true church, and Zeave the responsibility (if the act twith himself before God, where it belongs. It is very well, my brother, to weed the Lord's garden; but I question the right of any man to pull up plants, so evidently of the Lord's right hand's planting, as are such persons as old Deacon Saybrook, and your own good wife." "But," said the Baptist Minister, the Lord's table is governed by the law of the Lord." "True," replied neighbor A. "And does the Lord say, that no one, having the baptism of the Holy Ghost, but without the baptism of water, shall celebrate .tho Lord's death at the Supper?" The Minister replied, "it is the spirit of the teaching of Christ!" "But, did He say it?" asked the man. "Where is the book, chapter, and verse? And if the pre-requisite of baptism was clearly declared in so many words, would not He, who looks on the heart, forgive an error of an honest, humble saint-an error of love, manifest, too- think of it!-in a desire to show forth His death on tho cross? If He prayed for those, who in ignorance crucified Himr, saying, 'Father, forgive them, for they   ELDER HARTLEY & DEACON ROBERTS' VISIT  103 know not what they do ;' think you He would not forgive a soul, ignorant of the doctrine of baptism, but over- flowing with love, in its humble Aionest effort to celebrate a Saviour's death?  Can He forgive an ignorant murderer, and condemn an ignorant disciple?" U' Well," said Elder Burden, " some future day we may talk further on this matter." Everywhere, as I said, Mr. Burden found the evil influence consequent, upon the great victory of Elder Hartley's sermon. The devout in the, church were pained to see the effect among those who had just entered the church, and others who were seeking Christ; that '-'Mr. Controversy," of w/hom Whitfield used to speak, and whose influence he so much dreaded, had entered the houtse of God. Contention usurped the place of united effort for Christ, and the gentle dove took its flight. Returning to his home, he found, to his surprise, that Elder Hartley and Deacon Roberts were waiting in the parlor to see him. "I believe you have met before," said Deacon Roberts, as the Pastor took Elider Hartley by the hand.  "Do you malke much of a stay in our village?" asked tho Pastor. "No," replied Elder Hartley, "I tarry but a night." (these men always tarry). Thought I would drop in on you a few moments just to say how do do. How's your bodily health? Look kinder pale!

"I was sorry, said Deacon Roberts, " that the Pastor felt -called upon to. preach for Mr. Farewell, of the Congregational Society, for it did seem that he really needed rest. tHowever, he says he rests moro by preaching than by keeping still. I That I can't under- stand,'t said the Deacon, "'but you ministers are somehow different from us ordinary members." c' Well, 1 don't know," said Elder Hartley. ' Work is work. A man can talk and not draw on his strength : I know it is so with me. But preaching is another thing!" "Yes," said Deacon Roberts, " such a sermon as you gave us last Sunday, Elder, must have pulled pretty strong on you." "Yes," replied Elder Hartley, "I felt it: but I some- times think, a man has supernateral strength given him, when he is called to a great battle -against the -devil. I confess I felt my undergirdins very sensibly in the discourse last Sabbath morning." "Can you always tell," asked Deacon Roberts, "when you are to have such an exercise as you had last Lord's- day? "Yes, pretty generally feel the approachin9 power," replied Elder Hartley.- "There is- signs that is unmis- takable; but the human mind is, after all, a unfathom- able depth, and a mystery. Accordin' to Scripter, 'we are fearfully and wonderfully made."' ' Then, turning to the Pastor, he asked, "was that a fair sample of your morning audience v." Heo replied, that he was not present, having to preach for brother Farewell, but, from what he had heard, he should think it was the usual assembly.      ELDER HRTL  & DEACON ROBERTS' ISIT. 105 "Rather beyond the average, Pastor ;" said the Deacon. . "You know it got whispered round, brother Hartley, that you were here. I think I never -but once saw so many in the house of a morning, and that you recolledt, Pastor, was the day you exchanged with Elder Millford. 'What for an audience did &ou haveo" asked Deacon Roberts -of Mr. Burden;- "I saw so -many from other churches present with us, that I feared you, might not have a very large attendance." . ' Oh, yes," said the Pastor, - I had a good house. Brother Farewell, who was present, said, that it was an average audience.' "We all have our peculiarities," said Elder Hartley. "No man is free! I notice- you speak of the man, at the head of the Society where yot preached, as a brother. Alight I ask why you call him brother?" "Oh yes," replied Mr. Burden. "I look upon the Pastor of tthe Congregational Church as my' brother in Christ and in the ministry." "Yes?" replied Elder Hartley. "Regular Pedo-bap- tist, I 'spose?" "Yes," said the Pastor. "But can you, my brother, in all Christian -honesty, as one who expects. to answer at the judgment, call a man livin' in open disobejence to a divine comnmarnd- one who is not a member of the church of Christ- one who has never sat down to the Lord's table-  unbaptized Wman-I say, can you call such au man. brother?"

The Pastor, paying no heed to the remark of his Deacon, turned, directly to Elder Hartley, saying, " my brother, I do not intend to be drawn into a controversy at this time, although your remark was made for that purpose." Not -at at all, said Elder Hartley, "nob at all; I simply threw out the sayin' in a friendly way." '"The worthy Pastor of the Congregational Church" (":church too!" said Elder Hartley)-" is my brother," :o continued Mr. Burden. s"It is a brotherhood begotten in Christ Jesus, our common Saviour. Redeemed by the same blood-inspired by the same Spirit-laboring in the same cause--and on the road to the same heaven, he is in the strongest sense my brother, and the mem- bers of his church by an equal tie of holy kindred are my brethren in the Lord." "Well," said Elder Hartley, "I am an older man than you, fand I can only say that I am sorry to hear you a usin' the language of the world, instead of the language of 'Caanan's fair and happy land.' The Gospel 'rails, Deacon, is gettin' let down in these days.!' "But you must let me say for my Pastor," said -Deacon Roberts to Elder HEartley, Ithat I know my :Pastor, and- that ho means well at heart; though, with yodu, I am often tried, in, seeing the way he brothers people."' "iIt fis talkin. the languago of the people througll . .whose territory we are passin'," said Elder Hartley. :We should have our conversation in Heaven. More- over, it is -a dangerous way of talkin'.

('I Wish!' exclaime( Deacon Roberts.) "Why," said Elder Hartley, "yot might as well brother a Universalist, or a Romar Catholic."               !' There may be a  devout Christian among the Uni versalists, and 'even among the Roman Catholics," saic Mr. Burden. '"And wherever I find a Christ-loving God-fearing  man, I find a brother beloved. Some men, my brethren, are better than their creeds, and some men are worse. I can brother a man without endorsing his creed, just as I can have the felloship of liberty with a true patriot, without endorsing his political faith.  Indeed," said 'the Pastor, with some spirit, "Elder Hartley, there are some violent, bigoted men, in the Baptist Church itself, whose only claim to brotherhood is in the fact that they have been bap- tized. Their right to demand fellowship with me, is simply a 'water privilege.' So Paul found brotherhood even with a devout heathen honestly striving for theright, and reading the name of God in the spelling book of nature, which swas all his library; yes, and gave him too a far better prospect of heaven than you gave the saint in the Pedo-baptist Church last Sabbath morning, if I am  rightly informed. I say, Paul, in Romans, found a brotherhood with the uncircumcised Greek,- who' -vor- shipped God by the light of nature, which he -did not find with one of his own nation, whose only claim was circumcision. But let me say, my brother, that I -will not pursue this subject at this time, having an appoint- ment of another character, as Deacon Roberts is aware, when this very subject will be thoroughly examined,"  "Well, well; Elder," replied the visitor, " we will have no hardclwords, for. it is my charitable belief thea t  *  '   108  ELDER HARTLEY & DEACON RDOBERTS' VISIT. your, intentions is good, while -I must say that yonu position is a dantgerous one for tho denomination. And as for my sermon, it does not -become me. to blow my own trumpet "-at this saying, the red bandanna waved, and the familiar and' fearful blast sounded out again, from the long nose. As he took his hat, and with the Deacon, who during this passage at arms stood looking out the window, started from the door, he said, taking the Pastor by the h"and," well, all I can say is, if I believed 'that a Pedo-baptist was all you make him, I should lardly dareto say he had no right to the Lord's Supper." ". But," said the Pastor, " is he not disqualified by a failure to conform to the law of baptismn?" : Well, may-be so! Good day!" said he. So saying, himself and the Deacon at once withdrew from- the field'of controvesy, tand toe parsonage. As the two walked along to the Deacon's house, they had much conversation by the way, Deacon Roberts opening 'the discourse. "TWell," said he, " you have taken tho measure of my Pastor, brother Hartley. I have, as I have told you before, been greatly tried with his' liberal views' as heo calls them. Come to the law, he will enforce it as he did that communion day in walking old Deacon Say- brook away from the Lord's table. You couldn't have done better yourself. But,' he continued, " the very nexst sermon he preached, he let down every fence and undid all the good of the act at the table. Still, he has in him after all -a beautiful spirit of holy love," said Dea- con Roberts. "Docs he preach open communio-n?" asked the Elder.

"For, while he says as plain as a man can say it that believers' baptism is a pre-requisito for the Lord's table; at the same time, all his brothering men in other socie- ties, and all his speeches at Christian Association meetings and the like, is nothing less than open com- munion. You got a specimen of it, this morning , continued the Deacon. "You heard with your own ears his talk about Universalists, and even the Roman Catholics! There you have i! Now I tell you just what it is, Elder, and this talk is between us as two brethren "--"Certain," said the Elder--"There has got to be a change! The poison is working in the commu- nity! The Pedo-baptists are saying every day, that the Baptist Minister is too liberal for his church. What real right had he to preach in that Congregational pulpit, when you come to it?" ' Well," said the Elder, " the thing is just here. We are called to preach -the Gospel to every creature-so runs the commission.  We are in duty bound to preach to the heathen. And I  can imagine a man agoin' into that pulpit, and doin' his whole, bounden duty. Like my text, ' Cry aloud and spare not!  Tell tho, people their sins!' I would like a chance of that kind myself: in Christian love, I would have told them in so many twords, that goin' into a Pedo-baptist pulpit I was still a Baptist minister. That they couldn't 'muzzle tho ox that treadeth out the corn.' And if I wouldn't have. trod on their corns!" This brought a  hearty laugh from the Deacon as he exclaimed, "Elder, that is too good!  I'll be bound their  understandin' would suffer if you got among them' " *    "O ELDEnR ARTLEY & DEACON- ROBERTS V SITr. ' But to be serious," said the Elder; "I should have Iold them in all love"- Of course," said the Deacon "That they was no church, bein' unbaptized: and, that while I had nothing to say of the awful futer awaitin' them that refuse to walk in the light when they have got it, and them that wont seek the light that they might get it." There you have it!' said the Deacon. "I would just have read the passage that I quoted Sun- day mornm g : 'He that belleveth And is baptized shall be'saved, and he that believetri not shall be damned.' I would have laid that truth right on them, and let it be. Just like puttin' a live coal on a turtle's back, and lettin' him alone. It's always better, Deacoi--at least I find it so--to quote some such passage that does its own burnin', and then .sa-y .nothe!. n  Then you know, if they squirm they can't blame you. Their fight is with etarnal truth. You remember the sayin', 'be ye as wise as sarpints'. I'd ruther preach to such a con- gregation a great sight, than to the one I had last Sunday. But when I preacll in a Baptist Church such a sermon as I gave you, I have two objects in -view: first, in loading the guns of the faithful believers to fire at the enemy; and second, in kinder shorin' up the doctrines of some of the members, who are like-- well, we both loveo him in the Lord-like your good Minister."          -  "Well," said Deacon Roberts, " o needed, as you have seen yourself this morning, we needed the sermon, and I know the Lord will bless it.

'Leave such matters for another occasion. The weaker a man is, the more, Deacon, he needs our strengthl. You know the Scripter, ' strengthen tho weak."'

So he did; but the wind bein' rather strong, and havin' only one hand, he couldn't manage it, and-what do you think!--this young brother Hart, professed Baptist, actnally went through the streets carrying a banner, marked: THE SABBATH SCHOOL OF THE FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, OF EVANSDALE."

His " charge" was a little church in a neighboring village, forever in a quarrel; which, in steadily and violently fighting the thrifty churches around it, gave to the world, in that wise, its only sign ot vitality; and his real end and object in " tarry- ing over Sabbath with the Evansdale Church, was, in the hope ol getting, at no distant day, a permanent foothold therein.

I don't want my name under any circumstances mentioned, at least in a public way rit will only distract your people, and of course disturb my dear brother, your Pastor, in his position. That's one reason why I always dread to preach in a neighbor's pulpit. It is somehow apt to make parties, and always looks as though I did the thing apurpose. But God knows my heart! Three or four instances I could name," he continued, "where the Minister left in consequence of my visit, and there was a desire for me.

Elder Hartley had sown the seed, und the Iiarvest was sure. The effect upon the mind and heart of Deacon Rob- erts was disastrous.

"Yes," said Mr. Burden, "my wife was present and gave me quite an account of it. I wish her wisdom had been mine," he added; "and that I had refused the request oi good Deacon Roberts, that Elder Hartley should preach. My dear brother Hart, it is just such men as that well-meaning, zealous, ignorant Elder Hartley, who bring reproach upon the pulpit in general, and the Baptist pulpit in particular. Our noble denomination is charged with the blindness and bigotry of all the Hartleys throughout the land, and so' Christ is wounded in tkel wuse of Mhsfriends.' I am told, that lho pulled up all the church plants in the Lord's Garden except tlio Baptist and threw them over the denomina- tional fence into the common highway of Satan."

The Supper can only be spread in this house of God. Now, the conclusions which seem to' spring from this position are: 1st, that the man, born anew in Christ Jesus, and who has not been baptized--that is, inrmmersed -has not entered the visible church ; and 2nd, that it is, therefore, really an impossibility for him to eat the Lord's Supper, that Supper being spread only in the church. Ho does not eat ' unworthily,' as we sometimes say, but he does not cat tho Lord's Supper. Hio may sit at the tablo with-the faith ful, if you choose-this I grant, for argu- ment's sake only--but he lacks the qualification, baptism, ,which can make that feast the Lord's Supper to him. Ilo is not in the house, do you see? And as the Supper can only be spread it, theo house, of course ho is not at the Supper." T'Then," asked Mr. Htart, ' why forbid a man to do, ywhat we know he cannot do? And where the necessity of sending Pedo-baptists out of the seats appropriated to communicants on ordinance day? If they remain, the deluded beings will not and cannot partake of the Supper. Each will only eat a small piece of bread, and take a sip of wine-it is, by your reasoninglno Supper to him. No; although he himsell thinks it is 1 The church "6   "1Nx1E;rIVUE\W IN THE STUDY.   121 surely lnows the fact, which I think ought to satisfy the most jealous guardian of the Lord's table, that the sanctity of the feast has not been violated; for the man has not partaken of it, for the very good reason that he is legally incapacitated. So I would say, not that the unbaptized disciple of Christ shall not sit with us at the Lord's Supper; but I Would rather say he cannot, by virtuo of his condition. To illustrateo:-we hold, that immersion is baptism; yet we know that any man may be immersed, but only he who has repented of his sins and believes on the Lord to the salvation of his soul, can be baptized. Baptism is by immersion; but immersion is not necessarily baptism. A stick can be immersed, but it cannot be baptized. So simple immersion, even with the dictated form of words, cannot be baptism with that man who is not, by the work of the Ilely Spirit, a member 6f Christ. "In the celebration of the Lord's Supper, there is a form of words, and the use of bread and wine; and it cannot be celebrated without the same. But surely the words may be said by an ungodly man in the presence of a  company of ungodly men, and bread may be eaten and 'wine drank,l and  still the Lord's Supper be not administered.  The necessity of the Supper involves the condition of theparticipant, even as baptism does. In baptism, we require a condition of the heart, a spiritual "ndition; and without this, true baptism is an impossi- biliht. It was onthatgromund, thatyou baptizedbrother Van Anden, who, you know, had been   immersed by a Campbellito preacher, when he made no pretence to having been converted. Your reasoning was unanswer- able, saying that his immersion had taken place, at a time when his baptism was an impossibility. In other   122     THE INTERVIEWA IN THE STUDY. aords, brother Van Andlen has been twice immersed, but' only once baptized. So, we Baptists say, ' infants have' no right to baptism:' :might we not better say, that a babe, from the simple fact that it is incapable of the emotion of penitence for sin and the oexercise of faith in' Christ, cannot be baptized. i 'But as I was saying," continued Mr. Hart, "wo require only the evidence of a spiritual condition, as the pre- requisite for baptism. This is clearly Scripture, ' believe and be baptized.' This must be a personal experience-- no one can repent for him,and believe for him, any moro than he can be baptized for him. But for the other ordinance, we add a bodily condition as a necessity in all cases. The regenerated soul has a right to the ono ordinance. He can demand it! :No grace of man bestows it I -It is, ' by the grace of God.' This right springs solely from the fact, that he is 'a news man in Christ Jeszus.' By virtue of this relation, he celebrates the burial and resurrection of Christ by baptism and thereby openly declares his death to and burial from the world, and his resurrection by the Holy Ghost. But to the Lord's Supper--which, by the way, would seem to be indeed first in order of declaration ; tor the death of a necessity preceded the burial and resurrection, and both existed before even the church was formed-to this privilege of 'showing forth the Lord's death,' I say, a spiritual condition is not equal to the requirement of the church, but a bodily act must be performed. ': Now, Pastor, I know you will let mo set forth my own thoughts, as I know you will correct me as to any wrong conclusion which I may reach, and put me right in the mat- ter of any unintentional heresy which I may hold. I will give my views, in as simple and distinct a form as possible.    TIIE INTERVIEW IN THE STUDY.    123 "First.-I believe, that the work of regeneration makes a man, 'a new creature in Christ Jesus.' That through Christ, at the instant of his spiritual birth, a man really enters the church, the holy family of God, as I became a member of my father's family at the moment of my birth; sharing in the privileges and discharging the duties of the house according as I became equal to the same, and, at a proper time, receiving my name, which itself only declared by a household formality, a relation which I entered upon with my first breath. The family name and a share in the estate were mine by virtue of my birth. It is even so, in the spiritual family. "Second.-I believe, that every soul thus born in Christ is a component part of th church of Christ. "Third.--I rejoice in the faith, that in all branches of the church may be found a multitude of new-born souls disciples of Jesus Christ, and therefore-as you also hold-brothers and sisters by the holy birth. Yes, even im the Papal Church with all its errors, may ibe found, no doubt, some of the chosen ones. "'Fourt/.-I believe, that outside of all human forms of church organization, there may be discoverd' blood- washed souls, bought with the same blood, trusting in the same divine Saviour, and bound for a heaven at whose gates the earthly distinctions of the Saints will be laid aside with the garments of their mortality. As Bunyan says, 'they left their mortal garments in the stream.' "FVin .--That the man in Christ Jesus, beIause he is in Christ Jesus, has a divine right to the to Ordinances of the Lord's house; the one, proclaiming the death- the other, the burial and resurrection of Christ. i "Sit,.-- Thaf his right to each is equal--the result of- a   spiritual condition only. The right of the disciple to   124    .THE INTBVuW IN THE S'r'UY. the Lord's Supper, is the right of the eye to the light, or of the lungs to the air-nay, the right of a babe to its mother's breast; a birthright. Naming the child does not impart the privilege of receiving sustenance-it is a necessity ofthe household, and simply serves to designate the child among other children of the same family. The supper is not, therefore, a ' Baptist table,' or a ' Pedo- baptist table,' it is the Lord's table. These truths I have set forth in a paper, which I have written. The disciple being in Christ, his right is identical and one with Christ. The Lord's table is therefore his table, for he is8 the lord's. Instituted before the church teas erected, its privilege is prior to all church relation. "Seventh.-I believe, that the visible church, whose oneness in Christ is in the Cross, (and that unity typified and symbolized in the Supper) is of necessity separated into various doctrinal divisions, and that these divisions are consistent with the spiritual unity, and the greatest prosperity of the people of God. Like an army: regiments from different states, and bearing different banners, but all under the national colors-marching under one great leader to one common battle, and one common victory. And- moreover, I believe, that while the different regiments and com- panies have their own chosen places where the camp table is spread; still, as the food is supplied by the Government, for whose honor they 'fight, that if a hungering soldier from one' regiment should sit down rwth soldiers of another regiment, it is the exercise of his abstract right as a soldier, and that he should not be driven from the table, or drummed out of his own regi- ment to the tune of the 'rogue's march,' because he had messed in a neighboring camp.. The Governmentthat   THE ISTERVIW IN THE S".-UY,   125 gave him his musket, gave him his meal. And let me' add to my military illustration these two thoughts: first, that if a man proved his love to his country by fighting for its liberty, who, like that old man Burns, at Gettysburg, had never been .mustered into any regiment, that such a soldier would have a soldier's right to a soldier's rations, wherever they might be found; second, that an army, in order to meet and overcome a mighty foe, must not be contending within itself about epaulets and banners; nor content itself in gaining victories over battalions rallied under the same national colors, unless it would suffer a miserable defeat at the hands of the common ' foe. 1"You know, Elder," said Mr. Hart, "I am from the ' Old Bay State,' and I always felt a generous swelling of my Yankee-boy heart, when I heard read the declara- tion, 'God bless the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.'* So I feel ithe healthy exultation of a disciple when I say, God bless the Commonwealth of the church of Christ. I said as much to Miss Roberts. Now I have read to you my thoughts, in a kind of sermon order. I have no idea of going forth to battle for my creed; I will never waste my ammunition on some pugnacious fellow soldier. I will brotter any man who is doing any- thing-anywhere, anyhow, for God and humnan'ty. I may have my own views of doctrine: I must. But I hlave no heart for this perpetual contention for creeds, and these victories in the camp, while a desperate, mighty enegmy :is gaining strength and territory, every hour. 1 do believe, Elder, Chat a better day is dawning. "The grand army is getting into marching order. Yes, fighting order. I thought, while Elder Hartley was firing at every soldier of the cross that Ihe couldfind outside at            couldfind outside   126    THE INT^IWltElkW IN THE STUDY. the Baptist camp, what must be his idea of the sense of the hymn, sung just before his sermon, commencing: ' Am I a soldier of the cross; A follower of the Lamb-' and especially that verse, 'Sure I must fight if I would reign; Increase my courage, Lord-' I suppose he thinks that is our own especial denom- inational battle-cry, and a melodious" prayer for success in shooting the Pedo-baptists. ' The choir must have rather tried him in the hymn of their own selection, at the close of his tirade, beginning:  From whence doth this union arise, That hatred is conquered by love.' "Yes Elder, let doctrines have their place, but let it be as it was on the battle-fields in the late war. In binding up the wounds of a soldier, I did not ask him first from what State or County he hailed-he was a wounded soldier! In working with others, I did not refuse my service because we differed in religious creeds and doctrinal views. It was the brotherhood of labor- the brotherhood of love. We worked on the same field; we ate and drank at the same table. It was the holy fel- lowship of sympathy for poor suffering humanity Nay; the indian from the western wilderness, and the negro from the plantation, had the same care at my hands as the white man from my own native county in Massachu-' setts. Each -was a wounded soldier. Still more, the wounded man in the rebel gray clothes was no longer an enemy, and had an equal claim-for aid in his suffering, as the man in- blue. It was the duty of true loyalty to wound, and-the exercise of humanity to heal. Now I   THE INTERVIlt V IN THE STUDY.   127 suppose my very talk renders me liable to discipline, but it is your own frankness and love which has emboldened me to just unburden my heart. The truth is, my dear Pastor, when I entered the church, I had little thought about creeds. I knew that baptism was an ordinance of the church, and that those who joined the church should bo baptized. I saw the beautiful significance of that ordinance, as you described it at the last baptismal occasion. I had no thought of doctrine. I knew I had found Christ, and I loved every one who loved Jesus with the simplicity and ardor of a brother. ]My former Pastor used to preach a great deal on Baptist doctrine. He was very rigid: as strong almost as Elder Hartley, without- is vulgarity. He always contended that-ours was the only true church. That for a member of our church to partake of the Lord's Supper in a church of another faith was a matter of discipline, and. without repentence for and acknowledgment of sin, a just cause of exclusion. And, with us, he would not allow a man from a Pedo-baptist Church, no matter how pure his character or how bright his faith, to sit at the Lord's table. I confess, I used often to wonder how it was, that the Lord who saw ' the end from the beginning' should have so fenced in an ordinance, which was at once a memorial of His death and a source of spiritual vitality to every disciple; knowing as He did, that, in the ages to come and for centuries in the history of the church, nine-tenths of his blood-washed disciples would have no right to partake. That, indeed, they would be' guilty of eating and drinking condemnation,' by not obeying the divine command resting on every believer, ' Do this in remembrance of me-eating and drinking condemnation to their otwn souls, not discerning the Lord's body at the table.   128    -THE INTERVIEW IN THE STUDY.  By Scriptural searching, I found that in the qualifica- tions required by the Apostle, he looked only -on the heart. That the mai must "examine himse7f," and search for those inward witnessings of the spirit, which should enable him to see the significance and apply the benefits of the Lord's death, which the church was to show forth until the second coming pf Christ. "Now t have got, where it seems to me I can no longer endure, ':a yoke, wthilih neither we nor ourfa7thers could bear.'  The scene last communion Sabbath, my dear Pastor, in sending out of the house that venerable man of God: Deacon Saybrook-I know that in the view of the church, he had no legal. right-but I thought, 'let every man examine himself.' My own father and 'mother, thought I, if they were here to-day, each with a Chris- tian experience of over half a century, would have been required to go forth with the company of disqualified saints and hopeless sinners, from the table of the Lord. "Understand, Elder, I do not in the least blame you. It was a legitimate rendering and enforcement of Baptist doctrine. Anequal duty rests upon every Baptist Pas- tor, under like circumstances, throughout the, land. And if he fails to perform it, he is recreant to his obligations as an executive officer of the church. But how is it to- day? In almost every Baptist Church on ordinance day, there may be found at the table some unbaptized believer. Do they turn him away? I know of churches, where, if such a scens as occurred in our church had taken place, by the Pastor's. faithfully maintaining the law, almost the entire church would have risen up to protest against the act. Now if it is the Lord's law, that a disciple, who has not been baptized, shall under no circumstances sit at the table, then what right has that church., or its atteIbnwa   -TME IXTERVIJUW IN TEE SfTUY.  - 129 iPastor to modify or utterly overlook the divine enact- m-ent? "I am told that we are soon to have a brotherput upon his trial before the church for disorderly conduct; and that is .our young .brother Wxard, who left with his Methodist bride that ordinance ;Sabbath, Is that so?' "' The Comnmittee is appointed,; said the Pastor. "And then," said Mr. Hart, "there is the brother. who, last sliummer, when visiting his old home in the country, cormmuned one Sabbath-or thought lhedid--in the Presbyterian Church, sitting in the same seat with his father." "Have to be churched!" :said the Pastor. "t is law :. and while I am Pastor of the church, I have no aiterna- five but to enforce the law." ( Then again," said brother Hart, I am' told that the World's Christian Alliance is a going to hold its session in a few months, in New York. You know, there:are to be Christian brethren -fromall parts of-the'world. Sup- pose I our great Baptist preacher,' as we say--suppose he should come over the seas-as God grant he may- you know he is open communion I HUis house has -the open door./  "Now what would we do, if Spurgeon should be ia our church, on some ordmancoe day? And further, suppose that he should not take the hint and go out, when only' 'members in good and regular standing in the sister churches of the same faith and order"' are invited to partake: 1 say, suppose he should stay at the table like old Dqacon Saybrook, what would we do I True, he has been baptized, but so have many in the Methodist and other. churches.  He is not of tho 'same faith and order.'" 6   130    THE INTEVlYEW nI THE ST'UY.  "He would have to'leave," said the Pastor, " if I stood at the head of the table. The regular Baptist Church, which lets Spurgeon take his place at the table spread in their midst, violates its own law and gives the lie to the prohibition involved in its regular invitation. Who is Spurgeon, any more than any other man, that ho shall have a license to break the law of the Lord's house! Law is law!" 'It would be a sceneo!" said Mr. Hart. "' Spurgeon! ' our own great Baptist Minister,' driven from the Lord's table in our church. I think t/iat would try the mettle of Deacon Roberts himself.'" "You are much mistaken," said the Pastor, "it would be just what the good Deacon-would like. The more noted the offender, the more glorious tho laws display in his punishment. It would bo an opportunity to show the sovereign authority of the church, which the zealous Deacon would much enjoy." ,' CWell," said brother Hart, " you will no doubt attend that grand convention of the messengers of the churches, in New York " ' Oh, yes.;" said the Pastor. "I am looking forward to it with the liveliest interest. It will be a foretaste of heaven, it-seems to me, that gathering together of the saints of God from all parts of the Christian world. As much as I rejoice in the thought of an entrance into the world on high," he added, "it seems to me, I should almost regret my departuro for the skies without wit- nessing such a prophecy and type of the mille-nnal1 day, as that will be." "So I feel," said Mr. Hart, " and I cannot- help but anticipate the close of the session of that noble assem- bly; it no doubt will boe a solemn scene.

"There would be a beautiful propriety in doing so,', said Elder Burden; " there can hardly be a doubt, but they will do so. You smile," said the Pastor looking at brother Hart---" what is the matter?" "Oh ;" he replied, "I had a vision, which forced itself upon my mind, at once painful and ludicrous. I saw brethren of the Baptist faith present in great numbers on ' that last great day of the feast.' I saw them weep- ing, and heard' them singing and praying in one common multitude of disciples."' "In all their speeches, the Baptists had called all men brethren; had spoken of the meeting, and the banquet in heaven. -And then I saw thom  fleeing from the House of God with all possible haste, for the announcement was made that the Lord's Suvpper twas about to be celebrated: themselves baptized believers, having rendered perfect obedience to the law of the Lord's house, yet running in every direction from the holy Supper. I thought I looked back at the table just as I reached the door, and 'of all the preachers and lay- men of Baptist faith, there sat 'our great Baptist preacher' Spurgeon, at the table, alone P1 "What can we do?" :said the Pastor. "It is not the multitude of the saints,!or the peculiar character of the company that can justify a violation of law. The statutes of the Lord do not, change character with different lo- calities. As Deacon Roberts says, with so much of emphasis,' law is law!' "What would you do with me, if I ventured to stay at that table o" said Mr. Hart.   132    THE INTERVIEW IN THE STUDY. "Precisely the same as I would do, if you were found at the table in the Presbyterian or the Methodist Church, in our village.; I would have. you brought before the church for trial, and if you did not recant your heresy and pledge yourself to a life of obedience to the known rules of the.*Baptist Church, you would be expelled.' , As Pastor of the- Baptist Church, I have no relatives, no friends, no enemies. As a good Moderator of a busi- ness meeting knows no law but that of parliamentary usage, and is without friend or foe; so stands the M[inister in a Baptist Church.- While I so stand, I will enforce the law at all hazards. If the law is wrong, abolish it: if right enforce it. If you feel it to be wrong --if it is too much for your heart, and that too without a clear distinct ' thus saith the Lord! --if you are too weak to drive your own Christ-loving wife from the Lord's table and send such an one as old silver-haired Deacon Saybrook out of the house of God, and from the table of the Lord-I say, if you were a preacher and this was the weakness of your nature and your lack of grace, you would have but one alternative, and, that would be to resign. - ' I have been very much interested in your statements as .to doctrinal position," continued Mr. Burden; "I like your frankness. I was greatly pleased with your spirit, during that painful scene at the house of Deacon Roberts. But you ask for advice; you know that you are this moment liable to the discipline of the church, for the views you have to-day expressed are clearly heretical. -You, my dear brother, are well -aware that they are contrary to the received and well-known usages of the Baptist Church." t   THEn lTEuhvjw  IN THE TSVujY. A133 "Then," said brother Halt, "I suppose I can take a letter to a church of some other denomination?" "No; by no means," said the Pastor. "We do not, as you know, fellowship other branches of the church of Christ. Indeed it is the clear necessity of our faith, -that we deny that they are indeed churches. If they aro churches, how can we say that they cannot adnminister the Supper. If they can administer it, then they surely have a -ight to sit at the table, and if they have a right to the table in one place they have a right. wherever it is 'spread.  You see my dear brother, you cannot take a single step without yielding the whole ques- tion. No; by giving you a letter, we give them all the argument." "But," said -Mr. Haart, "did you not give the usual letter of dismission and recommendation to brother and sister Edwards, to unite with Spurgeon's church-?" "Yes," said the  Pastor, " and by so doing the church yielded, unconsciously, the whole point, and made herself liable to expulsion from the Association. Again, my  brother, can you join a church declaring that sprinkling and pouring are baptism ," "Butwhat shall I do?" asked the perplexed brother. 'Stay for the present where you are," said the Pastor. "In no wise advance your peculiar views-work right on in the Sabbath School and elsewhere, and biede your time.'9 "But what do you mean," said brother Hart, "by hiding my time?'             . "Oh," said the Pastor, " that is an old-fashioned way of talking, and always a great term with my father. He was a  wonderful man to bide his time. Now at the con- clusion of our interview, I must recall to your mind a   134    THE INTERVIEW IN THE STUDY. question of mine as to the effect of Elder Hartley's sermon upon the congregation, as far as you were able to judge from what you saw." Mr. Hart replied, "Deacon Roberts, and his man Deacon Winston, seemed tot enjoy it greatly. Again and again, they exchanged notes, by looks and nods of approbation, and in frequent whisperings. Coming out of the church, I heard Deacon Roberts remark to some one at the door, ' that's what I call a sound, old-fash, ioned Baptist sermon.'? For myself, I felt ashamed. There were a good many members of other churches present, and in my soul I was humbled for the honor of the Baptist Church. 1 do not think the mass of our people endorsed the sermon. I am confident, that your discourse in the evening on ' Christian brotherhood' drew the sting out of tho morning sermon, and left the honey of the Gospel with the church."' So saying, brother Hart departed from the Study.   CRAPTER XI. THE WEDDING. Q ARRIED-on the 10th of September, 186-by &,1t the REV. W. BURDEN, Pastor of the Baptist Church, at the -house of the bride's father, ALMOND 0. ROBERTS, Esquire, MR..EDWARD A. HAnT, Attorney and Counsellor at law, and MSs ET,rN M. ROBERTS, all of this village. Such was the notice, which appeared in the- Evans- dale Saturday-Evening Visitor. It was the event of the village, and for many days, the one all-absorbing- topic of conversation in all social circles, and the subject of every variety of comment. The large -comnmittee, com- posed of both sexes and all ages, which may be found in every country village, rendered the generous verdict, that, " take it all in all, it is a good match. M[r. Hart-is a young lawyer of great promise, and Ellen Hart is an intelligent, warm-hearted, matter-of-fact girl, who can mlake bread or play upon the piano, as the case may require," However, as is always the case, on such --occasions, there was a minority report rendered by a select com- mittee, composed largely of the involuntary supporters of single blessedness.  In this report, it was declared, that "Ed Hart had not displayed his usual good sense in taking Ellen Rob- erts for a wife, and, that Miss Roberts will learn, it is to be feared, that she has made a mistake in giving hler hand to Ed Hart, if he is a lawyer."'  135   136        THE WEDDING. The Bachelor's Club, ot which Mr. Hart had been an active member for about two years, held a meeting just before the wedding, and in anticipation of the event, passed a series of resolutions expressive of the sense of the society. At that meeting, it was determined to send a letter of condolence to an association in the village, known as The Old Maid's AUiance; said letter to close with the historic and glorious sentence: "The old guard dies : the old guard never surrenders!" It -was further resolved; -that the .likeness of the late lamented brother which, adorned the walls of the club room, should be encircled with evergreens, as an ex- pression of the regard of the club, and furthermore, that the club should attend the wedding -of brother Hart, in:e abody. It was. moreover, lnmalmonusly voted that thl Secretary be directed to make a suitable minute upon the 'books of the Association, in memory ot the lamentable event;, which had so suddenly removed a valuable member ot the club. The record read as follows:-"Departed this life on the 10th of September, '186--our lametnted brother Edward A. Hart, aged 27 years,'6 months, and 4 days. Carried olfF by the prevail- ing epidemic. There is no need to describe tho wedding. All ved- dings are' much alike; and still each is quite different from every one that ever went before it, or will ever come afterit-.the Eden of .matrimony, with its roses and its thorns; its joys and its sorrows. The Bacdelor's Club was present in full force; and, after the marriage ceremony was performed, they went in solemn procession to present their congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Hart. E-3ach brother first paused to kiss tho blushitig lbrido; and then, solemnly turning   I    .-    .   THE WEDoDrI   .     137 to. the proud bridegroom, exclaimed, ' A-lass, my brother!"  One thing happened, however, which was so strangely sensible that it properly claims- a place in this faithful chronicle. The .' happy pair," instead of malking a precipitate retreat from the village immediately after the marriage, by the fastest train, and never stopping until they had travelled 1" from the rivers to the- ends of the earth," at the close of the evening entertainment went but a few streets away to their own furnished home, and began the common sense life of "keeping house."  The Baptist Church, the next Sabbath morning, was crowded with all the young people of the village at an early hour, to hear the Gospel, and see. dr. and Mrs. Hart, The Pastor '6 improved " the occasion by preaching a sermon upon the true relation of married life. The discourse was a plain and most appropriate set- ting forth of the duties devolving upon husband and wife, closing with a fervent exhortation to all present to so live, that -when life's journey is ended, they might enter into the bright land beyond the-river, where I't we are neither married nor are given in marriafge but are angels." When, in the sermon, the preacher quoted Pauls say- ing, be not unequally yoked with unbelievers,' -eacon Roberts cast a glance of satisfaction at the new married, couple, and then looked up again at the preacher with an indescribable look of mingled mirth and solemnity which said plainly, a hard sentence for a minister with a Pres- byterian wife, and a Deacon with a Methodist wife. When the ViMnister gave the-, apostolic injunction   138        THE .WEDDING. which, quite unlike the first read, had positive reference to th0 marriage relation, viz :-"If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. IIow knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?"--there was a very solemn nod of the Deacon's head, as he whispered to himself, "-there you have it!' There was at once resignation and hope in the scriptural declaration. He saw, that with the apostolic sanction coupled with a good supply of honest, every-day love, there was more than a possibility for the Deacon of a Baptist Church to live peaceably with a Methodist wife. Yet, if the good man had been asked to carry the doctrine to the point of its application to the Pastor's matrimonial relation, his faith would have failed him. First of all, he would have argued that while Papal celibacy was not justified by Scripture; still, with Paul, it could be said that it was better for a Minister not to marry. An unmarried tinistor could give more time to the church : and still more important, he could be pro- cured for a less price, and all the extra money now laid out on a Pastor's family could go to the sacred cause of home and foreign missions. He indeed proposed, when the pulpit was vacant and the 'church was "looking about " for a man to " go in and out," before the Baptists of Evansdale, and "( break the bread of life " to every regular Baptist in the village, that a notice should be inserted in the Visitor after this manner:--WANTED, a Pastor for the Baptist Church of Evansdale, who is unmarried,- and whose zeal in iisn Master's cause will make him to labor in the Gospelfield for a- small salary. This was voted down in the regular business meeting of    TrE WEDDIN.       139 the church, but the debate which took place would make a curious chapter in this book. Deacon Winston made a violent speech in favor of the publication of such a notice, saying that it was a sad and every-day sight to see a Minister's family really robbing the Lord's treasury. Ho declared, that he had no doubt that there were men this day groping in the darkness of heathenism, whoi would be standing in the true light and knowledge, if it were not a- lamentable fact that money was appropriated all over the land to the support of Ministers- wives and children-money, which otherwise would have gone to the help of our missionaries in foreign lands. - When the matter came to a vote, with three exceptions, all the married people voted against the resolution, and so did three or four hopeless old maids, and two bachelors, who had long since passed into " the sere and yellow leaf" but, all the unmarried people voted for it. A  brother Sanborn proposed the following substitute: -Wanted, a live man of God to preach the Gospel in the ]Baptist Church in the Village of Evansdale. The laborer is ivorthy of his hire. Voted down by a strong vote. The notice finally took this shape; and, after three months' weekly publication, was answered by the accept- ance of a  call by the present Pastor :- Wanted, a   good Minister of the Gospel-of small family, or unmarried-to-assume the pastoral  ofice in the .Baptist Church of Evansdale. A   sharp contention sprang up; a lively debate, in whichmany took part'; the question being as to what con- stituted a " small family." No- positive conclusion was reached however, other than that it was a relative term of somewhat doubtful character.   "O,       THE WEDDING. -But, as I was saying,- Deacon Roberts was clear on this point--droppng the policy of m inisterial marriage -that a preacher of the Gospel had no right to take as a companion a person of another religious faith. For he reasoned that the wife, equally with the husband, was the property of the church during the pastoral relation. He-elaimed, moreover, that he had plain Scripture for this, and with an air of triumph, quoted, ' ye are not your own"--ever adding, " there you have it!" At the close of the service that morning, as Deacon Roberts met the preacher, he remarked, " enjoyed the sermon amazingly. Very timely, Elderl Very timely! Hope not only my son-in-law and my daughter, but all the married people in the house this day will profit by it. Must confess though, Pastor," he added, " if it had not been Lord's day, and in the meeting-house at that, I should have laughed a little when you came to the quotations about matriage. All right! Truth is truth! Oh,-Pastos; you should have heard Elder Hartley on that passage-' unequally yoked with unbelievers.' You know- argument is his forte, and that he is tremendous in handlin' the Scripter. I couldn't but tChin of our two - wives, while he was preaching, much as a man under a shelter would think of people who were out in the storm."  a But," asked, the Pastor, "'to use your own figure, Deacon, did you not get somewhat of the storm yourself, considering your relation to that good Methodist woman in your house?" "Well, Elder," replied the Deacon with evident embarrassment, &though I didn't get the heft of the shower, bein' right in -doctrine you know, still I own up that the rain did leak through a little that day, and that   THE WEDDING        141 I was somewhat touched. Well," le continued, looking at the new married couple as they passed down the aisle, "they are well yoked, and, if I do say it, they are a likely team. And yet do you know, Elder, (this is no time or place to talk about it,) but I am a little disturbed in my mind touchin' the actual, doctrinal position of brother Hart. I knew nothing positive in the matter: if I had, I would have made them put off the weddingl until the question was settled." "Do you think he is right?" asked the Deacon of :the Pastor. X "When brothler Hartley was here, I told him as much as that I was afraid that brother Hart was getting tainted like with these " liberal' sentiments, that's goin' around and disturbin' the peace of our Baptist Zion," "I am not fully prepared to answer you at this time," said the Pastor. ' I can only now say, that brother Hart and sister Hart must be judged by the law and usage of our church." "There you have it!" replied the Deacon. "Truth is truth! As a Deacon of the church, I have no daughter. You know, Elder, that we officers are watchmen upon the Walls of the spiritual Jerusalem, and guardians of tho sacred g ates. Yes, and more than this; we must sit in judgment to punish the offenders, and by no means clear the guilty., There you have it!' g   - ' ?r    CHRAPTER XII. ZR.

The first Sabbath morning after their arrival, they resolved that they would vary their religious habit, by going, for once, to a Pedo-baptist Church. So Mr. Hart took the paper and looked over the long list of services in various churches, and finally decided to go to a church, which never is found under the head of " religious notices.' There was no difficulty in mak- ing the way to their chosen place of worship ; for, having crossed over the ferry to the "City of Churches," they just went with the crowd until they came to a large, plain, brick building, into whose every door the people were pouring that morning. Through the courtesy of a man with a rose in the buttonhole of his coat, they were conducted to a conve- nient seat in the gallery. t What a sight!" exclaimed Ellen, as she looked below and around upon the multitude assembled. Every seat occupied, and the aisles crowded-people sitting upon "2   THE SUV1'EE IN A CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. 143 the pulpit steps and standing in the door-ways and passage-ways of the house, close as grain in a fruitful field, while the great bouquets of fresh-plucked blossoms upon the preacher's desk, breathed over the vast assem- bly the fragrance of a flower garden, the breath of God. "It must be some special service," she whispered to Mr. Hart, " and from the blossoms in the pulpit, I think there is to be a wedding." "No;" replied her husband, " it is always so. For a quarter of a century, every Sabbath morning and even- ing, winter and summer, rain and sunshine, the same sight, the flowers upon the pulpit; and the same preacher before that little desk, with three thousand people gather- ed to hear him, and only three thousand, because of the limits of the audience room." ' Why then don't they build him a larger house?" she asked; " although, there are here nearly or quite double the entire population of our village." "No doubt," said Mr. Hart, " the church would do so, if they knew that the life of the minister would be length- ened out. For, if he should die, there is no man of all the noble preachers of the land, who could, in every respect, fill his place in that pulpit." The service commenced with the music of the great organ, and singing, by the choir, of a familiar hymn to an old tune, in which the people joined. The supplica- tion and the sermon succeeded. It was an eloquent discourse. which held the multitude spell-bound for over an hour. The subject that morning was gospel liberty, founded upon the text in the Gospel of John:-- "Ye shali know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.' At the close of the sermon, the Lord's Supper was administered. The invitation was-to all whlo loved ithe   1A4 THE SUPPERI IN A CONGRlEGATIONAL CHURCH. Lord Jesus Christ and zoho believed that His blood had Cleansed their hearts from sin. While the communicants we're taking their places at the table, a solemn consultation occurred between the two Baptists from Evansdale. lr.; Hart whispered to his wife, "does that mean us, dears " "Ed, we do love Jesus," she replied. "Itis the old question, Ellen," said the husband. "If this is a church of Christ, it has , the power to spread the Gospel feast, and therefore this table before us is the Lord's table; and we, being the Lord's disciples, and having rendered obedience to the Lord's law, have a right to take our seats, and eat and drink at the memorial banquet, whenever and wherever it is spread." "What will we do," asked the wife, while visions of Evansdale Baptist Church and her stern father, Deacon Roberts, rose before her eyes. "It is clearly against the law and usage of our churclh" "True;" replied the husband, " but as Peter said to those who would forbid his speaking for Christ:- 'whether we shall obey God rather than man, judge ye.'" "But many here, the majority of this people, have never been baptized as we understand the ordinance," said the hesitating wife, " and have we a right to sit with them at the Lord's table?" ',Does their disobedience annul our right?" asked the husband. "Is not the Master's command upon us, -' Do this in remembrance of me?' May zowe not be justly counted among the disobedient, by going away, while the authoritative voice of the blessed Saviour calls to us from the table, ' Do this in remembrance of me 'l' If it is not the Lord's Supper, we violate no law by remaining, for then the whole matter is red iced to tho simple act of eating a small piece of bread, and tasting 7   wine from a cup; and the last resolves itself into a tern perance question, which does not belong to this discus- sion. On the other hand, as I said before, if it is the Lord's Supper, what man, or what law of man's enact- ment, is to forbid our exercise of a privilege, extended ro you and me by the Lord of the feast? , is God that justfieth! Who is he that condemneth?It is CAritt that died! Tell me, that I shall not enjoy the light of day, because some man with impaired vision cannot behold the sun! Tell me that with my healthy lungs I shall not breathe the common air, because some poor consumptive has to cover his mouth with a screen!  Forbid my eating and drinking when   hungry  and thirsty, because some man at my side    is unworthy! but, let no man, or assembly of men, dare to stand between my hungering and thirsting soul and a feast .spread by my Saviour Himself. Surely, Ellen, the effrontery and tyranny  of Papacy itself, never attempted  a greater violence than that upon the conscience of men! ' The Spirit and the Bride say, come! and let him that heareth, say, come! and let him that is athirst, come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water- of life freely.' This feast of the Lord, Ellen, is Christ's own publication of that fountain of living waters. Hlavinrr drank of the water, may we not taste of the wine? ' The Spirit and the Bride '-the Church--' say, come!' The Baptist Church of Evansdale says, stay away I ' This do in remembrance of me,' says the Law Giver of Israel. You do it at your peril, says the Baptist Church of Evansdale.' "We shall be turned out of the church," said the wife. "Not out of the churc7t, my dear," replied the husband.. ', Tho one hundred and  cight members of   Evansdale Baptist Church cannot do that. Our Lord and Saviour will not turn us out of His house, for obeying His invitation and eating at His table: we are really turning into the church. TEllen, -we must now go to the table or leave the house; which is it, my dear? The Bible, or the Baptists? Evansdale, or the Evangelist " No more was said but silently the two disciples joined the company, and- sat together that day in the " heavenly places in Christ Jesus; eating and drinking condem- nation to their own souls," as Elder Hartley would say. Now, while they are at the feast, you and I, reader, will have a little talk of our own. The representatives of almost all, if not all the evan- gelical churches, are in that great company of commun- icants; and here and there, no doubt, some humble, trusting, Christ-loving soul, may be found, who never has openly joined any branch of the visible church, but yet is a member of that church " named in heaven and on earth."' Perhaps timid and shrinking, nay, it may be misunderstanding the duty of every disciple to unite l with the people of God, and thereby to give the world and the church the benefit of an open testimony of a follower of Jesus. I sly, I can imagine some :such per- v son ai that table. Again there is one, conscious of the great test truth-full love to Jesus-who can give no date ot his conversion. Indeed, he is ignorant of any experience, such as he has heard related .by men stand- ing before the church. Influences, to himself perhaps unknown, have been gently working for months and years in his heart and life. Possibly, some long forgotten incident in the life and tender teaching of agodly mother: the fact forgotten, the outward circum- stances vanished, but the spiritual power silently and ,  .     ,   t.   steadily at work accomplishing God's purposes of grace and mercy upon the soul. And now, at the table, lie may not be in the clear, distinct light of broad day; it is rather grey dawn with him. The great headlands and hills of truth are but half seen, and look, no doubt, quite different from the sharp outline and distinct shape, which they will assume, when the sun, now published only by faint streaks in the East, shall have risen high up in a cloudless sky.* He does not fully understand Christ as his Saviour; but he is stirred with a longing for that which the world with its wisdom  and its philosophy cannot bestow. The prophet calls the Messiah, "The de- sire of all nations. The nee / thegreat wecessity! This man feels this. Why is he at the Supper? Simply because, by this new gravitation of his soul, he is irre- sistibly drawn to the place, where Christ as the Saviour is manifest.  He ought to be at the table.. Ignorant? Yes, ignorant! He   knows enough,. however, for the present necessity: he knows he is ignorant, and that is a great attainment. lIe cannot set forth and explain thoe " philosophy of salvation."' nor has he any clear idea of how the sacrifice on Calvary met the demands of tAhe law.  Then, says some one, he ought not to eat, for he does wt 'discern the Zord's body at the table.' In one sense, hle does not; and I somewhat question, dear reader, whether you yourself do fully -understand the hoiy mystery of that table. But this h e knows, that that table with its broken bread and poured wine tells the story of the cross, how Christ died for sinners ac- cording to the Scriptures." It is to him a soul-banquet, * "I do not remember any precise time when I passed through any 'pecial change of purpose or heart, but there is going on in me a process of crystal. ization.---BAEAx tLicoOx.  "8 CTHE SUPPEJ IN A CONGREGATIONALI CHUlitCH. and in- a way quite beyond his understanding, it meets and satisfies the inward hungering and thirsting of his spirit. But is it policy to allow a person not a member of the church to go to the Lord's table? you ask. Well, a great deal can be said on that. There may be a necessity for the power opposing, to show by what authority they may either .allowt, or dis-allow, in the matter of any soul's approach to the Lord's table. I am free to say, that it should be the teaching of all pulpits, that thefirst act of a man conscious of the work of grace upon his soul, should be to join some branch of the church of Christ, whose declarations of doctrine are nearest to his under- standing of revealed truth; and where he can do most for the Lord who bought- him. He has advantages of labor in the church, which he cannot have -out of it. He d at once imparts and receives strength, by the concert of action consequent upon church organization. There is protection too, in its watchful- care, and strength in its fellowship. A man may be a Christian, outside of the church: he may not be a Christian, in the church. I find a violet on the common highway, quite beyond the garden walls. It is a violet, and must be a violet any- where. It could be no more than a violet, in the garden. Then, why should it be in the garden? where is the necessity? The garden is the best place for it : it may be trodden under foot where it is. There will be times, too, when it will need the especial care of the gardener, whch it cannot have by the roadside. But it is a violet on the highway, nevertheless. So, on the other hand, there may be a weed in the garden; and the fact that it is in a place appropriated to blossoms, and known as a flower garden, makes it none the less a weed. Indeed,   THE SUPPER IN A iCONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. i49 by contrast with all the floral wealth of the garden in which it stands, it looks worse than it would outside the gate in the common fellowship of kindred weeds. Being in the garden does not make a weed to be a violet : being out of the garden, does not make a violet to-be a weed. More than this, it would be a very poor argument for the roadside violet to make, that because there is a weed in the garden where it ought not to be, it will not let the gardener transplant it from the wayside where the weed ought to be, to the garden, where the weed ought not to be; and which is its own home, because it is a violet and not a weed. Gardens, dear reader, are a necessity for the growth Df blossoms ; and churches are a necessity for the growth i md perfection of Christians.           - But let us see if the violet has not a little wholesome $ theology, touching the question of outsiders-as an exception, if you choose-in the matter of partaking with church members at the Gospel feast. If you had a garden flower growing just without the gate, and the - gardener was watering the plants within the enclosure,  i would you not tell him to give a drink to the beautiful 'proselyte of the gate??" Now, suppose he should efuse, which he would have no right to do if you owned he garden, and not the garden only but the roadside oo: for it is well for him to remember that he -is the "red servant and not the lord of the garden-but, as I aid, let us suppose him to say, "not so, my lord! For have always been taught to believe, that plants outside annot be garden flowers, but weeds.' Now, methinks the ,rd would answer the presumptuous gardener saving, the violet is its own proof of my planting; and whatthy I rdl hath called a violet, that call not thou a weed. The ? .l   150 THE SUPPER IN A CONGREGATIONAL CHURCII. blossom, inside or outside, in the time of its thirst is within the wide compass of my proclamation, made to flowers wherever found :--' Drink ye all of it.' Water it now, for it is a blossom ; and, at some early day, take it up and give it the advantage of a place in the garden, for it is indeed a garden flower." Thai would be tho Gospel according to violets, and I think it would be the Gospel according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. What say you reader . I am inclined to think, that Christ has a great out- side Church; and, to return to our figure just used, I believe that the servants might pick a large bouquet of veritable blossoms, quite beyond the regularly built garden walls. It has always been so: man has ever fallen short of the true figures, in taking the census of the spiritual-Jerusalem. Hear Paul, in his letter to the Romans: "Wot ye not -what the Scripture saith of Elias? How he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed thy Prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the ];nee to the image of Baal." Let us read a few verses from the book of Numbers: "+ And the Lord camo down in a cloud and spake unto him (Moses) and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy Elders: and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied and did not cease. But there remained two of the men --in the camp; the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad : and the spirit rested upon them, and they were of them that were written but went   THE SUPPER IN A CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. 151 not out into the tabernacle : and they prophesied in the camp. And there ran a young man and told Moses and said, Eldad and Medadj do prophesy in the camp. And Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, my lord, Moses forbid them. And Moses said unto him, enviest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lord's people were pro- phets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them." And then you remember, that the disciples once found some members of the outside church, and that they positively forbade them to work wonders in the name of their Lord. Nay, more: they were so proud of this act of misguided zeal, that they hastened to tell the Lord of it. Let us read it as found in Mark's Gospel:-' And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw .one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us; and we forbade him, because he followeth not us. But Jesus said, forbid him not; for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me.. For he that is not against us-is on our part." As good Deacon Roberts would say, " there you have it." The blindness and bigotry of a disciple-and the loving John, at that--who would not let a man dispossess some poor being of a devil, because in his estimate he was not in the regular church, stand in strange contrast with the light and liberty of Christ, giving holy fellowship to all men everywhere who act in His name. r- I have heard a good story somewhere, of an old woman, who was present one evening in a Baptist Church, as a candidate for membership was giving in his experi- ence before the church.. It seems, the Pastor thought it necessary to ask the man a great many theological     152 THE SUPPER IN A CONGRE GATIONAL CHURCH. questions, by which he at once showed his own knowl- edge of the doctrines of the church, and also tested the wisdom of the candidate. It is quite likely, that beyond all this he availed himself of the occasion to discover to any church neighbor, or any man of the world happening to be present, the great and sure foundations of the church ^  At the close of his examination of the candidate, he gave the usual privilege to any member of the church to ask such questions as he or she might think proper. There was a long pause for the catechising by the Minister had been so exhaustive that there seemed to be nothing more to say. But after a time of awkward silence, the old woman, who was ignorant in the wisdom of the world and the knowledge of the schools, but wise in heavenly things, ventured to remark, looking at the Pastor, " if I might say a word, I would really just like to ask the young man one question." "Speak, on, mother ;' said the Pastor. "All the questions asked by the Pastor," she continued, "were good and learned, and no doubt needed to be asked, though such a poor, ignorant woman as I am, couldn't understand them all. But "-turning toward the candidate-"I'd like to have you tell me one thing: when you hear the name of Jesus mentioned-when you read in the Scripture, or when the preacher tells you how the dear Saviour died for sinners on the cross, and how he bought heaven for all who will believe on his name, no matter who or what they be-is there some- thing away downin your soul that keeps a sayin' : Glory! Glory! Glory! If there is, I guess you may jine.1' That is it, to my mind. Whether that " glory " is a faint whisper or a shout, it is the "Christ formed within   THE SUPPER LN A CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.  153 us the hope of glory." It is the "glory"' begotten at the foot of that cross accessible to every sinner, and the common'watchword at that table approachable by every saint; world-wide removed from all bodies of theology, and in holy, vital contact with the body discerned by every eye of faith at the Lord's table. Let us cast our eyes over that multitude of guests now seated at the feast of the Lord. According to the straightest sect of our Baptist faith, that is not the Lord's Supper; but rather a solemn mockery by a company of ignorant, wilfully ignorant, anld therefore responsibly ignorant people. True, they may "discern the Lord's body"' broken for them.  They do!  But they do not discern the Lord's baptism.      , Fifteen hundred at the table, and no doubt the most of them having faith in Christ. With some, that faith is bright and clear; whila others are only in the dawn of the day of Christ. Some are able to sing: "Iow firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, Is laid for your faith in IIis excellent word." Others givo voice to a trembling soul with Newton's hymn:-               . '; Lord, decide the doubtful case: Thou, who art Thy people's sun, Shine upon Thy work-of grace, If it be indeed begun "Let me love Thee more and more, If I love at all, I pray; If I have not loved before, Help me to begin, to-day." F ifteen hundred souls that 'haveo .neIt at the -same cross-been cleansed by the same    blood-have  been baptized in the samo spiritual baptism; and, if tho an gIel   154 THE SUPPER IN A CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH. of death should hover over that table now, all the goodly company would be sitting in the temple of God, guests accepted, at the heavenly banquet. True! says every noble-hearted Baptist-glorious truth! Thank the Lord, Elder Hartleyis no fair representative of the great Baptist pulpit; neither is good Deacon - Roberts a true and faithful impersonation of the wide, Baptist pew, with its twelve hundred thousand occupants. Yes, reader, ask the question of the Baptist Church to-day, as to the hundreds of thousands of Pedo-baptists gathered at the Lord's table, spread throughout the land-ask, in the language of one of the Elders seen by John, in Apocalyp- tic vision, saying:--"who are these which are arrayed in. white robes? And whence come they?"And a voice from the thousands and hundreds of thousands of the Baptist Church would be heard, lilke the lifting up of the voice of many waters:--"These are they who have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." But ask again :-Have they the right to celebrate the death of Him in whose blood their robes have been purified? And an answer of no doubtful emphasis would reply :--"No! For their bodies have not had the washing of water. The rite of baptism can alone give this multitude of white-robed saints a right to the Calvary banquet." Fifteen hundred saints now feeding at that table-if it be the Lord's table-and, of the whole company, only brother and sister Hart, of the Evansdale Baptist Church, with a right to the Supper at all; and themselves, having no right to sit with any company but Baptists; and nowhere, this side of heaven, but in a regular Baptist Church!

And, meanwhile, presumptuous brother and sister iart themselves incurring a guilt, which will cas them out of their own church; having, this day sat together witl the assembled multitude of saints at the table ofcthe Lord, in a Pedo-baptist Church. But say you, our church is not so strict as that: then I answer, your church does not enforce the aw, If the law is right, enforce it: if wrong abandon it It was a fair and proper exercise of Baptist law, for Evansdale Church to turn Deacon Sayrook from its table, because of his nworthiness-not having been bap- tized. It is an equal duty devolving upon that church to discipline yonder brother and sister, feasting this moment at the Gospel banquet, for partaking With the unbaptized in the Congregational Church, Your faithful Pastor 'would sayy,if he found aull a Pedo  aptist enclosure :-"Come out from among them, and be ye separate;, though I hardly think he would complete the Scriptural sentence, " touch ;ot the unclean.

The Presbyterian is still a Presbyterian; the Methodist no less a Mlethodist; the Episcopalian who has generously strained his creed a little, to-day, is still a true Episcopalian; and those two Baptists yet believe, with the writer of these lines, that baptism is only by inm ersion. But they have all sat together this day beneath the cross, a beautiful, living picture of the banquet beyond the river; the heavenly feast reflected upon the earth. In the next chapter, we will listen to the talk of the two daring rebels, who have incurred the wrath of the Baptist Church in Evansdale. l ( S   *   CFTAPTER XTTT.   THE QUESTION OF fONSCIENCE.      1':R. and Mrs. Hart, coming forth from the church, had but little conversation, as they walked down to the ferry. As they said afterward, in looking back to that day, "we forgot to talk." Like poor old Deacon Saybrook, at the Baptist Church in Evansdale, the day of the com- munion, they were feasting in the Lord's house, "beyond the river." Though silent, still their counte- nances certainly did not show the consciousness of sin; but instead of the look of persons coming forth from some place of forbidden pleasure, they had an air of con- fidence and spiritual hilarity, which showed that if their act of communion had been a service of sin, they were so far ledcaptive by Satan, as to rejoice in iniquity. When they reached their room at the hotel, the hus- band was the first to break silence. " Well, my dear!" lie exclaimed. " Well," said Ellen, "well, Ed! " " This is a great day to us," said he. ' It will be a memorable one, at least," responded the wife. "You mean," said Mr. Hart, "as to the deal of our ehurch with us both, for this violation of Baptist law." "Churched sure as the world, Ed; "responded Ellen. C'They will probably hear of it, though I saw .no one from our village at the table ; did you ? " 157    THE QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE. ." Didn't I ? indeed I did! " said the husband. " Dea- con Roger's son, with hiis bride, was there-she that was Mary Palmer, you know-both members of the Presby- terian church." '"You don't say they were sitting at the table!" exclaimed Mrs. Hart. C I do say it," said Mr. Hart, "whether they saw us or not, I don't know. They sat two seats directly in front of us at the table, and must have been close behind us coming down the aisle." See us!" exclaimed Ellen; "yes, and know us too." "B3ut there was such a crowd, my dear," said the husband. "Never you mind, Ed, Mary Rogers would know me by my hat, if nothing else." "Well," said Mr. Hart, "the whole matter is out, that's sure. Do you care, Ellen a?-looking her steadily in the eye. "Do you care, my dear ?" "No;" said she, "as a matter of principle, a clear matter of right, I do not care a farthing who knows it. I feel no guilt-my conscience approves it all." " That is my case exactly, Ellen,"' said Mr. Hart. "It is one of the greatest days of my life! The sermon on 'Gospel liberty,' was worth a journey from Evansdale to New York and Brooklyn to hear. So simple! so free from pulpit mannerism, and mock sanctity! How he unfolded truth after truth: how the smile of God, reconciled in Christ, beamed and glowed through it all." "And I noticed,"' said Mrs. Hart, "that although it was ordinance day, he'made no effort to show forth his own particular creed; nor did he labor for an hour to proveo that he was liberal, and did actually love all Christians, it he did differ with them in doctrine. He   just seemed to take it for granted, that everybody knew that he loved all who loved Jesus, and he knew that there would be an exhibition of 'Gospel liberty' and liberality at the close of the discourse." " That's it, Ellen," responded Athe husband, " he did not preach eloqu'ently for an hour on the fellowship of the saints, and, at the close, send a third of the entire company of believers away from the Lord's table, by way of illustration of this doctrine." " Yes;" said the wife, "and then, when he thought it was safe to commence the Supper, be obliged to stop with the holy words upon his lips, and his hands upon the emblem of a Saviour's broken body-stop in order to remove a silver-haired old saint, fifty-five years a pil- grim toward heaven, that his presence might not con- taminate the true disciples in celebrating the Lord's death. Oh, Ed! I shall never forget that scene, to my dying day. Heaven forgive me, if I am wrong, as I said at the close of the Supper; just contrast that scene at the commencement of the feast, with what we have this day witnessed. My godly mother, too! better than -I ever can be this side the heavenly gates, Ed; mother, whose love for Jesus has burned in one steady flame, brighter and brighter, for more than half a century! she, going down the aisle, as though she was without God, and without ....

Yes ;i there is, too, a tender nature hid in his heart. But, for. him to say that it was right-" "There dear," interposed Mr. Hart, "( we shall spoil the Supper in Brooklyn, by remembering the one in   160    THE QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE. Evansdale. Let us get back to where we turned off." "And so we will;" said Ellen, " but you know I couldn't help it. My dear mother unfit-" "There you are again," said Mr. Hart. "Well, well, dear," said Ellen, "do you talk me back again from Evansdale to Brooklyn." "DIid 'you see," said Mr. Hart, ' the poor, evidently very poor woman, sitting just the next seat in front, to our right? I could not help but notice her; there was such a look of sorrow and of triumph mingled in her face. I think she was a widow, by her dress. She had evidently drank deep and long of some bitter cup, and was in need of all the tender, blessed ministry, which it is in the power of the holy Supper to impart. My whole soul was in the ordinance; and yet I saw that woman again and again, and my own devotions, so far from being lessened or in the least disturbed, were, on the. other hand, posi- tively increased -by her manifest benefit at the table. You know when the preacher was speaking of the spirits of the departed, as possibly near us at the table, I observed, that then this woman looked as though she saw in ' through the gates, into the city.'" "My dear," said Ellen, " the minister spoke as though he thought it possible for those who have loved us on the earth, and have gone to heaven, to return and visit us, especially in the hour when we are most spiritual-near- est Christ.5" "' I don't know, of course, Ellen; I don't know," said Mr. Hart " it is being wise, perhaps, beyond what 'is written, but it helps the table to me to think that it is even possible for my glorified father and mother to be near, very near, when I am in so holy a place, as the banqueting chamber of their Lord and mine. Do you   THE QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE.  know I thought to myself, if they can witness this scene -if they do behold their son, with his wife at his side, sitting at the common table of the Lord of glory, rejoic- ing to fellowship all saints, without respect to doctrinal views, it must add to their heavenly raptures. But all this is beyond us, Ellen; some bright to-morrow, we will 'see as Wue are seen,' and 'know as wae are known.' To a great degree, my dear, we make our own heaven." "Why, Ed ;' said Ellen, "'I don't know what you mean." I mean simply this," he replied. "Take a soldier, in the camp or in the field-heaven to him is his glori- ous home; the city, through whose golden gates he shall march in triumph, when life's great battle is over, and the victory won." "That was Paul's idea of heaven, although he was no earthly soldier," said the wife. "Yes ;" replied Mr. Iart, " but it was, nevertheless, a soldier's heaven: to'him, his life was ever a battle, and at its close you know, he says, ' I have fought the good fight! I have finished my course!' Now a sailors my dear, could have no such heaven: to him, it is the old ship, having weathered all the storms on life's rough sea, finally entering the quiet harbor. So, again, you might say Paul, was a sailor as well as a soldier. "Do you recollect his language in speaking of hope, as 'an anchor sure and steadfast, entering into that within the vail, whither Christ, our great forerunner, has gone.' I never realized the beauty of the figure, by its use in the pulpit. You know the Minister always has the Gospel mariner out in mid-ocean, or on some rocky shore casting anchor. But whenh I was on the Mediter- ranean, where the Apostle no doubt received his idea, I   162 -   THE QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE. one day saw the whole significance of the illustration. A little vessel-small in these days of huge ships-was making her way into a quiet harbor. The entrance was rocky and dangerous, and with the sea rolling and the surf dashing, they could not sail in through the nar- row pass. But the small boat was lowered, manned by sailors, and steered by the captain. In this boat was an anchor, with a rope attached, and one end of the rope was on the little ship. So, with the small boat, the cap- tain went in through to the smooth waters, quite beyond where the breakers were rolling, and there fastened the anchor, 'sure and steadfast,' among the rocks; and then, the sailors on the vessel, pulling on the rope, worked the ship through the dangerous passage, until she rode to safety in the calm waters of the harbor. You can make the application, Ellen." "What a beautiful figure!" exclaimed Ellen. "Beautiful, once understood," said Mr. Hart. "But now, such an illustration does not meet some poor, foot sore traveller on the land. To him, life is a journey, and heaven is the resting place at the end of the route. To a bondman, again, it is liberty. ; To a laborer, it is' freedom from toil. To the bereaved, it is the place of meeting and greeting, in the land 'where there shall be no more death,' and where God will 'wipe away all tears from all faces.' So, I say, we make our own heaven, to a great degree: in other words, heaven is ever the opposite of our great trouble. Therefore the capacity of the mind has much to do with the heavenly vision. What a heaven Milton saw!" "Well," said Ellen, " to-day the communion table has been, for the first time to me, a type of heaven --that day when they, the righteous, shall come 'from the East   THE QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE,     163 and the West, the North and the South, and,- sit down with all the glorified, in the kingdom of God."  All creeds laid aside, like travelling dresses when wo get home from our journey, and all arrayed in beautiful wedding garments-saints glorified!" "Yes; that is it, my wife ;" said lIr. Hart, "you are the best preacher. The heavenly communion, is, as I have said, reflected upon the earth: the gathering and the feast of the redeemed 'out of, every kingdom and nation and people, -under the whole heaven.' Just as to- day, from all the various paths of life, all doctrines and shades of doctrine, all colors and conditions, on the ligh broad table-land of one common privilege-all with an equal wealth in Christ; the only distinction being the different degrees of spiritual -attainment 'according to the measure of the grace.

"Well, my dear," said Mr. Htart, " one thing is clear ; and that is, that we must fully make up our minds to bear the trial and the, reproach incurred by this day's 'disobedience. You know that father Roberts would suffer and be strong. He would feel that theflesA must be crucified. I do suppose that he would, with all the love he bears you, and with all his respect for me-,in my case not love exactly, but as- his son-in-law it is a kind of love-in-law-with all his love, he would vote for your expulsion and mine, unless we should. humbly' con- fess and promise to heartily forsake'this great sin of   164    THE QUESTION OF CONSCIENCE. communion, and openly and thoroughly recant our heretical doctrines." "Which, my dear Ed, you know we cannot do " said Ellen. t' Heaven bless you, you dear little heretic!" said Mr. Hart. "But here is a telegram," said Ellen, as at that moment the servant entered the room. "It's from home. I wonder if . Oh, Ed!" she exclaimed, as she read, "'come home by the first train; your dear father is very sick; he- is failing fast; the doctor says there is yet hope.'" Overwhelmed with grief, she could only exclaim again and again, as she sobbed aloud, "my dear, dear father! Dear husband, what should I do without you now!" That night, in the first train, they were on their way home-flying toward death I *   (     CHAPTER XIV, THE PEATH OF PEACON FOBERTS.

'TWe all thought he was going then, baut he revived up and seemed stronger, and kept that way till about twelve o'clock at night, when again he' run right down, and his pulse didn't appear to beat at all." As they rode up toward the house, Hiram said, " we were all so afraid, that- you and Mr. Hart wouldn't get here before---. He's asked for you, so often." "Has hia mind, then?" asked Ellen. "Clear as a bell!" said Hiram. "Looks a little lost and confused like, swhen he comes out of one of them spells, like anybody just waking up. Oh, yes! everybody says he's wonderful clear; and now that he seems to have got rid of the terrible pains that he had at the first, he's just as calm--;says he knows he's going; and when any one asks him how he, feels, he says, I I know in whom I -have believed!

God has heard my prayer in this!" "Hiram says he has his mind," said Ellen. "Perfectly!" said Mrs. Roberts; "perfectly! knowsus all! And he is so gentle; like a little child, talking to all who approach his bed. I never heard your dear father talk as he does now, and all his sweet burden is, the love of Jesus. Says he is waiting.

"How was he taken, mother?" asked Ellen. ," Why didn't you send sooner."  "It was just such a turn,"- said Mrs. Roberts, " as you have heard him tell about, which struck him two years before your birth, when we were in Connecticut; some trouble in the kidneys and the liver. It was a severe attack, but we had no fear. The Doctor said; he would   THE DEATH OF DEAACON ROBERTS.   167 be all-over it in a day or'two. I asked if I shouldn't send for you to come home, but your father said no, and so did the Doctor. He was sure his medicines would relieve him, and that there was not the least need of disturbing you in the midst of your visit. Everything turned as in a moment, and he went into such agonies, Ellen, as I pray God I may never look upon again. And when he came out of the pain, we all thought he was dying. I suppose Hiram told you of his asking for you and Edward. Now, dear, we will go in; and do command yourself. Don't let him see your trouble any more than you can help." As they entered the room, the Pastor was sitting by the bedside, with the Bible open in his lap. The three waited at the door, as Mr. Burden was about to read and pray. "Have you any choice a" asked the Pastor. "'Yes;" said Deacon Roberts, "read the XVIIth Chapter of John:" then, closing his eyes -and with his hands clasped as in prayer, the dying man waited to hear, for the last time on earthl the sublime petition of the Son of God, commencing i "F' ather, the hour is come!" As the preacheri read the 20th and 21st verses:-- "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word :"- "tThere you have it;!" interrupted Deacon Roberts. "There, all the saints, in all time take their place in the will of Jesus. Yes, all who shall believe on him! All!- 'That they all may be one; as thou Father art in me, and I in thee that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.' Oh, Pastor," exclaimed Deacon Roberts, "I understand that oneness, up here!  The'union of the saints is   168    THE DEATH OF DEACON rOBERTS. needed to convince the world of Christ's errand to-a lost and ruined race l" And once again, as the- preacher read the 24th verse,' beginning .:- Father, I -will that ther also whom thou hast given me be with'me where I am ; that they may, behold my glory --," he exclaimed, "who can doubt the final perseverance of. a soul in Christ! 'Father, I will!' There you have it! I will!' The saints are in His will! Truth is truth!" The Pastor bowed in prayer, and at the close of the supplication, Ellen and her husband approached the bed. There was no agitation, but a smile lighted up his strong, pale face, as he saw his daughter, and drew her face down to his. "I W as afraid,' said he: and then correcting himself, "no, not afraid, but I thought it was God's good will that I should not see my child-my children,"- he added, looking at her husband--"I say, I thought I should not see my dear children this side the river. I have reached, Jordan a second time-it is down there, just before me But," he exclaimed, "the hymn does not speak for me. Not 'on Jordan's stormy banks I stand!' No, it is a quiet shore, and a peaceful river that I see, as I seem to stand where Moses stood. I am on the mount! But, unlike Moses, I shall go over. I see the shining shore! Pastor," said he, turning to Mr. Burden, " tell them to sing at my funeral, that best of all hymns and tunes, ever sung at a Christian's burial, dear old' China.' You know the first verse;- "'Why do we mourn departing friends, Or shake at death's alarm? ' Tis but the voice that Jesus sends, To call them to His arms.'"   THE DEATH OF DEACON ROBERTS.     169 The Pastor repeated the three succeeding verses, and then sang:-' "Are we'not tending upward too, i As fast as time can move? -Nor would 'we wish the hours more slow, ,. To keep us from our love. "Why should we tremble to convey Their bodies to the tomb? There the dear flesh of Jesus lay,. And scattered all the gloom. "The graves of all His saints He blessed, And softened every bed: Where should the dying members rest, / But with the dying Head?" During the singing, the dying man kept time with his hand to the music; and at the close, turning again to his children, he said, "I thought yesterday- afternoon that I could say with my Saviour, in the chapter that was read, 'father, the hour is come!' , The silver cords seemed to be loosening, and the golden bowl I thought was breaking. I know; yes, I know, my life on earth is done! Did I not say, yesterday, that I had nothing to do but to die?" he asked. Some one replied, that he did. "I was wrong! I have something to do, and, as tmy departure may be sudden, I am  anxious to say it how, and to my dear Pastor. I would be so glad if Elder Hartley was only here." Deacon Winston; Deacon Raymond,- and other mem- bers of the church had entered the room  during the singing of the hymn, and the Pastor's wife had taken her seat with Mrs. Roberts, at the bedside.  "I want,"  said Deacon Roberts, "I want to make a confession to all here, and especially to my Pastor." 1 1     e . *-1     '   p,   170    THE DEATTH OF DEACOON BOBERTS. c' Oh, Deacon," said Elder Burden, "you need not inako   ."  "Yes," said Deacon Roberts, interrupting him, "I must make it. You allknow I have a very plain way of speaking. I know I have often hurt your feelings, by the harsh things I have said; and now, as I hope to be forgiven, I ask forgiveness of you, and your dear wife; yes, of you all i- Oh; I see things in a different light, up here!" he exclaimed. "This does not wholly relieve my heart of its burden ;"' he added: "my life, for a few years past, has been embittered by doctrinal contentions; and I have been gradually led away into a craftiness and worldly policy, in dealing with those who have differed with my creed. I wanted Elder Hartley here, so as to make this declar- ation in his presence, and have him see the triumph of God's grace, as he listened to my words of confession. I did think "-he said, addressing the Pastor-" that you had a false and dangerous liberality of sentiment toward other societies  toward othertchurches. I have, my dear Pastor, felt wrong toward you, and I have talked wrong about you. Nor has my heart been right toward the," -he hesitated-" yes," he continued, " toward^the breth- ren of other churches.- I feel now, as I did in the first years of my Christian life. You remember, dear :" said he, turn- ing to his wife, "you remember!"She bowed her head and smiled, as the tears trickled down her cheeks. "Then I lived in that oneness, of which the Pastor read in the Gospel of John. But oh! I see so much further, up here!" "But," said Deacon Winston, you have not changed your doctrinal views?" ' I am  a- Baptist, dear'Deacon Winston "-he said-   THE DEATH OF DEaCON  OBEBTS.   : 171 "an old-fashioned, thorough 3Baptist. That is, I proba- bly would be, if I were to go down from here to the creeds and opinions of men. I know, Deacon, that ours is the only baptism : I know the doctrines of the church. But, I have climbed up the mountain-up to where I read in the bright, clear light:-- That they all may be one ; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.' There you have it I I am afraid, Deacon, that the stribin' of the churches makes the world to doubt, rather than to believe in the blessed Saviour. I can see no real victory but in Christ. Now," said he, much exhausted, "let me rest-the burden is gone. Now, only waiting!" and he sank into a sweet sleep, which held, him in its gentle arms for nearly tlalf an hour, "Only waiting!" whispered Ellen, as with her husband she withdrew from the bed-room, and walked out upon the piazzas--' only waiting, till the shadows are a little longer grown.                   . "' Only waiting, till the angels Open wide the mystic gate; At whose feet I long, have lingered, Weary, poor, and desolate. "' Even now I hear their footsteps, And their voices far away; If they call me, I am waiting, Only waiting to obey.'          , "No 4 shadows' with him," said lEllen. "How I wish that that beautiful hymn could be sung at his bed-side, as I have heard it.-ung by one, a royal singer whose eyes kindle while she sings, as though they were looking into the very gates of glory ; and her voicer deep and rich, ^       v    172    THE DEATH OF DEACON ROBERTS. seems to bo the voice of a departing soul, just joining the choir of heaven." At that moment, the Pastor and his wife stood at the side of Ellen and her husband. "What a scene!" ex- claimed Elder Burden. "I have been in many a death- chamber, but I think I never saw anything to equal the experience of this last hour. How all 'the hay, wood, and stubble' were burned up, as in a moment; while the 'gold, silver, and precious stones,' shone out in all their wealth and beauty, in that pure light! 'Up where I am,' as he says." "Above the creeds;" said Hr. Hart, "like some moun- tain climber above the clouds!" "I wish," said Mr. Burden, "that Elder Hartley could have been in that room. It was, reverently speak- ing, the sermon on the mount. It is worth a life-time of Christian labor' and trial, to have such a death as that through which he is passing. I have sent," he added, ifor dear old Deacon Saybrook; you know he feels grieved in remembrance of that communion season, when, according to my duty, I enforced the law of our church. I want the venerable brother to see how the love of God may dwell in the heart of a man, who stood so firm upon the foundation doctrines of the church." "Do you think, Pastor ; asked Ellen, " with the reve- lation that father has now, he would countenance the sending away of that beautiful, old, white-haired saint, from the Lord's table?' "My  dear brother ant sister," said Mr. Burden, "what can the guardian of the Lord's table do, but enforce the law of the house? As your father so often says, there you have it! I think he would abide by the usage of the church; but, I  havo no thought that. .       z, s* '   THE DEAT1 OF DEACON ROBERTS.     173 bathed in the light and love of God as he now is, he would endorse Elder Hartley's miserable tirade against sister churches. It was a libel upon the dignity-and liberality of the Baptist pulpit." ' No question there;" said Mr. Hart, " and I think, if he saw a man who really loved Jesus, at the Lord's table-though-he had never been baptized-I say it is my opinion, in the spirit of the Gospel in the XVIIth of John, that he would let him eat.'" "Yes;" said Ellen, "and teach him the way to the sacred river afterward. Any way, I guess he would leave the matter where, in my humble judgment, it belongs." "Where is that-?" asked the Pastor. "With the Lord who spread the table," she replied. ' I am glad you sent for him," said /Mr. Hart,:" and also for the pastors of the other churches. - It is invi- ting them to a place which must be the very door of heaven." "The chamber where the good man meets his fate,/ Is privileged beyond the common walk Of virtuous life, quite in the verge of heaven. " repeated the Pastor, as he returned again to the death- bed. As Mr. Burden left, Ellen exclaimed!"Oh, Ed, how cani I journey farther through these deep waters! Must I see my dear, dear father die?" Leaning upon her husband she went back in the room. T The doctor was announced.  He came in that quiet, business like way of his. Sitting down beside the bed, he felt of the pulse, and with his ear close to the breast, lie listened some moments to the breathing of the sick man.   174    THE DEATH OF DEACON ROBERTS. "Pulse feeble, but regular, and his breathing is almost like that of a healthy man," he whispered to the group, again suddenly gathered around the bed. "Is not there hope, doctor!" asked Mr. Hart. "No!" said the physician: "I think he will go in one of these sinking turns, and so escape all struggle." What a mystery; nay, what a solemnity gathers about the physician in the death-chamber. He seems like one who alone may take the soundings of the dark sea, and tell the approach of life's ship to the strange shores of eternity. His looks are studied, and his least word is heavy with the interest of the life passing away before us. As the little company stood gathered around the bed, the room door gently opened, and in came Deacon Saybrook. "How is brother Roberts?"' he asked in a whisper, of Mrs. Roberts. "He is nearing his home, Deacon," she replied: "nearing his home, rapidly." "His hope is clear, I trust ;" said the Deacon. "Perfectly!" she replied. "I vish you could have heard him talk." "i I think he is waking," interrupted the doctor: "his pulse indicates it." Just then the eyes slowly opened, and after an instant's expression of surprise, the face assumed its usual calm and intelligent look. In a moment, he recognized his neighbor Saybrook, and stretched out his hand, exclaim- ing, "I am  glad to see you, dear brother Saybrook, before I go over the river." "' You can see the home of the blessed, from where you are?" said the silver-haired old man. "Oh, yes ;," said Deacon iobecrts, "I am far up the   THE DEATH OF DEACON ROBERTS.    175 mountain, and God is giving me a view of the promised land. I shall soon go down to the river shore and cross over. "( I can get a good view of the path over which I have journeyed," he continued, I' and from up here, the church looks different to me -from what it did, when I was down yonder. I have a wider vision, Deacon! ' The rough places are made plain: the valleys are exalted, and the hills are brought low.' "This much I can say: 'The Lord knoweth them that are His! And it is not for man to number the hosts of Israel!' My baptism, as I look back to it over the long, long journey, seems to me like a prophet, dressed in shining garments, and pointing forward to my grave, with its burial, and its resurrection. Yes, ' deep calleth unto deep.' The water fortells the earth. 'Planted together with Christ-buried with Him by baptism, and raised in the likeness of His resurrection': there you have it! Any baptism comforts me, Deacon. 'I will raise them up at the last day'-yes, Craise them up' ' "Very beautiful," whispered Deacon Saybrook ;" very beautiful!" "Oh, yes, Deacon; I am a true Baptist," he continued, "but I am so far up the mountain! If I were to go down to the world again, remembering what I now see, I should have a broader charity. It seems to me, I would try and do more for Christ: spend more time in works of love for Jesus, and in trying to help mankind, and less in disputing on doctrine. Not but that the great truths must be presented at proper times and defended; but 1 mean, I would argue less and workO more. Let me -up" here, put all my doctrinal victories over my brethren of other faiths in one scale, and in the other, one simple act   176    THE DEATH OF DEACON ROBERTS. of charity done in the name of Christ for the benefit of some poor, suffering soul, and that single deed would outweigh all the glory of my cheap triumphs over the disciples of a common Saviour." Deacon Saybrook burst into tears, exclaiming, "Oh,0 that's true, Deacon; our arguments swill not put many jewels in our crowns! .But I must go," said he, rising. "I bid you farewell!" "I shall look for you, brother Saybrook!" exclaimed Deacon Roberts. "I shall look for you at the heavenly banquet, where we are all one in Christ. Good by!" Another sinking turn ensued; and it seemed, for a few moments, that he was indeed beyond the river. Again, however, he rallied, but for a brief period. "Let me talk;" he said, as the doctor raised his hand gently toward, him, "for I shall soon be gone. The hour is come! iy Christian life, with its witness for Jesus, is closing; and my angel life, with its song of triumph, is at hand. Let me talk! I am so much higher! Yes! Yes!" he exclaimed, " the love of Jesus! That they all may bo one / There you have it! I could not see this down on the plain. Tell Elder Hartley to climb Zion's Hill-get a better view! Ho won't lose sight of Jordan, either; but oh, he will see the long procession of the saints. He will behold the multitude of banners, and hear the music. Different tunes they are, no doubt, down there; but all one harmony up here. Allsounding over this mount of God the old Coronation: ' All hail the power of Jesus name! ' " At that moment, seeing his wife standing weeping at the foot of the bed, he exclaimed, ' come close to me, dear!   It won't be long, Mary! It won't be long!   THE DEATH OF DEACON ROBERTS.   1" Wo shall sit together; we, who have been all our Christian life separated at the table of the communion on earth! We shall 'sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, at the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.' Tell Elder Hartley to put more love in his sermons, and leave out the unkind words/." Then, looking as at something in the distance, he exclaimed, "I see the banners and I hear the music!-' One army of the living"'--, then broken sentences followed; strange names, never heard in the household were spoken, and suddenly, smiling with the loving look of a child he whispered, " mother!" and reaching up his arms seemed to be drawing some one down to him, while his lips again and again kissed the air. Then all was silent and motionless. "Ie is gone!" said some one. "He is gone!" "No ;" said the doctor, "this is but another sinking turn. He will come out of it, I think. Indeed, he is now apparently returning'"-and at that moment his dyes were open and bright, while a new vision seemed to unvail itself before him--still with the thought that he stood upon the mountain. "Oh, I see the people!" he exclaimed--" going, all going to a great feast, and they are dressed in every kinil of a dress. Now, iust outside the banqueting room there is an ante-room, and in it is an angel, 1 see that each of the guests, as he goes in, takes off his outside garment, and then the angel puts on him a beautiful robe, and wearing that, he enters in' through the doors. They look so different, as they come up to the gate, from  what they do when they pass through! BWhat piles of curious clothing!

And yet ;" he said, smiling, " how much they used to think of the cut. and color of those outer garments; and how much time they lost on the road, disputing about them, which might have been better spent. There ;" said he, pointing, " there comes a poor man in his shirt sleeves! And will the angel  Yes, he puts a robe on him, too! They all htave the mark in their foreheads-no matter about the dress.

How solemn sounds the stroke of the bell to a com- pany watching the departure of a soul into eternity! -"Do you think ;" whispered Ellen to Mr. Hart, " that the angels do really come down to earth? I feel as if there were so many more here than my eyes can see!" Hoe answered with , look only--a look of faith. s "Will he come out of this?" asked Mrs. Roberts of the doctor, as he stood with his fingers gently touching -the wrist of the dyingman, "do you think he will?"--At that moment his eyes opened--not suddenly, but slowly, gently opened-and with a voice scarce above a whisper, he said,-"I am higher up the mountain! the way is crowded! multitudes with the robes on are going through? Say to Elder Hlartley that all who love Jesus -all with the mark in their foreheads  the gates are so wide, and so high! Now-I see the angel in the gate1 He is bowing down upon his face and Jesus I I see my   " the eyes closed again-the smile was still on his face. "Asleep!" whispered some one. The doctor shook his Uead : the pulse had ceased. He had "entered in   THE DEATH OF DEACON ROBERTS.    179 through the gates into the City!"Another spirit had joined the innumerable company! Nothing upon that bed but lifeless clay, where, but a moment before, a soul had been telling the secrets of heaven. Mystery of mysteries! "Our very hopes belied our fears; Our fears our hopes belied-- We thought him dying, when he slept; And sleeping, when he died." Yes! Deacon Roberts was in heaven! Again, the clock in the corner struck the hour, as though it would remind the little company around that bed, that they still dwelt on the shores of time.   CWAPTER XV. THE GATHERING FLOUD. Y appointment, a few -weeks after the death of Deacon Roberts, the Deacons met the Pastor at his Study. After the usual talk of a general na- ture, they entered upon the business for which they had especially convened. It was-evident that the death-chamber scene of their departed brother, had produced a softening influence upon the more violent officers of the church ; for in all the interview, no unkind language was used in relation to members of other churches.   ' Prejudice, though not removed, was manifestly lessen- ed by the Deacon's " sermon on the Mount," as the Pas- tor\ so aptly termed it. Good Deacon Samuels was bold to say, ' that he was led to look upon the members of other societies---ho didn't know but that with a qualifi- cation or two, he might say churches-in a different light than had been his ocustom. Anyway, it did seem to him that a man like Deacon Roberts, who had been the strongest of the strong in Baptist doctrine, when * standing in the full possession of his faculties, and at the very door of heaven, for him to talk as he did about the one-nessin CArist-that it was, to say the least, a lesson of charity to all his brethren." "But," said Deacon Winston, " you know he then and there-up on the mount, as he said-still avowed him- 180   THE GATHERING CLOUD.      181 self an,' old-fashioned, thorough Baptist:' those were his words." "Yes; " said Deacon Samuels, c but yot know how he spake of his brethren in Christ, of other faiths." "I know he used the term, 'brethren,' said Deacon Winston, ".and even called Deacon Saybrook, whose expulsion from the Lord's table, was at his suggestion, and by his sanction, a brother: but we are to make some allowance for the'weakness of-the flesh.' His sym- pathies got the advantage of his better judgment, and we should judge him in Christian charity. Who of us believes. that a man as sound as we know ho was, would, when thoroughly himself, call an Episcopalian or any member of any Pedo-baptist society, a brother in Christ? I confess that I, for one, do deeply regret that he, in his dying moments, was betrayed into the use of such language. But it is easily accounted for. As I said, he was weak, and the reading of those verses in the XVIIth of John somehow shaped his mind and I do think, brethren, that lie gave way to his sympathies. I say, I regret it-not for himself, for God looks upon the heart, and he bears with our infirmities--but for its influ- ence upon others. It puts a handle, you know, into the hands of men quite too ready to use any such thing against us. "Now just here,I want to say in all kindness, that I was pained"--(the convenient way of saying provoked)- "to hear our Pastor at the funeral describe that particu- lar scene in the dying hour, andtrelate at length in that mixed assembly, all that about the different people taking off their outer garments; and saying that all, no matter what clothing they had worn before, if they had the marck, that they each and all should receive the samo t   .    ,       ;, t   182      THE GATHlaING CLOUD. glorious robe, from the angel at the heavenly gate. I am not the Pastor, but I can only say that it was not, in my judgment, good policy to open the door of that death- chamber, in the sight of that assembly of Pedo-baptists and world's people." "Why, now, I thought that was beautiful," said Dea- con Samuels. "It was to me I And another thing, Dea- con Roberts said it. It was a revelation to him, and it was right for thePastor to tell it. ie didn't endorse it that I know of, but he had a right to state it to the people. And more than that, the effect was good. I sat where I could see over the house, and the people were m tears, as they were when he described the meeting and parting of Deacon Roberts and Deacon Saybrook." We shall hear of it;'" said Deacon Winston! " Hear of it from the Pedo-baptists; and more than that, it will make work for discipline in our church.  That ' sermon on the mount,' as our Pastor irreverently calls it, will do more to upset sound doctrine, such as Elder Hartley preached, than all the arguments of all the ministers in the village. " They will say, you see how the strong men of your church talk when they climb   up Zion's hill: though tAey needn't say anything, for they have'nt got up where they can see tle river Jordan yet. But I sav, they will use it. And they have a  right to.  For if Deacon Rob- erts' talk on that bed, about all being perfect in one, and all of different creeds going into the same  banqueting room, is true doctrine, then they may well say, why not have an opEN DOOR to the table on earth." But," said Deacon Samuels, "while I  don't see how that follows,- because the table we spread is a  Baptist table, still I would like to ask of my dear brother W. in-   THE oxGAT'rING CLOUD.     183 ston this one question. Don't you believe that a disciple of Jesus Christ-a soul, born anew in Christ-may be found in the Pedo-baptist Church?" "I do not deny that," said Deacon Winston. "Well then, if he is once in Christ he will go to heaven when he dies, won't he?" said Deacon Samuels. "He must " responded DeaconsWinston.   "Then," said Deacon Samuels, " as bur late brother used to say, 'there you have it!' That's in perfect harmony with the vision of Deacon Roberts : the' mark in the forehead' was the passport. And surely, if there was a table set in heaven-which is the perfect church of Christ--they would have a right to it. And that too, not because of what they wore in going up to the door, but because of the mark and- the robe. He saw all of the company with the sipg in their foreheads entering THE OPEN DOOR." "Well ;' said Deacon Winston, "suppose the Deacon had seen a Universalist, or a Roman Catholic, or a man ] belonging nowhere, like the man in shirt sleeves, each with the mark you tellof, would you have them all go in?-" "I don't keep the door, Deacon," replied Deacon Sam- uels. The Lord of the banqueting room and of the--ban- quet has His own law. But if you ask me what I think, I will say I think that if they each had the mark in the forehead, the angel would let them in. I don't see how he could shut out one with the mark on him, without shutting out Christ himself."  "Well, we will drop this;" said Deacon Winston, "but it seems to me you stand on dangerous ground. And it just shows the effect upon S the ppople, of the death-bedvision of good Deacon Roberts, The argn- ment is all in a nut-shell."    184      THE GATHERING CLOUD. '"Then if we crack the shell, we shall get the meat," responded Deacon Samuels. "I hope it is not a I7ard shell." "Jesting aside;" said Deacon Winston, "the whole matter is just here. No matter what a man believes- Calvinism or Arminianism, Baptism 'or Pedo-baptism--. if he has been cleaned from sin by the blood of Jesus --lias the marli-he will go into heaven, even to the table of the Lord. IDoctrines and ordinances are noth- ing! Go into that heaven, which i's Paul's idea of the perfect church; and to that table, which is the divine description of the communion of the saints -now if that isn't rank heresy, I should be glad to know what is heresy! Into the perfect church, and unto theperfect table, any soul, regardless of all the great doctrines I Yes, he has a free and full right, because of the 'mark in the forehead!' Understand, whether baptized or notl A Universalist or a Roman Catholic, even! See, my brother, see where it leads you! Is it not the duty of the church on earth to strive as far as in it lies, to be like the church in heaven? Just as a Christian strives to be like his ascended Lord. Has not Deacon Saybrook the minark? With all his errors of doctrine, is not he a Christian? Everybody believes it! Then, if your reasoning be correct, for us to send him away from his Lord's table-for that's what weo know it is-I say, to send him away that day was as though the angel, seen by Deacon Roberts, had 'sent some soul with the marjk away from the doors of tho heavenly church, and-from the heavenly banquet, because lie did not wear the right garment when he came up to the gate. I know," he continued, " you may say that every man, when he went in, had on the same kind of   THE GATHERING CLOUD.      185, robeo but the angel gave him the robe, because he had the mark.  This,)' said Deacon Winston, "is what I would call THE OPEN DOOi!"' Deacon Samuels replied in a word: "'it ia important to a man's growth in grace and consequent efficiency on earth, that he should hold the truth. 'The more he has the stronger he is. But the ground of his salvation is his faith in the crucified Redeemer; and, as the Deacon said in his vision, his right to the robe and his right to enter heaven and sit at the table on high, is the inark inr Ms forehead. This mark, church admission cannot put on, and church exclusion cannot- take off. Nay, more, it involves rights and privileges that no association of men on earth can either give or take away." "Well, it's more than time," said Deacon Winston, '"that wo went at the- business properly before ns; but with the Pastor's permission, I would like to ask Deacon. Samuels just one more question." "Speak on, Deacon ;" said the Pastor, "for truth to tell I have been greatly interested in this morning's debate." "My question is this," continued Deacon Winston, "will you admit a Presbyterian, an Episcopalian, or a Universalist into heaven?"' "I am not the keeper of heaven's gate!" replied Deacon Samuels. "That's begging the question!"' said Deacon Winston. "Well, I say," said Deacon Samuels, " without hesita- tion, that no Pedo-baptist can be found in heaven, and never will be." "I don't go quite as far as that," said Deacon Win- ston. "I do, and I go further," said Deacon Samuels.   186      THE GATEhitING CLOUD. "None of the heathen will go in?" said Deacon Win- ston. "Further still " said Deacon Samuels. 'Not a Baptist!" "Well there, Pastor;" said Deacon Winston, " you hear that with your own ears! Why, one moment ago you had the door open to almost everybody, and now shut it against the Baptists themselves." "That's it;" said Deacon Samuels, " no Baptist! no Pedo-baptist!" "Well, tell us then, besides the angels who never sinned, and God's covenant people of old-I suppose they go in--who will be in heaven "' Deacon Samuels Axed his eyes kindly but steadily  upon Deacon Winston, and pausing for a few seconds, answered, " my dear brother, I will tell you-every blood- zoas-ied so ulr" "Well, brethren," said the Pastor, "we had better pro- ceed directly to business. I have been told that Deacon Winston has something to present, in regard to myself-" "No ;" said Deacon Winston, somewhat embarrassed, "oh, no. Some time ago, our late brother Roberts and myself agreed that we would bring up some - matters touching the Pastor. We talked with Elder Hartley, when he was here, and he thought it was our bounden duty to do so." "Well," said the Pastor, " don't hesitate. You know the liberty of our Deacon's meeting." "No;" said Deacon Winston, "I rather guess th{1 matter may as well be dropped. Times have changeOc and Deacon Roberts has gone home." ' But,' said the Pastor, "I shall have to insist that you state what this grievance is?"   THE GATHElrIIN- CLOUD.     187 f Oh;" said he, " it's something you have heard, no doubt, from Deacon Roberts. You know he used to feel a little hurt, that you brothered so freely the ministers and members of Pedo-baptist societies. Elder Hartley, in his cry aloud and trumpet sermon, said it was wrong. That start with acknowledging a Pedo-baptist as a Christian brother, and there was no stopping place from that, clear to the communion table. And he seemed to make it out. However, Deacon Roberts- is no more here, and I don't know but the matter has been made more of than it had a right to claim, and I will drop it." "You may, Deacon," said the Pastor, " but I will say a word upon the subject just now, and then dismiss it. Our lamented' brother, I am aware, was very much exercised upon the matter; with no sympathy in his views, I greatly respected the honesty of his prejudice.' "-Yes," said the Deacon, " you know every man has a ight to his opinion."' "That needs some'qualification," said the Pastor. A" man has a right to his opinion, if his opinion be right. Suppose I thought you to be a thief, and did not use every means within my power to ascertain the truth in .the matter; would I have right to my opinion? As a general thing, a man should be respected in his opinion; but your position, Deacon, is nota safe one. "There are various brotherhoods in this world, re- ligious, and otherwise. Most men, to my mind, have brotherly spots in them. Seldom do I meet a man ivho is all brother. The highest of all brotherhood is the fellowship of the saints: the brethren in Christ-born by the power of one Spirit-redeemed by the same blood -our hopes centering in the same promises-and bound for the same heaven. Do you not see, brethren, that   188      THE GATHERINTG CLOUD. this broad brotherhood has nothing to do with Baptism or Pedo-baptism, Calvinism or Arminianism-nor any other ism. The man whuo loves Jesus -is my brother, whatever be his, color, creed, country, or condition. There is i. brotherhood of liberty--there is a grand and glorious brotherhood of humanity. "Now within the great circle of Christian brotherhood are many smaller circles of faith and fellowship. There is a brotherhood of doctrine. Now you will understand me; I say I can find some brotherly spot in almost any heart: and men should search for these same spots in their neighbors. The Saviour, in one place, describes the kingdom of heaven as a net, which a man drew to shore, in which were all manner of fishes, both good and bad. Do you notice, there were some bad fish, if they had all been under water. The divine teacher says, the man kept the good fish and threw the bad away. Men, Christian men, often reverse this action of the wise fisherman: they let down the net into the stream o0 a man's life, and then haul it ashore for investigation. They throw the good fish away, and keep the Tad; and go through the church and through the markets of the world, crying " bad fish!" The fellowship of Christianity is the brotherhood of soldiers of the same government, and the same flag. From thence you pass on, crossing the lines of lessening circles, until you find, at last, the peculiar fellowship of your own particular company. t ' Deacon Raymond tells me there are a number of names to come before us as subjects of discipline," said the Pastor. "He will please to name them, that wo may take proper action, according to tho- necessities of the several cases.',   THE GATHERING CLOUD.      189 Said Deacon Raymond: "Wm.'R. . Ward left the table, tho day of the trouble with Deacon Saybrook, and is attending the Methodist Church, where his wife belongs. I have seen him, and can only say that he does not show a spirit of repentance, but attempts to justify his course in leaving the table. ' "Roger A. Burt confesses to have communed with the Presbyterian Society last summer while on a visit to his father, a Presbyterian. I have seen him, and labored with him. I tried to make him see the sin involved in such an act. He says he sees nothing wrong in it--says there was no Baptist Church in, the place, and that he felt a desire to celebrate his Saviour's death, and under like circumstances would do it again. "And then there is our brother -Hart. He openly declares that every man who is regenerated and walk- ing worthy of his profession, being the Lord's disciple, has a right to the Lord's table; at. least he makes it a question of conscience. He says he does not believe that the Baptists have any-authority from the word of God, to shut out members of other churches from the table; that it is a matter between the communicant and his Lord. More than this; I have good evidence that, when he and his wife were recently in New York, they both actually went to the Lord's table in a Congrega- tional Church in Brooklyn. They were seen by two of our Pedo-baptist neighbors.' It was moved and carried, that the board recommend the church to cite each and all of the persons named, to appear before the church, to answer for their disorderly conduct. The meeting closed with prayer by Deacon Winston, who prayed most earnestly that these wayward members   190     THE GATHERING CLOUD. '"might not be turned out of the way, but that they might rather be healed." He also asked the Lord to give the church strength and firmness, equal to the thorough pruning of the vine of 'I His own right hand's planting," from all its dead and fruitless branches.   * As the meeting closed, Deacon Samuels asked Deacon Winston if he did not believe that an unbaptized saint might enter heaven. "Possibly!" replied Deacon Winston--" bt he shall be eaten with many stripes. "Inside the gate?" asked Deacon Samuels. Just as the company was. about to separate, Deacon Winston said he would like the brethren to tarry a moment while he read to them an anonymous paper which had been circulated freely throughout the church, especially among the younger members. He said, that although no name was attached to the documents, still he had his suspicions. If Hart did not write those words, then nobody wrote them. It was entitled A: RIEF [BAPTIST CATECHSM. RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO ELDER HARTLEY. THE CHURCH. I. Question.-Of whom is the church composed? Answer.-Of baptized believers only. II. Question.-What are the ordinances of the church? Answwer.- There are two ordinances-Baptism and the Lord's Supper. "I. Question.--What only is Baptism? Answer.-Immersion.   THE GATHERING CLOUD.      191 IV. Qucstion.-Who only may administer the ordin- ance? Answer.-The regular officers of the church, in the church. V. Question.-The church being a body of baptized believers, can an unbaptized minister administer the. ordinance of baptism? Anszcer.-It is impossible; for being unbaptized, he is not in the church; his act- therefore cannot be baptism. - I. Question.--The man nominally thus receiving bap- tism, being unbaptized, is he not equally disqualified with the man who assumed to baptize him, and must not this disqualification continue in an endless succession? Anstzer.--Yes! the tree being evil, the fruit must be also evil. "A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit." VII. Question.-Was Roger Williams baptized: and( did he baptize his deacon I Answer.--He was not baptized when he immersed the deacon, therefore the deacon was not baptized when he immersed him. The church only hath power to baptize. Williams being unbaptized, was not in the church e Not being in the church, he could not administer the ordin- ance ; and the disability of the minister is by necessity the disability of the deacon; for the latter not being bap- tized, was also without the church; andt therefore the immersion of IRoger Williams at his hand was not bap- tism, for the same reason that his p1revious immersion by Mr. Williams was no baptism. VIII. Question.--Did Roger Williams establish really a Baptist Church? Answer.-He did in form, but he did not, and could not in practice, for " a church is composed of baptized   192     'THE GATHERBINXC CLOUD. believers," and those wholreceived immersion by him- self, or his successors, to the latest generation, were not baptized. IX. Question.--Did Christ baptize? A2nszoer.---"Jesus himself baptized not." (John IV: 2.) X. Question.--Who baptized-tho firsto man? and was the adrannistration of the ordinance afterward by him valid? Answer.-By the logic of the church, the first admin- istrator being unbaptized, he had not power to baptize, and of necessity this disability has descended through the succeeding ages and generations of man. XI. Question.-Is there a true church on earth? Answer.--There is not-there never has been-and there never can be. The argument is simple, and tho chain is perfect. The church is composed only of bap- tized believers. He who is immersed by an unbaptizcd man, is not himself baptixed, and his successors are in equal disability. The first professed administrator be- ing of necessity unbaptized, his act was invalid, and his failure of title disinherits all his descendants. XII. Question.--Should we not deny a doctrine which forces us to such a conclusion? Anszwer.-Tho premise is wrong-the argument ricli" Tculous-and the conclusion both false and foolish. THE LOrD's SUPPrE B !XIII. Qucstion.-Where only can thb : Supper be spread?. anstzer. -In the--visible' church., XIV. Qtuestion.--A society of unbaptized believers   THE GATHEiRING CLOUD.     193 not being a church, can that body administer the Sacra- ment? Answer.--It cannot, for the ordinance can only be administered by the church. XV. Question.-The table being only spread in the spiritual house (the church), and there being no entrance to that house but by baptism (immersion), is it- posszie for an unbaptized man, though he formally sit at the table, to actually partake of the Lord's Supper? Anszoer.-It is not possible. He is legally disquali- fled. He is not in the house (the church) where only the table can be spread. A man cannot partake of the Supper without eating and drinking, as a man cannot be baptized without immersion; but a man can eat, and drink, without partaking of the Supper, as a man can be immersed without being baptized. XVI. Question.-Should the church forbid an unbap- tized believer to approach the Lord's table? Answer.-It is an act of folly to forbid'a man to do that which by necessity he cannot do. As a Pedo-bap- tist cannot eat the Lord's Supper, the prohibition is an absurdity. XVII. Question.--Should the church  discipline a member for going to the Lord's table in other than a Baptist Church?  Answoer.-A  church, being a body-of baptized believ- ers, there is therefore no church but the Baptist. As the church only can spread the table, the Lord's Supper' may only be found in the Baptist Church. We should not discipline a man for going to a church which does not exist, and eating at a table which cannot be spread. XVIII. Question.-Should the minister invite mem- bers of the church to'the Lord's table.?   194      THE GATHERING CLOUD. Answer.--He should announce the Supper: he has no power to invite the disciples to their Lord's Supper, for the right of each disciple is equal to his own. The Sup- per is the Lord's-the disciple is the Lord's. The two ordinances--Baptism and the Supper--existed before the church was formed. The church has adopted them. XTX. Question.-Why is it that such a multitude of intelligent, influential disciples of Christ- believing that immersion only is baptism--are added every year to the Pedo-baptist Church? Answoer.-B1ecause they will not, and cannot submit to the tyranny of conscience involved in "Close Communion." "There," said Deacon Winston, "you have heard the document, and I have nothing to say, only this, brethren --you see where we are drifting!" "It is a curious paper,:' said Deacon Samuels, " but I don't think it is worth our while, as officers of the church, to notice it." "Keep up the doctrinal fences," said Deacon Winston, "and we won't lose the flock." "But the trouble is," said Deacon Samuels, "that with the fence so high, and the gate bolted, the sheep out- side cannot get in, and so, finally, they go into other folds where the gates are open." "( No loss," said Deacon Winston, " we can afford to let such sheep go!" --"Don't know about that," replied Deacon Samuels; "they have all been washed in Jordan, and I don't think  my brother Winston himself would despise a few fleeces from such a flock. I wonder," he added,   THE GATHERING CLOUD.     195 "hass Elder Hartley read the paper, for it is dedicated to him." '"Elder Hartley read that chain of simple questions and childish answers," exclaimed Deacon Winston; ,"the mighty mind of a Hartley couldn't go as low as that!" "We must -weed the Lord's garden!" exclaimed Dea- con Raymond. And the deacons departed, leaving good Elder Burden to his own curious thoughts, arising from' the conversation and the catechism.   CHAPTER XVI. THE TRIAL, CONYICTION AND PUNISHMENT OF THE  aERETICS. H' :HE church was out in full force, for it was known ,5,) that prominent members were, that night, to &5^^' stand before the same for trial. At the appointed hour, the Pastor was in the chair as Moderator, and the usual announcement was made, that all persons not members of the church should retire. The Clerk read the minutes, in which it was stated that'the following persons had been duly cited to appear before the church, viz : Winm. R. Ward; Roger A. Burt; Edward A. Hart, and Ellen, his wife. At the call of the ]Moderator, the parties named arose, and declared them- selves ready for trial. Mr. Roger A. Burt, at the request of the Moderator, stood before the church, while the Clerk read the accusa- tion: "Brother Burt is charged with violating the law and usage of the church, by communing with a Pedo- baptist Church, (so called)." "The church," said the Moderator, "will hear the statement ofbrother Burt." The accused then spake as follows: "Mr. Moderator, and brethren and sisters of the church. Some time in the month of August last, I was on a visit to my father in the village of Warrentown, where I spent some six weeks. My father is a Presbyterian, a member of the 196   TUE TRIAL.       197 church of that faith in that village. There is no Baptist Church in the town. On the second Sabbath in August, I was present at the morning service, and at the close of the sermon, the Lord's Supper was- administered. All who loved the Lord Jesus Christ were invited to par- take. My father requested me to stay, and receive the Supper.  Knowing that I did love Jesus, and had rendered obedience to His commands, I remained sitting at my father's side, and in the seat that my mother had vacated for a place in heaven ; and I confess, that I, then and there, did eat of the emblem of a Saviour's broken body, and did drink of the wine which signified His blood, in obedience to the command, ' do this in remem- brance of me."'  "Have you any confession or acknowledgement to make, of having done wrong in the sight of God and the church?" asked the Pastor. "None," replied Mr. Burt. "' You can take your seat," said the Moderator. And Mr. Burt sat down. Wm. It. Ward, at the request of the Moderator, toolk his stand before the church, and the Clerk -read the charge in the following words:--' Brother Ward is charged with vacating his place at the Lord's table; and also of attending the Methodist Church." Said the Moderator:-- "Brother Ward will answer to the charges, as preferred against him. The church will listen to brother -Ward." This was his confession :--"At the last Communion Sabbath, I was present with mny wife, she being a mem- ber of the Methodist Church. It was the Sabbath Wlhen Deacoin Saybrook was sent from tho table.' I had listened, with great interest and profit,to thl sermon by   198        THE TRI4L. our Pastor, on the true grounds of Christian fellowship, as based upon our common union with Christ. "I saw how churches could be separate in doctrinal views, and yet all united around the cross, as one body in Christ. On the table, I beheld represented that body broken, as it seemed to me, for every believer. I felt that each blood-washed soul had a right to it. And when I saw my wife sent away from the Lord's table, at the close of the sermon, knowing, as I did and do, her love for Jesus, and her ability to rightly answer the Apostolic test, namely, to ' discern the Lord's body'-I say body, not baptism; for this ordinance does not show his bap- tism, in his burial and resurrection, but his body broken --seeing her turned away, as the Pastor's wife would have been, had she been present, and- as Deacon Rob- crt's wife actually was, I confess, I went away too. It was no disrespect to the Holy Supper, but I could not think the ordinance properly administered; I judged thflat if the church was too good for my wife to communoe with it, it was too good for me; and so I left. I will only add, that I have attended-the Methodist Church twice." Said the Pastor --' Are you, brother Ward, prepared and willing to humbly confess your fault, and ask the forgiveness of the church?" "I am not conscious of having done wrong," replied' ]Mr. Ward. "You will take your seat," said the Pastor. Edward A. Hart was called, and took his stand before lhe church tribunal. Tho Clerk read the charge, as follows :-"Brother Hart is accused of openly promulga- ting sentiments contrary to the faith and practice of teo regular Baptist -Church. He is further charged with communing with a Pedo-baptist Church in Brooklyn,   THE TRIAL. S       199 during his recent visit to New York; and his wife, also, a participant in this last-named violation of Baptist usage."' "Brother Hart," said the. Moderator, " will make his statement to the church." Defence of Edward A. Hart: "Mr. Moderator and brethren of the church: I admit the two-fold charge, as Iead by the Clerk. I am accused of heresy. While I grant that I have freely spoken to others of my peculiar doctrinal views, in the language of Paul I can say that, 'my accusers have neither found me in the (church) disputing with any man, neither raising up the people. But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the (Gospel of Christ). And herein do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward men.' "My parents-now in heaven--were Presbyterians; , my father, for many years, an Elder of the church. I was converted under the ministry of a Presbyterian Clergyman, in a western city. I joined the Presbyte- rian Church-as most young converts join the church wherein they have found Christ. With no special thought of peculiar doctrinal views, but with the one, single, glorious faith, that the blood of Jesus had washed away the stain of sin; I could say with the man in the Gospel, this one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.' "I knew little of theology. I did not ,?ee and under- stand all the doctrines of the church, but I did see how God could be just, and the justdfier of every woe who beliceveth. I did not see a body of doctrines, but I saw   200        THE^ TRIAL the- Lord's body broken for me. I remained in the com- munion of that church  '9 Here Deacon Winston interrupted the speaker, saying, "[ Mr. Moderator, I protest' against brother Hart using the term 'church,' in speaking of any Pedo-baptist society! You know, and he ought to know, that a 'church' is composed of baptized believers only; and we are aware that the people-good people, no doubt- of whom he speaks are not baptized, and therefore are no church, but simply a society, which, denying- one ordinance, can have no right or power to administer ,another. I hope my dear brother Hart will take what I say in all kindness, and much oblige me, at least, by saying society, when he speaks of people who never passed through the watery door, and therefore are not and cannot be in the spiritual house of God-the church of Christ. The brother knows that the Lord himself declares there is only one door." "I grant the last statement of Deacon TWinston ;' said the accused, "Jesus does say that there is only one door, and He also says, ' I am the door '" "I hope the brother will not be interrupted;" said the Moderator "I will rule as to order, and any brother can appeal. Go on, brother Hart." "'Iremained,' he continued, "in the communion of that church for a number of years, and found spiritual health and strength in its holy fellowship. I passed through a number of glorious revivals of religion, in which a great company were born into the Kingdom, many of whom joined the Presbyterian Church; while others united with the Methodist Church, the Reformed Church, the Episcopal Church, and the Baptist Church. I can bear joyful and grateful testimony to countless blessed   THE TH IAI.       201 seasons at the Lord's table, in the Presbyterian Church."             ' Deacon Winston here again interrupted the brother, saying 'now, Mr. Moderator, I must' protest against this language! To have these young converts, who have just entered the churci:, hearing about the Lord's table in a Pedo-baptist Church! This must be stopped; and I now move that brother Hart be, at this point, required to answer yes or no, to the two-fold -charge broughl[t by this church. He is only poisoning the minds of the younger members with his heresy." The Moderator ruled the Deacon out of order, and Mr. Hart proceeded. "It is not within the skill of Deacon Winston, even at  the expense of Christian courtesy, Mr. Moderator, to draw me into the discussion of a side issue. -It only occasions delay. The Spirit often set his divine seal to the administration of the Lord's Supper, in my experi- ence, at the table spread in the Presbyterian Church; and I do not believe He would witness to an error, or set Itis seal to a sham and a mockery. With the rich taste in my mouth ofJigs plucked by my own hand from that tree in the Lord's garden, I cannot call it a thistle. ' A tree is known by its fruits: andcmen do not gather figs of thistles.' "After the lapse of a number of years, a spirit of inquiry came upon me, and I was led to examine the peculiar hoctrines of the Presbyterian Church. i Laying aside all creeds and catechisms, I shut myself up wfith my Bible, praying to God for light; and I - resolved to be whatever that book of God should make ale. "I cannot give here a detailed account of my experience   m=umai    THE TRTAT. in this Bible study. To the following concl usions Iwas conducted: First, that there was no baptism in the Bible, but iminersion; Second, that only those who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, to the salvation of their souls, had a right to the ordinance; Third, that baptism was significant of the sinner's death to tilhe world, burial from the world, and resurrection into the New Kingdom--(Rom. Chap. VI,)-and that, like tile baptism of Christ, it was prophetic of the death, burial, and glorious resurrection of the body of the believer. (See Chalmers and AlfRnigt on Rom. Chap. Vei.) Thsat the Lord had left with te church only two ornanes or sacraments; 1st, the Sizvpper, to 'show forth ]is death ;' 2d, the Baptism, to sholw forth Iis urial and. /is resurrection. "With that faith, I joined the Baptist Church. In that taith I now stand, and in common with all the disciples ,f Christ, 'have faith toward God.' "wlnow briefl set forth my present belief, for the eclaration of Which I am charged with heresy this day. :'believe- that the clhurch in heaven is the perfect pat- Orn I of the church of Jesus Christ. That the enitrance ato that church, by virtue of the sacrifice of Christ, is m privilege, through infinitenriches of graco of every  eliever ;. or, as my fathler-in-law, Deacon Roberts, saw I his death-bed vision, to evey soul having the marJ the forehead. And I am bold to declare further,'that that heavenly sanctuary there is spread the iarriage  i Lpper of the Lamb, at which every blood-washed soul  s a God-given right. That his claim to a seat at that ble, is infinitely above and beyond ail creeds and cus- ms of men-a right, 'written in the Lamb's book of life' lh a pen dipped in redeeming blood.   THE TRIAL.         203 "I do believe,' that the Lord's Supper is the manifesta- tion of the Cross of Christ. Paul says of it: 'Christ visibly set forth, crucjfied in your midst.' Jesus speaks not of Calvary, but of the table, saying,' t/4 is my body, brokenfor you.' The penitent, believing soul, anxious to find the manifest God, and crying out:- ' Nearer my God to Thee, nearer to Thee, E'en though it be a cross, that raiseth me.'- that soul has a right to approach that broken body, the inherent right of a hungry man for food, or the thirsting man for drink. That each ordinance stands equally upon the one, single, perfect ground of savingfaith, and is accessible to every soul. The order of precedence of the one ordinance, as necessarily and invariably before the other is nowlere in the book of God declared, by a ' tius sait7t the Lord.' A disciple of Christ has a right, vested solely in his regeneration, to 'show forth' the death, the burial and resurrection of his Lord. As death precedes burial, the Supper seems to stand before baptism. By his spiritual birth, he was born into the church of Christ; 'of whom the whole family, on earth and in heaven, are named.' Therefore, being by grace in that house 'not made with hands-' he claims the right to those ordinances, instituted before the visible church was erected and perfected. I do not believe John's baptism was Christian baptism. It was immersion, and there is no baptism but by immersion; but there can be immer- sion without blaptism. Baptism requires a cot tin, and the use of a divinely appointedform. That condition is, as ill Baptists believe, the result of the action of the Holy Ghost upon the heart, in producing repentance for sin, and faith in a crucified, risen, ascended, and glori- ' }i   204        THE TRIAL. fled Redeemer. The form of words as given by the Lord, is, 'in thAe name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.' i Such alone, is or can be Christian baptism. Such was not John's baptism. The countless multitudes who came to Jordan, were baptized into the belief that the M]Iessiah was at land.  And we know that the disciples of Christ themselves, with all the advantages of the teachings of their divine Mas- ter, did not understand the holy mystery involved in the necessity of His death, until after His resurrection, when the great and vital truth was presented unto them by their risen Lord. What then could have been the condition of those baptized by John, if the disciples of Christ were thus ignorant? A number of the converts of John declared to Paul, that they had not ' so much as heard if there be a Holy Ghost'V Paul explained to them the nature and character of John's baptism, and after educating them into the true faith, he baptized them. (Acts XIXth.) "Now at the Supper of the Lord, in that upper cham- ber in Jerusalem, there are sitting twelve men. Woe will leave out Judas. It is claimed by some that he left before the Supper began: this is denied by others. Of the eleven communicants, how many have been baptized? Where in the Book is the record? Of two only is there a proof of baptism, and those two were baptized by John, whose baptism, as I have proved, would not be declared Christian baptism by the church of Christ to- day. (See John I: 35 --42). Then, is baptism a pre- requisite to the jLord's table? It is neither declared by word or example in that upper room. Does the wrord of God elsewhere say, a-man shall not go to the table unless he has been baptized,? The chapter and verse   THE TRIAL.        .20 cannot be found! Is there any pre-requisite to the Supper declared in God's word? Yes! in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, XIth chapter, beginning at the 23d verse, the apostle gives an account of the institution of the Supper, in language adopted by the church and repeated so often as the table is spread. In tho 27th, 2Sth, 29th and 30th verses, he points out the unworthy communicant. "(27th), 'Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.' This is indeed fearful language, and let me carefully see who, in Paul's sight, is the unworthy one.  Many of the Corin-  thians made it a common feast, and utterly lostsight of the sacrifice there declared. To this sin, Paul refers: "(28th.) ' But LET A MAN EXAMNE HMSELF, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.' "(29th.) For he that eateth andc drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation (condemnation) to himself not discerning the Lord's body.' "There is, then, a pre-requisite to the Lord's table: it is, to discern th7e Lord's body.' I is, to see and under- stand-to believe in and adore the mystery of God's love. "I believe, that baptism is an ordinance justly used as an initiatory rite in entering the visible church, and should be required of every one passing into that sacred enclosure. I believe, the Pedo-baptist Church mistakes as to the administration of that rite. T "But I do not believe, that because she errs in the one ordinance of whose form she is ignorant, viz: baptism, that she has no right to administer another ordinance-- the Supper--hicli she does understand. -'A man may be ignorant of tho true mode of washing   206        THE TRIAL. his hands, but I cannot see how Inis failure in the wash- ing-unless it is a positively declared law of the house-- can forbid Lis place at the supper table in his own father's family. '*I might add, that rather than turn him starving away from a table, to which he was invited by Him who spread the feast, and in which invitation washing was not named as a pre-requisite: let him eat, and after the Supper, after his immtedia te--hunger is satisfied,; let the children of the household tell him of the usual order of the house. But let them not dare to send him--ignorant though he may be-from a table, at which they alone sit by the grace of Him who only can exercise government and authority. The Divine Being, who called that poor soul to the Gospel banquet, fed the hungry multitude in Judea, utterly regardless of creed or country. Hunger was the ,passport to the feast spread upon the green table-cloth of the field: 'I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way,' saith He. The disciples could not understand how the great company could be fed, but Christ made a way. They would have sent them breadless into the wilderness. I am, Mr. Moderator, in favor of' close communion.' I want to get closer to the M3ettlodist, closer to the Presbyterian, and closer to every man who lovesJesus Christ. It is sfaying very little, to tell me that the Baptists are as liberal as those Pedo-baptists, who make baptism a pre-requisite to the, table. That is true, and we have been over that arguiment an hundred times. I have not to do with man's creed, but Chrzst's law! I do not ask for that union-- in my judgment, the vision of an enthusiast--when all creeds shall pass away. I believe that more can be done by the separate organizations, than by the obliteration   THE TIAL.         207 of all dividing doctrines. But-I do want in this grand army of the Lord, with all its State designations and regimental banners, the one flag of the holy nation everywhere seen, and covering the tent of every soldier. With its local regulations in different sections, I want the right declared and understood, that a soldier of the grand army, whatever his particular mark or sign, may have a right to eat with any company of soldiers of the same government and under the same flag, wherever found; knowing -at all the food. is taken from the common government stores, and is the right- of every true soldier. "The whole Christian world is moving, Mr. Modera- tor.   The day of needless and bitter disputations is passing rapidly away. The battle is at hand, and the word along the lines is,--' close up!' Stand shoulder to shoulder! The banner emblazoned with the cross-is at the head of the army: the Supper of the Lord is the glorious declaration of that cross. Let us not quarrel with the faithful and brave soldiers at the banquet! Tell me not, lIr. Moderator, of the habit of the church in the third century, or any other century! I leave all that with 'the traditions of the Elders.' I take the glorious covenant of the Gospel! I  demand the ' thus saita tJe Lord!' "My  answer to the second charge, viz : of communing with a Pedo-baptist Church, shall be brief. "If that Congregational body in Brooklyn is a church, it had a  right to spread the Lord's table. That being the Lord's table, myself and my wife had a right to-that table, having, in the judgment- of the Baptist Church itself, obeyed the law which, it is claimed, is a pre- requisite to the table. "On the other hand, if it was not a -lurch, then, by  '    -* -V    208        THE TRTAT,. your own judgment, it could not spread the Lord's Supper ; and therefore we are not to be condemned and punished, for, doing what by no possibility we can do, to wit- eating from a table which cannot be spread, and in a church which does not exist. ," I have no thought of leaving the Baptist Church; though with my wife I may be expelled from a particular body claiming to be the only true church. Believe me, Mr. Moderator, this voke of close communion galls the noble neck of the church. There is a spirit of liberty in the Baptist Zion; there are hidden forces which will be revealed; a multitude of captains in the pulpits, and a host of soldiers in the pews of the great and glorious Baptist Church in this land I 'We have no time to waste in warring with brethren differing in creed, but loving a common Saviour. Our only battle is with the great enemy of our Divine Master. There is no time to debate as to the form and shape of weapons, while the bugles are calling to battle, and proclaiming the conflict. We do not stop to discuss the question of corn laws, when the people are starving for bread! Tfianking you for your patient hearing of my defence, I take my seat." The Moderator asked if Mrs. Hart should now beo arraigned before the church. It being- understood that her husband had expressed her own sentiments, in the declaration of his views of doctrine and usage of the church, she was not required to stand before the council. A resolution bffered by Deacon Winston, and seconded by Deacon Raymond, was passed by a small majority of the brethren present, withdrawingthe hand of Christian and church fellowship from Mr. and Mrs. Hart, and also from Mr. Burt and Mr. Ward. " iAnd they cast them out!"   ' CHAPTER XVII. THE ECOND JAPTIST FHURCH OF      VYANSDALE. "SL must take the step! ' said Elder Burden to his A wife, as he returned from the scene of execution 5 in the Evansdale Church; when Mr. 5Ward, Mr. Burt, and Mr. and Mrs. Hart bared their necks to the sectarian guillotine, and paid the last full penalty of ecclesiastical law. "' I must take the step! PFrom this day forth-I will, in giving notice of the sacrament of communion, simply announce ' the Lord's Supper!' and add 'let every disciple of Christ examine hmself and so let him eat-having the answer of a good conscience toward God; for unto his own master he standeth or falleth.' This is. the spirit and the actual practice of the greater portion of Baptist Churches, no matter what may be the pulpit announcement. Many carry the old banners inscribed, 'all sister churches of the same faith and order are in- vited,' but they are marching to the new and better music of Gospel charity and love. They will not wzithhold the cup or plate- from the out-stretched hand of an unbaptized disciple! Zlly banner and music shall be in harmony! "Baptist brethren of the pulpit, noble men of God, in' every direction, may be found, with the full conviction that rigid, unexceptionable close communion is contrary to the broad spirit of the Gospel, and directly at war with the glorious liberty of the age in which we live. 209 -,   210       THE NEW CHURCH. K'Now, whilo the church does not enforce the law at the table to-day; still, multitudes of true disciples of Christ, believing that immersion only is baptism, are joining Pedo-baptist Churchlles; unwilling to enter a church which, if it insists upon its law (as they suppose it does) will exclude their friends and kindred from the table of the Lord. The Baptist Church is equally guilty, if it violates a law which it knows and declares to be binding, as if it enforced a law which it knew and declared to be wrong. Tle law of the Baptist B Caurc f orbids an nmbap- tized discip2e a seat at the Lord's table, and there is no respect of persons; yet I shocked the liberal sense of our own church by sending- Deacon Saybrook from the Supper; and men of strong Baptist faith told me, that it was an act of violence calculated to injure the church. But what could I do I I asked. Why, said the brother, you need not have noticed him; you could have left the responsibility with the good old man. But, I asked, had I a right, as the acting head of the church, to wink at a violation of -Baptist law?. Am I not forced to send my own wife away on ordinance day? If this law is right, enforce itO! If it is wrong, abolish it/  As Deacon RIob- erts used to say, there you have it f Let ]inisters be men! "Brother Hart's argument," continued ]Mr. Burden, 'i was unanswerable, on that day ofjhis trial." "Who will go with you?" 'asked Mrs. Burden. "I do not know;" he replied; "I do not know! If I go alone, I go! - This I know, that the great heart of t7e Baptist Church is beating strong to-day with this Gospct liberty.

Yes, my dear, an offensive statute, which is broken in almost every Baptist Church in the lan'd, on every communion season, and- which is repulsive to thousands upon thousands of noble-hearted Baptists in pulpit and pew, shall some early day find a grave with the bigotry and intolerance of a past age. Wherever I find the Lord's table, I find my table, for I am the Lord's--'bought with a price.' And this, my blood- bought right, is the-equal right of every honest -disciple; the God-given privilege of every soul in Christ Jesus; a right which man can neither give nor- tak away, Let a man answer to his God. '; To-morrow night," said Mr. Burden, "I shall' state mny views briefly to the church, and await their action." "Expulsion I " said Mrs. Burden, "Doubtless I " he replied. "They can do no less. I shall then put a notice in the Visitor, calling a meeting of such persons as desire to unite in forming a church upon my new plan." At the appointed time, the meeting was duly organ- ized; the Pastor in the chair. After prayer, by Deacon Winston, Elder Burden, with a brief preliminary address, respectfully tendered his resignation as Pastor of the Evansdale Baptist Church. He told the church that it had always seemed to him a strange inconsistency, that we should brother a man of another church anywhere and everywhere, in all the wide field of Gospel labor and holy fellowship, and then shut the door of Christ's banq'uet- ing house against him; to anticipate with joy the meAt- ing of dear friends and kindred at the perfect feast Min heaven, and yet refuse them a seat at the imperfect feast   212       THE NEW CHURCHO.  on earth. He further declared that he could find no "thus saith the Lord " for this professed law of the church, but- only the Papal sign of a thus saith the preacher; And hus sait th the churc&h; which he thought, should not bind the conscience and govern the action of the Bible-loving Baptist. He concluded, by declaring his unshaken attachment to the great and glorious doctrines of the Baptist denomination, and his love and veneration for the brethren and fathers of the church; while, at the same time, he could extend a full Gospel welcome and fellowship to all men everywhere, who "love our- Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in sincerity and in truth." He said, that in ninety-nine cases in a hundred, when he had questioned his brethren of the Baptist pulpit and brought them to the point, he found that they stood pre- cisely upon the same ground with himself, with the sin- gle exception thatt they hesitated to avow their convic- tion. He said, that recently, at a meeting of Baptist ministers in one of the largest cities in the land, when almost if not every pulpit was represented, each man was asked, are you open communion? answer, "No!  If a man is at the Lord's table in your church, and you are ignorant whether or no he is baptized, will you examine him before you will let him cat? answer, "No i" If you lknow that he is unbaptized, will you send him away from the table? answer, "No!" But is this -logi- cal?"Logic to the dogs," answered one of the strongest of the company. Will you instruct yout deacon to with- hold the plate and cup from him?"No!  "Let him eat, and leave the matter with his own con- science! This," said Mr. Burden, "is the spirit of the Baptist pulpit to-day, and to this march and music of Gospel liberty beats the great heart of the Baptist   THE NEW -CHURCH.      213 Church. On this platform I stand. Let the saint eat at the table of the Lord, though perchance he may not have passed through the watery door. Yes, let him feed at the table of his Lord. It is not my prerogative to sit in judgment upon his conscience, but it is my privilege to meet him at some early period, and endeavor to show 'him the duty of being baptized even as his Master, whose- death he has celebrated, was baptized in Jordan." Mr. Burden continued, "I have no thought of leaving the "glorious Baptist Church. I have no war with my brethren. I shall preach as I ever have preached, Repentance, Faith and Baptism. I shall preach Jordan in all its length, breadth and depth, and show that the true way to the visible church of Christ, is through' the sacred river. Dut I will brother all who loveo Jesus. I will woork with them-pray with them-sing with them --eat with them-quite regardless of the cheap anath- emas of some self-appointed judge in press or pulpit; who shall assume to give laws to my conscience, and govern my conduct. I will not receive a man to my house as my near and dear kindred-extend to him the hospitalities of my dwelling in bed-room, parlor and -sitting-room, and then when the bell sounds a call to the supper-room, turn him into the street.. "I am one of the Lord's ' river-men,' but if one of my brothers from the neighboring hill shall happen at my house at supper time, it shall be his own fault if he goes away without a meal, and he need not thank me for it either, for the Lord of the manor gives to the table both food and law iYes, brethren; and if I should find myself near my brother's house, and the table-my Lordl's table was spread, I would certainly satisfy my hunger there.' At the close of his' remarks, Mr. Burden tendered his   214       THE .KEW' CHUnCn. resignation as Pastor and member of the Evansdale Baptist Church; and leaving the chair, Deacon Ward took his place. Tile resignation of Mr. Burden was accepted by a unanimous vote. Deacon- Winston then offered the following resolution: "Resolved, that the Evansdale Baptist Church does, hereby withdraw the hand of church fellowship from Elder Burden, because of his heretical views touching the ordinance of the Lord's Supper." This resolution of excommunication was quickly seconded by Deacon Raymond, and declared by the Moderator to be carried; a few hands being raised in its favor and none in opposition. The Evansdale Baptist Church, at a subsequent meet- ing, extended a call to Elder Hartley, author of the " cry aloud and trumpet sermon," who immediately accepted, and at an early day entered upon his labors, in his new but long-coveted field. A-goodly company responded to the call published by Mr. Burden. The meeting was called to order by the Elder, who had talken the chair, and Deacon Samuels was asked to open the service with prayer. In the sup- plication, the venerable man earnestly implored the blessing of the great Head of the church upon the late Pastor of the Evansdale Church, and asked divine guidance and direction in the important interests about to be presented to the assembly. The Second Baptist Church was organized. Elder Burden was chosen Pastor. Brethren Samuels, Ward Sr., and Hart, were elected Deacons, and young brother Ward, was elected Clerk., A goodly -number. d!ed the Articles of Faith and   THE NEW CHURCEOH.      215 Covenant, and the succeeding Sabbath was fixed as the day for the opening service, and the administration of the Lord's Supper. The next Sabbath, at the close of the sermon by the Pastor, the Communion was observed. A great company was at the table, and it was indeed a season of sacred joy. As the cup was passed, the Pastor, with tender emphasis repeated the words, "Drink ye all of it." And they all drank of it-all who loved Jesus. Mrs. Burden, Mrs. Hart, and her mother, Mrs. Roberts, sat in the same seat at the table. - As Deacon Hart passed the bread and afterward the wine to the occupants of that pew, the scene was too much for his full heart. I The memory of the communion in Brooklyn, and the subsequent excom- munication came to his mind, and giving the ciup to the Pastor's wife, he baried his face in his handkerchief, and wept like a child. To cry without grief, and to laugh without mirth, is the highest ecstacy of the soul'! ' Mrs. Burden passed the cup to Ellen, and the daughter gave it to her mother. As the Deacon again received the cup, he left the little company bowed in tears, like blossoms in a garden bent to the earth in a summer shower. Brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, parents and children, long separatedl by doctrinal divisions, were there that day in the close communion of Calvary and the Cross. "That they all may be one!"Deacon Roberts' mountain vision was fulfilled in the glorious reality of that heavenly hour.' Anla to complete the scene, there rat daar old Deacon Saybrook, a welcome guest, feasting as tho table of his Lord.
