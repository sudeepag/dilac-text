Indeed, the Jehu whose b ony team tugged us up the mountain re- marked confidentially to his brother-driver, while he held the water-pail under the " nigh " horse's nose: "I say, Bill, I've got the happy family this time!" We have always had especial delight in tripping, not "the light fantastic "-though that is 'an enjoyment. undespisable when one has youth and superabundant jollity-but travelling up and down our wonderful country, seeing its sights, examining its marvels. - :: Old Miss Petingill knows" all' about the Roaring River folks, and everybody else in1 the countyfor that  matter;" and she said to OCaptain Slocum:  ' I vum!

She dropped her chin so as to look over her silver- rimmed' spectacles at the little humpbacked cripple sitting in his small rocking-chair, reading "Water Babies,e who sedately replied: - ( There are no such places as, those in the world, so they can't go to them,' and returned to the perusal of his ab6rbing voliume. "Well, I declare for't!" said the ancient tailoress (she was making garments for Mrs. Slocum's children). "C(-te ;ain't he a . Then she brushed the threads off her silken gown.

I once heard of a lady who went to Paris before she had visited Washington, and ascended an Alp before she: had seen- Niagara I shouldn't like to do that. I  should hate to have to answer "I don't know " to ques- tions about our wonders. The above-mentioned lady :, -informed her friends that she was able to speak per- fet French before she had been abroad a month; and, being asked where she lived in Paris, replied:  - Ruey Sainty-Perey." Oh, yes! we picnicked on Lake George; we bathed in its limpid waters; we cracked jokes and laughed :- . hearty. laughs, away up -among its echoing hills; we : 'did the stately at Saratoga, hopped at the hops, dressed -: -  f:or the springs, went round inthe little rail-car, drove out to the lake, partyok delicately of the fitied potatoes ,: ,                  ' *-     , -   HOW I FELL INTO THE .KATERS'Ri.     13 they sell instead of pop-corns,-:all done up in dainty cornucopias; and we saw a horse-race-at least, we saw. some horses start a good -many times; but they didn't go far, because a little bell kept ringing, and then they all went back again, and a red-nosed man, who wore a white hat with a weed on it, who would lean against the carriage and talk to, me--I suppose because I was the most affable of the party; I'ranever afraid of losing caste by answering people who speak to me-told me the race was a packed thing; and, as we were heartily tired of being packed in the hot car--  riage, and eating dirt, we packed off to- the hotel. I lost my little gold sea-shell porte-monnaie that day. I suppose I must have dropped it when I stood up to look at the horses. Peace Pelican said my red-nosed acquaintance stole it. Peradventure he did. We went to the sea-side. All really genteel people ' go to the sea-side. They must do it, even at the great- -, est discomfort to themselves and children, especially the children. Aihd that reminds me of alittle Fifth avenue hot-house plant, all frizzes and fluting, who came down -to what Pauline Bradshaw would call "Scratchem's Head," while we were there.   The    - house being full of guests, she was taken up to the( low garret, where the bare. beams and smokyrafters  bore the stains and soil of untold years, and the flies who had walked into the parlor were hopelessly :buzz- ing and knoeling abotit in search of the winding stair, which they ne'er went down again.      : Mammal oh/mamma!" said: the little girl, this is the bad place where the devil puts the naughty peo- -  - f, ,.f 4 (I}   "  HOW I FELL INTO TEE     UKTERSITt. pie who steal sugar! Come out quickly, dear mamma, before he sees us and jams the door!" She spoke in an ffrighted whisper, clinging desper- ately to her mother's skirts, and, of course, she was in a frame of mind richly to enjoy er quarters. We were a choice party. In the first place, we were nine-an excellent number. It fills a stage-coach, it packs a skiff, it commands respect, and secures choice :apartments and elaborate attentions, especially if your we wear handsome clothes and toss mIoney about lavrc ishy. The elements of our party were rare, and, conmwin- gled, made a most desirable combination. We had a perfect gem of a Howadji. He had lived on Mount Lebanon, rocked in earthquakes, scorched on deserts, and cooled himself on the frozen steppes of Siberia. His dreamy eyes got dreamier while he painted his charming word-pictui-es, and his graphic tales of Orien- tal life beguiled for us many twilight hours of linger- ing coaching among the mountains. I am convinced that the horses always knew when our Howadji talked; at--any rate, the divers listened with charmed ears-- which amounted to the same rate of speed, or rather of slowness. We had a lawyer, whllo advised his would-be clients to forgive each others trespasses; an author without vanity, and two beautiful girls who didn't in the least care for lovers, and never-in the wide world meant to get married. There were also two youngAmerican gentlemen, of the sort known as successful people, who had\ the Midas-touch, or, rather, the blessing which- ,  a  h  ia-oihc   HOW I FELL INTO THE   KA UTERStT.   15 maketh rich; no drones in this great hive we call the world, but real live workers; not estated elder sons, carrying off unearned riches and titles from  their unlucky brothers, but active-brained, muscular-armed youth equal to any enterprise, from its incipient plan to its glorious completion. Thank Godj girls, for American fathers and brothers and husbands! Our two "Yankees" were as tall as Kentuckians. The elder of them was junior partner of the Gonecus- set Manufacturing Company, John Hauxhurst by name, and he was full of life and health and good sense and fun. He promoted-the frolics, engineered the party, and paid the bills, being tranquilly aided and abetted in his multiform occupations by his dear friend Philip Penhurst, athinking, quiet man, who, if he laughed less than jolly Jolnny, and joked never, always experienced the intensest delight in his fellow- giant's pranks, and the general well-to-do-ness of our party. I think, staid and grave as Mr. Penhurst habit- ually was, I am safe in asserting that he took unbound- ed pride and satisfaction in our young ladies. Perhaps I may go farther, and mention his admiration for one in particular-pretty Annie Tuftii-who frequently fell to his escortage, and who seemed never tired of sitting about in nice places under trees, beside spark- ling water-brooks, listening to his words of'wisdom,  and looking at him. But the enduring charm of our party was the thor- ongh-going mutual-admiration-society-ness of the whole thing. Everybody was charmed to do precisely what everybody else proposed; everybody laughed "con-   sumedly" at everybody else's jokes. We believed implicitly and sincerely in each other. We had rubbed off all the rough edges, and gotten complete assimila- tion, through many trials in sunshine and in shade, and felt secure and restful assurance that there had never been, and could never be, so nice a party as ours.   Oh golden hour! oh, glorious prime, Rich affluence of love and time- when, when will ye return to us  Echo answers, "Really, I don't know." Ah, me I I fear it only remains for some of us to slide gracefully backward among the has-beens. By earnest grapplings with the fleshwe may come, in ful- ness of years, to bear our fifty-tude with fortitude. The lumbering old stage was heavy. Our steeds were not horses of pedigree, and Jehu clucked and chirruped in vain. They couldn't and they wouldn't pull any more; so they stopped, like the discontented pendulum. "Look a' here, Square," called out the driver over his shoulder to John Hauxhurst, who, with Phil, was airily perched amongst the luggage on the top of the vehicle, "these hosses are so pesky beat out, that I rather allow you men-folks 'll hef to hoof it a spell!" "Ah!" answered Johnny, "have we, then, come to the foot of the Hill Difficulty, at the bottom of which there gusheth a spring? Truly, there be thettwo rohds which might be Danger and Destruction; but, though our chosen path is steep and high, so that one might well fall from running to going, and from going to   HOW t IFELL INTO THE KA UTERISTrL.  17  - clambering upon hands and knees, because of the steepness of the place, I see not, midway to the top, the pleasant arbor for the refreshment of weary travel- lers, spoken of in the book."  "Guide-book, sir? Well, I can tell you this part of-the mounting is called Sacrider's Cutoff; and the arbors are all on top. This is a tugging place for teams; they are drefful apt to get sot, and we eaccalate to hev our masculine passengers make use of shanks'  horses, because it's all we can do to tote up the women."  "Even so," replied Johnny, easily, swinging his long legs off the coach and shaking himself into shape; "the quality of mercy is not strained in me." "And you see how he droppeth as the gentle rain of heaven upon the place beneath," said Peace Pelican,  laughing, and pointing her finger at the young man as she finished his quotation. The two gentlemen had been squeezing themelves  into small compass to make room f6r Peace and Annie, who declared that-" they enjoyed the views so much,  the fresh mountain air was so delightful, they always . did love riding on the top of a stage-coach; it was the very cream of the journey." But now I observed a curious phenomenon. No soonerhad Phil. and Johnny gotten themselves down and into walking order, than  these fickle females were ready to abandon their pleas- . ure so lauded, and showed an eagerness to use their little feet, which were doubtless weary-of their:cramped imprisonment among the trunks and they begged to be taken down. "They were thirsty; they must taste the  water of the chatty little 1brook we could hear laughing /    18  HOW I FELL INTO, THE KAUTERSKIL. to itself on its swiftly-devious errand of gossip with the busy old creek below; and they-did love to walk, ever so much; land, besides, they were so sorry for the poor horses!  Jehu chuckled, and shifted his tobacco to the other cheek as he 'watched them  tripping away, their dresses tucked up just enough to show off their dainty boots. "Human natur!" said he. They proved themselves good walkers, though; for, while we oldsters were stih plodding -upward in the creaking, grumbling old coach, they had reached the -Mountain House, and were looking down upon us from its broad veranda, as fresh and sweet as primroses, when we arrived. They benevolently encouraged us, and waved their handkerchiefs, and made quite a little reception as. we slowly toiled into sight, and were all impatience for us to hasten and get the effect of the swiftly-dipping sun upon the valley. -That glorious view!- I wonder if the round earth spreads its equal? The band were' executing sundry snorts and squeals called "tuning," preparatory to a grand show-off, and a sort of pibroch of invitation to the hop in the even- ing. Johnny Hauxhurst, who had been watching in great amusement the elaborate manceuvres of the fat fellow who had charge of the trombone, or some kin- dred instrument with a mouth like a funnel, was seized with a sudden whim, which he hastened to execute. He soaked a newspaper in a neighboring ice-pitcher, and plumped it slyly and softly down the orifice, her-  metically sealing it fast and close, just as the per- ,   ,  ' HOW I lFELL INTO THE KAUTERSKIL.    19 former had wiped his face and shipped a good breath for his first blow-out. He had got a solo, and felt commendable pride in it. The band struck up with a flourish, and stopped dead in the right place-but no trombone 1 "Apoo-apoo "   Not a sound! Showy prepara- tions-fingers all in a line, beating the keys, but no solo. He concentrated his energies upon his wind, put his whole mind to his work, and his cheeks puffed out like the fat little breezes in the old pictures, or a cherub on a tombstone. He got red in the face; he got- purple, and hiseyes rolled in fine frienzy upon the bystanders. - That's the style, by thunder!" remarked an aggra- vating small boy who was watching him, with his legs wide apart and his hands crammed down his ttrousers' pockets. "Now, then, old bust-your-biler, why don't you toot up?                 . ",Blame my windmill, that's just what I want-to know!"' muttered the nonplussed musician, lowering ' his funnel and peering into it with one eye shut. "What the dickens!" he added, drawing forth the half-pulpy mass, and dropping it in a limp dab at his feet, upon which his eyes fastened in whimsical bewil-' derment. "You be blowed!" "Oh, 'come now-that won't do!" ;aid the aggra- vating boy. "You know it wouzldint be blowed!  A peal of merry laughter caused Fatty to raise his eyes to our party on the veranda" above him, who were hugely enjoying the fin, enlivened; by the antic wrath  of the band-leader, who was putting himself through a - :; ' "  '  O  " -  -^  -  '  ' . ,   20  HOW I -:PELL INTO THE KAUTERSEIL." regular course of free gymnastics, ornameited with spluttering maledictions. The mad-cap girls eagerly pointed out Johnny as the guilty joker,- and unani- mously resisted the retiring modesty which suddenly enveloped him as a garment, and succeeded in pushing him into the front row he was so eminently qualified to fill. The much-put-upon trombonist looked from one to the other,'and his wrath evidently waxed hotter through the set grin on his greasy face, and he dropped with a clang the horn of discord, and spat upon his hanlds preparatory to his scaling of the- gallery, that he might- taste the sweets of revenge upon his easy-going tormentor. -H is fellow-banditti divided into factions; one boosted and set him on, and the others clutched at his heels, aid we were mighty near having what sport- ing men call a " mill," when our Johnny poured out good-natured words of apology and fun, which molli- fied Fatty as ointment, and he took up his trombone and blew such a blast as caused our ears to tingle; and he found no fault, though he was again obliged to remove a troublesome obstruction, which took the form of a jolly bank-note; and he was still bxecuting bows like a Chinese mandarin, when we retired to dress for dinner. - The next-morning the young element enthusiastically arose from their beds, in the gray dawn, to see the sun- rise. An elaborately gotten-up young "swell" was there before them, leaning with studied nonchalance against a pillar, playing with his little -cane, as he should say, "Oh, yes; I'm going through it, but I I . know beforehand it won'fpay." :f  ,      A;::1   BHOR W i EL I NTO ITHfE UKATERSRTR.   ,. 21" "With quickened step, brown night retires, Young day pours in apace, On walks the sun, and broadens by degrees": The bursting radiance glorified the world..' The dis- tant:mountain-tops kindled and glowed beneathit, and -then the full-orbed splendor mounted and flamed and, expanded, and the messenger-beams kissed their eyes and played with their hair, and they veiled their ftces  like Moses in the mount.  "Ah!" exclaimed Peace Pelican, quietly retiring from the intensity of Phoebus' salutation, "it is ..no marvel that the Persians worship the sun. I feel moved to kneel in humble adoration."  The travelled young man languidly studied her un- conscious face, and then he turned on his heel.  "Ah, ma foi! it's a bore, a' nuisance, tis sort of a one-horse sunrise! - Provincial, very I When I was in Europe with, a party, I went up the Alps, and- it was  glorious! But this--aw!"   And, with an elegant   - gesture of foreign disgust, the youtl, having finished his little utterance,- immediately betook himself to his dainty slumbers. Of course, the merry maidens were intensely tickled with this 'episode, and related':it in  high glee attthe breakfast, and it furnished the text for many a sally afterward. "Who is for to see the tumble of Die Kauterskl0"? exclaimed our Howadji, who, fine English Claibholar as he was, could never teach his tongue absolkte exactness among our bewildering synonyms. He had hid hands  full of mosses, lichens, snail-shells, and other wild- wood treasures. He had been half way up the moun-   ' *'.  -   .

"Ja, Fraumn7mmner, the vehicle is at the door, and there sit within it already a couple of vara great Cuban dames, not to mention a youth who speaks much of some travels he has made in Eurdpe.'? "Is he clothed all in brown, Professor Groenveldt?" questioned Peace Pelican. "Ja, leetle burrd, he istruly the color of a dead leaf in his apparel, like one of my beetles " (exhibiting two enormous specimens of coleoptera he had captured in his ramble). "I am reminded of the tale my old nurse was used to tell me, of the brown man on a -brown horse, and his brown dog, who beguiled little Princess Brenhilda, and bore her away to the cave of the dead- folks." "That's so," said Phil Penhurst. "I remember that story; and they lived on poisons. This fellows name is Brown, too. I read it in the book this morning- Cymbalinus Adolphus Brown." "Why, that must be Cabby!" said John. "'And pray who is Cabby, Mr. Hauxhurst?" asked Peace. "Well, Miss Peace, Cabby is this Mr. Brown. Chandy Goldsmith gave him the name C. A. B., and the boys teazed his wits wild about it. He is an exquisite, first cousin to the doubled-rose-leaf chap. Captainm Slocum, the treasurer of the Gonecussets, is his uncle. He tried his hand among our books, three   - OW I FELL INTO THE KAIZrTERSKTr.  23 or four years ago, where he was about as useful a6 a ' hopper-grass in a life-boat."        -    : "I am glad he is going to the fall with us; I like doubled-rose-leaf chaps," said Peace, provokingly. "You shall enter Cabby on my list of friends this very day. 'Present him-to me the instant I am placed." "I shall do'nothing of the sort, Miss Peace. Don't - think it! You will get no help from me to tantal'ze that poor fool." ' Pshaw, Mr. Hauxhurst I never hurt anybody. I only have a little fun sometimes," said Peace, redden-  ing up.  "Some things are of that nature as to make One's fancy chuckle, while his heart doth ache," replied John, rising from the table..        . i The travelled young personp did Peace and Annie the honor to level his glass at their rosy faces- when they entered the buss, but he dropped it with languid disappointment. They evidently were not up to what he saw in Europe when he travelled with a party. John Hauxhurst, who was last in, picked up an obtru- sive cane over which he had stumbled, and, as Mr. Brown was the only male stranger present, he extended  it to him, and civilly offered his hand. "How de do " said he. "So your foot is on your native heath once more ' Up went Cabby's eye-glass, and it was a couple of seconds making the journey over Johnny's vast person.  , Ahy, ma foi / I said he, "le gros forgeron, n'est-ce as --too much honor-excuse me, really"I   And   -; \   a  \ , ,'-*   24 -   UEOW I 'PELL INTO- THVE KA TEARQ'TT,.

I assure you, I have not been so long at boarding-school and yet need instruction upon the importance wealth can confer. Am I not the daughter of a great liquor- dealer?" replied Peace, a little bitterly. "There is a slight mistake in the rendering of Solomon's wisdom. It should read,' With all thy getting, get money.' No matter through what filthy or unholy channel--steal slaves, sell orphans, vend the poison which kills both soul and body-only, be sure to get, money."s  She turned her face from the young man, and gazed obstinately out of the window, fighting with her emo- tions; and Mr. Hauxhnrst, noting her eyes, and "her cheeks so crimson-hued," "As if lilies were imbrued with drops of blood," fell to wondering, insomuch that he quite forgot him- self, and completed the journey in a brown study.

HOW Is FELL INTO THE     UTERSKIL. 27 Our IIowadji instantly proffered to the bereft his huge scarlet bandana flaming with yellow spots; 'and pretty Annie Tuftii, with most friendly zeal, offered to tie it over his ambrosial curls. But no; Mr. Penhurst would be a party to no such mis-spence of head-gear. He wasn't going to leave his spic and span new beaver in that old cave of the winds for a bat's nest; he would at once descend and fetch it thence. Yea, verily, he would not be done out of it by the breeziest wind that ever blew. Not Euroclydon himself should send him bareheaded home. And down he did go, his eyes intents and his face quiet and sedate, disdainful of red clay and dripping rocks, in spite of Annie's paleness and murmured expostulations.  I noticed that the yyoung maid who didn't in the least care for lovers, and meant never in the wide world to get married, trem- bled, and watched anxiously the agile motions of the youth, swinging himself from cliff to cliff and from boulder to boulder, and she got white and whiter when he disappeared beneath the dashing spray' We -were  laughing merrily over the catastrophe, when Annie exclaimed under her breath, with a soft little sigh of relief: "Oh, there he is" -  I don't pretend to Understand why she should have been so ridiculously anxious, or have colored like ' The hopeful bud of a ruddy rose  when he joined her, displaying his well-earned trophy.

The Howadji started off, a solitary hunter in the dim wood for -a rare kind of golden beetle. The author perched himself upon a crag, and took out his note- book.- The lawyer screwed together his silver flute and began to worry the lazy echoes. The Cuban ladies, accompanied by Cabby, withdrew in an exclusive group. The young element sauntered down the bank of the sociable Kauterskil to hear its little singing, or frolic among themselves. Now, I, being left to my own devices, proceeded to achieve greatness, then and there. I espied a still basin, far down amidst the silent rocks, and, after a deal of slipping, creeping, and scrambling, 1 managed to seat myself upon a shelf out of the water, "in maiden meditation, fancy free."  My rock proved rathera slippery tenure; but, by digging my .heels into a crevice, I managed to stay put, and in a pleas- ing state of uncertainty as to the future, because I might atany unguarded instant glide down like an- ;r    other Undinoe beneath the black water. My cream- ;;.    cakes were splendid, my caromels crisp and enjoyable, - . -but they made me thirsty. I improvised a cup of a ':-;:::: - maple-leaf, and reached down to fill it. It was a false move. I began to slide. I caught at a sapling; it gave way my ln my tch-treacherous thing!--and, with a scramble and splash, I plunged into four feet of water. I struggled and clawed about the pool, but could not rise. I was wedged between the rocks as though I had sprung up there, a new species of aquatic plant; and I know how the married mouse felt who "Iived in water up to hlr chin, and wished she was a   : HOW I FELL INTO t'WS .KAUTSV;K,.   29 maid agin."  My skin rose into what is fami-liarly called "goose-pimples," and I had unpleasant mental exercises upon the probable contiguity of water-snakes, black turtles, and bad-tempered efts, who might resent my. troubling their pool. Despairing, at last, of achieving my freedom by unassisted endeavor, H lifted up my voice and screamed. I had no idea of the extent of the power I possessed to make an outlandish v noise.' .The echoes were also astonished, and projected remarks about it amongst themselves. Johnny Hauxhurst came crashing through the bush- ' es, followed by the whole party, the Cuban dames and travelled young person bringing up the rear; and- he and Phil finally succeeded in dragging me on to dry land, and the three exquisites disgustedly retreated from my dripping neighborhood. .Well, well I what a pitiable object I looked, to be sure I My-elegant dress of smart shepherd's plaid was damaged in its back-, breadths by thy embraces of the. envious rocks, and bedaubed with samples of the mud and mulch from the depths. My jaunty hat with its pink ribbons, upon, whose natty becominghess I had prided myself, was drenched and spoiled, and hung over my face all limp and forlorn; and my parasol of the ivory handle had sunk to rise no more. I crept up the long flight of steps amid a chorus of remarks, exclamations, and con- dolences, but I answered never a word-like the skip- per of the Hesperus, when "a frozen corpse was he." In the small lodge at the top the ladies resolved them- selves into a -Committee of Ways and Means. They improvised a robing-room in one corner, by holding nup  AO ^  .,  * . .   -e 30: H tOW I .PELL INTO THE -AUTERSKIL. blanket-shawls before me. Annie said I might have her flannel- petticoat, and the Howadji pressed upon me the despised bandana, which they tied over my head, for my teeth rattled like castanets. I found it expe- dient to dispense with certain articles of clothing which are considered indispensable in good society, and I car- ried them home in an uncomfortable bundle. They borrowed some boots of the man who kept the lodge, and a glass of bad whiskey, which scorched me all the way down; and when I ventured to cough and make wry faces, I was cruelly desired by Peace Pelican not to be snippy, and despise the goods lent me by the gods. In fact, Peace was hugely enjoying herself. Phil said I might have the soft hat he had so gallantly rescued from the youthful bats ; and they made a mis- erable mummy of me with their blanket-shawls. I was submissive and cool. Cabby murmured to himself in an evident puzzle for precedents. No young lady had ever tumbled into anything when he travelled in Europe with a party, and then originated a new conun- drum at my expense:  Why is a   like a---- Which Peace luminously solved for him: "Because it is a -. One -of the fat Cubans remarked to the other: If I had done like that, my husband would have called me awkward-and clumsy!"

That evening, as I lay between sleeping and waking, - I heard low conversation on the veranda just outside  my window.  "Tell me, dearest Annie, when shall it be ." '  I knew the voice for Phil's; but the reply was so soft-a whisper, that the two heads must have been very near together to make it available, because I could not catch a word of it. "Thanks, dearest " (this was Phil again).  "I should, of all things, like September" And then I was sure I caught the music of a light kiss. Sud- denly, from an open window above them, a bass voice commenced chanting:          -  "And 'twas John kissed Molly, And Dick kissed Polly, And Humphrey with his flail." The strain had a sudden ending; and the Howadji never knew what became of the pin-speared beetles and lichens he had spread upon the window-ledge to dry. But I knw, because I heard, the whole collec- tion whiz onto the lovers' heads; and I also knew the , despoilers, when I heard Johnny Hauxhurst and that Peace Pelican laughing, and scuttling away.  It was in September, and a very handsome couple they made'; and, even though Phil smiled little, he looked truly satisfied with his pretty wife. And as for Peace and John Hauxhurst,.they assisted right royally, and I almost hoped they twain might one day become one flesh.

The married folks' all paired off to their respective dwellings, and Uncle Alee couldn't bear to think of going solus to his homestead. He had been unhappy towohdbeo     eea  er  on  oadfoi    A cAIGES,  LS EVsTlNg.'     33'  -t there only a few years ago, and, much as he longed to see dear old Craigenfels, he lacked courage to face alone his memories; so he filled up- the place with guests. He had as many kinfolk as Earl Douglas; and his acquaintances were as the sands of the sea-shore for multitude, who knew themselves too well to decline the . genial old fellow's hospitalities.. Sabrina Bradshaw and her cousin Bertha Groenveldt (the Howadji' daugh- ter), Peace Pelican and Susie Jenkins, all school-friends, at Rosenbloom, were pleasantly bestowed in apartments about the tower-room, which a whim of the host's kept f sacred to the use of " the Little Pet," who was now Mrs. Groenveldt. We had a couple of brides, with their complacent husbands, yet in the "footsey-tootsey"' period of mar- ried life; besides a glorious:host of young men and maidens in the juicy circuit, when blood courses freely, and frolics are more than meat and drink, and conge- nial companionship more than fine raiment. - ? Miss Flinor Walsingham had come over from herd  place, " the Quince Bush," on purpose to superintend affairs and matronize the party; -and she was a woman -: of. business, a lady of leisure, a sample of completeness- every way. We were to have a agrand ball before Christmas-week, tableaux, charades, and private theat- ricdls, and other devices afterward, and were gathered in the great drawing-room, talking - up costumes, plays, and so on; and no maple-wood fire ever glinted over brighter faces, for did ever young voices tinkle 'in pleasanter harmony,. Uncle Alec, from his armn-chair so capacious, looked on, and listened and suggested in  -      '  - . i   ! 84 .

Now, this queer creature, so shy, so silent, so swift and successful a hunter in its native India, shunning man, and abiding in the dense, dark jungles, had quite a history of his own, and, when his master left San Christabel, had absolutely refused to be left behind; and though he suffered much from our cold, he persisted in accompanying Uncle Alec in his walks and rides, watching jealously all competitors to his favor. Indeed, he was apt to be a little gruff or so to outside humans. His master assured us that it was only manner in Dholy. It may have been; but he had long, fiery eyes, and sharp teeth like a wolf. There was a great deal of comfort in Uncle Ale; * for, as says Dr. Dryasdust concerning Waverley, "He had a general haleness of appearance, a compass and strength to his voice, steadiness to his step, rotundity to his calf, depth to his hem, and sonorous emphasis to his sneeze, which were all signs of a constitution built for permanence." The young ladies turned their backs most uncivilly : to each other and kept their work hidden in napkins, and it was a  point of honor among athem to look no whither, because they were plying busy fingers on the Christmas gifts; and it was not till the last napkin was folded around its precious contents, and they drew about the tables piled with bits of silk, gay ribbons, and half-dressed dolls, that they felt full freedom to permit their eyes to look-right on and their eyelids straight before them. There was to be a  Christmas-  -   A CRAIG.'SM ELS iVErNI1V.      35  tree at- Patience of Hope "on the 26th, and all these dozens of dolls and things had got to be finished for that occasion; and these girls, who were accustomed to plan and complete enterprises, worked with concentration of purpose. They pressed the young men infto their, service, requiring them to use such talents as God had bestowed. Sam  Slaughton was illuminating Scrip- ture-cards with choicest skill. John Hauxhurstj who, though a busy Gonecusset, cramming his days full of work, found time to be -amoig his friends in- their social evenings, and patiently pursued his fancy trade of doll's shoemaker. Lazy Chandy was making a copy in water-colors of St. Agnes-which Mrs. Jan Vedder wished to have empanelled in the front of the desk- and amusing himself with whimsical arguments, con- futing the orthodox objections Miss Walsingham fired at him. Even the Howadji was at work, and looked serenely complacent among his bits of spar, and moss, and snail-shells, and berries, from which he was fash- ionling a grotto, or, as Chandy said, ("a nest for the Pelican of the wilderness."  Aunt Elinor did the heavy white work needful to perfect trousseaux, inter- spersed with a good deal of advice and instruction. "Philip Penhurst came home on the Sea-Gull. Alec, did you know it?

"No, Chandy," replied the quiet young girl, whose eyes were dropped upon the pompadour jupe she was fashioning from bits of crimson satin in her lap, and whose ears drank every word uttered by the handsome, easy, careless fellow she had worshipped for so many years, ever since they were boy and girl together.

She smiled frankly, as she answered:     s   A CRAIGI^'WELS EVENIN,       37 "Pretty Dolores I /How nice for you to meet her I I suppose she is as ardent a Catholic as ever.

Uncle Alec looked at his self-contained niece, living her own full life, asking little, conferring much fromln the affluent completeness of her full-orbed being, and fell to wondering if there was a mate for her, and what manner of man he might be.

"Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York; don't frown so, Sabrina. You looked not thus when you sat ' on diamond rocks, sleeking thy soft, alluring locks.' You will look smil- ingly, I'll wager, when our Pen makes his first charming bow. You ill become the part of man-hater, though I must fairly warn you that once you begin playing Beatrice to his Benedict you will certainly 'suffer love' for him to finish the comedy; won't she, Uncle Alec?" "I'll bet a hat of it," replied the host laughing. "If I am' set to the task of consoling your friend, who seems to staind for the impersonation of all the virtues in your doting partiality, I shall do my best; I'll rack my brains- for consolations; I'll study up the   E zLIGION GOES IN SILVER SL-  PERI .       - 'Anatomy of Melancholy' and ' Young's Night Thoughts' to feed him on.." "Patience Proddy's widower brought her a copy of  - his late lamented's funeral sermon, as a delicate atten- tion," said Susie slyly. Maybe Mr. Penhurst will have the like about him; at any rate it-would look condoling to inquire for it. We will school our faces to sorrow, and address our eyes to grief."  "That's the wear, Susie with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage."       -         l "Excuse me, (handos, if I remined you that such jesting upon your friend's grief looks unfeeling, and '- is in exceeding bad taste," said Sabrina with disgusted air. "I quite agree with you," chimed in Peace Pelican; "but nobody is safe from Chandos' Goldsmith. The only satisfaction to be had in his society consists in paying him his own coin, and hitting harder than he can."  As the handsome fellow and his host laughed again, Mips Bradshaw felt really, offended, -and she played with her flower-vase, and spoke no more during break-  - fast. After that meal was finished, Uncle- Alec beckoned Chandy and Miss Walsingham   into the library for a confidential session.

"There goes a good little girl, Chandy.'  , Bertha Groenveldt was passing the window with a couple of white pigeons on her shoulder, to whom she was talking; others were wheeling about her, and still others running before her on the ground, "She looks like Hilda among her doves, don't she?. " "Hilda couldn't hold a candle to our good Bertha," replied Chandos, "and that fleecy cloud of azure be- comes her rarely. I wonder if it would not do in my Ruth. It is not very inlike the head-gear of the females of Moab, who wore veils and the like."

Sam and Iauxhurst worked like hero's under Jan Vedder's direction, whom Chandy did not forget to send to the rescue; and mischief-loving Peace got her kissing-corner, though they were forced to accept trailing-ferns and Judas-berries for holly and misletoe, and she rather enjoyed the substitution, as being entirely home-made and original. Mr. Craigenfels could not feel quite satisfied to have a party without children; so he ordered Zephyr saddled, and rode down to consult Pauline Bradshaw about the little guests. She clapped her hands gleefully. " Oh,what a darling old uncle! Yes, Gracie and me and Dick will all come-isn't it fun?" ( BUt that will not be enough-I must have a room full   "MUst you?

Pauline paused quite out of breath, and Uncle Alec looked at her with a good deal of feeling in his face. "You heartily enjoy Bid's society, don't you?

' "No, I didn't," replied Pauline disheartened; " she always looks as cle as as me, and she don't tear her - dr'esses half so much--and her face is as fresh; well, never mind, Uncle Alec, I've got loads of, things.

He confided to her Pauline's list of guests, and announced his intention to make Bridget Flannigan-one of them. Mrs. Bradshaw shook her head.  I'm afraid it won't do, Alee; I never talk caste to mty cfildren; those society distinctions dawn upon themn quite soon enough; the child is healthy, vigorous, and cheerful, and thoroughly clean in spirit and person, and I do not in the least object to her- companionship for my daughter; she may get some good, and I believe my darling is too carefully nurtured to get any harm; but other people differ from'me, and I fear that Biddy may come to grief. I'd almost like to see her there too. What an enchanted dream such an evening would  be to her!" "My little golden-haired Alice keeps- her pretty ro- mance as she does her beauty," said Mr. Craigenfels, caressingly. "-You shall see her.

He walked to the door, then came slowly back. "Do you know --did you ever hear, what became of--"  "Belle Brandon?" said Mrs. Bradshaw, coming to his assistance. "Oh yes. Sabrina met her last winter in New York at a party, gorgeously dressed, and she had the abominable impudence to .run up with both hands out, and she inquired after you-called you the '-dear old gentleman,' and sent- her best love, and laughed and tossed her curls, and exhibited her dim- ples. Sabrina was so angry."  "Poor child! O Lord, 'Old gentleman!?' ejacu- lated Uncle Alec. "Well, good-by."  It may be supposed that Miss Bradshaw thought much of the coming' guest. His name was so con- stantly in her ears, more especially as, after lunch, Peace Pelican, who had had an interview with Uncle Alec, brought her sewing, and established herself in the easy chair, and while she worked the wings of her butterfly, made it a point to talk of Mr. Penhurst-his sayings and doings, the Kauterskil trip; and Aunt El- inor; who was also busy with the fag-ends of Christmas  .

I have been out on the river with the doctor, and dined at Brook- sideo; she will not, come up this evening; her little girl is ailing. I tried my level-best to bring Otho  away, but it was wasted sweetness.

Her sudden whirl loosened the Berlin wrap she had held close gathered about her throat while she talked with the young man, andit swept off, and dropped in a soft, fleecy pile upon the floor, displaying her evening dress - of violet tulle; ;* her white shoulders and perfect arms without an orna- ment. The spirit and exquisite color of her clear-cut face; the proud, yet delicately feminine pose of her handsome head, crowned with richly braided hair, and the undulating, supple motion with which she turned to regain her lost property, filled Sam's artist soul with ineffable delight; yet he stood stock still, while she stooped, and lifted the yielding fabric, and tossing it over her arm, stepped airily away, and his face blanched with sudden paleness, though he lightly hummed the old couplet, "What care I how fair she be, If she be not fair for me?" He had tried the rhyme four years agone,with this girl glorified in his youthful fancy, and he had not yet gotten it by heart, and the result of the meeting in the hall was, that Sam was a little sober-visaged and Sa- brina Bradshaw wore no flowers to Uncle Alec's party. b    rdhwwr     o w   SAM'S VIOLET POSY.        v 57  She also felt rather dissatisfied with herself.

When the steaming horses stopped before its hand- some entrance, the Craigenfels was all ablaze with lights, and many figures were moving to and fro in the upper rooms; the sound of a fiddle in the distant interior, and occasional drum-tap, announced the arri- val of the band. Miss Walsingham, stately in black velvet and diamonds, met them at the door. . She took Penhurst into her stout arms, where she held him a baby (she herself a slender beauty then) with motherly fondness. "Dear Pen,'" said she, "-what a monster you've grown!"         - a"A hungry monster to-night, auntie.

"And as for care, he got hung for murder, you know, and served hm right." "Well, good boys," said Miss Walsingham, dusting her hands, "don't chatter; the rooms are half full already." I'd put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes to please you, dear, handsome auntie," said Phil. "You might count on me to buckle it for you," ,added Chandy. "If you get your supper and dress in twenty, it will suit me infinitely better,'? replied the lady, pushing  them towards the dining-room. Yes, auntie, we'll dress like urchins, with rounds of waxen tapers on ouri heads, and rattles in our hands." "The rattle is in your brain, silly boy; come, be gone!" As Chandos paused, Pen pointed a thumb over his shoulder at him, and confided a bit of information to Miss Walsingham. "One Talkative, the son of Saywell, who dwells in Prating Row." He did not 'realize quite the capital he expected, however, because Chandos had also ready a communi- cation from the same author.

Pen bowed lows-but an absurd fit of coughing nearly choked the host at this juncture, and entirely blotted the lady's name, and forced him to hasten away, leaving the introduction half completed. Sabrina Bradshaw acknowledged the courtesy with lofty politeness, and looked as proud and scornful as Juno when scolded by her lord. Pretty soon John Hauxhurst (who was Deputy Lord of Misrule, our Howadji being seated in state among the magnates) came hurrying up to Chandy; who had joined the group and was busily tilting wits with Peace Pelican. I am so glad you have come; there's any quantity of girls without partners; you must be alert and fill up the sets, but first present me to your friend; of course he dances."

H "Iush, here comes Cabby," replied Chandos; " now, Peace, be. discreet: I am going to present him." Mr. Brown returned the young lady's bow with his glass at his eye- "Ah, yes," said he, when Chandos named Mr. Pen- hurst; I believe I met you at the Mountain House, when I returned from Europe, travelling with a party?." "Possibly, though such a meeting is among my forgotten -pleasures," replied Pen, surveying the ex- quisite with the cool disfavor his type of men is sure  , to meet in the estimate of solid business people, and his mental award to himswas, "not worth the powder and shot to kill him with." "The Kauterskil is a good place to meet nice people, isn't it, sir," said Peace, her eyes dancing. "Will you put away a froward mouth, and perverse lips far from thee," remonstrated Chandos, who saw her getting ready for more remarks. She laughed mis- chievously, and shook herself clear of his saucy grasp, while she listened for Mr. Penhurst's reply. "Yes, I believe it is so reckoned -by those enter-  :, prising ones who are fond of climbing up to look-- down."- Y"You had a delightful trip there, of course," said Sabrina, who instantly felt her speech in bad taste, as reminding him of his loved and lost.        .   " 1 ^ XZ.

"As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood," so appeared Penhurst among the guests. :is mouth, with its dainty mus- tache artistically curled, was good-natured, very decid- edly-jollt; his dress was absolute perfection, from his lavender tie to his patent-leather boots, without any unpleasant sense of newness. And his eyes, very merry and exceedingly blue, laughed as he addressed her. The topic he touched was an odd one. "If ever you have eaten any of Aunt Ellinor's' pot- pies, you can well comprehend my present -state of mind; perfect satisfaction with myself and all the world." Any number of bristles might have been laid be- ,tween Miss Bradshaw's lips when they parted in a burst of exceedingly natural and most musical laugli- ter; and she blushed, too, in a r-ight womanly way, as Mr. Pen went on dropping witty words into her ears. Bright snatches of talk, I am afraid there were ves- tiges of those Americanisms Mr. Lankman dreads so much as " slang," absurd twists of the mother-tongue, humorous misfits of hackneyed quotations, giving the old phrases quite new significance. Sabrina was in- terested and amused in spite of her prejudice, and stood chatting with her partner after the quadrille was finished, when-Aunt Elinor came along, holding Chan- dos by the arm like a refractory child. "But you must," said she; " the poor girl hasn't had a partner to-night, and looks ready to cry." "(I can't help it, auntie," replied dainty, spoilt Chandy. "I won't make a holy show of myself with , 9    MR:. PENHURSTS FIEST APPEARANCE.    69 that scraggy animal, all neck and arms; she'd hop and frisk like a kangaroo, gallop like an ostrich; such a mate to dance withal for a man of my multitudinous good graces, by Heaven! I'll steal away."  "Now, Chandos, do be obliging and considerate-and self-denying once in your life, just for the luxury of the novel sensation; come."  "Yes, dear auntie, what handsome hands you have; ask me anything in reason and you shall find me your most devoted; but candidly, I'd rather eat thistles  with a jackass than stand up beside an ugly woman. It grates, you know, upon my feelings, sets my teeth on edge, and that sort of tl]ing-and there's Bertha' looking for me; I'm sorry, but, really--an revoi'. auntie." He shook himself clear of the' lady's grasp, and' sauntered away, drawing at his white gloves and enjoy- ing her very manifest vexation. "Go after him, Miss Walsingham, do; and force him to obey you: he is a contemner of just authority,'; said Peace Pelican, mischievously. "Ah, how truly  : sayeth the poet: 'It is sharper than a serpent's'tooth to have a spanlpless child." " "He is a selfish boy," grumbled Aunt Elinor, ey- ing Sir John's retreating figure with an indignant glance. ' Let me serve you, auntie,? said Pen, much amused; "you mustn't be hard on Chandos; he has an artist's ' eye for beauty, you know."               -  "Humph! I'd rather he had a little decent goodness ^ of heart, and respect for his elders and betters," an, -- : /   70 M- M., PEXNHRST S FIR8T APPEARANCS. swered the lady, still very wroth. "No, no, you shan't stir, Pen," she continued, as he persisted in offering his services (she was looking at Sabrina); "Ill go over and ask Mr. Bowles; he has done nothing but whisper to his wife the whole evening, and it is quite time for -him 'to behave like a gentleman, and remind himself that there are other women in the world beside the one he has picked out for his own having." - Yes, indeed," chimed in Peace; " such snippiness of wedded bless is extremely tiresome Stir him up, I entreat you.     -"Oh, don't, Miss Pelican; give the poor fellow time," replied Pen; " you see his blushing lionors sit too newly on him; a- few months hence he will be wiser; that sort-of lunacy rarely outlasts its moon, you know.' Mr. Penhurst ought to understand whereof he speaks, I am sure," said Peace, her eyes dancing with fun; ought he-not, Miss Walsingham '? That lady bit her lip and frowned at the meddle- some girl, as busily intent on mischief as Puck, the merry elf, and pushed her unceremoniously aside. "You may come, then, if you like, Pen; you always was a good boy. My beauty here will have plenty of partners; there's Sam, who is habitually her humble servant; and look where that ape of a Brown is praric- ing this way; come, let's hasten out of his neighbor- hood.

TI is the daughter of my old friend, and I desire her to have a nice evening. \."  As:Pen stole a look at the superb beauty he was leaving, he was perplexed by the questioning, disap- proving expression of her face, an/d her eyes flashed back his glance, as she seemed working at an inextri- cable problem, and they still followed him when he stood up with the awkward girl with whom he was go- ing though his duty-dance. She noticed his kindness and attentions, and listened to his: cheery voice, in the pauses of the quadrille; and she greatly wondered what manner of man this contradictory person might be, so improperly inconstant, and-yes-so extremely agreeable; carrying about him a nameless charm, which  won irresistibly to friendliness. Sam did not come near her, but sailed about with a tremendous bunch of violets in his button-hole, and carried himself so care- . lessly that she perfectly understood he did not intend to appear crushed by her conduct; and her thoughts flitted from this tried and true old friend to the ac- quaintance of the evening, as she stood leaniag absently a against a pillar, playing with her little- fan of ivory carving. She started, and a inost unnecessary and in- convenient blush flamed up in her cheeks, when Mr. Penhurst returned, looking enjoyably ready to take up their ball-room trifles oi pleasing talk again. "Are you engaged for, the trois temps?" "Sorry-but-yes-however, do not be cast down; there is Virginia Jones over there, who just floaits on air; she will be charmed, and behold our Lord of Mis-  rule ready to present you.", I           :    ;72    MRK.

"I fear you must be a gay deceiver; Miss Jones wasnot "charmed, and you must let me talk with you till you are carried away captive. I wish I could venture to inquire what you were thinlking of-a theme of ab- sorbing interest, I feel sure-to so imprint your counte- nance with its visible signs."' She smiled frankly. "I was trying to solve one of Chandy's riddles. He represented Mr. Penhurst a -   grand, gloomy man, learned in troglodites, given to discourse grave wisdom, and lo! he opened his ball- room speeches with praises of pot-pie. In fact, the character given you seems so singularly inappropriate that I' confess I was thinking about it;" she hesitated, and added,-- as well as some other things." u" '1 owe Chandy one for that, " said Pen, making a grimace at the young fellow, who, though dancing with Bertha Groen-veldt, happened to be intently watching the pair, and who ducked his head into his shoulders like a mud-turtle, and abruptly. wheeled about. "Grand and gloomy, indeed!" added he, bursting with a merry laugh; " what a fellow that Chandy is: he never spares -his best and dearest if he sees a chance of getting a rise out of him." Sabrina wished to intimate to the widower that she considered it but natural for, a person who had suf- :- -fered his deep loss to be gloomy, nay, deeply sad; but ' she could shape the thought- into no words which seemed to fit, the fun-lighted face she studied. And ir:;: ;as Miss 'El nor's praises of poor Annie Tuftii passed through her mind, and this man's deep devotion to   MR. PEXiURUST'S FIRST APPEARANCE.   73 her, she felt new displeasure with his heartless ignor- ing of his brief happiness, and his out-of-sight-out-of- mind putting the dead wife from' his talk, and the chatty waf he had of showing his heartfelt enjoyment 'of the evoning. And she was moreover exceedingly vexed with the measure of commendation she was forced to bestow upon this paragon of inconstancy. As Mr. Pen could not have Sabrina to himself, he did not feel like dancing any more, and strolled into the library, where he came upon Chandos, who tried to slip past him; but he seized his arm, and held him fast. "Come on, old fellow, let's talk; you saw Uncle Alec present me, didn't you? I wish he wouldn't cough and sneeze next time in such a particular place; it was confoundedly awkward; although I felt pretty sure, I couldn't venture to call her anything-Adorable, Di- vine, Angelic, I longed to breathe them all, but it wouldn't do, you know; I have virtuously waited till you could confirm me. It is Sabrina fair, devout, and pure, is it not'?" "Oh   yes, certainly," replied Chandy, uneasily; "I suppose you haven't got so far yet as to confide to her the story of your life-the tale of your sorrows." "Don't be too hard on a fellow,.-Chandos. I gradu- ated from old Yale with moderate honors, and I did amazingly less flirting than most of the fellows. I've made a  prime quality of satinet in my factories, and I've sold a pile of it.

Yes, Chandos, I'll make that beautiful, sensible, witty woman my wife." -"The Silver Lake Goddess? Oh yes, by all means; hanging and wooing go by destiny; and as for the flirting, why should a man whose blood is warm sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster, sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice' by being peevish. But isn't it a pity the beauty has such red hair? Something might be done, perhaps, with balm of Gilead," answered Chandy, greatly relieved by the turn the talk was tak- ing. "Well, Goldsmith, I blush for you; upon my soul I do! Such lack of delicacy in yourexpression! such a, want of discernment in your opinions! Why Miss Brad- shaw's hair is rippling molten gold. Io might be proud of it. And you call yourself an artist."3 "That's so; I own up." Chandy passed his hand over his mouth and caressed his beard. "But she's too tall; you abominate amazons; not your style. Tell me -where is fancy bred-in the heart or in the-lead?'" "Don't, Chandy," whimsically pleaded Pen; "I am as anxious as Dogherry to be written an ass; so don't visit my puppyism on me. Be magnanimous, I entreat; now, say the truth like a man: Do you suppose I could make her love me '") Pen got up and went over and studied himself at- : 0: tentively in the mirror. ' By ,Jupiter! what a great   Mr.' PENVUZBSTSS FIRST APPEAR ANCE.   75 monster of a fellow I am, as Aunt Elinor says. I wonder if Miss Bradshaw fancies large men!" "I don't know, really; but I remember a remark she made once when I went to a barber's with her to get her molten rippling gold dressed: she praised the beauty of the little hairdresser, his regular features, and rosy cheeks." "Rosy cheeks, pshaw I regular features! The very style barbers and pastry-cooks are made of. The hand- somest man I ever saw in my life was a policeman, and there wasn't so much brains in his Apollo's head 'as would serve of cabbage for a caterpillar's breakfast. I despise handsome men; they're always either rogues or fools. Come, do stay down where you belong, instead of hitching up out of sight, can't you," he added, twitching impatiently at his right wristhand, "when you know my great paw is as big as the hand of Prov- idence." "Oh, well, Penhurst, don't get in a fret; who says a whale is a bird a I'm not certain about Sabrina's taste in the size of her admirers, but I know she likes grave, serious men, full of deep wisdom." "Humph, walking cyclopedias-I never could cram for conversation, and I do hate to be bored with rounded periods and made talk; and I don't believe a girl of her sense likes it either, for now I remember she turned up her nose when she repeated your 'remarlr that I discoursed learning. If you meant that as a fa- vor, I am obliged; but I wish in future you wouldn't put yourself out to build me up a reputation." "I didn't, Pen. I merely dropped a few laudatory 4 .                 e   76  MR. PENlHURSS rFIKST APPEARANfE. remarks to pave your way, and you are quite able to sustain me. But look here! you are a very hero in uni- form; we'll have a masquerade fancy dress, and give you an opportunity to shine as a military character-- women dote upon soldiers., "Yes, men with guns and pistols in their looks, and cannon-balls in their conversation!' No sir I'll beat my brains out with a wisp of straw before I try to win a wife with gold lace and epaulettes." "How you do fire up, Pen," said Chandos, who was hugely enjoying himself. "Miss Bradshaw is extremely like other young ladies, and a fellow of your experi- ence with the sex need not fear defeat; she has got' a; head full of crotchets and whims; she went on in high style the other day on what she would have. I'll tell you all about it sometime; I dare say you can fill the bill, and I wish you all success and anything I can do, you know-though stay-how about the seraph .--you had better hear her sing before- you get head over heels." "No, Chandos, it is not needful; her voice is tuneful melody; she must sing: I'd stake my life on it; say you'll stand by me with advice. You and I are dear friends, old boy." "Certainly," replied -Sir John, warmly; " you have my sympathy and support, and if you do win her ' you are the very button on the cap of fortune.' There is Sam Slaughton beckoning me. Sam's a little loud in his flowers to-night, isn't he I've thought that he was rather e2ris in that quarter. I've seen him send-   MR.

" Chandy hastened off humming the measure, and Uncle Alec caught his arm and whispered in his ear,-- "Oh yes, sir," he whispered in return; " the charm works; no need of any love-philter for him. The arro- gant dog told me, coming up, that he wouldn't take a mate who couldn't sing like a seraph. I think I'll have to fix that flint for him; let him simmer a little more first, though."               - "Be careful, Chandos; don't over-do," replied the host, laughing at the young man's account of his re- cent conversation., Mr. Penhurst, tired of stopping alone, strolled toward tlhe ball-room, thinking to get a look at the Silver LaLke Goddess, and perhaps a waltz with her. Passing the little parlor, which was mostly bay-window, he saw it filled with children who were making a terrible noise, and whose attitudes and expressions were anything but. merry or cheerful. They were drawn up in two par-, ties, and a plenty of hard words were flying back and forth, and some of the faces were red with anger, and some pale with fear. It was the Flannigans and anti- Flannigans in battle-array. Pauline and her choicest friends were grouped around the little chubby girl, who was in a hot passion, and whose Irish tongue chat- tered swiftly through her twirling r's, while she man- aged to throw some barbed truths amongst her foes. She was held in fast durance by Clove Starbird and Dick, who resisted all her struggles to break away I  from them, declaring that she should not be driven ou : .- {        A / i                ,  .   78"  MR.

Loraine Pedlow, in a crimson mering, and a face redder than her frock, headed the anti- Flannigans, and encouraged her adherents to taunt and ridicule the poor child, who had come up in a high state of delight, under Patline's protection, after. a thoroughly enjoyed season of robing. Eagerly, not- to say gleefully, assisted by Mrs. Bradshaw, who made a frolic of the occasion, never to be forgotten by her daughter, giving her a lesson of heavenly kindness and swed charity in her zealous manner of granting the generous desire of her big, innocent young heart. It had all gone well enough while Uncle Alec and his sister remained among their small guests, though Biddy heard some slighting remarks and saw some noses ele- vated which would have looked better turned down; she did not mind; she had heard and seen the like be- fore occasionally, and lived through it. She walked noiselessly amidst the delights of the enchanted palace, and Mrs. Bradshaw, while arranging the games, kept an eye upon the child, taking care to secure for her good neighbors of her daughter's kind, and also an- swering the many modest questions she fearlessly asked of Pauline's mamma, but when the grown-up folks went away to look at the dancing, then the trouble reached a crisis. "What, what! quarrelling, little people," exclaimed Pen; " is that your fashion of enjoying a frolic?" ' They are the quarrellers," spoke up pauline; 4 they called her Paddy;" and then she burst into tears at i, thought of the bitter indignities to which she had ex- ppsed her friend, when she meant to make her so happy.

"Bid's'a trump, worth a thousand of such; I wouldn't treat a dog so!" As this horrible taunt had no effect, Mr. Penhurst in- quired into the deeper cause of the feud.  "Prance Fedlow wouldn't kiss Bid in the copen- hagen," sobbed Pauline, " and that Loraine made taces at her. I hate Loraine!" The gentleman fastened a severe glance upon time child pointed out by Pauline as principal offender, who wriggled and grinned beneath his scrutiny, andfinally made out to speak up for herself, feeling that some ac- tion must e talen to divert the scathing eyes, scorching like burning glasses, from her hot face. "She's got no business here; she isn't no lady, no how -she don't wear buttoned boots." "Little Miss, you will come to understand, I hope, that the buttons on your shoes-oh, yes, that's right, stick them out; very fine and genteel, to be sure-but they are of infinitely less consequence -than the paths through which your feet take you;" and, added Pen half to himself, "Poor thing, your mother deserves scolding a great deal more than you do for putting such trash into your silly noddle. There's only now and then a woman fit to rear children. If men will select fools foewives they can't expect any great nobility of soul in their offspring." Suddenly there rose upon:hi3   80  MR.

"Bid is a lady; she acts good, she tells, no lies, she's merry, she's kind, she plays fair, she's nice; I like her, Dick likes her, so does Gracie." "You have got a pretty comprehensive grouping of lady-like qualities, my dear," said Pen; "may I ask whose child you are?        * "I'm Sabrina's sister; my mamma's name is Alice Bradshaw-and that's how Loraine began the fuss; and they've spoiled all our good time, and I wish that Uncle Alec hadn't invited them, so I do!" Pen blushed like a girl when he found he was talk- ing with the sister of the Silver Lake Goddess-and he was greatly pleased too--"'Tis good blood,"'he thought. Biddy broke away from her friendly captors and stepped to the front.   - "I didn't want the dirty loon to be touchin' me face for a kiss," said she stoutly. "I'd rather be a Paddy nor them, the handsome pair of 'em, wid their fine close!

They stopped an instant in the background, and listened to the hearty lecture Pen was bestowing upon the culprits, who waxed noticeably ashamed of their conduct, thus placed naked before them. The fst clear, positive tones of her voice surprised him, and wheeling about he was filled with admiration, discovering her, erect and royal, one fair round arm encircling the neck of rosy Biddy, whose crimson cheek, resting lovingly against it, made it purer ivory white by onltrast, her proud head indignantly raised (Dio Lewis's book, filled from cover to cover with ' curb in your chin," as the only direction for a fine carriage, would have beefi wasted on Sabrinm. Marie Antoinette herself had not such royal shoulders),'her eyes blazing with their deep carnelian glow. The words she close in explaining the reason of the child's presence suited him for their tunefulness, and their earnest precision   and they were so clearly simple that the sinners felt their actions heinous and cowardly. "' Pauline is a noble child," commented Pen warmly (his look added-quite worthy to be your sister),4" and her favorite's pleasure-party shall not have a rude end- ing. Come, Miss Bradshaw, let's you and I give these young barbarians a lesson in Christian courtesy which will stick closer than a brother for the balance of their mortal career."  "So much for those stupid kissing games!" said Sa- brina, with disgusted emphasis. "If they had been put into a good honest quadrille, it might have been all avoided." e Pen laughed. "Kissing is not a bad game, for two to play at; though I quite agree with you, these young- sters are too tender in age to tilt with lips.

Miss Bradshaw looked on, utterly astonished to see Pen take the lad by an ear, and lead him away into the bay-window. Loraine also looked on, fluttering with fear and anger; and the others stood silent, wait- ing the result of this rather novel mode of engineer- ing a pleasure-party. As for the captive, he went doggedly, compelled by the man-power which had him in charge. Pen made use of his eyes, and of his ex- plaining finger, and his flexible voice; what he said was known but to the two whom it concerned- whether he put forth arguments, threats, or promises, but the result was patent. The sullen bear became gentle like a lamb, the sneak held up his head and looked in the talker's face, the smiling lad put his hand into the one its owner had stigmatized as "a paw," and came back, rather shame-faced, 'tis true, but quite willingly, and said, "Biddy, I am sorry "-and I always noticed that Prance Pedlow was devoted to Mr. Penhurst after that; eagerly watching opportuni- ties to chme into his presence and zealous to serve him. "That's the way to do it, Miss Bradshaw," observed the conqueror quietly. "Never give in to a child; my father always made his boys mind, and when they had misbehaved he made them ashamed, and though I say it, there isn't a black sheep in our family. I don't be- lieve you can find a heartier, truer, honester set of fel- lows than my brothers."

The sort of championship which sprang up between the self-constituted guardians of the children went a long way toward making these new acquaintances friends; and after they had fitted their charges to partners, and set them afloat to the music of a cheerful polka, they stood conversing together, with Biddy Flannigan in close neighborhood, who, though grateful for their goodness, and quite reconciled to her recent foes, had been too deeply hurt to take any fur- ther share in the sports of the evening. Sam Slaugh- ton came along with Irene Bisbee-on his arm, who stopped to make some inquciries of Sabrina about the Hope-chapel Christmas, and while the two girls were occupied with their mission-business, Pen, having noth- ing better to do, naturally studied them, their dresses, features, attitudes; and his eyes rested- upon a pure carmelia, which lay serene and waxen upon Irene's bosom, and that caused him to observe that his coad- jutor wore no flowers or ornaments, and also to notice that nothing could enhance the beauty of her neck and arms, like "Maid Marion's, fair as ivory-bone." Irene, whose idle hand played, as she talked, with the glitter- ing specks upon her friend's violet robe, shaken by the dance-motion from her gold-powdered hair, seemed struck with the same thought, for she left dame Don- noven's needs suddenly, and touched Sabrina's neck with a friendly little pat. *   - 86   MR.

Sam gathered the whole crop of blossoms, so that there were none left for me." She placed the tips of her white-gloved fingers upon the great mass of sweet-smelling purple, which the young man had kissed, and which he wore at his but- ton hole; the corners of her proud mouth tucked themselves away into a friendly smile,while her eyes asked pardon for her rudeness. % Sam wished that he might but dare to let loose the love which he kept cornered in his heart, and give it full license to expand and fill his whole soul; but he did not offer to divide his posy, as he could very properly have done, though he lingered long enough in her charmed presence to hear :Pen say, "I would I had some flowers that would become your time of day--what if you were to take these for once, since friend Slaughton has been so greedy." While he disentangled a couple of half-opened blushes from  their mignonette and jasmine (I ex. pect Thomas would scarcely have thanked him for de- spoiling the basket) he recited to her over his shoulder old Robert Herrick's advice to the virgins: ' Come, gather rosethuds while ye may, For time is still a-flying, And this same flower that smiles to-day, To-morrow will be dying." That's so," muttered Sam; "and I ppose he'll soon be-telling' her the rest of the ditty: "So while we   MR.

Every night the youth made up his mind to leave on the morrow, but she was so friendly, :U and the others might think it odd, and Chandos could not spare him, and-at any rate, he would stop long enough to finish and carry off his Amy Robsart; that i much she -should not despoil him'of-and the sittings were the perfection of delight. Perhaps he did not hasten to the completion of his picture as rapidly as he might have done, and what if he did linger among the charmed moments, dallying with his fate.' It was not because he did not intend to shoulder his future, and walk boldly out into the world with it. The auburn- haired Amy was simply lovely in her Scottish garb, and his position as artist gave him the right to study her clear-cut face in its multiform expressions, and per- haps some of the richest hours Sam ever had were those after Sabrina left him, and he sat still dreaming over the pleasure just completed. If -Bertha ..had known how the, aoor fellow was hugging his hopeless passion, and hidifg it, she might have changed a little her moan-" for men may love and never marry."  :   CHAPTER V. THE VISIONS OF THE NIGHT. SggiHE ball was over; the music hushed; the g-i G  lights out; and Miss Bradshaw thought about it, while she let down her hair in a golden shower. "Rather agreeable, quite entertaining; I wonder did I hurt Sam much by refusing those stupid violets; not that it matters in the least, because he knew I wouldn't touch the things after he had dared to kiss them in that unpleasant way-an old friend; oh yes, but old friends must keep their places. ' Kissing is not a bad game for two to play at' [up comes a sudden blush with rare encoloring, like a dash of carnation over a lily]. He managed those children very nicely, and his face was worth looking at while he did it, too. He walks remarkably well, erect without stalkings and he can stand quiet while he talks; I noticed that-no fuss- ing with his watch-chain or gloves; and less conscious of himself than the lady he is attending. What an odd story that was about John the Baptist night' in Ire- land. I must ask Sonsie where to find it. One might safely call Mr. Penhurst a noble fellow. Pity,he is a widower; I very nearly forgot the fact. He is not to   THE VISIONS OF THE NIGHT      89 blame, I suppose, for having loved a woman and lost her. I dare say she adored him. Well, he has got a lonely life before him; I wonder why he refused to talk of poor Annie; I led up to the subject several times, but he would not touch it. She was a little creature, they say [turning about before her mirror, and surveying her queenly proportions]; I certainly am rattler tall." She took off her fan chain and pulled out some faded buds which Penhurst had twisted into it. She smelt at them before she rather reluctantly threw them upon the toilette; and Robert Herrickls ,erses came to her thoughts, with Mr. Pen as interpreter. She remem- bered noticing his white teeth, and the gleam from his eyes, and also a sparkle in the diamond he wore upon his long lavender scarf. She didn't like scarf neck-ties, but recalled an exceeding becomingness in his. Roses were not favorite flowers with Sabrina, but she picked up the discarded buds and drew a little fresh water for them in her dainty vase, and arranged. them care- fully, saying aloud: "To-morrow 'twill be dying. " It may be that she sank to sleep with magnificent Pen in her thoughts; indeed, I should think it almost certain that she did so; because she had an odd dream about him; she saw in the visions of the night, and lo! he brought her a red, red rose, placing it upon her bosom. "For time is still a-flying," and she had got but a whiff of its fragrance, a look at its bloom, when Uncle Alec came along with Chandos, and laughed at her, and said "I'll bet "-and snatched it rudely from;-   f-  90  - TE VISIONS 0* O'-E NI-GH. its throbbing rest, and dashed it up  the ground where it became a hat; and she was forced, while Sa pelted her with blue-eyed violets, to moun t upon the tall crown, which grew and rose, higher and higherl till she overlooked the church-tower, and she got glimpses of the silent bells, and the bright-eyed doves brooding upon their nests, and Chandy below looked no larger than one of their Christmas dolls, but his clear whistle sounded in her ears, and the "Beautiful Blue Danube "crept with heavy tide around her prison, and her feet moved against her will, and she was forced to waltz as the inice and hapless children jumped to the sound of the magic flute of the Pied Piper of iamly;l and fying faster and more giddily, she fell down down, with quivering breath, all sense one pained thrill; and with a desperate struggle for voice, she awoke, to find herself in her white bed, her airy cllamber full of sleeping moonbeams; the soft liquid stars keeping watch above her, and Deb's mockinp-birds pouring out their rich  songs into the sweet stillness of the silent night. 'She got up and tossed out the harmless buds, as f they were to blame for her uncanny d ream; and belike she tossed out  also all thoughts of Penhurst, f or she dreamed no more.      ' Peace Pelican, Irene, and, Susie followed Bertha Groenveldt into her room after the guests were de- parted, to talk over the ball. "Haven't we had a gay old time ." said Peace, inspect- ing henself before the cheval-glass; "Craigenfels i s a gorgeous habitation; I've a great mind to cast in my lot with this people, and abide here forever."    -THE VISIONS OF THE NIGHT. .     91 "I mean to let Johnny Hauxhurst know that," said Susie, with a slight blush; "I am sure he would like it." Peace turned, and looked at the soft little dove of -a girl in her white muslin, and virtuously resolved to per- form a kind action. "What! le gros forgeron, Susie? He's a fine fellow, but he is too wise to desire to live very near .me; he could never keep me in order-hasn't the ghost-of a wish to try. In fact, he told Chandy he should as soon think of falling in love -with a young steamboat. I was thoroughly vexed at first, especially as nobody had ever desired him to attempt the dangerous feat; but I couldn't blame him, and moreover, I had the sublime conscious- ness that I was fully even with him, and that consoled me." Peace burst into a laugh so merry and infectious that her friends joined- involuntarily. "Well," asked Susie, "what was-it? some of- your tricks, I know."' "Yes, rather. I filled his brushes with red pepper, flesh, tooth, and nail, and he came down to breakfast like a boiled lobster for redness, and after a chance bit of information I afforded as to the breaking out of small-pox in Sylabub, he excused himself, and posted down to Roaring River, certain of being the victim to-- some uproarious disease; and when he passed me in the hall I was blandly unconscious of his neighborhood, being absorbed in reciting' H elon was a leper' with appropriate gestures. The look of anguish he cast at me, when I roared out, 'And then his nails grew black, and fell away from the dull flesh about them,' cleared off all scores and I forgave him on the spot.

Sabrina quenched him, blotted him out, in fact, when he advised her to discard a rose -Mr. Penhurst gave her, which he called passe, and accept instead a bunch of orange-blossoms he held in his useless little fingers." Peace stuck out her small digits affectedly, and grimaced and said, "Mafoil, cela m'effraire / " Iiene broke in on her with an exclamation, "Look, girls! how Bertha makes her letters wait her leisure. I am glad I wrote none of them. I can't imagine how people can bear to leave a friend's words unread. I always fly at mine directly.

"What does she want with me . I don't lve her," she said aloud. Bertha disquiet was Bertha estrange, and she scarcely knew the moody face her mirror showed her.

How do you suppose I know that you were at Craigenfels . You could never guess, but I am to be kind and tell it you--Chandy Goldsmith told me! We talked very much about you on ship, so much that I did get jealous somewhiles, and he said you were to go up to your uncle's place. I know that uncle of the white beard and good face; and I asked many questions when Chandy came up to our hotel for a small visit. He would stop but a moment, yet it was good to have' him come. Dear Bertha, I am to ask you to do a favor for me, and I am sure you will not refuse silly little Dolores. I must also come up there too, and I know you can easily get me invited. I wish to see you and Chris, and Zoe, and Sam, and I am go- ing to tell you a true secret-I want to see Chandy. I just feel as if I must die if I can no more look in his face nor hear him speak pleasantness; I love him, and I feel almost sure that he loves also me. He was kind coming over, when old Maria was stupid and Henriquez cross, and used to take me on deck and wrap me in his blankets and sit by me; and in Rome he and Mr. Slaughton stayed in our palace and went-everywhere with us, and he let me beg him to get blessed by the Holy Father, though he so gyly laughed so handsome, and said I was a little 'nonsense to mind such trash. But it is not trash, because I had a vision, and our Lady of Sorrows spoke sweet words to me about Chandy, and he will become a true Catholic. I shall fully tell you all about it when I come, and you will be pleasant, and get me the leave. You did use to be always kind at   i[   9 6BETHA'S DRAM. school, and I feel it sure that if you loved somebody as much as I love him, and, you asked me to get you to come to a place, I would fast a whole week if it needed. Don't tell Chandy; he thinks so much about delicacy, and says his Americans are all modest and discreet. I am so, too, but I dare not to offend him; and so, cara Berthita, be sweet and make for me the request of your own mind; and send me directly to have it in my hand. My things are all packed, and I shall brought of lovely dresses, and a Byzantine set for you, mea Perlita,-and I feel in so great haste as I am not able to express. I shall eat no more, but say my prayers many times the day, and I will pray also for you, that perhaps you may come over from heretic, and be converted into our true church, and then you shall also come to be in heaven with Chandy and me." Bertha threw down the letter. "Chandy and me!" she repeated angrily. "Indeed, I will not ask her here. * .- What assumption!"She remembered the young Span- iard quite well, and sat for half an hour with her chin in her hand, picturing the scenes on shipboard. Chandy, caressing, handsome,/witty--oh, yes, that' was a presence easily conjured before her. - She knew all the enjoyableness of Chandy's protecting care. Dolores, beautiful, tender, bewitching-she had no difficulty in calling her up either-the wilful, bigoted little Catholic. And again she said, "No, I will do nothinm of the sort. Why should I?"

Peace- Pelican said he was selfish. She knew better. She loved him. - When he came up to Rosenbloom, as soon as he landed from his four years' touring, he was kinder, handsomer, dearer than  ever. The costly gifts he -brought her--from COeyl-n,!  from Damascus, and a dozen out-ofrthe-way places, were her most precious treasures, valuable for the n ice things he said in bestowing them: I:' I thought of you, Bertha, when I got that; shawl. You told Otho once that you longed to possess a real - India. This necklace I bought of a Venetian girl.

What,:;not one, pretty one, when I i: have come so far? Well, n'ilporte, then, put on this- bracelet of cameos, for- the sake of- our old friendship, and I won't make you blush again." The charmin-g  tales he spun over the gifts were worth hearing (Sir) : ; John was Fred's own son for story-teoling), and:-e: them apart from everything else- in the world as es:- , pecially her own. The collar of Roman gold-she had : just laid in its casket was his hobice, and Chris had  received its fellow. He got her leave to come to-:- 5     -   Craigenfels, and brought her in his company. Such a journey! And he had been the most delightful fellow ever since. So that if' she had to give him up, the memory of the charmed -time could never leave her; and this party just over had been an evening of most absolutely rounded and harmoniously complete enjoy- ment.- Chandos Goldsmith was the. party-his face, his voice, his; dancing, his witty talk. She loved her glove because he had buttoned it about her wrist; and  as for the flowers he, had brought her, their invisible perfume, hitting her sense, breathed praises of Chan- dos.; and the look he had worn when he sat down his empty glass, after he said, "Dear Bertha, let's drink to those we love, and those who love us; and we best know what that means, do we not?" ", And his charac- teristic saucy quoting from his favorite Bill Shakes, without which Chandy would not have been Chandy: "In delay there lies no plenty, Then come kiss me, Sweet-and-twenty." And howl he had wiped the cool water from his fresh lips, how he had parted his moustache, holding his hand- kerchief in his gloved fingers, and how handsome his, teeth had showed, and his mischievous smile! He had not squeezed her hands, nor pressed them to his heart; he never did those things. He had not made love to her as other men make love, with grimaces and foolish flatteries. She did not feel sure he wished her for his wife. She-scarcely thought of him as a husband; but she loved him. There are plenty of women who, read- ing .Bertha's story, will fully understand how she felt. -   RBTElTMA   t liMnl.        I , I don't know that men can be made to comprehend unsel  fish worship. I doubt if there be many capable of feeling it. She had in her trunk a photographic album, contain- . ing pictures of the Rosenbloom scholars. She got it out, and studied attentively Dolores' features. It was but a  faint shadowing of the original; but it served to bring . up the oval Spanish face, the long eyes opening to the temples and fringed with their heavy lashes, lus -  trous, melting, passionate. The persuasiveness o er  whole manner, her clinging, fond lovingness, and also : the jealous fits of sudden anger, whih made hersome- times difficult to manage, when she would storm and  rage like a beautiful elf, and adam Groenveldt was  the only one who could keep her in order. T}hen she looked well at her own quiet self -in her  mirror.

I believe it is true what Chris said, 'Women may love, and never marry."'  It-would seem ththe dream-spirit must have been hovering over our friends, for Bertha also was plagued in the visions of the night. She walked with Chandos, holding his hand; they skirted Basswood pond, and she stopped beneath the pines, which whispered and moaned, and looked down into the black water. She did not wish to look, but something held" her glance, and she saw Dolores' face gazing up to her from its still depths, and her outstretched arms, which im- plored her to save her from death; but she could only do so by losing Chandy's hand, and if -she released his warm fingerst she could never clasp them again, never walk by his side or hear his voice; and it was with a great sob that she threw him off and awoke. Her cheeks were wet, and she was trembling, an&/ the moonbeams looked so mercilessly cold, and the night- wind welpt so sorrowfully in the fires, that she cov- ered her head, and had out her lonesome cry beneath the bedclothes.

"What! have I escaped love-letters in the holiday time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them? Never mind, hand it over."  "It is not written yet, but will take only a couple of minutes." A couple of minutes! Ah, Bertha, you mustn't write short letters to me; whole hours are too little to bestow upon them. Come, hasten with that cup of 'scandal- broth,' and we two will slip off to the studio, and I'll put in a few lines while Sam is getting ready." :"This delicious tea which you call names is com- forting me more than I can tell you; such a stupid head as I have to ache so!

"Ruth is ore of those pretty Eastern tales where virtue gets rewarded," said Peace. "Oh, why wasn't I a Mo- abitess gleaning for a husband?" "You," spoke Chandy, teazingly. "There were two young women, and you remember one of them kissed her mother-in-law, and returned to her gods and her people." "AAnd so you think me incapable of self-sacrifice,? replied Peace quite soberly; "well, I'll forgive you, be- cause I am still befogged on that point myself L" Though all wondered at the sudden change in: her manner, none of them understood its reason. Peace was balancing the liquor-question in her mind, trying beneath her reckless gayety to find out how much of its odium she ought to bear, in deference to the will, of her kind father, who bestowed lavishy of good gifts and tenderness upon his dashing daughter, of whom he was justly proud. While Chandos set himself to. pro- voke Peace to a tilting -match, Bertha slipped quietly  away, and returned with her letter before any one:had left the table.

By Jove! it makes me uncomfortable here in daylight, and when I waked I felt like a murderer." Chandy shuddered. "I hate such dreams!" he turned the letter over in his hand.

Nobody in the world had such a wonderful smile as Chandy. It lighted his face in some mysterious way, and made her glowingly lovely in its reflected radiance. She felt worthy to enjoy to the full the charm of his presence and agreeable non- sense; she had conquered her selfishness, and put the duties and needs of her life in such an attitude that she had a right to enjoy-his society, and meant steadily to hold herself in the same mind.

I have lots of adventures still saved for your ears. I don't mind making myself a hero to you-and, I say, Bertha, you remind me of Desdemona--one of the best listeners n record." .

He was gone; and she, standing piled with the furs and shawls the lazy fellow had entrusted to her, fol- lowed- him with her eyes till she got his last pleasant nod before he swept round the curve beneath the oaks. He looked back, knowing for certain that she was still there, and took off his cap in merry adieu. And she had given another girl a chance to win him if she could. Four years ago she told her father weeping, that- when Chandy came home he would have forgotten  her, and she hoped  she should- forget him; but she would never marry anybody else, and to- day she would have-said the same if it had been necessary to put her feelings into words. Good, steady, quiet Bertha went to her father, and sat down to the classifying he had in hand, giving him just the help he needed, as well as her undivided attention; and when Mary McOross appeared, bringing a Dhuge roll of cotton cloth which she wanted made into shirts for her boys, she took up the new task with the same cheerful alacrity. The others did not know that Zephyr's hoofs were ringing out on the frozen ground a tripping mea- sure, which Bertha seemed to hear.

They were quite accustomed to such raids from their - tireless friend Mary, and were only thankful when she brought them clean, white fabric to sew, instead of coats' and pants to mend or carpet rags to cut. ] Mary had in hand an enterprise she was- determined to accomplish. Poor Mrs. Mulligan was sick, and the eight young Mulligans were cold; so she thrust her filling-balls upon the young ladies' notice every opportunity. Re- monstrances were useless--what Mary desired for hers poor people had to be done. Peace volunteered to run the machine, of wfilch she was fully capable. And she propounded a conundrnm after a half hour's ceaseless ticking and close attention, while she leaned back to wait for more basting. "Why is this 'machine like a mocling-bird?'" and Mr. Penhurst put his head into the door just in time to furnish the solution.

Sabrina, though perfectly shocked, and acutely feeling what the poor man must siffer under this rude thrust at his recent bereavement, could not help listening also.

They gave the good creature her wish, reverently, and sent her happy away. The pair of artists returned in season for a sitting in the best time of the sun; and the young people got leave to come and converse with the victims, in order, as Pen said, to put them into the " happy expression," which he  illustrated by sitting down with crossed hand% and face as thoroughly divested of meaning as an apple- dumpling.

They had put it in rehearsal , as soon as Mr. Craigenfels expressed a wish to have it rendered on Christmas- eve. It was in a good state of forwardness before Mr. Penhurst arrived, and Otho was drilling his chorus daily. Sabrina Bradshaw was to have the Benedictus, and the other solos were distributed amongst n-err Groenveldt's pupils, who were perfectly capable of picking them -p at'a moment's wakning. The young men were out at daybreak cutting boughs- and hauling them -down the steep byways, and the pretty kirk was littered with sweet-smnelling greens, and our friends were busy in couples and trios, design- ing mottoes, tying wreaths, and Penhurst and Sam were perched on ladders adjusting and- fastening-ex- amning their work.

Things did not work clear in precisely the shape they intended, however, because Miss Bradshaw, in establish- ing her own way, ran unexpectedly against Dr. Groen- veldt's will, and if she was iron, he was adamant. He declined utterly to permit his wife to sing so "difficult a part without previous practice, and furthermore made her (Sabrina) distinctly understand that he disapproved f her retiring, without good reason, after having - . pledged herself to the work; and both the gentleman and lady explained their ideas with a good deal of par-. ticularity, and Miss Bradshaw left the doctor's presence very erect, with crimson cheeks, and, the deepest carne-  lian light shining through her black eyes, and returned to Craigenfels at the brightest speed her matched colts were capable of making, having entirely omitted the civility of asking for her old friend Chris, and tossed the affair into the curt organist's hands, giving him plainly to understand that he might help himself- at his leisure, fully determined not to sing now, if for no other reason than having beentold she was " fickle, missish, and unreasonable;" and I regret to add that Miss Brad-  shaw was as near being cross as so well-poised a young h  , L nir - Itl I nr,   16   sRazRiNA QUARRELS Wll'h OTHO. lady could be; and if she had been at that moment asked-her opinion of married life, she would have pro- nounced husbands insufferable ;tyrants, and this partic- ular husband a terrible bear, and, while pitying his poor -' - victim, have rejoiced in her own free estate. Ats she held no further conversation with any one 'about the Mass, being occupied the remainder of the day -upon a sofa-pillow in gorgeous pansies she designed for a Christmas to the tyrant's wife, it was with some curiosity that she took her place close. by Uncle Alec, among the audience, in the eveniTig. 'And sober, steadfast, and demure as was the Silver Lake Goddess, and serene and composed after the morning;s disturb- ance, I think she felt secret exultation over the dis- :^i -appointed,Ynot to say consternated, visage exhibited by Mr. Pen, when he espied her superb figure royally r6bed in richest purple; her dark-red hair shining like dead gold through the'loose meshes of its airy net, and the- long white plume falling from her round empress cap caressing her shoulder.

On the contrary, she replied with most ladylike propriety. "h no, sir; I am too modestto couni myself worthy of rank among the seratphs." Pen sat down, and I am afraid he stared. I know he thought of something in connection with Chandy's name which had a "d" in it; but a study of Miss Bradshaw's serene face made him hope her speech might have been only a curious coincidence. Otho wished Chandos to take a solo, but he declined even when Bertha urged him. "No," said he, "I- haven't had opportunity yet to invite ybu to any festive occasion; and I intend to make one out of this Mass, and walk to the little kirk with Bertha on my arm; I wish It was five miles away; then we would drive off by ourselves.

Bertha considered carefully this remark, wondering if he meant Dolores for the coming interloper, and felt rather comforted by the idea.

Everybody was attentive and hushed, however, as soon as the Mass. began; and Sabrina's puzzle was solved when Sonsie 'Yedder rose for the "Benedictus." "There, Mr. Penhurst," exclaimed she triumphantly at its conclusion, "you might live a hundred years 'andneOver hear a purer rendering of that beauty; Mrs. :- S:hag the richest contralto Hever listened to." --"I can unhesitatingly indorse your opinion, until I shall be so fortunate as to hear Miss Bradshaw," re- plied Pen politely.

She was findings many discrepancies during these latter days in her feelings and deportment, and it was espe- cially unpleasant to one of her temperament, this taking   SABBrINA Q(tArrEaLS W1T2  OT0TO.  129 herself to task; she loved to feel her behavior complete in every way; she therefore listened quite humbly to Mr. Penihurst's next remark.       . - "You are abundantly competent to play Beatrice" (in a tone of pique).

The charm of M]r. Pen's society must have been potent, since she yielded so gracefully to- its thrall. Perhaps she considered that she had rather gotten the best of him, after all, in their recent dialogue. At any rate she did nearly for- get, for the time, the contradictions and censurable points in him, which so often jarred upon her convic- tions of pr ,priety; his fickleness, forgetful of sundered t; js; the merry humors he would crop out in, when sle  felt that he ought to be sad. She even forgave his- -never being in a frame of mind to need and gratefully receive sympathy and condolence under bereavement. The singers were made honored guests, because Uncle Alec said, "Anybody who cultivates and uses God's gifts for the pleasure and-improvement of his fellows' is a human benefactor;" and lavish attentions were showered upon the chorus in the supper which 6*               -    :   130   SBBS .

Thomas never neglected any opportunity to exhibit the capabilities of Craigenfels - for hospitality, and Deb was happiest when up toI her elbows in puff-paste and flummery, and the girls and boys whom Otho had selected from the Hope Chapel choir had an entertainment never-to-be-forgotten for tone and- quality. Pen and Sabrina sat at top and bottom 6f their table, and the well-dressed, clean, 'modest youths, while heartily enjoying the edibles with a healthy-appetite, begotten by their long walk /' and unstinted use of 'voice, also carefully bobserved the  conversation and habits of these people, whom they simply adored, and from whom any reproof or admo- :   nition was attentively accepted as a rule of future conduct. It had not always been so: their scholars used in the old days of the mission to receive with suspicion statements and advice from  their new friends. Those who had most power over them plied them with such words as Eve heard from the toad sit-' ting at her e*r -in Paradise. "These Yankees hate you, they cheat you when they can, they overwork and despise you." It required a long course of kind, help- ful actions to lift the crust of doubt and' mistrust :Which their religion taught them, towards heretics. And even now the workers frequently stumbled against opposition and abuse; but that was among the new- comers, and was accounted but trifling discouragement by the earnest, tireless laborers. Of a truth, Sonsie's desire to make i"decent, true Irishmen-" out of the boys and girls had progressed a long way toward ac; coiplishment.  Though Millville grewapace, racing   SABBRTA QUARRAIgS WITH OTHO.-    131 with its older sister Toptown in improvements, having erected itself into a city, with common council, aldermen, and the likle expensive luxuries, crime and evil living were constantly held in check among the operatives f - the numerous factories by the unremitted exertions bf these young people, aided and abetted by their potent friends, the capitalists, who had at length come to, recognize their mission as a strong power, and were- willing to contribute freely of their substance for the sake ot securing health. and sobriety among their hands.                  r While Miss Bradshaw presided opposite him, dis- pensing smiles and gracious speeches with her dainties, who shall blame Mr. Penhurst for thinking how ex- cellently she became the head of a table, and also for turning his mind's eye toward a sumptuous homestead in Canadasset, where he must sit down in solitary grandeur, unless he could persuade this admirable woman to share it with him. After the supper was finished, Sabrina went up to Otho and held out her hand. "You can afford to forgive me," said she, "because you gained infinitely by the exchange." "I quite agree with you," replied the doctor with a grave smile. "Mrs. Jan outdid herself to-night. I never heard her sing as well; she certainly has rare powers; and, by the way, Chris says I must have been especially unpleasaint this morning, or you would' never have flounced out of my house as you did; excuse the word [he was secretly enjoying her scornful dis- pleasure at the application of such an epithet to her d        * ;     A  v?' . -   132   SABRIPA QUARRELS WITH O THO. mode of progression who prided herself upon the quiet .. dignity of her demeanor].

"We will not discuss the subject, if you please. Ybou are not keeper of the seal to my conscience, and arke not responsible for my actions. As for the rude- ness, I saw nothing uncommon in tShat. I should be ashamed to let the sun go down on my wrath, even if I were justly offended by the presumptuous tone of rebuke you chose to adopt towards me;, such old friends as you and I, Otho, ought to be able to give and take plain truths from each other-let alone our cousinship. Faithful are the wounds of a friend." "I don't like cousins any better than other people, if they are arrogant and self-willed," was the "soft answer '" of the doctor. "Neither do I, when they are impertinent and over- { bearing," retorted Miss Bradshaw. "Why, Sabrina! why, Otho!" exclaimed Mrs. Groen- veldt, who came up just in time to hear the last infer- change o civilities. "' Your husband quite forgets that all women are not bound to the same humble service he exacts from his wife," said Sabrina, turning on her with flashing eyes.   SABRINA Q ABRELS WIIT    OTtQO. .138 1"I commenced this conversation with an apology, ' Bliss Bradshaw," said Otho in measured tones of cere- monious politeness, which irritated the proud girl terr'ibly. "And ended it with an insult--I will excuse your tendering any such apology in future," she answered, wheeling round with a grand sweep of her purple robe, and a toss of the long snowy plume in her hat. She had entirely forgotten Mr. Penhurst's vicinity, and it would not have altered her demeanor a whit if she ,had remembered it; she and Otho could never get on together harmoniously, although it must be said to , her credit that she cleared off bright as a sunbeanl after such an explosion',' and behaxved handsomely whenever she found herself wrong. Pen stood back to give her way, making no motion to detain or follow, watching her supple, spirited movements in wonder at her animated beauty--and you may judge how far gone he was when I tell you that he entirely excused her ebullition of temper,-and threw the blame upon the doctor, whom he frowned at as a bear too savage in mood to be set loose among tender maids. As for Sabrina, she went walking swiftly to the chorus, who'were preparing to take leave, and among whom she was received as a "minister of grace." Two minutes -had not passed, and the gentlemen had, not changed their places nor exchanged a wordy when, to Penhurst's utter surprise, the young lady returned as -swiftly as she departed, and came :straight up to Otho with both hands extended. "How could you plague me so," said she in smoothly   flowing; accents, most sweet and persuasive, "when you know I can't. abide being called omissish. Come  forgive me, and let's be friends; there, don't open your mouth till I am out of hearing, because I see by your eyes that you desire to utter somethingc disagree- able, which will surely stir up my angel's temper afresh. You look like the tailor's wife when she per- sisted ii. repeating scissors. Say you forgive me, and let me go to my boys. I am truly sorry you were so rude, and you have my free pardon."    .  Otho' smiled-"Oh, inconsistent persistency1 thy name is womnan," said he. "I am willing to be friends With you the rather, as I am not 'the man to whom you are fated to give a heart-ache. Heaven have mercy on his poor soul!" Pen had commenced listening to the talkers, weigh- ing them, and hoping to fid out the true reason of Sabrina's withdrawal from the Mass, which he could by no means reconcile with his ideas of the young lady's character (calling it fickleness), founded upon : close observation, in the short while they had been fellow guests; and though he got no, satisfaction in that, he ,did realize some profit, for her companion- ghip was more than usually rich and enjoyable after this little fracas. The 'stateliness of her grace never left her, even when she was angry. dIte was not the -only one who followed her motions with attentive watching. Poor Sam onned his never-failing coup- let with sore heart, while conversing gayly and helping ' out the -festivity at his best. -It is true Mr. Penhurst had not Mr. Slaughton's ability to carry off a spirited s S    /        -  SABR INzA QUARRELS   WI2TH OTHO.  135  sketch of the Silver Lake Goddess, which that young artist achieved with furtive pencil, bearing ,a pitcher in her hands, and which' he hid carefully in hip. port- folio ; but then neither did he take to his solitude that night a breast full of sorrowful thoughts, nor did -he throw his soft hat iunder the bed, nor kick his un- offending boot-jack into thecorner, launching after it-- A What care I how fair she be, So she be not fair for me." .' "Well, Captain Slocum, how did you like the : music?" asked Chandos, who with Bertha was pro- longing his "good little time" in that gentleman 's d neighborhood.     " "I couldn't hear half on't; I had a brace of spring- chickens right ahead of me, that gabbled like tinkers.

"I liked to hear her sing," replied the humpback, sedately. He was holding Sonsie's hand and quietly studying her face; as soon as her eyes dropped to his, a sad, sweet smile glimmered over his countenance, and he put the rosy firm fingers he had been'clasping in a love-touch to his lips. "I vum! I never see nothing like the way. that young one dotes upon you, Mrs. Tedder," said the Cap- tain, half jealously; " it beats the Dutch!" "Oh no, -captain, you mistake" remarked Jan;   136 SBASKIA &QUARRELS WIT    7 OTO. , "Sunny can't beat thfe Dutch in that particular line of duty; there's a fellow a long start ahead of him." '  A wondrous glow of graciops pride mantled in the young wife's cheek, and shone through the loving fervor of her deepening violet eyes. A swift vision of a little barefoot wanderer, with a broom in her hand, "Iooking in folk's faces for a gleam of God's charity," passed through her mind. It was scarcely-ever wholly absent from her thoughts. It warmed her heart to- ward the friendless and suffering; it nerved her strength to the earnest work she steadfastly pursued, and Captain Slocum, who knew her whole history, looked at the handsome pair, so admirable, so rich in alt which completes humanity, and repeated softly to himself a passage from his favorite volume: "She looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun. - She openeth her mouth with wis- dom, and in' her tongue is the law of kindness."

The people that, walked- in' dark- ness have seen a great light, they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light hath shined. Our Christ has come! The mis- sion children awakened their friends with stirring chansons. The guests at -Craigenfels saluted each other and their host with kindly greetings and choice gifts. Bridget Flannigan sprang up at daybreak, meaning to sing a joyous carol beneath the window of her dear Lady Sabrina, before the sun should look upon her eyelids, and claim the sweet kiss which her other friend, Sonsi, told her was her right in such a case. She was hindered by an unforeseen circum- stance. She sat up and rubbed her eyes, Which liglted' upon a great box at her bed-side; so freighted that the cover could not shut over its contents. Dolls, books, games, skates, stilts, and clothes, not all newTor fresh, but the gifts of children to this child of poverty and toil.

She ran and called aloud to her mother, who was already astir in preparation for the family:washing on this holiday from factory toil; she captured her ruddy father, smoking his dudeen, around the neck, compelling them to come and see. "Pauline has been here," she shouted; - this is her doll, I know, and Gracie's books, and Dick's skates, I wore them yestere'en; and Clove's stilts; and look at the bonny dresses. Oh mother, mother 1 my heart will break:"5 , They must be worth something, such prayers and blessings .as poured -forth -from the full soul of the grateful child, while the father and mother stood by wiping their eyes and rejoicing -in her joy.' The girl hurried on her clothes, and ran a good -half a mile without stopping, so feathery light were her feet from her dancing jubilance; and you may be sure she got the kiss she humbly begged, after she had made the lady hear about her treasures, even although the king of day-had already showered his beams upon the face, which was far more complete in loveliness, and dearer to this childish warm heart, than any painted picture of the "Mother of God," whom her priests commanded her to worship. Sabrina was full of pride and thankfulness concern- ing her large-souled Pauline; while she brushed out the, threads of her wondrous hair, and fitted on her purple robe, and the-soulful gladness beamed in her eyes and inspired her greeting to -Mr. Penhurst, who '   DICK CATCHES A ELY IN OCHURCG.    139 wondered at her animated cordiality, and admired her airy springiness of motion, as she walked through the long hall, and into the conservatory, seeking Thomas and her, violets. The little maid was sent to Deborah for breakfast, but would scarcely stop, so eager was she to be at home and revel in her new joys. And after seeing her on her way they joined the other guests in the great libra- ry, who were assembled to invest their Lord of Mis- rule with his courtly apparel. Our Howadji having been chosen by acclamation, was arrayed gorgeously in flowing robes, bedecked with chains, bracelets, jew- els, and a collar of tinkling silver bells. He looked like an astrologer gone mad, and numberless jokes were exploded at his expense, which he received with serene urbanity. The prime ministers were then appointed, and ordered to appear in green and gold liveries, be- stowed at once from the royal doffers, and straitly com- manded to seek andwear, as badge of office, a kerchief from best-loved maid laid about their necks, after the immemorial custom-of good Christians at Yule. There was a little flutter among the ladies at this announce- ment,and some exchange of shy regards, and then the court dissolved, charging the two young officers to come- arrayeid to breakfast within five minutes, upon peril of disgracement. When the guests adjourned to the great drawing-room, laughing, jesting, and talking over the good beginning of their fete desfous, Chan- dy followed Bertha, hastening away to feed her doves. "You heard the order," said he.  Come, Desde- mona, lend me thy handkerchief. They say that:the  ' "** ' -* .       -        '    "O   DICGK CATCHES A.

She smiled into his teasing, saucy, handsome face, and went on tossing grains among her cooing favor- ites-             -  "I'm nearly through, Chandy," said she quietly, "and I will fetch you my choicest." "Yes; the one spotted with strawherries, because there's magic in the web of it, and from the time of putting on I shall dote upon thee." Bertha went-with his half careless, half earnest words dropping upon her heart. She kissed the token before she placed it in his hand. And so Chandy came to table with a dainty, gauzy, perfumed mou0- cAhois over his green jacket, and just at the spot where his brown curls lay thickest one might have espied the letters B. G. in curious needlework. Johnny Hauxhurst was longer coming, and entered , after all were seated, leading Susie Jenkins by the hand. The Lord of Misrule opened his mouth to re- primand his tardiness, but paused with his finger on his lip, saying-- - "So, so, Adam and Eve-the pretty fraulein and the stalwart man-'tis well, 'tis passing well." Susie hung back a little coyly, and her rosy soft cheeks and fluttered manner were exceedingly pleasant - - to see beside thetowering pride of brave Johnny's manhood. All eyes rested upon the pair, and all were transfixed 'with astonishment, when Johnny paused t       e4   DICzK CATCHES A -FLY IN CUR CH.    141, before his- genial host, who, while watching their ap- proach, caressed his long beard admiringly. "Friends, countrymen, and lovers! I have brought you the lady I love best. I pause for your congratu- lations. I understand it is the proper thing to announce engagements, and I hereby inform you all that Susie and I mean to get married. Now, then, please run through the rest of the remarks and so on as speedily as possible, in pity to our youth and inexperience." If Susie had been taken bys surprise with the unex- pected and most straightforward love-making of the man she secretly adored, she was absolutely overwhelmed under this new " outing," and tried to slip away and hide her crimson shamefacedness; but he held her fast. "Don't go, Susie, " he said, whimsically; " the worst is over now." And they all gathered about her, with gay words and kisses, and compelled her to sit down among them.      ^ "Capital!" exclaimed Chandos, thumping the table. "This Misrule is exceedingly jolly. I am minded of a passageof Scripture--' and Judas went out and hanged himself ;' go ye and do likewise." - "One more gone," said Peace aside to Irene, While she made great pretence of sighing like a furnace, her face was a study, so many feelings commingled beneath her show of gayety. "' Our chance grows smaller by degrees and beautifully less.'., This world is hollow, and my doll is stuffed with bran, and if you please, ma'am, I should like to go into a nunnery." Johnny's engagement was in truth a queer beginning of thie new life, but it prospered well, and greatly in-   "2   DICK CATOHES A FLY IN CtUMiaH. creased the interests and pleasures of the Christmas at Craigenfels. There was a grand rally of the household to the morning service at the mountain church. Deborah and Thomas headed the servants in proper fashion, and- the sometime Lord of Misrule, transformed into an organist, led the pealing chanson, welcoming the day, in which all heartily joined. The Rev. Jonas Hodges, our other. young husband, read the service, and then the worshippers bent their heads in reverent attitude while he lifted up his voice -in prayer. No, they did not all bow; and thence occurred an unforeseen diver- sion from the order of exercises., Dick Walsingham had come up with Pauline to spend the day, and after examining all the presents, and being coddled by Deb, and petted by their friends, especially Sabrina, who re- joiced greatly in the real goodness her little sister had shown toward Biddy-and also by Mr. Penhurst, who probably had reasons of his own for making friends with the outspoken child-they accepted the invitation to go up to kirk, and reached the door just as Herr Groenveldt, who had them in charge, was putting the finishing touches to an original tale which he called "The Owl's Wedaing." They were seated well in front, and behind them Irene and Peace Pelican, and Cab- by (who had come iup quite unexpectedly, attracted by somebody's charms, or the prospect of a gay dinner). Chandy and Bertha, Sabrina and Penihurst, Susie-and her betrothed, had enjoyed chatting in pairs--chemin w ja/nSart--and poor Sam sat-beside his host, cohere he could see the clear-cut profile of the girl he loved. , **   DICKf CEATCHES A FL Y IN CGHURH.   143. Peace leaned her head upon the pew-front in seemly devotion; but as Dick persisted in sitting bolt upright, the bright plumes in her gray hat nodded and danced about his close-cropped crown, ever and anon bobbing into his neck just ;uside his turn-down collar, with a dip-and-go like -an impudent fly at midsummer. The youngster wriggled and made faces awhile, keeping a preternaturally decorous attitude, being a well-taught lad, part of whose religion consisted in ". sitting still in meeting." IBut the sensation was persistently disagree- able; his angry passions began to rise, and dire revenge kindled and burned in his outraged soul. He felt that the " world was not wide enough for the poor devil and for him;" and dim visions floated before him of whole handfuls of flies, he had scooped off window- panes at one fell swoop. HEe made up his mind that there was a point where endurance ceased to be a vir- - tue. Reaching cautiously around, he gave a frantic' clutch, and caught a prize! A sudden rustle and sup- pressed exclamation caused all neighboring heads to lift; and, lo! Dick, eying the scarlet plume he had snatched from Miss Pelican's hat, which tilted over black orbs gleaming with passion. "Golly!" said Dick, i -a stage-whisper, goggling his eyes at the innocent feather. "I thought you was -a sneaking fly, so I did!" Peace's sense of humor overcame her indignation, and, though her vivid color mounted high and higher, it was suppressed fim which kindled it, while she adjusted her head-gear amidst the stifled mirth of her friends .'   - 144: DICK CATCHES A FLY  Z  CN OHURCH. Chandy murmured in Bertha's ears Oh, fly not yet, sweet maid!"  She shook him off, and struggled for sobriety. The Rev. Jonas Hodges, who had been committing the heinous misdemeanor of praying with visual sense alert, lodking at his wife, perhaps, had seen the whole, and rather jumbled the, Psalms, with which" it was his habit to embellishi his orisons; and he afterwards assured the partner of his bosom that he had got a les- son for, life-to keep hiseseyes shut in prayer-time. Poorl Dick was -so chagrined, that, he was only kept from going  "right off home" by Pauline's blandish- ments, and he sat out the service full of vindictive thoughts upon the "A trumpery girls would stick on to bother a feller!" He rather resented the good shaking Peace gave him after church, feeling that hLe was the victim.   CHAPTER XII. MR. PENHUIBST TEACHES IN SU20Ay SCHOOL.

She always brought over her span fromr the Quince Bush, which were nearly pure-bred, and as fond as lovers of their stout mistress. The little church, which some people were accustomed to call "Vedder's Villy," was dressed with greens adorned with choice flowers, and brilliantly lighted, when the party reached it, because Mrs. Jail's mission- children were about to have a festival; and the specta- cle it presented when they entered was truly beautiful and satisfactory. Sam's mottoes,--framed in Venetian carving, hung beneath the pictures uponr the walls, which the friends had brought home for this use; and : .' as there were true art-lovers among them, you may be 7      1 ,    '!5) . :146 MR.

Chandy's St. Agnes was richly empanelled into the oaken pulpit, and the twelve windows were painted with exquisite skill; and; though the designs were uniquely rare, much fault was found with them by people who dreaded innovations upon the frigid, rigid, barren nakedness of Puritan worship. Each was an illustrated proverb from  Holy Writ, of which the words surrounded the stained glass in curious embla- zonry. ^"But the path of the just shineth more and more unto the perfect day." " The way of the wicked is darkness; they know not at what they stumble." cc Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and ob- taineth favor of the Lord."  This last Jan persisted in putting on the list of orders, in spite of Sonsie's remon- strances; and very beautiful was the gracious maid, " yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty," whom the painter had embodied, though I believe none except the few recognized the resemblance to the- full- orbed woman whom he had received directions to pre- sent.  Many, seeking knowledge under difficulties; inquired of the Tedders the cost of their windows, and were none the wiser for their questions. Old Miss Petingill examined the lecturn. " Well, I vum!

It was new business to him; but, with ready American adaptation to circumstances, he just-put his mind to compelling their interest in his -teaching, studying the sharp, knowing faces before him, making shrewd guesses at their characters and proclivities, and the lesson was a perfect success; the boys imbibed from his earnestness a new impulse- fresh desires after knowledge. He openly exulted in the excellence of the children's music, and roared out a sub-bass which under-floated the young voices, bear- ing them upon its sonorous strength lilke the deep stops of a great organ. He stood ap to make a speech when called on, which the boys appreciatingly relished for its clear points, forcible hits, and the subtle fun of his storied illustra- :-: . s tions.

And though she said "Htush! be quiet!" to naughty Chandy, who whispered to- her, she indorsed his opinion of his friend. "A jolly fine fellow-isn't he, by"Jove! A good prayer, a good tallier, a prime dancer, a king of horse- men, a champion skater! I have no ambition to see a goodlier man."  The proud woman blushed to the waves of her dark red hair rippling in dense gold masses round her clear- cut face, as she recalled another of Miranda's sayings, and fitted it, almost against her will, upon the gentle- man she was studying. "I would not wish any com- panion- in the world but you, nor can imagination form a shape besides yourself to like of; for nothing natu- ral ever saw I so noble!

Mr. Penhurst took good care to serve at Sabrina's division in the coffee-room, and they exchanged a hearty laugh over a little incident which occurred in their vicinity. As the fun got fast and furious, Dick, chasing Pauline, ran into Deacon Proddy, and tripped him so that he ran half-bent, stumbling and clutching at things until he finally fell; and, before the unwit- ting cause of the accident could get breath to apolo- gize, old Miss Petingill took him by the shoulders, and waved herself back and forth in front of him, evidently under the impression that she was giving him a good shaking.

The good man shook his head, and-applied a hand to his waistcoat, which had come in violent contact with a chair, and waved the spinster off, not particularly delighted by her attentions. "I hope you have not injured yourself infernally, deacon . " persisted Miss Petingill, determined to con- dole. "Childun, you must play putty, and not knock ag'in people,"5 said the deacon, tmrning his back upon the spinster and her remarks. I have heard of the man who ordinarily weighed two hundred, but who, when he was mad, weighed a ton; and I think Dick's pounds ought to have been quadru- pled when he was let loose from the ancient tailoress' bony grip.

If we had only a few such earnest ladies as your Roaring River friends, we .could tread closely in your footsteps. Women can accomplish wonders where we men cannot stir.

They found the teachers busy finishing- up odds and ends of society-work, binding bed-quilts, tucking Ia  dresses, darning old clothes, which had got to be dis- tributed before Sunday. Sabrina and Peace were hard at worlk at a quilting-frame, tying off a comfort which Mary Mc(ross needed for Mrs. Heffron; and Pen- hurst and Sam, with darning-needles and red yarn, tacking under their direction. Mr. Hauxhurst having dropped in on his way to the Gonecusset office, they set his kit before him, and succeeded ain getting a pair of red shoes for the great waxen doll which Pauline Brad- shaw had brought in too late to be dressed for Margery Hughes--Biddy Flannigan's t" fust cousin "-and who had been given away wrapped in brown paper, with a promise of a subsequent outfit suiting her beauty. She jtrnera -I   CHtRISTABEDLS POOR FOLKS.     155 lay in Susie Jenkins' lap, with her blue eyes shut, placidly sleeping away the hours till she could be robed for society. You may be sure that persistent Pauline abated no watchfulness till her favorite was served. They tried their best to make Bertlha stop and help; and, much. as she liked Chandy's company, she would willingly have shrunk from the taskl' before her. The young man studied her face with a half-smile, but would not hear of leaving her behind. u' Nay, good ladies," said he, 'd this most replenished sweet work of nature, called Bertha, must needs go with me, it is not good for man to be alond. Sabrina looks as scornful as Juno's peacock, but Bertha shall not stay;" and he carried her off, in spite of their en- treaties and hard words. Now Pauline, seeing the doll's work progressing, and getting rather tired of the exclusive conversation be- tween the little dove of a Susie, who spoke so low that her brooding tones were exceeding difficult to catch, even for the sharp-eared child, and good Johnny Hauxhurst, who paid no heed to her questions, sought out Mrs. Groenveldt, darning stgckings, and putting her soft arms around the young matron's neck, she set up the familiar cry': "A story, dear Chris; now tell us a story." "Indeed, then, I will, right willingly, my Pauline, for I have a sorrowful thing upon my heart, which may be all the lighter for- telling it, and perhaps it will point the way for your busy little fingers to achieve a good purpose."           . 4w So Pauline flew away and brought Gracie to listen -  ,  - .-      .

A10  ; *- ",One bitter night, not long ago, a small lad went homeward with a load of coals. He had been picking them from various ash-heaps in side-alleys and before ? of   great stores, and though he had been busy the whole afternoon, his little pail was scarcely half filled. As he walked slowly on, he was considering how by carefully devised falsehoods he could keep from his parents a certain roll of bills that lay snugly'hid in his ragged jacket-packet. "' It'll never be healthy sleepin' to home,' quoth he, I if t'auld man' gets his cruel hand on it this evenin'.' NI     ^ ( "To be sure, the words of the great yellow motto that hung on the wall at the mission would keep running - in his mind, ' No lie thrives.' He had repeated them over a dozen times to himself only the Sunday before, so as to have them perfect for the grand concert, but I cannot say that they made any deep impression, and F tis true for you, Pauline, Billy was too cold and too ^ hungry to argue long with himself on such a slight matter as this; and the thought of his little family Hii. waiting anxiously for him quickened his lagging steps,  and he hastily mounted the stairs to his miserable i L ---  garret. i His mother was not there, but the children were, and !: -:" - they all gathered around the handful of fire that yet remained in the rickety stove, and began to talk over, in an old sort of way, the events of the afternoon- isi  :  ;Xggies fruitless search for cold pieces, Patsey's happy   in           CHRntISTAZBE'S POOR FOLKS.    15: success in finding some old iron, and the pleasant news : that Patience of Hope Sewing School would presently recommence, and Maggie declared her intention of 'putting in for a dress.'                                I - "Directly the mother stumbled through the doorway, ' and going as straight as her tipsy feet could carry her  | to Billy's pail, she emptied the whole of his careful  :: pickings upon the fire. Then she produced a loaf of    i ! stale bread, which she divided amongst the children.     | Mike, the idiot boy, cast a ferocious animal glance tlpon  Maggie's share, and with foolish cunning contrived to   - snatch it from her; and then ensued a quarrel, during .  which the bone of contention was dropped into the fire,  --1 and slyly fished out and eaten by greedy Patsey, while the others kicked, scratched, and howled upon the floor. "In the midst of the disturbance the father entered, half-drunk as usual. He reeled up to Billy, and de-      ' .. manded his bit of money. The Sunday-school motto and Miss McCross retired into the dim background of the boy's mind as he instantly answered-                 -< "' I didn't get a red, father; niver found ary, job.' " 'You're telling lies, ye young blackguard; give it up  , - before I lick ye good,' snarled the father, steadying  _ himself and trying to look wisely sober.

The cherished bill "2  changed hands, and with a blow and a curse the boy s   was flung into a corner, where he cowered, raging with evil passiops. But not for long, because too soon came the dreaded order, to go out and spend the money in a I   quart of whiskey. The poor lad dared not refuse, and wrapping the hated black bottle in his tattered jacket, he sought the nearest rum-shop, and slunk home with his head down and his cheeks burning with shame and anger. The parents of these hapless children, having obtained the liquor, began to sip it with the greatest relish, careless of the sullen faces of the little ones, who watched them, knowing well what was certain to come -:  after. Getting drunker, they came to high words, and the devils they had been putting into their souls began - to fight and roar out blasphemy and curses. ' "The children hid behind the stove, the only article. [, -  of furniture in the room which seemed to promise pro- tection, and awaited the arrival of the police, sure to be attracted by the noise. Oh, they knew full well the winding up of their dear-parents' evening pleasures. And not long had they to wait. Patsey and Mike aped their elders, and squabbled and fought over half a cigar, picked up on the steps of the Millville House, 1;: s  and chewed to keep down the pangs of hunger. Then the father, disturbed by the squabble in the enjoyment of his own quarrel, seized on the nearest child and began unmercifully to beat her. Billy sprang up and caught the swinging arm dropping blows upon the tender flesh of the little one. i" Father,' said he, with white face, and great desper-   ' tq     ECHRISTABEL'S POOR FOLKS.      59 ::i   -ate eyes,' Father, if you will beat one of us, it shall be :  -! me, not Maggie.' ?i   C  ' It might have gone hard with the boy for his bravery, i   as well as the girl for her weakness, but happily the r  - - bluhe-coats came in time, and dragged the parents to the station-house. But the poor little children were left alone. The night grew colder and colder. The fire was almost out, and Billy watched the coals blacken one by one, and die, knowing too well what would hap- pen next, and dreading to think of the long, dreary, dark hours before them. "' Let's pour on the whiskey,' said Maggie, who had by this time hushed her sobs, and crept close to the side of the brother she loved. ' Once, when mother was out, 1 poured on a little teenty drop out of the nasty black bottle, so hateful; but she came back while it was burn- ing and licked me dreadful--ugh! how shiverin' 'tis!' "' She can't hurt you for't now, Mag,' quoth little Pat, the youngest of the group, who had a right to be a pretty thing, but got cuffed and knocked about instead; 'Ah, Billy dear, me poor fingers is foze intirely; do lit's pour on the dirty liquor.' ' We'll just put a wee mossel to a time,' answered Billy,' then 'twill last the longer.' [     "'So the children stood around the rusty old stove, and held their purple hands above the flame, while the blue X .   light flickered ghastly on their pinched, sorrowful faces. At length the last drop was poured out, the last red coal faded into- dead blackness-no fire. Surely the kind Jesus, who watches over all little ones, looked upon "these with pitying eyes; but the wind whistled no,ess   " 160  , ACHRISTABEL' POOR FOIKS. bitterly as it swept the frozen river in piercing blasts, dashed up the narrow court, where the gaping, crevices of the rickety building sucked it in like so many mouths. Billy was thinking of the bbroken window, where the snow drifted white and lay where it fell, never melting off the mud-grimed floor; and. each sharp wind gust, blowing up through the knot holes and rattling the half- hung doors, whirled the dead ashes -from the dirty hearth, and cut his ill-clad form like a knife. "' Let's go to bed,' said he at last; ' we'll cuddle close, and maybe we won't feel the cold so bad-where are the clothes ' he added, as he felt around the old mat- tress, which was all the semblance of a couch the poor room held. "'Mother sold 'em the morn,' answered Maggie, sorrowfully. ' She's been drunk all day, but there's a quilt aneath'the straw, Bill--she was too drunk to see it--that's all she left.' "Billy placed his fingers on the stove. ' The top of it is warm yet,' said he;' come, Patsey, and sit upon it.' "So he lifted the little fellow up, and Maggie also climbed to his side. "By this time there was quite a tall rift under the broken window, and foolish Mike crept to it, attracted by its glitter in the darkness, and began to swallow handfuls, vainly trying therewith to satisfy the cravings of his appetite. His chattering disturbed his brother in his futile efforts to cover the mattress with the little ragged quilt, nor could he coax him away till his ach- ing fingers drove him howling to the wretched bed. The stove was colder now than the floor, so the children   c-RrISTABELs POOR FOLKS.      161 were forced to leave it; but there was no room for Billy in the huddle which shivered among the straw, nor covering enough to shelter those already there, so the boy began to walkl up and down- the place, and wait for the morning. Perhaps he thought about his parents, snug and warm  at the station-house, while he was freezing at home. Perhaps the lie of the evening rose fresh in his memory, and the after folly of it, and the curse; he heard A stifled sob from the bed; he knew that was Maggie; then anotherand another--they were crying-all! the poor little ones suffered. Billy was only a child; what could he do but mingle his tears with theirs? "At length Maggie spoke: 'I say, Billy, darling, let's ask God to please to make us warm.' "' No, Mag, I'm afeard ;' replied he 'I telled a lie this evening; he wouldn't listen now, I'm a-thinkin'.' ' I'll'ask Him moeself; I tell lies, but He knows I have to, and maybe He won't be, mindin' of :em this time, when we're so poorly.' "'Well, I don't care,' answered the boy in a desperate voice; 'twon't do no harm to try, and we're like to die anyhow. Come on, Mag.'               - "Then the two lmelt upon. the floor, and Maggie whispered, ' You begin, Bill;' and this was the prayer : "' Don't you lmow how cold we are, oh Lord? and can't ye's be after warmin' us up a fwee bit, come mornin'? We don't deserve it nohow, but Miss Me- Cross says it be warm in heaven all the time, so we thought ye's might spare some heat as well as not, and niver miss it yoursel' at all at all.'   - 162   BeRISTABEl'S POOR FOLKS. - After that they sat down on the bed-edge, and putting their arms around each other's necks they, bitterly cried, and by turns comforted each other, until, still sobbing, at last they fell asleep. "Next morning they were awakened by a knock at the door, and in walked one of their neighbors. "' I heard yer fuss and schreelin' last night, and so I've come to see how ye's be gettin' loang,' said she. "We've been froze afore; we're used to it,' answered Bill sullenly. "' Well, well, my lad, if-ye'll take me advice ye'll go right off to Mr. Vedder. By the same token, he's a broth of a missioner entirely; and ax him a bit of firein', and I'll take in the childer till ye coom agin.' "So kind-hearted Mrs. Dennis led these worse 'than motherless babes into her warm room, while Billy took her advice and went to Brookedge, seeking Mr. Vedder. His story was a short one, and his blub lips and stiffened limbs witnessed its truth. So Jan hastened with the child, took a look into the desolate home, and his heart brimmed over with heavenly pity, and pity with our Jan means help.

"That night, when the tired, childish heads were laid   CHRISTABEL'S.

"He answered ves' right heartily; and then, in the fulness of his gratitude, he remembered Miss McCross' oft-repeated request about an evening prayer, so he sprang up, kneeling, and said: "' O Lord, you heard us last night, when we was cold, and to-night you have made us warm. If you'll help me, I won't tell no more lies, for I'm sure we's all very much obliged to ye's.' "After which he got into bed with a lighter heart; and Christ Jesus, as he:kept loving watch over all his little ones, looked down on four happy sleepers in the old garret in River Street."' , -  AWhen Christabel Groenveldt ceased, Pauline, who had been fighting her sobs, and cuddling Gracie, who was dissolved in tears, broke out: "Oh, Chris! what a sorrowful story! I didn't want to cry; it makes mne ache here and here," pressing one small" hand upon her throbbing heart, and clutching her throat with the other; " it hurts to hear such things about children who suffer." "So it does, Pauline, darling; and the most pitiful part of this story is, that it is, all true ; and I heard to- day that the young O'Haras are again in dire distress; so we must, once more, try to bring them out of ,the horrors of starvation."-   164:    CHRISTABEL'S POOR FOLKS. "Why, did the folks come back and beat them hard 2?  whispered Gracie, lifting frightened eyes. "They came home, dear, and I am afraid their chil- dren have not much good times any day; but we can do something to aid, and so these quilts and things-must go there.

"Ugh," grunted Sam, " why don't they give the poor devil a barrel of whiskey, and let him make a finish of it?" Peace sat with her back toward them all; she had completed the comfort while Chris talked, and cut it with angry clips from the frame, and bitter humilia- tion weighed upon her soul. Here am I," thought she, ' the daughter of a distiller, soft handed, sumptuously kept, and they starve!" The little needs and luxuries being ready, Sabrina begged Peace to accompany her, and help distribute them. She. consented, with lowering, cloudy counte- nance. And Mr. Penhurst, who had obtained per- nission to go also and carry bundles, got few answers to his talk from her. Sam declined being of their party; he threw a greenback into Christabel's lap, and said he was going up the mountain to inspect his woodchuck traps.

Sabrina took a good lungful of fresh air after they had done what they could, and said (standing in the street, waiting the slow descent of the others down the treacherous stairs): "Does it not seem as if a merciful kind Providence might stop the useless breath of that chattering idiot, and cut short his life of starvation and blows, and take him up among the other infants, and give his cramped soul room to grow?a  "Yes," replied Peace, " an infant-that's just'what he is, and will be while he stops here, with a little tiny atom of a soul, like a pin-head.

Mr. Penhurst undertook the job of getting him off; and' Sabrina, who was busy among the clothes she was packing into the little old " kist " which was to accom- pany him, and which it had cost her and Peace a couple of hours' time to collect among their friends, watched closely this man, who was getting so large a place in her thoughts-his gentleness and manly for-' bearance, and the'ready wit and management which made force needless toward the unstrung, half-wild x inebriate; the kind, almost womanly consolations he offered the sick wife, who, through all her drunken sottishness, had yet left a clear spark of love for the husband of her youth, which kindled and glowed at the first breath of separation; the befitting counsel and help he gave brave Billy, who stood back watching their proceedings with swelling heart; the gentle hush-7 ing whispered in Maggie's ear; the comprehensive oversight he took up as naturally as though these out- casts were his lawful care. Sabrina packed some fur- tive, tears among the garments, which she would have   I'  CHRISTABEIS 'POOR/ O FOLKS  been ashamed to let be seen; and; after she left, the gentleman and;his charge at the station, she-drove Peace up to Craigenfels, still alive with the emotions engendered by their morning's work, and went straight to her .room, scarcely pausing to speak the petting words she was accustomed to bestow upon her colts, and pushing off Flirt with a distrait rebuke, who slunk  away, greatly marvelling in her doggish soul over the* - unprecedented  occurrence. She was restless, too, in her solitude, and, after putting away her- wraps, she- drummed absently upon the window-pane, then, took up a'book and read a page without knowing a word-of it; then she tried her scrap-bag, but made nothing of the forget-me-nots she was working into its ;stripes, except mistakes; and finally she gave in to the secret desire she had been fighting, aid went over to Peaces room, to make her talk about Mr. Penhurst. She 'found, her enthroned in chaos, boxes, bundles, frag- ments, heaped around her, hemming her in and jost- ling her. '                  : What is to be -the result of all this?' asked Miss ' .: Bradshaw, to whom the confusion looked like- a f/tal uprooting of the foundations of order-she, who was the queen of harmonious proprieties, and never made '  anly splurges of cleanliness,      A  "A regulated closet,' replied Peace, sententiously; "and I wish 'I could clear up all I find muddled, as  easily as I can arrange my rag-bags.

"Yes,'r replied Peace, craning up to follow the motion of the pretty white digit, "I see the slow- m6ving finger of scorn; but, as the room is Ellen's care, not mine, you needn't mind leaving your card. You may have an opportunity to sample my neatness some dray in a two-pair back; and then, if you find the footprints of the ages on my furniture, I'll give you afull leave to write anything you please." -"My dear girl, what has so upset your agreeable equilibrium, after our finished good work?" asked Sabrina, watching awhile the impatient twitches and punishing Peace was inflicting upon her unoffending parcels. As Chandy says,'What hath puddled your clear spirit . '" TI'm degraded in my own eyes,' stormed she. "A fool has asked me to marry him! I'm trying to find ,out which of my good parts attracted him, and what hitch in my conduct gave him courage to bring out the insult." ' "Ah, je comprend.  Mr. Cymbalinus Adolphus Brown, familiarly called Cabby; I saw him twirling his mustache in the drawing-room as I went up, and flitted past softly as the trailing garments of the night sweep through her marble halls. I was in no mood for a dose of Europe, but it seems I might have gone at my leisure, as his visit was for you." : Yes, it was.

I'd like to know what he means by his impudence." "Shall I stab your vanity, and tell you what I think V" "Stab my vanity! Yes, if you can find it,"' said Peace, pausing and looking curiously into her friend's smiling face. "I would write down the offer to the account of Mr. Ablmelech Pelican's money-bags." 'Oho! so you think the puppy smelt the malt which lay in the houses that -Jack built. Well, I only wish he was the rat that ate it, and got swallowed by the good pussy; plenty of his betters are drowned in papa's vats every day, and help to make the witch- broth thick and slab. Charley says beer-drinkers would lose their good appetite'if they could inspect the dregs of their liquor; but what makes you think filthy beer- lucre is the tipple the manakin desires when he swears French oaths that he adores Peace Pelican,?" asked the young lady, who, disavowing vanity, had still enough in her composition to feel irritated that even a fellow she despised should value her for her father's dollars. ' I heard Johnny Hauxhurst say that your exquisite suitor was dreadfully in need of funds. It seems old - Mr. Brown is not proud of his useless son, and does not desire longer to help him shirk the natal curse; having become weary of paying his debts, he declares that Cymbalinus shall hereafter earn his bread before - he eats it."  "And so he metaphorically desired to eat me.-t I'-  1% ^ t2   EGCMRISTABBS8 POO SFOLKS. ought to feel obliged, I am sure. I wish I had flouted him more viciously than I did. Shall I tell you that the puppy actually wept in his handkerchief when: I made: him'at' last comprehend that I would none of his dandyfied snippiness, and I was fool enough to feel sorry for his disappointment." "Ah, ye tears! ye flowed for the evil, deeds of Clapham, the landlord who seized poor Cabby's horses till the long board-bill should be paid. Don't grieve over your insufficient floutings, dear," replied Sabrina laughing. "I have no doubt you quenched the youth all he could bear." "I hate men; there I I won't get married as long as I live," exclaimed Peace with vicious emphasis. "You remind me of a small conversation I heard one day between Pigeon Blail and Otho's- Leonore. The little fairy is desperately fond of new shoes, and had gotten a tiny pair of azure beauties which filled her baby-soul with rapture. She caressed and admired them, then grew thoughtful, then cast down, and at last broke forth in desperate sobbing. "' Wlat's the matter, Leo ' asked Pigeon, peeping beneath her curls; ' what makes you cry so?' "Oh, dear, I feel bad (sob, sob); I don't want to go to heaven; I don't believe they gilve people any new shoes up there.' "Pigeon considered a moment the quality of consola- tion best suited to this unique-grief,- and finally cheered the weepingcherub with this comforting suggestion: ' "Don't cry, Leo; 'cause maybe you won't have to go to heaven, you know. "   Peace darted a queer look out of her :roguish eyes, at the sober, demure countenance of her 'steadfast friend, and colored slightly as she thrust out of sight a package of letters which came under her hand at the instant. They were signed John -Iauxhurst. There wasn't a word of love in them, lBut somehow she didn't like to look at them just then, and she girted the string about the bag's mouth with hasty fingers. -: "Yes, thank you. I am fond of being instructed in parables; you need not explain the point. I see, I see,' says the blind man,' I see clearly;' and apropos, Sammy Slaughton is a- nice boy, isn't he?" "Extremely nice," replied the Silver Lake Goddess, the lily of her face splashed with a delicate rose. She laughed as she departed, having found no good oppor- tunity to open the subject she came to have talked of, and she tossed back a remark which kept ]Miss Pelican's thoughts busy for .a good time after her purple robe floated through the portal.  - :           C ' Frances Haythorne loves a lass with a P, because she is peaceful, pugnacious, pronounced."

THE  detailed escort had a delightful drive after they left their co-workers at the Hope. "Now then," said Chandy, as they turned the corner of Pinnacle Place, touching his hat to Miss Adeliza Euphemia Hitchcock, who was busily rocking before the long casement, in a flaming toilette, hold- ing a yellow cover in her be-ringed hand; "now then: we've oceans of -time for a pretty drive on the flats. What say'st thou, Flower de luce? Aw! charm- ing creature!" lifting his fur cap from his brown curls and bowing low to the girl in the window. "I wonder now is that the volume Miss Adeliza assured me was a work of thrilling interest, called 'The Bucketful of - Blood; or, The Maiden's Revenge'"'  C"Ohandos," replied Bertha, reprovingly, " aren't you ashamed to make fun of the lady upon whom  you have this instant betowed your most killing smile.

You keep quiet, Bertha. I am going to rejoice the cockles of her heart with what she dearly loves-a morceau de gossip. Good morning, Miss Petingill, have you heard the news?" As naughty -Chandy drew in the horses to spealk to the ancient spinster, picking her way along the snowy path with elevated petticoats, and spectacles on fore- head, Bertha wondered what bit of mischief he was about to perpetrate. She knew it was mischief, because, although his mouth was quite grave, his brown eyes gleamed with fun. "News. law me! what's happened now?," squealed she, nibbling the bait at once. "Perhaps I ought not to speak of it; I -know it will go no further-very sad-but my excellent brother-in- law has been monstrously caned." "Massy on us! caned? How drefful queer."  She opened her lips as square as the other member of the sisternity who was told that girls with large mouths were to get, by a new law, two husbands. "Who done it . how did it happen-quarrelling, I 'spose. I allers said that Dr. Groenveldt was a hard-headed critter." "I am afraid you are right. Don't mention it from me--but they had some words, arid I was told they were all very red in the face. It took him by surprise, so that he could not defend himself." "Who was't, do tell." The spinster clutched the young fellow's arm with her snuffy fingers, fearful that    E1.--   176  ,SLEIGHNG OoN THE FLiATS., some freak might take him off before she had got the name, and absolutely panted with eagerness. He leaned toward her, and whispered a couple of words which caused her to loose her hold and lift her hands in astonishment. "You must promise me not to, speak of it-delicate thing, trying occurrence-all in the family, you know I " "No, indeed; I shan't breathe a word. I can keep a secret, if I do say it that hadn't ought to. Caned- well, I declare! Peculiar! how folks can--" "Why, Chardos! what do you mean?" said Bertha; how could you impose on that poor old creature with such a ridiculous tale? Positively, I think I ought to insist that you shall turn back and undeceive her. Before night it will be town-talk!" "What, when she promised secrecy! It is true, however, Otho did get, caned; but don't say a word "about it till we get Miss Petingill's version, which is sure to be current in twenty-four hours. Look at the speed she is making. Yes, I thought so: Mrs. Deacon Williams is to be the first recipient. The three black crows will be nowhere." Bertha thought a moment with puzzled face. She knew it was some joke of Chandy's, some quib of double meaning. Suddenly she looked up ,merrily. "Oh, Chandy, I understand; you had better squelch the story, tkough, because you are sure to have four people very angry with you." Will you be one of the four, Bertha?5. , "No, of course not-though I don't approve of such jokes   -     Dm8LEIGBINQ ON s  'TS FLATS   1" 'Well, I shan't go and shoot myself ,about the rest. I like your face in that scarlet hood; I like your eyes too, even when they look reproof at me--you are such a good, stable, restful friend; it seems -odd that you should desire the companionship of that little Spaniard. "I have never been in the habit of thinking of whinms, caprices, freaks, and fancies as part of the furniture of Bertha's mind. Your friendship is as delicate in its demands as it is ample in its. performances. Im afraid my rounded period was polished for me, but it suits- you. How crisp and cheering the air is! I saw you yesterday cracking walnuts with your white teeth. You mustn5t do it again-what if you were to-break one! Ah! here comes Jan- now, and it likes my Sweet-and-twenty; we'll have a little spurt of a race." The two-mile course of dead level and -smooth road- way,s running past Brookedge and skirting Roaring River, was a favorite gathering-place for our friends; and afforded the scene of some of their most enjoyable winter pleasures. I suppose there was never a town of the size which could boast so many good horses as this, and exceeding proud were the solid owners of their possessions. There was Peter Bradshawpere, a regular horse-fancier, and Peter j4ls, who followed dutifully in his parent's footsteps; Jan Vedder, who kept his favorites like princes; Captain Slocum, though- he still retained his ancient liking for the round-bellied-, red-eyed cow-ponies, also owned fast American trot- ters, who dwelt in royal quarters, and had their grooms sleeping at their feet; the Craigenfels steeds, whom- Thomas jealously kept up with the best,nising: free@ly    OlI  178    r, lRTTffHN G o THE FLATs. the carte blanche his master gave-lhim as to price and number; and besides these a host of others worth driv- ing. The young ladies all owned ponies and handled them skilfully, believing sincerely in their chivalry and prowess, knowing of what they boasted. A gayer sight can scarcely be imagined than one of . their sleighing carnivals : the handsome sleighs, costly robes, and showy afghans; the bright, animated faces of the beautiful women, their perfection of dress; the real manhood disporting itself with unbent brows and cor- dial fun-lighted faces, fairly earned by accomplished brain and hand work. The gay salutations among old friends tried and trues passing-and repassing -over the beaten snow with " chime chime, chime,  and a sort of Runic rhyme " of the merry silver bells. Even I, old and plain as I - am, who usually keep the outside track among elderly ones in barouche sleighs, and plodding, sober horse-flesh, have experienced extremest delight in the enlivening scene, and craned my neck exten- sively to get a view of the fast trotters in the centre row, and joined the eager applause which greeted the winner. The sport was infectious, and butchers' boys and marketmen who came down to tarry a moment on the outskirts, and look on, would turn into the current w ith stiffened elbows and squared shoulders, and urge their beasts to their mettle. Indeed, I have seen Sa- brina Bradshaw the queenly, and the timid dove Susie,' putting their trust in Providence and their escorts, neck an d neck with Tom the grocer lad, or Starbird ad P:edlow?s fancy cart on half runners.    t '7      GHSLEIGCH.  ON THE . LATS.  179 This especial day they had a particularly good time; because his old parishioner, Peter Bradshaw, having bestowed upon the Rev. Frederic Rutter Growing a son of Dainty Pet, he had come to Roaring River, ex- pressly to look his gift-horse in the mouth, and take him home, as tickled as a boy with a sweetheart; and he felt moved to try his paces among his first flock, where he had first essayed his own as Pastor-; and there he was in the centre row, as earnest and intent and eager in the careful guidance of the high-bred animal, as he habitually was in watching the spiritual running of the souls in his care in their heavenly race; and he held the spirited colt well in hand, as he did his church government; thoughtful, with compressed lips, as if writing a sermon, and again kindly, with a joyous glow, experiencing the intensest pleasure amidst the joyful greetings he continually got from the devoted friends who lhad never ceased to love and respect him. There were  one o r two who remembered the plain unvarnished tale Ernest Laprise had told once of a Saturday evening, when John Nickson had been the mouthpiece of the committee for dissolving the pastorali relation, and they were forcibly reminded of " the plucky race at Dodd's Four Corners." Brookedge was just midway on the flats, and Mrs. Jan's friends were often to be found assembled at her pleasant home, and they not unseldom finished their sleighing with a social tea-drinking, and a Shakespeare club or an informal party in the evening. Our good, steady, quiet Bertha , sitting beside handd- some-Chandy, got many pleasant sm iles, an,:h -?::  I 180   S TrFGHNG ON THE 'LATS. you would scarcely believe -it, she was so filled with the spirit of the gay carnival that she desired to pass everybody, and did actually flit by Johnny Hauxhurst, who had -finished his stint of shoe-making, and come sleighing with the betrothed Susie, instead of going to his office. Then they just skipped by Aunt Elinor (she was driving' the Howadji, and had for once forgotten speed in the wondrous charm of his pleasant stories), and they flew alongside of the minister, and after a spirited trot beat him by a double length, just before the turn; then Bertha waved her hand to the van- quished, and if her merriment was exceeding quiet, it was to the full as enjoyable as Chandy's uproarious mirth, who pulled his fur cap off his brown curls and fired a quiver full of quotations after his quondam shepherd. Cabby had gotten his horses out of pawn for the day, through the good nature of inine host of the Millville House, and, elaborated into his nqbbiest overcoat and shiniest beaver (both unpaid for), he was sleighing the dear" in the person of the divine Adeliza, toward whom, since Peace Pelican's rebuff, he had been turn- ing his eyes matrimonially, trying, to nerve himself up to an offer. They attracted a good deal of notice through the gorgeousness of their apparel, and the boys who lined the track applauded with unabated ardor every time they dashed past. It was whispered that Esquire Hitchcock was :tired of his hatchet-faced daughter, and had privately offered Gabby an interest in his business if he would gently remove her from the paternal mansion to his    ST JrGT N- ON -THE FLATS     181 husbandly protection. Let us do Cabby the justice-to say that he dreaded the plunge, and hiris aspect was dreary and blank, sitting beside the tall, gaunt,: chalky- cheeked charmer, who had long ago gotten by heart the touching appeal- "Oh to feel the breath which comes through a soft mustache, To lean my head on a manly breast, without being considered rash "   "Evenin'," called out Captain Slocum, as his nephew came abreast of -the cow-ponies; "how is your souset Evenin', Miss Hitchcock; this is the kind of weather to make- folks noses red, ain't it?" and he added in a dis- gusted tone to Dulcet, "I wonder if that creatur is making up to Dolphy; she couldn't fetch her pigs to a much wus markets. ' I don't like your mode of expression, captain,; of course she is not ' making up to him:' women are- not supposed to:be the wooers; I have heard that, he visits her'. . "Humph! he don't look eat up with her, does the? She- 'pears to be doin' all the talkin'."      At "You mustn't be severe in animadverting upon your nephew, my dear; even if he is to your mind unviri-  potent, he is extremely stylish and quite ornamental," : : replied Dulcet, who was in her most complacent humor, having the youngest of the seven in her lap; and I am  sure it is quite natural for Adeliza to desire to have : a husband and home of her own ; I have been a happy  woman since you married me."  "I- s'ose 'tis kinder natural for women to hanker: -J.     '182   S RLUGffINff 'ON TE 'FLATS, after matrimony, and if they was all as smart as you be they couldn't help having good times keepin' house and so on; but them two, law! they don't know enough to come in when it rains; nary on 'em." Dulcet was silent a moment, thinking of her maiden estate, her poverty, and hard times; and gratitude and real love filled her breast for the kind, whole-souled man who had taken her to his arms and kept her like a queen; and she squeezed a little closer to the shaggy overcoat which enwrapped his wiry figure, and looked extremely contented and comfortable. a I suppose you are aware, captain, that Dolphy de- sires to estivate with us; I referred him to you, it being out of my department." "I guess'it is out of mine, too, by the sound on't," re- plied the captain, looking down at his wife with a good- natured grin. "You'll have to talk English if you want me to understand; I've been thinking I should sometimes come to the end of your big words; but, I vum! I believe the stock is inexhaustible. You look -pretty trig in your new furs, don't you." "My beautiful sables! Yes, dear husband, you are very, very kind to me." 'Well, 'tain't hard work to be kind' to a good wife, Dulcet; -I believe we take about all the comfort the- law allows. What was that awful thing Dolphy was contrivin' up ." "' Estivate' was the word I used; it means pass the summer.  "No, sir; he don't pass no summers in my house. I've got through, after furnishin' him with money for  HVsSO N TISPLAT S. 183- months, and he ridin' round, playin' billiards, and such, never tryin' to earnhis salt. I believeI ought to speak to Hitchcock; he's a sharp old file, and knows the young scapegrace jlst as well as I do; I wonder he don't put a stop to it. Look up, here, young one; don't make you sick to ride, does it " As this was a pleasantry the captain was wont to indulge in, his good spouse smiled appreciatingly, and bent down and kissed little Jessy, who had been christened "Ludoveca Clotildetta Jasaminta," by the -Rev. Mr. Growing. Bertha forgot all her worries over the coming guest, and'basked in the rich'friendliness, racy fun, and - abounding variety Chandy was so affluent in; and it was not till he consulted his watcherad turned unwill- ingly out of the swift current, that the disturbed look crepthack into her eyes, and the smiles settled chilly around her heart. Dolores was standing disconsolately waiting, when the steaming horses stopped at the long platform. The departing engine sent back arewell snorts, and a long trail of blackness, which dropped around her drooping figure, shrouding it like a pall. She put out both hands when Chandy came up, like a grieved child, and her eyes were full of tears.           I "I thought you came. not at all," said she, and I am so tired." ,- "What! one more unfortunate, weary of breath " replied Chandy, holding her fingers andloo]irng at her. Perhaps he .was thinking-'of the thousand pleasant nothings which' had been wont to embellish his talk i  '.  ' '"   w mar area d AJLAL c. with her when he was away from home, floating hither and thither amongst amusing travels; perhaps he was :   wondering if she remembered them--or was likely to repeat them to her friend. Bertha; perhaps he was wishing he had -been less prodigal of the pretty speeches, which came as naturally through his lips, when in the company of agreeable women, as his sweet, healthy breath. He tossed away the instant's un- pleasantness, whatever it was, with a gay laugh. A It is too bad, poor Dolores, but Bertha alone is to blame; she has been out trotting horses on the Flats and I had hard work to fetch her from her favorite amusement. You must frown on her.   I deserve smiles. I always keep time'like a watch. Is it not so? What sayest thou,- Flower de Luce "A  sharp pain hurt Bertha, hearing this-he had been used to so name /her-and she stood silently back, evidently second best in Dolores' mind, as proved by her conduct, for, after she had exchanged kisses and greetings, she gave all her attention to handsome Chandy. She saw him last in a brigand hat and feather, when Sam: had told him he resembled a "retired pirate;" and his clear-cut artist face seemed fresher and pleas- anter than ever, beneath the tall fur cap sitting above his- clustering curls. Bertha, with Sir John's quotation in her mind, and watching how the guest's whole sense was concentred a-f - upon him, said to herself: "She is rashy importunate to persist in thrusting herself into the presence of my friend;" and while she observed her piquant grace, and  the little gloved   SLEIBGHNf SQN THE FtLATS.    18T S hands she had wilfully crossed upon the friend's arm, somehow there arose a ghastly memory of Basswood Pond and this passionate face: gazing up at her from its waveless depths.  - Her eyes met Chandy's, freighted with-her thought, and he swept off the clinging touch, almost rudely. "Do you remember, Bertha," whispered he, drawing her aside, " the dream I told you of . Well, that was her very look. Come, hasten, take your friend into the waiting-room and I will try if I can't get- rid of the uncanny glance looking after the baggage.2' Pretty soon he returned. "By the poppy-colored whiskers of -Mahomed's fifth wife!" exclaimed he. ' You little Catholic, I must charter an express-wagon to trundle up your furniture i  couldn't you pray as well on a Craigenfels cushion") \ "Indeed, no, Chandos, because my prie Dieu has been blessed of the Pope; and our Lady Superior, a very great devout mugir, made her prayers upon it for twenty years; and the Holy :Mother of Sorrows once did drop upon it two tears from her sacred eyes, which the nuns cut out of the taffeta and kept in a silver caxita; I have also these, and will show you the little stain. How could I leave it behind me when I was to come where there were no church-people, but only heretics and Padre Loyola admonished me I must keep great watch upon my true religion.' Chandos heard her through, with his eyes fastened upon her face, and. a sort of regretful kindness akin to pity possessed him, and showed in his altered manner, "We must take great care of this child, Bertha- that   186    SLEIGHNG ON TH E PLATS. she comes to no harm among us misbelieving ones. -: * tCome, friend of my soul, let's bring her home." "But you shall first tell me you are glad I am come," said Dolores wilfully. u "Glad! That does not express the poignancy of my emotions. 'Je suis ravi,' and Bertha is ravi also; are you not, Bertha a. Now, then, hide your little feet in this soft fur; what a lucky bear to get promoted to such a neighborhood! Pull down your veil, for two reasons: first,;,so that you shall not dazzle the passers-by with the bewildering splendor of your dark eyes' witching spell; and-next, because this north wind is exceeding keen, un- tempered by softening sunbeams. It cuts like a friend's unkindness. Are you comfortable, Bertha? not cold? sure?" Retracing the way to Craigenfels, Miss Groenveldt kept nearly silent, listening to the chatting trifles her neighbor poured into Chandy's ears, her souvemimrs  of their foreign life and ship-board experiences; watch- ing the play of- her long eyes; the vivid, sudden brilli- ancy of her glances, slowly dropping her lids, and flash- ing them open again, shooting forth a blazing light, then softly veiling their effulgence; she remembered the trick of feature well. The maiden had it as a child, and used to bestow the passionate looks, innocent of their power; but somehow Bertha did not so much admire them as she used in the old school days, and it irked her to have to sit by. and be obliged to fancy the secenes Dolores' talk conjured before her, and, though she preserved the semblance of politeness toward the new guest, she did not enjoy her advent.

Dolores, what thinkest thou is Zeus doing among the Rose Bays .of Andalusia? '  "I do not understand,' replied Dolores appealing to Bertha. "I know not him-Zeus." Truly, it was but a small matter for contentment, this simple ignorance of the Spanish maid, but Bertha was glad. "I am not beautiful, like her," said she to - herself.- "I am not witty, I have not seen the world, but I understand Chandos better than she--I am used to him; I know what he means by all his queer non- sense, I can comprehend his quotations, and I feel how much his pretty speeches are worth;" and while Sir John laughed at Dolores' arched brows and pursed lips, ,she answered, "He only asks you, in the Chandy manner of putting questions, what weather it might happen to be in Spain," Uncle Alec received the stranger in his grand, courteous way, and he ejaculated! a"Oh, Lord!" .under his breath when he looked in her face, and also -men- tally recited one of Goethe's sayings: "It will do to make mistakes while we are young, but they mustn't last to old age-; old whims are useless, unpleasant lumber." The kind-hearted gentleman had ceased to desire the beautiful blonde, whom Dolores brought vividly before him in the gorgeous affluence of her  wondrous beauty, but he still indulged a sigh over, the empty place she had left in his heart.

He attended personally to her comforts, and appointed her a chamber among his favorites-such a pretty room, all blue and gold, when theprie Dieu was duly installed, ready for eve- Ding devotions.   CHAPTER XV. CAPTAIN 'SLOCUM 'AND THE COW-PONIES. S9^  HiE last ball of carpet-rags was completed, and Sabrina having promised Mary McCross to take them over to Dead Hollow for weaving, where dwelt an old woman under the hill, the owner of a hand-loom, ordered out her colts directly after breakfast. Penhurst heard the comm, a, and also the little talk with Thomas about the sleighing on Hog's Back, and lingered about, wishing to get a sight at her, and perhaps a word or two before she started. Pretty soon she came into the library, robed in pur- ple and sables, and stepped in her free, stately way up to the grate, where she stood drawing on her fur gloves, and discussing the length, breadth, and thickness of the projected fabric withl Aunt Elinor, who held in her hands the desired stripe wound on a shingle, of which she counted the threads; and while he listened with a good deal of amusement to the earnestness of purpose they put into the business, which seemed 'such. a bagatelle to him, he watched Miss Bradshaw, admir- ing her completeness and the self-poise of her attitude and gestures. He had seen women of --all nations, and knew quite well the difference between his country-   190 OA;P".  s oc  u : TU A.2 J fOPO gIi. i .  women and others in regard to independence and'free- dom, and so was not shocked at her ready undertaking of -schemes, and diligent pursuit of the same, unaided by creation's lords; there being nothing strong- minded, or abrupt, or masculine about' her, or any reaching. out of women's sphere after men's duties, but only a conscious strength and ability in, her own. Presently a clangor of bells announced the colts, and Sabrina walked to the window to look at them; the gentleman followed her. "Do you drive alone, this morning?" asked he. "Yes, alone with my carpet-rags," replied she, smil-  ing. "Business of importance takes me over the hills and far away." "Would you permit a fellow, who thinks no small beer of his horsemanship, to manage your pretty team for once? - Or do you dread any influence upon their * -;  hearts beside your own? They are handsome fellows." "I think they are; and they. know me quite too well toswerve- from their allegiance for a slight cause. Do I understand Mr. Penhurst to offer his services, as  coachman . Are you the fellow who thinks no small beer of himself    ,   '-  ." The very same; and as such most mannerly de- mand the leave to accompany you; I sh6ould like of all things to visit Dead Hollow." "I camlot wonder at that; it is indeed a rare place," replied she, laughing.

The- Bradshaws at home he especially desired to see. iHe had ideas of his own- as to family management, and though he was prepared to think the' best concerning the kindred of this enchanting girl, he had also a curiosity to see with his own eyes the position she held in her home, and examine the fashions and lik- ings of her progenitors, as, illustrated by their sur- roundings. , !  tlHalf way down Craigenfels mountain they met i Captain Slocum, who was posting at top speed of the cow-ponies-to pay them a  visit. "Mornin',' he called out, using his strength upon the mouths of the hard-bitted beasts, who snorted, and tossed their wild manes, and rolled their red e;yes at the colts.

"As there are a good many at large who answhr to your general description, you will have to be more individual." . ' Why that O'Gorman--drunken dog!--he took and denounced us last Sunday in church.

Darn his picture! He was down on the common schools, too, and threatened the ignorant folks he rules with a rod of iron, keepin' their noses to the grindstone, for fear they'll begin to think for themselves'; that if they dared to send their young ones anywhere 'cept to his catechism shop, he wouldn't let 'em have any more children, and sca irt the innocent creatures half to death for fear he would cuss wlwhat they had got, and kill 'erm. Yes, sir, they were just fools: enough to be-  lieve that a few mumbling words out of that fellow's mouth could hurt 'em. And this mornin' there's rumors floatin' among our men that they mean .to do some on us a mischief. Flannigan told me, he says his little darter dotes on Miss Bradshaw, and- he couldn't bear to thinlk of her gittin' any harm." Pen not apprehending much serious disturbance, ;    such strong faith had he in his own countrymen arrd  .the power of law, watched the young lady at his side ,  2' .

"He inflamed the minds of his- people with false statements concerning the ' Home for- the Friendless,' told them that children were stolen, torn from their mother's breast, and carried out West, where they grow up not knowing each other; and in- troduced a horrible tale of a brother who married his sister in consequence. Though he advocated no vio- lence, his speech was very much in the spirit of- one; a priest made his flock about the Orangemen : "' The dirty blackguards is going down the ford, to- morrow,'said he; 'be sure ye're there, me boys; and donrt ye take yer shillelahs wid ye's, because ye might be hittin' eem if ye should.'

I should admire to have 'em know 'a' from -' ' 'iZxard '-; but, you see, just as soon as they know what they are about, -they can't manage 'em. I vum! it would make a dog laugh (if he didn't think better of't, and beller) to think of the young ones bein' stole; poor little vagabonds,picked out of the slums, and buried in filth so as we had to dig 'em out with a hoe; boys and girls that never had a clean face nor a decent meal in their lives; and when we've washed 'em up, and fed 'em, and hunted out somebody that is willin' to take 'em in and try to love 'em, they begin to holler ' out ' stealin'.' Why didn't they take care on 'em themi- selves, if they're so dreadful fond on 'em. ,But, no! y ou'll always notice that they don't start no charities nowhere unless we begin first; as long as they can keep their folks quiet, and know nothin', they don't trouble themselves, and all the Orphan Asylums and things is only to get the poor young ones out of the reach of knowledge. The more Catholic religion there is in a country the, more ignorant the mass of the people are. That's so the world over., "They do occasionally take care' after their own fashion. Father O'Gorman used to stand close by the door with a whip when we first commenced our Syla- bub Mission, threatening any who dared to enter; and he 'did his best to break up our temperance society, forbidding the boys to have anything to do with it, and setting on the mothers, so that some of 'our poor lads underwent a regular persecution for th!e sake of trying '-   . to keep sober."  ;:   - . ,- "Well, you can't wonder at that," interrupted the   e   ' CAPTAI; SLOCUM AND  THEV COW-POXIES.' I195 captain, "'cause you lmow it sp'ilt his :liquor trade, cut into his profits. Perhaps you ain't aware that the rev- erend father is partner in a rum business." "O yes; everybody knows that. I thought a good deal about the proper course to take,:and after a while I went to a young priest, and asked him why a spirit- ual leader, who was supposed to desire the best good 7} of his flock, should 'set his face against a reform so greatly needed, and which was doing such a good work for his young men. I must confess that although I had heard much of the power -of the priesthood, I I,  did not realize its iron rule 'till I began to work among our boys. In fact, it is impossible for. a Protestant to take in the abject depths of submission exacted by " ^them, and I very nearly laughed at the man when he i told me Father O'Gorman could squelch our society if I he chose; and'being pressed for a reason why he ob- jected to getting sober communicants instead of drunken ones, he coolly informed me that 'the- church chose to keep all such matters in her own hands! ' Iheard afterwards that he thought Susie, who went with me, would make a nice Sister of Mercy, and in- fact sent her some books leading toward such a result; but he' did not in the least approve of me, setting me among I  the unpleasant, strong-minded, who dared to ask ques- I  tions."

The Lord have mercy on our 'bodies, to say nothin' about our souls, if that dark day ever comes. 'Let the scarlet woman loose, backed with bigotry, superstition, and power, and we shall find out to our bitter cost what-a spirit the true church car- ries in her holy bosom. Verily, her tender mercies were, cruel when she had full swing, and I don't s'pose she's improved any great with age." f' Nonsense, captainl " interrupted Pen. "That, time 'll never come. Don't you know the second gen- eration are mighty hard customers to manage; just as soon 'as they get a few ideas into their heads they begin to hold them up. Our free institutions are an- tagonistic to all darkness and secrecy, all confessionals and man-pardons. If we push straight on, educating the- multitude who flock to us, they will Iknow what things are worth. They will begin to realize that holi- ness means: pure living, not taking communion; that prayer is asking God for what they want, not mum- bling a lot Of sing-song, which takes no hold ofl their needs; that a priest who lies, steals, swears, and gets drunk is a despicable animal, even beneath the sacred vestments.' Don't be disturbed, Captain Slocumn; the God of ouir fathers will never suffer us to lose our goodly heritage, if we show ourselves worthy to keep it." ';,'There's- the, rub," -replied the captain. "When our best folks don't half of 'em vote, and never take no   CAPTAIN  SLOM    TEL .CO-PO  S. Po. l't part in the administration of ithe government, I tell you it looks squally. They're secret, they're unnin,' they never get tired of wormin' round ; they justify the means by the end.'  "You are quite right, Captain Slocum," said Sa- brina. "There is danger, and it lies in the power of the priest over the people. Oh, if only they were such good devout men as they might be! but they .are not-at least, many of them. I was in Merry Bank last year, and came a good deal in contact with Father St. John, and extremely agreeable I found himn-well read, witty, polished, a real Irish gentleman outside; but his doings as a pastor leading the people to heaven, made me unhappy-so tricky, so domineering, so un- feeling! For instance, one Sunday he took up aa col- lection for the church, but having occasion to use the money in repairing his own house, the next Sabbath I   h lie called for more.

But some of the American Celts grumbled, and set on O'Brien to consult a lawyer, and try if-they couldn't make the priest smart for his overbearing conduct. They were informed that they certainly could, and were about to take some steps toward-it; but St. John heard of their proceedings, and the following Sunday he made all right by telling his people he had a hot temper, which wouldn't bear crossing; and they were tickled with his funny way of putting it, and readily reinstated him in his domi- nant place, considering the affair a capital joke." You see, Captain," said Penhurst, " there was a lit- tle leaven, and it is sure to work, and after a while it must leaven the whole lump. Those men's children, taught to read and to think, will be extremely likely to. strike back.'               - "Well, I hope it will all come out right," said the captain, shaking his head. "'Some trust in horses and some in chariots, but we will remember the name of the Lord, our God.' Mornin', and look out you don't get a sharp stun agin your noddle, nor a club at your back ;' raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame.'"' The captain-- turned the necks of the headstrong cow-ponies, and departed, pursuing the current of his reflections.     O'HAPTE    XV'I. THE LAST RACE OF BABRINA'S COLTS. THE pretty creatures were in gay spirits, and trotted swiftly to their bell music, and the sleighers enjoyed the brisk pace, the bracing air, and it may be each other's neighborhood. The de- vious road to Dead Hollow, over Hog's Back, was bor- dered with alders and larches, biding their time of coming greenery. Petrifying spring had been all win- ter quietly at work piling up drop by drop a fantastic ruin of gothic pillars, minarets, fringed acanthus, and diamond frost-work, solid and light, feathery and gro- tesque, which the sun colored for our pair of admirers with all the pretty hues he has used since the creation, as they flitted past; then under covered bridges, where little winds ambushed and kissed their faces, rattling the posters' boasting remedies for fleshly ills, pitiful (reminders of human infirmities; down the glen where the busy forges and trip-harnmers and heavy engines were pounding their prey. I never pass those remorseless workers," said Pen- ,hurst, " without being reminded of Dumas' reflections upon the impassibility of machines, especially those employed for beating metals. Whenever they manage   200  THE LAST RACE OF SABRIZAS COLTS. to seize anything, it has to go. If it happens to catch your finger when you offer it an iron bar, and you do not withdraw it quick enough, you may cry out; but if no friend chances to be at hand with a hatchet who will take pity on you and chop your wrist, the arm follows the hand, then the body, and the shortest plan for your friends is to look for you at the other end of the machine. You went in a man, you come out a wire. In fve minutes you grow two hundred feet." "Come, fly on, brave steeds--shish! Fine Ear, Lux is leading you," said Sabrina. "Let us leave the ghastly association in the background. How cruel of you, Mr. Penhurst, to throw  such a horrid fancy among the beauties of our fairy glen. Now try if you can't origi- nate something more amusing." Pen opened his mouth and began to troll out Dr. Donne's verses, to which his neighbor listened with curious pleasure; first settling some conventional scru- ples, as "what might Mrs. Grundy say to a song in day-time, driving through the country?" "Come, live with me, and be my love, And we will some new pleasures prove Of golden sands and crystal brooks, With silken lines and silver hooks. Ahi lady dear, use no deceit, For thou thyself art thine own bait; That fish that is not catched thereby Is wiser far, alas! than I." -  A  fair song, sir, and reasonably well sung, but out of season," said Miss Bradshaw, her cheek pranking itself with rose-tints, and her eyes glancing aside from   THE LAST RAN 'OF SABRINAS COLTS. 201 the look the singer gave her. "The- crystal brooks are all frozen, and the fish safe from your silver hooks. You must try again.'" "Shall Hahem--I've a cold. I'm out of practice; please excuse me, really." She laughed at the mincing affectation he mimicked, and the small voice he piped in, like the schoolboy's rendering of poor Caesar's drowning cry, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink." And she listened in charmed quiet, while he sang an old wife's chant: "I married a wife of late, The more unhappy so my fate. I married her for love, As did my fancy move. But she died in spring  When birds take wing, With flowers stuck in her winding sheet.' ": That is odd, now," he concluded, after a moment's 'Frt"  silence ;" what ever made me think of that musty rhyme? My mother used to put me to sleep with it. Our heads are queer caskets, aren't they? One never knows what forgotten rubbish will pop to the surface next.") Sabrina wondered how it was possible that he did not couple the song with his poor Annie-he who had so lately married and lost a wife, and was out of pa- tience because he evidently felt no personal application to his affliction. She glanced at the fine beaver he wore, and had a great mind to ask him why he ignored and neglected the time-honored "weed," which ought to mark him a bereaved and sorrowing widower; but he /            202  THE LAsT RACE Op SARBIJTAiS COLTS. broke in upon her reflections with a merry whistle and exclamation- "There goes a hare. If I had my gun, I'd try a shot for Miss Bradshaw's dinner. And I'd cook it myself in old Port, premising that Deb would lend me her ki tchen"  "You forget that we are to be papa's guests to-day; and though it is possible you might have hit the hare, I should rather not stake my chance of a meal upon that accident. See this sheltered nook of a dell, and that towering cliff yonder! Our Chandy got a lesson in -ground and lofty tumbling amongst those bushes once, and we were fearfully near losing the gay playfellow we like so much. They brought him down here and laid him on the grass--" While she detailed the rash hunt for a mouchoir, which had cost Sir John a sprained ankle and a month's confinement, Mr. Penhurst pondered her words,( our C:handy," " gay playfellow," and'he was put right on a point which had troubled him. Notwithstanding the warm interest his fun-loving adviser had always showed in his wooing, he could not help a trifle of uneasiness- in witnessing the terms of friendliness upon which the handsome fellow lived With, the Silver Lake' Goddess-their confidential walks and talks, their readings and sketchings; and had been by no means sure that an asking of his would not win a "yes" from the lady, dignified and self-poised as she. appeared.

The   T  MrE LAST RAaE OF SABRINA' S COLTS. 203T long street of rambling old-fashioned houses, bordered with elms whose bare arms interlocked and overarched - them, looked extremely pleasant to Mr. Penhurst in the light of his new revelation, and he watched with warm interest the young lady in the prosecution of her business, standing beside the old loom, and explaining her wants to the garrulous anciente, who made dimfl- culties for the pleasure of using her cracked voice, which too seldom got a listener. He admired the concentra- tion of Sabrina's faculties upon her errand, her under- standing of the out-of-the-way machine, and the grace- ful ease with which she put the whole affair out. of mind as soon as arranged, and took up the first topic he offered her en route for Roaring River. The young lady had been deeply moved by Captain Slocum's com- munication, and her senses were more than usually alert, her face more than habitually expressive; her rich blood, coursing swiftly, kindled her clear cheek with a healthy ecarnation beneath its hue of pure marble, and she laughed in her own tuneful fashion, and talked freely, m aintaining her opinions with pointed decision and -Ike   dash, and sufficient reasons. Pen hugely enjoyed the rest of the drive, and was able to recall much of the conversation afterwards; and also found many things i,=?; ' 'to ponder which infused vigor and power into his re- solves, making him feel the value of work, and the beauty of work, even among the trifles necessary in completing a harmonious whole. :     TThe rag carpet, as a means of grace, was a new phase of luxury, and he began to launch out into plans for  libraries, lyceums, schools, and their confreres, i Can- 4 ' tA  ,          l   204  THE LAST BACE OF SABRINA'S COLTS. adasset, fired with enthusiasm quite unfelt in his pre- vious; good works; and he saw very clearly that there were ways to serve God besides the lawful " diligence in business." Sabrina was always proud of her home, and it ap- peared xceeding sumptuous and enjoyable in her eyes, as her spirited colts turned gayly into the winding drive- way, and did their prettiest in dashing up to the mansion. Although the vast pleasure-grounds and beautiful lawn were hidden beneath a snow mantle, the trees .leafless and bare, and the pretty Alderneys wanting to embellish the picture, the noble conservatories were affluent in gorgeousness, and the great graperies purple with lumurious fruitage. There were no mist wreaths creeping up Craigenfels mountain, and the screaming loons had deserted the-frozen lake. Roaring River was asleep beneath its icy cover, but it needed only a' thought to clothe the whole scene in summer beauty. The elegant refinement and delicate loveliness of her fair-haired mother had never seemed more womanly perfect to Sabrina than when she presented her to the guest, looking at her through his eyes, putting herself in his place; and the solid heartiness of the model -farmer, whose true daughter she was, more than satisfied her, as he welcomed the guest with American hand- shaking, and his own whole-hearted cordiality. Pauline, mindful of the fracas which Mr. Penhurst had adjusted and the boy he had conquered, showed exceeding pleasure in his coming, and seized on himn as soon as her elders gave her the chance.   THEl LAST BACE'OP ASARRIN'S COLTS.   205: "Come and see General Grant's kittens, said she, slipping her hand into his. "What! has the great warrior made you commander- in-chief of his feline forces," replied Pen, good-natur- edly following her lead. "I do not know what you mean by such hard words. She is not a great warrior: she is a kind cat; she sings. General Grant is handsome; she is yellow and black; she is out in the barn in a tub; she has got two kitties, beauties, with their eyes open! She was a kitten herself last year; we had two, Miss Filer gave them to us, with double paws, and we named one General Grant and the other Anna Diclkinson; General Grant has got kittens; Anna Dickinson hasn't; he isn't a kind cat; he scratches and: bites; we don't like him. We will let you name our little ones if you want to; won't we, Gracie?." "Thanks," answered Pen, with a show of gratitude befitting the honor. "We will take a look at them first, if you please." "Well, now, aren't they lovely? You mustn't touch them; General Grant-don't like meddlers; what shall we name them?"  "What would you say to Nebuchadnezzar and Bel- teshazzar to begin with?." 'f Too long, aren't they, Gracie; we'd have to call  those Granny and Dickey for short.", g"Well, you can abbreviate into Nebby and -Belty, you know." ' Yes, said Pauline, "that sounds pretty good; don't it, Gracie."  "Rather,"5 replied Gracie doubtfully, "seems to me   206 STEr LAST RAcE OF SABRIN'S COLTS. I'd sooner have ' Whitefoot,' or 'Dash,' or some such; ; they make me think of nicer fun. Nevercould--what is it?--sounds like Sunday, when I have to sit still, and papa reads in the big Bible, and I get so tired." ^"Suppose we consult the General," said Penhurst, giving the soft, rosy, round little girl a good squeeze. "A parent has a natural and inalienable right over her offspring, let's give her a voice." "She's got one" said Pauline; " she sings good, and you listen how she wilt answer me. ' Say, Granny, shall we name your kits for you?" The noble commander lifted her green eyes to her mistress and rolled over, placing her left paw above the top baby, and recommended the lot to the notice and ad- miration of her visitors by an enthusiastic purr, which said " you see how lovely they are?' plainer than any words. "The parent consents" said Pen; " therefore I think we may consider the ceremony completed; now the duty of proper training devolves upon you." There was the usual diversity of topics in the day's conversation, which is quite certain to find breath among theorists fond of reducing their theories to practice, and inventors fond of experimenting with their hobbies; and Sabrina listened to her father, whose practical sound sense, supported by general knowledge of the world's doings, was exceedingly satisfactory; and she unconsciously weighed in the opposite scale the guest-also a capitalist and worker. He was not found-wanting; and he looked well, too, especially when sitting on her mother's Eofa holding her worsteds and     2THE LAST RACE OF SBRITA'S COLTS. 20T jesting with her. She noticed that in all his fun he never forgot the deference which belonged to the little queen of the Bradshaw household. After dinner Peter pere took the guest out to the farm-yards to examine the stock; and Sabrina drew up her chair for a good comfortable talk with her pretty mamma, of whom she was very fond. The young people had not been half an hour in her ,presence when the lair-haired lady discovered that if Mr. Penhurst was not already a lover of her daughter, he was on the high load to become so. She could not so easily make certain, from her self-contained child's manner, whether the liking was mutual; so she -tried the virtue of words., "Mr. Penhurst is a fine-looking man, isn't he-? said she carelessly, " and remarkably well-bred."  -   4' Yes, mamma, I think so."  I -   "You find him quite- an acquisition to your (Craigen-  -  fels circle, I dare say; he seems very easily to fit into any position in which he happens to find himself." "Oh, yes, indeed; and he has sense enough to be en- tertaining without parade of effort; he is never tire- some; we all like him very mnuch."- "The Penhursts are a good family. I never knew much about them, but Elinor used to visit there when we were young girls, and was auntie to the children, as sheis fond of being to all pretty smart ones. Elinor had beautiful arms and a remarkably fine bust, and I used to think she knew how well she looked holding a baby. She was always cuddling some chubby thing   208   2lts LAST RA:E OF SA RRI2'AS COLTS. or other. Pity she never. had any of her own; she would have made a -splendid mother." " ow did it happen, mamma 8 She must have been extremely attractive in her youth-she's handsome now." "Her love did not love her," answered ]Mrs. Brad- shaw,- faint color tinging her delicate cheek; " and al- though she- had plenty of offers, she would listen to none of them." "She did quite right, I think, mamma. I believe a person loves- truly but once." "You are mistaken, my dear," Mrs. Bradshaw re- plied hastily. She lifted her eyes to her daughter's, with their habitual clear, true glance, and dropped them quickly again. "A, woman may love twice and be very happy with her second lover." Was it because a new sense was developed within her that Sabrina comprehended her mother's meaning, and so got a lkey to many things which had passed be- fore her. There was an album, with Fred Goldsmith's name in gold letters on the cover, full of sketches and fragmentary poetry, and old dried flowers carefully pinned between the leaves, and a curl of chestnut hair, among the treasures of Alice Craigenfels' girlhood. It was no hidden secret from  her noble husband, al- though it was carefully kept. Sabrina put her arm around the gentle lady, and drew her close with fond gesture. ,' Dear mamma., must we all have friends in heaven. to make us as sweet and precious as you are? I shall be obliged to hange my opinion a little.

You are newly interesting to me. You had lovers! you had a romance. Ali pretty mamma, you were very lovely; I wish I could have seen you; long curls over your shoulders-I know that from your pic- ture at Craigenfels. Your eyes could not have been brighter than they are at this minute, or more tender. They all wished to marry you, did they not? Would you mind telling me how it began and went on, and how you finally made up your mind to choose? I can not understand that; the choice, the giving up and dropping back into a secondary place, becoming a mere appendage to somebody, through a life and a ' relict' - after death, proclaimed and pointed out on a tomb- stone. Sabrina's manner was so unusual, so foreign to her habitual, collected, self-poised state of body and mind, being both passionate and unrestful, through the pro- tecting fondness she always manifested toward the frail mother, who sat among her children like a white ti  daisy among her buds, that the lady was emboldened  ;  coyly and half fearfully to ask a question.     L"Nay, you shall tell me something, darling. Some- time I will try to remember my youth for you; but now you shall speak your thoughts about this ]Mr, Pen- hurst.

"A widower! he does not look as if he had ever been married." "I have not wisdom to discern the particular signs matrimony leaves upon a man's face; but I assure you I am right. Aunt Elinor told me the whole sad his- tory. Mrs, Penhurst died- in Italy only a few weeks after her wedding. Peace is very fond of talking about her; they travelled together one summer-quite a'wonderful journey, I should suppose, from the num- ber of circumstances she remembers. In fact, it was" at the Mountain House that the engagement was made, when the party were stopping there." "Indeed! I wonder he did not speak to me of her. Widowers are mostly fond of harping upon their dead wives. - I find it really curious how many virtues and graces a woman will accrete in a man's mind as soon as the sod covers her," "Ah, mamma, you can also be severe with your sweet gentleness," replied Sabrina smilingly; " but I assure you that Mr. Penhurst never alludes to his lost Annie of his own free will, and [she frowned slightly] when he is forced to speak of her, it is not in terms of praise; quite the contrary." Now that her mother took her view of the subject, Miss Bradshaw felt more strongly than ever the want  in the gentleman she was studying; the singular incon- sistency of his unheard-of behavior ; and he was made to feel, upon his return, a decided change from the sprightly, easy, friendly freedom of her morning de-   TEE LAST RAGE OF SABSINAS COLTS.   2" meanor, and he watched her closely during the remain- der of the visit, trying to find out what it meant. The sun had gone down when they set out for Craigenfels, and Sabrina had entirely forgotten Cap- tain Slocum and his warning, in the interest and vari- ety of her day. She was silent, allowing Mr. Penhurst to drive her colts, and quite busy among her thoughts. Her father had showed her a plan for a new summer- house, and asked her opinion, and also to help him de-" cide whether it should be placed on Strawherry Hill, or on the edge of Alder Pond. And while she sat in her stately composure, with her hands hidden in her muff and her profile toward her companion, she looked so distant and reserved that he gave his attention to the horses, waiting her pleasure with a mannish disin- clination -to force the conversation. A rough cry aroused her, and directed her eyes to a group of half-grown lads who were holding a dog in their midst, and seemed teasing him with a newspaper; for they held one rattling about him, and he struggled to free himself from their clutches. "Hi! here comes the Daddy Pease man! Look out, boys; he'll be 'stealin' ye's, as he .did O'Hara, and shuttin' ye's up. Three groans for DaddyPease!" "That means me, I suppose," said Pen, "though I don't understand why they honor me with the eupho- nious appellation."- ' "It is the popular fiction. You know Mr. Pease is the head of the Mission, and the Catholic children are taught by their spiritual leaders that he goes about seeking whom he may devour, and filches helpless babes, which is so far true, that he has carried off many   212 2Atl LAST- RACE OP SA Y rEBVAS COLTS. hapless little ones from the dens of pollution, and re- stored them to humanity."  While Sabrina talked, she looked eagerly among the impudent, reckless faces; none of her scholars were there, and she breathed a sigh of relief and thankful- ness, They were newcomers in Millville, and not a living ,evidence that her work was vanity and vexation of spirit. Mr. Penhurst did not hear her answer. His- attention was centred upon the lads, and he drew in the colts suddenly. - "What are you about there, you young barbarians?" asked he authoritatively. aRHoora for Daddy Pease I Gatfer long-legs, if you want a little boy, now's your time to come." The red headed, big-mouthed reprobate who shouted out the offer threw up his arms, and fluttered his rags in ecsta- tic derision. Don't mind them, sir," said Sabrina, hastily observ- ant of Pen's kindling face; "they are only puppets played by older heads.') He did not mind the foolish taunt of the unpleasant youth;'he was watcling the others, busy with the yelping animal, and flung down the reins;, preparing to spring-amongst them and punish his tormentors, when with a furious push they let the-dog loose. -' St-boy!, Old stick in the mud, if that don't send your horse kiting, you may knock me down with a feather." Pen had no time to think which of the crowd spoke, or indeed to move from his place, before a sharp howl of pain and a sheet of flame flew across the -road, right under the colts' noses, who reared, and   THE -LAST RACE OF SABRINA'S COLTS.   2133' kicked, and plunged from side to side in frantic ter- ror. And the reckless irresponsibles, delighted with their feat, scrambled and jumped and yelled like mad creatures, while they dashed away with wild leaps. No words were exchanged between the couple, who- knew their peril. Pen picked up the slender straps of leather, which were of no more use than a spider's web to guide the poor frightened animals, upon whose obedience their lives depended. He tried his voice uselessly. A covered, bridge spanned their road, and he set his teeth and tried to pull them clear of its tim- bered sides. They whirled the light Portland sharply against it, with a violent shock which threw out their mistress, and dashed the gentleman head foremost into a snow-bank, and clattered on with the remains of the shattered sleigh knocking against their heels and wounding them. '      . "Are you hurt?" asked Pen, springing to his feet, and I   )crushing away the clinging snow which blinded him.

"Never mind I that is a curious answer to a direct civil question. I will mind; I desire to know the cause of this disaster. It looked like a spirit of the pit.

"I am sorry you insisted. I suppose it won't do for me to beg you to forget it?" She shuddered. Her face turned white like clear riarble, and the vivid carnelian glow burned deep in her eyes. "They ought to be hung!" she exclaimed. -"I quite agree with you, and have no doubt of their arriving in due time at that consummation. But the beast is probably dead by this time, and out of his mis- ery, and it is necessary for us to concentrate our ener- gies upon some plan for reaching Craigenfels.' "I shall walk, of course," replied Sabrina, still boil- ing with indignation.

"We will hasten on, then, if -you please." Pen darted an uneasy glance around him, inly won- dering if they had reached the end of Daddy Pease s reception; and he kept his senses alert. in the increas- ing darkness, and though he said nothing to alarm the swift-footed girl at his side, who seemed to feel no fear, he was truly glad when they put the great gate behind them and entered the Craigenfels' grounds. "That is a necessity of your mind, I suppose, said Sabrina, waiting for Penhurst to close the heavy bar- riers.

"It is a whim of mine, and I will be at your service presently."      - A queer, half-human sob, and a slight struggle in * her neighborhood, mingled with the creaking of the heavy hinges and the trampling of Penhurst's feet, and startled Sabrina. She peered about in the thickened darkness, but discovering nothing, she forbore to re- mark upon it, and quietly accepted his offered arm, and stepped swiftly lup the long avenue. She stopped an instant before entering the hall, and threw .her - tholghts backward over the way they had traversed.

Sam had been reading Jane Eyre," and proposed Bridewell for the word. Bertha, who sat back among the audience, had her eyes fixed upon the handsome face she loved. Her habitual quiet covered in the torturing thoughts which wounded her, and her cheek was a shade paler than usual. Chandos was looking at Dolores, as befitted the character he sustained. The newcomers paused in silent admira- 'tion an instant before the picture broke up like a dis solving view, and then Sabrina gave a spirited account of their adventure, and warmly seconded Uncle Alec's declaration that the offenders must be brought to jus- tice. "'Such wanton cruelty-such disregard of law!" exclaimed she; and Pen noticed that her love of jus- tice fully equalled her other womanly qualities, and though she felt no revenge,- she desired that the cul- prits should be made to feel the penalty of their evil deeds. She did not sit down, and as soon as she had fin- f ished her recital of the outrage, she stepped proudly away, her purple robes trailing, and her round cap of violet velvet sitting regally above the dead-gold braids of her abundant hair. She had made no moan over the fate of her horses, but he knew she was going to Thomas to speak about them, and start a search for the poor fellows, who had not been an instant forgotten by their mistress, though the interest of her story, her escape, and its bearings uplon the mission work and Sylabub humanity had hindered other minds from  ?-.    :     -HJ LASTiRACE Or SABRINA'S COLTS.   217  dwelling on their fate; he left them to continue their discussion, and followed- her.

Lights Were moving in the stable-yard, and away down among the trees by the big gate which Pen had shut, and young iTommy ran' against them just by the dove-cot; he was malking top speed to the house. "Oh, Miss Sabrina!" groaned he, "they'll have to kill Lux. Don't .come out, please; taLe her in, Mr. Penhurst. Oh dear! I was coming to tell you."

"There; they've finished poor Lux," said Tommy. "I'm glad he is dead, poor fellow!"  Sabrina shuddered. She knew- the sob she had 10    S - - 218        CB LAT RACE OR SBRIN'SI COLTS. fy! . caught was a dying effort of her faithful friend t -"X bring her to him.

Quick a thought, Thomas threw a blanket over the creature' hind-quarters, and covered from Sabrina's eyes a sigh which- would have haunted her forever. The old mal had, half a mind to sit down and cry also. The shapel head the woman's hand had patted a thousand time dropped back, and the bright intelligence which ha( welcomed her approach with human fondness died ou of the animal's eyes. Nobody spoke a word to the poor girl; they let her weep her fill, and when, after kiss upon her favorite's sleek face, she rose and turne with drooping head, Pen offered his arm in silence and-led her back to the house.

However, though her voice cer- tainly declined for lack of use, she still put her thoughts into melody occasionallyfor her own pleasure. She had the drawing-room to herself, and felt like singing something minor and mournful; and turning over the pages of the music-book she lighted upon "The Long, Long, Weary Day," which she sang through a couple of times, and was still busying her fingers among the chords, when Chandy Goldsmith lifted the damask curtain froim the bay-window and came forth, his merry eyes lighted with mischief. : "Have you been singing, Bertha?" asked he, teas- ingly. "l am  sure I heard something, and bumblei behes are out of season."   t i .'220 - TE COXMMON SENSE OF.-ARRUSE." Dolores Zambrano followed in her black dress, her jetty braids pierced with a golden arrow, and her glit- tering rosary depending from her waist. She clapped her hands and flashed her eyes in enjoyment of the joke, and repeated it in her musically imperfect English, keeping close to Chandy, and-delicately artic- ulating her smooth-toned words. "Ah, Chandos, how'salada you are," said she, show- ing her pointed teeth, which rivalled in brilliancy those of a Newfoundland dog, and gave her smile a savage, Arabic beauty. Bertha, in the instant she stood silent, observed and admired the divine oval of her face, the voluptuous curve of her chin, and her small hand gracefully waving her fan, the pungency, the rdagot, of hervivacious infantile manners, and she was deeply hurt; conscious of the forlorn feeling which prompted her repetition of the complaining strain, she was excessively annoyed that Chandos should have heard her crooning it; he knew her so thoroughly, un- derstood her so well, often confronting her with dis- coveries of feelings she'l ad supposed hidden. She colored as she rose from the piano.  "I certainly believed myself alone, or I should not have opened my lips," said she. "I really think it would have been more honorable for you to let me know ,your neighborhood. I shouald have been spared. the mortification of exhibiting my wretched croak; you know I never sing for anybody." "'That is my excuse for keeping quiet, Bertha; and really, permit me to say, you either undervalue your powers, or you are not quite sincere. I love to hear    TVE COMMON SEN8E O MWAtRRIAGE. 221 you. Come, let's have a duet."' He tried to coax com- pliance, but she refused so decidedly that he felt truly sorry he had teased her, and was saying so in the half- lordly, half-humble way she knew of old, when Dolores claimed impatiently his attention. "See, Chandos, what a pretty dress! She pointed. to a picture of a girl holding a hawk on her wrist, which Uncle Alec bought years ago for its resemblance to dark-eyed R linor. The full, round arms and shapely shoulders were bare, the fine waist laced into a velvet bodice bordered with gold, and bunches of coral de- pending from the round ears, the soft brown tint of the face was not unlike Dolores' own, but the sorrow- ful, determined look gave it a wholly different charac- ter.

"Will you come, too, Bertha? The ice is fine on Echo Lake; pray oblige me." And he privately resolved to find out, the first opportunity, 'whether- Miss Groenveldt understood, the soft Spanish word Dolores used; and to explain that it meant noth- ing, being a mere form, which was always in the mouths of the Granada maidens. He looked annoyed, although he; did not insist further, when she quietly declined accompanying him, saying that needful occupations would keep her indoors. He followed Dolores' mo- tions with a queer expression on his handsome face, when she went up to Bertha and hung affectionately upon hIer, begging for kisses. It was patent that the girl had no conception of any claim her friend could possibly have to the young gentleman's attentions, or consciousness of interference with her happiness; and she got what she so prettily asked, and sprang off to dress, like a light-hearted humming-bird. After they were gone, Susie Jenkins, who entered in time to hear the invitation and its refusal, came and put her arm around her friend, fully intent upon a conifidence concerning her new-found lappiness. '  "Ah, Bertha, dear, do get engaged as soon as you can;; it is so nice! I never had such good times before; never." -"Engaged!" repeated -Bertha, coloring slightly.

You and Ohandy are old friends, and we all see how it must come to pass; yon can't help being his wife some time." "You are jumping headlong to an insane conclusion, like the wise man who scratched out both his eyes in the bramble-bush, reasoning without evidence. I no- tice that old friends rarely marry; men generally hatch up a new fancy, when they desire to take a  wife," she added bitterly. "Ah! I see; you are jealous of your Spanish friend," replied Susie softly; "you are angry that he goes out with her. I heard you refuse to make a third in their party." "Jealous!" answered Bertha, arching her brows; "I don't think I understand what it is to be jealous." "You cannot tell me that you do not love Chandy Goldsmith."' "I do not desire to speak about my feelings," replied Bertha truthfully, "but this much I will say, if I did love him, or anybody else, I should not wish to keep him in my company when he liked being elsewhere; I should call that selfishness." "Selfishness! to covet. the whole of a lover's thoughts, and all his society--I call it love!"  "No! love seeks the happiness of the beloved, and if I have not in myself such a combination of gifts and' graces that I can fill my friend's soul, I will not deny him the harmless comfort he can find in the  agreeable conversation and accomplishments of my' friends; it seems to me it would be the very way to   224:  THE COMMON 8ENX E OF MARRIfAGE. wear out his patience and sorely vex him, to compel  his presence, while his thoughts were elsewhere.5" "Why! what heresy are you talkingll?" exclaimed Susie, with a very blank face. 'It is common sense, based upon observation of the :iarried life I have seen," replied Bertha; "I am con- scious of many imperfections and shortcomings, and if :I ever do marry, which is exceeding unlikely, I mean to be a reasonable wife, and try my best to ial!e the man who pays me the compliment to choose me as happy as I can. Do you suppose Mr. Bowles will always be content to sit on the same sofa with Mrs. Bowles, and hold her worsteds, and whisper in her' ear .

Believe me, Susie, there is a vtat deal of rank selfishness among women, which goes by the name of love; I remember Mr. Lovesea said he should never sail with his club after his mar- riage; but I noticed he did go the very next summer, and I haven't observed any sensible diminution of con- nubial bliss on account of his engaging in a diversion in which his wife- had no share; on the contrary, she helped him buy his tackle, admired his gaudy flies and shining spoons, and tried on his tarpaulin, and looked ,I  mighlty sweet at him when he returned, occupying herself during his absence, not in bewailing her neg-   -TH--Ss COMHMON ,SS OF- MRRIAG.   22 -GE lected condition, but in such feminine pursuits as she enjoyed in girlhood; she rose early, rode before break- fast, she went sketching, she read and visited and worked, got up some new music, and when she opened the door for him, and flew into his outspread arms; coming home, she was as blooming and animated as the lady he courted and married; and he enjoyed doubly his trip in the pleasure -she took in hearing all about it; and I have felt the utmost admiration and respect for Mrs. Lovesea ever since."  ( But I shall never get tired of Johnny," said Susie plaintively. "Very likely; but that won't hinder Johfny's get- ting tired of you occasionally; and I hope you will  have womanly tact enough not-to pout or look re- signed if he does. Byron never said a truer word than this: 'Man's love is of his life a thing apart; 'tis woman's whole existence.'?  Susie looked hopelessly at Bertha a moment; then she shook her head. "You are very sensible, and all that, and what you say sounds quite reasonable, for an outsider of no experience; I change my mind; you know nothing whatever about love.'" Chandy Goldsmith came back in his overcoat to persuade Bertha to come out with him, and stood hat in hand in the doorway long enough to hear her dec- laration concer nng jealousy, and he turned on is heel and walked off, too honorable to listen to a conversa- tion not intended for his ears-; and hie rather wondered i if she knew what she was talking about; and while:he'- had no full-fledged intention to find out, he speculated 10*            .   :     s   J226.

It is my turn now; you must give me a sitting as Moabitess." '"What is that a Moabitess! I did not hear of such a name," said Dolores, arching her eyebrows in pretty mystification. "Bertha hunting for a husband," replied Sir John. "I am putting her on canvas as a warning and en-, couragement to all maids in like quest."  "You are extremely provoking, Chandos-! ' exclaim- ed B]ertha, snapping down the lid of her color-box, '; and I have a great mind not to sit to you again." The unusual irritability of the quiet, steady girl, afforded much amusement and a certain degree of. sat- isfaction to naughty Chandy, who understood its cause better than she herself did.    -I230     THE COMMOX SENBE Of- MniAGE. "Yes, good apprentice--my provoking merit set-a- work by a reprovable badness in:myself. I am pres- ently 'to behave better, as you shall see; only oblige me with your company in my studio immediately." "' I must'- also come too," said Dolores, who did not feel quite at ease amidst so much talk she could not ufiderstand.-' , I wish to see the Moabitcss you have nrot: made the picture of mue. Do you also paint the husband of .Bertha? What looks he like?" 'IL will show you sometime, Dolores;. I know all about it. Indeed, I am working out every day my idea of liat he should be. 'Go to! Do you know what a man is?. Is not birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?" Bertha smiled at the hopeless bewilderment painted on the Spanish girl's face, while she admired her grace-, ful, supple motions, retreating toward the window, and the play of her long eyes, which saw only Chandy. "I cannot permit visitors in my studio, sweet novia; they disturb my sitters and hinder my work."- "You do not then care to paint me? I am not lovely  enough for your picture . " I Lovely enough! Nay, Dolores,' angels are painted .fair to look like you.' I must have you in mantilla, as -when wwe ivent to tertulio, and you gave me the clove- flower from yourhair. You ought to have seen her, Ber- tha, in her graceful dress; making love is the business : of life in Grenada. Was I not an apt scholar, Dolores? Adios, pretty novia; go say your prayers-never forget that you are surrounded by heretics.'   THE COMMON SENSE OR MtRRIAE      231  - He kissed' his hand, to her and left ,her. 'Bertha, followed him. He questioned her :fatee or the effect of his nonsense, and discovered nothing. It was too patent, and defeated itself, and with-the shutting of the studio door he changed his whole manner. The girl he left behind him dropped out of his thoughts as soon as his back was turned upon her, and he threw himself with eager zest, quite at variance with his or- dinary laziness, into the occupation of the hour, and the pleasure of a good, solid, sensible talk with his sit- ter. No cats'-cradles, no compliments; and he wound up a meditation upon it, after she left him to dress, with this conclusion-Bertha is agood girl, and Bertha cani be jealous. \ ,              OHAPKR XVII1. A DOG ON A TOHBSTONE. PENHURST was leaning against a tree; trunk with his hands in his pockets. Not a very dignified attitude, but he looked remark- ably-well.- The slant rays of the warm winter sun were playing with his hair, and Flirt had brought all her puppies for the express purpose of showing them to her-new  friend, who had not disappointed the proud mother in the notice- and admiration she felt they deserved. He had forgotten their neighborhood now however. His face was sober and reflective, and his eyes were fastened upon the ground, when Miss Bradshaw espied him. She was coming in from  her morning ride, and had dismounted at the stable, and said good-by to her sorrel mare, and fed her apples and sugar. Nobody spoke to her about her poor horses, after the disagreeable evening she tried hard to forget; and the boys were still at large, having been begged off by Mary McCross, who had good hopes of reforming them, and cultivating their hearts up to the point of hon- est citizenship, if not unto real Christianity; their cruelty s'pnlangmg, she declared, not so much from depravity as ignorance. They didn't know how it felt, and in   A DOG ON A TOBSETONE.      233 torturing the dog they thought less of his sufferings than the fun of seeing him blaze, and run. Uncle Alec was quite willing they should find "'out how a good whipping felt, and also that the culprits should have time for reflection and repentance in confine- ment; but Mary McCross carried her point, as she usually did concerning her boys, and so they were gathered into the day and Sunday-school, and set to work suited to their years, instead of being thrown vindictively into jail-shut up with hardened criminals, awaiting trial for crimes to make your blood creep, drinking in lessons in artful dodges-burglaries, murders, for future prac- tice. There were plenty of people who were ready to call Mary a fool for her pains, but she said meekly, "If I am let to save one soul, I have not labored in vain." - She and Peace visited the parents, and fonnd them mostly amenable to reason, though a trifle sus- picious. Only one case occurred of positive rudeness; from that dirty place they were ejected ignominiously - as Protestants, and the people were the parents of the wide-mouthed lad, who had shouted after Pen as the "Daddy Pease man." Mr. Penhurst and Sabrina had been excellent friends since the adventure, but none of -their talks bore upon his affliction, and as she approached the gentleman, and observed his thoughtful attitude, she said to herself, "Now is this widower certainly thinking about his wife. I must condole with him."  Sosheapproached with sympathizing face, and commenced softly - "You are meditating, Mr. Penhurst; this is a chanig. ing world, is it not "    &-   i A 234    A DOG ON A TOMB$TOXE. ': Weil, yes--rather," replied -.Pen, looking up with a bright smile of pleasure on his lips.. "There is cer- tainly no lack of changes, and I rather enjoy them. Variety is the spice of life. It is just possible you may have heard that observation before. I believe it is not strictly original Fwith me. I was thinking whether or:no I had been sufficiently precise in my orders to my man Jason about the feeding of those Estramanian hogs; I am fond of raising fancy stock on my place, and I have; got a couple of porkers which I am fatting for our next Agricultural, and I mean them to out- weigh -anything that squeals; but my Montachanos are the beauties! -I must send Mr. Bradshaw some of cespetits jambons vermiels, which the Duc St. Simon admired so deeply. His Grace of Arcos used to shut ' up his pigs in places abounding with vipers, on which they fattened, and it is said they had a 'parfum so admirable, a taste so noble and revivifying, that it is impossible to imagine' anything more exquisite.' De- troit logs were fed on rattlesnakes, you know; so that, as George Borrow, remarks (or some of those gypsy chaps),' the hog is the pioneer of the new world's civ- lization, as Pizarro, who was suckled by a porcine mother, and tended swine in his youth, was it' conquer- or.' I feed my Montachanos upon acorns, which drop in bushels from my paternal oaks-a trick I learned in Iberia, where those bellota were the original diet of the peasants as well as their herds; and indeed, I assure you that an opera evening among Spanish ladies, eat-    ing, acorns and dainty confections manufactured from them, is a very enjoyable affair. I also mash corn-   A  OG' ON A   BTOBSTE.    23:5 - - meal and- cooked potatoes for my pigs, and the pork beats anything I ever saw; -it looks when -boiled like melted topazes. If I should ever write poetry, it would be like Lopez de Vega when inspired by a rasher of one of those dulce jamons-'  - "All writing is but sham, Then is wanting Spanish ham.' I remember quite well the amusement I used to get in Estramania, besides my pleasant rides through its tan- gled ilex groves, and across its aromatic wastes, where sheep, pigs, and locusts were the only living things to be seen for miles, in watching the red-cheeked, red-bodiced swine-herd gathering up her charge, who scamper to her whistle, galloping like a legion possessed with devils never making mistakes as to their dulce donmum, into i which they run squealing, and twirling their long tails as they disappear. It was like a scene out of the Rue- ful Knight's travels, who was, you remember, near being annihilated by the ' far-spread grunting horde. I have not dedicated my porkers to St. Anthony, nor sprinkled them with holy water, but I assure you they thrive as on their native soil.'  Sabrina took infinite pleasure in Pen's talk, and-also rather admired him than otherwise; considered his fur cap exceedingly becoming; noticed the diamond on his bosom, and his heavy rope of a guard-chain; also the jasper ring on his finger. They were all suited to a certain affluence of -manhood which belonged toliim; and she also- liked his ease, his absorption in his sub- ject. He gave abundant evidence of understanding   I  36! ' 3  nos' , ON A ,TOMBSTONE. what-he was about; and, though the desire with which she approached him to make him talk about his wife was very nearly morbid with her, she quite forgot it in the interest of :his minute details concerning his farm lands. She;need not have lacked information relating to the gentleman's-history or pursuits, because she might have procured no end of such knowledge from his , frien'ds. She never spoke his name if she-could avoid it; which looked suspicious in so independent a young lady, and as if he might be often in her thoughts. "Have you ever been in Canadasset, Miss Brad- shaw- " asked Pen, stopping without having half ex- hansted his subject, because he suddenly remembered that his present, topic was even more odd for the en- tertainment of a young lady than the "pot-pie" upon which the Silver Lake Goddess had rallied him on their first interview. "Never, sir; though I have promised myself to visit some time our former pastor, to whom we were all ex- tremely attached." ' 'Ah, yes! Mr. Growing. A rare fellow he is- sweet as a nut, and as scholarly as an old monk! Just my idea of a pastor, capable of heading his flock in literature as well as religion. I hate these treadmill - preachers, who are always plodding round on the doc- trines, kicking up dry -bones, choking a fellow with Calvinistic dust. A man needs to be a good sharp thinker, with breadth, depth, and. bottom, to be able to lad doff our wide-awake American churches, where    A o0   0N A TOMBSTON      237 each man sifts his creed, and tosses out all the old tra^. dition rubbish." "Mr. Growing is all that," replied Sabrina, warmly "I think he combines more power, and peaceableness, and blessed meekness, with the perfection of his man- hood, than any man I ever met." HHc is a widower also," said Pen, smiling. Sabrina looked at him, wondering if he meant by his "also" to include the widowership among the pas- tor's excellencies, or to number him with himself in the bereaved class. [ I have never met him, since the death of his wife," said& she, severely; "but I suppose he cherishes her memory with extreme tenderness, and often seeks con- solation in conversing about her with his friends." "I imagine he is not the sort of person to talk much on such a subject," replied ]Mr. Penhurst, with mild candor. "He is a man of exquisite delicacy, and not likely to parade his feelings. I myself have never heard him mention the deceased lady, but then I am- not especially intimate with hiin."  "Oho! so he considers it indelicate., I must let mamma know that," thought Sabrina. "He is a noble pastor, is Growing. You would be astonished to learn the curious subjects upon which he- is consulted. All ages, sexes,-and conditions- take- - their troubles and griefs to him and get counsel. He holds weekly in his church parlor a sort of- confessional, - which is a substantial help in holy living. I haveno doubt the primitive church had such leaders, before   I I8' A:DOff ON A TOMBSTONEB. worldliness aind temporal power had corrupted the- priesthood and defiled their sacred office.": - I know sometlihing of Mr. Growing's habits," said Sabrina still thinking about the " widower."  Of, gcourse. I had nearly forgotten that Roaring River was his first parish. 'It is not to be supposed  -that I' could tell you anything ne w' What he is, he - was, except that he is always 'Growing.'- He likes Oanadasset. It is a lovely spot, almost prettier than -this. . I think our factories beat yours by odds, and some of the residences are delightful. Laprise, my- great competitor in satinet, has a magnificent place. 'I won't brags over the Penhursts; but I should like :to have you judge for yourself. I have a monument just up, which I brought from: Rome. I came across it by the merest accident; and I put it over -the grave of my-faithful Tuftii, on the prettiest hill about the grounds, which commands the wide val- ley:and the lake. You really must let me show it you. There is a slab of Scotch granite, and the most perfect dog lying stretched upon it that human skill could chisel. I was exceedingly fond of Tuft. She was the most faithful, affectionate creature, and she adored me.,' I assure you it was quite affecting to wit- ness her joy after a short absence. I had a picture painted for my own room--in Venice. Don't look so astonished.' It is a weakness; I acknowledge it; but I was devotedly attached to the little thing." Sabrina's eyes kindled. This was' delicacy! And you are, speaking," said she, " of-"  "Yes, Miss Bradshaw, exactly, of Tuft, my black    z o .           z A ;    -- -  . .3 ;. v- .A DOS ON A TOMBSTONE.    239 - and white pointers whom I named for the late ]Mrs i Penhurst; and well she deserved the honor, I assure you. They were not unlike, either. Annie was the prettiest woman I ever saw, and Tuft the most beauti- ful dog. When it came to sagacity, I believe the, pointer had the best of it, for it is certain: that poor Annie was not overstocked with brains-a doll-like toy of a woman. She would have had a very happy life, however, according to her capacity; if shre had not  been nipped like a rose in its budding. I could have found it in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel and weep-like a woman when I saw her lowered into her lonely grave. By Jovel it is impossible to be. long in Chandy Goldsmith's company and- not get-  intimate also with Bill Shakes, isn't it? I am afraid I did cry. Although she was not in the least the style of woman I admire [looking appreciatingly at the purple-robed and most queenly girl before him], such petite, clinging creatures are extremely lovable?'- "Good morning, Mr. Penhurst," said Miss Bradshaw, loftily. "I find it cool, and shall go indoors. "Such mannish, heartless, selfish, trifling egotism!" she thought.  "Yes, it is turning cold; feels like snow," replied the gentleman easily, wholly unconscious of the scath- ing censure just passed uipon him. "Permit me to accompany you.'  "Excuse me, sir; I prefer to be alone." "Miss Bradshaw, have I offended you? My choice of subjects was rather remarkable. I liave been on the point of apologizing every moment. I ought to   g I ' 0oo   A DOG ON A TOMBS1TONE. have known a lady could not be interested in stupid hogs., You are a little to blame, though, for your eyes inspired me. I am not a great talker, I think, habitually. Of course you take no interest in farming  topics."  On the contrary, sir, I pride myself upon being a practical farmer." "Then my manner of treating the subject?" "Yes, sir. Your manner of treating subjects is par- ticularly offensive. You would do well to get a lesson from your widowed pastor, Mr. Growing." Poor Pen watched her sweeping proudly away. She gathered her violet wrap in her firm hand, and tossed it over her shoulder, not deigning him another look. "Angels and ministers of grace defend us } mur- mured he in abject abasement. "What have I done now? just as we were getting such friends too. I must hunt up Chandy, and make him advise me. Chandy is an impertinent dog; always says just what he likes, but somehow he manages to fall on his feet, and I ain sure to blunder, take all the care I can. I wish I had gone hunting to-day. What an adorable woman is Miss Bradshaw! Confound those hogs! Vhy couldn't I let them eat their corn in peace? But stop-the lady did not look disdainful over them; quite the contrary. What the deuce is the matter?." As he pulled his hat over his brows, and dived his hands into his coat pockets, striding thoughtfully toward the mansion, Peace Pelican in her crimson jacket came out fromn behind the ornamented structure inhabited by the silver pheasants, with a corn basket on her arm, and  A DOG O   A TOMBSTONE.     241: dropped upon the ground, burying her face in her mit- tens, while her whole frame shook with" convulsive laughter. "Oh dear I it is too rich," said she. "I shall run mad with ecstasy of joy. I know I must be getting thin; so much fun isn't good for the constitution. I'll make Thomas weigh me directly. 'Have I offended you, Miss Bradshaw .

"(Her melting voice through mazes running, Untwisting all the ebains that tie The hidden soul of harmony., She was still ringing the changes upon the finished conversation, with Flirt and her puppies for appreciat- ing audience, when Mr. Francis H]aythorne trotted up the avenue, and drew rein beside the "scarlet figure un- der the great tree, instead of ringing the front door- bell, "Well met, fair maid of wreathed smiles," said he. "' Mirth, admit me of thy crew; ' in other words, in- struct me where the laugh comes in, that I may also hold my sides." ' We are rehearsing' Counterparts, or Love's Blun- ders,' up here, and I have been listening to the tragedy queen, who is wonderful in her rdle," replied Peace, picking up her basket, and crossing her arms, like Red Riding-Hood interviewed 'by the wolf, as she stood   r   '  2422    A DOG ON A TOMBSTONE. gracefully erect' beside the gentleman's horse, who turned his head and examined her face, making up an opinion from some standpoint of his own; which was favorable, because he -stretched his neck to thrust his nose into her basket. Peace unfolded her hands to pet'her equine admirer, and held out the willow recep- tacle for his use, saying airily to the rider, who took in the whole situation,- "You have come up to spend the day with Mr. Pen- hurst, I suppose. I hope Deborah has plenty of cream- cates. Hadn't I better run on, and let her know some- thing about your idiosyncrasies. She ,may think it well to roast an extra goose. What does Goethe say about geese?       -         - "Nothing that I know of, Miss Pelican." "What a pity! Then of course you won't be able to say anything about them." "aI don't wish to-nor -shall. I crave cooked goose while Miss Pelican--smiles on me." ' Why didn't you say, while she continues to 'quack,; quack' in my neighborhood I I know you wanted to." "' Plato, thou reasonest well,'" replied- the gentle- man, leisurely dismounting, and surrendering to Tommy his steed. He stroked his red beard with a hand which he removed from its gauntlet for the purpose, and also, perhaps, to display its whiteness, of which he was rea- sonably proud. 'Mr. Haythorme was a great friend of [ Mary McCross, and a sort of admirer of Miss Pelican, who often conversed with him, and very rarely agreed with him on any subject, resenting his German quips, and the objections he made to her opinions, as well as  A DOG ON A TOzBSTONE. -     243 the cold water he was wont to throw upon her favorite projects, interposing inappropriate remarks and absurd suggestions, inferring their absolute inutility, and the total depravity of herprote'ges.

Fortunately for her equanimity, Miss Pelican troubled herself not at all as to his liking or disliking. She talked to Thomas-praised his colts and admired his dun calf, and hunted out the eggs from a couple of hens' nests, insomuch that her attendant had rather the appearance of following her about; and when at last she was ready to go up to the house, she dismissed him in the hall, saying she would forewarn and forearm Deborah what manner of guest she would have to pro- vide for, because some entertained angels unawares, and sent backed parting " quack, quack" to him as she vanished up the stairs. '    ,       .'      THAT same evening, Chandy and Pen were smoking in the little parlor at shut of even, Continuing the ever-fresh theme of Miss Brad- shaw's character, commenced by a lengthy detail of his morning's faux pas, which recital sent Chandy off into a series of hearty cachinnations, which he tried hard to hide and suppress, and account for on extraneous grounds. Then he condoled with Pen on his unlucky choice of subjects. "Some men there are love not a gaping pig, some that are mad if they behold a cat; for prejudice, mis- tress of passion, sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes." "But," replied Pen, reflectively, " it couldn't have been the hogs that did the mischief, because I remem- her she was absolutely charming all through that. Her white plume blew against her cheek, and I observed that no marble could be purer than her fine-grained skin, and she beat her little boot with her riding whip, while she looked pleasantly in my face. Oh, no-it was not the' gaping pig' which she could not abide. A1m I'll tell you what, my boy. Do you suppose there is ,     - "ROBEKT, TOT QUEJ'AIME."    245 anything immoral associated in her mind with a dog and a tombstone? Because I recollect quite well that it was my account of Tuft and her monument which brought her down on me." Pen held his smoking cigar in- his hand, and leaned toward his adviser, and tapped his thumb nail with it, lowering his voice to a confidential pitch. "Pray, let me- know what you find so amusing," said he, rising abruptly, as Chandy burst out afresh. "It' may be fun to you, but it is death to meY ' As the ab- surdity of his last proposition dawned on him; -ihe laughed in a half-chagrined, half-amused, wholly of- fended way, and turned to depart. "Don't go," exclaimed Chandy, wiping his eyes. - You take the bagatelle au serious, and try to account for the unaccountable with such odd conceits, that I really-excuse me, Pen. You know I am a constitu-. tional laugher, one of those chaps who evermore peep, through their eyes like parrots at a bag-piper-my in- firmity. I bewail it, I repent of it, and I stl again. Ha! ha! ha! No; no. Pen, hold on. Positively, this is the last appearance. ' I do serve you in this business.' Let's discuss the bearings soberly. You remember I forewarned you that our peerless Silver Lake Goddess was full of crotchets and whims. "'Oh, woman, in our hours of ease, Uncertain, coy, and hard to please.' You understand--just forget all about your morning, and you'll find the lady will be sweet as cream, as fla, vorous as her violets; the next time you accost ;her-   Nwai' 240 "ROBERT TOI QUE J'lTp., here she goes." (A couple of female figures glided along, and passed within, the great drawing-room, be. yond.) "Now, Pen, you are in luck. This is the nick of time-the verytide in your affairs. I'll go and coax her to sing; she seemed to have some reason for de- clining rwhen you askled her; perhaps because you are so hypercritical. But I think she will oblige me, and not knowingyour neighborhood, she will be sure to come out strong. She is as fond of singing in twilight as a nightingale or a bobolink. Sit still, my dear fellow; I promise you a treat."' "She couldn't have seen me sitting here, and has tened away on purpose to avoid me, do you think? It did not seem in the least like her usual easy, undulat- ing motion. She is not wont to be in a hurry.  "I am quite sure we were invisible. You must not get nervous or seem afraid of her. A woman is pretty certain to take you at your own estimate, if she takes you at all.  - Without waiting for a. reply, Chandos rose and walked swiftly after the floating drapery. Presently Pen heard the piano opened, and a little rustle among the. music came distinctly to his ear; so intent was his sense upon the expected pleasure, even the noise of the whirling stool reached him, and he fancied the spread of the purple robe falling around the lithe shape, the tap of the little foot on the yielding pedal, and heard the grouping of the preparatory chords in the hand- some hand, lying straight and firm above the keys; the nervous finger-points darting right downward like tiny :; . hammers, and the round, supple wrist, so quiet and k ..   ,IOBERT, TOI QUE JATRj."

He seemed to see the violet glow of the great amethyst, whose dead-gold hoop spanned her finger; the sweeping braids of her wondrous hair, her luminous eyes,- her white throat about to swell with divine melody, and her well-marked lips, ripe and adorable. He had time to conjure the perfect picture, the radiant womanhood before him, while the prelude dropped note by note, clear and clean as tinkling water-drops. You would have liked to see the look of joyous expectancy upon Pen's face. It glorified his manliness. He was about to have a song from the woman he loved, and desired to make his wife-the first of the songs of a lifetime. A thin piping voice commenced ":Robert, toi qui j'aime,' and labored and strained and nasally called on him, and begged "pardon for thee, mercy for me," and grievously croaked till the poor listener bent his head, and shut his teeth, and lost his cigar from his nerveless fingers, astonished, distressed, overwhelmed. When Chandos returned, bursting with suppressed fun; Pen must have suspected a trick if he had raised his eyes to the handsome fellow's wickedly conscious face; but he hadn't the heart to lift his head, and sat quite still and speechless. "Beautiful, wasn't it, my dear fellow " exclaimed Sir John in a queer choked voice; "I made the selec- tion myself--old, to be sure, but a prime favorite of yours. I told you she could wrap you about in melody." He got behind Pen, and professed to be absorbingly J      "      " -  *  *   248    "'OBERT, TOI QUE j'AIM.," engaged in selecting and lighting a fresh cigar. Poor Pen, who sighed deeply, and leaned his face in his hand, liunk in so- absent a reverie that Chandy felt almost sorry for his disappointment! He settled him- self comfortably, however, in his easy chair, waiting, and .had puffed away nearly half of his long bueno before his vis-a-vis roused sufficiently to observe and pick up the cigar he had dropped, and look into the merry eyes opposite; then he asked for a light, and after kindling the "roguish tobacco," and returning the kindler, he thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and leaned back watching his smoke wreaths. ' What does it matter," said he, at length. "I love her; I shall not'try to live without her if I can be so blessed as to win her for my wife. Suppose she croaked like a raven--would she be less true and pure and womanly sweet in abounding graces? I love music --I did wish for a singer-I was a fool--I'd sooner hold' her in my .arms than another who could out- warble the nightingale. If we desire music, we can go to operas and concerts; there are plenty of females paid for that sort of thing. You wouldn't consider a cantatrice so very desirable for your daily food, would yon, Chandy? You see some confounded fellow   or 'other would be always wanting to sing with her, and that would be a bore."  Chandos expected he would upbraid him   for his unwarranted praise, or express surprise at Miss Brad- shaw's reputation among her friends, who certainly were competent judges, for fine voice and artistic   "OBERT, TOIQUEJ     s Te1 "  249  execution, which her late performance had so miser-  ably belied and was delighted to get off scot-free.

There are diverse standards, you know; what pleases one ear offends another.

"I think the best grace of wit wilrshortlyturn tq silence, and discourse grow commendable in 'none but parrots."  He saw that his friend was terribly irritated, and ready to quarrel over his bitter disappointmentm , and he added candidly-  '   a To tell youl true, there is no gift of so little real  solid value as a fine voice; because, just as you get it  trained into absolute perfection, it begins-to decline; ,  'II *  "  '  -- .         , . , . .@ *       f ,       , * i :' *^   25-    '  BIERT, TOI QTVXAMR.!" nobody cares to listen to a woman after she is, well-- say forty; and then there are casualties, colds, bron- chitises, and such small deer.

Chandy started up. "I promised to meet Bertha in the library," said he "to look over some new picture-books from our favor- ite Germans; and- I must hasten, because we are to assemble in committee of the whole at nine to decide upon  our drama.  As for Sabrina Bradshaw, you know how incomparable she is in virtues and graces, and we her old friends can tell you there isn't a truer or more constant heart breathing.

As   he strolled toward the crimson-curtained arclh  which shut off the little parlor from its grand neighbor, he caught sight of a black-robed figure, whose precious rosary flashed in the flickering fireshine; and lhe wheeled suddenly and vanished through the side exit, taking a  circuitous route to reach his goal.    - 'OBEST, TOI EQUB TA      251   ., Dolores stood still beneath the rosy light above ,   i her, and then threw around one of her sweeping,     , passionate glances. Missing what she sought, she-    ' shrugged her shoulders impatiently, and picking up a guitar left on a sofa, in convenient shape for crushing by the next careless sitter, she sank down in the corner and began humming a little song she had heard a thousand times on the Prado, and which, dearer still,  had been sung by handsome Chandy beneath her       i casement.           - "Thy lips are two curtains  Of crimson velvet,              Between curtain and curtain   : Dear girl, say to me - yes."         : Fasten me with a hair            ji To the frame of your cana,          I Even if the hair should snap        0 Be sure that I would not leave you."

The     :: people were all kind, her host was cordiality itself,  ' there were plenty of pleasures; but Chandy had too   - many friends, and too many ways of dividing his time., She wished to have it all, and was continually feel-   : ing put aside by some one. The guests began to assemble for one of their Craig- ' Fi enfels' evenings, whose amusements were as diverse as 0 the inclinations of the individuals. The newly married -- played cribbage in a corner; Sam Slaughton came in. .    looking for Sabrina. but not finding her, took a book and an arm-chair. Jasper Bisbee appropriated a place on Dolores' sofa, and listened to her low sonlg, :and.  A  '      . :   I  '  252    "RZOBERT, TO0 WEj'AIM thought about her. Mr. Haythorne, Norris Jenkins Irene Bisbee, and Peace Pelican made a quartette of chatters, who gathered about the fire and used hand- screens, and exchanged personalities. Susie Jenkins lingered in their neighborhood, but took no part in their conversation; she fluttered with every noise, and got rosy and white, and watched the door. "She only said, 'The night is dreary:  He cometh not,' she said. She said, 'I am aweary, aweary; I would that I were dead.'" "If I must be as snippy and tremulous and expect- antly disagreeable as you are becoming, Susie," ex- claimed Peace, "I shall never get engaged." Up went Francis Iaythorne's white hand to his beard,  "The Inindoos of the Wilderness vowed to eq no fishes," remarked he quietly. "Yes, indeed," chimed in Irene. "Jacky wouldn't, 'cause he couldn't.;" "Gome, sweet sister in adversity:" replied Peace, "Iet us comfort and console each other;we share a common lot among the great unclaimed." Mr. Penhurst had not stirred from his place, but sat observing the groups bathed in color and picturesquely scattered, when presently Miss Bradshaw appeared  framed in the curtained arch, whose parted crimson fell awayfromher ingraceful draping She wasdressed in heavy silk of violet, faced half a yard deep with purple velvet, which swept backl in a gorgeous train.    "ROBERT, TOI QUE'-J'ATT"    253i - cut into deep points at top, and edgedwith narrow lace; ; her loose sleeves slashed and bordered with, the same v royal dye, and her dead-gold hair gathered in. heavy braids-awayfrom her pure-hued face; the precious ame-  thyst Pen ihad dreamed of glimmered at her throat, and the sweet perfume of the English violets she always wore came faintly wafted to his sense. She smiled, and said in friendly voice- "Are you in propitious humor for our game of chess to-night Can you bear beating with proper equan- imity and manly fortitude . " He rose with delighted alacrity, forgetting that there was such an opera as "Robert,' oblivious of pigs and tomb-stones, oblivious of everything except her charmed presence, her royal completeness. "The battle must be fairly fought before the victor- palm is awarded,' replied he. "I am till now the champion, unbeaten; I am generous enough to offer you odds, if you like." "' Thanks, no! liberty and equality is my motto." His face, fell a little, and he followed her springing, easy motion across'the room with troubled eyes, not knowing how much her speech portended. "Let us sit here," said she, turning down the table of foreign workmanship, whose mother-of-pearl squares outcolored the gaudy rainbow. "Those people yonder in the great room chatter overmuch for quiet game-  sters, who need all their faculties.'  Her air was womanauly, nearly timid, asking pardon ' for her unmannerly petulance of the morning (sitting :: in judgment upon conduct which was no concern of  , \   -.-^ 2S4    O "ROBERT, TOI QUE JAiM'. hers), and showing that she desired to be friends with her-friend, and over all; her own assured grace certain of being able to confer pleasure, giving more than -she received.  Selecting the red pieces, she placed them with her white fingers, then picked up a couple of pawns, which she held close shut in her small fists, extended toward him for his choice of chance for first move; the deep- hued velvet fell away from her. round wrists and showed the circling amethysts which spanned them, through the meshes of the soft lace shading her arms. "Who chooseth here shall get as much as he de- serves," said she, smiling. "Which hauid will you have a? "The loyal right one; please the gods, here rest I my choice. Joy be the consequence." "Yot are sped well," said she, unclosing her fingers while a rosy flush crept up in her cheek. Pen's tone was earnest and purposeful, and must mean all which met her ear, and might mean so much more that she hastened to finish her speech and apply herself to the game. "A good beginning does not always insure a brave race, nor a successful ending.'" - That is most true; the winner mustfwork. I intend to, be a winner, and am willing to work," replied he, watching her advancing knights, and pushing bishops, dashing into unforeseen -places, gobbling all in their way. He played his best; he wished her for his life-  companion, but he had no desire to be beaten in any game, much as he admired her; sitting with bent head, pondering the state of her horseman, checked by an ignoble pawn, and planning an attack upon his queen-   "ROBERT, TOIz Qr2E 'IE 2I, :-  "Miss Bradshaw," said Jesse, in the doorway, "there ^ is a man to see you; he says he won't be druv off --till you come out to him."  a Some of my mission people, I suppose," she replied - evenly, nothing put out by the imperative tone of the request. "Tell him to come here, Jesse." In a moment, a sun-browned, heavy-built man, with frightened, horrified face, steeped to the lips in distress, shuffled into sight. "Barney is tore to bits, marm; fell into the hopper," said he in a thick voice, plunging at once into his needs. He would give me no- rest till I comned up to you; he begs you to go right away down and see him; he said he know'd you'd come; couldn't you be gittin' off right now 8 " he added, with the exigdant selfishness of sulf- fering, which feels only its own wants and pangs. Sabrina -rose instantly. "Mr. Penhurst, will you ac- company me? said she with quiet voice. "This is thet poor boy you saw the night of our accident." Her hand closed sharply around the piece she held, and a sob rounded her white throat. Ah! my poor colts,': she added. "We must beg Thomas to lend us a steed. r'll speak to him directly."  "' Thanks, Miss," said the father, fumbling his old cap. "I turned you from me door, I haint forgot; I'd sooner put me head into the- fire than ask la favor of ye, but for me poor lad; my place wasn't no -proper standin' for the likes of ye, anyhow, nor no privilege: to come to; I'd be glad to turn meself out o't for always, - and in coorse ye didn't mind."

"Ye'll be catching yer death; the little villain's not worth yer risk--bad luck to him for a wicked scamp, with his turpentine murder, torturing the helpless beasts!" - Sabrina turned quickly, searching the father's face; he had not heard the old man's vindictive speech; his thoughts were busy with the misery he had left. "-Never mind me," said she decidedly; "' I know how to take care of myself; we won't hurt your horse, either.

He wished to be "we-' -with her everywhere, and though extremely sorry, in a general way, for the afflicted family, I am afraid the uppermost thQught in his mind was- the   "ROBERT, TOI QUE ',AIME,     257 prospect of a long evening with this matchless girl all to himself, close by his side. - He stood by, offering no suggestions, admiring the completeness of her particular arrangements; and curi- ously enough, among his reflections upon her came a surmise as to whether she would go out in her magnifi- cent toilette of costly silk, rare laces, and jewels, and certainly experienced relief, as if a possible blemish upon her perfection was become a demonstrated impossibility, when after five minutes' absence she returned, trimly arrayed in close-fitting. purple cloth, warm sealskin jacket, and a round cap with ear-tabs tied beneath her chin. So swiftly and quietly had the arrangements been consummated that they were on their way to the glen before any one missed them. Thomas conveyed Sa- brina's message to Mr. Craigenfels privately, who was. not a whit disturbed, being quite willing that his superb niece should do good, and do-it hi such company. Mr. Penhurst was defrauded of part of his expected enjoyment. I will tell you how it chanced. When they reached the glen, the cottage was sur- rounded with people, who thronged the doors with Irish lamentations and wailings; and pushing through into the close room they found it reeking with chloro- form (the surgeon had just finished taking off a leg and replacing the tattered flesh), and the sufferer, still under the effect of the somnolent, was begging in his ramblingstalk for his teacher. He had been but a couple of Sabbaths in her class, coaxed. thither, with untiring, persuasive endeavor, and had sat sullen and irre- sponsive, with hanging lips and lowering brows,minso-   258    "ROBERT, TOI QUE J'AIME." much that Sabrina depressingly felt that though she had succeeded in achieving his bodily presence she had got no hold upon his wayward, obdurate nature. As soon as he saw her by his bedside, and felt her touch upon his forehead, he subsided into uncomplain- ing quiet, and soon sank to sleeps holding her soft little white hand in his rough, ungainly one. She drew a chair without disturbing his grasp, and sat patiently down. When he opened his eyes and found her still there he said: "You won't leave me, teacher. That devil down there that's blazing all over wants to carry me off, but he can't get me while youwatch! You won't leave me?"- She replied, "No, Barney, I'm going to stay right here." The horrible dread removed, the weary eyelids closed easily and little snatches of comforting forgetfulness kindly blurred his sense of pain. Ever and anon his question would be repeated, "You won't leave me, teacher V." and again the soothing response, in soft, refined accents, "I'm here, Barney; go to sleep," assured him and gave him peace. Penhurst meantime was hard at work outside. First he sent away the crowd and enforced quiet; and so much strength and goodness was there in him, that he got willing obedience from the father and mother, who were of the mould intended for subservience. They tidied up the place, fed the children from Deb's bounties and kindled a bright fire in the rusty old stove, around which they snuggled in animal comfort. Mr.- Penhurst also made a mental memorandum of the pressing needs he saw, with intent to supply them inl the morning. He enjoyed his work. It opened   "OBERT, TOI QU'E J'ATa,     259 a new field to him. I regret to say it, though. Mr. Penhurst was a real noble fellow, kindly-affectioned, humane, benevolent, he had been rather in the habit of passing by on the other side when limping human- ity fell into the ditch, that is, as far as giving his own clean hands to help it out. He was always willing to assist with money, and quite as willing to permit other people to do all the dirty work. An hour or so had passed. The young ones were asleep, the surgeon gone, and the father dispatched for the needful medicines, when the door of the inner room  opened, and Miss Bradshaw  appeared. -Pen looked at her in astonishment--handsome, stately, su- perb as ever, but in comfortable wrapper and slippers, her red hair closely bound about her head, and a soft purple shawl gathered around her folded arms.  "I shall not return to-night, Mr. Penhurst,'" aid she. "I will not leave the boy. I have power to keep him quiet and give him rest, and I shall of course use it.' I am glad you have ridded the place of all the comers and goers. I hope they will stay away--they must. It is a terrible thing. Unless the lad is reserved for some good work, it seems hard that he could not have died in the mill. We must try to find out what he is  saved for.", "We certainly will do it," answered Pen readily; you must let me share your labor, and aid you. A whole night's watching will make you ill." "Oh no; Pam not easily made ill, thanks to a good   S constitution; and I do not wish you to remain here.   - I prefer to stop alone."           - p,            . .       2s0    BROBERT,.

Her three black crows were abroad, full fledged, and swarming into hundreds. She had enjoyed quite a number of teas and dinners on the strength of her in- teresting gossip, and effected a notable saving of her own eatables in consequence. Mrs. Deacon Williams, Mrs. ]McCross) and Dame Hitchcock debated seriously the safety or' expediency of waiting on the injured party with their sympathy, and to see how he looked, and what he had to say for himself. That Otho was not the sort of person to invite commisberation did somewhat deter these thick-skinned femalesifrom bearding him on his own domain; and they were still discussing the attempt, pushed by curi- osity ard held back by fear, when one day Chandy,  stopped the ancient spinster on the street, with severity in every line of his well-tutored face. He had heard , -   , .;   262   CS:ND Y GOES OUT SEifrfEI'. many ridiculous versions of the tale, and thought it time to bring it to a head. "I wish to speak a moment with you, Miss Petingill, if you please. I am afraid you have revealed the secret which I indiscreetly confided to you. There is danger of enmity arising among the parties on account of it. 'A tale-bearer separateth many friends,' says Sacred Writ. I exceedingly regret being obliged-." "Law! Chandy, I never told nobody 'ceptin' the deacon's wife and Widder Williams, and--" Exactly, good lady, and everybody else who would listen-to you; and I hear that there is superadded to the' story a fabulous account of my sister's hysterics and, her husband's broken bones. I told you nothing of that kind." "No, (handy, in course not. I never said you did," (   replied the spinster, squirming under the memory of sundry additions from time to time appended to the unvarnished tale confided to her by her informant. ' Some folks is so peculiar they can't never tell a yarn without addin' to't." "Dr. Groenveldt -isn't the sort of man to put up with slander, and I should not be at all surprised if a case of discipline grew out of this trifle," said Chan- dos, thoughtfully. "I heard Deacon McCross say only yesterday that Zion was declining and her walls break- ing down for lack of proper watch-care; and if these men should get hold of it-" "You don't say so!

I'm afraid you'll have to lop them off. I'll tell you what you had better do: get the ladies together and call on the doctor and talk to him about it. Take the bull by the horns, you know; be the first to tell him, and get rid of all the odium you can in that way." "Y..ou mentioned Sabrina's name, didn't you?" asked the poor spinster, trying in her own mind to sep- arate the truth received from the fiction added. "Yes, certainly. Miss Bradshaw handed Mr. Pen- hurst the cane, and stood by during the caning," re- plied Chandos. H Eow desput queer! Well, we'll'go this afternoon and see Doctor Groenveldt," answered Miss Petingill. "I feel kinder curious to notice how he'll act. Hems such a drefful proud critter; thinks common folks ain't worth lookin' at." After she parted with her candid adviser, the tailor- ess proceeded to Mrs. Slocum's, determined to have one more good occasion out of her gossip before she had to give' it up. "Jerusalem crickets!

"If lies come home to roost like chickens, as the old saying is, there's somebody round town that'll hef to build an all-fired big hen-house to accom- ,*;   264,               r 6al   C DY GOES OUT ST WrGIIING. modate their Shanghais before long," he added, un- pleasantly eying the spinster's snuff-stained nose. Dulcet laughed, and going up to her husband and leaning' over his shoulder she whispered in his ear. He turned and looked in her face- she nodded, and he burst out into one of his good-natured 'haw- haws.'" "Sartain true," said he. "Dulcet, you are smarter'n a whip. -Takes you to see into things! Got caned, did he, ma'am . Well, served him right, if he couldn't take a joke. My jemimy! what a woman to see into a millstone!" Miss Petingill took leave in a huff, and gathering up her co-workers she proceeded that very afternoon to Brookside, where they found the young doctor busy in his library translating a German fairy story for his little Leonore. - Mrs. Deacon Williams opened the ball with an in- quiry into the cause of Amos"Staply's death, saying, "I hearn tell he was conflicted with a convesation of diseases." The doctor not seeming inclined to communicate upon the topic, Mrs. McCross bore directly down upon the object of their visit. "We've called round, doctor, to inquire after your health," said she. "I im quite well," replied Qtho, looking at her and wondering what induced these women, every one of whom was personally offensive and disagreeable to him, to bore him with a visit. He glanced out at the   CHAND Y aGOES o UT SLEIGaHNG.   265 door, intending to bring his wife to the4 front, and escape as soon as possible from the infliction. "It didn't hurt you so dreadfully as was reported. after all, did it, or you wouldn't be lookin' so chirk." "It is rather indefinite, madam," said he, mentally adding, "What the deuce does the woman mean by'her impudence?"?"You will be obliged to particularize a little."                  , "We mean the can in' you got," spoke up old Miss Petingill; " you can understand that, I s'pose!" , ' "'Caning!" he repeated in an offended tone, and scanning the three. They could not all be mad, though it looked something like it. "There, Sister McCross!" spoke up Widow Williams. "Didn't I tell you aslike as not he'd deny it. But we know all about the fracas, so you might just as well own up first as last; no use dodgin'; everybody's talkin' about it." "Who is said to have performed the operationS" asked the doctor, in a changed voice. A sudden light had burst in upon him. He discovered a well-known saucy face peering in at the doorway. "Mr. Penhurst done it, they say helped by Sabr'my. I should think she'd be ashamed to show her head.! [ such fine lady airs as she's allers puttin' on," said Widow Williams, with rasping recollections of sundry' fancied slights from the Silver Lake Goddess, who, se- renely moving in her orbit, gave no heed to the stout relict in any wise.,  4 And pray who is your informant?"

I pity her from the bottom of my heart; think of having a fighting husband; scandalous! I don't see anything to smile at; you ought to go down in the val- ley of humiliation, yea, weep and howl for your sins. Come, Sister Williams, let us return and have a season of prayer for this man who trifles on the brink of woe. His heart must be unregenerate, or he couldn't brave out his si'ns as he does." Otho laughed through his vexation with the incorri- gible joker, who was shaking his sides outside the door, and whose merry eyes he could see through the open- ing, and his handsome teeth; he was amused at the suc- '" cess of the prank. "It is quite true, ladies," said he. "I will not dissem- ble or cloak the offence. Come into my office and I will show you the weapon, which I still preserve as a me- mento of the transaction."

"So I really am not to blame." - "Get along, do," replied the spinster, giving him a push after looking a second into his mirthful face. She could not help smiling in spite of her vexation. "So you thought you'd give me a lesson, did you? Well, it's hard learning old dogs new tricks.

QHE non-appearance of the principal actors post- poned the convocation on dramatic business, but the next evening they all assembled in the library. Uncle Alec took the chair, and Aunt Elinor and our Howadji supported him right and left. The discussion waxed witty and wise. Chandy made a speech; Sam fol- lowed  him, and Pen rose and ,advocated women's rights, and begged the sisters to free their minds; and then Dolores Zambrano upset the whole question by a novel suggestion: "Why should we at all have theatres, which are so i common, when there is a new divertisement so much' nice-gayer, and more amusing. Let us have a neck-tie party." They seized eagerly the idea, and Dolores got almost beyond her English in her efforts to explain the man- ner of it. - She was sitting by Chandy, and Bertha, who was silent, not noticeably, for she was never vivacious even when fullest of joy, took away a picture of the Span- ish girl as she appeared then and there, which she car- ried -on her heart to its grave.

Bertha listened with the rest, and hno one observed her quietude. Yes, there was one, who knew all the workings of' her inner life-her kind old father. He; heard none of the frothy, -sparlling talk in thinking about his good maid. As for Chandos, he seemed wholly occupied with the neighbor who claimed his devoted attention. "We must make to ourselves each an apron, which we-shall wear to the festin, and also a neck-tie from a bit of the same material, which shall be dropped in a box; and then the gentleman shall be made to draw forth of them and seek his novia among theladies, and shall be her novio-that means particular partner, her attendant for the whole evening--and he shall be en- tirely polite to her alone." "And pray what do they call their hooked fish?" asked Chandy. "Why, bows! of course," replied Peace. "Tell me, heavenly bow, when wilt thou, with thy saffron wings upon my flowers, diffise thy honey- drops, and with thy blue bow wilt crown -my bosky acres and my unscrubbed down, rich scarf to my proud neck?"        ,   "Chandos!" said Peace, " you ought to be indicted for such shameful and :snippy perversion of the classic muse. Dolores is vainly trying to get sense from your nonsense." The handsome fellow turned and looked in the Spanish girl's eyes. "Do you find me hard to under- stand?" asked he. - "Sometimes," she answered softly, "-but not just now.            flaw Chandy rose and went over and sat by the window out of all patience with himself and her, and wisely re- solved to put a guard upon his actions in future, and was not surprised when, half an hour later, Bertha quietly refused to accompany his violin, saying she was tired and going to her room. The proposed festivity found great favor for its nov- elty, and the young ladies were invisible the whole of thenext day, planning their lures, They decided that they must: take' at least a week to construct them properly, and Aunt Elinor said the party should not take place till the following Wednesday, because she would have no unseemly crowding of amusements. Dolores also w6rked in seclusion, and spent much time on- her knees, begging that Chandy's hand might be guided to the dainty knot of black satin, which she laid upon her blessed prie IDieu, secretly hoping and believing that it would thereby gain in virtues. When the important day arrived, she put on her hat and went alone down to the priest, that she might confess and obtain absolution before the great event, and she thanked  the Virgin, and took courage, because   TEE -cNEOK'T-IE PARTY.     27i Chandy was the first person she met when she turned into the avenue on her return. "Ah, Dolores," said he, pleasantly, ," what a little; -  pilgrim you look, with your rosary! Did you tell your beads at Agnes' fountain?" ' No," she replied literally. "I have been gone to make confession ;" and she added with innocent frank- ness, "I do not so really, like the Padre O'Gourmand; he is so very much airish."  "Airlsh! why you, who are the very queen of airs and graces, surely should not find fault with your spiritual director for such cause.' 5 "But- it is not airs that I mean to say at all," re- plied Dolores with vivacious.- petulance; "he is so ' tosco, so-how shall I say, brusque; he speaks with brogans on his tongue, like the low fellows who dig the ditches." "Upon my word, Dolores," laughed Chandy,"you are as refreshing as a--cluster of camphire in the vine- yards of Engedi, and the new name you have fitted the old priest to is best of all.' Gourmand, for Gorman, is capital; his sleek, shiny face and comfojtable propor- tions show how   he tarries long at the wine, and loves the flesh-pots. You would be much less charm- ing if you spoke better English; pray don't ever per- feet yourself in my mother tongue." "You like me! I am glad, I shall tell you a secret: I know for certain that you will lie my novio for this evening."  "You do!" replied Chandos, with a slight frown;   "how have you made so sure that consummation de- voutly to be wished?" "It is because I am much prayed. I have confessed and am absolved, that now I am made pure, and good, to receive what I desire." "I have not the least doubt of your fitness for everything nice, you silly Dolores, and I thank your for numbering me among your blessings; but you should not place such bagatelles as this foolish party on your prayer-list; it seems like irreverence -a lowering of the sacred duty," replied the young man, much vexed with her manner, and the too plain language of her coaxing eyes. "I warn you not to Count on me; I may not be in the humor for subserviency, may take a fancy-- to look on, and enjoy the competition of the other com- petitors; I have not fairly made up my mind that I am  competent to have the responsibility of a woman for a whole evening." "But you will, then, Chandos, or I shall weep and make myself miserable. Promise that if you draw my favor from the box you will be my partner." She put her little hand on his arm, and raised her dazzling: glance, full of beseeching wilfulness; and as her quick eyes could not help discerning the cloud of unwilling- ness on his handsome face, two great tears sprang up, round drops, the sweet dash of a shower new shed, and her lips trembled. Chandy perforce observed her bewitching beauty, and what he had been only uneasily guessing was too ap- parents: this Spanish girl loved him-; the, passion was written legibly in her demeanor, impulsive, wilful], un-   THE NBECK-TIE PAB TY.     273 accustomed to trials, undisciplined in self-government. She loved him. And Chandy foresaw disagreeables in 'the future, and very nearly blamed good, quiet. Bertha for her share in his predicament. He softly lifted -her clasping hand from his sleeve, and held it, while he soberly said: ' If such a bagatelle can make you happy, Dolores, of course I will mingle amongst the applicants-for bow- ship, but you must not dwell so deeply upon an amuse- ment of an evening, or bestow uponit such weight in your thoughts; come, hasten to the house before this chilliness gives you a cold. I must take a brisk walk to take it out of my bones-g-ood-by." "May I not also come with you, Chandy! I have no fatigue."  ' Impossible, Dolores. JI am going to town." -"Why are you so hard-faced to me? what have I done? you did use to be much kinder on ships," said she reproachfully; "I will depart- away and trouble you no more." "Don't be vexed, Dolores; I am not cross, but you should not ask to walk with me; our young ladies do not make such requests of gentlemen; au revoir. We will- have a game of billiards after dinner, and you shall not pout your pretty lips at me, but be 'friendly and sweet." ( Oh, yes, I like you, Chandy. You do not hate me, then, do you . " "Hate you! no, child! What put that absurdity into your head? Come, now, let me see how fleetly you can use those-little feet.

Bertha Groenveldt had been sitting at her window, putting the last stitches to her apron, which she had fashioned from a bit of the dress she wore at the ball, when she was so happy, and Chandy so delightful; the tiny neck-tie of the same material lay on the table close at hand, and she gave it a little pat, occasionally thinking upon whose neck she should like to see it, and how rarely it would become  him; then, her work all done, she rose, shook off the clinging threads, and still ; thinking of the Christmas party and her dream, and Dolores' coming, and the unrestful consequences of her experiment, she walked about, putting her trifles m nice order, and so came and stood before the long casement, and caught sight of the man who 'was always her sub-thought, however schooled and held in cheek. He was standing beneath bthe leafless elms, holding the Spanish girl's hand in his; she could not know the topic of their talk, but she could plainly see that he looked steadfastly in her face, which was lifted, drinking eagerly his words. Bertha turned away from the sight, very pale; she opened a drawer of her bureau \/   T-E A Cs E-TZIE Pz. nTPY.   275 and flung in her apron-tossing the neck-tie after it as rubbish; she took another look at the pair. Chandy saw her, and pulled off his cap, grasping it in his fist by the top (a habit of his school-boy life, which she liked to see), and swinging it around his head. She returned his salute with quiet propriety. She saw them separate, and the race which completed the inter- view; she watched him out of the grounds, till the winding road hid him from her eyes; then she sighed wearily. "I must go to my good father," said she; "he needs- me; I can be useful to him." :When Dolores burst into her room, all smiles and tears, she found the helpful daughter, with her face in her hands; her eyes were dry, however, and she listened to the- prattle she had to hear kindly; the ecstatic praises of Chandos; the repetition of every word he had said; the recalling of every smile; the guessings, conjectures, hopes, fears, probabilities, concerning the partners of the evening; the reiterated account of her prayers, the ex- pected interference of the blessed Virgin on her behalf; the dress she would wear, the fan she would carry; a few more stories of Madrid life and ship-board atten- tions. Bertha took pleasantly the hug and kiss which the little rich-hued beauty bestowed at parting; and then she locked her door and went to sleep. Suffering made steady Bertha quiet, caused her to hide herself, like a wounded deer, made her sleepy, and her last re- flection before comforting insensibility enwrapped her was the conviction long ago established, "Women may love and never marry."   CHAPTER XXIII.

HE drawing of lots took place in the oak parlor, and I must stop a moment to tell you about this room, because it was certainly the most unique and attractive apartment I ever stood in Mrs. Stowe says, " in order to give a full description of anything, it is necessary to go back to the creation." But we will content ourselves with stopping at Uncle Alec's boyhood. When the heir of Craigenfels was a brisk, fun-loving lad in roundabouts, he used to play Robber's cave, in a great oak tree, which stood on the outside of the wood-lot, stretching its vast arms, and keeping intruders at a distance. King- of the forest, stately in majesty! The woodmen always spared that  tree ;:they did- not hack it down, although -it was hollow when Alec's father was born.* Fred Goldsmith and Paul Clayton fashioned a door over a cavity opened by time, and the boys were accustomed to hide inside after their forages of ladly mischief. And they had their den kept in order by some little girls they were  fond of-Elinor Walsingham, Alice Craigenfels, and Flossy Tillinghlast. Not that the two last named were of ally particular service, being fearful souls, who tire  . . .

The oil was an innpocuous fluid, being water from- the creek, well colored with black mud, made thick and slab as witches' broth. There they roasted their potatoes and chestnuts, and stealthily devoured the pilfered melons, which might have been theirs for the asking, and which relished. half ripe and full of stomach-ache, better than the most luscious fruits eaten openly, because of the mystery and adventure of their secret raids, and hot races, like the wicked flee when no man pursueth; their mystical passwords, brotherhood grips, and their signs and countersigns. It was sitting on a rude bench all cut and notched with names, under the old oak, that Alec Crajgeafels asked Elinor Walsingham to be his wifeand got his answer. Fred Goldsmith's first walk, when he returned from his long wanderings, took him instinctively to the remembered tree, and he lingered dreaming in its top-  most boughs till the pale stars came out and watched him. Paul Clayton brought his newly wedded Katherine to the favorite spot,'and sat with her in full-leafed shadow, recounting the merry freaks he loved to recall, and picturing his friends. And Elinor Walsingham */    .        r         ' ,' -" , "   -278   Y  THE ROBBERS CAO  E. , hastened away from their approach-hiding herself from the only man she ever loved. One evening a fearful wind-storm swept over the forest, and laid low the brave monarch who had ruled the wood so long. For many years it had been girded with iron, patched with tin, and tottering to its fall. It was the same night That Uncle Alec met with Belle Brandon at Wallack's, and upon his coming home. the first news which greeted him was the loss of his -old stronghold, the 'Robber's Cave. He had the wood carefully collected, and placed in the hands of a Toptown firm, giving them orders to get up a colony of Swiss carvers, and make the precious branches into furniture. Four years had been expended in the work, and now, upon our host's late return, the. labor was but just completed, and he opened the room for the first time to please his guests with their neck- tie party. The chairs -had each a shield upon the back, upon which was wrought a name, fancifully surrounded with flowers. Sabrina, viblets; Bertha, reposing on a bed of lilies and forget-me-nots; Zoe, gorgeous with cactus ' blooms; Clhristabel, embowered in pansies; Sonsie,. wreathed about with shamrock; Belle Brandon, crowned with heliotrope. There were besides six massive straight-backed arm- lhairs, ponderous andstately enough for thrones, named "Elinor, Alec, Alice, Fred, Paul, and Flossy,"' which stood apart, and above each of these there hung a picture of the owner, painted by Fred in the zenith of his powers. They were all admirable, of natural, high,   THE BOBBEZ SG   E   '    79:, 2 ' pure quality and exquisite finish; but the beauty of the dark-browed Elinor was something marvellous, and Uncle Alec' earned a thankful look when he brought her one day and showed her soulful semblance by the side of Paul Clayton, although she knew she might have been this generous man's wife and mistress of Craigenfels but for that unconfessed love. Belle Brandon came very near banishment, being heaped besides with resentful words; but Uncle Alec softly placed his hand upon the delicately wrought shield, covering the name from sight. "Let it stop, Ellen," said he; "the poor girl never brushed it with her robes, and I can think of her sitting: there, pure and childish as the young beauty I wished to make happy. He drew it into rank, and after his first love left him he stood bending over it, recall- ing the blonde as she looked repeating olytie's story, which she had somewhere picked upy,a fragment per- chance of her Rosenbloom Ovid; the transformation of the erring maid into the purple flower, which wor-: shipped her sun-lover, turning always her face towards his beams, and her ripe lips and creamy color, and the bewildering gleam of the blue -eyesshe had fastened upon him as she had been the odorous blossom, and he the Phcebus she adored, and then his sister's harsh saying, which he felt so cruelly true, "There's no fool like an old fool," and he walked softly out, ejaculating "O Lord." They were rich, were the six, in handicraft, each a story from the child-life of the friends. The mantle was- three brackets supporting bronzes, and below them   rows of tiling gaudily colored, and above these hung a remarkable picture of the Craigenfels crest, done by Madam  Groenveldt, in her bread-and-butter period, and the subject of an oft-repeated joke. The colors of the original being much dimmed by time, her father desired his daughter to make a faithful copy of the well-prized relic, which had been brought over by that first Alee, who was a good and faithful subject of King George.- A swan collared and lined was the emblem, and "In hoc signo vinco," the motto. The perfection of the painted bird must have been creditable to the youthful artist, because children who visited Craigenfels were accustomed to misname it, turkey, goose, guinea hen, which much teased Miss Groenveldt. And later, Pigeon Blair called his mamma's attention to the paint- ing, saying "Duck, duck." Every article of plenishing for the oak parlor was made from the robber's den, as well as the cornice and wainscot, ahd the floor was laid down in arabesques oh the indigenous woods of the mountains the mirrors framed in delicately cut acorns and leaves, mixed with our native fruits. Miss Walsingham," buxom, blithe, and debonair," sat upon her oaken throne, beneath the fair Elinor of eighteen, with- Mr. Craigenfels by her side. His head the semblance of a kingly crown had on, and he held in his hand a sceptre, rich in gilt paper, which he waved about occasionally, to show that he understood its use and purpose; and before them was placed the fatal box, upon which was carved in showy letters the words which puzzled fair Portia's suitors:   THE ROBB  S CAVE.     - 281 IF YOUT DO LOVE ME, YOU WILL FIND ME OUT o The youthful aspirants were led up by our Howadji, en astrologer, his crimson robes enriched with zodiacal signs, full moons, pigs, apes, unicorns, skulls, lizards, and other fearsome signs. Old Miss Petingill was busy among a chest of sheets which Miss Walsingham had unearthed in her house- wifely researches, and as she dragged Deacon Proddy into her chattering talk, affording much information of his sayings and doings to anybody she could hold as listener, Peace Pelican conceived the idea of in- ducing her to join their frolic, and try her luck upon the old gentleman, who, she faithfully promised, should certainly be of the party. And she meant to manage the drawing so that the ancient spinster should achieve her desire, and also be the source of a deal of fun. She had some trouble to coax her to consent, Chandy's trick yet being fresh in her mind; and besides, though Peace tried hard to look sedate and sympathizing, the roguishness would frolic in her black eyes, and lurk about the corners of her scarlet lips. "Law, Peace, what you talkin' about? You want to make a show of a poor old maid. Look at the wrinkles [pulling down her skinny throat, and craning up to peer at herself in the mirror]; 'tain't no ways likely the deacon would look at me if he did come.; the older- men gets the younger'they want their new wives." But she settled her front and straightened her collar, and thought how she would look in the deacon's pew at church, and presiding over his well-stocked house.   282 A     THE ROBBER'S CAVE. "Oh, no, dear Miss Petingill, I am sure Deacon Proddy is a sensible man ;. and you told me yesterday how he carried you down to conference meeting, and tucked you into the buffalo robes. Such attentions from widowers mean. something; they only require skilful, nursing. You had better take my advice." "You git out! --I shan't do no such thing," replied the ' - tailoress;:"I'm too old for such folderols." But when once the idea had taken possession of the spinster's mind, -she frisked around it, and co- quetted with it, and longed forit, till finally she hooked her snuffy fingers around the arm of her mischievous adviser, and opened the subject. 'a Ive a great mind to come in to the party, Peace, just for the notion on't; would ye, if ye was me. Now, come!"  a Certainly,5' replied Peace; "I will write the dea- con's invitation directly."     - "I s'pose its kinder silly, but' law! what on't?

Ad so the lone woman set to work upon her favor, half hopeful and half ashamed, although. tickled "with the novel idea. .It was so many years since any- body had proposed to her to do anything except. s" stitch, stitch, stitch .with fingers weary and worn," or lay out dead folks; or make soap, or some other un- pleasant job that no one else desired, and forwhich money was doled out. She constructed a wonderful tablier from a breadth   THE ROBBER'S CAVE.        283 of her lavender silk, which had been taken out the last time she turned the gown, just before Semanthy got married to her missionary; and a neck-tie which it / wouldn't have been wicked to worship, from the turn- down, after half an hour's debating whether she could afford to " sp'ile the piece." The aprons were diverse. I wondered how they could think of so many sorts; and as for colors, I be- lieve there was not one invented since the Fall that was not represented. M[rs. Jan was characteristically adorned with the true Irish flag, of shamrock green, having the ancient harp of Erin embroidered upon its satin sheen, with so rich' threading of yellow gold as showed what labor of love and pride it was to the skilful worker, whose lustrous eyes, bluer than the flax-flower, milk-white skin, brilliant cheeks, and supple, elastic grace, pro- claimed her Celtic origin, even before her tongue trilled among its r's. Jan Vedder was a proud his- band that evening (as when was he not?); and as for his little lady-mother, she simply worshipped her gifted daughter, reposing in her strength, enjoying her cul- ture. There were so many stars and stripes, and Jeers-de- /s, and tricolors, and blood-red pirates, that it was quite ' bewildering. The guests mingled together conversing, -  ..

They discussed politics, and the wiry captain, being a piping hot republican, poured all sorts of strong Saxon abuse , upon the Democratic leaders. "'They don't know so much as a sucking donkey; they ain't worth a last year's hen's nest," and so on. Mr. Nancesca Lankman, the organ of the Republican party, at least, the sub-editor of the Millville "Universe," while he approved the principles of the ardent partisan, was shocked by his coarse method of maintaining his opinions, and telegraphed a cabalistic word, " slang," to Mrs.:Lankman, who bobbed around her lord like a sea-green pin-cushion. The great man had crossed his hands, preparatory to improving the captain and his -mirthful supporter with some choice tit-bits from his great work, "My Toad under my Cabbage Leaf," when he was thrown off the track by Cabby, who frisked up and commenced a conversation. "When I was in Europe--" Since Peace Pelican's rebuff, Cymbalinus Adolphus had; kept away from Craigenfels, being, as we know, extremely busy trying to fit his neck to -the hymeneal -. halter; and had very nearly offered himself to the fair Adeliza, who indeed looked upon him as her property, to have and to scold till death them should part. lie had. rather stolen a- march upon the charmer this even- ing--left her to solitude.

And here he was a "roving blade ' -as old Miss Petingill observed-"-' dressed to fits,- his crush hat under his arm, and his hair parted down the middle.  He politelyinformed his neighbor that the "whole thing was provincial, very--a bore and a nuisance; he had never heard of such an amusement when he travelled abroad with a party." Somehow, having pranced into the vicinity of the politicians, he, as I said, commenced a speech with his favorite opening. Mr. Lankman eyed, the poacher on his manor wither- ingly, and projected at him. "When Iwas in Europe." Which Cabby capped-with a still louder blast from the same horn, and then the two butted at each other their travelling experiences, wagging their beards like a couple of mildly belligerent billy-goats over each. vociferous "-b-a-a!" Cabby out-Europed his adversary, insomuch that that breezy individual tucked- his sea-green pin-cushion under his arm, and departed, looking more a Pole; than ever. "Poor Miss Nancy!" said Peace; " old feller's occu- pation is gone." Miss Petingill enjoyed hugely the unwonted feeling that she was really taking part in a pleasure gathering, instead of hanging about the outskirts, a forlorn non- participant, whom nobody wanted; and she flourished her bergamot-scented handkerchief, ambling among the guests, to whom she volunteered a good many gratu- itous opinions and bits of information. g         r.....   : ' 286     THE ROBBERS CAVRE.

The number of guests being complete, the learned astrologer passed majestically about, the bullion tassels of his smoking-cap bobbing among his gray curls; and, his features adjusted to the solemnity due his responsible office. With his wand he divided the sheep from the goats----o, I mean the young men from the maidens-arranging them in two lines upon oppo- site sides of the great parlor, leaving a large space in the centre, in which the fated pairs were to take their places, ready for the march quadrille, and proceed thence to the ball-room.

Peter kept his mind's eye fixed upon Zoe's scarlet apron, and felt slyly among the neck-ties for any stray bit of satin he could reach through the narrow opening, and drew forth a pretty favor, which, alas! was not   TE' ROBBER'S. aAVE.      289. scarlet, and soberly set to work to find his mate, dread- ing where his chance mlight fall, because, always full of one constant love, he hated being promiscuously agreeable, and he had few favorites.

"YoU, so perfect and so peerless, are created of every crea- Iture's best." There was enough in Dolores to arrestthe attention. Her clear, oval face, long eyes, her mouth as blooming and red as a beautiful pink, her tender, impassioned, manners, her free, elegant carriage, her round arms   vog     HitEt' oUBBES CA AVE. and pretty hands, her graceful, ever-fluttering fan, the charming dress of lustrous black she wore, her heavy rosary, and gold ornaments. And Chandy's artist eye scanned her, while he pronounced the idle words, so pleasant to her ears. "Why, Dolores," he added, "you want but your graceful mantilla above those jasmines to make you ready for a moonlight stroll on the Prado." "Ah!" she replied, with a light pressure of her soft fingers upon his. "I am glad you remember our delicious evenings in Madrid; I wish we had never -come away. You were gay then, and not too proud to come and pedar lapoda, or give me some sweet sere- nade, and you looked so handsome with the feather in your peaked hat, and your foot on the step when you played the old guitar. The pretty moonbeams played on your face. -You were never cross then. Ah!" she replied, "let us return to the 'warm land, and be happy.'" She turned impulsively toward him with one of those indescribable looks from her bewildering eyes, before she quickly veiled them under her fringed lids. "Yes, indeed, child, those were pleasant occasions," -replied Chandos, after a moment's thought, tossing away some unpleasantness. "I was a free Bohemian then, with nothing else todo except dangle after you, and  help the other Bohemians fill up their hours agreeably. These days are made of sterner stuff, I have a position to support, and a name to achieve. So I left such fandangos on the Spanish soil, where they flourish like the olives and rose-bays."

He was her partner for the evening, and she entered into its amusements with absorbed delight; and she failed to observe the discontented glance with which he swept the parlor, seeking a face he missed, nor the gay heartshine which kindled in his eyes when he espied Bertha in a corner. Something he saw de- lighted him; it was not joyousness, because her cheeks were colorless and her lips compressed with painful thoughts. Chandy excused himself, and hastened over to her. "This is a fraud, Bertha, a malfaisance; and you not chosen yet, either. , What! Do you wear no aproni' t "No, Chandos.

"But you will dance with me before you go. I am sorry for the poor head. -A good waltz will cure it."' -Bertha smiled. "I will dance, of course, Chandy, if you desire it. I have half a dozen duty dances to go through; and may I ask you to make it as early as you can?"  "You dance no duty dance with me, Miss Groen- veldt!" said he, flushing up. "Unlessit is apleasure, I will release you." "Don't be vexed, Chandy; "' her eyes filled. "You know I always like having you for my partner."  "I have been vain enough to think so for a long *  .          v   u -., ^aVvJIJvLf^jf UA Vff yj  time, and hope I need not change my mindL' replied he, pointedly. I He returned to Dolores, who was impatiently waiting him (although Jasper Bisbee, actually ignored his elected to whisper to her), and marched down the long line with her on his arm, and Bertha chose a quiet nook in the ball-room, where she could watch him secretly-feeding upon his looks in hungry soli- tude, turning over his last speech in her thoughts, and the language of his handsome eyes. Although he was devoted to the Spanish girl, fulfill- ing all the conditions of his position, insomuch that her happiness radiated like a glory all around her, he found time to discover his friend Bertha in her retirement; and as soon as he could free himself he posted across to speak a little with her, and when their waltz ap- proached he nodded smilingly, holding up his pro- gramme. Waltzing, with Chandy, was the very poetry of motion-his firm, delicate manner of holding his partner, his light-footed airiness, his Perfect time, his absolute health of lungs, which gave him' breath to chat, and even hum the music they were floating in, the pleasant, clean, witty things he said, his purity from all sensuality of look or word, made his perfec- tion of manly beauty only a secondary charm; and it was evident he was sorry when the band ceased play- ing; forfhe said, lingeringly-  '"Now I must take my neck-tie back to its apron. Bertha, why could you not have been mine to-night  You ought to have prayed like Dolores. I really am   ,L'     rTHEV ROBBER'S OAV. V295 puzzled to understand why you got her"up here. You do not seem particularly fond of her."' As Bertha felt bound in honor to keep silence upon the manner of the invitation, she talked-of the dances; and he tarried a while, playing with her fan, and lis- tening, with his eyes on her face, her dress, and follow- ing the motions of her fingers, which whirled about a little ring she wore. 'What nice eyes you have, friend of my soul!" said he, at length. "You never dazzle a fellow; " and he added, mischievously tapping his breast, "Enough! I read your fortune in your glance. Is thtisthe ideal'- that you- worship so?" "Chandy, if I did not know what a good, sensible fellow you are with all your arrogant nonsense, I should say you were a terribly conceited, silly puppy." "Would you, really . Well, my friend's mind is a- glass where I may see my true proportions; and I'll tell you something, my quiet lady, so listen: If the gods should play some heavenly' mach, and on the wager lay an earthly woman, and Bertha one, there must be something else paired with the other; for the poor, rude world hath not thy fellow. Now, how do you feel "A "Serene and unruffled, sir. I know the drift and measure of your idle words; but, Chandy, seriously, you ought to be careful how you pour such stuff into-- some people's ears; they might believe you in earnest." "Ah, Dolores!

The Spanish girl came, undulating with supple mlo- tions, to look after her knight, -and the soft " querido" with which she addressed him sounded musically sweet. - Chandy glanced from one to the other. Could he have been weighing them in his mental balance? Lovely women both. The handsome fellow was not vainer or more egotistical than all men are; but he of course knew that he could have either of them for the asking.  Perhaps it seemed perfectly au regle that he should findisfavor in their eyes. All the girls and . all the women he had ever known had petted and ad- mired and done their utmost to spoil him. Chandy never seemed to know how handsome and graceful lihe was; but of course he did know it. Trust men for finding out any attractions they may happen' to have; and very few of them have the sense to conceal their ,knowledge. "Dolores is goingto make a good Catholic of me; aren't -you, novia ?-" "I hope so, truly," she replied with na'4ve frankness. "Well, I will make a bargain with you. You shall promise to read the hymn-book through, and I will undertake those stupid saints' lives you brought to feed me on yesterday. If I had not a pretty good opinion of myself, I might think that you thought me capable of reiishing thistles, like a certain long-eared animal that sings throughl its nose.' 'What is that-the hymn-book . I do not know." "It is a nice' little book, written by a good man named Watts.

There was Cabby. He walked mincingly up to the box, inserted- his fingers delicately into the orifice, and drew out old Miss Petingill's faded bit of lavender, which he contemplated with dainty horror through his eye-glass; and Chandy left the ranks on purpose officiously to offer to conduct hin to the spinster, who had tarried with most vinegar aspect, after Deacon Proddy was ' appropriated, to learn the fate of her favor. Chandy , marched the exquisite in front of his mate, and, pausing, gave him a choice bit of advice: "'If you be well pleased with this, And hold your fortune for your bliss, Pause here, where your lady is, And claim-her with a loving kiss.'" Those nearest smiled; and the enraged tailoress, still smarting with her disappointment, snatched the bow from -Cabby, who- held it at a distance, in his thumb and finger, and ambled indignantly away. "Stay!" called out Chandy; " give him your hand. So turtles pair who never mean to part." "I ain't a playin'," screamed she. "And if'Iwas, I wouldn't have nothin' to say to that critter. If I couldn't get picked out by a man, it ain't no sign I should take up with a billy-goat." She snuffed and snorted, and I dare say her thin life seemed a little drearier-shut up in her lonesome -chamber, where the distant music reminded her of the youth and gayety there was in the world for others- than before Peace Pelican's harmless bit of fun. There were two parties who felt considerable interest in Mr. Penhurst's fortune: Sabrina Bradshaw, who   THE ROBBS18 CA Y.        299 had 'been for some days in an uncertain humor, some- times all sweetness to the gentlemen, and sometimes holding herself with disdainful pride, and Sam Slaugh- ton. Poor Sam! 1He had- a sort of half-formed inten- tion to stake his success with the lady he loved upon the lottery of the evening. Both followed with their eyes the approach of the aspirant, and saw him draw forth his fate. Sam's quick glance toward Sabritia's purple apron and bright smile testified his feelings, as Pen held up a sombre token of saddestfeutile de morte ; and then our artist obeyed the solemn beck of the astrologer's wand with brisk step, and turned back, holding his head high, and made his bow to the Silver Lake Goddess. "Here I am, fastened to your apron-string t?' said he, admiring the royal-hued scarf.

"Couldn't you make me a life partner? There is a parson right convenient. There! it's out now. Give me my answer quick, please." Sam's fingers trembled, as he busied them in adjust- ing his great gleaming solitaire upon the violet sheen, which matched him for one evening to the woman who carried his heart in her hand. Just one word, and she, would toss it back to -him, or she would be his forever  and while he put his question in a light tone, beads of sweat started on his face.

"No, Sam," replied she half regretfully; " a parson could not tie us together, because, although I like you' very much, I do not love you." "And never can, I suppose won't even try?" said Sam, in the same light tone, which hurt Sabrina, know- ing him so well, more than reproaches could have done; but she answered-steadily, with sorrpwful face: "Never, dear friend. I am ashamed that you asked me, because I ought so to have behaved that you must have seen I did not love you." "Well, well! drop it, then; no harm done.' Come, let's waltz; you are my shadow for this evening, any.- how. I'll make the most of that." Through the music of -one Of Straus' richest beauties poor Sam twirled, in an uneasy dream, and its steady time-beats knocked. at his ears in aw dull refrain, tire- somely repeated-  "What care I how'fair she be, So she be not fair for me?"

F course Deacon Proddy could dance nothing more modern than reels anld contras, arid as Peace Pelican was in for it, she made the mnost of the occasion, after her usual fashion of accomodat-, ing herself to circumstances.

"Ain't you ashamed to flirt so outrageously with that old deacon," said Susie, when it came to her turn to take Peace's h]and, " four in a line." "I'm not-flirting, miss! I scorn the soft impeach- ment. I'm only doing my duty, trying to make Mr. Craigenfels' party a success. I never flirt." After the dance was finished, the old gentleman gal- lantly offered his arm. "I do vum! I never did have such a good dance as that, not-when I was a young sprig, setting up to the girls; you've got a pat foot for a reel; you know it well enough, I des say, 'thout my tellin' you, you spry creatur' you.' Peace glanced swiftly around to see who was listen- ing. Chandy was not in the neighborhood, and nobody ' seemed attending. "Thanks, Deacon Proddy; I am glad you enjoyed it. I like to dance with a person who isn't afraid to take steps; such sleepiness as some of these young men put into their motions! Really, it makes me yawn to look at them." ' Jes' so, pardner; I think jest as you do,;" he patted the small hand reposing on his coat-sleeve, and gazed benignantly at her glowing face. HHe had been a tall man in his prime, but a stoop in his shoulders brought him down now, and this tall, dashing girl stood,as high -as he. "I should like to have you for pardner always. I should so.

The floating teacher of- IEosenbloom, transplanted, you remember, to the house- hold of her beloved Chris, was still rather red-nosed, but no longer thin. Her sharp eyes had the busiest, lovingest, happiest outlook; and her trim person was neatly, nay, elegantly attired, in well-fitting dress of  heavy rustling silk. She enjoyed roundly her life of work in her pleasant home, and among her much- cherished pupils, who caressed and petted her till her very heart bubbled over with joy. Peace left the two together, and after some conver- sation, and a good deal of mutual survey, Deacon Proddy bore down upon the subject which-was domin- nant in his mind.

Bertha thought over Ohandy's con- duct, and felt as if he was not acting quite right, not coming fully up to her expectations, nor doing jus- tice to the noble manhood which was in him; and she was pretty sure she should, like the pale primroses, die unmarried. Mr. Penhurst revolved old Miss Petingill's gratuitous information upon the tastes and dispositions of the Sil- ver Lake Goddess, whose superbwomanhood had never seemed richer or more glorious than this evening with the poor moth, Sam, fluttering around her, while Ae was constrained to play attentive to Mrs. Bowles. But he found little in her demeanor to encourage him in the hope that he should be so favored as to turn her hatred of the men" into liking, or be the happy win- ner, where so many had been refused and rejected. Not that he had anyidea of giving up--only he failed' to see his way clear. Sabrina conned over a; Pen's looks, all X s 'words his gestures, felt injured because he had not once   PEA CE PELIGAN OU' WiT   . ED. 3" danced with her. Acknowledging his full merit, she sighed, and uttered aloud two words before she said her prayers--"A widower!"  Chandy laughed, reviewing his successful tricks; thought a good deal about his nice waltz with Bertha, whistled the music all through, and took a few fancy whirls around his apartment; made a wry face at re- membering Dolores, resolved to induce her inviter to manage somehow to curtail the, little Spaniard's visit, and fell asleep with one shapely hand under his head, and his brown curls tossed all about his pillow, while the deep crimson brightened his cheeks and his parted lips, just as it used when his poor grim, gaunt mother let herself creep stealthily to his bedside, to kiss and worship her handsome boy in secret. Jasper Bisbee thought about Dolores' eyes, and wished she would look at him as she did at Chandy, and locked carefully'away a yellow- jasmine dropped from her raven hair. Peace Pelican sat brooding over ,her lone fire, sometimes laughing lightly, and anon frowning; she was recalling old Miss Petingill's queer behavior, and her remarkable get-up. Then she brought up the forlorn, dreary face she had showed after the drawing, and she felt truly sorry she had plagued her, and re- solved to find out early in the morning what she de' sired most of all things in the world (next to Deacon Proddy), and straightway to supply the need.

And she left all other themes to turn over in her mischief-begetting brain sundry tricks by which to pay him off. She 'rose, wrapped a scarlet shawl over her floating white drapery, felt of her blue carl-papers, took a look at her rosy feet in their satin slippers, and lighting her candle she passed into the silent hall, too quiet even for an echo; she [  .  glided like a thistle-down over the soft carpet, and paused before a solitary door in an odd little angle, quite shut off from the other chamnbers, it being the second story of the cosy parlor, all bay-window, and the favorite Abode of Sir John Chandos. h She looked around for what she wanted, and placing her candlestick on the floor, proceeded noiselessly to draw up before his door (opening inward), first a table, upon it a stand, then a f6otstool, then an empty bird- cage (tie cat .having eaten the caiary and laughed about it), then three ehairs, and carefully poised upon them a japanned tea-tray which Jessie had brought, , holding the young gentlemen's Congress water, and then she paused, thinking what else. She ran down to the kitchen, and brought thence half a dozen of Deb's bright tin basins, a vinegar-jug-and the,poker and tongs. -. Havmg built up her hecatomb  to her sat isfaction, she stood a  moment to admire her work, shook her little'list at the door, tossed her head, and performed the contortion of visage which children call making a face, kissed her-fingers, picked up her candle, and like   A   --  PElaE PICAN   OUTPITTED.     313-  e Lady Macheth, went "to bed, to bed!" chuckling over her exploit. The next morning the busy worker rose betimes, and took a peep at her mine; everything was quiet, and she ran beaming down to breakfast. The guests came  strolling in, and Aunt Elinor presided with her usual I   dignity, and' Uncle Alec sipped his, coffee and fed Dholy. Dolores was rather late; she paused by the door, 'i'5 ' searching the room with one of her brillianit glances. By -  '"Where is Chandos a asked she petulantly. "I've my lesson all ready, and he promised to hear me this morning, and show me how much he had read." She had a small hymn-book in her hand, which she had been diligently studying all the way downstairs. "Sure enough," spoke up the, host; 'we do miss Chandos from our number; know you anything of his whereabouts, niece? You are accustomed to take early strolls, I believe, in thecodmpany of the knight richin manly virtues." "No, sir," answered she, smiling; "I imagine he has overslept. I was pledged to a ride on Zephyr at seven, but as my escort failed to appear I went alone," Dolores looked troubled, and threw down her hymn- book.

"Why has he not asked me?.   - Uncle Alee observed her stormy pout in some amuse- ment, and glanced from her rich, dark face to hiS pale, quiet niece; and a new thought seemed to strike hifm,  for he muttered:            ' "O Lord!

Pen -made no reply, but he darted a look at her, which said he should like to teach her to bridle her saucy tongue. Showy, witty, graceful, brilliant, merry, and well-bred, she evidently did not please Mr. Pen- hurst, and his eyes turned quickly upon her neighbor; and so he caught the queer, weighing-up expression which so often puzzled him; and though Sabrina dropped -her lids haughtily, he turned it over in his mind while he enjoyed the harmonious picture she made in her purple robes and fresh violets-serene, devout, and pure, sober, steadfast, and demure, but not propitious. "You about to leave us, Mr. Craigenfels?" asked Samo, "Yes, my boy; we shall be absent the whole day. Elinor wants some sheep for the Quince Bush, and I must see my Toptown Mining Company. This being Pigeon's birthday, we dine at the Horse-shoe this evening. You can apply what discipline you please to lazdy Chandy. I think a short fast might benefit him, eh-!

Dolores crossed herself hastily-any reference to spirits always disturbed her equilibrium, andd set her starting and searching corners. Uncle Alec noticed. the action-he had seen it a hundred times before-and he said to himself softly, as he was buttoning on his coat:  'O Lokrd! I hope Chandy isn't going to make a fool of himself; " and he also determined to confer with Bertha upon the expediency of shortening her guest's visit. Peace kept her ears strained for the expected clatter, but no clatter sounded; and as- Sam went 'off to -the studio, Mr. Penhurst invited Sabrina to a game of billiards, and the others, excepting Dolores, who pre- ferred -her Dr. Watts, adjourned to the library for their Shakespeare reading. She excused herself from the "gentle Hero's" part, and remained over her Berlin wools, waiting. The student's whispered crooning of "ife has a soft, a silver thread" made her nervous, more especially as she constantly interrupted her lesson with petulant wonder at the non-appearance of- Sir, John. It got on to be 11 o'clock, and Peace began toe be really uneasy; 12-no Chandy,no clatter.

What if the poker had knocked him down the tongs dashed out his brains? What if he were lying, at the very instant bleeding and insensible beneath her precious hecatomb. She began to feet quite certain that something had happened, because it was not like the young man to remain in durance a whole morning without making a fuss; she was just coming to the point of stealing up to i-   see for herself, when laughing, clapping of h ands, and calls for "Chandy " in the upper regions made her fly to the spot. There was Deb in the midst of the assembled guests - (brought there by Patty the housemaid, to see the "snarl of notions "Mr. Goldsmith had got at his door), spouting  poetry, "Captive Knight," "Prisoner of Chillon," etc., urgently inquiring for the other= six (sleepers), daring him to "come forth, Victor Gal- braith!" which uproar subsided after a while into single ?    calls of his name; then into ominous silence, while the ::::S  listeners distinctly heard low groans inside the room. Sam pulled down the barricade, and tried the door, which was fast; and they could see the key in its ward, so that it was evident he could not have escaped and to all their calls they got no reply except the moans of anguish. "Chandos must be ill," said Bertha, very pale. "He isn't; -he is only trying to frighten us," replied Peace.  "I understand his tricks and his manners- too well. What should have made him ill, pray?

Sam had been quietly busy at the keyhole; he lifted his face; there was an odd odor in the room. "It can't be, I suppose, that he has become asphyxiated--never burns charcoal, does he?" "No," replied Deb; "I think not, though he may. I remember, lhe did ring last night for something. I'll run and ask Jesse what he brought the young gentle- man.

" IIDAY  evening was clear starlight, and ,i  Jan Vedder's preparations complete and most -" magnificent for his skating festival. The banks of Roaring River, on the Flats, were illnmi- nated for a quarter of a mile or so with pine torches on tall poles, which poured a weird, flickering light upon the group, full of ghostly suggestions, and the dense, pitchy smoke towered above them, like a black curtain shutting out the sky; the skaters, skimming swiftly to and fro, were enveloped in the red beams, as in a fiery mantle, and anon quenched in outer 'darkness. As they passed beyond the sphere of the flaming minis- ters, doing their duty (powerful, however, only within a certain radius: men can shine, but in defined limits), thie lanterns fastened to their wrists, looked like floating earth-stars, as they moved in the dense shadow. There was a great booth for the band, who discoursed sweet music, and refreshment lodges, where delicate cookery was offered to. the guests, by boys and' girls in gay costumes. In a   little Swiss chalet, a peasant maiden exhibited the produce of her dairy, to which she invited the passers by a blast from her Alpine   8AJSJeir y^ yi:S-SEB MABTS.     321. . horn. A gipsy fortune-teller, in scarlet cloak, plied - her palmistry, to the infinite amusement of her appli- cants. A coffee tent sent forth a fragrant odor, per- fectly irresistible to all lovers of --the exhilarating berry, and a white-aproned waiter brought out inex- haustible relays of hot oysters-scalloped, roasted, fried, stewed, all in most exquisite perfection; and the thousand American pies and sweet cakes, upon which our youth is fed, were there in fabulous quantities - delicate, crisp, melting, spiced, spongy, mottled, jellied -not one wanting; tables loaded with turkeys, chick- ens, ducks, hams, tender celery, pink radishes, green lettuce, preserves, and fruits. Every preparation was made to please the palate and promote dyspepsia.  Our Roaring River friends were all there. I have been accustomed to admire the hearty way in which these people picked upany employment, be it charity, business, or jollity. ]Mr. Bradshaw, Uncle Alec, and Dr. Jenkins had on their skates, and dashed about and cut curlicues with the best of them; George Blair and Ruthie, Chris and Otho, Zoe and Peter, and Sonsie and Jan, all prime skaters, and all characteristically attired, skimmed like birds over the smooth ice, chatted, sang choruses, while  the children danced quadrilles, and tried-races, and ate goodies to the top of their bent. Dolores Zambrano was completely happy. Chandos attended her. Bertha looked ,quiet and pleasant with Norris Jenkins, and if not fully satisfied nobody knew  it. Jasper Bisbee hung about the Spanish girl, having secured her promise of a couple of turns, and Peace: "'*   Pelican was brilliant, provoking, and captious in argu- M bfi t" "  -th  T ran c'-,  lj ay th orn  O,  wh  mernt with Francis taythorne, who didn't care a fig for skating and only came down 'to look at the curious Show. .-. . Sabrina Bradshaw was not in humor for participat- ing/in the merry-making; because she had that moning parted from- her old and tried friend, Sam Slaughton. Although he. went carelessly, making no adieus, but such as suited a couple of days' absence at Toptown, she knew right well that he meant not to return. He said he was going to Joppa, and said it with a smile, and asked: what he should fetch her thence, and if she wouldn't lilke a heathen Chinee, supposing he concluded to go once more around the world. But the pain underlying his gayety weighed upon her spirits, and compelled her to think. Now that he wasreally gone, she was by no means sure she should ever love a man any better than she did this one, whose worth she knew, whose society she liked, whose manhood and rich gifts she admired and appreciated. She haughtily declined Mr. Penhursts escortage giving him a decided cold -shoulder and after skat- ing up and down a few times among her intimates, she complained--of weariness, and went over to Brookedge, to sit With her mother and Mrs. Vedder, who were snugly housed, looking out at the panorama they had no wish to share t -Sabrina sat down before the window-she sought among the moving figures -for a tall gentleman, whose every Attitude andgesture she hadgotten byheart, even in'the few weeks she had known him, andwas vexed  - , ,-   SABRINAP FINDS  EMB  -    - T-23 when she detected herself doing so. She compared him with Sam, with others, and: tried to understand herself, and felt pretty certain she did not desire to ? have him for master; if she should bend her proud neck to a yoke, she did not mean her's to be the second which it had galled. Indeed, she was nearly- sure-, to-night, when her best friend was gone-that Mr. Pen- hurst was nothing whatever to her. There was no arrogance or assumption in her medi- tations; of course she knew intuitively that this new acquaintance would some time ask her to be his wife-- if she let him-and she thought--yes, was quite certain -that if he did she would say "No."'  Captain' Slocuma brought down his adopted Sunny, and directly he appeared his carriage was surrounded  by his companions, among whom hewas a prime favor- ite. He was all enwrapped in furs, .and sedately en- joyed the brilliant phantasy of the exciting -scene, which wavered in his sight to and fro, like the actors in a tale out of one of his fairy books. They pushed the pretty sleigh his doting father had made that he might enjoy his winter sports among those of his age; who were always glad to keep him amongst them, and. take turns in being his fiery steeds, till he had. 'o everybody he liked, and looked in at all the tents, and tasted the sweets, and then he begged to be left that he might enjoy the queer sights, ou-t of the way of thix ' crowd. The captain, who had kept close in his vicinity, went away for a few moments, leaving the boy in care - f  racie Jenkins, who preferred stopping at his side : to skating with the gayest, and the two were deep'ml a    ;324    SABR   IX S DID HER ZASTERI magic. delight, which Sunny had -culled from -a German garden that very day, when Tip Williams and Prance Pedlow came along, and began chafing the cripple, and pulling Gracie's curls, and making them- selves generally unpleasant; and Gracie, who was as timid as a dove, was dreadfully afraid of the rude boys, and trembled, and looked around for friends and suc- cor. Alas! they were quite alone; but when they laid profane hands upon Sunny's carriage, and threatened to run him off, she bravely kept her hold, and tearfully begged them to go away. Hier poor little arms were all too slender to cope with the great muscles of the rough fellows, and they tore the poles from her slight fingers, and dashed off with an exulting laugh, leaving the prgetty maid fluttering on the ice where she had fallen.- As they loomed out of the shadow, where Sunny had prayed to be left, the better to enjoy the play of the red radiance afar, and the animated motion before him, Biddy Flannigan espied them, and comprehending their wicked trick, she skated swiftly after them, calling on them to stop, keeping up a running fire of reproaches , as: she sped, till she managed to seize the side of the little vehicle, and give it a swift twirl; but in doing so she lost her balance and fell, so loosing her hold; and thee young reprobates, who had with difficulty kept -   their legs, went stumbling and reeling on, sending back '^  - opprobrious epithets as they fled. Their random prog- ress very nearly overset Mr. Penhurst, who had been j.   standing about, absently watching the groups and deeply thinking, while he knqcked- heel!essly with his   I SAEBmau pIN)8S HER MASTER   325 long pole the thin crust of a hole, over which was placed a laming light, and a placard "Dangerous." The icO company had been harvesting that day, and the evening's cold was scarcely enough to skim over the water with a fresh coating. The bdys saw their danger, but could not pause. The swift sleigh had got such speed now that it mastered them, dragging them on, and without presence of mind to quit their grasp of the pole, leaving the cripple to his fate, even if they had been hard-hearted enough to do it, they all plunged into the treacherous trap. Pen saw Sunny's pale face, and caught a hopeless, sedate look, as he disappeared. He hesitated not an instant, but plunged after them, and, getting Prance by the hair, he threw him out on the ice, as he would a dog. He 'brought up the little sleigh, but the cripple was not in it, and he tried again. It was a couple of minutes be- fore he found him, and he had to dive under the thick ice, so that when the poor lad was saved,Pen was quite chilled, and very nearly insensible. He managed to get out, and staggered a couple of steps, scarcely know- ing where he was, and just escaped dropping back into the water, and was only kept from it by sturdy little ]Biddy Flannigan, who held him by main force, while her shrill voice brought help to the spot. Chandy took up the lifeless child, Peter and Otho lifting his pre- server, and they started for Brookedge, leaving Prance to look out for himself, which he did, shaking his drip- ping person and scuttling away half frozen, and nearly: !     frightened, to death. , "Bad luck to ye!" said Biddy; "you've come to the   ou v   ABsRIA  MFIDS BHER MASTER top to do -a fresh mischief, in course; but ye've had a good washing anyhow." In the hurry and confusion nobody thought about Tip Williams. His mother left the light burning in her bedroom, and had her raw hide all ready to welcome his arrival, but he never came home again. He was fished up afterwards with the fur robes belonging to Sunny's sleigh, and it was supposed that he had got entangled with them. And so he slept his last sleep on the bed of Roaring- River.    . When Sabrina Bradshaw saw the men come in, and- caughta -sight of the burden they carried, she flew to- ward it with a great cry of love and pity, and in that moment she kniew where her life belonged, and to whom she owed fealty. Returning consciousness found her at Penhurst's side, his dead, cold hand clasped in her warnm living one, her deep carnelian eyes looking life into his, yet bewildered with the death sights he had seen; his ears ringing with the singing of the waters caught a wave of her tunefiul voice. The first word he uttered was "Sabrina, and she replied "Penhurst." He always said he never made her any offer matri- monially. i  ',' f              '  '   e :  * * '^ , CHAPTER XXVI. THE M3AGIO NUMER BROKENE-ONLY SIX LEFT.' IIANKS to a strong constitution, Mr. PenhUrst soon recovered. He went the -next morning to Craigenfels accompanied by Sabrina, and a: few days on the sofa were all he needed. He looked pale and interesting--Peace Pelican told him so-and "extremely snippy," she added, so to take the keen edge off her compliment. I believe Miss Bradshaw never once thought of the lost Annie during these good tirtes, of the tombstone, on the hill-top, nor bewailed the terrible fact that she had really fallen in love, surrendered her precious lib- erty, promised her wifely fealty to a widower!  but she moved superbly about the great drawing-room;  some- thing changed from her old stately self, wearing over -her beauties and graces an indescribable charm which the love of a good, strong, honest man is'sure to weave around the woman who feels worthy of it, a'd has thankfully accepted it as her source of happiness. They were the same chess-men the couple had, been ac- customed to use, but they meant more :than mere pup- pets9 for playing out' the old -queen's gambit.:: 3re -was the pawn upon which he had seen her rosy fi et z               ;328   Vt  A ztz rAaVa rM B BROKE. close that night when she rose to attend to Barney'e needs, and that white-king had roved ai'lessly abot for half an hour, one pleasant sitting, seeking rest for r I  his royal dignity and finding none. She had ended his reign with a humiliating stale-mate, and sat for the rest of the evening with her fair hand idly busy among -: the pieces, while she talked and listened. As soon as Pen was able to goout she asked him to    come home with her and get her mother's blessing; with true Bradshawian straightforwardness, she walked up to the little flaxen-haired beauty, knitting. ,i, "  LMammna, look! ' said she; ' I have brought you ah- other to pet and be good to; will you have him for your boy . ' The mother rose eageily, and offered both her hands. - Indeed will I, darlingif you will have him for your husband," she answered. It was a very pleasant reception that Pen got from ;  them all, down to Pauline, who confided to him some newr developments concerning the talents and abilities of General Grant's kittens. Before they returned to Craigenfels the mother and daughter had- a quiet talk, holding each other's hands and looking into each other's eyes. Don't tell anybody, pretty mamma," said Sabrina at the close; ', they don't know it up there, and I don't feel inclined to speak about it at present, except to my home-lovers.

Don't you think he talks sensibly? Aid he can al- ways think of something to say to every one; his man- ners are perfection, so cordial, and so thoroughly kind and manly.     - :Close  Mrs. Bradshaw assented to all her daughter's prop-  ositions, and secretly thought that her Sabrina in love was exceeding lovely, and amazingly likes all other girls in the same circumstances. Sunny Slocum-never left his bed; he slept ill; was troubled at night with terrible dreams of the old hag . and her whip, and when Dulcet bent over him,com- forting his perturbed heart, holding his trembling hand, he whispered a request to stop where he was for a little while. He knew for sure that Mrs. Jan would let him, and it was so nice to look at her; and, " mamma,"5 he i  added, -"won't you ask Gracie's mother to leave her here- too? I know she wants to stay, and I ;want to have her, and it won't be long." Dulcet went away with tearful eyes. She saw how ,; it would end, and she dreaded to tell the captain, whose heart was bound up in this useless little cripple. Mrs. Jenkins kindly acceded to the child's request, '   and both young faces, the fading and the bright one, looked serenely happy. The two were left alone one day, and Gracie had been reading, "Alice- in Wonderland." He called her softly; she laid down the book, nestled close to the bed-he could not speak loud, because his strength was but weakness. "I'm going to die, Gracie," said he. " There, don't cry; I hated to tell you; I know you hadn't thought of   it, but it's so; I'm going to die before long, too. Look at my hand; you can see through it, almost. / I don't want to, get well. They're all very kind to me, and I love them dear; but I'd rather go. The boys call me 'humpt: dumpty;' I am not like others; I shall never be a strong, brave man, like Jan Vedder, but always a weak, ugly cripple; my legs ain't good foranything, and my arms are too long; I don't like'em; I like handsome boys; I'd rather go to heaven, and I am sure that the Lord- Jesus will give me a new body up there; and, Gra- cie, when you come I'll have you for my wife.

I can comfort him bet- ter than anybody."  When Sonsie came in and stooped her rosy face to his and kissed him, he threw his arms around her neck. Thank- you for your sweet kiss," hispered he. "You let me be called by your name, and I've tried to keep it clean: I wouldn't ever have got a spot on it, not if I had lived a hundred years. I'm so glad to die here with you. Won't you kiss me again? Your lips feel so freqh and cool on my cheek!

How beautiful and straight and tall you looked! I  shall be- tall and straight too, up there. Sunny did comfort the kind couple who had cher- ished his weakness so tenderly, and surrounded him with blessings; but it was hard to part with the -sweet- tempered child, whose helplessness had made him -so precious to them; and his steady truth was so endear- ing. The last sigh was spent, and the humpback had his wish. Hp had got free from his deformities and was a perfect creature at last. "'Seven rams, seven lambs! Oh, my poor heart!"  groaned the captain. "We're only six. How can I bear to live without my angel's face to smile on me I Don't you remember, Sonsie, how he said,' I'm going to be a good boy as long as I stay!

BERTHA'S VATRT:N'JL. ^ATNDOS GOLDSMTH was very busy in- deed, and he worked in secret with the door of his studio locked. His faithful friend and fellow-artist having departed, he was left to solitary occupation of the atelier, though I can't say he missed him especially just at present, though the empty easel where had stood the golden-haired Ruth might have reminded him of his loss. 'Poor Sam had put his effects together very quietly,' after Sabrina's last sitting, and had written from Top- -town for themt to be sent after him. But Chandos was not working upon his Ruth now, though it stood upon his easel, and he looked at it from time to time. St. Valentine's Day was close at hand, and our young knight was getting ready for it; having taken a -whim to present his favorites with a picture apiece, appropriate, to the day. And when self-indulgent Chandy, took a notion into his head, he pursued it to a successful completion. There was a   good deal of scribbling in private among the guests at Craigenfels, and a vast amount of   -Jf      BERTHF'S- Vrf ira MS.   333a s rummaging done through the old and new poets of the great libraryv; some comparing of notes and merry banter; people meeting on the broad staircase would - suddenly break forth into couplets, and "love and : i   dove, heart and dart," were favorite rhymes. Uncle Alec gave sage advice; and Aunt Elinor, being consulted, unlocked an old desk which had never been H   removed from the chamber she occupied in the mansion as a child and maiden, and read over some yellow Xpapers ornamented with cupids and arrows, -and offered them for copying to those who could not other. wise suit themselves. Dolores made a novena to obtain a certain wish she had deeply :at heart. Peace Pelican jested and advised, and condoled and laughed, m    and flirted and accomplished -a vast deal of work for: others and herself. The guests had been shut in together for a week or more by heavy rains, which had melted all the ice out of Roaring River, and sent the waters dashing over the rocks at Mad Falls-like a spring freshet; -and Turks IRead was dressed in mist-wreaths and vapor mantles all day long, and much. labor had been wrought, -of i    very diverse kinds, as well as pleasant converse held j   among the workers. }iH    Mary McCross thought it would be a good -time to get Biddy Flannigan ready for school, and had gained a reluctant consent from'the parents, who, scarcely dared to let their child among the roaring lions of heretics' children, 'where the Holy Bible was read night and morning; and at last they consented, in fear and trembling lest Father O'Gorman should find out   v     -- ... . . , / r X'l'r /V l;L , their heinous crime, and bring them to book- for it. Htaving gotten- the consent, dIary set the young ladies at' work upon the clothes, a task which thy pushed zealously. Pauline 'Bradshaw, following the example of her elders, begged her father to give herfriend a year in, Milviille Academy, and attended there regularly her- self tokeep the child in countenance-  Sabrina had no trouble to coax :Barney to:become a scholar, and undertook. to defray the expenses of his-education. It must not-be supposed that all thin was accomplished without trouble and weariness, and many unpleasant- neses  because the people, beingin mortalfear of- their holy fathers; were rather vacillating in their conduct to heir heretic friends; sometimes the suspicions con- stantly poured into their minds would have rule, and then- they turned a little sour-faced or sulky. But- as people who resolve to benefit others have to expect those things, our young Roaring Riverites had long ago become accustomed to them, and pushed ahead as serenely as though  all the good purpose was under-- stood, and their self-sacrificing undertakings appre- ciated. The Christmas festivities were drawing to a close, because Penhurst must be at home  among his factory folk, and, also because of the access- of business piling up, belonng to the great 'Condensed Beef Com- pany'-of. which he was' director and secretary. A new man:.had got to be sent to Brazil, to inspect the works and bring back statements; and a  thoroughly competent person was exceeding difficult to find.

Now my day's work is spoiled, because, forsooth, I must repair damages, or, as Peace 'says, "pitch into housekeeping."  How nice it would be if we Ameri- can women, instead of having three or four stories to see after, could live on "a flat," have all our meals sent to us, and the family washing done out, and so get leisure for cultivation, and educating our children! I suppose there is no people on the face of the globe who make such a fuss about their daily living as thle Americans. No doubt it is a great art to manage a house successfully. It is abundantly certain that a wife who accomplishes it thoroughly cannot do any- thing else, and she' certainly earns the right to have inscribed on her tombstone, ('Here lies a good house- keeper; " but I think there are occupations quite as ben- eficial to the race; as well as infinitely more nourishing to the human soul. The Howadji was about th return to his art school; Bertha, also, was summoned home to Rosenbloom by her mother; and Aunt Elinor could no longer be absent from her beloved Quince Bush; and Peace Pelican had spasms of violent anxiety to see her brother Charlie, FWho was her oppressive source of   BERTHAS - VA TN'TINE.     337 uneasminess, -on account' of certain habits growing out of the hated liquor trade. The great day dawned at length, and Sabrina Brad- shaw lifted her window and looked out. The morn- ;  ing sky was dashed with lovely tints, now brilliant rose-color, most dazrling, the shootinig silver rays playing over it, threaded with opal and orange, such as artists dream of, but cannot paint; transparent ruby and flaming crimson, mother-of-pearl "hues, inlaid upon the sapphire transparency, with embellishing of agate and adavanturine, lapis lazuli, and shadowy grty, till Craigenfels mountain seemed to have donned a fabulous robe bespangled and bordered with brilliancy; and then the diverse coloring became absorbed in the royal splendor of the full-orbed sun. She enjoyed the changing sumptuousness, ever fresh, ever new, and the air " sober, soft, and sweet." "Ah!"' said she aloud, "St. Joseph is propitious to his brother; he has bestowed upon his festival a good bit of sunshine, and a warm south wind." While the friendly breeze kissed the stately girl's' cheek and played with her auburn hair, she let her thoughts rest agreeably upon the man she had accepted as her heart's master. We remember that she had used to say, I cannot understand how it comes to pass that a woman brings herself to give up her individuality, resigns her sweet liberty, and bends her will' to a master." It was no mystery now, and she felt the most abounding joy, the calmest repose and satisfaction in the life before her. She was thinking about it, and about Mr. Penhurst, intensely enjoying her thoughts, ,15,         .   r;5 ;5   BERTHA'$S VArETI E. her earnest, absorbing love, and planning a day in his company; and with feminine inconstancy, she hastily closed her window and withdrew when she saw him coming up from the beck; she scarcely returned the bow he gave her, and' though she despised supersti- tions,. a smile of heartfelt satisfaction beamed over her pure-hued face, and she was really glad he was the first man she had seen on this choosing morning. Paulin e and Oracie and Dick were ubiquitous. Scarcely had the first gleam of day-dawn peeped over the mountain, when they knocked at Uncle Alec's door, with their "Good-morrow, Valentine," thrice re- peated, which secured them a gift. Aunt Elinor also was handsomely caught, and responded, calling the young rogues to her bed-side to bestow the treasures she had prepared in anticipation of the greeting, and which she gave with hugs and kisses. Peace Pelican was not so lucky. After being fullv awaked by the roving children, she took a whim to try her fortune. She heard the host moving about his room, and she hastened to dress, and knocked at his door. -He opened it immediately--but unfortunately the ft rays of the sun kissed her eyelids at the instant, and she was sent back by the laughing host. Nay, my daughter, you are sunburned, and must sit with Beatrice in the corner, and cry 'heigh-ho' fcr a husband." She heard Chandy coming through the hall, and tried another chance. Extending her begging hand, as taught by the little folks, she accosted him:   BERTH!'S VA r  ftIN . R3       -39. "'Good-morning to you, Valentine I Curl your locks as I do mine, Two before, and three behind, " And I'll choose you for Valentine. ' "Much obliged, I'm sure," replied Chandos; "you ought to have spoken before; sorry, but I'm engaged.;' "Mere form,a' answered she; "rIm only practising till I see somebody really worth having." Mr. Hay- thorne appeared on the landing, and expressed his will- ingness to assume the responsible position for lack' of better; but Peace was not inclined to bandy words with him, and returned to her chamber. Dolores wandered up and down the house all, the morning, in a flutter of feverish excitement, and made frequent confidences to Bertha concerning Sir John, repeating the pleasant speeches he had from time. to time uttered in her praise, and reading over and over the valentine she designed for him. Poor Bertha was in a troublous state of mnind; her daily duties dragged, her books gave no meaning to her preoccupied faculties, and the Spanish girl was becoming intensely disagreeable to her; anid she- was the more willing to obey her mother's commwand to come home, because she should then be at rest from:: her tiresome harping on the same theme. Chandy     - never dropped a chance word that she didn't bring it to be weighed and commented upon. "Supposing you loved very much- somebody, who cared not at all for you, would you wish longer to live t " said she one day, when the easy-going fellow had freed himself from her company rather brusquely, and--   40     BSETHA'S VALEN TINE. failed in the charming nothings it was his custom s fluently to produce. "I really never considered the subject; but as living don't go by wishes, I should live all the same, and do my best besides."  "Well, I wouldn't, then. I'd shut up my eyes and die. I'd kill myself, and breath no more, Ciertanenta!" "Nonsense I Dolores, you don't know what you are talking about-you, who made such a fuss over a little pain. - Didn't you come this morning to show me a pin-scratch on your arm, with big tears dropping down your cheeks, because it looked-so red and jagged in the fair flesh, and hurt you so much. It needs courage sometimes to live, but it needs more to die." "Ah!" replied Dolores, flashing one of her sudden glances about the room, and resting her black eyes on Bertha with-an intense, gloomy expression, "you do not feel like me. You do not know how the blood can fly hot through my heart; how I can suffer when I do not get my wish. You are not a lover; you have no passion; you live so still, and smile every day, and eat your dinner." Indeed, good, quiet, industrious Bertha had no capa- city to understand the violence of Dolores' emotions and fervid nature. Her languishing glances, tender speeches, unreserved avowal of her fondness, seemed improper, unmaidenly; but seeing what she had seen from day to day, and deeply conned, she was pretty well settled to the belief that, in giving this young beauty an opportunity to win the man she loved, she had lost her chance of happiness. He had not been near her   RBEDPSHS VALEI/VNl  .    M for more than a week.  Their morningg rides were interrupted. The weather was to blame for that, but indoors he had absolutely shunned her society; and, whether from accident or design, he remained mostly in the neighborhood of the Spanish girl whenever he came into the drawing-room, hearing her recitations of hymns, amusing himself withrher musically broker English, and giving her whimsically queer explanations of the text.  "Will you be, my Valentine, Chandos You are already my queredo," she had heard her say one day. "That is as the saint decrees," he answered, care- lessly; "I intend thankfully to accept such goods as the gods provide." "But you must choose me from them all, is it notr a Send me/a pretty sweet-smelling letter to say so truly, as the birds do choose their mates." "Oh no, Dolores; the birds never write letters; they only tender housekeeping bills." "But Valentine is not much different from novio, and you were that in Madrid." "Very true 'but former things have passed away, and all things have become new'" replied Chandos, "Now you shall tell me truly, then, who youlove the best of anybody."  "Gdd." "Then who next?            . "Virgin Mary, of course. That jumps with your creed, does it not?       .  "You are laughing at my true religion, and you do , Vu              . r 11    not mean to choose me for your Valeutine, pouted Dolores. You are unkind. I like you not any more." That's- right, child; I wouldn't, if I were you; I'm not worth it. 'Youngling, learn .thoA to make some meaner choie;e who chooseth me, shall ain what ma ^gteWir e.' Shall they not, Peace? Speak the truth, "Snippyness," was the polite reply he got, and it suited him as well as any other. Dolores did not un- derstand the source or bearing of Chady' otations ha   s quotations. But his careless tone was impossible to mistake, and as she rose hastily to go away from him, he lazily at tempted to restore her good humor. "Don't go, Dolores; when you speak, sweet, I'd have yon do it ever; when you sing I'd have you never cease; when you danee I wish you a wave of the sea that you might ever do nothing but that. Come, Ber- tha, play a good waltz. Dolores is dying to dance with me, and you others may as well arise and have a little exercise also." "Thanks, Chandy," said Dolores; I aid not be dying, though; but I will enjoy to valtse." Old Miss Petingill had shown a terribly vinegar as- pect, and snapped savagely at Peace, ever since the neck-tie party, though she accepted the cuffs and col- lars Which she got as a " waive offering," and she had Spit out hard speeches dwelling much on " dark-complec- e gils, who was allers kickin' up musses and trying to get noticed," and cutting off wicked ,coquettes from all part anld lot in blessings. She said she hoped"that itfe,.contrivin, creatur' [meaning Miss Filer] would   BERT.'

I don't 'grudge her her life; and folks say the dea- con is an awful stingy provider. She'll be sorry she was so pesky forred to jump at the chance; some old maids is so peculiar!"  She was extremely unpleasant to Pauline and Dick, finding fault with everything they did, carrying com- plaints to Miss Walsingham, who bore her behavior  better than could have been expected, and felt sorry, for her forlorn condition. Deb would none of her, and turned the cold shoulder every time she appeared on her domain; and though she seized on the young ladies as soon as they approached the sewing-room, asking questions, etc., they were mostly so eager to be rid of her that she had rather a lonely time over her old linen, and felt as if her lot in life was harder than any other woman's in the world. "' Well, I s'pose you are up to some new contrivance for plaguin' somebody," said she, meetinPeace in the hall one day. ' Satan allers finds out mischief for idle  hands to do; you let him tuck enough on't into yourn. I notice you're pretty tollable busy."        : Ohb, thank you, Miss jPetingill," replied Peace pleasantly;' I have nothing especial to occupy me just now; as for mischief, I think I am rather better than usual this morning;  I feel peculiarly benignant and amiable."  She turned her bright laughingl eyes upon the spin-   344      BERTHA'S VALJENTINE. ster's wrinkled face, with one of her wicked, mirthful smiles, and-waited blandly for her to commence again. "Humph! Peculiar! Well, you're going to have another fandango downstairs to-night. I don't expect anybody 'll ask me to come down." "Yes, indeed.. I will take the liberty to invite you. I hope you will come." "Well, I'l see. I don't care no great about it. I'm about sick of such goin's on; you've kept up a perfect Vanity Fair ever since you've been here. I dare say I can creep into some out-of-the-way corner jist fit for old maids, and look on. I shan't pizen nobody, I hope." "Far from it. I assure you we shall be glad to see you, and I shall be surprised if you do not have an enjoyable evening. Who knows but St. Valentine may be kind to you?" "Pshaw! I don't ask no favors of nobody. What's them pesky young ones laffin' at?"The pesky young ones were Dick and Pauline, who scuttled off, chuck- ling and stamping. "I suppose that Miss Filer 'll be comin' up hangin' onto her new beau. Well, I'm thankful I can work, and earn my livin' yet awhile, and dare to say my soupls my own." %I don't think she will come this evening; she is very busy, indeed, preparing for her approaching nup- tials," replied Peace. "I respect your independent views, though I must say I rather wonder you didn't marry, Miss Petingill; you are so suave and genial, and that sort of thing s" r 5         r .

Our excellent Howadji was ready in his royal robes as Lord of Misrule, and had prepared an amusing and instructive treatise upon the day, its origin, the life of the holy saint whoge name it had taken, and a very 15*   curious cfilling from the old poets, beginning with Chaucer, who had made mention of the festival, and also the tricks and ceremonies obtaining in different countries, time-honored, and observed during diverse eras, down to the present posting of colored prints and gushing love-epistles among our young men and maid- ens, to all of which old Miss Petingill said, c The land of the livin'! Peculiar how folks can," and I listened with extremest interest. I cannot so well answer for the expectants, because, although their attention was courteous, I saw many wondering glances alight upon the oaken table overspread with billets and parcels. After the reading was concluded, the children, arrayed as cupids, with silvery wings and shining gauze dresses, flitted about distributing them, and left on each lady's lap a square piece of card-board, which of course they eagerly opened, and everybody ex- claimed- with delight. They were exquisite bunches of flowers in water- colors. Peace got carnations, Bertha forget-me-nots, Sabrina lilies, Dolores Cape jasmines, Susie apple-blos- soms, and beneath each a couplet pointing to some well-known occurrence in the life of the fair recipient, which suffused conscious faces with blushes, besides causing much gay laughter. Again Gracie, the fairy, dropped a missive into Sa- brina's hand. She removed the envelope and found a'. bunch of blue violets, so precisely like the one Sam had kissed,- and she had refused, that she intuitively knew the hand which had so delicately copied them; under them was written-   347 -ERTH'S VATRi',4.    - .   347. "Oh, the green willow rl have for my pillow;  The green, green grass shall form my bed. Alack ! and well-a-day, 0; ::Anld the cold, cold stone shal pillow my head w lhilst worms on me shall prey, ." She turned it over, half vexed with Sam for conjtr- ing such a ghastly ending to their pleasant friendship, and half sorry for his disappointment, and so wholly occupied with her thoughts that she did notobserve Dick with a third favor, till old Miss Petingill called her attention. "The land sakes Sabriny; ain't you lucketo get such a heap on em?"  v  This was only a tiny sheet of paper, with a vere written upon it, but it sent a  scalet flush up into her clear-out face, and kindled the deep carnelian light in her eyes as she read. She had never seen a line of Penhurst's writing in her life, but she was sure it came from him. "Ah my wete sweteing, My lytil pretty sweteing I She's so proper and pure, Ful, stedfast, stabil, an demue;  There is none such, you may be sure, "As my swete sweteing." After sitting a moment with her eyes on the words,- she raised them shyly and caught her lover's glance fixed admiringly upon, her, and independent and self- poised as she was, she acknowledged with a thrill of pleasure the quaint flattery; inly wondering at her own feelings, she who' hat so obstinatel y "pooh-   348     BERTE A ' SA VLFA,1,tW.9 . poohed" those things, and despised in her secret soul the delight she observed they could impart to tender maids. Peace touched her elbow, and whispered- "LookI you've got a reader for your valentine; I there's a chlel amang ye takin' notes.'" Old'Miss Petingill had donned her spectacles and was deliberately perusing the verse; when she found herself observed, she coolly said: "I should think that fellar'd letter go to spellin' school. I vum! I wouldn't have a spark that couldn't put the right letters into sweet." Sabrina felt as if her precious gift had been pro- faned, and hastily thrust it into her pocket. Uncle Alec, with his usual lavishness, had sent val- entines to all his guests containing costly gifts-follow- ing the ancient English custom-and Aunt' Elinor also had forgotten nobody. As for the children, they were perfectly beside themselves with joy, and could with difficulty be kept to their messenger-work, so eager were they to begin to enjoy their presents. Mr. Hauxhurst got a pen-and-ink sketch of a burly blacksmith plying 'his trade, with "Le grosforgeron" in gilt letters beneath it, and a verse out of Longfel- low's poem- His hair is crisp and .black and long, His faee is like the tan ; His brow is wet with honest sweat, He earns whate'er he can." He - was at no loss to know the author, because he   BERT A'S VAL.-1NS.

Poor Dolores was inl a perfect flutter; she had sent but one valentine, and she was  eagerly watching till Charwdos should open it; and she fingered her beads and said a good many aves beforel hesatW fit to apply himself to' the reading of the rhymes she had piked out wit  Ch niie care and gotten by heart with satte  de W  he n at last he nodded his head, and laughed, and said "Bravo! beautiful rayissune ! she hoped her fer- vent prayers might have prevaled.

This she slid quickly into her pocket, pushing ofe Peace Pelican's meddling gers, who tried to get a peepand said'no fair," and refusing plumply the Span-  with s ch *-nfiuite Car   850      BERTHAZ S VA. vRNTI-EX. ish girl, who begged to look. She could not exhibit her treasure, and hid it away till she should be alone. -Presently all attention, except Dolores", who could not remove her thoughts from the little gift which somehow had a fascination for her, as if it contained her fate, was concentrated upon old Miss Petingill, who-ha/d at last been. favored by the patron of young lovers, and gotten a valentine. It wasn't very grand, being written on ruled letter-cap, and in childish, un- formed characters, rather sprawling than otherwise: but it was gall and wormwood to the spinster, neverthe- less; and no wonder, for it was really personal in its tenor. In the first place, there was a picture of a gaunt female dangling from a rope. AlthOugh no especial evidences of genius were apparent in the sketch, the silver-rimmed spectacles across the bridge of the peaked nose, and the round snuff-box between the right thumb and' finger, were clearly lined, as were the scissors attached to the apron-string, and the doggerel beneath was indeed extremely aggravating and provoking: "With thy dog'S nose, and pig's eyes, The devil hath got a notable prize. ThoUirt a jade that's ever bawling and banging, And rIll warrant thou'll be none the worse for a good hanging." And as if this was not enough, there was also de- lineated a monstrous cat with woman's face, and this  emphatic com nendation affixed-- Thou shabby ' Gabby, Flabby, dabby Old Tabby.,   BPIBSTB'S Y IAYTU .  .'  -     I35  Dicl's uproahadnou deig-ht, and Pauline's hilarioul participation enraged the insulted tailoress -o th t degree that she certainly hwoult have outraged proo- egrietey boxingthe ar  of the little rogues, if thnle ma nner of the man who was brought to boo for agized, in thesthate       gwords: Ibeg ythe pardon ofr the ourt for uasi ng an applo-  priate term to de cribe iBrother Jo nes g Fortunately, Aunt Elinor was ready prepared with a   nice black alpaca for the spinster, Who was alwas  pento Contributions.

"Of course the wicked conspirators must hare been helped to their revenge; but though their rhyme came frolm an old, old book, of which both Peace and Chandy were fond, I am not, able to say who aided and abetted them."' Peace Pelican had gotten something to think of; and as the missives went on distributing, she sat absorbed, and, for a wonder, quite silent. Although not abso- lutely sure of the source of her note, her thoughts and all probabilities pointed toward one Francis Haythorne, of the white- hand and Goetherian maxims. She liked him, and she didn't like him; she was pleased and displeased that he had dared to single her out for his old verses - . My lips rll softly lay UTpon Peace's heavenly cheek; Dyed like the dawning day, As polished ivory sleek. And in her ear I'll say- ' Oh, thou bright moening star ; 'Tis I that come so far, My valentine to seek.'"

Bertha was too busy with her emotions -to observe the free speaking -of the, old man, but she would not have wondered if she had, because she knew that his kindly heart nearly worshipped Fred's children, having bestowed on them the love which might have belonged  -:  to his own bairns, "sleeping beneath the daisies."- - She gave her flushed face one look in the mirror, surprised with the illumined comeliness she saw (Ber- tha had always been in the habit of considering herself extremely plain), patted her- smooth. hair, took one more last little glance at her pictures before she laid them carefully in her drawer, and descended.      i Sir John met her at the door, and drew her towards him. Oh, what a noble, handsome-fellow he was!  What a sweet- lover!! "Are they mine, Bertha?" asked he, smiling, and questioning her downcast face. "May I own them? - Just a taste,' he added, as she turned away.

I have been terribly annoyed sometimes with her guileless exhibitions of her feel- lngs. I hope you didn't think I was to blame, dearest.

"Bertha, I'll keep all my pretty sayings for you hereafter; may I?" "If you can; but I don't expect you will, because you will always be Chandy."  "Come, now, Flower de Luce, I'll tell you why I want to marry you. I never forgot the scolding you inflicted upon me, nor your- earnest, honest face when you piled it up. It did me good.' I need a vast deal of scolding to keep me in order, and so I have made up my mind to have you close to me the rest of my life; it will save me such a lot of trouble and respon- sibility. I intend to make you the family conscience." While Bertha laughed, a swift rustle passed the door of the little parlor, and the poor Spanish maid took her despair with her for dread companion out into the silent night; " for love is strong as death, jealousy as cruel as the grave; the coals thereof are coals of 'fire, a most vehementl flame." They heard the great hall door clang after her, and as voices approached their retreat, Chandos rose hastily. "Come, Bertha, mine! let's go forth under the oaks; see how clear and calm the moonlight lies upon the ground! Quick! dearest; hasten out of the way of in- traders ; even friends are intruders to-night. I must   have you to myself. I want to feel sure that Ihave really got ycu for mine. I want to talk as sweet as I please . Here's auntie's scarlet cloak. Oh! how well it becomes you! I neversaw you wear a red garment --no, not so much as a bit of red ribbon. Dol't you know. that a picture isn't perfect without a little touch of this warm color. Now you shall complete the land- scape with your gorgeous mantle.' - He put it upon her shoulders and pulled up the hood, holding it an instant in his two hands, and fixed his coaxing eyes upon hers--and-well, never mind; they certainly bloomed for him; that doubt was settled It was pleasantly cold. The ground crisped with frost, and a few snow-flakes had fallen, which lay lightly here and there; and they prolonged their ram- ble past Echo Lake, and the rustic summer-house where Chris had taken Otho's Provence buds; and on to the little church whose spire pointed toward heaven. Chandos unlatched the door. "Let's go in here, Bertha, and promise ourselves to each other, and try how we will look when Mr. Grow- ing (we must have the excellent FErederic, mustn't we to tie the knot I thinkso.

"I perceive Thomas has been here setting up my   BEBTH SAI VA Mt2iE       59 I E Etruscan vases; that's -why he left -his lamp so dimly  i burning-still unfinished, I suppose, like the tie that binds us.

I didn't mean to be irreverent; but when I'm happiest I think I am merriest. 'Tis true, dar- ling, ' thy love is better than wine.'  Bertha said truly, "Chandos was always Chandos ;" but it seemed to her that as she lifted her eyes to the face of the gentle Christ above the altar a smile lighted his benign features, while she promised herself to the man at her side in an unspoken, holy vow, which scarce needed a priest's sanction to complete its sacredness. As they arose from their knees a swift, black shadow , glided past, and a light footfall tapped upon the stone- - floor of the vestibule. "Oh, what was that '." said Bertha.

I don't in the least care for any wedding trip; do you, Bertha " Of course she said "No." What consequence could it possibly be to her where she-passed a honeymoon which would be spent with Chandy. "I am glad you don't care about it, Bertha," said he lazily. "I have had such a surfeit of travelling. And now that I think of it, this kind of thing won't do; we've got to go somewhere. I rather forgot, I'm afraid, that while I was a wanderer, my good Bertha was at home. You- mustn't do so. You must take me everywhere you like. I'm not going to be a selfish puppy of a husband. I charge you not to allow it." Bertha's cup of happiness was full; so handsome and so good I Was ever woman so blessed? The serene Splendor of the night tempted them to prolong their loitering walk, and they scarcely noticed whither their footsteps were tending, when Basswood  pondlay before them, shut in- by its bordering pines. "This is strange," said Chandos, passing his hand over his forehead; but do you know, Bertha, here is the exact spot I saw in my dream, and Dolores was struggling just there under the black water." "I also had an unpleasant dream' that night," whis, pered Bertha;-. "and I feeI almost glad the pond is frozen over, or I might fancy I could discern the sight I saw; her white arms reaching up to me, and her be- seeching eyes." "You dreamed that, darling?  Singular, indeed! You are trembling; come, let's go down. Ugh! what a  ghostly shiver among the pine-trees! It beats the   BERTHA'S VATWNTnRE.      861 sound of the going in the tops of the mulberries all to pieces."  He took a step backward, but she detained him.   - She was gazing at the surface of the pond. "Look, Chandy, I wonder what broke the thin ice there? See how it is splintered, and how the water is splashed over the light snow. Doesn't it look really as it something might have-let's go home quickly,     i Chandy. I feel ill. What if--if-our dream were to come true." She finished her whisper with white lips and fright- ened eyes, whichll Sir John saw in pure astonishment. "Nonsense, sweet! Some squirrel has taken a dive, or adventurous woodchuck. This place belongs to the animal creation mostly, you know, in winter, and they disport themselves on the ground or under the water at their free-will. As for the uncanny vision, you re- member what Bill Shalres savys: ' We are such stuff as 'dreams are made of.' The truth is, pretty Dolores was something troubling us two, and so we took her to our pillows, and kept her there after our little lives ^ were rounded with a sleep."      X Chandy's voice sounded musically firm, and his flesh   I and blood presence was so pleasant and satisfying that - Bertha smiled; but she added, almost unconsciously--    I "This is my dream.

"-Still disturbed, darling-still harping on, m y daugh- ter  We will leave the dreary swish of these corm-    I plaining branches, and get down among our confreres,  X  '*   I362  -  BERTHA'S 'ALERSI2'W. You must give me a song before I go to bed. I'm going to pay attention to your accomplishments here- after. You shall sing 'Sweet were my dreams of thee.'  Though Sir John jested lightly, he felt relieved, as well as Bertha, when they had left the frozen pond, with its shivered ice, behind them. Neither spoke much, and the lady, walking with bent head, espied a shining thing on the grounds which she stooped to raise-the crimson fan, which was the inseparable companion of the Spanish girl, and the chain of beaten gold with which it was wont to be fastened to her waist was rudely sundered. "Stop, Chandos," said Bertha, in a faint voice. "Oh I cannot bear to' look at it."  She thrust it into his hands, eager to be rid of the costly trifle. "A fan, sweet! Have you taken Dolores' fash- ion?" said he, receiving it smilingly. "You must make her give you some lessons; for, of a truth, there wasn't a maiden on the Prado who could excel her in its graceful use. I remember it waving about like a cinnabar butterfly the night of our neck-tie party; but I charge you by the roes and the hinds that you get not also the fashion of her eyes. I must keep my Bertha just as she is-my dear, good little scold-my family conscience." "But, Chandy, you don't understand; I picked the fan off the ground here on the mountain; and look I are there not other footprints on the snow than ours?" "Very likely, Flower de Luce, as there are other   DIERBTZAS VATI   E.     36Y.8 lovers at Craigenfels beside ourselves-Pen and Sa- brina, for instance, who will slortly, I think, become a pair. Even as we, they wander round the grounds,k arm in arm, like to as pair of loving turtle-doves that could not live asunder day- nor night." "But, Chandy, listen! Htow do you suppose this fan got up here? And it has not been long lost, either, be- cause she wore it this very evening. I saw, it, and I noticed the chain of curious links upon it. Chandy, I am afraid!"          - "Of what, Bertha? That Dolores shall ruin herself dropping her costly trifles about, regardless of expense? She has a fan for every day in the year. A little feathery nothing like this one is easily lost. She is just the girl for a moonlight stroll. Jasper Bisbee is often in her company--I would he might come into her grace. Very likely they preceded us; we mustn't expect to keep a- monopoly of the mountain. I wish with all my soul that she'd fall in love with Bisbee and get married out of hand." Bertha made no reply. Chandy twisted away from the' subject which she knew was bringing her late words freshy before him, and seemed so vexed. And they walked swiftly past the church, past Echo Lake, and under the oaks, where the many lights of the hos- pitable mansion were shining upon them. This time it was Sir John wh&ose eyes sought the ground in thought, and he stooped and lifted some- thing in his path. te glanced at it in quick surprise, and looked at Bertha. She had not observed him, being still busy with the dreary vision at Basswood   ",     BESTas 'S B  v=ESTrIlR S. Pond, and he quietly thrust his finding into his pocket. As soon as they stood within the hall, he said, "Will you fetch your valentine, darling? Let's take a look at our two faces." And he watched her, noting if she would seek to bring it from hiding in her pocket or her bosom. Noi she turned and ran swiftly up the stairs, and he awaited her coming in uneasy suspense. Pretty soon she descended, pale as death. It is gone!" said she. "The drawer where I left it the last thing before I went to you in the little par- lor is open, and it is gone!" "Are you quite sure " asked Chandos, soberly. ' Quite sure, Chandy. I cannot be mistaken." Might you not have slipped it into your pocket in your hurry '." "No, indeed!  I tell you I laid it away carefully."' I have it here, safe, however," said Chandos, bing- ing it forth and showing it to her. I found it under the great oak; but-now-"', "Then God help poor Dolores I "  gasped Bertha; for I   know she is lying at the bottom of Basswood   CHAPTER XXV"L PEtNHUKSTiS DISPATCH.           i RHE day following the "rashy importunate" act of the half-bewildered, half-mad, wholly-jeal-  ous Spanish girl seeking her death was the     , saddest- of alldays old Craigenfels ever saw. The pale body lay on the white bed beautiful Dol-  ores had pressed in her girlish loveliness; and the    i sweetly smiling lips were serene and joyous-every taint of earthly passion washed away by her dread  plunge.! Her glossy hair caressed lightly her. pretty head in   1 great, rich, coiling rings, and th e divin oval of her Castilian face appeared harmoniously perfect; her  heart-shaped mouth, still red as a pink, was scarcely shut; and her wonderful teeth-wlhite, fine, and sharp,  showed in the cleft; the purple blood yet dyed with  violet tracery her clear olive cheek; and her bewil-   : dering eyes were raised-seeing the invisible, and not yet shorn of their dazzling radiance. It was hard to believe that she had fallen asleep beneath the black water-to waken-where? Let us hope in Paradise.  God is merciful.

The shock, so sudden and so terrible, had sorely wounded them; and words felt like mock- -: '  ery. A dispatch had gone to the dark-browed brother, that t;    he might come and claim his only relative, and know ,    all his loneliness. Poor Chandy was quite prostrated by the blow. It \    was his hand which had lifted her dripping form from the water. I, wonder if she knewit? And he laid her head upon its pillow, and folded her hands above her breast, "praying dmnbly;" and he and Bertha sat beside her, watching her last sleep. He bitterly accused himself,going over his acquaint- ance with the dead girl from their first meeting at Rosenbloom; laying bare every secret thought, and /I    recalling each event, that she might weigh them in her just balance; accusing his too ready willingness to amuse his leisure, and his smooth tongue, so naturally ' giving utterance to kind, agreeable, complimentary nothings. And Bertha comforted him. When she loosened the costly rosary from the death- clasp of the poor child's little cold fingers and handed l19   it to him, neither spoke a word; but both recalled her a - 7', living presence in her thousand graceful actions, her   PEW1 : fURST'S DISPATCH.     6 impulsive, supple motions, her beseeching, melodious voice, and her loving tenderness. Chandos bent his head and pressed the shining cross to his lips, and, strong man though he was, not easily moved to tears; ,: he felt no shame that they dropped hotly upon the precious relic; and he begged Bertha to keep it, giving it place among her treasures. Toward evening Mr. Penhurst came to the drawing- room, and sent for Sabrina to come down to him.     m She appeared, with red eyes and crimson cheeks, her auburn locks all tossed and curling about her neck, and her lips drooping. The horrible end of her school friend had quite unnerved her, and made her heart sore with weeping. Her pride was all gone, her stateli- ness forgotten, and she stepped listlessly forward ,and took in passive quiet the place Pen offered her at his side. He had a dispatch in his hand, and over his-rejoicing love was a cloud of dread, superadded to his sympa- thy and sorrow. He was surprised, too, at the absolute engagingness of his betrothed in this new phase of her attractions, so soft, so delicate-simple in her absorbing grief; and in all his hurry and agitation he found time to wonder if she were not sweeter with drooping head, like a broken lily, than when she stood proudly, self-poised and majestically complete. The faded violets still clung to her hair, which she had worn the night be- fore, and their faint odor greeted him. She had not undressed, and her purple robe was discolored in * -  f   places from their contact with poor Dolores' dripping  garments, and her rich laces were creased and stained.

Watching closely for the effect of his communication, he sawj the deep carnelian glow kindle in her eyes, and a dash of rpsy-red flash into her cheek.

MissPetingill sniffed and snorted over her invita- tion but she accepted it, and stood around in corers making biting comments upon all the proceedings, run- times tow n th e eatables, and prophesying the hard  times the dirk little bride W'as sure to encounter amongst so many tearing young ones, and added--- "SOIme old maids is so drefful fierce to get married they'll tale np with anybody. I vum!"Mrs. Prodds  slipped deftly into her new sphere, and enjoyed the bustle and responsibility of ttook pride in turning oit the biggest clieeses from her press, theye est bundterfrom her dair and raised soe many fancy fowls and lambs and mottled pigs, that her friend Dulcet got quite jealous; and she announced her intention to devote such leisure as she could gain from the six to theusbtudyof chondr opterygian pices, and chondrology, and the cultivation of bombyx, and the careful protee  I tion ofthe bonaperityra of her household. And little  Mrs. Proddy laughed healily, and said she hi'hly ap- proved the- resolution. The new wife had oceans of tinmeto help anybody who needed help; she',took the best care of the communion service (it had never shone so, brightly before), and personally superintended the preparation of: the sacramental bread; also presenfited  from her own press the pure juice of the grape to the sacred table. She was a perfect oracle in her numerous house- lold, upon every matter,; small and great; and won and- kept, and richly deserved, the love and respect of herhusband's children and grandchildren.

Whenever any festivity was afoot, her flock were considered, their wants supplied, their toilettes attended to, their tastes and feelings consulted, and ready, merry,l pleasant, whole-hearted assistance willingly, graciously r given (take notice, all step-mothers), and not one -of  thei was ever afraid of a refusal to a reasonable re- quest, or failed in getting a kind, patient hearing, and. sound advice in a difficulty.              i Chris, of course, was a frequent visitor at the farm, and watched her dear Filey with amused interest. Ah, Filey! you don't give these young folks as many  failures as you used us poor girls up at Rosenbloom."  i "Yes, yes, child; I suppose I was a little wasp those days; but I was so badgered. Now I am head, and      can afford to be kind. Believe me, my dear, theredis nothing so good for a woman as prosperity-a sensible . woman, I mean-especially after she has learned the uses of adversity.

So the ;little church on the mountain was once more decked for a bridal; and Mr. mun wasoncemor   3876       BREA KrN G URP. Growing awaited the coming pairs beneath the shadow of the gentle Christ, with a sweet, serious face, quiet and benign. Chris, sitting among the wedding guests, saw their approach through the broad aisle; and her flickering color went and came, and she instinctively turned her brown eyes upon the proud, masterful man at her side, who welcomed the arrowy beam with one of his pleasant, grave smiles. His thoughts were also busy. He reached over and took her hand into his firm clasp. It seemed so like a holy renewal of their marriage  Vows. And there was not one' present who had seen this wife, a bride, in her quaint suit of Lincoln green, bedecked with pansies, who failed to recall the won- drous charm of her timid, maidenly loveliness, her sweet modesty, her gracefully drooping hand, standing beside the lordly master she accepted that dear old festaplday.

Susie and John promised to occupy Craig- enfels during their absence, and take care of the doves Just before they started from the station Captain Slocum drove up his cow-ponies in eager haste, and singling out Chandy, he poured into his ear a confi- dential whisper that might lhave been heard across Roaring River. "We're seven agin, sir, as sure as you're born-seven rams, seven lambs, seven he-goats. And Dulcet, she is smarter than a Jerusalem cricket; she lifts up her voice and rejoices.

SAB RINA S WIDOWER.  J-s  T was a warm, sunny spring day, that Mr. and Mrs. Penhurst stood together upon the broad l^II piazza of the old homestead where Pen was born, looking: out upon the soft sunset, the wide bay spread out before them, dotted with white sails flap- ping idly in the gentle breeze. , March was going out -like a lamb, and the wheat-fields were already sprinkled with green. Sabrina had been but a couple of hours in her new home; and it was only a flying visit before their long trip, for they were to sail in -five days. She had al- -  ready made a tour of the rooms, with her delighted X husband, and praised and been surprised in precisely the right places, so that the exhibition might be con- sidered a marled success; and Mr. Pen certainly looked extremely satisfied. She was silent now, how- ! ever, and thoughtful; and the excellent young man, who had the remarkable  quality of mind which prompted him to allow his wife to think when she seemed inclined, without rudely breaking in upon or jostling her reflections, stood by, enjoying her neigh- : .  ,'. r    -....,.L,.evs,. YvvZ UV wol k'.b borhood and her beauty, her recherchi toilette, her ab- solute perfection. Presently she stepped toward him, and laid a hand upon his shoulder-her golden head just reached above it-and, as she varied from her usual habit which was to look full in his face when she addressed hiD, he noticed the blue-veined tracery in her eyelids, and the heavy fringe of curling lashes; he noticed also the quick beating of the pulse in her marble-hued nlecIr, and the trembling touch of her small fingers, and wondered what it might mean. "Tell- me truly, Penhurst," she began, " do you love me as much as you did your other-"  "Other what, precious darling?" questioned Pen, seeing that she had made a dead stop, and there was no immediate prospect of her commencing again. His face was puzzled, too-full of conjecture. "What is it you wish to ask me, Sabrina?" "Forgive me, dearest; I have longed a  thousand times to speak openly; but you were so reticent, and it was so painful to me, I could not bring myself to mention your-your-other-your first-of course she was yeour Tfirst I mkno that. I feel how foolish I have been; but I   always said, before I knew you, that I must - be first love to the man I married. Very silly, wasn't it? I  don't feel so, now; not in the least. I have looked the position in the face; and I had rather be your second love tthan first to an  other man breathing. I had, indeed." "Just stop there, my own Sabrina! let me get on the same plane with you. I  am in the dark so far.   SBRIrNA'S IDOWER       381:  What does all this 'first love-second love' mean?    1 Whence come these blushes, these tears. Here we     ! stand. I am Phil Penhurst, the happy husband of the only woman I ever saw in my life whom I desired to call my own-my first and only loyve-my precious       wife!"     '  {         y  "What!" exclaimed she, lifting her eyes to his with a curious mixture of emotions. 'I ought to blame you, I know (though I can't help liking to hear you n say it), because such a confession shows that you were not truly honorable. 'People spoke of you as a devoted 4  lover in those bygone days; and I believe I had rather you should prove yourself true everywhere. I can't bear to find a flaw in my husband, even- though it is flattering to me. You must have loved poor Annie, and I had rather you said so." " Annie . Of course, I loved her in a manner. We were excellent friends. I jested with and amused the   j child, as* did everybody else who came in her way.  She was one of those pretty, kittenish creatures, whom it was impossible not to fondle; but I never gave any person cause to iemark upon my conduct with regard to the innocent little girl, I am sure." "'Mr. Penhurst, you surprise me you shock me! You have frequently offended m6 by speaking in this   i light, unbecoming manner of your first attachment. I really must insist that you do me the compliment to believe it must be exceeding disagreeable to my feelings as a woman, and revolting to my good taste-- " "Sabrina, love! pardon me,I interruptedPen, soberly; ayou are using strong language. You must explain a e         ,    .            .. ..   what you mean by it. I am arraigned, it appears, for someheinous offene. I'll thank- your gracious mecy to read the indictment."         mecy H"Iave you not just now told me that you married a girl without loving her? Have you not proved your- self untrue to the memory of your first wife?" "First wife?" exclaimed Penhurst; "are not you, Sabrina Bradshaw Penhurst, my first and dearest i "How can that be, sir, since you know quite well that you are a widower "  Pen withdrew gently from her neighborhood, and stood gazing at her perturbed face, which was beginning to look both stormy and pitiful. "A what?". he asked, under his breath. , "A widower, sir." "Who told you so?" "Chandos Goldsmith. He related to' me the whole story of your short married life, and I must say I should think much better of you--" "Chandy!" interrupted Pen, a light breaking in upon lim. "Oh, that merciless fellow! So he told you I was a widower, did he?" "Yes, he did, and why not? It was no secret, I suppose; Peace Pelican often spoke of it, and the jour- ney up to Kauterskil, when you proposed to Annie." "But I never was on 'auterslil mountain in Miss Pelican's company. I never proposed to Annie." Sabrina studied his laughing face a moment,'and bursting into tears she turned hastily to leave him. MO   BsrABI, s WIDOWER       383      1 he felt that her life was wrecked and her husband a Lonster. He did not permit her to: sweep past him, however, scause he caught her in his arms and covered her     i ice with kisses., Astonished and offended, she twisted out of his em- race, and the peculiar glance kindled glowingly in her : '! ashing eyes.  Pen, unable to control himself, broke out into a earty and most provoking fit of laughter, which added, jel to the flame of her indignation, and she struggled free the hand he still retained. "Don't go, love," said he, trying to draw her toward irn. "Come, darling, tell me what else Chandy - Sabrina would not speak at first, but drawing a onclusion from his sincere, loving face, and open-eyed onesty, that she must be under some absurd mistake, nd still wide of the real state of her affairs, sihe did nally manage to stammer, feeling exceeding foolish   - ver her confusion:  "They were all talking of you, and I said I didn't Lke widowers; and Uncle Alec would be disagreeable, \    nd bet hats that I'd marry one, and I've gone and one just as he said I would; and I must say, Mr. 'enhurst, I don't at -all understand your conduct. I  Hink it would be much nicer to speak- plainly and   , ruthfully; there is no use trying to dodge facts."  Pen was very near going off again, but he put a ,ard on his risibles, while -he replied quietly,: "My own darling, believe me, I am no' artful dodger.? ,. '!!   384      ASBRSA   WIDmOWZR You -are my first and only love-my first' and only wife. I see they have been amusing themselves up at Craigenfels, at our expense. That '-rascally Chandos! I can now understand many things which perplexed me, though I must do him the justice to say that I don't think he made any false statements, and he must have been' helped out by the others-that Peace Pelican especially. I hope you will love me none the less because I am Phil Penhurst, baclelor, with a free and faithful heart to offer you, and not Phil Penhurst the poor lonely fellow whom I helped to bury his Annie on the banks of the Arno. "If you had observed closely, and not had your in- ferences pre-made to order for you, you must have noticed that they spoke of Cousin Phil often; and you know they always call me Pen-a habit our relations took up in our childhood, to distinguish us. "I trust th6y have not made youwunhappy. Widower Phil is a- fine fellow, but he cannot have my glorious Sabrina."' After a thoughtful silence, during which the young wife reviewed the Christmas days, and comprehended all the sly insinuations and artful statements she had heard, all Peace's jokes, Chandy's comments and quo- tations, which let her deceive herself without once deviating from the strictly true, she said: "Well, indeed and of a surety, I must be terribly stupid. I certainly have been led by the nose beyond anything I could have imagined." "It does seem odd that the facts were not divulged in some unexpected moment, I confess."   SABRINA'S WIDOWER.       -385 ls They couldn't so have deceived you, you wish to say, I presume; pray don't be delicate and keep back your thought," said Sabrina, a trifle vexed. "Since you force me to the avowal, darling, I really and trulythink they could not; but, you see, I have been a close student of the girl I coveted, and I flatter myself I know all about her; I have the tastes, idiosyn- crasies, and accomplishments of the Silver Lake God- dess by heart." "Thanks ; that is quite delightful; so they are such as to please my lord," replied Sabrina, with a little of the pride she still owned. "(I must say I am glad that my early dream has come true; I am first love, after all. I thought I adored you as much as was good for you, but I really believe (don't be vain: I can't help it) you are dearer to me this instant than at any previous point of time since you entered the Craigenfels ball- room. Ah! I am so happy, Penhurst ;" she turned and put her two hands on his shoulders and gazed into his eyes; "( my soul sings for gladness." With swift' undulating motion she slid away and took a couple of steps toward the door. "Come," said she, I haven't tried papa's new Stein- way yet; suppose you open it, and I will give you a song. You never asked me to sing but once up there, and I was vexed, and refused. I will never refuse you again. You shall have songs, new and old, of my best, I know you will appreciate them. I anticipate a thoroughly discriminating listener." Pen winced, and made a wry face behind his hand.   386      SABRAIA',S DWIDOWtS. He loved his wife, but he held his own opinions upon her vocal-organs, "Oh, thank you, darling; but suppose we talk a little more first; this piazza is so very pleasant; you are so close to me-and I am going to smoke if you will allow me-and really-we are so happy-I hate to disturb the current of--" "But you never heard me sing; and you don't care to, either, it seems." Sabrina flashed up in her superb way, and threw back her head crowned with a golden diadem of shin- ing hair, and dropped the hand she had held out waiting for his pleasure'to take it in his. "COf course, sweet-I shall be-ahem!.-delighted, but I have heard you-' Robert, toi, gqi j'aie ' one evening; you know Chandy got you to render the piece on purpose for my pleasure." Sabrina looked at him an instant, trying to recall the circumstance he mentioned, feeling quite sure she had never trilled a note in his hearing; and then, al- though she turned away with the air of an -offended duchess, her lips parted in an engaging smile and her eyes danced. "I feel inclined to sing," said she; " if you do not feel inclined to listen, pray convey your majesty out of ear-shot. You can walk down   to the stables, or take a look at your beloved pigs, or visit the tombstone on the hill-top, where lies your faithful Tuft, or amuse yourself in any other gentlemanly manner. I am suf- ficient to myself, even though I am married." Pen replied hurriedly:   SABRINA'S WIDOWER          3,8T "]My own darling! My precious Sabrina! Forgive my-ahem!-laziness. Allow    me to escort you; of course I shall take infinite pleasure." Sabrina sat down with a red flush on her cheek, and an illumined face, and commenced that divine duet of Mendelssohn-- "Oh wert thou in the cauld blast On yonder lea, My plaidie to the angry airt, rd shelter thee; Or did misfortune's bitter storms Around thee blaw, Thy shield should be my bosom, To share it a'. \ * "Or were I in the wildest waste, Sae black and bare, The desert were a -paradise, If thou wert there; Or were I monarch of the globe, With thee to reign, The brightest jewel in my crown- Wad be my Queen." Her voice was true and, delicate, and she put her soul into the plaintive melody. Her anger melted, her ruffled feelings calmed themselves,and her eyes glis- tened with soft radiance and wifely tenderness under the pleasure she felt, and was conscious of being able to impart.- And her heart beat high   and warm, be- cause she knew it would be a glad surprise to the man at her side, with whom music was a passion. As for?n, the effect of the song upon him   was curious. At first, he leaned back, his hands folded, -   -388     SABRINA.'S WID O WER. like one who nerved himself to endure bravely a wear- isome penance. As the sweet notes rose on his ear, full, rich, satisfactory, he started, and, pushing back his hair, he lifted his head to listen, like a stag who hears the distant horns, and knows the hunt is up. And when the last word was finished, and the fair cantatrice dropped her hands into her lap, and raised her eyes to his, he clasped her in his arms and kissed her-glowing face in rapture. "You did not sing like that, ' Robert, toi qui faime,' " said he half reproachfully. "Pray, believe me, Mr. Penhurst, I never sang a note at Craigenfels when you were about the place. That charming performance was planned by Chandos, and executed by Peace Pelican, though I had no idea till to-day that you credited me with its excellence. Chandy said it was to tease and torment your ears with vile sounds which your soul abhorred, and he was nicely vexed with-me when I railed against his inhumanity. I came near singing in the mass, and only retired be- cause Peace told me you had said you must have a seraph for a wife, and added with one of her wicked, provoking looks, that you had declined taking a tenor, that you might listen to me ' en candidate.' Of course, I did not choose to subject my powers to your criticism after that!" "Master Chandy has enjoyed himself hugely, it ap- pears, as well as Miss Pelican and the others." "Oh yes, dear. That is patent; but permit me to remark, I was easily gulled; but you, who was so close a student of the girl you coveted, who knew all   SABRIN'S WID O WER.      389 about her accomplishments, tastes, capabilities, etc, I rather wonder your penetrative sharpness was not too much fqr their force. I should think they could not have deceived you!" "I cry you mercy, love! Please don't sharpen your too keen wits upo n your defenceless husband. I feel as if I could afford freely to. forgive them, for I cer- tainly have the best of the joke. Come, let's repeat the second verse! 'With thee to reign.' Glorious! Isn't it " And their two voices blended in delicious harmony, as their two lives ran on from that day of agreeable surprises, untroubled by a single discord.
