                 WINE OR WATER:  A TALE OF NEW    ENGLAND. BY MRS. CAROLINE A. SOULE, AUTHOR OF 'CHOME LIFE'9"PET OF THE SETTLEENT,S' ET0.; *  BOSTON: PUBLISHED BY ABEL TOMPKINS, No. 25 cOO RrNH I L, BROWN & TAGGARD, 29 CORNHLL, 1862.    Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1861, by ABEL TOMPKINS, In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of Blassachusetts  Printed by  BAZIN AND CHANDLER, . 37 Cornhill.  J    PREFACE.                 X IT is related of one of the heathen philosophers, that when. ever he met a young man in the street, going to a feast, he took him up in his arms and carried him back th his friends, as one saved from imminent peril. Often as we have stood by our window at twilight, and watched the young men of our neighborhood travellingthat road, which has a wine-6up on its sign-posts, we have thought of, that old story, and longed to take up the passer-by and carry him back to that home whose altar he was desecrating; to that mother, sweetheart, wife and little ones, whose eyes were so red, and whose hearts so sad--we have yearned to save him from that pauler's grave, towards which his stagger- ing steps were carrying him so fast. But a woman's arms are not brawny as was the old philos- opher's. Yet even she mapfdo a little something towards stemming the torrent that :is bearing so -many over the preci- pice. Therefore have I written this story, or rather history, for in all essential particulars it Iis strictly true. O      iv          PREFACE. Out of my heart have I written; for though the home of ' my' girl-hood was never profaned by a drunken father, nor the home of my wife-hood by a drunken husband, those near and dear to me as my own kin, have suffered from such causes till their lips have forgotten to smile. If any one 'says I have made the shadows too dark, let him read the chronicles of any police court for a single month. If any one says I have made 'the "sunbeams too bright, let him remember the words of the Psalmist: "The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree, he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. His wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of his house: his children like'olive-plants round about his table. Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord." CAROLINE A. SOULn.

STOP a minute, boys; don't be in such a deuced hur-  hurry ; the boat don't start for half an hour yet. Come in and take a drink; I've got some capital mine,'and,"- There a scarcely perceptible sneer quivered in his nostrils, some -mountain ale, too, clear as yta. and .cold  't December Come on, all of you," and with a bound the dashing young officer cleared the broad marble floor of the hotel porch and ran lightly up the stair- case. Throwing open a door, he ushered his three companions into a spacious but darkened parlor,   8        WINE OR WATER. Sweeping back the rose-colored drapery that fell from the heavy gilt cornice, he caught it up care- lessly and flung it into the0pearl white arm that was bent so gracefully as if to gather it up, and then tossing over it a mass of fleecy lace, he threw open the blinds and let in the brilliant sunshine. It was a splendid room, with a lofty, frescoed ceiling, from the centre of which hung a golden chandelier, with a thousand pendant brilliants. A tapestry carpet hushed the heaviest footfall with its rich tufts of white- and crimson buds and blossoms, into whose shaded hearts seemed folded all the dew and fragrance of the summer time. Statuettes of wondrous beauty were grouped with artistic effect beneath the silvery mirrors and peered timidly out of the dim niches.  The low, graceful ottomans and carved arm-chairs were of rosewood, with cushions of satin; a guitar and flute lay carelessly upon one sofa, while a smoking cap with gold tassels, and a silk dressing robe, a gorgeous, oriental thing, lay upon another. The piano was strown with engrav ings and music, a jewelled opera glass, with a torn glove and bunch of withered roses resting upon the keys.; rare books in costly bindings were scattered profusely over the tables; alabaster vases filled   I with exotics lined the mantel, scenting every breath of air with southern odors sea shells, coral-lipped and snow-cheeked and brimful of murmuring music, lay piled upon the hearth rug, while rare paintings, ;4i - '                     '.    SEALING THEMSELVES.       9 "the hearts" of beautiful views the wide world over, hung upon the walls, their massive oval frames encircling them as with saintly halos. Wheeling a little table into the centre of the room, the host placed a silver salver upon the mar- ble to, and then opening an inner -door, brought from a side-board, half a dozen wine-glasses, a gob- let or two, a couple of decanters and a heavy pitcher, all of rich cut-glass, "Wine or water, boys," said he gaily, twirling the stopples with one hand and rubbing the fingers of the other lightly over the dewy sides of the pitcher. "Come up and, hqlp yourselves. Which shall it be Weldon," addressing the most fashiona- bly attired of the three who had been leaning over the music stool, playing the air to a popular negro melody and whistling an accompaniment. "Wine of course, Seymour, wine alwlys," and sauntering to the table, he held up both decanters and watched the play of the sunbeams as they quiv- ered over the ruby and .amber liquids. "Good for you, Wel'. Which'll you have,-   ' Madeira-yes--fill your glass then. Come on, Aleck," to another, who had been turning the leaves of an illustrated Shakespeare. "Wine or water, old boy." "Wine of course, Seymour, wine always on holi- days," and he poured out a brimming glass, "Here, yoi(;, Fred," to the third, the plainest A    pln *e s   to       WINtE OR WATER. dressed, yet noblest looking of the three, who had been kneeling upon the hearth rug and holding first one and then another of the rare shells to his ear. "Leave your mermaid music and come on. Wine or water," and his lip curled a very little. "Water, Seymour, water alwaysfor me," and he filled a goblet with the melted ice. "Spoken like a parson, Fred. But let me color it for you to-day. It's a deuced hot one, and the doctors say ice-water is a dangerous drink when one has been over-heated and excited; and I am sure you must be both, with standing so long on that breathless platform, with that crowd gaping into your very eyes and swallowing up every word As fast as you spoke it. Here," and he brought a small demijohn from the sideboard closet, " let me pour a few drops of brandy in it. It's Cognac, pure and old ;, it'll swim on your glass like oil on a spring; come-just for your stomach's sake. I don't want to have to " wake " you to-night; I've other matters on hand; and I know you'll be a corpse if you put down all that clear water. Hold up--just a spoonful/" "Not a drop, Seymour," said the young man, firmly. "Not a drop. I am not half so afraid of dying as 1 am of being picked up out of a gutter. Put back your brandy," and he waved his hand toward the little inner room. "Be your death- at your own door, Fred," said   SEALING THEMSELVES.       " i  the host with a half petulant, half good-natured smile, filling himself a glass from one of the decan- ters, - "Let me give you a toast, boys. The Orator of the Pay." The cold water man bowed handsomely in return- for the compliment, and the others drained their glasses. "Again," and Seymour filled them  with the "rare old wine." "To our lady loves now," and while the crimson of his cheek flushed to his brow he- said, almost reverently, "my peerless Isabel, queen, not of Castile and Aragon, but of this heart of mine."       ' They touched their lips to the glasses, but the opposite mirror showed the face of him they called Fred, white as death, while his- hand trembled so violently that the sparkling water was shaken over the goblet's rim, "Now, Weldon!" "Maid Marion--iot Robin, Hood' bride was, half so fair." "Aleck!" "Blue-Eyed Mary- come hithef pretty straan ger." "Fred!" "My wife, whoever she be." They laughed gaily and drained their glasses. -"Again," and Seymour lifted the decanter. "Come, Wel'."   12   -   WINE OR WATER. He held up his glass.   } "Now Aleck." He shook his head. "No more for me, Seymour. You know I'm -one of the moderates-- can't stand quite as much as you old soakers. By George, but my head swims a little now." "Pshaw, boy; all fancy. Swim on two glasses! Be a man now-and take another." "Be a man,! Aleck, and stop where you are," said he of the goblet. "Think of Mary, it would break my little cousin's heart to see her lover reel. Hah I there's the first bell; come on," and he led him away from the tempting glass. Something very like an oath trembled on Sey- mour's lips, as he dropped the stopples into the decanters and bore the salver away. "'It's too blasted bad," he said, as he came back and began darkening the room again, "too blasted bad that Aleck should be led by the nose so by that plagued parson. He might let others take the good of what's about them, if he won't himself. Confound him and all his cold water colleagues; I'd like to lay him under Niagara, and keep him there till he was wet through, soul as well as body. Well, come on, old boy; here's something in my pocket to keep the chill off when we come home," and he slapped his hands on the wicker-flask of brandy which he had dropped in it. "Guess I'll take my flute along, too, Belle likes it," and he unscrewed it as he went down stairs.   ' SEALING. THEMSELVES.    13 They were just in time'for the steamboat, and as it swung from its moorings and swept gracefully down the Co necticutthey hurried to the shady side lof the uppe , and while Fred leaned over the balustrade at the bow, watching the snowy path that was cut through the blue waters, the other three lit their cigars and paced back and forth. By-and-by Aleck joined him, and throwing away his Havana, sat down beside him and seemed to watch with him the frosted billows and rainbow spray. After a few moments he said abruptly, "don't- you ever drink anything stronger than water, Fred." "Yes; I always take coffee in the morning and tea at night." "Pshaw, Fred; you know what I mean; don't you drink wine, or brandy, or beer." "NEVER, Aleck." "Not only a temperate, but a total-abstinence- man, then."   ' "Yes." "But do you really think, Fred, there is any harm in drinking once in awhile, say on such days as this, our glorious Fourth, Christmas, New Yr's and Election. Aren't you willing a fellow should have any fun at all in this world." + "I will answer your question in order, Aleck, I think there is a great deal of harm in drinking on holidays, even if one does not mean to indulge at [i        ma I' *dl \   " -     WINE OR WATER.4 any other time. . We learn thus to love the taste of liquor, and from that the slide is easy to the daily dram, from the daily it is easier still to the hourly, and then, Aleck, a man is no longer a man, but a' devil incarnate, fit only to break women's hearts and blast little children's joys. I am willing a fel- low should have a great deal of fun in this world. I believe Heaven meant he should, for it sends more sunny than cloudy days, and gives every soul more joy than sorrow. But we are rational beings, not brutes, and our fun should never lay us in the gutter, to be picked up by a watchman. Aleck, Aleck, by the love you bear my gentle cousin Mary, I warn you to give up the wine glass. Now is the time for you to begin. For her sake, if not for your own, sign the pledge. Aleck, I am a drunkard's     l son. I know by bitter experience what comes out of the wine cup. I do not often refer to my early life; it is too painful; but the story may set you to tlinking and I guess I. shall 'have time to tell it to you before we reach home. "When my parents married, my father Was worth quite a little fortune and had an extensive practice as a physician. He was a man of brilliant talents, whole-souled and generous. He kept open house for everybody. If a poor man called him-to his slsk chiId, he would lead him into the dining-room and- bid him help himself to whatever he pleaseda from the sideboard; if a rich man summoned him   SEALING THEMSELVES.        15 to his sick child, he treated him the same, but no better. For five years my mother's life was like a halcyon day, for he almost idolized her and spared no means to   make his home   a happy   one. Everybody drank in those days, more or less, and she never realized that his habits would lead ulti- mately to ruin. They had one child only, a- boy, a bright and beautiful little fellow, and having only the one, doated on him with passionate tenderness. He had never -known a sick day and thus, in conse- quence, my father never felt-any fears when he left him. He always looked for his little curly head at the window in winter tide as he drove up to the house, while in summer he ever expected to meet him half way down the lane, waiting for a ride to the stable. But one day, when be drove up, he missed the little straw hat from the violet bank, as his favorite seat was called. He -put spurs to his horse, a nameless fear crushing his heart. He rode into the yard.   There was a sight to freeze his blood. His little four year old darling had climbed up a ladder that had been left standing against the: ' , house, and was now perched upon the eaves, his feet swinging against the walls. He caught a glimpse      : of his father, and wild with joy, hurried to descend. But his head turned dizzy and he fell- fell to the paved walk beneath, to he picked up by his- father, a little bruised corpse I "  From that hour my father was a drunkard. ie   16       WINE OR WATER. had no firm religious faith to cheer him - no hope even of ever meeting again his child. Willie was not to him, as to my mother, an angel boy, but only mouldering dust. The grave, not heaven held him, and he strove to drown his s. orrow in the wine-cup. I was born about a year after, and a more desolate childhood you cannot imagine. I never felt a father's kiss, or knew a father's love. My playmates, when meal-time came, would run to meet the ex- pected parent. I run from him. I had a hiding place under the eaves of the old garret of the dilapidated farm-house into which we had moved, 4  and there I have crouched hour after hour, now dripping with sweat and then benumbed with cold, waiting for him to go; oftentimes holding my fingers to my ears to keep out the sound of my mother's cries as his blows fell on her shrinking flesh. I know what it is to suffer from cold, from nakedness, from hunger. I know what it is to be P   knocked to the floor by a father's hand.

I was ten years old when I received the blow that made it. My mother had a little babe but a fortnight old and was very ill. She had, been getting along prettly well, till one day my father came in and told her to get up quick and cook him Bsome dinner. "I cannot, William," she said plain-   SEALING THEMSELVES.      t7 ly, "I tried to set up this morning, but fainted; Fred will get it for you." He swore a terrible oath and catching -up his great watch-dog, tossed him furiously on to the bed. He fell in a great heavy mass upon my mother's weak chest and nearly crushed her. She grew worse daily after that, and was at last too weak to lift her head from the pillow, My father depended at that time wholly on cards for his money. They failed him entirely one day, and in his maddening thirst, he sold the bed from under my mother.* "Get up," he cried fiercely, when he had told her of his hellish bargain, for it was to the dram- shop he had sold it; " get up--he'll be here in a moment after it." I worshipped my mother, and knowing it -was im- possible for her to rise, ventured to remonstrate with him. He was holding the carving knife in one hand and a loaf of bread in the other. As I spoke, he dropped the bread and flung the knife with terrible force against me. It gashed my forehead here and: I fell to the floor a fearful 9bject, the crimson blood ' spouting over my white face and rippling over the floor. At that moment the rum-seller entered. He was not a bad-hearted man, but he was thoughtless and bent on making money. Tender and affection- ate in his own family, he did not realize what a curse his golden gains were to the households of his * A  fact.     ^  .   18    -  WINE OR WATER.  customers, That sight opened his eyes. He has often told me of it, and of the remorse that has ever since haunted his heart. Till his dying day, he says he shall remember that picture. My infuriated father, in his demon-like attitude, the curse ringing upon his lips; the bleeding, senseless boy upon the floor; the pale, horior-struck mother in the bed, trying in vain to lift herself; the air of destitution that reigned in the room, only a little heap of warm ashes on the hearth, though it was a December-day, not a chair, not a table, not a thing, but the rude bedstead whereon lay the dying wife and little half- frozen baby. "For days I knew nothing. When memory did come back and with it thought and love, I learned that my mother had died a few hours after I was struck; her babe following her the next morning. Life had been weary to me before; it was doubly so now. I prayed to go to her; but I was young and healthy and the tide of life too strong to ebb at once, and I lived on. "For a time my father did better. A little humanity seemed to come back to him when he looked on my mother's corpse, and aided by his new friend, he who had unwittingly helped bring him down so low, he was for a year sober and in- dustrious. The poor, those who in other days he had visited without charge, now called upon him again and paid him enough to keep us quite com-   SEALING THEMSELVES.      19 fortable.

He discovered the mistake himself, but not till the mate of his boyhood was dead. "Thrice a murderer," he cried, " wife, baby and friend- all gone by my hand," and rushing from the house'he ran wildly to the river. It was deep and cold and swift.              "A purple mass of frozen flesh was found a week after on the beach some dozen miles below, and by the remnant of its clothes it was identified, and the husband was buried beside the wife.

Come on and 'have a drink, too. Come, they've some capital punch at the bar; come," and Seymour linked the reluctant arm within his own and led him away. "Lemonade for me," said Aleck faintly, as the young officer ordered three glasses of brandy punch. "Pshaw, you ain't a parson, are you? Come, be a man, now. The fourth of July don't come but once a year. It shah' be punch, shan't it?" "Just this once then, Seymour- ' "Aleck!"  He looked up. The dark eyes of Fred were ' gazing mournfully at him, and as their glasses met he lifted the hair about his temples and revealed the scar on his forehead. "Lemonade, Seymour," he said firmly; 4'you will take a glass with me, Fred."' "Gladly, I ap very thirsty," and they drained l the goblets.  - t! Seymours eyes flashed fire, and he murmured fiercely to Weldon, " he may stand perhaps between Aleck and me, but I'll have my revenge on him. I have his secret. I know why his face whitened so -when I named Isabel as my lady love. But there's the'bell. High Bank is in sight, Come on."   SEALING THEMSELVES.      21 High Bank was the name of the place to which the four young men were bound. It was the home of Fred's uncle, Mr. Irvin, the father of that blue- eyed Mary whom Aleck Parkman had toasted. It was a lovely and romantic spot-a high wooded bank rising from the Connecticut. The trees had been cut away sufficiently to give glimpses of the river to the inmates of the house, which was a broad, old-fashioned farm-house, a perfect ballad, with its stories of olden times and its family records of births, weddings and deaths. As the boat swept by it, the, young men caught the gleam of white drapery flittering through the greenness of the bank and knew there were fair yoang girls watching for them. About half a mile beyond there was a little pier. The engines ceased a moment their graceful undulations and suffered the boat to float softly towards the shore.- The rope was thrown over and made fast, the narrow passage planked, and then the young men sprang forward and waving their hats to the remaining passengers, who had crowded to the sides, rushed up the ascent and were soon seated in the long farm- wagon which had been in waiting.  The sable driver whipped up his horse and in a few moments the low grey house was in sight. '"How about those strawherries, Aunt," exclaim- ed- Fred, as he leaped to the ground. "' Have you plenty. We're a parcel of wolfish youngsters-- haven't eaten a mouthful since morning." v I                mni   22       WINE OR WATER." "I am glad of it, Frederick; for my supper will relish the better. Hunger makes good cooks you  il know," and with genuine New England hospitality she welcomed the young men, giving them each a hearty shake of the hand, holding Aleck's the longest though, for very dear had he already be- come to her, because of the love her little daughter bore him. "Where are the girls, Aunt?" "Scattered, Frederick; but I reckon, not run far. Hunt them up, while I take out my biscuit and draw my tea,."' A little summerphouse, half hidden in clustering rose vines, stood just on the edge of the bank. Fred and Aleck took at once the path that led to it. Very quietly they walked, treading on the turf as they came near, lest the sound of their steps on the gravelled walk should" betray them.  Peeping through the vines they beheld the object of their search, little Mary Irvin, reclining on a rustic seat, her white robe falling about her like a fleecy cloud. She was a lovely picture, and Aleck felt his pulses beat wildly as he looked upon her fair oval face with its clusteringr curls, and saw her blue eyes, fastened upon the golden locket which she held so closely in one hand. She murmured something, what, they could not hear, and then pressed her lips, her full, rich, cherry-red lips to the pictured -face and then, her whole countenance bright with   SEALING THEMSELYES.       23 blushes, hid it in her bosom and gazed tremulously about her. "Go in, Aleck," whispered Fred, " and I'll hunt, up the others;" and he darted away, while his friend stole quietly into the door and caught the young girl to his heart. "My own, my beautiful," he said passionately, "Are yourlad I've come?" "Glad, fAleck- how can I but be glad! Do I not love you before all others! O, the day has seemed so long without you!" There were half-uttered words of tenderness, delicate caresses and warm' kisses. They were be- trothed, and each in the innocence of their hearts thought heaven was very near to them. , Gay voices and musical trills of laughter aroused them from their delicious trance and they hastened to join their young friends. Fred had gathered them all; Seymour, the gay young officer, looking brilliant enough in his dashing uniform to win the hearts of half a dozen maidens, with the peerless Isabel whom he had found on the skirts of the. forest, carolling like a wild bird, and Weldon with his little maid Marion, a very child in everything, who had stolen away to the violets of the garden and busied herself in plucking the golden and pur- ple flowers, only to have them stolen from her andt wound gracefully about her lover's straw hat. "There's Aunt's tea bell, good folks,"' cried Fred L    t  ,/         .X-f   24       WINE OR WATERE. gaily, who was generous enough to conceal the pang it gave him to see Seymour bearing off before his very eyes, the chosen of his own heart. "Come on quickly. She'll never forgive you if you make her cream biscuit whit," and he led the way across the lawn to the broad cool porch with its trailing vines and sweet-scented blossoms. The'table was laid in the wide hall and was a tempting sight, with its old-fashioned luxuries; its long slices of white and brown bread; its plates of steaming biscuit; its balls of golden butter; its square bits of amber-hued cheese; its pitchers of rich cream; its glass stands of scarlet strawherries; its quivering custard and its juicy cherry pies ; its platters of nut-cakes and cookies, and its deep, round loaves of election cake. . They had a merry time over it, for the farmer and his wife were jolly souls themselves and loved nothing better than to gather about their hospitable board the young friends of their daughter. They were not far-sighted though, else never had Frank Seymour or Thomas Weldon found a place there. For though both stood high in the aristocratic cir- cles of their city home, they were dangerous per- sons to come into that pure place. Their wine- tainted breath was not fit to mingle with its mountain air. Their lips had too often drained the poisonous cup to be fit longer to press the fair cheeks of in-' nocence. They were like snakes in a bed of roses.,   SEALING THEMSELVES.       25 But they were there, and winning hearts, too. Already did Isabel, the queenly, gloriously beauti- ful Isabel, feel her cheeks crimson, when Seymour came in sight; while the child-maiden, little Marion, was tremulous as an aspen, did they but miention Weldon's name. Frederic Staunton's were the only eyes that saw the dangers :that surrounded that old home. He had many fears for his cousin Mariy, even, though less for her than for his uncle's two young wards; for Aleck Parkman was a young man who meant to do well, while the other lovers were already far gone in dissipation. Versed in all the ways of the world, though, they knew how to fascinate the two young girls who had grown up under the shadows of old trees, and in the sunshine of roses, and who little dreamed that the honeyed words spoken to them had been whispered a hundred times or more to city belles. Delicate presents, and still more delicate flattery, touched the hearts of Isabel and Marion, and woke up their slumbering passions. From the manly, noble heart which Frederic Staunton offered her, the one turned haughtily, while the warm pure love of a farmer lad was laughed at by the other. There was a rush from the table as carriage wheels were heard ringing on the path, and there were shouts of joy -and peals of laughter, as a fresh' group was welcomed, and thedsun went down upon a merry scene.; for to the music of old Joe's violin EI       o   -               !-.   26       WINE OR WATER. they were dancing and revelling on the lawn. By-  X and-by, as the darkness deepened, they hushed their AI gracefil steps and dispersed quietly here and there. Aleck and Mary stole to their old trystincg place,  the little summer-house; Seymour linked Isabel's  X arm in his and sauntered with her to the forest;  ; Weldon took Marion by the fingers, as a man might some child, and led her to the garden; the .new comers grouped themselves upon the bank and the place was still.,     -i Fred sat alone in the porch, toying idb with the tendrils that drooped about it, but thinking mourn-  fully of his blighted hopes. A light touch fell on his hand, and a voice said softly, " come."  He recognised it at once. It was the farmer-boy  who loved Marion.   They went down the steep  path to the river and seating themselves on the bent trunk of an old tree, remained awhile without  speaking, though Fred could hear the throbbings of the lad's heart. By-and-by he spoke abruptly, "Can't you save  ' her," he said. "Won't she hear you, you, whom she knows is her friend.

' Let us, William, you and I, seal' ourselves to cold water. All that it may save us from we do not know, but it will help make men of us." And then and there, on the banks of that beauti- ful river, with heaven's starlight over them, mur- muring mutsic all about them, the two young men sealed themselves to a life of temperance. Three hours later a steamboat, passing up the river, stopped at High 'Bank landing and took on three young men, whose reeling gait and hiccupincg words betrayed a close acquaintance with something stronger, a good deal, than mountain ale. ' Luc-luc-lucky I brou--ght that -flask with me," stammered Seymour, as he staggered over the plank. "We should a-a--tak-r-en cold, wai-- wai-ting there so long, for that deu-deu--ced boat.

It clung to the leafless boughs of the old elms that shadowed it, and whitened the shrubs that grew in the door- yard. Drifts were piled un- der the windows, and about the porch, while the narrow path that led to the front door was walled breast deep upon each side. The tall forest trees that lined the high bank were fringed as with ermine, and the ice that lay thick on the river below was crusted with frozen flakes. The snow-storm had lasted two days, but the sun rose in a clear, blue sky on the third, and its bright yellow beams shed a glory upon the mid-winter scene.  Farmer Irvin and his two hired-men were at   WIFE-HOOD OF MtARION WELDON.     81 work till near night, breaking the road to the river, and shovelling the snow from the doorways. Then casting by their broad spades and stabling their horses, they went into the woodshed and selecting the largest and soundest hickory logs, rolled them into the kitchen, carrying one to the ample fireplace of every room both below and above, and covering each with huge armsful of dry, .crackling birch. Like Yule fires, they soon blazed up, dropping bright- coals upon the broad hearths, and sending trains of crimson sparks up the wide- chimneys, to fall like shivered rockets upon the white earth. As the shadows deepened, the old farm-house be- came more and more cheery in its looks. The fire- light was reflected in a thousand hues from the high- ly polished oaken beams of the ceiling, while it flash- ed like auroral beams into every dim corner of the long, low rooms. Massive silver candlesticks which had been brought from old England, stood in bril- liant rows upon the narrow carved mantels, and bearing a tall waxen candle, whose wick burned slowly with a clear, colorless flame. Wreaths of evergreen hung in the windows and drooped grace- fully over the pictured faces that lined the walls. Vases filled with geraniums stood upon the little round stands, disposed in such picturesque style that they seemed like cones of pink and pearl colore4 flowers, while glasses of monthly roses in bud and in blossom, softened the too formal outlines of the   32!'     WINE OR WATER. broad and heavy mahogany tables, and the high, narrow cupboards and bureaus. Musical sounds went flitting about the old house, bursts of ripe laughter, snatches of song and the silvery tones of young girls' voices as they chatted their plans. Light steps ran up and down the wide staircase and in and out the chambers and parlors and kitchen. Baskets of ros7-cheeked apples, tank- 'ards of amber-hued cider and bottles of cherry and currant-red wine were brought up from the cellar. Plates of rich fruit cake, and platters of every con- ceivable kind of crullers, doughnuts and cookies were carried out of the pantry, while down from the loft over the kitchen were brought milkpans of chestnuts and walnuts. The farmer tasted the cider to be sure they had tapped the right barrels and loosened the corks in the bottles of wine that they might be ready for use, -the .farmer's wife swept out the bright coals from her oven and shoved in a couple of plump-breasted turkeys and two deep chicken pies, the hired men sat down by the hearth in the kitchen and cracked away at the nuts, while the merry young girls spread a long table in the family room and loaded it down with dainties. The old clock in the hall chimed six. "So late," they all cried; "we must hurry up our steps. Run, Marion, run for your life to your room and unpin your curls and we will be there in a minute to help you,"   WIPFE,-HOOD OF A{ARION WELDON.    38 With a shy, downcast look, the young girl went up stairs and entered her chamber, but, instead of' undoing her hair, she nestled down on the rug be- fore the warm. hearth and looked dreamily into the fire, now blushing and then turning pale. It was the eve of her bridal; When the old clock in the hall should strike eight, she would stand by the side of her lover and give up her girl- life forever. No wonder she quivered   in every nerve. No wonder her heart was all in a flutter and her head bewildered and dizzy. A  girl yet in years, a child in experience, she trembled as she thought Of the onorous duties be- fore her and looked back almost wistfully to the play-times of the past. The rose went off from her cheek as she sat and thought, and her eyes, those large, lustrous, brown eyes, were swimming in tears. Alnd yet not a fear for the future clouded her hopes; not a doubt of her lover shadowed her heart. It was only for herself she was troubled; young, timid and shrinking, could she make such a wife as she wanted to be; could she preside as she ought over the beautiful home he would carry her to; could she hope ever to be like his proud city friends, self-possessed at all times; would,he never have to blush for the simple little country girl he had married! She hid her face in her hands and'the fair, slen- der fingers were dampened, while drops, pearly as   34       WINE OR WATER. dew, fell down on the hearth. Tender, quivering mimosa-like bride! Blood drops from my heart as I think of your womanly trust in your lover and your girlish fear in yourself. And one stands under your window who would'have gathered you up to his bosom and held you forever; one, who like your- self was pure, as is childhood in thought, and good as are angels in deed; one whose strong arms would have warded off all the trials of life; one whose warm heart would have pillowed your head as on down. To and fro he goes in the drifts; unheeding the snow or the iwind, so deep lies the icq on his hopes, so mournful is the wail of his soul. And yet he would smile on your bridal could he feel that he who is so soon to clasp your dear hand, were what he should be; smile, because it was him only who nowhad to suffer. Well, well now he weeps for you as the ihour drawreth nigh that will make you a wife. Poor little maid Marion, better be unwedded for- ever than marry the man of your choice.   i She had met him but nine months before. A party of young folks from the city had come down to High Bank a-Maying. It chanced to be like a midsummer day, golden in sunshine .and balmy in soft south winds. The young girls of lthe farm- house were all dressed in white, with wreaths of arbutus starring their beautiful curls, and knots of blue violets fastening the lace on their bosoms. Very lovely they looked as they stood on the porch   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.     35 to welcome their guests, and Thomas Weldon who had been persuaded to come, by Seymour and Park- man, at the very last moment, thought he had never seen so lovely a trio. Isabel, tall, handsome and queenly, he knew belonged to his dashing friend Frank; Mary, fair, gentle, sweet -blue-eyed Mary, was claimed by the yet steady Aleclk; but Marion, little, timid dove of a girl, with soft, brown eyes and hair of like color that rippled down to her waist, with cheeks like the roses that had not yet blossomed, with lips like the heart of a sea-shell, Marion in her fresh, childish beauty, was yet an unclaimed one, and he resolved at once to win her all to himself. Something of good there was yet in him, old as he was in the evil ways of the city, and that some- thing was nurtured into new and beautiful life by the devotion he paid to that innocent girl. Not long did it take him to win her young heart. Hand- some in face, graceful in person, lavish in dress, fascinating in manner, knowing just how to dart thrilling glances from his brilliant black eyes, know- ing just how to modulate his rich voice to the most impassioned of love tones; knowing just how to touch the hands with that soft, tender clasp that goes to the furthest pulse, and to embrace the waist in a way that bewilders thought, it was no wonder Marion, all unused to the ways of the world, should have been dazzled by the gay young man; it was '-.,   36       WINE OR WATER. no wonder she soon came to love him with all the fervor of her warm temperament. He seemed to her like the inen she had read of in the few novels that had come in her way, and in her girlish dreams he was to her heart what Lord Mortimer was to Amanda Fitzallen, the personification of all that is lofty, and noble and true. Well sheltered in the art of wooing, the man of thirty knew how not only to win btft keep the love of his little darling, his sweet maid Marion, as lhe so often called her. Flowers were ler very life; and learning this, never a day passed, but a bouquet of rare exotics found its way to tdir'pretty silver vase he had one day placed on her stand. Bewitched for reading, he never failed to bring some new volume or fresh magazine in his hand, and to his credit be it said, he selected only.,those whose pages were pure and beautiful, for there was a charm to him in her innocence of thought, and not for worlds would he have sullied her spotless soul. She hIad a child's love of jewelry, and beside the betrothal ring, a dia- mond of rare value, lie crowded her fingers with flashing gems, hung a rich chain -with a little Geneva watch attached, about her neck, fastened gold bracelets about her arms, and an exquisite cameo pin where had once fluttered the blue violets. He petted her, too, as a father wyould have done his youngest, and was ever so gentle with her, that she blended a reverence with her love.   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELD ON.    37 The old farmer and his wife were delighted that their little young ward should have made so grand a match, for Weldon was wealthy and belonged to one of the first families in the State; while Marion, though her lineage was fair, was yet a ldowerless girl, and would have been a beggar child, but fpr the generous kindness of her father's friend. "She has done well," he said to his nephew as he talked with him on the night after his return from college. I could not have chosen better. He has been a little wild I expect, but he will settle down now he says and make himself a good, and steady man." lI "Don't he drink yet?"Staunton asked, after a little thought.             :  "Drink! O, yes, I expect he does occasiond:l.[;y: ^ nothing but wine though, he says, and I don't thiWi- he ever takes too much of it. He's been here th-:: ' .X times a week now ever since May came in, and I: ^:"-:: have never seen anything the least out of the way. If I had, you may depend upon it, I would have' talked to him." , Staunton did not reply. He knew his uncle's ways too well. Himself a moderate drinker all his  life of home-made wines and 9ider-brandy from his own still, he believed men could drink and yet never get drunk, and thought, the little talk that had yet ^ came up about temperance and temperance societies,  was all one great humbug. His own sister's life had    * "      -.       .    -   , .   38      WINE OR WATER. been blighted he knew by her husband's thirst for drink, and her orphan boy been saved from the alms- house by his own charity; but because he, himself, was strong enough to talie his daily dram year after year, and never once lose his manhood, he had faith that others could do the same, and looked on the drunkards as an exception to the rule. Staunton loved the little Marion as he would have done the sister who died when a babe, and immedi- ately sat about inquiring into Weldon's character. He found him to be what they now call "fast,"but. which twenty-five years ago, was desiginated by the more impressive word, .- dissipated.", No positive crime attached to his name. He had too much money to be ever in debt; too much pride to be a loafer or a blackguard; too much self-respect to debase himself by midnight brawls. But he visited fashionable saloons, kept a basket of champagne con- stantly in his office ; belonged to a bachelor's club where they drank till the small hours of the morn- ing; gave wine parties in his own house and rev- elled till he was too dizzy to climb to his chamber. People said he was generous, kind and affectionate, governed by impulses rather than principles, trust- ing in himself rather than in Heaven. "Would you be willing to marry your daughter to him,' said Staunton to an old friend of Weldon's; one who had known him from boyhood. The old man shook his head solemnly. "No,   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.    39 no," he answered; " not that I think he. would ever misuse her; but because I should fear he would so misuse himself that life would be terrible to her. Drink does not affect his heart as it does some men's; it affects his head, and I shall greatly miss my guess if he is not yet made insane by the wine- cup.  - With a sad heart, Staunton went. back to the farm-house. The lovers were standing in the porch as he drew nigh and made a beautiful picture, Wel- don, with his dark eyes bent tenderly on the blush- ing face that leaned against his heart, and Marion B looking up to him as trlistingly as a wife does to the husband whom she honors, the flush of gratifica- tion on his yet handsome face, and thefittng colors of a bashful love floating over her dimp Hed^! i. - One of his arms wound about her slenderw ,' and the other held within her two soft palms, anl' g about them both, hung the drooping spray[i- a cluster rose with their wealth of delicate buds and blossoms. Staunton looked at them long, before he rustled:' the shrub that hid him, looked at them and sighed,  conscious that the happiness of that sweet girl hung \ on a thread fragile as glass. -How quick even now could he make her cheek turn white and her eyes fill with tears. Should he tell her what he had learned, should he let her go to her bridal without a word of warning. "By the memory of my angel   40      'WINE OR WATER. mother's sorrows, no, no, " he murmured, but just then he saw her lift the ]and she held to her lips and kiss it fervently. It seemed an involuntary act, for the color deepened to crimson on her cheeks as she dropped it again, but it was a revelation to the observer of the deep love she cherished towards her betrothed, and he turned away, feeling he could not warn her. "Her love may save him," he said; "I cannot, cannot tell her. But I will talk to him, talk as a brother who would save his sister; talk as a child who had no childhood."  And he did. That very night he accompanied Weldon to the landing, and while they waited for the midnight boat, he besought him by the love he bore to Marion to promise to give up his wine cup. He told him his own sad story, spoke of his mother, hurried to her grave while yet -In life's eairly:womanhood, of his baby sister, dying for want of care; of his father, hurling himself under the cold wtaters, of himself, turned adrift as a pauper boy, and then asked him solemnly if he could bear the thought of seeing that little child-bride of his enduring such sorrows. "By the holy heavens, no," said Weldon, passion- ately. "Harm   Marion, my pet, my darling, the only woman I have ever loved, never, though I were ten times as drunk as I have ever been. No, Fred, no; I respect you for what you have done-it Wg for Marion. I am glad you love her so deeply as to : VA   WIFE-HOOD OP MARION WELDON     41 try and make a saint of the man she has chosen, but it's no use, Fred. I cannot live without my wine. I'll promise you this much though, never, never to get drunk again, NEVER, Fred, and when I say a thing I mean it. Good-bye'; there is the boat." Staunton turned away only half satisfied, and well did he have his fears; for only a week later, on the anniversary of our Country's Independence, within sight of the home of his betrothed, he drank till he was senseless. Others, beside Staunton shuddered to see the fair young girl give herself up to one who had been so long a lover of wine, and ,the less delicate in sensi- bility hesitated not to inform her of his past life. but instead of going manfully into her presence, they sent her anonymous letters. Three came in one day. Her cheeks paled as she read them, and had she been a woman perhaps she would have pondered them deeply, but an unsuspicious child, she put them into the fire and said quietly, " some enemy has done it." There came more. She read them and the next time her lover came down handed them to him. - "And do you believe them," he asked with a filu!q (: ing face.         *        ii/ "Believe them, Thomas I No, no; but why --1 : they do it."                 ' "Why, darling; can't you guess why?" and he  wound his arm about her and drew her to his bosom. "My little girl, So fair, so sweet, has captivated   42       WINE OR WATER. many a heart in yonder city. They are- jealous of me, Marion; jealous because I have won the prize they craved." "' And yournever have been drunk then, Thomas." Her eyes were fixed upon him, but he,'did not quail, only bent his head and kissed her lips and asked fondly, L' did you ever see me so, my darling?" She smiled a sweet, trusting smile; then said earnestly, "but you do drink wine quite often, Thomas." "Of course I do, my little girl. Everybody does in the circles that I move in. I should be thoughlt very unfashionable if I did n't. And you all drink it here, too, don't you? I am sure aunt Irvin is forever teasing me to taste her currant wine." Then changing his tone to one of solemnity, he said, "Marion, I have been a wild youth, I'll acknowl- *edge; but I have no gentle mother to train me; no sweet sister to guide me. My father was a stern, cold man, and I full of life and spirit, could not brook the church-like atmosphere of home, and ran away from it, sometimes to seek society that was congenial to my young heart. Yes, I have been wayward; but Marion, I have long since sowed all my wild oats and now, now that I have your pure, angel love to bless me, I shall reform and grow into a good, true man." And then, he painted as only a lover can, the home they would enjoy together, and she believed all, and went to Wer room that night,   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.     43 happier than ever, because she felt that a soul's sal- vation lay in her trusting love. And when the let- ters came she tossed them into the fire without breaking seals, murmuring softly, "dear Thomas; they would tear me-from you, if they could." One there was, who would have died for her, but he could only suffer on in silence and give her his daily and nightly prayers, her poor boy-lover from whom she had turned tway. Staunton, called to a distant village to begin his pastoral duties, left her with many a yearning thought, for he was only half satisfied with Wel- don's promise; those in "the city above who had striven to save her, angry that their words were scorned, said she might make her own bed and lie in it now; they wouldn't soften it if they could; but he who had led her infant feet to the old red school- house day after day, played with her as a child and loved her as a girl, he was true to her yet, and did what alone he could do in that extremity of agony,- bend his knee and pray. Time passed on. Weldon wished the marriage solemnized ere six months of acquaintanceship, but her guardian said it must be deferred till her birth- day which came in midwinter. That day had now arrived and the preparations for the bridal were completed. Another hour and Marion would have joined hands with him she loved, "until death did them part."  Blindly was her   "      WINE OR WATER. affection, but O, how tender. Entirely did she give herself to the man whom she had promised to cleave to.  . . "Asleep, pet, or building a castle?" and Isabel touched her shoulders and then drew the white face to her bosom and kissed it tenderly. "Tears, as I live, birdie; tears on your bridal night; what means it. You surely do not distrust your lover. If you do, darling," and Isabel's face grew stern, " it is not too late. Marion, don't wed him if you have a single fear." "Fear, Belle, I fear only for myself, I am such a simple little country thing. Won't he be ashamed of me sometimes." "Ashamed, darling, ashamed of the lovliest little bride that a man ever won! No, pet, no, indeed. You are too timid, Marion. You underrate your- self. You will make one of the very best of wives I know, and aunt Irvin says you're a capital little house-keeper. Thomas Weldon ought to get down on his knees and bless the day that he first saw you. You did look sweetly then, pet, with the arbutus in- your hair and the violets in your bosom-I don't wonder he was smitten." "Not a single curl unpinned, Belle, and we our- selves to dress yet. What ails you both?" and Mary lifted Marion's head from Isabel's bosom and looked at her keenly. "Been a-crying, as I am alive, crying on your bridal night. Come, come,   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON. .     45 wipe off those tears; I wouldn't for worlds your bridegroom found you with this pallid face. He will be here soon, too. Hark," and she ran to the -window and raised it a little whs. "They are coming now, yes, I hear them." They both follow- ed her, and sure enough on the still, frosty air came floating the joyous music of a dozen strings of bells. "We must hurry; O, go fast now," and Mary seated the bride in a chair. "I'll dress her feet and you shall arrange her hair, Belle; you always do it so sweetly," and she brought from the bed the pearl- colored silk stockings and soft satin slippers. ' There, that'll do, Belle, she looks like an angel. Here, take off that sober mering, high-necked and long-sleeved -if I were Thomas I swould never let her cover her neck and arms again; just see how white and delicate they are. There, you arrange, the veil-gracefully, Belle, gracefully-and now fastenthese orange buds; I rifled my pet tree to make out enough; there-" standing a little way off and gazing at her, "she looks like the maid of 1   the mist with all that white, fle ecy drapery. Now,  sit yourself down here," ensconcing her .in a wide arm-chair, " and don't stir till you hear your bride- groom's step. Come, Belle, we haven't a moment to lose; the sleighs are quite here; hurry up." She did not sit still, little Marion; she could not. She rose and went to the mirror and gazed awhile with a crimson cheek at the picture re- i                       &   "      WINE OR WATER. fleeted there. Then she paced back and forth with one hand on her heart and the other pressing her brow. Then she went to the bed, the old- fashioned canopied bed, upon which she had slept ? all her girlish life, and falling upon her knees, she prayed to the good All-Father for strength in the life that was soon to begin-prayed fervently, earnestly, though no word dropped from her lips. Thenshe went back to her seat and sat down. Footsteps were heard on the stairs, a quick, manly tread. It came to her door and then halted. The heart of the listener seemed to cease beating. - A low, nervous tap. She whispered " come in," and half rose to go forward and meet him, and then bashfully dropped again in the chair. "My own, my beautiful bride," and Weldon gathered the drooping form to his, breast and kissed ^*   her brow, cheeks and lips. "How -lovely yo are," holding her from him at arm's length and scanning her fondly. "My lily, my pearl, my fair little maid," and kissing her again and again, he at length gently seated her and knelt at her feet and laid his head on her lap. "Marion, dear Marion," he said softly at last, s" you shall never, no never regret this hour, The moment that makes you my wife shall reform me forever. All the good that'ls in me shall start into beautiful life. You shall never have to blush for your husband."   WIFE-HOOD, OF MARION WELDON,     47 He spoke earnestly, solemnly, and felt what he said, and had he loved the good God as he loved that fair girl, and his heart been as full of religious faith as it was of sensuous passion, he perhaps would have kept his vow. But alas for the man that trusts in himself alone as a guide. His feet will soon falter, his arm grow weak and his heart be faint. Voices sounded in the hall, joyous voices and light steps drew near the door. Weldon rose and linking the arm of his bride within his own, ad- vanced to meet the gay group. Seymour and Isabel, Parkman and Mary, groomsmen and -bride- maids, entered the room for a morIgeA, and then ,with mock solemnity escorted the plighted couple to the parlor beneath. The guests hushed their whisperings and gazed in a sort of holy awe at the bridal train, for seldom have three finer looking men been seen in a row and never three lovelier girls. One moment they stood in their places, and then the old minister who had christened the bride when she lay in her mother's arms a sweet babe, advanced to perform his high duty. All eyes were fixed upon the young couple.. None saw through the window the pale, haggard face that was pressed on the panes, and in the grasp, ing of hands and the wishing of joy that soon fol- lowed, none heard the wild sobs of that listener out- side.  i  ;1   48       WINE OR WATER. The bridal feast over, the doors of the parlor were again thrown open and the bride and groom motioned to enter. Marion started back in surprise, and then as a child runs after its Christmas gifts, she bounded to the side of that beautiful bridal tree. It stood on a low round table, an orange shrub from the green-house of a friend, which had been mysteriously conveyed to the farm-house in wrap- pings of wool.   Buds, blossoms and fruit hung from its light stems, and twined in amongst them were rich gifts from every friend of the bride, and from her husband a full set of pearls, a string for her neck, bracelets for her arms, rings for her fingers, and a pin for her bosom. "Too good, too generdus," she murmured softly as he proudly arrayed her in them. "Can I ever, ever love you enough, my --" "Husband," he said fondly; snatching a kiss from her quivering lips and leading her to a mirror. . Who that saw them standing together there then, so full of life, joy and love, would have thought that a single year hence -but we will not antici- pate! ... . . Towards noon the next day, the string of sleighs returned to the city, Isabel and Mary ac- companying the bride to take part in the festivities of the honeymoon. Weldon had refurnished 'his father's house, and to the little, simple country girl he brought there, it seemed like a palace with its - L    WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.      -49 frescoed walls, its rich velvet carpets, its costly mirrors, its brilliant burners, its carved rosewood chairs' and sofas with their crimson cushions, its satin curtains, marble tables, piano, guitar, book case, china, silver and endless paraphernalia of wealth, "' Yours, all yours," he whispered, as he led her from room to room. "We shall be very happy in this new home, shall we not, little darling?" Tears gathered in her eyes as she strove to speak. He kissed them off, and she rested her head on his heart and thought that in the whole wide world there lived not another wife so blest as she. The elite of the city assembled that evening to wish her joy, and all were charmed with the simple grace with which she performed her new duties, and all fell in love with her beautiful face and soft, low voice. Party after party followed in such rapid succession that it seemed to Marion she lived in a fairy land, and was never to awaken to life's lessons and duties. And she almost rejoiced when the festal month was over, when Isabel and Mary returned to the farm- house and she and her husband sat down to their tea-table for the first time alone.

"So yve will, little lady,'; and following her light steps to the luxurious room above, he stretched him- self at full length upon the rich rug, and when she nestled down on a low stool, he laid his head in her lap, and as her fingers fondled his face and toyed with his hair, he drank in, it seemed to him, the very nectar of joy. Pure and beautiful thoughts came to him and when, unconsciously she warbled snatches of hymns, low, thrilling church music, he  listened as men do to the whispers of angels. How short seemed that evening; how delicious that sweet trance of love!  . . . "Going out!"Marion's voice quiver- ed. She had fancied every evening would now be like that last one, and had longed all day for the twilight to come. "Yes, darling. I cannot get out of it well. You see the bachelor's club to which I've belonged ever since I became of age, meets to-night to celebrate my obsequies,"   he laughed gaily. "But you will try to be home quite early, Thomas; it will seem so lonely here."  "Yes, wifey, I'll try; but if you get sleepy in the least, don't wait for me, love. They are a set of wild fellows I have to meet, and revel pretty hard I expect. A pity they can't all find such a darling as once crossed my path. How soon they'd be tamed. Say, Marion, pet, don't you think I'm fast getting good?"   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.     51 "Yes, indeed," she said, laughingly. "You'll yet be a saint." Then lowering her voice to a tender tone, she said earnestly, '"You are growing good. You have only said one /bad word in a week." C"And you surely couldn't blame me for that, little darling, when that careless servant knocked down that exquisite vase and smashed it to atoms; one, too, that I hadbought on purpose for you." "Not much--but listen, and you don't take but three glasses of wine a day now, when you used to drink- " "A dozen, perhaps."

She pressed her lips, ler pure loving lips to his own, and brought him his boots, over coat and cap, and followed him to the front door. "He is good," she said, as she then ensconced herself in his easy chair and took up a new book. "I wish every woman had a husband just like him. How he does love me," and dropping the volume, she closed her eyes and lived over courtship and i   . y          *   52       WINE OR WATER. honeymoon.  There was nothing she would have changed if she could. He had treated her ever as a high-minded, honorable, affectionate man would treat the girl of his choice, the wife of his bosom, and grateful and happy, she resumed her reading and abandoned herself entirely to the witchery of the new book. "So late," she exclaimed as the clock struck eleven. "'So late and Thomas not yet come in! But then he said they were a wild set there. If they should get him--drunk--," she spoke the word hesitatingly, but then continued with anima- tion, " they can't though; he loves me too well to come home to me so. I will brighten up the fire so the room shall look pleasant to him, and then get ready for bed. He will surely be in by that time.' So she raked out the ashes from the grate, piled on the fresh coal, drew the curtains yet closer, turn- ed down the bed-clothqs, put out the gas and lit the little silver night lamp, and then undressed and sat by the fire and combed out her beautiful hair. Fastening it up under her pretty night-cap and throwing a shawl over her shoulders, she brought her little Bible and read till her eyes grew heavy. Then kneeling on the rug, with her head upon her low rocker, she breathed out her prayers and with the low amen on her lips, fell fast asleep. The clock had just struck twelve. It struck one and she did not stir, did not hear the sleigh bells   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.     53 that jingled in the street, did not know that the front door was opened by her husband's pass key and he brought in by two friends and laid upon a sofa in the parlor.

I don't see how he-ever got it on, as dead gone as he is.' Thank the Lord, that's off. Now- for his dress coat and vest. There, I guess we can drag him up now," and half-carrying, half-leading him, they bore him to his chamber. "Hush," and Harmon who was foremost, pointed to the sleeping bride. "Don't, wake her for the world, patient little watcher," and nerving himself to get strength, he lifted Weldon  firmly by the shoulders, and while Seymour carried his feet, they crossed the room and laid him quietly in' the bed, drew off his stockings and pantaloons and,smoothed the clothes over him.'

She was a light sleeper and was soon awake, in- quiring who was there. "Throw on something and come out quick," he said, and when she stood by his side, he told her of Weldon's condition and, begged her to call up one of the girls and get his wife quietly into her bed. "Poor child, poor little sweet darling," she mur- mured, "I had hoped better things. I'll see to her, sir. Do you take care of yourself, Frank Seymour.

Time enough then to reform, if its reform you insist upon. Enjoy yourself while you are free." "Fra*nk, I can never, no never forget4 that pale bride asleep on her knees. I am done with the wine cup forever," and he turned towards his home to register his vow, while yet it was fresh on his lips. It was daybreak when Weldon awoke. At first his confused, dizzy brain tortured him so he could not remember where he had been last or where he was now. When memory came back with slow, measured foot-falls, and he knew he had fallen from his seat at the convivial board and been borne to his home by his friends; then he thought of his wife, and lifting his head he looked earnestly at her. She lay by his side in the sweet sleep of innocence, no traces of tears on her eyelids, no pale streaks on her lips. He breathed easier. "She must have got sleepy and gone tobed be- fore I got home. Thank God! 'Twould have   56       WINE OR WATER. broken her heart. I'll never, no, never do it again," and he rose from the bed and took a look in the mirror. What a face met. his gaze, so hgggard, so dull, with such blood-shot eyes and tangled hair. Marion would have wept to have seen him. Well was it she slept the sound sleep of health. He went to the bath-room and plunged his head again and again under the cold water and then rub- bed his face till it was of a glow. He combed out his hair, curled his moustache, changed his soiled linen and returned quietly to the side of his wife. At sunrise she woke, woke with a start and look- ed wildly around. He folded her in his arms and asked what it was. "Scared, darlmng!" "Where am I? When did you get home? How came I in bed?" were the rapid questions she put to him. I only remember saying my prayers and must have gone to sleep on the floor. Did you put me here?" "Who else do you think would meddle with this dear little body?" and he kissed her fair brow. "Did you have a good time with your friends?" "They did I expect, but I thought only of you, home here all alone. It is the last time I will leave you. We're happier together." He promised in good faith and kept his word - a whole month, because no temptation came in that time. They went down to the old farm-house and made a long visit, and the farmer and his wife   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.     57 thought them the happiest couple the sun ever shone on, and Mary wrote to her cousin Fred that no par- son could be more sober than Thomas.  .. * * . "A note that came in just now," and Marion handed her husband a perfumed card of invitation. He read it in silence, twisted it in his fingers, and then looking up to her, said, "An old friend of mine had just come in possession of a for- tune long held in law, and writes me to join a few friends in celebrating the happy event. Shall I go?" Her heart said no, such a quiet evening had been in her mind but a moment before. Then she feared she was selfish to keep him so close to herself and said kindly, why, yes; go, of course. You have stayed at home now for a month." "But you'll be so lonesome." "Never mind, if I am; I must get used to stay- ing alone sometimes, you know. I shan't mind it much either, to-night. I'll take that sock I am knitting for you, and go and sit in Mrs. Mann's room. Her gossip will keep me awake." So he went, went resolved to come home by him- self, come home early and sober. But the wine was choice and sparkling, and once with his old mates, his old thoughts returned to him, and not one in the crowd was so brilliant as he. Twelve o'clock found him reeling; one o'clock under the table a senseless clod.   58       WINE OR -WATER. His little wife, patient, hopeful and trusting, after spending several hours in the housekeeper's room, amusing herself with the good'matron's gossip, re- turned to her own and made preparations for going to bed. But somehow she was not at all sleepy and taking, a new magazine from the table, read it through. Looking up to the clock she saw itwas on the point of striking one. "Dear me, so late and Thomas not- come. I'm afraid he is hurt, for the pavements are all a glare of ice. And the fire has gone down and he'll come in so cold!"She threw on a dressing gown, filled up the grate, trimmed the night lamp, put the room in cheerful order and then drew aside the curtains and looked out. There was nothing in sight. Her eyes swam in tears, her bosom heaved sadly, and sobs struggled in her throat. She looked and watched, but no shadow fell on the pavements; no sound broke the intense stillness. "I cannot endure this. I will go out and look for him. Perhaps he lays somewhere half dead," and putting on a hood and shawl, she ran down -the stairs and opened the front door. A sleigh came round the corner just at that moment. She watched with anxious eyes. It darted on and drew up before the stoop. "My husband, my husband," she cried and flew down the steps. They put her back gently, the ser- vants who had been sent to carry him home, but she would not be repulsed and clung to the senseless   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.     59 form they lifted out, uttering shriek after shriek. "She thinks he is dead," said one to the other. "A pity he isn't," was the reply as they bore him in 2 and dropped, him upon the floor in the hall. Her cries had aroused the whole household, and they came- flocking about her almost as scared as herself. Mrs. Mann only, had presence of mind to think coolly. "Take him to his chamber," she said to the men, " and you, Mary and Hannah, help me to carry her to my room. She is going into hyster- ics." "Don't, don't take me; my husband, my own, my dear husband," and she' burst from the females and run to the chamber and kneeling beside him, clasped his two hands and kissed his flshed face. Its hot touch seemed to restore her senses, for she rose from her knees and said quickly, ," he's alive; do something; Mrs. Mann, why don't you do some- thing,--call a doctor, bring medicines, see where he's hurt--O, do, DO, DO." The housekeeper motioned them all away, closed the door on them and then winding her arms about her, said gently, "he only needs sleep; he will soon  be himself. He has taken too much wine." The young wife looked keenly into her face. "Is he drunk?" she asked hoarsely. Mrs. Mann bowed her head. "My God, my God; my husband drunk! Please leave me alone." :,: v   60       WINE OR WATER. The housekeeper went out and the young wife was left with hier burden of woe. She went to the mantle, took down the lamp, carried it to the- lounge on which they had laid him and held it above him, murmuring softly, "drunk, drunk." She looked at him long and then turned away with a quivering lip and a pallid face. That man her husband! O, it was terrible, terrible!"My destiny, my des- tiny,?" she said wildly, " but I cannot, cannot accept it. A drunkard's wife! O, my Father, my Father in Heaven, let me die, let me die; I cannot, cannot endure it; it is too much, too much. But yesterday, my cup was full, brimful of joy; now it runneth over with the very dregs of sorrow." She walked the room for hours, walked till her feet refused to carry her, then -threw herself on the rug and tossed till it was morning, bright, beautiful morning. She went to the window to draw closer the curtains, and as she shut out the light, she mur- mured, " my sun set forever last night." The housekeeper came to the door with a cup of hot tea. She put it by gently, " don't ask me, I've no heart to take it. Come yourself when I ring though. I cannot bear others should see him." The hours passed away and still she sat there by the fire and waited for Ihim to awaken, her mind on a whirl, her heart in a flutter, her whole being filled with one thought, that he whom she loved lay beside her dead drunk.   WIFE-HOOD OF MARITO  WELDON.    '61 "' Marion!"  She started, but did not turn round. "Marion, my wife, have you no word of pity for your poor suffering husband."  It was a low, sad tone, and went to her heart and she rushed at once to his arms. "I was tempted, my darling, tempted and fell. Can you ever forgive?" He threw his whole soul in his eyes as he bent them upon her. What wife of two months could have resisted that glance, so mournful, so thrilling! She could not, but wound her arms closely about him and forgave him entirely. Forgave, but could not forget, though she cherished no bitterness in her heart. Memory is too often tenacious of wrongs; we cannot forget what we would. Another month passed, but not of unalloyed joy, for Mariont was distrustful and feared every time her husband went out he wouldcome home a wreck. She grew thin and pale, and the dark rings of grief circled her eyes, which were daily more thoughtful and dreamy. "I have to go down   the river apiece on some business; will you go with me  and wait at High Bank?   If so, I will take to-night's boat and stop for you to-morrow."  She plead an excuse, a sick headache. She knew she did not look like herself and she could not bear L                   ,   62       WINE OR WATER. they, her old friends, should know she had trouble. Poor thing, she was fast learning the saddest lesson of wife-hood, to suffer in silence. "Then I'll take a buggy this morning and come back to-night. And don't you worry a bit, for I'll be just as good as a saint." But she did worry,-all day, and when evening came, was nearly frantic with fear. "If he should drink too much, with those spirited horses to drive- O, my head, my poor head, can I bear to think what might happen." A thunder storm gathered, a fierce April storm. The rain fell in torrents and the darkness could almost be felt. With her face, her white, tearful face pressed to a window she watched for his coming. He drove up at midnight, drenched to the skin. She ran to the door. "Thank God, you have come; but how wet and cold; let me help you take off your things. What a terrible night. "A night to make a man swear, little lady. Curse on the-" "My husband," and her hands pressed his lips. "I am here, and there," pointing above, "is our -God. Respect him, if you will not your wife." "I will, little Methodist sister," he said with a rueful attempt to be playful, " but I am soaked and starved and dry as a fish." "Come up to our room. I have a good fire   WIFE-HOOD OF MARION WELDON.    63 awaiting, and some oysters already to stew, and some bread already to toast, and dry clothes have been airing for hours." "' You are a sweet little wife, that's a fact. I'd kiss you if I wasn't so wet," and he reeled to his room, for he had drank hard on the' road and was far gone in inebriety. She knew it; she felt it, but I. 1 not by a word or look did she suffer him to guess so. !I I She brought him warm water to wash in, combed out his damp hair, wrapped him up in her own soft shawl and cooked him a nice little supper. But when he lay asleep in the bed, she went down to the parlors and wept. Morning found him in a high fever, and long before night he was delirious. Days and weeks passed before he grew better, and all the long time, Marion watched him herself. Friends gathered about him,. for his warm, generous temperament had gained him a crowd, but to none would she give up her charge. Only when Isabel and Mary sat by his side, would she consent to lie down on a lounge, drawn close to his bed. "He asked me for wine, shall I give it to him?" she said to the physician one day when he seemed :a good deal better. The old man shook his head. "A few drops at a time he may stand, but only a few. He is weak; weak in n'erves and in brain, and needs a low diet. Mind, only a spoonful.' "No more, little wife; it's hardly a taste," and he swallowed it eagerly, lapping the spoon.   "      WINE OR WATER, "It's the doctor's command. You have been very sick and must be cautious, or you will never get well. Try now to take a good nap," and she brought a fresh pillow and placed it tenderly under his head. "You lie down beside me," he said, in his old affectionate tone. "My sleep will be sweeter." She was weary with watching and gladly com- plied with his wishes. He drew her head to his bosom and murmured low love talk, and hummed snatches of melody, till the lids drooped over her aching eyes, and her measured breathing told that she was fast asleep. ".Snared," he said with a strange gleam in his eye; " now little lady, I'll have my own way," and with a strength born of maniac cunning, he lifted her head to a pillow, and rose noiselessly from the bed. ' There was a little closet at the side of the mantel in which Marion had been accustomed to keep the medicine prescribed, and it was there she had put the bottles of wine from which she had poured the few drops. He pulled opened the small panelled- door, seized the coveted drink and stopped not till he had swallowed it all, murmuring, as he went back to the bed, "pity a fellow can't have what is his own." Marion's sleep lasted several hours, and when she   WIFE-HOOD OF MA-RION WELDON.    65 awoke it was almost night. She started up in afright, then sank quietly back with a thankful heart, for her husband lay by her side in what seemed a deep sleep. A light footfall trembled upon the carpet. She looked up. It was Mrs. Mann. "'You have had a good rest," she said, kindly. "' Get up now; and go down to your tea-it is all ready, and Mr. and Mrs. Irvin have come up from  6 High Bank to. stay with you awhile. I will watch him; " and she drew a chair to the bedside. Marion smoothed out her hair, adjusted her rumpled dress, and ran down to meet her old friends. A little of the old and beautiful light beamed in her brown eyes, and a faint smile rippled over her face. Her husband was better; perhaps would get well. "You will go up and see him," she said, as they rose from the table. "It will not disturb him; I think, even if he is awake, for he inquired for you only this morning." They found him still sleeping, and Mrs. Mann bending anxiously over him. "Is he worse?" The whisper was hoarse. "I don't know. There's a change. His limbs tremble queerly; he starts as if he had bad dreams; his flesh, too, is cold and humid; his pulse small and weak. I think we had better send for the doctor." They did, but he was not at home. "Perhaps I1 , .   "      WINE OR WATER. only imagined it," Mrs. Mann said, seeing the pale- ness on Marion's cheeks. "He seems now to sleep quietly, and his pulse grows stronger. 'll get some drafts for his feet, and put a wet cloth on his head and rouse him up and give him his drops." Ten o'clock came and he continued the same, save that his sleep was less broken. One by one they withdrew, a servant lying down in a little bed- room adjoining; Left alone with him, Marion fin- gered his pulse, felt of his- forehead, bound on a fresh towel, readjusted the drafts, and as he still slept on, grew easy at length and threw herself on the foot of the bed, not meaning to sleep. For a long while she lay listening to his breathing, and counting the quarter hours as they were struck by the clock. Then she, too, fell asleep, and a stillness as of death veiled over the household. It was broken by the sharp report of a pistol, and a shriek that seemed to come up out of hell. Marion was on her feet in a second. Good heavens; what a sight met her eyes. The chamber was all in a glare of light, the gas in every burner brilliant with flame. In the centre of the room, with a sheet drawn carelessly over him, danced her husband, flourishing a pistol in each hand, one of which, when he saw her, he pointed to the mirror which lay shivered to atoms. "I've shot him," he yelled. "I bore it as long as I could. Yes, you gibing, mocking, threaten-   WIFE-HOOD OF MAIfON WELDON.     67 ing, thundering fiend; I've ended your days and your imps shall follow you, too. See them, wifey, see -them there," and he pointed to the gilt cornices of the curtain. "See the little devils grin. All ready to jump, are you. You'll pull my hair will you; pinch my cheeks; blister my lips; tie my hands; cramp my feet; dance on my back; drag me over the floor and stick your arms down my throat to pull out my heart. You will, ha, ha, ha,"* and her laughed a laugh that curdled the blood of: his wife. "This'll send you all to your father, the prince of all devils, the king of black darkness," and again the sharp report iof a pistol rung through the house. Every one rushed to the room, but the united strength of Mr Irvin and the servant could hardly bind him. Quivering in every nerve, drenched with perspiration, ghastly white, with staring eyeballs and foaming mouth, he lay at last upon his bed, tied down with ropes. "What is it," breathed rather than asked the wife of the doctor. "Has 'the fever come back." He shook his head. "I wish it had, child. I could battle with that. This is beyond me. It is--" he hesitated, he could not bear to speak the dreadful words. "What," she grasped his arm. Tell me. I am his wife." *The very words of the unfortunate man whose story I am writing. /   68      WINE OR WATER. "Delirium Tremens." A low cry parted her lips and then she fainted. Fainted, but soon came too, and with a heroism worthy a lyric, took up the new cross laid upon her, and bore it to the end. Seven months of madness I Seven longmonths she shut herself up in that prison-like chamber, and waited upon her maniac husband. In vain they plead with her to send him ,to the Asylum. "I will not desert him now, when he so much needs a wife's tenderness," she would say. "There may come suddenly a ray of reason to his mind. I must be with him then." Nurse after nurse was worn out and went away. Watcher after watcher wearied of the fearful vigil. Friend after friend grew sick of the dim chamber and was carried home. She only, the little child- wife, was constant. Love died out of her heart- the love of the wife, but a tender pity stole in, and as a mother cares for her idiot child, or a sister for her crippled brother, 'so cared she for that wreck of manhood.

As his strength gave way, the paroxysms became weaker and hap- pened at longer intervals, and at last ceased entirely. The light of reason shone in his sunken eyes. On the verge of the grave, his manhood, pale, shadowy and ghost-like, returned to"llive awhile in his wasted frame. The devils were cast out and the angels went in. "I have darkened your life," he said to his patient wife; ;" but bear with me now till I pass away. A few days and my stormy career will be over. I shall go where the wicked cease troubling, and the weary are at rest." He was too weak to converse- much, but he sent for his nearest and dearest young friends, and spoke a few solemn words of warning. He called in his lawyer and had his will drawn up, bequeathing one half his fortune to his wife, one quarter to Fred Staunton, "the only man who ever tried to save him from ruin," he said, while the remainder, with the exceptions of some legacies to his old servants, was given in trust td Marion and Fred to benefit ^  ),   70       WINE OR WATEmR.  drunkards, their wives and children, "all the repa- ration I can make to humanity for the shame I have brought on it." "And now, friends, you must fit me for death. Read to me, sing to me, pray for me. I have no strength to work out my own salvation." Day after day they sat by his bedside, Staunton, Isabel, Mary, and the little pale wife. Chapter after chapter was read, prayer after prayer was breathed, hymn after hymn was sung. "My last days are my best," he would say. 4' O my wasted life - my wasted life." "Draw the curtains, Marion. I would see the sun go down once more." He sat pillowed up in bed, for his breath came hard. "Earth is beautiful," he murmured, "it would be as heaven but for our sins. What brilliant rays! They will soon shine on my grave. Don't bring in lamps," as the twilight gathered, ' these shadows suit my eyes. Marion, put by these pillows and hold my head/awhile. So; so; darling. I would feel yo ur ert beat."

The room was very dark ere they finished, and the silence that followed those last impressive lines, "O grave! where is thy victory? O death! where is thy sting?" could almost be felt. Gently, very gently did Marion lift the head of the sleeper from her bosom and place it upon a pil- low, and her lips quivered and her eyes filled as she turned away from the bedside, maiden, wife and widow, in a single year., [       ,   *     CHAPTER III.

"It is over now," he said, when an hour of anxious watching had passed away. "Keep her quiet; she needs sleep. Mrs. Weldon, I would see you a moment alone." Marion followed him to the parlor. He closed the doors and drew her to an alcoved window. "Tell me what has caused this," he asked in a hoarse whisper. "I cannot, sir. I have no idea. She left me late in the afternoon yesterday, to visit a poor family in whom we have been deeply interested. She didn't j    return till late in the evening. I was out myself when she came in. She told the servant she had a sick headache and asked them to make her excuses to me for not coming into the parlor. I thought nothing of it till breakfast time, when as she did not appear, I went to her room and found her, sitting by the window, dressed just as when she left me to 1: go out, save that her bonnet lay crushed upon the - carpet.

"He has been very wild, but since- since," her voice quivered, - " since my husband died, he has  been an altered man, and Isabel told me he had promised her he would never again touch the wine- cup.

Her proud spirit may sustain her sufficiently to prevent her health being seriously disturbed, but her heart will be surely shattered." A tap at the door interrupted him. It was the housekeeper. Her face was very white and she spoke hurriedly--" please come ;I believe she is crazy." They hurried up stairs. Isabel sat in the middle of the floor, her clothes nearly torn off of her and her dark hair dishevelled. Her eyes were wide open, and a wild light flashed from them. Her cheeks were crimson, tnd foamy bubbles crested her swollen lips. She was tearing into inch bits the handker- chief they had bound; about her forehead. She ceased for a moment as she saw the physician and Marion enter, then recommenced, whispering earnest- ly to herself. "Here, take them," she said to Marion, after a moment or so, " take them--they are my wedding cards. I am to be married in a week--married in church - shall I not be a bonny bride. I hope the sun will shine, and the birds sing, and the flowers bloom, for as is the day, so may the future be. Fly swifter, swifter, time, I cannot wait. My bride- groom-there he comes, see," and a smile haloed her face. But as if some terrible sight had blasted her vision, it faded in an instant, and a look of horror   THE BROKEN VOW.

A wild scream parted her lips, and burying ; her head in her hands, she shrieked, "Save me, save me, save me I ' When the paroxysm was over, they bore her to her bed, and for days watched beside her as she lay in the delirium of fever. From her almost inarticu- late ravings they gathered at last the fearful truth. Her fover had broken his vow, and she had seen him in the madness of intoxication. It happened this way. She had been a  resident of Marion's home ever since the young husband's death, tending the strickeqn widow with the faith- fulness of a sister, in the long and tedious illness that seized her immediately after the funeral. ; One morning in May, when Marion was convales- cent, she had walked out a little way into the coun- try to find some apple blossoms, the invalid having expressed a wish that she could see the orchards in !  their bloom. Drooping over an old-fashioned zig- 1  zag fence, hung a tempting bough loaded with the pink-white buds. Selecting the loveliest spray, she was about to sever it, when a sobbing sound met her ear, a child's sob, and one that seemed to well up from the depths of a little heart. She turned the angle of the fence. There, half hidden by wet bushes, lay a man, ragged almost to nakedness, and beside him a little boy about six-years old, whose only garment was a tattered shirt. The man had   78      SWINE OR WATER. evidently lain there all night, for his rags were satu- rated with dew. His hands were clasped over his breast, and encircled a broken bottle. His hair was matted, his face bloated and mud-stained, and his whole aspect brutish. The child had evidently been trying to arouse him, and failinog in that, was crying as though his little heart was broken. "What is the matter, little one?" said Isabel, gently. "He won't wake up, and mother is dying she says. Father," and he laid his face close beside the drunkard's ear, "wake up. Mother sent me to hunt you; she is dying, and sissy and bubby are hungry and the baby is crying, and we're afraid the cross man will come. Come, father, wake up; O, do, do, do." He might as well have talked to the ground on which the father lay, for not the slightest motion followed his agonized appeals. Isabel went herself to him, but all her shaking was of no avail. He was dead drunk. "Show me where you live, little boy," taking him by the hand. The child looked wistfully at the prostrate man. "We will come back for him, by-and-by," said she gently. "Let him   sleep; it will'do him good. Come now with me. Where is it you live!" "Nowhere, ma'am, nowhere.

Entering the long, narrow, dim hall, he ran up a light of steep stairs. They creaked at every step and shook as in a gale. Up, up, up, till they had to bend their heads to avoid the eaves. "Crawl now," said he, "or you'll bump ypur head." She obeyed and in a moment was within the gar- ret. The sunshine streamed in through the dilapi- dated roo and revaled a sickening sight. Upon the bare, worm-eaten, rough and dusty floor, lay the mother, a single tattered garment only half-cov- ering her wasted foez. A little purple naked baby lay cuddled in her arms, tugging away at the skinny ,a uaid uhe rmSU9   80       WINE OR WATER. breast and moaning piteously. Across her knees lay a child of two years, its head and feet resting on the boards .and its little stomach pressed closely to her flesh. Two other children, twins apparently, were crouching in a sunny circle and crying earnest- ly, "DET up, mudder, det up and det sum bakefas; we so hundry." The children, as well as the baby, were entirely naked.  What Isabel felt may be guessed, but it was no time to give way to, her feelings. Life and death were in her hands. "Has he come," murmured the mother, half-lift- ing her head and then dropping; it again on the pillowless floor. Isabel took her hand and fixed her eyes steadily , on the fast-glazing ones of the starving creature. "He has not," she said, kindly, " but don't worry. Keep up courage a few minutes longer and you and the children shall have plenty to eat. Remember now, only a few minutes," and pressing the thin fingers, she hurried down the stairs and out of the alley. A police officer was passing by. She grasped his arm. "Is there a baker's shop near by,-a family are starving in that garret," There was no mistak- ing her words, and replying hastily, "Yes, a few steps around the corner," he led her thither. "Make me a pitcher of tea," she exclaimed to the baker's wife, " and I will pay you any price.   TilE BROKEN VOW.

They will come soon, -too, and take us all to heaven--to  heaven," and her voice died to a whisper, " where they are never hungry and never cold or tired, and  where they never sell rum either. No, never sel  2um--never sell um';" here she paused and her eyes closed, and the sleep of exhaustion sealed them. Handing the pitcher to Willie, the little boy who had guided her to the scene of wretchedness, she gave him a dime and sent him for milk, and then gently taking the baby from its mother's clasp, she laid it across her lap and put her finger in its mouth. It hushed its moaning noise in an instant but it was distressing to see how its blue lips clung to the white nail. Willie's steps were speedy though, and a pitcher of milk soon stood beside the trembling Isabel. Rolling up the corner of her handlerchiefshe mois- tened it and placed it in the babyfs mouth. Only  , by force could she withdraw it, so tenacious was the grasp of the famished child. "Take a spoon," said Willie, "I fed it with  water so last night."      '              ,    ,"   THE BROKEN VOWT.       83       3 She did, but it seemed as if the child would never be satisfied, screeching with all its might every time she paused I to fill the spoon from the pitcher. At length, however, its little eyelids clos- eed, and after lulling it a few moments, she wrapped it in her shawl and laid it besidt its mother. In the meanwhile, the officer had been busy striv- ing to revive the child he had taken up, again and again had he opened the white lips and poured down the warm tea. But the little throat never gurgled, and the drops trickled back from the palate and wet the still face. "He doesn't swallow at all," he said anxiously to Isabel.              i.      . She took it from his knees. "No, nor ever will," she whispered, " it is dead." "Good heavens, that it should have come to this. Turner, Turner, what have you done --how have you fallen. And yet he is not after all to blame one half as much as they who tempted him. If the rumseller could only look in here! By heavens, he shall too," ant he rushed madly down the stairs. Isabel shook in every nerve  and involuntarily' hugged the dead child to her heart. A few mo- ments and heavy footsteps were heard ascending the rickety stairs.      - "Way up here; but I shall break my neck," cried a strange voice.  "Yes, way up here. You needn't grumble. But   84       WINE Ol WATER. for you they would never have had to climb here. There, man," shoving him into the dismal hole, "see your work. See that child in that lady's arms. It's dead, DEAD, man, and you killed it. But for you, its father could have bought its bread. You are its murderer, and see, there is not a rag to cover its little corpse. Naked came it into the world and naked it goes out, and what sent it out?" and he shrieked into the man's ear, "What sends it, Henry Redman. RuM. The rum that you sold to its father." "Hush, hush, Wilkins, for the love of heaven ; I never once thought of this, never, never, so help me, God;" and great drops stood on his forehead and his eyelids shook. "Lead us not into temptation," said Isabel, sol- emnly, going to him and placing the dead child in his arms. "But for you, the wretched father of this corpse might have been a sober man and this little form full of life and loveliness. It is a fearful work that you have done - one that all your prayers and penitence can never undo again. There is blood on your hands; the blood of this little innocent, starv- ing in a land of plenty. You cannot wash it off. Only the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world can make it white again. Won't you go to him; won't you repent, won't you promise laying your stained hands on this victim's heart, this little pulseless heart, that you will sell rum no more."   THE BROKEN' VOW.       85 She looked into his eyes, her own wet with tears. It was as if an angel spoke to him, as if an angel rolled away the rock from the low springs of his heart and let the glad waters gush again. 4"I promise," he said solemnly, "I promise, though I see my own children starve before my eyes for food. Let me go now, let me shut up my shop, before 'another dram is swallowed. Stay with the lady, Wilkins. I will be back soon with a carriage. My home shall be theirs now," and he disap- peared. One by one the children, their hunger appeased, dropped off asleep, and Isabel and the officer kept watch. An hour passed and then the man returned. Taking up the dead child, he folded a white shawl tenderly about the little form, and motioning Isabel to take up the babe and Wilkins one of the children, he went down.. They followed. A close carriage stood at the entrance of the alley. Laying the corpse on one seat, he assisted Isabel in, and placing the sleeping child beside her, motioned to the driver. A long way from that squalid suburb did he drive, and when he reined in his horses, it was before a handsome house. A well-dressed lady stood in the doorway.  She ran down the steps to meet Isabel and took the baby from her, and running back, showed her up to a neat chamber. -"He has told me all, all, lady. O, thank God,     86'      WINE OR WATER.            m that you were there. I have guessed, but never knew  till now how stained was every cent he brought me; but there comes the poor wife and mother,". as another carriage drove, to the door. "My God- my God," as depositing her on the bed prepared, the husband unfolded the quilt he had wrapt about her and showed his wife the nearly naked woman, emaciated almost to a skeleton., "And I and ours have- fattened on your leanness." Draw the curtain - the picture is too sad. The next day a funeral procession left the rum- seller's house. In the first carriage rode the man whom Isabel had seen in the corner of the fence, herself and the three children. The man was sober for the first time in months, and as he glanced at the neat black suit he was now arrayed in, and saw his little ones in pretty new clothes, the pride of other days began to move his heart. The poor wife was too feeble to attend, and Isabel, the queenly, beautiful Isabel, took her place beside the husband. In the second carriage rode the rumseller and his family, and in the third, the police officer and his. By dint of the latter's efforts, the old friends of Turner, to the number of twenty, or so had been gathered together, and two by two they walked in procession. Mrs. Weldon had purchased a beautiful lot in the cemetery and furnished a neat coffin, and no stranger watching the solemn services would have   THE BROKEN YOW.        87 dreamed that the little body then laid beneath the sod, had died the day before of literal starvation. There was a moment's silence after the clergyman had returned thanks to the friends for their presence. Then the drunkard's hat was lowered from his face, and in hoarse, tremulous tones he spoke to them. "I, too, would thank you, friends. I had no right to expect you here; no right to expect any- thing but a deal coffin for my child, and a grave in Potter's field, for I have sinned against Heaven, my family, and you all. But, my friends, I go from this spot an altered man. This morning, with my hand upon my child's cold face, I took a solemn oath; here, beside its little grave, I renew that pledge. Never, never, will I touch again aught that can intoxicate. Help me, friends, to keep it; help me, for I am weak ;" sobs checked his further utterance. Isabel-placed her hand in his. "We will all help you," she said, gently. "Do not fear. Your sins shall be forgiven you." "Yes, we will all help you," said the group as with a single voice, and one by one they went up to . him and pressed his hand. It made him strong, those friendly greetings; for poor human nature needs encouragement in hours of penitence. They knew, too, his feelings, and day by day warded off temptation, and as he was of a social ;    , temperament, they never allowed an evening to pass    : without some two or three visiting his home -and  :   a engaging his mind and heart in pleasant intercourse.   - :!*I \; et  Af t,d   88       WINX OR WATER. That home! Let me describe it. A little snow white cottage, with green blinds, and roses climbing all about the porch, and a garden full of fruit and flowers. The ground floor has four rooms, a parlor, kitchen, bedroom and pantry, all neatly furnished; while above are two large airy chambers, with stain- less matting on the floor, low graceful cribs and tiny chairs. It was Marion's gift to the reformed man's wife, and with it went clothing for them all, and a sum of money sufficient to keep them from dependence for many a month. The rumseller gave him  work. Others would have done it; but he claimed it as his right. "I know him better than you all," he said. "I know his weak points and can help to strengthen them. I-e is a man of education, and needs employment that will exercise his mind intensely. I have formed a partnership with a brother in the wholesale grocery line, and Turner shall be our book-keeper." "Are you not afraid to trust him with so respon- sible a situation," said one. "Not a whit. Turner is sensitive  Trust him  and he will be all you wish. Distrust him and he feels abased. Believe me, friend, it is fearing to' ^, trust him that keeps many a sinner in the downward path. Make a man believe that -you respect him, and he will be almost sureto be worthy of respect. Treat him as a villain and'he will turn to one."   It was to call on this family that Isabel had left Marion's on the evening of which she spoke. The babe was very sick and she went down with a cor- dial she had herself steeped that day. She found it worse, and anxious to test her medicine, tarried with it till after nine o'clock. Mr. Turner had told his wife he should not be home till near midnight, as they were very busy at the store, so, when the babe grew  easy, Isabel started alone for home. She felt no fears, for it was a moonlight night, and as she passed rapidly along the quiet streets, rather enjoyed-the walk. Suddenly boisterous sounds met her ear. She shuddered, and would have turned into another street, but before she could, the door of a low dram Islrop was thrown open, and a party of rolicking young men rushed out. Involuntarily she stepped aside and ran up to the stoop of the nearest dwelling house. They gave a loud halloa as they passed her, and saluted her with epithets that crimsoned her before white cheeks. She started to run, when suddenly one of the group darted towards her, exclaiming, "lt's my', own lady-love, my own Isabel, queen of hearts! Come along, birdie fair!" and seizing the strug- gling girl, he made the night air ring far and wide with that too often desecrated air of Moore's, O, come to the bower I've shaded for you, And your bed shall be roses bespangled with dew."   VV       WIN WUN VV A U 1iSA L.  "Hush up, Frank,"  cried one of his companions, who seemed to have yet a little sense left; "the police will be after us. Let the girl go. Come, don't be a fool. Well, go it then, if you will, and run your own peril. You always would risk a watch-house for a pretty girl," and, with his hands in his pockets he sauntered after the group. "Come, bonnie lassie, come, and the drunken fellow clasped the frightened girl yet closer. "O, come to the bower I've shaded for you."   "Let me go," she" cried .sternly, and with a des- perate struggle freed herself. "Stop," as he reach- ed again to clasp her. ".Stop and look: at me. Frank Seymour, it is Isabel Ashey, your betrothed bride, who stands before you and upbraids you with your broken vow. O, Frank, Frank, that after all your promises, your promises beside the corpse of Marion's husband, you should havy used me so. It is too much, too much; my heart is breaking," and like a frightened deer she sped away. Enough of sense remained to tell the servants she was ill, but how she spent the night none ever knew. A week elapsed before her betrothed called to see her .." Miss Ashey is very ill," said the servant who answered the bell. "Ill," and his face flushed with his week of sin, turned pale as death. ' Too ill to see me." "Yes, sir. She is confined to her bed, has a nurse and watchers."  "When was she taken down? " "A week ago to-day." "A week ago to-day!   Good God!   It was hen no dream," and he reeled and leaned against lhe wall to keep from falling. "Can I see Mrs. Weldon?" he asked at length vith a husky voice. "She receives no company now. Her time is all spent with Miss Ashey." Drawing his hat low over his forehead, the dis- tressed man started for his hotel on a mad run. Locking the door of his parlor, he paced the floor for hours in an agony that may be guessedi but never told. All was plain to him. He had not dreamed--that strange encounter in the street was not a vision of his wine-red eyes. ie had exposed himself to the only woman he had ever truly loved, nay more, insulteda her. And she - would she for- give him. Aye, for with all her glorious, queenly beauty, she had an angel's heart. But would she forget-could she. No,- NO. He moaned the syl- lables. Between her and him a gulf was opened, a. gulf which love itself could never bridge. Late in the day he addressed a note to Marion. -/ Its pathos moved her gentle nature, and she return- ed an answer, saying she would see him that same evening. "How is she? '; he gasped out, clasping Ma- rion's hand. o       U:       WINE OR WYATER.             I "Sit down, Frank," she said in tones that were full of sorrow. "I have much to say to you." And she told him all she' knew of Isabel's illness and how terrible a one it was. "She has not yet known one of us. When she speaks at all, it is to rave wildly of her bridal morn. Frank," and she laid her hand upon his arm, "Frank, there is a fear- ful mystery about it 1Al. Can you solve it - I do not dare to." How liK daggers were her solemn A words h "Yes, -Marion," he said at length, " she is another victim--my broken vow has done it all. O, Marion, can't she live? won't she live, live to forgive me, live to bless me." And in a low, sobbing voice, he told of his recreant faith, how that maddened" with a thirst for wine, he had left his hotel to take a steamboat to New York, meaning there to indulge himself, till, satiated with the tempting draughts, he could come home a sober man,-that while waiting for the boat, he had been met by a group of gay young friends and urged to step into a neighboring bar-room and take a parting glass - that ashamed to refuse, he had done so, and from that hour for five 'days lived as in a dream- the dumb, sad dream of the debaucher. "Come, please come," cied a servant, as they sat there in silence, for Marion knew not what to say, when he hadi finished his fearful story, she is worse and the nurse is so frightened."    Marion ranup the staircase, and close on behind her went Frank Seymour. A pale, ghostly figure sat up in the bed, tearing her garments to ribbons and twining the loose, ravelling shreds about her dark hair, singing the while a gipsy-like strain. As her eyes fell on her lover, a gleam of in- telligence rippled for an instant in the large, brilliant orbs, and shrieking out madly, "help, help," she buried her head in the pillows and went into spasms. . A terrible night followed and morning found her in the weakness of death, A light sleep touched i her dyelids and the watchers stood by with hushed breathings. Hours passed with no change, hours       e that seemed days, pure days in length. The sun was just setting when she opened her eyes. Frank moved noiselessly out of her sight, and clung to the head-board with a nervous grasp. Her lips, her thin, pale lips, moved as though she would speak. Marion bent her head to the pillow. "Send for him," she murmured in her own sweet, musical voice; Her friend stepped aside and gave place to the lover. She put out her hand, her white, wasted hand, and laid it in his. 6' I forgive, and in heaven will try to forget - meet me there - there, where they neither marry nor are given in marriage. The last words were breathed rather than spoken.   "      WINE OR WATER. Frank stooped down and laid his face close to her   cheeks. She did not turn them away. He pressed his lips to her's. She gave back the kiss. He fold- ed her to his heart, held her there a moment and then laid her back tenderly, reverently on the pil- low. She was dead. "Dead, and I have killed her," he shrieked, as they led him away. On the day she was to have been a bride, they buried her. Like a bride she looked, only too pale, for they robed her in the laces and satin she was toI have worn, twined an orange wreath in her braided hair and placed a japonica in her folded- hands, and instead of a pall, covered her caffin with a bridal veil. There were many mourners in the funeral train, the friends of her early childhood and her lovely maiden-life, the young widow to whom she had been as a sister, the young pastor whose heart had yearned towards her from boyhood, the man whom she had rescued from the degradation of drunken- ness, the family whom she had brought from sorrow to joy, he who had measured out damnation and repented in sackcloth and ashes, and the innocent one whom he had fed with the rum-stained gold. All who loved her in life were there, all save one, and he, her lover, her promised bridegroom, he lay stretched upon the flower-buds of his parlor carpet too drunk to lift his head!

"It is not warm here, Essie; the old elm shades the door yard nicely, and this bank of turf feels like velvet to my feet, and the wind blows up cool and fresh from the river. Let me stand here a little     a while and watch you sew. I've something to tell you, Essie," and the bright blood mounted to her forehead, "something that I can tell better out here, half-hidden by the vines, than I could, face to. face in the house. Can't you guess what it is?" and the light flush deepened to scarlet.          i An arch look quivered in Esther's soft, dark eyes, as she looked up at the sweet face, lovelier than ever   : with the cypress wreathing its delicate contour with its graceful sprays, and the crimson stars -  - gleaning like rubies amidst the tangling curls.  "Yes, pet, I can guess, but I'd rather you'd tell B,    ,     . * e '   98       WINE OR WxATER. me," then, seeing the vain attempts which Mary made to speak, she said quietly, as though she had long expected such tidings, " it is of Aleck you would tell me. You have set your wedding day." The fair face was withdrawn, and the parted vines sprang together again and drooped like a veil between the two girls. "You've guessed right, Essie," speaking softly from the other side of the cypress. ' We are to be married on the third of next month, his and my birth day, and I Plant you to be my bridesmaid. You must not refuse me now, for I .have always counted on you. Poor Belle had promised me she would be over, and so had Marion, too; how little did I think that when the day came, one would be lying in the quiet grave, iand the other wandering over the world with a widowed heart. Isn't it dreadful to think of, Essie; two years ago and we three were so happy with our lov,ers, and now only I am left here. Who would have thought Weldon and Seymour would have turned out as they did. Why, Essie, they say Frank is never sober any more. Father met him only last week when he was up to the city, and he said he scarcely knew him, he was so haggard and looked so like a beggar. He had to send in his resignation to his regiment months ago, to save the disgrace of a dismissal, and his for- tune, it was immense, you know, is already more than half squandered. Poor Belle, what a life she   MARY'S WARNINGS.       99 would have led had they married before she dis- covered that he had broken his vows ;" tears were streaming down the face so lately flushed with maiden joy. "6 She was indeed spared many sorrows," said Esther, in a low, tender tone, " many, many. Bet- ter to go down to the grave as did she, with her heart; rent in twain by a single blow, than to have lived for years a drunkard's wife. Mary, Mary,', and she clasped, nay, clenched the two white hands that lay on the window-sill, " let Isabel's and Ma- rion's fate be a warning to you, my precious one. Don't, even now, though your bridal day is set, don't marry Aleck Parkman till he has pledged him- self never, never, to touch the intoxicating cup. Will you promise, Mary," and she pushed! aside the foliage and flowers and looked with all her soul into Mary's face. For a moment an angry light fluttered in the blue eyes, for to Mary her affianced was something more than mortal, a being pure and perfect, who stood halfway between her and heaven. But she knew Esther loved her far too well to have spoken lightly on a theme so solemn, and the momentary flush was followed by a gentle sadness. "You do not know Aleck as I do, Essie, or you would not ask this of me," she said in a voice (tha struggled to be calm. She paused a few moments ardd then said, proud- *.

Never, never," and she repeated the word as though there was com- fort in its sound. "If he touches it at all, Mary, he is not safe," said Esther, firmly. "Not safe to marry--no, no," and a look of agony passed over her pale features. They were both silent for a long time and only the low murmur of the summer wind, and the drowsy hum of the busy bees, disturbed the quiet of the room and garden. :Esther spoke at last. It was evidently with an effort, for her lips quivered as when one is in mental pain, and tears lay heavy on her cheeks. "Come in, Mary, and sit down here awhile. I will get an early tea and put grandpa to bed, and then we will have a walk toogether. And then, Mary," -her voice faltered--" then I will tell you why I spoke to you just now as I did-the mystery about us, which you have ever spkindly and deli- cately respected, shall be cleared up. You will for- give me, then, I know, for you will feel that my words come from my heart. Come, now," and going to a side door, she passed out and round to the bank where Mary yet stood. Passing her arm tenderly about her waist, she led her in and seated her in a low rocker, and then, much as a mother    MARY'S WARNINGS.       101 : would, she drew the lovely face to her heart, held' it a moment and then pressed a fervent kiss on its cheeks and lips. During the half hour that Esther was absent in the little kitchen of the cottage, Mary sat perfectly still, her face shaded with her hands. The words of her friend, " if he touches it at all, he is not safe," had made a deep impression on her mind. She could not easily forget them. 'Was Aleck really in any danger? Did a cloud hover in her sunny future? She asked the questions again and again of herself; asked them and answered' them; answered them by her hopes, rather than her reason; by her heart rather than her head; an- swered them and yet was not satisfied. "Come, now, Mary; let us go for grandpa; he is always glad to see you," and linking their arms together, they passed out of the back porch and down a long, gravelled walk, bordered on each side with flowering shrubs and rare and beautiful an- nuals. Two old elms were growing at its foot, their graceful boughs so closely interlaced that only sparkles of sunbeams ever drifted through them on to the vine-draped arbor that arched itself between the two mossy trunks. Just beyond, a tiny brook went murmuring over its pebbly bed, and thus flow- : ing into a broad, deep stream, a few yards below, rippled on with added. music to its tones, till its clear waters dashed over the jetting rocks of the river-bank, and mingled its wild waves with the calm deep current of the Connecticut. !        , .   102      WINE OR WATER. "He's asleep," whispered Mary, and she gazed reverently at the white-haired, decrepit old man who lay extended upon a rustic bench. "Not so, little friend; only dreaming to the music of the wind and waterfall. How do you do now well and happy." She lifted his right arm, a shrivelled thing, shak- ing with palsy, and pressed her lips dutifully on the thin, bony fingers. "Very well, grandpa, and happy as a spring bird. And how do you do, sir." ' Well as I can expect to be, dear, and happy, too, thanks to Essie. The precious child is i very angel to me, and yet I've blasted her young life, blighted her young hopes, poor thing "- and he looked tenderly at her. ("Tea is ready, grandpa," said she cheerily, " all ready and waiting. I have got it early that I may walk awhile with Mary. Come, let me help you," and as though he were a child, she lifted the wasted form into a low, softly cushioned carriage that was drawn up in the shade, and disposed an extra pillow or two, so that he could not possibly receive ajar. "Come, Mary, take hold; he will have a fine ride to-night--two pretty girls to draw him," and warb- ling a sweet song, they drew him carefully up the path and close to the porch. An arm-chair was waiting for him here, into which they helped him and then rolled it to the little round table, I   MAERY'S WARNINGS.      103 Esther spread his bread and cut it into thin strips upon his plate, while Mary poured his tea into a saucer, and both waited patiently beside him till his meal was finished. Then they drew him back again into the porch, and while one flled his pipe, the other brought a blazing coal to light it. They stood there till the thin, white smoke curled all about his head, and then went again to the table and partook of their own frugal supper, milk-white bread, golden,butter, and blackberries fresh that morning from a dim nook in the woodland. Then the dishes were washed up and put away; the old man's pipe taken from hinm and laid on the mantle-shelf, and he drawn quietly into a little bed- room, opening from the parlor. The door was closed upon Mary for a few mo- ments ; then Esther opened it and said "come," and joining their hands, the two young girls knelt down beside the old-fashioned tented bed and breathed out in reverent tones that holiest of prayers, "Our Father which art in heaven." Then they kissed him and were blessed in broken tones, and then they sat down in the next room and sung an evening hymn; sung it three times and then paused, the measured breathing of the old man telling them he was asleep. "We will go down to the old log beside the falls, Mary. It is lovely there at this hour, with the sun- set crimsoning the spray and arching the old trees on each side with golden bows."   104      'WINE OR WATER. A few minutes walk brouolht them there and seat- ing themselves, they listened in silence to the music of the falling stream. "Three years ago, we came here, Mary," Esther began, speaking with a visible effort; " came and took possession of that old cottage, which your father said was only fit for owls to roost in. Nobody knew where we came from, and whenl we were asked we gave no answers. The neighbors thought, I know not what, but they soon ceased to visit us and we have been left alone, save for the compan- ionship of your family. You have all respected our secret, and left us to the quiet that we evidently sought when we made our home in this lovely spot. To-night I am going to tell you why we camehere, Mary; going to tell you what I thought should never pass -my lips; going to tell of a parent's shame; a brother's sin." She pressed her heart convulsively and her lips grew pallid. "Don't," said Mary, pityingly. "It matters not why you came here. I know you are pure and good - a very angel - let the past be for- gotten.'" "Only because of the lesson it will teach you, do I unfold these dark pages in our story. Listen to them, dear, and be warned while your fate is yet in your own hands. "My grandfather, that poor, old, decrepit man you saw me care for to-night, one half of him already-   MARY'S VARNINGS.       105 dead, was one of the princely merchants of a New England city. I have a portrait of him which I will sometime show you, though you will hardly believe that the tall, majestic, noble looking man you see represented in it, was the original of him who now wears away his days in a sort of second childhood. He married young, and his wife dying after two happy years of wedlock, was spared many a pang. She left him one child only, a son, a baby of three months.  O, if she had only lived, how different might things have been. But my poor father never knew a mother's gentle care or a mother's holy in- fluence. He grew up as do the sons of rich men usually, virtue and vice strangely blending in their character. Of one sin he was guiltless though for years; he never drank. Grandfather was like all men of those times, a moderate drinker, and prided himself on his rare wines and costly brandies, im- ported by himself at a ruinous expense. But my father while a boy could never be induced to swal- low a drop of any spirituous liquor. From his mother he inherited a distaste for it, and though grandpa would dilute it, and sweeten it, and spice it never so much, he always turned away from it with a loathing stomach. When at the age of sixteen he left home for college, he was guiltless of ever having swallowed a drop of any intoxicating beverage. But sensitive to ridicule, there the jars and scoffs of his gay associates did what the persuasions of his   106      WINE OR WATER. father had failed to effect. He learned to drink; to overcome his dislike. . It was a long and tedious process though. He was obliged to begin with the lighter wines and even to weaken them and drop opiates in the glass to prevent his stomach from rebellion; but it was only the first -step that cost. Once habituated to them, it was comparatively an easy matter to swallow the heavier kinds, and from them the transit to stronger drink was a natural one. My grandfather was delighted with the change in him, for the boy's abstemiousness had always been a tacit reproof to his own tastes. Im-; mediately upon his permanent return, he had made a duplicate key of his private cellar, where his rarest and oldest vintages and liquors were concealed and which no domestic was ever allowed to enter. This he gave to his son. Alas! poor grandpa; I guess he has often since wished that he had, instead, thrown his own into the depths of the ocean and masoned up the door. My father, after a European tour, something unusual in those days, and something which only a millionaire's son might hope to enjoy, settled down into mercantile pursuits, my grandfather relinquish- ing his own place in the firm to him, and bestowing on him, too, as a capital, one half his own princely fortune. In a year or two- the young merchant married. I dare not trust myself to tell you of my mother. Though I was but seven years old when 1,   MARY S WARNINGS.       107 I  she passed away, my memories of her are perfectly i  distinct, and when I think of her, it is as though I communed with an angel fresh from heaven." Esther's eyes filled, and her voice faltered. Mary pressed her hand affectionately and imprinted on it soft, silent kisses. "Things prospered with my father for awhile, and his home was a beautiful and happy one. Little children were given to him, and their tender, cling- incg arms shielded him from many a temptation. But trouble come at last, as it does sooner or later to all humanity. He became engrossed in rash and ex- pensive speculations, and failihg to realize his antici- pations, strove to drown his disappointment in the oblivion of drink, and to retrieve his necessities by the twin vice of gambling. From thence his ruin dated; nay, I am wrong. It dated from the hour he first compelled his loathing stomach to retain a glass of wine. From thence his course was down- ward, downward, till .he sunk deep, deep into the abyss of crime. At my birth he was a confirmed drunkard, a very sot, the sight of whom made his wife tremble, and .his children flee away in horror. One by one the latter passed away; taken in mercy from the evil days 'to come. At last there only remained Robert, the eldest son, and myself, between whom there was a difference of sixteen years. Such sights, Mary, as my baby eyes were each day com- pelled to look upon! I shudder even now, only to   108      WINE OR WATTER. remember them. I cannot speak of them. They are too terrible. Only a drunkard's child, one who has seen her father stagger home day and day, mad with drink, can guess at what we suffered. "One day, it was my seventh birth day, I remem- ber, I had passed hours in my mother's chamber. She was too feeble to leave it any more, far gone, the doctors said, in a slow consumption. I believed them then, but I know better now. She was dying of a broken heart. She had been worse than usual in the morning, one fainting fit following another in such rapid succession, that it seemed as though the thread of life was surely parting. Not until after- noon did her physician dare to leave her, and then he gave positive injunctions to her attendants to keep her, quiet, saying that her very existence de- pended upon repose. I can see now just how she looked as she lay there in motionless beauty on the bed, the folds of her white wrapper falling over her like graceful drapery on a snow-white statue. Her face, wasted as it was, wore yet a touching loveliness, while her thin hand, through whose transparent skin the blue veins quivered, was like Parian mar- ble. She was white as death, save that upon each cheek there burned a single crimson spot, not larger than the petal of a rose. At her couch, I sat alone with her. She held my little fingers in her own, and I felt she prayed long and fervently for me, her little one born in the dairkness of her life. By-and-   MARY S WARNINGS.      109 by she whispered, "sing to me, Essie; sing me to sleep." I began a simple, childish ballad. Her eyes closed, and before I had finished, she was in a quiet slumber. I watched her awhile and then remembering she had eaten nothing all day, I thought I would go out into the garden and pick some strawherries for her. How well I remember that afternoon; how beautiful everything out of doors looked to me, after my close confinement in that still, darkened chamber. I can see as in a picture, the old elm tree under whose shadows I sat down; I can feel as though my form pressed it now, the soft, green turf upon which I threw myself and sobbetl. Young as I was, I knew my mothes's days were numbered, and O, life looked so desolate to-me without her protecting care. I wept, till from weariness my eyes refused another tear; then hiding them with my hands, I laid my aching head 'upon the mossy roots of the old tree. Sunbeams and bird songs, flowers and fruits mingled awhile with my dozing thoughts, and then I slept. The south -wind sung a low, cradle hymn as it fluttered in the boughs of the old tree, and its lullaby music stilled me when I stirred, and brought me pleasant dreams. It was near sunset before I awoke. My first thought was of my mother, and picking up the glass saucer I had brought out with me, I hurried to the straw- berry bed: It was a large land thrifty one, and my busy fingers soon piled the' scarlet berries high in   "O      WINE OR WATER. my dish. Roses and, pansies were in their prime, and gathering a handful of etch, strewed them over the fruit, and hurried in with my pretty gift. "Mary, Mary, guess what I saw I "My mother leaning against the wall, every par- tide of color gone from her face, which was agonized with dread, and wet with falling tears, and my father, furious with drink, standing beside her with uplifted arms. "Don't strike me, Robert, she wailed, rather than shrieked; don't, don't; I am dying now. "Mary, Mary; he did strike her, and the purple print of his heavy fingers was plain upon her face and bosom when she lay shrouded in her coffin. Yes, he struck her, once, twice, three times; struck her, till my nurse flung herself between them, and called on the servants to bind his hands. "That night my mother died. "An hour before she passed away, she called me to her. They placed me on the bed beside her. I laid my face upon her pillow close, O, how close to hers. She took my hands within her own and pressed her lips to mine in kisses: She had been very weak and her voice was broken with faintness. But a fresh strength seemed given her, for she spoke to me now in audible tones. ; Essie, I am dying, and sorrow has brought me here. Essie, as you love your mother, as you cherish her memory, never, never, my child, marry a man who even   MARYS WARNINGS.    1 tastes of the intoxicating cup. Promise .me, my child. I cannot die easy till I feel that you -are safe from the heart-crushing trials that have blighted my own life.' "Mary, I promised my mother then and there. - She seemed  relieved and lay for awhile in silence. Then she whispered, "Essie, he is your father yet -do not desert him - and your brother, O, if he would but come before I go-surely a mother's dying wish would save him; Essie, he is treading in his father's steps - be to him mother as well as sister." Her voice failed her lhere and they thought she had passed away; but once again her breath was quickened and she murmured on my cheek, "a little child may lead them--Essie, ba that child." And once again, strength came and she whispered, " tell him, I forgive, forgive; I blesa him, him, and Robert and you, pet lamb." "I went to sleep with my face to hers. When I awoke, my mother was no more. "On the night succeeding her funeral my father disappeared. It was thought at first that remorse had driven him to suicide. But instead there was fresh shame for us. Check after check was handed to my grandfather by the banks in which his money was deposited. They were each signed with his name, but the signature had been penned by another than his trembling hand. They were forgeries, and my father was the criminal. But not   "2      WINE OR WATER. by word -or look did the unhappy man give testimony against his son, and the matter dropped in silence. "My grandfather's home became my! own, and when my brother returned from his travels, he, too, found a warm welcome there, and when two years later he brought thither a young, fair bride, we made place for her, too, at the fireside, and for a time forgot our griefs. "Only for a time though, for my brother's face soon showed marks of dissipation, and night after night found him absent. My grandfather, long since thoroughly awakened to a sense of the danger of even tampering with intemperance, remonstrated firmly and kindly; the young wife wept and plead, and myself, though yet only a child in my early teens, reasoned and prayed. But all in vain. He went on and on, till we shuddered to hear his staggering step. "One day, O, its memory makes me ever dread the autumn, I sat at the window working. It was a cold, damp afternoon, the chill, grey frogs of November just beginning to lift themselves over the city. I seemed to feel them in my very heart, so damp and frosty. I was alone. Grandpa was ill in his own room, and my sister-in-law up stairs. I was working upon a tiny garment, a delicate cam- bric slip, which I had taken from Carrie's basket, and which I knew she had no heart to finish. I sewed till the evening began to close in, so dull,   DARY'S WARNINGS.       113 dark and ghostlike that I fairly shivered, though the fire in the grate burned bright and warm. My work dropped at last from my chilled fingers, and I sat and watched the dying daylight till it melted into long, black shadows. "The room was very still, so still that I could hear the frightened throbbings of my heart, for I was frightened with a dread presentiment and mysterious shadows of evil seemed flitting all about me. I had no courage to rise and ring for lights, but kept watching the door, in hopes some one of the servants would come in. Suddenly I heard a faint cry. I could not distinguish clearly where it came from, and began to fancy it was the echo of my wild imaginings, when it was repeated, and this time with starling distinctness. Again and again I heard it, till at length it rung out in a shriek so fear- ful that the very servants in the kitchen heard it and came tremblingly up to me. The s6unds of human footsteps roused me, and naturally courage- ous, I was the first there. to run up stairs. Low moans met my ears as I passed Carrie's room. I turned the knob to go in. The door was locked. I called. Only those low moans answered me. I bade the waiter burst open the door. He kicked his foot against a panel, and as it gave way I crawled through the aperture. My sister-in-law lay prostrate on the floor. I spoke to her. No answer, but those low moans. I called her by all   i 114     WINE OR WATER. the pet names I could think of, called passionately, clasping her to my heart as I did so. Once the two white arms were strained about my neck, then they dropped, and by the dew upon her face, the cold, clammy dew, I knew that she was dead. "I did not faint, I did not weep, I seemed trans- ferred at once into a woman, a woman with a heart petrified to grief. I calmly ordered our old physician called, and helped nurse and the maid to lay her on the bed and straighten her disordered clothes. A closet door was opened. I looked in. Crouched in a corner was a form I felt at once to be my brother's, though I had believed him in a distant city. The closet had a window. It opened on the roof of a piazza, and an 'agile form could easily descend from it to the ground. I raised the sash, and taking hold of the quivering fingers, led him to it and muttered hoarsely,' fly.' "The doctor came; what he thought I never knew, but he said that she died in a fit, and his ver- dict went forth to the world, and many a sym- pathizing tear fell for the young husband. "I helped old nurse to lay her out, locking the door upon all others. I told the neighbors, who remonstrated with me, that it was Carrie's wish, long ago expressed. There I spoke the truth. Ac- customed to abuse for months from Robert in his drunken hours, she had a wife's pride in desiring to conceal forever from the world the livid marks that   MARY'S WARNINGS.       115 disfigured her delicate form. As we disrobed her and turned her gently on her back, we saw plainly just beneath her heart three deep bruises; fresh ones we knew they were by their vivid crimson color. We looked into each other's eyes, but spoke not, though each in our secret heart knew they were the terrible marks of murder. We dressed her in the pure white satin robe she had worn on her -wedding morn, and about her waxen neck and arms fell the same soft, rich laces that had decked her then. A wreath of orange buds and blossoms was twined within her curls, and a white rose, half-open- ed, placed within her fingers. Her wedding ring, a pure and costly pearl, was left untouched. Then, when all was finished, I threw over her, her bridal veil. "I watched her myself that night. I would not trust another, lest the dread secret should be guess- ed. At noon, a carriage drove to the door. Pale and haggard did Robert look as he descended. With tearful eyes the servants motioned him to the parlor, not daring to trust their voices. ' Then they came to the chamber of death and told me he had come, and said with white lips, " fou must tell him; we cannot."  "Calmly as I had done all else, I walked down stairs and passed into the room where he yet stood. 'Come,' said I, looking him sternly in the eye. He took my extended hand and I led him to his wife, his fair, dead wife.   C  116      WINE OR WATER. "Look at her," I said, lifting the cloud-like veil. Two years ago, she wore this dress, a young and happy bride. Now she wears it, a murdered wife. 4"IN   Yes, murdered, I said almost fiercely, and by a hus- band's blows. Look at her. Look at her. Look at that ring upon her finger. Who put it there? Who? You. You, Robert-and you killed her. "Spare me, Essie, spare me, he cried. It was a low, plaintive cry; such a one as a child utters when its little heart is breaking. "Spare you - did you spare her. Yes, I will spare you, but not because you ask it. No. No. But because of the promise I made my dying mother seven years ago. "Robert, I have your secret. One other, our old nurse, has it, too. But it is safe with us on one condition. "I lifted the cold hand of the corpse, the hand that wore the ring and placed it in his. He shiver- ed froim head to foot and looked at me pleadingly. I did not heed him. I knew if I did, I sealed his ruin. "Promise, promise, by the memory of your angel mother, by the love you bore your bride, by the pulseless heart of your unborn baby, that you will never, never, NEVER touch again anything that can intoxicate. 6 I promise; help me God." s I slipped the ring from the stiff finger and   I           I MARY'S WARNINGS.     117 placed it on one of his, one almost as cold as hers. That seals your vow, I said, and then led him to, to my own chamber and bade him go to bed. He did so, and never rose from it, but to follow his vic- tim to the tomb. "Through the weeks of delirium that followed, nurse and I tended him alone, and to this day no one, unless it be our old physician, knows the secret. / Thank Heaven; it was unpremeditated murder. He had gambled away his last cent and was deeply in debt. He had stolen home secretly to coax his wife to ask grandpa for money to defray it. He dared not ask himself, for the heart-broken old man had declared he would never pay another. He had al- ready, it seemed, plead with her at different times, till she had given him her watch and chain and jewels, all but that wedding ring. "She refused now to do his bidding on the plea that grandpa was too ill to be disturbed. I will kill you, if you don't, he whispered. She was easily frightened, he knew, and he thought a threat would be enough. But her love for the old man, pale and sick on his bed, was stronger this time than fear, and she refused again and again, till in his mad- ness he raised his foot And struck the heavy heel of his travelling boot deep in her quivering flesh. Her fall sobered him, and unable to fly, he hid him- self in the little closet. "Before death came, his reason returned to him, *  , i   "8      WINE OR WATER. and I believe he repented sincerely of his crime; -I believe the blood-stains of his scul were washed away; I believe he died at peace with God and man. "Two years after his death, I was returning home one evening from a call upon a poor widow, when I felt something touch my dress. I turned hastily. A beggar was kneeling beside me. He lifted his face as I spoke, asking his wants. Years had passed since I had seen that face ; nine years, and I was but a child of seven when I last looked upon it; but I knew it, knew it even in the gathering darkness. "Mary, Mary, it was my father. "My father in rags and wretchedness. "We took him in, grandpa and I, that no curious eye might look upon him. He was too weak to tell his story, but we knew his sin had brought its own punishment with it, and we forgave him all. He was ill for a long while; then his disease passed off, and a gentle lunacy settled gradually over Iis mind. I guarded him myself, until four years ago. Then grandpa had a stroke of palsy, and our old physician said I must leave my father and tend to him, for he knew me yet, and my presence would be a comfort to him, while to my father all nurses were alike. "Grandpa's fortune was nearly all gone then, and it became a study-with him and me how to make the most of it. An annuity was purchased for my poor maniac father, one which ensured him a pleasant   MARY'S WARNINGS.       119 room in one of our best hospitals, and the constant care of a good nurse. With the remnant of our money, we purchased this lonely home and here we have dwelt since. Four times a year I go to see my father; but he does not know me, and perhaps never will again. I shall stay with grandpa till he dies; then I shall take the place of the kind matron who nurses the bereft one, and stay with him till he, too, passes away." "And then, Essie, then you shall come to me and be ever a sister," and Mary clasped her friend close to her heart. 'I look not so far into the future, Mary," she said, calmly, I will not say life has no joys for me, for I feel each day it has. In our duties there is joy, if we but perform them with a willing spirit; if we but consecrate our lives to them. What is before me, yet God only knoweth. I do not ask. I am content to accept life as it comes." They walked away in silence. At the diverging paths where they were to part, Esther drew Mary to her side and pressed a kiss upon her lips, mur- muring, "I know my sad secrets are safe with you. Let them be warnings, darling, warnings to spare your young heart the woes that my mother felt be- fore me, that I have felt all my life." .D   - CHAPTER V. "PLEASANT VIEW." ARY IRVING  passed a house on her return from the cottage, but wandered about the garden and door-yard, and now and then, groped her way through the purple sladows that hung heavily over the underbrush of the adjoining woodland. Everything looked dark and cheerless to her. i Thoughts of poor Ma- rion with her yet unburied memories; of dead Isabel with her broken heart; of gentle Essie with her mournful mission; of Aleckl, dearer than life it- self, yet trembling on the quicksands of destruction; all these blended in a fearful whole, and made the color run from her cheeks, till her face was white as death.   PLEASANT VIEW.       121 The voice of her mother calling earnestly, "Mary; child; Mary," -roused her from the painful mood' into which she had fallen, and she turned her steps to the porch, clasping her hands together, so firmly that the slender fingers seemed joined. Mrs. Irvin screamed, as the candle she held flash- ed its vivid rays upon her daughter's countenance, so like a snow-bank in its hue. "What ails you, child? tell me ; where have you- been; are you sick; why didn't you come in at once, the dews' have wet you through." "Don't be frightened, mother." She gasped the words with an effort that brought a faint flush to her cheeks. "I am not sick; not in the least; but I have heard a sad story this afternoon, and it has freshened all my old sorrows. I think I will go to bed and try to sleep off the heaviness of my heart," and she took up the candle her mother had just' set down.  "I would, dear; there's nothing like a s8ound night's rest for every trouble." "And here is something to quiet your nerves, little puss ; I'll warrant it'll be better than laudanum: or valerian," and the loving old father patted her glossy head  and thrust a tiny note in her cold hands. Her eyes brightened as she glanced at the super- scription, and a beautiful color crept up the veins of her cheeks, a sweet rose hue, such as blossoms up   122      WINE OR WATER. from the summer days of the heart. With a smile upon the now crimson lips, she kissed the two aged ones, whose one ewe lamb she was, and ran lightly up the old stair-case, the refrain of her evening hymn stealing down to them as a breath of music from an angelic voice. But no sooner had she reached her own room -than the glow faded from her face, and the light went out from her eyes. She put down the candle upon the high, old-fashioned mantle, and gazed wist- fully about her. It was a large, pleasant,: airy chamber, the south- east one, its front windows looking through the tops of the trees on to the beautiful river, the blue Con- necticut, that washel. with such a low, soft swell, the gravelled margin of High Bank, while its side one opened upon the fair old garden, which it was Mary's joy to keep ever radiant with flowers. An old elm grew near the corner of the house, and its long, graceful branches drooped so near the case- ments, that the young girl could reach them with her hand, while she often lay awake for hours at night to listen to their musical tapping against the glass as they swayed to and fro with the passing breeze. There were robins' nests hidden in the green depths of that old tree, nests that were never disturbed, but swung idly there all winter, with the cold, snow heaped in their smooth brown cups. Birds revelled there in summer, whole broods of   PLEASANT VIEW.        123 them, for whose comfort Mary tipped the nearest twigs with bits of fleecy cotton, and scattered crumbs upon the   sills--birds that were like watches to her, waking her each morning by their sweet jubilees of song. Rose vines grew beneath the two front windows, large grape-like vines that had run clear up the clap-boards to-the eaves, and whose sprays of buds  and blossoms sunned themselves all the forenoon in the quivering light that ran through the leaves of the old elm at the corner. Morning glories, balsam apples, and cypress vines climbed up the trellis of twine which Mary had woven over the gable end of the house, making an arabeslque that was fairly bewildering with its beauty, the purple and white vase-like flowers mingling in such strange fantasies with the golden cups and the crimson stars. She gathered a bouquet for her chamber every morning from the flowers that looked in through the win- dows, a bouquet radiant as the face that lookedtack to her from the little mirror between them. She hardly knew the face now as, after pausing a moment, she turned to the little toilet table and took up the comb to smooth out her long curls.  Years of misery seemed to have passed over it, years that had crushed out its light and  joy. She looked about her.' Was it herself, Mary Irvin, the bride- elect, that stood there shivering with an untold of fear. Aye, aye! It ;was she, and this was the ^*    124      W-INE OR WATER. chamber from whence she was soon to go forth - to return no more. How beautiful it looked to her old-fashioned as it was.  Everything had  its memory, dear and precious to her. In that bed in the corner, that high, carved bed that looked for all the world like a warrior's tent, she had drawn her first breath and taken her first kiss from a father's and mother's lips. The snowy linen curtains that fell about it, were the work of that mother's hands, spun and woven and bleached by her, and so were those that draped the windows, and the netting that fringed them, and the tufted spread, and the sheets and cases, and the soft white blankets that lay in a chair beside the bed, to be on hand in case of E sudden chill. The toilet and bureau covers, the towels on the rack, yes, even the carpet on the floor, so brilliant with its stupes of green and scarlet, all were the work of that mother's hand.   What wonder the child looked wistfully at them all. he undressed and crept silently into bed, for she knew that her mother, before she had blown out the last candle, would steal on tip-toe up stairs, and come in to look at her. But a few moments and then she heard the cautious tread of the stockinged feet. She lay very still, with closed eyes and lips that counterfeited sleep. The door opened noiselessly, and the aged woman stealing in with a spirit's tread, went up to the bed     . F 14   PLEASANT VIEW.       125 and pushed aside the curtains. Shading the light, that its rays might not fall directly on the sleeper's face, she stood a long while and gazed tenderly at her - stood so long, that the daughter, unused to deception, moved uneasily, and at length opened her eyes. 6"How do you feel now, dear." The mother's voice was choked as she spoke. A few more nights and that bed would be an empty one; her child belong to another. Only those know how she felt, who have let the bird of their bosom flee off to a stranger's nest; who have seen the child that they cradled stray off to a stranger's home. "O, I an well, quite well. Iut Essie's sad story set me a-thinking. I was footish, though, to let it worry me so. I will try now, and go'right to sleep. Aleck is coming down to-morrow to go blackber- rying with me on the old mountain, and I have need of a good night's rest, for it's a hard road to climb; and, mother, I like to have forgotten it though, he says in his note, just whisper to Mrs. Irvin, that a nice broiled chicken always relishes well after such a trip." "He shall have it, darling.  I've some nice, plump, little fellows, the kind he likes, too; yellow- legged ones. Yes, puss; I'll see to it, and have a good supper all ready for you when you come home. And now go to sleep quick," and she bent her lips, first to the pure white brow, and then to the rich red lips, and stole quietly down to her own room. s.   126      WINE OR WATER,. Mary lay still till she was sure the whole house- hold was in repose. Then she slid noiselessly from her bed and went to one of the east windows, and kneeling down by it, she looked out upon the night. Everything was quiet. At the foot of the old elm, in the grass that crept lovingly over its roots, a cricket chirped away; in the dusky shadows that lay heavily among the branches, a bat now and then whirred its wings; in the far off distance, an owl occasionally hooted. These were all-all the ' sounds that broke the stillness of that August night. Mary, poor, dear Mary, with her aching head upon her hands, knelt there and listened and thought- listened and thought as the darkness wore away, and the old clock in the hall tolled the passing hours. There was a struggle going on in her young heart, the strugglethat has so often been fought in those hidden -chambers. Woman's faith and woman's fears were in close combat. The issue - alas, it is too often so --the issue, momentous with matters of life and death--was won at length by faith, the faith of the innocent. But not hastily was the victory gained, and not bloodless was it either. From that night there was a scar on that young girl's heart, a scar that oftimes grew purple.- While the conflict was at its height, just as the morning sun was mantling the eastern heavens with   *   '         PLEASANT VIEW.        127 the glow of promise, Mary, worn almost to madness, arose and went softly about the room. She seemed trying to gather up strength for the last moment of trial. It came to her apparently, for after a time she opened a drawer and took from it a little writing desk and unlocked it. "I will write it to him," she murmured, plain- tively. "I could never tell it, for iny tears would choke me so. Yes, I will write it to him; tell him just how I feel; beg of him to promise me that he will never, never again, so much as taste of wine. He will do it, I know, if I make him  promise, for his word is dear to him; dearer than life, and then I am safe, and more, he is safe 0O, to think of his being in danger; in danger of a death like Weldon's -of a life like Seymour's.   She shuddered, and great drops of agony, started to her forehead, while her cheeks were welted with fear. She looked hastily down into the open box. It was a little thing that met her eyes, but like the tiny magnet, it was alive with power. A pressed rose-bud, a moss rose bud, dried and brown, lay quietly on the   white sheet of paper. She pressed her lips to it, her quivering, pallid lips. Was their life yet in the flower?   Surely she breathed  something more than the odor of dead leaves.  Ah, yes! The summer that they held yet in their hearts, the beautiful summer of three years ago--she breathed its sweet air; felt, thrilling in every vein, its only yet half-forgotten breezes. ,                    s*   128      WINE OR WATER. 'She closed her eyes, closed them only. to see more clearly that little summer-house in the door-yard, with its rustic seat, scarcely broad enough, for two, its mossy carpet soft as from Turkey's looms, and its hangings of rose-vines, their pink and white clusters bending low with their heavy freight of per- fume. In her ear there sounded again the cheerful hum of the busy bee and the glad songs of the robins she had tended and tamed. At her feet, on the soft green mat, the. golden sunlight trembled, while above and all around her there seemed written the beautiful promises of the All-Father; they bowed as with rainbow tints the azure vault of the pure sky ; they tangled themselves in vivid ways all through the emerald green of the' woodland, and they bounded the pure waves of the river with broad lines of silver and gold. Yes, sitting there, with her lips pressed to that dead rose-bud, she saw all, heard all, and felt be- side, far down in her heart, the beating of a great and sudden joy. Then came the gathering of two buds, twin buds, whose blushing leaves were more than half hidden in delicate lines of moss. Then the exchange, when somehow, the fingers of two hands became en- tangled, and there slipped from one a circlet of pure gold, which fitted as by magic the third upon the , other's. As she seemed to feel again the soft, gliding   PLEASANT -VIEW.       129 motion of the ring, Mary started, and with a nervous motion held her hand between her and the sunlight, which now streamed through the open window in a flood of glory. How it sparkled, that tiny band of gold, that betrothal ring I "All the lovely tenderness, all the beadtiful faith of her rare womanhood was roused into vigorous life by the flash .of the sun-beams on that golden circlet. It dissipated every shadow that had lain there, the shadows that made her heart so waste and black, and left in there instead a bow of promise. With a smile upon her face, and a song upon her lips, her lips of cherry-redness now, she ran fleetly down the stairs and went about her morning duties. At the hour appointed for Aleck's visit, she re- paired to the little summer-house, their usual place of meeting in pleasant weather, and awaited his coming with all the impatience of youth. He was prompt, as lovers are ever wont to be, and his light step, springing and firm, betokened a manhood yet far fromi ts wreck, a manhood that only needed one single vow to make it forever impenetrable to the advances of its besetting sin. "My Mary!" "Aleck -dear Alecl!" How much of rapture in those few  brief words! The soul of each seemed to go out to the other as they spoke them, while their hearts sunned them- selves in that June of life as do flowers and birds in the June of summer.   1830      WINE OR WATER. "We are tarrying too long, little darling; the sun is climbing up the mountain faster than we; shan't we go now?" and he led to the porch, where a light carriage was in waiting for them. Mrs. Irvin stood at the door with a pitcher of iced milk, and by her side stood a basket filled to the brim with delicate rations from her ever abundant shelves. "I knew you would like it," she said kindly to the young man as he bounded up the steps to greet her, " it's better than wine for young folks; a good deal better to my notion, though the time was when I didn't think much about it, but was willing every- body, old and young, should drink. what they pleased;-take another glass-won't you--it can't hurt you, sweet new milk with the cream stirred in. Ah, I thought you would; isn't it good, child?" "Good, better, best," said Aleck gaily, as he drained the goblet the second time. "We must have a cow, Mary." She blushed, for although her wedding day was fixed, she could not yet hear any distinct allusion to it without being oppressed with a maiden sense of bashfulness. '"To be sure, Aleck; to be sure you must," said the kind old mother. "I have one of the gentlest cows in the world for Mary to begin housekeeping with. I raised her myself from a tiny calf; raised   PLEASANT VIEW.       181 her by hand, for she was a twin, and the old cow was an ugly beast and nearly hooked this poor thing to death. The strangest thing in the world that a mother could be so set, and love one and hate the other. But I brought the poor thing up and I've always meant it- for puss here, *cause, for all she's a farmer's daughter, she's terrible 'fraid of a cow if it's the least vicious. Have some more, Aleck - don't be scared of, it -plenty in the cellar good as this. No more--well, then you'd better be off, and mind, now, that chicken will be ready to eat at five this afternoon." "We'll be on hand, trust me for that," and he handed Mary to her seat, set in the basket and the pails, and sprang in himself, gathering up, the lines, as he did so.  It was a pleasant drive over to the foot of the mountain, the road leading through a long piece of woodland, shady and cool, and fragrant with sweet summer odors. The horse was a gentle one and knew the road well, and Aleck had only to hold the lines loosely in one hand, while his other rested con- t^  tentedly between the two softer smaller ones of j   I Mary. They spoke only occasionally--it was one of those times when silence is more eloquent than words. Now and then a snatch of music would ripple upon, Mary's lips and float in quivering echoes, through the dim aisles that stretched away beside them, and if the air was a familiar one, Aleck would.   1832      WINE OR WATER. take it up with his rich bass, and for a time the old woods be all alive with this rare melody. Then^ silence, the sweet silence of mutual love, would again seqtheir voices, save that the young girl sometimes involuntarily exclaimed, "look -how  beautiful" - as they passed a wild flower.  The path up the old mountain, as it was called to  distinguish it from the lesser ones about it, was a   i steep and laborious one, but it paid well, whether the object were berries or scenery, for the briars of  i the one tangled your steps continually, while from every ledge and shelf views of surpassing grandeur and beauty beamed upon the wondering vision.  The forenoon glided- by in rapid hours, and Mary, wearied with toiling up, up and up, was glad to rest near the summit of the mountain, under the shadows  of the old pines -Aleck had struggled on before     : her with the basket of provisions, and while she pre- pared the little pin-nic dinner, he went down again  several rods to find the spring which they had pass- ed in their ascent,. "Clear as crystal -cold as ice," he said as he set  down the dripping pail beside her. "Try it, Mary,"   : and he dipped the china mug into the sparkling  water.  "Delicious, Aleck. I feel revived already. You - drink now." "Nectar for the gods," he cried, as he drained the ' mug. Then, as he filled it again, and watched the aI r             * *i   -PLEASANT VIEW.       138 play of the sunbeams on its sparkling 'surface, he said earnestly, "I begin, Mary, to believe Fred is about right." "In what, Aleck?"  There was a quickened motion of her heart as she spoke; a little impatient fluttering, as when a great hope beats against it for admittance. "In what he .says about this, Mary," pouring drop by drop the contents of the mug upon the soft, mat-like verdure beneath their feet. "He says one- half the sorrows of this life would be averted did men and women drink water always instead of wine." ";I ought to say more, Mary," he continued after a few moments of silence, "I will say more; I don't begin to --I have always believed it; but I would not own it; no, I would not own it, and came near being myself wrecked on the strand that carried off poor Weldon, and that is fast carrying off his purer friend, the unfortunate Seymour. ' "Mary," after another pause and looking now earnestly ipto her face, "Mary, I have never tasted a drop of wine or liquor of any kind since the day I was pall-bearer to Thomas - never." She clasped his two, hands in hers and laid her pure sweet lips to his, murmuring, "I am so ,happy, so happy no w"  "Then you have feared for me, darling?" "Hardly fearedi, Aleck'; but I have been undasy   134      WINE OR WATERE - could you blame me. Marion and Isabel, my two dearest friends -" she could speak audibly -no longer. But Aleck understood her, and folding her to his heart, whispered, '"I know all you would say, darling, all, all. But you need be troubled no longer. I have seen my danger and am saved." "Bless you, Aleck, for these words. I ask no other pledge." "You need no other, Mary. Fred would have had me sign my name to one in black and white, but I scorned to be so fettered. I thank God my man- hood is strong enough to bear out my wishes with- out any such restrictions. I have been and always will be, free, free not to sin, but to be tempted and refrain." Mary's heart was like a child's that afternoon, so light, so joyous. All its fears, if fears It had, were gone, and she lived and rejoiced in the beautiful present. A few days after and she gave herself to Aleck in the solemn bands of marriage, a lovely bride, more like the pictured vision of some old Italian than a living, breathing creature, in the flush of early life. Only a few were gathered at the bridal. It was Mary's wish, and her friends respected it. Fred, now a minister of three years' standing, was Aleck's groomsman, and the gentle Essie served as brides- maid. Mary watched them closely, and had an add- ed joy as she saw the impression that fair Madonna-   PLEASANT VIEW.        135 face made upon her gifted cousin. It had long been the darling wish of her heart to bring the two to- gether. She loved Fred as she would have done the brother who went so quietly to sleep while yet a babe, and she could not bear to think of him in his loneliness, could not bear that one so well fitted as he was to enjoy the comforts of a home, should be forever deprived of them. She knew that his youth- ful love for Isabel -had so sanctified his heart that only a woman of the rarest virtues could ever fill her place. But Essie was that woman, Mary felt, and when she saw her cousin seemingly entranced at times by the sweet face and yet sweeter voice, she closed her eyes to conceal their tell-tale joy. Marion was' there, too, lovelier than ever, and whatever memories were aroused in her widowed heart by that quiet, festive scene, so like to the one in which she herself had been an actor three years before, she kept them hidden, and was cheerful, if not gay, keeping up the spirits of the aged theri and mother by telling them they should hae another daughter; she herself would take Mary's place. Mrs. Mann was going to the West to live with her only son, and' she could not and would not have the care of that great city home, but would come back and have her own little chamber in the old farm-house, and work for her board, " and you shall see," she added laughingly, if my butter and cheese don't beat your Mary's every way, and such !.,   186      WINE OR WATER. cakes and pies and bread as I will make you; why, Auntie, you may sit in your old arm-chair all day; there will be nothing left for you to do but to knit for Uncle, Mary, and Aleck, and--" she hushed her voice to a light whisper--" their little family." She did not know it, but another than the mother heard part of her talk. Her boyish lover, grown now into an able man, felt a dead weight taken from his soul as he learned that his first, his only love, was again coming to be near him. A hope, wild and vague, ruffled his heart, and when, an hour afterward, he ventured to ask her to ride to the city to-morrow with him and listened to her consent, that little new-born hope fairly screamed with extasy, and he was forced to turn away least she should see the heightened color of his face. "And yve will start early, an hour or so before the others, William," laying her hand gently on his arm, Do and then we can have the house all open and looking pleasant, and have the wedding dinner spread in style. They start at seven; but we will go at five; that is, if you can do so." "Earlier if you wish, Mrs. Weldon," he could -%  not trust himself to say more. "Nay, William; but why will you call me by that formal name. I am Marion always when I come back to my old home. I call you as I ever did; why won't you do the same by me. Come, say Marion once more; just once, to see how it seems to you."   PLEASANT VIEW.        137 "XMarion." We cannot always tell when a new love has birth; nor always when an old one is rekindled; yet from that moment the girlish-widow knew that life had yet a beauty for her. She did not stop, nor care to analyze her feelings ; she was content to know that a chord long silent had been struck again; content to listen to the soft, low music that run upon its threads.  . . "And this is our home?" It was Mary's exclamation as Aleck reined the horses in before a new and commodious cottage in the beautiful suburbs of the neighboring city. "Does it suit you, darling?" "Suit me! I am -more than suited, I am charmed. Why, it is like the country, almost? Just see that stretch of meadow-land in front-there must be acres of it, and it runs clear to the river, too. Only think, the Connecticut in full view from my door- step. And such a charming bit of forest on the south, and such a wide space between us, the neigh- bors beside us, and behind. And    the garden, Aleck; do you see the garden. Do look at those beds of asters and balsams, and see that porch covered clean to the top with cypress and morning- glories--and that urn, marble as I am alive, with  that monthly rose growing out- of it, and so full of buds, too-  it is like fairy work, and Marion is the fairy, too, I guess. Here she comes, looking like an angel as she is-" is , .L A L   138      WINE OR WATER. "Welcome, bonnie bride, and you my gallant groom- welcome to this, your home," and taking a hand of each she led them up the steps, where William stood ready to usher them into the parlor. Close behind them followed Fred and Essie, and Mr. and Mrs. Irvin, and with them came the gray-haired minister who had baptized the infant Mary twenty years before, and last night married her. As he crossed the threshold, he paused, and lifting up his hands; and raising his eyes he said solemnly, "The blessing of the Lord, our heavenly Father and of his Son, our Blessed Saviour, and of the Holy Spirit, descend and rest forever upon this young husband and his young wife, and upon the family that may in time be given to them. May it ever be the happy home that it is to-day. Amen." "Amen," they all responded, and felt that the spot was henceforth a consecrated one. "And this is the parlor," said Mary, when her emotion gave her chance to speak. "Yes, darling," said Marion, "and see what a view from the windows; first, the flower-beds - be- yond, the meadows with the feeding cows - do you see your heifer there --you didn't know it, but old Jo brought it several days ago - and further still; the river, your own river, the same that washes High Bank, and then on the other side a bit of open country, with old hills for a background. And see, this is the dining-room, and here is  PLEASANT VIEW.       139 your bed-room, and this door opens into the pantry, and there is the kitchen --an upper kitchen, you see, I stood. out for that; I wasn't going to have you catch the rheumatics in a damp basement, and here is the wood-shed and the sink-room, and the well-house, and all in order, too. And now we'll go up stairs; easy stairs, you see, short and broad - isn't the carpet a pretty stripe - there, this is the sick-chamber, this front one, with the pleasant view from the windows, and the open fire-place, and the two closets with shelves and drawers, where you can keep everything out of sight, and yet have it handy. And this little room over the hall is the store-room, well-stocked, too. Aleck, your grocery bill won't frighten you for- one quarter at least-- and this little one opposite is the linen press -don't it smell strong of the lavender -linen enough for a life-time one might guess--your mother must have begun to spin for you as soon as: you were born- and here is the spare room, two closets, too, you see, and here are two smaller rooms, one for your help if you should ever be so lazy as to need a girl, and the other for- I don't just know now- time will tell. And up there is the garret; I would have a garret in it; a house isn't half a house with- out one - plenty of room for all the rubbish you will be ever likely to gather - and there is such a nice cellar, too, dry and airy - your cream will rise finely. And now we will/go into the garden; you   "O      WINE, OR WATER. didn't expect to find a garden all to your hand, did you, dear? Well, I may as well let the secret out now; this is what has kept me so busy in the city all summer. I have almost blistered my hands with spading and raking and trying to get things into shape. Do you remember the rose vine I begged-of you this-spring for a dear friend; well, there it is, growing nicely between your parlor windows, and the Isabella grape will nearly cover the shed next year; it grows like a weed, and there are rows of currant bushes all around the fence, and a large strawherry bed, and fruit trees 'of every kind, and all the vegetables you will need this fall. Bless me, but my tongue is tired with telling you about it all. We'll go in now. Uncle has some little business to transact, and then we'll have our dinner." The little business was the formal transfer of the cottage and its two acres of land from Mr. Irvin to his daughter Mary, to be her s henceforth, to do with as she pleased. "And that pleased will mean, I haven't a doubt," said Fred, " to keep it forever as a home for her and her's. God make it a happy one, my cousin. Let me now give my mite and name it for you." "And What will you call it, Fred? It shall be just as you say; named once, named forever." He pointed to the prospect that lay stretched be. fore them, and said quietly, "Pleasant View."   CHAPTER VI L BREAD   UPON THE    WATER. MARY! Where is Mrs., Parkman, Maggie?" and the husband look- bed-room and pantry. In the nursery, sir, with the baby. Shall I call her?" "No, no; I'll go up to her myself. I must save her all the steps I can now-a-days, for she isn t the woman she was once," and he ran up the stairs. "Why, Aleck," and Mrs. Parkman nearly dropped the little one that she was dandling, "what's brought you back so soon; not one of your sick spells," and her face grew pallid with fear. "No, no, Mary; I'm as hearty as a buck to-day  but I come back to tell you, you had better not go up-street this afternoon. The pavements are very damp yet, and the sky threatens rain again. I   WINE OR WATER. shouldn't wonder if we had a hard shower in less than an hour." "Do you think so?" and putting the baby into the cradle, she went to the window and looked out. He followed her, and when he had reached her side, slipped one arm caressingly about her waist and drew her closely to him. "I do think so, wifey. See; it mists now." '"So it does; but perhaps it will clear off after awhile. I hope so, at any rate, for I ought to go this very afternoon. The dressmaker will be here eby Tuesday morning, and I shall have no other chance," and she gazed pleadingly at the clouds, as though she would have begged them " to go away and come again some other day." "What have you got to do to-morrow ; why can't you go then?" "Why, to-morrow is Saturday, Aleck, and you know I never think of'going out anywhere Satur- day. And I've more to do than usual to-morrow, too, because mother and father and Marion are com- ing up in the afternoon to spend Sunday with us." "Then put it off till Monday-what's to hinder?" "A good deal, Aleck. Monday is always our washing-day, and if it's a good drying one, I want to iron the fine clothes in the afternoon, so that I can help Miss Pratt sew all the time she 's here. She can't spare me but two days anyway. I hardly   believe it will rain enough to amount to anything. I guess if I put on my rubbers and thick shawl and take an umbrella, I can get along."  "It's no use talking, Mary, you can't go. Just think how you laughed last night, and how sore your throat and lungs were this morning. It wouldn't take much to bring you down to your bed again. The doctor said I must be as careful of you this fall as if you were the apple of my eye. Just think, wifey, what would become of us all if you were to be taken away." His voice faltered, and something very like a tear-drop glistened in his eyes. She nestled closer to him and laid her head against his arm, while her heart grew faint at the thought he had suggested. "You won't go, Mary?" and he looked tenderly into her face. "No, Aleck, I will not; much as I wanted to. New dresses are of little consequence after all, com- pared to health and strength." "But you shall have the dresses, wifey. I'll ar- range it someway, if I have to get a carriage Mon- day afternoon and take you up to the stores." "A carriage for me to go shopping in, Aleck," and she laughed merrily.  "What an idea. It would cost as much as one of the dresses." "And what if it did, wifey? What do you sup- pose I work for day after day, if it isn't that I may    "4      WINE OR WATER.           ,'t take care of you and the children. I wouldn't give a cent. for money if I couldn't take the good of it.  I guess I can afford you a carriage once in awhile,'  and he bent his head and impressed a very lover-like kiss upon her forehead. "And now, Mary," as he led her to her little rocking-chair, "Just make yourself comfortable this afternoon, and I'll wager half I'm worth that the mering and calico will be lying .on the top of your work-basket before you sleep Monday night. Good-bye," and throwing her a kiss with his hand he bounded down the stairs.    - "What a dear good fellow he is," was-Mrs. Park- man's mental ejaculation, as she heard the front-door ;  close on him. "I wonder where there is another   X i husband in the world that would have thought so'  far as to come back when he had got half way :to - his office and tell his wife she had better not go'out,  because it looked like rain. They'd said, if she don't know enough to stay home, let her get wet and suffer the consequences. I'dlike to see Mr. Mason troubling himself so about his wife. Dear me; what a life that woman does lead--never, never knowing how he will be when he comes in. Mercy, mercy, what is there more trying on earth v than a drinking husband.

And, mother, I 'spect he'll give us both a knife then, 'cause he said he would, you know, just as soon as we had a place to put them, and we've both got such nice pockets, you know." ".Then, we can whittle," shouted Harrie. "O, won't it be fun," and a joyous laugh ran all over his little face and twinkled in the corners of both his large blue eyes. "Let's go down in the wood-shed and hunt up some good sticks; mayn't we, mother?" "Not to-day, children; it's too damp there now. Father'll get you some," and then to soften the dis- appointment that she saw swelling up in their little throats, she said, kindly, "you may take your pic- ture books if you want to, and will be very still while I gel baby to sleep." " , we will, we will. Give me Old Mother Hub- bard and her dog," said Willie. "And give me Mother Goose; I want to see the little boy that went to London to get him a wife." Mrs. Parkman took the books down from the closet shelf, and the two little curly heads were soon poring over the brilliant pictures, still as mice, save when they would forget themselves for a moment and burst out into a merry peal of laughter. The baby was soon settled for her afternoon nap, and after changing her dress and collar and? tying   on a pretty black silk apron, Mrs. Parkman drew her chair to a window and took up her sewing. "How dark it grows," she exclaimed. "Why, I can hardly see to thread my needle. Why, what time is it, Maggie?" speaking to the young girl who had just come up. "Only a little after two, ma'am, but dark as though it was five; going to rain, too, I guess; yes, here it comes," and a whole sheet of water dashed against the windows. "Lucky you didn't go out, ma'am; you'd a-been wet through in five minutes.' Dear me, who's that pounding against the kitchen door. Some beggar or other, I'll warrant. I never did more than get up stairs, before I had to run down again. I've a good mind to let them pound." "No, no, Maggie; run down quick. Don't keep anybody out in this storm. I wouldn't shut the door on a dog. Mercy, how it does come down. The sidewalks are flooded already." Maggie didn't hurry herself. She was tired, and out of patience, tob,a little, and made up her mind that whosoever it was, they shouldn't come into her clean kitchen with their muddy feet. "They might stay in the shed, if they wanted to get out of the rain; no business to come out when it looked so black." But she was naturally kind-hearted, and when, on opening the door, she saw cowering under the porch    "8      WINE OR WATER. two little barefooted boys, she cried out at once to them, "come in quick out of the rain," and even took the smallest one by the hand and dragged him towards the stove.  A pool of water settled about each pair of little feet and spread in tiny streams clean across the well-scoured floor. But Maggie did not heed them. She ran to the woodshed and got an armful of pine- kindlings and packed them into the stove, and open- ed all the dampers, and as soon as the fire blazed up, she ran to the stairs and called out to Mrs. Parkman " to please come down, if she could." "What's to be done with them, ma'am? they're like rats in a river. Did you ever see the like? ; A Who do you suppose had the heart to send out two such babies to beg on such a day as this." Tears gathered into Mrs. Parkman's eyes as she looked at the two ragged little boys, every shred upon them dripping wet. Her mother-heart ached for them, and for a moment she could not control herself enough to speak. Then she said tenderly, "you poor little fellows. What made you come out on such a bad day." The eldest, a manly looking child of eight, looked up to her and said timidly, "mother told us to."  Harsh, cruel, unfeeling woman, thought Mrs.    Parkman, and she wondered what would tempt her   ; to send two little boys out on such a rainy after- . noon.   BREAD UPON THE WATER.      149 "Where do you live, and what made her tell you to?" "Down in Water street, ma'am; a great ways from here it is, too. We came way down here 'cause we had n't never been here, and thought we could get something, perhaps. Mother sent us, 'cause we've nothing for supper, and we didn't have any breakfast or dinner or any supper last    i night but some old crusts. Mother-don't like to have us beg, and she never lets us when she can help it, but she's sick now, and we have to. Wll you please, ma'am, give us something to eat." "Cut some bread and spread it, Maggie - two large slices--the poor half-starved things. Sup- pose they were mine. Dear, dear, what a world we live in.

Poor things. My heart aches for them. How I wish I had some clothes that would fit them. They'll catch their deaths of cold in those wet rags- Let me see," and she sat down and thought. Pretty soon she started for the stairs, and after being gone a few moments, returned with two small -blankets.   150      WINE OR WATER. "It's all I could think of," she said to Maggie, "but they're better than nothing - " "A good deal, ma'am, 'cause they can wrap up in them days and sleep in- them nights.

That sticks to the ribs better than pie." "Yes, I know; but give them some now." "If you please, ma'am," said the eldest, " we'll I take the pie home to mother, 'cause she's sick, and it 'll taste good to her." "I'll send some' to her. You eat all you can here. Won't you have some more bread and butter?" seeing he looked longingly at the loaf. "If you please, ma'am," and two more liberal slices were handed to them. While they were, as Maggie said, "putting them  out of sight," Mrs. Parkman filled the little basket they had brought with bread and meat and pie, and covered it care- fully with a bit of flannel, the better to keep out the wet. "Don't go yet, children," seeing they looked to- wards the door. "Get well warmed and dried, and wait till it holds up a little. Have you anything to make a fire with when you get home?" "No, ma'am."

She had a little baby, but it died a week ago, and she had to let the man have all the money she'd saved for wood to get it a coffin and bury it," and the child sobbed as though his heart would break. Mrs. Parkman hid her face, and for some moments said nothing. Then wiping her eyes, she asked him, kindly, "And where is your father all this while?" "About home, ma'am," -'and the thin cheeks reddened.          - "And what does he do? Why don't he take care of your mother and you?" The child swallowed hard three or four times, and then dropping his'face, said, in a low broken  tone, "( My father drinks rum." * "The old boy take the rumsellers," cried Maggie. "I wish the whole gang of them had but one neck and I: was a hangman. I'd soon put them out of the way." "Hush, hush, Maggie. They don't think." "Well, but they ought to, and if they won't, they ought to be made to.

And yet the State 'll license them to do it-give them leave to, and then tax honest, hard-working men and women to take care of the beggars it makes. I tell you, ma'am, it makes my blood boil sometimes, and I feel then as if I could wring a rumseller's neck, just as easy as I could a chicken's. The Lord ought to visit upon them judgments as much as ever he did on Pharaoh.  But he don't. No, no, in- deed. They can live in their palaces, and wear silks and velvets, and eat off of china and silver, while the poor wretches that they've sold damnation to, may lie and rot in the gutter," and she clenched her hands and set her teeth, as if oppressed by a horrible memory. "Don't, don't talk so, Maggie. It scares me to hear you." "If you had felt what I've felt, you wouldn't blame me for talking so. Wern't my father and mother both drunkards; yes, both; and when they were so poor they hadn't a rag to cover their naked- ness, and some kind men and women gave them good, comfortable things for the winter, didn't the rumseller levy on them for the drink they owed them -take the very clothes off their back, and the victuals off of the table, and the wood out of the yard.

A neighbor, a kind-hearted old Scotch woman, took them in and gave them a bite of supper, and let them get well warmed, and said that my mother and me, I was a child, then, like him, there," pointing to the eldest boy, " should sleep with her, and my father might take one, of her comforters and a blanket into his own room and make a bed of them. You see she did n't dare to have him sleep in the same room with her, because he had had the tremens twice, and the doctors had said he was liable to an attack at any moment. Well, my mother and I had n't been in such a good bed for a long time, and we slept pretty sound and never waked up till the old woman called to us to get up, for breakfast was ready. ' You go and call your father,' she says to me. But I did n't dare to, for he was always awful cross when he was waked up; so my mother went.  She opened the door and called to him.

"We waited till the old woman was tired, and then we both ran in- ran in to find my father a frozen corpse, and my mother in fits beside him.

So he took the comfortable down to the dram-shop, and the rumseller bought it and was to pay him in rum, and let him have all he wanted that night. Yes, he bought that, when he knew to a certainty it did n't belong to my father, for he had stripped the house bare that morning; when he knew he had either stolen it or had it lent to him. I reckon you won't think it strange now that I hate, yes, hate the rumsellers. They made me an orphan when I was only eight years old. O, I shall never, never forget the next day, when I saw both father and mother put into rough pine boxes and  carried off to Potter's Field. I feel like cursing every time I pass a dram-shop." "And what did they do with you?" asked the eldest boy, who had listened to the girl's impassion- ed talk with both eyes dilated to their utmost ex- tent. "Do," she answered fiercely, clutching him by the arm, " they packed me off to the orphan asylum and kept me there till I was twelve, when they bound me out to a person who half starved me, half froze me, and worked me to my very bones for six long years. And that's what they'll do with you when your mother and father die. You'll wish you had gone with the baby.

You shouldn't have talked so before him, Maggie.  You've scared him   most to death. There, there, child," wiping his eyes, " don't cry any more. Perhaps your mother won't die, and perhaps your father 'll quit drinking sometime, and then you'll be very happy again and live like little birds in a new nest. Take your basket now, and run home as quick as you can, before it rains again. And to-morrow morning come down here about seven o'clock and I'll give you and your little brother each a good breakfast, and afterwards go back with you and see your mother. Perhaps I can do something for her. Good-bye now. Tell her not to worry about you, for I'll take care of you both."  "That's  promising a good deal, ma'am," said Maggie. "It's no little job to take care of two such boys." "I know it; I know it; but I'll trust in God to help me. The poor woman will die a good deal easier, if she thinks her little ones will be well cared 1 for, and they seem like bright, intelligent children,  : whom it will be a pleasure to do for."          j "It'll take a heap of money, though, to clothe,      and school, and educate them."9             I ::I :'   156    W'INE OR WATER.

"I'll go myself tonight It may be all got up to get money out of you -" "O, no, Aleck; no. Those children told the truth; I know they did. Why, they were half- starved.

"Well, never, mind," said his mother, gently, "Kneel down by the side of Harrie and say your prayers." He obeyed. As he was lisping the last words, the door was softly opened, and a pale, care-worn looking woman entered with a noiseless step. They did not see her, and she stood for some minutes and watched the group. It was a pretty picture -the fire blazing in the chimney and lighting up the room with a cheerful glow; the noble looking husband sitting at his ease in his great arm-chair, his slippered feet toasting on the fender, his dressing gown falling over him in graceful folds, and contrasting finely with the white cambric robe of the baby who was laughing in his arms, and the beautiful mother, lovlier than in her girlhood, with a hand upon the head of each kneel- ing boy, and her lips moving with voiceless prayer for them. "Now sing, mother, please do;" they exclaimed with one accord. '. Sing the dove-song; father likes that best; don't you, father?"   BREAD UPON THE WATER.        161 "Yes, mother; sing the dove song. The baby likes it, too, don't you little one?" She did sing, and to the unseen listener it was as though the strain floated down from heaven, instead of up from a human home. "There sitteth a dove so white and fair All on the lily spray, And she listeneth how to Jesus Christ The little children pray;  Lightly she spreads her friendly wings, And to heaven's'gate hath fled, And to the Father in Heaven she bears The prayers which the children have said.

Any one would imag- ine I had the consumption, to see how you muffle me up. I'll go with you now Mrs. Mason." And he left the house. "It's too bad," said Maggie, as she put her head in the dining-room to answer a call from her mis- tress; too bad that Mr. Parkman has to go out this awful muddy night, just to help get that drunken MBason into bed. If I had such a man, I'd sew him up in a sheet and pound him till he was black and blue, but what I'd make him promise to leave liquor alone.

I'd give him a walking ticket, mighty quick, if the law did call him my husband.

"No, Maggie, I'll wait. I couldn't rest if I lay down. Throw on some more wood. He'll be chill- ed through. What can keep him." They sat up and waited. The clock struck eleven and twelve.

"She was too far gone to be moved. I stayed with her till she died." "Is she dead?  "Yes; she's at rest now, poor heart-broken thing." "And her husband?"  "Locked up in the watch-house. He carried on so, that I called in a watchman and had him carried off. He's a poor miserable specimen of humanity as ever I saw." "What did you do with the corpse, Aleck; leave it in that cellar?" "No, indeed. The rats would have eaten it up before daylight. No; I gave an old woman. a dol- lar, to let me carry it into her room for the night.

It was an opportunity not to be lost. The children are both of them dear little fellows; the eldest seems very bright, indeed. We shall get along some way with them. The poor little dears I O, I'm so glad you went up there to-night. How that mother would have felt but for your promise! But come now, hurry up and get warm, for I know you're tired almost to death. O, I'd most forgotten to ask you, how did you find Mason to-night?" "Drunk as a man could be; a perfect log to move. I should think his wife would give up en- tirely and not try to be anybody. I don't see how she can live with him. "He's her husband and her childrens' father," said Mrs. Parkman, gently, " and those names cover a multitude of sins. She has a hard lot though. I should think her heart would break. JI guess I'll run up again and see if those little ones are well covered. Poor motherless ones. Suppose they were mine!" Is        m    CHAPTER   VII. A TASTE AND    A FORETASTE. TWELVE years! Mar- oriedtwelve years! Is it possible," and Mrs. Parkman drew her left hand slowly across her forehead, as one is apt to, when a fact long known is- suddenly made vivid to the mind. Then she looked down again on the fair page with its single record and whispered, softly, "yes; it is so," and her eyes following the old-fashioned hand-writing- her father's it was, and he had brought that family Bible to her on his first visit to her new home, - she read: "Married on Thursday, Sept. 3d, 18--, Aleck Parkman to Mary Irvin.!"

Everything was still out of doors and within. The light wind scarcely rustled the yet green foliages of the trees and shrubbery, while the pansies and asters seemed slumbering in the bright sunshine. There was no rippling music in the calm flow of the blue river, no gushing bird- song on the golden waves of the soft atmosphere.   . Nature seemed to have bent her knees and folded her hands in silent adoration of the Most High. From the rooms 'below there came up not the tiniest buzz of household labor, while in the chamber where she sat, all was silence. Even the few flies hung lazily against the ceiling, not so much as lift- ing a single wing. She was alone in the cottage for the first time since the birth of her last little one; alone, save that there lay upon the bed the tiny form of the baby-pet who, five weeks before; had come to claim her mother-love. Undisturbed, she sat and thought. She retraced the peaceful tenor of the little house- hold during the first eighteen months' of its existence, when she was to her husband his little girl-wife, loved and caressed as in the days of courtship. Then the break in that charmed quiet, when baby lips for the first time cooed upon her   168       WINE 'OR WATER, cheeks, and baby-faces nestled on her breast; when: her husband not only called her wife, but as he pressed his fervent kisses on her pale face, whisper- ed softly, "mother, mother." Then, when the dear twin boys were in the fourth summer of their life, the next white mile-stone, -the little daughter's ad- vent, and then, too soon for the mother's strength, the coming of a third little boy, and afterward another still and then another, till again a little daughter is placed within her arms. Seven in all - too many for her fragile life, but just enough for her fond heart, for each child as it came was loved as fondly as the 'first. Beautiful and winning children they were, too, and so well brought up that even the careless visitor was charmed with them. Seldom inflicting punish- ment, seldom even threatening it, both parents were yet firm in their requirements, and as they never were forgot, as too many do, that their children were not yet men and women, but simple-hearted little ones, their commands were suited to their varied ages and dispositions, and their home was thus a fair type of the Christian's thought of heaven, care with comfort for an accompaniment, labor made light by love. It was indeed a pleasant picture to look back upon, those twelve years of married life and the gentle wife and mother would not have' changed a single feature, nor soften or brighten a solitary tint.   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.   ; 169 Not all sunshine, for there had been the pain and weariness of motherhood, but the pang and the peril had been fleeting, while the joy and peace had been abiding. In a worldly view, it was true, they could hardly have been said to have prospered much. Their children were all the riches they could claim. Mr. Parkman had had no capital to invest in the firm of which he became a partner on the January preced- ing his wedding day, and the rapid increase of his little family had prevented much accumulation from the small profits that had accrued to him. But they had always had a plenty, and more than that; for if Aleck had Many fault, Mary used to tell her mother, it was in being too extravagant in the daily and weekly supply of the table and pantry. He never stinted, and he ever bought the best. But thus far, he had always -made both ends meet in the annual settlement, and being of a sanguine disposi- tion, kept hoping every year, the next would find him richer. "Twelve years without a shadow on thy hearth- stone, or a sorrow bn thy heart--how few women can say so," and Mrs. Parkman breathed a silent prayer to God for his great mercy to her. "Essie needed not to have warned me as she did. My noble husband! Well has he kept his promise to me. He ehas indeed'cherished me in sickness and in health, and will cherish me, till death do us part." 4.    170        WINE OR WATER. And then, with every feeling wrought up to its highest pitch, she opened her Bible again and read with rapid, yet fervent utterances, Psalm after Psalm of Thanksgiving.   Then she took up her hymn book, but before her finger had turned a single leaf, she involuntarily lifted her voice in that grand old hymn,             f "When all thy mercies, O, my God, My rising soul surveys, Transported with the view I'm lost In wonder, love and praise." She sang it through, that and another, its mate in grandeur of thought and felicity of expression, "While thee I seek, protecting Power! Be my vain wishes stilled; And may this consecrated hour With better thought be filled." As the last sweet, trustful stanzas died upon her lips, that stanzas into which she seemed to pour her very soul, all warmed up as it was with impassioned thought. "My lifted eye, without a tear, The gathering storm shall see; My steadfast heart shall know no fear ; That heart shall rest on thee!" she caught the gentle patter of advancing footsteps, and  the low  murmur of well-known   voices. She looked from the window and a beautiful smile played over her face as she watched the little family group. go . *  j   -I   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.     171 It was headed by her twins, her idols, if her mother- heart knew any difference in its depths of tender- ness. Manly-looking -boys they were, too, and as you looked upon their fair, intelligent faces, you would pardon her all the pride she felt in them. Behind them, came her father and mother, who sel- dom now allowed a Saturday night to pass, without coming up to their daughter's' cottage to spend the Sabbath. The old man held his little namesake, the third son, by the hand, and it was a touching sight to see how reverently "Nattie," as he was called, a pretty abreviation of that quaint old Connecticut name Nathaniel, checked his usual dancing steps into the measured 'meeting" gait of his grand- father. The old lady led a wee, toddling, almost baby-boy along, the household pet, till that other, little baby had come along five weeks before. She had insisted upon taking him to church that day, that his mother might have perfect quiet, and had managed, too, to keep him still, having filled her pocket with brilliant sugar-plums and great, purple raisins, anodynes not bad to take, but fearful to digest. After them came the father, each hand clasped by a darling child, little Rose upon the left, and little Aleck on the right. He was talking to them as he walked along, not of the sermon, for that, as is the case too often, had been beyond their com- prehension; but of the little sister, whom the good God had lately given them, and telling them how \   172      WINt OR WATER. they must teach her what their mother had taught them, and be ever kind, gentle and patient with her. ' And you will call her Mary, father, after mother, wont you?" asked Rose, pleadingly, and added, as an unanswerable argument in her mind, "I think you bught to, father, for she named one of her little boys after you, you know." "I'd like to, dear, but mother says, the baby must be called for grandmother." "O, I could n't bear that," and a very tiny pout gathered on the red lips of the little Rose. "Why, don't you love grandmother?" ;' Love her I I guess I do then, but I don't like her name. Please, father, don't call her Abigail." "But if we shorten it to Abbie - what then?" O, that would be sweet. Let me run ahead and tell the boys," and- as the twins opened the gate and held it from swinging back till the rest had entered, the little girl bounded by them all, and catching a hand of each twin-brother, whispered the news to them with as much emphasis as older maid- ens tell their secrets. "And how have you passed the morning, wife?" asked Mr. Parkman tenderly, as with gentle foot- steps he entered the front chamber. "Has the baby worried any?" and he bent his head close down to the little pink-white face that was almost hid in its dainty frills of lace. "O, no. She has n't even wakened. I have had   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.    173 a very quiet, pleasant time; almost as good, I guess, as you have had in church. But, do tell me, how little Lewis behaved himself." O, he did first rate, wife; never made a breath of noise; though I shouldn't wonder if he had the stomach-ache this afternoon to pay for his devotions, for grandmother kept stuffing him with something all the time. But what have you been doing, Mary, all this forenoon. Not reading, H hope; you know the doctor said you must be careful of your eyes." "I have n't read enough to hurt them, Aleck. I have only been thinking. Do you know that Tues- day is the anniversary of our wedding-day?"  "' No! Is it, Mary?" "Yes, it's the third of the month, you know." "And how many years is it, dear, since you and I laid aside our individuality and became but one - let's see-.eleven- more than that." "Yes; twelve. It doesn't seem so long, does it?" "Hardly; hardly, Mary. And we are as poor as we were then."  O O, no, Aleck. We have seven added treasures. Eqive boys, each worth a thousand apiece, make quite a pretty sum for a poor man." "And your two girls --let me see; how much do they value each girl-baby - the old nurse told me, but I have forgotten." "Five hundred -but come; let us go down. I " .    174      WINE OR WATER. told Maggie she need not come back at noon; I would help grandma set out the dinner." "I'm afraid you're too smart, wife. Careful, now, dear. Here," and he lifted her slight form in his arms, "you ain't much heavier than a baby, anyway." "Here!" as he put her gently down upon the carpet of the dining room, c when you want to go back again, just tell me and I'll take you tlere. She must let me, too, must n't she, grandma. She's too ambitious always. I wonder she don't have more pull-backs than she does." Mrs. Parkman was assisting Mrs. Irvin in clear- ing off the table, or rather making feint of doing so, for her mother was too tender of her strength to allow her to lift anything heavier than a tea-spoon. Suddenly, as the old lady was wiping a tea-cup, it dropped from her hand and fell to the floor, but not with the crash she expected; for instead of dropping into half a dozen pieces, it merely whirled around five or six times, and then settled itself demurely. "A streak of good luck," she remarked to her daughter, as she picked it up and plunged it again into the dish water. "O, you need n't have been frightened, mother; " answered Mrs. Parkman, quietly; ,4 there is no break to that tea-set; there is n't a piece of it but has been dropped twenty times, and yet never one has been even cracked."   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.     175 "They've done pretty well then, considering what a family you've had to use them. Let's see; it's eleven, yes, more than that; why, yes, indeed; the twins are in their eleventh year." "Twelve years this week, mother, since they came into use." "Dear me; but so it is! Mercy, how time does run." And her face grew thoughtful, and she did not speak again till she had the dishes all put away, and was wiping off the table. Then she said, gently, "but you've been pretty lucky in everything, Mary. Such a good husband is n't picked up every day; and it isn't every mother either can show seven such bright, handsome children. You've a great deal to be thankful for."- "I have indeed, mother," and her eyes grew' moist and her voice husky, and she sat down, weak with emotion. After a little pause, during which the old lady had straightened every thing in the dining-room, Mrs. Parkman said to her, "I have been thinking, mother, that if you and father would stay over till Wednesday morning, instead of going to-morrow, we'd have a little celebration on Tuesday, the twelvth anniversary of our wedding day. Fred and Essie will be down to-morrow afternoon,' and we can send for Marion and William, and those are all we want, you know-just a little quiet family party."   176      WINE OR WATER. "You mustn't think of such a thing, Mary. Why you know just how it would be. You'd go to baking and stewing, and worrying, and bring yourself flat down on your back, and like as not, never get up again all winter. But I'll tell you what we can do. Father and I'll go to morrow as we calculated to, and we'll take the children down with us, all but little Lew, that is; and Tuesday morning, you and Aleck and Maggie, and the baby and this little fellow," catching the toddling baby grandson in her arm, "and Fred and Essie, can came down in the first boat, and we'll have a family party there." "But then you'll work yourself to death, mother.' "No, I shan't either; no danger of me. I'm as tough as a pine knot yet. And then I haven't very much to do, you see. I baked up a jar of fruit cake only a week ago, and I made a batch of loaf cake only Saturday, and had first rate luck with it, too. I didn't frost it, because I didn't think of having company to eat it; but I can whisk up some eggs and sugar in less than no time, and have it all nice enough for a king. And I've got some chickens all fattened-I wish I had a turkey fit to kill, but I have n't, not one; but I tell you what I have got, Mary; a nice plump roaster. I was going to send it up to Aleck for a present pretty soon, because I know he was fond of one, and father and I don't care a penny for them; so we can   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.    1" hate that and, let me see - O, I guess I can get some pigeons of some of the neighbors; they've been malting pigeon beds lately, all of them, and that, with some fresh pumpkin and peach pies, and what other stuff I can pick up, wrill do, won't it?" "I should think it would, mother. Any one would imagine you expected a regiment." 4"What's that I hear about chickens and pigs and pigeons,"' and Mr. Parkman put his head into the ' door, with a quizzical look on his countenance. "Why only this, Aleck," began tLe old lady. "O, you needn't tell him, mother," and Mary laughed. 'C He's heard every word we've said; I know he has by his looks. \He's always near by if anything is said about having a good time or some- thing good to eat. Confess now, Mr. Parkman- have n't you been eaves-dropping.' "Of course; who could help it though, when you both talked so loud. Then we are all to come down Tuesday and have a good anniversary feast, are we! Well, I'm ready; or stay, let me see. I declare, I don't know as I can, though. Mr. Kinsman is going away to-morrow, and we are pretty well drove up just now. What time will you have dinner?" "Why, I thought we'd have dinner and tea together, about three o clock." O, O well; then I guess I can arrange it. Fred and Essie can go down with Mary in the six o'clock boat, and I'll come in the ten o'clock one-but I oP    I     178     W- INE OR WATER. shall have to come back that night, though - how'll you like that, wife?" "O, but she needn't come. It would be too much for her, to go and back in one day. And then I want a visit from her, too. You know she has n't been down for three months or better. Let her and the children stay the rest of the week, and you come down Saturday night and stay over Sun- day, and then you can all come up together early Monday." "Yes, yes; it takes you to plan, mother. And what am I to do here alone? Keep bachelor's hall? I don't like that part very well." "Why, Maggie must come back with you," said his wife. "No, indeed, dear. Maggie must do no such thing. She must stay and help you take care of those seven precious jewels of yours. I was only joking. I can manage well enough. I'll letour neighbor here have the milk, morning and night, to. pay for my breakfast and supper, and I'll get my dinners up in town. So that settles it, and now I am going to settle you for the afternoon," and he lifted his wife gently and carried -her up stairs, and did not leave her till he saw her snugly ensconsed in bed, with the baby on her arm. Grandmother took little "' Lew," with her and went into the nur- sery for a nap; Grandpa lay down on the lounge in the dining-room; the twins and Rose went to their   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.     179 Sabbath school, and Mr. Parkman and Nattie and Aleck, to a quiet little nook on the banks of the. river, where, while the father enjoyed his denomi- national paper, he could yet watch the quiet sports of his little ones as they tossed green and russet leaves into the blue water, and watched them float down with the current. Now and then he would call them to him and read some little item he had found which he knew would please or interest them, and always drop his paper readily, if they came to question him. Harrie and Willie and Rose joined them in the course of an hour, and- after telling. their father about the school, what lessons -they-- had learned, what chapters they had read, and what hymns sung, they sat down quietly with their library books. Grandpa joined them after awhile, with little "Lew," riding on his shoulders, and the chil- dren with one accord gathered about his knees as soon as he was seated, and begged for a story, a true story, something that had happened to himself, years before. And in hearing it, another hour passed by all too soon, "Sunday afternoons are so short always," said Rose, as her father, looking at his watch, said it was. time to go back to the house. "I do wish we could have two Sundays come together once in awhile." "Children general hate Sundays," said the old man to his son-in-law, as they slowly followed the pretty group; " but somehow, yours seem to take to it naturally."   180      WINE OR WATER. "It's the parents' fault usually, father, that Sun- day is so tedious. I don't profess to be anyway near perfect in my way of keeping it, but somehow I've always managed to make it a hallowed and pleasant day for my family. I've always shut the door on my business and troubles, if I had any, on Saturday night, and never allowed myself to look in upon them again till Monday morning. I've made it emphatically a home day and a holy-day. But we must hurry up our steps. Grandma is waving her handkerchief in the door, and that means tea is ready;" and he caught up the two year old baby and snuggled it down to his heart and hurried along. Wliat a pleasant Sabbath evening that was, when, every little chore done, the whole family gathered into the pretty parlor. Mrs. Parkman sat in the large rocking chair, with her feet carefully disposed on a 'cricket," a woolen shawl thrown lightly about her shoulders, and nestled Yi her lap the tiny baby-girl. Mr. Parkman half-reclined on the sofa, with Rose, his pet-child, if the truth be told, in the corner at his feet. Mrs. Irvin was in a low rocker, with little "Lew " in her arms, for she said he was only a baby yet, and it was too bad to turn him off entirely. Mr. Irvin leaned back in an old-fashioned arm chair, which was tilted on its hind legs, while between his knees stood Nattie, playing with the curiously wrought gold seals that dangled from his   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.     181 watch-guard. Aleck, one of those restless children whom it is torture to keep still, was in his little chair with a slate and pencil, making pictures which it would have been no sin to worship, for they were in the likeness of nothing in heaven or earth, but which symbolized to him men, and birds, and beasts; while Harrie and Willie were sitting quietly beside their mother, one son each side, Harrie holding her right hand and Willie her left. The astral was turned down, so that only a beautiful twilight seem- ed to hover over them, and when they spoke, it was in those low, soft tones, that told of perfect peace. The clock struck eight. As its last chime was hushed, the children, all but Lew, who was fast asleep in his grandma's arms, gathered about their mother's chair, and with clasped hands, sang a pretty evening hymn. Mrs. Irvin then went off quietly with her sleeping pet, while Mr. Parkman took Aleck and Nattie by the hand, after leading them around to give and receive a good night kiss from all, went with them to the nursery and put them to bed. 'It was the privilege of the three elder to stay up till nine o'clock on Sunday evening, and one that they enjoyed intensely, though if the truth be told, little Rose was always caught napping in her father's arms before that hour came around, This was the first evening Mrs. Parkman had spent down stairs since her illness, and it was evi- dent by the light that flashed in the children's eyes that a treat was, expected.   182      WINE OR WATER. "She's well enough to let us have our little meet- a ing, isn't she, grandma," they asked, eagerly, as the i old lady returned and tenderly took up the baby, saying, softly, " don't your knees tremble, Mary, holding it so long? ' "Yes, I guess so," to the children; "but she mustn't play more than two or three times." "Here, father," and Willie drew a chair to the table, '; sit right down here ; mother is well enough, and we're so glad." Mr. Parkman sat down and taking up the family Bible, turned its leaves reverently and then read from them one of those quaint-told stories which the little ones of all ages have loved to listen to. Then closing the volume, he questioned the children about it, and explained some of the imagery, and then he arose and opened the piano and led his wife to it. ("What shall I play, father? and she turned affectionately to Mr. Irvin. "Old hundred, I guess, child." "I knew he'd say that," whispered Willie. "Ah," breathed Harrie, " he likes that because he can sing it without a book." Old hundred was played and sung, and then grandmother's favorite, "When I can read my title clear," and then Mr. Parkman'si "Vital spark of heavenly flame," and then, before Mrs. Irvin could remonstrate, one of Mary'sown choosing, "O Thou, to whom, in ancient time The lyre of Hebrew bards was strung."   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.     183 Mr. Parkman gently closed the piano then, and motioning to Mr. Irvin, they all knelt down, while the white-haired old man offered up a prayer of thanksgiving and praise-- thanksgiving that his child, the wife and mother of that household, had been again restored to her family in health and strength, and that another fair, sweet little one had been given to her ;- praise, for all the blessings that had been showered upon the young family, from the hour the bride and groom first crossed the threshold of the cottage, till now when twelve years of married life were counted. Simple words the old father used, for he was an unlettered man, but they came from the sacred place of his heart and were inexpressibly touching to those who joined with him. The children were then kissed all round and went quietly up to bed, the grandmother following after a while to see that they were well covered and no drafts blowing on them. And then the two hus- bands and wives drew their chairs yet closer to- gether and talked in subdued voices for an hour or so longer, Air.

You keep it and just let Lew run; Mr. and Mrs. Staunton will watch hm. I'll be down in the next boat. Good-bye. Drive easy," to the coachman, "You've plenty of time." And as the carriage rolled away, he waved an adieu and hurried to lock up the cottage, that he might despatch his business and follow them. It was a beautiful picture--that old hall in the farm-house with its long table of home-made luxuries - grandmother at the head with a pigeon pie loom- ing up before her, grandfather at the foot, with the ample platter of fricasseed chickens all ready to be served, Mr. Parkman in the centre, with the roast pig before him, and the carving knife and fork to in- dicate his duties, his gentle wife just opposite, looLk- ing very matronly, with three children ranged on each side of her, and opposite them, Fred and Essie and William and Marion. Fred and Essie I William and Marion! while the dinner is being eaten, let me tell you how it happens I join their names so handily--how it happens they come in couples to that festival. Time had wrought changes with others than our friends Aleck and Mary. Time, which soothes all sorrows, had spread its healing balm over the widowed hearts of both Fred and Marion, and only   A TASTE AND A PORETASTE.     185 smooth scars and the sanctified memories of the past remained. Fred could not forget the gentle girl whom he had met- at his cousin's wedding, though many months passed between their first and second meet- ing. Ill health sent him there to his uncle's to re- cruit, and once in the neighborhood of her who had filled his thoughts for a whole winter, it was not strange he should find a way to become more in- timately acquainted. Nor was it strange that he should soon learn to love the patient, self-sacrificing girl, with a depth and strength that only such natures as his are capable of. And Essie, whose whole life had been such a sweet, sad poem, how could she help loving one who came to her with a brimming cup of jov. She did love him, and be; fore the summer was over they were betrothed; be- trothed but with the understanding they were not to marry till all her duties to her father and grand- father were completed - till she stood alone in the wide world. It was weary waiting; for him who had found such sweet peace in her love ; but he never murmured, tlinking 'all the time how nobly the gentle girl was bearing it; her duties more arduous now than ever, her grandfather having lapsed into second childhood, and her father having reason enough restored, to be unsatisfied unless she were ever with him. Three years she waited on them both; then the angels kindly relieved her of   186      WINE OR WATER. her task, and the worn and weary spirits 'of the father and son found rest in heaven. Mr. and Mrs. Irvin opened their house to her, as long before they had opened their heart, but Fred would only permit her to be with them a few months, when he claimed her as his bride. Eight years of married life had only endeared them more closely to each other, and daily and nightly did they give thanks to the All- Father for the blessing. of each other's affection. Only one joy was lacking in their modest home ; the voices and footsteps of little children had never echoed there. But even for this privation, large as their hearts were, they did not murmur; both knew that their blood was tainted with hereditary sins, and that the blessing was wisely withheld, lest in -the end it proved a curse. William and Marion! The wild, vague hope of the young man soon resolved itself into a sweet cer- tainty in the near and dear companionship that fol- lowed the return of his early love to her old home, while the rekindled affection of the girlish widow glowed brighter and steadier, till it merged itself in a flame that death only could extinguish. When the sixth spring-time had showered its greenness and its beauty on the grave over which she had once bent in the sincerity of sorrow, she again stood up in the old farm-house and pledged herself in the holy vows of wifehood. And beautiful thus far, had been that new experience to her; so beautiful    *   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.     187 that the fearful past seemed to her now as but the remembrance of a dream. "You will certainly be down Saturday evening Aleck," said Mrs. Parkman, earnestly, as she hand- ed her husband her heavy blanket shawl to draw about his shoulders as he was starting for the boat. "If I don't come, you may know I'm dead, Mary, or some terrible thing has happened. Yes, yes; of course I'll come. And do you take it as easy as you can, and get recruited as much as possible. Let Maggie see to the children; she's nothing else to do here. And now, good-bye, darling," and he folded her to his heart and kissed her quivering lips. The captain of the steamboat stood near the gang- ways as he stepped aboard. "Good evening, Mr. Parkman," he said, cordially; "a cool evening it is, too; won't you step into my state-room with me? you'll find it pleasanter than in the cabin," and linking his arm into the passenger's, he led him for- ward. A gentleman sat beside the little round table, on which, in brilliant array, stood cut glass decanters and goblets; a stranger, Mr. Parkman thought, till he lifted his head and gazed keenly into his eyes.                 , There was a mutual recognition, and the words "Harrie," "Aleck," burst simultaneously from their lips, and the next moment they were in each other's arms.   188      WINE OR WATER. "But where under the sun did you drop from?" said Mr. Parkman, when the first ectasy of meeting was over. "I had given up all hopes of ever hear- ing from you again, and as for seeing you, that I never expected to. Except, indeed, I had once in a while a faint hope of meeting you in the other world." "A very faint one, too, considering what a grace- less scamp I have always been," and his friend laughed.  "But, you know, Aleck, I said when I left here, I would never come back, unless I brought the chinks with me, and by jingo, I've got them, , too," and he rattled his pockets and then tossed a handful of gold coin on to the table and watched them as they rolled about with a musical ring. "But come, sit down and let's have a cosy time together. Captain here, knew me the minute I stepped aboard, and insisted on my sharing his bed and board; pretty good it is, too, the board especial- ly," and he jingled the decanters together, and then held them  up to the light.  "Amber and rubies,--the poetry of Maderia, and claret- which will you take, Aleck." "O, you needn't try to tempt him,'Hal," said the Captain, with the least bit of a sneer curling his WP nostrils; ]he's a second Father Matthew; would no sooner touch wine than a Jew would pork." "Is that so, Aleck? But, faith, it's a new thing then, for you used to be ready to join a fellow in a    A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.    189 good time once in awhile. I've seen you on the Fourth, when you couldn't stand without your arm around a post." 4Yes, I know it," answered Mr. Parkman, trying to laugh, " but I was a youngster then; now I'm the head of a family and it behooves me to walk pretty straight, you know." "O, yes; that's all well enough; then there's no earthly use in your denying yourself everything. A social glass with a friend, once in awhile, couldn't possibly harm you. Try it once, now," and the jolly tar youred out a glass of wine, and offered it to his friend. Mr. Parkman had never been tempted before, save in the presence of his wife and her cousin Fred, since the day he resolved to drink no more, and a glance into the eyes of either, had always been warning enough. He had thought himself strong, but alas, it was only because he had leaned on others and they had kept him up. "They will never know it -it is only this once - Hal will think I'm mean not to join himn in a glass, when, we haven't met before for so many years it's only wine, too -I never said I wouldn't touch it at all--pity if I can't just taste with an old friend without danger." So spoke the tempter to him, and he listened and listened, till instead of saying, "get thee behind me," he hugged the viper to his heart.   190 190            WINE OR WATER. "Free, free not to sin, but to be tempted and refrain." Where was memory then, that it brought not back those words to that husband and that fathdr; those words that he had spoken to the maiden of his choice, as they sat together on the summit of that old mountain; those words that had lifted the shadow from her heart and left only sunshine there. "To be tempted and refrain." He lifted the goblet--there is time yet, O, hus- band and father-- put it down before your lips have touched  the sparkling drops - down- down- yes, if you have to dash the glass to atoms!

"Wasn't there -  didn't come - then something   A TASTE AND A FORETASTE.      191 terrible has happened," and she dropped to the floor. "Something terrible!" Many times she spoke those words in the long watches of the night that followed. Many times she spoke them the next day as she stood within the porch, straining her eyes to see the dust of ap- proaching wheels. "Something terrible!" "He's coming- father's coming, mother -com- ing in a carriage- he's most here." "Thank God!" It was a prayer not an ejaculation merely, and she ran to meet him. He took her in his arms; he folded her to his heart; he kissed her lips. She does not scr'eam, does not faint--but as his wine-tainted breath mingles with his caresses, her heart gives a sob, a long, a half-suppressed sob, and she drops quietly into her seat, conscious that "something terrible " has indeed happened. He has tasted and this is her foretaste. ;   CHAPTER   V11l. DROWNING SORROW. WHERE are few moments so agonizing in the life. experience of woman---in- deed, we have sometimes thought there is no moment so crushing, as that terrible one in which she learns for the first time, that her husband, he whom she had worshipped next to her Maker, has fallen from his " high estate," has submerged the purity of his prom- ises. Then it is that every hope of life seems drifting away in a shoreless sea; o I  then it is that from the pallid lips there flutters that despairing cry, "let me die--let me die!" But truly has one said, "the prayer to die is the last one ever answered."  And especially does this seem to be so, when the petitioner is a heart-broken wife. Never does her aching frame seem so tena-   DROWNING SORROW.       193 cious of life as then. Though-racled with physical agony every moment, though convulsed each day with the grief that will so often have its way, she still lives on, and on and on, till it seems to her poor heart, that God and Jesus and death and all mDi- i ful angels haveforgotten that she was ever born. A. "O, if I had only died last summer! 'why did \ they bring me back when I was so nearly gone?" Such was the thought of Mrs. Parkman, when she recovered from the partial swoon into which the wine-tainted breath of her husband had thrown her. And then, as consciousness entirely returned, and she looked the fact sternly in the face, a second thought flashed on her - his sin must be concealed. Yes, concealed; for terrible as it- is for a wife to know of her beloved's fall, it is yet more trying to know that relatives and friends and neighbors must hear of it -that the world's finger of'scorn must be pointed at him. All lengths will the true wife go to conceal that first step downward. She will smile with a sob in her throat, and jest with her hand on her heart. Not false to her 'wifehood was Mrs. Parkman in this, her grim hour of trial. Nay, though her feet shook in her shoes, though her knees bent beneath her, though tons of stone seemed piled upon her heart, and bands of iron riveted about her brain; though her face and hands were colorless save from an ashy tinge upon her lips, and a blueish streak   194      WINE Or WATER. about her nails, she rose up quietly, and mingled with the household group the same as ever; drank her tea, though every drop seemed like molten lava to her palate, and ate her supper though every morsel seemed to strangle her, and when swallowed, lay like lumps of lead upon her breast. When her mother said to her in an anxious tone; "Aleck should see the doctor about those spells of his," referring to his own explanation of his tardiness, for, like every one in the first stage of crime, Mr. Parkman -had descended to a falsehood to conceal his dereliction from duty, and pressing his hand upon his forehead, told of the dizziness that had so suddenly come over him on Saturday afternoon, and which had obliged him to be taken home in a carriage and keep his bed till a late hour on Sun- day morning. When her mother spoke thus, she said calmly, "Yes, he must have medical advice at once, and what is more; he must not be left alone, it is not safe. Hereafter I must stay at home, un- less he can go with me." She was right, poor, crushed creature; it was not safe for him to be alone --it is never safe for a mortal to be alone after yielding once to tempta- tion; not safe, for the demon is ever near after that, and only some good angel can thwart him of his longed-for prey. Very thankful however was she, when the gath- ering twilight permitted a few silent tears to fall   DnROVNING SORROW.       195 unseen, and she blessed her baby-girl again and again for the worrisome fit that came over her, and when her mother would have dosed the little one with " soot tea," assuring her it must be " colicky," or it would never cry so, she, said quietly, "No, mother; I don't want to begin with medicine if I can help it. I guess I had better go to bed with it. I feel quite tired, and we 'll have to get up very early, you know. Snugged up to me, I guess little Abbie will forget all her troubles. Maggie, you may put the children to bed before a great while, and mind and lay their clothes all out, so, that if we get belated in the morning, there won't be so much confusion." "O, you won't get belated, Mary; there is no danger of that," said Mrs. Irvin, as she went to the cellar-way to get a fresh candle from the box. "No, indeed," said her husband, jocosely; "trust your old mother for that. She's like a hen with a new brood; always ready to scratch with the first streak of day-light, and those that live with her may thank their stars, if she lets them sleep as long as that. Ten chances to one she has you all up-by candle-light." "Now don't talk so, father. You know I never hurry any one up, unless it's for their own good; though, how folks can bear to lie a-bed after ' sun- up,' I can't see for my life. For my part, if I've got any thing to do, I want the day before me. Ready, Mary?"        -  ,/X   196      WINE OR WATER. "Yes, mother; good night, all." "Stop, a minute, child. Hadn't you better get her a glass of your anniseed, mother? It can't hurt her, and it may do her good. She 's seemed kinder nervous all day. Have 'some, Mary. It'll make you sleep like a log." "And then if I should turn over on baby, father - what then? The poor thing would be ' kilt en- tirely.' No, no," as Mrs. Irwin went to the pantry, "you needn't get it mother. I don't need it, and if I did I couldn't swallow it. Its too sickish. Good night, once more." "I wish you would take some of it, Mary. But- if you won't, why, there's an end of it. You never did like to take medicine; used to say, when you was a child, you'd as lief be sick as to be forever dosing. You must help me remember, though, to put up a bottle for you, to-morrow morning, to take home. This last baby doesn't seem so rugged as the others were. I'm afraid it's going to be ' col- icky,' and there 's nothing better to keep that off, than this cordial of mine; and the beauty of it is, it can't do any hurt." "Can't do any hurt"--her anniseed cordial! What was -it, but New England rum, with barely herbal taste enough to give it a medicinal name. Bottle after bottle haid the well-meaning grand- mother brought up. to Pleasant View, one and per- haps two, with the advent of every baby, which   DROWNING SORROW.      '197 bottles Mrs. Parkman had regularly, as soon as the days of cradle-hood were over, emptied into the back-yard, washed, rinsed and sealed up with tomato-catsup or pepper-sauce, or horse-radish. Never had a drop touched the lips of her children. "' Mrs. Irvin had seen enough of the perils of alcohol to be timid about using it as a beverage. Her daughter had not lived a twelvemonth in the city, before she had seen enough to be resolute against using it even as a medicine.  And now as she as- cended with weary steps the narrow stairs that led to her chamber, that chamber where she had slept and dreamed in the days of girlhood, she shud- dered; yes, felt cold chills run over her, at the very thought of feeding her innocent child with the fla. vored rum. "Cordial," she murmured; " cordial! it should be marked as poison; and with that ban upon it's name be kept from every home." "You needn't wait, mother," as the old lady after turning down the bed-clothes, shaking up the pillows, and spreading on an extra blanket, offered to hold the baby while Mary undressed, "It's chilly up here; just put her in the bed. I won't be but a minute." But Mrs. Irvin persisted in srauggling the baby in her apron, and walking to and fro with it; and even after she had placed it beside her daughter and cov- ered them both up, found several things to do about   198'      WINE OR WATER. the room. She tried the windows, to make sure their was no draft; she took up the towels one by one, and put them back again; re-arranged the chairs, drew the light-stand nearer to the bed, and set the match-safe on it, and finally unfolded a blanket and hung it on the foot-post, in case they should need more covering in the night. "O, if she would only go," thought Mrs. Parkr man, as with every nerve strained to its utmost ten- sion, she watched the tip-toe movements. For the first time in life, she was impatient of her mother's presence. Alas!.alas! There are sorrows in this life in which the soul, instead of craving sympathy, asks only solitude. She was gone at last, though: the well-meaning, though rather fidgety and over solicitous woman. Mrs. Parkman lifted her head and listened till she heard the kitchen-door shut too; then she fell back, and from her burdened heart came up the cry, ".My God! my God I - can I bear it-- can I bear it?" i And then the tears so long restrained streamed down her cheeks and rilled upon her bosom. But motionless as death she lay there, till the measured breathing of her baby assured her that the little one had forgot all its troubles. Carefully then did she withdraw her sheltering arm, and with noiseless motions edge herself farther and farther from it, till she slid down upon the carpet. Assuring herself the door was tight, she began pacing the room in   DROWNING SORROW.      199 her naked feet, beating her bosom with her clenched hands, and saying softly, but O how mournfully, i, Can I bear it - can I bear it?" Bear it! you poor suffering thing! Yes, you can bear it. Though my heart bleeds for-you, I tell you so. Since the day that Eye left Eden there has been a curse on wifehood, a curse which now and then an angel in some happy case lifts up, but which too often clings and fetters, till we ask of God, not hope on earth, not bliss in heaven, but only rest in the grave. Her feet and hands grew purple and cold, and chills crept under her night-gown. She seemed not to notice them, though, but only kept up that rapid march, that nervous tattoo, and that mournful wail. Steps upon the stair-case startled her. She listened an instant, and then bounded into bed. They came nearer. She knew them too well. How often had she listened for them and thought them full of music. Now they seemed like'a dirge. Mr. Parkman entered the room slowly, and stood a moment with his. hand upon, the latch. Perhaps he was listening for sobs--perhaps for reproaches. He heard neither, and seemingly reassured, came on, and put his lighted candle on the stand. A moment he halted irresolute, then bent over the bed. For the first time in their wedded lives, his wife's face was turned from him. He groaned, and shame and contrition were in the anguished tone. Very ;/   200      WINE OR WATER. gently he drew down the bed-clothes. But the wet face was smothered in the pillows. "/Mary." There was no reply. "Mary- Mary-will you not even let me tell you how it was?" "Not to-night, Aleck; not to-night." The words were moaned rather than spoken, and further utter- ance checked by sobs. For an hour or more the husband paced the room in the path his wife had made. Then he quietly undressed and lay down beside her; but there was no kiss, no good night, and no sleep for either. In the bustle of getting away the next morning, Mrs. Parkman's pale face and swollen eyes escaped notice, while her closely drawn veil screened her from any curious glances on the boat. Very thank- ful was, she to find herself once more at home, though she could not help contrasting her present feelings with those that filled her heart when she crossed its threshold the week before. There was much to do on that Monday morning and afternoon, and what with getting the children off to school, putting away their holiday clothes, helping Maggie sweep, dust and cook, she found no time for reflection. Not until eight o'clock in the evening could she settle herself down to quiet, serious thought. But then, a full sense of her fear- ful situation rushed over her, and the sewing she   DROWNING SORROW.       201 had taken up mechanically, dropped from her hands, and she bowed her head upon her knees, and thought, and thought till her brain seemed to whirl, till her senses seemed to- be leaving her. Aleck was in the garden at work. It was his custom moonlight nights to employ himself there, as his business left him but little leisure in the day. But if any one had noticed him on this particular evening, they would have seen him oftener leaning on his spade than using it to delve. The clock struck the hour of retiring. He drop - ped the hoe he had just taken, and without stopping- to put either it or the spade in their places, hurried in with a nervous step. His wife had risen and stood with the lamp in her hand. It was their cus- tom and had always been, to go together to the bed- side of their several children before withdrawing to their own room. She went towards the stairs now. Her husband followed her. They went first to the bed-room that had been added to the nursery, to meet their want of room. Their twin boys, Willie and Harrie, lay as usual, asleep in each other's arms, and a smile was softening the curves of each pair of cherry lips. Mrs. Parkman placed her hand tenderly on their foreheads, and kissed their cheeks, and then tucked up the bed-lothes as only a mother can. Mr. Parkman also drqw his hand tenderly over their glossy curls, and Bent and kissed them. Then they went to the nursery, and stood beside   202      WINE OR WATER. the cot of little Rose, smoothing down the golden ringlets that lay tangled on the pillow, and pressing their lips to her half parted ones. Then to the trundle-bed where Nattie and Aleck were tumbling about after the nature of such young children when their play had been too wearisome. Mrs. Parkman quietly handed her husband the lamp while she straightened the rumpled clothes and lifted the half naked little fellows on to their pillows. Then they both bent down and kissed them, and went silently back to the dining-room, where in her cradle lay the six weeks old baby-girl, the nurslingy of the flock. The mother took her up with that soft, gliding motion which only a woman accustomed for years to the care of infants, can achieve. She held the tiny form an instant to her breast, and then laying one little cheek against her husband's lips, she said plaintively yet pleadingly, "For their sakes, Aleck, if not for mine,"- she could not complete the sentence; she had no need to, though, for he understood all she would have said, and bowing his head upon her shoulder, exclaimed, "I will-I will, Mary; I promise you it shall not happen again. Trust me, O trust me. For twelve years I never yielded." He broke down here and they sobbed together. Afterwards, as they sat there by the dying embers, he told her all. It was no common tempt- ation. Again and again had Mason and others of   DROWNING SORROWS.       203 his neighbors and associates, when he met them in the corner groceries, where he went to purchase his provisions, offering him a brandy-punch or a gin- sling, or a glass of porter; but he had always turned from them with a loathing stomach, hardly conscious, though, if the truth be told, that it was a fastidious taste rather than a nice sense of morality, that warded off the temptation. But a draft of rare, old wine, sparkling in a cut-glass goblet, and offered too, by an old friend, whom he had not met for years, that was another thing. His senses were captivated - there was beauty in the- crimson and ambor rills, as they flowed from the chased neck of the decanter --there was a subtle fragrance drifting from each drop- there was a memory of racy flavors and spicy sweetness, and there was the voice of friendship too, urging him for "' auld lang syne," to pledge himself anew in the rich, luscious liquor. Steeped in the aroma that fluttered up from the brimming glass, his brain grew dizzy, he said, and he yielded, forgetting in the extatic tumult of a moment,. that shame and misery and a fearful future are the curse of every sin, "But it has warned me, lMary; been perhaps, a timely lesson. Until then I thought I could taste at pleasure, and be safe. Now, I know that only in total abstinence lies my security, and knowing my danger, think you, darling, I -will hereafter run a risk? No, no,' and he drew her to him and sealed the promise on her lips. -   204      W INE OR WxATER. That night Mrs. Parkman slept on her husband's arm, and soundly, too; and though there could never be again that perfect trust in him which had made her married life so beautiful, she became in time as cheerful as of old, and often it seemed to her was happier than before, as men who have escaped drowning know better how to prize life than those who have never been in peril. Happily for her present peace, the future wore a veil she could not, lift. Mine be the quivering hand that draws it now aside. It was a pretty picture - the kitchen of Pleasant View, on that bright June morning; so cool, shady and neat. It was Saturday, and Mrs. Parkman and Maggie had, as usual, been up betimes, that the extra work might be out of the way before it was time to prepare for dinner. The baking was all done, and that all comprehended considerable; for their family was now of a size to make large demands upon the culinary skill of both " mother" and "help." Upon one of the newly scoured shelves of the pantry stood a long row of currant, custard and rhubarb pies; on another, a jar of yet warm cookies, and a pan of brown, puffy nut-cakes, while crowded in upon the plates and platters of a third, stood round pans of real, old-fashioned, Connecticut loaf-cake, light, spicy and rich. Upon the mould- ing board, covered W ith clean towels, steamed up   DROWNING SOrOW.       205 the fragrance of two ample sheets of biscuit, and half a dozen loaves of bread, while an enormous pan of genuine rye and Indian was yet smothered in the large, brick oven, flanked, too, if the truth be told, by two of similar size, in one of which an Indian pudding bubbled up its yellow tides, while the other was heavy with the Sunday dinner of pork and beans. The floor was yet damp with its thorough Satur- day mopping, while the windows, freshy washed, were hung with clean, white curtains, which flut- tered gracefully to and fro, in the summer breeze. One of them was shaded by morning-glories, whose graceful festoons were yet fair with their open blos- soms, while the other had for draping a thrifty rose- vine, a slip from that one between the parlor win- dows, which Marion had planted thirteen years before; a beautiful and fragrant thing it was, too, with its heavy clusters of green and half-open buds, and  sweet-scented, full-blown roses. Upon the mantle, at each end, stood a tumbler of flowers - pinks, violets, and snowy lilies, with here and there a rose mixed in; while upon the little stand, beside Maggie's work-basket was a pitcher of ribbon grass and sweet clover, with a -single crimson peony, the last one of the garden, nestling in the centre. Mrs. Parkman stood at one of the white: tables, stuffing a leg of lamb, one of her husband's favorite dishes, and about which she was so particular that   206      WINE OR WA TER. she rarely delegated its preparation to Maggie. The latter was at the other table, putting the finishing touches to the brass candle sticks and brittania lamps, which were destined soon to glisten on the mantle, beside the flowers, and she said, "It shouldn't be her fault, either, if they did n't take the shine off of them, too." Rose, now a womanly little girl in her ninth year, sat upon the threshold of the door that led into the shed, shelling some early peas, the pods of which, Aleck and Nattie were appropriating to their favorite pastime, which was the building of zig-zag fences, in miniature imitation of those upon grandfather's farm, every once in a while, though, receiving a tempo- rary check in their glee, by the warning words of Maggie, that they must remember "to pick up every one of them soon, and put them in the swill- pail, for she was n't going to have her shed littered up on a Sunday." Willie and Harrie were at work in the garden, and little Lew toddling beside them, while the baby was asleep in the darkened bed- room. In short, everything was just as it should be, and as it always is in a well ordered New England home on the forenoon that finishes up the week's labors, and prepares the household to properly enjoy the rest and quiet of the dawning Sabbath. Sud- denly the twins rushed in, their pretty faces all aglow with heat and exercise, while their hands and clothes betokened the character of their labors.   DROWNING SORROW.       207 "We've finished," they shouted with one voice. "Got all through, mother. Your pepper-bed is as clean as grandma's, and the beets are all weeded, and the alleys scraped. We can -go, now, can't we?" "Where, boys?" "Down to the little river, mother. Father said we could." "Did father say so?" she spoke anxiously, rather than as if she doubted them. "I can't bear to have you go there. Only last week there was a little boy nearly drowned there - would have been quite if a man hadn't happened to be passing." "But he was diving, mother. We ain't going to do that, nor even try to swim; only going to wade, and that's such fun; " and they made motions on the floor as though their little bare feet were even then paddling in the cool waters. "Well, be very careful and not go out too far, boys - won't you, now? and mind and get home in time for dinner, too. And wash your faces-and hands first: Why, you're like little niggers, most." "O, no, we ain't, mother; their black won't wash off, and ours will; come on, Will, and wash quick, then. There, will we do, now?" "Hardly, hardly; " and Mrs. Parkman smiled at their streaked flesh, for in their hurry they had only used water enough to dilute instead of wash off the dirt. "I cap hardly find a place to kiss, yet," C v    *,   208      WiNE OR WATER. T IThere is one; " and Harrie tossed off an auburn lock from his high forehead. "The dirt didn't get up there;;" and he presented the fair spot to her lips. She kissed it warmly, and then smoothed down the tangled hair, and turned to Willie, who had also, as he said, " hunted up a clean place." "And now, good-by, darlings;" and she went with them to the door, and even down into the garden-path. "You'll mind what I told you, won't you, boys?" "O, yes, mother, we always do;-" and by some impulse, as it were, they simultaneously turned back and hugged her closely, while she, forgetting the dirt, kissed both 'pairs of lips. Warm, warm lips they were - lips that could kiss back again - when next she kissed them - cold- cold - cold ; lips that knew not a mother's from a stranger's kiss." "I am sorry Mr. Parkman told them they might go," she said, as she re-entered the kitchen; " some- how, I never can feel easy when I know they've gone down to that 'little river;' there's been so mnany children drowned there, since I moved into town. I sometimes wish it was dried up, entirely. There, Maggie,"' shoving the bake-pan into the centre of the table, and covering it with a clean cloth, "I must leave you to -do up the rest of the chores, and go to work on those trowsers, or I shan't get them finished; and if it's as warm to- morrow as to-day they'll be uncomfortable with   DROWNING SORROW.       209 their cloth ones." And she washed her hands, thok off her baking-apron, and replaced it by one of neat, dark gingham, smoothed down her ever glossy hair, and brqught her work-basket from the dining-room. Two hours passed away. Mr. Parkman was busy at his desk. A bill had been sent in, the items of which did not correspond exactly with his own memorandum, and with knitted brows he was seeking to reconcile the difference. A little boy bounded in all at once, all out of breath, and with a face white as death. "Mr. Parkman - O, Mr. Parkman!" and he grasped his garments; "two of your boys are drowned." Busy with the account, the man heard without heeding. But as his coat-skirts were pulled violent- ly a second time, he turned about suddenly, and ex- claimed wildly, as though waking from a terrible dream; "what's that you said, boy-what was it?" and he laid both hands on the child's shoulder, with such a quick, sharp touch, that he winced beneath it. , "Two of your boys are drowned  " "My boys -good God I - where- which one? -0, O 1 " and the strong man for an instant was weak as if struck by palsy, and clung to the desk for support. "Mr. Parkman," It was one of the clerks who           ;, .     210      WINE OR WATER. had come into the office on an ordinary errand. ' But what's the matter, sir? what is it?" to the child. "His boys are drowned - Willie and Harrie." "Willie and Harrie Parkman drowned -where?" '"In little river; O, come quick, somebody, and help get them out;" and he ran away, The alarm spread like lightning through the building, aye, and through the town, for those fair twin boys were knownt all over it, and in a few minutes a crowd was hastening to the spot where their playmate had watched them "go down." Mr. Parkman never knew how he reached there; his first conscious act being to divest himself of his clothing and plunge in the stream. "There," and Mrs. Parkman held up to Maggie's admiring eyes, one pair of trousers all completed, "Willie's are done, and now I must make myself busy over Harrie's," and she hung the finished ones on the back of the chair that held her basket. She was threading her needle, '"Mercy," and she dropped it, ;' who is that racing over the garden so," as a boy came flying over flower beds and shrubs, having leaped the-fence at the corner. "Why, John Mason - what!," "O, your boys, your boys, Mrs. Parkman," and he gasped for breath " drowned - O, they are - they are." * l One wild shriek echoed through the house, and 4   DROWNING SOAROW.       2" then Mrs. Parkman darted down the walk, followed by Maggie and the children. Neighbors and strangers stared as they saw the bare-headed group dash by, and never, never could forget the whiteness of the mother's face nor the agonizing cries that rang from her blue lips. I have no heart to tell of the scene beside the river, no heart, though I have only to close my eyes to see again that frenzied mother, kneeling on the extremest edge of the shelving bank, her hands clasped till the nails entered they palms, pressed'con- vulsively against her heart, and her eyes dilated to twice their size, peering steadfastly down into the turbid water, a single, half-suppressed shriek every few moments quivering through her closely set teeth; to see that father, pale, yet calmA with the restraint of a strong will, diving here and there, groping through the thick, dark waves for the ice- cold forms of his twin-boys; to see the little de- voted band of stout-hearted fishermen stretch their seine from point to point, and slowly, steadily haul it in; to see the blended lines of hope and anxiety that were so rivetted upon each face as the result was waited for, and the silent tears that flowed from every eye, and the terrible despair that circled every mouth when only a stray fish, a decayed bough, or some matted grass was the poor harvest. Fishing for little boys! O, there is agony in the very thought- how much more in the memory-   212      WINE OR WATER. how much more -- O, I have seen it and I know, in the actual labor I "O, is it weed, or fish, or floating hair." Something drifted against Mr. Parkman's naked shoulders. He swung  his arms around -his fingers tangled in a slimy mat - they slipped and touched upon a cold, wet face I What a cry that was that then rung through the air. How madly the men in the boats tugged at their oars, and how wildly leaped into the water, and grasped both the fainting father and his armful of recovered treasures!  Wading beyond his depth, Harrie had gone down first. As he came up, he had seized the outstretch- ed hand of Willie, and both had gone down to- gether; gone down, and gone to sleep as of old with their arms about each other's neck. The four hours of torturing suspense were over, and those parents and that group had known many a year which scarcely seemed as long. I More thoughtful than many, Mr. Parkman's partner had immediately, upon ascertaining the truth of the little boy's story, sprang upon the fleet- est horse in the city and galloped to High Bank. The noon boat up the river had been stopped by the frantic motions of groups at that landing, and Mr. and Mrs. Irvin and William and Marion were thus driven up to the cottage a few moments' after the   DROWNING S OR-OW.       213 stricken family had entered it with their beautiful dead, It was well, too, for there was much to do, and that much, needed other than stranger hands. Ye who have seen the breath flutter for the last time on your darling's lips, after weeks of anxious watching, after many days of preparation for the solemn moment, and known how terrible was your grief even then, ye may fancy what those parents felt who had not an hour of warning, The father patted his boys glossy locks and left -them in the garden amongst their flowers; the mother kissed their warm lips and watched them bound away to a longed-for sport. When next he touches their young heads, there is death-slime upon the hair; when next she presses their fair faces there is death- foam upon the mouth. From the moment of the recovery of the bodies till she had crossed the threshold of her home, Mrs. Parkman kept up with an unnatural -calmness, but then her mother-heart- gave way, and from that time until the next morning she lay in fainting fits. Mr. Parkman had sunk into a sort of stupor imme- diately upon being drawn into the boat, and did not come out of it until he found himself once more at home, that home which had seemed that morning the cheeriest spot on earth to him, but which now lay in the shadow of a terrible sorrow. Breaking frenziedly from those who would have   214      WINE OR WATER, placed him on the lounge, he rushed into the garden and to that flower bed where he had parted from his boys. Throwing himself on his knees, he hid his face in the fragrant pinks and groaned aloud. Had his well-meaning but mistaken friends and neighbors but left him there awhile in silence and solitude, all would have been well, for his naturally kind heart would have prompted him before long to minister to the sorrows of his poor wife and children, and in the effort to comfort them he would have comforted himself, blunted the keenest edge of grief by momentary forgetfulness. But they hovered about him continually, kneeling by his side, leaning over him, laying their hands on him, and all the time striving to comfort him with those trite words of human sympathy and those trite texts of Scripture which at such sore moments are so maddening to the crushed and bleeding heart. "It's all for the best " one would say, and then go on with a long string of the crimes and sufferings which might have befallen the poor little ones had they been spared to manhood. Did that comfort him then? Afterward it might and perhaps did, for no true father would ever call back his angels from the heavenly land to this sinful world again; but then, then, he had but one thought, they were dead, DEAD, and O, is not that a terrible word when we first apply it to those whom we have loved with all the intensity of our nature. Dead. Dead. We   DROWNING SORROW.       215 cannot reason then ; we can only feel, feel that they are gone, and gone so far that we cannot call them back. "You take it too hard, my friend," another would say, and then run on with the sayings of physicians that death by drowning is the easiest one that can befal a mortal, and tell him to think what they might have suffered had they died of wasting dis- ease or cruel burns, or crushing accidents. Did that comfort him then? Ah! too lately had he groped in the dark, cold water after them; too lately felt their slimy hair within his hands. An easy death! Perhaps so. But how felt those little ones when they rose for the last time, and cried so beseechingly to their playmate to rescue them; thoughts of their father and mother, and brothers and sisters, and old grand-parents, and home, and school, and church, and everything that made life beautiful, crowding into that second of time. The father thought of this, and it was comforting him to tell him then, they died an easy death. ' Bear it like- a Christian," another would say, as though to be a Christian is to be a stoic; as though a man's heart must put off its humanity because he believes in God, and Christ, and the Gospel. "A dreadful trial, but sent for some wise pur- pose," said another. Ah, with all his faith, and at that time Aleck Parkiman had faith, too, he could   216      WINE OR WATER. not then feel--could not have said from   his heart, 6c Behind a frowning Providence, He hides a smiling face. " One thought submerged every other- they were dead, his first-born; dead without a warning, with. out time to bid them a good-bye, without time to give them a parting kiss. Ye who have parted from your loved ones in health and strength, and never looked on them again till the breath of life had fled, or never heard from them till they were coffined and buried, ye may guess of the bitter sor- row that now rent his heart as it were into a thou- sand pieces. "They have gone to Heaven -they're little angels now." Divine truth it was, but it fell coldly on that father's ear. Heaven seemed a great way then from that lovely home, and angels were not half as dear to him as those two little boys. Failing to comfort him, they coaxed him to go in out of the night dews that were then falling. But he shook his head mournfully and said softly, 4"I cannot, I cannot." "What shall we do with Aleck," asked Mr. Irvin of Marion, as he called her from the bedside of the poor mother. "He will catch his death of cold out there on the damp ground, and he was four hours in   DROWNING SORROW.       217 the water they say. He won't stir for one of us, and it's now going on to nine o'clock." She thought a moment, and then with woman's quick tact said to him, "send Rosabella, Here, darling, run out to your father, and take him by the hand, and tell him to come in; tell him you want somebody to put you to bed and hear your prayers." The little girl went, alone too, for Marion kept back those who would have followed. Mr. Parkman did not hear her light steps, and only knew of her approach when he felt her little clinging arms about his neck, and heard her say, "it's me, father; your little Rose." "Darling, darling," and he folded her to his heart, and wet her face with tears, the first that had fallen from his aching eyes. "r I'm sleepy, father, and tired, and mother's sick, and every one so busy. Please go in and undo my clothes for me, and hear me say my prayers; won't you?" "Yes, darling, yes. I have been very thought- less, very. So much to do and me out here. Come, Rose, I will go now," and he took her hand. They went in by the kitchen. It was a dreary looking place; you would hardly have thought it the same one the morning sunshine had shown on so cheery. It had been their custom for some -time to lay the breakfast and dinner table there, instead of in the dining-room, to save Maggie steps. It   218      WINE OR WATER. stood there now, just as she had finished spreading it at the moment of the fearful tidings; a melancholy sight, with its untouched plates, its shining knives and forks, and its brilliant glasses. The new bread, freshy sliced, had grown hard and crusty; the ice had melted in the pitcher, and the water grown stale and warm; the lettuce so green and crisp when set there, lay wilted and yellow in its dish, while the butter-plate which Maggie was in the act of cover- ing, when she left it so suddenly, stood yet on the corner of the table, its oily tides loathsome with dead and half-buried flies. Two unsnuffed tallow candles burnt upon the mantle and shed a grim light on the hearth below, where stood the dinner- kettles with their cold, water-soaked peas and pota- toes. A fire had been kindled in the stove, but it did not burn up brightly, only lay and smothered itself as it were, in the grey ashes. The oven doors, -i   half open, revealed the lamb roasted to a burn, and shrunken and dried. A strange woman was filling a, jug from the tea-kettle, her hand trembling so that half the water ran on to the floor. A strange man was bringing in fresh wood, and instead of put- ting it into the box, he dropped it down on the floor, scattering chips, and moss, and dirt. Mrs. Irvin sat in her daughter's low rocker, with little Lew asleep on her lap, and covered up with her apron, and she was talking in a low voice to a " neighbor woman " who sat beside her, mechanically folding-up the fin-   DROWNING SORROW.       219 ished pair of trousers, and gathering up the scraps and rolling them up with the other pair. Maggie was walking the floor, trying to quiet the baby, whom they had evidently been trying to feed, for upon the white table stood a little tin cup, with a spoon in it, and close by, the sugar bowl and cream pitcher. Mr Parkman took in all these details at a glance, and passed through into the dining-room. A single lamp burned on the table, revealing half a dozen "neighbor men" sitting idly about, and eyeing curiously every one that went out and in. Upon the lounge lay Nattie and Aleck fast asleep, a half- eaten cookey in the hand of one, while the other grasped an untasted nut-cake. Lights were bright in the bed-room, and a confused murmur came from the half-closed door. "I want to kiss mother," said Rose. "Not to-night, dear." She sobbed -"I can't sleep if I don't, father," and tears settled on her face. He went in with her. Three or four women made way for him and the child to pass to the bedside. Mrs. Mason sat on the bed back of the sufferer, chafing one hand. Marion stood at the front, pour- ing camphor into the palm of the other. The old family physician was at the head applying hartshorn to her nostrils, while one of his students was wring- ing linen cloths out of ice-water, and applying them *?ia    220      WINE OR WATER. to the forehead and temples. Wedged in at the foot of the bed were two women, rubbing the cold feet, and whispering, "I wish she would hurry with that jug." Mr. Parkman lifted Rose and held her up to the white face. But the child did not kiss it, only looked at the doctor with a frightened glare, and -said tearfully " is she going to die, too?" "I guess not, Rosy. fhe is only faint. Kiss her quick, there's a dear; and he withheld the bottle an instant. She kissed, and her father sat her down, and with a groan that went to the hearts of all, turned away. The parlor door was open. He could not help looking in as he passed. Two women sat by the table sewing on something white, while two others stood by, one of them measuring off soft, snowy rib- bon, and the other holding up a couple of pairs of new stockings, boys' size. Glossy linen sheets, and fair ruffled pillow cases, and heavy damask napkins lay in a pile on the piano. Mr. Parkman saw them all and knew, as well as though he had been told, that they were making the shrouds and preparing for the funeral. He went up stairs, Rose clinging to him with a nervous grasp. A man opened the door of the front chamber as they passed. He looked flustered as he saw them and said hurriedly, " please don't come in yet,- they ain't laid out-they're busy takling the casts."   DROWNING SORROW.       221 Mr. Parkman made no reply, but hurried along into the nursery. He undressed Rose in the dark- ness, heard her prayers, and lifted her into her little bed. "Don't go down, father; O, please, don't. It's so lonesome up here." She did not say she was afraid, but he knew by her tones that she was, and he could not blame her for feeling so. It was the first time she had ever seen death, and it had' come now so suddenly, and terribly, that he wondered not she trembled to be left alone in the gloom of that silent place. "Go to sleep, quick, then, darling,- and I will wait," and he sat down on the bed beside her and held her hands. It seemed to him the child would never close her eyes. Again and again he would strive to withdraw his hand, and as often she would clench them with a firmer hold. Agonizing  thoughts swept continually through his brain. Only last night, his twin boys slept in the adjoining bed-room, soundly, sweetly, their hearts beating the quickstep of health and hope. Only last night I  And now --" O, I cannot, cannot bear it; it is too much, too much." and his strong frame was convulsed, and his blood seemed turn- ing to ice. The child slept at length, and he left- iher to go down. As he passed the door of the front chamber he tried the knob. It would not turn. He knew   222      WINE OR WATER. they were shrouding them, and with a fresh pang in his heart he groped for the banister and hurried away. The parlor looked dreary enough, the chairs littered with the bonnets and shawls of the neigh- bors; snips of white cloth on the carpet, a loose roll of wrapping paper on the hearth, and scissors and thimbles, and spools of thread on the table. He could not sit down there, nor in the dim dining- room, only in the kitchen, which had now assumed a less desolate aspect, could he bear to stop. Mag- gie had finally got the babe to sleep, and Mrs. Irvin had succeeded in getting Lew down, and the two had been busy clearing up things. The fire now burned up brightly, and the candles glowed cheer- ily. He drew up a chair to the stove, "Cold, Aleck," asked Mr. Irvin, anxiously. "A little," but as he spoke, an ague fit seemed to pass over him, and he shook violently from head to foot, groaning as he did so. Mr. Irvin called in the doctor. The latter looked at him a moment, felt his pulse, bade him hold out his tongue, and then shaking his head dubiously, said to the old gentleman, "get his feet into hot water as quick as you can, and give him something warm and stimulating to drink, and then put him to bed." "Anything serious the matter with him, doctor," asked Mr. Irvin in a whisper, as he followed him to the dining-room,   DROWNING SORROW.       223 "Grief, grief, sir- nothing more. He's taking it hard, too hard. You must give him something to drown his sorrow for awhile, or you'll have him in the "Retreat" before the week's out." "What?" "French brandy, if you have it. A pretty stiff glass too, as hot as he can drink it. All you can get down. Never mind," and he lowered his voice to an almost inaudible tone, "never mind how strong, so that it puts him to sleep." "That's the talk," said Mason, as Mr. Irvin went over there to see if he could borrow the brandy. That's just what I said in the beginning; nothing like a glass of good liquor when a body's in trouble., It's like the healing balm which the penitent Mary sent down for Aaron's head." Mason's ideas were somewhat confused, but he thought it incumbent on him to try and talk Scripture at such a solemn time, and as his Bible had been a sealed book to him for nearly a quarter of a century, it was not to be- won- dered at that he rather mixed up memories. "Yes, I've got some; pure, too; I sent to New York and got it of the importer. None of your vile apothecary mixtures for me.  See; the  genuine French seal; the best brand out," and he delivered over the bottle, believing, deluded man, all he said, little thinking that any New York Chemist "Might make as good "With green crabs, boiled in Brazil wood, And half a pmint of cedar,"   224      WINE OR WATER. *Adding, perhaps, a little capsicum, a few drops of aqua ammonia, an ounce or so of sweet nitre, a bit of terra japonica, and mayhap, a dash of vitriol. Mrs. Irvin was bathing the cold feet, and Maggie warming a pair of stout yarn stockings, when the old man returned. He soon prepared a glass, making it "good and strong." Here Aleck, here is something to warm you up." "' What is it, father." "Nothing that will hurt you, child. Only some French brandy." "French brandy I Take it away. I can't drink it." "But you must." "Must I Who said so?" "The doctor did. It'll warm you up, and put  you to sleep, and make you forget your troubles." "Will it? He spoke dreamily, and then rousing up, said firmly, "no, no. Give me laudanum, mor- phine- anything but that." '"The doctor said you must take this, Aleck, because you can sleep it off. Come, take it'down, like a man now. You've a hard day before you to-morrow, child, and you must get recruited some. Think of poor Mary and the children. Do now. It'll make you sleep - drown your sorrow. "Drown my sorrow! O, if it only would. My poor, poor heart, how it does ache," and he folded his hands tenderly over it, as though he would fain   DROWNING SORROW.       225 have taken it in his arms and, hushed its mute com- plainings. "Drink it, Aleck, drink it, my poor boy," and tears filled the furrows of the old man's cheeks. "You won't tell Mary? I promised her I would never, never touch the like." He was wavering now, longing to be freed from the cruel pain that stung his very vitals as it were. "No, boy, no. She'll never know it. Only this one glass just to quiet you, and drown your sorrow for the night." He drank it down-- drank 'it that time as men drink tinctures, drank it and went up in the spare chamber to bed. An hour afterwards his father-in-law looked in. He was sound asleep, he reported when he went down; a lie; the man was drunk -his sorrow drowned in brandy. O, the dreary morning after a day of death! Who that has mourned, does not remember the more than Sabbath stillness of the house, the vault- like chill that qven in the summer time comes up with its damp breath, the sickening smell of cam- phor that pervades every room, the ghastly light of the morning lamps, the faint yellow of the sunbeams as they straggle in through the closed blinds and close-drawn curtains, and more than all, the dull, heavy pain in one's forehead, and the weary sick- ness of the heart. *  *   .,      '   226      WINE OR WATER. Only by degrees did Mr. Parkman rouse out of the deep stupor which that glass of brandy had induced, but when at last he was fully awake, his sorrow returned with all its past intensity, and it seemed to him as though he could never live through the long hours of the dawning day. Lie still, he could not; so he rose and dressed and stole quietly out of the room. How still everything was. He stood and listened. Not a sound up stairs or down. He opened the door of the front chamber. One of his clerks lay asleep upon the floor, while William sat by the window with his head buried in his hands. If he heard the stealthy tread he did not seem to. On tip-toe the father went up to the bed, and with a quick, nervous movement, turned down the sheet. The camphor clothes were wet, showing that the watchers had not slumbered long. He removed them and gazed long and earnestly, and then put them back, and drew up the sheet. No sounds came from his white lips, but O, the anguish of his heart as he stood beside that bed. He fled at last precipitately from the room. Down stairs there was the same solemn hush. The parlor had been put in perfect order, and Mr. Irvin slept upon the sofa. In the dining-room, Natie and Aleck still lay asleep upon the lounge. The bed- room, too, was still as death, Mrs. Parkman having fallen into a natural sleep towards morning, and the doctor and neighbors having gone home. Marion   DROWNING   SORROW.     227 sat dozing 'in a rocking-chair beside her, while Mrs. Irvin had made herself a shake-down out of some comforters and blankets. No one was moving in the kitchen, but upon a table stood the bottle of brandy. The moment Mr. Parkman saw it, there came over him the memory of the last night's pow- erful potion, and of the blessed oblivion that it brought. And the tempter came. "If he ordered it last night, he surely would to-day, for if ever a man needed strength it is myself," and then he thought of the funeral and the hearse, and the car- riage with the mourners, and the grave, - the dark, narrow, cold grave, and the little coffins dropping slowly into it, and the dirt and stones rattling on their lids. O, if he had but thought a little further; lifted up instead of down, his tearful eyes, and saw the two new angels at the feet of Jesus! But, like too many, he dwelt only on his sorrow, and in frenzy strove to drown it, drown it in drink. But, to his credit, be it said, he drank like a guilty man, looking fearfully around lest some one should be stirring. He drank, andwhile the excite- ment lasted, he was strong, and astonished them all when they awoke, by the calmness with which he listened to them, as-they detailed the programme of the day. As soon as the weakness came again, and the tide of sorrow flowed, he took another stealthy draught, and yet another, and none suspected him. At noon, Fred and Essie came. The clear-sighted   228      WINE OR WATER. cousin no sooner looked upon the father than he knew something was wrong, and from that moment he watched him. But Aleck was wary as a maniac, and though he drank three times before the funeral, no one was witness. Those who saw him at the house, supporting so tenderly the trembling form of his crushed wife as she tottered up stairs, to look for the last time on her beautiful dead, and heard him speak so pityingly to the little children as they kissed the cold cheeks of their twin-brothers at the church, where, though the minister's voice faltered in his prayer and sermon, and the choir broke down in their last hymn, and the whole congregation burst into sobs as the little Sabbath school children came up the aisle, two by two, to take a last look at their mates-- their mates, who only a week before sang with them, and prayed with them, and recited the Gospel lesson, he sat so calm, never once withdraw- ing his arm from his wife's waist, or burying his head in his hand at the grave, where, though the mother fainted and the children cried in wild terror, and women turned pale and dropped on their knees, and strong men shivered, he seemed so sustained- those who saw him through that long afternoon of trial, marvelled at his strength, and wondered "how he could bear it so," and said, "verily he is a Christian." Little did they dream that he had drowned his sorrow in French brandy-that his calmness was   DROWNING SORROW.       229 but the excitement of semi-intoxication. Late at night Fred found him lifting the bottle to his lips. "Aleck." Only to-night, Fred. Think what I have gone through." "I do, I do, Aleck; but I think also of what is to come. Put it down now; now, while you can. O, Aleck, after all these years of restraint do not yield at last." "Only to drown my sorrow, Fred; just a little while, till I am stronger. O, Fred, Fred! think of - ray boys, my twin boys, my first-born-gone- gone - how can I bear it?" "As thy day is, so shall thy strength be, if thou wilt but trust Him. Aleclk, my heart bleeds for you, and yet I feel assured that if you will but be true to yourself, peace will come to you, after awhile-peace first and then joy. You will not, cannot always feel as you do now. God has not so made you. Alecl, I have loved you as a brother; as a brother, I warn you now to put down that glass. This sorrow you may drown by drinking it, but an hundred others will be borne up by the tide' that washes this one out." "Perhaps, you're right, Fred." He spoke sadly, so sadly that his cousin's heart ached for him, and he turned away to hide the tears that filled his eyes. When he looked back again, the bottle and glass were out of sight, and he was easy, thinking his   230      WINES OR WATER. words had been lain to heart. Alas, alas! he little knew that Aleck had first drained the tumbler, quieting the voice of conscience with the assurance that after to-night he would no longer seek to drown his sorrow. "  ./   CHAPTER   IX. UNDER    A C L O U D THE old clock on the wall struck eleven. "So late!" Asigh followed the words,- a long deep-drawn sigh - and then Mrs. Parkman dropped for a moment, the garments she was patching, and put her hands to her forehead with a nervous motion, as though she would quiet a sharp pang, or drive back a terrible thought. It was only for a moment, though; then her fingers were busy again with " needle, scissors and thread," and only two tremulous drops'upon her cheeks told how sharp had been the pang, or how terrible the thought. , Six years had passed since she so sadly laid her first born, her fair twin boys in their early grave. Years of trouble they had been'-too; you would o    232      WINE OR WATER. know it, i you only looked carelessly upon her. The blooming matron had withered into a pre- maturely aged woman.  She looked careworn, weary, and what was more touching, she looked sad. Her forehead had wrinkles which should have stayed away for a score of years; her cheeks were thin and pale ;? her eyes lacked lustre', and were swollen as though with frequent weeping, while her drooping chin and sternly compressed lips, told of a sorrow that might not be spoken. Her hair, still rich and glossy, was sadly streaked with silver, and no longer hung about her face in heavy curls, but was put back in plain, quaker-like bands. Even her dress showed plainly there had been a change in the aspect of her life. Her frock, a cheap, dark print at best, had been worn and -washed, till every figure was faded out, and though freshy starched and ironed, had yet a beggar-like look that was pain- ful to behold. She wore, too, a gingham instead of a black silk apron and a plain ruffle about her neck instead of a pretty boughten collar. The room in which she sat, it was the dining- room, wore not the same look that it had in other days. It was scrupulously neat, and yet" had that indescribable, shabby and cheerless aspect that tells so pitifully of something wrong. The carpet was faded and worn thin, and in many-places had been carefully darned. The curtains, though spotless as drifting snow and glossy with starch, were patched   -UNDER A CLOUD.       233 in a dozen or more spots, The copper-plate cover- ings to the lounge had been washed: till the once brilliant colors were blended into a pale yellow and dun brown. The cane seats had been worn entirely out of a couple of the chairs, and they had been re- bottomed with sheep-skins, while another couple had been repaired with listing deftly woven. There were no new volumes or fresh newspapers on the hanging shelves, but instead a few carefully pre- served school books and a bundle of cigars. The family Bible lay no longer upon the light-stand, but gathered dust upon the topmost shelf of the pantry, and you could not see, under the weekly pile of stockings and socks that lay in the work-basket, the well-thumbed pocket edition of the Holy Records, from which Mrs. Parkman read to her little ones whenever an opportunity offered. The astral lamp stood unfilled in the now-seldom opened parlor, and in its place- glimmered a cheap tallow dip, whose drippings upon the brightly scoured candle-stick, worried the housekeeper's mind as much as the feeble light troubled her eyes. The fire-place, in- stead of glowing as in former times with well-sea- soned hickory or mapl/,was dark and cheerless, only a few   slender/bits of sappy green wood smouldering in a little bed of warm ashes. The mantel was no longer beautiful with its winter bouquets of dried grasses, golden and purple amaranths, and fair, pearl-tinted- immortelles, but -I   234      WINE OR WATER. disfigured with cigar stands filled with twisted lighters, a wine glass, a tumbler with a tea-spoon in it, and a small, pear-shaped black bottle, which though labelled dyspeptic bitters, smelt stronger of Cognac than Comfrey. Everything was changed-- changed for the worse. A low, wailing, pitiful, only half-human, sound suddenly disturbed the intense silence of the house. An expression of intense anguish passed over Mrs. Parkman's face, and murmuring, " dear, dear, why will he always wake just at this time," she went hurriedly into the bed-room and returned with something on a pillow. Something I But what? If you had looked casually at it, you would have said it was an infant who had numbered perhaps three months of life. If you had looked closer, you would have shook your head mournfully and said, as had the neighbors many times, " it would be a mercy to see it die." Poor little one! A year and more had passed since its strangely-sounding wail first smote its mother's ears, and yet those little feet had never borne their weight; those little hands had never held a rattle; those fair blue eyes had never turned towards lamp or sunshine; those tiny lips had never smiled. Poor little one! Affection's pulses will never stir its heart, and only up in heaven will the veil be rent that shrouds its spirit.   UNDER A CLOUD.       235 Tenderly, very tenderly did Mrs. Parkman hold her idiot boy-to her bosom, and low and sweet were the words she sung to it; music, soft, lulling music, being the only sounds that seemed in the least to affect its broken slumbers. Her voice dropped suddenly, and a paleness as of death settled upon her face. She listened, O, how keenly. , The front door was banged open and slammed to violently, and then in boisterous tones some .one cried out, " halloa, in there! What in thunder ails the light! Open the door if you don't want a fel- low to skin his shins."- Mrs. Parkman hurried to throw open the door of the dining-room, saying as she did so, in a depre- cating way, "I didn't know the lamp had gone out.9 "And didn't care enough to see," was the rude answer, and the man who had made the outcry in the hall, came staggering into the quiet room. "Darkr as Egypt here," he muttered. "What in thunder do you burn such a thing as that for," and he snuff- ed the candle with his fingers, and scattered the soot all over the crowded basket of mending. "I'd like to know if you haven't a lamp in the house. .It's my opinion that I have seen one." "There is no oil to fill it," was the quiet answer. "No oil! Of course not I I wonder if I ever came home and didn't find something wanting. No  . -          I   236      WINE OR WATER. wood either, I should judge by the looks of the fire,"' and he rammed his boots into the half-charred sticks, "Why in thunder don't you get something that'll make a blaze. A pretty state of affairs, for a fellow to come home half frozen, and find neither light or fire. Havn't you got anything that'll burn." "Nothing, but a little pine kindling for morn- ing." "Well, let's have it." She knew too well to remonstrate, and with a sigh as she thought of the trouble there would be in the morning to start a fire with the green wood, she went into the kitchen and brought in the little bas- ket. Seizing it rudely, the man emptied it on to the smouldering fire, and then tearing up a newspaper he thrust it underneath, and was soon spatting his hands over the flames. "6 Anything to eat, or are you out of everything in that line," and he sneered. "I will get you something as soon as I can get the baby down." "What in thunder is he doing up at this time of night. Never did come home yet, but some one of the brats was squalling. Here, give it to me." She did not offer the pillow, for only on that could it be tended, but instead hugged it closer. "Give it to me," and he snatched it from her and began "jouncing" it in a way that would have   UNDER A -CLOUD.      237 made a well child cry, and which was absolute martyrdom to those crippled limbs. The babe shrieked, and those wild, unnatural shrieks pierced doors and windows, and would have frightened a passer-by. "You hurt him," and tears ran down the mother's cheeks. "Hurt him! What does he know  about being hurt, little fool that he is. I'd like to" he didn't finish the sentence, but from the way he thrust it into the waiting arms, his meaning was evi- dent, and indeed in that moment of frenzy, it was only the fear of the gallows that restrained him from dashing the idiot head against the wall. Gathering the child to her heart, Mrs. Parkman hurried up stairs with it. Entering the nursery, she said gently, cAre you awake, Rose." "Oh, yes, mother. What can I do for you?" and the daughter, now a lovely girl of fifteen, sat up straight in the bed. "I wish you would try and quiet the baby if you can. Do you suppose he will snuggle down to you if you sing to him? I have nursed him, and if you can get him asleep now, he will stay so till morn- ing." Rose took the little brother in her arms, and as she held his shapeless head to her face, she kissed its cheeks as tenderly as if he understood the caress. "Has he come home yet?" She whispered the words.   238      UNDER A CLOUD. ' Yes, dear." "Is he very bad?" "Very." Rose nestled :under the coverings, but not to sleep. Hurrying back to the dining-room; Mrs. Parkman went to the pantry and brought out some cold meat and bread and butter. The man looked at it a moment, and then brandishing the carving-knife fiercely, he exclaimed with an oath too terrible to repeat, " am I a beggar, woman, that you set such feed before me? Where's the steak I sent home?" "But I've no coals to broil it." !"Make some then. I know the charcoal isn't out. ' It was not, and out into the cold, dark wood-shed, the weary, frightened woman groped her way, and returning with a pan of coal, succeeded after awhile in broiling the steak. "Now take off those duds," and he shoved the work-basket on to the floor, scattering its contents pell-mell, " and lay the table in decent shape." She obeyed. A snowy cloth was unfolded and spread, and a china dining-plate anid shining knife and fork brought out. "Bring the salt," as he sat down. She brought it. "The castor."   WINE OR WATER.       239 She brought it. "Some pickles." She brought them. "Jelly." Up into the store-room she went, and returned with a glass. "Cranberry, pshaw," as he tasted it. "I want currant." She retraced her steps and brought it. "Now make me a stiff brandy punch, and then you may sit down and mope." She sat down immediately. "Did you hear," wheeling his chair around. "I did." "Then obey." "Never that."  She spoke firmly. You would hardly have believed such a tone could have issued from lips so white. He doubled his fist and made a motion as if to strike. Her eyelids closed, her cheeks and lips grew whiter, but she neither stirred or spoke. He looked at her a moment, and then bursting into a hoarse laugh, exclaimed, " tragic, by Jove I You'd better go on the stage, Mary: you'd bring down the house with your attitudes," and he went himself to the mantel and took down the black bottle, and concocted his sling. "Now, I  guess I'll go it," he muttered, as he seated himself again at the table and attacked the steak.   240      WINE OR WATER. Look at him as he sits there! Do you recognize him? If you met him elsewhere, would you sup- pose those matted locks, those bleared eyes, those bloated cheeks, those turgent lips belonged to the face of Aleck Parkman? never. Look at him and then at the miniature that lays in the bureau drawer, at the portrait that hangs over the mantel in the parlor, and say if they be truthful? AhJ! They show him as he was before he had drowned his manhood; that face before you shows him as he is now, a terror to his wife and children. Only from the way in which he enters that cottage at mid- night; only because he treats that pale, quivering woman beside him as only a husband dare treat a woman, can you believe it is really Aleck Parkman. Do you ask, why this change, so sad, so terrible! Smell his breath I "There; you may have what's left," he pointed derisively to the well-picked bone. "Eat quick, too, and then be off to bed, for we've got to start for High Bank, bright and early." Mrs. Parkman dropped into the chair she had just left, and gasped as if she were fainting. Recover- ing herself by a strong effort, she asked wildly, "why- why - is Nattie --  " she couldn't finish the question. "Dead," said he coarsely-" no, nor like to be.  5Whoever knew a man with a dozen brats to lose one of them. l/at's a streak of good luck he can't   UNDER A CLOUD.       241 hope for. No, it isn't Nat that's in trouble, but your cursed old fool of a father." "Aleck "- Mrs. Parkman had recovered herself immediately on hearing of her boy's welfare, and she spoke sternly now. "Aleck, stop that. You may call me and the children what you will, but my old, gray-haired father and mother shall be respected." "Respected!" and he sneered.   "Well, I'll respect him then- little cause though for respect when he's brought us all down to beggary." "Beggary; what do you mean,"' she was gasping again. "Aha! I thought Pd touch you. Yes, beggary." "But how, how." "Why he's gone and put his name to one of old Dan Forbes' notes, and now his whole place has got to slide for it, old fool that he was." This last sentence was muttered, and another also, to the effect that he had needed a conservator for years. "My poor, dear father," and Mrs. Parkman wrung her hands. "It will kill him to leave High Bank; he was born and married, and has lived all his life there. What will become of him." "Rather say, what'll become of us and our regi- ment of young ones. To happen just now, too, when I was depending on him to raise eight hundred for me before the first of January. Yes, eight hun- dred dollars, madam," seeing the wild look with   242      WINE OR WATER. which she regarded him. "I owe that much and heaven only knows how lhuch more; but that's ia notes, and must be paid in forty days or I must fail; yes,fail, and then what's before us but beg- gary- yes, beggary, madam- that's one prospect. Glorious, isn't it," and he laughed a laugh,; that al- most curdled the blood in his listener's veins. He was too much intoxicated for anything like rational conversation on the situation of his affairs, and overwhelmed by the doubled blow which had fallen on her, her father's loss and their own debts, Mrs. Parkman wisely hushed the questionslthat rose to her lips, and taking up the candle went into the bedroom. Her husband lingered long enough to lift the bottle to his lips and drain its contents, and then following her was soon buried in the deep, un- natural sleep of the habitual drunkard.  But not once, during the few hours that yet re- mained of the night, did his poor wife close her eyes. Memories of the past and bodings as to the future, kept her not only wide awake, but so worried, that at times her brain seemed reeling, and her senses flitting         i God help you, Mary Parkman? The bitterness of death would be sweetness compared to what you now suffer! Little did your husband dream of the woe he was bringing on you and your little ones, or of the ignominy he was drawing down on his own head,   UNDER A CLOUD.       243 whenhe lifted again and again the glass that was to drow his sorrow. One glimpse into the future, and he would have dashed it from him. But strong in his own esteem, like millions of others, he drank and drank, saying each time, this shall be the last. "Do not fear for me, Fred," he said to his faithful cousin, as they parted on the Tuesday after the funeral of his twins. "I will do as you have told me; bear patiently my sorrow, and trust in time and my heavenly Father for the healing of the wound." And he meant- what he said, too. But the tempter was before him when he went home again --before him in the shape of his aged father- in-law, who said compassionately, "drink, Aleck; it will make you sleep." And he drank! The tempter was before him again on the next morning in the same-shape, for as, the aged man left him to go back to his own home, he said kindly, "take a drink, now and then, Aleck. It'll give you strength." And he drank--drank at night to get sleep, and at morning to get strength. With mistaken kindness, too, his partner said to him on the Sunday night of the funeral, " don't try to come up to the office for a week or two, Park- man. Stay at home with your family and comfort them, if you can. We can get along without you." Better to have told him the business was so pressing he must come, or if there were no business to have made some. Next to faith in God and a belief in   244      WINE OR WATER. heaven, there is nothing poor humanity needs so much in the' day of trouble as occupation, wuork- work that must be done, work that calls into play all the energies of mind and body. Never say of a mourner, it was hard he had to go to work so soon. Rejoice rather that the necessity of labor was laid upon him, for that necessity oftener saves the soul from madness than goads it on in sorrow. There was no rest for Mrs. Parkman, with her five children to care for, and her house to see to, and though a year passed' by, before she was ever seen to smile even upon her baby when it crowed its merriest tune, the necessity of labor, of being busy continually, kept her up through the day without any artificial stimulant, and brought on such a wholesome fatigue at night, that she slept without the opiates of either wine or brandy. A fortnight of listless roving about his house and garden, a fortnight of dependence on " bitters " for sleep and strength, did not fit Mr. Parkman for the accumulated duties that met him on his return to his business, and his dull, heavy brain had to be stimulated with an extra glass, and a glass, too, that tasted a little stronger of the brandy. And so he went on, step by step. Vainly did his wife plead with him. At first he would turn upon her such a pitying glance, and say so despairingly, "M Mary, it's all the way I can bear it- all the way," that she had no heart to speak further, knowing by   UNDER A CLOUD.       245 the anguish of her own sorrow, how terrible his must be to bear. Afterwards his looks became so defiant, and his voice so harsh as he exclaimed in answer to her prayers, "hush up your childish cries. I'm old enough to know what I'm about," that broken in spirit herself and worn in health, she had no courage to urge him further. As weeks and months passed on, and he continued to provide as liberally as ever for the wants of his household, continued to attend punctually to his bus- iness, continued prompt in his home duties, regular at his meals, and spending his evenings with his family,. attending church through rain or shine, caressing his children with an added tenderness, and kinder than ever to his wife, the .poor woman became hopeful again and thought that perhaps after all, he would never become a drunkard, but be like her father, only a moderate drinker. She little knew how the habit was gaining on the deluded man; she did not know enough of temperaments to be aware that his was one which must either sink or swim, that the moment he lost his self-respect he would fall into the lowest deep. She little thought that it was an atonement to his lashing conscience, that her husband filled her store-room and her bureau, fond- led her and her children, and held his head so high in all his daily walks. Both were blinded for a time, she to the sorrow that was drifting towards her, and he to the ruin   246      WINE OR WATER. that was staring at him. But not long could things last so. His boys had only been dead a year and a little over, when Aleck Parkman was carried home one evening, so drunk that he could not articulate. That sealed his fate. He had drank before to drown his sorrow, he drank now to drown his shame. His friends had previously hardly suspected the truth; but now it began to be whispered about in counting- rooms and shops; and even in church-pews, that 'Parkman was getting dissipated;;" others shook their heads wisely, as they said it, and women sighed as they spoke of his wife and children, but none put forth a hand to save him. "Am I my brother's keeper?" Nay, never I; but you, or he, or she. When the second New Year drew nigh, Mr. Parkman's partner, in justice to himself, was forced to propose a dissolution of their partnership. Alecl had already overdrawn on their profits considerably, and become so slack that a double duty had devolved on Mr. Kinsman. In vain did he promise reforma- tion if his partner would only retain him in the firm. The latter was steadfast. "I have thought it all over, Parkman," he said to him. "If you do reform, as you say, you are perfectly competent to carry on the business alone. You understand its details per- fectly, and are a better book-keeper by far than I. So that you lose nothing by the dissolution. If you do not reform, you drag only yourself down. I have   UNDER A CLOUD.       247 borne with you in hope so far. But in justice to those dependent upon me, I must save what belongs to me." "But where is the money to come from to buy you out, or set up myself?" said Parkman, bitterly. "Children are likely to be the only capital I shall ever possess. They come faster than dollars. Only a week ago and a new one was put into my arms, and I was expected to give thanks for it." "Your wife has property, Aleck,. and property that has risen in value, too, every year. You might mortgage it, or sell part of it. And your father-in- law is well off, too, and would perliaps advance what you need. You and yours will get it all in time. As well have some of it now. The old man idolizes your wife and will not refuse her if she goes to him. At any rate, Parkmam, our partnership must end on the last day of December. It was in no enviable state of mind that Mr. Park- man went to his dinner that day. Old Mr. and Mrs. Irvin met him at the front door, having come up unexpectedly, and their words of greeting were as kind as ever, for carefully had all his derelictions been concealed from them; so carefully that they would-have been indignant had any one whispered half the truth to them. They knew, indeed, that their child's cheek grew pale, and her form shadowy and her spirits dull, but they ever laid the charge to maternal cares and the terrible sorrow that had come   248      WINE OR WATER. so suddenly. The old mother, referring to the first cause assigned, would say cheerfully, "Never mind, Mary; the faster they come the sooner you'll be through;" or, "the more you have of them, the more there are to love," while the old father would lay his hands tenderly on her head, and whisper, "You shall go to them, child, by-and-by. Had they lived, they might have been sinners, perhaps; now they can never be anything but angels." And Mrs. Parkman did not undeceive them. Better they should think the little ones came too often to be welcome to her; better they should think she was unresigned to the deaths of her first- born than guess even the truth. '"What's up, Aleclk?" said Mr. Irvin, as they went into the shed to smoke, after dinner. "Ain't the sheets likely to balance at Christmas?" "Hardly, father." He set his teeth as he spoke. "Well, well; don't take it too }lard, Aleck. I've a couple of hundred lying idle in the house which you're welcome to, if they'll help you. May as well have it now as ever, too. It'll be all yours, you know, after a while. And if that is n't enough, why I'll sell the colts; had a good offer for them yesterday, and they are nothing but a plague to me any way. I never shall need them; the old greys will last as long as mother and I want to ride." Aleck wrung the old man's hand. His better nature was roused for the instant, and he felt keenly the delicacy with which Mr. Irvin pressed his gift.   UNDER A CLOUD,       249 "It's been a hard year for me, father," he said, in a tone that touched the heart of his listener. "The children have been sick a good deal, and doctor's bills count up so terribly; and Mary's health is ii't what it used to be. She can't see to things in the kitchen as she used to, and these Irish girls ain't to be trusted as Maggie was. And now there's another baby in the cradle, and another fee, of course, and nurse hire, and the dear knows what all." And he flung his cigar away, and walked moodily about. Doctor's bills, wasteful help, nurses' wages--yes, they make the dollars fly, but not so fast as baskets of champagne, decanters of sherry, demijohns of brandy, "dozens" of porter, slings, toddies and coblers. Yet not a word of them was breathed to the old man. O, Aled Parkman, was it generous in you to make your childrens' coughs and fevers, and your wife's maternal pangs, the scape-goat of your own vicious appetite? Generous Io was ever a drunkard generous? ("I know it, Aleck; mother and I have talked it all over and over again, and we've wondered a good many times that you didn't get discouraged and take to drinking or gambling, or some other dread- ful thing." Aleck winced, but he was playing a desperate game, and so spoke up despairingly, "Yes, I have had a good deal to keep me back. I am as poor now as I was when I went into business fifteen years A:   250      WINE OR WATER. ago. I had hoped long before this to have bought Kinsman out. But I've given that up long ago. Heaven only knows what I shall do after this year, for he's going to sell out, and go to New York, and whoever buys him out it's no ways likely he will want a partner without capital." They were both silent for a while. Then the old man said gently, "What'll he sell for?" Parkman named the sum. s"Go back to the office as quick as you can, and get the refusal for a fortnight. We'll see if some- thing can't be done in that time. Don't say a word to Mary, though." The old man went home the next day, and the result of the interview was the sale of his landed property, excepting the home-farm of High Bank, and the transfer of the cash to his son-in-law, on condition of his buying out all the interest of Kins- man, in the business they had jointly followed for fifteen years. The first of January saw Aleck Park- man's name in brilliant gilt letters over the door-way of the old establishment, and a "flaming" new advertisement appeared in the morning and evening papers. Fred and William shook their heads as they talked it over to themselves, in a chance meeting, and wished that instead, the oldcman had secured it to Mary and the children, and Mary herself, instead of being elated, was full of fears. -I   UNDER A CLOUD.'       251 For a time though, all were re-assured. Aleck was sincere in his vows of reformation, and for a year was never seen intoxicated; but the bottle was not broken nor even left empty for a single day. When the new year came round, he showed his books with pride, and Mr. and Mrs. Irvin each received, with childish pleasure, a present of an ele- gant pair of gold-mounted spectacles. A twenty dollar shawl and a black silk dress were laid upon Mrs. Parkman's lap, while the children's stockings fairly overflowed with costly toys. Rose was taken from the private school she had ever attended, and sent to the academy, and took music lessons, and studied French, while Aleck, Jr. and Nattie had the promise of a brick stable to receive the ponies their grandpa had promised them when they were twelve. Mr. Kinsman had not erred in his estimate of Parkman's business qualifications. He did under- stand its details perfectly, and, keeping his own books, was enabled to see clearly every day, just how he stood, and to manage accordingly. Had he been the man he was four years before, he had now been on the high road to fortune. But he was not the same. The tempter was ever at his side, and what was worse, he ever linked arms with him instead of bidding, him " begone." Extravagant always in his tastes, he felt now that he had a right to he more lavish than ever. 'No rich man's table in that city was more luxuriously     .    252      WINE oRI WATER. furnished than his own. "I counted," said old Mrs. Irvin to one of her country neighbors, "no less than- a dozen chickens, three turkies, a brace of ducks, and as nice a sirloin as was ever cut, in my daughter's store-room, the last time I was up there." But did you count the smiles on that daughter's cheeks, dear mother! Ah, the stomachs of that household were better fed than their hearts. Beware that their come not a time when both stomachs and hearts go hungry. He smoked twice his usual number of cigars, and each one cost him double what he had been used to paying. He sent to New York for his liquors and wines, and prided himself on the choice brands they bore. He wore broadcloth of the finest thread and most fashionable cut, about his daily work, discard- ing entirely the more serviceable grey suit which in other years had been his accustomed dress. He sported a gold watch and chain, and used a gold pencil for memorandums, instead of an old fashioned one of cedar. He began to frequent hotels of an evening, and to invite the gay young men assembled there to drink at his expense, and now and then gave them an oyster supper. In short, before that winter was over, he was known as " a dev'lish good fellow," " a regular brick," "a fast one," and was b hale fellow, well met," with more than half the idlers in the city. And what of his wife all this time? What of   UNDER A CLOUD.        253 her? If you had marked her thin, white cheeks, her peaked, quivering chin, her hollow eyes with the black rings about them, and the silvery hairs that began to glisten in her dark curls, you would have said, what of her? You would have felt that her Penates were already on their funeral pyre. When the next New Year came round, Aleck Parkman's books balanced themselves and that was all. True, to blind the "old folks," he gave Mr, Irvin a costly family Bible, with type so large that at noon-day he could read it without his glasses, dim as his old eyes were, and Mrs. Irvin, a string of antique gold beads, and his wife, a set of furs, and filled the children's stockings, but he jealously kept from them all the fact that he had run in debt for every gift. Reckless as he had been in his expenditures, dur- ing the last year, he was even more so in the. nex't, while step  by step, he began to go downward. Hotels were deserted for taverns, for there was in that day, as there is in this, a difference in the sig- nificatiorn of those names, taverns for restaurants, restaurants for'corner groceries, groceries for dram shops, first respectable ones, (pardon the desecration of that adjective, but there are degrees even in drunkeness,) and afterwards those vile, musty cel- lar-holes, from which, if the door chances to be left, open, their steams up such: putrid odors, that you hold your breath as you hurry by, and dream the next night of rotting dead men, or roasting sinners.   254      WINE OR WATER, Those who had known him in the days of his sobriety, wondered that he could go down so fast. Perhaps, you too, to whom I tell this story, wonder as they did. Others must tell you of the why and wherefore of his rapid fall. I can only give you the bare facts, and add, perhaps, what experience has told me, that men of his temperament, when they do lapse, even go down with a celerity that makes one dizzy. The higher they have climbed on the steep hills that lift towards heaven, the greater the mo- mentum on the slide towards hell. I have no heart to tell you of all that Mary Park- man suffered during that year. The events of two '- or three evenings only, I will give you. She sat alone one night. in March, waiting for the drunkard to come home. The clock struck twelve, and one and two. She listened, her face pressed to the cold window-panes. No sound disturbed the silence, save only, the whistling of the wind. She went to the front door and down to the gate. There had been a thaw and rain the day before, and on the end of them a cold snap, that had frozen the slosh so firmly that the boys could skate all over the streets and pavements. "-He must have slipped and fallen," she mur- mured ; " he has never stayed so late before ; " and with the fear of harm to him, the tenderness of wife- hood all came back, and she resolved, late as was the hour, to go and seek him.   '        UNDER A CLOUD.       255.:'" Quivering in every nerve from fear, for it was a wierd hour for an honest woman to be out; shiver- ing in every limb with cold, for the wind seemed to blow off of glaciers, sliding this way and that, on she went through the deserted streets, half hoping, half fearing every moment she should meet him. She had crossed a dim, narrow alley-way, without daring to peer into it, and was hastening on, when suddenly, with words upon his lips too foul to be repeated, a man staggered out of the vile hole and caught her in his arms. Shriek after shriek rent the night air as she struggled to free herself, and then they went down together. A sleepy, half- numbed watchman was startled into vitality at once, and beating the alarm with his heavy club, lie hur- ried to the spot -whence came the outcry. Lifting the prostrate woman, he would have spoken sternly, but for the white face that looked up to him and moaned, "Save me and take me home." "Who are you?- you seem a decent woman - how came you in this neighborhood at such an hour?  Don't tremble so - you're safe now, though I doubt much if that fellow could have harmed you," and he spurned him with his heavy boot. "To hunt up my husband.. Perhaps, sir, you can help me. I will pay you well. Where can he be?" "Who is your husband?" was the next blunt question. ,   256      WINE OR WATER. Her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. Must she tell his name to him? She felt, though, it was no time to trifle with her jealous sense of a once honored name, and said hoarsely, "Parkman, sir, Aleck Parkman." "That's me-my name, and I aint ashamed of it, either," and muttering a curse on the slippery sidewalk, the fallen man managed to get upon his feet again." "If you aint ashamed of it you ought to- be, you black rascal that you are," said the watchman, collaring him as he spoke. "I have a good will to lay my club over you, and not lift it either till every bone in your body is broke. Look at that woman, brute that you are. She came out to find you and get you home, and you pounce on her as if she were a wolf come to devour you, instead of a lamb to save. Play wanton with your own wife! You go to the watch-house for this, my pretty fellow. A few nights on a stone bedstead will perhaps bring you to your senses, if there's any left," and again he sounded the rattle. "O, don't, don't, don't," and Mrs. Parkman threw herself at his feet. "He is my husband yet, -my children's father - save him, save him; " and she plead as only a wife can plead. Fortunately for her the watchman's heart was not quite dead, though the scenes of violence he had each week to pass through, had done much towards   UNDER A CLOUD.       257 hushing its sweet pulses. Passing his arm about her, for she was too weak to stand alone, he half led, half carried her on the way towards home, bidding his two assistants, as they came up, to drag the the drunkard after them. How she reached her home, the poor woman never knew; she fainted before she was half way there, and came to, only to pass from one -hysterical fit to another, till her friends and neighbors were worn out in waiting on her.  "Can she live?" asked her mother pitifully, of the physician, as on the third day the patient sank into an unquiet sleep. "Yes, I think so," was the curt answer; but as he turned away he said softly to himself, " better though, perhaps, that she had died, for what she carries will feel the fright forever.;' It was a night in early autumn. Mrs. Parkman lay on the bed in the front chamber, writhing and tossing. Her mother, Essie, Marion and a neighbor or so were ministering to her while the family physi- cian was exerting all his skill to bring her safely through her hour of peril. Up and down the room paced her husband, seemingly as anxious and tender as at other times. Suddenly the doctor said to Mrs. Irvin, "Have you spirit in the house, rum or whiskey?" A shiver passed over Mrs. Parkman, and feeble as   258      WINE OR WATER. she was, she spoke up quickly, "Not a drop, sir; but I shan't need it - I never use it." ' Tush, tush, little woman, don't be in such a fret -I don't want it for you, but have it I must. You'll find it at 'most any apothecaries," turning to Parkmari. "Get a pint, and be as quick as you can, too." The tears run down his wife's cheeks as he left the room, and as hours passed on and he did not re- turn, her nervousness became so apparent that the physician was obliged to give her an opiate. Just at dawn, a strangely sounding wail rang through the chamber, and Mrs. Parkman knew that her ninth baby was born. Not as at other times, though, did she with quickly drawn breath, ask, if it were son or daughter, and if it had come into the world without blemish. She knew by the silent tears that coursed down her attendants' faces, by the grave looks of the physician, that all her fears were verified; and when with trembling hands her mother put the baby down beside her, and said with faltering voice, "It will soon be an angel," she did not need to look at its ill-formed head or flimsy limbs to know the truth ; she felt it, felt it with a bitterness that almost crazed her brain; and yet, true to her motherhood, bent her head and kissed again and again her idiot boy. They were through breakfast before Aleck return- ed, and when Marion sternly asked him where he   UNDER A CLOUD.      259 had stayed so long, he only looked at her vacantly, and reeled into his accustomed seat. When in the course of the afternoon he had slept off his night's debauch, she made him own the truth.   He had gone, not to a druggist's, but a dram-shop, and meeting some boon companions, had drank till he had entirely forgot his errand! * "You deserve an idiot child," she said, with a bitterness that was foreign to her lips. "Go up now, and see your work." One more, and I am  done with this sad, sad chapter. When the New Year came, Mr. Park- man's books showed a deficit of five hundred dol- lars. Did he fail?  No. He raised the amount' within a week, and begun again, free from debt. But how with his reputation? Gently but firmly did Fred' remonstrate with his cousin for consenting to mortgage Pleasant View, her own, before unincumbered- property.  She answered him only with her tears; she-had no heart to tell him that her husband had stood over her with a sharpened meat knife, and sworn to draw it across her throat if she did not consent. And this was the man who, seventeen years be- fore, on the mountain's rocks, had told his betrothed that he scorned to put his name in black and white, to a temperance pledge - that he-would be free al- ways--free, not to sin, but to be tempted aud re- fraim. * f0t, 4 .'   CHAPTER X. FRIENDS IN    COUNCIL. FRED!"  "O, Wil- liam!"  And white and gasping for breath, Essie --and Marion sank upon the sofa. What what is it!" And the two husbands drop- ped their books, and hurried  to support the quivering forms of their two faint women. It was some moments before either could ariculate distinct- ly. Then amidst thickly falling tears they exclaim- ed, "Mary Parkman and her children are starving and freezing.-' "My cousin Mary!" "My precious friend." Overcoats and hats were on in a second as it were, and the two speakers with the words yet on their lips started for the hall door. Essie stopped them by her gestures, and as soon   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      261 as she could command her voice, said to them, "don't go, don't go; we have helped her for to- night. Wait and hear our story." "' Are -you sure they will not suffer before to-mor- row?" "Stre, Fred. We had our purses with us. They've enough for the present.   Sit down and listen." "Not until both of you have had some tea; you look more like ghosts than live women," and he rang the bell for it, and then with' lover-like tenderness untied her bonnet strings and unbuttoned her cloak. William performed the same services, for Marion, and then each husband sat down beside his wife, and encircling her waist, drew her aching head to his bosom, and as the gathering shadows veiled them, pressed many a soft, sweet kiss upon her lips. "Let us go up into the study," said Fred, as they left the tea-table. "I filled up the grate: just be- fore you came in, and it will be a good deal pleasanter for us than the parlor with only its dark register. With all its conveniences, I must confess my heart refuses to attach itself to a furnace. See now, how cheery this looks," and he threw open the door of the cosy little room. It was aglow with the blaze that radiated from the bed of crimson coals; book-shelves, desk, stand, lounge, and chairs all sparkling in the genial light. Seating Essie and Marion in the two arm-chairs -     at .v   262      WINE OR WATER. and wheeling them near the grate, Fred, after draw- ing the curtains closely, tossed a hassock to William and catching up another for himself, dropped it at his wife's feet, and then threw himself upon it in an abandon which if not strictl/gracITl was certainly very comfortable.   / For some moments there was silence; then Fred, as if involuntarily, exclaned, " poor Mary! What a lot her's has been. The only child of her parents and the child of their old age, too, how many hopes were centered in her, how many prayers offered for her. How aunt and uncle toiled and saved after she was born, first for her, and then for her children I And now it is all gone, gone, gone and she's the suffering wife of a poor drunkard, her little ones dragged up, instead of being brought up." He fairly groaned and hid his face in his hands. "Tell us about her now," he said at length. "I thought she had suffered all she could, but starvation and cold - that these should come to her - it is too terrible," and he shivered. Essie smoothed his hair with\ a soft, mesmeric touch, and when he was calm, began her sad narra- tive. "We were pretty well wrought up before we reached the cottage, for the day, though chilly, was yet so brilliant, and the ground so dry, that Marion proposed we should go around by way of the Cemetery as she might not have another so good a   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      263 chance this winter. So we went; first to her lot and then   " "And don't you think, William," said Marion, with a gentle bow, as an apology for the interrup- tion, " the little basket of immortelles which we left on the baby's grave the last time we were there, hang yet on the rose-bush, just as we fastened it. You were a little afraid, you know, that it might tempt some child, it was so pretty; it was of white If: coral," turning to Fred, " one of the pair that was ? senrt me from California; but I wasn't afraid to risk it there. I didn't and can't believe any one in this city is wicked enough to steal from a babv's grave," and she drew from her bosom, as by an impulse which she could not resist,- a jewelled locket and after unclosing it and gazing long upon the pictured face, passed it to the rest. It was a baby's face, as like to her own, as a rose- bud to a rose, and a faithful miniature of the only little daughter God had ever sent to bless her heart and home. -"Go on, now, Essie," she said quietly, as re- placing it, she wiped a few silent tears from off her cheeks- "Then to our own," continued Mrs. Stanton, "finding, as I felt sure we would, a new and beauti- ful wreath hung upon Isabella's monument. I wish you would go and see it, Fred; go to-morrow, if you possibly can. It is of wax-work and the most , .   264      WINE OR WATER. perfect miniature of nature I ever saw. The flowers are all white; rose-buds and one single half-blown rose, a spray of lily of the valley, knots of orange flowers, a japonica, and two stems of hyacinths, which droop as gracefully as the satin strings of a bow. It is hung in the arch, out of the way of the winds and storms, and in such a way as to encircle the word beloved, and it is certainly the most ex- quisite thing I ever saw in a cemetery. Wrho would have believed, who could have believed, so much delicacy and taste, so much genuine goodness and gratitude were hidden in that Turner; such a miserable wretch as he was, when Isabella found him, a perfect pariah." "And now, after the lapse of eighteen years, one of our first merchants. Do you know, William, that he ranks as the sixth in this city in point of wealth, and he has made every cent of it, too, himself, in that time, and what is better still, is known as one of the most benevolent men in the State, that is, in propor- tion to his wealth. And I've no idea, either, that half his good deeds are known to the public, for he makes it a rule to spend three mornings of every week, in searching out those poor, degraded wretch- es of our city, who are content to live on in their squalidness, not caring even to beg, unless fairly obliged to." "Poor Isabella," said Marion, " short as her life was, she yet accomplished more than many do, who   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      265 live an hundred years. The salvation of Turner has been the salvation of--God only knows how many. Her's was truly an angel's work, and yet how sad her death; the grave her bridegroom, and rattling stones and falling dust her marriage hymn." "How strange, too, that no one has ever heard a word of Seymour, since he left here," said William. "Not so very," answered Fred. "An orphan, he had no family friends to care for him, and the world is too busy, as a general thing, to look after penniless drunkards ; too apt to give them kicks that help them in their fall, instead of friendly fingers to lift them up.  He probably died in a New  York gutter, and was buried in Potter's field, without a tear upon his face. A sad, sad fate, but one that he sealed himself to." Essie continued: "We went next to Aleck's lot, and both of us exclaimed at once, at its exquisite neatness. I do not believe there is another in the cemetery in such   perfect order. With all her troubles and cares, Mary has never neglected caring for and adorning it. She'has trained the arbor-vitma so that you enter a perfect arch, and under the little enclosure seems to you like a bit of beauty dropped from heaven.   The grass even yet was green and soft as velvet, and though it is the last day of Octo- ber, there were peonies in blossom on every grave. A  bunch of cut flowers too, nestled on the moss at every foot-stone, while upon the monuments hung:   266       WINE OR WATER. fresh wreaths of    everlastings. We sat down there quite awhile, it was so warm and pleasant, out of the way of the wind, with the sun- shine seeming to fall straight down upon us. Of course Mary's life and lot was brought fresh to our hearts., We lived over again her girlish days, so free from care, so full of joy, and the first years of her married life, those twelve blissful years, which seemed, each of them, like foretastes of heaven. Then that first terrible sorrow, wlen Willie and Har- rie were taken so sadly and suddenly, and then Aleck's rapid downfall, and the troubles it brought on her; loss of property, loss of health, loss of every thing almost, and then that idiot baby, when her cup seemed running over; and then uncle Irvin's misfortune, and sad and sudden death." "Yes, said Marion, "it came over me' fresh as the events/of yesterday, the sight of the poor old man's death-bed, and aunt Irvin's and Mary's touch- ing grief. Poor little Nattie roused us at midnight, having come after us of his own accord. How his first words startled us, as, after William had let him in, he ran up to the bed, and seizing both my plnds, exclaimed, "Cousin Marion, cousin Marion; do come to us.  Grandpa is dying, and grandma's near crazy." I never could tell how we reached their house. I have no recollection of dressing myself or waking up the gidls, or riding or walking. I knew though, that after I'd been there some time, my feet                         . .,   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      267 felt cold, and looking down, I found I hadn't a stock- ing on either foot. I can, remember well, though, how like a vast vault the old kitchen looked to me, as I entered it, with only the glimmering of a bed of coals to light it, and I can never, forget the words of aunt Irvin, as she came from the bed-room and met me. "O, Marion, Marion," she cried, "we've got to leave the old place. Yes," she continued, dropping into a chair, "we've got to leave it. Fifty-five years ago this fall it is, he brought me here a bride Here we've always lived, here Mary was born and married, and now we've-got to leave it." "No, aunt Irvin," said I, 'no, no. Whatever has happened, or may happen, you shall not leave the old place till you die." "Ah, but you don't know, Marion, you don't know; he's signed it away, and that isn't the worst." She couldn't tell me the rest, couldn't tell me that after years and years of life as a moderate drinker, her husband had at last, in his second childhood, become a drunkard, and in a moment of irresponsibility, signed away his home. I coaxed her to lie down after a while, and William an4I watched by him the remainder of the night. 'His mind wandered most of the. time, and then he talked' constantly of Mary, going back to the days when she was a babe. in his arms. At daylight he slept, and so easy and natural seemed his breathing, that I felt encouraged to hopehe might yet be spared. -About the middle of the forenoon Aleck   268      WINE OR WATER. and Mary came. My blood nearly boiled, even in that moment of grief, to see him leap from the bug- gy and swagger up to the house, smoking his cigar as he came along, and leaving Mary to get out as she could, with the baby in her arms. "Is he alive?" she moaned, as I ran to help her. "Thank heaven," she cried, as I answered, "Yes, darling ;" "I was afraid I should be too late; I thought I should never get him started." She went at once to the bed-room. I would have kept her back, but it was well I didn't, for he only spoke once after she went in. "Come to see me die, darling," said he;, "you're just in time. I'm going; good-bye. Take care of your mother, and I'll see to Harrie and Wil- lie." I closed his eyes in less than five minutes. Poor aunt Irvin--how she did pray to go with him, and with every prayer said pitifully, "I can't leave the old place /" ' It was a scene for a painter, that old kitchen, when, the day after the funeral, the New York mer- chant to whom the property had fallen, came in, as we all supposed, to take possession. Aunt Irvin sat at the same window she had been accustomed to for these fifty-five years. 'Her knitting-work lay in her lap; her Bible was open on the stand beside her. She was very pale, but calm, and seemed to me the im- personation of saint-hood ripe for heaven. "This is Mrs. Irvin," said I to the stranger. He took her thin, wrinkled hand in his, and said   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.     .,269 kindly, '"I am Mr. Herbert, from New York." She looked at him a moment, as though she did not un- derstand him or why he came there. Then it all flashed over her, and she slid from her seat and dropped on her knees, and while tears filled every furrow of her white face, she said, pitifully, "I can't leave the old place; O, sir, I can't." How breath- lessly I waited to see what he would do, to hear what he would say. Lifting her to her feet, he seat- ed her in her chair, saying, " you shall never leave it while you live," and then slipping the life-lease in the open Bible, he passed out so quickly, that none of us had time to thank him. But O, the blessings that aunt showered on his head, and the prayers that she sent to, heaven for him during the three months that she lived! If half were answered, he would be the happiest man on earth. "Go on, now, Essie; I'll try and not interrupt you again." "Our hearts were very dull when we left the cemetery, but little did we think there was fresh sorrow for us. It made us, sad when we reached the cottage, to see the changes about it. The two acres have dwindled down into such a narrow back- yard, piece after piece having been sold to lift those terrible mortgages, and do you know, Fred, that since we were there, last summer, one of the pur- chasers has built a couple of cheap three-story houses right on the line, and they are both swarm. ing with emigrants, and emigrants of the lowest   270 W. INE OR WATER. grade, too. I should think Mary would be afraid of her life there, and then what lessons her children must be continually learning with such low persons constantly in sight." "' And one of the chief reasons why uncle Irvin bought them for her, was to keep her aloof from unpleasant neighbors, and to give her home a coun- try look," said Fred. "Poor Mary!" "The front yard was as neat as ever, the gravel walks free from weeds or dead leaves, the trees and bushes all mulched, the flower stalks all pulled, and the box edging pruned to a line, but half a dozen pigs lay banked up against the gate, and Mary says they've lain there all the fall, and she dare not drive them off for fear of the emigrants. Who would have believed Aleck Parkman would ever have sub- mitted to such a nuisance. We dislodged them after a while, and as we went up to the front door, could not but contrast the present with the former appearance of the cottage. Mary has done all she could to preserve it, but a woman can't do every- thing. It needs painting, sadly; the clapboards are fairly grey, and the blinds faded to a dingy brown, while as many as a dozen shingles were clattering in the wind. But the steps were free from speck or stain, and the bell and door-knob shone like gold. Rose answered our ring. We almost screamed as we saw her, she looked so pale and thin. "Are  y% o u/y ck, dear," I said, as I took her little wasted   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      271 hand. O, no, cousin Essie, very well," butcher face grew very red- as she spoke, and I felt that some- thing was wrong. "You'll have to come into the kitchen," she said, as we halted a moment in the dining-room ; "we've no fire anywhere else." The kitchen was as neat as wax; indeed, it fairly made me ache to see how white the floor and tables were, for I knew either Mary or Rose must have scoured them, and I knew neither were strong enough for such hard work. We had not felt- the cold while walking, but on sitting down were soon so chilly that without thinking we drew our chairs up to the stove. Mary's face flushed, and after a moment's hesitation, she said to Lewis, " go and bring in some wood, dear." He looked at her but did not start. "Go, dear," she said. "'Why, mother, there ain't but one armful left, and we want that to--to-- cook supper." Before either of us could speak, little Marion came running in, crying, "I want sumfin to eat, I do, 'cause I can't wait.. I don't want taters eder; I tired of taters; I want bed and butter, I do; ain't we never going to have bed any more." Poor Mary dropped the pair of pants she was patching, and hiding her head in her hands, sobbed aloud. Marion, more at home there than I, went at once into the pantry, and she says there was n't a thing there to eat, but cold potatoes and salt. She brought out a basket with her; " here, Lewis," said she, "take Abbie and Marion with   272      WITNE OR WATER. you, and go down to the baker's, and buy them both some cakes, whatever kind they want, and then ,spend the rest of the money for bread and biscuit and crackers. And you, Rose, go down to the first grocery and get some tea, sugar and coffee, and then go on to the market and order steak enough for tea and breakfast. Where are Nattie; and Aleck?" "Gone down to the wharf where they are building the new boat, to see if they can't get some big chips, aunt Marion; but I guess they'll be home soon." "Well, then, I'll wait till they come, to see about the wood. Go quick, now. When the children were all gone, she went up to Mary, and taking down her hands, said to her, "now tell us all about it. . Are you really starving and freezing." "Yes, yes," was the sobbing answer, and then when-she grew calm she told us all about her privations. Aleck, you know, had to sell out right away, after uncle Irvin's death, to save a fail- ure, and the sale barely covered his debts, and lifted the mortgages; so half an acre was sold' to get money to live on, and when that was gone another mortgage was put on the place, and when that money was used up another half acre was sold, and so on till only the cottage and little back yard was left them, and that is mortgaged now. They don't own a cent of property in the world. He's never done a day's work since he sold out, though the man he sold to, has again and again offered him the   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      273 highest journeyman wages. But he, declares he won't work where he's once been master. Last New Year's he sent home a barrel of flour and a quarter of beef, and from that day to this, he's never provided a single thing for them' or given Mary a cent of money. "But how have they lived," asked Fred, breath- ing hard as he spoke. "Why, she' sold things out of the house. You remember the silk dress and shawl Aleck bought her that New Year after he first went into business alone -well, she's never made up the dress or worn the shawl, and she put them into one of the storest and they brought her nearly what they cost. Then she had a whole piece of linen sheeting, and another of linen towelling which were amongst her mother's things, and she sold them and got a good price, too; Then she's sold a couple of her beautiful white spreads, and two of her handsome patchwork quilts, and that long piece of rag carpeting she made a year or two ago. And so, by dint of closest economy she's got along until this fall." "And never told us a word about it." . "Never - us, nor any one. Mr. Turner, she says, has been there several times the past year, and inquired-very kindly if they did not need help, but she could not bear to tell him just how they were situated, and always answered him, we're hoping for the best. But she has twice received a barrel of   274      WINE OR WATER., flour and a load of wood from some unknown friend, and always attributed them to him. She's been try-   J ing ever since he moved here to get courage and come up to tell us, but a certain feeling of self- respect, some persons would call it pride, but I don't think that the right name for the feeling, has kept her back. She's started up street several times to try and sell her spoons, but turned back, because she couldn't bring her mind to it; you know'her father and mother set so much by the silver they gave her. She tried taking in sewing last summer, but she couldn't stand it, for all the chance she could get was after bed time, and she wasn't sure of that, the baby is so much care." ' Iave they named him yet?" "No; they call him baby and that's all he is, though over three years old. He's never even sat alone yet, and I don't think he ever will, while his cries, when he does cry, are enough to craze one. "(Has she tried to get places for Aleck and Nat- tie?" "Yes, and has had good ones offered her for them, but their father won't let them work out. He says he's going to educate his children." "Yes, in vice and misery," said Fred, bitterly.   I "Did you see him?" ' Who? Aleck? Yes; we went in to see him.       He's sick; better to-day, but has been pretty sick    with lung fever; has n't been out of the house for a  I fortnight?"    FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      2,75 1' How did he seem?" "Well, much like the Aleck of old. He wel- comed us very cordially, and said he should have been down to see us, if he had n't been shut up there sick. "He was sober then." "O, perfectly; he has n't had a drop since he was taken down. Mary has always been firm in that. Scolding and blows have never moved her. She never has given him a drop herself nor allowed .the children to get any for him. And in spite of all the sufferings of the last fortnight, with only potatoes and salt for herself and children, and a little corn gruel for him, she says she has enjoyed more than she has for months, and even for two years; for the moment he's sober, Aleck's hi self, kind and genial. It's liquor puts the devil in him." Fred got up and paced the room for sometime. Suddenly he stopped and said earnestly, " something must be done for him. Matters have come to a crisis. A long and perhaps severe winter is before them, and there is a family of seven children to be provided for. Aleck Parkcman must be reformed." "He is hopeless,", said William. "While there is life, there is hope, morally as well as physically. Much has been done to save him, much more can be done, much more must be done. I have been so busy since we moved here, with getting settled and attending funerals, three  .^   276      WINE OR WATER. out of town last week, and four the week previous, that I've scarcely had time to breathe freely till this afternoon. But I shall be more at leisure after this, and my chief work this winter shall be the reforma- tion of Aleck, and the care of his family. Those poor, poor children. I can feel for them more than you," and he laid his hands on William's head, "for I, too, am a drunkard's son." "They must have food and fuel the first thing," said Marion. "We met the boys and gave them money enough to get a'load of wood; poor things, their toes were out of their boots, and their coats and pants patched in twenty places. I. don't see how Mary has contrived to get along even as well as she has. How much is there on hand of the drunkard's fund yet, Fred-this year's interest, I mean." "Only a trifle over fifty dollars. 'You know we generally use it up pretty closely by this time of the year." "Draw it out to-morrow, and send it to Mary in a blank sheet. Did you bring much money up with you, William." "Yes, considerable, he answered with a smile. My little wifey wanted a new silk dress, and winter bonnet and cloak, you know, and our two little boys needed, she said, lots of things." "Your little wifey must do with her old silk, and make last winter's bonnet, and her two year old   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      2" cloak answer for the present, but you may give her the money you've reserved for those things.. It won't matter any to you, I suppose, how she spends it! ' ".Not at all, dear,". and taking out his pocket- book, he counted out a roll of bills and handed them to her. She looked them over. "One hundred dollars! Your farming must have been pretty lucrative this summer to afford that sum for a dress, bonnet and cloak. ' He colored, but only said, quietly, " if you have any change, you can return it, you know." She took his hand and pressed it, and whispered, ' I understand it all. Marv would awt like to take anything from you, but from me, her father's ward , and the friend of her childhood, it would seem differ- ent. Come here, Essie,"' going to the desk and taking up a pencil and sheet of paper. "Let's make out that list now that we talked of coming home." Fast did the pencil travel, while murmured words, such as "three pairs of boots - no, four, Aleck must have some, you know - caps -overcoats- shoes- delaine - socks-- mittens-comforters," and the like, from time to time reached the ears of the thoughtful man. "There,". said. Marion, folding up the paper, "that comprises all the necessaries, and they will be very comfortable for awhile now, all but'   278      WINE OR WATER. Aleck. He needs a whole new suit, I expect, and if they succeed in getting him to quit drinking, he shall have it; but I am not willing to give him new broadcloth to roll in the gutter with. The under- shirts, and drawers, and socks, and boots, will keep him from freezing any way. And we'll go out the first thing in the morning and make these purchases. Mary must not worry another day about their win- ter clothing." The door-bell rang just then, and in a few moments there was a friendly tap at the study door. "Good evening, friends," said Mr. Turner, as he grasped the offered hand of Fred. "Learning you were all here, I made bold to come right up. Folks are apt to be a little free in their pastor's house, I believe." "They were in this before we  took possession," said Essie, with a mischievous look, which discon- certed the visitor somewhat; ," somebody made free to paper and paint it and even furnish the parlors, and without as much as saying by your leave to me. But as minister's wives are proverbially an imposed upon race, I have concluded to submit patiently to this and all other similar surprises. But pray be seated, Mr. Turner. I think you will find this chair very comfortable. It is one of the freedom's which somebody took with the study. My  husband found it here one day last week." Marion gazed at him intently as he sat down. A.,   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      279 Was this man, this noble-looking man, and the wretch Isabel Ashey had found in the angle of a fence eighteen years before, one and the same? There is hope for Aleci, she said to herself--hope for everybody. "As we are friends here," said Mr. Turner, "I will come at once to the purpose of my rather un- timely call. I want to consult with you in reference to Aleck Parkman and his family. Something ought to be done for him; something must be done for them. I found two of his boys down on the wharf this afternoon, gathering chips. I knew at once they must be in a great strait, or Mrs. Parkman would never have consented to their going, for in all her troubles, she has ever managed to keep her children aloof from all coarseness. Perhaps it wasn't exactly right in me, but I reasoned as theologians do sometimes, that the end justified the means, and so entered into conversation with them, and so warmed myself into their little hearts, that they ventured after a while to tell me of their wants. Would you believe it, Mr. Staunton," and his voice quivered, "your cousin had but one armful of wood in the shed when they left, and for a fortnight she and her children have had nothing to eat but pota- toes and salt."  "I would not have believed it, but that my wife and friend accidentally discovered such to be the truth this afternoon. It is terrible; terrible for any   280      WINE -OR' WATER, woman; how much more for one, who like Mary, never knew what want was in her father's house." "I have been afraid for some time there was suf- fering there, but I never dreamed of anything like. that. Again and again my wife and I have called, and-as delicately as we could endeavored to gain Mrs. Parkman's confidence; but we never succeed- ed, and never could blame he for her reserve either, for to a sensitive, high-souled woman, it must be worse than starvation to tell her wants. But the time is gone by now for fastidiousness. When little children are freezing with cold and fainting with hunger, we must give without asking how our charity will be received. I ventured to send down a load of wood and a ton of coal, and a couple of baskets of provisions, without waiting to see you, for I was so haunted by the white, pinched up faces of those little boys that my supper nearly strangled me. And now, what shall we do."   He spoke earnestly, and it was evident his heart was in the good work. They explained what they had already done, and what they intended to do on the morrow. "It is what I might have expected of you all," he said warmly, " and we may consider the family com- fortable now. But Parkman, himself! Shan't we make one more effort to save him. So much native goodness as there is in him, so much business talent, so much mind and soul  and to drown it all in   FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.      281 drink! It must not be. The gutter shall never be his death-bed!" "Not if I can save him," said Fred. But how to begin is the puzzle. Can you suggest anything." "If we could only get him once into our temper- ance meetings and get his feelings wrought up, I should be very hopeful. It is very fortunate for our purpose that this revival in temperance is so active just now. Do you know it is not confined to our own city alone, but is spreading over all the States, indeed the Union? It's a fact and a glorious one, too; community has at last awakened from its lethargy. Its heart has been touched. It has learn- ed that the evils of drunkenness are not confined alone to the drunkard, but to his poor wife and help- less children; that the innocent suffer more than the guilty. And not only its heart, but its purse has been touched, too. It has learned, that in this coun- try at least, pauperism is in exact proportion to the number of dram-shops, and that if it would avoid heavy taxations and daily beggary it must prevent intemperance. If it can't shut up the dram-shops, it must shut up the desire to go there. In a word, that it is easier and better to prevent than punish sin.

And we've learned, too, that it is not enough to get a man to sign his name; he must be looked after; kept out of the way of temptation; provided with work; en- couraged every way. If he falls, and O, my friends, it's so easy for a man to fall when he's been -crippled for years- if he falls, we must lift him up again- make crutches of ourselves, till he can go alone. "Can't we contrive some way to get Parkman in to those meetings? He must be saved!" They discussed the question till the city clocks chimed twelve, and then theyprayed.   CHAPTER XI.

"My dear cousin," and with the mutual exclamation, they '---i'4^iS^ -were clasped in each other's arms. Then, taking hold of hands, they gazed long and tenderly into each other's faces. "How well he keeps his age," was Aer silent thought; "how faded she looks! how old she has grown!" was his. "Aleck at home, Mary?" "O, yes; he hasn't been out, yet. Come in;" and she led the way. "Why, Aleck, how are you, my dear fellow?" said Fred, affecting a hilarity which he was far from   284      WINE OR WATER. feeling. "But, how's this?" as he took the wasted hand that was held out, and scanned the pale face and emaciated figure; "is it thee or thy ghost, man?"And then passing to a tone of deep fervor, he said, "Aleck, Aleck, you have been very low, or I would not see you thus, and I in the same city I Why haven't I known it? Why not send for me?" "Mary wanted to, but I would not let her; I knew you must have your heart and hands full, with moving and getting settled; and then I know some- thing of that society,-it is one to make large de-- mands upon the- time and patience of a pastor; and especially so, when it's been destitute of a settled minister for six months or more." He spoke the truth, but not the whole truth. The pure, earnest life of his cousin had been a tacit re- proach to him, every hour since his own fall from rectitude and honor. He could not bear to meet the clear steady gaze of those honest eyes, nor bear to hear the kindly words of warning from those unsul- lied lips. His wife had begged of him to send for Fred in the early stages of his illness, but he was proof against every petition. Taken down fresh from a fortnight's " spree," his pride would not let him be seen by his old friends, till the marks of his sin should be somewhat obliterated. "Didn't you find it a hard job to get the old house in any kind of decent repair?" he continued, without giving Fred time to speak. "I wondered so much   TAKING AND BREAKING.      285 at your taking the old Kilby place, when there are so many newly built brick houses, all about the church. What possessed you?"2 Fred laughed. "Why, you see, Essie and I are two kinder old-fashioned folks, and we both prefer an old wooden house, with a little historical romance about it, a legend or so-" "Haunted chamber, and midnight ghost-" . "Yes; they might be thrown into the catalogue; we prefer such a house far before one of those star- ing new ones, which have nothing but white walls and fresh -paint to recommend them. I always thought I would like to live in that old house, but I never expected to, though I told Essie, as soon as I was invited here as a candidate, that if a successful one, I should try to get it." "But have you made it comfortable?" "It has been made so, though I had no part in it. When I took Essie to look at it, the morning after our arrival, I found it in perfect repair; paint- ed and papered throughout, afurnace set up in the cellar, a bath-room conjured up in the second story, gas in every room, and, to cap all, the parlors com- pletely furnished." "Society's doings!" "No; the work of one man--a man who im- proves every opportunity to benefit those who were the-friends of his preserver, saviour, angel." "You mean Turner."    286      WINE OR WATER. "Yes, Turner; a name that is becoming associat- ed in my heart with all things pure and good." And here Fred adroitly changed the subject, know- ing he had said enough to awaken thought in Park- man's mind. He was a good talker; one of those who not only have the commendable talent of always interesting their listeners, but the rarer one of draw- ing others out; well acquainted with the peculiari- ties ofParkman, he spared no effort at this time, to engage him in earnest conversation on matters and things in which he knew him to be well-informed. The clock struck five. "Bless me," he exclaim- ed, when he had counted the strokes, "I had no idea we had talked so long. I never once thought of spending the whole afternoon here; meant to have made half a dozen calls. But then it's not often I have a chance to get a good talk with an old friend. And now, when are you and Mary coming up to see us? I shall expect a visit the very first time you walk out. By the way," buttoning uphis over- coat as he spoke, " why can't you come up Sun- day?" "Visit a minister on Sunday! it would be out of all rule;" and Parkman smiled, yet Fred noticed, as the smile softened away, a wistful look upon his face, as though he would like it, of all things. "You didn't let me finish my sentence. William and Marion are coming up Saturday evening, in their own buggy, and going to stay till Monday.   TAKING AND BREAKING.      287 Now, as it would be too far for you to walk the first time you went out, you could send Aleck or Nattie up in the morning and let them drive it down, and then you and Mary could ride up and make your- selves comfortable in my study till dinner-time, when we'll all join you, and then in the afternoon, if you feel able, you can go to church with us- it's only a block you know, to walk--and I want your opin- ion of my preaching, too. Essie thinks I am improv-- ing wonderfully in pulpit oratory, but I would like the judgment of some one not quite so partial. Say, will you come? Do now; and in the evening we'll have one of our old-fashioned meetings, such as we used to have, years ago, in the parlor of uncle Irvin's old farm-house ; will you?" "I should like it much, Fred; shall we say yes, Mary?" "If it's a good day, and -you're well enough, Aleck. A ride would benefit you very much, I know, and so would a change of scene. It's so te- dious," turning to her cousin, " for a man to be shut up three weeks." "But I've been pretty patient, this time, haven't I, Mary?" "O yes; you've done very well, till now, for a day or two. Yes; I guess we'll come, 'Fred." "Well. then, I'll tell Essie to put in an extra quart of beans, and make her brown loaf and Indian pudding a third larger. That's all you'll get, so   288      WINE OR WATER. don't fix your mouth for anything extra. Essie's as set about her Sunday cooking as though the Blue Laws were in force yet; though she does generally treat me to an oyster-stew at tea-time. How many dozen, extra, shall I order for you, Aleck? You used to be death on them." (' And am yet, Fred; but then, as I am an inva- lid, just now, why--" "About two dozen will suffice. Well, I'll get them, and tutor Essie about the beans. And now, good-bye. Be sure and come;" and Fred took his leave, his heart a good deal lighter than when he entered, for he had allayed all Parkman's suspicions as to his visit being an errand of conversion, and put matters in a fair way to bring about the purpose which he had so much at heart. Long and fervent- ly did he and Essie pray that night, for the drunk- ard and his little helpless family. A better time could hardly have been chosen by Parkman's friends, for-their good work. His sick- ness had been a God-send, a very blessing in dis- guise. It had carried him close to the portals of the tomb, so close that it seemed at times, to him, he could smell the damp mould, and hear the dropping clod. Such a sickness seldom fails, to awaken thought, even in the most thoughtless and depraved. It is not in human nature to stand on the confines of eatS, the threshold of eternity, and not look back as well as forward. Memory will arouse itself then,   TAKIN G AND BREAKING.     289 if ever, and as our life has been, so will be our re- flections. Parkman was naturally a thoughtful, kind-hearted man, and when brought down so low, could not but look back with distress and horror, at the last half dozen years of his life. Every harsh and cruel word that he had spoken to his wife, every threat that he had menaced, every blow that he had struck -every sorrow that he had brought upon her, rush- ed now upon his memory, and so vividly, that at times he almost wished he could die, if death would bring forgetfulness. He knew that he had brought his family down from competence to poverty, from happiness to misery. He knew they were starving, and freezing, and going naked. And yet, now that he was sick, how kind and tender they all were to him, even little Marion hushing her cries for bread, when told it would disturb her father. He saw his wife grow paler and thinner every day, and yet never breathe a murmur, though obliged to wrap up in shawls and cloaks, through the autumn nights, because there was no fire to sit by, while she watched; choking down potatoes and salt, that the little corn meal might be spared to make his gruel; and pawning a precious brooch that she might buy medicine to ease his pains. He saw his children going about with purple hands, and pinched faces, and yet ever ready with a smile and pleasant word to come and wait upon him. All so good, all sTP kind- he only, bad and cruel   290      WINE OR WATER. It had been years since Aleck Parkman had prayed, but one night as he lay upon his sick-bed, listening to the low patter of his wife's feet as she paced to and fro in the dining-room, to keep herself from chilling through entirely; refusing to lie down beside him, lest she should drop asleep in her weari- ness, and forget to bring him his medicine--that night, his conscience, thoroughly awakened, smote him so hard, that out of the depths of his own agony he prayed. Prayed, and while the words went up to heaven, an angel rolled the rock away from his long buried heart, lifted it from the low sepul- chre of sin, and bathed it in the blood which drop- ped from Calvary. What he needed now, was human help. God was with him, but would his brother man look kindly on him; would they not taunt him with the past, and fear him for the future? Was he strong enough to work out his salvation? "I think it will be pleasant to-morrow, don't you, Mary?" and Mr. Parkman turned from the win- dow. He had been watching the golden and crim- son tides of sunset, and spoke now out of the fulness of his heart. O, yes, Aleck; the sun has set very clear, and the wind's in the right quarter for warm, dry weather. I'm  so glad we told them we'd come; it'll do you so much good." "And you too, Mary; you need a change as   TAKING AND BREAKING.      291 much as I;" and then sauntering into the parlor, he opened a window, threw back the blinds tnd gazed long upon the beautifnl portrait that hung beside his own over the mantel. "You will take cold, here, Aleck; this room is very chilly. Come, you must not stay any longer." "One moment, wife; " and he led her where the light fell upon her face. "How changed!" glanc- ing from her to the picture. "I am older, now,'" she said, gently; and then speaking up cheerfully, "you, too, are changed--" "Yes," interrupting her, "but it's sit that's altered me - sorrow that's done its work on you." And then he drew her to his heart and kissed her. It was years since he --had done so, and Mrs. Park- man nearly fainted with the sudden joy. "You must pray for me more than ever, now," he whispered, as she nestled to his side, that night, after laying her idiot baby in its crib; " perhaps this sickness will make a better man of me." "Shan't we drive around by the cemetery, wife?" said Mr. Parkman, as he took the lines from Nattie. "It's so'very still and sunny, to-day, I don't tlink it can possibly hurt me."         - She assented gladly. A great hope had been born in her heart on the previous night, and she was resolved to nurture it with the kindest, gentlest attention. It was very long since her husband had been to   292      WINE OR WATER. that consecrated spot, so long, that he could hardly- find his own lot, time and care had altered it so. "Is it possible this is ours," he asked, as his wife passed under the arch of arbor-vits. "Who has done this?" passing his hand over the fragrant sprays. "The children and I," she answered, quietly. He sighed, and then said, softly, " yes, while I've neglected the living, you have been constant not only to them, but also to the dead. I've much to atone for." Tender and- holy thoughts came to Aleck Park- man, that quiet autumn morning, as he knelt beside the graves of his first-born, his beautiful twin boys, and leaned against the stone that marked the resting place of those to whom his wife had been so near and dear--thoughts, which, if they did not lift up quite to heaven, were yet as a baptism to his sin- starved soul. From their own lot, they went to Marion's. But two graves were there, that of the little baby-daugh- ter who had blessed her second marriage, and Wel- don's. He plucked a clover leaf from the latter, murmuring, as he did so, "Once I used to say, poor Thomas I now, looking down from heaven, I think I hear him say, poor Aleck! ' From thence they went to Fred's. But one grave was there- that of the cherished Isabel. "Exqui- site!" they both exclaimed, as they caught sight of   TAKING AND BREAKING.      293 the waxen wreath that encircled the tender word, "beloved." "Turner has done this," said Aleck, after a montent's musing - "it is just like him, and yet eighteen years ago, he was as low as I. We seem to have changed places; he, gone up, and I down, down, down." He lingered long there; lingered till Mary said gently, "We must go, Aleck. The dampness will strike through your boots, if you stand much longer." Thev drove to Fred's in silence. The little maid- of-all-work showed them up into the study, where a cheerful fire was blazing. They found the lounge already for the invalid, with cushions, pillows, and comforters. Parkman lay down at once, and his wife had the satisfaction of seeing him soon drop off into a refreshing sleep. Noon gathered all the friends into the cosy room, and it seemed to Aleck he had already begun a new life. He had hardly realized before, how low had been his companions for the last few years, how grovelling his society. Should he return to them, to it? He shuddered at the thought, but trembled. for his weakness. After the frugal dinner had been eaten, Essie took him and Mary over the house, and showed them how convenient it had been made, and how neatly  painted and papered, and with a house-keeper's  * pride, pointed to the plain, but tasteful furniture of the parlors.   294      WINE OR WATER. "And you say, Turner did it all?" ' Yes, Aleck, all; was he not generous?" "Aye, aye; do you know, Essie," and he spoke very softly, " that when I hear of his good deeds and remember how he once was, I think there may be hope for me." "There is, my friend, there is," and she grasped his hand. "There is hope for every one--how much for you, who for twelve years put sin behind you?"She said no more, for she felt the hour had not quite come. Many eyes looked wonderingly upon Mr. Park- man, as he slowly walked up the middle aisle, lean- ing upon his cane. And one man's (Turner's) filled with tears, while his heart throbbed almost audibly. Involuntarily, as Parkman passed his pew door, he put out his hand, and gave him a warm, cordial greeting. It was a little act, but it touched the recipient deeply, and strengthened the good resolu- tion that had been awakened in his soul. It was four years and more since he had wor- shipped in that or any sanctuary. And now as the organ gave forth a low, sweet melody, touching as the tones of vesper bells, when they steal over rip- pling waves, the memories of other days were fresh- ened, and one and another of the mile-stones of life were counted over. He remembered well the day when he bought his pew; a week only before his   TAKING AND BREAKING.      295 bridal it was. And with how much care he had it cushioned with the then fashionable crimson damask, and carpeted with Brussels, and how jealously he locked within his trunk the two new pocket Bibles and handsomely bound hymn books, for in one of each was written, "To my dear wife." He remem- bered the first time he walked up that aisle with Mary, he a fond bridegroom, and she a blushing bride; and the holy Sabbaths of the year that fol- lowed, and of his loneliness during the months after- wards, when rigid custom kept the young wife at home; and then, of that memorable time, when, as a young father, he bore a baby on each arm, and held them up for the holy christening rite. And then he remembered carrying his first daughter up to the altar, and fast after, Rose, Aleck and Nattie, and Lewis and Abbie, and then with a pang remem- bered that it was his wife who carriedilittle Marion, he ashamed to go, because of the sin-marks on his brow; and with a deeper pang he thought of the last little one, whose helpless idiocy and terrible deformity would have made the rite a mockery. And then, and O, how vividly there passed before his eyes, a funeral scene; he saw again a train of youthful bearers carrying two coffins up the aisle, and then bearing them back again; he saw: them lifted into the hearse, and heard it drive away with that low monotone which touches the heart. And then-the music died away, and the solemn silence   296      WINE OR WATER. hushed his memories, and left him communing with his God, a sinner, penitent as ever sinner could be. "Deliver us froni evil" Such was the minister's text that afternoon, and the sermon that he preached from it will never be forgotten by the thoughtful of those who heard him. iOut of his heart," he spoke, and every hearer felt as though the prayer was meant especially for him. Not for my neighbor, but for me, was the feeling of every one. The minister had studied that sermon thoroughly, and studied it not alone in the quiet of his own house, in his chair and beside his desk, but he had gone out into the thoroughfares of life and studied it there, showing to his hearers that the prayer was a special as well as a universal one. Christ prayed it for all mankind, but every man when he prayed-it for the world, should pray it for himself, particularly thinking the while, of his own besetting sin. And he must not be satisfied with praying it in his closet, on bended knee, with closed eyes and folded hands, but he must pray it when he goes out into the world about him; pray it in his counting-room, when tempted by lust of gold to make a false entry in his ledger; pray it in the work-shop, when tempted by lust of ease to varnish over a blemish in his work; pray it in his office, when tempted by lust of power to take advantage of another's weakness; pray it in the study, when tempted by lust of favor to use   TAKING AND BREAKING.       . 297 another's thoughts; pray it in the street, when tempted by lust of pollution to utter a profane word; pray it in the grocery, the tavern, the hotel, any place where stands an array of decanters, and the lust of drink tempts one to forget that he is a husband, a father, a friend, a man; pray it at mid- night, when the lust of the brute tempts him to -take the hands of strange women in his own; pray it here, there, everywhere, whenever he is led into temptation. "My friends," and the minister leaned upon the desk, and looked earnestly, affectionately upon his congregation--" is there one amongst us who does not need to say this prayer every morning, and every night, and every day many times?" He paused, and the impressive silence was such that you could hear the throbbings of your neigh- bor's heart. "Deliver us from evil. Pray it ear- nestly, my friends -- pray it with faith. The Lord will not fail to answer your petition. As you straighten your bent knees, as you unfold your clasped hands, as you open your closed eyes, you will find yourself strongerby far, than when you went into your closet. "My friends; that strength is the LordCs answer to your prayer. Not by miracles does He work in these latter days.

You have only to pray, my friends, and the strength will come. Will you pray? "Aye, I know you will, and may God give you grace to use the strength that cometh from your prayer, to the resistance of all temptation -so shall you be delivered from evil - so shall you be made fit to. live--ready to die. Amen. Let us pray." Not one word of that sermon was lost upon Aleck Parkman. Deeply did it affect him - how deeply, only God and his own heart knew. Had the minis- ter only brought in the single vice of intemperance, as an illustration, his sentiveness might have been wounded, and emotions of anger instead of sorrow generated; but he had spoken as pointedly of all the sins of the age, and thus the poor drunkard, instead of feeling himself the chief of sinners, had felt as if he was but one of many; a sinner amongst sinners. The choir had practiced a new and beautiful an- them the night previous, with which to close the afternoon's service, but the chorister quietly turned over the leaves of his book as the amen of the pas- tor fell softly on his ear, and whispered a word to the organist. The anthem was not sung, but in its stead that sweet and touching- spiritual song,- "Come ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish."   TAKING AND BREAKING.       299 Parkman had risen with the rest of the congrega- tion, but as the words, "Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish," rose and fell in music, he sat down and hid his face in his hands, and many, many were he warm tears that trickled through his fingers. Very white was that face when he again lifted it and listened to the fervent benediction, white and damp, but with lines of glory all about it. His mother had cradled him to sleep many a time with that sweet song; it had echoed from his fath- er's lips full often; and the last words of both, as they lay upon their dying pillow had been, "Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure." Do you wonder that wrought up as he was, by the thoughts of the morning, the memories of the after- noon, the powerful sermon to which he had just listened, his full soul should yield itself up to the influence of the hour? Better men perhaps, than Aleck Parkman ever was, or would be, walked down that aisle beside him, and out into God's sun- shine, but not one amongst that crowd carried with- in his breast a heart so truly contrite, or -nourished there a hope more beautiful. "Let me go by myself awhile," he said to Fred, as they returned'to the parsonage; "'Your sermon has set me to thinking."   800      WINE OR WATER. ,The minister opened the door of a little closet that adjoined the study, and as his cousin passed in, said gently, "Pray, Aleck. The Lord will hear and answer you." Parkman pressed his hand and went in and-shut himself up alone. The short autumnal twilight had faded. Essie drew  the curtains of the study, and lit the gas, while Fred rattled the crimson coals of the grate, till they glowed in a warm, cheery mass. One by one the little group gathered into the cosy room and settled themselves for a long, pleasant evening. The door-bell rang, and presently steps were heard as- cending the stair-case. "Ah, Mr. Turner, good evening," said Fred, as he shook the visitor's hand, "you are about the only man to whom we would give a welcome, just now. Come in and be one of us." "No, Mr. Staunton, I cannot stop with you now. Indeed, I  am almost sorry I came, you look so happy, here. It makes me hate to do my errand." And he paused. "Duty before pleasure, is the minister's motto," said Fred. "If I  am needed, don't hesitate 'to say so."  "Well, you are needed, Mr. Staunton; and yet, I hardly feel as though I had a right to call upon you. Let me explain. Our city temperance society has met as usual, in the City Hall. An unusually large audience has assembled, as we had the promise   TAKING AND BREAKING.      801 of a speaker from the Metropolis. He has failed, not only to meet his engagement, but to send his excuse. Of course, we officers are left in a, to say the least, perplexity. There is nothing which we could say, to-night, that would satisfy them, expect- ing as they did, a speech from a talented stranger, and I have come to you to help us out of our embar- rassing situation. Our other city preachers have each and all been with us from time to time, and I could hardly, with propriety, tax them again so soon. Will you go?"?      " Mr. Staunton did not answer, but bowed his head upon the table. A silence of some minutes ensued. It was broken by the voice of Mr. Parkman. "Go, Fred, go; it may be the salvation of some poor fellow." "I will, Aleck;" and he started up and threw off his dressing-gown. "Why not all go?" asked Mr. Turner; "my carriage is at the door. It will hold the ladies and Mr. Parkman, and the rest of us can walk." Mrs. Parkman, held her breath. She felt that life and death, or rather heaven and hell hung on that moment. "I should be glad to go," said Mr. Parkman. "So should I and I," said the others. And they went. The hall was crowded, but to Mr. Parkman's sur- prise, not more than a third were from " the lanes /       /'   '802      WINE OR WATER. ad and alleys " of the city; the majority were men and women whose standing in society was unquestiona- ble. The meeting was opened by a stirring temper- ance hymn, sung to a familiar melody. A brief but impressive prayer by the chaplain of the Society followed, and then Mr. Turner, the President, ex- plained to the audience, the reason of a change of speakers, and introduced the "Rev. Mr. Staunton, late of W---, how of this city." Addressi'ng the officers in the customary saluta- tion, and bowing to the 'ladies and gentlemen" before him, he advanced aVstep or two on the plat- form, and then remained peAectly quiet, till he knew that every eye was fixed upon him. Slowly lifting his right hand, he brushed back from his forehead, a mass of raven hair, and pointing to a long purple line that disfigured the otherwise fair temple, said, earnestly, "Do you see that? it is my text1 "And then, throwing his soul into the subject he spoke for an hour or more on the horrors of intemperance. He did not generalize merely, as too many eakers do, but he brought it home to every heart byiodqi- vidlualizing the vice. He told them of his own sad" boyhood, told Xt with a pathos that brought tears to every,eye, told it as a story, a story of one far dis- tant, and then, while every hearer was with the poor boy in spirit, he again lifted the raven locks from his forehead, and in low thrilling tones said to them, "I was that boy?"    TAKING AND BREAKING.      203 "Doo you wonder," and his voice swelled in accent, " do you wonder that with such memories, I sealed myself in early manhood, to a life of tem- perance? do you wonder that wherever I go, I plead the cause of the inebriate. What my father was, thousands of men now are; what my mothelr suffered, thousands of women are suffering at this moment; what I endured while a child, thousands of children are now enduring. Manhood, woman- hood, childhood is every day and every hour sacri- ficed to the demon of alcoholic drink. How long, my friends, shall these things last? How long shall wives shudder to hear their husband's footsteps, and children hide at a father's voice? Who will rally-- ah, let me rather say, who will not rally to the good cause of temperance? How many of you are going to sign this pledge, to-night?" and he waved it as though it were a banner, and he a soldier who was ready to plant it on a conquered citadel - "sign this declaration of independence, as glorious a one as that our forefathers signed in days of yore; Come up, my friends, come up.

J Amongst them went Aleck Parkman I As he wrote his name, a woman was borne faint- ing from the hall. It was his wife. As he sat down again, three little boys ran crying from the crowd, nor stayed their steps till they had reached their home, and told their sister Rose, amidst many sobs, that ': father had signed the pledge." "Shall you be busy to-morrow evening?" asked Mr. Turner, as he parted with Mr. Parkman and his wife at the gate of their cottage. ' O no," was the reply. "Then my wife and I will drop in and spend the evening." Thoughtful man I He knew by experience, how terrible the re-action that follows such intense ex- citement as Parkman had known that day, and he was resolved to spare no means to keep it up, till his brain and heart should settle down to its normal state. There was a pleasant gathering at that home on Monday evening, Fred and Essie, and William and Marion joining Mr. Turner and his family; a fire was kindled in the parlor grate, the astral lamp was filled land lighted, the piano opened, and a flute brought from a bureau drawer. First Essie and then Marion played, while the rest sang chorusses;   TAKING AND BREAKING.      805 then Mr. Parkmon led -his wife to the music-stool, and while she played and sang, he accompanied her simple airs. These were but holy memories clus- tered around them, and while many a tear glistened upon the white and ebon keys of the piano, many, many too, rippled upon the silver ones of the long- silent flute. "You have not been well enough to come up to our conference meetings, since our new minister came," said Mr. Turner to Aleck, as he held his hands at parting. "But I hope to see you amongst us hereafter. Can't you come to-morrow night? I will send the carriage for you, we need your tenor voice, and your wife's sweet air, for our singing is congregational. What do you say? I' "I shall be glad to come. It will help my weak- ness." He went and his wife went with him. "Have you tickets for our Lyceum, this winteP." asked his friend, as he parted from him that night. ' No."  "Here are a couple of extra ones that belong to me by virtue .of my office. My wife and I will drive around for you to-morrow night. We are looking for something brilliant. Don't fail to be ready, if you feel able. You will be well repaid." He went and his wife with him. "Mr. and Mrs. Staunton take tea with me to-mor- row evening, for the first time since their settle- ment," said Mrs. Turner, as they stood on -the   306      WINE OR WATER, Lyceum steps, awaiting the carriage. "May I not look for you and your husband, Mrs. Parkman?" "If he keeps well, I think you may." "And mind, Mr. Parkman, and not forget that flute. "Auld Robin Grey," has been sounding in my dreams for the last two nights, and I want so much to hear it again, wide awake. You won't dis- appoint me, now." It was delicate flattery, given with woman's tact, and helped to strengthen the feelings of self-respect which the last few days of reformation had engen- dered. "Has Essie told you of our nocturnal guest?" said Fred to his cousins, as they were left alone in Mr. Turner's parlor for a few moments before tea. "No." "Well, then I must. You see, last night, just as we were undressing, the door-bell rung with such a peal that I thought the wire must snap for certain. Essie turned pale as death, and as for me, I shook in my slippers, and then bounded down stairs six steps at a time. Essie stumbled after me, holding on to my dressing-gown. I turned the key, and opened the door. It swung back heavily, but the stoop was empty. I stepped out. No one was in sight. As I turned to go in, my hand struck against an ice-cold form, that seemed clinging to the door. What think you it was, Aleck?" "One of the Kilby ghosts."

But to- -morrow they must all come." They did, and what a holiday it was for those children. Saturday evening brought William and Marion to the cottage to spend the Sabbath with themh, and thus the week ended happily, with just enough healthy stimulus to keep the new-born goodness from a wistful looking back or a maniac depression. The next week was much the same, and at its close, just as Aleck was getting restless with increas- ing strength, Mr. Turner offered him a situation in his counting-room. "Not as good a one as I would like for you, but it will keep you above board this winter, and may- hap in the spring, something better will turn up." Though not very lucrative, it was. an office of co-   308      WINE OR WATER. siderable trust, and the recipient was deeply affected by the confidence which it implied. "Dare you trust me?" "I dare, my friend; did they not trust me eigh- teen years ago? I do not fear for you." He had no need; for never was man more faithful to his duty than Aleck Parkman, when in his sober senses. What a happy winter that was! The husband's earnings were abundant for all the necessities of life, and they were emptied into his wife's hand, each Saturday night. Rose resumed her studies at the academy, Aleck and Nattie were sent to the High School, while Lewis and Abbie trudged away, hand in hand, towards the nearest district. A capable woman was hired to assist in the house-work, and time thus afforded to the weary wife and mother to recruit her wasted energies. There was no lapsing on the part of Mr. Park- man. He began each week by attending church with his wife and children, employing the interludes of worship with profitable reading. Sunday eve- nings found him at the temperance meetings, not a silent auditor, either; now, he led the singing, then made the prayer, and often gave thrilling episodes from his own career. None gave the redeemed a warmer grasp of the hand than he ; none spake more kindly to the' new-pledged brother. Tuesday eve- nings found him at the conference meetings, and   TAKING AND, BREAKING.     309 Wednesdays at the Lyceum, and his wife was ever witL him. Then there were pleasant evenings in the little parlor, and quiet evenings in the dining- room, when a bright fire upon the hearth gave a cheerful look to it, worn and shabby as was its furniture. The piano was tuned, and the flute kept ever on the table. Newspapers gathered on the hanging-shelves, and new books crept in between them. There were smiles instead of tears, kind words instead of threats, and caresses where had been blows. Heaven seemed very near Mrs. Park- man and her children during that winter. ' What a beautifier happiness is," said Fred to her one day. "D   you know, Mary' you look ten years younger than you did six weeks ago?" "I know that' I feel so," she said touchingly. "6 There is no elixir like love, cousin." About this time the California fever began to rage. Rumors of the golden wealth hidden amongst the rocks of that far-off land, had from time to time, for a year or two before, startled the dwellers of our Atlantic cities j but by most persons they had been deemed fabulous, and after a thought or two were quietly forgotten. But during the winter, the whole world was electrified by the discoveries of gold mines without number, by the-reports of cities and towns springing up as by magic, and pf fortunes made in a single day. The most intense excitement prevailed every where, but particularly in the Eastern States. It saddens me, even now, to remember how reck-   310      WINE OR WATER. lessly men parted with the hoarded savings of years to procure an outfit as a miner, and how carelessly they parted from wives and children, how ruthlessly tore themselves from all the associations of early life, in their frenzy to reach the promised land, and to handle its shining treasures. Amongst those who ciught the fever was Aleck Parkman. He thought he saw here a way opened by which he could in a few years entirely retrieve himself as a business man, and probably accumulate a handsome fortune. The more he studied the sub- ject, the more satisfied he became, and one evening early in March, he surprised and distressed his wife, by saying to her, as he threw down the evening pa- per, " if I had the means, I would go to California this spring." "You, Aleck-to California-in earnest?" "Yes, Mary, in earnest.   Why shouldn't I? Two or three years there would do more for me than a dozen or twenty here. O, you needn't cry," see- ing that tears were dropping silently on to her sew- ing. "There's no probability that I'll go. It costs something to get there, and it costs something, too, to get an outfit. There's no use, I suppose, in my even thinking about it," and then he fell into a brown study which lasted till bed-time. "Wouldn't you be willing to have me go, Mary, if I could bring back money enough to buy High -Bank, and have enough left to live at our ease, say,   TAKING AND BREAKING.     . 3" wifey?" and he slipped an arm around her in the old, lover-like way.  "I don't know I can't think," and she sobbed aloud.  "We 've been so happy here, this winter," and she hid her face in his bosom. "There, there now, wifey; don't take on so. We won't say another word about it. I'd rather live it. a hut with you, than see you feel so bad," and he. tenderly soothed her. But that was not the end of it. Again and again the matter was, talked over, and finally Mrs. Parkman was induced to give her consent to his going, if he could obtain means to pay his passage, and purchase his outfit. What she suf- fered before she could bring her mind to this, those only knew, who, like her, have tasted of the cup of joy, only to see it shiver in their hands. A council of Parkman's friends was called, and the matter laid before them. They had expected it, and had talked it over in private. They felt that a new country, with its peculiar temptations, was no place for one so recently emancipated from the vice of inte'mperance, and yet, it was a delicate matter to even hint at to him. His conduct had been above reproach so far; every act had been strictly honora- ble, and not once had he manifested the least inclina- tion to return to his evil courses. Strong in himself, should they doubt him? "I have built no castles," said he. "I expect, if I go there, to be a worker to dig many a day   312      WINE OR WATER. without finding a grain to reward my toil. But I believe the chances are more in my favor-there than here. People do get rich quick there, why may not I? I do not ask an immense fortune. To become the possessor of my wife's old home, with money enough at interest to keep us comfortable, is all I want. From two to five years' labor there, will give me so much, I feel assured. What do you say, friends?" What could they, only " go! ) He went. A joint stock company was formed at that time, who were to purchase a vessel and fit it out with provisions enough to last a year after they should reach San Francisco, and with such mining implements as should be necessary, and a small store of such goods as would, probably be marketable. Poor men took up the savings of years, and bought a share; ;rich ones invested a portion of their wealth, and bought half a dozen, sending some poor man in their stead. Amongst the latter was registered the name of Turner, and as his substitute, Aleck Parkman. All -the expenses were borne by the principal, and not one of the company had a better or more substantial outfit, while an hundred little delicacies, both of dress and food, were provided by other friends. With characteristic generosity, too, Mr. Turner would have assumed the whole care of the helpless family. It had been decided, even before Aleck   TAKING AND BREAKING.      813 thought of leaving, that the cottage must be sold. The mortgage nearly covered its value, and if it could be lifted, the place was no longer a desirable home. Emigrants had crowded in on all sides, and the neighborhood could no longer be called decent, much less respectable. But O, the pangs that tor- tured Mary Parkman's heart at this decision. Di- lapidated and dingy as it was, shut in too, by the abodes of vice and squallor, it was yet her home, Here she came on the morning after her bridal, here she had lived all her wedded life. Every room had its haunting memories. In that front chamber, her nine children had been born, and there her twins had been laid out. In that spare room, her father and mother, and other loved ones had slept when they came to visit her. In that nursery, she had tended one after another of her little ones. In one corner there yet stood Rose's bedstead, and in the other, the broader one where Abbie and Marion slept; in the bed-room adjoining, Willie and Harrie had once slept, and Aleck and Nattie slept there now, and Lewis in a cot beside them. Farther on, had bee"n Maggie's room, and she had left it only to be car- ried to her last, long home. Down stairs, parlor and dining-room, bed-room, kitchen and pantry, had each its touching memories.' Even the wood-shed had its spell, for from those two cross-beams yet hung a swing which Harrie and Wilhe had put up, and there, just as they left them, hung their little skates, dusty and rusted.   814      WINE OR WATER. Did you ever think, my friends, of the heroism there is in the- prose life all about us? No poet will ever sing Mary Parkman's praises, and yet, to my mind, when she so quietly gave up that cottage, she  was a truer heroine than hundreds who have been the theme of songs. Mr. Turner offered them as a substitute, the dunn-white home which Marvin had deeded to his wife years before. A splendid man- sion was now his residence, but he had never ceased to care for that little spot. He had ever kept it in perfect repair and beautified it in every possible way. One after another poor widow, with little helpless children, had found a refuge in it, -till better days dawned on them. But this spring found it empty, and the household goods of Parkman were now car- ried there, followed by his sobbing wife and tearful children. Rose was to live with Fred and Essie. Two years would complete her course at the academy, and they assumed all the expenses of that time. "It- is no charity," said Staunton, as Aleck remonstrat- ed, "I shall expect one of your biggest nuggets when you return. I am only laying up something against a rainy day." "And you shall have it, Fred -perhaps yet own this old place, to which you and Essie have taken such a notion." Aleck, the younger, was cut out for a merchant, so every one said, and Mr. Turner gave him a place   TAKING AND BREAKING.      315 in his own counting-room, on the same terms as other beginners, board and clothes. He was to live at home, and the three dollars a week, which he re- ceived as board money, were to be paid punctually to his mother. Nattie had always said he would be a farmer, and William and Marion were only too glad to have an excuse to take him on their farm, board and clothe him, and pay what was left over of his' wages to his mother. The younger children were to remain at home, Mr. Turner being the fami- ly banker, whose drafts were to be refunded by Parkman, with his first earnings. All was settled, and one sunny morning in May, Mrs. Parkman and her children stood on the wharf, and saw the vessel glide gracefully from its moorings, and pass out of sight. A -California widow  Had the grave claimed him, she could hardly have suffered more than she did that night, when she locked her front door, and knew that every moment was carrying him further and further from her. How patiently she waited for the first letter, how meekly she bore her loneli- ness, how hard she struggled to economize, how faithful she was to every duty, let me testify, who knew her well. /But Aleck told me once in confi- dence, " he wished I would find out what ailed mother, for he believed she walked the floor half of every night." A long letter came from "Rio," a letter she was *'           *   316  .    WINE OR WATER. proud to read to her friends, so full it was of graphic descriptions of the voyage, and so running over with affectionate promises and counsels. And yet we no- ticed that her face grew paler afterwards, and her manner restless and troubled. Had she a hidden - sorrow? Aye, she had. It came to light one blustering December night, when a few of us had waded to our knees in snow, to reach her. A baby-boy, whose tiny hands were folded above its heart as hers had been in all those lonely nights when she had walked her chamber, and whose feeble voice moaned ever alow, sad note, which seemed half sigh, half groan. Poor Mary Parkman! Perhaps it was wrong in us, yet we all breathed a -prayer of thanks, when, three days later, we shroud- ed that baby and put it out of sight. I cannot bear to speak of the suspense that all en- dured during those weary months, when we knew not whether the vessel had safely doubled the storm Cape, or whether with shivered masts, it llad gone down with its precious freight. At last there came letters. It had arrived safely at San Francisco, and' all were well. The reports which had reached the East were more than verified, they said. Gold was to be had for the digging; labor commanded extrav- a  agant prices; it was a man's own fault if he did not get rich. They had concluded to dissolve the com-   TAKING AND BREAKING.     317 pany, sell the vessel, divide the profits, and go, every man, as and where he pleased, those who had come out as agents holding themselves responsible to their principals for all that had been advanced and a fair per centage on their labors. Parkman was, not go- ing to the mines at present. He had opened a sa- loon in the new city, and expected to coin eagles soon. The next letter--the intervals were longer far than they are now-brought Mrs. Parkman a gold ring--" a pledge," her husband wrote, 1" of unbrok- en promises." With the same mail came one to Mr. Turner, enclosing a check for an hundred dollars, "the first fruits of our enterprize." The next letter brought a ring for Rose, with a promise of one for Abbie in the next, and at the same time Mr. Turner received another check for an hundred dollars. The next letter - three months between these last- brought neither ring nor money. It spoke of sick- ness and losses by fire, and a weary journey to the mines, and unsuccessful diggings. After that there came no letters, but rumors that blanched the cheeks of his wife and children. Years passed. One, two, three, four. A returned Califor- nian was waited upon one day by a pale, sorrow- stricken woman. "I am Mrs. Parkman," she said, with touching cadence, "6 wife of that Aleck Parkman, who went out with you. I want to hear from you exactly what he is, and how he is doing."   318      WINE OR WATER. He could not put her off. "It is true, I know," she said. And so he told her. Can I write it? must I tell you that, breaking his pledge, he had become one of the lowest loafers in San Francisco? Poor Mary Parkman! A few days after she called a council of her friends, and told them what she had learned. "I must now depend upon myself," she said firm- ly. ' That Mr. Parkman will ever refund you, Mr. Turner, for what you advanced for him, for what you advanced for his family, I can no longer hope-" "Do not speak of it, my friend, and above all things, don't, let it worry you. What I advanced for him and lost, was all in the way of business. I have lost as much and more every year, but it has never cost me a sleepless night. What I have ad- vanced for you is the merest trifle. Some one would have had the cottage rent free, if you had not, for I should 'deem it sacrilege to take a cent of pay- for t  that little Mecca of my heart. And you have econ- omized so closely, made the garden and the fruit so profitable, that with what Aleck, and Nattie and Rose have given you, there has hardly been any- thing for me to do." She smiled. "It is a more blessed to give than to receive, my friend, so I will believe the happiness you have enjoyed in doing for me has more than recompensed you for your time and money, But   TAKING AND BREAKING.      819 now I must do for myself. I received a few days' since, gf letter from the Principal arid proprietors of the Institute in which Rose has been teaching for the last two years. Her health is failing, and she wishes to withdraw from any active superintendence of the school. She has given the post of Principal to Rose, with a salary of six hundred dollars, and wishes me to become the matron of the boarding department. She will charge only a low rent for the use of the rooms and furniture, and let me have all I can make. The children are to accompany me, and Abbie and Marion will have free tuition in ad the English branches. Lewis will have the care of the garden and out-door business, and' can study evenings with Rose. My own suite of rooms will be unfurnished, and I can thus surround myself with my old furniture. The children will all be with me but Aleck and Nattie, and they are now so near manhood that I must be willing to trust them to themselves. Had I not better accept the offer? Housekeeping you know, is my forte, and I have long been used to a large family." "' If you will work, it is the best thing you can do, Mary," said Fred, " but you know my home and heart is open to you." "And mine," said William. "And a life lease of the cottage, if she will take it," said Mr. Turner. She shook her head. They understood well that her mind was decided. *A"-';,.1.:,   , As .    320      WINE OR WATER. "If you will go, Mary," continued Fred, " you must first consent to-- " he paused. Her face became ghastly white, and she set her upper teeth into her under lip till blood oozed from the broken skin. She knew what he would say. She had thought it all over by herself, in the long, lonely watches of the last year, but she had never yet spoken the word; it choked her even to think it, "To get a divorce from your husband. It is four i years now since he left you, and in all that time he has sent you not a penny. I will not say that he is hopelessly lost. If he were here, or we there, we might yet save him; but shut out from all the pure influences of home and friendship, in a city where men are too busy making money to think of saving souls, we can do nothing but let him go. It is not likely he will ever return here, but if he should, no matter how fallen he is, he could claim your earn- ings - take from you - " "Don't Fred, don't," she cried pitifully; "I know all you would say. I know that for my children's sake! and because of an unjust law, I must be divorced; but I cannot bear to talk of it. I leave the matter entirely with you. Do as you think best with it. But for my children, I would cling to him, go to the uttermost parts of the world to save him.

That he was a miner, [ was evi- dent from his slouched hat, red flan- nel shirt, heavy denim overalls, coarse boots, sunburnt face, horny hands and long beard. That he was one, too, who had been eminently successful in his diggings, was also evident by the hearty grasp and warm tones with which he was greeted in that office.

Patience and perseverance are the only safe roads to wealth, and this isjust as true in California as in New England. There is our placer, for instance more than a dozen experienced miners had prospected it and left it, saying, you could put all the gold there was there in your eye and see clear with it. My brother and I happened on it accidentally, and were both satisfied at once, from various circumstances, that there was gold there, and we commenced digging forthwith. Days passed before we found anything - weeks went by, and, we only paid our expenses - but we stuck to it, and at last struck the, vein which we had believed, almost knew, must be there. Now, we dig only a certain number of hours each day, and count our profits by thousands. No luck about it, you see. Had the first comers been patient and persevering, they would- have been where we are now.

There had been for some time a confused noise in the room below, loud, angry words seeming to min- gle with blows and scuffles, but now the tones rose higher and higher, till the words, " you lie, you vil- lain, you cheated, and you know you didj" were clearly borne through the thin partition. "Take that for your words, and go to ---with it," was the reply, in a tone of mingled rage and violence, and in a second the sharp report of a revolver, fired three times in succession, resounded through the building. There was the fall of a heavy body, a shriek, a few groans, and then an outcry of "murder, murder." "It's only a drunken row in the saloon below," said the cashier, coolly. "If they get along with one a day we think they do pretty well, down there. No less than three dead men have been carried out this week." { "And yet, you stay here, right above them -how   AFTER MANY DAYS.       825 can you endure it?"   The miner spoke with feeling.

"Dead men's groans thrown in," said the miner, bitterly. "Do you wonder that I long to find my- self again in the land of steady habits?  God for- bid that I should ever get hardened to such scenes as are daily enacted here." At this moment a clerk entered the room. "What's the row, now, down stairs?" asked the cashier. "O, a fight between old Parkman and Haynes. Parkman charged Haynes with cheating, last night, at cards; the other denied, when Parkman gave him the lie, and Haynes settled the matter with his re- volver; pretty effectually, too, I guess, for Parkman lies stiff as a dead horse." "Small loss he is, too," said the cashier, quietly, "The town is rid of one vagabond more." "What name did you say -  who's killed?" ask- ed the miner, who had been listening intently. "Old Parkman; did you ever know   him?  By the way, now I think of it, he's from Connecticut, the same State you hail from, isn't it?"

"Aleck--Aleck Parkman; a splendid looking man he was, too, when he first came here; but he took to drinking and gambling, and this is his end." "Aleck Parkman I Good heavens I Rosabelle's father -here -dead?!' and the listener bounded down the stairs, and rushed breathlessly into the saloon. Three or four rough looking creatures were lifting the wounded man on to a broad plank, and attempting to straighten his distorted limbs. "What are you going to do with him?" asked the new comer. "Carry him just outside the city, for the crows to pick. They've had a mortgage on him this long while," and a brutal laugh was echoed by his com- panions. Mr. Richards put his hand inside the gory shirt, and gently felt above the heart. "He is not dead --there was a hard throb just then - take him to the nearest physician's office, and I will settle with you for your trouble." "He'll die before we can get him there," said one, gruffly. "Obey me," responded Richards, in a firm, authoritative tone. They did so, and the bloody mass of flesh, bones and rags, was soon set down before the office of one of the most skilful surgeons in the place.   / AFTER MANY DAYS.       327 "What kind of a subject have you brought me, here?".said Dr. Mann, as Mr. Richards motioned him to come out. "I want you to save that wretched man's life, if it be in your power; save it on your own terms." "It's hardly worth saving," replied the doctor, as pushing back the matted locks from the white face, he recognized the features. "The most miserable vagabond that ever came amongst us." "Life-- human life is ever worth saving,' said the younger man, solemnly. "Low as he is now, he was once the noblest of men, the most generous of benefactors. There is good in him yet-I- feel it--I know it. But this is no time for explanation. Save his life if you can. I will give you a dollar for every moment you spend on him." "Bring him in," said the doctor, curtly. "And now clear the office of all but my student. Wait in there," pointing Mr. Richards to an inner room. It seemed hours to the young man before he was sum- moned out. "I can give you but little hope," said the doctor; "yet,   since  you wish it, I will do what I can for him. His left leg must come off, close up to his body, too.  With his blood in the inflammable state it is, I cannot attempt to heal that wound; mortification ;would ensue in twenty-four hours. The one about his breast is slight, the bullet having its strength spent by something in his watch-pocket.   328      WINE OR WATER, But I tell you honestly, I can do but little for him besides amputating the limb and dressing the wound. It's quiet and good nursing that must cure him if anything does, and it'll be a tedious job for whoever undertakes it." ' All that I am I owe to him," said the young man.  "It's a life for a life. I shall not flinch, though it take months and years. Where can I find a quiet home for him?" "A tent just outside the city will be the best you can do for him unde r the circumstances. I've a litter you can use ; money will hire men to bear it, and money will furnish you with a tent and bed and all necessary things. But be quick; his life hangs on a thread. .I've dressed the wound in his heart, and staunched those on his leg. I cannot remove that till he is in permanent quarters." An hour afterward a litter was seen passing out of the city, preceded by a dray, containing a tent and all the fixtures of camping. A breezy knoll, high and dry, and shadowed by a broad-spreading tree, was selected as the ground, and in another hour, the wounded man was borne inside a com- fortable tent and stretched upon a surgeon's table. "Remember, now, -quiet, air, cleanliness, diet, sleep--in a word ---nursing is all that will save him. On you, more than on me, rest his cure, now, I will come every day to see him, and if any bad symptom ensue, send for me at once." And with   AFTER MANY DA&.       829 another look at the bandages, another pressure of the feeble pulse, the surgeon departed,;and Mr. Richards was left alone with that wreck' of man- hood. Just at sunset as he was moistening the parched lips of the yet unconscious man,: he was startled to hear his name spoken in a suppressed voice. Looking up he saw a figure on the threshold of the tent. Motioning the intruder away, he fol- lowed him in a few moments, and as soon as they left the camp a few yards in the distance, he grasp- ed his hands warmly, exclaiming, "Mason, the man, of all others, unless it was my brother, that I was longing to see. Do tell me, how you learned I was here?"  "It's a short story, Georgie, I came to town this afternoon, and hastened to the express office, having. quite a quantity of dust to send off. While there, some one mentione your name in connection with a large deposit, and I immediately inquired if you had been there lately. 'Yes,' they said, 'this forenoon.' And then they gave me a confused account of a brawl down stairs, and your carrying off one of the parties, who was at first supposed to be dead; I could hardly get head or tail to it, but I managed at - last to find out the physician employed, and learned that It was an old friend of yours, and you were bound to save his life if possible. Who is it, pray? I didn't learn his name." I 4' Do you remember, John, a man by the name of   8330      WINE OR WATER. Aleck Parkma/h? he was a near neighbor to you when you were a boy." "Remember Aleck Parkman! indeed, that I do. He was -the best friend my poor mother ever had. Many and many a time has he saved her from the :fury of my!drunken father. But what of him?" "He lies in yonder tent." "Aleck Parkman, in yonder tent I " and he start- ed for it, but was restrained by the hands of his companion. "Yes, he is there, or the wreck of him, rather; but his life hangs on a thread." ":But how came he :there? how came he in Cali- fornia? tell me, Georgie; it's long since I've heard any Connecticut :news. The decease of my parents and :the removal of my sisters to the West, have seemed to sever me entirely from my native State." "Sit down here and I will t11 you :all I know, which is buit little. The last :tme I saw Parkman was in his own home, at Pleasant View. He was then a reformed man, having taken the pledge a few weeks before. He was in good spirits and so were his family, though I heard from the lips of Rosa- belle, a story which made my heart ache. But their trials were all over then, and they were look- ing to a happy future. That was in the winter, and early in the spring, I sailed on that disastrous voyage of which I have before told you the parti- culars. You know all about the mutiny of my crew,   AFTER MANY DAYS.

Though extremely anx-iots to hear of and from :my old friends; I would not -write them at once, knowing that ;Parkman's generosity 'would lead him to send me assistance at once, and I felt already too deeply in debt to him. So I de- ferred my letters, till by six month's hard labor I had got a fair start again, when I wrote, detailing my -misfortunes and adventures. I waited and wait- ed, but no answer came. I wrote again and again, and finally in despair directed my letter to Mr. Staunton, Mrs. Parkman's cousin,-whom, of course, you remember. Three months :ago I heard :from him. After telling me that it was like hearing from the dead, for they had all supposed :me dead, he says, I sent the letter immediately to Mrs. Parkman and Rose, who are now residing about a hundred miles from  here, in the State of Massachusetts V They have been there two years, ever since mIn cousin obtained her divorce, and are doing finely in their school; and then he spoke of the rest 9f 'the children, but not a word of Mr. Parkman.

It seems he came to California that same spring that I sailed: did' tolerable well fora few months, and then lapsed into his former dissolute habits, and Mrs. Parkman, after waiting more than three years for assistance from him, was obliged, in justice to herself and children, to apply for a divorce. But you shall see the letter to-morrow." "And are you going to nurse him, and try and save his life " 4"Yes, and his soul, too. All that I am I owe to him and his angel of a wife. I can never, never forget what a wretched hole he rescued us from; never forget that he buried my mother from his own house; reformed my father and gave him a fair start in the world; adopted Ned and I into his heart and home, educated us and allowed us to choose our own calling, getting a good berth for us both in one vessel. I will save his life if I can- I will reform him if I can--I will make a rich man of him, and then I will take him home to his wife and chil- dren - "And I'll join you, Georgie.

AFTER MANY DAYS.       333 Shading the lamp which he had lighted, Mr. Richards held it above the face of the sick man. Tears streamed down the honest face of John Mason, as he looked at his old neighbor, and he -went out into the darkness and sobbed. Days and weeks passed, and the two young men were faithful to their trust. As the surgeon had apprehended, a low, nervous fever set in, rendering his situation more precarious than before, and in- deed, frightened their' before infant hopes. But not for a moment did the watchers relax in their care or vigils. They would do their duty and trust in God. Meanwhile, it was pitiful to hear the ravings of their patient, Never once did he speak of his California life, but away back wandered his mind to the days of his innocence and virtue. Now he was climbing the mountains beyond High Bank, with his betrothed Mary on his arm, whispering his beautiful thoughts; then he was walking from church with his Pride beside him, commenting on the psalm that had been read, the hymn that had been sung, and the sermon that had been preached.  Now he was hanging over the cradle of his twin infants, in the ,ecstasy of hope- ful fatherhood, and then lifting them up to the altar to receive the holy christening rite. Now he was sing- ing to his little daughter Rose, and- then dandling Aleck or Nattie, chirruping to Lewis or Abbie, or pinching the dimples of his little "maid Marion." No thought of bacchanalian revels, no memory of I ' I    334      WINE OBR WATER, wanton vice seemed ever to flash across his mind, only the pure, and true and beautify came to him in those feverish visions. It was as though an angel had blotted out from his soul's tablet all record of his sin; as though the scarlet of his life had been washed away. At length the crisis came and passed, and the sur- geon said to the watchers, "there is hope, now; only be careful." They were careful; careful as a mother is, whose darling has been snatched from the-threshold of the tomb. -They spared neither time, money, labor or strength. Their sunburnt faces became white again, and their calloused hands soft and pink in that long vigil. The convalescent sat bolstered up in his bed, cull- ing now and then a dewy strawherry, from a little basket that hat d just been brought in. The young men were eyeing him tenderly and marking with pleasure the zest with which he swallowed the fresh fruit. Suddenly he looked up to them, and asked in a quivering tone, "Who are you - angels?" They smiled, and said, cheerily, glancing at their rough costume, " do we look like angels?" "You act like them-who are you?"  He spoke earnestly. "Friends."   AFTER MANY DAYS.       835 "Friends! who sent you to me?" "God, who in other days sent you to us." "What do you mean? sometimes when you look at me, there are glances in your eyes that seem famil- iar; sometimes, when you speak to me, their :are tones in your voices that have a ring of other days. Tell me, did I ever know you?" "You did; and when you are strong enough you shall know all." "Tell me now; I can wait no longer." They hesitated, but at length gratified- him. He listened quietly, but his pillow was wet when they had finished.       ' "Then you," to Richards, " are one of those little beggar boys who came to my house one rainy day in autumn?" "Yes, sir." He covered his face with his hands, and murmured softly, she said, "I should find it after many days!" Looking up after a while, he said to Mason, "and youe are that little Johnnie with whom my twin boys were wont tcr play--" "Whose mother was obliged to call upon you night after night for help." "Aye, aye," and again he hid his face, and again he murmured, " after many days." He lay very still for awhile, so still that they thought he slept, and were stealing quietly out of the tent, when he suddenly lifted himself up inA i ... e           v - 2,.,    3836     WINE OR WATER. erect, sitting posture, and said wildly, "ado you know, boys, what a wretch I am? Hush! don't speak yet. Do you know that after twelve years of total abstinence, I took a glass of brandy to drown my sorrow -a fatal glass followed by dozens and hundreds - that I drank, drank, drank, till all glad- ness was shut out of my wife's and children's hearts -all joy out of my home; till I became a very devil, starving them, freezing them, beating and cursing them - till I was so bad that I even loathed myself, and drank to drown my individuality, my memory, my conscious existence Do you know that I reformed after years, aye reformed, became a decent man, had a happy home again, a smiling wife and laughing children. "O," and he wrung his wasted fingers, "if I had but stayed there, if I only had! ]But no; I must leave them-must push my fortunes here, must see the golden gates they told me so much about -hell's gates they have been to me; aye, verily, hell's," and he clenched his hands, "with demons to oil the hinges; for a year I strug- gled with temptation-yes, I did struggle, God knows it; and had a single friendly -hand been put out to save me, I had not fallen. But men were too greedy then for the bright gold, to mind a falling brother, and I went down, down, down."  He seemed to choke, and they hastened to him. He motioned them away. "It's nothing, nothing," and sat quiet for a long while. Then looking towards   AFTER, MANY DAYS.      337 them he said in low, thrilling tones, "I took a paper out of the office one day-a paper from home; a marked paragraph met my eye-it was the legal notice of my wife's divorce from me. I do not blame her---did not then; and yet it was a blow-- a blow. From that hour I sought death. What had I to live for? wife, children, friends, all gone. But death would not come, and I drank harder than ever to forget. I forced on the quarrel with my old comrade, Haynes, that morning, because I knew his temper, and knew he -was a good shot, too, and yet, here I am, crippled, it is true, yet with returning health and strength, and amongst friends. Why is it?"H' e looked at them pitifully. It is God's work," said Mr. Richard's, solemnly. "He has saved your life, because there is yet some- thinrg for you to'do."' "What -what can a wretch like me   yet do?" He spoke -the words so earnestly that the perspira- tion started to his face.  "Indeed, much.  You can retrieves lost charac- ter; make a man of yourself- earn a home for the toiling woman who once loved you so well-edu- cate those children who once called you father - be an apostle to the misguided, and a philanthropist to the needy. Do! you can do a thousand things, if you will but be true to the divinity within you." "Then you do not think I am wholly lost?" and he looked wistfully into the young man's face.   338       WINE OR WATER. "Wholly lost! no. No man was ever wholly lost. He is God's child, let him do as he will - go where he may. The lamb is no less a lamb when it wanders to the den of the wolf, than it was when it slept at the side of its dam. Wholly lost! No, no. Because you have forsaken him he has not forsaken you. He is your Father yet. You cannot break the tie-  "God's child- H HGod's child?    Talk to me more, Georgie." He did-talked, and prayed and sung. Verily, that lowly tent on the sands of California, was a church that day -a church as sacred in Heaven's sight, as cloistered abbey or pillared cathedral. When the sunset came, he begged them to carry him to the door. Folding a blanket about his atten- nated frame, they lifted him to the threshold. He watched the crimson and amber tides, as they rip- j pled into the purple shadows, but spoke not, till the last had faded. Then clasping his hands, he said, \ solemnly- ' Behold the western, evening light! It melts in deeper gloom; So calm the righteous sink away, Descending to the tomb. The winds breathe low-the yellow leaf Scarce whispers from the tree! So gently flows the parting breath, When good men cease to be." "When good men cease to be!"   He repeated   AFTER MA-WY DAYS.       339 the lines again and again, and then clasping his hand to his heart, he exclaimed with passionate earnest- ness, "' I will try once more, once more. Bring me your Bible, Georgie,." He took the little farworn volume, and after handling it reverently a while, he placed it on his knees, and folded both hands upon its cover. No word escaped his lips, but the watch- ers felt and knew that a solemn oath was then writ- ten down by the recording angel. Did he keep it? Aye, questioner, te kept it. Kept it through all those tedious days in which he waited for the full measure of his health and strength to come again-kept it through all those months of patient, unremitting toil in the placers of California, when he labored for the wealth that was to gladden others' hearts--kept it on the long, weary journey that bore him  from  the golden gates of the Pacific to the granite bulwarks of Newr England - kept it-kept it!    C   APTEK X. I .I THE    RETU R3N. was rid-summer vaca- tion at the school, and, ac- cording  to  the  custom, Mrs. Parkman had gather- ed her friends and children about her, the better to enjoy the six weeks' respite from care and labor. William and Mari- on had come up from their farm on the Connecticut, and brought their two boys and Nattie, the young farmer with them. Fred and Essie, and Mr. and Mrs. Turner had come t out from the city, and with them had come Aleck, who had risen from the post of errand boy to that of clerk, with a salary of five hundred a year. The school was prospering finely under the joint care of mother and daughter. Rosabella had won for herself a brilliant reputation as Principal, while   THE RETURN-.        341 Mrs. Parkman had made the institution so much like a beautiful home, that the pupils even wept to leave it, and smiled to see it again. It had proved very profitable to them also, and there was'now a fair prospect that a few more years of toil would enable them to become its sole proprietors, when the road to competence would be fairly-open. They were lingering about the tea-table, on the second day of the company's arrival, enjoying that social chat which compensates so deliciously for all the heaviness of morning and the weariness of noon- tide labors, when a domestic entered, and said to Mrs. Parkman that a gentleman was waiting in the parlor to see her; " a young gentleman," she added, emphasising the adjective. The twin roses on the cheek of the young teacher widened and deepened in their bloom, till they left a flush of crimson even on the fair forehead and, snowy neck, while by the earnest way in which she peered at the tea-grounds in her cup, you might have thought she was a sybil reading a human fate. Mrs. Parkipan proceeded to the parlor. A  tall, fine-looking young man met her at the door, and grasping both her hands, exclaimed warmly, " my dear, dear friend, how glad I am to meet you once more." "You have the advantage of me sir, and yet," scanning  his face closely, "there is something strangely familiar in your looks; come to the light," I '    342      WINE ORP WATER. and she led him to a west window and pushed back the drapery, that the sunset glow might fall full on his face. A sudden gleam of joy lit up her fage. "Is it, can it be my California boy?" and sheld his fingers tightly. "Yes, my more than mother, it is Georgie, your long absent one come home again - home to love and peace." For some moments there were more tears shed than words spoken, but then Mrs. Parkman said earnestly, almost passionately, "and you'll never, never go back, Georgie." "That depends on circumstances," he answered, and the color mounted to his cheeks. "I told my California friends that I had left a big part of my heart in Connecticut, and was coming back to hunt it up. If I found it, I should stay; if not - do you think after seven years of absence I can hope to have my search successful?"There was life and death in the tones. "Hope! yes, Georgie, I think you may," and then she whispered softly, "I'll send one whom I think can help you find the lost -treasure," and she turned to leave the room. As she was passing out, he slipped a package in her hands, saying quietly, "Something for you to look at, when you have time." "It was Miss Parkman, instead of Mrs., I think, whom the young gentleman inquired for," she said to Rose. "He waits to see yon,"   ITHE RETURN.       843 Shall we follow the young maiden, as with throb- bing heart and quivering nerves she glides away? One moment! Crossing the parlor threshold, she pauses and seems to hesitate. A figure starts forward - one look and it is at her side. A hand is put forth and clasped, an arm glides quietly about her waist, and with the words, "Georgie," "Rose," there is a meet- ing of young lips, a solemn covenant of hearts long tried, yet ever full of hope and trust. "Who is it, mother?" asked Lewis curiously. "One you will all be glad to see; my California boy." "Georgie Richards," -and he bounded to the door, but was checked by his mother's hand. "To- morrow, perhaps by-and-by, this evening, you shall see him; just now-" "He's engaged," said Mr, Staunton, in a way that brought back the boy's fading good humor. At this moment, Mrs. Parkman's eye fell upon the superscription of the package she had thus far held mechanically., The color left her face, and faint and dizzy she dropped into a chair. "What is it, Mary?" and her cousin hastened to bring the water, while Essie unpinned the collar from her neck, and unhooked the dress. "His, is," .and she pointed her white finger to the handwriting. Fred took the package, and recognized in an in- stant, the bold, yet graceful penmanship.   344      WINE OR WATER. "Better open it at once," he said kindly; " any- thing is better than suspense." She fumbled blindly "at the seals, but her fingers were too weak to break the massive patches of crimn- son wax." "You!"? to her cousin. He obeyed, and from the broad, heavy envelope, dropped a series of legal looking documents. He gathered them up and placed them on her lap. "' Close the blinds and ring for lights," said Essie to Lewis, while all, parents and children, held their breath, as folks do when on the point of startling revelations. Vainly did Mrs. Parkman try to read the papers. Letters and words blended into hiero- glyphics, which were verily Greek to her. "It's no use, Fred, I can't see. You read-read aloud-there can be nothing in them which you all have not a right to hear." Mr. Staunton took them and read them as they were numbered. The first proved to be a warrantee deed, by which, in consideration of a stated sum, a certain piece of property, lying on the banks of the Connecticut, and known familiarly as "' High Bank," became the lawful property of Aleck Parkman and his heirs forever. The second was a deed of gift, by which, in consideration of love and respect, the said farm of "High Bank," became the lawful prop- erty of Mrs. Mary Parkman and her heirs, "to have and to hold forever." The third was also a deed of   THE RETURN.-        45 gift, by which ten thousand dollars, then in certain bank stock, became the lawful property of Mrs. Mary Parkman and her heirs. The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth, were'certificates, by which it appeared that Rose, Aleck, Nattie, Lewis and Marion Parkman, were each the owners of one thousand dollars' worth of bank stock, paying ten per cent. interest. The tenth paper Mr. Staun- ton held for some moments before he could read it, and then his voice faltered many times. It was a bequest of ten thousand dollars to Mrs. Mary Park- man and Frederick Staunton, to be held by them in trust, for the ninth child of the said Mary Parkman, an innocent, nameless son, known as the baby," the interest to be devoted to its support, as was needed, -A j  and  the remnant to be safely invested each year until the child's death, when both accumulated in- terest and principal, shall be donated towards the erection of an asylum for idiots. Little did Mr. Parkman think when drafting that deed, that deed by which he sought to expiate one night of sin, that the little " innocent, nameless son," ".the baby," was sleeping quietly in the Cemetery, beside Willie and Harrie, and that other little baby, on whom a father's eyes never had rested. The last paper was in a sealed envelope, and Mr. Staunton passed it over to his cousin, saying, ," there may be something not meant for us, in this; perhaps you had better go to your room and read it." l               .     346      WINE OR WATER. Essie lit a lamp and carried it to the bed-room for her. Mrs. Parkman followed, but it was long before she could control her nerves sufficiently to tear open the envelope, and only amidst thickly falling tears did she read the letter. It ran thus: MRS. MARY PARKMA :- X My Dear Friend:-You will doubtless remem- per that when I parted from my wife seven years ago, last spring, I told her I should never return to Connecticut until I brought gold enough with me to make her the owner'of her father's homestead, ' High Bank." You cannot, O, no, you cannot have forgotten how faithless I was to the trust she and her friends all reposed in me. But you nor they can never even guess the temptations that assailed me in that distant land, that land of crime as well as gold, nor will you know how hard I struggled against them all.

To Georgie Rich- ards, his brother Robert, and John Mason, young men whose boyhood I had succored, I owe not only my life, but my salvation from the sin that had so fearfully beset me. Through them, under heaven, I once more became a man. And from the day that I pledged myself to reformation, everything seemed to smile upon me; all I touched turned to is'   I             THE RETURN.        347 gold, thus enabling me not only to see once again the shores of my native land, but, to provide for those whom I had left there. I pray you, let no false scruple of delicacy deter you or your children from accepting what is offered you and them. It is honestly yours and theirs, and but for my sins, would have belonged to you and them, years ago. I close with two requests, and I fondly hope, that for " auld lang syne," you will not refuse to heed them.  The first- is, that you permit me to be present at the bridal of your daughter Rose, which I trust you will allow to take place the ensuing autumn. I speak of this event as one of certain occurrence, believing you would not have allowed her to correspond with Georgie Richards, for the last eighteen months, had you not been willing he should win her for a wife. The second is, that you will once a year address me a brief letter, stating your own and childrens' circumstances.           / And that the God of Heaven and earth may bless forever you and them, is the fervent prayer of your old friend- K ALECK PARKMAN. Mrs. Parkman had wept on opening that sheet, but now she sobbed aloud, and all the love that had for years lain crushed within her heart,!rose up   348      WINE OR WATER. again in fairer, lovlier form than ever. On her bended knees, she thanked God for the good news brought her; on her bended knees, she covenanted with him, and asked his blessing on the vow. Passing quietly into the next room, she handed her cousin the letter and whispered, "read it aloud." Then she went into the parlor, and taking a hand of Georgie, said earnestly, "tell me of him." He did, told heri all, all, softening through the details, whenever he could do so. ("And you have faith in him now, Georgie?" She asked the question eagerly. "Yes, Mrs. Parkman, I have. I do not believe he will ever fall again. I do believe he has verily been born again. If he were not a homeless wan- derer, I should not hesitate to say, I know he is safe. But the homeless one has a thousand temptations, which those blessed with home and friends, cannot even guess of, and particularly is this the case, when the lonely one is of a social make, warm-hearted and" genial." The deep silence which followed these words was only broken by the half-suppressed breathing of the trio. Each wondered of what the others were think- ing, and yet, could their hearts have been lain bare, the same thought would have been read in each. After a while the mother rose. As she did so, the young man took her daughter's hand, and said, solemnly, "I have found my treasure. May I have   OIr        '    THE RETURN.        349 I    it; will you, O, will you, be my mother--call me your son?" She placed her trembling hands upon the two clasped ones, and said, with quivering voice, "She is yours; God bless you both, my children." There was but little sleep in that household through the watches of that summer night, and all were glad to greet the sunrise, for it seemed to bring to them new hopes, new joys. Entering the library just after dawn, Mr. Staun- ton was surprised to find his cousin there, busily engaged in writing. He would have retreated, but she said, earnestly, "come in--I am almost through. I have been writing to Mrs. --, to inform her of the range in my own and children's prospects, and to resign my situation as matron. I do not think the news, though sudden, will trouble her very much, as she had a good chance to sell out the whole institution a few weeks since, and would have  done so, but that she saw a prospect-that Rose and I might eventually become its proprietors, and she preferred to favor us." "And will Rose resign, too, or - " "Rose will give up teaching. I last night gave my consent to her marriage with Georgie. He has loved her from the morning that I put her, a baby, in his arms, and bade him tend her, while I went out to prepare his poor mother for her funeral. She has loved him ever since she was old enough to love   350      WINE Ot WATER. any one, first as a sister, afterwards as girls do those whom they have chosen for a life companion. "And you, Mary--" "I shall take possession of High Bank at once." She spoke firmly, a beautiful light shining in her eyes, and a fresh rose blossoming upon each cheek. We dare not attempt to portray the conflicting emotions that surged in Mary Parkman's bosom, as with her children she drove up to the gates of High Bank. She had nerved herself to bear them all, but as her feet touched the broad, flat stone that had lain for nearly a century, embedded in green sod before the porch-that stone upon which, as a child, she had loved to sit and string lilac blossoms into necklaces, or weave violets and king-cups into wreaths- that stone upon which, as a maiden, she had loved to crouch and watch the sunset gather up its gold and crimson robes, and hide itself in purple shadows--upon which, as a bride, she had stood and sung to her young husband - upon which, as a mother, she had toyed with her precious children --upon which, as a daughter, she had trembled and watched midst blinding tears, the hearse that bore away her parents. When she stepped upon that stone, worn smooth by feet that never more should meet her there, her heroism quailed, her poor nerves wilted, and she dropped into a swoon that lasted till her weeping friends and children began to fear that joy had indeed killed lier.   THE RETURN.        851 But a quiet sleep at length stole over her, and she rose on the ensuing day refreshed 'and strong, and was as eager as her family to roam through the haunted rooms, wander over the old garden, and watch the sunshine on the fields. The place had fortunately fallen, into good and careful hands at her mother's death, and she was thus spared the pain of -seeing things run wild, where once they had, been trim. The fruit trees and vines had been carefully pruned, and now drooped low with their precious harvests-the plums had a shade of blue, the peaches were growing round and rosy, the pears yellow and mellow, the apples streaking with gold and crimson, and the grapes tinging with purple. The wheat and oat fields had been cradled, and their rich yields gathered into the deep, broad bins of the old farm, while the new hay, crowding clean up to the swallows' nests, scented it as with vernal dews. The garden was beautiful with summer flowers, many a sun-tinted  California blossom mingling its fragrance and loveliness with the annuals of New England. The door-yard was like a lawn, soft and velvety to the feet, and drowsing in picturesque shadows. The summer-house had fallen to pieces years before, but on the same mound another had been built whose slender trellises were already hidden in delicate vines, the white and crimson stars peeping into pink and purple vases, and gold-colored cups swinging to and fro as if to catch the emerald balls that quivered in the breeze.   '352      WINE OR WATER. A pair of splendid greys were champing in the stable, while harnesses with silver mountings, and a new purple cushioned carriage and a farm wagon of ample size, told that they were destined to be put to service soon. Sleek Durhams were pasturing in the meadows, fat Suffolks sunning themselves in the barn-yard, yellow-legged chickens cackling over fresh eggs, and brown ducks and snowy geese sail- ing upon the pond. Within doors all was in perfect 'order, too. The house had been thoroughly repaired; painted, paper- ed, and furnished, and yet there was no glare of newness, the oaken tints of the wood-work, the neutral tints of the walls, the quaint designs of the carpets, and the antique style of the furniture com- porting so well with the old-fashioned look of the broad, low rooms, that a stranger would have thought the family had dwelt there for a century. Pantry, store-room and cellar had not been neglect- ed either; the shelves of each fairly bent beneath their generous weight of not only necessaries, but luxuries, tropical delicacies mingling their fragrance and beauty with those plain and substantials com- foirts that crown the tea-tables of every Connecticut farm-house. "Thoughtful and lavish as ever," said Mrs. Park- man softly, as she unrolled the great luscious oranges from their white wrappings, lifted the heavy clusters of purple raisins from their- deep   THE RETURN.      -  53 layers, and unfastened the cordage from thoe china jars piled to the brim with guava jelly, ginger root and fig paste. "'Thoughtful and lavish--needy of a home and worthy, too." The third of September, the twenty-seventy anni- versary of her own bridal, had been set by-Mrs. Parkman as the wedding-day of her daughter, and it had come " so soon," Rose said, while Georgie declared it had been forever dawning. All was ready. The few invited guests, all of them dear and precious friends, had arrived, and were in their chambers dressing for the evening. Somewhat wearied and a good deal fluttered, the mother and house-keeper, after giving a last look at the parlors and dining-room, to be sure there was nothing amiss, had wandered off to the arbor, to cool and rest herself, to look dreamily into the past and wistfully into the future. , The self-invited guest had not yet come, and she queried with herself, as she had a dozen times be- fore, how she should meet him. Could she calmly shake his offered hand, and call him "Mr. Park- man?"--could she after seven years of absence, and he, her husband for a score of years, he, the father of her children! Her head grew dizzy, while her heart throbbed so fast that the freshened blood ran races in her veins.  ,            3854      WINE OR WATER. A low foot fall drops on the turf beside the vines; she does not hear it, nor see through the green lacings the crippled form that leans so heavily upon a staff. A shadow drifts before the door wav --she looked up--one glance and she is on her feet-a second and she starts forward. "Mary!" "Aleck I " He opened his arms, he gathered her to his heart, he kissed her lips. The past is as a dream - its sin forgiven, its sorrow all forgotten. Not for you or me was a record kept of the whispered talk that fol- lowed. Sacred to heaven and their own hearts was that sweet, solemn re-union. There were two bridals that evening in the old parlor of High Bank. They whom God had once joined together, biutt whom wine had put asunder became again husband and wife, the bridegroom sealing his own happiness and that of his home by pledging himself to abstain from all that could in- toxicate. "Water always-- never WINE,"-these are his watchwords now. THE  END.   FOR HOME READING, PUBLISHED BY A r, BTos to . NS. No. 25 Cornhill, Boston   2    A. TOMPKINS. PUBLICATIONS.
