dispenBing goodness where she moved-an as
tral light of attraction to many who gazed
to admire. Tier education WaB not neglected
in fact she was fitted to shine in the highest
circles. The 'village Ae4d~wy at 8-, jiac
finished 'no 1'airer apecim~n of polite fetfiah
accomplishment. Though many jewels 'hat
heen burnished there; none had given a unor~
*'~~diating circumference of light; Ibr Myra'r
rue had flown far and wide, and many wor-
vper's had 'strewn t~mptingly at her feet
~'iflbi'iugs more precious in the eya of some
Illun the gold, frankincense nnd inyrrh of
the' Eastern Mw4. Earnest h&amp;d no wcaltlu

t. t~nd~d to utility, while his genius arr ed it-
self in the variegated costumes of rho an of
t letters alone. Deeply versed in phil ophy,
histo'x~y and poetry, he became at th same
time a critic in philology. His tougi was
skillfully eloquent in all the beauties f the
ancient and modern languages. Being s. are-
fully trair'~d by the light of a master mi , he
was fl~ted for tiny sphere in life to whi hu
n~turaL inclinations might direct him.

gor.ce, untiring energy in youth, is the ily
thiiig to ensure you a sucee~sUul career in sv

tended soon to move into the neighborhood to

the ,v~sitora that young Morgati was captivated;
for Miss ~i~ece could not move without his at-
tentions. 'Myra eeemed'coldly indiffer9nt, but
could nqt reject the advances of so recent an

edly stating her attachment to Ernest, and that
r bctbing but death could over dissolve th~ en-
cred bond upon which she had entered. This
was sufficient for her, and was seemingly
sufficient for Morgan; but Morgan was born~a
villain, and quietly thereafter resumed a care-
r less indifference to Myra and the world. But
I his heart was bent on thwarting her futnie

Bruce, post-marked Eatonton, Ga. [t was
skilfully opened by Morgan, read, and the seal
carefully replaced, and allowed to pass through
to its destination. jt was thus that he began
his course of satanic duplicity, feeling perfect-
ly secure from detectior~. This first letter wan
soon answered, and~ the answer carefully read
by the'postmaster as before, and sent on to itS

There was a whitej~id in the employ 'of Mor-

length otie' 'bar' was cut in two, and then the

a long ti~ne, a section was made through it~
The two were then loose at one end and could
be ~,roved nj) or down, or taken entirely out, as
the case might require. Mr. Weller assiste'i
IU*n*at In all these efforts, though he had not
~uoh en-engtb. to work at.it. His wound still
dl.s~bled him. It was about three weeks before
ap?~ng Qourt, they bad lain in jail for nearly
. lo~a~ months already~ and. it was now high time
thtt o~nething should be done, if at all. They
tore their blankets ir~to long shreds, and fast.
ened them securely together, end' attached the
~hole t~ one of the iron bars of their window.
~Wlien the *bole was completed, they conolud.
to make the attempt at midnight.. But bow
get ~way, before they could be overhauled,
was the difficulty. 'They fell upon this expe.
die~t. There was a large barn in sight of the
jail, piled up to the roof with hay. If they
oould get up' into the barn, and stay 'there all
next day, the next night 'they could get away,
for they kDeW that the country would be scoured
en 'the ensuing day. So they did. At the ap-
pointed hour, jiaving noiselessly removed the
bars and easily slid down the improvised rope~
and having cleared the plank fence of the j~iil
yard, they climbed up to the top of the hay
loft, and concealed themselves under the soft
hay'ao' perfectly that 'no ona would ever dream
:~Of such' '~' thing. Thus' they remained th6re
'tllrongh the da~, and it was just as they had
predicted. ' A great outcry 'was raised by the
town's people, au*x a search was' instituted by
mounted men. Some swore they saw them
going u~ the Greytown road, others thought
they *ent down the 1~advilIe Turnpike, but by
night the runners 'bed returned, and found no
*        trace of the tugitives. At' midnight, when all
the sown was in a deep hush, our runaways
stol6 quietly frerri the barn loti., and madi~ their
way, safely eut into the country. What were
they now t#,do? . Together they footed it to
Missiseippi,~keeping in their route all the set-
tied country as they advanced; one week
working as day laborers on some farm, to en-
able them the next week no pay their' way.
Thus several months passed away ere they felt
themselves comPletely out. of danger. Weller
was goii~g home by way of Southern Mi~ai~

sippi, and Ernest now, severed as be was fLv~
all connection with 'the farm in Alabama~ de-
termined to seek his fortune in the Mississippi
Valley. Of course ho could not "'Write home
without risking a chance of recapture. In the.
Valley he commenced as day laborer, and soeu
became overseer. Here he accumulated rapidly,
bought lands and slaves, and rose In ~ few
~eara to be ~ne -of the wealthiest and' moat
successful planters in the Valley. H~ made
but t'ew friends there, living rather a ~reclu~e
life Than. otherwise. Soon after Ernest's disap.'
pparance from the scene of hiS labors in North
Alabama, some one had written Ezra Hopkins
that his over~eer had run away, but that the
farm had been left in good fix. Hopkins sent
out-another mah to take charg'~ of it, and was
puzzle          why Holhingswor~h should
have dese     im so soon, having as yet re-
ceiyed no pay.
Myra mourned him as dead, and refused ~e
be .coniforte&amp; Morgan renewed his suit frowi
time to time, but she told him she had rather
die than to marry him. Twice three years had
expired from the date ~ Erne.st's departure,
and her fathSr had entei~hd the dark vaijey Of,
the shadow of death. He died intestate; his
effects were sold, and morgan bought the lands,
overbidding the means of the widow to retain
them.
Mother and daughter were thus reduced t~
the necessity of living with Jease Clifto; or 'of
becoming depeadant on the forb'earance of
Morgan.
They went to the hospitable ro6f of their
aged parents, who, with open arms and warm
hearts, received them.
Morgan had become the oppressor and a-I-
vantage-taker of all classes.' He shaved 'uotea,
bought and sold negroes, traded and trafficked
in every available product, and as many be-.
lieved, with any and everybody. Nothing was
tho low or vil~ for him to do, if ther -by he
made mousy. i~verybody'hated him, and many
fesi-ed his power. There is no question but
that the note for fifteen hundred brought in
against the estate of John Bruce after his
i~eath,' was a forged one, for rio one had any
knowledge of such a trunsRction between the'
parties.
There was one, however, who had an eye
upon him, and it was no other than . Tommy
Horn, who, though esteemed ignorant by all
the neighbors, yet possessed a great fund of
quiet sagacity. 11e treasured up all of Mor-
han's miadoings for future retribution, and dis-
closed to Miss Myra only his petty villainies.
Morgan had no fault to find with hini; he
thought he was a fool, and consequently that

he couhi not perceiv, his ebliquitien, and he
knew he was attentive to his daily business,
more so than his negroes. He had only ~te
groom his horse, and keep a good fire in Mor-
gan'p rooms. Latterly Morgan had made seve-
ral trips to North Carolina, for the purchase of
slaves,'with the view of taking them West for
sale. In his route ho had bacoin~ acquainted
with the pretty village of Bloomfield, and a
certain cupolaed residence, and its fair inhabi-
tants. After learning, In incidental converse.
tion, the story of the Hollingswortbs, he mani~
fea.od himself much smitten with the charms
'of Mary Wineberg, for be had heard of Hol-
lingsworth's death and knew that the vast pro.
perty accumulated at Wilmington was in store
for the Wineberge. He was cunning enough,
however, not to disclose to them any knowledge
of Hollingsworth, Mary had another beau, for
whom she bad become partially fond, and El.
lick Johnson looked with an~ idiolls eye upon
the ne# corner. . He knew tha/t' such were, of
all men, the most degraded, but Mary seemed
dazzled at the tine appearance of Morgan, and
did not discourage his advances. Her mother
warned, but -Mary seemed bewildered. Mor-'
gsa knew how to boast of his great wealth, so
invidiously as not to arouse a suspicion of his
infidelity; so that Mary actually fell in love
wit , as it appeared, and afte e was
gone thre damper upon tentions of
her quandam a mir , a umNe Buick John-
son. She mused thus, 'well, I'll wait. Mr.
Morgan may come back, and ofier me his band;
he seems an excellent match, and Ellick! I'm
not engaged to him. He might have proposed
long ago, the bashful fellow, and then I'd have
no excuse. Whose fault is it? his I'm sure.' I
know Ehlick won't give me up soon, and if-and
if I don't marry-then I moy-~ Thus her
idle thoughts ran en like tempestuous clouds
drifting along the misty plain of her mind, and
she was thoughtlessly c~ruel, not knowing how
much paul and unhappiness she was entailing
upon others.
'Sister Mary,' Peggy would often say to her,
'if you don't marry Buick, I'll cut you out the
very first chance. I declare, it's a shame. 1
wouldn't do a dog so, sa you done Ellick last
night.' 'Your attentions, Mr. Johnson I can't
receive any more'; oh, you're a nice one, and
all for that poppinjay, speculating Morgan.
You'll b~ sorry for" it some day, I tell you.'
Thus Peggy berated her sister, but Mary said
she-did not deserve such treatment. She might
have Ehlick for what she cared, but as for her,
she intended to have her own choice, or die an
old maid.

Wineberg, but the ~ost.mark on the back was
so faint, and so. many !~e* ones had been *0*

from whence it orig~nahly came. Mrs. Wine-
berg was overwhelmed with qstonlahmen't,
when she ~k&amp;d the contents, which were as

Mrs. ~Wineberg suspected at once It was her
brother, whom she had not beard from for
twenty years, but why this concealment \ske
could not understand. At all evdats, she could
write at once to'Kinlock &amp; Co., that the heir to
the Uolhingsworth estate was still living, and
though she had no proof o? it, she was fully
satisfied upon that ~ubject. That time, she had
no doubt, would reveal more, and that as soon
as she learned more she would disclose it.
'Mr. Halstead, I cannot tell you what 1
would take for the two, said Billy Morgan to
Hollingsworth, who, since his escape from the
Tennessee prison, had assumed the name o~ his
guardian. &amp; They were favorite negroes of Mra.

Halatead. 'Are you satisfied? zu are? Well,

After consultation, the two friends proceeded
to act in accordance with the directions of the
tesยฑator. It was. n~6t difflault. to I~nd the log
cabin on Bush Mountain, but it was very, diffi-
cult to remove . the weighty stone which
eovored the treasure, and their 'acquaintance
with natural philosophy was. sorely put to the
test to invent~ ~ oompound.lever,' by which it
could be overturned. At length, ,,afuer patimit
efforts, they succeeded, but ~t much rust had
accumulated in the lock that was not ea'w to
make the key available in ~eniqg it.. After'
repeated trials, however, this was 'elTeoted, the
treasure removed, the lid replaced, and the
huge stone rolled again to its superincumbent
position. Each pair of sadlle-bage beIongi~g~o
the tWo, received its weIght of the treasure,
and they returned as hastily as possible to
tow.ia in order to avoid ~nspi'oion, and to de-
posit the rloli burden in the privacy of their
apartment. Ernest became the banker and
the guardian of the treasure, and Mr. Weller
commenced his traveling operations of ox-
eban~e brokerage, by which be found that he
increased considerably the original aniount of
the estate, (or gold readily demanded a pre-
mium iii all of the Tennessee banks. Three
weeks were thus consumed when, this part of
the business being nosomphished, Mr. Weller
and l~rneet parted ~he one fbi- his home in
Alabama, the other to pursue his onward
journey to his native land.
At I'inewood 4~all the Brothers Holkins had
been long constant visitors, and Mrs. Wvhler,
in thO exercise of her maternal jurisprudence,
did not regard "the likelihood of matrimonial
alliance with them' by ,any means with die-
favor. The elder brother, Elias, was an ox-
amplar of industry and hardy manhood to all
the youth of the neighborhood. The family,
since their settlement in Alabama, bad risen,
by hard labor, to quite a respectable position
in society, and Elias was the main stake who
had pushed on their little fortune to 'its
present zenith of success. 'They had secured a
small but quite productive farm,' and, by the
production of cotton, with careful~ management,
had become ~the' owners of a few' valuable
slaves. The younger brothm, Isaac, ~mad not
yetarrived at that'a&amp;e at which such a tbing as

matrimony might he looked for. It will no~
surprise the 'inquisitive to lenin that Dettie's
att-achment to Elms became strong, almost ~at
its inception. Many a grape and muscadine
hunt had the boys and girls had together
through the thick~try and vine-entangled
forest, and - many a merry swng from a' high
oak bough, over the ravine, in the old' p~sture-
field had they enjoyed in the wildness and'
harmony of youthful play. Elias ,knew that
Bettie was the best housekoeprin all Gone-
cuh, and he loved her not the l~ss on this ac-
Count, inasmuch as he knew that, if success
should ever cr9wn his efforts, he taust be the
architect of his own fortunes, and lie had
learned the value of home economy. The first
essay of ]~Iias in love-making wss blutidering
az~d lame, as what boy's is not; bulL' Dettic
did not hide her face to giggle, as many silly
maidens do, buL' looked through her smiles
and blushes with such a tender e~reesion,
that, though she answered n~ a word, Ehias
could see that be held the first place in her
sil~ctions. Elias felt greatly restrained while
Mr. Weller was st home, and now that he ws~
gone on a stay of some months, a t1~ic opj*r-
tunity would be afforded him tsr real earnes'~
courtship. It was long before ho could get
himself up' to the point of popping. tho '~ues-
tieD, and he had postponed the terrible ordea
froto week to week, till he began to tear that

tion, woven many pretty speeches, but, '~t th~s
orit.ical moment, hi8 throbbing heart woul I

fuse to call them back again.
But one evening in November, uvhile'en joy-

he had entered, without a struggle,' into th~

In consideration of the fatigue of the' fore.

Ri4erlaiids slept in peace till 'ten o'clock, It

'a ~   you to look at me; as Martin ~orke says, 'I si
approve your lookh3g'at me. i~l55 me again.'
And Elizgbeth held her close and kissed her c
three or four times before she would relea~o the a
astonished prisoner. Annie was fairly as-

her friend! Wonderful!                   t
'What an. astonishing mood to be sure!-

~        I shall look for Elias to kiss rue next, or the (

~he was released now and went into the I

similar rousing of Lydia, who was amazed at
K      such proceedings~ being awaked by a perfect
A       shower of kisses. Becoming jealous of this
monopoly of sweet lips, l~llizabeth rushed .to
the resene, and a romp ensued. It was brokefl
a      up however by the bi~isk little housekeeper,
wI~o warned them to be dressed in ten nun-
utes, and went' down jingling her keys. All
was pleasant at the breakfast table. Eliza-
beth's face wore such a calm and happy cx-
'4~-" 'pression, yet withal so serious; that Alfred de-
clared she must be engaged. - 'For,' he con-
tinned, 'our landlady's daughter looked just
so when she was to be married to the barber's

'flow,' several voices asked, 'because she
was in love?'
~To be suie;and then Shehad 'a new silk
besides-green, sea green, with red stripes-
Oh, she was so happy!
And with this declaration of the abounding
cause of felicity to his landlady's daughter,
the young gentleman devoted himself with
great seriousness to his breakfast. As they
were leaving the room a~ few moment's after,
Gabriel whispered as he passed Elizabeth-

CHAPTER VII,
rjY~e few days following Christmas were fill-
ed u~ with various engagements, and cards
we~e issued for a grand ball at the Willows on
N~w Year's Eve. Robert had passed his
tweu~y-first birthday in Europe, and his corn-

and-the other 'quivering with emotion.
'Put the candles down, Nellie, and arrange
Miss Lydia's toilet.' Elizabeth said to the maid;
and as the door of the blue chamber closed,
she too bent her head and wept in sympathy.
The spring-shower woe e~r and Lydia raised
her dewy face.
'Lily,' she said, taking Elizabetlfs hand and
~ dressing it closely to her heart, 'I cannot stay.
o not let Annie ask me. I must go to main-
ma-to my own sweet, quiet borne. Oh, Lily,
my heart will break if I stay I'
She covered her face again,, nor looked up
for some moments. Evidently she was much
distressed.
'You know I love him,' she continued after
a while. 'You know I love Alfred with my
whole heart and soul-God keep mc from by-
ing him more I' she prayed, lifting her gentle
eyes to Heaven. 'Lily, I love him, and yet-
and yet I do not think I will ever marry him.'
'Do not say so, darling. 'Ji'i~ust in God, and
do not give way to such unfounded presenti-
rneiits.'
Not unfounded, Lily; I mean I cannot
marry him. I could not, oh, I could not mar-
ry a-gambler!'
Elizabeth started, and exclaimed:
'A gambler! Oh, Lydia, you must be mis-
'taken. Wh~ has told you this foul scandal?'
'He himself.' She spoke it calmly and de-
liberately. He told me laughingl~'-ah, littic
did h~ know how my heart bled for every gush
of merriment-how he had been among the
wildest set in College, and been drawn into all
their excesses. He saw I looked gravely and'
begged my pardon; but, Lily, the pardon w~is
not of me, as I told. him, but of God. This
happened on Monday. Tuesday he went with
his brother Gabriel to Grofton ; and since them
he has been so different, so abstracted and
cold; would you believe it, Lily, he spoke al-
most harshly?'
It WftS of no use to try and comfort her, or
to. persuade her that Alfred was ,young and
thoughtless. She wouhl eee no eicuss f~
wickedness; she had been taught to avoid 'aN
appearance of evil.' Nellie came back to U-

were so well dispersed through the ro6nis that
none appeared crowded; and the long piazzas

hung with colored lamps, almost hidden amidst
shrubbery, and casting a faint moonlight ra-

with promenaders.

some one tapped him on the shoulder. It was
the old intruder, his creditor'.
'Surprised to see me here to-night, eb, Mr.

nobody ever slights me; no sir,' he chuckled,
'old Jimmie Ellis cant be slighted.'
'You are forts~natc, sir,' Gabm~el said sarcas-

those inexpressible repulsive winks he Waa
gone.
For a few moment Gabriel stood still, stun-
ned by the words he had just heard. Wicked
as he was, he could not think of openly jilting
Miircia.
'She does love me,' he muttered bittel~,

It was about a month aften the ftital tragedy
that Mr. Rivers rode over to see his son as was
his practice daily, leaving Alfred at R.ivorlands
asthe sole occupant. Poor boy, he very sel-
dorn went into Gabriel's sick chamber except
wI~en the invalid was asleep or unconscious,
for there was such an evident dislike to his
presence evinced b~' his brother that both up-
pearod indeed miserable when he~wae present.
Mr. Rivers alighted from his horse, and stood
for a few moments looking around upon the
'winter landscape. Elizabeth descended the
steps to meet her guardian, and. as she gave
him her hand and mentioned Gabriel's Im-
provement during the day, ho stooped and
kis~med her with more than usual affection.
He turned ~.s they went up .the steps together,
and looked towards the little enclobure where
he willows leaned mournfully over two green
mounds.
* -          'Poor William and his wife!' he said, as if
*  *      m explanation. 'Marcia has fallen under the
curse.
Elizabeth lool~ed up Inquiringly.
'Insanity is an inheritance in the family of
the 'Burtons,' he said and then drew her in..
The invalid's room was darkened when Elis..
m~e5h and her guardian entered. Gabriel was
dozing, but he evidently recognized the foot
steps, and rai~ing his hand he took that of his
~ ~isin in his own.
'You are very good to me, Lily,' ho said
sit here beside rue, and you, papa. I feel bet-
ten- to-night.'
The musical voice was all that remained of
the former Gabriel Rivers. Elizabeth drew a
~tair near for the father and sitting down on
a lounge close beside the bed still retained the
wsated hand.
'I will never see again, ~4ly,' wei~e the~flrst
words that broke the silence as the young man
turned his sightless orbs toward her whom ho
addressed. 'I cannot see how horribly dlallg-
ured I am. WellI suppose it Is as well.
T)iere must be vory little left of handsome
4hbriel Rivers.'
He laughed as ~me spoke, a low, short langh,
which grated painfully on the ears of his list-
easre, audwenton In the same tone:
'I really never fancied Marcia loved me so
well. A hard case, truly, to be shot because

How strangely he taThed! Mr. llivers look-
ed at Elizabeth, but her face was turned away.
The old man leaned over, and smoothed tke
bright hair from his darling's disfigured brow,
while a shadow of pain passed over his face.
'Had you not better take a little of this
medicine, my son, and then try and sleep.
You are nervous.
'A little of what ~' he asked.
'This morphine. It will quid you.'
'Where is it?'
'Here in this vial.'

The father placed it in his hand.
'Very well. I will take ~'oiue directly.
Don't trouble yourself to replace it~ I will
put it here.'
He forced the cork in well, a-nd laid it iia-.
(leT his pillow. Mr. Rivers s~ruely' notbood
him, but gazed abstracte'lly into the fire. The
sick man talked on a little longer in the same
strange, unfeeling manner, tizid the poor fath-
er was greatly relieved when the physio~a'
was announced.
About ten o'uloek Mr. Rivers went up stairs
to the room prepared for him, as he usually is-
inained overnight. Gabriel had appuiared toe
some time dozing or in deep thought, so the
old man went out softly, only stepping up t
the bed before he lcft. to look once more
that idolized face. The door scarcely cloe~it
when Gabriel raised his heed as if to look
around, forgetful he would n~ver see again.

her impatiently.

Ho took her hand and held it a few me-

'Think lightly of my sins, Lily, or you may
reproach yourself.'
She left the room and crossed the hall.

Miss Berkeley, with her bonnet aird shawl on

'Are you going out?' Elizabeth asked.
'Mi-u. Ward is much worse, and we are go-

Ell~abeth promised, and as Miss Berkeley
left the apartment by suother door, reminded

the events of the last few hours, and though
satisfied the vision was but the effect of her

herself of the horror which had taken bold
upon her. Although far from affecting the

CHAPTER- Xli.
Sabbath morning dawned. It was one Gf
those calm, dewy days when Nature seems to
pray upon the distant hill-tops, and mist lint-
,ters around the brightness of her face as she
~turns from communion with the Father. Over
~th'e meadows, and through the green forest
'shades floated the silver chime of bells from
the neighboring village, and mingled with the
early hym~i of devotion from the amy height
of Wiudway.

expected. On the following &amp;Lbbath, Elim-
beth and Alfred were to be confirmed in St.
John's Chapel, the spire of which rose in sight
of Windway; and when he remembered the
cad event which had prevented his own com-
ing forward four months before, this opportrx~
nity seemed one providentially sent that Ii.
might not again be disappointed. Two days
were to elapse before, and these were epeot
I quietly in preparation. Alfred was gro'vh~g
I stronger, and saturday afternoon he walked a
littJe on the sunny terrace, supperte4 by ~lIu-
abeth. Nathalie brought him roses, and when.
e was wearied, ran for a garden chair that h
might sit beside the fountain, and ~watch tho
gold fish as they darted beneath the erys~I
waters. He 'was fair and delicate as a woman,,
and to the poet eyes of the young orp1a2~,

in many respects. Beef was cheap~
and the temptation to steal it was small4
Men did not often commit malicious
mischief or keep open tippling houses o~
forbidden days, because land was fbi
high, pco pie lived more widely apart~
and every one kept his own liquor at
home, gave to his neighbor and received
from his neighbor as much as they
wished; and, except upon Sundays,
when thcy went to church, all go~
drank as often as they pleased. Nor
did maids of thirteen very oflen mu off
