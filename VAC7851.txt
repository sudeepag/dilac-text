~It was ditring her visit to Paris in 1861 tbat Mrs. ~o~ithwott1i the an.
thoress of the following narrative&amp; became acqui~inted with the Celebrated
CORAL LADY; or a~ the: Parisia~ called her " ri~ BaoNZED BnAUXY."
It happened in a most slnguli~r and ~omanttc manner as the readerwill
perceive upon reading the aeco~mnt, Mrs. Soutbworth give&amp; h~ h~r own
felicitous style.
On the attern~rn pi~e~rhrns t~ the opening o1~the at~xpoi3itiobat~ Pa-
ris, Mrs. ~outhwo~th and two personal friends~ who had ac~ompanied ~ber
to Pt~nee from this eoui~try, were passing a p1e~ant hour in the Champs
Elysees. They we~e sitting on a bench facing the Avenue de Nenilly,
and watching thethrongs of splendid equipage~ that teamedd past inces-
santly with their gay and merry occupants.
Suddenly a comniothin took place, end ~e~reely had~onr friends begua
to conjecture its cause, when a carriage dMre past, which as well a~
its inmate, excited the astonishment end admfration of e~rery Bpect~r.
The horses were of a spler~did gloss~ black color, and s~ fierj a~ to re~
quire all the strength alid skill Of their driver~ t~ control tben.t. The
carriage, a light open affair, w~s painted and t~hnnied throaghniit of ~n
~d)OflV binek, hut was brilliantly relieved bv~ lines aud priekings of i~ed~ the~
design of ivhi~h Wa~ ~tt~inga of ~ed Ooi~al: Not only the:run~hig gear,

negr~ea, were in keeping with the restof the turnout, the braiding and
also the button~ being of fine scarlet silk in imitation of red Coral.
The great centre of attraction though, was the occupant of the carriage
a young lady of about twenty five years of age. Startlingly and var-
ishingly lovely, the stranger was at once the cynosure of all eyes. Yet
she seemed utterly indifferent, and took no notice whatever of anything
or any person. 11cr features were Grecian in their regularity, while her
complexion was of a peculiar bronzed hue, which being lit up by her
large, lustrous black eyes, added a fascination to her beauty that was
Irresi stable.
The dress of  ~a~4ulIr          ~        ini~i~~ with the style
of her whole t oughi~Ad ~IWkdd atitJvi4 did not remark
how modest and pretty it was. But we will let Mrs. Southworth de-
scribe it. She writes:
her head dress consisted of a simple piece of jet.black velvet, orna-
nente*rtAi       Dfi bri  6d~iJ6r~liTftk~~ ~Was~f the W~%ma-

force, and that was, ti{~t~w uilb~ &amp;W 1~e1 Itr h~4(uties made the most
prodigal and in many cases the most vulgar exposure of their shoulders
and arms, this lovely creature, though possessed of the most superb bust

Arabia. Arabia must be a lovely country I Nearly every land have I
traveled in save Arabia."
"You seem quite familiar, with languages, Miss De Launey ;" said I,
as in astonishment I heard her finish her remarks in English after having
used both French and'ItaliaiL "Lain eagei to kitew' what clime you are a
native of."
"An4 you shall l~uow; but not to 'day my dear Friend. What day' 4o
you use for visiting? Or do you not have any pav~icitlar d~ ~herefor ?"
"None especiallyset apart for visiting."
"Then will you come and see me to morrow at ~oon.~ 'Yen have my.

"I see that you, as well as others, look upon me as a mystery~.-~..my
bronzed face, my niode of' dressing-~-.exeite your most intense curiosity."
I acknowledged that'she w~s correct, and she resumed:
"You must come and see me tomorrow at noon as I have aeked you to
do and you shall have my history or: at least part of it."'
"It must be a strange one," remarked 1.
"You will say so more earnestly than new when 'you hear it. But I
have overstayed imy'time from home. Adieu, and IIeav~en's goodangol be

Th~zs speaking the lovely, mysterious girl-.for in appearance at least
she was such~-gave my band a warm~ squeeze, sprang lightly into her
carriage, which almost instantly whirled away down the Avenue, leaving
me wrapt up more completely than ever in wonder and amazement.
I rejoined the group of My'friends who instead of driving to their hotels
shad all dismounted again and were anxiously awaiting me, expecting
doubtless that' I would have some interminable and rich piece of gossipto
impart to them concerning the Coral Lady. Their anxiety, however, was
turned only int&amp; disappointment when I tol4 the extent and ~nature of
my interview, excepting the invitation to visit Eloise, Which I did not
mention for fear it might require me to deny the instant and importunate
applications, I knew weuld~have been thrust at me to;take a friend with ins.

Ta~ OQUAL LAJ~T.
Tfb3r aome;magical trar~sporting pewer~ I had been taken by the hand,
~3%t 1ift~d :froni the ~Qldj and nninviting~ scenery of a Northern land, and
placed in an instant after in the midst of some glowing luxuriant elinie~of
tha Oriental Tropics, r~iy p.stnuisbment could n6thave been half as great
~s when. Latepped thus fMn~ay, dashing, frivolous Paris, into this
apartment, wb~re ~Ml the Barbaric Splendors ofRastern Countries dazzled
my' eyes, and the t~nknown hut delicious perfumes~ distilled from sacred
gums and spices ma4e ~n~y senses gr'~w dim with their ;e~quisite odors,
and held 'me spellbound as tb~tigh a million of fairies had each quivering
nerve a captive.
Nor was mu~sie'*antit~g to complete theetberlaiscetie around me; for,
beside, the warblings 1f birds ingilded cagee~-whose notes were entirely
strange to my ears-4here eamefloating to me as though far away from'
some dream realm, dulcet strains of combined v~eal and instrumental
music. ,
"Is this magic ?'~ whispered I to myself almost trembling with the new
sensation my situation Inspired within me. I saw noono in the iru~
mense room. or rather ~aloon, which instead of being lighted in the usual
manner (for the r~de~ will r~x~ember it wasi noonday) was illu~m~nated
by eandel~bras, atregul~r interyalsalong thpwalls;and in which Candela~
bras burned candles of perfumed wax..
The walls were draped and hung with rich coral and black velvet and
silk 'hangings, while interspersed am9ng. the festoQus, with the iltm95t
elegance of. taste, were Qruaments of alabaster, ony4~, bronze; and richly
enameled paintings. Looking along the apartment II was bewildered with
the almost numberless varieties, and beauty of the furniture, though one
peculiarity struck ~r~e with mwch force which ~ that among all this
gorgeous furnishing there was ~ot a single cha~ visible. Divans and Qt~.
tonx~ns and pgshions and rugs all of such r~~gni~ent material ai~d luxu~
riotis apparanco a~ to almost defy comparison, much less imitation.
There were fll5Q i~anytables of strange and handsome material but of a
style such as i~ only used ii~ the i~ar East.
The screens of which I have spoken were at once the mosi splendid
e~ecimeus of art that I have ever' beheld~ Some were of silk, others of
satin and velvet; all embroidered in the superbest manner, and mounted
upon antique and odd~shaped frames, that moved in any direction at the
slightest touch.
Another peculiarity I noted was that the floor' instead of being carpeted
was covered with beautiful rugs in which the feet sank deeply at every
step.

THE SECOND INTEUYIEW.
It was late in the night before I could get to sleep on account 'of think.
ing overthe interview I had had with the strange Lady of Uie Coral; and
also of th~c coming one the next day~ My slumber also, though n6t ~lis..
turbed by, wae fihlc4 with, dreamed of Eloise. I did not loiter hi the owrn-
ing, bot was promptly at the door of Eloise by twelve o'clock. The
footman had nothing to say on this occasion; bu~ bowing low; at once
preceded ~me 'to the Salon of his Mistress 'wh6 r~eived iie' evOn iuiore;
pleasantly than yesterday. We had a general conversation for a shori~
time at~d ~h~n suddenly, the same 'as the day previous, Il~loi~e rosume~
her life narrative.
~ 'I broke off'yesterday,' said she, a~ the point whOre Lena followed
Herbert and Ann flivel. ' She had traced them to the St. 'Charhs 'Hotel,
and having inquired in the office ha~ found out the numb~re of their
rooms, which were the sarnc~ ones exactly' a~ r bad once o~upied. T~ius,
bitter and more bitter became the wormwood in the 'cop thae Ill Fortune
was holding~to ~iy lips. 12 felt that this indeed was the t~otm46ution at..
tending the dreadful error I had made hi ~btnitting~'to Eerbei't's desires
and theproniptiugs of my own love for him.
"'I will take my darling Child' said I to myself, 'go away' from here,
far away, whero ~he nor I will never ~ee nor' hear of her father; and
spend the f~ituro in redeeming the past4'
"The next day I went out for the ~urposc of engaging rooMs; but
apartments chancing lust then t~ be very scarce, I did bet su~ceedia'
procuring any, and by evening I 'retiirned~ home utterly worn out with
fatigue. Lena bad kept~faithfnily by Eloise during the wh~time I had
been out. On hearing of my, non~success, Lena sugge~t~d that a lac~y,
whom I knew, had been speakitxg of an acqnainta~nce of hers Who was do.
sirious of l~ttin~ a part of her house to a person of ~nqqesti9nable res~
pectability'. I was too tired to go myself, sO I sent Lena with a message
to the lafly in regard to the n~atter. *
"LittlO Eloise was hxceedingly glad to see me return h~ine, and she
and I spent several 'ho1Urs in play. It lightened my own sad heart to thus
make pleasure for ~y 'Child. Time passed away~ and it began to get late.
Still Le~adi~l not conic, and I commenced to feel' much anxiety about h~i.
Yet, thinking she must have been detained, I sat down~and rocked
Eloise to sleep. '

"When this terrible enthrallment was lifted from my senses, so like

M~ DEAR FRiEND, Mas. SouTriwoaTir:
When You and I parted from
from each other in Paris, I thought that I should not only never see yonr
kindly face again in this life; but also that mo.~t likely I should never
have the opportunity of writiu~ to you as I had promised, for I felt
nearly certain at that time that Fate had decreed me non-success in my
pursuit of Ann Rivel. But for once the Goddess relented, and one of the
results is that I am now penning this to you; and the other you will as~~
certain on reading what I send you
Affectionately Yours:
ELoIsE DE LAUNEY.
its you are already aware, when I conversed with you in Paris I had
lost all trace for some time of Ann Rivel, the vile creature who had ruined
my happiness for all time to come, Throughout the whole city of Parn~

went myself in disguise with the object of obtaining some clue that might

lead to the detection of the whereabouts of my intended victim. Yet, day
after day, and night after night, the same result was always reached, and
the same monotonous reports made-
"Nothing yet! nothing yet!"
One night about one o'clock I was awakened suddenly as by the pres-
once of some one close by my couch. I knew such a thing was impossi-
ble for I was surrounded by screens, and my servants would no more
think of intruding upon my privacy, without being summoned by me,
than they would of ascending to the moon; for they knew that I always
kept a loaded pistol 'ready for iusti~nt use.
For sometime I laid awake oppressed with that singular sensation of
some one being close to me and yet seeing no one, and finally so disagree-
able did this become, that I was obliged to get up. I walked about and
read and then played and sang, and thinking I had dissipated the sensa-
tion. I once more threw myself on my couch and soon fell asleep.
Again, however, I was once more aroused in the same mysterious
manner. And as I opened my eyes the dim shadow of Herbert Darnelle
flitted past me and was gone, as all shadows go. It did not look at me;
it did not speak to me; it merely passed by, and was no doubt an im-
presBion of the mind; for I hadjust previously to going asleep the second
time, been thinking about him.
Suddenly the thought suggested itself to me to go back to the hamlet
of Allan6 in Burgundy, and there I would hear of Ann Rivel. This
thought seemed to me to be in some way connected with that vague sha-
dow, that bodiless form of Hcrbert.Darnelle, which had come and gone as
the light cloud flies swiftly across the face of the sun. This I argued to
myself wa~ another of those impressions made by the mind on itself, and
whi~h, had I been more sensitive, I should have ascribed to supernatural
causes. Still, nevertheless, the impression remained; nay ; it grew
stronger and stronger. Finally, such a bold did it take on me that I re-
solved to go back to Allane. I argued to myself that, perhaps during the
second visit I might find, some means of learning something that I had
missed during the previous visit. No sooner did I come to this resolu-
tion than I was on my way to the romantic hamlet among the mountains
of Ilurgundy, Alland.
Instead of travelling this time as I had done before; namely, by rail-
road, I hired relays of light, swift coaches, each drawn by four splendid
horses. My orders were to place me in Allan6 as quickly as it could be
done; and if fifty horses were killed, I would pay for them.
The result was that I reached my destination almost as speedily as by
steam, and without the possibility of any person anticipating my arrival.
The host of the little inn, at Alland was tender struck at seeing me again;
for he had supposed T would never retu ~ I had not intended to stop at
his inn, but to go straight to the cottage which had been inhabited by

THE CORAL LADY,                  '     67
Ann Rivel. But as it turned out, I was obliged to pass the inn on my
road, and~ of course you, as a traveler, will understand the utter impossi-
bility of passing a country inn without being seen by the omni-present
landlord, and landlady, and all the rest about the establishment.
Out flew Monsieur Fallon, his wife, children and servants. I was
completely surrounded and so plied with congratulations and requests to..
come in and take full ~possession of the inn, that I was forced to surrender
at last.
"Madame," said Monsieur, as he escorted me to the best chamber his
domicile aWorded; "I have something to impart to you, privately."
I was at once eager to listen, and after closing the door Monsieur Fallon
began:
"Madame; do you not remember, last time you were here, that the
person you were in pursuit of, Ann IRivel, made her flight just before
you went to her cottage? "
"Yes I do, Monsieur Fallon, very distinctly. What news have you
of her? Any? Has she returned? Is she still there? Has she the little
girl with her yet ?"
These interrogatives I put to Monsieur Fallon with I suppose rather
bewildering rapidity; for, passing h~s band several times over his fore~
bead, he begged that I would let him answer one at a time.
"Tell me all; and do it quickly 1" was my rejoinder; at which the
fussey little host began:
"You had heen left Allan6 about a fortnight only; when, one morning
by a little after sunrise, we beheld Madame Rivel coming along the
"Had she the girl with her ?" I interrupted, laying my hand on Mon-
sieur Fallon's arm.
"No, Madame, she had not."
"Alas I" I cried, "poor little Eloise! She was the one ± really wanted!
I am her mother! But, proceed! proceed !,"
"Of course," resumed my host, "we were all much surprised to behold
Madame Rivel come back; an'il still more so when she announced to
us that she had returned to stay. Two days after that she went away
again, and again returned, this time bringing the little girl with her
"Oh, thank God! then both are still here I" exclaimed I, again inter-
rupting Monsieur Fallon.
"I do not think they are, Madame. In fact I know they are not. For
only yesterday Madame Rivel, after all her assurances that she intended
to remain here permanently, suddenly took her departure. The little
girl was with her, and she never stopped but went away as fast as she
"Did she say whither she was going ?" asked I.
"No, Madame; but, as I saw her leaving with so much precipitation,
it occurred to me that most likely you were approaching onr little village

in pursuit of her again. I had cause to remember you gratefully, and I
sent Jacques, my son, to follow Madame Rivel for two or three days, sup-
plying him with money for all his expenses."
"Oh! thanks.! thanks, my shrewd friend I" I exclaimed; "both your
son and yourself shall be amply remunerated I lie has not returned I
suppose?"
"Not .yet~ Madame~ Ht~ will ~~ be back for two days, unless eircum~
stances induce him to alter the plan I laid out for him. And I assure
you, Madarhe, Jacques iS no fool; iexd if Madame Rivel misleads him I
will givb h~r full credit."
I was obliged to remain at Ailan6 and await the return of Jacques
Fallon 'with what good or ill news he might have to bring me. That
day passed drearily enough, though all was bright and serene in the little
valley. In the same manner passed the succeeding day. And the third
one bade fair to be like the other tWo. You could not ~magifle my anxiety
and distress as I sat by my chamber window, watching the path by
which Jacques must come, as it wound its zigzaz way up the mountain's
side. My eyes ached with gazing, and the shadows cast by thesetting
sun began to be deep and sombre over the vale of Allani. Still Jacques
was unheard from. The sombre shadows became blended and deepened
into one dark mantle, wrapping hi~mlet, mountain and forest in night;
and my aching eyes suffused with tears. There was a hope and a fear
connected with Jacques thus overstaying the allotted time. The hope
was, that, having got fairly on the track of Ann Rivel, and it continuing
with promise of near success, he had kept on. The fear was, that, find-
ing herself thus watched, the shrewd, wicked woman had drawn the
lad into some bye way and perhaps silenced him forever, as she had once
before silenced one far dearer to me than life-~-poor Herbert Darnelle.
I mentioned my suspicions to Monsieur Fallon; but, with a shrug of
the shoulders, and a meaning twinkle of his grey eyes, he said:
"Ab I Madame does Jacques injustice! Jacques will give a good ac-
count of himself.! and I think his delay bodes good fortune !-Ha! ha!
there is his horn now! The Marseilaise! ha! ha! Madame! I told Jac-
ques to give us the Marsellaise as he crossed the mountain's crest, if he
had good success. Good news, Madame! Jacques is no fool! Hark don't
you hear it ?-there! now comes in the chorus !"
The window was open; but I heard nothing. Mine were unexperien-
ced care. I looked up where I knew the path must wind, and I saw through
the night a spark of fire that moved like a star swinging back and forth~
Monsieur Fallon looked also, and exclaimed in his ecstasy:
"Hurrah! Madame-! that's Jacques, ~Winging his lantern! That's a
signal I told him to make in case the wind carried the sound of his horn
away from our direction I"

At this moment the sweet and powerful notes of Jacques' French horn
came down to my ears on the evcnihg wind. The Marsellaise I Great
heaven I never had I heard that tumultuously- thrilling melody under
such exciting circumstances. My whole being trembled with excitement,
I conid hardly control myself. I strained my head as far as possible out
of the window with eye and ear intent. And once, I remember, shaking
Monsieur Fallon to induce him to remain quiet about the merits of
Jacques.
Nearer and nearer caine. that swinging lantern of Jacques, and clearer
and clearer became the notes of his well played horn, till finally the stal-
wart lad, covered with dust, stood before me in my chamber; while his
father capered and pranced around him like one out of his senses.
In a plain, straightforward manner, and with a peasant's simplicity,
Jacques narrated to myself and his father his adventures since the chase
on which his father had sent him, commenced, He had traced Ann Ri-
vel from town to town, until reaching. Besangon, he had ascertained that
she intended, after remaining there a short time, to go to Berne, in Swit-
zerland, where she had several years previous purchased a cottage. lie
had evidently displayed much acuteness in his pursuit, nor did he quit it
until he thought it safe to do so. The information he brought me was
most valuable; and I not only thanked him; but gave him' such a reward~
as made him stare with surprise. Nor did I forget his father who had
so shrewdly sent his son Jacques on the pursuit, on the supposition that
I would appear in Allan~ immediately after Ann Rivol left it.
AGAIN IN PURSUIT.
The next morning by sun-rise I was far up the mountain side, making
my way to I3esancon with all possible speed, and praying with all possi-
ble fervor that Ann Rivelmight not resume her journey until she and I
had met face to face. I had not travelled far before an accident happen.
ed which came near ending my life. I was riding a mule that .1 had
hired with a guide to take me across the mountains. We had come to a
dangerous path on the mountain side, and a heavy rain having fallen,
made it extremely slippery. The animal I rode had lever performed
the journey before, and consequently was not to be depended on. This
I was in ignorance of, until we were approaching the dangerous place to
which I have just referred; when my guide cautioned me to look out for
any slipping or faltering of the animal, and instructed me what to do in the
occurrence of such an event. At any other time I should have promptly
turned back; but no~ now. No! not if Satan himself had stood in my

~p~thway would Ii have taken one retrograde step~ On we kept, and sure
enough,, when the animal I rode got to the dangerous portion of the route
he began to lose confidence in himself, exactly as a human being
might de.
The further the brute advanced the more frightened did he become, and
about the middle' of a path that led through a dismal gorge, he lost his
footing and slid down a steep declivity nearly a hundred and fifty feet.
Here he caught on a ridge or narrow ledge, about six inches in width,
which arrested his, progress down the rest of the incline at least five
hundred feet more.
Jean, the guide, stopped his mule; and uncoiling a long, strong cord-
that guides carry f9r just su~ch acciclents-he was preparing to throw it to
me, when suddenly, from some unexplained cause, the brute I rode be-
gan to rear and plunge. On a level plain this would have been sufficiently
dangerous t~ the rider; but midway down a mountain side, scarcely any~
thing but a ~miracle co"ild 4save any one. I thought of a desperate re-
source; and, drawing my poignard, I was in the very act of killing the
beast. The point of the steel was"aimed directly at the spinal cord, and
another nuloment would have brought the mule down dead.
At this juncture, however, his hoot broke away a portion of the ridge,
and, as he struggled to save himself, he pitched me~ off his back, and
sent me whirling down the declivity like a shot. Death stared me in the
face; but I did not lose my presence of mind. I clutched the poignard,
and each time I rolled over,' I tried to drive it into the ground. Twenty
times at least did I make t1~e effort before I succeeded. But finally I did
succeed, and my headlong descent was stopped.
I glanced upward, and there beheld the mule, where he had stood;
while at the top of~the declivity I saw Jean, doing nothing more sensible
than crossing himself and making other motions of despair. In fact it
seemed to me as though he could not see me for some moments in spite
ok~ ~ repeated screams to attract his attention.
i The mule 'was still plunging and slipping, and, as I was in a' direct
1 e. l~~lo~ him, ~ began to tremble lest he should come rolling down
upon me and crush me to death. To avoid this peril I crept carefully
in an oblique direction to a place of safety; and again shouted to the
guide.
By this time that worthy had somewhat regained his composure, and
at once began to ~escend towards where. I was. This was a matter of
the greatest risk, even for such an experience rnountaineeras Jean. But
finally after great exertion and one or two ugly slips, he got the cord to
me. Then commenced the great struggle to reach the path from which I
had originally been thrown. The very thought of~that frightful ascent
makes me tremble.
.A.t last, through the favor of Providence, and with many a narrow es~

cape, Jean succeeded in assisting me to a ufirm' footing once more on the
path. So great was his fear at having been The cause ,of the accident,
that he went down on his .knees, begged my pardon, and prayed me
that I would not ruin him by saying anything' about the reason of the ac-
ciden~, pleading his wife, children, and aged parents, who were depend-
ent on his profits as a guide for their living. Though very angry at the
fellow, I forgave him, and the journey was at once resumed, Jean walk-
ing, and I riding on his mule, a throughly-safe and sure-footed animal,
who, Jean averred, would carry me safe along a path though it be no
wider than the back of a sword. Before starting again I insisted onJean
shooting the unfortunate mule that still stood far down the side of the
mountain, as it would be impossible to save it, and cruel 4n the extreme
to let it stand there till it starved. Beside~, the poor brute, when it found
us going, looked up, and uttered such a groaning sound of agony that it
was extremely touching to~ hear. * ' -
The rest of thejourney was accomplished without any event occurring
that was worthy of being recorded and I arrive~1 in Besaiicon full of hope
and fear-hope that I might overtake the woman who had caused me such
*trouble and unhappiness, and fear that, as she had done previously, so
now she might escape me. I felt rather meanly of myself; alsoto think
that she could escape from me always, and with so much apparent ease.
ARRIVAL IN BESANCON.
As I entered the lovely town of Besancon I met a peasant and his wife
going to their work. I stopped them, and after some casual inquiries I
asked: ' '
"Can you tell me, whether any strange men have come into Besaneon
within the last two weeks ?" /
"Yes, Madame," replied the woman, "there have been three com6 in
that time. 'Two of them were workingmen looking for employment and
the other was a gentleman who called himself a Nature man I think; and
he was hunting up flowers and weeds and birds and bugs. The queerest
thing I ever heard of."
"You mean, he called himself a Naturalist 1"
"Oh, yes, Madame, that. was it."
"I suppose there were no women with either of the three men," said I
coming as'gradually as possible to the point I wished to settle, 'and yet
speaking in a half-indifferent tone of voice.
"No, Madame, there were not. Them kindof men I dont 'think would
care much about lugging women about with them."

v-bed the tr~me state of the case. I once read a story of a miner who was
at work in a copper mine that extended under a lake. An immense mass
of earth fell behind him and buried him in a. living tomb from which no
friendly hand could rescue him. After some hours he became almoatmad
with thirst, and knowing that but a-thin crust of earth was between him
and the water of the lake-above, he desperately seized his pick ate, and
began to bring down huge lumps of ore and earth in the double hope of
slaking his thirst, and rising to the surface of waves and swimming ashore.
Presently the w5ter began to trickle through; but scarcely had the
poor man thanked Providence for this,~ before the angry deluge burst
through with horrible noise and vio1ence~ and dashed him iat~ a mangled
coi~pse.
I felt much like that man for~the discovery had burst in upon nie from
that poor peasant woman's mouth like the deluge which had destroyed
him. .1 was completely nonplussed; but suddenly I thought: "Why
not make a frisud of this woman? ~he will serve me for gold if not for
any other re~son." With this resolution I again adiireesed her:
"Yea, I am that little girl's mother. That woman stole her from me
and I am in pursuit of her. Perhaps you are a mother yourself. If
you will help me to accomplish my oh~ect I will give you gold. Do -you
see it? I will give you m6re than you ever had in all your life."
"Madame," said the woman, "'if it was only the gold, though Pierre
and myself are wretchedly poor, I wbuld tell you no. Iliit as it would be
in a good cause I will serve you any way I can, and s~ will Pierre here if
you will pay us as much wages a day as we can now make at our work.??
"~Iow much is that ?" I asked.'~
"]?orvy Sons, Madame."     -       (about ~6 cents Editor.)
"Forty Sons!" exclaimed I, in astonishment at such a meagre sum,
"yes 1 will giv, you each five francs a day."
"Ahi Heaven bless you, Lady 1" ejaculated Pierre the husband, "why
that will enable us to give both our so~i and dai~gbter a handsome start
in life."
"Serve me well and faithfidly," replied I, and your son and daughter
shall both have an outtit such as no peasant in the region ever had be~
fore.
The woman burst into tears ofjoy at this, and Pierre could not restrain
himself from embracing his wifb on the spot. Till that moment I never
knew how happy one could be by making others happy. Upon further
conversing, I learned that the woman, Christine, bad been born and
raised within a few miles of l3erne, and had many friends and relatives
there.
I now4~elt a sudden impression come on me that this time I would he

EUNTEP DOWN AT LAST.
I now felt renewed vigor in the chase, and proceeded tolay my plans ~rs
a ~genei'a1 might do who appreciated the difficulty of the coming battle,
and yet was sure of victory. To avoid as much aspossible any excite-
ment ~that my arrival might make, I went directly' to the cottage, or
rather hut, of my peasant friends, where I found the son and daughter
one tWe~it~' and the dther' seventeen. Bright, intelligent and handsome,
their humble parents might well be proud of them; and When they were
to1~ my intentioha toward them their hap~nes~ was indeed a happy sight
to see. FatheL', mother' and 'both children at once commenced the search
for me, :and within ~ few hours' learned that the ~tran~e"lady with the
little girl had remained'oiily one day in the town and had then departed
for Berno in Switzerland.
Thie was what I had really expected to hear; and I was therefore pre-
pared with my plan. I ~ent the Sach~s, father, mother, son and daugh-
ter, instantly to Berne with. instrLlQ.tions to ascertain the exact locality in
which. Ann Rivei had settled, and then to keep a strict watch on her
movements until I arrived. The reason I did this was that each time be-
fore that I had gone directly to a place where she was, she had ascer-
tained my approach by some means or other., But I had now found as-
sistants on whom I felt I could depend, and so I remained in Besancon
three days after their departure, in order to give them time to obtain the
information desir~d. 'It~vras exceedingly trying to my patience thus to
'wait, but I controlled n~yself, and did not' start for Berne until the day
and hour hadi fixed upon. Then, however, I travelled at the utm6st speed
that l~oimld, and arrived in Berne in good season.
My~ f~lerids were iinpati~ntly awaiting my coming.
"Well, ~2lhristine,". said I as I alighted from the conveyance at the
spot, an4 met the faithful peasant woman, "what news have you? good
or bad?"
"We.have found out the woman, Madame, or at least where she lived.
But sh~ is very skk. They say she is dying."
"And the little girl ?" I inquired.
"She is in the house with her."
"It is; welL Take me to the house at once," rejoined I, a terrible de-
termination coming oyer me.
"The cottage is not, in the city, Madame, but in a sequestered spot
about two miles and a half to the Northward of it. The road also is very

TUE  CORAL LADt            /           1(5
difficult. Do not think me too bold, Madame, but I would advise yen
to leave it till tomorrow morning as it is now so close on to night."
Upon thinking over this friendly advice, I resolved to follow it; not
failing to remember that it was most likely myheadlong baste that had
so often before given Ann Rivel a warning of my approach.
That night was a long and anxious one to me, and sleep was a strang-
er to my eyes during its dreary passage. By day break the next morn-
ing, I was on the road with Pierre and Christine to the house where my
enemy lay sick-.where they said she was dying-where, for the first
time since the night that Eloise was torn from my enclasping arms in
New Orleans, I would set my eyes on the darling a~ain.
XVa found the road fully as difficult, if i~ot more so than Christine had
described it, and we were severaihours in coming to the cottage of Ann
ILivel. It, was hidden down in a romantic little deli, and so buried in
sweotilowering vines and graceful trees that I should certainly have
j~c'I by without sceingit, had not Pierre said:
~Thc're i~ady, there is the place right down there oil' the road."
Ietdwd' stid saw the smoke curling peacefully out above the chimney,
~u ~ ;iwh was the effect upon me, that I was obliged to sit down on a
n'.. s roveEt'41 rock near by to regain my composure. This did not ceiP
st~iet~' netwh time, however, and ordering my two peasant friends to re-
nanin where they were, and await my return, or else my signal, I des-
eendt~d to the cottage, and knocked at the door. The summous was not
answered, and so I boldly walked in.
"Now then for her I" I whispered to myself, drawing my poignard.-
the one that had been stolen from me~that had been driven into the
heart of poor Herbert Darnelle-..and the one that I now intended to plant
in the heart of her, who I felt fully assured had been his foul murderess.
I had taken but a few steps, however, when I was confronted by a rough
~ll-visaged old woman, who demanded to know what I wanted;' an
I had entered without waiting to be admitted.
"Silence, hag I" I exclaimed, pushing her back, "I wish to see your
mistress, Ann Rivel. Where is she? She shall not escape me this
time I"
A scream, as of'some one in rage or agony, rung upon my ears at this
moment. It came from a room on the right, between which and rue
stood the old woman. Seizing~ the latter~ I hurled her from before me,
and, at a few steps, stood in the presence of my enemy, Ann Ri~el. It
was her chamber, and, merciful Heaven I there she lay on her couch dy-
ing! I had hitherto disbelieved the report of her dying, us a story, set
afloat by herself for some dark purpose of her own. But I could not
doubt that haggard face, those checks, hollow, and white as marble;
those eyes, brilliantly glassy, and the sweat of near dissolution standing on
her~forehead in beads. r


THE CORAL LADY.
"You have come at last! and disguised I" exclaimed Ann Rivel, glar-
ing at me like &amp; tigress, and endeavoring to rise to a sitting posture, but
sinking back on one elbow.
- Yes," replied I~ ~'I am here at last, nor do I intend to leave until you
have made me reparation Ia some way for what -you have done. I de-
termined you should not become aware of my pursuit this time until I
~teod before you as I do now !"
"Ha I ha!" laughed the expiring woman, "I knew it last night, and
had 1 noV been dying tbe~, 1~ would have slipped you again. But there
is no need 9fthat pow, the tragedy is about to end, and in a way that
your little dreamt will. Before I die-provided you do not stab me, as
I suppose you intended, with that polgnard.-~.which I recognize as the one
I once plunged into the heart qf H~rb~rt Darnelle-.-I wish to say a few
words to you."
- The-frightful sangfroid of the wretch almost stunned me, and lower
ing the~ point of my poignard, I simply replied:
"Go on."
"I will be brief," said Ann Rivel; "for my life is now numbered by mm-
ute~. 'When I lived in New Orleans, ytf~r father, in conjunction with
Herbert Darnelle, ruined my father in business by refusing a certain fa-
~ror the latter asked for. The result was, that from affluence, my mother
and I were reduced almost to beggary. She broke her heart and died
soon after. I lived, and resolved to revenge myself on Herbert Darnelle
and you. You th~e~n loved each other fervently. The men of today are
not Josepbs, and I easily seduced Herbert.-~do you understand? I se-
duced hhu and bec~nw his bauble-his mistress-in order that I might
zuake him my victim. How well I succeeded you know.

"I knew your vengeful disposition, and knew that when you escaped
you would pursue me. So, like the Matador, I fled; always keeping close

excited, and yet far enough from you to pi'event you fulfilling your
threats. How long I might bavecontinued this I do not know. But I
Was suddenly stricken with the disease that has brought me to this bed
of death. I immediately resolved to come to this cottage, and here await
your arrival. I expected you before this, and even began to fear that you
would not come in time.
"You have come hither for revenge and to recover your child; while I
have brought you here for revenge and to-Oh! I die! pull - that bell

The face of the dying woman was horr~b1y contorted. She gasped and

struggled; and, almost unconsciously, I sprang close to her bed side and
jerked the bell cord violently. A loud~ whirring sound followed, as
though by the act I had started some kind of machinery.
"Ha! ha!" exclaimed Ann Itivel, in a weak, choking voice; "it ~s as I
wished. Below this chamber is a vault, is which there are a hundred
pounds of gunpowder. With your own hand you have started the clock-
work, which, in about twenty seconds more, will explode the magazine.

Ann Rivel fell back dead, without finishing her sentences and~ with
the calmness of despair, I stood immoveable, awaiting the dreadful death~
Bhe had so surely and diabolically prepared~ for me and my darling.
The whirring sound ceased, however, -and was followed by no explos-
ion, and my. frigid despair instantly gave way to mere active ideas. I
rushed swiftly from the chamber, and found the ~old hag of a servant reck-
lug herself over the kitchen fire,
"Woman 1" I cried wildly, seizing her and holding a revolver at her
head. "Show me down into the vault where the child is! Quick! or I
will shoot you."
"Aye! that I will I" said she. "that woman must not know it though.
But she cnn't move out of bed. Come, an~l you will bless me! Comet"
She hobbled on before me with surprising speed for one so old, and,
opening a trap door, went down some heavy oaken steps. I followed her
closely, and shuddered as I felt the cold, damp, musty air come up out
-of the opening. But this feeling was nothing~ compared to that which
thrilled me as-I heard a child's voice groaYiing. My heart almost stood
still! that was the voice of my sweet dating Eloise. Long, long ago
bad it been since I last heard it.
"Eloise! Eloise! my child! my dai'ling! Where are you? I ani yoi.tr
mother! I am here to save you !" I cried. -
At this moment the light that the old Woman carried was blown out
by a strong current of air, and all was utter darkness. -At this moment. -
too, I felt a, little body pressed against my own, and two little arms flung
around me, and a little voice, weak and tr&amp;nxbiing, saying'. ~'Mama! Oh!
Mama!" -
Oh, Heaven! could I, with this pen, trace on this parer my emotions
at that instant, your very soul would thrill to read it, my dear friend.
When, long before, Eloise had been torn from my embrace by the masked
ruffians in New Orleans, she h'ad wailed forth -the self-same words that
she now said: "Mama! Oh, llama 1" Then it had been in infantile des-
pair;, now it was in childish gladness.
I sank on my knees, and covered the dear, unseen face with kisses;
and thanked Heaven, oh, how fervently; and almost crushed the darling
in my happy embraces. By this time the old woman had relit her lamp,
and bringing 11t close, enabled one to see the lineaments of little Eloise,
the intended victim of that wicked woman, Ann Rivel.
"Come! come, my sweetest ~ I exclaimed, catching Eloise np in my
arms, let us be going.
"Stop!" said the old woman, I told, you you would ble~s me. Come
here and look."
I followed her to the spot in the vault where ~tood a barrel, open at the
top, and a wire coming down through the floor overhead and passing
down i'ito the barrel. She stopped and thrusting her hand into the bar-

"You see that,' said she, "I was employed by that sick woman np~.
stairs. She imparted her plan to mc. She brought this powder here in
parcels herself, saying that a woman would come some day to take the
girl away, and she intended to blow the house, the girl, woman, and
herself to atoms, This wire passes up to her hand. For a week past
she has forced me to take the girl down here each day, and lock her up.
I was to escape when you came, on Madame Rivel giving the signal of
a cough and a scream. But, while obeying her order to lock the girl in
the va~ult, I could not find it in my heart to aid in her murder, so I
quietly poured water amongst the powder, and rendered it useless. But
you will say nothing to Madame Rivel, will you ?"
"She is dead! the fiend I" said I.
"Thank God, then I" rejoined the old woman. "She has gone to her
re~kuning; and it will be a heavy one, I'm thinking."
My dear Friend, I need not prolong my narrative. I do not feel able to

I also' did the' old woman, to whom 1 owed not only my own life, but
that, of my cbihj, Eloise, The authorities of Berne took charge of the
body and effects of the wicked creature, Ann Rivel, and with a gladden-
ed heart, I left Jierne to take passage for the Island of Sumatra. I leave
here day after tomorrow, and there in that lovely elime, reunited to my
darling Eloise, I shall spend the rest of my days in peace and happiness.
I shall still wear my corals to remind me always of the past; but I shall
no longer practice with the pistol, as I have burned the waxen figure of
Ann Rivel. Eloise is delighted to go with me. and as I write this, she
has her arms round my neck, and is saying: "Dear Mama tell the lady in

The publisher desires to say, that while the foregoing narrative is not
from the pen of Mrs. E.. D. B. N. Southworth, the gifted authoress of so
many w~l known works of fiction, its thrilling, heart..touching passages
will be found equally affecting a~ any ever written by that lady.
Among all the sensations that were ever made in Paris the subject of

if only fQr c~riosity~s sake. But she repelled all alike; in fact living like

course she at once hecane the subject of the wildest and most improbable
stories; but the foregoing pages contain her true history from first to last
mind it is undoubtedly one of the most romantic and thrilling that has ever
