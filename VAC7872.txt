TO   OF WASHINGTON CITY,  THS BOOK IS DEDICATED, AS A TESTIMONIAL OF RESPECT AND AFFECTION,  BY HIS STEP-DAUGHTER,  THE AUTHOR.   PREFACE.   THE following story is founded on facts that occurred in my grandmother's native county. In childhood, I often heard the tale, with mingled emotions of pity, indignation, and wonder; ,pondering long upon the external circumstances, without comprehending the inner life, the motive power of the story. Nor until lately have I been able to render a reason for the insanities it developed; one of the most striking and incomprehensible of which, was the insignificance of the apparent cause which aroused such malignant passion, and spread such wide misery. Instead of exaggerating, I have softened characters and events; and pre- cisely those points at which my reader may feel inclined to exclaim, "Monstrous! incredible!" will be the most modified in the relation. It is PRIDE, in its monstrous excess and terrible consequences, that I wish to illustrate in this Tale of Domestic Life.   'WASHNGTON CITY, February 12th, 1861.   CONTENTS. ,   BOOK I;   CHAPTER I.

She shall dwell in some bright little isle of her own, By a blue crystal river encircled alone, Where the'dewy leaf waves in the fresh blooming bowers, And the bee banquets on through the parterres of flowers. Jgoore. I AMx about to attempt the description of one of the most sublime and beautiful landscapes in Virginia. The river   , taking its rise in the Alleghany mountains, flowsthrough the valley of Virginia, and, passing through a defile of the Blue Ridge mountains, falls, roaring and rebounding, from a rocky precipice, and boils howling on, over and between the jagged and pointed rocks sticking up or piled up in its channel. It is a wild, furious, and terrifying scene, inspiring delirium in the nervous be- holder-the thundering falls, the mad river foaming between its stupendous banks, and the waters hissing and leaping from their rocky bed' like frenzied thoughts from the brain of an enchained maniac. A quarter of a mile below this terrific scene the river declines, and, falling over a second ledge, spreads itself out and opens its arms to encircle a most beautiful island, a very gem of the river. This island, sparkling and glancing in sunshine and water, from the peculiar aspect of its dewy and resplendent beauty, was called, in the poetic language of the Indians, "The Isle of Sunbeams," and "The Isle of Smiles and Tears?" But the first Anglo-Saxon "invader"   of the territory called it "The Isle of Rays." The banks of the river on each side were steep and rocky, and the isle itself arose high from the waters, its base a solid rock covered with a deep, rich ,soil, and crowned with a luxuriant growth of vegetation. Through the middle of this isle, dividing but not separating it, ran a clear, beautiful creek. This creek was higher than the level of the river. It took its rise in a spring spouting from the rock on the western and higher end of the isle, and flowing, singing through it, ran on to meet the rising sun, and ,tumbled laughing over the eastern rock in the open arms of the river.  At the time that our story opens, a-bridge, light and elegant as the handle of i ladys work-basket, arched above this creek. Al- though the high cliffs of the isle were on a level with the steep rocks that formed the banks of the river, no bridge had been thrown across, uniting it to the main land. Stone steps were cut in the rocky sides of the isle, at the foot of which a boat was moored. Stone steps were also cut in the steep banks of the river, for the convenience of communication. The northern division of this isle of beauty had been left in all the wild loveliness of na- ture. The southern division had been cleared up, and laid out in groves, lawns, terraces, gardens, and conservatories. Upon the highest point of this southern division of the isle, stood an elegant mansion, built of white freestone, and surrounded by piazzas, both above and be- low, and running all around the house. Below these came a terrace covered with green turf,   and diversified by shade-trees and by parterres of beautiful flowers. ', From this, marble steps descended to the lawn. This lawn was trav- ersed by serpentine walks, which, winding over the turf between borders of bright flowers or rows of pine-trees, by the side of a singing brooklet, beneath the shadow of an old oak or elm, around the margin of a clear pond, over the swell of a green hill, or under the shadow of a gray rock, would terminate at some rustic seat, someitasteful arbor, sequestered grove, or dewy dell,'with its half-shaded spring, that "now in laughter, now in tears," sprung from the rock, sparkling in the sunlight glimmering through the overhanging leaves; or at the stone steps, at the foot of which lay the little boats; or at the wildly beautiful falls where the glad creek leaped shouting into the river. When the light of the morning sun flashed on "the waters of the creek, the falls, and the river, by the contrast of the dark rocks and shadowy. woods, the bright waters glanced back to heaven scintillating streams of dazzling light, that gave to the island its appropriate name of "The Isle of Rays." The picturesque island contained in itself about two hundred acres. The estate attached to it-"The Island Estate" -comprised several thousand acres, extending over the north side, and up and down the river. This was the great property of the county, and from  the first owner of the soil at the first settlement of the country had descended, undi- vided, from the father to the eldest son. The Stuart-Gordons had been settled on The Island Estate for a hundred and fifty years before Margaret, then the sole heiress of the property, was born. CHAPTER    II. THE HAUGHTY     FAMLY. Your ancient house? No more. I cannot see The wondrous merits of apedigree; Of royal lineage, or a proud display Of smoky ancestors in wax and clay, Gifford. WE   have come to it at last, reader. The 1 Stuart-Gordons were, not one of the first, but positively and incontrovertibly the first family i in Virginia-if first in princely descent, first in t wealth, first in .the settlement of the country, -a and first, in pride',and pretension, constitute a,  "first family in Virginia." '    I  :  I The Stuart-Gordons claimed descentf- with T   s what truth I know not, from the Royal House s of Scotland. For several reasons, I am certain- - ly inclined to the opinion that their claim was not an unfounded one; though most probably 3 the Royal quartering of their family escutcheon was crossed by the bar-sinister. One of my own private reasons for believing that the blood of the Stuarts still frets in the veins of the Gordons is this: in all their old family por- traits, and in the face of every 'living member of the house of Stuart-Gordon, may be traced, the serious brooding eye-the beautiful mouth -with that singular blending of strength and weakness-of fire and indolence-of self-will and indecision--of intellect and sensuality- that melancholy, half-spiritual, half-voluptuous, expression of countenance, which distinguished the ill-starred family from the time that their strong Scottish blood was diluted in the marriage of James V. with Mary of Lorraine, and still further reduced in the union of their daughter Mary Stuart with the imbecile Hen- ry, Lord Darnley.  Reader, did it ever occur to you to trace the downfall of that Royal House to the degeneracy of its stock from these two unfortunate marriages? If this were the place, or I had the time, I could al- most prove it. But to proceed with my story. Margaret Stuart-Gordon was a great toast in her time, as you may well suppose. In her face, too, were seen the large tender eyes and' sweet arched lips of Mary Stuart and Mary of Lorraine.  In her twenty-first year she was given in marriage to Captain Henry Cart- wright, a young officer who had distinguished himself in the Revolutionary struggle. On the  day of marriage, as the sole condition upon which the hand of an heiress of the house could ever be betrothed, he assumed the name -of Stuart-Gordon. One only child, a delicate fair- haired boy, blessed this. union. To this son, of course, the property would fall in regular entail When Louis Stuart-Gordon was nearly eigh- teen years of age, he lost his beautiful and be- loved mother, and became the sole and the suf- ficient consolation of his bereaved and. grieving father; and it is at this period that our story opens. Louis at about the..age of eighteen, was one of the-no, not ..handsome as a man- but one of the most beautiful youths ever seen -the image of his lovely mother; the same- wavy, soft hair; the same large, tender eyes; the same Tweet mouth,- delicate complexion, and mild expression;  His figure was slender; his air, gait,'and-gesture, graceful; and his- manners, gentle..; His temperament was poetic., This beautiful isle was his home-his heaven;   here he would wander all day among the shadowy woods or hoary rocks, or sail upon the bright waters. Yet, such was the tenderness of his heart, that, in all his strolling and sail- ing, he never caught a fish, killed a, rabbit, or shot a bird--nay, more-he never wantonly trod upon a worm or crushed a flower beneath his feet. Between. this young poet and his mother had existed the most perfect sympathy; and at her death. the being of the boy seemed severed in twain. He mourned her as sincerely as ever son mourned a mother; For a time he had suppressed his own sorrow, and devoted himself to his father; but when, after the lapse of a few weeks, he found the old gentleman recovering his cheerfulness, and even occasion- ally breaking out into his old mirth and jollity, he withdrew himself, indulging his mood of reverie in the groves and among the rocks of his beloved isle. Sometimes, overcome by the vivid recollection of his dear sister-like mother, he would give way to tears, and, leaning his head upon his hands, let them flow freely. In such moods his father would often find him; and, without intentional unkindness, and with a mistaken notion of arousing him, would ex- claim, "Degenerate drivellerl you, have no manhood. I blush for you, Louis. Idler 1" At another time: "Up with you l'and go a courting! At your age I was in love with half the girls in the country, and had all of them in love with me. Up, Louis! Up!" CHAPTER III. MONT Oa   YSTAL. Crowning a gradual hill the mansion swells In ancient English grandeur; turrets, spires, And windows climbing high from base to roof, In wide and radiant. rows, bespeak its birth. W. Mason. WREN one visits a country neighborhood for the first time, with an intention of remaining a few weeks,- looking from the. windows of the house the first morning, after breakfast, one sees-there the square front of some splendid edifice rising in the distance-here the sliarp roof of some humble cottage sticking up through a near thicket of trees-and indulges in ,indo- lent speculation or eager curiosity as to, who lives in the palace or who toils in ,the cottage, . Or, if ..one .takes a walk; up the- turnpike, or a.  ramble through the forest, one. looks continually :i   on this side and on that, for new developments of scenery and events, with an -almost childish love of adventure, and almost infantile curiosi- ty. This propensity is an evergreen of the heart, and does not wither or fade with ad- vancing years. So, condescending reader, if you have come, at my invitation, to visit the, Isle of Rays, it will only be' a due courtesy to point out to you the most important seats of the neighborhood, preparatory to introducing you to some of the most remarkable neighbors. And first in point of wealth and family is Mont Crystal, the residence of Mrs. Dr. Armstrong. You will please to observe the elegant edifice of white granite, half embosomed in trees, "crowning" the summit of a hill on the bank of the river, visible from the front windows of the Island Lodge. This "palace" had for gen- erations past been the residence of the Arm- strongs of Mont Crystal, as their estate was called. This immense estate comprised many thousand acres, and was second in importance only to the celebrated Island Estate, whose southern boundaries it met. Please, dear read- er, note these facts, for I am telling you a true story, some points of which I wish to fix upon your memory with almost legal precision and. distinctness. The Island Estate was the great? property of the whole Valley of Virginia. 'The Mont Crystal was the very next in point of  importance. Their boundary lines met-the Island Estate lying on the Island, and north of it-the Mont Crystal property south from the banks of the river, that formed the division line. The sole heir of the Island Estate was Louis- Stuart-Gordon, an only son, born on the 22d of February, 18-. The sole heiress of the Mont.- Crystal Estate was Louise Hector Armstrong,. the only daughter of the late Dr. Hector Arm- strong and Hortense Louise Blackistone, his. wife, and born also- on the 22d of February, two years later. Louis Stuart-Gordon heired his estate in right of his mother-Louise Hec- tor Armstrong in right of her father. The  family on the Isle consisted of a father and son , -the family at Mont Crystal of a mother and . daughter, with the governess of the latter. ,Sprung from one of the haughtiest families in Virginia, and claiming descent from one of the most ancient and noblest houses in the north of England, Hortense Louise Blackistone had ' in very haughtiness remained unmarried until . she had nearly reached her thirtieth year, her ' proud, cold heart untouched, while her splendid style of beauty had drawn around her crowds of admirers. Her hand reserved for the highest and haughtiest aspirant, was at last bestowed - f   upon Dr. Hector Armstrong, a young practi- tioner of medicine, for years a suitor to the "proud ladye," but who might have sued in vain, had not the death of his elder brother left him sole heir to the great Mont Crystal prop- erty, and so Miss Blackistone became Mrs. Armstrong, and Dr. Armstrong bore his bride away to the "palace," as it was called in the neighborhood. This was about two years from the time that Margaret Stuart-Gordon was given in marriage to Captain Henry Cartwright, after- wards General Stuart-Gordon. Never was a greater misnomer than that of Dr. Hector Arm- strong-for he never was known to "hqector" over any body or thing, nor was he strong any- where, in mind or body. He was a small, slight, fair-skinned, red-headed, blue-eyed man- ikin, whom people, when they wished to praise him, called "nice," "amiable," "harmless," "mild," ' inoffensive," and other such qffensive epithets. Soon after his coming into his prop- erty and his marriage, which happened about the same time, his change of fortune and of life, and his indolence of habits, led him to abandon his profession, and from that time he began to sink into privacy, into insignificance, into nonenity, while Mrs. Hector Armstrong, whose name was no misnomer, flourished " like a green bay-tree"--just as you have seen a weak plant shrivel, and shrink, and wilt down by the side of one of stronger, hardier growth, until it is dead. Thus Dr. Hector Armstrong's individuality and dignity were absorbed. The very house was called-not Dr. Armstrong's-but Mrs. Dr. Armstrong's. This was not intentional on the part of the lady. She was too really proud not to wish to throw over her imbecile " lord and master" the prestige of power and dignity -but some how or other the purple would not hang naturally or gracefully about the shoulders of the little gentleman, and so it fell out quite inevitably that the neighborhood, as well as the household, looked up, as the head of the family, to Mrs. Hector Armstrong. It was in the second year of their marriage that their only child, a daughter, was born, and named, as is frequently the custom in Virginia, after  both parents, Louise Hector. This child almost ] -entirely resembled her father-scarcely a single ' trait of her mother's face, form, or character,  could be traced in her. When Louise was about 1 four years of age, Dr. Hector Armstrong died, 1 leaving the haughty lady in the undisputed ] possession of their estate and their daughter. a Can you conceive, reader, a mother's love for a her only child-being a passion deep, intense, I   - absorbing, yet selfish, jealous, and exacting I e This was the affection, if it deserved the name, i that Hortense Armstrong cherished for her daughter. She had been jealous of the child's affection for her own father, jealous of her at-  tachment to her mulatto nurse, though the state the lady habitually kept continually left the gentle little child in charge of her attend- ants. But after the death of her father, and after the entrance of Louise upon her fifth year, the mother took her more particularly' under her own charge--conducting her edu- cation herself; the whole bent of this educa- tion was to one object-the entire subjugation of the will of Louise to that of herself, to gain a life-long ascendency over the heart and mind of the child, and thereby the disposal of her destiny. Not only did she require from her daughter the implicit obedience claimed by and ceded to parents by every law, human and divine, but she aspired to bring down the in- tellect and affections, the very mind and spirit of her child into absolute subjection to her will. Not a " reasonable," but an unquestion- ing submission she demanded. She would have wielded Louise at her will, as she would wield her own hand or foot. Much as she loved Louise, after her own haughty and con- descending manner, it is not to be denied that she appeared to regard her child-her own child, as she called her-somewhat in the light of a chattel. Was she not her own child? She was very proud of her. Was not she heiress to Mont Crystal, a valuable appendage? In verity she was extremely proud of her young daughter, as she was of her palace home, her splendid equipages, and her troop of menials. I said her education was directed all to this point-the subjection of her will to that-of her mother-and, further, the utter annihilation of her mental and moral individuality and respon- sibility. Filial love, veneration, and obedience, inculcated upon her mind as the highest reli- gion-"Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land that the Lord thy God hath given thee." "The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pink it out, and the young eagles shall eat it." These and similar texts of Scripture were copied out and given to Louise to be com- mitted to memory. This was the creed im- pressed upon the docile mind of the infant. Had its object been a righteous one, this, as far as it went, would have been very commend- able; nothing is certainly more reasonable and proper than the exaction of this obedience from   children to the parents God has placed as Providences over them; and nothing is more beautiful than the graceful yielding of this af- fectionate and reverential submission. But in this case the object was not righteous, and reason and religion were perverted and in; verted, and texts of Scripture garbled, to attain an ascendency over the child's mind, for any purpose of good or evil that might seem good in the eyes of the not over-scrupulous mother. By nature and temperament, Louise was gentle and impressible. What wonder, 'that, in her mother's hands, she should have seemed like clay in the hands of the potter- that she should have become moulded exactly' to her will. Nor is it any wonder that, while fearing her awful mother so much, Louise should have loved her with a devotion amount- ing to superstitious idolatry; for it iA ever thus, that most austere and severe parents have the most gentle and affectionate children, even as harshest, sternest husbands have the most tender and submissive wives; as if some gentle natures were created for the ameliora- tion of the harsher, and formed so as to draw from their self-devotion their largest happi- ness. When Louise Armstrong was about twelve years of age, a governess was engaged to finish her education-that is, to instruct her in the modern languages, music, drawing, embroid- ery, &c., Mrs. Armstrong haughtily objecting to the "mixed" society of boarding-schools on the one hand, and feeling a great disinclination to lose the company, or cede over the control of her daughter on the other. Governesses were not so plenty twenty years ago as at present, or she would never have been driven to the necessity of employing a "wild Irish girl" to cultivate the mind, and perfect the manners of her only child, the beauty and the heiress. The governess, Miss O'Riley, as the haughty lady of Mont Crystal addressed her -Britannia O'Riley, as she wrote herself-- Brighty, as, for her bright beauty and brilliant wit and humor, her intimate friends christened her, was a Washington girl of Hibernian parent- age; she was about twenty-five years of age at the time our story opens, of medium height, moderately full figure, black eyes and hair, and dark complexion, features irregular, fore- head broad and full, eyebrows slender and black, arched towards the nose, and elevated towards the temples, bright, piercing eyes, nez retrousse, and lips full, crimson, and quivering, formed the tout ensemble of a countenance irre- sistibly charming in its sparkling piquancy.   Such was the parlor circle of the family of Mont Crystal. Let me introduce you. CHAPTER IV. THE DRAWINHGROOM AT MONT CRYSTAL. I know the spot; The curtain'd windows half exclude the light, Yet eager still to make their way, A thousand elfin sunbeams bright, Glittering about the carpet play, But what attracts you chiefly there Is one who in a cushion'd rocking-chair, Doth sit and read. Mrs.. . X. Wells. DEAR reader, your story-tellers, some of them, have an inveterate propensity to de- scribe comfortable firesides, scenes of which they have occasionally caught a glimpse. It is perhaps an effort of the soul to escape the chill realities of lodgings in rented houses, by taking refuge in the homes of memory, or of imagination. One can abnost 4"Cloy the hungry edge of appetite, By bare imagination of a feast!" It is the decline of a cold, bright winter's day. Follow me into a vast, luxurious draw- ing-room, in which the crimson shadows pre- dominate-through which a glowing crimson gloom prevails, brightly streaked by the rays of the setting sun glancing through the cur- tains in -slanting streams of golden light, kindling into refulgence the various ornaments of crystal or gilding, about the room,"and striking sparks of fire from a diamond rin; upon the most beautiful white hand you ever saw-a hand that held a little Psyche pocket-mirror, and that belonged to a lady, the rest of whose person was hidden in the deep recesses of the. velvet chair. Walk around in front of her chair, and take a view of her-she will not see you, even if you were not invisible, as all subjects of imagina- tion are in the scenes they visit, so absorbed is she in her occupation. And what is her occupation in that still, warm, bright scene? Contemplating her own beauty-gazing dream- ingly, lovingly, into her own languishing eyes. There is no expression of gratified vanity on that bright countenance--there was the emo- tion, half intellectual, half sensual, of the artist soul in love with its own beautiful incarnation. Yes, Britannia O'Riley felt that she was   very beautiful, and it made her happy. When at night she thanked God for "health, friends, and raiment," she thanked him also with an earnest sincerity for the gift of beauty. It was a luxury in a quiet room, at the still twilight hour, to sit in the deep chair, and smile dreamingly in her own eyes-yet she was not vain. Vanity is a compound of two elements, self-conceit and desire of praise. Now, Britannia O'Riley had a just self- appreciation, and that excluded all anxious thought of the admiration of others, at least of those around her. But Britannia knew that her .person was beautiful, and half worshipped it accordingly. You will condemn her for it I Well, so be it! I am not holding Britannia up for a model of excellence, I am describing her as she was. You will condemn, but you will not wonder at her. Observe her as she sits in that deep chair--note her Galwaygian style of features and   complexion-that matchless Hibernia- Spanish beauty, indigenous nowhere but to the west coast of Ireland. The full carnation lips-the ,cheeks of bright carnation, shading softly off into the faintest rose tint, and lost in the snowy temples and forehead, in contrast with the slender, arched jet-black eyebrows-- the radiant blue-black eyes, the shining bands %of blue-black hair. Britannia must have been, infatuated with the piquante beauty of this tint, for her favorite dress was a rich blue- black figured satin, fitting in exquisite perfec- tion herr finely-developed form, relieved here and there by costly and sparkling gems. Her whole costume was rich and rare, and her bearing gently, proud-and she was nothing I but a poor governess. Of course, she expended c nearly all.. of her moderate salary in dress. e What did she do that for? you may inquire.  Did she hope to get a husband, among the 1 young Virginian aristocrats I No, indeed I In 1 haughty England, it is true that once in a long E time a gentleman may fall in love with and I marry   some  beautiful governess, but in 1 Virginia, such  a republican proceeding- is ( unheard of-impossible I  I do not know that a it ever occurs to a young Virginia planter a that a governess is a woman, or any thing else e but a teaching instrument in the morning; a f parlor ornament in the evening. A  parlor S ornament--I am  sorry to say-by the way- b that in the  South governesses are valued o more for dress, style, manner, and   other t drawing-room accomplishments, than for sound 1 and solid qualities of brain or heart. As a ti general thing, Virginians are rather proud of -p   1 stylish governesses, as elegant appendages to 3, their household. It is a preference quite i opposite to the English preference, that for- t fear of mgsalliance selects old and plain I teachers. The haughtier Virginians never I dream of such a chance as one of their race k wishing to marry a salaried girl. 'Britannia knew and felt this, and refined, intellectual, and accomplished, as she was; cared as little for it as you care for the pride of a South Sea prince. While we have been talking, the slanting rays of the setting sun, after having glided half around the walls, have gradually withdrawn themselves. And twilight has deepened into night. And the light that glows through the crimson drawing-room comes now from    the solid mass of burning coal within the large glittering steel grate, though to a poet's fancy Britannia is brilliantly beautiful enough to light up a dark room. No wonder her young friends called her "Brighty." Brighty could no longer make love to her own beautiful face, because it was no longer an object of beauty- the red glare striking up from the grate revers- ing all its shadows, and the order of nature at the same time, which is to have the light fall down, threw the charming features into chaos. So Britannia, released from the toil and care of the day, and losing the pleasure of dallying with her own eyes, sank into the sweet repose invited by the quiet luxury of the twilight room, every nerve and sense at rest, and her free thoughts lazily roving whither they would. If no love had brightened the path of Britan- nia's life, no sorrow had clouded it, no care had roughened it. Left an orphan in the charge of a countryman of her father's at an early age, with barely sufficient money to edu- cate her for. a teacher, Britannia O'Riley had been sent to a boarding-school, which she had left to take her present place in Mrs. Arm. strong's house, a situation that she had held for nearly three years, with some toil, some vexa- tion, but much fun. Britannia had not a "bit of a brogue," yet she was Irish enough to assume it in its richest, deepest music, at- an instant's impulse-and she was malicious enough to punish the pride of her patroness by falling into it upon great state occasions. There her malice stopped-she loved ease, beauty, and pleasant thoughts too well to rec- ollect any thing disagreeable after the day of tyranny was over; and this was, her hour of luxury and dreaming. As I said, she had nei- ther griefs nor joys to remember, or any very probable good or bad fortune to anticipate, so   her thoughts strayed into the regions of ideali- ty. She had not lived long enough, suffered deeply enough, or she was not intellectual and refined enough, to sufficiently appreciate and enjoy music and poetry. She had an artist soul, and loved beauty, even her own beauty; but it was the painter artist, not the music artist-hers, poetry of form, and not the poe- try of sound and measure--the harmony of coloring, not the lights and shades of music. And this artist instinct involuntarily directed every thing she did, her dress, attitude, and every gesture and motion.  One of poor Brighty's daily vexations was the appearance of Mrs Armstrong's huge chased silver tea- urn, with its ugly shape, its disproportionate mouth and spigot. It was this love of the beautiful in form and color that led Brighty into the extravagances of a' recherche toilet, and that sent her into the crimson lights and shadows of the drawing- room, as it always looked in the evening, to dream over her romances, She was fain to enliven the tedium of her life and fill theva- cuity of her thoughts with novel reading, which was quite a passion with her, but, to do Britan- nia justice, nothing silly or commonplace in that line was acceptable to her. Sir Walter Scott's novels and metrical romances were just in course of publication, and Brighty, like ten thousand of others, would finish one and wait for another with a whetted appetite. Shak- speare was her god-poet, though she could not rise with him to his highest conceptions. She reproduced with her pencil and brush all her favorite Shaksperean and Waverley heroes, heroines, and landscapes; and her chamber was hung around with her specimens of art. Hel- ena in Shakspeare, Jeannie Deans in Scott, were favorites, and flot Beatrice or Die Vernon, as you would at first thought suppose Brighty would prefer. She loved and admired deeper- toned characters than her own. This was perhaps natural-,we are most likely attracted by our opposites, and value most in others those good or great points of character in which we are deficient. Do not despise Brighty because she was not blind to her own beauty. I am afraid you will; yet, as I am telling a true story, I am determined, for once, to draw characters ex- actly as they are, without softening or height- ening a defect or grace. I hasten to tell you one good trait of Britannia O'Riley. One pleasure she enjoyed more than that of ad- miring herself, more than reading romances, or reproducing with her pencil their scenes, more   than pulling the ears of. Mrs. Armstrong's pride even-and that was to supply Susan Somer- ville with plenty of good reading, and to sym- pathize heartily with her enjoyment of it. Perhaps had there been an opportunity, her benevolence would have taken a more legiti- mate and utilitarian tone. But there was not. The country was too new, too rich, and too sparsely settled, to have many poor or suffer- ing candidates for charity. We have taken up too much time with Brighty, but in that fault we have plenty of company. Few came into her presence, or sat down by her side, without losing more time than they at first intended. Brighty's hour of twilight musing in the deep chair by the coal-fire was short. A servant in livery entered, and, by lighting the lamps, brought out all the flashing, dazzling splendor of the rather gaudily magnificent drawing- room, and thereby destroyed its charm for a poet-artist like Brighty. The room was only beautiful to her in twilight, or in subdued glowing firelight gloom. As soon as the ser- vant had retired at one door, the other was thrown open, and Mrs. Armstrong sailed ma- jestically in, accompanied by her daughter. Mrs. Armstrong was about forty-five years of age. She was a woman of majestic presence- very tall, very full formed-with the erect car- riage, stately step, and assured manner that expressed conscious power, indomitable will, and accustomed sway. Her features were strongly marked--her forehead square and broad; her nose a high aquiline; her chin and cheeks full and round; her lips firmly set; her complexion opaque white; her eyes were dark gray--bright, cold, and hard; her eyebrows were square, heavy, and black; her hair was glossy, jet-black, and braided in large, heavy braids down her round, full, elastic cheeks, and plaited in a thick plait, wound around the back of her head, and confined by a' comb. She usually wore a black satin dress, and, as was customary at that day, a light and elegant turban. The whole expression of her counte- naace, tone, and manner, was high and noble, but it was the nobility of pride, not of good- ness. The daughter was a beautiful girl of fifteen summers, with a small and delicate figure, fair hair, fair skin, and blue eyes, and that look of timidity and deprecation that some oppressed children wear. Miss O'Riley arose, and curtesying, left the ample chair to the lady, who, with a slight ac- knowledgment, slowly sunk into it, motioning her daughter to take the footstool at her feet.   Miss O'Riley, (we must be formal in the pres- ence of the proud lady,) Miss O'Riley found a seat on a sofa near at hand.

Mrs. Browning. "ARE you   advised, Miss O'Riley, of the manner in which your pupil was engaged at this hour last evening "' There was a deliberate arrogance in the manner of the lofty lady, that called the quick, Irish blood of Britannia to her brow. For an answer she turned her eyes on Louise, who, sitting at her mothlF's feet, looked pale and nervous. "I am   very sorry, Brighty-" commenced: Louise, with tears in her eyes. "Attend to me, if you please, Miss O'Riley; and, my daughter I be silent when your mo- ther is speaking, and when you speak, address i your governess as I do, remembering that we i only call our equals by their given names.  Now, MistO'Riley, if your convenience serves, 1 I shall be obliged by your favoring me with a I reply to my question. Are you, or rather, were E you at the time advised of the manner in which ] your pupil was engaged at, this hour last evening "                  t "Haven't the slightest idee," said Brighty, p with an affected brogue, and a delightful non- ( chalance.' Then quickly blaming herself for impertinence to a lady many years her senior, s she immediately changed her tone, and replied, 1 "No, madam, I am   not. At the close of her s evening lessons; I conducted her to your cham- c ber door, saw her enter, and did not encounter her again until we met at ten. I hope that in the interval she fell into no error."    k "Into a 'very grave error, Miss O'Riley; into an idle conversation with young Stuart- 0   9- Gordon, in the grove below the front court- a yard. I fortunately saw her from an upper window, and dispatched her maid to recall her to her duty, and to my side," replied the lady, looking with cold displeasure upon the gov- erness. "I presumed that Louise had not left your side, madam." "You presumed that Louise had not left my side 1 I should feel favored if you would be sure that Miss Armstrong is always in a posi- tion becoming my daughter," spoke the lady haughtily; then graciously, "That is all I have to say, Miss O'Riley'l you will oblige me by bearing my expressed wishes in mind; and now, if you please, we will change the subject of conversation." "But that is not all I have to say, Mrs. Armstrong, and if I might venture to differ with you, madam; and offer my own views on the subject, I should say that ' tiss Armstrong ' is followed, watched, guided, and guarded, in short, like the world, 'governed too much.' I think--and believe me, that it is with the most earnest desire of Miss Armstrong's wel- 'fare -" "My daughter," interrupted the, lady, turn- ing blandly to Louise, "withdraw  from the room; go into my chamber, you will find a fire already lighted there, and stay until I recall you." Louise arose, and lifting her mother's hand reverently to her lips, courtesied, and left the room. "Proceed, Miss O'Riley, with what you were saying; and'remember that in future you will infinitely oblige me by not honoring me with advice in the presence of Miss Armstrong. Proceed; any suggestion you may have to make relative to your pupil's welfare, shall be heard. I myself fancy that Miss Armstrong grows thin; that, hiowever, may be adolescence. Nevertheless, I cannot forget that her father died of consumption, nor can I close my eyes to the fact that she inherits his delicacy of or- ganization. I am waiting your reply, Miss O'Riley."' "To be frank with you, then, Mrs. Arm- strong, I  think that Louise-I beg pardon- Miss Armstrong does grow thin. I think that she is worried with too mtch care--too much culture-and that it is killing her." "I do not understand you, Miss O'Riley." "Madam, you have seen a   pet killed with kindness, before now; have you not t" "You are still more incomprehensible, Miss O'Riley."   "Mrs. Armstrong, have you never, in your childhood, handled, petted, and nursed a plump young kitten, until it grew thin and scrawny- have you never nursed one to death, in short? -I have." "You grow enigmatical, Miss O'Riley; I consult you upon the subject of your pupil's health, and you talk to me of kittens; pray, explain yourself," said the lady, haughtily. "I will," said Brighty, rising and settling the folds of her blue-black satin; your daugh- ter is attended to-worried--hurried too much -she wants rest-repose-Mrs. Armstrong; she wants a heart and mind at ease; she wants more freedom; she is afraid to stir hand or foot; to speak-to think-to feel-lest she should give her mother pain or displeasure." "That is her religion,"' said the lady, coolly: "Miss Armstrong, I am happy to say, is, an ex- ample of filial piety. I repeat it, that is her religion." "It is her superstition." "You will please to remember you are ad- dressing me, Miss O'Riley." "And it is in full consciousness of that, that I say, Mrs. Armstrong, that your system of education degrades, debases, enslaves, yes, de- stroys your daughter!-and that if it be con- tinued, in two years from this Louise will be an irreclaimable idiot." "You are speaking of Miss Armstrong," said the lady, white with anger, but speaking steadily. "I know it; and I repeat, that unless a different course is taken, in two years Miss Armstrong, of Mont Crystal, will be an idiot slave!" Brighty's eyes were blazing. A long pause ensued. It was broken by the measured tones of Mrs. Armstrong, say- ing- "I am surprised that Miss O'Riley leaves me the pain of suggesting to her the propriety of retiring from my presence; I should have supposed that after her polite speech she would at least have had the good taste to anticipate me by doing so." Brighty arose and stood before her pa- tron- "Mrs. Armstrong, if I were really mali- cious, as well as high-spirited, I should obey you, and leave the room; yes, I should go beyond orders, and leave the house; but such is not the case; my Irish blood takes fire very quickly, but it is a blaze of shavings; when I am struck, I strike back immediately, and then forgive my antagonist; I would not forgive on 2   any other terms; when people are arrogant to me, I am capable of being insulting to them; and yet, Mrs. Armstrong, I would not be so to you; I respect your years more than your rank or-" She was about -to inadvertently add "your character," but she bit her tongue in time. All this time Mrs. Armstrong had sat up erect, cold, and silent; neither deigning to speak or look at the bright earnest girl standing before her. Britannia continued- "If I spoke strongly, Mrs. Armstrong, it was because I felt strongly; because I wished to rouse your attention to a subject of which I have before spoken, with more moderation and less effect; because I think that if many parents fall into the error of over laxity, a few make the opposite mistake of too great strin- gency; because you make me think that ladies of your age may sometines forget the days, and consequently the wants of their own youth, and so be unable to enter into and understand the necessities of their children; I am nearer the age of Louise, and have a clearer recollection of what one's little ne- cessities are at fifteen." "Proceed, Miss O'Riley." "I should say that Miss Armstrong requires exercise, amusement, excitement. Young girls of her age have usually high spirits. She is congealing into apathy-into death, perhaps;. to rouse her, she requires that the frozen, springs of her life-blood be thawed; let her- mingle freely with those of her own age and sex, at least, that she may feel her youth--a little." "And how is that to be effected, if I 'may inquire, Miss O'Riley? Our neighborhood i not so thickly settled with young' people- least of all with such as I should introduce to Miss Armstrong." "Still there are some." "Who, pray, Miss O'Riley l" "There is Susan Somerville." "A young lady with whom I would never permit Miss Armstrong to become intimate." "May I ask why?" /"Her mother's will is a sufficient reply, Miss O'Riley. I am not called upon to sit in judgment upon Miss Somerville, nor am I addicted to gratuitous censoriousness." "Then there is. Gertrude Lion." "The 'Gerfalcon,' as she is called, partly from her name, partly from her nature; no, she has earned a sobriquet that at once excludes her from Miss Armstrong's acquaint- ance."   A pause followed, broken, as before, by the lady of the house. "Have you any thing further to suggest, Miss O'Riley?" 'Britannia smiled, as she murmured- "There is Zoe." Here the lady quickly interrupted her with- "Not to be thought of for a moment I By no means." "Then I am at the last of my invention, I believe-sty! yes-there is a dancing-school about to be established at' Prince of Wales.' Why not send Louise there; it will be an amusement for her; they will have practising quadrilles twice a week; I will attend her there?" "No doubt of'it," dryly remarked the lady, "but Miss Armstrong's mother has no idea of mixing her up with these dances, and having her hand sullied by the contact of she knows not whom." "Then pack her up in a nice rosewood coffin, lined with white satin, and entomb her at once," thought Brighty, but she said nothing. The supper-bell now rang, and Mrs. Arm- strong dispatching a servant to summon her daughter, led the way to the supper-room. Louise entered the supper-room, pale and tearful, and going up softly to her mother's side, she whispered low- "Dearest mother, pray tell me again that you forgive me; I cannot rest, I cannot be satisfied, I do not feel as if you had quite forgiven me." "Do not whisper in company, my daughter;  and, beyond all, do not doubt your mother's ' word.  She has told you that she had forgiven ( your indiscretion, great as it was; let that : suffice; now be seated," said the lady, coldly. I Tortured by that strange, yet not impossible 1 incident, the simultaneous attraction and re- a pulsion that only the very strong can exercise, i only the very sensitive feel, namely, the attrac-  tion of flesh and blood-the repulsion of word a and manner-broken between her wish to throw 1 herself upon her mother's bosom and the fear of giving  displeasure, Louise "stifling the t mighty hunger of the heart," sank coldly, de- i jectedly, into her seat. Strange .as it may 1 seem, this coldness in repelling and repressing f did but deepen, intensify, and concentrate her is filial love; for Louise idolized her handsome, d Imajestic mother, in her regal, matron beauty. IShe craved her embrace the more ardently, that M -she seemed ever on the verge, yet never re- ceived it.  She went to sleep, to dream  of I   9 caressing freely the beautiful mother, whose jewelled fingers she mighly barely raise to her lips. Louise was sickening of a starved heart. A little more coldness, a little more frost, and her affections would have been killed. Mrs. Armstrong knew exactly how far to go, when to stop. Never did scheming woman manceuvre to retain her lover's affections with more art than did this lady to confirm her influence over her only child. Every emotion, and with some natures every affection, is wasted in proportion to its manifestation. Mrs. Armstrong under- stood this perfectly, and accordingly gently repelled her child. "My daughter," was pro- nounced in the softest key, with the most gentle inflection of voice, and with a look of tender- ness, exciting a wish for the embrace that was never yielded-a want that gnawed deeper for being repressed. Women instinctively under- stand this principle, and women of the world practise it; and up to a certain degree-a degree to be calculated by the temperament of the subject--they repulse the advances of the man whose affections they wish ultimately to secure. It is strange that a mother should have acted so to her only child; something new under the sun-incomprehensible-incredible, if, in this case, it were not known to be a fact. Upon this evening, however, Mrs. Armstrong watched her daughter with some anxiety; observed that, besides her paleness, thinness, tearfulness, and trembling, she scarcely tasted food, and the lady resolved to take some im- mediate measures for the restoration of her health and cheerfulness. These very measures conspired to form the crisis of her child's destiny. The circumstance which had given so much offence to the haughty mistress of Mont Crystal and drawn upon the head of Miss O'Riley such a severe rebuke was simply this, one day Louis had crossed the river in the little boat, and, ascending the stone steps that led up the bank, wandered down a deep forest path, into a shady dell. Sitting down under the trees, he fell into a reverie that was broken by a clear, soft, lute- like voice, saying, near him, "Oh! Louis, I meet you at last. I wanted to come to you so much, dear Louis, to tell you how I suffer with you-how I sorrow for you; but my mother says that it is no longer proper for us to visit you at the Isle, now that there is nobody to receive us. But you know, Louis, do you not, that I wept to come to you?" "Yes, dear Louise, I knew, if permitted, you would have come." "You know it," said she. "Well, Louis, now I only stopped to say that, and bid you good-   by; for mother would not like my stopping here to talk, and I must not do what mother does not think right, you know." "How, Louise, would you leave me so soon, long as it has been since I have had the happi- ness of seeing you?" inquired the youth, taking her hand and looking deprecatingly into her face. She drew her hand half out gently, while an expression of perplexity and distress trav- ersed her countenance. "Sit down upon this bank, and let us have a chat, Louise?" "Oh, nol no " exclaimed the maiden, now quite withdrawing her hand; "mother says it, is not right, mother says it is not proper-" "What is not right? What is not proper, Louise? Your sitting on a bank and talking Nwith me? Was that it?" "Oh! no, no I I do not mean that mother said that, but she would say it if she knew it." "Dear Louise!-tme-your old school-fel- low!" "No, not you particularly, Louis, but any one. Mother says--" Here an expression of displeasure, almost amounting to aversion, crossed the countenance of 'the young man, and arrested the speech of the maiden. Presently she said- "Do not be displeased with me, Louis; it is so distressing to me, dear Louis." "' Displeased with you, Louise?" "Well, with my mother, then; for it is equally painful to me, Louis. But now, in- deed, I must hasten away. Good evening, Louis. Oh I you can come over to see- mother soon, can you not?" "Perhaps so; but do not leave me yetl!" pleaded the youth, still holding her recovered hand. "Oh! Louis, would you get me a scolding?" exclaimed the trembling child, while a spasm of petulance contracted her delicately beauti-' ful face. "Certainly not, Louise," replied the young man, gravely dropping her hand. "Miss Armstrong, your mother wants you," said a voice through the trees; and the maiden, starting, trembling, and growing pale, exclaim- ed- "I am missed; mother has sent Kate after me; good-by, dear Louis," pressed his hand hastily, and disappeared in the trees, just as a tall mulatto woman emerged from them to meet her. With a very sedate brow, Louis Stuart- Gordon retraced his steps to the water's edge,   descended the stone stairs, got into the boat, and rowed back to The Isle. Louis sauntered abstractedly towards the house, and entered it, passing in at the central door under the piazza, and, opening another door on his left, admitted himself into the family sitting-room. CHAPTER VL THE OLD WAINSCOTED HALL, A dreamy aspect doth the parlor wear, Pictures and busts and books, not flowers, But a warm hearth where one may doze for hours, Nor note the minutes in their lazy flight, Nor ever think to count them as they go. Mrs. A.. . Wells. IT was a room some twenty feet square, with two very tall'windows looking out upon the piazza, aid commanding- a view of the sloping terrace and ornamented grounds in front, of the dividing river and the opposite shore, with a 'stately white villa crowning the hill, (but of that more anon.) Now turn away from the window, and look within. The dark and highly varnished oak-panelled walls gave that substantial and finished appearance-that inexpressible air of tightness, snugness, warmth, and comfort, that nothing else can so well con- fer upon a room. These wainscoted walls were ornamented by numerous fine, large engravings in massive gilt frames. The fireplace stood, as I said, in the corner. It had a very tall, straight mantelpiece, surmounted by two'small marble images-Justice and Mercy. Justice held her scales down in one hand, and held a socket for a wax candle in the other. Mercy held the olive branch inverted in one hand, and a similar socket to that under the charge of Justice in the other. Between Justice and Mercy hung the only oil painting and the only family portrait in the room-presenting the sweet face of Margaret Stuart-Gordonr Two tall grenadier-like andirons, polished to a sil- very brightness, supported the green hickory wood of which the very warm fires were made. The rug displayed a pattern of white lilies on a dark-green ground. This rug was soft as wool, as General Stuart-Gordon's pet cat knew. A short, deep, murrey-colored sofa was usually drawn up upon one side of this hearth, and a large study-chair on the other. General Stuart-Gordon still sat upon the old studying 7 chair, but very sadly looked the vacant sofa, ',-,i   now that the gentle woman that had occupied it so long was missing away from it. Murrey- colored curtains hung at the windows. Lastly, two doors gave exit from this snuggery-one on the right into the central passage-way; one on the left into the vast saloon:,of the house, furnished in the most splendid style, but never opened except upon grand occasions. On the other side of the wide central passage were the more strictly housekeeping offices, still rooms, &c., but of these we do not need to speak now. Louis Stuart-Gordon entered the oak parlor, and found his father sitting dozing in his study- chair before the fire; the cat was dozing, too, as she purred and hummed on the rug; and the green hickory wood was singing a tune as it burned. A pleasant, dreamy twilight gloom pervaded the room. Justice and Mercy were not yet lighted up, and the sweet face of Mar- garet Stuart-Gordon was lost in the shadows. Louis threw himself upon his mother's va- cant sofa, and seemed to feel that he was nearer to her. His gesture waked his father up; who, yawning, said- "I Ring for lights and tea, Louis, do ;though it is very lonesome-Oh-o-o"-(yawning) " very I --drinking tea, you and I by ourselves-tire- some; I wish, Louis, you would get married H there, ring, do 1- One can eat and sleep, if no more!" Louis pulled the bell-rope, and a servant replied to it; and, throwing open the door, announced "Miss Susan Somerville;" and a young lady, followed by a matronly attendant, entered the room. Both father and son arose, General Stuart-Gordon advances with the stately courtesy of a Virginia gentleman of. the old school, and, bowing gravely, led the young lady to the sofa, while Louis, after wheeling it closer to the fire, stood until Ale was seated. The countenance of the Gen- r eral plainly, though courteously, asked the question, "To what happy circumstance are f we indebted for Miss Somerville's visit?" as X he resumed his seat in the study-chair, while a 1 servant lighted the wax candles in the charge ] of Mercy and Justice. It was beautiful to ob- 1 serve the contrast afforded by this girl's sweet 1 calm, simple air, to the ceremonious manners i of the old General Taking her time in draw- 1 ing off her gloves and removing her bonnet t without an invitation to do so, she called her c attendant, and, placing them in her charge, 1 said sweetly, in her clear, pleasant voice- t "I have come over only to make tea for you s and Louis, General, because grandfather has (   3 gone to Alexandria, and I am not wanted at home. Grandfather will stay a week at Alex- , andria, and I can come over and make tea for e you every evening, if you. would like it. I e asked grandfather's leave before he went away, , and he gave it to me, as you might know he r would, for dear grandfather. never hindered me a from doing any thing I liked, in my life." ' She spoke slowly, quietly, as she divested [ herself of her riding habit, and handing that also to her companion, reseated, herself upon the sofa. "We are penetrated deeply by your good- ness, dear Miss Somerville," said the General, , while the beautiful, soft eyes of Louis smiled Ihis thanks. I wish I could give you any sort of ju'st idea of Susan Somerville. It were sacrilege to draw her portrait, and not to draw it correctly. She was a medium-sized girl-full--even very full fdrmed-with the well-developed bust, round chin and cheeks, and full, sweet lips, that indicate a fine vital temperament; her complexion was very fair, her eyes large, dark, and calm, and her hair black and silky, and rippling in tiny wavelets over her head, She wore it carelessly, but partly twisted up be- hind, partly drooping down her plump white cheeks and throat. Her dress of dark stuff was neatness itself; but her air?--her air- there, that was magic! She looked like one that calmly and deeply enjoyed her life in every vein. Wisdom and innocence reposed in her serene face. Her manner was full. of grave, sweet comfort. She influenced you like a sedative. It was impossible to be in her company, to look on her heavenly--no, not heavenly, for there was a great deal of earth about it, but her dear, good face, without growing serene and quietly happy like herself. The most beneficial mesmeric influence ema- nated from the presence of Susan Somerville. Hers was a face in which you could place con- fidence, for you felt that beneath all this qui- etude reposed great force of character; nay, that the very consciousness of -that power produced this beautiful and profound calm- the calm of a self-dependent, self-poised na- ture, reposing sublimely on its own great strength. She was really seventeen, but she looked twenty. While. you have been reading this description of her, she has quietly taken out her knitting, and, to make herself more at home, gone to work at it, talking sweetly all the time the servant was laying the cloth and setting the table. It was just impossible for General Stuart-Gordon to go on with his Ches-   terfieldean manner--calling her "Miss Somer- ville," indeed, he never remembered to do it after first greeting her; and as for Louis, he never had addressed her by any other name than "Susan." He had called her Susan in their school-days, and no law of etiquette ever promulgated could make him call her any thing else. , What an air of home and coziness her very presence diffused over that late lonely fireside. It seemed good to have her plying her bright knitting-needles, seated on the sofa; and when the tea-urn was set upon the table, it seemed natural for' General Stuart-Gordon (what a tiresome name to write!) to say- "Come, Susan, my love," and lead her to the table. Let no manoeuvring mamma or match-seek- ing daughter imagine that in Susan Somer- ville's conduct there was a single covert selfish thought. I affirm that it never occurred to her, that the old man of sixty, or the youth not yet eighteen, " were in the market." No, it was simply Susan Somerville's religion, to minister, in every possible way, to the comfort of,those in her reach, perhaps with too little thought or care of self. Tea was over. The evening passed cheer- fully, delightfully. General Stuart-Gordon re- lated numerous anecdotes connected with the Revolutionary War. Louis read an extract from one of Walter Scott's novels, and Susan chatted, or listened, while plying her knitting- needles. At nine o'clock she arose to go; and, attended by her matronly servant, and by the man who waited on them both, she prepared to set out. "And will you come and make tea for us to-morrow, Susan, my dear?" very nervously inquired the old gentleman. "Oh, yes, indeed I to be sure I will-every evening until grandfather returns, for I am sure if I was to die I should not be happy in Heaven, if I did not know that some kind girl came and poured out his coffee; sometimes." "That is a good girl I Louis and myself have dozed and nodded at each other all the even- ings of this month past, until to-night, when you woke us up; and now we will not doze or sleep any more over the fire for a week," said he, as he walked with Susan down the ter- race, across the lawn, and the stone steps, to the water's edge, to the little skiff, and with affectionate care placed her in it, and stood watching its progress across the river, until it stopped at the'beach, and he saw her get out, and, with her attendant, climb up the bluff, and disappear.   CHAPTER VIL THE OBAGS. That dear old home! Something of old ancestral pride it keeps, ' Though fallen from its early power and vastness! The sunlight seems to thy eyes brighter there Than wheresoever else. Fanny Kemble. REMEMBER the position of the Isle of Rays, the - sunny centre of our neighborhood and story. Remember that the Isle was divided. through the middle by a sparkling creek, and that'the southern division of the Isle before and beneath the front of the house was cleared up and laid off in beautiful terraces, conserva- tories, parterres, groves, fountains, serpentine walks, &c., and that fronting this greatly orna- mented southern division, across the river, lay the immense estate, and, surmounting a hill, stood the splendid mansion of Mont Crystal. Very well-now turn to the northern division of the Isle-the division lying back of the house, and still left in all the wild and luxu- riant beauty of nature. It was thickly wooded5: full of rocks, and intersected by several nar- row paths-one of which conducted to a flight of rough stone-steps, cut in the side of the rocks, that led to the clean, sandy beach, where a boat was always moored for the convenience of communication with the northern shore of the river. This northern bank of the river was very different from the beautifully fertile southern shore, the seat of the Mont Crystal estate. This northern bank was wild, rocky, and picturesque beyond description, and, a little further up and back from the river, eveir sub- lime and terrific. This locality also comprised an estate that joined the Island Estate at its6 northwestern boundary.  It was called The Crags, and formed the remnant, the wreck of a vast property, once owned by the Somer- villes, an old and haughty Virginia family, now fallen from their " great estate." A flight of stone steps, cut in the rocky bank of the river, nearly opposite the Isle, conducted the travel- ler to the mainland, and, through a gate, to a narrow path leading now up a steep, craggy declivity, now down a rocky dell, now through a thick copse, now into the deep, rich shades of the forest, among the gorgeous foliage of the trees in their splendid autumn dresses- the glowing scarlet of the oak, the brilliant yellow hickory, the bright green pine and ce- dar, and the rich purple dogwood-to a high range of rocky and wooded hills, among which stood the irregular pile of buildings called, af-   ter the estate to which it belonged, The Crags. This was the retreat of old Major Somerville and his grandchild Susan--the unconventional little visitor of the Isle of Rays. .Major Som- erville had lived to see his patrimony melt away, acre by acre, under the miserable system of old-fashioned Virginia agriculture that he still persisted in, and that I have elsewhere described, until nothing remained, except the rocks and stunted copse-wood immediately around the rough-cast homestead; and to see his family, one by one, die off, until none were left but Susan, the only child of his deceased youngest son. She was, indeed, the angel of his old age. Susan's father had been the youngest of eight children, and had married late in life, so that the old man, her grand- father, was seventy years of age when Susan was born, and was consequently eighty-seven, as Susan was seventeen at the present time.  By the death of both her parents before. she had attained her fifth year, Susan was left in the sole charge of the old man of seventy-five. Major Somerville had no female relative or even housekeeper in his family. His domes- tic affairs were conducted by a skillful and industrious young mulatto woman, a faithful slave, who was the cook, housemaid, nurse, and seamstress--in fact, maid of all work, as her husband was steward, gardener, coachman, and groom-in short, factotum in general to the household. This faithful couple loved their decaying old master as though he had been their own father; and, coupled with this love was a veneration inexplicable as match- less to those who, never having lived in the South, have never had an opportunity of wit- nessing the superstition, the self-immolating devotion of some slaves to their masters and their masters' families-a consecration of self that is paralleled in ardlor, and earnestness, only by a woman's devotion to a tyrannical husband, or a Pagan's devotion to his idol, and that is paralleled in disinterestedness by- nothing! It was beautiful to observe the solicitous forethought by which this excellent couple averted the annoyance of debts and duns from the old man's door by a thousand little con- trivances and economies, and by appropriating silently their own little earnings of the odd hours of their own time. "Old master's" tran- quillity and respectability was the one thing needful to their happiness, and next in import- ance to this, Miss Susie's interests took rank. Much contrivance it required to .confer upon Miss Susie the appearance and throw around   her the prestige of little ladyhood--in a word, to dress her neatly and to send her to school. This was the way in which it was done, and this was the manner in which the happy illu- sion of moderate competency was thrown around the old man. After passing his seventy- fifth year, old Major Somerville was more in- clined to doze in his arm-chair than to look into his accounts. His narrow income was derived from the sale of his small yearly crop, the pro- ceeds of which was locked up in his bureau, divided into twelve equal portions, and given out once a month to George, who, in his cllarac- ter of steward, conducted the financial affairs of the household. Now, this sum was not much over half what was required for the monthly support of the family; and the alternative was to contract debt or to raise-money. All slaves have certain hours in the twenty-four, called their oxm time, in which they may sleep, eat, or work, within the limits of certain time and space. These hours a few have been known to turn to so goad account as to make money enough to purchase their ffredom. This good couple devoted a portion of these hours to hard work-the manufacture of baskets, straw hats, mats, &c., all formed of coarse grass gathered in a distant marsh, brought home, and dried, cut, and twisted, and made up into various articles of domestic utility, which were after- wards sold in the neighboring villages. And, listen! the proceeds of these sales, that might have been put by to accumulate, for the pur- chase of their own freedom at some future day, were devoted--one half to the support of their "old master" and "Miss Susie," and the other half saved to buy the liberty of their only child, a little daughter, near the age of Miss Susie, whose little maid she was. Never was a more affectionate or considerate little mistress than Miss Susie, and never was a more devoted little maid than Annie; yet never for a moment were their relative positions forgotten by either, although with the feudal, the patriarchal usage of old Virginian families, where the children of the slave mingle freely with the children of the master-these two little girls were always together. But, on Miss Susie's part, there was that hereditary pride of family, the natural pride of place. She was born with it; it was in her blood; it was in her bones. It had been nursed-gently nursed, however- from earliest babyhood by all the family, and by every circumstance around her. It was a large, generous, noble pride-a quiet, gentle pride, however-and only manifested itself in a tender, protective consideration for those she   supposed beneath her. This was external pride, if one may call it so, or the pride pro- duced and fostered by external circumstances; but deep in Susan's bosom reposed a profounder pride-the pride of a great and essentially good nature, left untrammelled by restraint, as unwarped by prejudice-unfettered by at- tempts at either. Miss Susie was growing up, free, strong, and independent, in a soil of genial affection and respect. Perhaps this sort of rear- ing would nbt have suited every child as well as it did Susan's fine, deep-toned nature; at all events; it harmonized beautifully with her. And, on Annie's part, her love for her little mistress was her religion. She had been taught by her parents, with their simple, faith in re- ceived opinions, to look up to Miss Susie as to a little queen, a little demi-goddess, a little white angel-in a word, whom-whom it was piety to worship; and Annie thought her thoughts, and dreamed her dreams, and prayed ' her prayers, and saw her visions, through Miss Susie accordingly. But when it was necessary to send Miss Susie to school, because she was white, and a young lady, and MissSomerville -oh! then there were heart-breaking times for Annie-not because George and his wife had to take away another quarter of their earnings-being the half of Annie's freedom money-for Annie was too young to know any thing about that, and far too disinterested to care; but because for six hours a day she should be separated from her little patron saint-the little Virgin of her loving worship --Miss Susie! Couldn't she go with Miss Susie, and carry her basket of dinner and her atlas?-for of course the young lady would not carry her own basket and atlas-of course not; but then Miss Susie was to ride the rough- coated pony over the rocks, and George was to lead it and carry her things. Annie slept in Miss Somerville's chamber, on a pallet by her bed. Annie cried all Sunday night, because her little mistress was going to school Monday morning. Miss Susie would not sleep while she heard Annie's smothered sobbing under the quilts. "Say your prayers, Annie, and go to sleep," recommended Miss Susie. But, at the sound of her voice, Annie only wept-the more, bursting fromn a low sob into a loud wail, a perfect roar of lamentations. Schoolmasters, she said, were ugly and horrid-were perfect bugaboos with big ferules-were ogres-were giants-were ghouls and gnomes-just such as Miss Susie heard about in the ghost stories. Susan stepped out of bed, and sitting down by her side, tried to soothe her-in vain! Every   manifestation of kindness from Miss Susie add- ed fuel to flames, or, to say something now, water to the cataract of her grief. At last Miss Susie recollected that she herself, she also, had a will and an inclination of her own in this affair, and she felt that very certainly her in- clination sat in favor of taking Annie to schopl. So Miss Susie very quietly and very perempto- rily decided. She bade Annie hush cryingi and say her prayers, and go to sleep, for that she should go to school with her the next day. Yes, she should go and carry her basket; the weather was warm, and she could play out doors under the shade of the trees, while she herself was studying in the school-room; and when it blew up cold, or come on to rain, she should come in and sit on a low stool by her desk; and, as for the schoolmaster, of course he would consent to'the plan, for, was she not Miss Somerville, grand-daughter of- Major Somerville of The Crags, and would lie think of denying her t No I The little queen had no idea that she was of a whit less importance anywhere else than she was within the confines of her own domain. Early in the morning she proposed her plan, declaring that she preferred to iwalk,to school, with only Annie to carry her satchel., After some consultation and delay, this plan was agreed upon, and the little maid was rendered happy in the novelties and pleasantries of trudging by the side of her little mistress over the rocks and crags, and through the copses, to school. The country schoolmaster was no ogre, but a mild, patient, long-suffering, and self-devoted soul, as nine-tenths of all the teachers I ever saw are. He permitted -Miss Somerville's little attendant first to sit upon the door-steps, and afterwards, when he foundi how quiet, gentle, and humble she was, he sent for a little stool, and allowed her to sit upon it at the feet of her little mistress, where her position was understood and unquestioned, by the other pupils. It is a singular fact, in the experience of all teachers, that frequently a child will not, or cannot, learn the task as- signed, but will catch by ear, or intuition, the lesson delivered verbally to an older and far- ther advanced class. Thus a child too lazy to learn to read, catches by ear the lectures to a class, and thereby at- tains considerable knowledge of geography, or any other branch of education that may strike his fancy. Little Annie sat at Miss Susie's feet with no dull, stultifying column of words to learn, but with her little sharp eyes and quick ears at liberty to catch any seeds of   knowledge that might fall in her direction. And, with human perverseness, and child-like contrariness, she learned all the. quicker and more because she was not desired or required to learn. And, during their walks home, Annie. would unroll her bundle of acquired knowledge, and display the treasures to Miss Susie's admiration. "I know the shape of the earth, Miss Susie," she would say, raising her fine, black eyes to the face of the little lady; and then'would follow a precise report of the geographical lec-, ture of the morning. "Guess who discovered America, Miss Susie." "Oh, Christopher Columbus, to be sure 1" "Yes Il Oh, warn't he a hero Don't it make your heart swell up big to hear about him, Miss Susie?" the glance of her superb eye bounding up to the countenance of her young mistress,         t       i I Susie would always acquiesce earnestly, but 1 calmly, as if great heroes and grand thoughts were familiar enough to her mind, causing no surprise. But it was history that brought out all the finest points in little Annie's heart-that roused all the enthusiasm of her genius. One evening, when they had been to school about two years, as they were returning home, g Annie walked  silently, solemnly, with her n hands clasped upon her bosom, and her eyes ( cast down, in the involuntary and unconscious attitude of prayer.            " "What is the matter, Annie?" inquired Miss Susie.,  "Sir William  Wallace oh, Sir William  Wallace!" and then she suddenly burst into 1 tears.                  I She alluded to a chapter in the history of tl England, comprising the reign of Edward I., M that she had heard read in school that after- g noon. ':t  "So great, so good, so glorious, and to die h such a' death!"             a "But, Annie, it was a long time ago; and s( now he is a prince in glory, crowned with stars. el You must not cry about him."       bi "Ah, but it reads as though it had just bap- hi pened!"                 m "Ah, but you see it has not, and could not, hi just happen; people do not do such things g( nowadays, particularly in our country, ourfree at country, you know."            be "Yes, I know; but still, Miss Susie--" gl "Well?"                gl "Will you teach me to read now? Idid not we   n. care to learn before, but now I wish' to learn, e so that I can read more about Sir William d Wallace. I kneel down and worship him." d  - "Yes, indeed, I will be very glad to teach a, you; and you will read of many like Sir Wil- d liam Wallace; but you must not grieve for s them-they are archangels now." -A seed of knowledge had fallen on good ground, and was producing fruit. A spark of "fire had dropped into an ardent heart, kindling I the soul of a poor slave-child into enthusiasm - and power. Can I portray, justly, the gradations by which this child's intellect ascended . Can I presume to describe the slow, beautiful, and sublime unfolding of her high soul, as she ad- vanced towards womanhood? No, I will not even attempt it, but leave to the progress of our story to reveal the strange anomaly of a poor slave-girl, (blessed or cursed?) with lofty intellect, profound affection, and high aspira- tions. CHAPTER   VIiI. GENERAL STUART-GORDON'S "OWN MAN. He has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; and he is a good man enough; he's one of the soundest judg- ments, and a proper man of person.--Troilus and Cressida. Does he not hold up his head, as it were, --d strut in his gait?- Tzelfth Jright. UPON the morning succeeding Susan Somer- ville's first visit to the Isle of Rays, General Stuart-Cordon and his son met in the oak par- lor, at an unusually early breakfast. Apollo Belvidere, the General's body servant, as a gen- tleman's valet de chambre is called in the South, was in attendance with his old master's outer garment, for the gentlemen of the Isle of Rays were already falling into slovenly bachelor habits, converting parlors,Jinto dressing-rooms, and vice versa. Apollo Belvidere needs a de- scription, even for those who have seen the cel- ebrated statue of the god of poetry, music, and beauty, who was not his antitype as well as his namesake. Apollo had been " old master's" man ever since both were boys, had attended him in camp, or, to use his own phrase, " had gone with him to the wars;" had cleaned his arms, brushed his uniform, and blacked his boots, during the whole Revolutionary strug- gle; had retired refulgent with the martial glory that blazed around the young hero, and was now reposing with him on his laurels.   What feats I what miracles I of military prow- ess, had his master, General Stuart-Gordon, accomplished 1: What folios, what tomes, what libraries, would the history of his exploits fill, as related by his biographer, Apollo, of even- ings at the side of the great kitchen fire, to the assembled, admiring, and astonished household I On-comparing Apollo's accounts of his master's slain, crippled, or " captivated," with the army reports of the killed, wounded, or captured, one would be forced to decide that Apollo told lies H beg pardon-" elevated the real into the ideal!"-or that no one else had shed -blood in the cause of liberty. Apollo admired his master with all his soul, and imitated him with all his might. When Captain -Henry Cart- wright first married the heiress- and assumed the name of the Stuart-Gordons, and took up his residence at the Isle of Rays, Apollo's pride in his master, and glory in the great alliance, was somewhat dimmed by the haughtily im- posed condition that deprived the young bride- groom of his patronymic, illustrious as he con- sidered it with inilitary glory. Family pride in America is, with rare excep- tions, to be found only in Maryland and Vir- ginia, where it characterizes the descendants of the high churchmen, the Catholics, and the cavaliers, who settled these States-or, among the very few families that emigrating thence, have settled in the Carolinas and the distant- ,Southern States. In the far South, as in the North and the West, there is the pride of wealth-in Maryland and Virginia, only the pride of birth. And this tacit assertion of fam- ily dignity is as emphatic, in old Maryland and Virginian tobacco planters, as the same thi;g in an Irish baronet or a "Heeghland laird." And it extends from the head of the house to the poorest old slave bred on the plantation. Just as in Scotland and Ireland, peasantry and clansmen fight about the relative dignity of their lords and chiefs, so in Maryland and Vir- ginia, the old family servants dispute about the comparative antiquity and respectability of v their masters' families. So it was a grievous mortification, as you ( may judge, to Apollo Belvidere, when his mas- i ter, abjuring his patronymic, assumed the ' name of Stuart-Gordon. It was in a state of I deep distress, between his pride and his humil- 1 iation, that, on the morning after the wedding, in emerging from the dressing-room of his a master, at whose toilet he had just been assist- C ing, Apollo Belvidere encountered Seraphina, E the dressing-maid of the bride. It was the I first time that the Apollo had seen '," that We- a   - nus carbed in jet," as he afterwards called her. , Apollo made a magnificent bow--just such a ; one as he, had seen his master make on enter- , ing a ball-room; Seraphina courtesied-just as - Miss Stuart-Gordon did on receiving a visitor; 3 and then presumed that. she had the honor of I speaking to Mr. Apollo, Captain Stuart-Gor- don's gentleman, and hoped that he would fol- low her in to breakfast, which was tlen ready in the front kitchen. Mr. Apollo winced; but, drawing himself up, thought that Miss Sera- phina was under a " collusion ;" he had not the honor of an acquaintance with Captain Stuart-, Gordon, whom, he supposed, was the brother of the new Mrs. Cartwright, he said, as he ac- companied her to the breakfast-table. Then Miss Seraphina, believing his assumed ignor- ance real, explained the conditions of the mar- riage. In reply to this, Mr. Apollo courteously insinuated that there must be still some mistake; that such an arrangement would be " convert- ing all the substituted usages of society into miscord."  Miss Seraphina expounded, with some hauteur, too I that it was a custom of the Stuart-Gordons, whenever an heiress of the house was given in marriage, to exact of the bridegroom the assumption of the family name; that this was very proper, for that they 'were descended from the royal Stuarts of Scotland; whereas Captain Cartwright, now Captain Stuart-Gordon, was of a comparatively new family. Apollo Belvidere plumed up!-pride conquered gallantry. His Chesterfieldean ur- banity and propriety of manner, his Webste- rian precision and elegance of language were forgotten; starting up, he exclaimed- "Pish tush! tut! pshaw!-don't tell me about King Charles' unlegitimate descendants:, King Charles himself was a rebellion hanged for treason! If -blood were gold, Captain Henry Cartwright (I will call him Cartwright I) could sell and buy the whole house of you! He descended from King Charles, were you!" he sneered, with a diabolical grin of scorn and malice contorting his shining black face. "Captain Cartwright can say more than that I Captain Cartwright's nigger was descended from a King I I am great-grandson of Prince Tongataboo, Emperor of Eahei-poewai, and if I'm a man-servant now, it's through the for- tunes of war!" I do not know how Apollo Belvidere looked at that time, but I have heard him accurately described as he looked in his old age-as he stood that morning, near the door of the oak parlor, with his master's hunting-coat thrown across his arm, his spurs in his hand; his tall,   broad-shouldered, erect figure, dressed in an old suit of his master's blue and yellow regi- mentals, was surmounted by a face black as jet, seamed and wrinkled like an Indian wal- nut, and shining like a dried prune, and topped by a crop of hair white as snow. As the gentlemen arose from their break- fast, and as the General walked leisurely up to his old servitor, and, laying off his dressing- gown, and receiving the hunting-coat from his hands, addressing his son, he said- "The hounds meet at Battletown Plains, this morning; will you not join us for once, Louis?" Louis declined, with a grave smile. He was weary of reiterating his aversion to field-sports. "What will you do with yourself, then, Louis? Stay, I will tell you. Ride over 'to Mont Crystal and call on Miss Armstrong- will you not?" Again Louis gravely declined the proposition. "You are a strange youth, Louis. 'Man delights you not, nor woman either.' How do you intend to pass the day  Why not pay your respects to Miss Armstrong?" "Do you not think, father, that there is an- other lady who has a primary claim to my humble services, this morning?" "Miss Somerville I Ah, yes. But Susan is such a'recluse, that one scarcely ever thinks of visiting her. However, present my compli- ments to Miss Somerville, and, thanking her again for her condescension last evening, say that if I dared ask so much of her courtesy, I should entreat her to come over and pour out the old man's tea again." Smiling unconsciously at this droll blending of natural social affections with prime conven- tional ceremony, Louis bowed acquiescence; and the General, now fully accoutred, went out from the house, and, mounting his great black hunter, set forth for Battletown Plains.

A being of sudden smiles and tears, Passionate visions, quick light and shade. Hemans. Louis STUART-GORDON sauntered slowly, ab- stractedly ; feeling, without noticing, the cheer-   ing influence of the sunlight, flashing on the bright waters, and burning on the gorgeous crimson, golden, and purple-hued foliage of the trees-sauntered down the marble steps, and across the terrace, to a finely-gravelled serpen- tine walk, which conducted to a little iron gate on the west, that led from the ornamented grounds into the copse, and thence, through a rough path, to the rocky thicket behind the house. Passing through this tangled thicket, and down the rough stone stairs, he stepped into the little boat fastened to a post on the beach, and loosening the chain that confined it, took the solitary oar and rowed for the opposite shore, secured his boat, and, ascending the rude steps leading up the rocky bank, stood upon, ,the mainland. The path leading through the copses and thickets of that wild and rocky shore towards The Crags, "the short cut," as it was called, for striking direct through every sort of horri- ble obstacle, was toilsome and perilous to the most agile and. athletic traveller. It was intersected by deep, though narrow, rocky chasms, the. descent and ascent of which were rendered more difficult and dangerous by the slippery surface of the rocks, and by the ab- sence of any bush or projection to aid in going down or climbing up. An hour's toilsome walk, or rather-climbing up and down, yet still ascending as he advanced, brought Louis to the. summit:- of The Crags, upon which stood the old gray house. It was a large, irregular pile of building%, constructed of the gray rock found on the spot. A wall of the same rude material closed in an exten- sive yard, specked, not shaded, by a few dwarfed pine and cedar bushes. The ground outside of this stone wall, and immediately around the house, was bare, sterile, and rocky. The first English proprietor of the estate could have had no other inducement to erect his mansion-house here, than was afforded by the fine salubrity of the air, and the magnificent prospect around. The view from the south front of the house was, on the right hand, beautiful as Eden; on the left, sublime, and even terrific. South from the craggy heights on which the house stood, rough, rocky, and jagged hills, tufted between the clefts with clumps of stunted tree%, fell pitching and precipitating headlong towards the river. On the west, to- wards the Alleghanies, through a defile of which roared onward the river, till it thunder- ed over the precipice, and, with many a re-   bounding leap, and re-echoing howl, hurried, boiling and foaming, among the jagged rocks of the blasted channel, until, falling over a lower decline, it glided, on smoothly towards the ri- sing sWm, dividing to embrace the sparkling Isle of Rays. This was the prospect on the east, south, and west. Behind the house, on the north, the hills reared higher and still higher, while they fell backwards towards the horizon. Once, thou- sands of acres of the rich plains and luxurious forest lands below, were owned and cultivated by the Somllervilles-now, nothing remained to the old man and his grand-daughter but the blasted heights known as The Crags. You will wonder where this old and impoverished gen- tleman raised his slender crops. About in spots: on small patches of moderately fertile soil; on the sunny fall of some of the hills; on the alluvion between them; or on the low shore of the river where it glided on below the Isle of Rays. There were two or three small out-houses, such as a kitchen, a smoke-house, &c., like the mansion, built of gray stones, and the ruins of many more, stuck here and there within the walls of the large yard. There was an air of great stillness and solitude in the scene as Louis entered the old gate, before the warm, bright, morning sun had had time to melt the frost from the steps of the old piazza, in this cold locality. Louis rapped at the oaken door, which was immediately opened'by (George, the factotum of the household, and who, turning the lock of a second door, namely, on the left of the wide entrance-hall, announced- "Mr. Stuart-Gordon!" And Louis, passing in, foundhimself in the family sitting-room, and in the presence of Miss Somerville and her attendant, Anna. It was a poor room, large and ill-furnished, with decayed, old-fashioned furniture, consisting of an old carpet--whole, but faded all into one dark-brown hue-old high-backed walnut chairs, with leather bottoms; little -spider- legged mahogany tables and stands; a tall, right-angular walnut cupboard, with glass doors, in one corner; a tall, old mahogany escritoir opposite, in the other; a third cor- ner being filled up with a high, coffin-shaped clock; and the fourth being occupied by the large, right-angled fireplace, that crossed it. There was something here that compensated for all the poverty of the room. Virginians are accustomed to say, "A good fire is a hand- some piece of furniture," and here a glorious fire of oak and pine wood blazed on the am- ,',1,    -      *Jt   pie hearth, roariig up the chimney, and diffu- sing a genial warmth through the large room I! Miss Somerville and her maid were both seated at the fire, with a work-stand between them. Miss Somerville, looking as serenely beautiful as usual,' in her dark stuff dress, with her glossy, black hair, half-carelessly caught up behind under her tortoise-shell comb, half- dropping in soft, black, shining rings, down dhe plump, white cheek. Susan was engaged in needle-work, and her attendant was reading to her, as Mr. Stuart-Gordon -entered. The girl immediately closed the bookl, and keep- ing her place, in it with her finger and thumb, held it upon her lap, while her head was bent, and her large, sloping, gloomy black eyes, half hidden by their heavy lids, fell upon the floor. Miss Somerville arose with her usual serene dignity, and welcoming her visitor, begged him to be seated. Anna also left her seat,and courtesying respectfully, withdrew to the other end of the long room. Susan following her with her eyes, as though she were half in- clicred to summon her back. She did not do so, however, but turning, seated herself, say- ing :- "Anna was just reading Ivanhoe to me. Miss Britannia O'Riley, Miss Armstrong's gov- erness, receives all these new things from Washington, and she is so kind as to send them over to me, afterishe has perused them. Anna reads them aloud, while I sew; and," added she, sotto voce, "Anna possesses that rarest of all accomplishments, a fine elocution. I should like to have you hear her read." " I should be very much pleased to do so, indeed," said Louis, " she must have a fine con- ceptipn of her subject, as well as a musical: , voice and a good enunciation, to delight so much Miss Somerville's fastidious taste./'" "I am not fastidious, as I do not pretend to taste; yet Anna has all the fine points of a good reader that you have enumerated, and I think perhaps I have judgment enough to ap- preciate them-poor Anna!" "And why poor Anna? Is she not very. happy in your gentle service, Miss Somer- ville a" "You do not know the girl, Louis, or you would not ask me. Look at her now," added she, in a subdued voice. Louis turned his eyes to the window at which she stood, and was struck with the attitude and expression of utter despair into which the girl had unconsciously fallen. Louis looked at her with an attention that he had never before bestowed on Miss Somerville's attendant.   And now he observed for the first time that she possessed the most lofty style of beauty. Her tall, full, graceful figure was finely curved, as she leaned upon the high back of an old leathern chair, looking abstractedly from the window, the light from which fell upon- her superb head, covered with a magnificent suit of black hair, that, dividing above her broad, pale forehead, rippled off into thousands of tiny jet-black, glistening wavelets over her temples and around her cheeks, and was gath- ered into a large knot confined by a silver bodkin behind. Her sloping, gloomy, but beau- tiful eyes, the sad expression of her full, red lips, closed as they habitually were, were add- ed to the fascination of a face that attracted without volition or consciousness. Her dress was of the coarse linsey-woolsey worn in win- ter by Southern house-servants, but hers was plaid, of very brilliant colors, made high in the neck, with sleeves reaching the wrists, fitting - accurately her charmingly developed form, and harmonizing well with her dark, imperial style of beauty. Louis looked at her, at first, in obedience to Miss Somerville's indication; then with surprise and admiration at the sin- gular beauty he had never before noticed; and lastly, with wonder as to the sorrow, the rec- ollection of which could so suddenly convert the lately ardent and animated reader, glow- ingly alive to all the beauties and sublimities of her subject, into the pale, cold, lifeless sta- tue of despair, so apparently lost' to the world around her, as to be totally unconscious of the scene and presence in which she stood. Louis turned his eyes inquiringly to the serene coun- tenance of Miss Somerville. "She is a slavel" murmured Susan, in a low, but emphatic tone. Louis looked perplexed, bewildered, and did not reply. Susan smiled sadly at his embar- rassment, as she continued gravely- "You would say, Louis, that you were al- ready aware of that fact; that this was nothing new or extraordinary in her position-that, in a word, you know she is a slave; but do you also know, Louis, all that means to her?"I He did not reply, but seemed engaged in thought.  Susan continued, in a low, earnest Voice- "No; you, like other excellent men I know, look on slavery with indifference. It is the  nonchalance of custom. -But this girl! --I tell i you, Louis, that were you or myself now re- I duced to slavery--were we to change positions a with one of our slaves--become his property-- ] subject to his orders-a thing to be chained,   b imprisoned, beaten, bought, sold, at his whim-- neither you nor I could have a more poignant sense of degradation than she suffers; for, Louis, she had naturally a sensitive heart and a lofty intellect, and, even in her condition and circumstances, both have been too highly culti- vated for her peace." "I suppose," said Louis, thoughtfully, "nay, it is inevitable, that her condition must be painful and humiliating in proportion to her intellect and sensibility; but was the cultiva- tion of this mind and heart well? Was it even merciful, on your part, Miss Somerville? I think in her case, indeed, where ' ignorance is' so palpably ' bliss, it is folly to be wise.'" "Even if I'had been disposed, I could; not have repressed the growth and development of Anna's intellect;. but do not think that I was disposed I No, Louis; let the soul have free course to reach its highest life, through sorrow - and anguish, if necessary.- No, Louis; any life and light, even the6 life of suffering in the light of fire, is higher than the death of darkness, of stillness, of nothingness. No, Louis; give her the fires of purgatory rather than the ease of annihilation." The usually calm face 'of the girl was in- spired and glowing while she spoke. "You are right, Miss Somerville, perfectly right," said the youth; " and," added he,'blush- ing ingenuously, "I feel ashamed of my super- ficially formed and hastily expressed opinion." Seeing now that Anna had withdrawn from the room, Miss Somerville continued to speak of her. "She has been my intimate companion from babyhood up. I do not remember the time when Anna was not by my side.' She went to school to wait on me. Could any one--even had such a one been affected with your just expressed opinion, as to the inexpediency of educating a slave--could any one, I say, sus- pect that a little child, sitting at my feet with- out books, could pick up an education by eye and ear, feeding her hungry mind with the crumbs of knowledge that fell from the rich man's table; or could any one have prevented the progress of such a mind, only once awa- kened and aroused? Anna has been and is dear to me as a sister. She has more ardor, more fire, than my Anglo-Saxon blood gives me, and even in,her childhood I have seen her kindle into enthusiasm when history or poetry gave back the gorgeous past, and heroes or martyrs again lived, struggled, suffered, or died before her. Then her admiration, her enthusiasm, was unalloyed joyl She was so charming,   that her society was, to me, unmixed delight. Her appreciation gave effect to books otherwise only moderately interesting to me, as her eye and voice kindled her subject into brilliance. g  Louis, that was in her simple, self-forgetting childhood, when we were sisters and compan- i  ions, and walked with our arms around each other's waists. But here is now another pe- [  riod-a time of self-remembrance and of sorrow to both of us-of humiliation to her. Now she i  will at times glow with something like her old enthusiasm when reading some tale of 'daring achievement, or of courageous endurance, or self-immolating martyrdom, in some old history or high epic poem, and her cheek will burn, her eye blaze, her tongue grow eloquent with the enthusiasm of her soul. Then, suddenly, as memory comes, she will become silent, grow pale as ashes, and, involuntarily, inevitably, fall into an attitude of mute despair. She never speaks of her position, her sorrow; I never heard her utter a word of complaint, im- patience, or repining, in my life. I have seen her suffer excruciating bodily pain, and when I have been distressed to death at her agony, she has smiled a mournful smile at the sympa- thy that could so far forget, or was so uncon- scious of the great, the permanent, the all-ab- sorbing sorrow of her life, as to lavish itself upon a minor and transient trial." "But is this, must this be, a permanent sor- row V" "Alas, I greatly fear so I though God knows the only thing needful to my repose is Anna's freedom." "And can you not accomplish this object, so just and so dear to you, Susan 8" "Ah, no I You are aware, or perhaps you are not aware, of my grandfather's peculiar disposition,or, to speak more accurately, his present peculiar state of mind. He is very old, you know, nearly ninet,::and he has a ;? nervous dread of losing the control of his own mind-a fear lest I should suppose him imbe- cile-in his dotage-a suspicion that I think him incapable of self-government, and that I wish to govern him. This makes him exceed- ingly jealous of my influence, exceedingly sus- picious of any plan I may propose to him, and the more anxious I feel for the accomplishment of my wishes, the firmer he shows himself in the rejection of the proposition, whatever it may be. The first time I was struck with this was the day on which I first went to him to petition for Anna's freedom., Anna had fallen into one of her fits of deep'but mute despon. dency, from which nothing on earth could    arouse her. Though she said nothing, I gained e the cause of her despair, and suddenly, for the e first time, the possibility of its removal occurred  to me. I went to my grandfather,. as he was ,dozing in his big arm-chair, and spoke my - petition. Awakened suddenly and very much ; i surprised, he gazed at me in silent perplexity.' I repeated and urged my petition; and then he smilingly caressed me, and told me that my : patrimony in land and negroes was too small to bear abatement, and that young girls knew nothing about such things. Then I began to reason with him-that was unluckily thought of; it awakened his jealous self-esteem, and he said gravely, even mournfully: 'My dear Susan, I give you the largest personal liberty; you may do what you wish to do, in the way you wish to do it; go where you like, when you like, and stay as long as you like; make what friends or reject what acquaintances you please-unquestioned and unreproved by your grandfather. I leave you to your own govern- ment, because, Susan, I think you capable of self-guidance. Pay me the respect of believing the same thing of me, my dear IV What could I say I I said every thing I could think of, but the more I talked the firmer he became-he seemed adamant. I have returned again and again to the subject, without any other effect than, of late, that of irritating him." "And yet there is not a gentler-hearted man in the world than your grandfather." "Yes I that is it. If the thing had occurred to his own mind first, he would not have hesitated a moment. But it is mournful to see how shakingly he sits upon his tottering throne, and how tremblingly he holds his falling sceptre of self-sovereignty, and how he dreads.:. lest some one should wish to wrest it from his feeble grasp. It is pathetic to see the sad compromise he makes by offering me my. free will on condition that I should not seek to fetter his." "There is a sadder sight than that-Anna t Yet still, Miss Somerville, I cannot see why you set the seal of despair upon Anna's sorrow by calling it permanent. In the course of nature, before very long, the destiny of Anna, if she lives, must fall into your hands, and you will free her at once." Suddenly a dark shadow    overswept the countenance of Susan Somerville, and she for an instant lost the power of reply. Then, recovering somewhat, she said sorrowfully- "Alas I you do not know-my poorL grand- father does not know himself--that he is, overwhelmed with debt; that he lies hourly   at the mercy of a set of creditors, any one of whom at any time may levy on his property, and sweep off house, land, and people. There, sir I! that .is the great terror of my life-the daily expectation of seeing my foster-parents, George and Harriet, that excellent couple, and my dear foster-sister, Anna, sold into redemptionless slavery, and to see my feeble, gray-haired grandfather turned houseless into the world!" Louis was surprised, dismayed, at this unexpected information. He did not for some moments attempt to reply, but fell into deep and serious thought. At last, judging that the hour of their frugal dinner was near, and not wishing to embarrass them by his pres- ence, he arose to take leave, expressing his hope .and his father's wish that Miss Somer- ville might come over in the evening. "I will do so," said Susan, quietly. "Then, dear Miss Somerville, will you permit me to come, and meet, and escort ] you "                    1 "If you please," said Susan, absently; then E added, "Yes, I thank you I I shall be very  happy." CHAPTER X.          ( THE OLD COUNTRY SCJHOOLMASTER.

Ben Jonson. REMEMBER that the northern bend of the 8' river was wild and rocky, rising to Tile Crags, it and that the southern shore, upon which was 8 situated Mont Crystal, was undulating and  P hilly. Remember that the northern, the rocky p and barren bank was behind .the palace on the- h Isle of Rays-the southern, the undulating  sc shore, was before and in front of it. Recollect, n that in sight of the front windows of the tc palace were two homesteads. I pointed them st out to you myself. One, the nearer, and far tl the More magnificent, was the marble-fronted pI mansion of Mont Crystal, " crowning a gradual ai hill," rising from  the river shore. Of the b( other, the more distant and the humbler, you lil could see nothing but the top of a. steep  as gable-ended rooft sticking up from the thicket th   f of trees, on the right hand towards the east of , Mont Crystal That thicket of pines, with the sloping plains behind it, forms the Dovecote farm, and the steep-roofed, gable-ended cot- tage is the farm-house. The farm is very small, and the soil is very poor-is quite worn out, from having been worked too hard and too constantly, and fed too little; and the farm-house is very small, and very much out of repair. The Dovecote farm is called by the name of its old owner, Gabriel Dove, a patriarch of seventy years of age, who has been the schoolmaster of the neighborhood for the last fifty years, and after a long life of the most laborious toil and self-denying fru- gality, and of the most beneficial devotion to others, found himself at seventy a much poorer man in this world's goods than he was at twenty, when he entered the profession. He had received the teacher's meed of poverty and pleasant memories. It was the old man's pride to claim every child, man, and woman, under sixty years old, in the neighborhood, as his some time pupit. The haughty lady of Mont Crystal had conned her A B C under his tuition. General Stuart-Gordon'had scrawled his first pot-hooks and hangers on his forms. Gentle Margaret Stuart-Gordon had cooed her a-b-abs at his side. And at' a later day, young Louis had studied his Greek exercises and solved his Euclid's prob- lems under his eye, and the calm, wise Susan Somerville had studied her grammar, while the eager Annie sat at her feet, drinking in large draughts of .knowledge, and kindling into enthusiasm when the chivalry or martyr- dom of the past was the theme of instruction; and how the schoolmaster loved those little girls--the serene Susan, thie ardent Annie! and many a sly, kind pat on the head and stroke of the cheek did the latter receive-for it would not have keen expedient to have shown her favor in the presence of the other pupils-it would have ended in some of his proud patrons requiring her expulsion from her humble seat, or have broken up his school I He did not wish the former, he could not afford the latter alternative. So he tried to keep Annie quiet and happy in her lowly station of mere sufferance. Ah! the heart of the gentle old man was gladdened by such pupils as Susie and Annie, and he could ill afford to lose them. And there, too, close behind Susie, murmured the voice of another little maiden, conning her little task-Zoe, the adopted daughter of the old schoolmaster- that was all that was known of her. The old   man had opened his door one fine summer morning, and found a babe packed up in a basket upon the porch; and after having recovered from the shock and collected his scattered senses, and after having vainly endeavored to prevail on some of the rich neighbors to adopt the child, he had carried it to the almshouse one evening, had returned home, and groaned in the spirit all night, and had risen at early dawn, and travelled over to the almshouse, to reclaim the little castaway, had brought it back, and adopted it. One- half the neighborhood- said the old school- master was mad, and the other half would have hinted that he had been wicked; but that "the very fangs of malice" could not have gnawed a flaw into which to insert a doubt-so crystal, pure, and polished had been the old man's life. So little Zoe (that was the name he gave his adopted baby) was conveyed to the care of the old free negress, whom  he had hired as his cook, house- keeper, &c. But now times were very badly changed with the old man. I cannot say that he had seen (" better days." -He had never seen good days, much less " better" ones. In a worldly and pecuniary point of view, his days had been bad, and now they were worse. He was older, and, for his life of self-devotion, poorer in purse, and feebler in person, than he should have been at seventy. Teachers wear out sooner than other men; I do not mean spu- rious teachers, who take up the "'trade" for a mere livelihood-but teachers anointed by God himself for their mission and their martyrdom. The country boasts--io, never boasts of them -their " quiet paths of unobtrusive goodness" lead through the unfrequented by-ways of life. Their prospectuses do not fill newspapers, but their labors fill hearts and heads, at least a few hearts and heads, with goodness and wisdomn- the country possesses many such. But times that always had been bad, were now worse with our old schoolmaster; his energies were decayed, his steps were tottering, as he leaned more and more heavily upon his stick, as he bent forward towards the scene of his daily labors. His hand trembled as he guided the pen or pencil of his pupils, and his eyes dimmed with reading, and the letters of the "Latin grammar swam together, even with the aid of his spectacles. People began to whisper that the old school- master was getting too old and infirm for his business, and that he ought, in justice to the neighborhood, to resign it to younger hands; c %r      , '   and many began to remove their children from his charge. The old man had now   about twelve pupils, at from two to five dollars per quarter each. As is always the case, the parents or guardians of only about half this number paid him; so that the old school- master's income did not amount to more than twenty-five or thirty dollars per quarter. Even this small salary was fast, very fast, decreasing. At the end of every quarter, and especially at the end of every half year, some of his old pupils were sure to drop off, and their places were never supplied by new ones. So much for his school. At home, changes had also transpired. The old negress, who for many years had been his housekeeper and servant, was dead; and the old schoolmasters reduced means did not al- low himto employ another. The cares and labors of the household devolved on his adopted child, Zoe; and admirably did the little maiden acquit herself of the duties. Of all the old teacher's pupils, of sixty years old and under, none remembered or visited him, with the exception of two-a brother and a sister; the sister, a girl whose name was a by-word and a mockery in the neighborhood- Gertrude Lion-the Diana, the amazon, the giantess, the Gerfalcon, as she was called; the brother, Brutus Lion, a masculine exagger- ation of all that was most obnoxious and un- popular in the character and habits of the Ger- falcon. CHAPTER XL' THE DOVECOTE AND THE DO'VE. Go lift the willing latch-the scene'explore- Sweet peace and love and joy thou there shalt find, For there religion dwells, whose sacred lore Leaves the proud wisdom of the world behind, And-pours a heavenly ray on every human mind. Dr. Huntington, There is a light around her brow, A holiness in those dark eyes, Which show, though wandering earthward now, Her spirit's home is in the skies. MJoore, THROUGH the front windows of the Island Palace you have already caught a distant glimpse of the steep gable-end of the Dovecote peeping up above the, thicket.     Now let us take a nearer view. The Dove- cote is rather a cot than a cottage. It is the I   tiniest and the most secluded little home in the whole valley. No highway comes near it. One narrow foot-path leads to it. This path leads down the southern descent of the richly wooded hill of Mont Crystal, and meandering lower and deeper into a glen that opened a narrow vista to the river, and passing through the thicket and across the brook at the bottom, leads gently upward to the little wicket-gate of the small garden in front of the tiny cot wedged up against and sheltered on three sides by closely pressing and thickly wooded hills. Thus this sweet, secluded little home is visible only from one point-towards the Isle of Rays. This one path, wending past the tiny garden-gate, leads through a short, rich brushwood, down to the sandy beach of the river, where to a post is tied a little skiff with one oar, in which the old schoolmaster rows himself across the river every morning and evening in going to and returning from the scene of his daily school labors. For, be it re- membered, that the school-house is situated on the opposite bankof the river, and far up towards The Crags. The Dovecote, besides being extremely small, is constructed in the simplest form, and out of the rudest and readiest materials-the walls, of twenty feet square, being built of red sand- stone found on the spot, and the roof being covered with pine boards, now nearly black with long exposure to the weather. 'One little door, with one little window to the left, are shaded by the projecting eaves of the roof whichi supported by straight pillars made of the slender trunks of the pine-trees, with the bark on, forms the rude porch. There is room for the little garden only in front, the sides and back of the house being crowded by the hills. So, dear young school-girl reader, the Dove- cote is no stereotyped, neat white cottage with green blinds, the custom-sanctioned abode of youth, love, and romance; no-its colors are those of the Virgin Mary's costume in certain old Flemish pictures, namely : dun red be- neath, dusky blue above, but more picturesque, more beautiful, and romantic it is, I assure you, than your sentimental fancy thing of white and green could be. The deep rich hue of the red walls, the fine, dark-blue roof, sur- rounded by the brilliantly variegated colors of the gorgeous autumn foliage, the glowing scar- let of the oak, the dark green of the pines and cedars, the bright yellow hickory, the rich purple dogwood, crowning the close hills, and the intense blue of the mountains in the back-   ground, formed a fine, rich, deep-toned picture, that, when the sun mounted to the meridian, kindled into burning refulgence. So much for the outside of the picture-now come in. This small front door admits you into the room-the only room  on the ground floor. Look around-this apartment is parlor, kitchen, and dining-room, for the little family, yet it jis the picture of neatness. The walls are colored stone-gray; on the floor is a home-made carpet of red and green plaid, and at the only win- dow is a red and green paper blind to match. Just opposite to the door you enter is the fire- place, where a clear, bright fire is burning; on each end of the mantelpiece is a bright brass candlestick, and a small clock occupies the centre. On the right hand of the fireplace is a corner cupboard, with glass doors, through which you can see the nice, clean crockery ware. On the left hand is a deal table, scoured white as a curd; the chairs are of common white deal, to match the table. And in one corner of the room, to the left of the window, is a small stand with a drawer-that is Zoe's work-stand, where she keeps all her needle- work; but it is never removed from that corner, because on top of that stand is the cottage library, consisting of the family Bible, Shakspeare, Milton, and the Life of John How- ard.; and above the work-stand, next to the window, hangs a portrait of Jolin Howard- that was the image the old schoolmaster wor- shipped I Little did he think he was an idolater. Above stairs there were two little bedrooms, one occupied by the old man and the other by Zoe. And now I want to tell you about this red and green plaid carpet on the floor. It is just laid down. It is the work of Zoe's own hands -the product of Zoe's own industry and econ- omy. Nothing is lost in that small household. All the old man's cast-off garments, and all Zoe's worn-out clothes, have been saved for years past--have been washed, cut up into narrow strips, twisted into cord, dyed-one- half green and one-half red-and "'is now woven into this fresh, new, bright carpet. Zoe has an especial little housewife's pleasure in having drawn out from the crysalis of an old-clothes barrel the butterfly of a new plaid carpet. It is an event in -her life that this new carpet is now finished and laid down, and that she has been able, from her scanty savings, to purchase the window blind to match it. The old man has not returned from school yet, and she is   awaiting his arrival with great interest, to note his expression of surprise and pleasure when he finds the hitherto bare, cold boards covered with that bright, warm carpet, that gives such an air of comfort and coziness to the room. It was the last school-day before Christmas -that is, it was Friday, and Christmas was to come on Tuesday-therefore, Zoe had laid down her new carpet, had made up a glowing fire, had rerubbed the brass fire-dogs to a silvery brightness, and had painted the brick hearth with red ochre, found in the neighboring brook. She had set the coffee-boiler over the blaze, made an Indian-meal johnny-cake on a long pine board, propped it up with a smoothing- iron before the fire to bake, and laid two red- herrings on the coals to broil They could not afford a table-cloth, for those were not the days of cheap goods, but Zoe's white deal table did not need one-it looked very nice, set out with its blue delf-ware. Zoe was happy, busy, and watchful. She sat down to quilt-piecing, while watclting her johnny-cake bake. It is time to describe this bonny small house- wife. S. he was a gentle, tender little creature, with a fair, delicate skin, with soft, dark eyes, and fine, silky black hair, inclined to curl, but plainly twisted up. She wore upon this festive evening a dove-colored mering dress, with a black silk apron and little white collar-these were presents from her friend "Brighty," who asseverated that a pretty child ought some- times, at least, to be prettily dressed. If I were obliged to describe the, cottage and the young cottager by one epithet, I should call them clean. "So neat and clean," was the form of praise every body bestowed upon the little house and the little housekeeper, by all the"' kind-hearted neighbors. "You might take a fresh pocket-handkerchief, and wipe up the floor from one end to the other, without soiling the cambric," would be the asseveration of all the admiring matrons of the neighborhood, whlen holding up the little housewife as an example to their daughters or- to their domes- tics. Yes; the little apartment was glittering with cleanliness. And now, as the day is declining, the sunbeams smile into the room, and the smile is flashed back, here, and there, and everywhere, by the bright brass candle- sticks on the mantelpiece, by the fire-irons, by the mirror, by the clear glass tumblers, by the clean crockeqr-ware in the corner cupboard, and by the glittering tea-service on the table. Lastly, the sun'smiles archly, slantingly, on the glistening little black head and nice gray dress of Zoe, and, withdrawing its rays, sinks 8   below the horizon. Zoe has watched and waited anxiously, her supper is ready, and it is now quite time her father was in. ' She has laid aside her work, and has gone to the win- dow to look out. The sky has changed, the wind has shifted to the east, and blown up dense white snow clouds-a snow storm is rapidly coming on-Zoe remains at the window, anxiously looking down the foot-path leading to the river, and hoping that befores the snow begins to fall, her father may have reached home. "I wish he would come," murmured Zoe to herself. "Oh I how I do wish he would come," and she strained her eyes down the darkening path. Then she ran up stairs, and bringing down his warm, soft, wool-lined slippers, she laid them before the fire, and, taking out his wadded wrapper from a closet under the stairs, she turned the sleeves, and hung it over the back of the chair to warm. Then she resumed her watch. Never did lady watch for her lover with more anxiety than did little Zoe for her old father. The snow was beginning to fall fine-soon it thickened, so that she could not see an inch from the window. It was growing quite dark. She lighted a candle, and drew up the paper blind, so that he might see the- light from the house, as a guide. "Ah I I l know what keeps him," said Zoe; "he is breaking up school for two weelis only, and yet he must give an affectionate farewell lea- ture to the school in general, and a loving ex- hortation to each pupil in particular, as his or- her wants may require. Dear father  It is; getting too dark now; he will lose his way; 1E must go and meet him." And, rising, she'ran, up stairs, got her cloak and hood, lighted a lantern, and set out, followed by the cream-- colored setter, wlo had risen and stretched himself, as soon as he sawl her come down with* her hood on. She walked on through the whirling snow, the dog keeping closely at her' side. She reached the beach where the boat was usually tied. It was too dark and snowy to see any thing beyond the short glare of the. lantern; but she knew, of course, that the lit- tle skiff was not there--that the old man had, that morning, as usual,passed across the river in it-and that it was now moored on the other- side, awaiting him, if, indeed, he were not now returning in it. She walked down to the edge of the river, and threw the glare of the lantern across it. She could see nothing; the snow was freezing as it fell, and her cloak was' get- ting stiff with ice. Her feet were like lifeless clods, and. her hands so hard and numb, that' ,..   she could scarcely hold the lantern-so she hung it on the branch of a tree, as a beacon light, and stood waiting. Now. she could see the river, and the little boat crossing the line of light thrown by the lantern, and soon it reached the beach, and soon a crackling foot- step sounded on the frozen snow, and then the old man's hand was laid in blessing on her head. '"God love thee, my dove-eyed darling 1" he said.  "Oh I father, your hands are so cold I Lean on my arm, and let us make haste home. Sup- per is ready." "Lean on thy arm, my poor little girl I Walk on before, with the lantern, child, and I will follow thee." She obeyed him.   The thick falling snow prevented further conversation, and they en- tered the little cottage before another word was exchanged between them. Then Zoe dropped her own cloak, and helped her father off with his great coat, his boots, and so forth; and then she brought him his wrapper, and, lastly, the old r man sat down in his study-chair, ran his feet into i the warm slippers, and stuck them out to the r fire-all without noticing Zoe's new carpet. Zoe was shaking and carrying off the cloaks, r &c., and hanging them up in the closet under the stairs. And then she came back and placed t supper on the table, and the old man turned ] around to take his seat at it. And now, when the candle was lifted off the mantelpiece, and set upon the table, and its rays fell down upon e the bright red and green carpet, the old man s exclaimed with surprise, "Why, Zoe!" "Yes, father I ain't it pretty?" said she, with t a smile.  "But-but, where did you get it, child?" "I rade it, father!" she replied, with honest exultation.                sl "You, Zoe!" exclaimed the old man, holding S his coffee-cup half way between the table and do hIis lips.                le "Yes, father; me, Ze"--playfully imitating' his tone. "But when?   Where How  What out of "                   no "When   Where  How  What outof? *One, two, three, four questions. First, when t --Through all my   leisure .time for the last imonth Where?-Up in my chamber. How?- With those powerful little magicians-needle, he thread,and scissors. What out of?-All the 'irreclaimable old clothes that have collected in the house for many years past," replied Zoe, de 'with dancing eyes, so happy in being able to in   ie prove that the fine carpet was a creation of her n own. ie  "Well done, my little housewife." le  "Oh, father, I do so love to make things," it "You do!" t-  Yes, indeed, father; but now, father, as e you have catechised me, may I not catechise r you?" "Presently, Zoe; but tell me first-for my e examination is not yet over, there are other questions to be asked, other mysteries to be n cleared up-where did you get that pretty - dress? Did you make that, too? I never saw it before." I   "No, father; I was determined to christen [ my dress and my carpet on the same day-the day of your relief from school-duties-the com- mencement of our holidays-to-day." "But you have not told me where you got it." "Oh! from Brighty. Miss Britannia O'Riley gave it to me." "Miss Britannia O'Riley gave it to you, my  dear! and why did Miss O'Riley give it to you?" asked the old schoolmaster, se- riously. "Because she loves to see me nice. Was it not right, father?" "My darling, you used sometimes to speak the truth, however unpalatable it might be to Britannia, did you not ." ' Yes, father, sometimes." "When she was sarcastic, satirical, irrev- erent, you were accustomed to keep a grave, serious face-and when she would question you on your sobriety, you would reply with truth that you disapproved of her want of veneration-were you not?" "Yes, sir." "Yes, you performed that office of friend- ship honestly; but now how would it be? Suppose, nowa in such a case what would you do?"   Could you still gravely rebuke her levity?" Zoe was silent and thoughtful. At last-- "Answer me, child!" the old man said. "  Father, no; I should think of all her kind- ness to me-" "Of her alms to you." Zoe hung her head. The old man continued- "And feel yourself a debtor and a slave in her presence." "Oh, father!" "Yes, child, you compromise, your indepen- dence, and endanger your integrity, by accept- ing any favors from those upon whom you can   have no possible claim, and whom you cannot hope to repay." "Oh, father, what can I do? I cannot give it back to Brighty, now that it is made up and has been worn; that would insult her. What can I do?"   . "Nothing that I know of, child; but you must not lay yourself under any unnecessary obligations in future. Zoe, my darling, you have-nothing but your independence and in- tegrity-keep themi. And in regard to Miss O'Riley, do not, in the least, change your man- ner towards her. Do not indulge or flatter one foible of hers, because she has made you a present." "Oh, father I Brighty would not ask me to do it. Brighty is noble, generous, frank." "But proud, satirical, and high-tempered. She is of a large and highly wrought temper- ament; full of good, and full of evil. She Needs you, Zoe, to take part with her good nature against her evil Yes, she needs you, little Zoe; do not fail her." "Father, needs me-Brighty, with so much genius, beauty, spirit i" "Yes, Brighty, with so much genius, beauty, and spirit, knows that she needs the little, humble Zoe to keep her in mind of duty. Again, I say, do not fail her." "Why, father, sometimes, when she has drawn it from me, I have repeated your lec- tures, second-hand; I never set up, I never presumed to set myself up, for Brighty's mentor." "And that is the reason, my dear, why she accepts you, because you do not presume. Brighty cannot defy a meek and lowly mentor. Do you think that if, instead of being born in the manger, Jesus had been born in the purple -if, instead of taking the form of a servant, he had assumed the insignia Dof royalty, that his lessons of reverence, of humility, of self-denial, would have been even so well received as they were? No, the pride of human nature would have rejected him." "And yet, father, human nature is given to worship all the 'pride, pomp, and circum- stance' of place, of rank, of royalty." "Yes, my dear, but not to hear from them, or to profit by lessons of humility and self- denial. Those who would teach humility with effect, must first have made themselves of 'no account ;' he who would teach self-abfiegation, must first have' offered himself a sacrifice for many ;' in a word, my dear, precept can only be effectually inculcated when the sincerity of the preceptoris demonstrated by his example.   My love, whole libraries of sermons, of philos- ophy, or of ethics, would not do me a tithe of the good effected by the reading of one chap- ter in the life of Ohrist. But to return to Brighty; you are the only one about here who can be of real service to her, and you must not indulge her faults. She herself will iiot respect you any the more for it." "Dear father, I am not a man, and therefore I am not over anxious for the cold 'respect' of those I love; but you say true about Brighty, for the other day, after she had given me this dress, she indulged her temper in bitter and pungent sarcasms levelled at Mrs. Armstrong, appealing to me frequently, and H" "Yes-well, what did you do!" Zoe was silent .; "Sitmpered, instead of looking grave, I am afraid, my dear." "Something like that, I am afraid, father." "And she?" "After her temper fit was over, and she had repented, she said to me-' Zoe, why did you let me go on so? Why did you not look at me or touch me?'-that is 'khat she said, and she looked so sorry." 1"Ah, you had not come up to her help--you had not taken sides with her good nature against'her bat. What withheld you!" "I did not like to seem to blame her, just after she had--" '  "Laid you under an obligation 1-was that it ." "Yes, sir." "I knew it, only I wanted to hear you say it. That was not gratitude-it was a mnean feeling." "Oh, father, I am not mean."     "It was a mean feeling, a spurious gratitude. Every virtue and every emotion, my love, has its base counterfeit, which deceives not only its object by hypocrisy, but oftentimes its sub. ject by self-deception. It made you betray your trust for a paltry dress." "Father, I did not mean to betray my trust, and this is not a paltry dress; it. is a nice, pretty dress: it is such a sweet, dove-colored dress; I love it. Brighty said that it just suited me, and that there was not another girl in the valley who ought to have it. But, fa- ther, I know what I will do; Mrs. Armstrong is going to give a great dinner and ball, and there are a great many handsome dresses to be made up, and Miss O'Riley engaged me to make three-one for Mrs. Armstrong, one for Miss Armstrong, and one for herself. Now, when they are completed, I will receive pay-   ment only for the first two, and when Brighty offers to pay me for hers, I will steadfastly refuse to take it." "Do so, my child-that will be right. But why did you not think of it before 8" "Because, dear father, I did want so much to buy two blankets-one for you and one for me,-and it would take the price of three dresses to buy them." "Then, darling, you will have to sacrifice that pleasure to allow for that folly," said the old man, benignly. After a silence of some minutes, Zoe said- "Now, father, I am going to put you on the defensive. Father, what made you stay out so late V You, at your time of life, keeping me so uneasy-making my heart ache-to say nothing of the johnny-cake being burned, the fish scorched, and the coffee boiled muddy?" -"My dear, perhaps you had better not have asked me-perhaps it would be better for your cheerfulness not to know-but I never keep secrets from myygirl; she shall be brave, and learn to endure; then, Zoe, two-thirds of my twelve pupils left school at the end of this term, being this evening. If I commence school again at the first of January, it will be with four young pupils-two dollars per quarter pupils. Do you think, daughter, we can live on eight dollars a quarter-that is, two dollars and sixty-six cents a month?" Oh, father!" said Zoe, looking tearfully in his face.  "Poor little thing, it is sad for you, my dar- ling!" "Oh, father, not for me-you did not think I was thinking of myself? Oh, no! I am young, I am healthy and strong, and can endure. I am young, and life may change, X but you-you!" "I am old, and have not much longer to M suffer or to enjoy, darling; therefore it is of ] little moment to me."            "But oh, father, after your faithful life- ( your life of toil, of self-denial-to find your- 1 self at seventy without a dollar beforehand I The laborer is worthy of his hire, indeed, but - the laborer has not received it," complained 1 Zoe, in a tone of deepest sadness.  "The day of settlement has not come yet, a my, love."                n "Oh, but father, to think that you should be left so."                 s "Zoe, I have lived seventy years in this world, and never suffered long either for food v or for raiment; God, who has brought me to thistime of my life, will not desert me now.   aoVm -JUn X  ; vim, ' Take no thought for the morrow,' sufficient r for the day is the evil thereof,' said the divine Master, and that mandate does not strike so t much in the light of a command as in that of loving advice-a sympathizing reassurance from warm and loving lips. Come, we will r accept it in all faith. Come, Zoe, clear 6 away the things from the table. Give me the Bible, and take your needle-work. We have a good fire-provision enough in the house to last until after New-Year. Come,; darling, we will be faithful-we will be  cheerful. The cattle upon a thousand hills' are the Lord's, and 'He knoweth that we have need of all these things."' "But, father," said Zoe, as she drew the table up before the fire to the old man's side, and set the candle, the snuffers, the big Bible, and her little work-basket upon it, "father, I do not see a ray of light." "Nor I, my dear." ; ^ "What are we to do?" "Walk by faith, not by sight. People can walk by sight, and have no need of faith when they can see light. It is in dark days alone that we can exercise faith. There, now, take up your sewing; darling." And Zoe took out her patch-work, and the old man began to read from the Bible the parable of the three sparrows sold for a farthing, neither of which should fall to the ground with the Father, and the same lesson in the Sermon on the Mount, and that Psalm of David commencing, "The Lord is my shep- herd; I shall not want." Thus the old man tried to fortify his soul against the evil days to come, He was strengthened. jie closed the Bible, and his face was very serene-was holy-was even irradiated. He fell into a profound reverie. Zoe had also fallen into a reverie, a most painful reverie. Zoe had not lived long enough, suffered deeply enough, observed carefully enough, to have taken note of God's sure providences, and so she had not the cheerful faith of her adopted father. "If this had happened in summer, it would not have been so dreadful; but in this hard, hard winter, oh, it is terrible! what will. he do? He would not, upon any account, receive assistance; no, not a dollar, not a peck of meaL" So Zoe cogitated. At last, seeing her father so silent, she thought him sad, and inquired-. "Don't you find it very lonesome, father, with nobody but me here 8" "Lonesome, darling?" "Yes, sir, I should think you would be."   "Why do you think so, Zoe 8 Is it because you feel it lonesome here, with no one but me  I should not wonder, at you, nor blame you, darling, if it were so." "Me lonesome, dear father; no, never! When you fall into a brown study, and don't want to talk, haven't I got my quilt to piece  You don't know how interesting it is, match- ing and contrasting these colors. See, for instance, what a pretty hexagon this is; the centre piece crimson, then white," said she, laying the pieces on the table. "I sometimes pity gentlemen, because they are not privileged to take the interesting, amusing, and sedative employment of needle- work." Soon after this, the old man offered up the evening prayer, and blessing his child, they separated for the night. CHAPTER XII "ORD LION, KING-AT-AR-MS." Who thundering comes on blackest steed, With slacken'd bit and hoof of speed? Beneath the clattering iron's sound The cavern'd echoes wake-around In lash for lash, and bound for bound; The foam that streaks the courser's side Seems gather'd from the ocean's tide. Byron. IT snowed all night. All night, laying awake in her bed, Zoe heard the tinkle, tinkle, of the sleet againit the window glass. It was day, but dark, when at last she fell asleep. When she awoke, the sun was shi- ning brightly into the little room. Zoe arose, dressed herself, looked out. The storm had passed-the sun had risen in splendor on the sleet-the scene was too dazzling to look upon-the whole ground sparkling with a coat of white diamond dust-the forest seemed an enchanted one-the trees formed of clear shining glass hung with millions of pendant jewels for foliage. Zoe shut her eyes quickly to save their sight, and when she opened them again black spots followed her glance all around the room. Zoe went down stairs to get breakfast. Like a careful little housewife as she was, she always kept a store of cut wood in the shed at the back of the cottage, in case of any such bad spell of weather as this. She went in there, and getting an armful, carried it into the room,   and soon had a nice warm fire. She filled her tea-kettle, and, hanging it over the blaze, began to set the table for breakfast. It was eight o'clock, and her father had not yet come down. While she was busied in mixing her johnny-cake, a sudden crashing and crackling, a sudden rush and whirr, a sudden shudder and quiver of the earth, as at the passage of a railway-train, and a gigantic rider on a huge black steed shot past, followed 'y two dogs. The vision rushed past so quickly, that Zoe had but lifted her hand from the meal and looked up, when it was gone. When she turned her head again, it was to see her old father entering the room. "Good morning, daughter!" "Good morning, dear father!" "What noise was that?" "Brutus Lion on his big black horse, Earth- quake, followed by his dogs, Thunder and Lightning." "Ah, yes! he has started a fox early this morning," observed the old man, sitting down before the fire, and beginning to draw on his boots. After breakfast, the old man, putting on his hat and taking his staff in his hand, said- "I am going over to The Crags to see the Major. He has returned from Alexandria, I hear ;" and set out. In fact, the old teacher could not stay at home; he had a childish delight in making the most of his holidays. Zoe watched him un- easily down the slippery path, went out, and watched down to the beach, until she saw him enter the boat; saw him safely cross the river, ascend the opposite bank, and disappear far up the road towards The Crags. She could see him distinctly on the brilliant snow, until his figure seemed a black speck on a distant white hill. She had watched him past the dangers -the rest of the way was safe and easy on that road; and she returned to the house to clear up the breakfast-table. She set her room' in order, went up stairg-'and made the beds, returned, took out her "interesting" quilt-piecing, and sat down to it, humming a gay air to persuade herself that she was happy. She sat there sewing for hours, stopping only to replenish her fire, to sweep up the hearth, or to caress her tortoise-shell kitten. She sat there while the sun had mounted high in the heavens, still quite absorbed in the shaping of hexagons and the matching of colors, until that crash and crackle, the rush and whirr was heard, the shudder and quiver of the ground was felt, and the huge dark rider on his gigan- 'Ik   tic black steed halted with a shock at the door, sprang heavily to the ground, and, pushing open the cottage-door, strode in, and paused before the young cottager. They were a queer contrast-the condor and the humming-bird, the elephant and the kitten, the giant and the fairy, were something like it. Brutus Lion stood six feet nine inches in his weather-proof boots. His immense chest was " backed" by shoulders of corresponding breadth, and over them hung elf locks-black, strong, and wiry -and above them reared a haughty head, with strong marked American Indian features, and Brutus Lion boasted descent from one of the red natives of the soil. His Anglo-Saxon an- cestor had been a furious and bloodthirsty republican, a regicide who had sat upon the trial of King Charles I., and who, on the ac- cession of Charles II. had escaped to Virginia, changed his name, assuming one that suited his character, taken to wife the daughter of a powerful sachem, and settled himself in a de- file of the western precipices of the Allegha- nies, to which he gave the significant name of "The Lair." The Lions of the Lair were a gigantic race, and distinguished in all the wars of the new world-in savage warfare, in the old French war,. and in the Revolutionary struggle. Between the wars, in the intervals of peace, they were, both men and women, "mighty hunters before the Lord:"Now, the sole representatives of the Lion family were the giant, Brutus Lion, and his sister, Gertrude, the "Gerfalcon." As Zoe arose to welcome her visitor, he stooped, and placing his great hands under her arms, raised her up, and stood her upon the deal table facing him, and hesaid then, and not till then- "Good morning, humming-bird:. Zoe blushed, laughed, and then blushed again., She was probably accustomed to' this sort of treatment. "Take me down." ' "I won't I or if I do, it will be to stand you upon the mantelpiece until I have done talk- ing to you; do you think, dormouse, that I can break my back in stooping to talk to you r" "Oh, you are so proud of your huge bulk; you exaggerate its necessities to make us think it still bigger; you needn't to be. l, now, whom you try to treat with contempt, I have a right to be proud of my size."  ^ "You, you grain of mustard-seed, you I Why, pray, if one may ask T' "You have hit it; just because, little as I   am, I am a grain of mustard-seed; and you, big as you are, are nothing but a rock:.  Brutus Lion was not quick-witted; he- only looked at her stupidly, while he searched for an answer. "O," laughed Zoe, "I can take the conceit out of you in no time at all, and make you admire me; or at least convince you that you ought to. Listen; every thing very precious that God has made is very small. Take the stones; first, see how very small and rare the diamonds are, and what immense piles of sand- stone there be. And the metals; how little gold, how much lead. And the flowers; how tiny the sweet violet, how tall the scentless sun-flower. And the birds; how small the skylark, who, uSinging still dost soar, and, soaring, ever singest," compared with the waddling, gabbling great goose. And the animals; how small, elegant, and fiery, the tigress, compared with the tame, servile elephant. Ah, believe me, every thing rare, costly-every thing beautiful, elegant- every thing brilliant, spicy, fiery, is small. Men put their very piquant spirits and very precious perfumery into very minute vials, they only 'put fish-oil in hogsheads. Oh, go to, you are a hogshead!" laughed the little one. The giant looked at her from head to foot,' breathed hard, rubbed mirthfulness, though quite innocent of phrenology. "Zoe, you-you-you little witch, you, I'll- I'll marry you, I'll be shot if I don't, only to pay you for this 1" "I wish to gracious you would! I wish to goodness you would! It would be fun alive to torment you to death." "You torment me, you little thing you I you small thing, you!" "Yes, my dear giant; I have seen a little  wasp drive a great ox mad by buzzing into Iis face; his highness the ox being utterly helpless in the case." "Ah-h."  "Will you put me down, now!" "Indeed I am afraid to; I am afraid I should inadvertently put my foot on you, if I were to; I never like to walk about where there are little chickens or very small women." Then he took her little head between his : large hands, and looked in her eyes as though he wanted very much to kiss them; but, respecting her loneliness, he lifted her downb and she resumed her seat and her quilt-piecing. He drew the old man's studying-chair up be- fore the fire, and, seating himself in it, said-   "Are women always sewing, Zoe f It used to be carpet-rags you were always cutting into strips, sewing into strings, and winding into balls. Now what is it? I thought, to be sure, when that was done, that there would be no more of it; now, what are you doing?" a: "Making a hexagon quilt-don't you see? It is for father's bed." And here, at the name of father, the girl sighed heavily, and fell into thought. "What is the matter, Zoe a" "Oh, about father!" "And what about him .a "The people think him too old, now, to teach, and so they take his pupils from him. If he recommences on the first of January, it will be with only four pupils. What is he to do?--what is he to do? He has worn his life out id ceaseless toil, and now, near the close of it, has not the wherewithal to smooth his passage to the grave. To think of it! The incalculable good he has done in this neighbor- hood, and the miserable reward he has got! Old soldiers and old sailors, who have resigned the more profitable pursuits of agriculture, manufactures, trade, or the learned professions, are remunerated in their old age by the justice of the power they serve; but the old school- master, who has spent his days in the most? laborious and the most anxious of all pursuits, 'what is to become of him, what is to become of father?"And the tears trickled down Zoe's cheeks. "Don't cry, Zoe, don't 1 Something must be done for him." "A hat carried around, I suppose," sneered Zoe, with unusual bitterness. "Why, Zoel what has come over you? That's not like you!" exclaimed the Colossus; "when I said that sonwething must be done for him, I meant, of course, something that would not compromise his dignity." "And what will that be? This neighbor- hood owes him a huge debt that can never be repaid. He has been the missionary, the civ- ilizer of this whole district-yes, and for the matter of debt, they owe him substantial dol- lars and cents; not more than two-thirds of his soi-disant patrons have ever paid him." "Those debts must be collected--their ag- gregate amount must be considerable." "No-he has sent in his accounts once to each. He is delicate and sensitive, and will 1 not press those who, knowing his condition, v still put him to the shame of dunning them," complained Zoe, wiping her eyes, and re- suaMng her needle.             .   Brutus Lion mused, sighed, groaned, arose and walked uneasily about the room, reared' himself up against the closed front-door, folded his arms, and watched Zoe, absorbed in her needle-work, muttered to himself, "I wish Gertrude Lion, or Zoe, one of these women, had some sense 1 I will not, however, indulge the folly of either much longer; so long as their caprice only annoyed me, I could bear it; but now that it is likely to injure Zoe, it must be corrected?"Full five minutes he contem- plated the rather pretty picture presented by Zoe at her needle-work. He resumed, speak- ing aloud-- "Study Latin nowi, Zoe?" "Yes." "And Greek?" "No. Father says one thing at a time; and I am to discontinue the Latin lessons this Christmas, and commence with the Greek this New Year's." "What time of the day, Zoe, deed your father give you lessons?" "When he comes home in the evening, he hears me recite the lesson that I have com- mitted to memory through the day."   I "And is it a great pleasure to him to teach you?" "Oh, yes, father has a passion for the 'classics; he grows eloquent in praise of the Latin, enthusiastic in eulogium of the Greek. Latin, he says, is the language of heroes, Greek the tongue of gods." "There is not," mused the young man, partly to himself, partly aloud, "much more trouble --no, there is positively less trouble and more interest in teaching a class of attentive and in- telligent pupils, than in giving instruction to one; and then how much more excitement and ambition is felt in a class, where there is rivalry,and emulation, than by a single pupil, Zoe 1" "Well!" "Wouldn't he take a class!" - Zoe looked perplexed. She did not under- stand. "Who I What class!" "I have been thinking of forming a Greek class, and getting your father to take charge of it. Miss O'Riley, Gertrude, and myself, would form, With you, a small, but rather an interesting class; don't you think'so!" Zoe had been arrested by his past words to that effect, and now she was looking at him with absorbing interest. "I say, we all want to learn Greek-Brighty, and Ger, and myself; and I say, we are all anxious to form a class, and place ourselves   under the instruction of your father. Now do you comprehend?" "I do understand you, good Brutus. I un- derstood you all the time, dear Brutus I How you, who detest books, and loath study, should contract for four or five mortal hours of close application a week, for the benevolent purpose of serving my father, without wounding his love of independence. Doift I know, dearest Brutus, how much easier it would be for you to send him five hundred dollars, and have the Greek lessons off your mind, than to put yourself to school, and pay for your lessons! God bless you, best Brutus?" Through all this earnest acknowledgment of Zoe, Brutus Lion sat there like an enormous baby receiving a chiding, with his huge frame all unnerved, quivering to dissolution like a mammoth jelly, under the infliction of Zoe's glorifications. At her conclusion he stooped, took up the tortoise-shell kitten, and began 'to caress it. Praise embarrassed Brutus. Zoe's praise overwhelmed him. Dropping the kitten, he stood up, his great eyes rolled-"I will see you again about that, Zoe," he said, in a high assumed voice, by way of proving his self-pos- session. He then rushed from the cottage, mounted his horse, and was soon out of sight. Zoe stole to the little window, and looked after him until rider and horse had vanished from sight. ( I think it will do him good to study, and that is the reason I will not interfere with the method of his benevolence," thought the little maiden; and all the while her eyes were dancing, and fitful smiles were chasing each other across her cheeks. Ah I there were too many pleasant points about this projected class-meeting, for the sobriety of Zoe. First, a relief for an indefinite period of time, from the pressure of pecuniary want upon her father. Then the employment-the interest it would afford him; and "last, not least," the certain enjoyment, for at least three days in the week, of the society of ,Brighty, and-and -but, we will not betray her. Perhaps it was the Gerfalcon, whose company she next coveted. She longed for the return of her father. "Oh I I wish he woald come home be- fore evening, so that I might tell him, and save him a day's gratuitous anxiety. Oh! how I do wish he would." But Zoe's wishing did not bring him any sooner. She plied her needle briskly, her fingers receiving a new im- ,petus from hope. At twelve o'clock she arose and made her dinner of a slice of cold johnny-   cake, and then resumed her work. When the sun was declining, she arose, put away her work, and began to prepare their little frugal supper, knowing that at least her beloved father would be home to that meal, which he never missed. Upon the strength of her new hopes, Zoe committed an extravagance-cooked a chicken, and made wheaten biscuits for sup- per. And she set the table and dressed her- self in her pretty dove-colored frock, and sat at the window, watching for the old man At last she saw him descending the hill that led from Mont Crystal. She wondered at that, having expected his approach up from the path that led from the river where he crossed every day. She surmised that he had taken The Isle of Rays, and Mont Crystal, ,on his return; and this was the fact.! The old man, with the new liberty of his holiday, had spent the day in making calls upon his present patrons or his former pupils. With his childlike faith and carelessness, the old man had forgotten anxiety for the future, in enjoyment of the present. "He had no thought for the morrow" upon this day, at -least; and now he was coming down the hill, supporting himself in the descent by holding the stick before him, and wearing the very peace of Heaven on his brow, down on either side of which the silver hair flowed upon his old brown coat. Zoe ran out to meet him, Delighted by the divine tranquillity that rested on his beautiful face, Zoe exclaimed, taking both his hands- '( "Oh 1 you have heard, then, father r' "Heard what, my child a" "Oh I you have not heard, then! I thought you had, by your looks, and I felt glad that you had been spared a day's anxiety," said Zoe, standing by the side of the old man, and draw- inrg his arm around her neck, so that it was supported upon her other shoulder. "But what is it, my child?" he asked, look- ing gently down into her eyes. U It is some good news, Zoe, I. suppose, by your glad looks." "Yes, it is some good news, and concerns yO."               42P "Some of my old pupils coming back?" "Yes, father, some of your tery old pupils coming back-you guessed it so quick-did you know it? I thought -you did, by your looking so peaceful and happy." "It was the influence of nature acting under my Father, my love. Zoe! look at that set- ting sun; it has language-eloquenCe, to me. I climbed up the other side of this hill-wea- rily, heavily-and the sun was in a cloud. I thought of'the toil by which, I had reached the   summit of my life, the top of the hill--it was very gloomy, and I looked down the descent of the hill as I contemplated the decline into the vale of years, feeling that in both progresses my only care should be to prevent myself from falling precipitately and prematurely down. ThenlI put out my stick, and began to descend cautiously. It wag very dark in the valley, so that, with my dim eyes, I could not distinguish the shade of a bush from a hole in the ground, when lo I the sun broke through the dense blue cloud; and smiled in my face! and smiled on my head I ' What could I do but lift my face and smile back, Zoe? It glowed all over this rich scene-it glowed all over me-it glowed all through me ; what could my heart do but burn within me, Zoe? It said, ' Bless you, bless you I' so softly-so brightly. What could I answer but' I am blessed! I am bless- ed!"' Zoe was walking by his side, looking up in his face with, deep reverence. "Do but observe the scene before you, Zoe," and the two children-the silver-haired man, and the raven- locked maiden-paused reverently to receive the large, full, deep benedicite of nature. It was not strange, then, that the old man's mind could not fasten on the necessities of his posi- tion, They had descended the hill, reached the cottage, and entered it, before he said- "And now, Zoe, what about new pupils?" "You are to have a class of grown-up pu- pils, if you will take charge of them.; Brutus Lion and his sister, and Brighty O'Riley, wish to come and learn Greek. Oh, father I it will be so much better than your school. They will attend you, here, so that you need not have to go out in all weathers. The plan is not quite mature yet, for they will need to consult you about the most convenient days and hours, and about the fees, &c.," said Zoe, as she helped the old man off with his overcoat. He was in deep thought. He did not reply to her until they were seated at the table. He did not observe the new luxuries of the broiled chicken and biscuits, until he had asked a blessing. Then, when stretching forth his hand to help himself to bread, he looked up smilingly to Zoe, and glanced back at the platter. "Yes, father," she said, "yes, I consider we are able to eat wheat bread, now!" "Little darling!" he said, " if we had lived byfaith, rather than by sight, we would have thought ourselves able to eat wheat bread yesterday. Little darling, it is well not to waste our daily supply; but when we have only enough, barely enough for our daily comforts, we should appropriate the, whole   to-day, and trust the Divine Providence for to-morrow. You have been growing thin and pale, Zoe, by, not taking nourishment enough. There is a slow starvation, Zoe, as well as a rapid one. You have been starving yourself from want of faith-from want of faith in your Heavenly Father-in your kind Heavenly Father, who loves you, and will take care of you all your life. Oh, Zoe! I a1m moved to tell you, my darling, always to trust God,: even unto death. Faith is worth nothing, if it does not go beyond the grave. See, Zoe I you have had enough, and barely enough, to live on for the last three months-that is, October, November, and December; but you were afraid that we should have nothing for January, February, and March, and so you denied yourself proper nutriment, and have suffered a waste of flesh, and health, and energy, which it will take some time to repair. If you had had faith, Zoe, you would have been in a better condition now. But no, darling, you said to yourself, 'It is ;true that we have enough for this autumn, and only enough; but if I do not pinch thi, fall, we may perish with want next winter.' Did you not, Zoe?" "Yes, father, I forgot that ' sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,' but I remember that poor people do sometimes perish by want." "Never, darling I no one ever perishes by want, or any other agent. They pass hence, who can conceive to what comfort-to what joy I Go on, calmly, Zoe; 'take no thought for the morrow;' trust God through every thing, through all things, even through the prospective horrors of a death from starvation, believing even that to be a dark passage to a bright world. Life is made up of moments. Eternity is made up of moments. Be inno- cently happy with all the means and appli- ances God has given you in the present, and trust him with your future. There is no danger that he will forget you. He ' knoweth that you have need of these things.' Do not stint yourself, Zoe," continued the old man, elocutionizing his words by helping himself to a whole side of the chicken; "do not stint yourself, Zoe. It was not until the multitude had eaten and were filled, that the fragments were gathered up. The de- pendence, the faith, the wisdom of little children, are often held up to our view by the Divine Master. The parents of a little child give it just enough for one meal. It is satisfied, happy, consumes the whole without J,   fear of wanting another. But what would you think of the child, who, when its mother had given it a piece of bread, just enough to satisfy hunger for the time being, should deny himself, and, putting aside half of it, should say,' I shall be hungry again, and I am not sure my mother will give me bread. Would it not be monstrous-revolting I Well, just as monstrous, just as revolting, is our ha- bitual manifestation of distrust of our Divine Parent. I am'not counselling' you against economy, but for economy-in this; for was it not bad economy, dear child, to have con- sumed your flesh and saved your means? Is it not bad economy for a man- to devote himself so exclusively to business as to waste health and strength, for the sake of saving time and making money? Great; labor, great parsimony, are not either of them economy. The proper limitations of getting and keeping, are your own necessities, and the rights of others. For instance, a man,} in overworking himself, frequently both injures his own health and deprives some one else of a share of labor necessary to his support. In saving, a man too often hoards away that which is absolutely necessary to the preser- vation of his own healthi and strength, or his neighbor's life. That is not right. Self- preservation is the first law of nature, and should be obeyed. Next, the superfluous coat or cloak should be given to him that has none. But you are not drinking your coffee, Zoe; drink your coffee, child;" and the old man, enforcing precept by example, addressed himself to his supper, and did not speak again until near its conclusion, when he said- "Yes, I am glad; I am thankful for this light arising out of darkness, though I knew before it dawned that the Lord would not forget his old servant. Yes, I like it I It will be pleasant to teach Greek to intelligent and appreciating pupils. It will be pleasant to be able to remain at home and receive the young people by my own fireside I Yes, it is all pleasant!" and the old man arose from the table, and settled himself in his large arm- chair for the whole evening. Zoe cleared away the tea-things from the table, drew it up to the fire, and, seating herself on the opposite side, drew out a half- finished purse, and began to knit on it. -The old man was less abstracted than usual- "What is it thee's doing, Zoe?" he- said. He was from Pennsylvania originally, and whenever his mood was peculiarly tender he fell into his Quaker dialect.   "What is it thee's doing, Zoe?" "Knitting a purse,- dear father." "A Christmas offering, darling?" "Yes, father." "Dear child I I know who it is for," ex- claimed the old man, looking in her face with so much benevolent affection, but so expressive of. "it is for her old father," that the rose- clouds rolled up over Zoe's face. He smiled at her embarrassment. She could not bear to deceive him. "Dear father!" she said, "I have got some- thing for you, something nice, something better than this, but this is for-for-for Brutus." A pause, a deep silence, ensued. Zoe was silent from embarrassment-the old man ap- parently from deep thought. At last he said, "Come hith--, Zoe!" and she came. . "Sit on my knee, Zoe;" and she sat. He' drew her arms around his neck, and, taking her face between his venerable palms, held it, looking into her eyes- "Does thee love Brutus Lion, Zoe?" Her eyes fell, her cheeks crimsoned-she remained silent-he steadily, lovingly, gazing on her. "Does thee, Zoe?" She with her deep veneration forced herself to reply- "Father, on my souPs honor I do not know . I know the full depth of meaning in your ques- tion, and would not treat it with levity or evasion, but--I do not know." "Does he love you?" "Yes, sir." "How do you know?" "He has told me so many, many times." "When?" "OhI often; I could not tell you how often." "He was here this morning?" "Yes, sir." "Did he tell you he loved you this morn- ing?" "Yes, sir," replied Zoe, the blood burning in her cheek as though it would take fire. "What did he say, Zoe," asked the old man, caressingly. Zoe started, mused, grew pale, then flushed to her very brow. "What did he say, Zoe!" persisted the old man, stroking her hair. "Father, he said--nothing r' The old man looked gravely in her face. "What do you mean, my darling T" Zoe was covered with confusion, she bowed   her face in his sheltering bosom, and he felt the tears on his neck. "Zoe!" "Father 1" "Tell me what is the matter, my darling." But Zoe seemed overwhelmed with humilia- tion. She could not raise her head, or look him in the face. He lifted up her head, and kissed her on the brow. She drew a long breath, dashed away the tears, and, looking at him long and earnestly in the face, said- "Father, I would not deceive you wilfully -would I T" "No, my darling child." "Thank you for saying that, dear father l Yet, father, I have unwittingly deceived you, because I first deceived myself. You dispelled the illusion by asking me ' what did he say?' " "I understand it all, my child. The love- tuned voice, the love-beaming eye, speak. a language stronger, more eloquent, more con- vincing, than words-and maidens receive it in all faith. And many an honest and honorable man will hold himself guiltless of the wounded heart that these only have won. But, Zoe, you are thoroughly convinced that Brutus loves you, and you are not sure whether you return his affection. How is that, Zoe?" "Dear father, I do not love to talk of it." "Your heart folds its leaves like the sensitive plant, even at your father's touch, dear Zoe. Zoe I why can you not unbosom yourself to me? You think me old and cold. Ah, Zoe, the heart that has not done or suffered great wrong is never old or cold. Child I my hair is white as snow, you bee, my cheeks are withered and fallen, and my eyes are sunken and very dim-yet, Zoe, under this shrivelled bosomh is a fresh, young heart, and shrined in that heart is an image, which is also a fountain that keeps it green-the image of a dear girl I loved in youth, Zoe, and have loved all my life. She went to Heaven, child, but has not even there forgotten me. She ministers to me often; she communes with me always. If I were to attempt to prove this to you, Zoe, you would think the old man fanciful. I reveal this to give you courage to give me your con- fidence, Zoe; that you may not think youth and old age, white hair and black, separate hearts too far for sympathy. Now, then, Zoe, tell me-I have a motive for asking you- how do you feel towards this man ]" "Father, I think of him as of no one else. He seems separated and set apart from all the rest of the world. Every face and form, however beautiful, elegant, graceful, it may   be, seems to me common, vulgar, by the side of him." "Yet, Zoe, he is not beautiful, elegant, or graceful "t  "I am not a coward or a fool, am I father? yet when he comes into the room-" "Well?" She sank her voice to its lowest tones, and murmured- "I tremble all over; and sometimes talk nonsense, without knowing what words I am using." "And sometimes, Zoe, you laugh and talk with him cheerfully and sensibly enough." "Yes, sir! but, father 1 that is when he chooses to be gay; but if, in the midst of that gayety, he suddenly stops, and only looks me in the face, I fall into gravity, life becomes very se- rious, very solemn, very real to me. Mirth seems mockery, laughter seems levity. No other man's eye affects my soul so, father." "This is a very painful influence, is it, Zoe!" "Oh, no, father! It-is deep, sweet, solemn, like a church chant." "Zoe!" "Well, father." "You love Brutus Lion, and you can never become his wife." "Father!" - "Never, Zoe." "But I did not expect, I did not hope to; I am sure f did not." "He is of an old and haughty family-you, Zoe, are a foundling." "I know it," murmured the maiden. "Yet you, in --your secret heart, hoped that this might be overcome; that he might stoop to lift you to his level-on your truth, did you not '"                  6 Zoe bowed her head lowly, sadly. "He is wealthy, you are penniless; but you thought never of this as an objection, but be- lieved that his superfluities might supply your deficiencies. Ha, child?" Again she bowed her head, slowly, lowly. "All this might happen, Zoe-the patrician might stoop to the plebeian; the millionaire to  the beggar. Brutus Lion might offer his hand and name in marriage to Zoe, yet Zoe can never be the wife of Brutus Lion--" "Father!" ,l It is true." "Father!" "It is fixed, inevitable, irrevocable." "Oh! father." "Zoe P' said the old man, rebulkingly, "has he ever asked you to be his, wife f'   "No, father," eaid she, speaking with more spirit than usual, as if in defence of one whose honor she felt was in some way implicated in this conversation; " no, father, but he will. He loves me, father, although he never has said so in set terms. What indeed would be the use of set terms between us two? I deceived myself only in thinking that he ever said so, not in the fact itself; and, father, I honor him. I believe in him, if I believe in any person or thing in heaven or on earth. But, how am I talking I oh I dear father I how am I talking! It is so strange, is it -not, for me to be talking so 1 But you draw every thing out of me, father. Well! go on." "You love Brutus Lion; he loves you. He will offer you his hand; you will accept it. Yet you will never be his wife." "Father-will you object to it V" "My child-yes." "Again, father-why 1" "An insurmountable obstacle to your union exists, my dear," said the old, man with the tears dimming his eyes." "'Father," said Zoe, in a suffocating voice, "father, I am a foundling, as you say--do you know Qr guess-that I am of-of-very near kin to brutus!" "You are no kin to him, Zoe; but it is not less certain that you can never, never be his wife."  CHAPTER XIII. L BRITANNIA.  Around her playful lips do glitter  N Heat-lightnings of a girlish scorn; 9 Harmless they are, for nothing bitter t In that dear heart was ever born. 1 That merry heart, that cannot lie Within its warm nest quietly, But ever, from the full, dark eye,  a Is looking kindly night and morn. f Wilhs.  E "THS lady's arrogance grows intolerable, a insupportable, insufferable!" exclaimed Britan- a nia O'Riley, flinging open her chamber-door, ii entering hastily, and walking up and down s the floor in excitement.          1 It was after some such scene as that of the 1 drawing-room, described in a former chapter. T "She treats me with more hauteur than she s( shows the lowest of her slaves, for the simple ft reason that she thinks it impossible one of s them should presume on her clemency, and  s   she fears it is quite possible I might! I can- not endure it I this slow, cold, snow-fall of pet- rifying pride, congealing as it descends. I wonder it does not dampen and chill me! I wonder it does not freeze me into apathy-into death! Or I should wonder, if I did not rec- ollect that the avalanche of ice and snow heaped on Vesuvius's summit does not quench the fire in its bosom, does not prevent it break- ing out into a blaze, and burying a city or a province in its lava I  I am on the eve of an irruption, and Herculaneum (which is Mrs. Armstrong) does not know it. Yes; Mrs. Armstrong kindles the fire in my bosom, fans it to flame, and I tremble on the verge of an explosion every moment. I shall blow out soon; I know-I feel I -shall; and then how the hot fire of my anger will fuse, scorch up, and annihilate this lady's pride." Brighty's strong melo-dramatic mood- was foaming up; effervescing into comedy already. Her good humor was returning. "After all, I would not mind it if I could, entirely keep my temper. It is unpleasant to remember that I have said sharp, sarcastic things to a lady of her age and standing -and she is a lady, with all her grave faults; and grave faults they are, capable, I sometimes think, of leading to great crimes." She paused and turned around, facing a pic- ture that attracted, magnetized her. It was Cordelia, with her fair brow, serious eyes, and sweet lips. She gazed deep down into the face, spell-bound. "There is a filial piety free from the super- stition, the morbid excess, that characterizes that of our Louise. Cordelia could live, labor, or die, for her father, but could not flatter one 'wealkness of the old king. I wish I had your meekness, Cordelia, as well as your frankness; then I should be able to bear this lady's haughtiness better than I do. "I go to church Sunday morning, and I hear a good sermon, and I come home thoughtful, fully determined to conquer my own spirit, to get a victory over my besetting sin. Well, I am gentle all day. At night, lying awake, I act over all the scenes in which Mrs. Armstrong ism certainly to play the -supercilious-I, (pos- sibly,) to play the meek and lowly in spirit. Very well. Monday, I keep guard on myself. Tuesday, I grow tired of the sentinelship. Wednesday, Mrs. Armstrong' does or says something offensive to me. I am on fire; I forget imeekness; I only remember courage, spirit, heroism, and I give her, in return, a small hint of what I may, and, I am afraid, I.    \   shall give her one of these days, if I do not grow in grace faster than I am growing. I would there were preaching three times a week. I cannot remember to be good from one Sunday to another. 'Or I wish, oh, how I wish, some middle-aged preacher had married me when I was fifteen. I am afraid a preacher would have a terrible home with me now I And yet this is a poor way to pass life. Even suppose I shall live to be threescore and ten. I have passed one-tlird of that time, and what have I done for God, for my neighbor, or even for myself8 Nothing I  I wish I could be sure that I had been of any real service to Louise in teaching her to read bad French and worse Italian. But I know that I have not. Here I am, lingering on, because the elegant luxury of this establishment pleases me; because I can enjoy it as if it were my own. I wish I were not so enslaved by this love of ease and elegance. I would go somewhere where I would be of use. How I admire the self-resig- nation, the ascetic self-denial of the Sisters of Charity. Ah me!  I love Cordelia's meekness, and can't be meek. I admire Sister Mary's or Sister Martha's self-devotion, but I can't be self- devoted. . A bundle of fine sentiments have I,  instead of good principles. How long is this 1 life to last? It cannot last long; at least, this  Mont Crystal chapter, for Louise is nearly  1 sixteen, and I think her mother will not want my services much longer. And then where?   E Ah I that strikes me pleasantly; fancy is free to roam all over the earth for another home. V 'The world is all before me, where to choose.' r The uncertainty is pleasant. Shall I next r live in a hilly country or a level one?--in the I interior or on the seashore ] Shall I go north, \ south, east, or west? At any rawt, what new n faces, what new  landscapes, shall I see? ii Yes, this vagrant, respectably vagrant life, is e vastly agreeable. So agreeable, that I wish to redeem it by great utility. Yes,' my lines are cast in pleasant places;' this is a free, care- less life enough. The vagueness of the future is piquant; truly I would not iresign the gay liberty of my present life; nothing would tempt me to resign it but the prospect-no, the certainty of taking the head of some splendid palace as its mistress. Truly there is something of the gipsy in my'disposition; I PR am a blending of the empress and the Zingaro. Ah, I have it. It is known that the west of Ireland, from whence I come, was settled by a ch colony of Spaniards, ages ago. Now, I know su that I am descended by many generations from one of the old sovereigns of the soil and a al   )t Zingaro emigrant, or squatter, and hence comes I my love of elegant palace-houses, and also the k. wandering liberty of wild nature. No, nothing y would tempt me to leave this pleasant, gov- e ernessing life, with its piquant varieties, and I uncertainties, and unexpected crises, except d the invitation to take the head of just such a t splendid palace as that upon the Isle of Rays. e Mont Crystal is a magnificent place, but the ePalace of the Isle is something to go crazy about. e And now I wonder why I am always dream- r ing of that Island Palace. I never dream of , its inmates. Surely I have 'no half-formed e matrimonial design on Louis Stuart-Gordon, a the boy heir of the Island Estate. I am only a a poor governess, without an eagle left in my purmse, yet I should not accept the hand of I Louis Stuart-Gordon, 'were the honor tendered me to-day.  I would not take the Island Estate, with that encumbrance, delicate and elegant as he is, or rather, because of his ele- gance and delicacy. I have elegance and deli- cacy enough myself for two people, and con- sequently, he who marries me, must be rough enough to make strength supposable, or I'll none of him. 'Therefore,-I am innocent of all covert designs on Louis Stuart-Gordon. Now, then, why is it, that whenever I call up images of my possible future homes, no picture but. that of the Isle of Rays, rises at my summons? Ah, now I now the reason. It is an epidemic, among all the, marriageable girls of the Valley, for a hundred miles around, and I have invol- untarily caught the infection; that is itl I must get well. AhlI there is Kate Jumper passing into Mrs. Armstrong's chamber; a privy council to be held there; I wonder upon, what subject. Happily, it is none of my busi- ness." And Brighty began to make her even- ing toilet, and was soon absorbed in the inter- esting occupation. CHAPTER XIV. -KATE JUMPEB. You shall find her the infernal Ate in strange ap- parel. I wish some scholar would conjure her, Much Jdo Sbout J'othing. "ET us accompany "Kate Jumper" into the chamber of her mistress, whither she had been summoned. There was something sinister, appalling, almost spectral, about the look of this woman.   She was a mulatto of the tallest altitude, in whose face the negro features were-not only decided, but grossly exaggerated. The low, receding forehead was lower and more re- ceding; the nose larger, flatter, broader; the lips thicker, and more protruding even, than usual. Her goblin-like appearance was en- hanced by a head of hair, never cut, that grew out an immense black .bush all over her head; by her dress of dusty, black stuff, and by the man's hat that habitually surmounted the black bush. Kate Jumper was the loathing of all the neighborhood, and the terror of all the children. She had been the confidential at- tendant of Mrs. Armstrong in her early youth, and ever since her marriage she filled that im- portant post. She had been the nurse, and now also acted as the maid of the young girl of whom her mother took too jealous care to intrust her in the hands of another servant. Doffing her hat and setting it down at the door, Kate Jumper entered the chamber of her mistress, whom she found at her evening toilet, Louise, as usual, sitting on a low chair near her. "My daughter, go and sit with your govern- ess until she is ready," said the lady, on seeing her maid enter. Louise arose, lifted the hand of, her mother respectfully to her lips, and left the room. The lady brought her attendant 'to her side by a gesture. Resigning the arrangement of her gold-colored Irish gauze turban into the hands of her maid, she continued some time in silence. At length she inquired, with seeming indifference- "Do you know where young Stuart-Gordon is, and what he is about, just now?" "He is still at home, at the Isle, madam." "Ah I I had not seen or heard of him lately, and fancied that he had left the neighborhood. How does lie amuse himself at the present time!" "They say that he is going to see Miss Som- erville." "How 1" exclaimed the lady, turning around so suddenly and sharply as to throw into chaos the elegant folds of the head-dress under Kate Jumper's hands. But quickly recovering her composure and dignity, she inquired quietly- "They say so I Who say so!" ' It is the common report of the whole neigh- borhood, madam. Every one says that it will be a match" "And upon what grounds do they, everybody, assert such impossibilities, such absurdities?" "Madam, Mr. Stuart-Gordon spends every   forenoon at The Crags; Miss Susan Somerville comes every evening to make tea at the Isle." "How long has this gone on?" "For the last two weeks, madam." "And Mr. Stuart-Gordon has spent every forenoon, for the last two weeks, at The Crags ]" "Yes, madam." "And Miss Somerville has come over, every evening, to tea at the Isle?" "Yes, Madam." "Inexplicable! And no lady-no matron-- to countenance her visits?" "No, madam." "Disgraceful! What do you mean to say that she made these visits alone!" "Not alone, madam; Harriet, her house- keeper, attended her." "No proper attendant on such an occasion; and, indeed, no proper attendant could have been found, the visit itself being highly im- proper. How is the General supposed to look& upon this strange proceeding?" "He is very fond of Miss Susan Somerville." "He offers no impediment to this proposed marriage?" "No, madam."         * "You may go." Kate Jumper left the room, and the lady fell into profound thought. Mrs. Armstrong was no vulgar, maneuvring match-maker, yet she had silently and naturally betrothed Louise to Louis, from her very cra- dle, and there seemed every sort of propriety in such a betrothal; the fitness of relative age, rank, wealth, proximity of estates, &c. And there were many strange coincidences in their circumstances. Both were only children, both were sole heirs; both were born on the same day of the same month-the maiden being just two years younger than the youth. The coinci. dence extended even to their names--Louis and Louise. They were devoted to each other as children. Their birthdays were celebrated to- gether. One year, the festivities would be held at Mont Crystal; the next year at the Isle. The parents of these children would have thought it almost sin if they had supposed that, in after life, either would have thought of wed- ding any but the other; but, though the thought of the future 'marriage of these children and these estates was ever in the hearts, it was never on the tongues of the parents, the practice of betrothing children in their cradles never having existed in Virginia, aristocratic and con- servative as that patrician State is known to be. This is not saying, however, that in Vir- ginia lands are not more frequently married   than hearts, and that love-matches are not held in especial contempt--" love being a sentiment that Thomas, the coachman, feels for Betty, the housemaid, and which generally ends in con- verting the said Thomas from a genteel servant into a slovenly brute, and Betty from a neat- handed Abigail to a haggard slattern, beaten by a drunken husband, and dragged at by ten squalling children." Love is not a gentlemanly or a lady-like propensity. Southern aristocrats, however, leave this to the instinct of nobility supposed to be resident in th bosoms of their young patricians, and, therefore, would never think it necessary to take advantage of the non- age of their children, to bind them by such contracts if they could. Least of all, would Mrs; Armstrong, withheld by a sentiment of pride--or the Stuart-Gordons, restrained by principle-least of all would they have affianced their children in infancy. Still it was in the minds of both. The-annual celebration of the birthdays was kept up, and a competition of splendor, as to who should distinguish the day with greatest magnificence, interested the fam- ilies of Mont Crystal and of The Isle'of Rays? The very last celebration of the birthdays was held at The Isle of Rays, gentle Margaret Stuart-Gordon presiding over the festival. This was just a month before her sudden death overwhelmed her bereaved family with sorrow, the whole neighborhood with gloom. We have seen that Mrs. Armstrong possessed  one master passion, rRIDE; one predominant affection, MATERNAL LOVE. The sovereignty of i her soul was a di-umvirate, and the two pow- t ers that divided it were equally potent, and for f a long time united, pride being firmly wedded to, and highly flattered by, the favored object s of her maternal affection. But, as Louise ap- I proached womanhood, these passions began to a conflict, thus-              a The time was slowly but surely approaching d when it would be proper for the heiress of o Mont Crystal to be married. Her pride was c interested in seeing her married, and establish- ed as the mistress of the most magnificent h mansion and the greatest estate in the valley, .a and pride, enlisting policy on her side, would a suffer no delay, run no risk of the loss of this d desideratum. But her maternal love, if the S ferce, selfish, and exacting passion deserved tc the name, rebelled against this decision. Pride cl would have been highly gratified by seeing la Miss Armstrong, as Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, mis- tress of the Island Palace. Maternal love was te grieved at the anticipation that her daughter p( should become the wife -of Louis, maternal in   d jealousy aroused by the thought that Louise t should derive the happiness of her life from e any other than herself. It is true, the mother - coveted for her daughter no happiness that did t not flow through herself. It is true, the thought - of seeing Louise in another home, united to i another-a more genial, a more beloved, a life- I long companion-of seeing her' surrounded by an infant family, which with her husband should occupy the largest share of her thoughts and affections--of feeling herself the mother of one only child, becoming of less and less importance to the happiness of that child, as year by year went by and aged her-this thought inflicted upon her selfish heart the sharpest pang it was capable of feeling. Could she have conquered pride, resign the thought of establishing Miss Armstrong, and even selfishy defermine to in- dulge her maternal jealousy, and keep her daughter for ever unwedded and at home-or, could she have subdued her maternal jealousy, and gratified pride by seeing Louise at the summit of her ambition-in a word, could one or the other of her evil passions have obtained the mastery of her soul, she would have been a less tortured woman. Hell is the less intoler- able for having but one sovereign. If it be the consummation of all horrors to our conceptions now, what would it be in civil war a Mrs. Armstrong could not or would not put ,an end to'the civil disturbance; it was not yet civil war in her own Soul. Not from indecision -no one had a stronger will when she pleased to exert it-but from a selfish, grasping wish to derive the greatest amount of gratification from both her ruling propensities. She was resolved that ultimately Miss Arm- strong should become mistress of The Isle of Rays; yet, as her daughter's proposed husband approached manhood, she conceived a strong and growing aversion to him, as the person destined to divide with her her place in her only child's heart, her influence over her only child's life. Her manner had grown cold to Louis. She had discouraged the intimacy of the children, ,and the estrangement increased with years, and was interrupted only by the annual birth- day festivities. Since the death of Margaret Stuart-Gordon, the estrangement had become total-a dead silence fell between the once closely connected families, a silence broken at last by the strange rumor of Louis-- "Fools!" silently sneered the lady, as her at- tendant retired; "Fools I Do they really sup- pose that General Stuart-Gordon for a single instant contemplates the possibility of his only   son, Louis, the sole heir of the great Island Estate, marrying a penniless girl, an upeduca- ted rustic, like Susan Somerville? Little would General Stuart-Gordon feel flattered by the construction placed by the neighborhood upon his politeness to Miss Somerville, and that, by the way, should be a lesson for such mistaken civility and indiscriminate association. No; there is not in all the mountains a proper bride for Louis Stuart-Gordon, save one-my daugh- ter, Louise Armstrong; no eligible match for the heir of the Island Estate, except one-' the heiress of Mont Crystals I had supposed there was time enough"-, and a shadow fell, softening the hard brow. "I had supposed that there was time enough-that Louis need- ed not for some years to come think of matri- mony, since he will not be eighteen until the 22d of next February, when my daughter will have completed her fifteenth year. But it seems that, since the death of Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, the Island palace is supposed to need a mistress, that General Stuart-Gordon has expressed a strong desire that his son should marry early, and give it one. Louis is very young, too young.  General Stuart-Gordon's tastes are strictly domestic. He wants a home, and thinks that, in his regal palace, he cannot have one without a woman. Bad I foolish If Louis does not make a choice soon, he will-he will --he does not think so, but I know it. He thinks now only of eternal fidelity to that ' as- cended saint,' as he calls his deceased wife, but already he has ceased to groan and sigh after his saint in heaven, and begins to feel that he is still on earth, with all earth's wants pressing upon him. He will be mad enough to think of a second marriage. I wish Mrs. Stuart-Gordon had not thought proper to die-her death has disturbed the economy of my plans very much. The late Mrs. Stuart-Gordon was a lady, and it really does not suit me to see an inferior take her place as the head of an establishment my daughter is one day to enter as a bride. She might be one with whom I could not associate; she might be young, and so keep Louise half her life in a subordinate position in the house- hold. I could not endure that I Miss Arm- strong when she enters that house Mrs. Stuart- Gordon, must take the head of the establish- ment. But I am not disposed soon to part with my only daughter; yet, a crisis approaches- one of three things is likely to happen: Gen- eral Stuart-Gordon may marry-that is the first contingency; or press Louis to make choice of a wife-that is the second; or Louis may have conceived a boyish passion for Su-   san Somerville or some other equally ineligible girl, and all girls are ineligible in my estima- tion, except one young lady. Louis had a decided preference for Louise. I have es- tranged them lately, since the decease of Mrs. Stuart-Gordon; Well! I do not regret it--I would not cheapen my daughter-nevertheless, now is the time to change deportment. Mrs. Stuart-Gordon has been dead eight months. It is to be presumed that the first violent effects of grief have passed away; that the be- reaved are willing now to be amused. The doors of Mont Crystal have been closed to fes- tivities since the decease of the lady of the Island Palace, out of compliment to the Island family. The portals of Mont Crystal must now be thrown open to visitors from the Isle. The palace doors of the Isle must swing apart, to give entrance to the ladies of Mont Crystal, when they shall occasionally make a call. The friendly, the intimate association of the families must be resumed. Now is the favorable time to commence. Christmas approaches. Christ- mas festivity shall again enliven Mont Crystal. I will invite a Christmas party to the house- give a ball and dinner. For once; I will invite the Somervilles. I wish to observe for myself the terms upon which these two young people appear to be. Yes, I will gather all the young people of the neighborhood, many of whom I have not seen since they reached womanhood, and I will take note of any possible rival my daughter may have-but, what do I say? Louise Hector Armstrong must have no rivalry, must enter into no competition;" and, rising, the lady entered her private sitting-room, and, ring- ing the bell, sent the servant who answered to re- quest the immediate attendance of Miss O'Riley. Brighty entered three minutes afterwards. "Sit down, Miss O'Riley.  I have been planning some amusements for my daughter." Britannia looked interested. "In accordance with your advice, Miss O'Riley." Britannia bowed in acknowledgment of the compliment, and silently awaited further com- munication. "I shall invite General and Mr. Stuart- Gordon, Major and Miss Somerville, to spend Christmas week at Mont Crystal." Britannia smiled to herself when she heard  General Stuart-Gordon's name, and started with surprise as that of the interdicted Susan i Somerville met her ear. I  "As our party will be a Christmas one, it is a not strictly necessary that we be exclusive.  All may unbend a little at Christmas."   "Certainly," assented Miss O'Riley. "During iheir stay, I shall give a dinner and ball, and it is in relation to that, more particu- larly, that I have requested your presence. Will you have the goodness to sit down at my writing-table, and make out, at my dictation, a list of guests to be invited." "With great pleasure, madam," said Bri- tannia, taking the indicated seat, and, dipping her pen in, ink and laying a sheet of paper before her, she held herself in readiness for the task. A list of about thirty names was made out, and Britannia absolutely dropped her pen and stared in astonishment when the thirty-first name given was- Gertrude Lion, and thirty- second, Zoe Dove. What does Mrs. Armstrong mean? Was she converted? Was she going to die? "You look shocked, Miss O'Riley, and I am glad to see that you do. I had feared that you favored those young ladies to a degree that I sliould disapprove in Miss Armstrong's govern- ess. I am glad to see that the idea of invi- ting them to Mont Crystal displeases you." "No " said Brighty, "surprises me. I had not expected--" "Such a proceeding on my part. Perhaps not. Yet, as my contemplated party is Xo be quite a large one, it is not obliged to be very select, There will be several guests at the ball that I would not upon any account invite to Mont Crystal upon any other occasion, and these young ladies are among the number. Yet they are of thoroughly respectable pa- rentage, whatever' they may be in other respects. Nevertheless, Miss O'Riley, I shall ,expect you to keep your pupil separate and at a distance from these persons." Britannia bowed coolly, and presently asked- "May I inquire, Mrs. Armstrong, if there be any thing affecting the moral character of these young women a" "Assuredly got, Miss O'Riley. My inviting them to Mont Crystal-at any and under any circumstances should be a sufficient guarantee that they are stainless, unimpeachable. Why do you ask such an irrelevant, such a singular, I had nearly said such an impertinent, ques- tion 1" "I could not conjecture the reason why you dread the contagon of their proximity so much, unless there were some pestilential moral malaria evolved from them," said Brighty, with assumed naveth. "They-,at least Miss Lion is eccentric.-has 4   been distinguished by a sobriquet. Zoe, though sufficiently refined and intelligent, of course has no claims of equality-and the order of rank is to be observed, Miss O'Riley." Here such a decided curl twisted the pretty upper lip of Brighty, that Mrs. Armstrong observing it, said, haughtily- "At least, Miss O'Riley, Miss Armstrong's mother disapproves of the acquaintance, and has undoubtedly a right to object to certain associations for her daughter." "Most certainly," assented Britannia, and gave her attention to her work. When  the list of about a hundred names was complete- "Now, Miss O'Riley, will you oblige me by writing cards of invitation addressed to each name of your list?" Miss O'Riley bowed compliance, and the lady, rising, withdrew to have a consultation' with her housekeeper. A Christmas party at Mont Crystal I This was something new under the sun I It disturb- ed somewhat the majestic solemnity habitually reigning at Mont Crystal. Mrs. Armstrong was engaged; Brighty excited; even the pale, wan, spiritual Louise became childishy inter- ested in the new dresses selected for her for the occasion-dresses that were to be made long, as ladies wore them-the first dresses that she had ever had made so. Her pale, gold hair was to be combed out of curl, trained up around a comb, and dressed with sapphires; the plain gold hoops in her ears were to give. place to sapphire ear-rings; these things had! been sent for; and in short, Louise understood}( that "Miss Armstrong" was about to "come- out" at the ensuing Christmas. That was: another subject of excitement among the house-  hold, who, from Kate Jumper, the prime-min- ister, down to the tiny mulatto-boy, whosel office it was to wait on the governess--some" from  affection, some from mere love, of any circumstance that might vary the monotony of their lives, took a lively interest in all affairs of the family. All were busy, all were happy. The only clouded brow was that of Mrs. Arm- 'strong, who walked majestically through her: superb rooms, giving orders with the air of an undertaker directing a funeral. Her occasional appearance in the still-room, (the room set apart for preserving, pickling; distilling, &c., is thus called in -old Virginian mansions,) cast a damper on the spirits of the-housekeeper and her assistants, who were engaged there in pre- paring confectionery for the coming festival A Christmas .party in a Virginian, planter's   house  Do you know what that is, reader? I advise those who do not, to set out imme- diately to the Valley-this is the proper sea- son-and get their limbs dislocated on the de- testable roads-the turnpikes are now in a proper trim for such catastrophes-and get picked up and carrield into -some planter's house, for the sake of being a cherished guest in the coming Christmas holidays, and to have an opportunity of getting over their preju- dices against Virginian aristocracy. You who have never visited Virginia, (a Summer trip to the White Sulphur Springs is not visiting Virginia, to know- it, any more than a trip to Nahant is making a Southerner aufait to the character and habits of New England)-you who have never visited Virginia, have no con- ception of what Virginian hospitality is. It re-- minds one of the feudal ages, when the ox was roasted entire, whole pipes of ale broached, (I beg pardon of total abstinence,) and the baron's gates- thrown open to all comers-when hos- pitality, with a flag of truce, arrested for a time all neighborhood feuds. You, who live in cities, and sneer at Old Virginia and F. F. V's, (all are not F F. V's who pretend to be so,) have no conception of what a Virginian planter's family at home is. You, who provide your families from market-stalls, grocery stores, confectioners, and so forth, have no idea of what a real Virginian housewife of the first class is-of what Virginian housekeeping, Vir- ginian cellars, larders, and -still-rooms are. Their hams, smoked beef, &c., are quite differ- ent articles from those you buy in stores: and their milk, cream, and butter-and their -poul- try and eggs-are such as you Seldom  see in, market. Virginian matrons have an old-fash- ioned pride in their housekeeping. Why, they have been preparing for Christmas for weeks past I And such stores as they have to prepare froml   There is little to be bought-every thing is at hand. The still-room closets furnish the dried fruits, the preserves, the jellies, and even the domestic cordials, wines, and essences -it is for the preparation of these things that the still-room has been set apart. The dairy supplies butter, milk, and cream; the domes- tic hen-house gives the eggs, large and fresh, the poultry-yard supplies the turkeys, geese, and ducks-they have been fattening for a month past. Then in the meat-house, the great Christmas round of beef has been down in spices for weeks, and the huge Christmas ham is already-cured, and the Christmas pies are in fine order. There will be great doings in Virginian country-houaes this blessed Christ- i   mas. There will be huge bowls of egg-nog brewed before breakfast, and every negro on the plantations will come up to wish a merry Christmas, and to get his glass of brandy, and will come to breakfast with something ex- tremely extra. And then the family will go to church in the old family carriage, and per- haps bring the preacher, if he is a single man, home to dinner. The afternoon will be spent in jollity, and the evening will close with a dancing-party. They are great dancers in the country, with an old negro officiating, as a fid-- dler-for even a first family cannot at all times command a band of music, if they are resident away up in the mountains, or hidden in remote valleys. So it will be some "old Uncle Ned," or " old Uncle Ben," who " play the -fiddle for the ladies." By the way, you could not go into a Maryland or Virginian neighbor- hood, where there was not some fiddling Old Nick or old Harry, who was the musical won- der of his small world-a perfect Paganini in ebony-and whose services were always in great demand on merry-making occasions. You would be surprised at the musical genius of some of these old negroes. There, Christ- mas week is the slave's Saturnalia. Those who have been hired out, come home: their year is out on Christmas Eve, and all have a holiday, until the 2d of January; that is, all except a few that are needed about the house, and even they take turns in going out. We digress. . Let us return. There will be great doings at all Maryland and Virginian country-houses this season; but none, I will venture to say, will approach in splendor the Christmas festivities that will celebrate the coming out of the youthful heiregs of Mont Crystal. CHAPTER XV. THE CHRISTMAS PARTY AT MONT CRYSTAL. Fill the bright goblet I Spread the festive board I Summon the gay, the youthful, and the fairI Through the loud hall, in joyous concert poured, Let mirth and music sound the dirge of care! But ask thou not if happiness be there- If the loud laugh disguise convulsive throe, Or if the brow the heart's true livery wear; Lift not the festal mask!-enough to know No scene of mortal life, but teems with mortal woe. Scott. IN Maryland and Virginia, from a' religious sentiment, of from a superstitious observance,   most persons choose to eat their Christmas dinner at home. Therefore few invitations to dinner on Christmas day are accepted, unless it be in the case of the young married sons and daughters, who meet to dine at the house of the head of their family. For this reason, the party invited to spend the holidays at Mont Crystal did not assemble until the day after Christmas. Mont Crystal and its in- mates were in great state to receive their guests. The gold-fringed curtains, hanging from the central arch that divided the two apartments, as folding doors divide them now, were drawn up with golden cord and tassels into graceful festoons, thus throwing the two rooms into one magnificent saloon, glowing with its subdued crimson lights and shadows. Far down .the gorgeous vista, and deep in the burning gloom of its extremity, was the recess of a large bay window, whose rich drapery of crimson velvet, fringed with gold, swept finely down on either side of a luxurious sofa placed below. Beneath this gorgeous canopy, and 'amid the piles of crimson satin cushions, reclined the beautiful form of Miss Arm- strong, attended by her governess.  Never was a greater contrast in beauty than that presented by these two young girls, as their figures were thrown out into beautiful' relief by the crimson background of their seat- both so charming, yet so unlike. Louise, reclining, with her fair, transparent com- plexion, with her mild blue eyes and pale gold wavy hair, with her fragile and droop- ing form arrayed in white muslin as soft and pliable as her gentle disposition; Britannia standing, with her fierce blue-black eyes, her glistening black tresses curling down her snowy forehead and carnation "cheeks, with her stately figure, attired in a rich dark-green brocade, embroidered with a deep border of variegated flowers-a dress dignified as her own spirited temper. They were a beau- tiful contrast. Britannia was handsome- Louise, pretty. Brighty was elegant-Louise, graceful; Brighty was brilliant-Louise, gentle; Brighty, stately- Louise, graceful; Brighty was witty and satirical--Louise, benevolent and confiding; Brighty, audacious-Louise, timid; Brighty lived chiefly on her intellect-Louise, on her affections; in a word, Brighty was fascinating--Louise, lovely. Far up the other end of the saloon, and facing the main entrance, stood Mrs. Arm- strong, her majestic form   arrayed in the  sweeping folds of a black velvet robe, her rich, abuindant hair confined m a black bugle l   net. On her right hand, attending her and occasionally conversing with her, stood a young man in the black dress of a clergyman. He was of a delicate form; a thin but highly intellectual face, with his pale broad forehead softly shaded by fine, thin, sillky black curls. His manners were gentle and courteous, and his voice soft and sweet. This was Willis Lindslay, the nephew of Mrs. Armstrong, and a 'student in the Theological College of-- He had come down to spend his Christmas at Mont Crystal, and now stood with the lady to assist in receiving her guests. The visitors, as they in succession alighted from their carriages; were received by the porter, who, throwing open the hall-door, passed them into. the care of a servant stationed there to attend them to their respective rooms. Thence, after having arranged their toilet, they passed into the saloon at the entrance of which Mrs. Armstrong received each guest with the -stately courtesy of a Virginian lady of the old school. First-as punctuality with a lady and hostess was a chivalric virtue of that old gentleman-came General Stuart- Gordon, with his erect militarv air. He ad- vanced with a deep, slow, reverential bow, met by the lady's slight imperial bend, as she said, graciously- "General Stuart-Gordon, you are most wel- come to Mont Crystal." "I am honored in becoming once more the guest of Mrs. Armstrong," replied the aged Chesterfield,.with a second and deeper rever- ence, as he gallantly took the place on her left hand, after slightly, en passant, acknowledging the bow of the young clergyman. "Mr. Stuart-Gordon, we are happy to re- ceive you. My daughter, Miss Armstrong,. will be pleased to see her old schoolmate. You will find her at the other end of 'the room," smiled the lady, as Louis Stuart-Gordon entered, and she gracefully passed him on. Louis immediately anrd gladly sought Louise. Next came old Major Somerville, with his ven- erable head thinly scattered over by a few silver hairs on the temples, with his 'form bowed and tottering with extreme old age, as he leaned on the arm of his grand-daughter, the calm Susan. Mrs. Armstrong advanced to receive the patriarch with more .than usual courtesy.. "Major Somerville, it affords me pleasure to see you at my house. The ladies of our family have long missed the good and wise counsels, of their oldest 'neighbdr, and 'best and most ven- erable friend I 'irss Someville, you are wel:   come; my daughter will know how to value the privilege of your society, having lost it so long. Mr. Lindslay, Miss Somerville is looking weary; do me the favor to give Major Somer- ville the support of your arm to a comfortable seat." The old gentleman bowed low, with the rev- erential gallantry of the olden time; Susan slightly bent her head, and the veteran and the maiden passed on, conducted by Willis Lindslay. "Ha, ha, ha! ha, ha, ha!' ha, ha, ha!" were the peals of laughter that, ringing out like sil- ver bells from the hall, broke upon the decorous silence, startled the stately composure, and shocked the august propriety of this ceremoni- ous reception. "Ha, ha, ha I ha, ha, hal! ha, ha, ha!" Every one in that superb room  paused, looked towards the door, listened! "Ha, ha, ha I ha, ha, ha I ha, ha, ha!" Mrs. Armstrong drew herself up in awful majesty. "Ha, ha, ha- I ha, ha, ha-a-a-aw," rung out the musical laughter-approaching-screaming -shouting; and Gertrude Lion burst into the midst of theim like a ball discharged from a cannon. The effect of her entree was petrifying. Each member of the company was arrested in the attitude in which he or she happened to be standing or sitting. While they stood transfixed-enchanted-I will describe this girl-this savage beauty, as she stood among the conventional circle assem- bled at Mont Crystal. There she stood, nearly six feet in her gait- ers, of so finely proportioned form that every attitude and gesture displayed the most charm- ing grace, blended with the most enchanting originality. Back from a brow white as sculp- tured marble, flowed locks of glittering gold rolling and flashing far down upon her blue riding habit with the freedom and strength of a lioness' mane; the large clear eyes of Saxon blue, blazing with an intolerable light impossi- ble to darker orbs. There she stood, with the laugh arrested on her lips still scintillating from her eyes, as though it would explode, with one hand holding up her riding habit- with the other grasping her whip. There she stood, with the majesty of Juno and the free' dom of Diana blended in one form of astonish- ing perfection; there she stood, caring as little for the startled hauteur of the august lady of Moat Crystal as Queen Vashti cared for the digity of the inebriate king; there ashe stood,   e silent for one moment, while they paused, spell- ) bound by her beauty and audacity. Then ; catching up the frozen white hand of the proud - "ladye," she exclaimed-- "How do you do, Mrs. Armstrong?-ha, ha, ha  Excuse me, it is too good--Brutus wish- ing to learn Greek for love! Think of a lion i in love--a lion put to school! Were you ever [ in love, Mrs. Armstrong I Were yoi, General i Stuart-Gordon? How does it feel, I wonder? I fancy it is a sort of intoxication not unlike that produced by alcolol--certainly I know it makes people talk nonsense and run their heads against a post." And so rattling on, the savage girl sprang through the dignified circle, fled up the saloon, and caught and crushed Britannia in her strong arms before Mrs. Armstrong had chosen to relax the frozen rigidity of her stiff face and form. Her cold, steel eye followed the girl as she shot away, then, turning de- liberately to her companion, she asked, in measured accents- "Can you inform me, General Stuart-Gordon, why that young woman is permitted to go at large? By sanity, implied from her freedom from constraint, inflicting upon the neighbor- hood the necessity of recognizing her?" "The Lions are eccentric-startling-but Mrs. Armstrong has self-possession and for- bearance," was all the reply that the gallant General would attempt, and it was made with a grave bow. The "self-possession of Mrs. Armstrong" had received a thunder-shock, but it had maintained its perpendicularity; not so her temper, for when the next couple, which was our old schoolmaster and his adopted child,. came forward, she merely received them with a cold bow, as she swept aside to let them pass. They were followed closely by Brutus Lion. Brutus Lion was " metamorphosed with a mis- tress," certainly. He wore a suit of new black cloth, and his straight, black elf-locks were combed out and pomatumed until they shone with a purple lustre. He was the last arrival Thle guests had observed a punctuality in ac- cordance with the honor due to, and exacted by, the haughty mistress of Mont Crystal. Immediately after the last arrival, the dinner- bell rang. "Will General Stuart-Gordon lend me the support of his arm to the dining-room?" said Mrs. Armstrong, in the tone of one giving a command that conferred a high honor, as it did. The General acknowledged the honor by a stately and reverend bow, and, taking the tips of the lady's kid glove in his hands, led her reverently, at arm's length, across the hall to   the dining-room. There were no familiar lock- ing of arms between a lady and gentleman in those stately days. The company followed in couples, and to the astute Mrs. Armstrong the order in which the company came to the dinner- table afforded a good clue by which to trace the mutual attractions, of the young people. Finesse in concealing preferences until the last moment from the world was not in vogue among the young men and maidens of that day and neighborhood. Nearly all the young people of the same rank in that sparse neigh- borhood were collected in\ that saloon, there- fore the state of their friendships might be guessed by their selections of partners. Mrs. Armstrong had taken her place at the head of the dinner-table, General Stuart-Gordon standing at her right hand.  She watched covertly the entree of her guests. What was her mortification when Miss Armstrong entered, led by Willis Lindslay, the student-the poor cousin-the beggar, whose every attitude, ges- ture, tone of voice, and expression of counte- nance, involuntarily betrayed his devotion to her-what was her consternation when Louis Stuart-Gordon followed with Susan Someeiville, his pale, intellectual countenance irradiated, bending down to hers, anfd listening to her words, as though he lived upon the light of her beautifully serene face, and the deep, sweet tones of her musical voice. Mrs. Armstrong saw no farther of her guests. The other couples i might come as they listed, her mind was too ' absorbed in the study of- this annoying contre- 1 temps. It was well that her servants were  1 properly trained to their business, and that the J service of the dinner-table went on with great a propriety without her for a few moments while I she recollected herself. It was well that Mrs. E Armstrong, however inwardly discomposed, g could never be surprised from her self-com- mand.  When the last couple had taken their seats a at the table, she sank majestically into her chair, and the dinner commenced. It was an almost interminable affair. I will not tire you a with the three courses-the stately compli- ments of the gentlemen, the dignified reserve tl of the ladies-nor of the firm resolution formed by Mrs. Armstrong as she saw, without seeming g to see, the poor cousin's worship of Louise-- the devotion of Louis Stuart-Gordon to Susan f( Somerville. The most annoying thing to her co was the thought that it was not possible, with ye any sort of propriety, to manceuvre and prevent the young people returning to the drawing. ri room in the precise order in which they left it,   i- or even to prevent their tete-a-tMte afterwards, n until the hour for dancing arrived.' Thus, when n the company left the dining-room for the saloon, e she had the pain of seeing Willis carried off to r - a distant recess by the simple-minded Louise. e who wished to show him a collection of rare ;. shells and fossils, and Susan Somerville en- t ticed away by Louis to look at a fine original 3 Titian, representing a gorgeous autumn land- t scape. In another corner of the room, General Stuart-Gordon and Brutus Lion were, standing before a sofa, upon which sat Britannia O'Riley,  with Gertrude on her right hand and Zoe on i her left. These five persons were engaged in a lively conversation as Mrs. Armstrong -sailed [ majestically towards them, hoped that they were amusing themselves, and then blandly re- quested Miss O'Riley to say to her pupil that she was standing too near the window. Britan- nia understood, not only all that was said by the tongue, but all that was meanl t by'the look. She withdrew  herself from the circle, and sought Louise, at whose side she remained the rest of the-evening., Mrs. Armstrong then turned from the sofa--General Stuart-Gordon offering his hand to attend her across the room. This was precisely what she wanted-to interrupt the tete-d-tete of Louise and Willis, and to obtain, without formally demanding it, a pri- vate conversation with General Stuart-Gordon, -with the intention of calling his attention, in a diplomatic and dignified manner, to the fact, of which he seemed entirely unconscious, namely-- the decided preference of his son and heir for the penniless Susan Somerville. Having suf- fered herself to be seated in a large arm-chair; and having, with a gesture full of graceful hauteur, indicated her wish that the General should assume the seat on her left, bending graciously towards him, she said-   - "I earnestly congratulate you, General Stuart-Gordon, upon the happy prospects of your son--" "Madam!" "His choice does high honor to his -intellect and heart." "Pardon me, Mrs. Armstrong; I am not sure that I understand you." "Miss Somerville is a young lady of great good sense and amiability." "Really, my dear madam, you must pity and forgive my stupidity; I am utterly at a loss to comprehend the full bearing of the subject of your conversation." "I speak, of course, of the approaching mar- riage of your son." "Of my son, madam?" repeated the old gen.'   tleman, with a deprecating slowness and soft- ness, as though his manner implored pardon for the rudeness of his repetition "Of your sonl. Louis." "The approaching marriage of Louis, did I understand you to say, madam?" "Yes, General, I congratulate you upon the approaching marriage of your son, BIouis." "( May I inquire with what lady his name has been associated, madam!" ("With the name of a young lady every way worthy Mr. Stuart-Gordon's regard-with one of the most ancient namesmin the country-with that of Miss Somerville. I had named her in the commencement of our conversation." The General started with surprise, then root- ed his eyes upon the carpet, then looked up, seeking Louis by a sweeping glance through the room. "I had not dreamed of this T" he exclaimed, in a tone of deep regret, as his eyes fell upon Louis and Susan Somerville, in a close and ap- parently very interesting conversation upon that crimson shaded sofa at the extremity of the saloon.        ' ' "Mrs. Armstrong!" "General Stuart-Gordon!" "Will you pardon me for inquiring your au- thority for speaking of the possible, or probable, union of my son with Miss Somerville? Do you merely suspect it from your observation of the parties, or have you heard it?" "The report is common in the neighborhood, and the deportment of the young couple seems to confirm it." "Madam, there is not one word of truth in this report of the marriage engagement at all -not one word, I assure you, upon my soul's honor," said the General, with great emphasis. "Yet there seems to be a decided prefer- enee in that quarter" smiled the lady, with a successful assumption of good humor. "No, madam! Jno-- o-not so! a mere friendship, I assure you; mental affinity, &c. Miss Somerville looks upon him as a brother- Louis regards her in the light of a sister. No, madam, no I I think - am advised as to the preference of my son. I think I know what sweet flower, what delicate snow-drop, Louis Stuart-Gordon would fain place in his bosom.- I know at what shrine the orisons of Louis Stuart-Gordon are offered," exclaimed the General, with earnestness; and, rising, with a profound bow, he sauntered forward to ar- 'rest, or at least to make a third in the conver- sation of Louis and Susan. - As he approached them, he looked covertly but keenly at each,   and took note of the following facts, namely-- that Louis was now conversing in a very free and disembarrassed manner upon general sub- jects, and that Susan, usually so calm, was looking down upon the geranium she held in her hand, and now visibly trembling in every nerve-her cheek, always so white and cool, was now warm and flushed-her eyes, ever so serenely clear and open, were now downcast, each gemmed with a tear-drop, quivering to its fall. "My son has won the heart of Susan Somerville, whether he wished to do so or not," was the comment of the old man, as he stood before them. Then, taking his seat on the opposite side of Miss Somerville, he began talking to her in a lively and complimentary vein, and so completely threw Louis out of the conversation in which he had been engaged. They had no word together the remainder of the' evening. Thus Mrs. Armstrong had at last, in the face of all difficulties, discovered every incipient flirtation, and successfully ma- noeuvred to arrest them. By reason of the number of guests at Mont Crystal, General Stuart-Gordon and his son occupied separate beds in the same chamber. When'they had retired to their room, General Stuart-Gordon commenced, in his fatherly and affectionate manner, to banter Louis upon the subject of his affection-not for Susan Somer- ville-he was determined to be blind, deaf, and dumb, upon that affair when with Louis, unless it should be forced upon his attention in a man- ner that should compel him to take cognizance of it-but upon the matter of his old childish affection for Louise Armstrong. This was with a view of discovering the true state of his heart; for General Stuart-Gordon by no means felt the assurance upon this subject notu, that he had expressed when speaking upon it with Mrs. Armstrong. "What is the matter Louis between you and Miss Armstrong 8 You did not speak the whole evening, I think." "Father, Louise has been, by her mother, I think, frightened into avoiding me. :Within the last few weeks, -whenever I have chanced to meet and speak to her, at church, at the village, or elsewhere, she has exhibited such terror and distress, that I could not, and cannot, find it in my heart to persecute her with an- noying civilities. I merely made my bow this evening, on first entering the room, andthen I retired." "Do you like Louise, Louis?" ( Our lives, from infancy up, have been knit together, father. My heartstrings are iater-   laced with hers. The withdrawal of Louise's heart tears mine." "So you really do like Louise f' ".Like her, father I' exclaimed the young man, in a tone of deep emotion. "Yes, like her. Well, I like her too; like her every way. She is the very bride I should select for you, if I had that privilege. There- fore, marry her, and receive my blessing," said the old man, rubbing his hands. "But, my father, Louise avoids me." "Wouldn't give a cent for a girl that * didn't." "When I enter the room she leaves it!" "Follow her out." "She hates me." "Love her." "She will certainly reject me." "Then marry her. Nonsense, Louis, do not you know that every woman is an Atalanta, and flies only to excite the ardor of pursuit?" In the very next room to this, but separated by a wall so thick as to prevent the passage of the sound of conversation, another confi- dential interview was held between a parent and child. Mrs. Armstrong and Louise were alone in their bed-chamber, for Louise had always shared the sleeping apartment of her mother. Mrs. Armstrong had sunk into an easy chair, and Louise had seated herself on a low cushion by her side, with her head resting upon her mother's lap. 'Mrs, Armstrong's ice- like face had almost thawed, her marble-like features were almost flexible, as here, in the privacy of her bed-chamber, she conversed with her daughter, seeking-alas   it was almost too late-to win the confidence of the child whose innocent revelations of herself had been repulsed and -driven back,until all her thoughts and feelings were closely, timidly inclosed in brain and heart. There was too much fear and dread blended with the love of Louise's idolatry of her mother, to admit of perfect sympathy-and confidence. Mrs. Arm- strong's favorite maxim was, that " familiarity breeds contempt;" and so she had " guarded her strangeness"  all but too successfully. Now, as she sat there, with the head of Louise f for the first time since infancy laid upon her : knees, and while she ran her fingers through i the pale hair, she would have given much for an hour of the warm, free, full intercourse of i mother and daughter ; but the natural flow of t confiding affection, repeatedly checked, con- t geals at its fount, and is not so easily unloosed by the sunshine of sympathy as the ice-bound waters are by spring.   a  "My daughter it appeared to me that your manner was cold to Louis." "Was I wrong, mamma? Indeed I wished g to do right." "You were wrong, Louise." e  "I wish I ever knew what to do  Dear I mother, am I not stupid? I try to do well, * and am always doing ill. Iow is that I I I was wrong in conversing with Louis on the ground some weeks since, and I am wrong in, not conversing with him now. I am afraid, ; mother, that I have a very feeble understand- ing-have I not?" It was just now, in this exigency, that Mrs. Armstrong divined the difficulty of making a rational and responsible moral agent of one, out of whom she had crushed all freedom of thought and feeling. "My daughter " she replied, in a slightly subdued tone, "my daughter, 'circumstances alter cases.' Miss Armstrong in her own halls must display a courteous hospitality to Mr. Stuart-Gordon as her guest. And," continued the lady, sinking her voice to a still lower and more confidential key, " .Louise must console Louis-must win him from the melancholy that still so darkly colors his conversation and man- ners-my daughter i" "' My dear mother!" "You did not reply to me.   Understand, Miss Armstrong, that I wish you to be amiable to Mr. Louis Stuart-Gordon." Louise bowed her, head, in reply. "Now, my love, ring the bell for Kate, that she may come and put your hair in curl." Louise obeyed. This act of-commanding a girl to be sympa- thetic was in perfect keeping with Mrs. Arm- strong, who did not understand "sympathy. But in the course of a few days the astute lady, perceiving that her presence imposed the greatest possible restraint upon the manners of her daughter, gradually withdrew herself as ., much as possible from her neighborhood, and covertly watched the progress of her drama. She withdrew herself, and into herself, and a dark shadow of gloom, bitterness, and reserve settled upon her countenance. Her, soul was an instance of a kingdom divided against itself. The destiny she had designed for her daughter was certainly approaching, Yet, as it drew. on and on towards its consummation, the cloud"darkened blacker and blacker upon the brow of the mother. o.-- --   CHAPTER XVI SUSAN  SOMERVILLE. They seem'd to those who saw them meet, The worldly friends of every day; fHer smise was undisturb'd and sweett His courtesy was free and gay; And yet if one the other's name In some unguarded moment heard, The heart you thought so cold and tame Would flutter like a captive bird. Jilnes. To the morbidly fastidious nature of Louis Stuart-Gordon, there was something extremely repulsive in the idea of the interference of a tlird party in his wooing, even when that third party was his father, and well-wisher in his suit. Handling, however tenderly, brushes the down from the wing of the butterfly--love. He found a difficulty in courting "to order,' even the girl he loved. "Marry Louise'--he wished no less; but now, if he did but speak to her, look at her, he felt himself watched- watched with. a solicitous affection, with a bon vioyage to his suit, it is true, but still watched; and his delicate Cupid folded its wings, tucked its head beneath one, bird fashion, and would have composed itself to sleep but that an inci- dent roused and alarmed him. This was the assiduous attentions of Willis Lindslay to Lou- ise-to his Louise-his delicate flower-his sheltered exotic, whose greatest charm for hm was her rare crystalline purity from the con- tact of the world-from those frequent, so- called, harmless, but really debasing flirtations, in which the aroma of a girl's first affections are apt to be exhaled-from those pressures of the hand, glancings of the eyes-from those sighs, and tears, and whispered tones of love, that, breathed upon his flower, would have carried off its dew, and withered its freshness for him. You will smile, reader, but it is a fact that Louis Stuart-Gordon congratulated himself that his little lady-love had neither brother nor father to familiarize her with what his morbid delicacy termed coarse caresses- nay, that even her mother was too cold and proud to touch the polished brow of the girl with her lips. True, vitality had been chilled -within her, but it was not dead-lie could warm her to life again-and such a life of love! These had been the thoughts, wishes, and in- tentions of Louis Stuart-Gordon. Now, how- ever, his divinity was in danger of losing in his eyes some of her exclusive glory; ever close by her side, stooping to her ear, and whisper- ing in a low and love-tuned voice, stood Willis   Lindslay. How he sped in his wooing it was impossible to tell, from the habitually subdued and quiet manner of Louise. The life, the sting, of jealousy, is its uncer- tainty. Where there is assurance one way or the other, the passion may become love and joy, or it may become despair or revenge, but it ceases to be jealousy. How dissimilar, in unlike natures, are the manifestations of pas- sion and emotion. How various, in different subjects, is the pathology of jealousy. In the bosom of Louis Stuart-Gordon, its rise was, slow, sorrowful, rather than sudden or angry, disposing him to self-immolation, rather than to vengeance. "If Louise, my darling Louise, falls away from the affection of her infancy and childhood, of all her young life-if she has ceased to love me, and has given her heart to this happier cousin of hers--why then-what then? Shall I dim her joy with the knowledge of my suffer- ings? No, Louise I that may be demon-love,.but it is not angel-love-it is not even human love. No, Louise! I would not cast the shadow of another cloud upon. that young brow-too overcast already. No, darling Louise! be happy-and God give me some other way of contributing to her happiness. I will even enrich that poor, young cousin, if his poverty stand in the way of your union, Louise! I will be the unseen providence of your happi- ness, Louise; and then-and then!--a short life, God! oh, God! a short life .' So saying, Louis Stuart-Gordon, with the thought of the happiness of one being absorb- ing his mind, went straight to make the misery of another. There are more mistakes made, more sins committed, more wrongs - done, by mere thoughtlessness, than by all the evil propen- sities and malign passions put together. There was in the soft seeming fornm, serene countenance, and quiet tone of Miss Somer- ville, a mesmerizing influence that possessed the power of composing 'the most turbulent emotions of the most disquieted souls that approached her.' I believe she could by her -look and tone have calmed a maniac. How healthful was her influence-upon the morbidly excitable temperament of Louis Stuart-Gor- don; but, oh I at what a fearful price she imparted it!'- When the diseased woman touched the hem of the Saviour's garment, Christ felt "virtue depart from" him. The health that healed the sick, the strength that raised the feeble, departed from the Saviour- and how ill and weak it left him in Geth-   semane-l How ill and weak, until "angels ministered unto him, strengthening him!"It is not irreverent to say that the life of the humblest disciple has its type in the life of Christ! Grief for the loss of his mother, separation from Louise, ennui, tedium Oime, the maturing and the disquiet of energies that had not yet found their proper direction, the youthful want of love, rather than love itself-these were the mixed motives that first drove Louis to seek solace in the company of Susan Som- erville-little dreaming that, while he was gaining from her, health, strength, and cheer- fulness, that she was losing the same to him. Her soft manners were so soothing to him,' how Scould he deem that the peace that was falling upon his spirits was departing from hers f That, in benefiting him, she was grow- ing to love him; that, in loving him, she was losing her old tranquillity, her independence, ay, for a while the very power of guiding her own life. And so, day after day, thought- lessly he had visited her, sat by her side, read, conversed with her, until his society became a habit, a necessity to her, in proportion as his returning cheerfulness rendered hers needless to him. Now, at M6nt Crystal, he sought again the society, of Susan Somervillle as a balm for the deep wounds his heart had received in the supposed defection of Louise; and he met again the same sweet welcome, the same gentle glances and soft tones that ever fell, like cooling dew, upon the fever of his spirits. And Susan-how fared it with her? Calm, cool, and wise, in all other affairs, in this she : was but too blind. She had suffered her heart, not head, to interpret the meaning of Louis's constant visits-his long tarrying--his I earnest glances-and his breathless listening ] for her words-and even as Zoe had received the silent manifestations of her lover's regard in all confidence, so Susan accepted the tacit 1 friendship of Louis, translating it-love; and if she lost her serenity, and grew hurried and 1 agitated, it was, as yet, rather with hope than t with fear. It was under these circumstances that, upon one morning about a week after their arrival at 1 Mont Crystal, Louis sought the side of Susan c Somerville. The family had not yet assembled t to breakfast, and she was the sole occupant of a the drawing-room. She was seated upon that   c crimson sofa at the extremity of the saloon. i Louis entered, slowly sauntering towards her, Xm and took the seat by her side, dropped his head 1 upon his open palms, and murmured-      a   "6 Susan, dear Susan." t  "Louis"' 3  That was all she said, but the round, full, f melodious tone in which that single word was breathed might have stilled the tumult of a t tempest, "Susan, I have need of thee--I have need of thy affection; give it me, Susan. Here I lay one cool hand on my brow, the. other on my heart--so. Susan, I have neither mother, sis- ter, nor love; and I do need some woman's af- fection so much-give me yours, Susan." "You have my best Jlove-you shall have my best efforts to promote your happiness, dear Louis." "Thank you, my dearest sister-thank you, Susan. Alas, Susan, you will despise me; I am growing sentimental, maudlin, mawkish; I am beginning to despise myself. Susan, give-me the secret of your cheerfulness-of the cheer- fulness of all the people I see around me. How is it that they live without a-great love, Susan I How do they fill up their hearts? Why can- not I do so? Is it for the want of good mother wit, good strong common-sense, Susan, that I moan my heart out because a young, pale, frail, trembling girl does not return my love.? Tell me, Susan." Susan Somerville had been startled by the commencement of his last speech, had, grown pale as it progressed, and at its conclusion she replied, in a sinking voice- "I do not at all understand you, dear Louis." "Ah, my sister Susan! I love and 'adore Louise Armstrong, while she has given her heart to another; pity me, Susan." "I do, I do indeed," murmuril Susan, in a dying tone. 1"But I pity you because you are blind; she does not love any one except her mother." "Are you sure of what you say, Susan?" "Very sure of it, Louis. And now I must bid you good morning." And so saying, the girl arose and left the room. Meeting a servant, she requested him to have Major Somerville's horses saddled, and brought around.  Susan Somerville passed on up the stairs, her smooth white cheeks a shade paler, her quiet step a degree slower, her calm voice a tone lower-these were all the signs the most acute observer could have discovered of the darkness, coldness, desolation, that had fallen upon the poor girl's life. I know that this word " desolation" is strong-'is hackneyed. Yet, let the reader remember that a first dis. appointment in the affections, falls upon the   young heart like the knell of a doom more ter- rible than the death of the body-a spiritual annihilation. To them the destruction of their love hopes is indeed despair, " desolation." They have seen the sun set for the first time, and have no experience to teach them that it will rise again. They have seen vegetation blighted by a first frost-rivers and brooklets frozen by'a first winter, and they have no knowledge that flowers will bloom and waters flow in a second spring. Ah I no; the darkness of perpetual night; the coldness of eternal win- ter, the agony of an infinite void, seems within and around them. The long weary years of life, stretching out towards the future, seem too terrible to bear. Death would be welcome to the most cowardly during this heart-sickness. So felt Susan, as she passed slowly up the stairs, without a single thought in her mind, with only the feeling of a horrible nightmare of the spirit weighing her down., She could not think, she could only feel. She could not wonder why the sunlight, glancing through the window on the stair-landing, fell gloomily upon her-why the distant shouts of Gertrude Lion's laughter grated harshy upon her ear-why the flashing of Britannia's purple satin dress, bright ringlets, and sparkling face, as she bowed and smiled her hasty good morning, in crossing the upper passage, struck painfully upon her- why all gay sights, merry sounds, happy sur- roundings, were suddenly in discord with her -jarring, grating, torturing her nerves. She,- did not think, she only felt. It is at a long distance that one can look back and analyze emotion-reason upon feeling. Instinctively and mechanically she closed the window shut- ters, of her room, laid down upon her bed, and doubled the pillow around her head, and in the deep darkness and profound silence of her chamber, her whole consciousness of existence merged into one absorbing sense of loss. The alarum of the breakfast-bell did not arouse her. Half an hour after it sounded, a soft hand laid upon her hand that clasped the pillow over her ears, a soft voice murmuring close by her side, caused her to put aside the smothering pillow, and look up. Her maid, Anna, who had at- tended her to Mont Crystal, was standing by her side, now looking with sad surprise at the disordered dress, dishevelled hair, and pale face of her mistress. 1"You are ill, Miss Susan," said she, taking her hand, and looking with earnest affection at her fallen features. "No, Anna," replied Miss Somerville, rising upon her elbow. Anna looked at her keenly,   incredulously, then in her turn growing very pale, she inquired, hurriedly, earnestly- "Have you heardfrom The Crags? Has any thing happened there, Miss Susan f" "No, Anna, nothing. And now, Anna, do not question me further. Don't look distressed, Anna; I am not displeased with you, my dear Anna-and Hbut I am very, very, very tired of every thing and of almost every body." And Susan Somerville slowly arose, gathered up her long hair in her hands, let it fall again heavily with a deep sigh, and finally resigned herself into Anna's hands, to have her toilet rearranged for breakfast. Immediately after breakfast, Susan Somerville intimated to her grandfather her desire to return home; and, on receiving his consent to the proposal, an- nounced to her hostess their intention of re- turning to The Crags. Through the delay of Major Somerville, their departure was deferred till after dinner, so that it was nightfall before they found themselves ascending the rocky acclivity lead- ing to The Crags, and it was pitch-dark when they alighted at the door. Susan went at once to her room, to change her dress; and Anna, after helping her aged master to disen- cumber himself of his great coat and leggings, and after handing him his dressing-gown and slippers, and settling him in his dozing chair, went out into the kitchen, and taking her mother aside, said--   "Mother, Miss Susan is very unhappy about something.; Some sudden grief has fallen upon her. Mother, what is it, and what can we do to relieve her? Miss Susan is wretched I In- deed she is!" "Anna, perhaps she has discovered the ruin that threatens us every hour!" "No, indeed she hashnot; far wide of it, She knows her father is in debt, at the mercy of his creditors; but she does not know how near, how imminent, how inevitable, our ruin is. No, thank God she does not yet know; for even when I forget to guard myself, when I manifest anxiety or grief, the dear girl ascribes it to my condition, as if I could reatize it in her gentle service I She thinks I am self-seeking and ambitious. She does not know   me. No, mother some other deeper sorrow preys upon Miss Somerville's mind; and it is you, mother, who must tell me how to comfort her; for you have lived long, and know every thing-I know nothing." Harriet was kneading dough. She paused in her occupation, and seemed to reflect; then she asked- -   "Is Mr. Stuart-Gordon at Mont-Crystal?" "Yes." "Was he attentive to Miss Susan 8" "Yes." "What do they say about him there?" "That he has long been engaged to Miss Armstrong, and that this Christmas party is in honor of their renewed betrothal." "I feared so!' Miss Somerville needed a mother to watch over her. After all, a nurse -one in my position-cannot meet every want in a young lady's daily life. But, now, listen, Anna. We must keep our young lady quiet, comfortable, and occupied. Subdue every thing to soothe her excited nerves. Let no sunlight into her room. Do not let the fire blaze too brightly-keep all loud noises far from her-temper even your own services for her, so that they do not become obtrusive. And now, go and set the table, and make all things comfortable, my child." The woman who gave this advice Was no common, coarse-minded menial. The reader need not be- surprised at this. Delicacy in perception of character and emotion, and in adaptation and manifestation of sympathy, is the result of cultivated affections rather than of educated intellect. And Harriet possessed the first in a large degree. The Christmas party lasted a fortnight at Mont Crystal. At the end of that time, Louis Stuart-Gordon and Louise Hector Armstrong were affianced. Upon the strength of the new relations, Mrs. Armstrong was induced to accept the earnest invitation extended by General Stuart-Gordon to herself, Miss Arm- strong and Miss O'Riley, to pass a few days at The Isle of Rays. It was while the family of Mont Crystal were staying at the Island Pal- ace, that the marriage day of the youthful couple was fixed for the twenty-second of the next month, February, the anniversary of their birth, when Louis should complete his eighteenth, and Louise her sixteenth year. CHAPTER XVII. BRUTUS LION. His face is dark-not very quiet; It seems like looking down the threatening mouth Of some great cannon. John Sterling. "MAY the devil fly away with Zoe I God bless her!" prayed and cursed Brutus Lion, as   hills and valleys sped behind his flying horse's hoofs. "Drown Zoe, for a blind kitten or a supernumerary puppy I What is she, a little quilt-piecing, carpet-sewing huzzy, that I should be worried by her? Is she a hunt- ing-knife, a gun, or a game-bag, that I should wish to possess her I A shot-flask,. or a pow- der-horn, that I should want her hung about my neckS ' A horn or a hound, a pointer or a setter, that I should need her every hour  Have I been so used to her, that I should miss her every moment?  Confound Zoe I God love her I Is she either deer, fox, pigeon, or goose, that I should be for ever hunting her? Now this morning! a fine morning I a glorious morning! when my blood is heaving up like the sea at high tide-when Earthquake is champing the bit and pawing the ground- when Thunder and Lightning are snuffing the air-when the scent would lie so beautifully -upon this sublime morning created for a hunter-what am I about to do  By Nim- rod! Going to school, to learn ton, ti, ta. No wonder Gertrude laughs at me. By thunder, isn't it I I, with my giant limbs and thick head, sitting down with my elbows on a table, and "Readings'from Herodotus" before me. Sink Herodotus! Come   Enough of this nonsense! Fire the old schoolmaster with his pride and his Greekomania I I'll have done with this tomfoolery. I'll marry Zoe at once -and I'll see who'll prevent me  Then I shall have a right, as his son-in-law, or his adopted son-in-law, to support the old man, without having to learn lessons--devil take them I into the bargain, by way of saving his pride I I'll-marry Zoe--Iwill do it!" thundered Brutus, bringing his hand down so heavily on the flank of his horse, that the beast bounded under him. Then, falling into a more thought- ful mood and a slower pace, he muttered to himself-"And Gertrude Lion, Satan fleece her I Gertrude, with her fierce blue eyes, her rolling yellow mane-that cataract of golden hair-and her shouts of laughter Gertrude Lion, with her body of adamant and soul of frost, with her sneers, scoffs, and unbelief I Oh my God I I would give half my patrimony to any fine fellow who would win the love and break the spirit of that sister of mine-for without a doubt it would be doing her and me a service. But who could do it I Strong as a lion, wild as a chamois, aspiring -as an eagle, and colder, harder, than any thing that lives- cold as an iceberg, hard, as a rock, is Gertrude Lion! .. And she will not sympathize with me, will not love my Zoe, or agree to accept her            ,   as a sister. And my Zoe will not venture to encounter her scorn. Zoe is proud, the little wretch I as if she were called upon to be proud with me, or for me. Who, to see Zoe about her domestic affairs, would suspect the substratum of self-appreciation that forms the basis of her character, or suppose that she could say to me, ME, the last of the Lions--' Brutus, I am a pen- niless girl, and you a millionaire I 1 am a nameless, and you are Lion of the Lair. I am a foundling, a child dropped from the clouds, thrown up by the tide-parentless, forsaken, unclaimed. You are descended from a family that dates back to the Norman Conquest! Bru- tus, I can never be your wife I Mr. Lion, I am your very humble servant l' Think of the irony, the impudence of that I Just as though I had not the. power-1, Brutus Lion of the Lair, to raise any girl, however humble, into the first rank. What a devil of a mistake in Zoe to foster proud scruples against ' entering a haughty family against the consent of any one of its members.' 'Any one of its mem- bers!' meaning no ' one? but Queen Gertrude. If Jam satisfied, if I can overlook the obscu- rity of her birth, Zoe should be. If I am pleased, let others, meaning Mistress Gertrude again, submitl And they shall. Hll not put up, one week longer, with the schoolmaster's pride and Greek, with Zoe's self-esteem, or with .Gertrude's arrogance. I love Zoe, and Zoe loves me; and that gives me a claim to her. That love is a deed of assignment writ- ten on her heart by the hand of Nature, and it is my warrant for taking her. Hold, eh, Earthquake! here we are!" exclaimed Brutus, bounding with a shock, to the ground, turning his horse loose, and striding on to the' cot- tage. He rapped, for etiquette, but, without wait- ing to be admitted, pushed the door open, and entered. The same bright, clean cottage-the same fresh, gay domestic carpet-the same blazing wood-fire-the same gentle, busy little housewife by its side. The only new feature was the pine table in the middle of the floor, with the schoolmaster's chair at one end, and with Greek books piled up on it. "What, no one here yet-where is the old man, Zoe?" inquired Brutus, on seeing that she was the sole occupant of the room. "Father has not returned from Major Sotner- ville's, where he went yesterday evening. But I expect him every moment; and, as you see, his class has not yet assembled. Indeed, dear Brutus," added she, "if it were not for your punctual attendance, our class might be said   to be broken up. Britannia does not come 3 now; she is too busy, assisting Mrs. Armstrong I to prepare for the wedding." "What wedding!" "That of Mr. Stuart-Gordon and Miss Arm- r strong." "Those children-nonsense!" "They are going to be married'on the 22d of next montli, the birthday of Louis and Louise." "And how old will their reverences be then .?" "Louis will be eighteen, and Louise six- teen." "And I, Zoe, am twenty-four; and you, Zoe, are seventeen. Come, see how much time we are losing. Zoe, my darling, to-morrow is somebody's birthday, or somebody else's; or, at all events, some other day' is, if it is not mine or yours; therefore, Zoe, go to church with me to-morrow; will you?-say, Zoe, won't you? Just do, Zoe, that's a good girl. Will you'? I'll take such good care of you, Zoe; and the cameo-colored pointer, and the old man, and the tortoise-shell kitten, too! say, Zoe, speak." "Brutus." "Brutus! Well? Ha   Brutus! What?" "Brutus, you know I cannot." "Cannot! Oh, nonsense, Zoe. Fiddlestick  and the devil about 'cannot.' You can, you must. Listen, Zoe; I have not told you all yet. It is very comfortable at the Lair. Listen; very for you, and the old man, too; and the tortoise-shell kitten, and the pointer. The pointer I shall take under my protection. There is a quantity of rats for the use and amusement of the kitten, and such a lot of old books for the schoolmaster. Very learned books they must be, for they smell very musty; and listen, Zoe, I have not told you the best yet. There is an inexhaustible lot of old coats, cloaks, and trowsers, long past mending, of which you can make an infinite number of carpets, which will be the more interesting, because there is not a floor-carpet in the whole house at the Lair. Just think of it, Zoe. Gra- cious, Zoe, won't you enjoy yourself?" Zoe sighed deeply, and answered, with a charming naivete- "Yes, indeed, Brutus; it would, as you say, give me great delight to reduce all that chaos into order--to metamorphose several barrels of old rags into several beautiful carpets, to cover your bare floors. It would all be very nice and very interesting, but you know I can't. Oh, Brutus, you know I can't 1"   "'Can't,' 'can't,' it is all can't, I believe. Why can't you, then, if one may ask a" said he, going towards her, dragging his chair, sitting down by her, and putting his arms around her waist to draw her upon his lap. She gently withdrew herself, saying- v Brutus, I am in earnest I I am not a co- quette, practising upon your affection. I am in earnest; therefore respect me, Brutus." "Prude-peacock-rock-icicle!" "None of the four, Brutus, but simply seri- ous. I tell you that my adopted father says that an invincible obstacle to our union exists. That being the case, Brutus, you should con, sider me one set apart-a nun--and respect my isolation." "' Invincible obstacle I' I wonder if you are my sister? Can't be-both my parents be- ing dead twenty years. May be you are a leper, or subject of hydrophobia. Say, are you sound in mind and body, Zoe?" Zoe laughed. "How do I know   I sleep sound and eat hearty, and have a good memory and a good power of calculation; for. the rest, I never should know I had a body, if I did not some- times see it in the glass; and I should be un- conscious of a mind if I did not sometimes overlook it." "Perhaps you are too high for me-may be George Third's daughter; or too low for me- may be Kate Jumper's child. Zoe, have you any idea of what this ' invincible obstacle' is?" "Not the slightest." "Zoe, there is no obstaclel! I say it, Zoe. The devil I Don't make me swear. , What ob- stacle can exist, if I choose ,to look it out of , existence?"    " Before Zoe had time to reply, ,the cottage ] door opened, and the old schoolmaster entered. "How do you do, Brutus? What I no one here but you?" inquired the old man, as he l sank into the chair Brutus hastened to hand him. / "Where is Miss Lion-where is Miss O'Ri- ' ley?" "Miss O'Riley is particularly engaged at j home, as I understand, and my sister is break- a ing in a colt to-day, and begs you will excuse c her attendance; that latter clause is a lie, by a the way," whispered Brutus to himself; "Ger- trude never sent an excuse in her life."  it "Excuse her-excuse her," exclaimed the old man, in a sharp and rasping tone; " excuse b her I yes, I'll excuse her attendance, but not the h payment of her fees.  Her lesson will . be charged all the same as though she had re- c] ceived it."   Had a shell fallen and exploded in their Imidst, the astonishment, the consternation of Zoe could not have been greater. At the first words of hislast reply, she had pricked up her ears incredulously; she heard his conclusion with dumb-founded amazement. Her old fa- ther-her simple, child-like, old father-grown mercenary. Her liberal father grown miserly. Her generous father grown exacting. "Yes, you may look at me," continued the old man, doggedly drawing his chair to the fire, "you may look at me, Zoe. Brutus, get your lesson; you have nothing to do with ga- zing at my daughter. You may look at me, Zoe, but I am determined to turn over a new leaf, I am.' I am determined not to be imposed upon any longer. I am determined to have money, money, money I And that reminds me, Brutus, that it is time for you to pay your second month, if you are going to pay it in ad- vance." Zoe looked at the old man, and then at the surprised and perplexed face of Brutus, and pressed both small hands together. Glad, per- haps, to have an excuse for leaving the hateful  lessons, now that the presence of the old man imposed a restraint upon his conversation with Zoe, Brutus Lion arose to his feet, and reaching his hat, said, "Yes, I forgot; this is the first of the month, Suffer me to return Bome, and I will bring my own and my sister's tuition fees for Feb- ruary." "Yes, I suffer you; go, go," said the old man, holding open the door for him to pass. "No, Brutus, no; don't go," exclaimed Zoe, springing past her father, and catching his hand. "Father is ill; he does not know what he is talking of. Don't you see -he is ill!" "Sit down, Zoe," growled the old man. "I will return soon, dear Zoe," said Brutus, hurrying from the door. "Oh, father!" said Zoe, dropping into a chair, "for you to serve Brutus so." But the sight of the old man startled her. He had sunk into a chair, pale and exhausted, and tears were coursing down his withered cheeks. Alarmed for him now, Zoe started up and ran to him. "What is it, father --dear father,fwhati is it?" 'Oh, Zoe, my   child, my baby--my poor baby I if the Lord, in his mercy, would take him to himself to-night!" "What is the matter, dearest father!" ex- claimed Zoe, pale with a vague-terror. "Alas, Zoe, how much money have we got ':!   "Enough to last two weeks yet, father-six dollars." "Six dollars I My Lord, what is six dollars, Zoe " "Sir!" "How much will this new carpet sell for?" "Dear father, I am sure I do not know. It cost almost nothing, and I do not know how much the work is worth." "We must sell it, Zoe; we must sell every thing that we can; we -must get money. And," broke forth the old man, with savage energy, "my pupils I they shall rpy me! I will have money!" CHAPTER XVIII. BRIGHTY'S CONQUEST. A brow half martial and half diplomatic, An eye upsoaring, like an eagle's wing. - Halleck. IT was near the last of January before the family of Mont Crystal concluded their visit to The Isle of Rays and returned home. The day appointed for the marriage of Mr. Stuart- Gordon and Miss Armstrong drew near. For weeks before that day dawned, the gloomy mistress of Mont Crystal had been preparing for it. She had been almost tempt- ed, for the first time in her life, to leave her isolated palace-home, and subject herself to the annoyance of inconvenient packet-boats, ill-provided hotels, and hired domestics, and go to New York, for the sake of ordering a trous- seau, incomparable for richness and elegance. Doubtless she would have done so, but that she had more, confidence in Miss O'Riley's taste in such matters than in her own; and, remark- ing coldly to her daughter that " ladies' maids and milliners, and such people, understood the minutiae of the toilet better than ladies could be expected to do," she placed Louise in charge of Miss O'Riley, and dispatched them both to New York, under the escort of General Stuart- Gordon, who was travelling to the North with no -better excuse than that of ordering new furniture for the Island Mansion, and a set of diamonds for its future mistress. Certainly, the arrogant assumption of Mrs. Armstrong strangely deceived her when she sent a beautiful, brilliant, and fascinating girl, with a decided taste for palaces in general, and The Isle of Rays- in particular, travelling day and 'night through a fine and picturesque '   country, in charge of an elderly gentleman, with an eye for beauty and a soul for poetry, who was just beginning to feel the solitude of his own suite of apartments. But Mrs. Armstrong quietly and tacitly as- sumed that no gentleman of her circle could see in Miss O'Riley any thing but " the Govern- ess ;" or rather, to speak still more correctly, Mrs. Armstrong never thought about it at all. She was entirely incapable of receiving ' such an idea. She never saw Brighty as she really was-a sparkling, dazzling, bewildering girl-radiating beauty-fascinating more from the soul of truth and goodness, ever burning through her face, than for any regularity of features, or brilliancy of complexion. No, she never realized the attractions of Brighty. She saw her through a mist-the cold, frosty mist of pride. Of course the image was dimmed to her vision; she saw " only the Governess." In thllat Mrs. Armstrong was alone. No one else viewed Miss O'Rilcy through a disparaging false medium. Mrs. Armstrong saw in Bri- tannia nothing but the dependant; no one else could see the dependant at all; they could only see the native lady. There was nothing assumed, affected, or forced, about Britannia. Her habitual elegance and propriety of cos- tume, dignity, and grace of manner, and bril- liancy of conversation, were always the natural and truthful manifestations of her real char- acter. Had Britannia crowned herself with rubies and diamonds, you must have felt, by all the correspondence, that they were made for her. General Stuart-Gordon also saw Bri- tannia through a mist, but it was a brilliant golden mist, like that which illuminated The Isle of Rays on a gorgeous autumn morning. He saw her through this illusion, for he could not see the "Governess" at all; but then he had never seen her at her duties; had only met her in the drawing-room at Mont Crystal, or at The Isle of Rays, where she impressed him only as a very " queenly" woman; and his manner towards her evinced a respect ap- proaching to reverence. And this, Mrs. Arm- strong, in obtuse arrogance, mistook for a haughty reserve, or a more haughty conde- scension to the governess. Britannia, on her part, received all this veneration and deference naturally, as a matter of course-as her due; and' without a single thought as to its reason or its result. And Louise--poor little Louise-had a dim notion that Brighty was not positively hateful to her future father-in-law; and so, in her 'little faint heart, she feebly nursed a timid "-   wish to persuade her governess to take up her residence at The Isle of Rays as her companion As yet, however, Louise durst not breathe this desire to any one. In fact, the poor, oppressed girl had never been known to give utterance to a wish of any sort in her life. It was in these moods of mind that, upon the morning of the first of February, the three travellers set out in General Stuart-Gordon's carriage for the village of Battletown, where they were to meet the Washington stage. Two days of stage-coach travelling, through a mountainous, then a hilly, and lastly an un- dulating country, brought them to Washington city, where they met the line of stages then running from the metropolis to New York. Those were not the days of railway travelling, and so it was quite a week from the time they set out from Mont Crystal until they reached the city of New York. bHave you ever trav- elled two or three days in a stage-coach, with almost the same party? Do you know how much more sociable it is than railway travel- ling? I HoW well acquainted people become the first day-how friendly the second-how intimate the third? These coaches were ar- ranged with three seats for nine passengers. General Stuart-Gordon always occupied the back seat, between his two young ladies. Louise was timid, reserved, and silent. Bri- tannia had to sustain the conversation. Bri- tannia was seldom taciturn or out of spirits; always alive, awake, and keenly observant. Especially was she so now, in passing through a part of the country very picturesque, and entirely new to her. Not a smile of sunlight ,p the mountain-tops, not a frown of shadows in the valleys, not the singing of a single brook-, let, not the laugh of a single waterfall, or the roar of a solitary torrent, escaped her notice. Nay, to her poet-mind and artist-eye, the very loneliest and rudest hut upon the road side,- with children's little red flannel petti- coats drying on its straggling fence, was picturesque in appearance, and interesting f association-in it was a home-somebody's i home.                   1 General Stuart-Gordon first heard, and lastly E listened to her talking; was first attracted, i then amused, and finally deeply interested in t her conversation. There was contagiontin her I poetry; it galvanized into new life, all the long- t forgotten enthusiasm of his youth. I lay it V down as a general rule, subject to very few, n if any, exceptions, that-when love or fever at- h tacks an elderly gentleman, it makes quicker m work with him than 'with a younger one. The t   rreason in the first case is obvious; they have i no time to lose 3 "in wooing; ; In seeking and pursuing The light that lies In woman's eyesY. I said, that at the commencement of the week 3 of travel there was contagion in Brighty's ro- mance; at the end, there was joy in the meet- ing of her eye-an electric shock in the contact of her hand. There was life, vigor, youth, Lbuoyancy, in being packed into that back seat, between Brighty and Louise, (although little Louise was no more than a band-box or a bundle in the account;) and there was a re- lapse into despondency-ay, reality-in the separation; and in his rebellious heart he cursed the hour of evening that daily brought them to an inn door, and broke up the party for six or eight hours. For his part he preferred to ride all night; but Britannia, though never divining his motive to be the love of her own company, would not permit Louise to become fatigued. In this state of progress, the party reached New-York city. A week was spent among jewellers, milliners, and upholsterers, in the mornings; and at, theatres, operas, and concerts, in the evenings. This was all very new and delightful to both the young ladies-- as well to the timid Louise as to the witty Britannia; and for General Stuart-Gordon's part, he desired nothing better than to attend them on their shopping expeditions, or on the evenings' amusements. At the end of the week, having dispatched all their purchases by packet-boats to Alexandria, to-'be conveyed thence to their place of final destination, the travellers set out on their return home. It was now that the attentions of General Stuart-Gor- don became so evident and pressing, that Britannia, communing with herself one night at an inn where the stage stopped, to sleep, f: thpughlt- ("It is certain that I have been in very high spirits-yes, and high beauty, too, ever since we set out on this journey. I know I have been excited by the novelty of traveling, the sublimity of the scenery, the poetry of paint- ing and the drama-ay, and the poetry of the jewellers' shops, too I I know that I have been enthusiastic, inspired, brilliant, some- times; and I know that, almost isolated here with General Stuart-Gordon-for Louise, is nobody--that I have, without intending it, won. his good opinion. Pshaw-l I will be -honest with myself, and not affect a moce honesty to my own heart, his admiration. I knoIw.   also, without a doubt, that I admire General Stuart-Gordon, I do. He may be more than double my age, but I do. He is a good-look- ing old man--I mean a handsome and dignified elderly gentleman, with a magnificent air; and I admire his splendid palace home on The Isle of Rays, with its gorgeous furniture, its rare and costly pictures and busts, and its fine old libiary; do I not? And I should be well pleased to become the mistress of that pa- radise; oh, should I not? Yes, verily, so much, that I begap to distrust the sincerity of my admiration for its master-for who shall know their own hearts? But I do know, also, that I never thought to win the admiration of General Stuartrrdcon; and I knolw, also, that though a gentleman, under any circumstances at all, very freely forgives a woman for setting her cap for him, and is, upon the whole, rather flattered by the same, yet General Stuart- Gordon must not be permitted to suppose that Britannia O'Riley would condescend to man- meuvre for the heart and hand of a monarch. No,. indeed; by the 'elastic pride of down- trodden Ireland and the O'Rileys, never! "No, much as I admire the princely Gen- eral, I adore Britannia O'Riley as she is now, more-highly as I prize the Island Estate, I prize Britannia's self-esteem more I should lose this fine, swan-like curve of the neck and shoulders-this strong, elastic spring ofJthe instep-this free, stag-like step-this natural and involuntary feeling of royalty-if I could cherish a mean thought, or do a mean action? Certainly it would I Therefore, General Stu- art-Gordon, if you are debating with yourself upon, the relative policy and propriety of sacrificing your inclination or marrying the Governess, leave the conflict with yourself- be at ease-another shall decide for you. Or if, General Stuart-Gordon, you have decided to lay your fortune at my feet, with many thanks for honor intended, I shall decline it. The price would be my self-respect, my health, my beauty. And yet, I do admire that regal man; I should be proud of him, and there is no other man I know, of whom I lozuld be proud 1 Certainly of none of the young men I see, who appear to me to .be frivolous-heigh-ho I What are you thinking of, Louise T" she asked, suddenly turning to -Miss Armstrong, who shared her chamber. Louise was sitting in -her white wrapper and little lace-frilled night-cap, gazing into the wood fire, at which she was warming- her feet, previou6s to going to bed--a practice that her mother had taught her, to preserve the, purity   I and delicacy of her complexion by drawing the blood from her head and face! "What are yo/u thinking of, Louise?" "Of rmy mother, Brighty.   She has, for many weeks past, looked so very gloomy, so -severely; as if I had displeased her. What can -be the reason?" '  "You have displeased her, Louise-unwit- tingyly displeased her. You are about to be married---" "But she wishes it," interrupted Louise, with her eyes wide open.           '- "My dear," said Brighty, turning suddenly to her, "I remember hearing a story of a- sect of Christians, who taking St. Paul's permission, or St. Paul's command, ' saluted each other with a holy kiss,' which was all very well, being a part of their worship. But one day, a young brother was expelled from the society for kissing a pretty sister, with an appetite. Mrs. Armstrong wishes to see Miss Armstrong at the head of a splendid establishment; and so Louise is about to exchange the cold and haughty affection of her mother. for the genial love of her youthful husband; and so Louise, so long depressed, feeble, frozen, apathetic, almost dead, is beginning to warm into a little life, just as the flower-rooti in the' frozen ground do when they feel the first life-giving sun-warmth, in the early spring; and Louise betrays this in her looks and manner, and her mother is offended by it. It must be a trial to any mother, Louise, to give her daughter in marriage, even when she has a half score of them to provide for, or establish; even when she has strongest reasons for wishing it, and the most disinterested desire for her child's well-being. Yes, it must be a heart-trial to a mother to see her life-long, unselfish devotion superseded by another, a newer, and often a more selfish affection. To marry off her daugh- ters, is a necessity, but it is a cruel necessity, under the present domestic arrangements of families, that separates patents and children at the marriage altar, separating them, some- times, for thousands of miles, and sometimes without the possibility of meeting again; thus intercepting, by the dark cloud of parting, the sunlight of joy that should fall upon the head of the bride. It seems to me there might be some remedy for this evil; it seems to me that the brightness of the bride's morning should not thus be overcast-the evening of her parent's age not thus left desolate.- There are seldom more than'three generations on earth at the same time, and it seems to me that houses might be built large enough to accom-  O'X; "  ,   modate three generations. And how united a family would be, thenl What permanency, what security, what peace it would give them -the certainty that they need never be sepa- rated on earth." "But Brighty, suppose that when a pair were married, the parents on both sides should dispute as to who should keep the young couple?"' "They should, in most cases, reside with the parents of the bride, for several reasons." "For what reasons, then, Brighty?" "Parents love their sons with more pride, more enthusiasm; but this does not make a parting with them very painful, when they send them to a happy destiny. But they love their daughters with tenderness, and suffer very much in dismissing them from their foster- ing bosoms, under the happiest circumstances. They know that. marriage changes the whole phase of a woman's life that it is a much more serious thing to a woman than to a hus- band. She is, physically, the weaker party, and in every conflict, or calamity, is most likely to be the greatest sufferer. Besides, a young wife, amid the toils and- cares of a new mater- nity, ever needs the experience, advice, assist- ance, and sympathy of her own mother. And lastly, there is Scripture for it." "Scripture for it '" "Yes; from the first of Genesis to the last of Revelations, it is nowhere commanded that a woman shall leave her parents; but is very frequently written and rewritten, that a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and the reason and justice of this is obvious from what I have just said. I have often thought-as I think all sorts of things- that if I had a little daughter, the more I loved ' her, the more I should suffer in the thought of the approaching age when she should be taken from me; and I sympathize with all mothers, even with Mrs. Armstrong, who would consider it unnecessary, or insulting--for you are her only child, Louise, and she, perhaps, is not the most disinterested in her affection for you, and therefore is more jealous, exacting, unhappy, E in her love-wanting the consolation that see- 1 ing you happy might give her. But you are X weeping, Louise 1 Do not weep, Louise;" and j the kind girl, regretting that in her love of talk c she had wounded the daughter's heart, left her s night toilet half completed, and went to caress and console her.              s Presently she inquired, with a view of changing the subject; and suggesting a more c agreeable train of thought-        t 6   "Do you love Louis, Louise?" ",Certainly I do," replied Louise, wiping her eyes.              - "I do not believe it, you little child; you say it so composedly. Young ladies ought to blush when such a question is asked them." "For what!" "I don't know, but I knowithat you commit- ted a breach of etiquette, when you omitted to be covered with confusion at my abrupt ques- tion. Therefore, I do not believe you love Louis according to established rules. Say- which do you love most-me or Louis!" " "Louis-but I love you, too," hastily added the gentle girl, taking the hand of her gov- erness. "Louis--or your mother T' "Oh, my mother." " I thought so I Unlucky Louise," said Brigh- ty to herself. "The only reason, then, why you are miserable with your mother, and hap- py with Louis, is because the former is selfish, proud, jealous, and exacting in her affection, and the latter is noble and disinterested. Be- cause Mrs. Armstrong constantly suppresses the manifestation of her maternal love, while Louis freely expresses his generous' affection." "But, Brighty, what'do you know about love T" timidly inquired Miss Armstrong. "Nothing, experimentally, Louise I Nothing, at least, of such love as exists, or is presumed' to exist, between a betrothed couple. I have- a sort of protecting affection for you, and a, sisterly regardfor Susan Somerville and Zoe. Dove. That is the growth of time, association, and esteem; but for 'any other love-for the love that poets rave about--I know nothing of it, and I am twenty-five years old, I never wish to marry, except to attain my proper elevation in society, and to escape the unjust reproaches vented upon old maids."  * "You would make a good nun, Brighty." "Certainly I that would be a way of solving the problem.  I might thereby attain a hand- some establishment, and escape the odium of old maidenhood-winning the glory of self- sacrifice, instead. Yes, Louise, I think I might be persuaded to take the veil; I should make a very good nun, provided they would elect me Abbess, and set me at the head of a magnifi- cent Abbey--always providing that the Abbey should be magnificent-the dress. of the Abbey dignified and becoming, and the ritual of the-, sisterhood sublime. I will think of it, Louise." Thus Britannia rattled on; to restore the- cheerfulness of her pupil,-. Louise went to draw the window curtains, to shut out the full moon-   beams that were flooding the chamber with silver light. "Does the moonlight -disturb your sleep, Louise?" "Oh, no-never." "Then do not shut it out, love; it is churlish to shut it out. I like, when lying awake, toQ gaze through the window at that glorious world floating free in space. And sometimes it seems to me a bright spirit, smiling a bless- ing in upon me." Louise left the blinds open and the curtains up, and the two girls retired to bed. They occupied the same couch. Neither fell asleep. Britannia's thoughts had reverted to the " to be, or not to be," of, her own possi- bly brilliant destiny, and Louise was thinking of her mother. At last, at the end of half an hour, she said- "Brighty, are you awake?" "Yes,my child." "Brighty,. I am troubled about my dearest mother. How do you know that she is gloomy about my marriage?"  "Louise, I was wrong to say any thing to ' you upon the subject. My besetting sin is conversation; if I could not converse, I should have to scribble, and that would ink my fingers e -think of something else, my dear."    c "But, Brighty, you who are so young, and 1 who have been without family ties of any sort, t from  your earliest infancy up, how is it that i you can enter so deeply into the emotions of a ( mother parting with her daughter, a daughter ( leaving  her mother; the relative and com- f parative nature of parents' love for their sons and their daughters-you, who were never a t mother, and, I  was going to say never a r daughter "        " "You might have said it.

We  sink into a reverie, u   h we catch the gleam of a new ray of light, or the tone of a new prophetic voice; we seek ), it, pursue it eagerly, to lose sight and sound of it away down in the caves of our inner life, whither it has withdrawn.

We call it inspiration- genius! May it not be poetical memory, rather -the recovery of lost knowledge and wisdom, without the recollection of its acquirement?" murmured Brighty, half awake, half asleep, sinking dreamily into unconsciousness. "It is the moon; yes, of course, it is the full moon, falling on Brighty's head, that keeps her awake and makes her fanciful," said Louise, stepping out of- bed and closing the blinds. Then returning to her couch, she changed her pillow and fell asleep. The stage left the next morning, after an early breakfast. Brighty, on re-entering the coach with Louise and General Stuart-Gordon, began to put in practice her resolution of dis- tant reserve. She was perfectly sincere in her intention to persevere in gently repulsing the General's advances; yet the most skillful co- quetry could not have devised a better plan for bringing matters to a crisis. The end of this day's journey brought the travellers to Baltimore. Here they designed remaining one day, for the purpose of seeing something of the city, and of making a few more purchases. They spent the day in walk- ing or riding through the city, and returned to their hotel at night so fatigued, that the ladies retired to their apartment very early in the evening. On reaching-their room, Brighty observed on the toilet-table a small packet, addressed to herself, having the card of General Stuart- Gordon attached to it. She opened the packet, and found a casket; she raised the lid, and a beautiful set of jewels- flashed into her eyes I First an exclamation of admiration and delight escaped her lips, as she held them nearer the light, to examine their brilliancy A but in the next instant she fell into gravity-raised the card and looked at it-then glanced at Lou- ise, who was undressing in a distant part of the room, and quite unconscious of the treas- ures on the dressing-table-then she looked   again in admiration on the jewels. They con- sisted of ear-rings, breastpin, necklace, and bracelet, of fine topazes. Lastly, she closed the casket, wrapped it again in its envelope, tied it securely, and taking writing materials from her trunk. stood there, and penned the follow- ing characteristic note:- "Britannia O'Riley offers her earnest and most respectful esteem to General Stuart-Gor- don, and solicits his permission to return the accompanying casket, with deep gratitude, and with this explanation: "Britannia O'Rilev's circumstances, by de- nying her the privilege of making costly pres- ents, deprive her of the pleasure of receiving: them." When she had folded, sealed, and directed this note, she aittached it to the top of the packet by slipping it in between the cords and the envelope, and rang the bell. A chamber- maid answered it. "I Do you know the number of the room oc- cupied by the gentleman who accompanied us hither?"         , Yes, Miss; it is number twenty-six-the next room but bne." "Has he retired yet " "No, Miss: I have just seen him enter the reading-room." "Then, if his door is open, take this packet and leave it on his dressing-table, and return and let me know when you have done so," said Britannia, handing the casket. , The girl took it and went, and in two min- utes returned to report her errand accom- plished. "What was that, Brighty?" inquired Lou- ise, as the girl left the room. "Oh, only a purchase of the General's, left upon our toilet-table." And the girls retired to rest. Early the next morning, and as soon as he had ascertained that the young ladies had  arisen and  dressed, General Stuart-Gordon rapped  at their door,. and, upon its being opened, offered his arms to the girls with an air of sad ceremony, to conduct them down to breakfast.       ! The passage of breakfast was rather amusing, could the spectator have been in the secret. The General was very grave, ate but little, and heaved great sighs as he buttered his bread.  At the end of breakfast, both the young ladies arose to return to their room, and get ready to resume  their journey. But General Stuart.-   Gordon stepped after them and arrested their' further'piogress by taking the hand of Britan- nia, and inquiring in a low but assured tone if Miss O'Riley would grant him the favor of an interview. Britannia bowed her head in as- sent, and sufbered herself to be conducted to the ladies' parlor, then vacant, and led with great deference to a seat. General Stuart-Gordon, standing respectfully before her, said- "Miss O'Riley, you have humbled me." "I am very unhappy in having undesigned- ly offended you, sir," said Brighty,I "I said that you had humbled me, Miss O'Riley." "The term is inadmissible, applied to Gen- eral Stuart-Gordon. I would not hear my best friend use it in connection with your honored name." "Miss O'Riley, I am humbled; you will re- store my self-respect by the acceptance of the small offening laid upon your shrine." "General Stuart-Gordon, you will pardon me, and permit me to adhere to a rule that circumstances make it necessary for my self- respect that I should observe." "Then this seems to be a question of pride between us." "Of propriety." "Miss O'Riley, you are proud." "Perhaps so, sometimes, and with some peo- ple." "Arrogant." "Never." "Disprove the charge, then, by receiving from a friend a bauble, that any other young lady, under the same circumstances, would ac- cept without hesitation." " But I am not' any other young lady,"'" re- plied, Britannia, rising, and drawing up her slight, elastic figure. "I said that you were arrogant, and so you are." "You misapprehend me, sir.  I humbly thank you for all and sundry your benevo- lent wishes anid intentions towards me," said Brighty. "Miss O'Riley," questioned General Stuart- Gordon, after a pause, " what disposition shall I make of this casket!" "Your own discretion will direct you aright, General Stuart-Gordon. It would be great presumption in me to suggest- their proper destination." "The boudoir of the future-Mrs. Stuart Gort don-- "Would be a very fitting disposal of them!"   "I perfectly agree with you. And I lay them at the feet of the future Mrs. Stuart-Gor- don, if Miss O'Riley will honor the ancient name by accepting it, with the devotion of its oldest representative," exclaimed the General, suiting the action to the word, by gallantly dropping upon one knee, and depositing the casket at the feet of Britannia. (Don't laugh, or rather do if you like; but this waO something like the style of wooing in our grandmother's days-the days of hoops and high-heeled shoes--of damask and brocades- of high head-dresses-stately, minuet walks- elaborate double courtesies, first to the right and then to the left-of gallant toasts, and of set speeches-when Lord Chesterfield's letters, Sir Charles Grandison, &c., formed the light literature of the day. Yes I this was the style of courtship in favor with gentlemen of the old school, especially where the gentlemen were old themselves, and somewhat stiff and proud. Many a reported courtship of the olden time have I heard from the lips of my grandmother and grand-aunts. It may be that these stately airs were assumed only by the descendants of the cavalier settlers, the citizens of aristocratic Maryland and Virginia. It may be that the republican children of the Puritans never af- fected such.) But while I have been talking with you, Britannia has been standing there with her eyes cast upon the ground, with her hand clasped in that of General Stuart-Gordon, re- ceiving his declaration. At its close, she gravely withdrew her hand, and, saying calmly, "General Stuart-Gordon 'amuses himself at my expense," courtesied, and was passing from the room, when he stepped quickly after her, and, taking her hand, said-- 4' Miss O'Riley, I admire you 1 I would ,ay, Britannia, I love thee, but that your lip might curl to hear such a declaration from a man of my years. But, Britannia, I do very earnestly respect you, very highly esteem you--my happiness is dependent upon your society. I wish to make you my wife, the mistress of my t house, the companion of my domestic life, the partner of my social and solitary hours. Bri- i tannia, do you think that a woman could be happy as the wife of a man many years her senior?" There was a deep-toned sadness in his voice as he asked the question, that appealed to rkighty's sympathies. She answered him, gently--     s "Oh I yes! I think so-when all other cir- cumstances are in harmony--"   "Could you be happy thus situated, Bri- tannia a" "I could." "Then I am to understand that you enter- , tain my suit, Brighty?" Again Britannia gravely withdrew her hand, and replied, earnestly- "General Stuart-Gordon, I feel very highly honored, and very deeply grateful for 'your preference. But permit me to hope for your happiness in a union with some other lady more worthy the distinction of your high al- liance." "' Some other lady!' Alas! Britannia, thirty years ago such a transfer might have been possible-such a transfer was possible- was made! But when men of my age form an attachment, it is their last, their last. There is no more hope in life I It is the very latest autumn flowering of the heart. There is no more blooming in the winter!" "Permit me to retire, General," said Bri- tannia, respectfully. "Go, Britannia," said he, sadly. Anid she courtesied and left the parlor. "Go, Brighty," murmured the sexagenarian lover, more maud- lin, sentimental, desolate, heart-broken, than a boy of eighteen in his first love troubles. "Go, Brighty- "'Go, thou vision! brightly gleaming, Softly on my soul that fell- Go! for me no longer beaming- Hope and beauty, fare thee well.'" As his biographer, I am ashamed of General Henry Cartwright Stuart-Gordon, U. S. A., just at this crisis I I am mortified that he should thus abandon his dignity, even when solitary in the parlor of the -- Hotel. And I think it was well that, before he grew any worse or got any farther, the shrill blast of the matter-of-fact and peremptory stage-horn broke in upon his music and his poetry, his passion and -his foolery, and called him from his ramble in the meandering paths of fancy, to the rough turnpike journey of real life. In half an hour, the travellers were once more on the road, and in three more days ,% they had reached Mont Crystal in safety.   CHAPTER XIX; THE BRIDAL. Bring flowers, fresh flowers, for the bride to wear! They are born to blush in her shining hair, She is leaving the home of her childhood's mirth, She hath bid farewell to her father's hearth, Her place is now by another's side--  Bring flowers for the brow of the fair young bride. Hemans. BuT there were no flowers in bloom on the wedding-day of our bride. The pale brow of Louise was indeed crowned with white roses, but they were lifeless, scentless, artificial- lifeless as the chilled heart of the bride-false as the courtesy of her mother-artificial as the forced smile with which Susan Somerville ac. cepted her post of bridesmaid to the youngest, fairest, and wealthiest bride that had appeared in the country for the last quarter of a century -or since the marriage of Margaret Stuart- Gordon, the sole heiress of the Island Estate, the almost fabulous splendor of whose bridal is still a tradition of glory in the, neighborhood, and which it was Mrs. Armstrong's ambition to supersede and eclipse with superior magnifi- cence. Having but one daughter to marry off -one who was about to be wedded to the most wealthy man in the State-and having ample means, Mrs. Armstrong felt the propriety of sparing no expense; and she spared none. Every thing that ingenuity could invent, taste J devise, luxury desire, or money purchase, was procured-every thing but "fresh flowers for the bride to wear." There were no flowers alive on the day of Louise Armstrong's mar- riage. The roses had been dead for months- the rose-bushes, stripped of their leaves, stuck up, stiff and stark, as skeletons from the ground. Even the lilies and the tulips were long ago in their graves.                 I And what a day it was! that 22d of Febru- ary, 18-!           - "The Devil is doing all he can to dramatize ] the four elements!" swore Brutus Lion, who at j four o'clock in the morning had jumped out of 1 bed, with a bound that sliook the house-yes, ( and the rocks on which the house was founded, ( too-and had dashed open the window   blinds t with a blow  of his fist, to look out upon the 1 weather.                   t "What is the matter," shouted his sister from t the next room.      . "Matter,. matter!" griwled  Brutus; " no hunting again to-day, Ger  What will we do I with ourselves, you and I!"   "Start a stag! I don't mind the weather! Ha! ha I you are growing effeminate, Brutus 1" and Gertrude, with a shout of laughter, broke into the room while Brutus was drawing on his coat. "I should like to see the weather that would keep me in doors. I shall hunt!" said the giantess, shaking loose her cataract of rolling yellow hair. "Hunt what, on such a devil of a day I Sa- tan would not hunt a soul to-day 1" "Ishall, nevertheless. Let -the weather do its worst Lord I Brutus, I defy the elements! Let them rage  I glory in defying theml I glory in the sublime strength that enables me to defy them I See here, Brutus!" And going to the window, she threw it up, and, baring her neck and bosom to the sharp and driving sleet, stood there, while her large, fierce, light-blue Saxon eyes danced with a ju- bilant exultation. "Oh, shut it down I come away 1" impatient- ly exclaimed Brutus. Gertrude laughed, and folding her blue cloth pelisse over her bosom, still full of sleet, ex- claimed-  "And now you expect me to get a wheez- ing, don't you  Poohl as soon expect the wild reindeer of the Arctic regions to catch a cold I No! It is only your domestic animals -brute and human-that take cold from ex- posure to the elements I Oh I Brutus, how you and I have divided the inheritance of our fathers. You, with the strongly-marked North American Indian features and complexion, have inherited the habits of an Engljsh fox-hunting squire. I, with the form, features, and com- plexion of the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes, have all the great hardihood of untamed Indian nature  Nothing affects me but confinement. Oh I Brutus, I never was sick! I never shall be sick I I defy all the influences of earth to make me sick I I could sleep all night in the open air in such weather as this, and never freeze nor get sick I Oh I Brutus, I can scarce- ly believe that I can die --that this firm, white flesh of mine shall ever perish! 'Yet I know that some time 'after I have passed my hun- dredth year that this body will begin to wear out, and dry away, and fall off from me, and then I suppose I shall ride a winged steed and hunt through the regions of air. I wonder if there is any hunting in the other world, Bru- tusf   I swear to you, Brutus, that heaven would not be heaven to me without it I The 9 'happy hunting grounds' of our Indian fathers I That is my idea of heaven!" And in truth it must be confessed that the de   Gerfalcon's prospect for, any other seemed very small. "SHUT DOWN THAT WINDOW! will you?" roared Brutus again. "Don't let the room be filling with sleet and snow while you talk I God help you! I mean the man that gets you for a wife --only it is to be hoped that no man will be donkey enough to try!" "Ha, ha, ha! I am pretty independent of your lordships 1" laughed the cold and savage beauty; " very independent!" "And very detestable for being so indepen- dent i What should make you so independent?" "That is a jibe! but I will answer you. This should make me independent-or health- ful, cheerful, and free, which is the same tiling -I live by the laws of nature." "Of savage nature 1" "(Of nature! Clothes were made to cover, not to fetter people, and I wear mine lightly and easily. Houses were made to shelter, not to suffocate people, and I stay in ours only to, eat and sleep in tempestuous weather; in a word, only when I cannot enjoy my life more out doors. Food was made to nourish and sustain, not to enervate and disease people. Therefore, I live upon Apples, nuts, turnips, and dried fruits-all those fresh, sweet prod- ucts of the earth, that, having in them the elements of life and health, will keep almost for ever-and not upon cooked victuals, that, having the principles of decay within them- selves, spoil in a day or two, or upon your more horrid and disgusting animal food. A food-pah Hwhich, as soon as life is gone, falls into a rapid dissolution. I live upon fresh living roots and fruits, and receive their life into my veins. Ah I believe me, I shall live a hundred years, in spite of the necessarily de- fective physical organization inherited from meat-eating ancestors. And believe me, that the, reason why the antediluvians lived so long was, that they lived upon the living vegetable productions of the earth-not upon the dead, and disguised cooked food, and the horrid animal food. And believe me, that the Bib- lical account of the original sin, and the heathen fable of Prometheus' theft, referred to the same epoch in the world's history, namely, the time when the curiosity or the luxury of man tried animal food, and fire, the fierce element, was captured and debased to culinary purposes, just to disguise the cannibal meal of meat, and then to change, cook, and kill the living fruits that were to have been the healthful and life-giving food of men. And what have been the results I The human race   has become luxurious, sensual, debased, and, even amidst the advance of civilization, has declined in size, in health, in strength, and in length of life I Instead of living nine hundred years, men do not live ninety. Water was made to drink, and to bathe in, and not to steep tea and coffee in, or to dilute wine and brandy with; and I bathe in water like a duck, and dnrik water, whilch is alive as the fruits are, and not your tea, and your coffee, and your wine, and your brandy, which, with all their spirit, have no life or life-giving power. And that is the reason why I have glorious health, strength, and spirits; that is the reason why I can defy the storm, when I wish to do it; that is the reason why I shall never be ill-never decay, till I am past an hundred years old- never die till then, unless somebody sends a bullet thlrough my head and heart." "You may break your own neck!" exclaimed Brutus, in a tone as if he wished she might do so. "Break my neck-impossible! There is not a horse in the wide world could throw me, and not a fall on earth from which I have not the agility to recover myself. I could ride a lion! I wish some enterprising man would bring one here, and dare me to do it! You are not a lord of creation, Brutus, nor do I know one man who is-a luxurious and enervated pack! But I am a lady of creation, and I tell you I could ride a lion t" "Should like to see you try-wonder how you would accomplish it?" By STRENHGTH, Brutus. God bless you, Bru- tus, look at me! I am STRONG I I could 'sub- due, bind. and lay at your feet, the strongest beef-fed man in the State!--any man but your- self, Brutus--by mere muscular force!' ( Yes, by 'mere muscular force'-you will never 'subdue' a man by the force of your beauty, Gertrude, although you are beautiful, or ' bind' a man by the fetters of love, Ger- trude, for you are not lovely." "( As your Zoe 1" "As my Zoe! Now why, Gertrude, do you disapprove of Zoe?-why do you hate Zoe?" "I don't hate Zoe; neither do I hate humble-bees, but I do not particularly affect either; and I will not] have a little coffee- brewing, cake-baking fool in the house." "You despise her for her birth 1" "I do not despise her for her birth, although I know, as you do not know, that she is a mu- latto 1" 1 "A mulatto 1" echoed Brutus, in dismay. "Yes, a mulatto!"   U For God's sake I how do you know? Do you know any thing of her origin i" "Do be quiet, Brutus, and let go my shoulder, Yes, a mulatto! No, I know nothing of her origin that personal observation does not teach me." "Nothing else?" "2Vo, I say!" "Then I am easy. I really thought that you had a warrant for what you said." "What warrant did I want more than my own eyes  Zoe is of mixed African blood, I tell you. Look at the dead white skin--" "Susan Somerville's is the same." "Susan Somerville's is pure white-clear white. Zoe's is opaque white. Look at the darkness around her finger nails; look at her rippling black hair-not brownish black, like the English or American hair, or bluish black, like West of Ireland hair, or purplish black, like Italian hair, but jetty black like African hair, and with the little, undulating, wavy curl all through it." "Pooh!  Nonsense I The devil I It is not ; true. You know nothing about it!" exclaimed Brutus, very pale, and very much troubled. "It is so, I tell you!" said Gertrude. "And )  I tell you that that circumstance does not trouble me a great deal, and that I shall go by for Zoe this evening, and wrap the little one up in a cloak and take her in my sleigh to, Miss I Armstrong's wedding. Ha, h'a, ha!  Little t does Mrs. Armstrong guess that in Zoe Dove t 'she will have a mulatto guest!"    1 "Gertrude! what do you mean?" "Little does, Mrs. Armstrong suspect that 1 her daughter's second bridesmaid is a mulatto c -a slave!"         ' "Heavens! Gertrude "     .      t But,I reader, we are on our way. This is the wedding-day of Louise and Louis, and, sI tempestuous as it is, we must visit other houses h before the breakfast hour. The family at The Isle of Rays was up at b, the first dawn-or, rather, at the earliest hour, cc for day could scarcely be said to dawn on that be 22d of February. Apollo Belvidere, fit herald la of the bridal morn, rapped at his young mas- fo ter's door at four o'clock. "How  is the weather, Apollo?-it was dE clouding up last night before I went to bed; dc how is it this morning!" inquired Louis Stuart. th Gordon, jumping out of bed; and opening the di door, Apollo entered, set down the wax taper and hot water, and, lifting up both his hands, de exclaimed  --- .              .   "o "Bress the Lor, massa, de wedder do seem to be a tryin' of itself". - r.  At The Crags, George and Hannah had arisen ,r at an early hour. Anna had left her humble h cot in a small room within that of Susan Som- erville, and, passing to the bedside of the lat- ter, had whispered softly-- "It is time to rise, Miss Susan, if you are t going to Mont Crystal to-day; but the weather is dreadful; i furious wind, with a driving sleet r of snow and hail, and the roads impassable; [ the very landmarks lost in the drifted and still drifting snow." "I will go," said Susan, leaving her couch. "Yes, I will go," thought Susan, as she per- a formed her simple toilet  "The fierceness of rthe storm --I shall like it, methinks.  Cer- i tainly, I shall not feel it I Yes, I will go. If I do not, Louis may suspect the extent of my credulity and folly, and his kind heart will be pained. I will go." She went, but who could compute the trials of that young heart, when, to save her friend from the mere possibility of uneasiness, she declined to avail herself of the chance of es- cape, and resolutely determined to be present at the marriage of Louis, the funeral of her own hopes. It was on the stroke of five o'clock in the morning when Kate Jumper entered her mis- tress's stately bed-chamber, and, drawing'aside the curtains, said- "Oh, madam, what a day!" "Is' it raining, then, Kate f" inquired the lady, who, through the closed blinds, and closely curtained windows, and heavily draped alcove in which stood her bed, could not hear the tempest. "It has been storming, madam; it has been storming all night; sleet and snow driven by a high wind; the ground is covered; you cannot see the tops of the fences, and the tempest is still raging fiercely; the roads, I amn sure, must be impassable," said the mulatto, (who, from constant association with the family, spoke better English than most of her race,) and she laid the velvet slippers of her mistress ready for her to rise. Mrs. Armstrong, rising, drew :.her wad- ded dressing-gown, and going to the win. dow, and drawing aside the curtains, and throwing open the shutters, looked out with dismay. Roused from her light slumbers by the sud- den blast of the storm against the windows, Louise started from her couch, and, nervous   and superstitious as she was, shook with terror at such an awakening on her bridal morn I She slipped from her bed, and went and stood by her mother's side. With something like tenderness for the child that had just passed the last night she ever would pass in her mo- ther's chamber, Mrs. Armstrong put her arm around her daughter's waist, and, divining her thoughts, said- "It may clear away before evening, Louise; nay, it must clear away before noon; it has been storming all night, and a storm seldom lasts so long." "' Blessed is the bride that the, sun shines on ;' is not that the proverb, mother 8" "Proverbs are vulgar, Miss Armstrong," replied the haughty woman, -who for five minutes would not give way to tenderness. "I wish the sun would shine out to-day," murmured Louise. "The sun of fortune shines upon your mar- riage, Miss Armstrong; and Mrs. Stuart-Gor- don will to-morrow be independent of any other light. It will be her mother's halls that will be left in gloom," coldly and bitterly con- cluded the lady. "Mother--mother!" exclaimed Louise, throw- ing herself, for the first time, sobbing, into her mother's arms. "Mother-mother-I will stay with you, if you wish it I Do with me as you please I for am I not your own child? Do I not owe you life? Mother-mother-you are my creator almost; take me to your bosom, and nourish me with your love, as you once did in my infancy, mother, and I will never, never leave you." "And Louis, then?" inquired the lady, in cold tones, but with secret satisfaction, though she would not have stopped the marriage now for the world. "Louis I oh, yes, poor Lowes!" murmured Louise; in a voice of distress. "You are ridiculous, Miss Armstrong," saia her mother, coldly turning away. The sun did not shine out that day. At noon, the tempest subsided, and there seemed some prospect of a clear afternoon. It was in the lull of the storm that Susan Somerville, attended by Anna, arrived in a sleigh, driven by George. Mrs. Armstrong received her with much politeness, and conducted her at once into the apartment of the bride. Mrs. Armstrong augured well from this arrival, for the success -of her fete. "If Miss Somerville could pass the frightful road leading from The Crags, others can come,"   she thought. And soon, indeed, was seen an- other sleigh, containing little Zoe, carefully wrapped in blankets, and driven by Gertrude Lion. Coming up with a sudden jerk, Ger- trude flung the reins upon thee horse's neck, springing out knee-deep in the snow, caught Zoe up in her arms, and bearing her on through the drifts, carried her in the hall, and set her down, laughing uproariously. Mrs. Armstrong, drawn from the saloon by the noise, came out to meet them. "There, Mrs. Armstrong, I have brought' you your second bridesmaid. You would not have got her but for me." "Thank you." , "Oh, by no means; I had a particular wish that you should not miss your second brides- maid 1" "If we had been so unfortunate as to have missed the assistance of this young lady, an- other could have been found among the guests." "But," said Gertrude, fixing her blazing light eyes upon the face of the lady, "I had a particular wish that Zoe should attend her--" She paused-paused in astonishment. The haughty woman standing before her had changed as if suddenly struck with palsy. Her form was braced back against the wall and shuddering; her stony brow blanched and corrugated; her cold, sleet eyes riveted on the radiant face of Gertrude. "Well?" she exclaimed hastily; "go on; why do you stop?" "Well, I had a particular wish that Zoe should attend her-friend," said Gertrude, in a calm voice, with a careless look. "But, Mrs. Armstrong, you are rot well; you have been agitated," said she, with an af- fectation of interest. "I have been agitated and over-fatigued," replied the lady; " and really, Miss Lion, your manners are somewhat boisterous and startling, in a quiet house; you are so emphatic on trifles that-but pardon me, I keep you in the draught." Then touching a bell, which was immediately answered by Kate Jumper, she said- "Kate, show Miss Zoe Dove into the dress- ing-room of your young lady, and then attend Miss Lion to the apartment prepared for her." And with a stately bow, Mrs. Armstrong swept on from the hall. An hour or two later, other sleighs with guests began to arrive. The bridal toilet of Louise Armstrong was commencing in the gor-   geous dressing-room prepared for her use. Although her two bridesmaids were in attend- ance, it was the artistic taste of Britannia O'Riley that arranged her dress. The bride sat before a large cheval-mirror. She wore a robe of Mechn lace, with a deep, rich border of embroidered rosebuds entwined with orange flowers, and worn over a white satin under- dress. Her pale, blond hair was braided over her ears, to suit the gentle madonna style of her countenance. Near her, on the back of a chair, was thrown a large and splendid Mecllin veil, of a similar pattern to that of the dress. On the toilet-table were various gloves, fans, essences, extracts, &c., and a case of diamonds, the bridal offering of General Stuart-Gordon, and a casket of pearls, the gift of her mother. Britannia stood behind the bride, smoothing with her hand the bands of her fair hair, until they shone again. Zoe lifted the casket of dia- monds, and taking from it a bandeau, held it- towards Miss Armstrong. Louise reached her hand for it. "No, no, my love," -said Britannia, returning the jewels, " no gems for you; not one, Louise; they are too cold arid glittering, and too hard and sharp to the touch., They suit me, Louise, not you: me, Louise, who am unloving and un- loved; who, upon occasions, can be hard, cold, brilliant, and sharp-ay, and regal--like them; me, who flash out anger with the sparks of my rubies, and scorn with the gleam of my em- eralds. But you, Louise, loving and loved- fair, soft, and gentle--you must present no hard surfaces, no sharp points; no--flowers for you, Louise." Zoem attentive, alert, opened a band-box, and took out a white wreath. "No, no, it will not do," smiled Brighty, "fresh blooming flowers we want. I will go and gather a wreath from the conservatory. But what are you doing there, Zoe?" "I am scenting her handkerchief." "Oh, throw the vial in the fire! I detest 1 those odious and sickening French extracts. ( The aroma from  her rosebuds and orange Y' blossoms, the fresh living breath of the flowers 3 will be best." And Brighty, leaving the bride, went down stairs to select the wreath and  r bouquet. On opening the glass doors leading from the s saloon into the conservatory, Brighty started violently, and repressed an exclamation of dis- t] may and horror at the sight of blasted deso- Z lation that met her eyes. That fine conserva- t tory of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of our own clime, and of the rarest tropical B   e. exotics; that splendid conservatory, that was 1- the wonder and the envy of the whole county; ia that cherished conservatory, that for years and it years had received the most careful attention; e had, in the bustle and hurry attendant upon f the wedding, been forgotten and neglected, the e 'fire in the furnace had been suffered to go out, r- and the night had fallen intensely cold; and r now, upon the bridal morning the flowers were found dead; all withered by the blight- D ing cold! I  "What an ominous day!" exclaimed Brighty, as she turned from that scene of blasted life, i and thoughtfully and slowly returned to the , bride. "I do not like her toilet at all," said Brighty, "her beautiful robe and veil are both perfect, ' but her brow crowned with artificial roses, and her handkerchief saturated with a venomous French extract. No, I do not like it." "Now you are quite ready," said Zoe, " and oh, so beautiful arid sweet, Louise! Now, Susan, we will put on our white muslins, for Louis will be here presently." Susan Somerville, who had taken no part in this toilet, because her assistance was un- necessary, now arose, and, laying off her dark riding-habit, was preparing to change her dress, when, seeing Louise looking very pensive, she went up to her and said, in a low voice, not to be heard by any of the others- "You are very serious, Louise; can I do any thing for you?" "Oh, yes, Susan, I want to see my dear mother once-more, here, before Louis comes." "I will go and bring her," said Susan, leav- ing the room. : Soon Miss Somerville returned, and, Ctooping down, whispered-  "Your mother is particularly engaged, and cannot come, Louise!" The bride burst into tears I "Ah, well --yes, here is a pretty catas- trophe! You must break your heart because 'mother' cannot leave the reception of her ,guests, to make a scene with you!" exclaimed Brighty, with well-feigned petulance. "OX, it is not that, Brighty ; you know it is not thatl" "Well, then, because she will not-because 'she is selfish, cold, and hard, and-" Here the gentle. hand of Zoe fell softly on the arm of Brighty, and the gentle eyes ,of Zoe were raised reprovingly and imploringly to her face. "Yes, I was wrong, Zoe, my little mentor. But, Zoe, thank God that, like me, you are   alone in the world, and so, are sure that your spirit will never be wounded, your heart never bruised; for none but those we love have power to break the spirit or crush the heart, Zoe." "Mr. Stuart-Gordon, with his attendants, swait your leisure, Miss Armstrong," coldly announced Mrs. Armstrong, as she swung open the chamber-door, and- stood among them. "Let them enter," said the bride, in a low voice, repelled and chilled by the coldness of her mother. Britannia, lifting the elegant veil from the chair, throwing it over the head and form of Louise, gracefully arranged it, and soon the little party were marshalled down stairs, and into the saloon. Owing to the frightful tempestuousness of the weather, the vast saloon was very sparsely sprinkled with company. "What a beautiful couple!" "What a well- matched pair!" "So youthful!"  "So inter- esting 1" ." How handsome is Louis!" "How pretty is Louise!" "What an elegant bride- groom!" "What a lovely bride!" were the whispered words of admiration that greeted their entr&e. As the bridalt group took its station in the middle of the floor, the company arose arid gathered around. The service commenced-it went on--amid the howling of the storm that drowned the responses-it was over.  The white hands of Susan Somerville reverently raised the gorgeous veil from the head of the bride, and carried it away-and no one noticed how pale and ill was Miss Somerville, while friends and neighbors crowded around to con- gratulate "Mrs. Stuart-Gordon." "What a grand name for such a little body!" whispered Zoe, laughingly, to Britannia. 6' Yes: and what a fierce name Lion would be for such a gentle little love as you, Zoe!" Zoe crimsoned, and slunk away behind the ample folds of Mrs. Arimstrong's purple velvet gown. General Stuart-Gordon advanced at this moment to offer his congratulations to his son and daughter-in-law, and met the bright face of Miss O'Riley, while the smile and glance of mirth still lingered there. With a deep bow to Brighty, he addressed himself to the fair bride. The newly-married pair now took their seats with their attendants. It was now that Brutus Lion and his sister Gertrude-I beg their pardon, Mr. and Miss Lion of The Lair--advanced to pay their com- %.   r pliments. ,Brutus, in his new suit of Lincoln- r green with gilt-buttons, his elf locks cut, brush- ed, and pomatumed, and Gertrude, looking like, the Queen of the Amazons, with her mazarine blue satin and her rolling yellow hair-or yel- low mane, as Brutus, the brute I called it- with her rolling yellow hair gathered into a huge knot, and pierced and held by a long jewelled arrow. "Mr. and Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, I salute vour higlmesses I You sit there as calmly as though something astounding had not just happened to you I I especially refer to Mrs. Stuart-Gordon. This little creature," and here the golden-haired Amazon took the delicate and white-gloved hand of Louise in her own, " this little one, was ; this morning ' Louise'-a little girl to be snub- bed by her waiting-maid, scolded by her gov- erness, and lectured by mamma; this evening she is ' Mrs., Stuart-Gordon!' Stupendous! Louise, can you bear itI I declare to youi Louise, tlat there is not a young lady present who could not support your honors with a more imposing dignity than you do! Myself for instance! I am tall and strong, and could sustain the burden of a great name! And Brighty there! I assert that Brighty ' seemed born to be the mistress of The Isle of Rays! Why, even Susan Somerville would look Mrs. Stuart-Gordon better than you do, little one! though Susan Somerville will make a Virginian matron of the first class, and of the most approved stamp I Where is Susan I Yes! where is she? I have not seen her since she raised the veil from your head, Louise!" "Yesl where is Susan, love?" whispered Louis to Louise. "I do not know; I will send and see. Miss Dove, will you seek Miss Somerville?" Zoe sprang to obey, but Britannia, by a sud- den thought, caught her arm, arresting her flight, and saying- "Stop-Miss Somerville carried off your veil, madam, and will soon return, without doubt." In the mean while, where was Susan Somer- ville? All through the day, all through the toilet of Louise, she had sustained herself by an almost superhuman exertion of will. She had thought herself prepared by steady and firm anticipation for the meeting with Louis; but at the first sight of his face, the first sound of his voice, her courage had forsaken her. All through the ceremony she stood, her brain reeling, her heart sinking, her limbs failing under her; yet she stood seemingly very quiet, so calm and white was the habitual style of   her face. I said that the marriage of Louis was the funeral of her happiness. Each word of the ritual that severed her for ever from Louis fell upon her ears like the reiterated blows by which a limb might be slowly and painfully cut off--fell upon her heart like clods upon a cof- fin lid. At the conclusion of the ceremony she felt her senses going-the scene all mingled into chaos and swam before her sight-a con- fused and painful flashing of lights, and- glan- cing of eyes, and glittering of trinkets-a con- fused clashing of sounds, where girlish. laugh- ter, mingled with deep-toned, heart-felt words of sympathy, and with moaning of the storm' without--pressed in upon her brain. To save herself, and with a last effort of self-control, she raised the veil from the brow of the bride, and bore it away.' Faltering through the long passages, and up the great staircase, she found her room. A. little fire was burning there, and a dim taper was standing on the mantelpiece, Anna was seated by the fire. Unheeding this, she approached the side of the bed, sank down upon her knees, dropped the veil upon the bed, her arms upon the veil, and her head upon her arms, and unconsciously gave way to a succes- sion of low, deep moans, like one in acute bod- ily pain might do-reproaching herself bit- ( terly. the while for the sin and shame of her 1 present sufferings. A rap was heard at the f door, but Susan did not heed it. Anna went to the door. It was Mrs. Armstrong-       1 "Is Miss Somerville in her chamber ."  "yes, madam; and as soon as she has ar- 1 ranged her dress, she will return to the saloon," \ Anna hastened to say, in order to prevent f questions.                  1 "Let Miss Somerville know-ihat we await s her presence to commence the quadrilles," said r the lady, and turned and left the passage.  r "Miss Somerville," murmured Anna, softly, e near the ear of Susan.            a The poor girl started, blushed, and, rising in s confusion, she crossed the room, and seated her- t self in the chair by the fire, unconsciously, and  without replying.              v "Miss Susan, Mrs. Armstrong has sent for k you. They expect you in the saloon."     n The fire-light, flaring up upon the face of tl Susan Somerville, showed the features con- p tracted with suffering. She gazed at Anna no with confused and half-conscious expression of yi countenance.                 y  "Shall I assist you to arrange your dress, I Miss Somerville?"              to "Oh I Anna, tell them that I am fatigued- - ill!"                    th   s  "In that case, dear lady, your room would f be -filled by officious and inquiring people-- s better try to go down." r  "Yes I I hadl But, oh, AnnaI if you t knew!" "My dear and honored mistress, I do know I i I know all 1" said Anna, kneeling at her feet, I and taking and pressing and kissing both her hands. Susan dropped her head upon the bosom of Anna, and wept freely-long and freely. These were the first tears she had shed, 3 and they relieved her of course. Stilt Anna, i' kneeling at her feet with the attitude and tones of deepest respect and warmest sym- pathy, still caressing her hands, spoke, gently, as follows-- "He is not worthy of you, Miss Somerville! Oh, believe it! believe the instincts of affec- tion that assure me when I tell you he is not worthy of you-not wise and strong enough for you. And I would rather see you weep here, than be the wife of one not fitted to retain your esteem, though that man were master of The Isle of Rays. And I, Miss Somerville-I, poor Anna Wood-would rather be the isolated being that I am, cut off by education from one class, and by position from the other- I would rather be myself with my full heart and brain, capable of deeply loving, profoundly thinking, and greatly suffering- than be that poor, little bride down stairs, with her brilliant position and her famished heart and head. Yes, weep! Grief breaks up the soil of the heart, and tears water and fertilize it. You will have a rich heart-for hearts grow rich by suffering; at least so it seems to me. You will have a rich heart-a rich mind perhaps. , There is compensation in most things. No tear ever fell, no pang was ever wrung in vain. Those who have; spent a life of tears and pains must find consolation somewhere. Oh, believe this, if you pre- tend to believe in the justice and mercy of God. I, Miss Somerville, with all my cra- vings after a full life of affections-and you know that people of my race and color live more through their affections than through their intellects-I know that I shall have to pass through life alone-alone but for you now, Miss Somerville, and quite alone when you shall be married, as you will be in a few years I Well I I shall pass through life alone. I am not therefore unhappy I I devote myself to somebody's interests, to some worthy object -and I live. Ah   Miss Somerville, I feel that my words only annoy you now; that you   would prefer silence to all this talk. No mat- ter, you will think of my words hereafter; and for the silence you will have it at last. But now, Miss Somerville, a duty lies before you- a duty that you owe to yourself. You must rouse yourself and go below. For days, weeks, perhaps, you must mingle with this gay wedding party; and then we will go home --to our quiet home at The Crags-where we will have profound peace and old books -the company of our ' brave unfortunates'- the heroes and martyrs of the past, whose example will lend us strength to endure our own trials. Come, Miss Susan! let me arrange your hair." Miss Somerville, calmed by her fit of weep- ing-consoled, too, by the delicate attachment of Anna-suffered her hair to be re-dressed and her muslin robe to be re-arranged, and then descended the stairs to the saloon. Britannia and Zoe, with Gertrude and Bru- tus Lion, met her at the door. "You are so pale! Are you ill, Susan " inquired Zoe, with interest. This question drew the close attention of the whole group upon Miss Somerville. "Are you not well?" abruptly inquired Ger- trude. "I perceive that Miss Somerville has taken cold, as I thought she would," remarked Britan- nia, drawing Susan's arm within her own, and carrying her off. "My dear Mrs. Stuart-Gordon you will do me 1 a pleasure if you will invite Miss O'Riley to e accompany you to The Isle of Rays when we return," said General Stuart-Gordon to his ] daughter-in-law, as his eyes followed admiring- ly the elegant form and radiant face of Brighty through the room.             i "Oh, thank you!   I will do so with great pleasure I  I had even wished to; ask your ( permission to do so 1" exclaimed Louise, her a usually downcast eyes now raised and spark- t ling.        i           f "( My  permission!" smiled the General, pleased at her happy acquiescence and amused d at her girlish humility. "My permission! my a dear Mrs. Stuart-Gordon!" he said, playfully, e emphasizing her new name  and title. "Get iR accustomed to your new  dignity as a house- ki keeper, and invite your own company, and se- lect your own  society, without dreaming that N I shall interfere!"           se At this moment,. Brutus Lion, coming for- S ward with a grave bow, solicited the hand of y the bride for the first quadrille, and led her off pa to the head of the set.          b3   t-  "Take Susan, and bring her to make up this ; set," whispered the bride. it  And in two minutes more Louis stood op- - posite to them, with Susan Somerville by his t side, and her hand clasped within his own. i,  The music now broke forth in peals of joy, s but failed to drown the noise of the tempest, e which had revived in all its fury.. e  The raging of the storm, the terrible state of s the roads, and the pitch darkness of the sky, - prevented the return home that night of any of e the wedding guests. CHAPTER XX. THE REVELLERS. Ring, joyous chords! But who art thou, With the shadowy locks o'er thy pale young brow, And the world of dreamy gloom that'lies In the misty depths of thy soft dark eyes? Thou hast loved, fair girl; thou hast loved too well; Thou art mourning now o'er a broken spell; Thou hast poured thy heart's rich treasures forth, And art unrepaid for their priceless worth. Mourn on; yet come not here the while, It is but a pain to see thee smile; There is not a tone in our song for thee- Home, with thy sorrows, flee! Hemans. MRS. ARMSTRONG rang her bell at an early hour the next morning:. Kate Jumper answer- ed it. "Let Miss O'Riley know that I shall be pleased to see her alone here, at her earliest convenience," commanded the lady. Kate Jumper handed her mistress her dress- ing-gown, and disappeared to obey her orders. She returned in an instant to say that Miss O'Riley would wait on Mrs. Armstrong in half an hour. And, by the time the stately toilet of the dowager was completed, Britannia rapped for admittance. Britannia, in an elegant morning-dress of dark-blue satin, with black lace falls-Brighty always made " une grande toilette" when she expected to encounter pride and arrogance in others-so Brighty presented herself, ma- king her morning salutation with easy dignity. "You may retire, Kate. I sent for you, Miss O'Riley, to say, that, after to-day, as your services to Miss Armstrong-or, rather, to Mrs. Stuart-Gordon-will no   longer be required, your further stay at Mont Crystal can be dis- pensed with. Iam aware that you are engaged by the year, and that four or five months re-   main.  Will you draw that writing-desk to- wards me?" "If you will excuse me, no, Mrs. Arm- strong." "No part of your service, eh I Well, truly, I hired you as a governess, not a waiting-maid, and'servants of all grades are great sticklers for rank." "Excuse me again, Mrs. Armstrong,-but the desk is in your reach, and out of mine; besides, I fancy you are stronger in the arms than my- self, lowever"-and Brighty, by a second and better impulse, took hold of the desk, and wheeled it before the lady. "I was about to say, Miss O'Riley," said the lady, unlocking the desk, and taking from it a roll of pank-notes, "that for 'these four or five months I am willing to pay you a half- year's salary." And she tendered Britannia m the money. Brighty waved it back:          i ONo, Mrs. Armstrong, I cannot accept a dol- lar beyond the amount of my salary up to this i day.  I shall leave your house to-morrow." b And, courtesying, Britannia withdrew from the room.                    1 In truth, the prospects of Britannia were not cheering. She would have died rather than have accepted one dollar beyond her salary up to the date of her dismissal, or have remained fr another day at Mont Crystal.        se Poor Brighty! Extravagant love of dress he and jewellery kept her nearly penniless. And m when she regained her own apartment, and counted over her slender stock of money, and tic found only the change of her last half-eagle, sa she was nearly in despair.         as Brighty was no heroine; and you are not ha to expect any of the heroic virtues taobe man- eyi ifested in her character or conduct; so she walked about the floor, communing with her- Th self, as follows :-             y ', "Well, well, what am  H-to do I  I might I have saved three or four hundred dollars if I ast had been economical, and worn calico dresses I and horn combs ; or, being extravagant as I Lot have been, I  might have still remained here, if on i I  had submitted to Mrs. Armstrong's arrogance. of Oh, Brighty, Brighty, see what you have done and by being vain, extravagant, and ill-tempered  I lau Economy is so commendable, and meekness is fart so charming, and I  do so thoroughly admire T both I   Yet the mischief of it is, I can nei- she ther fret my senses by coarse clothing, or " my temper by other people's arrogance. Oh,  yoom Brighty, you were cut out for a  princess and cann spoiled in the making upl You are a    dis- that   to- located queen. Now, where away   I shall never; never find another luxurious home, rm- another really superb patron, (for Mrs. Arm- strong is that, with all her illness,) or another uly, refined pupil, in the State. Oh! I shall prob- aid, ably find myself governess to half a' dozen [era double-chinned, short-nosed girls and boys, who munch raw turnips in school, and whose the mother cuts out her own cloth-clothes, and les, cowhides her own maids. Oh, Britannia, Bri- ' ny- tannia, see what you have done for yourself by nid your regal airs I And then you must refuse nd General Stuart-GordonI Was there ever such an egregious fool as Britannia O'Riley!"And he Brighty thought gratefully and remorsefully of a General Stuart-Gordon. or  "He is fond of me, at any rate I and after If- .all, is it not as well for a girl like me to be ia passively loved as actively loving?" said Brighty, smoothing her ringlets and adjusting her dress. -   "Brighty!" said the bride the same morn- is ing, " there is one great privilege in having a ," home of one's own." "e You    have always had such a home, my love." It  "In being mistress of a home, then?" / n  "And such a  splendid home, Louise!" p    "It is that one may share it with their best I friends 1" exclaimed the bride, throwing her- self in Brighty's arms. "Oh, Brighty I come s home with me, and be my sister, until you are I married yourself." I Brighty slightly started at the last supposi- tion, and looked keenly at Louise. She only saw the hitherto pale girl with her eyes bright  as stars and her lips apart and dewy with happiness and hope. Brighty smiled in her eyes and caressed her hair. "My  lovei I  thank you! But considerl This is a most unreasonable request of yours I1" "Why, Brighty " exclaimed the bride, in astonishment. "  Why, yes, love. Think of it I You and Louis would be the most insupportable hosts on earth for the next month or two. Think of it I A month with a newly-married bride and groom I I should expire of ennui!" and, laughing, Brighty hurried away to escape her farther importunity. Then, hastening back with a sudden impulse, she caressed her- "My sweet Louise, I am grateful for all your love and goodness, indeed I am I But I cannot accept it, Louise  It is not expedient that I   should!"   "Oh, Brighty, if you would be persuaded, I should be, so happy 1" "You will be happy, Louise! you are hap- py I and I am so glad to witness it. There is Louis! Go meet him!" and Brighty, disenga- ging herself from the embrace of Louise, hast- ened away-hastened away from the break- fast-room, where this conversation took place, to the saloon in which most of the guests who had remained all night were assembled. Here she encountered General Stuart-Gor- don, who. taking both her hands, and pressing them, looked with a penetrating gaze in her eyes, and began to say- "Brighty 1--" "I permit no one but the young girls of my acquaintance to address me so familiarly, Gen- eral -Stuart-Gordon!" said Brighty, trying to. withdraw her hands, and to repress the smile that would gleam out from under her long eyelashes, and flutter in the corners of her lips. "Au revoir, young lady," said the mature lover, gayly, squeezing both her hands until the jewelled rings upon them dented his-fat hands, and, bowing ceremoniously, he let her pass. General Stuart-Gordon had caught a glimpse of that repressed but gleaming smile, and it was wonderful the effect! wonderful how lightly stepped about that heavy man! how gayly smiled and talked that grave man!- until several matrons in the saloon, wishing to compliment him, said-- "The marriage of your son restores your youth, General Stuart-Gordon!" A piece of information with which the un- grateful General did not seem to be particu- larly delighted. "This popular idea of growing old is an illusion, Mesdames " he said. "'Age is a movable feast. " "A movable fast rather, General," replied the ladies, laughing.. General Stuart-Gordon smiled, bowed, and passed out to seek his daughter-in-law, of whom he was beginning to grow very fond. Britannia had hurried off to the bevy of girls whom she loved well enough to permit to call her "Brighty." Gertrude Lion, Zoe Dove, and Susan Somer- ville, were grouped upon their favorite crimson sofa in the recess of the bow-window at the farther extremity of the saloon. Mrs. Arm- strong was doing the honors of her house to a group of elderly ladies assembled in the front of the room.   At this moment, Louise entered, leaning on the arm of her father-in-law, and looking so beautiful, with her slightly-heightened color, her radiant blue eyes, and her fair complexion, and petite figure, set off to the best advan- tage by the pale-blue silk of her morning dress. Mrs.: Armstrong, seeing her blithe counte- nance, grew black in the face, and muttered to herself- "This it is to have a fickle and ungrateful child! Already she rejoices at the near pros- pect of' leaving her mother's house for the full liberty of her husband's." Mrs. Armstrong, in her blind pride and jeal- ousy, failed to reflect that she herself had left to others the task of cultivating the affections of her child. And indeed the heart of Louise was expanding as well under the paternal fondness of General Stuart-Gordon, as in the warm and earnest affection of Louis. "What are you going to do, Brighty?"in- quired the girls as Britannia took her seat with them. "I do not know, indeed I I have decided on nothing as yet," said Brighty, growing serious in spite of herself. Susan Somerville had not joined in the in- quiry, but now she looked up with interest upon the sobered face of Brighty, and passing her hand once or twice across her own pale and troubled brow, fell into thought. "Miss O'Riley, Brutus and myself would be very happy to have you pass some months with us at The Lair. It is true that the house- keeping is rather topsy-turvy, and that the old garden has more rocks, brambles, and snakes in it than flowers, fruits, or birds; but then our horses are the finest in the country, and our dogs equal them," said the Ger- falcon, with a blending of rudeness, arrogance, and courtesy, that was very strange. Britannia O'Riley bowed courteously, but before she could decline this invitation, Zoe Dove-caught her hand, and exclaimed, quite breathlessly- "No, no! no, no! Come to the Dovecote Brighty. The housekeeping there is first-rate. You shall have my little chamber ; I have just made a nice blue and white quilt for the bed; and I will sleep on a pallet in father's room.", Britannia took her hand and pressed it affec- tionately, and then said- "I thank you both very sincerely, dear girls. But, as yet, my future is all undetermined;" and the tears swam in Brighty's eyes, as much   from a sense of wounded pride in the thought that her homeless condition had moved the sympathy of these girls, as from an emotion of gratitude for their kindness-and then she thought of General Stuart-Gordon as one who could deliver her from all such mortifications in the present, and protect her from their return in the future; and her heart warmed towards him with the grateful but unimpas- sioued affection that the young-loved sometimes feel for the aged-loving. Susan Somerville had remained silent; but as soon as she got an opportunity of speaking to Brighty unobserved, she said- "Will you come to my room as soon as you can, Miss O'Riley "            E "I will attend you there now, if you please," i said Brighty.               r And the girls rose and sought the apartment of Miss Somerville. As soon as they were seated by the quiet, lit& wood fire, Susan again passing her hand M over her brow, like one who tries to dissipate a ! pertinacious and intensely concentrated idea, a said slowly, and in a broken voice-still like ci one trying unsuccessfully to break the bondage of an over-mastering thought, and give atten- b3 tion to the subject in hand-       s "Britannia, after these-these wedding fes It tivities are over, come with me to The Crags. co It is wild, blasted-not nice now-but it will im be better in the spring!" and, without waiting for an answer, Susan relapsed again into a  thought, forgetting that she had given the invi- wl tation.  Brighty had penetrated her secret. She Ra he   ht gazed on that pale and altered brow, those he wasted cheeks and hollow eyes-eyes grown )f twice their natural size through dilation of- he their pupils, and the emaciation of the face- lo upon that collapsed and quivering frame, and is turned abruptly away to hide the tears that ir suffused her eyes. Not for the world, by any d betrayal of her own sympathy, would she have 3- violated the sanctuary of her friend's sacred s delicacy. Recovering her own composure, she returned io Susan, and, by way of 'arousing t her, took her hand, and said cheerfully- "I thank you, dear Susan; and I accept your kind invitation very gladly." "It is a dreary waste, a bleak, desolate scene, Brighty, but it has the advantage of healthfulness," observed Susan, in some degree recovering herself. The dinner-bell rang, and the young ladies separated to arrange their dresses.  I had occasion to tell you once before, that wedding festivities in the country parts of Maryland and Virginia are conducted on quite a different plan'to that adopted in fashionable city circles. The^honeymoon, usually passed in solitude by fashionable city bride and groom, is here spent in a round of dinner-parties, balls, &c. It is an occasion of merry-making that quiet country people seize with great avidity and improve to its utmost extent. Thus our bride and bridegroom were kept in a continual whirl of dissipation for five weeks, which brought April before they were finally 'settled in their beautiful home of The Isle of Rays.   BOOK II.   CHAPTER I. There is a meekness in the upturned eyes, A tearful lustre-such as fancy lends To the Madonna; and a rapt surprise, As if it found strange beauty in the air. Park Benjamin. "Now, Susan, when we have breakfasted, I want you to show me all over this house; the shut-up old drawing-rooms, and the dilapi- dated old, bed-chambers; the attics; the cup- boards; the cuddies and all." ( Dear Britannia, the house is a ruin." "I have a romantic love of ruiis." "But, dear Brighty, this is not a ruined castle or manor-house, in the old world, but simply a dilapidated old farm-house in Vir- ginia. What becomes of your romance ", "Yet, I like it; it is nearly two hundred years old, it was erected in a time full of adventure; it must be rich in legendary lore, early Indian warfare, French warfare, revolu- tionary heroism. Anna, you take- an ardent interest in the heroism and adventures of the past, and the traditionary lore of Virginia is generally, I find,preserved in the old domes- tics of the family. Anna, your fathers have been in the service of the Somervilles for more than a hundred years; you have heard from your father, who heard from his grandfather, many a story; you can tell us of some heroic young Somerville who distinguished himself in the frontier war with the savages; of some young Captain Somerville, who raised a com- pany to fight against the French; of some young patriot among the Somervilles, who, after achieving miracles of valor, fell riddled with wounds upon the field of victory. You can tell me that, oh I Anna." "My father does, indeed, remember many anecdotes of the revolutionary war, and is well acquainted with many stories of the early set- tlement of the State; he delights to recall and repeat them; it would give him pleasure to do so, Miss 'O'Riley"   "Very well, then, Anna; to-night, after we have supped, we will have a blazing hickory -fire built in this great old chimney, and we will have a basket of nuts and apples, and George shall come in, and tell us tales of old times, like the retainer of some old feudal family, who delights to relate the heroic ex- ploits of the house." This conversation took place at the breakfst- table at The Crags, upon the morning after the arrival of Britannia O'Riley with Susan Som- erville, and six weeks from the marriage of Louise Armstrong. As soon as the young ladies arose from breakfast, Brighty, with a wish to arouse Su- san from the sad reveries into which she was continually relapsing, again renewed her desire to be shown over the house. "It is a wreck, Britannia-the other half of the building; a mere skeleton--a shell It is even dangerous to venture in when the wind ; is so high as it is now. Beams and rafters sometimes fall-old window shutters blow [ down-" "Happily, no one has ever yet been injured by their fall." "No-but you will be disappointed, Brighty." l  "It will serve me right, then, for obstinacy. C, ome." " With a slight expression of reluctance, Susan n laid aside her knitting, and led the way from a the large sitting-room into a wide, bleak hall, into which the wind poured, and through e which it roared, seemingly from every quarter, , through the broken plastering and gaping tim- I bers. They crossed this, and entered a large a apartment, once the saloon of the house, but now much dilapidated and rudely mended. ' This was once the saloon; and, on festive 1 occasions, was brilliantly lighted up, and filled t. with distinguished guests. Now you see what d it is; it serves at once the threefold purpose of o kitchen, workshop, and bedroom, for my old foster-parents."   Brighty surveyed the old and extensive apart ment with interest. It was a mixture of de parted grandeur and present poverty. -The lofty windows at both extremities of the room had been broken up, and were rudely repaired the places of some missing panes of glass had been supplied; some by pine shingles, some by tin plates, and some by pasted paper; but all was clean. The great arch that, after the manner of most old Virginian mansions, divi- ded the apartment in the middle, had been broken in many places. In -the back part of the room was a large arched fireplace, whose marble mantelpiece was covered with rude wooden candlesticks, and hung above with ,wooden ladles, spoons, bowls, &c., carved by George. On each side of this fireplace were rough shelves, put up by George, and laden with the commonest delf ware and pottery. Harriet was standing at one of these shelves, ,washing up her breakfast things. Half way down the middle of the long room, and against the end of -the arch, was a rough work-bench, with a pile of flags on one side, and a pile of bottomless chairs on the other. George was sitting there, engaged in putting a new bottom into an old chair. j On the other side of the arch, and at the farthest extremity of the room, was an humble bedstead, curtained withl blue check, and a poor old-fashioned chest of drawers, with a sloping lid.        t Oh! those memorials of old times, how dear they were to the poor family! On the other side of this chest of drawers was a large stock of baskets, mats, and chil- dren's little chairs, made of flags, by George. Britannia took all this in by one sweeping glance. She had seen Harriet several times since her arrival, but not George. Now she went up to George, and held out her hand to shake hands writh him. Brighty had a thorough respect for honest George. George lifted the old white felt hat he habitually wore, and stood up to speak to the young lady. Miss O'Riley examined and praised the neatness of his work, ordered a work-basket, and then fol- lowed Susan Somervillefrom the room.- "George supports us all by flag-work. Our land, the little of it that is left, is entirely worn out. We can scarcely raise vegetables and grain and fruit enough for our own small family consumption. But George has taken up this trade of flag-work, and contrives to make a living by it." Then they crossed a short -passage, and en-  tered a room, once the large dining-room of 6   t- the family, now a depository for sacks of corn, -- barrels of apples, bags of wool, hanks of yarn, e &c., and then passed through several ruined n apartments, and returning to the wide hall, ; went up the broad staircase to the second dstory. After having gone through nearly the e whole range  of upper rooms, "Now," said t Susan, "I will take you into my chamber." e  She then conducted Brighty into a large - room, in which was a tall tent-bedstead in an iarched alcove, and near it a cot-bed. This f room had neither carpet nor curtains, but the walls were, literally covered with old family portraits, all of them faded, tarnished, and unfit to be seen--that is, all were so, with rthe exception of one, which looked fresh and modern. "Ah  you are looking at my pictures, Brighty I Well, they too are wrecks, but I have not the heart to throw them away. They are unpresentable-therefore I keep them in my chamber 1" Brighty was, in fact, going from one picture to the other, examining them with an artist's interest. She paused before one; it was the fresh and modern looking portrait of which we spoke. It was the portrait of a young,. beautiful girl, with a dark, bright complexion, large, soft, dark eyes, and rippling black hair, flowing down in wavelets on her neck and' bosom. Brighty gazed on this picture with surprise, with deep interest. "Here is a portrait, at least, that would grace' your sitting-room, Susan!" "That I yes--but--" "Well!" "Nothing," replied Susan, with some embar- rassment. Britannia was suddenly silent, fearing that she had committed she knew not what indis- cretion, by asking questions. ' Susan perceived. this, and hastened to say- "It is the portrait of Genevieve, my father's youngest sister. She died young, and her death was sudden-tragical   My grandfather cannot bear to hear her name mentioned. He has not seen her picture for fifteen years." "I am sorry, Susan, that I recalled this cir- cumstance to your recollection," said Brighty, with interest. "And yet, what a strangely beautiful face! I it is ,a study. I should like to copy it."       . "I remember her-nothing like that por- trait--I remember her as one recollects a bad dream. She was pale, thin, nervous, and wild looking. She died at sixteen, when I was. three years -old . Now, Bfi$y, you are wel- ,   come to copy the portrait, but on these con- ditions-that you do it in this room,--that you never show the copy to any one in the State, and that you never mention her name or al- lutIc to her fate after to-day." "I promise with all my heart." ' This was her room," continued Susan, throw- ing open a second door. 4"But who would have thought of such a picture and such a story in this house, Susan?" asked Brighty. "Every house has its skeleton, Britannia; and I fear no house ever stood fifty years with- out its tragedy!" and Susan shuddered. "You are cold, Susan. I have been selfish in dragging you through all these passages and staircases, full of draughts. Come, we will go down." And the girls descended to the sit- ting-room. Faithfully determined to persevere in draw- ing Susan from her abstraction, and forcing her to occupy herself, even when seemingly seeking only her own selfish amusement, Bri- tannia adhered to her plans for their even- ings. As soon as the cloth was removed from the supper-table, Brighty, making herself at home, ordered a liberal supply of the heaviest hick- ory logs, and herself superintended the piling, upon the great iron fire-dogs. Oh! Brighty was an artist in the smallest matter, and she perfectly subscribed to the Virginian adage, that " a good fire is a handsome piece of -furni- ture." And a wonderful fire soon crackled, blazed, and roared up the chimney. And then the old sofa was drawn up on one side of the fireplace, and two or three chairs on the other side, and the table with the lamp on it wheeled to the middle. And then Brighty, fixing Susan with her knitting on the end of the sofa near- est the table,-seated herself by her side, and sent Anna to summon George to bring in his flag-work and his legendary learning. George soon appeared, bringing in his hands a half- finished basket and a bundle of flags, and,. drawing a stool to the opposite side of the fireplace from the sofa, sat down and prepared to commence. And thus the group around the hearth sat :-- On the old sofa on the left sat Susan and Britannia, Anna occupying a low seat by the side of Miss Somerville, with her hand resting affectionately on her lap. On the opposite side old Harriet sat, with a reel by her side, wind- ing yarn; George by her on a low cricket singling out his strip of flags. The table with the lamp dividing the two-little groups.   "Well, we are all ready," said Brighty. "Come, begin." "Hem! hem-m-m!" commenced    George, laying away his white felt hat. "Hem-m-m ! you see, Miss, when this part of the country was fust settled----" "Hush!" "Ma'am?" "Some one rapped," said Brighty. ( It was the wind," said Anna. "It was the rats," said Harriet. "You must expect to hear strange noises about this house, Brighty-not that it is haunt- ed, but that it is old, and filled with rats and mice, and exposed to the winds." "Go on, George," commanded Brighty. "Hem-m-m! Well, you see, Miss, when this part of the country was fust settled, the In- jins--" ' Rat-tat-ft-tat-ta-r-r-r 1" There was no doubt upon the subject now. The short, sharp, rasping rap of the metalhead of a riding whip against the door arrested George's legend, and startled every body; George laid aside his baskets and went to the door. "Who can it be, this time of night?' asked Brighty. "We are just about to see," replied Susan. George opened the door, threw it wide open, and announced- "General Stuart-Gordon." All arose to their feet. Britannia crimsoned -with pleasure, Lfancy. Miss Somerville ad- vanced with quiet courtesy to welcome her visitor-while George, gathering up his flags, and Harriet, taking up her reel, withdrew with Anna from the room. "Have you supped, General?" inquired Miss Somerville as soon as her guest was seated. General Stuart-Gordon was about to reply in the affirmative, and to beg that his young, hostess would not give herself any trouble --but, impelled by a second thought, he re-. plied- "I have not, Miss Somerville; and, as I have had a rather long and cold ride, I will feel particularly obliged for a cup of your excellent tea. And, Susan, my dear I prepare it your- self. I have a lively anrd grateful recollection of the tea you made for us at the Isle." Smiling faintly at the reminiscence, Susan arose and left the room. General Stuart-Gordon immediately left his seat, and, crossing ,before the fire, took that next- to Brighty on the sofa, took her hands in both his, and bending forward sought to -meet   her eyes. At last she raised her eyes and met his glance. "Well, Britannia!" "Well, General." "It is a blustering night." "Yes, sir." "More like the middle of March than the middle of April" "I agree with you, General." "Britannia, I have had a very cold ride facing the wind up this bleak ascent." "I regret it, sir." "Then prevent its frequent recurrence, Brighty." She was silent. "How many more such rides shall I have to take, Brighty!" She did not reply. "Britannia, I am more desolate than ever. Instead of gaining a daughter by the marriage of Louis, I have lost a son. I once had the  company of Louis. Now my son and daughter- in-law, absorbed in their own loves and joys- I the egotists!-forget my very existence. They c spend long hours in their own apartments, or, i coming out, wander hand in hand like two i; children, all over the Isle. The gardener and t his hands are breaking up the soil and trim-! o ming the rose-bushes and shrubs and vines of the gardens, and Louis and Louise, hand in hand, as I said, superintend their work. Then t they ride out together, read together, play y check together, and involuntarily look annoyed so if any person .innocently wishes to make a cc third in their diversions!"        ea "But, General, be reasonable; consider that cc this poor little bride and bridegroom have w been tantalized to death with company for six, h weeks past, have scarcely had a moment to themselves in which to cultivate each other's acquaintance. Be generous and indulge them," un smiled Brighty, who could reply to any thing do except the point at issue.         me "Very wellI Agreed.   Let them  amuse themselves. I do not complain of that! But, ele in the mean time, I am not enchanted with the ma delights of my own solitude."       me "You should read a sermon on contentment, tha General."                 Bri "Britannia 1" he said, pressing both her hands tha in both of his own; "Britannia, have I misun- derstood your kindness towards me for the last sub month?  If so, Brighty, I will not press upon smi you a suit that may be very unwelcome-the  c suit of a man passed middle age; for, above all all things, Brighty, I wish to secure your hap. lian! piness. I had dreamed to have secured it with eleg   met my own. Let it pass-it was but a dream, Brighty!" "General Stuart-Gordon." "I have misunderstood you." "General Stuart-Gordon, if you have un.- derstood ,me to be coldly disregardful of your the friendship, callously ungrateful for your kind- ness to me, then you have misunderstood me," ide  "Britannia I do I comprehend you? Is it possible, then, that you can love-" "General, I did not talk of love." ce,  "Oh, Britannia!" "You do not love me." "Britannia, I assure you--" ve  "You are, probably, past the age of loving me." "'Miss O'Riley--" or.  "-Or perhaps you should be." e   "Miss O'Riley, I affirm that this is very cool he on your part." r-  "General Stuart-Gordon, have patience with - me; you will be better pleased when I have y concluded. It is certain that you do not- love r, me, and I am constitutionally incapable of fall- o ing in love with any body; and therefore it is d that I can ring the changes on this word with- L out embarrassment:" "f  ' Madani!" "But you are lonesome--listless You expect n to live some thirty years in the world yet, and r you do not wish to pass that time either in d solitude, or, what is quite as bad, with a young L couple who are quite too much taken up with each other to attend to you. You want a t companion who shall be handsome; cheerful, , witty, elegant, and who shall be your oown, and  happy in that condition." "You are a singular girl: "Very singular in some matters, General H- unique even I  But, to return to the subject; do you expect that want of yours to be met?" "A companion, young, handsome, witty, gay, elegant, and kappy as the wife of an elderly man?  No, Britannia   You have convinced me. It was an unreasonable wish; yet, of that presumption I   have been guilty. No, Brighty, that want will never be supplied- that companion never be found." "  Then I suppose you consider me as a poor substitute for such a prodigy?" said Brighty, smiling, and averting her face. "Britannia! Britannia I you are more than all you have described as my dream-bril- liantly beautiful, sparklingly witty, of queenly elegance, and in the first bloom of your youth   -but, Brighty! dear Brighty! you could not be happy, (that is the requisite)-you could not be happy with me-could not love me!" "I am not in love with you, General Stuart- Gordon, any more than you are with me; pray do not insist upon my being so. It would be no compliment to you." "No compliment to me 1" "( No, sir 1 I only love when I pity and pro- tect! Do you want me to pity and protect you? I love your soft Louise, the gentle little Zoe, the quiet, simple Susan Somerville.  I love enough for my happiness. I have a greater want than that. It is to respect, admire, esteem! It is not necessary to my peace that I shall be in love with the gentleman who gives me his name-it is indispensable that I shall be able to honor him--that I shall be proud of him!" "And I then, Britannia?" "I honor you, General Stuart-Gordon!" "And Hlove you, Brighty!--love you-but I will not sacrifice you!" And he drew her to his bosom, and kissed her tenderly, and, rising, walked away. With his hands clasped behind his back, with his head bowed upon his breast, he slowly and thoughtfully paced up and down the room, heaving great sighs. At last he walked back towards her, took the seat by her side, took both her hands again in both of his, and bent forward, seeking her eyes again. She averted them, ,while, a deep blush overspread her face. Yet she did not withdraw her hands, which he continued to press. He spoke again, in deep serious, and earnest tones-and he said- "Britannia, I want you to be serious, and listen to me, my dear, for I am very serious. Two months ago, I admired you, and told you so. I loved you, Britannia, but dared not tell you so-dared not expose my earnest and devoted affection to your girlish scorn; for, Britannia, there is a sad, sorrowful diffidence in the love of the old for the young-and there- fore, Britannia, I offered you my hand, with- out speaking of my heart. I laid my name, rank, and fortune, at your feet, and thought that, by investing you with all my possessions, by surrounding you with every elegance and luxury that wealth could procure, that I might secure your happiness, and, with your society, my own happiness-I offered you my hand, and you refused it!" ".I would not marry only for wealth and rank, General." "I thought that a delicate, elegant, and re- fined girl, like you, would set a due value upon   the splendors and luxuries of life, and yet you refused me." "I would not marry only for splendor and luxury, General" "I thought, also, that a sensible girl like -you, seeing herself alone and unprotected in the world, would see the expediency of a pru- dent marriage, and yet you refused me." "( Because I would not marry for prudence, alias policy, alias selfishness, General Stuart- Gordon i" "You refused me, Britannia, and I did not press my suit--did not press it, because, as I said, there is a diffidence in the unselfish love of age, that youth does not even know. Brighty, had I been younger by twenty years, I should not so readily have resigned you. For Briglty, I loved you, loved you. I wished for your constant presence--I wished for your undivided affection; but more than all this, Brighty, I wished for your happiness; and see- ing your aversion to marrying an old man, I refrained from persecuting you with my ad- dresses. Now, hear me, Brighty. Within the last month you have seemed to have a softer cadence in your voice, a softer light in your eyes, as you looked at or spoke to me. This gave me new hopes-nay, hear me out, dear Britannia--and I came here this morning, full of foolish confidence, with the design of renew- ing my offer. - Stay, stay, Britannia! and hear me out. I came here to renew my offer; I see the repugnance it excites, and, Brighty, I withdraw. Do not believe, my dear, that I would annoy you. But, Brighty, since 1 have been sitting here, I have thought of another plan. Brighty, you are alone in the world, without the love of mother or sister, without the protection of father or brother; and with your rare beauty and refined tastes, you are exposed to all the dangers and hardships of a homeless and unsettled life. Brighty, listen to me, my dear. I have no daughter or sister; shall have ,no wife, since you refuse me; I have no female relative at all-and, Brighty, I want one. Since you cannot be my wife, be my daughter, Brighty. Forget that I ever dreamed of any other relation between us, and be my daughter, Brighty. I will regularly and legally adopt you. You shall come home to the Isle, and live with Louise, who loves you. Will you be my daughter, Brighty " "No, General Stuart-Gordon." "What! not even my daughter, Brighty!" "No, General Stuart-Gordon-but--" "Well '.r Britannia turned her blushing face quite   away from him, as she held out her hand. He carried it to his lips. "Well, Brighty?" "But--" "Well .l" "I will be your wife, if you will take a way- ward girl, whose pride and petulance makes her quite unworthy of you." "'  My own dear Brighty-my darling, spark- ling treasure! You-but how can you love me, Brighty F" And again, with that eager, anxious, scruti- nizing gaze, he sought the eye of Britannia. She turned her head away, saying softly- "Do not look at me so closely, for I wish to be frank with you, sir, because I owe it to you, and I shall not have courage to say all that is on my heart, if you look at me so." "There, then, Brighty. Now tell me, do you love me, can you love me, Brighty? Ah, I am so anxious upon that point, dear Britannia." Britannia answered in a low, trembling, but persevering voice. "I know you are anxious, because you are doubtful, sir; therefore, I force myself to speak. Yes, General Stuart-Gordon, I do esteem you. Do not think I would accept the high destiny you offer: me, without. You are covered with military glory, and I honor you for that. I am proud of you for that. I shall be proud to bear your name-to be your wife. You are the first-the only one who has ever opened the shelter of his heart to give me a home there, and I am grateful, deeply grate- ful for it, sir." "Yet, Britannia, my dearest child, esteem, honor, pride, gratitude, are not love." "And I would not marry for these only," said Brighty, in a very low voice. - "Then you dolove me, Brighty?" said the General, holding her hands, and bending for- ward to read her countenance. Now she turned the full light of her radiant face upon him, and looked up clearly, as she replied-  "My only friend and benefactor, at least I have no one but you to love."  "Alas, it is necessity, not choice, then Brigh. 1 ty!" "You have no peer, in my estimation, Gen- . eral Stuart-Gordon." : "Then why did you refuse me, Brighty?" C "From a little pride. and petulance, from a l little doubt of the reality and permanence of your affection for me."   .  "Oh, -Britannia!"           E "Sir, I have faults, very serious faults; I a   e  know them too well. But, alas, self-knowledge does not help me to self improvement. I am proud, vain, high-spirited, and extravagant; yet, in my heart, I do love humility, meekness, and moderation; yet, with all my faults, I am  sincere and grateful; and at least I bring you sa true and single heart, sir." "Your faults! my dearest Brighty-! I love you just as you are, my frank, ingenuous Brigh- ty. I love you for just what you are." Five minutes after this, Susan Somerville entered the room, followed by George, bearing the tea-tray. And General Stuart-Gordon took his tea, and shortly after took his leave, tender- ly shaking the hand of Susan, and fervently pressing that of Britannia. CHAPTER IL SPRING AT THE ISLE OF RAYS. Spring with its rose-buds!-Spring, The gladdest time in the capricious year, With its green foliage, and its sunlight clear, And with a drowsy tune Of the bright leaping waters as they pass Laughingly on amid the listening grass. W. H. Burley. OH, The Isle of Rays in Spring! It was a scene more enchanting than a poet's dream of Eden-a Mussulman's vision of Paradise. It was an elysium   of beauty, music, and fra- grance. It was a rapture merely to stand there in the morning's silvery flood, and breathe, though every other faculty were sus- pended. It was a heaven of beauty. The mansion, with its white freestone walls, and ,its piazzas above and below, supported by the light and elegant white marble pillars of the Corinthian style of architecture. Its terraces, with its beautiful shade-trees dropping shadows on the fresh and dewy grass; its parterres of flowers, of every form and hue; its lawn, with ser- pentine walks and meandering streams-with groves of trees and vine-clad arbors-.with the black shadows of its rocks, and the bright flashing of its waters, leaping, sparkling, and glancing in the sunshine-radiating streams of dazzling light. "The Isle of Light I The Isle of Sunbeamst The Isle of Rays!" would break inspired from the lips of the spectator. It was a heaven of music, when the full, . rich diapason of Nature's morning hymn was sounding there, from the lowest notes--the almost inaudible murmur of a foliage-hidden   stream, and the whispered confidences of the breeze wooing the leaves-to the clear, rip- pling, ringing song of the rivulet, and the shouting laughter of the cataract; and from the harmony'of the bee, beguiling the flowers, to the grand harmonic chorus of a thousand birds, breaking out in their rapture, till all the sun- bright air above seemed shattering with silvery sound, and the particles falling around you in a rain of radiant light and music. "The Isle of Harmony! The Isle of Music!" a blind one would exclaim, in delight. And it was an elysium of the breath of mil- lions of flowers. The delicate perfumne of the violet, the fine fragrance of the lily, and the rich aroma of the rose, mingled with the intox- icating'odors of the rarest exotics, filling with sweetness the sun-lit and music-freighted atmo- sphere of this Isle of Fragrance I The Isle of Rays I The Isle of Music! The Isle of Fragrance I The elysium of beauty, melody, and perfume! It was a rapture to stand and receive all this flood of beauty, har- mony, and fragrance! And Louis and Louise wandered through its groves and gardens, like another Adam and Eve through another Eden. And it delighted Louis to see how Louise revelled in the light of her new liberty. At last the elasticity of youth had thrown off the pressure of long habits of restraint. Her step became so free, so light, so fleet; the tones of her voice so high, clear, and cheerful; her laughter so gay and ringing! And, oh! Louis loved her more and more, for every good his love had brought herl He had feared that the long-fettered mind, the lorig- repressed affections of his little bride, would never escape from their captivity-never throw off their chains. But it was wonderful--de lightful-how soon Louise cast off the habit of restraint I How soon she chipped the shell, and fluttered out a jubilant and full-fledged singing-bird 1 How soon she emerged from the chrysalis, and flew off a joyous, radiant butterfly I And bow she loved Louis, as one who had given her freedom, happiness-new life! And how Louis loved her I How deep- ly, how profoundly; how much more deeply, how much more profoundly, as he saw her gladden and brighten in the light of his love I It was now that the depth and strength of his devotion to Louise was revealing to him the greatness of his own soul. He saw her happy in his affection-happy through his means- and he felt in his profoundest heart, that were the sacrifice of his life-yea, of his soul--de- manded as the price of her happiness, it would   be made. Sometimes he even regretted that every good she enjoyed was so readily at hand, that he was not required to toil for her. There is an intensity of idolatry in some love that cannot be expressed but by suffering for the beloved. This may be excess-insanity-fanat- icism-or it may be the profoundest religion; but it is truth-truth on earth. The deepest love cannot be satisfied but by sffering for the welfare of the beloved. The love of Louis for his bride was intense -profound-powerful. The love of Louise for her husband was only grateful, glad, and con- fiding. That was the difference between them. This was the under-current of feeling on both sides. Superficially they appeared like two children, wandering through the groves, or sitting together in the bowers, of The Isle of 'Rays. And the countenance of Louis would radiate joy, as his dancing eyes would follow the flying feet of Louise, when she would spring from his side to chase a bird or pluck a flower. That changed Louise! whom he remem- bered pacing in slow, lady-like steps through the lofty, cold halls of Mont Crystal! The enfranchised spirits of Louise electrified even the grave old General, who would sometimes catch his little daughter-in-law up in his arms and toss her until she laughed aloud! But for the most part General Stuart-Gor- don had the good taste to withdraw himself from the company of these newly-wedded lovers. Sometimes by shutting himself up in his library, sometimes by joining the hunt, of which he was still very fond, and sometimes by riding over his estate, and giving his personal attention to its management. But still more frequently his horse's head would be turned in the direction of The Crags. Thus happily passed the time at the Island Palace, until Mrs. Armstrong, at the invitation of Louis, came to pass a month with her daugh- ter. The presence of this haughty and frozen woman cast a cloud over the brightness of The Isle of Rays. She radiated a spiritual cold that chilled all who approached her. She had arrived in her coldest, hardest, and haughtiest mood; and all that she saw, heard, and felt there, aroused the most malignant passions of her soul. She saw Louise, instead of being pale and dispirited at her long absence, looking rosy and joyous; and if she did not hate the child for daring to be happy, except by her permission and through her means, at least she loathed -her daughter's husband, for superse- ding her in the work. ' Yes, she began to hate Louis in proportion as Louise loved him. And   sometimes she would look at Louise in aston- ishment, wondering that she presumed to be so free, so glad, in her presence! She grew alarmed for the permanency of her influence over her child's intellect and affections, "In one short month I have lost so much ground. In a year longer I shall be nothing in the sum of Mrs. Stuart-Gordon's life! And she is my child--MNE! Igave her life! Sle came into the world by my will-mine!   And who is this Louis Stuart-Gordon?. Perdition catch his soul I to come between me and the child I bore!"And deep in the heart of this woman, whose external appearance was so cold, so hard, so stern, whose manners were so guarded, so haughty, so freezing-deep in the heart of this diabolical woman burned and burned a con- cealed, intense, and growing jealousy, as under the snow-clad surface of Etna glow the most dangerous fires. "' I will not leave my child alone with these people another month," she said; " they shall not win her affections entirely from me. Louise is not the same being; in another five or six weeks, she is lost to me. I will remain with her. Yes, I will remain with her. I will marry tlis old creature-this old Stuart-Gordon. True, he is some fifteen years older than myself-true, this will be a descent on my part-that it is a grave departure from high self-respect in a woman of my mature age, to marry, under any circumstances; but I must maintain my authority over Louise  I must do it by residing with her; and I can only re- side with her as the mistress of this house and estate. I cannot take a subordinate position in the house of my daughter and son-in-law. I must make up my mind to marry this old Stuart-Gordon. The neighborhood, 1Z presume, will have a great deal to say upon the subject, when it is known to be in prospect. Let them say it I If I can gain my own consent to the step, the opinions of others are unimportant, as they are impertinent.  Moreover, these opinions will only be whispered in subdued tones; none will be found daring enough to raise their voices against any act of mine. After all, this will be only an alliance. It will give me almost absolute power over this estate; for, once mistress here, I shall do as I i please with the old man, with his son, and I will see if the affairs of this estate will not be better administered by me; than they have I ever been by this fox-hunting and dinner- i giving bon-vivant, or this flute-playing, verse- a making sentimentalist 1 The government of r two such estates as those of Mont, Crystal and I   - he Isle of Rays-estates that, joined, form i half the county, will give me as large a share v of power, ay, and more absolute power, than a that enjoyed by any petty sovereign in Eu- i rope. Come I it is decided I I will form an  alliance with this old GeneraL"And recog- inizing no appeal from her own high will, the , arrogant woman set about the execution of her purpose. She became very exacting of atten- itions from General Stuart-Gordon, pressing him with. commanding haughtiness into her service upon all occasions. She never arose to ,cross the room, without saying, with the air of an empress ordering her chamberlain--"Gen- eral, I will trouble you for the support of your arm." She made him fetch and carry her fan, reticule, and knotting, open and shut doors, hand her water, pick up her handkerchief, and do her errands, and all with the air of confer- ring a great honor upon his Generalsliip. The climax was in the evening, when she would command him to open the chess-board, and play a game of chess with her. General Stuart-Gordon, gallant, good-natured, and at leisure, was very much at the command of any lady who would do him the honor of ex- acting his services.,. Besides which, he had a very great respect for Mrs. Armstrong, both upon account of her imposing rank, character, and deportment, and by reason of her position as his guest. In addition to his universal gal- lantry and particular devotion, General Stuart- Gordon had two very important reasons for employing and conciliating Mrs. Armstrong. First, lie saw that her surveillance over Louis and Louise impaired their happiness, and he wished to deliver his children, as he called them, from  her espionage, by absorbing her attention himself. Secretly, he stood in great awe of Mrs. Armstrong; he felt a presentiment that she would be horrified and outrageous at the news of the projected marriage between himself and Miss O'Riley, and he wished to conciliate her good feeling before he should dare to announce it. And as the marriage was already appointed and approaching, this an- nunciation was an imperative necessity. Ah I little did he dream of the matrimonial designs of the lady herself upon him I Old gentlemen see nothing improper or unusual in their own connubial intentions, are grievously shocked when they hear of any such projects finding a lodgment in the brain of an elderly lady. This feeling may be natural and right. General Stuart-Gordon, then, never suspected the drift of Mrs. Armstrong's thoughts and purposes. He was charmed that she treated him .well,   with kindness, with sympathy; and as days passed, and as every day saw them somehow better friends, he did not despair of her con- sent to his marriage with Miss O'Riley. And this consent was of more-importance to the General than any one at first thought would suppose; for General Stuart-Gordon loved family peace and good fellowship above all things-except Brighty! Encouraged by Mrs. Armstrong's gracious and condescending man- ners, he began to feel his way, as it were, to- wards an explanation. Finding himself alone with the dowager in the morning, when Louis and Louise would be roaming about the garden, or reading poetry in their room, he would begin to say something pathetic about the solitude of his position, for- getting-the egotist!--that the lady to whom he spoke was just precisely in the same pre- dicament as himself, and therefore extremely likely to misapprehend the drift of his dis- course. And so he would say very moving things about his loneliness-very touching things about going down the vale of years alone-expecting to move Mrs. Armstrong's pity for his condition, and by and by win her consent to his marriage. And Mrs. Armstrong, totally misunderstanding his purpose and mis- applying his words, would receive these con- fidences with much more indulgence than he could have hoped to obtain. Nay, Mrs. Arm- strong would fully agree with General Stuart- Gordon, that it was a serious thing to be left alone in the decline of life-that as young people would take to themselves partners and leave their parents alone, it behooved the latter to secure companions on the down- ward journey of life. And it was wonderful upon what good terms they would part after just such confidences as these-each misunder- standing the other very thoroughly! General Stuart-Gordon would step off on tiptoe, as though he trod on air, thinkingU:is paths made straight before himl Mrs. Armstrong would sail out with her stately mien, and assume an extra degree of authority over Louise, Louis, the negroes, the mansion, and the estate-fully believing this authority to be but slightly anticipated. The decisive hour arrived. General Stuart- Gordon was to be married in a month; and no one, as yet, suspected it. It was now ab- solutely necessary that the announcement of this approaching marriage should be made. One morning, immediately after breakfast, Louis and Louise as usual left the house. They   were to take the boat and have a little voyage. Mrs. Armstrong sailed majestically into the drawing-room, and seating herself in one of the high-backed chairs near the front windows, took out her knotting and commenced work. The door opened, and General Stuart-Gordon, having screwed his " courage to the sticking- place," stalked superbly down the room, and, drawing a chair opposite to that of the dow- ager, sank into it, and-and-unluckily forgot the speech-a piece of the most convincing logic and the most subduing eloquence ever composed-that he had prepared to conquer Mrs. Armstrong with. Hie found nothing to say but that which he had said a hundred times already, namely- "You perceive that those young people have left us alone again, madam! the egotists-the egotists! They forget every one else-every thing else-except themselves, and the pres- ence of nature!" "Happiness is selfish, sir," replied the laconic lady. Silence-a deep pause-a great sigh from General Stuart-Gordon, who breaks the spell by saying, pathetically- "It is a dreadful thing to be alone, madam.' "It is, sir." "Ah! dreadful!" "Yes, sir." Silence again-another pause-expectancy on the side of the lady--embarrassment on the part of the gentleman, who again finds courage to speak in moving tones, saying--- "Togo down the vale of years alone, Mrs. Armstrong!" "Certainly, sir." "Is a deplorable prospect!" "Undoubtedly; General." "Ah!" "I perfectly agree with your view of the case, General." "To have no gentle female friend to smooth the pillow of-the pillow of-of--" Silence a third time-the lady out of patience -the gentleman out of courage. The lady at last comes to his assistance- "I am  surprised, General Stuart-Gordon, that you, who do not like the loneliness of your life, should never think of takincg a consort." "Madam t oh!" "That you should never think of marrying." "Mrs. Armstrong, if I presumed, if I thought, if I hoped--" "Well, sir V" "If i araed to hope-" "Well, sir!"   "In short, madam, I have dared to hope your approbation to my suit. H" A pause. "I listen, sir." "In one word, madam, I have selected a lady," said General Stuart-Gordon, in an earnest tone of voice, looking intently at the dowager, who kept her eyes fixed upon her knotting. "I await your further explanation, sir." "A lady of the finest intellect, of the highest spirit, of the most dignified manner-" "You are extravagant, I fear, sir." "A lady in whose praise no terms of admi- ration could be thought extravagant." "You are an enthusiast, General." "A lady worthy of the highest honor." "Your panegyric is embarrassing, sir." "A lady who has my whole heart's affection -my whole head's approval." A pause. "I listen to you, sir." "A lady who will be singularly acceptable to my dear daughter iri-law-one bound to her by the ties of affection-one bound to her by the obligations of gratitude-one whose care and instruction has contributed to make Louise what she is--one with whom it will delight Louise to pass her whole existence-one be- loved, idolized by Louise." "And this lady--" "Is one whom Mrs. -Amstrong cannot for a moment be at a loss to designate," said General Stuart-Gordon, in a deep, earnest tone of voice, and looking intently in the face of Mrs. Arm- strong. Mrs. Armstrong arose, with an air of ma- jestic grace, and, standing, placed her hand, within that of General Stuart-Gordon, and said :--  '; Sir, I cannot, as you have asserted, be at a ( loss to designate the lady whom   you have ( honored by your preference-and I thank you in the acceptance of your overtures I Do not, however, suppose by that I receive all the ex- travagant encomiums that you have been so polite as to lavish upon me. I listen to them E merely as the stereotyped compliments gentle- men are pleased to pay upon these occasions. I will, however, dispense with them from this t time, sir, as we are rather mature to make or receive gallant speeches. Nevertheless, there l is a singular propriety in your selection, and a most becoming fitness in our alliance, sir. The n house of Blackistone and of Armstrong, like n that of Cartwright and Stuart-Gordon, is one of the oldest in the country. I shall not dis-   honor the old and haughty name of Stuart- Gordon;" and, bending her head graciously, the lady was sailing majestically from the room, when--- I wish you could have seen the countenance of General Stuart-Gordon, as his face blanched and blanched, his head grew dizzy, his back grew weak, and his knees smote together. Here was -a catastrophe I In truth, the sky was falling. He felt the fragments shattering his nerves. With an adjuring gesture of de- spair and desperation, he advanced towards her- "; rs. Armstrong." "Well, sir?" said the lady, turning quietly around. "My dear madam." "Well, sir?"   \ "I am covered with confusion." "I do not understand you, sir." "Madam I my dear lady I you have misun- derstood me." "Sir " "Excuse me! you have mistaken my mean- ing." "Sir?" "Forgive me! I never presumed to the dis- tinguished alliance of Mrs. Armstrong." "Sir!" "Pardon! pardon! The lady of my choice does not occupy so high a place in society. The lady of my choice--" "Is-" "Miss Britannia O'Riley!" Words would fail to express the dumb- founded astonishment, the astounded dismay, of that haughty woman, struck statue-still, with wonder, where she stood I Yes I at first it was simple stupefied wonder that fixed her there, with rigid limbs, pallid cheeks, and darkly corrugated brows. Yes, it was won-. der, before it was even rage or vengeance. "BRITANNIA O'RILEY  "Britannia O'Riley." "A governess! a domestic! a hired servant 1" "Britannia O'Riley I a beautiful, graceful, elegant, and accomplished woman." "A beggar I a low Irish beggar!" "A lady I a lady to whom I shall be proud to give my name." "A poor, miserable Irish beggar, whom I hired to serve my daughter!" "My intended wife, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, se. nior, and mistress of my house within one month from this." "Are you dreaming-insane-intoxicated'" "Madam, I should lay myself under the   suspicion of being influenced by one of the three states, if I permitted you for one mo- ment longer to indulge in the intemperate lan- guage you have just used." "General Stuart-Gordon, I shall leave your house." "Mrs. Armstrong, I trust you will see the absolute, the inevitable necessity of your leaving this house before the arrival of my wife." "Am I to be insulted-outraged-under the roof of my daughter?" "No, madam I nor are you to insult or out- rage the intended wife of her husband's fa- ther." "Enough! I leave this house to-morrow, and my daughter returns to Mont Crystal with "Madam 1" "My daughter came hither a bride-entered this house as its mistress. She should not have entered it upon any other terms--she shall not remain in it in any other capacity. She shall not cede her place, and give pre- cedence to a low-born Irish serving-wench." "My wife will be mistress of my house without a doubt, madam.   And Mrs. Louis will certainly give precedence to Mrs. Stuart- Gordon, as becomes her." "Indeed, sir I You forget that Louis Stu- art-Gordon inherits The Isle of Rays in right of his mother, Margaret Stuart-Gordon-not in right of the man who bartered his patro- nymic for a fortune I That, therefore, Louis Stuart-Gordon is master of the estate and mansion-house, as his wife is mistress of the same." "I think you have been misinformed upon some of these points, madam, I think you will find yourself seriously mistaken." "Sir! my daughter and myself have too much self-respect to stride for precedence with an Irish waiting-maid, or the dotard whom her cunning has enslaved. My daughter r-eturns with me to Mont Crystal." "You return alone, madam! Mrs. Louis re- mains where she is." d "We shall see, sir 1" exclaimed the lady, purple with rage. "We shall see, madam!" replied the Gen- eral, bowing ceremoniously, as he held the door open for her to pass through.   CHAPTER III A PARLOR - STORM. Her's was not that blind, capricious rage, A word can kindle and a word assuage; But the deep workings of a soul unmixed With aught of pity where its wrath had fixed. Byron, MRS. ARMSTRONG reached her chamber, and by a peal of bells brought Kate Jumper to her presence- "Have Mr. and Mrs. Stuart-Gordon left the shores of the Island yet?" "Yes, madam." "How long since?" "An hour, madam." "Do you know what direction they took?" "Up the river towards the falls, madam." "It is too late and too far to recall them. You may go!-stay!" "Madam 1" "Go into Mrs. Stuart-Gordon's room and pack up her wardrobe. We return to Mont Crystal to-night." "Yes, madam." "And, observe, be silent upon this matter." "Yes, madam." "When you have completed the packing of Mrs. Stuart-Gordon's wardrobe, return hither to pack up my own. Go!" And thus dismissing her attendant, the lady seated herself in stern calmness by the window, and took out her knotting. The tall mulatto stalked on to the apartments of the bride, to execute her mistress's orders; The suit of apartments appropriated to Louis and Louise consisted of one bed-chamber, be- tween two dressing-rooms, and connected with them. The dressing-room assigned to Louise was fitted up in the most costly and elegant style. It was a front room on the second floor, and its two tall windows overlooked the ter- race, lawn, river, the opposite bank, and the bride's own home, Mont Crystal. Between these two high front windows hung a tall cheval-mirror-and the windows and the mir- ror were curtained and festooned with blue silk and white lace, tied up with ribbons, and wreaths of violets. The carpet on the floor and the paper on the walls were- of the same color and pattern-blue violets running over a white ground. The bureaus, wardrobes, dressing-tables, &c., were all of that beautiful white satin-wood that looks so much like ivory. When Kate Jumper stalked into this room, she found it already occupied by a little, old, short, thick-set negress, who was not employ-   ing herself by setting the room in order, but amusing herself by trying on bne of her young mistress's exquisite little French hats, and view- ing with much self-satisfaction the effect of the soft white velvet and delicate white plumes surrounding a face black, shining, seamed, and wrinkled as a dried prune. This was Seraphina, the wife of Apollo, and the nurse and waiting-maid of all the Mis- tresses and the Misses Stuart-Gordon for the last fifty years-now the personal attendant of Louise. "Good morning, Mrs. Jumper," said the seraph, laying off the white hat and feathers indifferently. Kate Jumper disdained to answer, except by a short nod, and, striding up past the Abigail, she took the bunch of keys from the dressing- table, and began to unlock the bureaus- "What are you going to do, Mrs. Jumper?" The mulatto did not think it worth while to reply. "I say there! I say there! don't tech them Brissles laces and ribbons! I never-'low any body to tech 'um but myself. I say! why don't you hear me? why don't you stop? Are you crazy? Stop o' rummidgin' my missis's thingumies--will you? Here, give me the keysI -I never seen sich impidence in all my life! You must be cractedl Here gim me them keys!" and, running and waddling to- wards her, the little womnan possessed herself of the disputed keys with a sudden jerk. Kate Jumper, without speaking, quietly held out her hand to get them again. Seraph hugged them  under her fat chin with both hands. With a silent but peremptory gesture, the mulatto started to her feet, and demanded their return. "I won't! I shan't! Set you up with it, indeed! Rummidgin' my young missis's draw- ers! You don't look like the mos' honestest i person in the- worl' no how! I don't know 1 nuffin 'bout your correcter."       E With a quiet, quick dart of her hand, the 1 mulatto gripped her talons around the throat v of Seraph, and choked her until she grew full  in the face, and dropped the keys; then, draw- - ing her towards the door, she silently thrust 1 her out, closed the door, and locked it on the I inside.                 \ All this passed so quietly that one in the t next room would not have known what was i( going on.                 a Seraph, on the floor outside the door, con- g vulsed, heaved, spluttered, sneezed, coughed, f and recovered herself-          I   it "The Lof' a massy upon me I Dis is wuss g 'an de landin' o' de British. I say in dere! '- you nonation 1 I'd holler murder, only I won't e make a 'fusion to 'sturb de family. But I'll s have you put in jail for 'salt and batterin' me! i an' for abreakin' open of my missis's drawers. Oh, you won't speak! Never you min'! you'll 1 see I you good for nothin' poor white man's - darter you!" e  There! that was the most insulting taunt a t pure-blooded Virginia negro could cast upon a mulatto. And, haviing spent the force of her a fury on this last expletive, Seraph gathered her- $ self up and waddled down stairs, leaving Kate Jumper to go on with her packing. Kate pursued her task until she had com- pleted it, even to the strapping of the trunks, and then, taking with her the buncli of keys, she went otit of the room, locked'the door to prevent the re-entrance of her antagonist, Seraph, and took the keys to the chamber of Mrs. Armstrong. She found that lady still seated at the window, knotting with apparent composure. ( Have you done ]" "Yes, madam, every thing is packed and ready. and Mrs. Stuart-Gordon's shawl and hat are laid out upon the bed for her to wear. Here are the keys." t"Very good! I shall keep- my room until dinner. When Mrs. Stuart-Gordon ret;rns, let her know that I expect her here. Now, go!" And she went on very quietly with her knotting. By no outward sign could the most suspicious and acute observer have detected the fell determination of this pitiless mother. There she sat by the open window, watching the summer sun slowly decline, unmindful, un- conscious of the resplendent beauty of the scene stretched out before her--a landscape whose gorgeous glory would have caught the breath from any otter beholder. There she sat, watching the sun's splendid descent, impa- tient for its setting, which would bring Lduis and Louise home, and hasten the hour o'll her departure with her daughter-the hour of her vengeance. There she sat, resolved, though' knowing how much Louise loved Louis-ay, and hating her for thus loving him-knowing how this separation would torture Louise, and taking a secret and diabolical pleasure in the idea of the torture-smiling grimly to herself at the thought of this separation-smiling grimly at the thought that Louise should suffer for having thus transferred her affections-that Louis should be agonized for having won from   herself this love-that General Stuart-Gordon should be humiliated for having doubly morti- fied her, in the disappointment of her ambi- tious projects both for herself and her daughter. This signal separation and its cause would lay his pride in the dust. For herself, she was too really and essentially proud to care what construction might be put upon her actions. She sat there, stern, erect, resolute, deter- mined, but calm, except when occasionally that diabolical grin distorted her features, going on with her knotting without dropping one stitch, or missing one mesh. At last, when the sun had sunk behind the mountain, and when the slanting shadows had stretched quite across the river, darkening the whole scene, a rap was heard at her door, and soon after Kate Jumper entered-- "Mrs. Stuart-Gordon has just returned, mad- am, and is coming up to her room to change her dress for dinner. Let me have the keys." "Did you deliver my message to her?" "Yes, madam; but she prefers to dress first." "Louise pays very litt!e regard to my wishes since her marriage," thought the mo- ther, bitterly; then she said, "Go and tell Mrs. Stuart-Gordon that I ase waiting for her here." The woman had scarcely left the room before the light step and clear voice of Louise was heard tripping and singing up the stairs, a merry, trilling quadrille air. The dancing and the singing abruptly ceased as she reached the door of her mother's apartment, and rapped before venturing to enter.  "Come in, my daughter 17" said the voice of the lady, in kinder tones than those she usually employed in speaking to her child, or to any one else in fact. Louise opened the door softly, and entered the room. "You have a very unlady-like manner of entering a house and ascending a flight of stairs, my daughter. I am pleased, however, that your boisterousness moderated a little as you neared my door." "Dear mother, Louis loves to see me merry -encourages me to be wild; and indeed I lately have a tendency that way, so that I sometimes forget you-" "Oh, I have no doubt in the world that you forget me. It was not that, however, of which I wished to speak to you. Come and sit by my side, Louise." ,The girl took the indicated seat, the foot- stool at her mother's feet, and laying her arms *   over her mother's lap, looked up into her face to see what she was about to say. "Do you love me, Louise?" asked the lady in a serious tone. "My dear mother I would you only let me love you!" 1"Yet for a month past you have neglected and forgotten me for a comparative -stranger." This was partly true, as under all the cir. cumstances it was very natural. This was true, and Louise could not deny it. She was con- science-stricken and pricked to the heart. She was silent. "Yes! my child has ceased-to love me-my child has forsaken her mother for a compara-' tive stranger!" Louise hung down her fair head, and the tears began to gather in her eyes and roll down her cheeks. "My child, that I bore and nursed-that I brought up and educated-that I never would send from me, even to sleep-my only child has ceased to love me." The tears of the daughter were falling fast. She was subdued by the thought that her mother-her proud, lofty mother-should bend thus a supplicant for a share in her child's heart. "Yes, she has ceased to love her mother: her mother, whose wffole and sole thought has been for her welfare alone." Louise, filled with remorse, had no power of replying. "Yes, she has ceased to love me-me, who remained through all the best years of my life unmarried for her sake; she has ceased to love me, and I am- desolate-a widow, childless, and desolate." Here, with her deep knowledge of human nature, she purposely touched a chord at which the bride's and the daughter's heart vibrated to the quick. With the one idea of the young wife, the one idea of wedded love filling her mind, she suddenly recollected that her mother was-,a widow, and her whole soul filled with an overpowering tenderness of love and pity, and casting her arms around her mother, she exclaimed- "A widow! Oh, my dear, dear mother, for- give me that I never thought of that before! A widow I Oh, my mother, I never knew how much sorrow was in that word before! 'A widow I Oh, my poor mother, how much, in- deed, you must have suffered 1 A widow! Oh, may the Lord in mercy preserve me from ever becoming-a widow I And a shudder ran through all her frame.   "Oh, my dear mother, I do love -you, will love you, all that you will let me. It is sweet to be permitted to love you so, mother." Mrs. Armstrong soothed. and caressed her child. Had this tenderness in the mother been a customary thing, it would not then have pos- sessed such all-subduing power over Louise. It was the long-desired, unhoped love, that, suddenly manifesting itself, completely sub- jected the will of the daughter. And Mrs. Armstrong pressed her to her bosom, smoothed back her golden hair, and kissed her snowy brow, while Louise would murmur softly- "Oh, it is so sweet to have you love me so, mother--mother"-lingering over the last word, "mother," slowly, with ineffable tenderness. Suddenly, Mrs. Armstrong said to her, very gravely- "Now, my daughter, I have something very serious to say to you." ( Say it, my dear mother." "Louise, I have been insulted, outraged." "Insulted 1 outraged ". repeated Louise, look- ing up in astonishment. "Yes, my daughter." "Insulted! you ." she exclaimed, raising her- self up in a sitting posture, and gazing at her mother in amazement. "Mother, you I Who has dared?" "General Stuart-Gordon; no less a person." "General Stuart-Gordon!" reiterated Louise, in stupefied wonder. "(eneral Stuart-Gordon." "He! Mother I am thunderstruckl Mother, am I awake? Shake me, mother." "You are awake, Louise." "And sane?-am I sane, mother W' "And sane, Louise." "It seems to me that I have the nightmare I I wish I could rouse myself. General Stuart--" "My dear child, listen; I will tell you all about it. General Stuart-Gordon informed me yesterday that he was about to be married--" "To be married 1" "My dear child, pray cease these vexatious exclamatory repetitions, and listen to me. Yes, he informed me he was about to be married to Britannia O'Riley--" "Britannia O'Riley I what! Brighty coming here? Oh-" "Once more, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon-I mean, my dear Louise--I must entreat you to cease repeating my words; it impedes and embar- rasses me. Well, General Stuart-Gordon in- formed me, as I, said, of his approaching   marriage with Miss O'Biley. Louise, what do you think of this marriage!" "I cannot believe it. It cannot be true." "Why not-" "It is too unlikely." "Upon what account?-Miss O'Riley's want of birth-fortune?" "Oh, no; that is nothing." "What, then?" "Why, Brighty's a girl, and General Stuart- Gordon is an old gentleman. Oh, you know, of course, mother, it was a joke; that was a joke; though I admit that it was almost in- sulting to jest with you about it, mother." "My dear, it was no joke; it was truth. This marriage is to come off in a month." "No, mother, no; it must be a mistake. It cannot be true." "I tell you that I am assured of it beyond a possibility of a doubt. Besides, I am not apt to be mistaken in any thing, my daughter." "But poor, dear Brighty, then-dear, bril- liant, sparkling Brighty-to be lost so." "And that is the light in which you view it, Louise. You, had you been never so poor, could not have married an old man?" Louise shuddered and paled. "Oh, mother, don't; it makes my blood run cold," exclaimed Louise, who fully believed her- self the type of all womankind in this respect. "Poor Brighty, dear, radiant Brighty, to be so extinguished. Mother, dear mother, tell her not to have him. Save her." "I cannot, unfortunately. Miss O'Riley is very capable of marrying a dotard for the sake of attaining a brilliant position. Your sym- pathy is besides quite thrown away upon Miss O'Riley, who is a clear-headed, cold-hearted, selfish, and calculating woman, who will be happy in her destiny." "A brilliant position I so is that of the. Hindoo suttee a brilliant position, and one, it strikes me, as being as great an immolation as the other. Dearest mother, since you are so kind, and permit me to speak go freely, let me entreat you to talk to General Stuart-Gordon on this subject. Beg him not to take advan- tage of Brighty's poverty, and her love of ele- gance, and her inexperience. Tell him Brighty  is nothing but a bit of a girl," continued the little matron, " tell him that she will griev- -ously repent it. Tell him to be magnanimous, magnificent. princely. Tell him to adopt Brighty as his daughter; to bring her here and make her feel at home among us. Tell him, if he wants to marry, to find some lady near his own age, who will not be compelled to   wish him dead all the days of his life, and to leave poor Brighty alone to seek her own share of this world's life, love, and joy." "You are very much changed, Louise!" said her mother, in surprise-" very much changed. Who would have supposed that you had- reflected so much-that you would have confidence to give utterance to,Jyour reflec- tions?" "Mother, it is dearest Louis! Hei talks with me, and encourages me to talk. He listens to me-stimulates me to think. Oh, mother, I have thought more, heard more, talked more, and lived more, in the last month, than in all my passed existence 1 I seem to have received an impulse-to have taken a new start in life. The vista of a universe seems opening before me; my soul seems to have dropped its fet- ters-escaped its prison-and rev tis in liberty and light. And Louis has given me this new life, mother!"The brow of the lady darkened.- "And that is the reason, mother, why I do so pity dear Brighty. She closes upon herself the prospect of a happiness like mine"-ar- rested by a feeling of bashfulness, Louise sud- denly stopped in the full-flowing stream of her confidences, and blushed. Soon she recovered her composure and said, 1"You will speak to General Stuart-Gordon about this, will you not, my mother?" "My daughter, it was of that I wished to talk to you. I have spoken to him upon this subject." "And he '" "Became offended." "And-" , "Used offensive language to me." "Mother 1" "Violent language, Louise."' "Mother!" "Ordered me to quit his roof." "MOTHER I NO!" exclaimed Louise, starting to her feet, as the blood rushed to her brow. "Be calm, my daughter. Be composed ; be lady-like. Remember yourself. Recollect that all such manifestations of feeling are vulgar. Be quiet-you see that I am." "O , my dear mother I but you have been outraged!" said Louise, bursting into tears. "My daughter, let us talk composedly. It 1 is certain that I cannot remnain here In "Nor I, mother 1" "What do you say, Louise?" inquired the t mother with surprise and delight, thinking her av paths made very straight before her. "What a do you say, Louise?"            3 "I say that I cannot stay here, mother 1" t   O  "Explain my daughter." "Could I remain under the roof of a house from which my mother has been driven? No, ' mother, no I Louis will not expect it. Louis i will not desire it. Louis will respect a daugh- i ter's feelings. I will entreat him to hire a B house and take me hence. We will leave this  gorgeous palace to General Stuart-Gordon and any lady he may be pleased to set over it, and we will go into some humbler house, in which, , at least, my mother can be safe from insult, and secure of respect." "A new, revised, and improved edition of love in a cottage," sneered the lady, but quick- ly remembering that her cue was love and con- fidence, she replied, " my daughter, I thank you; but this plan of yours is impracticable 1" "Impracticable!" "Yes, my daughter I Louis is just eighteen. He yet wants three years of his majority. Until that period arrives, he has not a dollar but what his father gives him.   When that period arrives,. he is in possession of all this vast estate. Until that period arrives, he has no means of hiring a house, or servants, or in any way supporting himself or his wife, apart from his father." "Oh, Heaven! what shall I do?" "You cannot, of course, remain under a roof from which your mother has been expelled!" Louise did not reply. "You do not think of it, I trust, my daughter." Louise was weeping silently. "Why do you not answer, my daugh-, ter? You do not think of remaining here after I have been thrust forth." "Mother, I cannot leave Louis!" "My child has ceased to love me--my only child!" Here followed the same line of argument, the same logic, eloquence, and passion-the same pathos about the widowhood, the solitude, the desolation-that had melted the heart of Louise in the first of this scene. It subdued her again, and more completely than before. While she laid her head, sobbing, upon her mother's lap, she asked, "What am I to do, then, mother I Tell me what I am to do?" "Return with me this evening to Mont Crys- tal 1" "Mother I mother 1" "If Louis loves you, he will follow you thither. I will invite him to remain, and we will all live there together until the majority of Louis puts him in possession of the Island Estate and The Isle of Rays. Will you agree to this, Louise i" \h   "Mother 1" ( Will you return with me this evening to Mont Crystal " "Mother, my heart is breaking, but I will do it." "You promise this?" "I promise it." "God bless you, my daughter." "God pity me, my mother." The ringing of the dinner-bell aroused them. "Will Jou go down, mother?" "No, my daughter." "And I, then, mother-what shall I do?" "Go and prepare for your journey, my daughter; and when you are ready, meet me in the drawing-room." Louise left the room, weeping. "Dinner waits, madam," said a servant, rap- ping softly at the door. "Let it wait," was the curt reply of the lady, who was adjusting the folds of her ample black velvet cloak. In a few minutes more, Mrs. Armstrong, in full carriage costume, descended into the hall. General Stuart-Gordon advanced from the drawing-room to meet her. "Mrs. Armstrong, I have come to solicit your pardon for the intemperate words uttered in my excitement of this morning. Will you honor me by accepting the support of my arm to the drawing-room, in token of forgiveness?" said he, in a deep, earnest, and deprecating tone and manner. "Sir!" replied the lady, drawing her majestic figure up to its full height; "I bear no malice towards beasts, idiots, or dotards ; I only pro- tect myself from their violence in future." With a grave, deep bow, General Stuart- Gordon receded, and allowed her to 2ass. "I ordered my carriage at five o'clock. You will be so good as to see if it waits, sir?" she said in the arrogant tone of an offended despot speaking to a slave, as she sailed on. "Certainly, madam, with pleasure," replied the General, with a second and deeper bow. She entered the drawing-room, and stood there waiting until Louise should join her. She had not long to wait. Louise soon entered, arrayed for her ride in a white crape shawl, white bonnet and veil Her veil was down, to hide her flowing tears. "Your carriage attends you, madam," an- nounced General Stuart-Gordon, re-entering the room.                 ] "Are you quite ready, my daughter?" in- quired the lady.             1 "Yes, quite ready, mother; but, oh I I must   see Louis first. I have not seen him for an hour--not since we returned from rowing. I do not know where he can be," replied the bride, in a distressing tone. "Where are you going, Louise " inquired the General, walking up to his daughter-in- law. "Home with mother 1" she murmured, sink- ing weeping into a chair. "May I inquire, Mrs. Louis, if your husband is advised of this proceeding on your part T" "No, sir." "'And you leave this roof without his knowl- edge or consent?" "Oh! sir," murmured the poor little girl, in an almost inaudible voice, "I cannot find him. My mother-alone-insulted-all the child she has got-how could you 2" and melted into a sea of tears. "SIR, address your conversation to ME, who well know how to answer you-and do not browheat the child, like a dastard!" exclaimed -Mrs. Armstrong, striding up, and placing her- self between them, and in front of Louise. "Then, madam, I desire to know the mean- ing of all this." "It is very plain, sir. My daughter-returns with me to Mont Crystal." "And for what purpose, and to what end?" "To reside henceforth under my own roof." Here Louise raised her tearful face from the handkerchief in which it was buried, and looked up with surprise. General Stuart-Gordon's brow grew hard and stern, as that of the lady to whom he -spoke, as he replied- "And I say, madam, that Mrs. Louis does not stir out of this house without her hustand's permission being first obtained." "HaI ha! we shall see.   Give me your arm, my daughter!" "Lay off your bonnet and shawl, Louise l" commanded the General, in a tone so stern and peremptory, that the poor girl started, and instinctively and hurriedly obeyed. "My daughter, are you mad? What are you doing? Resume your bonnet, and let us go 1" "Do not budge, Mrs. Louis. Do not stir a' step." "Give me your arm, Louise  I command you!" "Move at your peril, Mrs. Louis!" "Am I to be obeyed, Louise " sternly de- manded the lady. "Do you hear me, Mrs. Louis?" -thundered the General. "Oh pity, Lord!" prayed Louise, with clasped   bands and blanched cheeks, her very tears con- gealed with terror--looking from one antagonist to the other. "Ah I good! here is Louis!" exclaimed the General, as Louis Stuart-Gordon quietly enter- ed the room, and stood arrested in an attitude of surprise, in the midst of them. "Louis I Louis!" exclaimed Louise, as, throw- ing out her hands, she flew to his arms, as a bird to her nest-flew from the storm of anger raging around her, and casting her fair arms up around his neck, and burying her head in his bosom, she hung there, palpitating, her pale gold locks and white muslin drapery flowing over his black dress. And Louis l Hegstood there, encircling her with one arm, while with the'other hand he stroked her locks and shoulders-soothing her perturbation -and instinctively mesmerizing her. Mean- while the war of words raged on. "Sir, my daughter returns with me to Mont Crystal 1" "Madam I my son's wife abides under our roof!"And Louise shuddered, even in the shelter ok her husband's arms. '-I It was now that Louis Stuart-Gordon looked up, and with a gesture of the most imposing command, arrested the storm of controversy. Then, with a silent but peremptory inquiry, he demanded the explanation of the scene. Both antagonists essayed to speak at once. Mrs. Armstrong turned full. upon him, and com- menced- "Mr. Stuart-Gordon, circumstances have transpired, and are about to transpire, that constrain me to remove my daughter from this house--" while General Stuart-Gordon was saying-- "Louis, this lady designs to separate you and your wife!" "My dear father, leftme entreat you to grant the lady precedence in this explanation," said Louis. "Certainly, my son 1 Be so good as to pro- ceed, madam.'; And Mrs. Armstrong, in a few curt, haughty words, explained the motive of her act. "So you'perceive, Louis, that this good lady wishes to separate you from your wife. Of course you will not consent to any such meas- sure," decided the General. "My daughter sBALL return with me!" per- sisted the lady, with awful sternness. "My son's wife 'SHALL' abide where she is!" concluded the General. Louise started and shuddered in the arms of her husband. Louis pressed her closer to   his bosom, stooped and soothed her; and then, erecting his slight but elegant form, he waved his hand, and imposed silence by a gesture full of dignity. And, looking from one to the other, with something of grave rebuke in his tone and manner, he said-- ( My honored father I and my esteemed mother-in-law! you do battle over my wife as though she were a slave in whom both of you possessed a property-to whom both of you laid a claim. This must cease! I hall' and 'shall not' are terms that must not be applied to my wife. Comnands and threats are tilings that she must not suffer. Louise is free I free, as God made all creatures; and she must not be deprived of her divine birthright--of her own God-given freedom I She shall direct her own life, control. her own destiny. No one shall compel her choice--no one shall even so much as unduly influence her will. Louise shall decide in this matter, as in all others, for her- self-and," continued the young man, growing a little pale, " and I will abide by her de- cision." "Good! I accept the condition!" said Mrs. Armstrong. "Let Louise decide for herself, I too will abide by her decision!" "BAD1 I say-it will not do! You com- mit an error, Louis 1 You0 give this girl her own way, and her will must succumb to the first strong will that it encounters-must suc- cumb to her mother's. She has never been accustomed to self-guidance-never will be fit for self-guidance." "Never, unless she is permitted to guide herself, my father 1 Enough I We will have the decision of Louise, and accept it." "And abide by it," chimed in Mrs. Arm- strong, who felt no doubt in her mind as to the favorable (for her plan) decision of her daughter. "Zounds I can there be two sides to this question?" exclaimed General Stuart-Gordon, put past his gallantry. "Look up, Louise; look up, my own!" mur- mured Louis, bending over her until his lips were at her ear. "Look up, Louise, and set this vexed question at rest. No one shall con- strain your will. Look up and tell us--will you remain with me, or depart with your mo- ther!" She pressed closer to him, weeping. "Say, my darling--will you remain with me-"           .      , "With you, Louis--with you, angel Louis- yoyou,ou," murmured Louise, dropping words and tears both -in his bosom. ,   "What does she say 8 You are not to coax her," exclaimed the mother. "She says that she will remain with me," said Louis. Mrs. Armstrong turned pale, strode up to her daughter, and exclaimed, bitterly ang sorrow- fully- "( My child I mine only child I do you aban- don me thus? me in my age-me in my widow- hood--ne to endless, childless solitude? Oh, Louise!" "Mother, no--no!" exclaimed the poor bride, o suddenly starting from the gentle arms of Louis, and throwing herself upon the bosom of her mother. "Mother, no I' I will go with you   "Come, then; your shawl and bonnet- where are they " "But, Louis I oh, Louis 1" once more casting herself in the arms of her husband. "Again, my child, will you come!" "Yes, I till go withi you--o, stay with Louis I Mother I Louis I mother!--oh, mercy, Lord " And, broken between conflicting claims and emotions, the poor bride and child fainted over the arm of her husband. j "( THANK GOD 1" exclaimed General Stuart- Gordon, savagely, in the tone of an oath. "Take her to her room, Louis; lock the door on the inside, and remain with her. Don't be alarmed-a fainting-fit is nothing. Call Seraph to attend, you, and be quick, for she will re- cover in five minutes, and all this trouble will be to go over again." And Louis, raising her in his arms, and call- ing loudly for assistance, bore her from the room. Mrs. Armstrong started to follow, but General Stuart-Gordon, with a spring, placed himself before her in the doorway. "Let me pass, sir." "No, you shall not, by Heaven, madam l Louis is a fool; and you are-Mrs. Armstrong I Thank God that I am alive to save my daugh- ter-in-law from perishing through the folly of her husband, or being destroyed by the cruelty of her mother." "Let me pass, sir." "Your carriage waits, madam, and your way to it lies through the other door." "LET ME PASSi SIR." "Your carriage waits, madam Willit ple'ase you to deliver us from the inconvenience of your presence!" Haggard with rage, but perfectly impotent, at least for the time beig, Mrs. Armstrong turned abruptly, strode from the room, entered :   her carriage, and was driven to Mont Clrystalt there to brood secretly over schemes of deeper vengeance. CHAPTER    IV. THE OLD MAN'S    DARLING. The more than Michal of his bloom, The Abishag of his age. Christopher Smart's Song of David. LoUISE recovered from her fainting fit 'to find her mother gone. All night she wept bitterly. The next morning she awoke pale and hollow-eyed.  She wrote a letter full of the tenderest expressions of filial affection, and sent it to Mont Crystal. This letter was re- turned with the seal unbroken. Then she would have set out for Mont Crystal imme- diately, but a thunder-storm arising--a violent equinoctial storm, lasting all the afternoon and evening-prevented her. The next day, from the flood, the roads were impassable for a carriage, and Louise could not ride on horse- back. She was forced to content herself with writing another and more earnest and impas- sioned letter to her mother. The second let- ter, like the first, was returned unopened- and Louise went to bed and wept herself to, sleep. General Stuart-Gordon had ridden over tot The Crags that afternoon, to pass the eveningr with Brighty. It was very late when he re- turned. He entered the wainscoted parlor with a singularly light and brisk step,threw off his coat, drew on his wadded gown, and settled himself comfortably in his study-chair by the side of -the table to read the papers that had arrived in the evening's mail, Run- ning his eyes over the columns, his attention was arrested by the following   advertise- ment :- "NEXT OF KIN. "If the heirs of Riley Frobisher O'Riley, of Athlone, county of Westmeath, Ireland, be yet living, and should see this advertisement, they are requested to report themselves to; James Frobisher, Secretary of Legation to the British Embassy at Washington, where they will hear something to their advantage." "'Riley Frobisher O'Riley, late of Athlone I' Why, he was the father of my Brighty,-this concerns my Brighty," thought the General, reading over the advertisement aga-i ,-'t Wil   hear something to- their advantage'-to her dvyantage-for there is only she. That means that a fortune is left her, if it means any thing! Oh, Brighty I shall I lose you at last? Shall this sole privilege of making your future pros- perous be taken from me I But this is selfish. I said her happiness was dearer to me than any thing else, yet now I am alarmed at a piece of good fortune promised her; yet, after all, this may be a mistake. I will write at once, and ascertain what this means." And, turning around to his writing-table, he penned a hasty' letter of inquiry to the Secre- tary of Legation, and, ringing for Apollo, bade him, late as it was, to saddle a horse and take it to the post-office, that it might go out in the morning's mail. "- "It will then be two days before I can re- ceive an answer," thought the General, as he retired " to bed, but not to sleep." ,: Two days elapsed-a week passed away-- General Stuart-Gordon had received no an- swer as yet to his letter to the British Secre- tary of Legation. He had not failed to men- tion the. advertisement to Britannia, but she took it so quietly-seemed to think it of so little importance-that his fears had been set at rest; and, indeed, his self-respect had pre- vented him from expressing to Britannia an uneasiness for which at heart he condemned himself. He had even grown to think that the notice might possibly have reference to some one else. Upon the second week after the family quarrel, one evening, as soon as Louise had, weeping, left the oak-parlor, and as soon as Louis had, sympathizing, followed her, General Stuart-Gordon, putting on his dressing-gown and slippers, and sinking into his easy-chair, began to make himself comfortable by stretch- ing out his feet and resting them upon the fire-irons, and drawing his candle-stand laden with papers to his side. He had scarcely commenced reading, when Apollo rode up to the door, and, jumping from his horse, entered the room with the evening mail. "Give them to me, here, Apollo!" said the Oeneral, dropping his paper'; and Apollo, un- drawint the strings of the bag, and: taking hold of the bottom by the comers, emptied the let- ters out. There were letters from exporting grain and tobacco merchants of Baltimore and New York; there were political letters; and there was one that was inmediately torn open and read. It 1ore' the Washington post-mark. It was from jmse"ro;bisher,/ Piqujex, Secretary f 'the   British Embassy from the Court of St. James, to Washington. It ran thus:- "WASmNGTON, Aprit 380 18--. "To General Stuart-Gordon:- "SIR: Yours of the 20th April is at hand. The advertisement of the heirs of Riley O'Riley in the Intelligencer of the 10th April, to which your letter alludes, relates to the following facts, viz.: "Joyce Riley O'Riley, last Earl of Clon- machnois, died at Castle Clonmachnois, near Athlone, county of Westmeath, Ireland, on the 22d of last February, aged ninety years. He died intestate and without heirs, unless the daughter of the late Riley O'Riley, the young- est son bof the Earl's fourth son, can be found. "If this young lady lives in the person of Miss Britannia O'Riley, and can prove her identity, she is sole heiress to the late Earl's titles and estates, and Countess of Clonmachnois in her own right. I shall do myself the honor of waiting upon you, in Telation to this subject, in the course of the week. "Sir/yours, most respectfully, ," JAMES FROBISHER." The letter dropped from the hands of Gern- eral Stuart-Gordon, and a mortal coldness and weakness seized his frame; his heart sunk. "This is a blow. Just Heaven I this is a blow. Within three days of my marriage, too." And he arose and walked up and down the floor, with his hands clasped behind his back, and his head bowed upon his bosom, as was his custom when troubled. "Well--well! well-well! this is severe-- this is heavy I She will no longer have 4a reason for marrying a man old enough to be her father-and yet I would have made her 'happy. I feel that I should have done so. But it is over, it is over, this last, last dream. Countess of Clonmachnois I Oh, Brighty, after all, will you ever meet with one who will cherish you tenderly as I have done?" 'General Stuart-Gordon did not go to bed that night. Early the next morning, without saying one word upon the subject to any mem- ber of his family, he took pen, ink, and paper, and wrote the following tiote to Britannia:-- 'ISLE OF RAYS, May 15th. "DEABEsT BRITANNIA: Let yourmost earnest and sincere friend be the first to wish you joy in your dawn of fortune. I have just received a letter froi the Secretary of Legation;and   am pleased to be the first to announce'to you the brilliant change that awaits you-to be the first to address you by your new title. "Therel that is as faraq,;J can go, and as , much as I can do, Britannia. I cannot offer you my congratulations in person; I have no strength to do so. I am stricken, Brighty-I am stricken. "Like the slave in the Brazilian mines, I have found a diamond of the first water, only to see it snatched from me, and set in a coronet. "When I found a young, beautiful, accom- plished, and amiable girl, alone and unpro- tected, a girl of elegant manners and refined tastes, exposed to all the evils of an unsettled life, I had thought to take that girl to my bosom, and, by cherishing her tenderly,to have made her happy and won her affections. "But all this is changed now. The Countess of Clonmachnois has a splendid destiny before her. The diamond will blaze all the more brilliantly when set in the coronet; Britannia will lend lustre even to the high rank she will reach. ' "Brighty-for to me you are Brighty, and no countess-Brighty, then, in three days more we were to have been married. I know the strict integrity of your heart, and I know that you would have kept your engagement under, all circumstances, but I release you fully and freely from it. I wish you joy. God bless you, my dear Brighty. "' I inclose' you the letter of the Secretary of Legation. There will be no difficulty in prov- ing your identity ; and I need not say, dearest Britannia, that I am at your command always, to render any service in my power. "Your friend, as ever, "CAORTWRIGHT STUARTGOniDON." He folded, sealed, and directed this letter, and calling Apollo, bade him saddle a horse, and take it to The Crags. Louise kept her room with a nervous head- ache all that day. Two weeks of crying had completely exhausted the delicate girl Louis came to breakfast, looking disturbed. General Stuart-Gordon :told him, gravely, to take comfort; that the evil fates would proba- bly be conciliated by the sacrifice of oe mem- ber Xo any one family, and that that midember would probably be himself. And, without ex- plaining his meaning fuither, General Stuart.- Gordosh left the oak parlor, and 'shut himself up alone is his 'library, trying to read a- He- brew dictionary,* plaied 'upside dowa Ibefoitei, im   He  ndid nobtg down todiidin '  i   Soon after dinner, ApblloBsliBdeieietu eed from his errand to The'0Crg, andg i^dei it the door of the library.   ....

"Yes, sir." And, with another- bow and scrape,'Apollo advanced and handed the note. It was a little three-cornered-folded thing, and directed in the hand of Britannia. He opened it hastily, and read as follows:--  "Will General Stuart-Gordon favor Britan- nia O'Riley with an interview this evening i" That was all          / "Saddle my horse quickly, Apollo-then come and assist me to dress. Tell Seraph to bring me' some hot watr," exclaimed General Stuart-Gordon, rising hastily, and passing from his library on his way to his bed-cham. ber. In half an hour, Gefieral Stuart-Gordon was on his road to The Crags. In two hours, he had arrived. The family had just arisen from tea. Major Somerville, as usual, had retired to rest. Su- san and Britannia were sewing, and Anna was reading "Paradise and the Peri" aloud :to them. Anna, as was her invaiable custom, as soon as a visitor entered, arose and withdrew. General Stuart-Gordon advanced;' bowing.'  "Good evening,:my dear Miiss '8odmer;ville,' he said, pressing Susan's hand. Then going to Britannia: "How shall I address you now, madam, in offering -again, and:ii person, my earnest congrat/ulations upon the/spln&did fu- ture opening before you 1" he asked, n a very low voice. Britannia arose from her h seat, giving him "her hand, andlooki at Susan, sid quietly- "My dear Mis Sonmerville, I wisli', t6con- v*erse alonewith "G(ieral Stuart:G ordd"n'for a few minutes, if yi':V will give He leavey , -:  - Susan' sniugly iieos, in44e46 eyA tia Britannia rese't0a 1- nestl , nt4od  ^ t56r the Gen'ia"He t16 ik't, 1 at*l.!, .:.i ,' ,     *   and, drawing up his portly form, and throwing ,one arm over the back of the chair, addressed his companion as follows:-- "Well, Britannia I I said that 1 was at your command, and, accordingly, when you sum- moned me to your presence I lost no time in obeying you, though I could have wished, Britannia, that you had spared me the pain of this interview-at least fior a few days- at least until I had in some measure recovered from the shock of this most heavy blow, and regained a portion of my calmness and self- control. However, Britannia, I am here, and ready 'to serve you." All this time, Britannia had sat quite still, looking down upon her own white and jewelled hands, that lay one upon the other on her lap. She did not speak, even now that he had finished. his sentence. "Well, Britannia, what do you wish to do first I How can I assist you? Tell me; I am quite at your orders. Why do you not reply, Britannia T" "I do not wish any thing done until aftek Sunday,- General," said Britannia. General Stuart-Gordon started-looked at her earn- estly. Sunday was to have been their wed- ding-day. , "Oh, Britannia! But this allusion is thought- less or wanton on your part." "Why, General I Have we not enough to keep us busy until Sunday f After Sunday, can we not take Baltimore and. Washington in our route, and attend to this business?" "Oh, Britannia, cease to torture me! You know that this is all changed-all-all-all i" "Then you do really mean to break with me, General i" "I do really mean to release you from your engagement to myself, Britannia." "And upon what account 8" "Upon account of the new and brilliant position in which you will shortly find your- self I told you my reasons in my letter." Britannia arose from her seat, and, coming around, rested her hand upon the back of his chair, while she asked, gravely- "My friend, why did you write that letter to me!" "Brighty, oh, Brightylr all is over. You know that I feel it too well--too surely-too powerfully." "My friend, this grows very serious. Ex- plain yourself," said Britannia, very gravely. "Britannia, my letter explained this. Do not affect to misunderstand me." "Your letter and your conversation, General 'Stuart-Gordon, coincide perfectly--neither con-   tradicting the other. Both, however, are un- intelligible to me." "How I Do you not understand that by the death of your great-grandfather, the aged Earl of Clonmachnois, and by the previous demise of every intervening heir, you are left sole heiress of his titles and estates, and that you are, at this moment, Countess of Clonmachnois in your own right? Do you not understand that?" "Yes I I understand, believe, and accept that, as though it were one of the thirty-nine articles of the Christian faith " exclaimed Brighty, lifting her eyes, gleaming with pride and mirth, to his face. "You do 1" exclaimed the General, irritated and offended at her smile. "Then. you under- stand that you may choose from the elite of young aristocracy 1' You understand that there is now no necessity to sacrifice yourself to an elderly man, whom you cannot love!"Bri- tannia had kept her eyes steadily on him during this sharp speech. At its close she drew her elegant form up to its proudest height, lifted her regal head until her ring- lets, though drooping, scarcely reached her bosom, and said, lowly and slowly- "My position necessarily exposes me to many humiliations, but that which is most dif- ficult to bear is a taunt from General Stuart- Gordon!" All the chivalry of Virginia started in his veins to reproach him for this rudeness. He arose, and with a stately suavity took her hand, bowed over it, and said, gravely- "Forgive me, madam I Make some allow- ance for the many disturbances of my mind by this sudden and grievous calamity-the loss of a treasure so nearly received." "Sir!" said Britannia, "a girl who would have accepted your hand from merely conve- nient motives, is no treasure to be regret- ted!" "But, Britannia, recollect. You said, your- self, that you did not love me." And.,his whole frame shook, as he wiped the perspi- ration from his browr. "Nor do I, as poets, painters, and players understand the term. My friend, you are se- riously disturbed; so seriously disturbed that I must forget the injurious language you use towards me, and I must try to reassure you; let us understand each other. Will you sit down  I have never seen you so greatly moved. I regret this exceedingly-regret that any circumstances should possess the power of moving you so. Sir, I beseech you, recover   your self-possession--! scarcely recognize Gen- eral Stuart-Gordon thus."' "When I am about to lose you, Britannia" "But you are not to lose me, my dearest friend.  . "But you never loved me, Britannia; and now, as there exists no necessity for your sac- rificiug yourself, you shall,not do it." "Again I You urge that point so strenu- ously. No; I do not love you after the man- ner of young ladies who sigh over sentimen- tal poetry, and die over doleful ditties; I am incapable of the thing. Nor do I lament my incapacity for the capricious and evanescent emotionti-; but I have a very profound friend- ship for you, General-a friendship that I have for no other human being-and a very high respect for you, a respect that makes me, with all my pride, regret that I have the power of moving you so; and I have to bring to mind David, Solomon, Marc Antony, and all the great heroes of antiquity, who in. the grave autumn of their lives have thus forgot- ten their high self-appreciation, in order to understand you, sir 1", "It is because you love me not, while I love you, Britannial " said General Stuart-Gordon, pressing her hand with grave tenderness. "Brighty, I had hoped, by blessing your .life with all my power, to have won your heart. What can I offer you that the world will not lay at your feet V" Again that inexplicable gleaming smile bf suppressed and self-mocking mirth puzzled and answered the General. Rising with dignity, he said-  "This has continued long enough, madam. I am at your service when you please to advise me of any assistance I can render jyou in this affail. Good evening, madam.  Pray make my excuses to Miss Somerville. Once more, good evening, madam;" and, bowing very low, General Stuart-Gordon raised his hat from the table, and was passing out. But just as his hand was laid upon the lock of the door, the jewelled fingers of Brighty fell upon his wrist. He turned around. "Will you come back? "At your command, madam." "Will you sit down?" He replied by seating himself, throwing himself back, and preparing to listen'to her. "It is a great thing to get a character for integrity, fidelity, and magnanimity; and I should like very well to own such a one," said Brighty,- as if communing with herself; "un- fortunately for the success of my wish, this   - dear General contends the crown of generosity with me! Well I let him take it l"  Then turning to where General Stuart-Gordon sat in ; offended majesty, she said - ' "I am Countess of Clonmachnois in my own I right, am I not f" "I presume there can be no doubt of the question, madam?" "Of Castle Clonmachnois, Athlone, county of Westmeath, Ireland!'." "Correct as a city directory, madam." "That has a very magnificent sound I It is quite as brilliant as the flashing of the frost and ice that lay upon the dead flowers in the garden of Mont Crystal," " Yes, Britannia," said the General, gravely and mournfully, and again overcome in her presence,-." yes, Britannia, but my life is the blighted winter garden, and your fortunes are the ice and sleet that have killed it with cold brilliance, and covered it with a frozen and glittering shroud. " "That is to say, my title, if I return to Ire- land, Countess of Clonmachnois, and my estates, the castle and lands of Clonmachnois 1" "Yes." "Oh 1 the vast difference between names and things! A month ago I was called by Mrs. Armstrong a dependant, while I was , simply myself, Britannia O'Riley; to-day I am called Countess of Clonmachnois, still being myself, Britannia O'Riley l-a wayward girl, with some natural graces, and some acquired accomplishments-very proud-not of the ac- cident of birth, but by the accident of an un- usual development of the brain in the region of self-esteem. Listen to me, sirl I was proud as a Governess. I could not be prouder as an Empress I I could not be unfaithlful, ungrateful, inconstant, as either " .Here Brighty dashed the flashing tears from her eyes, and went on- "Set yourself at rest, my dearest and best friend.' If there is any generosity, it will be upon your part, who will take a petulant and penniless girl to your heart and home l", and', stooping down, Brighty offered her cheek .to his kiss. 'Penniless, Brighty!" he exclaimed, in scarcely repressed astonishment. "Yes, listen! This Castle of Clonmachnois 1 It is a ruin-not half as good as this old house we sit in. The estates of Clonmaehnois consist of some two or three huhdred acres of unre- claimed and unreclaimable morass. The rent of Olonmachnois might searcely be collected from a   few half-naked and half-starved wrkethes,   who have found miserable shelter in the mud huts built upon the meagre spots of half dry land that are dotted about in the bog, like stepping-stones in a marsh. The last Earl of Clonmachnois died, since he is dead, in the deepest poverty-his sons and grandsons hav- ing perished before, in their efforts to retrieve their fortunes--some under the burning sun of Hindostan, some amid the snows of Upper Canada, and some in the forests of Brazil. All that remains to me is the barren title-the bitter mockery. Oh for Heaven's sake, Gen- eral, keep it a secret, lest democratic Virginia should amuse itself at the expense'of the beg- gar Countess I I have not pride enough to defy ridicule. ' Only Mrs. Armstrong has pride enough for that r" General Stuart-Gordon was somewhat re-, lieved; still, with a shade of uneasiness, he inquired- "But how know, you all this, Britannia?" ( Oh I from the correspondence of my father and my uncles-old letters in my posses- sion." ' "These will be necessary to prove your identity, if there is any call for them. Dearest Britannia, I am so relieved." "That I have not a fortune." "It is selfish, Britannia, but it is human." "I wish I had a fortune to bring you." "And I wish to confer every thing upon you, Brighty.: "But I do not understand why this English Secretary of Legation should take such an in- terest in discovering a beggared heiress." "Nor I,-Britannia; and it gives me uneasi- ness. Depend upon it, Britannia, this inherit- ance is not the trifle you think it." T And rising now,as it was getting late, he took his leave, and departed. Returning home with a somewhat lighter heart than he had set out with, still he wondered why any one should take the trouble of advertising the heir- ess of a uain half sunk in a bog. The mystery was soon explained. The next morning, as General Stuart-Gordon sat upon the piazza, enjoying his cigar, his paper, and the beautiful landscape stretched out before him, he saw a travelling-carriage descend the road leading from a neighboring village, and taking the .direction to the little bridge, recently constructed, connecting the badnkof the river with The Isle of Rays, pass over it, and, entering upon the circular carriage road leading to the front entrance of the man- sion, drive slowly up and pause. The coach-   man jumped from the box, opened the:door, let down the steps, and stood aside to let a gentleman descend. The General arose, and advanced to receive his visitor. He was a neatly and elegantly dressed man, of about twenty-six years of age, tall, slender, hand- some, dark-complexioned, and of very graceful manners and charming address. i"I have the honor of addressing General Stuart-Gordon i" "That is my name, sir." "I am James Frobisher, of the British Em- bassy." "I am happy to see you, sir. Walk in," said the General, bowing, and leading the way to-the oak parlor. "I shall feel obliged if you will grant me a private interview, sir." "Certainly, sir, with great pleasure. Will you accompany me to the library?" The handsome visitor bowed gracefully, and followed his conductor to the library. As soon as they were seated- "I presume, sir, that I am speaking to the guardian of Miss Britannia CRiley?" inquired the visitor. "Sir, I am, in some sort, the guardian of-that young lady." "You know her intimately, then V? "I do, sir." "Where was she educated? What is she like!" "At Hartford, Connecticut, sir; and she is like a beautiful, elegant, and accomplished woman." "I am pleased to hear you say so, sir. Is she at your house at this time? If so, how soon can I be presented to her?" "( Sir, the young lady is at present on a visit , of some weeks to a young friend, whose resi- Idence is two miles distant. If you wish it, I , will send a messenger to announce your visit at any hour you may name." "Thank you, sir. Will it be asking too much of your goodness to request your company on this visit i" I  "Ib, no, sir; I will attend you with pleas- s ure, at any time." I  "Then the sooner the better, my dear sir, as e I am impatient to be presented to this young ; lady." e  General Stuart-Gordon rung the bell and e said- e  "I will send a messenger immediately to e announce our visit, and we will set out in half E- an hour. Excuse'me a moment, sir"--and, a- going to a writing-table, he wrote-   "MrY DEAEST BrrANNIA-  Mr. Frobisher is here, and we will both be with you in an hour.             "C S-G." and folded it, just as Apollo made his appear- ance at the door. "Take this to Miss O'Riley."   The man bowed and withdrew. "As you are the young lady's guardian, and as I have but a few days to remain,I will tell you, sir, the motive of my anxiety to be pre- sented to her. In a word, it is this: The Cas- tle of Clonmachnois is a ruin; the estates are dwindled down to a few acres of marsh land, tenanted by a few wretched peasants, who are not able to pay for the mud huts in which they starve." "This coincides with what I have heard from the young lady herself, sir." "Nothing, therefore, remains but the title." "That is understood, sir." "Well, sir; I am a distant relative of the family of Clonmachnois. I have an ample fortune, and am under no necessity to marry an heiress of property. I wish to get into the House of Peers, for the sake of serving there the interests of Ireland. My father has interest at Court, and has obtained for me the promise of the reversion of the title of Earl of Clon- machnois, in the event of my marrying the heiress of that house." General Stuart-Gordon did not reply. He sat staring at the young and handsome speaker with the frank and graceful manners, as though he been the Gorgon that had turned him into stone. Happily the General sat with hiis back to the window, so that the young man could not see the dismay blanching hig countenance as he continued his discourse- "Yes; that is the reason why I wish, with- out delay, to be presented to this young lady, to see whether she is by education and man- ,ners fitted to be introduced '/to London so- ciety." "Sir," said the General, "I have never seen :a more elegant or accomplished woman than, Britannia O'Riley. You will see her, however, 'this morning. There is no'carriage-road lead- ing from The Isle of Rays to The Crags, so that we shall have to get into the saddles;" , and again ringing the bell, General Stuart- Gordon gave directions for two horses t'o be saddled. In a few minutes the two gentlemen were on horseback, and ambling towards The  -Crags, the younger traveller stopping frequent-  ly in the ascent, and turning to look with a r poet's enthusiasm at 'the entrancing -beauty, ] ,   sublimity, and splendor of the landseapo of mountains, rocks, falls, river, isle, and verdant banks, with all the glories of the earth and sky, doubled and reflected in the clear water. "Why, this is a. scene of divine beauty. There is nothing on the Rhine like this.. Nqtoh- ing in Switzerland, or Italy, like this. The Isle of Rays I It scintillates and sparkles like a diamond. Emits lines of light ike a cluster of darting sunbeams. I wish my friend Turner were here, to sketch this Eden" Moody and silent, the General scarcely heard or replied to the enthusiastic admiration of his companion. They reached The Crags at last, rapped, were admitted. Britannia and .Susa Somerville arose to receive their, visitors. General Stuart-Gordon presented "Mr. Fro- bisher." Britannia received him with a courtesy, and placing her hand in that of the General,  returned the pressure with which he greeted it. General Stuart-Gordon looked from Bri- tannia to Frobisher, to note their mutual effect upon each other. He saw in Frobisher the surprise, the quick and ardent admiration he expected to find. tHe saw in Britannia the impassable dignity, presenting the cold and brilliant surface that ever distinguished her manners to strange gentlemen. They were all seated. The presence of Susan Somerville. restrained conversation upon the subject, of the  inheritance. They discussed general topics-- the beauty of the spring-.the splendor of: the landscape stretching down before them, and visible at a great distance from this -bleak height. Then they discussed Washington, Mr, Jefferson, Thomas Moore, who was then there, and, in short, every thing, but the business nearest the -hearts of all, General Stuart- Gordon perceived that Frobisher's- admiration of Britannia grew by what it fed on. And very soon he arose to take his leave, as this was only an experimental visit. "You have seen Miss O'Riley, sir," said the General, as soon as they were on the road. "Yes, sir," "And you are pleased with her, no doubt."' "Sir, I feel that any praise of mine of that young lady, would be an impertinence. She is without a peer!" Both gentlemen now sunk into silence, each occupied with his own thoughts. They reached The Isle of Rays in- time for dinner. -Jealous as he was, General Stuart-Gordon, with Vir- ginian hospitality, invited and pressed' his visitor to become his guest while he should remain in the neighborhood, and, after some hesitation, the young man accepted his ,in.   vitation, remarking that nothing in America struck him more forcibly than the resemblance between English country life and Virginia country life. That it appeared to him that the planters had retained, in a great degree, the domestic manners and customs of their English fathers. At dinner, the young stranger was pre- sented to Mr. Stuart-Gordon. Louise did not make her appearance, nor did the young man see her while he remained. It would have saved him from a serious mistake, and all parties from much future sorrow, if he had. 'General Stuart-Gordon was absent. and taci- turn during the meal. When the wine was placed upon the table, the General arose, and bidding Louis entertain his guest, excused him- self upon the plea of urgent business, and left 'the room. In truth, he could not stand his suspense any longer. He must know what impression Frobisher had made upon Britannia. He mounted his horse, and rode rapidly up the ascent of The Crags. 'It was sunset when he started.  The full moon had arisen before he was half way up The Crags, and was flooding. with a silver glory the whole refulgent landscape; but he did not pause to look at the river, rolling on in a tor- rent of light between the dark rocks, or as The Isle of Rays, with its rivulets and waterfalls, glanced in lines of silver light under the moon- beams. He saw neither the glory of the heavens nor the splendor of the earth. He saw nothing but the black shadow of the Crag House high up before him, and he sped,:on towards it. The sweet notes of the violin floated out on the moonlit air as he neared the house. Britannia, Susan, and the two women, were out on the porch, and George was play- ing the fiddle for them. Brighty separated herself from thce party, and advanced into the silver light to meet him, just as he had got down from his horse. ( I am very glad you came again-very glad. That stiff and formal call; this morning, could scarcely be called a visit. As you may judge, I wanted to see you, also, after our comedy of yesterday evening." Somewhat startled by the friendliness of her manner, he drew her arm within his own, and, instead of going on to the house, he took her :to walk down the crags. "( Well, Britannia, what do you think of this young Frobisher?" "His person and manners are faultless, and his dress the perfection of exquisite ele- gance--"   "And his mind--his conversation-what do you think of that, Britannia F" "His mind appears to be highly cultivated, and his conversation at once profound and bril- liant." "Oh, Heaven!" growled the General. "Bri- tannia, do you know that this young man- --this Adonis of the faultless figure and face, and the elegant dress and address-this Apol- lo of the profound and brilliant discourse-has come to this country with the design of marry- ing you!" "Without ever having seen me? Cool and confident, that." "Nay; he wished to see you, before deci- ding-" "A prudent precaution; to ascertain if I would please him, and pass in good English society. Very flattering that, also." "He is very much pleased with you, Bri- tannia---" "How kind of him." "He admires you excessively:' "Does he, I I'll be at'charges for a looking- glass,' and set up o' nights to admire myself." "You are gay, Britannia." "OhI look at the glorious heavens above, and look at them again reflected in the waters below; see The Isle of Rays coquetting with the moon-glancing back laugh for smile, and flash for beam; hear the cataract shouting as it leaps into the river, dashing up millions of diamond sparks; see the solemn dark rocks watching the play with grave joy, like denture chaperons of young folks at a ball. Oh, I am glad andgay to-night." "I would I were-this young man, Britan- nia." "Well I what is it now? He hums and he hankers, he frets and he cankers, You never can please him, do a' that you can; He's peevish and jealous of a' the young fellows,' ' sung Brighty, changing her manner to one of lightest merriment. "Be serious, Britannia, for I am." "Instanter, sir I I am as serious as an owl." "I was about to say that this young man will certainly propose to you." "Exactly I Now we are going to rehearse yesterday's scene over again." "You are in one of your wayward humors to-night, Britannia." "Speak, sir, if you please--I attend," said Brighty, now really, serious.: "I wish, then, to set before you the claims this young Frobisher has to your attention.   You see what his personal merits are, besides which he is wealthy. He is promised the reversion of the title that you will bear; he admires and wishes to marry you. Finally, he can place you near the head of London society." "Have you done, sir 8" "Yes." ' 'Then, if this gentleman should honor me with the offer of his hand, I should most re- spectfully decline it." "Why, Britannia!" "Why? First, because I am pledged." "But I release you." "Secondly, then, because I could not be, proud of him." "Not proud of him--handsome, elegant, ac- complished, and a member of the English aris- tocracy." A "No, I could not honor him in my heart. He wants the prestige of age,' wisdom, a name made glorious by himself; Be wants all, in fact, that I most highly honor in you." "But, Britannia, he may gain all Nthis-nay, his sun may be rising to its meridian glory while mine will be declining." "Lastly, then, I must refuse him because I love you." "Love me-at last, Brighty ]" "Yes, I love you at last, my dearest and best friend. Hearts are not won in a day-bless me," and Brighty turned and dropped her head upon his bosom. He folded her in his arms, murmuring- "My boon, my blessing, my comfort! I do bless -bless thee," Having been duly apprized 6f the intended marriage, Mr. Frobisher set out for Washitlgton the next day. A month had now  passed away,' during which no intercourse was held between Mont Crystal and The Isle of Rays. The separation of the families was as complete as though the Atlantic had frozen up between them. Louise, timid, docile, pliable, and ever under the influ- ence of those nearest to her, made no effort to rejoin her mother, or to reconcile the families. Louis continually cheered her with the hope that this estrangement would pass away--that all would be genial again. On the next Sab- bath-day, after morning-service, a quiet, re. spectable wedding-party filed out of the Stuart- Gordon pew, and arranged itself before the altar. It consisted of General Stuart-Gordon, attended by Brutus Lion, and Miss Britannia O'Riley, attended by Gertrude, and in ten   s minutes from the opbning of the prayer-book B at the marriage cereimony, General and Mrs. a Stuart-Gordon received the congratulations of their friends. A travelling carriage, with two i outriders, was at the church-door. On leaving the church, General Stpart-Gordon handed his bride into the carriage, where Louis and Louise were already seated, and the whole party i set out on a bridal tour to Niagara and the Lakes. CHAPTER V. THE LAIR. The mountains! the mountains! amidst them is my home, To their pure and sparkling fountains exultingly I come; Where bleak and towering summits invade the dark, blue sky, And o'er their rudest ridges upon my steed I fly. Dickson. TRE Monday succeeding the marriage of Britannia and the General was a glorious day. The sun rose in cloudless splendor, gilding the summits of the Alleghanies and throwing their shadows broad and black upon the valleys. And all this sublime beauty of earth and sky was reflected and duplicated in the diamond- clear waters. The songs of myriads of birds mingled with the laugh of a thousand rivulets and the shouts of many cataracts. -And all this grand harmony was repeated and re-echoed from cavern, rock, and glen. It was a glorious, jubilant morning. Above all this thunder of music was some- times heard a clear, strong, ringing note. It was the passing shout of Gertrude Lion, as she cleared an awful chasm, or gained a lofty! peak. The passage of the Mad River through a defile of the Alleghanies is one of the most sublime and terrific scenes in nature. Upon this all-glorious morning the travelling carriage of young Frobisher wound slowly up the ascent of this most fearful pass. The young man had left The Isle of Rays on Saturday--had reached the hamlet of the Peaks, from whence he had set out upon this morning, with the intention of continuing his journey. He had left the village of the Peaks some miles behind, when his horses began to struggle up this steep, rugged, and perilous ascent. Frobisher looked out upon- this wild scene -with all an artist's enthusiasm, thoughtless of danger.   Here the rqcks seemed to have yawned apart to admit the passage of the river, or rather, to have started apart, aghast at the frenzy of the torrent that tore a passage through their crags, and hurried, howling, leaping, and rebounding, into the abyss far below. More and more difficult and dangerous be- came the ascent of this pass, until, having gained the summit, they began to descend. Suddenly,'piercing the thunder of the cata- racts, came a cry- "STOP, ON YOUR LIVES! You have missed the road." The young man put his head from the car- riage-window, and caught a glimpse, high upon the precipice across the torrent, of a golden- haired Amazon in a blue riding-dress, upon a gigantic white horse. "STOP ON YOUR LIVES! DEATH IS BEFORE yoU!" she shouted again, with frantic gestures. It was too late! With rapidly accelerating velocity the carriage, rolling, pitching, and re- bounding, thundered down the precipice, and was dashed to atoms on the rocks of the abyss! Clearing the chasm by a flying bound, Ger- trude Lion sprang from her horse, and, leaping from peak to peak, precipitated herself down to, the scene of death below. With scowling precipices above, and over- hanging cliffs around, and jagged rocks below, pitch dark was the cavernous abyss but for one strong gleam of sunlight, that, striking through a cleft in the rocks, fell red upon the ghastly wreck, a mingled heap of broken shafts and wheels, crushed and writhing horses, and dead and dying men! One instant, aghast with horror, Gertrude stood, then she sprang to the spot. The horses were convulsed in their last death-throes. The coachman lay with his form shattered out of every resemblance to humanity. She saw all this at a glance. A second look showed her the form of a young man, with his head, shoulders, and arms, drooping back- wards over the broken windows of the car- riage. He hung there, pallid, still, and rigid. This might be from a concussion, or a swoon -there was no proof of death at least. She saw that, and hastened to render assistance where alone it could be available, if any, to hirm. She tqok hold of his shoulders and tried to draw him out of the carriage. Finding that a part of the. timbers had been crushed upon  his form, she let him go, and went to work with her strong hands and hunting-knife until she had cut, torn, and wrenched an opening large enough to draw him through. She took   him in her powerful arms, and laid his help- less head over her robust shoulders, and her fine, fierce eyes rolled from precipice to peak, and from rock to torrent, in search of a dry, smooth spot on which to lay the mangled form. She saw nothing of the sort until her eyes fell upon the spot near her feet, where the coachman lay in a heap with the horses- all still in death. She laid her burden gently down, and with a "-Poor fellows 1" bestowed impartially upon man and horses, she stooped, and, with her great strength, succeeded in stretching them out, and arranging them into acsort of bed, to keep the bruised form of the living invalid from the sharp rocks and foaming water. Then she lifted her patient, and laid him on the heap, arranging him as tenderly as possible- a wounded and insensible man, resting on a couch formed of the dead I Seizing a crushed hat from the ground, she stooped to the water, and dipped it full. Kneel- ing on the sharp rocks, unmindful of the pain, she laved his head and face, the while gazing with a savage admiration at the pale, aristocratic features, surrounded by their frame of black silky hair and whiskers. "How beautiful he is! how beautiful!" she said, lifting the delicate hand, and examining with a half savage, half childish curiosity the white and tapering fingers, one of which was encircled with a rich seal ring. "Beautiful as a sun-gilded cloud! beautiful as a mountain rainbow! Oh I I hope he will not die." And she renewed her efforts to recover him. "What shall I do? Oh! what shall I do? What do people do for dead people? I mean drowned people-no, killed people? Oh they bleed them. The doctor bled Brutus when-he was thrown from his horse, and had his head broken -stop"--she took her hunting-knife, and felt its point-then flying to a rock, she sharpened it-then running back to her patient, she rip- ped up his coat sleeve, and bared his arm, encircling it with her thumb and finger, and i compressing it, she started up the vein. Then gazing on the fair transparent skin, with the blue veins meandering beneath, she paused. For the very first time in her life the rock of her heart was smitten, and a fount of pity and tenderness gushed forth into a flood of tears, that rolled flashing down her face, like one of the sparkling waterfalls of her native moun- tains.. \ "Oh  what shall I do: I cannotl No, I cannot' stick this ghastly blade into that fair arm. Ohl I cannot it would give him so   much pain. But ifI do not he will die. Yes, he will dissolve away from me, beautiful and evanescent as the rainbow of this morning." , She opened the vein, and, as the blood began to flow, the young man slowly unclosed his eyes. "How do you feel I Do you know me  (Yes, that was what the doctor said to Brutus, when he opened his eyes after the bleeding.) How- do you feel Do you know me " But a spasm convulsed the young man's face, and he fainted again. "Oh I Heavens! what shall I do now?" ex- claimed Gertrude, as she cut off the linen sleeve of his shirt, stripped it up, and bound up his arm. "I must get him home to The Lair; but oh I I am fearful that he cannot bear the re- moval." She dashed water in his face. He revived again. "Do you know me now?" she asked, fixing her eyes earnestly on his countenance, He looked at her with a troubled expression, and closed his eyes, as if in weariness, while spasms of pain traversed his countenance. "Oh I if I could get a doctor here! but that is impossible-neither man nor beast but my- self, or some poor, hunted, desperate fugitive slave, could reach this frightful wild. I must try to get him home to The Lair." She'at- tempted to raise him, but spasms of agony con- vulsed his whole frame on being moved. "Oh I I could carry him home, but the removal would kill him. What shall I do with him? Let's see-these rocks are full of caverns, the occa-  sional retreats of runaway slaves. I must find one, as a temporary shelter."  And laying the wounded marTdown gently, she started off, diligently searching among the  rocks. At last she came to the, opening of a cavern. Entering it, she saw that it was 1 smooth, though not level, and quite dark. Stripping off her blue cloth pelisse, she laid it down as a pallet; returning to the side of her invalid, she gently drew him away from the body of the coachman, stripped the clothes from t the dead man, and carrying them off to the c cavern, laid a part of them on the pelisse, a to make it softer, and rolled up a part of c them as a pillow, ,and placed it at the head. 1 Then returning to her patient, she raised him in her arms, laid his head gently over'her i shoulder, and bore him carefully along till she a reached the cavern. Here she laid him down f tenderly and going to a waterfall close by, she a filled'the hat, and returning, made him drink s a portion, and bathed his face, head, and hands 1   , with the rest. Suddenly a noise in the darkest I recesses of the cavern startled her. Thinking of a wolf, she drew her hunting-knife, and stood upon her defence. The animal came out from his lair, and stood before her, amazed, as one startled from sleep-a wild, haggard, half- famished fugitive slave, in tattered garments. Gertrude stood on her defence' with the raised knife. The man glared at her, a very wolf of desperation and ferocity. He seemed to meas- ure her size and strength, and then made a step towards her. "Stand " shouted the Amazon; and the man stood, arrested as by a shock. "Advance another step, and this knife is sheathed in your heart, and you are hurled to the bottom of these precipices. I am Gertrude Lion, and you know me. But pause, and listen, and I may- do you good." The haggard and wolfish features of the slave relaxed a little, as he said, in a hoarse voice "And you'll not set the constables on me, Miss Gertrude?" "Explode the constables1 no, I'd do you good, I said. Listen; I know you, Antony, you are Mrs. Armstrong's fugitive slave. Now, I don't adore Mrs. Armstrong myself, and if you will do me a favor, I will assist your es- cape from the State." "What is it, then, Miss Gertrude?" "You see this wounded boy? He was half killed by the breaking of his carriage; lie is too ill to be removed; watch by him here, bathe his face and hands, and keep up his strength by pouring water down his throat, while I re- turn to The Lair to fetch necessaries for him." "But if you should bring a posse with you to take me, Miss Gertrude." " "Why should I? Besides, would any ven- ture their neck in this terrible descent?" "That is true enough." "And Iam true." "And so you are, Miss Gertrude." "Certainly; reassure yourself; and here, take my knife. Now nurse your patient ten- derly, while I am gone, and when I return,-I will not forget you; I will bring you food, clothing, and a pass that will enable you to leave the State." Then kneeling, and placing her hand once more upon the pallid brow of her patient, and arranging his rude couch, ,she arose and hurried-, from the cavern, clambered up the rugged ascent, and sprang from peak to peak, uptil she had gained the spot where she had left her horse., He was no longer there.,: Placing her-   fingers to her lips, she blew a clear, shrill call, and soon her white horse came ambling up the side of the precipice towards her. She placed her hand upon his neck, leaped into the saddle, and sped like an arrow from the bow towards Tile Lair. It was late in the morning before-she re- turned, with linen, wine, and food. She found Antony faithfully watching his patient. With the aid of the restoratives she had brought, the young man revived. "Now, Antony," she said, " we must move him; but first, here is the pass I wrote for you." She took it out and read it- "Antony Burgess has my permission to again pass and re-pass from Peakville to Alexandria, free of molestation, between the first of June and the first of July inclusive. "GERTRUDE LIQN. "The Lair, -- Co., Va." "There, Antony, that is exactly the pass that I give to my own men when they want to t go to town. Now, it is true that you are not my own man, but that is no reason why I should not give you my consent to go where you please, since I have no objection to it; and so, when you present that, people will natu- rally think it comes from your owner. And even if it fails, it cannot get you or me into trouble, since I only express mny consent. Now, Antony, since they cannot te removed from this abyss, first inter that poor dead coachman, then take his clothes, dress yourself, take this food and wine, and this purse, and God bless you." "Shan't I help you to tote the young gentle- man up the rocks, Miss Gertrude?" "Oil, no; two carrying one burden could not climb the ascent, you know." t"Sure enough, Miss; but can't I tote him myself?"          / "No, no-you could not do it tenderly enough; besides, I doubt whether you are now strong enough. No, do you attend to what is left behind; bury the poor dead coachman, and don't forget to recite the ten commandments over the grave. Now, good-by." And shaking hands with him, Gertrude turned and lifted up her patient. "No, no-do not; you cannot,' muttered the young man, in a feeble voice--now seem- ing, for the first time, to note what was going on. "Hush," replied Gertrude, laying his head   -...... i -- y tenderly over her shoulder, while she let his arm rest upon his bosom, and drooped her own head, unconsciously, caressingly, over his silky curls. She left the cavern, and carefully picking her way among the rocks, not to jolt her pa- tient, began to climb the ascent, with unusual difficulty. "Oh, do not, do not; you will hurt your- self," very faintly murmured the young man, feebly struggling to get down. "Hush, hush-there, there, be still-that's a dear boy; be easy--that's a good boy." . He was still, from exhaustion, until they had nearly reached' the ascent, when the youth again grew restive. "Come, come, lie stillj be quiet, or I'll get mad, and I am dangerous when I'm mad; ask any one if I'm not," said Gertrude, as, resting a moment with her burden, she raised her fin- gers to her lips, and blew the shrill, clear call, that brought her white horse bounding towards her. Laying the youth on the horse's neck, and holding him there by one hand, she sprang into the saddle, and, gathering him to her bo- som again, she set off in a slow and easy gait to The Lair. Going down the opposite descent of this ridge, and passing through a defile, and climb- ing up another ridge of rocks, and passing down 'it, a tall and thickly-wooded mountain cleft, open near the summit, like the open crater of an extinguished,volcano, stood before them. The opening near this mountain-top was shaped like a mammoth tea-cup with a piece broken out of its side, the break being in front; or, as I said, like the partly caved-in crater of a burnt-out volcano. This crater was thickly and richly grown with copse-wood, and might indeed have served as the'lair of some fabu- lous giant. In the midst of this lofty green hollow, lurked a sli, half-ruined, old building of red sandstone, looking like a wild beast in his hole, gloomy enough to growl at you. Up this mountain, and towards this house, scram- bling over rocks, broken walls, and through tangled bushes and briers, Gertrude bore her charge. "What- the-lazes--are you doing, Ger- trude!" exclaimed Brutus Lion, entering the stone-paved kitchen of The Lair that evening. The Gerfalcon had swooped down before the great fireplace, and hovered there before a bright blaze that cast her shadow to the ceiling. "What the &evil are you doing, Gertrude!" again he asked, thrusting his hands into his   breeches pockets, and poking his head for ward. Gertrude started to her feet like a guilty thing, a saucepan in one hand and a spoon in the other, her sanguine blood crimsoning her brow. "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha-a-a-r!" shouted Brutus. "WHAT! you cooking; you I  You a ' coffee- brewing, cake-baking little fool?'" "HUSH!" muttered the giantess, in a deep, strong tone. "'Hush?' why, what in thunder am I to hush for?" "Be still, I say, or, please the loving Lord, I'll gag you, Brutus!" exclaimed the Amazon, setting down the saucepan, and stepping to- wards him. "Humlr 'I'll roar' you softly an' it were a sucking dove ;' but what's it all about, that these stone walls,Ahat usually resound with noise, must now be silent as the ' cushat's downy rest?'" "The doctor says he must be kept quiet." "What doctor Hwho kept quiet!" "The poor boy--the 'beautiful boy up stairs." "Boy up stairs " . "Yes, that was killed almost by having his carriage dashed to pieces." "Where-when--how?" "This morning, at Mad River Pass, by ta- king the wrong road down the precipice. "And he has been brought here!" "Yes; and the doctor has been here, and prescribed rest, and bandages, and salves, for his bruises-and wheys, and custards, and jel- lies, and what not, that I know nothing about. See, I've scalded 'myself already, trying to make this wine whey. Won't you be so good as to go over to the Dovecote, and fetch Zoe, and the schoolmaster, too, if he cannot be left behind; she knows how all these things ought to be got up." "Oh, the little ' dcoffee-brewing fool' can be made useful in a case of emergency." Very glad of any commission that would bring him in company with Zoe, who, by her father's command, had shunned him entirely for the last two months, Brutus tnrew himself upon his horse, rode rapidly down the moun- tain side, and entered the glen at the bottom of which the Dovecote lay. Winding down the circuitous path, he came in front of the cottage, as it rested against the back rocks. Throwing himself from his horse, he opened the little ! wicker gate, and here a sad sight met his view.                    4   r-  The flowers in the garden had al been plucked, and' many of them torn up by the y roots, and lay in bunches and piles around. n The cottage windows were bare of blinds, and r he saw through the open door that the pretty carpet was gone from the floor. On one side 3. of the house stood Zoe, clasping two white - Bantam chickens to her bosom, and tears were rolling down her cheeks. Zoe looked pale and a, wasted, and seemed to have passed through a spell of illness since he saw her last. Near a her stood the old schoolmaster, bent nearly double with age, infirmity, or sorrow. Twenty , years seemed to have passed over his hoary , head since Brutus had last met him. He was - feebly trying to tie the legs of chickens that he dropped into a hamper at his feet, already X half full of poultry. He turned tremblingly around, as he saw Brutus, and asked, in a quer- t ulous tone- "What do you come here for, sir B  Didn't I tell you to keep away from here? that I wouldn't have you here I It is very strange that you will persist in coming where you are not wanted." "Oh, Brutus!" wept Zoe, coming close to his side, " he has lost his mind-he who was so generous I he thinks of nothing but money. He' has carried to town-market all my things, and- sold them-my new carpets and quilts-- my new socks and gloves-my herbs and flow- ers. Well, I was sorry, but I did not cry for them, because they were dead things; but now, oh, now, he is tying my poor dear hens and chickens to take them to market to-morrow! Look-see I Poor dear Speckle; and-and- sweet darling Blossom-and-and-and now he wants to take lovely Snowdrop-and--" here. choking sobs convulsed the child's bosom, as she hugged her white Bantams closer to her bosom. ' What are you sobbing for, you miserable little wretch? Save your tears-you'll have a use for them. Hand me the -chickens here;- and if you weep, weep for yourself. I must, must make up. two hundred dollars, and I have / not got fifty yet ;" and the old man held out his trembling and claw-like fingers for the Ban. tams. "Give them up, Zoe, my darling; I will save them-save them all; not a feather of your pets shall be ruffled." After having showered  tears and kisses upon them, Zoe handed the Bantams to the old man,.  "Say, sir" exclaimed Brutus, touching the old man's elbow to arrest his attentionfor "the   schoolmhaster inhis occupation had apparently fBrgotten him; " say, sir!" "Well, you here yet I Didn't I tell you to go " ' "We have got a sick young man up to our house, and the doctor has ordered him to eat chickens. I want to buy a dozen." "Eh - yesl well what   these are good chickens, and must bring a good price; and since it is for a sick man, and since he is obliged to take them-say a dollar a pair." "Oh, father!" exclaimed Zoe- "Never mind-never mind--Zoe, dear, I'm no Jew.' That is it, sir! Ill take as many as you will let me have at that price." "Take them all," "Agreed, Well, my good sir, there is an- other thing-the doctor, besides ordering this rich young man to eat chickens, has ordered him to divert his mind by learhing Greek lessons." "Eh I well!" "And we want to engage a teacher for him in the house." "Eh I well, yes, what then?" "We were thinking of you, sir." "Ah, yes, to be sure. But then as it is to save his life-it is valuable, and must. be lib- erally compensated, this private tuition." "Certainly, sir; he is a wealthy English- man, and can afford it ; in the time of his ill- hess, I am his banker, and I can secure it to you," said Brutus, burdening his conscience with lie after lie. "Zoe, go pack up Herodotus, A2schylus, Eu- ripides, and Sophocles; go. When is it that you want me to come, sir!" To-night, sir, to be ready to commence in the morning:' " "Well, well. Yes, but what am I to do with Zoe!" "Sir, my sister, you know is a wild girl; she does not know how to prepare delicate dishes for an invalid, and all our negro women have run away, and so my sister told me to entreat her friend Zoe to come to The Lair, and give her some directions in these matters." "Yes, but Zoe ought to be paid. No, she shall not, either; I can't degrade Zoe." And the old man burst into tears. "Oh, what a wreck l" muttered Brutus,; look- ing down on the gray head, bowed upon the withered hands. At last he looked up imploringly to the -young man's face, and said- ( Brutus, I want to sell the Dovecote; how much will you give me for, it"I   "But I do not want to buy it, sir." "You don't? Come, I will sell it to you cheap. I must have money for Zoe's sake." "For Zoe's sake, sir I I love Zoe; I wish to marry Zoe; I will devote my life to her hap- piness; consent to our marriage, and her fu- ture is secured." "Brutus, you love her." "God knows it!" "Only her? "Only her, of all womankind." "Brutus, you cannot marry her." "You have said so before, but that does not prove it." "Brutus, swear that you will not divulge what I tell you." ?' I swear it, sir." ' ZOE IS A SLAVE 1" Brutus Lion reeled as if struck bya cannon- ball. "Great God, sir!" , And there are some in this neighborhood that know it." "Sir  sirl how did this come to your knowledge 8" 1"Two months ago, through an old midwife; yesterday, through Mrs. Armstrong' - "Through Mrs. Armstrong!" "Yes, yes; she sent for'"'me, and told me, advising me to get the child out of the State; but lord, poor baby, where can I send her, alone and unprotected?" "And who is the owner?" "Major Somerville." "And who are her parents?" "His slaves, Harriet and George." "Impossible!"  "TRUE, I tell you." "But the particulars! for God's sake give me the particulars i" "Well, then, this is it: You remember after my Greek class ]" "Yes." "How I came home one evening, and found no one here but you, with Zoe?" "Yes, yes! ' And I remember your agi- tation 1" "Well I might beagitated-" "Well I well!" "I had been dining with Major Somerville, and sat with him smoking our pipes until the sun got low--very low. Then I happened to think of my Greek class, and' I started to come home. I paced. down the steep of The Crags, and-turned into the deep dell that lies between my old school-house hill and the river.- At the bottom of this glen the woods are very thick,   the trees very tall, and their branches meeting overhead, together with the very high hills around and behind them, throw the path into deep shadow, like night at noon. Well, I had reached the middle of the glen when I over- took old Nancy Jumper, the midwife." '"Kate Jumper's white aunt 1" "Yes-well! She was riding slowly along on her mule. Oh 1 she's an ugly horror, more hideous, than her niece Kate-" ".Yes I well " "The path was so narrow that I could not pass her. She turned at the sound of my horse's feet, and said, ' Good evening, master.' ' Good evening, Nancy,' I replied. ' How is Zoe, master ' 'My daughter is well,' I an- -swered, not liking her familiarity; and a silence ensued. Still we had to keep company on the road. At last, without turning her head, she asked, ' What day is this, master?' ' The fifteenth of April.' ' I thought so I This reminds me of this day seventeen years ago.' ' Why 1' inquired I with some interest, remembering her calling, and knowing that it was the fifteenth of April, seventeen years ago, that toe was found on my porch. ' Because,' she replied, ' something strange happened to me in this glen, upon that very night' ' What was it, then?' I asked.        . "Now, my son Brutus, I will give you the story in her own words:- "' Well, master, that Friday, the first of April, airly in the morning, I had been called *upon to wait on a lady up in Rappahannock county. It was a mortal bad case-one of the worst of cases, and kept hnme there till near midnight, afore all was over. I would a' staid all night, but it was like for rain, and I memo- rized that my bedroom windows was left open. So when I had seen the lady and the child comfortable, I sets off for home, atween eleven and twelve o'clock. I wan't afeard, for I never memorize seeing nothink more worser than myself.' ' Likely not,' said I. ' No, sir; much as I have been called up at all-hours of the night to travel through the most lonesomest places, I never seen nothink more worser than myself-so I wan't afeard; So me and Jinny -not this Jinny I'm a riding of now, but her mother-so Jinny and me come along slow like, down this deep, narrow path, where you see it is dark enough in the daytime, but in a cloudy midnight it is the most darkest place as ever was hern tell on I Well, Jinny and me, we was a coming through this black hollow, when we got into the midst of the blackness, Jinny she started, driv' her- feet- plump into the-   ground, and stood stock still I I:seen nothink in the dark, and sure as rm a livin" sinner, master,- I thought Jinny seen a sperrit I - Now, I ain't afeard of nothink in the brute form, nor yet in the human form, but I must say as how I'm afeard o' sperrits, specially black ones. I bursted all over in perspiration, just as if I had been drinking of a sweat, and I said, ' In the name off the angels, and off the saints, and off the devils, what do you want '  ' Are you Granny Jumper ' says a gruff voice, says it. Says I, ' Yes' ' Well, you're wanted to, go to a lady. I have been at your house to look for you, and come from there to meet you, as the gal said you'd be sure to be coming home.' Then he -it was a he-comes up close to me and says, says he, 'Granny, this is a secret business' ' I'm used to sich,' says I. ' A young lady who has been privately mairied--' ' Without being beholden to the parson,' says I. ' You. are at fault; but this must be kept a secret, and you shall be paid well,' says he. ' But, Granny' says he,' you must be blindfolded.' ' I won't,' said I. 'Granny, do you know a guinea when you feel it?' 'Yes,' says I. 'Here are two, Suffer me to blindfold you and you shall have five more when the affair is' over' $'Weell' thinks I, 'the blessed fool may blindfold me, but it will go hard if I don't know the road he's a takin' of me.' So I let the man blindfold me, and then he led my mule down that path, and made a circle to fo61ol me, and took me by another path straight up The Crags. I kept the general route, well enough. Then we stops -dogs barks-he speaks to them, and they hushes. Then he helps me down, and takes my arm, and draws it through hisen. Well, when I was so close to him, I knows he was not one of my own color; still I never let on. He takes me through a door, and'through a room, and through another door, and up a fightt of stairs on the left hand, and into a room on the right. Here he took the bandage from amy eyes, and he might's well have left. iton. -The room was rayther darkish. He led me up to a bed as was curtained. Well, there was no light brought into the room uintil jist after the babe was born, and even then I did not see the mother's face, for she concealed it. The woman that brought the light in had her face muffled up in a shawl, and ehe6 took the babe and car- ried it out, with the light also; And' then, in the dark, came the same man, and blindfolding me, put five guieas in my hand, and took me away. Well, he took me by still anotherroad,- and left me in the m!tidlde of the same glen wherehe  had stopped me,'. Wel, itt: lvlee    nigh on to dawn when I got home. I was younger, and stronger then than I am now, and more usen to lose my rest; so, instead of going to bed at the dawn of day, I makes myself a strong cup of coffee, and goes across the river to pick horse-mint afore the dew was off. You know there's nothink like that grows on this barren side. Well, the sun wasn't nothink nigh up when I passes close to the Dovecote. I seen a woman going towards it with a some- think in her arms. The woman didn't see me. I stoops down where I was a gathering of the' horse-mint, and watches her. She. lays down her bundle on the porch, and, as she turned around to come away, I seen it was Harriet, Major Somerville's quadroon 'ooman. She looked ill and ghastly, and I know'd how it was her own child she had laid there. And I guessed her motive. I know'd how she and her ole man had been a tryin' to save money to buy the freedom of their first child, Anna, and I memorize of hearing her say that she never would bring another child into the world to be a slave, and I knew that she had concealed the birth of this child, and laid it at your door, that it might be fotch up as a free white child' "' Did you speak to Harriet when she turned from my cottage-gate 8' "'No, master. "'Why?' "'Because I did not wish to let on as I know'd any think about it.' "' Again-why I' "'La, master, keeping of things to myself comes sort o' nat'rel to me.' "Why, then, do you tell me now ' "'Why, master, you see for a reason. I am getting old, and a losing of my custom, and a wantin' of money, and it come to me as if I let on any think about the girl to old Major Som- erville's creditors, how they might pay me some'at smart for tellin! all about it; some'at to keep me in my old days-but I thought how I wouldn't like to 'sturb you, as you like the little gal, if you could manage yourself, to make me up a little something to keep me in my old days.' "In a word, Brutus, the old crone wished to extort money from me." "I hope you did not pay her to keep the secret, sir?" "I could not, Brutus. I did not even give her the least encouragement, to hope that I would." "I am glad of it, sir. This whole story sounds to me very much like an imposition."   "But it is not" "Not, sir i" "NOT 1 Listen, Brutus. Within a week, the old woman has divulged the secret." "How, sir?" "Yes, to Major Somerville's largest cred- itor!" "Oh, Heaven!" "Yesterday morning, Mrs. Armstrong sent for me. I went to her; she was in her bed- room, looking very ill, propped up with pil- lows in her easy chair. She has changed very much since her last visit to The Isle of Rays. 'I have sent for you, sir' she said, ' upon the most important business-your adopted daugh- ter, Zoe, sir. Are you advised of her origin ' I could not reply. I grew giddy, and turned pale, and she saw it. ' Sit down, sir,' she said -(she had not invited me to do so before.) ' I see, sir, that you know or suspect something of this girl's birth. May I inquire how long it has been since you have known or suspected this ' ' Madam, I know nothing.' "' Very well, sir I I do not insist upon your committing yourself by rash words; but let me tell you, sir, that I know all; and that I have sent for you from the kindest motives, to advise you to send this girl away from the State. She is the second daughter of George and Harriet, two slaves of Major Somerville. They dishonestly concealed her birth, to secure her education and freedom. This secret cannot 'be kept for ever. I have lately learned it, as others will. The creditors of Major Somerville are growing impatient. They will not molest him now-but he is in extreme age. If any thing were' to happen to him, they would swoop down upon his property, and -sweep it all away; and though, as Major Somerville's largest creditor, my claims are just, and pro- mise to forego them, yet others will not, or cannot afford to be so merciful. Therefore, I advise you to get your protege out of the State, with all possible expedition. It is a pity that a young girl, so nearly white as to pass for white, and with a mind and heart so rich and so highly cultivated, should be reduced to slavery.' And, ringing the bell for her servant, Mrs. Armstrong dismissed me.. "Well, Brutus, what do you think of this story?" "Sir, I am confused-amazed; but I think that when the devil or Mrs. Armstrong grows philanthropic, something is to be suspected, and people should be on their guard," moaned Brutus, in a tone of deep sorrow." "And I, Brutus. My brain reels, sometimes,   my memory fails. I am unable to fix my at- tention upon any thing. This child, Brutus! I loved her as my own 1" "Ah, sir 1" heavily sighed Brutus. "You do not know all she was to me!" "Oh, sir I yes, I do." "She was the life of my heart." "Oh I Heaven, sir! of mine too 1" "I called her Zoe--life 1" "God have mercy on us!" "I taught her GREEK!" "God have mercy on us l" again prayed Brutus, passionately clasping his hands. "Brutus!" "Sir!" "You can never marry her." "Oh! I know it," groaned the young man. "Therefore, Brutus, there must be no more love passages between you." "Oh! no, no, sir," sighed the Lion, dropping his shaggy head upon his hands. "If I take her to The Lair, where indeed she will be safer, in some respects, you will regard her misfortunes." "Yes, sir, oh yes 1 But tell me-does she- no, she does not-this unfortunate child-sus- pect her real position!" "Ah, no I have not had the courage to tell her yet-" At this moment the coming up of Zoe ar- rested their conversation. By nightfall they were all at The Lair. The old man, as is frequently the case with the ex- tremely aged, had, after this spasmodic clear- ing up of his intellects, relapsed into the con- fused, abstracted' condition of mind that had of late marked him. Immediately on reaching The Lair, Brutus had a fire lighted in a musty old study, filled with mouldy books, and conducting the school- master there, told him that that opened into a sleeping-room, and that they were to be his apartments. Here, seated at a wood fire, the old man fell into a reverie, forgetting even to inquire about his pupiL In the old stone-kitchen below, little Zoe busied herself in making a whey for the pa- tient, while Brutus walked moodily up and down the floor. Gertrude remained at the bedside of her invalid. She did not even join the schoolmaster, Brutus, and Zoe, at supper; but after supper; she came down, and sent Zoe up to watch, while she took some refresh- ments. -IThe schoolmaster had retired again to the musty study. Gertrude took aeseat near the window, and while she ate some strawher- ries, Ahe talked to Brutus. 8   "How is your patient, Gertrude?" he asked. "Feverish, restless, tumbling about his bed, and worrying himself to death about some State papers that must be returned to Wash- ington." "Where are they now 8" "In his coat pocket." "Send them to the post-office." "He will not trust them to our uncertain country mails; besides he knows that this is not mail-day, and it is of the utmost import- ance that these papers be in the Minister's hands the day after to-morrow. Unless his mind can be set at rest upon this subject, he will be excited into high fever, perhaps de- lirium. The physician, who left him just as you returned, says so. I was about to ask you, Brutus, if you could not possibly go to Wash- ington with these papers. Earthquake will take you there and back in two days. Oh! Brutus, you would so much oblige me if you would, and it might be the saving of the young man's life." Brutus mused-Gertrude coaxed. It seemed not unpleasant to Brutus to get away, if pos- sible, from torturing regrets. Nothing could happen, or at least was likely to happen, to Zoe, in so short a space as two days. "Brutus, I never asked a favor of you be- fore in my life, and I beg one of you now." "I will go, Gertrude." Indeed, both brother and sister were won- derfully subdued and softened-the one by pity-the other by sorrow-both by love. In order to lose no time, Brutus arose before dawn and called Gertrude,- who had watched by the wounded man's couch all night. Taking Gertrude down into the dark and silent hall, he there related to her the secret history re- vealed by the schoolmaster, at which Gertrude- expressed no surprise at all; on the contrary, she replied- "I suspected it all along." "You did, Gertrude. But from what cir-- cumstances!" "I can scarcely tell you. From the vaguest, things, that yet impressed me strongly; things. so intangible that they would vanish when Fr would try and seize and prove them. And, moreover, what I feel most certainly, is, that' Mrs. Armstrong is darkly, and perhaps crimi-- nally, implicated in this same business : "Your reasons? Your reasons?" - " cannot give any-that you would not setr down as fanciful and absurd. If I were to teW you, for instance, only-of certain looks, tones,. and gestures, upon certain occasions.-start   and pallors, upon the naming of certain sub- jects-you would consider them fantastical, as I do when I really examine them; yet I feel in my inmost heart that Mrs. Armstrong is criminally implicated in this affair. For, some- times, by little hints capable of a double mean- ing, I frighten her into the idea that I know something, when I know nothing."  Brutus groaned deeply, and then said- "Gertrude, old Major Somerville has been threatened with an apoplectic stroke. It is scarcely likely that any thing should happen before my return; but if it should chance that the old man is stricken down-his creditors only wait his death, to swoop down upon his property-in a word, Gertrude, if the sheriff should attach Zoe as his property, you will defend her?" ( With my life. Come, you know me." "You will not permit the constable to take her 8" "TAKE HER, Glory! We shall take the constables. I snuff the battle afar off 1" CHAPTER VL. DEATH AT THE CEAG&S. No-pleasures, hopes, affections gone The wretch may bear and yet live on. Like things within the cold rock found, Alive, when all's congeal'd around. But there 's a blank repose in this, A calm stagnation that were bliss, To the keen, burning, harrowing pain, Now felt through all that breast and brain. JMoore. "WHY is this? Why do I walk about in a conscious death, dead-seeming to live. Dead! yes, were the grave closed over me, I could not be 'more completely dead. And it would be better so, for then I should not be conscious as I am now. Death in the grave! why, that is not bad. The unconscious body lies there, and the freed spirit revels in liberty and space. Death in the gravel that were a boon. But it is this body that is a sepulchre where my soul lies entombed alive. !"I have no strength of heart to love, believe, -or hope-none. How cold and hard I grow. My poor old grandfather, old, sick, and poor, no longer moves my sympathy, because I think it is not such a misfortune to grow old and die. "Anna no longer shares my love., I wonder :at her habitual resignation, and cannot under-   stand it. A river of ice seems to have frozen between us. "I cannot pray or believe -as once, for hard thoughts of Providence come between my prayer and His throne. "Yes! my life of love, of lope, and faith is gone. I am dead-dead. Oh! Lord, complete- this dissolution; let me die, indeed, or else give me life-some, life-a life of. anguish, ra- ther than this conscious, living death!" Such were the half-crazy moanings of Susan Somerville when she returned home from the marriage of General Stuart-Gordon and Miss O'Riley. "Give me life or death I  Any life!- a life of anguish, rather than this conscious death!" It seemed as if her wild prayer had been heard and answered. Anna entered the room, pale and trembling. Susan -turned and looked at her with languid surprise. "Your grandfather, Miss Susan." "What of him!" "In a fit-dying!" "Oh, God; forgive me, and spare him 1" ex claimed the conscience-stricken girl, suddenly. thinking remorsefully of her repinings a mo- ment before. She hurried from the room wildly-paused in the hall, and asked hastily, "Where is he "' "In his room, Miss Susan." "Have you sent for the doctor?" "My father has gone, Miss Susan." "Who is with him?" she inquired, still hur- rying on. "My mother," Miss Susan. "Who found him?" "I did, Miss Susan. I went to call him down to dinner, and found him on the floor in a fit." "On the floor in a fit! Oh, my God 1 we have neglected him, Anna. Oh, Anna, we have neglected him 1" "I do not think so, Miss Susan." "He ought never to have been left alone a moment. Oh, Anna, not a moment! Oh, Anna, who knows how long he suffered before you found him 1" "Not five minutes, Miss Susan. He had been reading the Bible all the morning, while you were at church, and until you came home. When he saw you go up to your room to put off your bonnet, he went into the yard and plucked a bunch of wild eglantine roses, and told me to put them in water and set them on the table for you, and to call him to dinner when you came down; and then he went to '        i   his room, and in five minutes, or less time, I found him in a fit." 'The end of this rapid conversation brought them to the bedside of the invalid. Tears were streaming from the eyes of Susan as she gazed at the convulsed form and features of the old man. Even while she gazed, a violent spasm agitated the poor old frame. (Oh, what can we do for him!" she sobbed. "GGrandfather I dear grandfather! can't you speak to us?" "Hush, Miss Susan I He is past that-long past that." "Oh 1 what can we do for him?" "Nothing, Miss Susan, till the doctor comes. This is apoplexy." "Apoplexy I Oh, Heaven!" "Calm yourself, Miss Susan." "Grandfather I oh, dear grandfather, look at me! just look at me!" sobbed Susan, seeking to fix the glance of the rolling eyes. But there was no consciousness in those orbs. Dropping on her knee by the bedside, she took and kissed, again and again, the old, withered hand that hung helplessly over the quilt, and gave her- self up to a passion of sobs. "( Grandfather I Oh, I would give the best years of my life for one single word, for one single glance of rec- ognition. This poor hand I its last act was for me. Ingrate I oh, ingrate that I was." Again a violent fit of sobbing choked her utterance. "His. last words to me were, ' God love you, baby I' just as we set out for church, and his last words were,' Put these roses in water for Susan.' Ingrate I oh, ingrate, that I was." A spasm   again convulsed, the dying man. "Grandfather, oh, grandfather! if I could change places with you, God knows I would do it." A moan from the breast of the ,old man-a short, rasping respiration-a quick, violent spasm-and all was still. "He is at rest, Miss Susan," said Harriet. Susan started to her feet-gazed one moment on the stiffening face; a mist passed before her eyes, her head swam, her limbs failed, and she fell. Anna caught her, placed a cup of water to her lips, and drew her from the room -drew her to her own chamber, where Susan fell upon the bed and turned upon her face, extending her arms in an attitude of utter and helpless abandonment. And there she lay all day, and there she lay all night, without a change of position. Anna returned to the death-chamber to assistI her mother. The doctor had just come-nten minutes too late. Major Somerville died on Sunday afternoon.   On Tuesday, at the very hour that Brutus Lion was setting out for the metropolis, with- out having heard of what had happened at The Crags, ten miles off; they were making preparations for the funeral. The funeral took place on Tuesday after- noon. On Wednesday morning, Miss Somerville and Anna were sitting out on the piazza Both were in mourning. Susan was engaged, me- chanically; with her everlasting knotting work. Anna was reading to her from Felicia Hemans' poems. They had been left to Susan by Britannia O'Riley, who bestowed upon her, her whole collection of books, casts, and pic- tures before leaving The Crags. There were few who read poetry with more appreciation, sympathy, or finer elocution than Anna. She was reading the "Crowning of Corinne at the Capitol," and when she finished-- ,4 Radiant daughter of the sun! Now thy,living wreath is won. Crowned of Rome! oh, art thou not Happier in that glorious lot?- Happy, happier far than thou, With the laurel on thy brow, Is she that makes the humblest hearth, Lovely but to one on earth PI "Read on. I like it," said Susan. "There is the wail of a broken heart in every line she has written." But Anna resolutely closed the book. 1"This is unhealthy, Miss Susan, this is mor- bid in you, in Corinne, and in the poetess whose sweet but enfeebling strains we have just been reading. The heart of this ideal Corinne was destroyed by a conflagration of passion-what then I She had a glorious brain. It was im- possible to live in a ruin-what then I She might have lived in a palace. She had no life in her affections-well, she might have had a glorious life in her intellect. The soul lives in the heart and the head-in the affections and in the intellect. A strong soul driven out from its own wounded heart ascends into its brain, and finds a higher if a colder life. It is only in despair, in inaction, that such a spirit suffers long. The stronger the faculties of the soul, the more it suffers in inaction. An idiot will sit all day, and day after day, happy in idle- ness; an intelligent child will be miserable if' confined an hour without employment or amusement. An extremely aged person will sit week after week in the samel arm-chair, in the same corner of the same room, pleased and happy; a young peirson grows'weary if a day's rain confines him to the house; A feeble and   subdued prisoner will linger out years. in his cell in a sort of torpid resignation; a healthy, strong captive struggles and chafes in his fet- ters. The soul is a sort of prisoner in the body' -and the stronger and more healthy it is, the mote it chafes and frets, until it finds its life ia action-its freedom in action. A young person, full of repressed life, health, and energy--full of strong powers that crave their development-experiences a lassitude, a listlessness, a weariness of life, for which they cannot account, especially when they hear the season of youth spoken of as the season of joy. Such a young person will take to reading or writing sentimental poetry, and grow'weaker, more weary, and more useless every day. Now, sentimental poetry has its mission, but it is to soften the hard-not to liquefy the already soft. The cure of such brain-sick youth is not in that. Let any young man or woman, tormented by this terrible ennui, take my word for it, that the nature of their suffering proves them to possess great powers undeveloped. Let such seek their vo- cation, and pursue it. And this is a sure guide. Let them find out that useful occupation in which they take .the most pleasure, and then bring all the powers of mind and body to a focus to bear upon that point-to break down every obstacle, conquer every difficulty, and press onward to the end, however distant, how- ever difficult, however seemingly unattainable --for then at least the powers of the soul will be brought out in all their glorious life, energy, and joy Il Every one has his talent, and he will suffer in proportion as he lets it rust in his heart. And this I lay down as a rule, without an exception, that no healthy human being- however young, beautiful, loving, and loved- however intellectual, however wealthy, pow- erful, honored-that No HEALTHY HUMAN BEING CAN BE HAPPY WITHOUT LABOR. LABOR IS DES- TINY." "I am knotting," smiled Susan with a sad sarcasm, "yet I do not find in accumulating yards of cotton fringe and piles of toilet cov- ers and valances, any peculiar pleasure; nor am I sensible of any great happiness in count- ing these meshes." "That is not labor, Miss Somerville, though it serves to calm your nerves. That - is not labor; it goes on mechanically, almost without your consent; your fingers act as your heart beats, as your lungs breathe, itnvolunta- rily. You are strong and idle, and you want work, Labor is destiny!" "And how with your limited knowledge of:   L-J'.1 a IJnJL TV wav) the world and of books, have you arrived at that conclusion f" "One does not need a library, or a tour round the world,-Miss Somerville, to work out some things. All human nature is contained in one small village church-I had almost said, in one small child. All books of ethics and philosophy are contained in one pocket Bible. The Bible, a few histories, and a few poems, have been my library, as you know. The party at Mont Crystal was my tour of the world. For the rest, Miss Susan, while you  were loving, I was thinking. I saw. scores of young girls and young men at Mont Crystal, all seeming, at-first sight, bright and happy; but all in proportion to their strength of soul, deadly weary of the monotonous round of eat- ,ing, drinking, dressing, and flirting. Yet that was said to have been a very delightful party; the young people were said to have enjoyed themselves heartily. I know better; they tired of it in three days. and only continued it because nothing better offered by which to employ themselves. No-with all other means and appliances, toil is an indispensable requi- site to happiness. As I said, every one has his or her appointed work, and is tormented with restlessness until they have found it. What do you take most pleasure in doing, Miss Susan? I know--I have studied you, Miss Susan. You are happiest when working for others, without minding what that work may be. Miss Susan, you must seek a position where you can spend your days in the service of others. If I could choose a destiny for you, you should be the wife of some wise, calm, strong, country clergyman, with an extensive field of labor before him. But see, Miss Su- san," said she suddenly, " while we are talking, you are missing the effect of this beautiful moving panorama of clouds over the sky and river. The descent from The Crags to the river level is said to be monotonous, because almost destitute of vegetation-but look I it is varied with every form of rock, and every shade of gray. Gold in the sunshine and bronze in the shade I Every little fragment of stonejis gold on the one side and bronze on the other. Now, look at the sky and the river; see the gilded clouds sailing through the blue ether, and their shadows moving on the wa- ters! See The Isle of Rays, how it sparkles in- the sun 1" "Yet it is a forsaken and empty house." "Just now, yes; but it beams and scintillates all the same. And now raise your eyes to where Mont Crystal towers on the opposite   bank, with its white granite walls and rows of crystal windows glancing in the light." "Yes, but its cold splendor incloses an aged and solitary woman." "'You find gloom in every thing to-day, Miss Susan." "Alh! Anna, I cannot help it." "But look at this picture, that God has hung out before you. See how the sky smiles in blessing on the earth and waters. See how they smile back in love. See how the clouds combine, dissolve, and change, with a misty brightness, an ever-varying radiance. Did ever skies beam with more love-did ever earth smile with more gladness than now? Oh! look and listen, and acknowledge God in his works. The halls of the Island Palace are lined with the rarest works of the greatest masters. Recall that masterpiece of Claude Lorraine, and tell me if it approaches this in value, though that cost a thousand guineas, and could only be purchased by a millionaire; and this is hung out in the sight of all, for nothing. The soul of the artist was in that, but the soul of God is in this. The painter expressed him- self there-the Creator reveals himself here. How can you be gloomy, while God is smiling on you through the skies .l" Suddenly Anna grew pale-started as she gazed down the flight of rocks--turned, as by an instinctive impulse, to fly--seated herself again as by a second resolution, and gazed steadily out upon the rocks "What is the matter, Anna?" inquired Miss Somerville. Anna pointed to where three horsemen were just coming in sight, up the ascent. They approached the house, dismount- ed, and walked towards Miss Somerville and Anna. Anna grew paler still, trembled-then setting her teeth, and clinching tightly both hands, with a gesture full of strength of soul, she summoned her physical energies to their post. "Miss Susan Somerville, I presume," said the first man, lifting his hat to the young lady. "That is my name, sir," replied she, rising to receive them. "My name is Power, deputy sheriff of county." "Will you come in, Mr. Power!" asked Su- san, who heard this announcement with sur- prise, but not fear. She was ignorant of any cause she might have to dread the deputy sheriff "Thank you, Miss," he replied, and followed Susan to the sitting-room.   S  "Take a chair, sir." "No, I am much obliged to you, Miss," -he I said, setting his hat and whip down on the table, and rummaging in his pockets for a 3 paper. Susan watched him with increasing per- plexity. r Let me see; how many negroes have you ion the place, Miss Somerville!" "I have no domestics to hire out, sir," replied Susan, believing that she had now divined the motive of his visit. "How many slaves have you about the house, then, Miss Somerville." "None, sir." "What! my dear young lady." "Sir, I have my foster-parents, George and Harriet, who: brought me up, and my foster- sister and companion, Anna, who has always shared 'my. room, my table, and my school. They are quadroons. I do not call them slaves." "'They were the slaves of the late Major Somerville, however!" "Yes, sir." "And they are yours now." "No, sir! I do not for a moment acknowl- edge any right in myself to .hold them. My dear grandfather's funeral took place only on yesterday afternoon, and to-morrow morning I go to Richmond to take measures for their emancipation!" said Miss Somerville, in a cold, severe tone-for now she believed herself in conversation with a would-be purchaser. "Will you f Ah! yes,. well I A generous and praiseworthy design on your part, my dear young, lady," said the deputy sheriff, perceiv- ing for the first time that Susan was entirely unsuspicious of the object of his visit. "Will you, however, let me see these people, my dear Miss Somerville i"' "Oh, he is the tax-gatherer l" thought Susan. "Certainly, sir," she replied; then, turning to Anna, she said, "Anna, will you call your parents!" Anna, who had conquered herself, and now stood calm, cold, and impassible, went out to obey. "Is that one of them?" "Yes, sir." "That girl 8" "Yes, sir." "Why, she is white!" "Very nearly, sir." Anna now returned to the room with her parents. Poor George entered from his work-   bench, with his white felt hat on his head, and a wisp of fine-cut flag and his working knife in his hand. He pulled off his hat at the door, and stood waiting to be spoken to. Harriet stood by him, with her hand resting on his arm. Anna went and stood by Susan. "Your name is George, my man?" asked the deputy sheriff, seating himself at a table, and taking out a pocket apparatus for writing. "Yes, sir." "Your age 8" asked the sheriff, beginning to write. "Sixty years, sir," replied George. "And your wife's name is Harriet ." "Yes, sir." u Her age?" he inquired,-continuing to make notes. "Forty-five, sir." "That young girl is your daughter!" "Yes, sir," replied the father, the 'muscles of his face twitching. "Her name-age 8" "Anna-aged eighteen," answered the poor father, in a broken voice, clutching the old white hat convulsively. The sheriff now went to the door, and called in the three men who had remained in the piazza Two of them entered and remained standing near the door. The third accompanied him to the table. "Thiis is Mr. Jones, the assessor, Miss Somer- ville," he said, as they passed Susan. "I thought that you were the assessor, sir," said Susan, simply. "No, Miss," said the deputy, without smiling at her mistake. "Jones," he said, addressing the assessor, "look at that man and tell me how much you think him worth." "How old is he V" "Sixty." "Hum I he looks nearer seventy; but these mulattoes break down very early. He .looks very worthless." "Say one hundred and fifty dollars T" "Ye-e-e-s-scarcely that-" "One hundred?" "Well-ll; ye-e-es!" , Look at the woman. What is her value?" How old is she!" ;"Forty-five," she says. "She looks more like fifty. Put her at-at -Has your wife good health, my man!" "Yes, sir," sighed George. "Well I there is some work in her yet. Put her at two hundred dollars." "Now, then, for the girl; you see what her personal appearance is-.eighteen years old;   well educated, and all that-now, what is her value?" The assessor looked at Anna; and, as his sensual eyes roved all over her girlish figure, gloating on her beauty, he muttered an ex- clamation- "She is a handsome girl, and it would be a good specd to take her to New Orleans. She'd bring twelve or fifteen hundred dollars!" "Gentlemen," said Susan Somerville turning towards them, "you will do me a favor by getting this assessment over as quickly as may be. Set your valuation as high as you please. I do not care for a few dollars more or less of taxation, but I do care to have my privacy in- vaded and my friends here subjected to this indignity-the last, if it please Heaven, that they shall ever suffer, for to-morrow I will take measures for their immediate emanci- pation! Pray, gentlemen, be expeditious- will you a?" "A moment, young lady, a moment. At what do you value the wench, Jones?" The assessor walked towards Anna, still keeping his brutish eyes riveted upon her; and, walking around her as though she had been a horse for .sale, he lifted his lhand to turn her about. "DEATH! Hands off my daughter, sir 1" ex- claimed the hitherto patient George, springing to his child's side. But, even before he had reached her, the calm-souled dignity of Anna, breathing through every look and attitude, had repulsed him. He returned to the table. "She would bring fifteen hundred or a thou- sand dollars in New Orleans." "That is not the question ; what would she bring here?" "Gentlemen, I beg of you"--commenced Susan Somerville. "Be patient, young lady. What is her value here, Jones?" "Gentlemen, I insist"-began Susan again, with her cheeks burning and her eyes flashing, "I insist that this is arrested. I command you to finish your business and leave us." "One instant, Miss Somerville. Well, Jones, her value is-" "Three hundred dollars i" "My dear Anna, can you forgive me, that this outrage is offered you before my face!" "You cannot help it, dear Miss Somerville," replied Anna, calmly. "Have you done, gentlemen?" indignantly demanded Miss Somerville, as the deputy and ;the assessor folded up their papers and re-   turned them to their pockets and proceeded to button up their coats, " have you done, gentle- men?" "Miss Somerville," began the deputy, "I have now to perform a very painful duty; a simple and short one, however." "Yes, as short as an execution," muttered George. '; Miss Somerville, I attach this property at the suit of Spier & Co., Grocers, Peakville." Susan started to her feet, clasped her hands, and turned deadly pale, as the truth suddenly struck her. Anna stood still and white. George and Harriet threw themselves in each other's arms, with a cry. "To 1 HE DOORS, Briggs and Brown 1 look to the doors!" shouted the deputy, whom this action had. alarmed, springing to his feet. The two constables sprang to the doors, securing them. "Cock your pistols 1" "It is unnecessary, sir; we will make no resistance," said George, gently disengaging the arms of his wife from about his neck. - "Oh, my Saviour, my Saviour, have mercy on us 1" cried Susan, wringing her hands. "Be patient, Miss Susan, dear Miss Susan," said Anna, caressing her. "Have you the handcuffs, Jones!" "Yes; here they are." ' Oh, my God, no I! you will never do that," cried Susan, in anguish. "My dear young lady, if men were turned by the tears of women, eve should never do our duty. Give me the fetters, Jones; here, we will secure the two women together, and then the man by himself."  - And the deputy, taking the fetters, went up, to the spot where Anna and her nmther now stood, locked in each other's arms. "You SMALL NOT D rr 1 Away I You SHALL NOT DO IT!" shouted George, bounding between his wife and child and the officers, and brandishing his knife-all the latent and terri- ble ferocity of the MXED BLOOD leaping, like forked lightning, from his eyes. "I have, been patient, I would have fol- lowed you like a whipped hound follows his master; you might have handcuffed me, but not them. See, I am her father; and I will bury this knife in your heart or in hers, sooner than you shall place a fetter on her, wrist." "What! the devill    You d-d mulatto rascal, do you resist an officer of the law!" e To TuE DEATX j in tis caset    With no more ado, the deputy suddenly raised the end of the loaded whip and brought - it down in a sharp and stunning blow upon the head of the gray-haired slave, who dropped in a heap at his feet. With a piercing scream, Susan Somerville sprang forward, and fell upon her face in a death-like swoon. Harriet, pale with terror, clung helplessly to her daughter. Anna alone was self-possessed. "Sit down, dear mother, and let me attend to Miss Susan and father; or, mother, try to attend father while I get Miss Susan up stairs." And gently easing her trembling mother down upon a chair, she went to Susan's side, and, lifting her head, and addressing her- self to one of the men who had taken no part in this violent scene, beyond guarding the doors, she said "Will you be so good as to lift this young lady and bring her up stairs with me fo.. The man looked at his superior for permis- sion. "Yes, take her along," said the deputy; "it's the devil's own business, an affair of this kind, where there are so many women about." And the officer raised Susan in his arms, and bore her after Anna, who led the way up stairs. Taking advantage of Susan's swoon, Anna's absence, and George's insensibility, to finish the affair quickly and quietly, the deputy sheriff attached the little old family cart, the old fam- ily horse, and harnessing it up, bound George and laid him in the bottom of it; placing Harriet, who willingly accompanied him, by his side. Then, leaving a bailiff in charge, the deputy set off for the county town. They were a mile from The Crags before Susan Somerville recovered from her swoon; She recovered painfully with spasmodic twitchings-opened her eyes, groaned, shiv- ered, closed them again. Soon reopening them, she looked around, and, seeing Anna, said- "Anna I Anna i are you there I Oh, Anna, I have had the most dreadful nightmare!" and sighed heavily again, and covered her eyes with her hands, as- shudderings convulsed her frame. Then flaring her eyes wide open, she started up in bed, cauglt both Anna's hands in her own, and gazed long and searchingly in her face. Then groaning, "Oh my God I It was no dream I It was true f' fell back and covered her face with her hands In a few   minutes, without uncovering her face, she in- quired, "Where are they, Anna!" "' Gone, Miss Susan." "I mean your mother and father T" "Gone r' "Oh, my God! And you, mnna " "I am left here in charge of a bailiff until some other assistance can be sent to you. Perhaps I shall stay all night with you. And now, Miss Susan, pray and try to calm your mind, for to-morrow you must do something." "What is it, Anna I Oh, suggest something that I can do, and never fear but that I shall get better, and grow strong enough instantly to do it. It is the helplessness of our situation that makes me despairing and ill." "Then, Miss Susan, you had better write to General Stuart-Gordon; he will assist us, with- out doubt. Notice will have to be given a cer- tain number-of days before any sale is made, and in that time General Stuart-Gordon can be heard from.' "I will write-to-night, Anna." "No, Miss Susan, you could not hold a pen; to-morrow will be quite time enough." "Alas I Anna, what has not ' to-morrow' cost us already? It was to-morrow that I was to have gone to Richmond to see about doing you justice! Ah, Anna! if I had gone to-day, you and your parents might have been saved!" "Not so, Miss Susan I We were watched; they would have followed and attached us on the road." "Ah! if I thought it was inevitable I should not suffer such pangs of remorse; but, oh I I' fear it was my delay alone. Yet: I never dreamed of an execution." "It was inevitable, Miss Susan. You could not help it. Try to be composed." "You are so composed, Anna I How is it that you are so composed a" "Ah, Miss Susan, a misfortune long looked for does not startle one when it arrives." "You expected this long, then?" "For more than six months, Miss Somer- ville." "Ah why did you not tell me F" "You could not have averted it; why tor- ment you with it, then, Miss Susan T" "Then, when I supposed you to be grieving over your own position, you were only dread- ing this catastrophe?" "That was it, Miss Susan." "Oh, my dear Anna I I have never done you justice." "Try to rest, Miss Susan."   'A silence ensued. Anna supposed Miss Somerville to be composing herself to sleep, but presently the low sounds of weeping, un- der the sheets, stole on her ear. At last- "Anna, are you there yet!" murmured Su- san. "Yes, Miss Susan." "Go to bed, Anna! PDo go to bed. Some- thing must be done, if it be in the power of human tears, and prayers, and persuasions. I will humble myself to these men, Anna. Oh! if human hearts can be moved by human misery, you shall be saved, Anna." "Ah!" thought Anna, "they will have but one answer to your prayers, Miss Susan--' the law 1" but she said, "Yes, hope, Miss Somer- ville." And feeling that Susan could not grow quiet unless she herself seemed to rest, Anna lifted Susan's hand, pressed and kissed it, and bade her good night. Susan turned on her pillow, seeming to sleep, but really busying herself with a thousand impossible plans for saving her foster sister, and redeeming George and Harriet. Anna withdrew to the window to draw the curtain and exclude the moonbeams, that her mistress might sleep more quietly. And she looked out upon the rocks falling down to the river, the river and the banks floating in a flood of silvery radiance, and The Isle of Rays glancing towards the sky in streams of light, like a sheaf of diamond-tipped arrows. She whispered, "Oh, beautiful! My old father- my gentle mother! it is in the midst of God's beautiful creation that these deeds of hate are done. Yet, not of ate-let me be just. Let me be patient. Let no passion of mine distort a local 'necessity into a deed of hate. Oh, thou Crucified! who rememberedst amid the agony of the cross that Thy executioners knew not what they did, and prayed for them, give me a portion of Thine own divine calm- ness, patience, and justice. Let me remember the position, the education, the prejudices, the undisciplined passions of these men, and do them justice. How beautiful, how holy, this night. How sublimely calm. Let no storm arise in my own bosom to desecrate this holy calm." And, oh! a divine peace was let down from Heaven into the depths of her spirit, and her heart was flooded with patience and love, still dilating into a strange joy. "What is this? oh, angels I what is this? Every thing, from the centre of my own spirit to the bounds of creation, 'seems expanding brightening, and rising."   A heavenly languor was stealing over her frame; she bowed her head upon the window- sill and fell asleep. Heavenly dreams, visited her-the walls of the room disappeared-the horizon expanded -the sky was lifted up-the heavens opened -the wings of angels brightened the sky-the voices of angels made melodious the air. Oh, ye sorrowing! make clear the paths of the angels to your souls. Dismiss anger, fear, and selfishness, that the angels may come and minister to you.

Byron. IT was a queer place-the chamber where i young Frobisher lay at The' Lair. The house being near the top of the mountain peak, and I the room near the top of the house, it looked f down a  dizzy height.           i The side of his bed was placed against one 1 of the front windows, so that the patient had f only to turn over towards it to enjoy a  sub- a lime prospect from the top of this loftiest peak. t This window had been so obscured by cobwebs h and fly-stains as to make a curtain superfluous, t   jr until the arrival of the neat little housewife, S- Zoe, who at once washed it off, and sent to the Dovecote for a clean, white muslin cur- f tain, which was always looped back to per- d mit the invalid to look out. This, with Zoe's d new blue-and-white quilt, made the chamber e look neat and comfortable enough, "consider- ing." f  Imagine an elephantess in a poultry-yard, , tripping it lightly and softly about, for fear of I treading on the young chickens, and you will have some little notion of how our Amazon stepped about the sick room of her patient upon the morning after Brutus had left home for the metropolis. It was very difficult for Gertrude to step softly or speak low. She was in the habit 'of shouting, roaring, leaping, , .unning, and demolishing every thing she hap- pened to touch, and otherwise expending her * excess of vital energy; and now she tripped about the room as awkwardly as a condor in a quadrille might do. Zoe was in the room, too, but gliding so spirit-like about, that you would scarcely have known her presence. Their pa- tient was-supposed to be asleep. "Hush-sh-sh-sh I Gertrude," whispered Zoe, as the former brought down a vial on the ta- ble, with the bang of a hammer on the anvil, shivering the vial in the act. "Sh sh-sh! ain't I sh-sh-ing all I can? I do wonders. Something will happen to me yet, with all this 'sh-sh-sh-ing.' Didn't I like to fall down stairs by coming softly up? And I shall break a blood-vessel, too, by trying to talk low-I know I shall; keeping in so much breath will explode my ribs-I know it will!" " "Hush-sh-sh, Gertrude; don't whisper; a whisper in a sick-room is more annoying than a talk," murmured Zoe, moving from the chabm- ber, as the most effectual way of preventing. conversation. Left alone, Gertrude stepped up to the side of the bed, and, tossing back her heavy fall of yellow hair, stooped over the sleeping patient. He was lying with his face towards the win- dow, his eyes closed, his black silky hair drop- ping soft shadows over-his temple and throat. Gertrude looked over him as one might look at a very charming picture, or a beautiful sleep- ing child, and a smile dimpled her mouth, and half closed her eyes, as she looked-then the fair Amazon cautiously put out one finger,and softly touched a black curl that coiled upon the transparent temple-then suddenly drew back her band, as though she feared that at a touch this Adonis might blow  up, or melt away.   Still she looked at the sleeping face, as the. child looks at something very charming and curious, but which it is forbidden to meddle with. "Oh, he is so beautiful I so beautiful!" she murmured to herself, still curiously fasci- nated lby the exquisitely delicate features and complexion. At last, however, as she looked, she saw the black eyelashes of the youth begin to tremble on his white cheeks, and the corner of his chiselled lips began to quiver with sup- pressed humor. Her sanguine blood rushed to her brow just as he lost command of his coun- tenance, and opened his eyes with an angelic smile. "I was not asleep, dear Gertrude!" "Oh 1 thank you for confession immedi- ately following detection," said the Gerfalcon, moving from the bedside. "Come back, dear Gertrude, I want to talk to you." "No-you must sleep." "I cannot, Gertrude; I, have had sleep enough." "But you haven't," said Gertrude, return- ing; " you have not. Come, shut your eyes, and go to sleep-that's a good boy--do-that's a dear boy-think what your mamma would say if she knew how you trifled with your precious health. Come, now, shut your eyes, and go to sleep, While I draw these curtains-- that's a sweet boy t" and -stooping down, Ger- trude placed her two hands each side of his head, patted him, and ran away. "What a strange girl! and how singular that she talks to me as though I were a child! But, perhaps, it is not so strange, since every American youth I have met looks older at fourteen--in the face, at least-than I do at twenty-six; that is the reason she takes me for a boy. Well I that mistake is not un- pleasant in some of its effects. What a mag- nificent girl! the largest woman I ever saw, yet the most elegantly proportioned, and the most delicately finished. There is nothing coarse in her vast beauty. Why, her finger- ends, her eyelids, her nostrils, have that ex- quisite transparency, that fineness of fibre, belonging' to the highest order of Caucasian beauty. But where are my thoughts wander- ing to now. I began by thinking how I should delight my friend Lawrence, by giving him a sketch of this Amazonian beauty found in the wilds'of America-I have ended with-- Well I I must not have those soft fingers clasp my face-rich lips hover over my lips so often!" And the youth raised himself on his elbow, shook his pillow vehemently, turned it, and   ,uL- . J^ L IT VM v, dropped again exhausted.  While looking through the window, his eye roved over mountain, wood, and water. "Oh, how I wish my friend Turner were only here, to paint this scene. Singular, they roam all over Europe -ground that has been travelled, painted, and described, until every part of it is familiar to all-while these unknown scenes of wildest beauty, of theonost terrible sublimity, remain unsought," he murmured; then, "Pshaw! I talk of one thing and think of another. That peerless girl! She is unique I! there is but one of her species! The clearest, purest eyes, the clearest, purest soul that ever any one looked through and through. That wondrous girl  She draws me towards her with the force of a maelstrom. I wonder who she is-who brought her up?"Then rising on his elbow, lie looked' out again upon the mountain-scene, while his thoughts roved from one subject to another with feverish vehemence. Growing tired of this occupation, he took a stick that stood near the head of his bed, in lieu of a bell, and struck it three or four, times on the floor. Soon he heard a rushing up the stairs, and Gertrude entered, bearing a clean shirt in one hand, and a bundle of linen in the other. "Ah! you have slept. That is right. You are strong enough to have your wound dressed and change your shirt, and then you shall have abroiled partridge for dinner. Zoe is broiling it now." And, approaching the bedside, she laid down her bundles and began to open his shirt-bosom to dress his wound, saying, all the time, "Now, don't wince, don't shrink; I won't hurt you, tough as I am-indeed I won't. There, be- a good boy, and take it patiently." After she had finished dressing the wound, he said- "Thank you, dear Gertrude. I will trouble you to bring me a glass of water." "Yes, certainly," and she went below; and, by the time the young man had performed his toilet, she returned with the glass of water, fol- lowed by Zoe bearing his nice little dinner on a tray. He took no more notice of Zoe than if she had been a little kitten. When the meal was over, Zoe took up the tray and left the room. Gertrude was about to follow, when the young man called her back. "T Will you not remain with me an hour, dear Gertrude, to help me to while away the tedious afternoon!" "Oh, yes I certainly. I only want to go down and feed Borealis; then I'll return." "Borealis 1" "Yes-my white horse."   "Oh n" And Gertrude left the room for about half an hour. "Decidedly, Frobisher, you will have to do one of two things-make up your mind to woo and wed this young Amazon, or to avoid her altogether. I wonder what sort of an education she has received?"Seeing Gertrude return and take her seat by his bed, he turned around on his pillow, rested his head on his hand, and asked- "Will you read to me, Gertrude?" "Oh, yes!" said the Gerfalcon, rising and going into another room. Presently she came back, took her seat, and, opening her book, prepared to commence. "What have you got there, Gertrude?" "It is the legend of the Seven Champions of Christendom. It is a very grand thing. Takes my breath quite away to read it, al- though few things have the power to do that. Yes, a great work this I! such splendid fight- ing!" "Is that your first favorite, Gertrude ]" "Yes; but I have others." "And what may they be?" "Oh, I like St. George and the Dragon, Una and the Lion, and a German story Brighty read to me once-the Wild Huntsman-" "That who read to you?" "That Brighty, Mrs. General Stuart-Gor- donl-'i "Ah I you know her then?"     g "Yes; do you?" "I have met her; but now tell me your other favorites." "Well, I like all those I named, because they had -uch splendid riding and racing and fighting and flying all thrqugh it ;-but, oh I my favorite of favorites 1" "Well, dear Gertrude, and what is'that?" "Oh, Milton's Paradise Lost I Milton's Para- dise Lost I .Oh I there was magnificent fight- ing there HHeaven and Hell in battle-array --all space for a battle-field-the throne of the universe the stake-and angels and devils hurling planets at each other 1 Oh, that was a touch above the sublime. I can conceive that it took a blind man to write that 1" "Yes, dear Gertrude, a blind man-a man in spiritual as in visual darkness. War in heaven I Gertrude, does not that strike you as horrible blasphemy?" "No, it don't."  "Well I we will not argue that question c now. Now, Gertrude, is that all your read- r ing?" "Yes, I believe so.-    "You should read history, and travels, ami f voyages, Gertrude. I  "Oh, I do." "Ah, that is well. What history and whose travels do you read 8" "Oh, I read the history of Jack the Giant- Killer, and Gulliver's Travels, and the Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor. Hush what are you i laughing at, boy I If you laugh so loud as that, you'll make your nose bleed-no, I mean your wound." The young man was, in fact, laughing very heartily. "Come! I shall get mad. I think it is very improper for boys to laugh at their elders." : "I beg your pardon, dear Gertrude. Now, go on with your reading." "I won't; there now I You have put me out, and so you may just do without it." "I submit, dear Gertrude," said the young man, in his mellifluous tones. Gertrude looked at him, with her blazing eyes a little softened. "Oh, I'll read to you," then she said. "No, Gertrude." "Oh, but I will." "I will not hear you now, Gertrude." "But I was only joking, my boy." "Nevertheless, I will not trouble you." "You are angry I that's what you are!" ex- claimed the Amazon, bursting into fury, throw- ing down the book, and. sending it with her foot to the opposite end of the room. "Yes I you are angry! that's what you are. Now, if you are angry, why don't you quarrel and have done with it, and then hear the reading. Why don't you quarrel, and not lay there say- ing ' No,' and' No,' in your flute tones, to make me miserable. I never was crossed in my life, and I won't be crossed nowl and made miserable by a refractory boy I and I'll let you know, sir, that your tutor is in the house, and, if you do not behave yourself, he shall come up and give you a lesson in Greek. Why don't you quarrel, hey a What are you sulking about? If you are angry, why don't you quarrel? You won't? Well, I don't care-a dumb devil is better than a talking one!" "Gertrude!" The two syllables fell on her ears like two low, sweet, full music notes. She wheeled abruptly round to see him looking at her with his large, tender eyes. With a quick revulsion of feeling, Gertrude burst into tears, and hurl ried towards him, covering him with caresses. "Poor boy  poor boy! ft is I who am  a  barbarian I but then I always was so used to   Brutus. He quarrels back again, and we get our accounts evenly balanced. So I am not fit to deal with a gentle boy like you.", "Let us now return to the subject of your books'" "Shall I read to you?" "Oh I you won't let me do that. You are stubborn." "What other books have you read?" "None others at all, except the heathen my- thology." "And you like that 8" "Oh I very much indeed. The schoolmaster used to tell us that these heathen fables were a bunch of keys-that each fable was a key to unlock the mystery of some truth, if we would but fit the key into the right lock." "Who brought you up, Gertrude?" "Nobody I I came up of myself." "Who educated you T" "The schoolmaster." "Satisfactory that-" "If you mean who raised me, Brutus did." "Only Brutus 8" "Yes! that is, we were left in charge of an old grand-uncle, but he fell into dotage before I can remember. Brutus took care of me-" "Ahl that explains every thing. So you never had a mother's or any female relation or friend's care in your infancy and child- hood." "I had an old black nurse, who used to curse and shake me when she got angry, and smo- ther me with offensive caresses when she was in a good humor, until I got big enough to scratch and bite and resist, and then Brutus took me away from her, and took care of me himself" "How old are you, Gertrude?" "Ham nineteen." "How old were you when your mother died?" "My mother died the same hour that I was born; my father died four years after." "Poor girl 1" "But, poor boy, are you sure you are not hurt by my rudenessI Oh, I am so sorry about it I I would not hurt you again for the world. Say, are you sure t" The youth pressed her hand affectionately as an answer; then- "Who are your friends and companions, Gertrude!" Oh, I don't know; almost every body in the county knows me. They don't like me, I believe, but that is because they don't know   how well I like them, and I have not time to teach them." "Then you are no favorite in your neigh- borhood?" "N'-no. You see the young men give me nicknames-call me the Gerfalcon, and what not; and old men bob their chins down in their neckcloths, draw down the corners of their mouths, and look at me over the tops of their spectacles; and young ladies glance over their shoulders, avert their eyes, and. whisper together when I come among them." "So you have no friends, Gertrude, besides having no relations?" "Oh, bless you, yes; these people are not my enemies, only they do not know how to take me, you see; and for friends, I have one verv dear friend-little Zoe, who broils. your partridges; only I don't intend to let Brutus marry her; and there is Britannia, who does me justice. Ah, by the way, you said you knew Britannia; how did you know her?" "She is my cousin." "She your cousin I Ah, now that you tell me, I declare I see a resemblance. Your hair and eyes are bluish black, like hers, and your complexion very fair, like hers-only that her cheeks and lips are of rich carnation, and yours are so pale-oh, so very pale," said Ger- trude, her eyes softening, as she laid her hand upon the pallid forehead of the youth, " so pale. Oh, how could I have been such a bear as to growl at you, my poor boy I Ah, well, you came down here to see Brighty as your cousitn?" "Yes, dear nurse." "Won't you tell me something about your- self, now?" "Yes, dear Gertrude, and more than you expect to hear, perhaps:- 't Gertrude, in the neighborhood where I was born and brought up, in Ireland, there are hundreds of miserable men and women living in mud huts, on lumps of hard ground, spat- tered about (so to speak) through a vast morass. This great marsh is all that is left of the once valuable estate of Clonmachiiois. The Earl of Clonmachnois' died last winter in ex- treme poverty, leaving nothing but the marsh, the ruined house, and the empty title to his heirs. The sole heiress of this swamp, ruin, and coronet, is my cousin, Britannia O'Riley. Before the death of the old Earl, I used to walk about the margin of that vast bog, and saying to myself-' Here are hundreds of men, women, and children, starving in idleness; here are hundreds of acres of ground, pro- ducing nothing but malignant fevers; if these   acres were drained, they- could be made to support this population; there is work to be done, and people starving for the want of work; it only needs capital to adjust the one want to the other.' I was wealthy; I would gladly have purchased this bog from the old Earl, and, with my own means, have set the peasantry to work, and drained it or filled it up.  That would have given the starving people present rork and wages, and opened a fair prospect in the future to, all concerned. "Unfortunately for my project, the old Earl refused to part with any more of his acres. When he died, I went immediately to London -saw a relative who waA in the cabinet-re- lated to him all my plans and wishes for my native parish, and received from him the sug- gestion of seeking out and marrying the heiress, and then applying for the reversion of the title, which would give me a seat in the House of Peers, and so greatly facilitate my dearest pro- jects for Ireland. :At first, Gertrude, I revolted at the idea of looking up an heiress for the sake of marrying her; but after much thought, I decided that, as my heart was really free, as the happiness of hundreds depended upon my getting possession of that marsh, that I would seek out the young heiress; and, if I should love her, and be so happy as to win her love, that I would offer her my hand and fortune. Having gained a clue to the young lady's resi- dence, I obtained, through my relative, an ap- pointment as attache to the present embassy; came out, and, through an advertisement, dis- covered the abode of my cousin, and came and found her sufficiently beautiful, elegant, and accomplished, to grace the highest circles, and found her, only to see her marry another 1" Gertrude had been silent all this time. At last, sighing vastly like a rising gale, she asked, "And did you-did you-did you fall in love with Brighty?"  Why, no," smiled the youth, " not precisely.  I had built some aerial castles, it is true, but" a -then, sighing deeply, said, "it is a serious 1 disappointment to me-the downfall of my   I hopes for Ireland."             a Gertrude re-echoed his sigh. Gertrude was 1 puzzled  also.  She could not reconcile the 1 delicate features and complexion, the almost e infantile clearness of brow, with the manly discourse of her patient. She did not call him I "my   boy" again, and she did not caress him after that. At last she ventured to say,  G "I wonder how old you are IF$      at The young man smiled again, as he -looked A gently at her, and replied,^        e   to  "I am twenty-two I be  "Twenty-two   No, you can't be. Louis ff Stuart-Gordon is only eighteen, and he looks ne much older than you do." Id  "That is because he is an American, and I Id am an Irishman. Even children's faces dry ie and wrinkle in your dry climate, while men it and women retain an infantile freshness and ., ig softness of complexion long past middle age, Id in the climate of England and Ireland." d.  "Your countenance is very fair and clear, rl and oh! you have one beautiful place on your s face." n  "Where, Gertrude!" -  "Oh! just between your eyebrows, so y open, so clear, so benignant; it reminds one of celestial arches, of rainbows, and of angels." a,  The furious yelling of the dogs started Ger- e, trude to her feet. She ran to the window. f  "What is the matter with them, Gertrude!" "It is the bailiff," she exclaimed, her color d rising, her eyes sparkling, as Ohe hastened from e the room. "It is the bailiff. Now   For rr. , GLORY!" CHAPTER    VIIL THE TWO ATTACHMENTS. Wouldst beard the lion in his lair- The tigress in her den? Scott. WHEN Gertrude reached the hall, she found Zoe standing midway its length, with the two bloodhounds crouched at her feet. She had just called them off the bailiff, who was now standing just within the door, his hat in his hand.  Without deigning to notice him, Ger- trude walked straight up to the standing rack, and taking her riding-whip down, began to crack it for pastime, just as a lady would open and shut her fan, or a dandy would twiddle his cane for amusement. The bailiff bowed- hemmed loudly twice or thrice to attract, her attention, but Gertrude went on flinging out the lash of her whip and bringing it up with a loud report, while her fine, transparent nostrils expanded and quivered with spirit. "Begyour pardon, mum   I but you are Miss Lion, I presume?" "Sir, you are very presuming 1" exclaimed Gertrude, with startling, supercilious surprise, and glancing at the intruder from head to foot.' Apparently used to rebuffs,:the bailiff proceed-.- ed, without embarrassment, to say--   "You harbor a girl here who goes by the name of Zoe." "I harbor a fellow here whose name I do not know." "Excuse me, mum I My name is Jones." "And a very pretty name it is, too-isn't it Zoe!" "Ah, Zoe I That is the girl, is it? Well, Miss Lion, I have an attachment for this girl." "Indeed, have you, sir 8 Really, how con- descending on your part! how flattering to herl Do you hear, Zoe?  This .gentleman declares that he has an attachment for you. What do you say to it, Zoe? Can you bid him hope? He is a nice-looking young man enough-a trilt/e-andy-legged and club-footed; a trifle round-shouldered, and a wee-bit cross- eyed; not fair to look upon in particular, and rather hard-favored in general; still, no doubt, he has an excellent heart-at least his attach- ment does him credit! What do you say to him, Zoe?"Unable to comprehend this scene, Zoe gazed from one to the other, in distressing embarrassment. "You see, Mr. Jones, Zoe and myself properly appreciate the honor you have done us, while we gratefully decline your at- tachnment. I am afraid, indeed, that in Zoe's case there is a prior attachment; we, there- fore, decline yours, with many thanks, and with a high appreciation of its value. We think it does honor to your intellect and affec- tions!" said Gertrude, with scathing irony. The bailiff was confused. Making an effort to re- cover himself, he said- "Miss Lion, you cannot affect to misunder- stand that I come at the suit of Cassinoe & Co., clothiers, Peakville." "Oh-h-h sure enough; he don't speak for himself. Modest soul!  He presses another man's suit; he is not courting on his own hook. He is not Cupid himself-only Cupid's -mes- senger I It's a merchant-tailor that has fallen in love with you, Zoe!" "Miss Lion, I say that I have an attachment for this girl." "Oh, you have. Just now it was Cassinoe & Co.-now it's you! Poor fellow, love has turned his brain; he doesn't know what he is talking about. Presently, he won't know which end he is standing on." "Miss Lion, I repeat it, I have an attach- ment for this girl, and shall proceed to serve it." "I think you won't, sir. To say nothing of my brother's prior attachment, I have an attach- ment for this girl- that will be likely to stand ' in your way."    "Miss Lion, I attach Zoe Wood as the prop- erty of Miss Susan Somerville, and at the suit of Cassinoe & Co., clothiers, Peakville--" "Oh, you do. Well, I attach Zoe Dove as the betrothed of my brother, at the suit of Brutus Lion, lover and avenger I and we'll see whose attachment is the stronger!" exclaimed Gertrude, her bosom visibly heaving-her nos- trils quivering. The bailiff walked up to Zoe, and touched her on the; shoulder. "HANDS OFF!" shouted Gertrude, bringing the loaded end of her riding-whip down upon the floor with the force of a hammer on the anvil, the walls resounding with the report. The bailiff involuntarily started back. "Come here, Zoe," said Gertrude, holding out her arms for the child. .The poor girl- the victim of a vague terror-fled to her pro- tector. Gertrude, with flashing eyes, raised the end of her whip, menacing the bailiff, while she encircled the waist of Zoe by one arm, and laid the head of Zoe gently on her own broad, soft bosom. "There, there, there, there, don't be terrified, Zoe; nothing shall hurt you, Zoe. I'll horse- whip the fellow within an inch of his life, if he does but lay his hand on you again, so I will." "Miss Lion, are you aware that you are transgressing the law?" "Mr. Bailiff, I don't care a fox's brush for any law but the ten commandments." "Do you know that in harboring a slave you expose yourself to--" "Mr. Jones, your way home lies straight out behind you. I give you two minutes' grace; and if at the end of that time you are not out of this hal, I'll put you out!" exclaimed Ger- trude, her bosom heaving like the ocean waves in a tempest, her lips quivering, her nostrils distended, her eyes flashing, sparkling, and scintillating, as though they would explode. "Miss Lion, do you know, are you aware, that you are threatening an, officer of the law." "Ha, ha, ha, ha!-ha, ha, ha! Yes, and if an ' officer of the law' don't take himself out of my sight in double quick time, I'll take an' officer of the law' by the nape of his neck and the straps of his pantaloons, and throw an 'officer of the law' over the precipice. You know me, sir I I am Gertrude Lion!" "I know, and the county knows, Miss Lion, that you are one who sets at defiance all the ' laws of delicacy proper to ypur sex." "Hear the fellow, Zoe. Am't you ashamed of being a woman, Zoe, :when every I critter' who sticks his spindle-shanks into a pair of   ragged pants, thinks himself invested with the robes of a judge, and entitled to pronounce upon what is delicate and proper for the sex. Whew I what a famous thing it must be to be a man. One might be a great empress, a great actress, a great poetess. But, what's all that to being a little ' man I' But this par paren- thesis.  I waste time.  Come I  Your two minutes are up, sir I To the right about I for- ward I march!" commanded Gertrude. Deep thunder seemed to reverberate around the feet of the Amazon. It was the low growls of her two bloodhounds, that crouched on either side of their mistress. They lay with their forepaws extended, their large heads laid upon them, their great red eyes glowing like balls of fire. They heard the altercation, and instinctively longed to spring at the throat of the intruder. Gertrude looked down, and no- ticed them for the first time. She smiled, laughed, crowed, shouted with delight as she looked at them. Then turning to the bailiff, she said--"See here, Mr. ' Officer of the law,' I am going to count ten--just ten-and please the patient Lord I if you don't get out of here before I get to ten, it will go very badly with you; for, as soon as I get to ten, I shall say, 'Seize him, Thunder I Seize him, Lightning I'" Before she had said another word, mistaking her threat for a command, the bloodhounds made a spring at the bailiff, who turned and fled, they pursuing him, they gaining on him down the hill. "Good Heaven I he'll be torn topieces!" ex- claimed Zoe, in terror, while Gertrude fled out to recall the dogs. In ten minutes she returned, followed by them. "And now," she said, "my dear Zoe, you must be put in a place of safety. I can't whip six men, and there is no doubt that six or eight will return here this afternoon. I did not believe it-I mean the worst of it. No, I did not dream it could be true, else I would have had   you safe from  this fright before this time 1" "But, dear Gertrude, what is it, then? Can they take me up for father's debts?" "My dear Zoe, my dear little one, it is all a I mistake. Have confidence in me, and rest ( easy until Brutus returns, and then all will be i well. Zoe, promise to obey me in all things ( until Brutus comes, will you t" ' "But my father "I "My dear- Zoe, the hand of extreme age has n fallen on your father's head, calming his brain a to infantile repose. Do not disturb him, and e he will not interfere with you."      a f    e  "Well, I will promise you, Gertrude"  "Then, Zoe, go now, and make yourself up  a little bundle of provisions, to last one day. 'Pack up a pillow and a sheet into as small a t compass as possible; then put on your bonnet, t and come down here, while I go and catch * Borealis!" Greatly wondering, Zoe went and did the - bidding of her protectress. By the time she had returned to the hall, Gertrude had saddled 1Borealis, and donned her own riding cap. i Mounting her horse, and taking Zoe before her, she cantered down the precipice, through the valley, up the ridge of rocks to Mad River passage, and took the path down the same frightful gorge that had witnessed the wreck of the carriage. "Where are you taking me, Gertrude!" "My dear child, to a place of safety. Don't ask any more questions-wait till "Brutus comes home-have faith in me--I am the most 'disinterested friend you have in the world, ex- cept your poor old father, who cannot help you." Zoe asked no more questions until they got to the grotto. Gertrude put her down, dis- mounted herself, and led her into the cavern. "You are not a coward, Zoe F" "Oh, no." "Not afraid to stay by yourself all night!" "Oh, no. I have been used to it all my life, when father would stay away all night with Major Somerville." "Well, this is a safer place, under all cir- cumstances, than the Dovecote. It is safe, be- cause it is inaccessible-that is, to every body but me. Zoe, my child, you must stay here for a few days. I will bring you clothes, food, fruit, and books and pictures, and every thing to amuse your solitude; and I will come two or three times to see you. And you need not confine yourself to this cavern, but can wander at will through all this glen, for it is perfectly safe and inaccessible." "Thank you, dear Gertrude. But if you will bring me up my needle, and thimble, and scissors, and my little work-basket, with the hexagon quilt, I shall not be lonesome. And, Gertrude, don't forget to feed my Bantam hens with Indian-meal dough-and be sure you don't forget to tuck father up warm when he goes to bed." "I will remember every thing, Zoe. And now-I must return to my poor patient, who is alone, you know. I will,return again .this evening.  Good-by, Zoe l" she said; stooping and kissing her.   "Good-by, Gertrude 1" "God ble'ss you, child t" ("And you too, Gertrude t" And the friends parted. The bailiff returned to Peaksville, breathing vengeance against the audacious Amazon. He would have a writ out against her. He would have her arrested, he swore in his wrath. Somewhat cooled and exhausted by his long walk back, however, and upon cooler reflec- tion, he decided not to take any further notice of the matter, feeling very doubtful of its final issue, and having a shrewd suspicion that he would not figure to much advantage in the business-added to which was the knowledge that Brutus Lion was not a man to be en- raged with impunity, he contented himself with the design of returning the next day to The Lair, with a posse comitatas, to take the girl. On the next day, as Gertrude was waiting on her patient, the sound of many feet was heard in the hall below, accompanied by the furious barking and yelping of dogs, and rat- tling of blows. "It is a descent, or rather an ascent, of the Goths and Vandals," exclaimed Gertrude, laughing; " however, I am ready for them," and she marched below. The hall was half full of men. The two dogs were kept at bay. "Ha, ha l--ha, ha, ha I Really, gentlemen, there is strength in numbers," shouted Ger- trude, as she bounced into the midst of the room, flung her torrent of hair behind her, and let fly her blazing eyes over the circle. "Ha, hal--ha, ha, ha I Try to keep each other in heart-do now; for I do not know what I should do with seven fainting men. Oh, don't be alarmed; I won't tread on you. I am always careful when I walk among ants. See, there are seven of you 1 Seven men come to take one little girl out of the arms of one big girl I Lord-'a-mercy! dear me, what he- roism  Seven of you. You remind me of the Seven Champions of Christendom. You're an honor to your native country. Seven of youl seven heroesl  Lord, if Brutus had been home, you'd have come seven hundred. Seven hundred heroes   What a gallant army 1" "Miss Lion," said the deputy sheriff, ad- vancing from the group, "we have come to search the house for a girl by the name of Zoe, and, withyour leave, we will proceed." "Aid pray, sir; who are you 8" Her Scornful eyes crawled over him from head to foot.   "I am the .deputy sheriff of -- county." "Oh I Mister Deputy Sheriff of -- county, I am so proud to make your acquaintance l Mister Deputy Sheriff of-- county, I am a hero-worshipper; and I have, this morning, for the first time, heard of your heroic exploits at The Crags. How, with a posse at your back, you courageously made an onslaught upon three feeble women and a weak old man--how manfully you terrified the two women to death, and how valiantly you in single combat knocked the aged man down! how you bound and carried him off in triumph-in company with his wife. Oh-h! wonderful Mister Deputy Sheriff of -- county, my poor house is im- mortalized by your visitl The ground you tread is classic ground!" declaimed Gertrude, waving her hand theatrically. Every one laughed.  The brow  of the deputy sheriff crimsoned. "Miss Lion, your pride and scorn are not to interrupt me in the discharge of my duty. I proceed to its execution. Gentlemen, follow me." "Mister Deputy Sheriff, I do you homage!" exclaimed Gertrude, grounding her riding- whip, and bending her head in mockery. A peal of laughter broke from the crowd. The deputy sheriff rushed out in a rage. Gertrude sprang to her feet, shouting with laughter. The search was made-:unsuccessfully, of course; and, at the end of the circuit of the house, the whole party returned to the hall, where Gertrude again mercilessly opened upon them her battery of sarcasm. Just as they were preparing to depart,. horse's feet were heard rapidly approaching, and Brutus Lion was seen to throw himself from his saddle and stride into the room. "What's all this? what the devil is all this, Gertrude?" he exclaimed, looking around him in astonishment and anger. "Oh it is Mister Deputy Sheriff and his myrmidons come to take Zoe. It takes seven of them to do it, you see I and they have not succeeded." "Where is Zoe?" exclaimed the giant, trem- bling in his Hessian boots. "Ah I that's what Mr. Deputy Sheriff would be glad to find out" "Then they have not arrested her." "Arrested her 1 Pooh I am I not her keep- er 8 Had Saisa Somerville been me, Mister Deputy Sheriff would not have marched off withbflying colors from The Crags." "Then Zoe is safe, Gertrude!"   "Ies  Zoe is safe." "Thank God!" "Now, Brutus, don't turn a Miss Molly on my hands. S'pose she hadn't been safe. S'pose she'd been in danger. Could not you have rescued her?" "Gertrude, my dear sister," said Brutus, without noticing her speech, but taking a pack- et from his pocket, " here, take this letter up to your patient-it is from some of his friends in England-and tell him I will wait on him in the course of the evening." Gertrude took the letter and ran up stairs. "Now, Mr. Power, I will speak with you alone, if you please!" said Brutus, beckoning the deputy sheriff into another room. "At whose suit have you attached this girl?" "At the suit of Cassinoe & Co., clothiers, Peakville." "How much is the debt F" "One hundred and seventy-five dollars." "I assume it. Come with me to PeakvilIe, where the business can be legally arranged!" and, without another word, Brutus Lion, re- mounted his horse, and rode rapidly to Peak- ville, followed by the posse, most of whom had come to The Lair rather from curiosity than necessity. In -an hour, Brutus Lion had arranged. the transfer of the liabilities, and again mounting his horse he galloped furiously towards The Crags; saying- "' Now to purchase the freedom of this poor girl, before another writ of attachment at the . suit of some other creditor is served upon her." He reached The Crags, threw himself from his horse, and entered the sitting-room. What a scene of misery met his eyes. A corpse was laid out on tressels in thq:. midst of the room. It was covered by a snow-white sheet, that, clinging closely to the body, re- vealed its deathly rigidity. By its side sat one solitary mourner, clothed in black, her arms extended over the body, her head fallen upon her arms, in an attitude, and expression of hopeless grief. L Brutus approached reverently-  ":Miss Somerville." a The mourner did not seem to hear. "My dear Miss Somerville." "Oh!" moaned Susan, without moving. 4 ( "My dear' Miss Somerville, I am grieved, 1 deeply grieved, to see you sorrowing thus," E The mourner raised her head, revealing a face frightfully ravaged by grief .    1 "Look there I oh, look there She is dead -dead  They said it was disease of the I 9   heart Henlargement of the heart. They were right. Oh, yes I they were. right. Her heart filled and filled with sorrow, till it could hold no more, and then her strong heart broke-it broke  Annal  Anna!" and, with convulsive but tearless sobs, down went her arms again upon the form of the (ead. Tears filled the eyes of Brutus Lion. At any other time, and under any other circum- stances, he would have left the mourner alone with her dead; but now, for the sake of the living, he was forced to intrude upon this; sacred sorrow. In order to shorten the business as lmuch as possible, Brutus, before leaving Peakville, had taken the precaution 'to get a bill of sale drawn up, ready for sig- nature, and to draw his money from the bankers; so that what he-now had to do was very simple-to make Miss Somerville under- stand that Zoe was her property, to gain her consent to the sale, and her signature to the deed. Again he reverently addressed the mourner- "My dear Miss Somerville, I am very, very sorry for the cruel necessity that compels me to intrude on your sacred grief, but the wel- fare of a fellow-creature depends upon my gaining your attention. Can you give it to me for a few, a very few minutes!" Moans only answered him. Brutus laid his hand upon her hand, to at- tract her attention, as he said with deep earn- estness- "Miss Somerville, listen to me t The vital interest of Zoe Dove hangs upon this hour'lI The happiness of her whole life depends upon, my gaining your attention for a few minutes. Will you hear me     '  And, taking her hand, he led her unresist- ing to the seat at the window. Then, sitting down by her, he told her the  whole story of Zoe, as the reader knows it. He told her in a very few words. Susan heard it with all the apathy of deep sorrow. She expressed no surprise; she felt none. Her deep grief shut out every other emotion.. Brutus now proposed to purchase Zoe. He had to repeat this proposition several times before Susan, preoccupied by her sorrows, gpuld be. made to understand and- receive it. Then, speaking slowly and brokenly, like one trying- to break the-spell of an over-mastering thought, she said-' "But if she is mine, as you say, I will free her at once."  "But, my dear Miss Soqpervilie, that wh not do. To .emancipate her would::reuvir - ' i                ,  ' - .   time and trouble. In the mean while, another writ of attachment, at the suit of some other creditor, would be served on her, and your benevolent designs defeated. What I propose is the only safe way. It is very easy. Here is the deed. TYou have only to write your name at the bottom, and she is mine-she is safe. Come, Miss Somerville, do it," pleaded Brutus, putting the pen in her listless fingers, and laying the deed before her. "Well, well; as you think best." And, scarcely conscious of what she did, Susan Somerville wrote her name at the bot- tom of the bill of sale, and Zoe became the property of Brutus Lion. Susan Somerville. tottered back to her seat by the corpse, threw hler arms across the body, dropped her head on them as before, in the abandonment of profound sorrow. Brutus-Lion sprang into his saddle and gal- loped towards The Lair. That eyening, Gertrude hastened to the grotto, and brought back Zoe in triumph to The Lair. That night, Brutus, Gertrude, and Zoe, were grouped around the kitchen fire- "Now, then, dear Gertrude, remember your promise, that as soon as Brutus should return you would explain this mistake." Gertrude looked at Brutus; and Brutus, taking the hand of Zoe in his own, began--and slowly, cautiously, tenderly, revealed to her the secret of her birth, and her present condi- tion. The shadows of the fire-light danced so fitfully upon her face that he could not see its expression while he spoke. He told her all -all. . At the conclusion of his story, Zoe remained silent, with 'her hands clasped upon her lap, with her head bowed upon her bosom. At last broke from her lips in passionate grief these words "Ohl my parentsal my parents I what mis- ery this deception has made I Oh I that I had never been born 1 My heart is breaking, break- ing. Let me die; let me die now. I never -shall look up again; never; no, neverl" and, overcome by grief and shame, she sank upon the floor and rolled upon her face. Gertrude and Brutus made a simultaneous spring to lift her. Brutus caught her to his :bosom, laid her head against his chest, laid her arm up over his shoulder, and soothed 'her. This kindness touched the fountain of 'her tears, and she wept, long and freely. This 'Weeping relieved her, as weeping always does. jHer grief expended'itself as a rain-cloud in,   showers. It is only quiet grief that kills, as ni the case of Anna. "Reaction equals action." At, last, Zoe looked up clearly through her tears, and said- "At least it is you who have bought me; is it not, Brutus? Come, it is not so bad as it might have been. There is. comfort in all things, and at least I am to live with you always, dear Brutus. And I am to cook you nice dishes that you like, and to mend your clothes, and to make your house comfortable, and to make you happy in many ways. In- deed, it is not so bad, after all. It, is not bad at all. After all, it is nothing but the name; only it came on me like a shock; and I was a little proud; that's all. I shall not be sad. People will say that the schoolmaster's adopted daughter, who used to be so proud of her house- keeping, is a slave. Well; I shall not hear them .say it. I shall be here with Brutus; waiting on Brutus; and I shall be happy. Don't grieve for me, Brutus; indeed, I am not unhappy. Do you think that Zoe considers it such a misfortune to belong to Brutus? Nao, indeed. Come I don't weep, Brutus  dear Brutus I I hate to see tears in manly eyes;"' and she raised her apron and wiped away the tears from the eyes of her- great big lubberly nurse, who was quivering with emotion like a mammoth blanc mange. "Zoe, my child!" he said, "did you think I would hold you bound a moment longer than I could help? Zoe, you should have been free to-day, but that the court-house was closed before I had even completed the purchase. Zoe, you shall be free to-morrow; and then you must return with your adopted father to the Dovecote." "Must I leave you, Brutus?" "Zoe, my dear child, yes. You cannot be my wife, Zoe--and I will not make you my mistress; and loving you as I do, Zpe--loving me as you do-that would be your fate if you lived with me, dear child. Take her, Gertrude ;" and pressing one passionate kiss upon her lips, he tossed her in his sister's arms, and bounded from the room, bounced into his chamber, where the great big fellow might have been seen extended on his bed, sobbing, .blowing, and floundering like a harpooned whale.

Gilman. IT was autumn before the Stqart-Gordons returned to The Isle of Rays. It was'impos- sible to tell which were the prouder-General Stuart-Gordon of his brilliant young bride, or Britannia of her grand old husband. She gio- ried in him; there is no error upon this sub- ject-it is the truth. And he delighted in her; brightening and gladdening in her presence-- that is another truth. And The Isle of Rays itself flashed, sparkled, and scintillated more splendidly than ever, when illuminated by the presence of Britannia. As for Louise, youw know she was a ninny, and as for Louis, he was a pale 'facei the Island Palace was quite thrown away upon them. They might wander among the groves and arbors, with music and poetry, and  such nonsense, all day, but the halls and saloons of the Island Palace were alone fitted for our grand  General Stuart- i Gordon   and our brilliant Britannia. Mrs. i Armstrong might say as she pleased, but her downy-hearted little Louise never could have 1 "done" the Island  Palace.  For my part, I i think each pair was well bestowed, and I syms - pathize with Brighty and the General-don't i you?  Mrs. General Stuart-Gordon came home in state, and astonished the neighborhood with N many. innovations. A  new and splendid car- r riage was set up-five   Arabian. horses pur- chased-servants put in livery--three white 9 domestics engaged, namely, a Parisian girl as X lady's maid, an English matron as house- n keeper, and a  French cook.,      V What was the harm of it   . It was not ex- u travagance.- General Stuart-Gordon could si well afford twice the expenditure. It made every body happy, (except Mrs. Aimstrong) ,e) 'it gave people employment, and circulatd bd idle money.  As   for the darkies, they were t3   delighted with their' new liveries as ever raw recruits with new uniform or aby boys with their first breeches.  ,  The day succeeding the arrival, the two la- dies were seated together in, the luxurious ,n boudoir of Britannia. "In truth, my dear Louise, you could have t' done nothing with: this establishment without me. You would never have thought of any improvements. Youwould have received no d suggestions from the gentlemen of the family. Men are apathetic in domestic matters-never n' think of refining their own comforts, while vy yet they keenly relish these comforts when quietly falling in their daily life., I admire r keen and delicate senses, as an evidence of perfect physical development; but I do not like to see a lofty mind always debased in , the service of these senses. I would not have - the General thinking always of his dinner, his I lounge, and his chibouque, though it gives me rpleasure to see that he enjoys them, when, in the slipping off of the hours, they properly succeed physical or intellectual exertion." Louise was pale, dispirited, disinclined to converse at all, still less to cavil at any thing Britannia might say or do. You!are so pehsive, Louise-and you al- ways are, even by the side of Louis. By .the Away, where is the young   gentleman this( morning a" "Gone over to The Crags to see Miss Som- erville. He seemed very anxious to meet her, and so he left me immediately after breakfast." "I wish he would not go there," said Britan- nia; then, immediately repenting her hasty speech, she paused abruptly. Louise looked at her with a slightly quer- ulous expression upon her pretty features, and asked-- "Why, Britannia -why do you wish Louis would not go there!" "My love, it is time to dress; some one will be calling here to-day; ring for Fleu. rine."              '. "But, Brighty, why do   you wish Louis' would not call at The Crags!" persiated Lou- ise, glancing keenly, but furtively, at Britan- nia' face. Mrs. Stuart Gordon turned her ieyes full upon the face of-Louise, and, iookiig at her steadily, replied, slowly al  gravely- -  Because Susan SomevilUleis a gArie"'-itrici - -en  woman, andy the isoiiitef a ga:tf 'u ,  bridegroom, may be oaw  xeeil. aUn fAui- ^ Qv '  *' -'        ho r., ;; -  -;" . ' , . . &. vT  -    Louise dropped her eyes beneath the steady rebuking gaze, and sighed. "Now, Mrs. Louis, will you please to dress for dinner?" "Oh, Britannia, I will dress; but I want to see my mother 8o much." "The carriage is at youi command, Mrs. Louis" "Oh, Britannia, I cannot go alone. The General might not -like it-Louis might not-" "I hope there is not a negro on this planta- tion as great a slave as you are, Mrs.' Louis. Why should they dislike it? Why should they stop you if they did I You pay a poor compliment to General and Mr. Stuart-Gor- don. If they disliked any: act of yours, Lou- ise, believe me, neither would think of impo- sing a single restraint upon your actions; and, indeed, I should very much dislike to see them make the attempt. Poor little thing, you have been confined and fettered so long, that you have lost the use of yourself. You ARE FREE. Can I not electrify you with the fact into some life I Pray use your freedom a little, Ring and order your carriage at your own house; and go-try it, to see how it will feel.

"How do you do, Miss Lion I I am pleased to receive you." "Dear Gertrude, what a surprise I We did not hear you come up." "How could you hear me run up on those soft woolly carpets Lord, I wouldn't live in this house for two General Stuart-Gordons. I couldn't make noise here; if one shouted, the sound would be smothered in satin and down. What a place 1" "Sit down, Gertrude." "Can't.' Don't like the looks of the house; besides, I was just going over to The Crags to see poor, dear Susan, and I thought I would: not pass you. I thoight I would just run up, and see you, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon." ' "You put quite a surprise upon us," said Britannia. ",A shock, why don't you say t I 'spose I ought to have rung. Lord, I never had pa-   ".^ *"VV  v s - , J       ., tience to wait until a servant came to open the door, and a lady came down. I never indulged Mrs. Armstrong-even her High-loftiness-in such notions. Oh, have you seen your mother, Louise?"  ' , "Oh, no, dear Gertrude; I have not even heard from her for four months. Just think of that. How is she, Gertrude  Can you tell me?" "Mrs. Armstrong keeps very close house -sees no one but the minister and the doc- tor--" "The   doctorl Is my mother in bad health?" "Well, no; I do not think so; but, having nothing else to amuse herself with, she thinks of nothing but herself-her own body, and her own soul-which is the reason, I suppose." "Oh, Brighty, you hear. - My mother in bad health." "I do not believe it," said Mrs. Stuart- Gordon. '"Well, good-by, good-by! I must go, I must go. I should smother in sweets here. "' Some love to roam o'er the wide sea foam, Where the shrill winds whistle free, But a chosen band in a mountain land, And a home in the woods for me!' And singing and shouting, she ran and bound- ed down the stairs and out of the house. "Oh, Brighty, do you mark that?   My mother in bad health." "I do not believe so, Louise. Her minister and physician visit to amuse her, while they eat hefr dinners." "Oh, Brighty, this family estrangement is killing to me; it is, indeed it is. Four months I have niot heard from my mother. I, her only child, who never left her an hour during sixteen years. Oh, Brighty, go with me to see her." "My dear Louise, I will attend you, if posi- tively necessary, butkmy opinion is that you had better go alone. Xy visit might not be acceptable." : "But, oh I Brighty, do go. Surely you owe that much to my mother." "I sent her our cards yesterday, she there-,  fore knows that we are at home:" "That was a proud thing in you to do, Brighty." "I was dealing with a proud woman" "It would have been more friendly to have driven over to' Mont Crystal this morn. ing:" "Mrs. Armstrong should call here."   "Oh, Britannia, Britannia I do not cherish pride in view of all God's bountiful blessings to you. Go with me to;Mont Crystal. Make the first advance yourself; you are the young- er. This quarrel must be reconciled.  It must-it must. It kills me. Oh; BritanniaI I am not strong; I suffer so much; I eat noth- ing, scarcely; I sleep but little, and I am growing so feeble. I I am sinking under it, Bri- tannia. I shall die. Look how thin I am." And the poor child turned up her muslin sleeves, and held up the two slimmest little white wrists that ever were seen. "Poor little arms! poor, dear little arms!" said Brighty, taking them and kissing them. "Come, sit in my lap, Louise, I want to pet you!" and she held out her arms. Louise dropped into them, sobbing. "Louis loves you so much, my dear. You ought to be happy." "Ahl how can I while this estrangement lasts? Oh I I feel a sense of guilt, of treach- ery even, in the comfort I receive from Louis's affection." "Sweet Providence I was there ever such a perverted head. You have been taught from your earliest infancy up, as religion, to wor- ship your mother, only her, and have been misled in respect to all your other womanly duties. But, poor thing, I will not distress you. I will go with you." And touching the bell, "Send Mrs. Louis's maid to her dressing- room," she said to the servant who obeyed the summons. The man bowed and withdrew. "Now, love, go make your toilet." Britannia proceeded to make hers. In truth, Britannia herself desired the reconciliation of the families. A house divided against itself cannot stand. Britannia knew that the houses of Mont Crystal and of The Isle of Rays were4ll-power- ful united; that, divided,- they parted the in- fluence over the neighborhood. Besides, Britan- nia saw that General Stuart-Gordon, whom she adored, was himself uneasy at this estrange- ment, and she wished: to see him comfortable. In addition to this, Brighty rather admired Mrs. Armistrong in some respects-rather sym- pathized with her pride, and cherished rather pleasant recollections of her late home at Mont Crystal. The reader must have observed one peculiarity of Brighty--namely, the propensity to look on the bright side of every event, ,and the fair side bf every character; thus, though she perceived the darker traits of Mrs. Arm- strong's character, she never dwelt upon them in her heart; and though she had experienced some disagreeable things at Mont Crystal, she   i only brought away with her its pleasant mem- 3 ories. This was no happy system of philosophy with Brighty; it was simply her happy nature. And then Britannia sympathized with Louise's sor-ow, and with Louis, as suffering with Louise. Lastly, Brighty, like her old General, was too , cordial-hearted not to like family-peace and good-fellowship. But as there is a leaven of unrighteousness in most human motives, .so Brighty took a little wicked, womanish pleas- ure in going in state to make a visit of cere- mony at the house from which she had been so summarily discharged five months before. Britannia made a grand toilet. Brighty became a rich and tasteful costume perfectly. Her ap- pearance was decidedly distinguished. There was an air of hgh-bred refinement in the expres- sion of her elegantly-chiselled profile in repose, ' and seen beyond the edge of her white French hat and drooping plumes. Never were satins, velvets, plumes, and cygnet down, better bestowed than upon Britannia. Taking a little card-case of wrought gold in her hand, Brighty descended the stairs, where she was soon joined by Louise. They entered the carriage, and were driven to Mont Crystal. Hopes, fears, and anxie- 'ties in regard to her reception torturing the heart of Louise--a little genial desire, for family amity, a little feminine exultation, agitating the bosom of Brighty, as the carriage crossed the bridge between the island and the- shore, and wound up the hill! bringing them in sight of the splendid front of Mont Crystal The carriage drew up before the massive iron- , bound green gate always kept closed. The porter opened it, and the carriage drove up the broad avenue, flanked on each side by a row of locust-trees, and stopped before the door. A footman alighted from behind, and opened the door. The heart of Louise paused in its beatings-she could scarcely sit-she grew pale. Britannia gave her footman her card-- MRS. GENERAL STUART-GORDON. "Take this to Mrs. Armstrong." The man bowed, and waited to receive that of Mrs. Louis. "Tell mother I'm here, and -dying to see her," faltered the half-fainting Louise. The footman went up the broad 'marble steps, rung, sent in the card. Brighty watched him from the carriage. She smiled to herself, her cheeks flushed, yer eyesdaneed. "Oh I she will not receive us, I know per- fectly well now," said Brighty. . r.. Brighty was mistaken "gMrs. Armstrong'  complimeat, and she feels gratefil Ofr Mrs,   General Stuart-Gordon's call, and begs that she will alight;  Brighty's heart smote ther for pride, vanity, and injustice, in an instant. "What word did mother send to me-what to me " asked Louise, nervously. The footman bowed--"Nothing more, mad- am." "Oh, Britannia! she is angry with mel why is she angry with me!" "My love, there is some mistake; your mes- sage was not delivered. There is some mistake -alight." They descended from the carriage, ,and walk- ed up the stairs, Louise clinging, half-fainting, to the arm of Britannia; They were shown in- +o the west saloon--tihe crimson drawing-room; and going down its whole length, they seated themselves upon the crimson satin sofa in the recess of the bay window. The eyes of Brighty sparkled as she remembered that just six months before, seated on that very sofa, her eyes had filled with tears at receiving offers of hospitality from two poor girls, who pitied her poverty, and homeless and friendless condition. What a splendid contrast to that was her pres- ent cotdition. For Louise-she thought of the day when she sat upon that sofa a happy bride-happy in the love of her mother and her husband-happy in' the fatherly affection of General Stuart-Gordon, and in the friend- ship of Britannia and her youni companions. Who could have foreseen the blight that fell upon her joy. The door opened, and Mrs. Armstrong sailed in. She always sailed-her stately form, ample robes, and slow gliding step, forcibly suggest- ed the idea of a frigate under full sail. Louise arose to meet her, but growing very weak, she sank again into her seat. Mrs. Armstrong approached, and offering her hand to Britannia. who rose respectfully to receive her, she said- "I am happy to see you, Mrs. Stuart-Gor-. don. Permit me to offer you my best wishes for your happiness in your new position." Britannia courtesied, sat down, and said- "I hope you have been well since I had the pleasure of seeing you last, Mrs. Armstrong." "Quite well, I am much obliged- to you Your appearance saves me the necessity-of in- quiring after your health, and leaves me only the pleasure of congratulating you upon the - subject," Then turning to Louise, she said- "My daughter I'v "My dear mother 1" They embraced-Louise sobbed.   "I cannot say the same for Mrs. Louis-she does not look well," said Mrs. Armstrong, set- , ting down in her easy-chair. "I am sorry to admit that Mrs. Louis does ; not enjoy good health. I have no doubt, how. ever, that meeting with you, madam, will re. store her." Mrs. Armstrong looked at her daughter again, and with more scrutiny, She Was more than ever impressed with the fearful change in Louise's appearance. "Come here, my daughter. Mrs. Stuart- Gordon, will you excuse us? You will find some admirable prints on yonder table. I would have an interview with my daughter." "Oh, certainly, certainly, Mrs. Armstrong. I am no stranger at Mont Crystal." Mrs. Armstrong left the room with her daughter. They went up stairs, into her chamber. "Well, my child, you are looking around upon this room-what emotion does the view awaken in your bosom 8" "Oh, mother I mother!" exclaimed Louise, throwing herself upon the bosom  of her mother. They sat down upon alounge. "You are looking very thin and pale, Louise!" "Oh, motler! I have suffered so much." "Is Louis kind to you?" "Oh, mother! good as Heaven to me."- "And General Stuart-Gordon?" "Pets me like a pet kitten, mamma." "And Mrs. Stuart-Gordon ." "Treats me better than she treats herself. Nurses me as though I were her baby, mamma." "You are very happy, then?" "Oh, no! mamma." "Why not?" "Oh, mamma I this estrangement!" "It is very serious, then, on their part. They speak of me with great aversion." "Oh, no I dearest mamma I there is no member of the family who does 'not deplore it, I am sure; who would not do any thing to heal the breach." "You are .looking very pale, Louise, but perhaps there is' a natural cause for this," said the dowager, taking her hand, and looking in her face. "Ma'am P" Mrs. Armstrong put a question. "Oh, no! mamma no I no 1" replied Louise, blushing like a peony, "No I no; mammas  nothing of the sort I It was the parting with   you, mamma, without taking leave of you. It was the not hearing from you for so long, mamma.. And you are looking haggard, mamma; you have been sick." I I have been sick at heart, Louise." "My dear mother!" "I have been alone, Louise." "Oh! my dear mother, if you knew how glad I should havebeen to have had you with us, or to have been with you." "But, Louise, are you quite sure of what you tell me?" "Oh! very sure, dear mamma. Please don't ask me," pleaded Louise, crimsoning with con- fusion. "We will rejoin Mrs. Stuart-Gordon now. That was all I wished to ascertain," said the dowager, with a diabolical smile, which was happilyqlost upon her daughter. "And, mamma, this misunderstanding shall be reconciled, shall it not F" "Yes, my daughter, as far as it lies in my power." ' Oh! thank you, dear, dear mamma. Now, now I shall be happy again." They went down stairs, and entered the crimson drawing-room. Britannia was stand- ing at the table, looking over some prints. She turned smilingly to meet the mother and daughter. She saw nothing in Mrs. Arm- strong's face, always cold and impassible; but she saw in Louise's radiant eyes that peace was about to be proclaimed. "Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, have you any engage- ment for to-morrow!" "None, madam. Mrs. Louis and myself  are perfectly at your disposal to-morrow." "Then I will waive ceremony, and dine at The Isle of Rays to-morrow.'" Britannia courtesied low, in acknowledgment of this grace. Louise caught her mother's hand and raised it to her lips. "We shall be most happy to receive you, madam," said Britannia. "Oh, mamma I Louis 'and the General will be so overjoyed." Soon after, the ladies took their leave. "A   proud, presuming huzzy," exclaimed Mrs. Armstrong, as the carriage rolled away. "How dare she, after ejecting my daughter from her full position in -that family-how dare she come here, with her carriage and liveried servants, to insult me, and to triumph over me I My ex-governess  1 hate her hate her I She blasts my sight. I wish she were dead. I cannot bring about her death, but-t- I will see if she does not tramp from The Isle    of Rays. I think I have the lever by which to move her. Yes, my lady Britannia, you shall tramp. We want no second brood of children growing up on The Isle f: Rays . The carriage of the Stuart-Gordons returned to The Isle of Rays. The level beams of the setting sun were glancing aslnt the island, as the carriage, recrossing the bridge, wound on between rows of cool shade-trees around the circular road that led up to the front en- trance of the Island Palace. The whole front of crystal windows flashed back in streams of dazzling light the very last rays of the. level sun, as the carriage paused before the portals. General Stuart-Gordon was standing, smi-' ling, on the marble steps, waiting to receive his ladies. He advanced to meet them as they alighted- "Welcome home, ladies," he said, gladly, as he opened his arms, and, receiving them b oth in one embrace, pressed them together to his bosom. "You are radiating beauty this even- . ing, my lady Britannia!" he exclaimed, as Brighty, just permitting him to touch her brow with his lips, sprung gayly past him into the house. "And you, also, my little Louise, he added, detaining her in her intended flight "One would say that something highly agree- able had happened to you." "Ohi there has-there has I I have seen mother-dear mother I and it is all made up, and she is coming here to-morrow. Are you not glad?" "You have justseen ' mother,' little dar- ling. Well, then, come and kissfather!" "Oh, I will I will! I will give you the kiss mother left upon my lips at parting. It shall be a peace-offering--a love-offering; take it!" and Louise clasped her arms around his neck, and pressed her lips fervently to his. "You are a sweet' girl, Louise." "But, oh I did you hear me say that mother was coming here to-morrow?" "Yes, love, I did; and she shall have such a welcome as shall make her forget every thing unpleasant that has passed between us; and now, my dear, I must go and thank Brighty for having taken you to Mont Crystal so soon." "Has Louis returned!" "No, darling, not yet. Now run and get '- ready for dinner, or we shall have to Ldine by candle-light. Yea, we positively shall hve to do that, any how"     -  -  Mdiise hurried off to her room Upon her ,r *   o   pw h *   dressing-table she found a note from Louis. Opening it hastily, she read:-- "DEAREST-Sudden  and urgent business calls me to Peakville. I shall not be able to return to-night.          L" A momentary shade of vexation passed, as a light cloud, over the visage of Louise, -and van- ished. Louise was too happy to be annoyed by trifles. The family met at dinner. Louise explained, as far as the note did, the absence of Louis, and General Stuart-Gordon surmised that this business was in connection with the execution at Major Somerville's, and then he proceeded to give the account of it that he had, heard in the course of the day. Early the next morning, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon summoned her housekeeper, and gave her or- ders for the dinner. Little Louise was almost as happy as it was possible to be; and General Stuart-Gordon walked about leisurely and smilingly- "( And in the fullness of joy and hope Seemed washing his hands with invisible soap, In imperceptible water." Nothing was wanting to complete his hap- piness but this family reconciliation, and now it was about to come off. When three o'clock struck, he mounted his horse, and, attended by Apollo on a second, rode down to the bridge, to wait for and welcome Mrs. Armstrong there. He waited on the bridge, amusing himself by looking at the reflection of the green banks and graceful trees in the clear water, or in look- ing towards Mont Crystal for the appearance of the carriage. At last it came in sight, and wound slowly down the bill. General Stuart- Gordon rode forward, and, while Apollo held open the wide gate to admit the carriage when it had crossed the bridge, the General advanced to the carriage door, and, bowing to his very stirrup, said, earnestly-- "Mrs. Armstrong, I am most happy to see you. Permit me to attend you to the house, sWhere the ladies await your coming with much impatience." ; "I thank you, sir, and welcome you back to our neighborhood." Not one allusion, even by apology, was made to the past. The only difference was an elabo- rate deference of manner on the part of Gen- - eral Stuart-Gordon, and a stately graciousness on the side of the lady. Sending his servant on to the house to announce madam's arrival on The Isle of Rays, the courtly General himself rode at the lady's carriage side, opening the   gates, pulling aside the boughs that crossed the road, &c. When the carriage drew up before the mansion, and Mrs. Armstrong prepared to alight, the General threw himself from his horse, opened the carriage-door, put down the steps, and, after assisting the lady to descend, drew her arm within his own, and led her up the stairs to the piazza, from whence Britannia and Louise advanced to receive her. Then, to show her the highest possible respect, instead of ringing for a servant, Britannia conducted Mrs. Armstrong..to a dressing-room herself, per- formed the part offemme de chambre, by assist- ing the lady to lay off her bonnet, shawls, tippets, &c. Louise was there also, with sal volatile, cologne, and a class of wine, in case her mother were fatigued. The whole family strove, by showing Mrs. Armstrong the highest honor, to testify their appreciation of her visit. Britannia, entirely disarmed by Mrs. Armstrong's seeming kind- ness, and reproaching herself for the pride and vanity of her display on the day before, put off all state, sunk for the time the "Mrs. Gen- eral Stuart-Gordon," became "Brighty," and gave her personal attendance to Mrs. Arm- strong with a deference she had never shown in her governessing days. As for General Stuart-Gordon, he was so enchanted with Brigh- ty's goodness as to fall freshy in love with her that day, and kissed her every time he got a chance. If Mrs. Armstrong's seeming kindness had worked such miracles of reform, and created such happiness, what cannot real kindness do a Try its effect, reader, upon your worst enemy. But Louis had not come home. Where was Louis? It was four o'clock, and the family were all in the drawing-room, and dinner was about to be served without Louis. Louise was not an exacting little wife. Her affection for Louis was too moderate and too disinterested for that; but she was getting a little impatient for his arrival--would have felt a little lost and lonesome but for the presence of her mother. They dined without him. At last, late in the evening, Louis Stuart- Gordon arrived in haste, weary, haggard, dusty, and travel-stained. Without presenting him- * self in that condition in the drawing-room, he, hurried at once to his own apartment, and sent for Louise. She hastened to him. "My dearest Louise," he said, coming for- ward and embracing her, "how happy I am to meet you again after a day's absence." "So am I glad to see you, Louis-and, oh! Louis, moQther has come"    "I saw her carriage. I shall be very happy to see her." "Now, dearest Louis-or rather, I mean Louis, you naughty truant, you!-what kept you away so long "  "Ah, Louise I a sad, sad business. Perhaps you heard of the execution at Major Somer- ville's 8" "Yes! yes-well?" "Well, it appears that Susan wrote to my father for assistance, and we never got the letter." "Oh I what a pity." "And, of course, knowing nothing about the execution, did nothing to, arrest its ill effects, and, in one word, Louisej when I called on Miss Somerville this morning, I found her / alone, plunged in grief at the expected sale of her foster-parents, George and Harriet, who were then supposed to be in the slave-pen at Peakville. The sale was to have come off to- day. I hurried to Peakville at once, but arrived too late. A slave-trader from Alexandria had already purchased them, and had set out for that town this very morning. So, my own Louise, I went back to Miss Somerville with this news. She was so much distressed, and I sympathized with her so keenly, that I have determined to set out for Alexandria to-morrow morning, hoping to reach. that city before the poor couple are shipped to the South." "And so you will leave me again so soon, Louis!" "Would you have me hesitate as moment, Louise!" "Oh, no I Poor Susan I But how long will you be gone, Louis?" "A week, perhaps, my dear." "Oh, dear me, a week  It is so lonesome here without you, Louis." During this little talk, Louis Stuart-Gordon had been changing his dress. His toilet be- ing now complete, they went down stairs into the drawing-room. Louis Stuart-Gordon ad- vanced to Mrs. Armstrong and welcomed her with an easy grace, raising her hand respect- fully to his lips with an affectionate gallantry, as if nothing had happened. Then turning, he explained to his father the nature of the busi- ness that had detained him from  home, at the same time announcing his intention of leaving for Alexandria the next morning. "In that case, my dear son-in-law," said Mrs. Armstrong," I shall invite your wife to pass the days of your absence at Mont Crystal. Do you consent to this, Louis 8" "With great pleasure, my dear. madam, if   r Louise will be pleased, as of course she will, to avail herself of your kind invitation.", ,  "What do you say, my daughter!" "Oh, I shall be too happy." Mrs. Armstrong remained all night at The s Isle of Rays. After breakfast, the next mornm-  ing, Louis departed for Alexandria, and Louise returned to Mont Crystal with her mother, there to spend the week of her husband's absence. CHAPTER X. A CHAMBER SCENE. A light, commodious chamber Looking out to the hills where the shine Of the great sun may enter. ,   .'! .Mary Howitt. THE second day from the arrival of Louise at Mont Crystal saw the carriage of Mrs. Arm- strong drawn up before the Island mansion. General Stuart-Gordon advanced from    the house, and came down the steps to assist the lady to alight. "I am overjoyed to see you again so soon, my dear madam, and my little daughter-in-law whom we have missed so much. She is within there, of course, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon will be. delighted to see her-" "My daughter has not accompanied me, sir. I came only upon a matter of business, to which I crave your attention for a few mo- ments, sir."? "Certainly, madam," said the General, offer- ing his arm to the, lady, with certain vague misgivings. "Certainly, madam. Apollo, lead the way into the library, and then let your. mistressknow that Mrs. Armstrong is:here." "Sir, excuse me. I shall, not present my- self to your ladythis morning." "Can we not persuade you to spend the day with us, madam?" said the General, in his blandest tones. "Once more, sir I business alone brought me to The Isle of Rays," replied the lady in a freezing tone. Again vague but gloomy pre, sentinewnts darkened the mind of the General, as he led Mrs. Armstrong into-the library and handed her a chair. She seated herself with cold dignity. General Stuart-Gordon followed her example, and remained waiting for the lady to speak. "Be so good as to send your man from th6e room," said Mrs. Armstrong. "Go, Apollo," commanded the General; and Apollo went.  "Well, madam, how can I serwm;' .   youl" asked General Stuart-Gordon, after wait- ing some minutes for her to begin. "Sir, who is the heir of this Island Estate?" "My only son -Louis, of course." "By what righi' does Louis inherit this property?" 1 "In right of his mother, Margaret Stuart- Gordon." "Then Louis Stuart-Gordon is master of this estate and mansion-house?" "Not as yet, madam!" "Let that pass for the present. But, when I bestowed the hand of my daughter, Miss Armstrong, upon your son, Mr. Stuart-Gordon, it was understood that she should take the head of this establishment. Was this so, or was it not so?" "Certainly, madam, that was the tacit un- derstanding, but--" "Never mind ' but.' This house was refur- nished, fitted up, to suit the taste of Louise, was it not a" "Of course, madam, but--" "Louise was to have been its mistress-was she not?" '"Certainly, madam, but--" "' Who is its mistress?" "My wife, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, senior." "Then the conditions of the marriage con-' tract have not been fulfilled on your part." "The implied conditions, I grant you, ma- dam, have been, so far, infringed. It was rather assumed than stipulated, that Mrs. Louis should take the head of this establish- ment-and at a time, too, when my own mar- riage was not in contemplation." "Sir, I, for one, make no allowances for : after-thoughts." "Mrs. Armstrong, pardon me, but this is really very extraordinary on your part." "General Stuart-Gordon, I am one of very few' words; and, in one word, my business here to-day is to remind you, of the conditions upon which the marriage of Louis Stuart- Gordon with Louise Armstrong was contract- ed, and to request your fulfillment of your part; in short, to ask you to give up posses- sion here to the rightful owners-your son and his wife." "Mrs. Armstrong, had any other than your- self have made so strange a proposition, I should ascribe their words to a disordered in- tellect." "Do I understand you to refuse this, sir $" "Most certainly, madam; your singular proposition is not to be entertained for a sin- gle moment."   "Then hear me, sir. I said that I was a woman of few words; you know that I am not a woman of vain words; and I tell you," she : said, rising, folding her arms, standing before him with her determined jaws firmly set, her determined eyes firmly fixed upon him--"I tell you," she said, slowly, through her closed teeth, " that, until you and your wife evacuate these premises, Mrs. .Louis Stuart-Gordon never -sets foot upon The Isle of Rays, and never exchanges one word with any one mem- ber of the Island family. I waited my time. I have her. She is in my hands now!" and, turning haughtily, she strode from the room, leaving General Stuart-Gordon standing, won- der-struck, in the middle of the floor, standing stock still, and staring straight ahead, until a pair of jewelled hands flashed down upon his breast, and a pair of sparkling eyes glanced up into his.: Britannia was standing before him. "Well what is it? You are all amazed. What is the matter?" "Ruin! ruin! Brighty. Do you see that woman?" he said, drawing Britannia after him to the front window, and pointing to where Mrs. Armstrong's carriage was rolling away. "Do you see that woman?  ' She is the infer- nal Ate in good apparel.' She. has deceived us all; her visit, her pretended reconciliation, was all a ruse, to get Louise into her power again. I would give ten thousand dollars to have Louise once more within the walls of this house. My dear Britannia, if, with your wom- an's wit, you will only conjure Louise back again to this room, ask me for any boon that moment, and it is yours." "Nay, I am no match for Mrs. Armstrong- neither do I understand one word of all this quarrel, from first to last." . . "Then, Brighty, I suppose that, first or last, you must hear it. Mrs. Armstrong had honored me with her preference-was highly infuriated at my marriage-and now that sle has Louise safe under her own thumb, and knowing as she knows her absolute power over Louise; and knowing as she does that Louis is too fastidious to resort to legal measures for the recovery of his wife,d le has avowed her de- termination that Louise shall not set foot within the limits of The Isle of Rays, or hold any intercourse with any member of its family, until we--you and myself-shall have evacu- ated the premises. There! I said so. . Your bright eyes, my dear, are as wide open with astonishment as mine were when you came in and found me." ,    Brighty's eyes were now cast down; she seemed, buried in deep thought for a few minutes, then suddenly breaking the thread of her reverie, she took his hand and said- "Cone  luncheon is served in the oaken 'parlor," and drewr him out. Over that lun- cheon the General and Brighty had a long and confidential conversation. It was yet early in the morning when Mrs. Armstrong returned to Mont Crystal. Louise sat sewing in one of the large front chambers, whose lofty windows command the river, isle, and opposite shore. This was Mrs. Armstrong's summer sleeping-room. Every. summer she migrated from the thickly carpeted and heavily curtained crimson bedroom to this large airy chamber, with its many tall -windows, its white mantelpiece, its straw-matting floor, and its white dimity curtains, counterpanes, and toilet-covers. This was an airy, fragrant chamber, with a, fine prospect from its win- dows. Louise shared this apartment with her mother, and now she sat at one of the front windows, idling with her needle and thread, while her heart went forth gladly into the morning glory of the sunlight. The morning air -had tinged her delicately fair cheek with the faintest rose tint, a little deepened as it budded into the classic lips. Louise had always been pretty, but there was the germ of.-an exquisite beauty in her face, that could only be developed by a happy love. She was still pausing, with her needle in her hand, still looking forth upon the glorious( landscape, when her mother entered from her drive. Airs. Armstrong had already divested herself of her riding-dress, and now taking out her knotting, she sat down near Louise, who took her hand and pressed it reverently to her: lips, still gazing forth upon the river, as though some- thing there fascinated her glance.- "You seem  to like this front window, my daughter 1" "Oh! I do, dearest mother I I like the prospect( from it so much.   Look, mother, look! See The Isle of Rays, shooting streams of light-radiating sunbeams like an archan- gel's crown I Oh, mother! that Isle, 'with its sparkling fountains and flashing waterfalls, seems to me as a glad, glad spirit, rejoicing in its life of light, and for ever and for ever clant- ing its song of joy to its Creator i Oh I I love that Isle! I love it I I almost pray to it, as to some guardian-and when I am there, it seems to me as if the vast and radiant wings of some bright angel enveloped me I and even now its   waters seem to smile at me-its trees to wave their arms to me-it attracts, fascinates me- woos, invites me. Oh, see! it seems to nod and smile at me, mother; and my spirit flut- tors in my bosom, and plumes its wings, as though it would spread them, and, cleaving through all this sun-bright air, seek the bower of the blessed angel Islet--" "Ahem I poetry is very well in its place- that is, in gilt-edged books, bound up between embossed covers, and laid upon pier and centre tables, to while away the hours of idle morning visitors and loungers; but it is very much out of place here. You will please to remember, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, that sentimentality is de- cidedly vulgar. Your manners, since' your res- idence at The Isle of Rays, have deteriorated lamentably. You have lost that air of repose that once distinguished you--" "But, oh, mother I it is so difficult only to pace when one wishes to run-only to smile when one wishes to laugh-to speak low when one wishes to break out in a song. Why may not one be glad and gay in a free mountain scene like this, mother?, Oh, look, mammal the fountains on the Isle flash and play in the sunbeams all day long as they please-and the cataracts leap into the bosom of the river, making glad music through all the sunny hours -and the river flows on in light with its silent hymn of joy; and the forest trees wave. Oh! see how they bend and nod and throw up waves of green light to the skies-their offer- ing of love to the skies, that smile back in love upon them. And the flowers, mother! Oh 1 stoop a moment from the window, and smile at them--if. an open flower expresses any thing on earth, mother, it is an- open smile. And, mo. ther, did you ever notice the rose leaning its cheeks sideways, caressingly, upon the green leaves that cluster tenderly around it? Oh! mother, is there any thing in human nature that expresses beautiful love more beautifully than that? Now, mother, when I look out upon nature, and see nothing but beauty, love, and joy-and when my own heart leaps in my bosom to join the grand diapason of grateful harmony--why must its expression be checked and suppressed? It kills me, mother! it kills me!" "It is Louis who has put all this nonsense into your head. You must never heed poets, my daughter. They are all-to use an express- ive Scotch term--' daft. " "Yes, it was Louis who revealed the life, the soul of nature to me-who translated the language of nature for me. One day we sat on   a bank of violets, and I stooped to pluck one, and his gentle hand dropped softly upon mine, and stayed its purpose. 'Do not pluck it, Louise,' he said, ' but look at it I see how full of expression it is l' And I looked. The violet had nestled itself under the shelter of its green leaves, and it peeped out at us with as much archness of expression in the bend of its head, in the droop of its petals, as ever you saw in the sidelong glance of a sky-bird, with its head bept aside--or the speaking eyes of a wild kitten, backing itself up into a corner. And we both watched the violet, as it seemed to watch us, and we would no more have plucked it than we would have tortured the bird or the kitten. Louis never kills a bird or squirrel, or any thing else, or even pulls a flower. He lets every thing alone--every thing live. Every thing lives to Louis!" "Oh, how childish and puerile, not to say ridiculous, all this is I I see that I shall have a good deal of trouble in reforming and per- fecting your manners, my dear Louise." "No, you will not, my mother," said Louise, whose gayety had been gradually subsiding. "No, you will not, my mother. There is some- thing in the very air of this house that subdues me--its walls have the cold grandeur of the glaciers; they awe and chill me. It is only when looking forth from its windows upon The Isle of Rays, that, remembering my life there, I feel glad and wild." "That is an over-long speech for an epigram, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon." "Dear mother, I did not mean that-excuse me-forgive me. I did not know what I was saying." "Exactly, Louise. When you are not ab- surdly gay, you are ridiculously petulant. Why can you not be serene, like Miss Somer- ville? Then., perhaps, you would stand a bet- ter chance of retaining your hold upon your husband's heart."  "Why, mother-how is that 8 What do you mean " "I mean, my dear child, that you are not i quite so much to the taste of Louis as your friend, Susan Somerville, is."      i "Mother, you distress me-so much," said Louise, her features growing pale and sharp. 1 "'My poor girl-my dear Louise, there is i but one disinterested and ever-enduring love i in the world, and that is the love of a mo- a ther."'  "Well, mother, I know that. You have told me a million of times. I have read it in all s the books you ever put in my hands. I have G   even written it in copy-books. I know that, But still I do think Louis loves me with a ' disinterested and ever-enduring love,' al- though I may not be so worthy of liim as Susan Somerville would have been. We do not always love only what is superior-we sometimes love inferior' beings for their very need of us-so Louis, so Brightyfso the Gen- eral loves me." "Poor child, they none of them love you- they cajole, caress, flatter the heiress of Mont Crystal. No one loves Louise, but her mo- ther--" "Louis, mother, Louis loves me." "How do you know that?" "Oh, by a thousand signs--by every look, word, tone, and gesture-by every loving act of his--by every happy emotion of mine." "Ah! good. Did you ever see a play, Louise?" "Yes, mother, but I am sick at heart. I do not wish to talk about plays or other. indiffer- ent matters. Mother, Louis-" "Nonsense! What was the play you saw, Louise 8" "Romeo and Juliet." "There could not be a better play for the illustration of my subject. I can imagine that this play moved the sympathies of your un- sophisticated heart, Louise. Who played Romeo?" "George Barrett, mother." "A celebrated tragedian, to judge by news- paper criticism. Well, the passion was well counterfeited-was it not?" "Ma'am?"  "The love- the tenderness, the pathos was well played-was it not?" "To the life, mother. It wrung my heart like a real tragedy enacting before me." "Yet you know it was acknowledged act- ing ." "Certainly, mother." "Well, my dear ,Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, there is more acting, and more consummate acting off the stage than on it. The family at The Isle of Rays is a corps of consummate actors, of which Louis Stuart-Gordon may be called the star. They love you not, Louise. There' is not one of them who would not have pre- ferred that Louis had married Miss Somer- ville, had she possessed a fortune equal to yours." "Oh, mother, mother, what makes you think so? Mother, Louis likes me; indeed, Louis does like me."   "Yes, he likes you as the Romeo of the acted drama liked the Juliet, but he loves Susan Somerville." "Oh, motherl I this is not truel You are mistaken; oh, you-must be mistaken; this can- not be true;" and Louise dropped her head upon her hands and sobbed. "Recall, if you please, Louise, the agitation and illness of Miss Somerville at your wed- ding-recollect her precipitate retreat imme- diately after the ceremony--" "Oh, yes I yes 1 I remember that; oh, I rec- ollect many things that then I could not ac- count for, thatlow seem clear enough to me. Yes, I remember now that mafny of the young girls bantered Susan, and said that it had been generally reported that she and Louis were to have been married." "And so it had been generally reported, and Louis had given every color to the re- port by going every afternoon and spending the whole evening at The Crags, and, when- ever her grandfather was absent, sending for Miss Somerville to The Isle of Rays. In a word, both the General and Louis admired and loved Miss Somerville, and Louis would glad- ly have married her, and the General would gladly have consented to the marriage, had the young lady possessed an adequate fortune; and the grievous wrong is, that Louis, after selfishy winning the affections of this girl, has cruelly abandoned her, and married another woman whom he cannot equally love." "Yes, he does love me, mother. But oh, poor Susan I! Ah, yes! it is true,-too true! I feel sure of it when I recall her agitation, her change of color whenever Louis looked at or spoke to her. Then-'her fearful lapse of spirits, her rapid decline of healthand strength in the days that followed my marriage; and I remember that Brighty always sought to ward off observation from her." "Yes! that young lady was in the secret! She was leagued with them, and against -us." "Poor, dear Snsan I But oh, mother! why did you not tell me all this before it was too late?" "Because I have only recently suspected it myself, and, following out my suspicions, have I confirmed them." "Poor Susan! how could Louis have been so thoughtless I for whatever of wrong has been done or suffered, it has been from thoughtless- ness; Louis intended no wrong." "Thoughtlessness I His actions have sprung from else than thoughtlessness; his course has been calculated with mathematical exactitude.   Susan Somerville was not rich enough to be his wife, but she is poor enough, pretty enough, and loving enough, to be his mistress." Lou- ise suppressed a cry of horror and disgust. "Certainly; so he marries the unloved heiress, and takes the loved beggar under his protec-- tion." Louise dropped her head upon her 'mother's shoulder, and groaned- ' Oh, mother! what horrors are these you are revealing -to me My brain is reeling, reeling I my mind wanders. This is very dreadful, and yet it is of Louis--Louis that you speak! Oh, this is very, very horrible, and yet it is my mother that tells me. Yes, yes! my mind wanders-loses itself. All sup- port, all reliance seems falling beneath me! I am lost-dying!   Mother I mother!" and Louise lost her voice, and grew deadly pale and faint. Mrs. Armstrong supported her on her bosom, while she bathed her temples with Cologne. "No, not all supp'ort is lost to you, my child. Your mother still remains, Louise."  "Oh, my mother! but this that you tell me,  this that you tell me! It is too horrible to be true; but you, you tell it to me--you, whose word is truth; and to doubt your word, my mother, would be blasphemy." "Do not sink under this, Louise. Your mother remains to you, my child. You have suffered a cruel, cruel wrong, but do not die under it." "Alas! Louis. The lost angel himself was not more beautiful, more treacherous than Louis. Lay me down, mother; I am weak all over; I cannot sit up. Lay me down, mother." Mrs. Armstrong supported her to one of the white dimity-covered settees, laid her on it, sat by her, fanned her, bathed her forehead with Cologne, and talked to her in a soothing and subdued tone. Seeing that, even with the aid of these efforts, she did not revive, Mrs. Armstrong touched the bell and summoned Kate to bring a cordial. When Louise swal- lowed that, a little faint color came back into her cheeks, and she looked up. Then Mrs. Armstrong said to her, in order not to lose an 'inch of ground- "Do you know that I have been to The Isle of Rays this morning, my daughter?" "No, my mother, I did not." "Yes, my child, I went there 'again; I went there to have justice rendered my child." "Justice I Alas I mother, if Louis does not love me, and loves Susan Somerville, he can-   not help it; and there is an end. Nothing can be done, and nothing remains to me but- to die!" "My poor Louise, like a heart-sick child as you are! that is not the justice I spoke of. You know that you were to have been the mistress of that house, Louise, and that you are not; that your former governess is ele- vated to that dignity." 'She is welcome to it, mother. I do not care about it. Oh! if'you knew how little I care for such distinction-how much I loved Brighty-how willing I was that she should take the burden, with the dignity, off my shoulders. Ah! now   I care for nothing, nothing!" "But I care for you, Louise; I, your mother, feel interested in your welfare. And I say, Louise, that you have been cheated out of your affections and your rank, both." "For the latter I do not care. Let us talk no longer of the former, mother." "Let me conclude, my dear, and then we will be silent for ever upon the subject." "Yes. Silence! darkness! quietude! death! that is what I want, mother." "Louise, when I went this morning to The Isle of Rays, I was,met with refusal- defiance." "Alas, mother!" "That affected reconciliation, Louise, was all a piece of wicked hypocrisy. As soon as I demanded justice for my  daughter, I was met with insult that obliged me to leave the house."                  ] "Oh, mother! I do not know what justice i we want. I want peace. My very heart is 1 dying in my bosom, and my mind wanders- - wanders-wanders!" she groaned, turning'her head from side to side, uneasily.     i "Be  at rest, Louise. Remain with your t mother, who loves you.  I  do not flatter V and cajole my child, it is true, for my affec- h tion is as dignified as it is disinterested and ] enduring."                 I "There is no doubt about your affection, at n least, my mother."             a "Then you will content yourself to remain fl with me, Louise!"            t "Alas where else should I go, mother  Back to a nest of--; and yet I do love f{ them-Brighity, the  General, and  dearest r; Louis. And though they should betray me a a thousand times, I  cannot help loving: them e still, loving them fondly."        h( ti   CHAPTER XI.

Louis STUART-GORDON had hurried to Alex- t andria as fast as his horse could take him [ thither; had reached the city in season, and I had been so fortunate as to repurchase, at a I small advance, the two old people. Giving them a pass and money to bear their expenses, , he had left them to follow him, and set out for home. Blithely Louis started on his return. He was far too young not to feel a keen de- light in making others happy. He was very happy just now. The sunshine was so bright; the air-so fresh; the landscape so beautiful; the song of the birds so thrillingly rapturous; the voice of the waterfalls so glad; his own physical organization so harmoniously attuned to all this beauty and joy, that it was no won- der 'the heart of Louis beat in response to all this glory of nature. Then all the past was so delightful to recall; the future so blissful to an- ticipate. Had he not just made a whole family happy? Was he not about to be supremely happy himself, in meeting Louise? Was he not in the very morning of life-just eighteen -with a beautiful and beloved wife two years younger;   with an Eden home; with con- genial friends; with immense wealth; with a heart and mind capable of enjoying his position in the highest degree; with every blessing himself-with great facilities of blessing others? Never had Louis so keenly appreciated the blessedness of his life, as very late, on the even-' ing of  his return, when approaching the river, the white walls of Mont Crystal, between the di- vided forest that crowned the hill, loomed up in his sight, just discernible in the bright starlight. He   would go there first, and defer his visit to The Crags and his return to the Isle until the next day. He spurred his horse into a gallop, and rode rapidly up to the outer gate; and flinging himself from the saddle, he attempted to open it. It was locked on the inside. It was a heavy oak gate, painted green, and fastened with a  strong chain and padlock. He rapped loudly with the loaded end of his riding- whip. The noise of his rap dying away in echo, left silence. -He listened. Nothing was heard but the chirping of those little insects that wake at night, and the slight rustle of the leaves, and the low murmur of the waters. He   waited. No one replied. A vague fear passed over his mind. Was Louise ill I He looked up, the long locust avenue at the house, some hundred yards back, It was closed up-but then it was always so after dark. He rapped again, loudly and long; watched, listened. Again the sound died away in silence, leaving- nothing but the low rural night sounds audible. He rapped a third time, as loudly as possible, and shouted, "The house, the house, there!" Again he watched, listened, watched. This time he perceived a figure approaching down the shaded avenue. It was Kate Jumper, who stood now at the gate. "Ha, Kate, how do you do?' How is Mrs. Louis and your mistress? You kept me wait- ing here a long time, my good Kate. Where is the porter? Come Kate, my good woman, unfasten the gate; I am impatient; be quick!" "The ladies are not at home, sir," replied the mulatto, stolidly. "4 Not at home I Oh, I am sorry for; that! Where have they been spending the day? They are late on their visit. However, admit me, Kate; I will await their return." "The ladies will not be back to-night, sir." "Not to-night? How singular I Where have they gone?" "I do not know, sir." "When are they coming back?" "I do not know, sir." "When did they go?" "I do not know, sir," said the muilatto, still guarding the gate. "You ' do not know' when they went--you, who were here all the time I Kate, what does all this mean " exclaimed the ,young man, in surprise. "I do not know, sir."   ,: ' You ' do not know' still I Explain yourself, woman," commanded Mr. Stuart-Gordon, look- ing severely at her dogged countenance. She paused in silence. "Speak!" "What must I say, sir "  "Where are your ladies?" "I do not know, sir." "Tut! I am a fool to grow impatient at a sulky negro," thought Louis. Then his countenance lighted up, and he ex- claimed- "Oh, I have it! They are at The Isle of Rays. Yes, certainly, they are at The Isle of Rays. Strange I did not think of it at once. Say, Kate, are they not at the Isle "  "I do not know, sir."         I "Tchat!" exclaimed Louis, between  impa- 1   tience and amazement at the woman's sullen- ness, as he hopped into his saddle, and turned his horse's head towards the Isle. "So best; expecting me to go home first. Louise has gone home to receive me-that dear, gentle Louise." And Louis quickened his horse's pace into a gallop, and in half an hour reached the Isle, fully expecting to find the drawing-room lighted up, and wearing a festive appearance for his reception. He galloped rapidly up to the door. There was no unusual brilliancy about the-front entrance. He threw himself from the saddle, gave the bridle. to Apollo, who stood to take it, and with a hasty question of "All well at home, Apollo?" to which Apollo replied, "Yes, sir," he hastened into the house, through the hall, and entered the oak parlor. His father and his belle mere, as he fondly termed Britannia, were at supper together; and a third cover was laid for him- self, as though they had expected him, but finally sat down without him. Louis started, looked around with surprise; then, having hastily shaken hands with his father, and kissed the cheek of his step-mother, Louis, again looking rapidly around, exclaim- ed- "Where is Louise? I expected to find her here." "She is at Mont Crystal," said Britannia. "No, she is not, madam. I have just come from there, and felt sure of finding her here." "You have been to Mont Crystal, then, Louis?" "Certainly, sir. I went there just as a mat- ter of course, with the expectation of meeting Louise." "Well?" - "-And Mrs. Armstrong's attendant met me and told me they were not at home, nor could I get any satisfaction as to where they were." "Sit down, Louis, and take your tea," said Britannia. Louis took the seat indicated, and received a cup of tea from Britannia, still looking all-round anxiously. , "My dear father, it is absurd to feel un- easy about this chance absence, but I do feel so, nevertheless. I suppose it is the effect of the mere disappointment; that there is--oh, surely no, there can be-no real!Cause for anxiety 1" "Nonsense  Compose yourself, and drink your tea, Louis. You cannot see your wife to-night; atnd that, upon the night of..your re- turn, is a serious disappointment, I grant. But you are fatigued; you will sleep it through, and, to-morrow is a new day."   "But, father, it was so strange in Louise to go off on the evening I was expected home--" "My son, she was with her mnother, and if that lady autocrat chose to take her off on a visit, Louise could not resist her will." "True; but then there was something strange in that woman's--Kate's, I mean-con- duct towards me." "My dear Louis, Kate was always a sulky devil; never heed her. Eat, Louis, eat, and afterwards sleep. To-morrow hurry to Mont Crystal as early as you please." There was a self-possession, a freedom from anxiety, in the manners of both the General and Brighty that calmed the perturbation of Louis; so that, though certainly a little pen- sive from his disappointment, he was no longer uneasy. To shorten the hours of absence by sleep, Louis soon retired to his room. "We were right not to tell him any bad news to-night, dear Brighty," said the Gen- eral; "it would have spoiled his appetite and sleep. As it is, his hearty supper and good night's rest will make him stronger to en- couinter Mrs. Armstrong to-morrow morning. For the present let him rest." They iwere early risers at The Isle of Rays. Indeed, upon these glorious mornings in this paradise of nature, every hour spent in sleep seemed a wanton waste of happiness. The most cheerful place in the world was the breaklfast parlor at The Isle of Rays. You shall judge. It was at the angle formed by the front and side of the house. The front windows looked out upon the piazza, and coiim- manded a view of the beautiful terrace with its graceful locust trees dropping soft shadows on the grass-the lawn, with its shaded walks, its 'brooks, its waterfalls, and groves-upon the arm of the river that passed between the Isle and the opposite shore-upon the green hills, rising, receding, and losing themselves in the dim and distant mountains, with their tops in the clouds, at the utmost verge of the ho- rizon. Through these front windows also shone the morning sun, whose first beams fell upon the .breakfast-table, shining dazzlingly upon the snow-white damask cloth, and kin- dling into splendor the tea and coffee service. The back windows of this cheerful room opened upon a garden of roses, now so fresh with morning dew that, their odor filled the room. And then the birds I throwing all their souls of joy in their rapturous morning reveille 1 Brighty was in this room very early; Brigh- ty in her cool and graceful morning-dress of   /J LJ-JUa. VT /, VIV, India muslin, moving abouit blithely, occupied with the thousand and one little cares and pleasures of housekeeping that not all her staff of servants could deliver her from. Now stop- ping to adjust upon the table some dish just brought up, now arranging, at the back win- dows, the branch of some rose-bush peeping through, now at the front windows, pausing, in enhanced delight, to receive the inflowing of all the divine beauty and melody around her. The door opened; Louis Stuart-Gordon entered. Brighty came forward, smiling and holding out her hand. Louis gayly and fondly carried it to his lips. "Madam," said Louis, "how long will it be before we shall have breakfast?" "Ah! you are in a hurry to reach Mont Crystal. You need not be, for if the family remained abroad all night, it is likely that they will not be at home until after breakfast. UWe only wait for the General." "Madam," again said Louis, smilingly taking her hand, " do you know that I find some em- barrassment in addressing you? To call you Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, is quite too formal; to call you 'mother,' would be absurd, and I dare not call you Britannia. Twenty times, ma belle mere, I have been on the point of asking you what I shall call you." "Call her Brighty I call her Brighty, Louis!" said the General, who suddenly stood among :them. "Call her by the pretty contraction of Britannia-Brighty-for she is the bright- ness of your father's house-the brightness of his heart and life ;"-and the General drew her to his bosom and kissed her fondly. "And, Louis, never raise the tips,.of her fingers to your lips, when her cheek is glowing so near you. Love Brighty, Louis, as Louise loves her. Brighty always carried a heart under that glowing bodice of hers." "Come! to breakfast!" smiled Britannia, leading the way to the table. Breakfast passed off in a gay chat. Louis soon dispatched his coffee and muffins, and, excusing himself, arose to leave the table. "Off, Louis?" asked the General. "Yes, sir." "To Mont Crystal?" "Yes, sir." "Stay, Louis; sit down, my dear son; Brigh- ty and myself wish to have a little conversation with you before you set out." Louis resumed his seat, and turned his face towards his father with an attitude and expres- sion of attention. "We would not, disturb you with any thing   unpleasant last night, Louis, because it was too late to do any thing, and because it wou!d only have spoiled your supper and your rest -and we consider that every good meal and every good sleep is so much real gain in this world of infirmity and sullenness. For the same reason, Louis, I said nothing until you had breakfasted-and, Louis," continued the General, buttering his muffin, "I should have said nothing until you had digested your break- fast, only that your haste makes the disclosure necessary." Louis had been growing uneasy-anxious; his looks expressed it. "Well, sir!" "Well, Louis-but, my son, do not look so alarmed-" "But Louise! Louise!" "Is well and happy, for aught I know to the contrary--" "And-" "At Mont Crystal with her mother of course, where I strongly suspect she was at the very moment you called there." "Sir! my father!" "Wait, Louis, and hear me explain. The affected reconciliation was all a stratagem on the part of Mrs. Armstrong to get Louise into her power. She shuts her up at Mont Crystal, denying admittance to every member of our family."                  , "My wife! What can be her reason?" ex- claimed Louis, divided between astonishment and indignation. "Ah! the reason!" repeated the General, sipping his coffee. "Who can fathom the heart ] and discover the motive of a bad woman for 1 her bad acts "       " "But her ostensible reason?" "Her ostensible reason is that the terms of ( the marriage contract have not been kept, inas- ] much as Louise is not at the head of this es- tablishment. This reason she gave on a visit ( she made me about a week since, affirming at x the same time that, until myself and my wife should give up possession here, Louise should r not see or speak to her husband, or any mem- h ber of his family."            t q'"The old controversy, then, sir?" "Exactly.  But her real reason is a con- p ,cealed mortification and desire of revenge." fi Here General Stuart-Gordon, for the  first time, related to Louis the. mutual and terrible p misapprehension of himself and Mrs. Armstrong, tl when conversing upon matrimonial subjects. si Louis and Britannia, despite of the serious n: matter in hand, gave way to the ludicrousness 10   of the scene as described by the General, and laughed heartily. The laugh did Louis good. It raised his spirits. "Now, Louis," continued the General,. " we do not consider the matter very grave. Of course this lady must give up your wife. It would be absurd to suppose that she would refuse steadily. The worst will be a rupture between the families of Mont Crystal and the Isle. That will be unpleasant, certainly. But really perfect happiness is not the lot of any human being, and, as we have so many bless- ings, we must reconcile ourselves to this un-- pleasantry, considering, meanwhile, that to be struck from the visiting list of Mrs Armstrong is one of the lightest miseries that could hap- pen to us. But, Brighty, my dear, you are looking gloomy. What is the matter?" "I am thinking of Louise--poor child; that whoever gains the victory, she must be the loser; and I am wishing, if possible, that, for her sake, a permanent peace could be effected." "I wish so, too." "Have you any thing farther to say to me, my dear sir." "Oh, no!--oh, no! I thought it right to, put you in possession of the facts before- you left; that is all. I did not, myself, however, consider them  very important, ex-- cept that they might have given you unneces-- sary anxiety."  m Louis bowed, and left the room. "You have eaten no breakfast, my dear- Brighty," said the General. "I am thinking of Louise and Louis. They love one another so fondly; and they are. both so gentle-poor children; and they should be so happy; and I sympathize so - much in their affection for each other, that I dread every thing that seriously threatens their- peace." "Do not feel so much, my darling. You, did not seem to think this very serious till. now." "Nor did I, sir-for I did not know until now how great a humiliation she had suffered;. how lasting a cause of vengeance that will be to a woman like her." "Yet Mrs. Armstrong will not dare to brave public opinion by attempting to keep Louise from her husband." "Mrs. Armstrong will dare do any thing she. pleases to do; and Mrs. Armstrong would think it very impertinent in public opinion to sit in judgment on any of her actions. Take- my knowledge of her for that." "Yet you did not seem to know her very-   well, Brighty. She deceived you, as all of us, in her affected reconciliation;" "I did not know her duplicity, sir, certainly; and it was the very last vice of which I should have suspected her. I knew her almost om- nipotence of will, her immutability of pur- pose; but I supposed her too haughty for v duplicity; and a woman like her resorting to duplicity, only proves how deeply seated her desire of vengeance is, and that alarms me the more." "Oh I nonsense, my dear. Would you make me believe that Mrs. Armstrong is a Lady Macheth? Come," said he, going to the table and pouring out a cup of coffee--" drink this, darling, and discover for yourself what a dif- ferent aspect affairs will wear after a good cup of coffee." Brighty's smile broke out like sunshine, chasing the shadow from her brow, as she re- ceived the cup so affectionately tendered, and sipped its contents. "There now, you shall have your song, as usual, before you. go out," she said, rising gayly, and leading the way to the parlor -" A hunting song, of course, my- dear Nim- rod!" "Of course, my dear Brighty." She played a prelude, and commenced sing- ing an inspiring old song, of which the Gener- al was very fond-"Harkraway! hark away! hark away  to the downs!"-the General standing at the back of her chair, and joining An the chorus. At its conclusion she would jhave left the piano, but, the General telling :.her that lie should not go out until the return tof Louis, she resumed her seat, and played and :sung several other pieces to fill up the time, ,until the horse of Louis galloped into the yard, :and his step sounded in the hall. He entered, ;pale and agitated. "Well, Louis " anxiously exclaimed both ithe General and Brighty. Louis threw himself into a chair before speaking; then he said--"I have been denied admittance." ".Certainly, we expected that. Indeed, we *considered your visit merely as a matter of  form-a preliminary necessary before making :a formal demand for- the restitution of your ,wife. Now, Louis,- you are to write to Mrs. Armstrong, demanding the return of Louise." "No," said Louis, ' 1 shall first write to ,Louise, requesting her to come home." "Do so, then, my son." "Take my word for it, Louise will never get ,your letter," said Britannia, " unless you take   some indirect and secret way of getting it into; her hands." "Zounds I! It would be a relief at this mo- ment to swear. Was ever a respectable family placed in so awkward and ridiculous a position before?" "Louis, don't be a fool-take no more con- -ciliatory measures at all. It is loss of time and labor. Raise the devil about the ears of that old Hecate! Get out a writ of habeas corpus. Sue for your marital rights."' "Sue for my marital rights!  Saints and angels! my father, but you have forgotten all that is lovely in love, to dream of such a thing. Sue for my marital rights I  Sue whom? Sue Louise, that gentle and tender Louise? Sue her! Yes. Heaven knows, if I could get admittance to her dear presence, how I would sue her I With bended knee and up- lifted hands and eyes, I would sue for the priv- ilege of :passing my whole life with her, of devoting my whole life to her. That is the manner in which I would sue Louise." . "And you are right, my dear, noble-hearted Louis. You would not shock her delicacy, or wound her sensibilities, by any other suit, at least." "May God mend the wits of all poets, I say I That's for your benefit, Louis! And for you, Miss Brighty! bright eyes-bright hair- bright lips-do youwaun away! Nay, I im- plore you to do so; that I may show Master Louis how long I should sit here, twisting my fingers, with my eyes on the ground, in patient widowhood 1" exclaimed the General, in a half- petulant, half-caressing tone. "No, I am much obliged to you, sir. I prefer not. Like Mrs. Armstrong, I think that all scenes are decidedly vulgar; unlike Mrs. Armstrong, I cannot defy public opinion " Then turning to Louis, she said-"Ai I beg of you, Louis, is, that you will do nothing in haste. Be patient for a little while. Do not, above-all things, let this matter become public through any imprudence of yours. Let the world believe for the present, that Louise is on a visit to her mother. Wait; this cannot last. It is preposterous to think that a young husband and young wife, who love each other tenderly, can be separated finally by any thing but death. All that is to be feared now, is, that this matter will get out, and reflect dis- credit upon the family. That would be so shocking! Guard against that, Louis? Be patient, and I will do all that I can for you. All will be well. Come, Louis, be cheerful!" "Ah, madam t if you did but know how   this treatment of me by Louise pierces my heart!" "I do know it, dear Louis; but you must not blame Louise too severely. A rule that would apply to any other woman will not apply to her. Louise has received a pe- culiar education. It was in consideration of that fact that I applauded your resolution of not suing otherwise than; as a lover might. Louise loves you tenderly, and suffers in this separation from you, but she considers that her first duty is obedience to her mother. That duty has been impressed on her mind from her infancy up. She knows nothing of her duty as a wife; that has never been taught her." "But one would suppose," said Louis, " that her natural instincts would enlighten her." "Dear Louis, her mother has taught her to consider her mere instincts as so many temp- tations of the evil one. Louise has been taught but one of the Ten Commandments, ' Honor thy father and thy mother'-but not 'Love and honor thy husband;' she knows nothing of that. The whole of the life of Louise has been spent in learning and practising one lesson-filial honor and obedience. It is her idiosyncrasy-her monomania. All her life she has been in the hands of her mother, and that mother has used that time in obtainin) and confirming an almost omnipotent power over the heart of her child. And at her mother's command she will renounce her hus- band, although her heart were to break in the renunciation 1" "But this is unnatural I monstrous 1" "Yes, it is unnatural-monstrous-but it is the effect of education; and you. know the all-powerful influence of education. One edu- cated in a particular belief, creed-Abe it ever so far from right reason-will die, if necessary, for that creed 1 Some of the gentlest, tenderest, and most timid women that have ever lived, have suffered themselves to be hanged, burned, or torn by wild horses, rather than renounce some point of duty in which they believed, no matter how far from the truth it might be. So with Louise. She will endure all suffering rather than disobey her mother, since that is her religion." "Louis I get her back home; get her home. She is young yet, and you can teach her a new creed. I would not give a cent for a young man who could not induce his young bride to believe that the stars were all an- gels, or any thing else he pleased. Only get her home-by fair means or foul," exclaimed t'i General.   "Hush-sh-sh!" said Brighty, laying one hand on his lips, and throwing the other arm affec- tionately over his shoulder. "Do not urge Louis to any such a step. You do not know Louise as well as I do. She is morbidly sensi- tive-very frail and nervous. Any violent controversy between her husband and her mother would kill Louise." "And yet you bade me wait and hope. Oh, madam, was not that a mockery?" asked Louis, turning reproachfully towards Britannia. "No, Louis, I am incapable of mockery. I advised you not to shock and alarm Louise by any hasty or violent measures. And I told you all I know of her own and her mother's peculiarities, that you may know that violence will do no sort of good, but all harm. And I, entreated, and still entreat, you to have pa- tience-to take time to reflect. I will think for you, and do all in my power to bring matters to a happy issue-use only prudent and conciliatory means at first-and all must be well." With a heavy sigh, Louis took his hat and left the room. General Stuart-Gordon, shaking his head dubiously, soon arose and followed him. Four days passed away, during which Louis had written both to Mrs. Armstrong and to Louise. These letters might as well have been dropped into a well, for any reply they re- ceived. Sunday came. Mrs. Armstrong was a regular attendant at church. "I shall see Louise at morning service," said Louis, and he hurried off to church. The Armstrong pew was empty, and re- mained empty during the whole service. A month elapsed, during which Louis had presented himself many times at Mont Crystal, and had been constantly denied admittance-a month, during which he had written and writ- ten, again and again, to Louise and to Mrs. Armstrong, without producing the slightest effect. By no token could he be sure that they received his letters. They gave no sign, not even by returning them. Mrs. Armstrong maintained a stern but inflexible silence. He attended church regularly, but never met Louise or Mrs. Armstrong there. General Stuart-Gordon wrote to Mrs. Armstrong. His letter also seemed to have fallen into a grave. Then the General called at Mont Crystal, and was told the ladies were not at home. Britan- nia also had made a call with no better suc- cess. Thus two months passed away.   BOOK III.   CHAPTER I.

How many a sleepless form has no other watcher than the patient moon  One quiet night, about the last of October, near midnight, the moon arose, and as it ascended towards the zenith, shed a flood of silver radiance over the river, The Isle of Rays, and the lofty mansion of Mont Crystal. Near the dawn of day, steal- ing through the front windows of Mont Crys- tal, the moonbeams looked into that same front bed-chamber, once described as the summer sleeping-room of Mrs. Armstrong. This cham.- ber contained two bedsteads-a large tent bedstead, with its white dimity curtains down, and a little cot, covered with a white Marseilles counterpane. This little white cot stood be- tween the tent bedstead and the front win- dows. The moonbeams, coming through the window, fell upon the cot and upon the wan face of Louise, glistening upon the tear-drops that hung upon her eyelashes. Here maciated hands were clasped above her head. She lay so still, and looked so white, that but for the glistening tear-drops, and the occasional con- vulsion of her bosom, she might have been sup- posed to be asleep or dead. At last, a slight movement from the tent bedstead startled her. Shbe unclasped her hands, and listened. The noise, as of some one turning in the bed, was repeated. Louise raised upon her elbow, and listened again attentively. She now heard something between a hem and a groan, as of one waking up. Now she murmured softly- "Mother, dear, are you awake?" "Yes, Louise!" proceeded from the curtains. Oh! I am so abd, I have not slept io-   night, mother. I have counted every hour the clock has struck. I have waited for you to wake, so long." "You have had a sleepless night, my child! Why did you not touch the bell, and summon Kate to give you a narcotic? What has been the matter? Nothing but your usual nervous- ness, I hope 9" "Mother, I could not sleep for joy and for sorrow." "Strange paradox, that I what do you mean, Louise ." Louise slipped softly out of bed, and going to the side of the tent bedstead, and putting aside the curtains, stooped and kissed her mother, dropping a tear upon her face. Then kneeling by her side, she took her hand and covered it with kisses, "Mamma; I must return to Louis! indeed I must, mamma, if he will take me back I In- deed I must, mamma, if he were twenty times a traitor 1" "Heyl what I how! what is all this wretched nonsense, now?" "Mamma, I shall be a mother soon!" said Louise, in a voice between timidity and tender- 'ness. "WHAT 1" exclaimed the lady, raising upon her elbow, and gathering her black brows into an awful frown+--"WHAT!" "God has blessed me I I, too, shall be a mother, dear mamma I Oh I mamma, kiss me, now that I have told you!" "It is not true I It cannot be true l" ex- claimed Mrs. Armstrong, still glaring at her daughter. "Mamma, it is so; and I must return to Louis-indeed I must, mamma 1" "To a man whose whole heart is given to his mistress "' "If it be so, it is dreadful, mamma, but I cannot help it. He does love me a little. Any how, I mknow I love him entirely; and, bank- rupt that I am, I could be happier, even in his   divided affection, than I am, severed from him here. And, oh, mother! being separated from him under these circumstances, gives me a feeling of degradation-of shame i" "I do not wonder at it, if these circum- stances were as you fancy, Miss Armstrong." "( Oh, mamma I do not call me' Miss Arm- strong' any longer, I beg of you; for, although as you say I am but a mere child, yet I am not 'Miss Armstrong -' and to hear you call me so, mother, covers my face with burning blushes." "Oh! beg your pardon, Mrs. Louis Stuart- Gordon; I will try to bear in mind your digni- ty for the future." "Mamma, can you not call me Louise? Speak to me kindly, dear mamma." "I am not sufficiently well pleased with you, ma'am, to address you so familiarly." "Mamma, how Iave I given you offence?" "By the subject of your conversation. Now, let me hear no more ridiculous nonsense about returning to that young scapegrace, nor the other miserable shift-about-pshaw I fudge! stuff I you ought to be ashamed of yourself to have such fancies." "It is not fancy, it is fact, mamma." "SILENCE 1 hush I not a word more of this, I command you, Louise. It is false I false I you are too young-far too young. You should blush at such imaginings.' "It is not imagination, mamma ;" persisted Louise, with a tender earnestness. "HusHtI I command you I  Never dare to hint this subject to me, or to any one else, at the peril of my grave displeasure. Shameful I But you are really out of health. You are ill and nervous, and so, of course, full of idle fan- cies. You are too much confined. You do not take exercise enough. You must go out more. You shall ride on horseback. Nothing is better for low spirits than hard riding on a trotting horse. Come, you shall have your first ride to- morrow. We will see if we cannot cure you of these nervous fancies. Now, return to bed, and try to get some sleep. Don't you know you are taking cold, by kneeling here with bare feet? Go to bed. Stay I come back a mo- ment." "Well, mamma i" "This is a very absurd fancy of yours, Louise! Now, I charge you, do not betray your folly to any one. Do not speak of this conceit of yours to a soul. It would subject you to ridicule." "I shall be silent, dear mamma." And Louise crept back to bed--" but not to sleep."   It was a glorious autumn morning that rose upon the world that day. Mrs. Armstrong always arose with the sun precisely. This morning, as soon as its earliest beams, glan- cing between the half-closed shutters, gilded the opposite wall, Mrs. Armstrong was up, and arrayed in an ample flannel wrapper, sitting before her tall dressing-glass, while Kate Jum- per stood behind her, combing out her abuu- dant long black hair, that was still beautiful, though slightly mixed with silver. Mrs. Arm- strong glanced from time to time upon Louise, who still lay extended upon her white cot, per- fectly motionless, her eyes closed, her slender fingers interlocked upon her pale brow-occa- sionally a spasmodic sigh, agitating her bosom, breaking from her lips. 4"What do you think of that child, Kate?" asked the lady, looking searchingly in the face of her attendant "Well, madam, I think she is-indeed all the women about the house know she is-" "In bad health!" said the lady, emphatic- ally, and looking sternly and threateningly at her attendant. "Yes, madam, of course, just as you say, in bad health." "Listen to me I She is out of spirits, and she neglects her toilet sadly-more than I choose that my daughter shall I shall dismiss her maid, and do youitake her place, and su- perintend the dressing of your young lady. Do not permit her to go about as loosely and carelessly arrayed as has been her custom of late. See that she wears her stays; do you hear?"              i "Yes, madam, I hear and understand." "Hear and literally obey. Do' not trouble your understanding with more than the literal command." Another glance at Louise found her gentle eyes now open, and calmly turned on her mother.  "It is time to rise, my daughter. You are to take a ride this morning, directly after breakfast. Kate will dress you," said the lady; "and, Louise, I insist upon  your paying more attention to your personal ap- pearance. Kate has my orders." And the lady, whose turban was now arranged, took up her bunch of keys, and marched from the room. One thing Mrs. Armstrong wished to avoid in these rides-that was, the possibility of a rencounter with Louis, or, what was worse, with that old "Island Seal," as she called the  General. To avoid euch a recounter by a   keen vigilance, and, in the event of a chance meeting, to prevent Louise from " falling into the hands of the enemy," Mrs. Armstrong, who was an excellent equestrian, determined to accompany her daughter. "We will go down to see Zoe. Since the girl knows her place, and does not presume on our former notice of her to appear at Mont Crystal, we can show her some kindness-can engage her to do some work for us," said the lady, as soon as she and her daughter were in their saddles. And whipping her horse into a smart trot, she set out for the Dovecote, at- tended by a mounted servant to open the gates. Arrived at the summit of the hill, and before beginning to descend the narrow bridle- path leading down into the glen where was situated the Dovecote, Mrs. Armstrong took out her glass, and threw a sweeping glance over the ground that lay stretched down be- fore them. Apparently satisfied by her sur- vey, they began to descend the path. They arrived at the cottage without meeting with any one. The external appearance of the Dovecote was certainly improved. Tile yard was a wilderness of roses. The windows were open, and rare and beautiful exotics in flower-pots sat upon the sills; they filled the air with their fragrance. Mrs. Armstrong  looked around with surprise, and Louise with delight, as they alighted from their saddles, and passed through the little wicket up the walk. The inside of the cot was as much improved as the exterior. Pale pink gingham curtains at the windows shed a delicate rose-colored light through the room. Zoe's own carpet, fresh as ever, was upon the floor. A few choice pictures, all of cheerful or of loving subjects, were on the wall. A small mahogany bookcase, filled with books, and surmounted by a little plaster-cast statuette, stood between the rose-curtained, flower-filled windows. More than all-the idol of the little housewise-a a nice mahogany workstand, with two folding leaves and two drawers, and surmounted by a workbox, completely furnished, stood near the corner of the hearth. Zoe, neatly dressed in white muslin, sat at this workstand in a little rocking-chair without arms, her feet resting upon a little embroidered footstool. On her lap lay a piece of work, in which she seemed to take great delight. It was an infant's slip she was embroidering. Zoe was humming a lullaby tune to some imaginarybaby, and look- ing the picture of content. Did you expect that Zoe was heart-broken? i   Zoe was too much of a child and a housewife to break her heart for what had happened to her, after her first fit of crying. There was not a single capillary vein of tragedy in all Zoe's happy organization. She perfectly un- derstood that the coffee-pot must boil through all sorts of troubles. Governments might be subverted, but supper must be got. Kings might be decapitated, but clothes must be cut, and so Zoe unconsciously sung the imaginary baby to sleep, while she wrought mimic heart's-ease and rose-buds in the border of the cambric slip. On the opposite side of the work-table, in a large easy chair, sat the old schoolmaster. He had grown fat, and was clothed in a cool, loose white linen jacket and trowsers, and his face wore an air of celestial calmness. He was playing with two beautiful, frolicksome tortoise-shell kittens, that -continually leaped about him, or climbing upon his shoulders, licking his hands, or nestling in his bosom. It was plain that the old man had reached his second childhood, and that it was as innocent and as happy as his first. There was not a single care, or fear, or doubt, on that divinely serene countenance-divinely serene, except when changed by a laugh, as glad as ever rang from his boyhood's lips. Such a laugh had just rung out. The tortoise-shell kittens had made a simultaneous spring to reach his back, and tumbling over each other, had rolled upon the floor, and the old man had just laughed aloud---when the door opened, and Mrs. Arm- strong and Louise appeared. Zoe laid down her little slip upon the stand, and came forward, courtesying, and setting chairs. Mrs. Armstrong, with a condescending nod to the schoolmaster, seated herself. But Louise turned and tenderly embraced Zoe, while she said, with a gentle smile- "Why, Zoe, have you not been to Mont Crystal of late? Didn't you know, Zoe, that nothing that could happen to you, without your own fault, could make any change in my feelings towards you Oh! Zoe " she said, sinking her voice to a low whisper, "don't you know that I would have hastened to you as soon as ever I got home--if I had been per- mitted?" "I know you would have done so, Mrs. Stuart-Gordon," said Zoe, pressing her hand. "Why don't you call me Louise?"  I \ "Circumstances have so changed with me, young lady, that I must remember my own position, lest others should be obliged to re- mind me of it," said Zoe, with something of   gentle dignity in her manner. Then, still holding the hand of Louise, with the other hand she gracefully indicated the chair, and seated her in it. Mrs. Armstrong was endeavoring to con- verse with the old schoolmaster. Louise and Zoe were seated at the work-table. "I am glad to see you looking so happy and well, dear Zoe." "Wily should I not be? What is changed, except in name? Oh1 I cried at first, though! Oh! I cried my eyes out, nearly! I thought I should be cast out I! I thought that all my friends, whom I loved, so dearly, would aban- don me. But, ah! it has been so different! My friends have changed indeed-but to greater kindness. Gertrude-Miss Lion; I should say-who used to treat me very capri- ciously, sometimes petting, sometimes abusing me-Miss Lion treats me with the affection of a sister; and Brighty-I mean Mrs. General Stuart-Gordon-oh! she has been an angel to me and to my adopted father, there. Look around upon this room, madam! all this cheer- ful beauty is her work-her bounty-although she conceals it all under the veil of a liberal pay for the sewing I do for her. Ah! surely never prosperity blessed a worthier one than that ladv." Louise was turning over and examining the baby-slip with curiosity and interest. "Do you sew for any other family except that of the Isle, Zoe?" "No ; Mrs. Stuart-Gordon gives me as much sewing as I can possibly do, and pays me most liberally. Then she always gives me a great deal, and with her true native delicacy, gives me only the work of her own hands, or the produce of her own garden or conservatory. Look at those pictures on'the. walls; they were painted by her. This little ottoman I use when sewing was worked by her. Look at those tea-roses and heliotropes in the pretty porcelain flower-pots in the window-they were sent from her conservatory. And the variety of roses in the yard were all sent from her garden of roses at the,back of the Island breakfast-room." "Dear Brighty I she is an angel; but, in- deed, dear Zoe, my will to serve you was as good as hers." "I know it, my dear young lady." Louise was still turning over the little slip -measuring the little waist-running her fingers into the little sleeves. Zoe now ob- served her occupation, and forgetting her pur- posed reserve, and smiling and blushing, she   bent her head to the ear of Louise, and whis- pered with a girlish confidence- "Do you know, Louise, that notwithstanding all that has happened to me, I only need one thing to make me completely happy." "And what is that, Zoe?" "A baby! Oh I I do want to find a baby so bad I Ever since I left off my doll, I have thought, if I only had a- live baby to dress and nurse, I should be the happiest of mor- tals." "Then suppose you should go out as a nurse," said Louise, half jestingly. "No, that would never suit me, never I I have been mistress of my own house ever since I was nine years old, and I could not live in any body else's," said the little housekeeper, with gentle pride.. "No, Louise, I would like to find a baby under a tree, or on the door- step,. some fine day-some dear little lost baby, that I could take care of; dear me, how I should love it I They say that every human being's eyes and hopes are fixed on some " far- off, unattained," and unattainable good I My eyes are fixed on a baby I and, please the loving angels, I will some day pick up one of the Lord's lost little ones, and raise it for my own, and it shall call me mother, and then I shall not care a straw if I am an old maid 1! But I say, Louise," added she, laughing slyly, "is it not dismal, when we young girls can no longer cheat ourselves with nursing dolls?" Louise smiled sadly, and asked, still ex- amining the little slip- "Are you making this for your Utopian baby?" "N--no-that is for Brighty-I mean Mrs* Stuart-Gordon 1" "Ha I what?" "Certainly; here"--continued Zoe, drawing out a large work-basket from under the table -" look at all the sweet pretty little things 1" The two girls were soon quite absorbed in examining tiny caps, bibs, slips, &c. While thus engaged, Louise stooped, and whispered in the ear of Zoe this question- "How is your father, Zoe I He looks bet- ter and happier than I ever saw him; happier, indeed, than any one I see anywhere; yet there is something strange about him-what ia it T" "Listen, Louise 1 I will tell you all about it. He has passed an innocent and a beneficent life; oh! has he not i" "Indeed he has I from all that we have heard of him, and from all that we have ob- served ourselves." "Yet a life full of toil and privation'."   "Yes," "His life has been like a cloudy day, that ends in a clearing up at set of sun--a sunset glorious as the gates of Heaven, When the revelation of 'my true position was suddenly made to him, the shock, together with his ap- prehension of the most terrible results, shook his mind and body nearly to dissolution. For months he was metamorphosed-unrecognizable n-mad almost. When we got to The Lair, Brutus, by pledging himself to avert the worst consequences that might fall upon my head, tranquillized him; but he did not recover his normal state of mind; he fell into a sort of ab- straction, that lasted all the time of our stay at The Lair. After our return to this cottage, he began to rouse up from this dull abstrac- tion, and awake, not to what he ever had been since I knew him, but to a sort of gladness and boyishness. And he has grown fat and fair, and there he is-the happy child-angel that you see him. It is profane to call this beautiful emancipation of this guileless spirit dotage--it is ' second childhood' indeed!--a state very near beatification I Oh, Louise! nothing has ever revealed Heaven to me with so much power as this old man's so-called ' dotage.' The dotage of a life innocent as his has been-what is it but the blissful trance of a spirit standing on the confines of both worlds -communing with both, bearing from the one a glory that enlightens the other I He seems to me always an angel, or a child. Listen, Louise I While we sit here together-I with my needle, he with his pets-sometimes he lets them run off, and closes his eyes, and sinks into a sort of happy abstraction, a beautiful calm diffuses itself over his countenance, which anon grows brighter and brighter, until it seems to radiate light and beauty, as an angel's; and I pause from my work, and gaze with awe, until my faith in Heaven reaches certainty. And presently he will awake from that abstraction, and begin to look around, and chat with me, and play with his pets, and laugh as gleefully as a child at the merest trifle. Yet there is no folly, no imbecility, not the least in all this-it is always the innocent joy of the child, or the inspiration of the angel." Mrs. Armstrong, while apparently occupied' with the old man, had lost no part of this con- a versation; and her brow had grown very dark  at those parts that had concerned Britannia,  The old man now arose, and approached the.  girls, and looked wistfully into the face of \ Louise; then he stretched forth his hand, and v   laying it on her head, blessed her. Then he stooped, and said confidentially to Zoe, point- ing to Mrs. Armstrong. "Don't let her come and sit by me again, Zoe. She has made me feel cold all over, and made my eyes dim. And this little child, Zoe," he said, laying his hand on the head of Louise, " tibs poor little chilled blue-pale child, she must not stay near her, or she will be frost-bitten, as the flowers are, and die as the flowers do." "What does he say about his flowers?" asked Mrs. Armstrong, now approaching the table. "He says they will be frost-bitten, if exposed to the cold," answered Zoe. The old man shrunk gently away at the lady's approach, passed around the table, hold- ing by it, and tottered back to his seat. "Have you engaged this girl to make up your autumn dresses, Louise?" "No, mamma; Zoe has as much work as she can do," replied Louise. "Then we need not delay our return," said Mrs. Armstrong. Louise arose to take leave of Zoe, and found an opportunity of saying to her- "I have no room, not a nook or corner, at Mont Crystal, for my private use, Zoe-I share my mother's apartments; but if I ever should get back to The Isle of Rays, a spare room there shall always be at your service, Zoe; and in the mean time, dear Zoe, I shall be, very happy to see you at Mont Crystal, if you can take any pleasure in seeing me always in the com- pany of others." They then took leave of the schoolmaster and left the cottage. Remounting their horses, and followed by their attendant, Mrs. Armstrong and Louise entered the bridle-path leading through the glen and up the hill. This path was very narrow, with a high, thick wood on both sides. They rode in sin- gle file-Mrs. Armstrong first, Louise next, and their servant behind. The lady had near- ly reached the top of the hill, when a lady and gentleman on horseback, appeared sud- denly in sight, riding down the path, meeting them. It was Britannia, in high beauty, attired in an elegant dark-blue velvet riding-habit and cap, with a floating white plume, and mounted on a jet-black horse. She was followed by Louis Stuart-Gordon, looking pale. and hag- gard, in his usual dress' of simple black, and mounted on his dark-bay horse.   There was no avoiding the meeting now. Mrs. Armstrong and her party paused and drew aside for the new-comers to pass. Mrs. Armstrong drew up her majestic figure to its loftiest height, gathered her dark brows into an awful frown, and looked Sternly and straight ahead. Louise grew deadly pale, dropped her head upon her bosom and her eyes upon the ground. Britannia passed first. She threw a glance of indignation at the haughty countenance of Mrs. Armstrong, and turned a look full of pitying affection upon the pale face of Louise. Louis came next. Lifting his cap from his head, and bowing low as his saddle, he held it thus until he had passed them. They rode down the hill. With a frowning brow and curling lip, Mrs. Armstrong whipped up her horse, just as the servant sprang before her and caught Louise, who was falling from her saddle. "t Take her before you on the horse. Take her before you on the horse. Fly with her to Mont Crystal   Quick, quick, quick " ex- claimed Mrs. Armstrong, who, by a rapid glance, had perceived that Louis, looking back, had seen Louise swoon, and was now spurring his horse rapidly up the hill towards them. . The man raised -the fainting girl, and fled with her towards Mont Crystal. Louis Stuart-Gordon overtook Mrs. Arm- strong, who, keeping in the middle of the path, would not suffer him to pass her. He addressed her with respectful courtesy, requesting her to give way, that he might ride on and see Louise. 'Mrs. Armstrong sat straight up in the sad- dle, looked straight on before her, and rode leisurely, without replying. He spoke to her again, earnestly, and in- quired after the health of his wife. Mrs. Armstrong did not answer. He argued with her, entreated her. Mrs. Armstrong persevered in a stern silence, until they had reached the gates of Mont Crystal, when, turning to him, she said- "Sir, my daughter is in fine health and spi- rits. You need give yourself no impertinent uneasiness about her."  She passed the gates. They clanged to behind her, leaving Louis reining up his horse without. "And Louise is dying-slowly dying-t I   know it!" he exclaimed, as he galloped madly o back to The Isle of Rays. The waiter who went to summon Louis to breakfast the next morning found him in high delirium. The grief, suspense, anxiety of the last two months, acting upon a singularly delicate and susceptible organization, had now brought a crisis, and Louis Stuart-Gordon was raving in a brain-fever. CHAPTER IL THE SOLITARY. Go-be sure of my love-by thy treason forgiven; Of my prayers--by the blessings they win -thee from Heaven I Of my grief--guess the length of the sword bycthe sheath's; By the silence of life-more pathetic than death's. Go-be clear of that day! Eliz. B. Browtoningr. "WELL, Kate!" "Well, madam, I went to the bridge, lead- ing from the river shore to The Isle of Rays, as you commanded me, and there I waited un- til old Seraphina passed, as I expected." "Go on." "Well, madam, as you told me to find out all I could Without going on to the premises, or asking questions, I thought there was no other way of discovering what was passing at the mansion, than by picking a quarrel with her; so I stooped down, and pretended to be looking for maninosies; placing myself di- rectly in her path as she had to go by me, I tripped her up-she fell upon her face-" "Well F' "She scrambled up, with her nose and mouth   bleeding, foaming with fury, and swore -- "Well, well-go on, will you-what did she say?" "She said--' If you and your missis don't go to de debil, I don't see use ob habbin any debil to go to! and I thinks de Lord might's well turn him out ob office." "Silence-insolent I I do not ask you for these petty -details. In one word,-now, what did you learn I What is the state of Louis Stuart-Gordon's health I' "Madam, Mr. Stuart-Gordon is still ex- tremely ill, and no hopes are entertained of his recovery"    "Humph I The comfort is, that Louise and her child are his heirs-that is, if the lat- ter should. live after. I am almost sorry now-one can never tell what turns af- fairs are going to take," muttered the lady to herself. "Madam?" "Hold your tongue. I am not talking to you." The mulatto clenched her teeth, "Well-this other story about the woman?" "About Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, madam?" "Yes." "It is all true, madam. Seraph told me so, shaking her fist in my face, in triumph, that you might kill Mr. Louis, but that his loss might be replaced--that an heir would not be wanting to The Isle of Rays." "Well " "I tossed up my head and told her certainly not, for though Mr. Louis might die, Mrs. Louis was-" "Wretch I you did not tell her that a" "Pardon, madam, pardon; but could I stand there and see her triumphing over me ]" "But you told her a lie-a lie-that you are to contradict to-morrow. Do you under- stand me!" asked the lady, fixing her severe eyes sternly upon her attendant. "Madam, I will do so; but there is one thing I should tell you:" "Tell it." "The morning upon which Mrs. Stuart-Gor- don and Mr. Louis encountered yourself and Mrs. Louis upon the hill, in returning from the Dovecote, it seems that Mr. Louis, as well as Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, observed Mrs. Louis's ill looks, and saw her faint; and that from that circumstance, the family'at The Isle of Rays have inferred that Mrs. Louis is grieving her- self to death at separation from her husband. Now, madam, I wished to give Mrs. Louis's delicate appearance another cause. I could not bear to have them think that our young lady ever threw away a thought upon them.  Thus I had two motives for telling the-" "Falsehood!" finished Mrs. Armstrong, with a determined look. "Yes, madam; of course, the falsehood." "And thus I have two motives for compel- i ing Louise to go to this grand ball: first, that they may not flatter themselves that Louise is c breaking her heart. Ha, ha, ha I They will -1 no longer do so when they hear of her dancing 1 at a ball while her husband is dying. -And 1   my second motive is, that the story told by this stupid Kate may be, tacitly contradicted," thought the lady; then raising her voice, she exclaimed-- "Kate." "Well, madam?" "My daughter, as yet, knows nothing of the illness of. Mr. Stuart-Gordon, nor will I have her mind disturbed by it. Therefore, be silent upon that subject, in her pres- ence." "Yes, madam." "To-morrow, contradict that story you told the old gossip; and be sure to tell her that Mrs. Louis is well and cheerful, and will at- tend, as usual, the annual ball at the Prince's school." "Yes, madam; I understand." "You are not to say that Mrs. Louis is ig- norant of Mr. Louis's illness." 6"Oh! no, madam-by no means! of course not." "I think now that you perfectly comprehend me?" "Perfectly, madam." "Kate, I have promised to leave you free. If you will deserve it at my hands, I will leave you comfortably provided for. If you do not merit this -" "Georgy!" "Exactly." In the -early part of this true story, I had occasion to mention a collegiate school at Peakville, called the Prince of Wales Acad- emy, and sometimes, for brevity, the Prince's School. This was a sort of smaller college, consisting of a president, four to six professors, and five or six hundred pupils, collected from all parts of the South. The president and pro- fessors of this Academy were mostly from New England, but the greater part of the pupils were from the Southern States. Such of these professors as were unmarried lived at the Academy, but those who had families occupied private dwellings in the village. Many of the pupils boarded at the Academy, some with the families of the professors, and a few  with private families in the village or neighborhood. The ages of these young men ranged from. fourteen to twenty-five years, and their char- acter as a class ranked high--nay, "a student of the Prince of Wales Academy" was another name for integrity, honor, generosity, gallantry, chivalry, magnanimity--in short, in that neigh- -borhood " a student" was a compendium of all the social and chivalric virtues. In that respect, the Prince of Wales Academy was different-   yes! diametrically opposite to any school or college I ever heard of, before or since. I do not know how it was, but so it was. The first two weeks of every December they held an annual festival, at the close of which the school broke up for the Christmas holidays. This festival, for its varietj of delightful enter- tainments, its gayety, and its continued length, might be called a carnivaL The parents' and guardians of the pupils came even for hundreds of miles to be present on the occasion, and re- mained until the close of the ceremonies. Let this be made known for the credit of hospi- table "Old Virginia," that, wherever the pupils boarded, the parents or guardians were received and entertained during their stay as guests. The village and neighborhood of the Prince of Wales Academy would be as much crowded as a fashionable watering-place at the height of the season, or as Washington city during the long session of Congress. During the first- week of the "carnival,"' (I prefer to borrow that term,) the days were spent in ex- aminations of all the pupils through all their studies. This was a great solemnity, carried on by the professors in the presence of the hundreds assembled in the chapel of the insti- tution. The evenings were spent in exhibi- tions, recitations, declamations, theatricals, &c.; and there was no telling how many enthusi- astic boys became stage-struck, or fired with desires to become orators, actors, or preachers, or how many sensitive girls lost their hearts when gazing upon some handsome young as- pirant for histrionic or oratorical honors, while ,spouting Shakspeare or Sheridan I The second week, the first three days were devoted to the distribution of the premiums, and the last four to public breakfasts, great dinners, suppers, and dancing parties. The grafid ball was always given upon the last day of the festival, and followed by a public breakfast the next morning, after which the company dispersed, the students returning with their friends to spend the holidays, and the people of the neighborhood going quietly home to keep Christmas on their own farms. The season of the annual festival now -approached. It was the 1st of December. Already the village and neighborhood were filling with strangers, and the solemnities of the examination had com- menced. The family at Mont Crystal and at The Isle of Rays had received tickets of invi- tation. Of course, the Stuart-Gordons decided at once not to appear in public at such a time, and under such circumstances. Mrs. Armstrong resolved to confront the   world, as well to mortify the Island family-as to show her haughty defiance of public senti- ment. Mrs. Armstrong signified her wishes to her daughter. At first Louise was surprised and distressed at the proposition, or rather the command, but soon reflecting that she might meet Louis there-that there he had been educated-that there he had always- ap- peared-and that there he would almost certainly be,--Louise cheerfully consented to go. The evening of the ball came. Louise was dressed with great care. She wore a white gauze over a rose-colored satin, with open and falling sleeves. Her fair arms and neck were bare, and adorned with pearl necklace and bracelets. Her hair was arranged in madonna bands, and encircled by a wreath of white roses. White kid gloves and white satin slip- pers completed her toilet. These two delicate colors, rose and white, suited the fair and soft beauty of the young woman, and never had Louise appeared so lovely. Mrs. Armstrong wore a garnet-colored vel- vet-her still rich black hair banded on her temples, and surmounted by a white gauze turban adorned with a bird of Para- dise. At eight o'clock -precisely, they entered the carriage, attended by Kate Jumper, and were driven to the Prince of Wales Acad- emy. The halls, saloons, and lecture-rooms of the Academy were converted into dancing, card, and supper-rooms. The studies of the grave professors were metamorphosed into ladies' and gentlemen's dressing-rooms. The president himself was master of ceremonies, the masters . were managers of the ball, and the most ele- ,gaht of the young men stood in crowds at the doors, and out upon the piazzas, to wait on the young ladies as they were driven up in their carriages. These things belong to the past, they have gone out of fashion along with ruffled shirts, knee breeches, buckles, hooped petticoats, plumes, and farthingales-gone out of fashion, yet not quite. Some of this old-schooli chi- valric gallantry may be found in the interior and older counties of Maryland and Virginia. We digress. It took Mrs. Armstrongs carriage just two hours to reach the Prince's School It was consequently ten o'clock when the carriage drew up before the vast illuminated front of the building. A crowd of carriages filled the court-yard-a crowd of young men waited on   the piazzas-a flood of light blazed from the hundred front windows--and thunders of music shook the air. Mrs. Armstrong's carriage, winding its way among the crowd, pulled up close by the steps of the piazza, immediately in front of the principal entrance. Several young men started forward to open the door and let down the steps; but, on rec- ognizing the carriage, drew back-some with frowning brows and scornful lips-some with flushed cheeks and downcast eyes. Not one advanced even to hand the ladies from the car- riage. The coachman-an unprecedented thing in that neighborhood-had to get down from his seat to assist the ladies in alighting. Arrogant as she was, Mrs. Armstrong's brow crimsoned, as she gave her hand to her coach- man and alighted, to see a crowd of youths standing still, with averted or downcast eyes, any of whom, six months ago, would have felt but too highly honored in rendering her family the slightest attention. Throwing a sweeping glance of scorn over the assemblage, and gath- ering the ample folds of her velvet mantle around her, she threw back her head, and passed on with a haughty and regnant step. Louise dropped her eyes as she appeared at the carriage door. Then a young man ad- vanced from among the crowd, and held out bis hand to assist her in alighting. Louise just raised her eyes an instant to the pale and haggard face, and lightly touched the cold and emaciated hand extended to assist her, as she sprang lightly past, and joined her mother. Then turning her head to look again at the gentleman who had assisted her, she uttered a half-stifled cry, full of bitterest anguish, and fell fainting into the arms of her mo- ther. The coachman sprang forward at Mrs. Arm- strong's call, and receiving Louise from her arms, bore her into the house, followed by the lady, and carried her up stairs into one of the ladies' dressing-rooms. She was laid on the settee. Several ladies-some of them stran- gers from different parts of the State-hurried to her aid; but Mrs. Armstrong coldly de- clined their proffers of assistance, and dis- patched the coachman to hasten the arrival of her own confidential attendant, Kate. The mulatto soon entered, and with her help, Louise soon opened her eyes. "Oh, mamma, was he living or dead?" were 'the first words faltered forth .by the blue lips of Louise. "Collect yourself, my daughter."   "But oh, mamma, that-that spectre was Louis!" "Go down stairs, Kate, and bring me a glass of wine," said the lady, still bathing the head of Louise. i"Oh, mother, to meet Louis so again--again I So changed I did not recognize him at first-  so changed! Oh, mother, when we met him on the hill, and he passed me with a gentle- manly bow-bowing to the pommel of his sad- dle-holding his hat off till he passed me-me, his wife, his own Louise-I thought the spasm of my heart had killed me I But now-but now-to meet him again so unexpectedly; to have him bow and coldlythand me from the carriage-me, his own Louise-for charity, mother, because no one else would do it; to see him looking so ill; to merely touch his hand as I sprang past him-that emaciated hand-which, had I recognized it, I should have covered with tears." "' You are excited, phrenzied, Louise; here, drink some cold water." "How long does it take a heart to break, mother --how long? Oh, it is such a slow- slow-slow death! between the pangs there are so many intervals of ease, or forgetfulness, or idiocy 1" The dressing-room was now quite deserted, the. ladies having all completed their toilets, and gone down into the ball-room. Weeping and talking will generally exhaust a fit of grief, leaving a sort of weary calm- ness. Cold water is a great sedative. Under all these influences, Louise, after a little, be- came quiet. At this moment, Kate entered with a glass of wine. "It will not do," said the lady; " besides, I have changed my mind about giving it to her, for, though wine may raise the spirits of a dull person, it will make- the grief of a sorrowing one too eloquent. No, if you please, bring her a cup of very strong coffee; there is no mis- take in the effects of that." Kate again left the room. MOds. Armstrong bolted the door; and then assisting her daugh- ter to stand up, she arranged the folds of her dress, smoothed her hair, replaced her wreath, and going to one of the dressing-tables, took a pot of rouge left there by one of the ladies, and delicately 'touched the lily cheeks of her daughter. Then she made her sit down and wait for the coffee, while she went herself and unfastened the door. Kate soon after returned with the fragrant stimulant, and noticing her young lady, the unsuspecting woman ex-   claimed, "Why, I do declare she is better, madam. She looks better than I have seen her look for a long time. Her cheeks are as red as roses. Indeed, she is quite beauti- ful 1" Louise drank the coffee-a large cup of very strong coffee-and then rising, took her mo- ther's arm, and they went down stairs. It is a very awkward thing in this country for ladies to enter public assemblies without the escort of gentlemen. Mrs. Armstrong had frequently preferred to go to such places attended only by her servants, but she had always found upon the spot many gentlemen who were proud to render her service. Now, however, remembering the coldness of , her reception at the door, she had many mis- givings that herself -and her daughter would be obliged to enter and pass down the ball- room unattended. That would be mortifying l She had expected to have to defy public senti- ment, but not to encounter public scorn and in- dignity. However, there was no retreat now. She drew the arm of her daughter within her own, elevated her haughty head, and prepared to enter the saloon with a majestic mien. The room was blazing with light, and thundering with music, and filled to suffocation nearly, with splendid company. As she sailed haugh. , tily into the room, Louis Stuart-Gordon ad- vanced from the side of the door where he had apparently waited their entree, and, bowing, took his place on the other side of Louise, walked by her side down the whole length of the room, saw them seated, and then with. a second and a deeper bow, he left them. All this passed without a word said on either hand. Mrs. Armstrong had never deigned to acknowledge his presence, even by a look. Louise had been silent because the eyes of the whole company were on them, and, perhaps, because she waited for Louis to address her, or that she feared her mother, or had lost for the time the power of speech-who could tell? Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter had no sooner seated themselves than the effects of the coffee, assisted by the glare of lights, the sound of music, the brilliant company, began to show itself in the appearance of Louise. Between the effects of the rouge, the stimu- lant, and the scene, her complexion had as- sumed a beautiful, but always delicate glow; her eye, a strange, clear brilliancy; and her expression and manners, a fascinating gayety, that no one who had not known her before could have supposed unnatural; that no one ,who had not witnessed. the events of the last   hour, could have supposed feverish-nearly delirious 8 Her sparkling gayety soon drew around her a circle of young men, who were either not so particular as those upon the piazza, or else having seen her attended by her husband, drew the most favorable inferences. Louise had never been witty before, but now repartee, quick and brilliant as lightning, flashed from her glowing lips. She bewitched the circle around her; still, not one among the youth took her out to dance, until, at last, a young gentleman from a distant county, look- ing at her from across the room, seeing her surrounded, and believing her to be some cel- brated belle-as, unmarried, she woould have been-and wishing a presentation to her, went up to one of the managers and requested an introduction. The manager immediately took him up, and begged leave " to present Captain Fairfax, of Jefferson county, to Mrs. Stuart- Gordon." "Oh 1 a youthful widow," thought the Cap- tain, and, making a graceful bow, he begged the honor of Mrs. Stuart-Gordon's hand in the set that was forming. At a sign from her mother, Louise arose, gave him her hand, and was led to the head of a quadrlle. "My daughter is in high beauty-in fine spirits-greatly admired-she will dance. We will see whether those Island people shall please themselves with the idea that her heart is breaking," exclaimed the lady, in a low voice, as she gazed in triumph upon Louise upon the arm  of Captain Fairfax-Captain Fairfax being the lion of the evening I Soon her triumph was turned to humiliation. Cap- tain Fairfax had led his beautiful partner off to the head of the set, admiring her with en- thusiasm, wondering what the young gentle- men could have been thinking of, not to have secured the honor he was now enjoying, and heartily congratulating himself upon his singu- lar-good fortune. He perceived that all eyes were turned upon himself and partner, he heard all lips whisper about them, and he flushed with gratified vanity, for he verily, thought it was in admiration of his partner and envy of himself It was not until one or two ladies had retired from the set, that was not yet completely formed, that he began to perceive that the unusual buzz was one of sur- prise and disapprobation. Now the light broke on him, and he understood that he had com- mitted himself in some ridiculous way. The perspiration started from his brow. There are some vain men who would rather commit?a crime than a fauz pas. i He was one of them.   Wiping his brow, he turned to his partner and said- "'The room is very close-crowded-Mrs, Stuart-Gordon, had we not better sit down!" Louise raised her' eyes steadily to his face, and said, with'a strange smile, "Oh, sir! I am a very small woman-consume' but little air- fill but little space; is it not strange, then, that as soon as I appear, the atmosphere should grow so close-the set be found so crowded?" Captain Fairfax only replied by a grave bow, as he led her back to her seat. The artificial gayety of Louise was over for that evening. Defeated, mortified, and enraged, Mrs. Arm- strong-soon arose to retire from the saloon. Again Louis Stuart-Gordon suddenly appear- ed, and walking by the side .of Louise, at- tended them from the room, waited for them at the foot of the stairs, and when they came down, cloaked and bonneted, still walking by the side of Louise, he attended them to the carriage. Mrs. Armstrong drew herself up haughtily on one side. Louis handed his wife in, saying, as he pressed her hand- "Do not appear in public again, Louise," and retired. "OhI I will not, I will not!" replied Lou- ise, sinking, sobbing, in one corner of the car- riage. Mrs. Armstrong could have strangled him on the spot. , Repelling his proffer of assist- ance with a haughty gesture, she stepped proudly into her carriage, which was immedi- ately driven'off. The darkness of the winter's night, the darkness of the carriage, prevented Mrs. Armstrong from seeing the face of Louise. She heard her stifled and convulsive sobbing, but, feeling disinclined to converse, she was silent during the whole drive. Arrived at Mont Crystal, they alighted. She drew the arm of Louise through her own, and led her up into their sleeping apartment. It was now between three and four o'clock in the morning. The room was well warmed and lighted, and every way comfortably prepared for their reception. Mrs. Armstrong threw herself into an easy-chair by the fire, and called Kate to assist her in undressing. Without remov- ing any of her clothes, Louise paced in a nervous and excited manner up and down the floor. "Come to the fire and warm yourself, my daughter," said the lady. "No, no; I am not cold." "Undress and retire to rest, then, my 'dear."   iC-M-.LU&AW ; WJiv "I cannot--I cannot  I cannot rest any. where." Mrs. Armstrong now turned around in her chair, and noticed the frightful, pallor of her daughter's countenance as she walked wildly up and down the floor, wringing her hands. "Louise, sit down and compose yourself-I insist upon it." Still Louise, with pallid brow and blood- shot eyes, paced distractedly up and down the floor. "Kate, leave me! I can undress myself. Go and prepare your young lady for bed." Kate left her mistress, and went to Lou- ise. She turned away from her, wildly ex- claiming- "No, no!--no, noI I cannotl - I will neither sleep nor eat, until I have rejoined Louis." "What does she say ., exclaimed Mrs. Arm- strong, rising to her feet, and gazing in aston- ishment upon the strangely excited girl. "What does she say?" "I say, mother!" exclaimed the half-deliri- ous girl, walking rapidly up to the lady, and standing before her with her thin hands vrith-. ing together, and her haggard eyes strained half out of her head-"I say, mother, that this separation is cruel, monstrous, insupportable I It is killing me-that is of no consequence; but it is killing Louis too-that noble Louis, whose only weakness is to love a weak and worthless fool like I am I I say, mother, that Louis is so noble-so generous-so magnani- mousI I say, I love and admire him more and more every day I live I I say, I do not believe one--no, not one of the base calumnies that you have heard of him-and from my heart, I beg his pardon for a moment's doubt of his immaculate honor I I say, mother, that no one can look upon his face, hear his voice, and doubt his probity; and I say, mother, that I must, must rejoin Louis, if indeed he will for- give and receive me again. IMst! mother, do you hear. Oh, I have treated him shame- fully, and he has behaved like an angel to me. Yes, you may curse me, mother, as you have often threatened. You may kill me;, but I will not eat, drink, or sleep, until I have sought the feet of-Louis, and obtained his for- giveness 1' "Oh, she is crazy, frantic," exclaimed the lady, taking the hands of Louise, and forcing her into a chair. Unhook her dress, Kate, and then go and get me some opium. She is nervous, hysterical, delirious."   And so she was. Mrs. Armstrong heard all her raving without alarm, confident in her own confirmed power over her daughter, and klnowing full well that when all this nervous excitement was over,'she would relapse into a state of more complete feebleness than be- fore. And she judged rightly. Louise fell asleep under the influence of the opiate, and slept till a late hour the next day; then she awoke, feeble in body and mind, depressed in spirits. Taking advantage of this mental and physical exhaustion, Mrs. Armstrong sat down by the bedside of Louise, and gravely charged her with discreditable levity at the ball- with gross irreverence to herself, and violent and unlady-like conduct in presence of the servants-repeating all the most objectionable things that poor Louise, in her nervous deli- rium, had said and done. Louise listened without attempting to de- fend herself, and after talking with her for an hour, Mrs. Armstrong left her with her ideas of right and wrong again all confused-her confidence in herself destroyed, and her will and fate altogether in her mother's power. CHAPTER IIL MARGARET. 'Tis dawn-within a curtain'd room, Fill'd to faintness with perfume, A lady lies at point of doom. 'Tis morn-a child hath seen the light; But for the lady, fair and bright, She sorrows in a rayless night. ' Janonymous. SEVERAL months passed away, and winter gave place to spring.' Again the scenery in the neighborhood of Mont Crystal bloomed out in the perfect glory of beauty. Again The Isle of Rays seemed a terrestrial paradise. But still Louise faded in the light of Mont Crystal- still Louis withered in the sunshine of The Isle of Rays. Will it be credited that these two young people, fondly attached to each other, placing implicit faith in each other, uni- ted by the holiest tie, as they had been, were still kept separated by the implacable will of one determined woman   The neighborhood had exhausted conjecture as to the cause of the separation. Some said that Mrs. Armstrong was incensed at the marriage of the General; some said that a prior attachment had been discovered to have existed between Louis and Susan Somerville; some thought it was from   a dissatisfaction about the settlement of the property. As usual, there were a few grains of truth mixed up with much falsehood. At last, however, the facts of the case crept out, and it was generally known that this state of affairs existed by the simple will of the mother- in-law,; and then the whole party on both sides was condemned by public sentiment; for al- though the weight of public censure fell heav- iest upon Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter, yet the family at The Isle of Rays did not escape the charge of weakness. I have often heard the conduct of Louise and Louis both arraigned and judged with great severity, and as I think with gross injustice. The full force of public reprobation fell most heavily of all upon Louise. In this sherwas cruelly wronged. No one considered her extreme youth, her nat- ural weakness of will and gentleness of temper, and the almost omnipotent sway of her mother over her-nor her peculiar education, taught, as she had been, filial obedience as a religion, ready as she was to sacrifice to that filial senti- ment her heart's most natural instincts and warmest affections-nor her physical delicacy of organization, through which she would have perished in any violent conflict. No one con- sidered these things but Louis Stuart-Gordon, who for her peace denied himself the society of his wife, refrained from opposing the influence of Mrs. Armstrong, or importuning Louise- thus exposing himself to the animadversions of a neighborhood incapable of understanding his motives of action. I have heard,Louis called weak, timid. Nothing could be more stupid or unjust than this opinion. Of a high-toned sense of honor, of fine susceptibilities, of warm temperament, Louis Stuart-Gordon yet suffered this long estrangement from a young and lovely wife, to whom'he was fondly attached, and braved the scorn of society, rather than give her pain by a conflict with her unscrupulous mo- ther. Louis was brave to defy and strong to en- dure suffering in his own person and reputation, Louis was not weak or timid, except in giving pain or causing misery to others. No I I have always wished to vindicate the motives of Louis, whose lovely character approached the angelic. Four months had passed away since the ball of the Prince's School, Every letter writ- ten from the Isle of Rays to Mont Crystal had been cast into the fire without being read. As has been said, Louis had at last ceased to importune them with letters. Many times indeed poor Louise had rebelled, as on the evening of the ball; but it was always under nervous excitement, which, subsiding, left her-   weaker and more enslaved than before. They were mere spasms of courage and resolution, ending in apathy-abortive struggles of her feeble will, always to be repented of and atoned for as sin. It was early in April that Louise, then little over seventeen years old, became the mother of a little girl-a fine, hearty child, of firm muscle, brilliant eyes, and strong lungs-who persisted in living, despite all Mrs. Armstrong's diabolical machinations to the contrary. Let us be exactly just. Under existing circum- stances, the expected maternity of her daugh- ter had been a source of great grief and mor- tification to Mrs. Armstrong--so much so that the fact had keen kept a profound secret in the neighborhood, up to the very day that the babe was born. Nevertheless, now, that the infant was laid living on her lap; she no longer wished to smother it. By a law of na- ture, acting unexpectedly upon a heart like hers, she felt the appeal of this helpless and beautiful being, (young babies are all beau- tiful,.male opinion to the contrary notwith- standing,) and Mrs. Armstrong was surprised to find in her own heart a possibility of lov- ing this child. This sentiment, however, in- stead of softening her heart towards its father, only gave additional force to her jealousy of Louis, as she wondered whether he might not wish to deprive her of the care of the babe. The reader has already seen that the maternal instincts were strong as they were selfish in Mrs. Armstrong. "A boon, mamma, a boon!" cried Louise, a few moments after the birth of her child, still pale and palpitating with her recent agony; "a boon, a boon!" "Well, well, my daughter, what is it?" in- quired the lady, disturbed with the fear that Louise was about to make some request of which Louis Stuart-Gordon might be the object. "This, mamma; that I may name this little girl myself." "Certainly, Louise; certainly, my daughter; that is the one thing with which I will not interfere-a mother's control over her own child," said the astute woman, adding mental- ly," she cannot name her Louis, or Henry Cartwright; she will not call her Blitannia, and any other name is indifferent to me. Yes, Louise," she repeated aloud, "that is the one thing in which I will not seek to control you-, your disposal of your own child." "She is all mine, then, mother, all?hine " said Louise, with brightening eyes.   "As much as you are mine, Louise; remem- ber that. The tie between a mother and child is a chain to which all other ties are shreds of cobweb. Ah, you must know it now, Louise.' "I do think so, indeed, mother; and yet--" "There, you have talked enough, Louise; not another w rd-not one, my daughter! you must sleep now." And nipping the threatened controversy in the bud, Mrs. Armstrong drew the embroidered curtains, and retired from the bedside. For the next three days, carriages were com- ing and going to and from Mont Crystal. Al- though the county people severely censured the conduct of the mother -and daughter, and although they had entered into a sort of tacit conspiracy to mortify them at the ball, yet few of the county ladies could resist the attraction of the new-born baby, the heiress of two such vast estates as Mont Crystal and The Isle of Rays, or the temptation of calling upon the childlike mother. Her marriage had been such a splendid triump  as to dazzle the county- her separation so sud/tn and unaccountable as to shock and stu  eighborhood.  Now a babe was unexpectedly born. The doctor had spread the news. Doctors are great gossips; that is one of their methods of curing, especial- ly hypochondriacs. -Now a babe was born] Who would have thought it?-she was so young-it was kept so close. In fine, the coun- ty ladies wished to see how Louise looked, and how Mrs. Armstrong deported herself under all these circumstances; and so for three or four days carriages stood before the gates of Mont Crystal. Like all secluded people, they want- ed a spectacle-a scene; but in this they were disappointed. "Not at home," "Particularly engaged," were the words with which the ma- jority of the visitors were received. A few privileged individuals were admitted to the drawing-room, and received by Mrs. Armstrong But even with these she maintained a cold and reserved manner; and, in reply to their inqui- ries concerning Louise, they were told that Mrs. Stuart-Gordon was still too weak to re- ceive visitors in her apartment. Some certainly sympathized with the youth- ful mother, and called to see her from a better motive than mere curiosity. Their reception, however, was no more favorable than that of less deserving neighbors. It was about a week from the day of her ao couclement that Louise was sitting, propped up with pillows, in a delicate lace cap and a rose-colored wrapper, hear one of the front windows of her chamber. It was the same   large, airy front chamber called the summer room, and was furnished with the same white draperies. The window near which Louise sat was closed, and the muslin curtains were drawn; and near the easy chair of Louise stood the crib of her baby, all draped with white. The young mother's attention was divided between the crib and a little spy-glass she held in her hand, and with which, after drawing aside the cur- tains from the window, she would contemplate The Isle of Rays. It was while she was thus occupied that the door was opened, and "Miss Somerville" was announced. Susan was cloth- ed in deep black, and very pale and thin, yet wearing her habitual expression of profound serenity. She entered and advanced quietly, and taking both the hands of Louise, kissed her with affection. Louise received Susan with a sorrowful tenderness, as she remembered her former injustice. Without speaking, only re- turning her caress, she made room for Susan in the large easy-chair, big enough for both. Miss Somerville took the seat, and again threw her arms around I;ouise, and kissed her affection- ately. Then she inquired- "Where is your mother, Louise!" "Closeted with her overseer." t How long shall she remain there, Louise?" "For two or three hours yet; they are ar- ranging about the crops. But, dear Susan, you have not been to Mont Crystal before since my return. Why was that, Susan ",  "My love, I might return the charge and the question. You have not been at The Crags." "Ah, Susan, I am  not my own .mistress. Besides, I have been so unhappy, dear Susan!" "I know it, my poor girl-I know it; and I should have come to you, but:.that I have been very ill, and my illness left me very feeble; and I have no horse now, Louise, and the ten miles between The Crags and Mont Crystal is too long a walk for me. This is the first time I have attempted it." "Susan I you do not say that you have walked all this distance to see me!" *"Yes, my love," "And you, too, have had troubles, severe sorrows, thatt you do not speak of, dear and generous Susan-strong and courageous Su- san?" As in tacit contradiction of her thoughts, Susan turned a shade paler, and trembled slightly. "And Anna is dead, Susan 8" Susan bowed her head in reply. "   "And poor old George and Harriet, Susan -how do they bear her death t" "Better than they bore her life, or rathe the uncertainty of her future--" "Are they cheerful, then!" "At last-yes, an old couple like them, mar- ried in early youth, living nearly half a cen- tury together, become all in all to each other -but, Louise, you are weeping    Do not  ; weep, Louise," said Susan, pressing her arms around her and kissing her. "No matter 1 Do not mind my tears. There I they are gone. Tell me about Zoe. She was somehow mixed up in all that dreadful busi- ness a" "It was all a mistake, or rather a con- spiracy. Zoe is not a mulatto, never wtas a slave. Brighty knows that; so does Gertrude and Brutus; and they all visit her and receive her freely now." "Then why do they not prove it-why do they not establish it-why do they not punish those who have belied and persecuted her i" "Alas, you do not know  what you say, child! She has been under the strongest cir- cumstantial evidence adjudged to be a slave,. and has been sold, bought, and enfranchised, as such., We know better from conviction, but, we have no means on earth of proving it." "And Brutus, then, cannot marry her!" ( Certainly not, my love, until her true posi-- tion is understood; but Louise, let me say this: to you-let me force it earnestly upon you- - treat Zoe with all the affection that is in your  heart for her-she has a claim upon you and upon me. And, Louise, my love, another favor - -keep what I have said about Zoe to your  own bosom." "I have no secrets from mother," replied'l Louise. Miss Somerville looked troubled for an in- stant, and then her countenance cleared off as., she said to herself---"It is well I told her no. more." "Who is Zoe, then, Susan T" "My dear Louise, I have told you enough to. enlist your respect for Zoe. I dare tell you no, more." "( You will at least inform me how our dear- old teacher is. The dreadful shock drove him. mad for a while, but his madness subsided into a happy dotage." "The schoolmaster is dead:' "Dead I dead I He, too I Alas I every one- can die but me I The maiden and the old. maul Every one but me    Why cannot I. die f" exclaimed Louise, as her pallid features;   contracted violently, and relaxed as she burst into tears. This was one of the spasmodic fits of grief to which she had been subject of late. Susan Somerville had started, looked at her in surprise; then, rising, she took the sleeping babe from the crib, and laid it on her lap. The child awakened, opened its eyes, and looked up. In a moment, the quick emotions of her childish mother changed. Wiping her eyes, she looked down at the babe with a new realization of possession and consolation. She looked in silence a long time, seeming quite lost in the contemplation of her treasure, while Susan stood bending over them and half em- bracing her. At last, taking the hand of Susan Somerville, without lifting her eyes from the babe, she asked- "What do you think of my baby, Susan?" "She is a fine, strong, hearty child." "But whom does she resemble 2" "Not you, Louise, and not Louis. The form of her head, neck, and jaws, express the sign of great strength and determination. She will resemble General Stuart-Gordon and Mrs. Armstrong," replied Susan, looking with great interest on the babe. "What are you going to call her i" "Margaret, after the idolized mother of Louis. Susan, tell Louis when you see him that there is another Margaret Stuart-Gordon. Susan, do you often see Louis?" "Yes, very often. He spends nearly every evening with me at The Crags." "J With you, Susan?" exclaimed the young FWife, while a slight spasm of distress agitated 3her violet-pale face. "Yes, with me," replied  Susan, calmly. '"You know I always was his friend. I am so :still. He needs me in his sorrow, and I will  not fail him 1"  Louise pressed her hand, and said-"But i ,peope,are so censorious, dear Susan; and muder 5 the circumstances- -" "The world will make no mistakes about 1 me," answered Susan, with a gentle dignity. Louise raised her eyes to that pale but an- e , gelic countenance, and acquiesced from  her profoundest soul.        ',    t "Since you have named Louis, will you per- c mit me to ask you some questions about him!" n "Yes, yes; oh, yes I Heaven bless you for coming, since you may be said to come from s Louis. Go on."               S "Have you ever received any letters from a Louis since your, residence here 8     a "INot one."               o   St  "Yet he wrote to you many, many times, until he abandoned it in despair of getting an ,f answer. Have you never Written to him!" "Oh, yes; many, many letters." "r  Yet he never received one I It is plain, g Louise, that all your letters have been inter- p. cepted." Id "Oh I who could have been so cruel?" is  "It is not for nme to say, Louise; it is a r dreadful thing. Let Providence reveal it in r his own time and method!" B  "Oh! Susan, I am so glad you are hIere to e tell me this. God bless you for coming I Come e again, Susan I come often I and since you see - Louis, tell him, Susan, that I love him still, and always-that I pray for him    day and a night-that I thank him devoutly for his for- bearance towards my mother-that I admire him more than ever-that I would die for him -but that I cannot break my mother's heart, or dare her curse I Tell him I have named my 2 child after his mother. Tell him that I love this child more than life.  Yet, assure him, I that if he desires it, I will press my last kiss on this infant's lips, and send her to him, if her presence would comfort him.  Tell him, for my own part, I feel weak, and altogether unworthy of his thoughts; that I only wish to die, as the only means of extrication from  this trouble. To  die, that be may be  happy. Grief for the dead is less severe than sorrow for the living I' * "Louise I Louise! you will perish in this conflict between the prejudices and perversions of your strange education and the natural and good qualities of your heart. Yes, Louise I that is an internal conflict worse than the con- troversy between your mother and your hus- band's family; and it is a suffering from which even the angelic goodness of your Louis cannot save you. You are not doing well, Louise, and your heart tells you so, for you call yourself 'weak   and unworthy./ Resolve-return to Louis. I will bear any message to him. I will bring him here to-morrow-to-night." "No, no I no, no I not for a thousand worlds," exclaimed the imbecile girl, turning very pale. "Do you know my mother, that you propose that?   Oh the scene would, be frightful. I can bear any thing else-but I cannot dare a mother's curse." Louise suddenly started, and suppressed a scream-Mrs. Armstrong stood before them   I She had entered unperceived, while they were absorbed in conversation.  Susan Somerville arose and courtesied, without offering her hand, or reseating herself. Mrs. Armstrong  bowed   coldly, and then addressing herself to Louise, asked her how long she had been sitting up 8 "Nearly two hours, but I am not tired, mam- ma " pleaded the daughter. ' Nevertheless you must lie down 1" decided the lady, lifting the baby from her lap, and replacing it in the crib. "Miss Somerville I am sure, will excuse us:'" "I am about to take my leave, madam," re. plied Susan. "Mother, Susan walked here," said Louise. "Then, Miss Somerville, you must either give us the pleasure of your company all night, or permit me to send you homne in the carriage," said Mrs. Armstrong, who, with all her deviltries, was a Virginian lady still; and, as such, a loyal observer of all the laws of hos- pitality. Miss Somerville thanked Mrs. Armstrong, but informed her that she was engaged to spend the afternoon and night at the Dove- cote with Zoe. Susan then embraced Louise, and took her leave. Mrs. Armstrong had ap- parently forgotten her intention of putting Louise to bed, for she wheeled an easy-chair close to the crib near her daughter, and sat down, saying- "I am constrained to declare that Miss Su- san Somerville is far too independent for her sex and years. To think of her openly visit- ing the Dovecote! If she continues to do that, the doors of Mont Crystal shall be closed against her." "Oh, but mamma," said Louise, "Zoe is not what she has been represented to be. Susan, and the Lions, and even Brighty, have found out something-a conspiracy, they say--but Susan did not tell me what" it was-but mo- ther 1 mother I good heavens, mother I What is the matter!" Mrs. Armstrong had started from her chair, grown ghastly pale, sunk back again, with her face crimson, and the veins in her forehead and temples full and distended. "Oh, my Heaven I mother-mother 1" ex- claimed Louise, starting forward; "Kate- Kate! here-here 1   help I my mother is dying 1" and she ran and pulled the bell vio- lently. Several servants ran in. Mrs. Arm- strong was placed upon the bed. The physi- cian was sent for. Ice was placed at her head, and bottles of hot water at her feet. Louise was frightened and helpless as usual. "Do not be alarmed, madam," said Kate Jumper, who seemed to understand the case -" this is only a rush of blood to the head; she will be better soon." And, in fact, before   the arrival of the physician, Mrs. Armstrong was relieved. But now came the strange part of it. Aa soon as her senses had quite returned, she dis- missed all her attendants from the room; -and,' regardless of her own exhaustion, or her daughter's feebleness, she summoned Louise to her bedside, and made her repeat all-the conversation of which Zoe had been the sub- ject. Then partially reassured, she dismissed her to bed, and recalled her attendants, by means of the bell whose handle was in her reach. The next morning, Mrs. Armstrong was up early, and having seen Louise made comfort-. able at her favorite window, with her babe beside her in the crib, and having given or- ders that no one should be admitted during her absence, Mrs. Armstrong entered her car- riage, and drove out. She was gone all day. She returned haggard and wretched in the evening. The next day she was closeted with a lawyer, a stranger, and her overseer; and at the close of the conference, looked better satisfied. The third day, letters were written, and packets sent off to the post-office. The remainder of the week there was a great bustle all through the house. The 1st of May, a neighbor passing by Mont Crystal, found the house shut up. Inquiring oa a man who was, superintending the working of a contiguous field, he was told that the family had removed quite suddenly--so suddenly, that no one had suspected their intention un- til they had gone--no one knew whither-not even their relatives at The Isle of Rays. That the house was closed, and the lands leased- and the negroes hired to the lessee; that he himself was the overseer appointed by the planter who had taken the Mont Crystal estate. CHAPTER   IV. "TTLE  BRIGHTY. An airy, pleasant chamber, with the rose vines Woven around the casement. JMiss Mitford. Ayouthful mother to her infant smiling, Who with spread arms and dancing feet, And cooing voice, returns an answer sweet. Miss Baillie. I AM about to take you into a pleasant room, and into pleasant company. If there was one room more delightful than all the others at The   Isle of Rays, it was Brighty's summer room. It was on the ground-floor, and opened in front by glass doors upon the piazza, and at the back by similar doors into the garden of roses; in fact, it was the room on the left, correspond- ing to the pleasant breakfast-room on the right -the garden of roses running the whole length of the back of the house. Brighty had chosen this room for her midsummer boudoir, for the sake of her two passions-the music of birds, and the fragrance of flowers, borne upon the summer breeze into the chamber.   These could :not be had in an up-stairs room, for Brighty could not delight in the songs of birds -imprisoned in cages, or the perfume of flowers dying in vases. To give her pleasure there must' be freedom and gladness in the bird, and life and freshness in the breath of the flowers. Brighty said she would always feel a quaver of sadness in the merriest trills of a caged bird, and a scent of faintness in the richest odor of a plucked flower. But perhaps Brighty was fanciful-which, as mistress of The Isle of Rays, and as the darling wife and spoiled child of General Stuart-Gordon, she had a right to be. Well! this summer room, with its vine-shaded piazza in front, and its garden at back, and the cheery trill of birds and the dewy fragrance of flowers wafted through it--this beautiful room! with the carpet on the floor, and the paper on the walls, both of the same pattern, namely, a white ground, with red roses running over it, with its white mus- lin over pink curtains, with its lounge and chair covers of fine pink and white Marseilles quilt-work-this cheerful room, with its bevy of gay girls gathered around one, leaping, crow- ing, laughing baby--that is, to wit, upon the fifteenth of July, in the year -- . As might have been expected, both from her position and her personal accomplishments, Mrs. General Stuart-Gordon became the leader of the ton in the county. The Isle of Rays became the seat of elegant hospitality. And k never had the black satin vest of the stout  General required greater breadth for expansion  of the chest, than when seated at the foot of i his own  table, doing the honors of a dinner- I party, at which his young and beautiful wife t presided with equal dignity and grace,   a And   Britannia enjoyed her position im- r mensely, I  assure you.  Yes, I am  afraid I above every thing else, until one fine summer's I morning, while the sun was shining and the t dew glistening--while the flowers were bloom- e ing and the birds singing-little Brighty ar- b rived, and Britannia had a  revelation of an- 1   i. other heaven than that of marble palaces, silver t plate, and priceless jewels; and the gates k through which that heaven was visible were a the azure gauze curtains of a rosewood crib. You know that Britannia, even in her cold, t polished girlhood, while eschewing love with Iyouthful scorn, admitted that shoe did love whom she pitied or protected--judge, there- L fore, how she loved this bright new claimant for her pity and protection. "And I am very glad she is a little girl," thought Britannia; "because this dear General has a son already: besides which, he has such a partiality for girls of all ages, from infancy to old maidenhood." So the General had-especially since his two Brighties-his damask rose and bud-had rejuvenated him.  So the General had--a grandfatherly fondness for baby girls, a fa- therly fondness for young girls, and a brotherly fondness for old girls. Oh! it was no wonder the General required such a very large black satin vest-he had such a large heart under it. And, as for the girls-babies, maidens, and spinsters-they all loved the General, as kit- tens love hearth-warmth, or as flowers love sunshine. But the fifteenth of July, in the rose-colored, rose-scented summer-room at The Isle of Rays, were assembled Britannia, Susan Somerville, Gertrude, and Zoe. Miss Somerville, at the earnest and repeated solicitation of General and Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, had been persuaded to spend some weeks of the midsummer at The Isle of Rays. Zoe was engaged to assist in making up an infinite number of summer garments there, and Gertrude, being for the time deprived of visiting The Crags or the Dovecote, favored The Isle of Rays with an unusual portion of her time. And now these three girls were all down on the rose-figured carpet, contending for the fa- vor of-whom a A little, wilful, bright-eyed sprite of fourteen months' old, who would go to one, and  wouldn't go to another, just as its capricious will dictated. Britannia was pass- ing in and out, engaged in some pleasant household duty, assumed more from choice than necessity. The General was walking about the room, riding-whip and hat in hand, now pausing to smile at the group around the babe, now jestingly wishing that he had a magic chair in which to enchant Britannia, so that she should not make him nervous by fidg- eting about so; in fine, quite unable to take himself away from the charming room and its lovely inmates.   Presently Britannia entered, preceded by old Seraphina-or Serry as the girls called her -bearing a basket of plums, peaches, and grapes; and now the General laid down his riding-whip and hat, and drew off his gloves, calling through the vine-shaded window to Apollo, who stood before the door with two horses saddled, one for his master, and one for himself, to put up the horses, for he should not ride to-day, as it was growing late and getting warm. And then the General threw himself upon one of the settees, and Brighty turned sharply round, and, smiling gayly, clasped his rough chin in her hand, by way of a saucy welcome; and Zoe, bouncing up, ran up stairs, and returned with his blue-and-white chintz dressing-gown, and his sheepskin slippers, and then she, took his coat and gaiters, and carried them away. Of course, little Zoe got a caress for her pains, and then she sat down and se- lected the ripest grapes for the baby, which she held upon her lap, while the others ate fruit. Little Zoe had always a need of some one to worship and wait on, and since the death of her adopted father, and the estrange- ment of Louise, she had attached herself, lichen-like, to Britannia and the General. Zoe sat there with little Brighty, carefully peeling ripe grapes for her, until old Serry had carried away the basket and re- turned. Wanting an excuse to remain in the room; old Serry went up to Zoe, and saying, "Gim me de chile, Miss Zoe," took the little one away, and sat down with her near the window. "Where is Louis?" asked Gertrude, paring her peach, "I never see any thing of him lately." "I have not seen him since breakfast," re- plied the General.       "I hab," said Serry, putting in her word with the freedom of an old Virginia domestic, "I hab seen Marse Louis dis mornin'. You see, Miss Drertrude, Marse Louis, he never let me put Miss Louise's rooms to rights--never. Won't let me 'sturb a single thing no more an nothin' at all. Dat room is a scan'lous sight. Dere's Miss Louise's workstan' jes' as she done left it-drawers all out, things all strowed all over de top, and even so much as her needle a sticken' in her sowin', jes' as she got up an' left it de day she went home with her ma^. Oh! my blessed Heavenly Marser, don't I pray for dat 'oman's 'version-three times down on my knees every day, reg'lar as the day comes. 'Taint no use dough-not a single bit. I goin' to stop of it; I goin' to stop a botherin' my *-           Heavenly Marser about her,'cause you see, Miss Drertrude, and young ladies, it aint no sort o' use. Marser can't do nothing 't all wid her; he done let her alone; he done gib her right up to de debbil." "But where is Louis, Aunty8" reminded Gertrude. "Oh, yes-where is Louis t" asked Zoe. "Well, I gwine tell you. I see Miss Louise's rooms open, an' I thinks now I take dis chance, and go in dere and clean up. Bless you, I aint done gone in dere more an' a year, so I gone in, an', as I tell you, dere work all strownover floor, dere wreaf of roses hung over de glass all done gone, 'cept the stems and de string, an' leaves all dry as powder all strow over de toilet cloff-an' Miss -Louise's loose wrapper, all lying over de side ob de bed--and Mr. Louis, he kneelin' down by de side ob de bed, all white, wid his curls tangled,and his face on de wrapper, and his arms stretched up over it. So I jes' looks in, an' I saw dat, an' I jes' pulls de door too softly, an' comes away-I was t hurted to the heart-and soon after I sees him get on his horse and ride away. Dere I dere's where he been all day a takin' on in Miss Louise's room. Now he done, lock it up agin, and gone away. Ah, Lord, I like to see the 'oman as would part me from my ole Apple. Dere, dere! dere, dere 1 its Aunty aint forgot de baby-its Aunty will peel another peach for de baby bunton!"And the old lady gave her attention to her little charge. "But do you never hear from Louise?" ques- tioned Gertrude of Britannia. "Never. We have discovered that they- are living at New Orleans, in great splendor; that they are very much in society, and give large parties-" "Does Louis never write I' "2Never. All his first letters seemed drop- ped into a bottomless well, for any response they called forth--" "Nothing-will be done with Mrs. Armstrong until I take her in hand, and I shall do it even- tually,'" said Gertrude, with a determined look. "There is no particular hurry, Louis and Lou- ise are young enough yet-dear me, yes.' Louis is but twenty, and Louise but eighteen. Bide a bit, Mrs. Armstrong." "Ah, Lor' I I wonders, I does, ef she neb- ber think of her end-when that shetfup-eye come! Don't she memorize dat Louis is got a mother up in Heaven-an angel always a standin' in de presence of the Lord, who can say to him, 'Lord, look down through de slopes of space on earth, and see what is goin'   on there; see how a wicked 'oman is a sarvin' out my son, dat I love.' I wonder she don't. think ob dat. I wonder she aint afeard to in- jure a youth as has a mother standin' in -de presence ob de Lord, night and day. Good- ness! here comes Marse Louis nowl" ex- claimed the old woman, as horses' feet clam- bered up to the door; and Louis, throwing himself from the saddle, hurried, pale, and agitated, into the room. All were struck with surprise and dismay at his extreme perturbation. He sank into a ehair, grasping in his hand a paper. Susan Somerville poured out a glass of water, and handed him; he drank it-pressed the kind hand that offered it, as he thanked her with his'eyes. Then turning to his father, he said, "I wish to speak with you, sir;" and, rising, he left the room. General Stuart-Gordon followed. When they had reached the study, and were both seated- "There, sir," said Louis, "there are the hopes of a life destroyed." And he laid the Virginian Republican upon the table between them, pointing out a para- graph. It was under the head of "Proceed- ings of the Legislature," and was as follows:- "Hon. J. C. La Compte, from the Commit- tee of the Judiciary, reported a bill for the divorce of Louis Stuart-Gordon from his wife, Louise H. A. Stuart-Gordon, which was read, and laid upon the table." "There was some foul work here, Louis! Upon what pretence could this have been claimed-upon what trumped-up story-what perjury i" "Heaven knows, sir. I only see the con- duct of-of- Louise, in this. I only feel that I have grossly deceived myself in my estimate of- that young lady." "Exactly! Precisely I Compare her with Miss Somerville, Zoe, Gertrude--with my own queenly lady-with any right-minded, right-headed girl or woman-and then judge her." Louis was very pale and thin, and he seemed drooping with a general lassitude as he leaned back in the high-backed- chair, his paleness thrown out into ghastly relief by the black leather of its covering and the black cloth of his dress; and his very voice, when he spoke, seemed faint and broken, from physical de- bility or mental despairs General Stuart-Gor- don looked at him for some moments -in silence. Then he said-- "You are a Stuart; Louis-a genuine Stu-   art. It is curious to observe in you the very same traits of character, with the same cast of features, that ruined your ancestors-the same tenderness of heart, the same infirmity of purpose, the same infatuated attachment to the one object of idolatry, whatever that may be. Oh, Louis t be a man-rouse yourself Zounds, boy! it is a very lackadaisical thing to pine arvay and die of a broken heart for any woman, even your fugitive wife."' Louis did not reply. There was a weight upon his bosom, a general sinking, that made it difficult to sustain his part of the conver- sation. "Listen to me now, Louis. I think I am rather healthier in mind and body than yourself. I will volunteer my counsel; you will accept it or not, as you see fit. First, then, you know, of course, that Louise can never obtain a divorce, however much she may wish it, since nothing can be brought against you.-since she herself is the faithless party, while you are guiltless towards her. It is only the blameless and the injured party with whom remains the privi- lege of divorcing; and certainly in justice it should be so. Therefore, no power on earth can free Louise from her matrimonial bond- age, but your own. Are you heeding me, Louis?" "Yes, sir, I listen." "My advice to you, then, is, to write to Louise."        l "Of what avail were that, sir? They take no notice of my letters. I do not know that they even open and read them." "Ah! you may be very sure that Mrs. Arm- strong reads every letter you address to Louise, or to herself, though I presume that Louise never sees them, and that Mrs. Arm- strong would certainly not lose,the advantage over us of gaining a knowledge of our senti- ments and wishes, by reading our letters, while she studiously avoids revealing or committing herself by replying to any one of them, Nev- ertheless, I am sure she would reply to the letter that I advise you to write. It is this: write to Louise, and- ask her if her happiness is involved in this matter of freedom from her nmarriage bonds; tell her that, if so, you, in whom, from her- faithlessness,-'rests the only power-that you will free her, by an applica- tion for a divorce to the Legislature. They will reply to that letter!" "A letter which I shall not write, my father l" answered Louis, rising and walking the floor. "Why not, Louis 8"   "Oh, sir I the whole matter is repugnant, repulsive." "I know that you are morbidly delicate- fastidious even to a fault; but no odium can attach to your divorce that does not now at- tach to your separation." "Sir, it is not altogether that. There are higher, broader, deeper motives of conduct than general odium or approbation, or indi- vidual happiness or misery. Marriage is the most sacred tie on earth. The peace of fami- lies, the social welfare of the whole commu- nity, depend upon its being held so. If Louise and myself have contracted an ill-judged mar- riage, we must suffer for it, and bear the pen- alty. Better that individuals should suffer, than tlat the general tone of moral sentiment should be lowered. Oh! observe, sir I in mod- ern times, in Christian countries, divorces were so rare as to be almost unheard of, until two men in the power of place set a very bale- ful example, that spread like a slow pestilence over their respective countries. Since the divorce of the Empress Josephine by Napoleon, and that of Queen Caroline by George it., divorces have become far more common. I trace it to the influence of that high example I My father, we exert in -- county an influ- ence quite as strong, if not as extensive, as that of the illustrious persons I have named, and, believe me, it is dangerous to introduce a re- spectable precedent for an act of questionable morality in a neighborhood. Still--still-I have not considered this very deeply, the sug- gestion is new. Perhaps, were the happiness of Louise, really involved, I might be induced to set aside all objections not positively found- ed on pure right, were it not for one thing- one fetter that binds us together, and must never, never be broken but by death 1" "And that?" "Is our daughter." "Louis! nonsense I The little one is in the hands of her mother and,grandmother, who it is to be presumed love her fondly. She is sure of the best education that wealth can procure for her, and will be, besides, the heiress of a large fortune. And, Louis, more than all, by the time you are thirty five or six years, when you will be still young, though not youthful, shte, your daughter,- will be grown, and most probably married and settled in life. Mrs. Armstrong is a great hand at early marriages, as you know to your cost-and you at thirty- six will find yourself unsettled as now, Louis. No weakness, if you have any regard for me. Observe I you married this child of sixteen,   lived with her for five or six months, when she leftgyo L She became a mother, and took away her child to a distant city, and has absented herself for nearly two years, refusing to hold communication with you or your family, even by letter. Poohl pooh I Your marriage was a farce." "Not so, sir 1" said Louis, with a sort of bit- ter smile, since we. have a daughter who is heiress to two immense estates that comprise more than one-half of   county, and are valued at nearly two millions 1" "Hum I you might marry again and have a son, a Prince of Wales might disinherit the Princess Royal. Zounds, sir I this girl has abandoned you with the levity of a mistress. Treat the case even so. Divorce her; settle property on her; and forget her-as a paid-off mistress." The pallid brow of Louis Stuart-Gordon flushed to crimson, as he replied-' "Enough, sir I lrwill not. The honor of my wife and daughter are dearer to me than my own ;" and, lifting his hat from the table, he bowed and left the roomt "I wonder if I could not get a writ of lunacy out against that young gentleman 1" exclaimed General Stuart-Gordon, testily, as he arose to rejoin the ladies. A month passed away-a month during which nothing more was heard of the Mont Crystal family.. Then General Stuart-Gordon, accompanied by all his family and Miss Somer- ville, went to spend August and September ate: the sea-shore. They returned to The Isle of Rays about the middle of October. Gorgeously beautiful was The Isle of Rays in early autumn. The scarlet foliage of the oak, the golden leaves of the hickory, the rich purple hue of the dogwood-tree, and the bright dark green of the pine and cedar, all growing tall from the Isle, made it resemble from a distance a large and splendid bouquet, set in the, clear. waters. The family returned in renewed life to their gorgeous home. Even Louis, by the healthful ministrations of nature, and the soothing companionship of his - good angel, Susan, was visibly improved in health and spirits. It was late in' the afternoon of a glorious day, just cool enough to make the prospect of{ home, a blazing fire, and a warm supper, highly inviting; and twilight was gathering 'duskily on, giving the neighborhood a -sweet, dim, mysterious obscurity;, and the wind was rising in the northwest, With that shrill, hollow in norf   blast so pleasant to hear in the early winter, when one has a snug fireside, and new warm- hued autumn dresses, waiting to be enjoyed- when the large family carriage stopped before the portico at the Island mansion. Lights were glowing through the crimson- curtained windows of the drawing-room; and as the carriage approached, a perfect flood of radiance poured from the hall-doors, that were flung wide open by Gertrude Lion, who bounded out to welcome the new-comers, as they descended from the carriage. Sihe caught Britannia in her arms first. "Oh! Briglty, you are so handsome! your cheek is like a carnation rose! And you, too, Susan, you are blooming like a peach-blossom! And Lbuis!" roared the Amazon, breaking into a loud laugh, "I vow and declare--how Louis does grow-if he is not almost a man. And you, General," exclaimed she, starting back, and clapping her hands--" you, General! drums and fifes I steeds and spurs! how grand-how sublime-how .heavy and pompous you look! Oh I General Stuart-Gordon, shake hands with me, that I may catch some of the glorification, as school-children catch the-" Here General Stuart-Gordon interrupted her, by starting forward and offering a warm re- sponse to this saucy salutation. But the beat- tiful giantess arrested him by one strong grip of the shoulder, and held him with one hand, while she lifted the other, and raising her snowy finger, shook it admonishingly at him, as she said, with a queer mixture of fun and solemnity- "N-n-o-you-don't I I'm not Zoe, nor Louise. My lips are not as common as a bar- ber's chair I Every body has their pet pride. You are proud of your military fame--of a name that will blaze down the centuries, il- luminating the history of our country. Bri- tannia is proud of herself-Britannia I Mrs. Armstrong is proud of her pride. I also am proud." ("It must be of your incredible strength, my audacious beauty!" "It is this-that my lips have never been stained by a falsehood, or touched by a kiss! No, never, even in my loving childhood; and that which made the- sorrow of the child, makes the glory of the woman I There; I've made my speech; and now you'll understand, sir, that if in your exceeding great affection- ateness, you were to deprive me of that glory -there'd be a row 1" And the Amazon relaxed her hold, gathered up her falling torrent of golden hair, and fas-   tening it, stepped back to let them pass to the house. General Stuart-Gordon laughed heart- ily, as he drew the arm of Britannia through his own, and walked into the house. Louis followed, with Susan on one arm, and leading little Brighty by the other hand. Gertrude shook hands with the coachman, patted the horses' heads-talked to them-a good supper and a good rubbing down-and then sprung with three bounds into the house. The trav- ellers had retired to their rooms, to change their dresses. Zoe, after having welcomed the party, had gone into the wainscoted parlor to await them, This room was the very perfection of com- fort. The dark and polished oak walls, the crimson carpet, curtains, and chair covers, and the blazing hickory fire, all imparted a glow- ing and genial warmth. The tea-table was set, and the wax candles on the mantelpiece shone down upon the dazzling white damask-cloth and the glittering silver tea-service. Zoe was tripping about, receiving dishes from the waiter as he brought them in, and arranging them on the table. At last, all was ready, and Zoe rung a peal of bells. Soon Britannia and Susan entered, looking charmingly in their first fall dresses-Susan in a dark slate-color- ed silk, and Britannia in a rich purple satin. They were attended by the General and Louis. Never was a more genial and, cheerful com- pany assembled around a social tea-table in a comfortable parlor. Even Louis glanced and smiled and talked-and the ghost of Mrs. Armstrong and her victim child was not suf- fered to intrude, for that one evening at least. "Now think of that dear little girl, taking it into her gentle heart to come over here to pre- pare for us, and welcome us home!" exclaimed the General, looking with affection at Zoe. "How came you to think of it, darling?" in- quired Britannia. "Why-because it is so dismal, coming home to a cold, dark house, with no one but the ser- vants, though they are warm-hearted poor creatures, to welcome you. Coming home should be a festival; and so I told Gertrude that we would come over here and make some cakes and jellies, and have things bright and nice, and give you afamily-welcome. Besides, to tell you the truth, I was pining for a little extra housekeeping flourishes. I was dying to make jellies and cakes. Gertrude, though she hates every thing of the kind, indulges me in every thing; so dear Gertrude came over here with me, to keep me in countenance." The evening passed in gay conversation.   Gertrude and Zoe had a million of questions, to ask, and a million of items of neighborhood news to relate. Nevertheless, as the ladies were somewhat fatigued, they retired early. Then General Stuart-Gordon and Louis sent for the mail-bag, which was emptied on the table between them. There were a number of business letters of various dates within the week past, but these were soon thrust aside, when one, directed in the hand of Mrs. Arm- strong to Louis Stuart-'Gordon, and bearing a black seal, caught their eyes. Louis seized and tore this letter open with a trembling hand. It wns from Mrs. Armstrong, and read as follows:- "RICHMOND, September 15, 18-. "MR. Louis STUART-GORDON: It becomes my painful duty to break the long silence main- tained heretofore between us, by announcing to you the demise of your infant daughter, Margaret, who died of scarlet fever, after an illness of six days, and upon the 12th instant. "I presume any offers of condolence on my part would- be a work of supererogation. You will not probably be inconsolable for the loss of a child, after whose welfare you have never once inquired-" "Never once inquired!" interrupted .Gen- eral Stuart-Gordon indignantly. "Why, was ever such a consummate piece of hypocrisy as that? when she knows she has received let- ters monthly, weekly, sometimes daily, from you. But I see I she is cautious not to com- mit herself. Go on, Louis." Louis passed his hand once or twice over Mis brow, and re- sumed the perusal of the letter. "The last tie that binds you to my unhappy child is thus cut in twain.,. You can now have no excuse for retaining a claim upon the hand of one whose peace depends upon your fieeing her. You surely cannot value the pos- session of one whom you have never written to-" "She actually wishes to make us believe that she has received none of our letters!" again interrupted the General. "Read on, Louis." Louis finished thei letter, the remainder being a consummate piece of eloquence, by which, without descending from her pride, she artfully appealed, now to his disinterested love, now to his chivalric devotion, and all to one end-what she called the emancipation of her heart-broken child. "Now, then, what do you -intend to do, Louis f"   "My daughter is gone 1"Louis buried his face in his hands for a few moments, and then' rising, said-"Yes, I will write to this poor sorrowing young mother I I will write to her, and ascertain if I can by any means promote her happiness"--and, excusing himself, he re- tired to his own apartment, where he spent the night in writing a long, passionate, and eloquent letter to his wife, expressing his earn- est sympathy, his deep affection, his infinite patience, his willingness still to wait, and hope for their future reunion-his resolution to renounce that hope, if her peace of mind de- manded the sacrifice. He closed by beseech- ing her to reflect deliberately, prayerfully, before she decided. This letter was mailed the next morning. The news of the death of the little girl was. announced the next morning after breakfast. It threw a gloom over the heretofore merry family party. Britannia clasped her own child with tremulous affection close to her bosom, as she wept in pity of Louise. Susan Somer- ville wished to return home, but Gfeneral Stu- art-Gordon would upon no account hear of it. "You must not leave Louis now, my dear young lady. You alone, of all the world, un- derstand and know how to console Louis. He loves you as his twin sister; do not leave him just now," he said, "-and you shall never leave him if I can prevent it," he resolved. Miss Somerville was thus constrained to re- main. Zoe also remained to make up the mourning; but Gertrude, who had a mortal repugnance to grave faces and bombazine dresses, fled from a spot where she felt un- happy without being able to alleviate the un- happiness of others.      !1 Louis had scarcely expected an answer to his letter for 'a week or two. he was sur- prised to receive a reply by return mail. It was from Mrs.- Armstrong, stating that she wrote at the request of her daughter, who was too ill to write herself. The letter as- sured Mr. Stuart-Gordon that the happiness- nay, the very life of Louise, depended upon her deliverance from her matrimonial ties. A single line at the bottom of the letter was in the hand of Louise, though the letters were nearly illegible, looking as though they were written with a tremulous hand. This was the line:-  "Yes, Louis, my happiness, my repose, de- pends upon your complying with the request contained in this letter. v:"LoUs E STUAT- GODON."   "It is done," exclaimed Louis, growing deadly pale. The Legislature met in December. Among the first petitions presented was that of Louis Stuart-Gordon. His case was so well known -had excited so much general-sympathy, that the divorce that had been indignantly refused to the petition of Louise, was at once granted to the application of Louis. The bill passed without a dissenting voice. It was Christmas at The Isle of Rays, and all the neighborhood was assembled there to spend the holidays. It was the' day after Christmas, at night, that a large party were gathered together in the drawing-room, when Mr. Turner, the solicitor of Louis, was an- nounced. Louis immediately retired with him to the library, where the solicitor laid before him a copy of the act dissolving his marriage. Prepared as he had been for this-the an- nouncement-the printed bill before him-like the sight of the fabled Gorgon, seemed turn- ing him to stone. He gazed, without reading, for the letters swam before him. All had seemed unreal till how. He had seemed to have lived in a dream till now. Now the ter- rible, the strange reality, that Louise, his be- loved wife-Louise, his own from infancy up, still loving, was nothing to him--swam in upon his brain with a force of conviction that again overpowered his delicate organization, -and, with a heart-bursting groan, Louis fell forward upon his face. A long and severe spell of ill- ness followed the events of this evening. Miss Somerville remained and nursed him. :She alone, of all the family, possessed the power of soothing him. Even in his wildest delirium, his frenzy was best controlled by the gentle voice and soft hand of Susan. He could not bear to miss that gentle sedative tone and touch. He would lie for hours quiet, with the hand of Susan on his brow; but if she left him for an hour, to take needful rest or food, Louis Would; with the thoughtlessness or selfishness of illness, grow restive, and fret himself into a fever. In truth, the gentle and considerate Louis Stuart-Gordon was thoughtlessly cruel but to one being on eart--to the one who loved him most strongly, purely, and disinterestedly, of all the world. How many spoiled children, old and young, resemble Louis in that particu- lar. With every effort Miss Somerville would make to return to The Crags, Louis would suf- fer a relapse. Poor Susan I She was not his. happiness-only his comforter; not his health   - -only his nurse; not his pleasure-only the anodyne of his pain. Yet not now, as former- a ly, did the life she gave Louis depart from her s own soul. Susan was calm, strong, and mis- a tress of herself now. Her love was now so t high and pure that she could have resigned I him without a pang to any other more beloved I woman. CHAPTER V. THE TRAVELLERS. "She shall go east, she shall go west, To seek for that she shall not find- A heart at peace with its own thoughts, A quiet and contented imind." Landon. MRS. ARMSTRONG, from the time of her leav- ing Mont Crystal, seemed possessed with a per- fect furore for travelling. She who, until near her fortieth year, had lived entirely in one sumptuous but retired home, now with the strange restlessness of remorse, or fear, or both, wandered from city to city, with a troop of attendants, equal in number to a queen's ret- inue. Only she avoided the Northern cities, to which she could not carry her slaves. Mrs. Armstrong abhorred the attendance of any one over whom she did not possess absolute control. Her winters were passed at New Orleans,- Charleston, (South Carolina,) Washington City, or Richmond, and her summers at the Capes, the various Sulphur Springs of Virginia, or at other fashionable Southern watering-places. And everywhere, the majestic grace of the mother, and the fragile beauty of the daughter, attracted great attention. It was in February of the first winter of their wanderings, that they found themselves in a suite of apartments in the most fashionable hotel in Washington. It was the long session of Congress, and the city was very full of strangers. Mrs. Arm- strong had her rooms fitted up with ostenta- tious magnificence, and soon found herself and her daughter "the cynosure of neighboring eyes." Mrs. Stuart-Gordon was supposed to be a wealthy young widow. Louise excited a very general interest; her extreme-youth, her fragile beauty, her deep melancholy and ha- bitual absence of mind, were an inexhaustible subject of surprise and commiseration. In the deep blue eyes of Louise brooded an eternal sorrow; the lids seemed heavy with suspended tears that yet never felL, This was of course supposed to be the grief of a youthful widow,   mourning for the premature loss of her husband. And without committing herself by saying it ,directly, Mrs. Armstrong favored the opinion by implication. Among the many who from various motives paid great attention to the mother and daughter, was Mrs. M--, the lady of the President. Mrs. M--  was per- haps the most dignified and gracious of all the ladies that ever presided at the White House. Certainly her general affability made her the most popular. It was at a public reception that she first saw the pale young beauty who, to her eyes, seemed a sorrow-stricken orphan child, scarcely old enough to be presented; but when she was presented as Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, and when she understood that the broken- spirited girl was a widow, all the sympathies of her benevolent heart went out to her. Lou- ise, also, by a corresponding instinct, was at- tracted to this lady, forcibly. Mrs. M-- occa- sionally went to the parties given by the ladies of the members of the Cabinet, and here she sometimes met Louise; and even in the thick-) est crowd, Louise would find herself, she scarce- ly knew how,.in the immediate circle of the President's lady. Mrs. M----, quick to dis- cern and prompt to distinguish excellence of character, had another protege. This was young Frobisher, the secretary of legation, whose high intelligence, and, more than that, whose deep sensibilities, attached her to him with an almost maternal tenderness. Louise was fre- quently admitted Io the domestic privacy of Mrs. M--'s apartments. Here she often met young Frobisher, who more than any other person, deeply sympathized with her sorrows. Louise was reserved, and Frobisher was almost distant, in his veneration for that reserve. And when he had occasion to address her, there was a deep-toned tenderness aind respedt in his voice, that spoke to the heart of the sorrowing one, and the glance and voice of Louise reveal- ed the gratitude that her voice failed to express. I am afraid that all married ladies are, more or less, match-makers. After having finished up their own marriage, they set about, from various motives of benevolence, interest, or the want of amusement or occupation, to make up the matches of friends and acquaintances. Cer- tainly, it was from motives of benevolence that Mrs. M-- wished and hoped -that the deep sympathy of young Frobisher might ripen into a warmer sentiment, and that the supposed young widow might be able to find consolation in the affection of so amiable a youth. And there was the attraction of sym- pathy on the one side, and the need of it on /"   the other, that drew this young man and woman forcibly together. It was not love, but one of those illusive counterfeits of love, that often deceive both subject and object. It was near the close of the session of Congress, that is to say, upon the first of June, that young Frobisher presented himself at the lodgings of Mrs. Armstrong, and requested a private au- dience. Here he made a formal announcement of his regard for Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, and re- quested permission to pay his addresses to her. Mrs. Armstrong bowed haughtily in acknow- ledgment of this honor, and coldly requested information as to his fortune and prospects, stating that she had heard a rumor of his re- call by the British Government.  Mr. Fro- bisher informed her that he was recalled, at his own request--preferred for the following rea- sons, namely: that he had recently purchased the estates of Clonmachnois, and that he wished to return to Ireland for the purpose of improv- ing the lands and the condition of his tenantry.; and also to apply for the reversion of the title of Earl of Clonmachnois, the title of Countess having been voluntarily renounced by Mrs. Stuart-Gordon, by the sale of her patrimony and by her self-expatriation from her father- land. The heart of the haughty woman bounded at this announcement. Something of this Irish earldom she had heard before, but nothing with certainty, so that she had been altogether incredulous. Now, however, there was no doubting the fact; and a flush of malign triumph crimsoned her cheek, as she thought that, notwithstanding all their humil- iations, Louise would at last wear the title and the coronet that might have graced Bri- tannia's brow. Concealing her joy, however, she spoke of her daughter's deep sorrow, that was only now beginning to yield to time, and to the sympathy of friends. She knew, she said, of her daughter's high esteem of Mr. iFrobisher-nay, more, of her affection, yet un- acknowledged to her own hearti jealous of its fidelity, and superstitious in its devotion to a first love, yet. plainly Visible t0 the solicitous love of her mother.  Yet -she feared that Louise, in her religious. attachment to a mere memory, might renounce-the happiness within her reach. In fine, she requested time to ascertain her daughter's sentiments upon this projected marriage, -before- presenting Mr. IFrobisherito her as'a suitor. , Forced to accept this for a present answer, Mr. Frobisher bowed and took his leave, his rather moderate in- clination for "the pale young widow"' some-   what increased by the prospect of a little opposition. The reader knows, as well as I do, that she only wished an opportunity of laying her des- potic commands upon Louise. The reader knows, as well, how this interview was likely to terminate. Worn out by a long, long sor- row, now quite incapable of opposing any one, much less her imperious mother, and quite in despair, Louise yielded, though her whole na- ture revolted at the projected marriage. It was some relief to her to know that Frobisher was going to England, to remain for at least twelve months, before he returned to. claim her hand. "Who knows 9" she said to herself; perhaps I may die before he comes back, or he may be shipwrecked?" for she almost loathed; the youth whom, previous to this engagement, she had loved with a sisterly affection. As for Frobisher, he went away completely deceived-entirely believing his betrothed to be a widow. Once, indeed, he had casually inquired if the late Mr. Stuart-Gordon was not a connection of the Stuart-Gordons of The Isle of Rays. Mrs. Armstrong replied, quiet- ly, that her late son-in-law was a connection of that family. And the subject was dropped. Perhaps nothing on earth but the prospect of a title and coronet would have induced Mrs. Armstrong to compel her daughter to re- nounce, by a divorce, her claim upon the im- mense Island estate. Nothing but two such powerful passions as ambition and hatred, coupled with a desire for revenge, and acting upon the mind of a supremely haughty and unscrupulous woman, could have impelled her to the daring career of crime into which she at once entered. To have her daughter once le- gally divorced, and legally and magnificently remarried-to have that once accomplished, she was audacious enough to defy all evil con- sequences to herself. There is nothing more wonderful in the history of crime, than the fa- tuity with which a criminal dares almost cer- tain detection and disgrace. It was in this frame of mind that she went to Richmond, Virginia, where the Legislature was still in session, and where she forced Louise to memo- rialize that body for a divorce. ?  We have seen how the shallow petition was at once rejected. Mortified and alarmed, at I this failure, Mrs. Armstrong determined to act ( upon the other party--to induce Louis Stuart- Gordon, if possible, to petition the Legislature  himself. His petition, she felt sure, would be  received. There are few  secrets in a family where i   e there are many servants. Mrs. Armstrong had another line of communication with The Isle e of ,Rays besides that of Louis's occasional - notes, which she invariably read and put in r the fire, without communicating them   to y Louise. She had left her faithful coadjutor, - Kate, in the neighborhood, and it was rather , through the gossiping propensities of poor old a Serry, than from the treachery of any of the - servants, that the conversation of Louis with t the General, 'in which the former expressed r his determination of taking no step that should ; affect the future happiness of his daughter, was reported in triumph to Kate, and con- veyed to Mrs. Armstrong at Richmond. It was then that Mrs. Armstrong put in l practice the most daring and adroit deception that ever Satan suggested to self. It was now late in July, and under a pretence of relieving Louise from the care of her child, she sent the former to the sea-shore for change of air, and kept the latter at home. It was while linger- ing out her weary days at Old Point Coomfort that Louise received a letter from her mother, recalling her to the sick-bed of her child, who, she said, was lying dangerously ill of scarlet fever. Louise hurried at once to Richmond, but was told on her arrival that the babe was dead and buried; that the danger of infection had induced the necessity of a speedy inter- ment. Shock after shock had nearly paralyzed the sensibilities of the poor young woman, so that the impression made by this last blow was not so deep as in other circumstances it might have been. "Oh! I shall soon follow!" was all she said, with a tearless eye, and a wan smile. She was conveyed to her bed in a state of nervous exhaustion, that prostrated her for many weeks. It was during her illness that Mrs. Armstrong wrote to Louis announcing the death of his daughter, and assuring him that the .peace of Louise depended upon her freedom from marriage ties. The reader re- members that the answer of Louis requested to see this wish expressed in the handwriting of Louise herself, before he would consent to act upon it. Mrs. Armstrong smiled grimly to herself, and sitting down, wrote the letter de- scribing the exhausted state of her daughter's health, and reiterating the assurance that not only the peace of mind and health of body, but that the very life of her daughter hung upon his answer. This letter she took to the bedside of Louise. Louise was lying with her two emaciated hands upon her, pallid brow, shut- ting out the light from her eyes. Sitting down L    by her side, she laid her own cold hand over those of her daughter, and said, "How are you now, my love 8" "I I don't know, mother," heavily sighed the invalid, without uncovering her eyes. "Louise, my love, would you like to see Louis F' The effect of this question upon the poor girl was like that of a galvanic battery on a corpse. She started up with a spasmodic mo- tion, and looked intently into the face of her mother. "I inquired if you would like to see Louis, my love." "Like to see Louis I Oh, mother 1" "Well, my child, in consideration of our late and common bereavement, and of your preca- rious state of health, I have written to Louis 'to come and visit us." "Oh, mother, have you 8 May the Lord of Mercy bless you I bless you I bless you I my own good mother!" cried Louise, throwing her. self from the pillow upon her bosom "Calm yoirself, my child, calm yourself," said the mother, reaching a cordial from a table at hand, and holding it to the lips of her daughter. Then she laid her back upon the pillow. Her eyes were shining like stars, and there was a bright hectic spot on each cheek, as she smiling- ly said--"I see how it is, mother; you know that I am dying, and you are willing for me to take leave of Louis before I go. Heaven bless you, mother 1 Look out the window, mo- ther. It has been cloudy all day long. Look at the west, where the heavy dark-blue clouds lower almost to the verge of the horizon; but not quite, for see, the shining sun illuminates thelower edge of this cloud, and shoots out direct rays of glorious light aslant the earth --and now it has sunk below the horizon. Even so, mother. My life resembles this day -but you are willing to provide for me a ray I of sunlight before the night of death falls on me for ever. God bless you, mother 1" Her eyes and cheeks blazed with the fire of i fever while she spoke.           1 "My love, you must not talk so. You are utterly mistaken. You are young and sound, ( K and only suffering from alternate nervous ex- citement and exhaustion. You will recover  ] your health. But now, Louise, you must at- tend to this matter in hand. I have written to I Louis, requesting him to lose no time in coming i to see us. But, after all that has passed, Louis f may not be persuaded to come by me. You D must add your request. I know that you can r   scarcely hold a pen, my dear, but you can write one line, to endorse what I have written. Just write, ' Louis I my happiness, my repose, depend upon your granting the request con. tained in this letter." " Give me a pen-quick, mamma." Mrs. Armstrong placed a portfolio before her, and supported her in her arms, while Louise wrote with trembling hands, at the foot of the letter, the very words of her mother's dicta- tion- "Louis I my happiness, my repose, depend upon your granting the request contained in this letter.   LOUIE STUART-GORDON,"- and exhausted by the effort, fainted and fell back. It was thus that Louis and Louise were mu- tually deceived. It is wonderful how much sorrow, suspense, and anxiety, the most fragile human being can bear, before the frame gives way. Breaking a heart is the slowest of all methods of torturing a soul to death. No language, I am sure, can describe the sufferings of Louise for the next fortnight. We have seen the apathy with which she bore the news of the death of her child. It was the insensibility of the victim exhausted by previous torture. But now a cordial had been given her in the hope of a new happiness'. This had revived her sensibilities, her power of suffering, to a morbid excess. She could not sleep at night, nor rest during the day without an opiate, as days and weeks passed without her hearing from or seeing Louis. "He will not lose time in writing-he will come at once, mother I he is so forgiving-so magnanimous!" had been her first hopeful and enthusiastic assertion. "What can be the reason he does not write, at least, if any-thing prevents him from coming, mother i" was her despairing inquiry a week later. "Mother, write again I do write I Tell him that I am dying--that I shall never see Heaven if I pass hence without his forgiveness and blessing 1" And Mrs. Armstrong, to humor her, pretend- ed to write. Another weary week of mental torture passed, and then Louise pleaded- "Write once more, mother I once more l Plead with him I it is not for us to be proud, if he is justly obdurate 1 Tell him that I am fastened here to a bed of illness-that I can- not put my foot to the ground-that I cannot raise my hand to my head-that, for weakness   I can scarcely make my words audible even to your listening ear I Tell him that I may not live, and cannot die until he blesses me 1" So the heavy weeks passed in torturing sus- pense, or sorrowful pleadings. So October passed. Louise had told the truth. She could not die. A strange vitality of anxiety held her life, as some sharp pains sometimes keep their victim from fainting. Nay, more; with good medical attendance, with the bracing air of the fall, and the gradual subsidence of suspense into certainty, she recovered the tone of her nervous system sufficiently to leave her bed. November passed. December came; and then her mother, after preparing her for it grad- ually, informed her of the application of Louis for a divorce. Louise received it with resig- nation. "It is justice, it is justice," she said. "I had no right to hope for mercy." Upon the 1st of January, Mrs. Armstrong placed in her hands the copy of the bill of divorce that had been forwarded to her. "It is over!" said Louise, using the very words with which Louis had received his doom; and at the very time that Louis lay at the point of death with an inflammation of the brain at The Isle of Rays, Louise was again prostrated by a low nervous fever at Rich- mond. "Well!" exclaimed Mrs. Armstrong, with a sort of diabolical patience; " all this ' weeping, and wailing and gnashing of teeth' is terribly disagreeable; it is the dust and smoke and smell of brimstone, the blood and groans, remaining after the hard-fought battle upon the field of a victory. Patience I we shall bury our dead, clear our field, and then for the triumph-then for the illumination I In other words, Louise will wear through this misery and illness; and then soon, in another country and under prouder circumstances, our minister shall present a new Peeress at the Court of St. James." There was little danger that Mr. Frobisher should be prematurely informed of the real state of affairs with his betrothed. Those were not the days of steamships and telegraphs; and little individual villainies perpetrated in Rich- mond, Virginia, were not then, as now, com- mon themes of gossip in the lobbies of the Houses of Parliament in London. And for the rest, Mrs, Armstrong was willing to dare his after-knowledge of her antecedents, when her daughter was justly and legally bound to Frobisher in marriage. Letters from Mr. Frobisher announced his   expected return to Washington in February. Thither. Mrs. Armstrong, accompanied by Louise, went. They arrived at Brown's Hotel upon the first of February. There they found on the list of new arrivals the name and title of the Right Honorable James Frobisher, Earl of Clonmachnois; and Mrs. Armstrong's heart bounded with pride and joy when she saw it. The young Earl met his betrothed, after an ab- sence of many months, with renewed affection. He passed the evening in her boudoir, and pressed her to name an early day for their marriage. Mrs. Armstrong named that day three weeks. "Mother I Oh, mother I that is the twenty- second of February-the anniversary of my marriage!" "It is, certainly; but I never thought of it when naming the day I What a singular coin- cidence!" CHAPTER VI. "OUIS AND SUSAN.

Southey. AT the earnest entreaty of General Stuart- Gordon, Miss Somerville remained at The Isle of Rays until the convalescence of Louis; then she took her departure for her solitary home on The Crags. It was a bright, sharp morning near the last of January that she found herself there. Old George and Harriet welcomed her home, with heartfelt delight. George display- ed with glee a bunch of birds that he had brought home for "Miss Susie's" dinner; and exhibited with great pride a vast pile of flag mats, baskets, and children's, men's, and boys' coarse straw hats; all the work of his hands, which he said would bring sixty dollars when he could take them to market. And Harriet displayed some of the whitest spun cotton, which she said would knot beautiful fringes and toilet covers. -Both feared, however, that "Miss Susie" would find the house very rough, in comparison with the' beautifuil Island man-   sion. Miss Somerville smiled away their doubts ; and, having looked through her house and then laid off her riding-habit, she quietly fettled herself with her needle-work by her lonely fireside. "I am but twenty-one," said Susan to her- self, "and yet I begin to feel very much like an old maid." But she did' not look so, with her tender peach-blossom cheek, and the silky black curls dropping soft shades upon them. The day was heavy-it was no use to dis- guise the fact. Susan found it so; and often rising from her seat, she walked to the win- dows and looked out from very weariness. And as she remembered the pleasant family circle at The Isle of Rays-the hearty General, the gay Britannia, the sparkling little Brighty, and Louis, her prot(g6; her patient, suffering, sad, but the more interesting on that account- Susan nearly regretted the morbid self-respect i that forbade her to yield to the pressing en- treaties of the Stuart-Gordon family, and take up her residence among them. Night closed around her, and then more than ,ever she missed the social family circle that nightly gathered around the bright hickory fire in the oak-pannelled parlor at The Isle of Rays. She imagined them as they, sat there, after the tea-table was cleared away, the General and Britannia with the chess-board between them. The General, with his deep, hearty laugh, and Britannia with her beaming glance, and half- mocking smile; and Louis I what might Louis be doing now, that she was not there to keep him alive?-reclining back in his crimson vel- vet chair, watching the game with languid eyes. A wild blast of wind against the window aroused her from her reverie. She arose and looked out, and found that a snow-storm had suddenly arisen. She resumed her seat; and while the tempest howled around the old house, Susan felt more desolate in her loneli- ness than ever. George came in with tea and toast, and a lighted candle, upon a waiter. He sat it down on the table by Miss Somerville's side, and then he quietly withdrew. "The truth is, I have no appetite," thought Susan, as she turned to her solitary meal. "That long sojourn at The Isle of Rays has spoiled me entirely; I can no longer enjoy a meal that is at once very frugal and very lonely." A second and a wilder blast of the storm startled Susan from her chair, and at the same moment the door was pushed open, and Louis   r Stuart-Gordon suddenly stepped into the e room, stamping the, snow from his boots, and y throwing off his sleet-covered cloak, and re- r vealing his black suit, slight figure, and pale face. Miss Somerville paled herself. "In the name of Heaven, Louis, what tempted you out on such a night as thisI r you, who are barely convalescent!" exclaimed s the young nurse in displeasure, as the impru- dent patient dropped exhausted into a chair - beside her. I  "Do not scold, my loved physician; the storm had not arisen when I set out-it over-  took me at the top of The Crags." "Yet you should not have left -the house upon any account-no, not until spring." "You are mistaken, Susan; I am stronger than you think. I am  recovering rapidly. Give me a cup of your nice tea, and it will b set me up!" Miss Somerville went to the other door, called George, and directed him to bring an- other cup and saucer. "I missed you--we all missed you so much to-day, Susan, but I most of all. I seem to be a supernumerary at the Isle, now. In short, Susan, I was terribly bored with my own company, and having/,a great deal of listless news on hand, I have come to bestow a part of it on you. Have patience with me, Susan." George now entered with another cup and saucer and more toast, and Susan poured out  his tea. The table was soon after cleared off, and Louis drew his chair in closer to the fire, while 'the storm raged more fiercely around the house. Miss Somerville quietly pursued her needle- work, but a heavy gloom lowered slowly and darkly upon her spirits. It was a vague sense of error, or wrong, or danger, or dread-or all these together-that oppressed her. She could not avoid sighing frequently and heavily, and glancing nervously at the windows, as she hoped and prayed and watched for the violence of the storm to abate. Louis, for his part, sat there looking the very picture of: repose and contentment. He was silent, and sometimes very abstracted, seeming perfectly satisfied to be near Susan, without entering into con- versation with her. A wild blast of the hail- storm rattled against the windows. Unable  to control her nervousness, Susan arose and put her hand to the latch of the door, in- tending to look out, but a furious gust of wind blew it violently open.-sending, a tempest of   snow and hail into the room. Susan with all her strength was unable to close the door, and Louis had to get up to help her. Then they re- sumed their 'seats, and then, for the firat time, Louis noticed her sullenness. "What is the matter, Susan!" he inquired naively. "Matter? nothing," replied Susan, more dis- turbed than ever. "But there is, my dear Susan. I have never-no-never seen you so agitated!" Susan's brow flushed to crimson, and she turned her head aside. Louis took her hand, pressed it, and bending forward, looked search- ingly into her eyes. "Susan, I never had a sister, but you are dear to me as any sister could be-my loved Susan, tell me what disturbs you?" "I am so sorry that you risked your health by exposing yourself to this stormry replied Miss Somerville, with a benevolent evasion. Louis pressed her hand again, and dropped it. The clock struck ten. Louis then arose and resumed his cloak-and took his hat. Miss Somerville started up. "What! Louis I you do not think of venturing out in this hor- rible tempest i". "Assuredly, Susan "  "But you must not, indeed. Pull off your cloak, sit down, remain here. I will have a fire lighted in my grandfather's room for you"' t"Do you not understand that I must return, Susan." "No-no I you are mad to think of it. You should not have come at first-but being here, you SUALL NOT depart in the midst of the night and storm." "But my dearest Susan--" "But, Louis, it is as much as your life is worth I Sit down-be quiet-don't fidget me -I have had trouble enough on your account already-so sit down I I am out of breath." Instead of sitting down, Louis opened the door, but a violent blast of wind and sleet nearly blew him down, and again it took all his strength to force to the door. He shut it, and throwing off his cloak, sat down. It was literally impossible to reach The Isle of Rays that night. "Do-you know, Susan, that with all your gentleness, you are very audacious in some things!" "Very, very, courageous in some things, Louis I Yes, I am when I know I am doing right I Do not be uneasy, Louis. ,No one will misunderstand or misrepresent me.   ,And so, Miss Somerville tried to think; but as she remembered the censorious propensities of the neighborhood, the sinking of her heart belied her noble words. -Nevertheless, Miss Somerville, by turning a guest out in the storm, would not do a wrong to escape the imputation of wrong. "Mr. Louis, I will trouble you for a. half hour's conversation with me in my study," said General Stuart-Gordon, rising from the breakfast-table; pushing back his chair, and leading the way thither. Louis arose and followed. When they had arrived there, and were seated, the General said- "(You spent last night at The Crags, Louis!" "Yes, sir. The storm prevented my re- turn." "The threatened storm should have prevent- ed your going forth, Louls." Louis bowed, and remained silent. "You remained all night at The Crags I Well, this caps the climax. If you do not con- sider the question intrusive, Louis, will you favor me with your reason for going to The Crags '" "I went thither to see Miss Somerville, sir." "Hum I you went thither to see Miss Somer- ville. Louis, do you know that you are serious- ly compromising that poor girl!" "SR!" exclaimed Louis, starting. "My dear Louis, do you know, or has sel- fishness blinded you, that you cannot now visit Miss Somerville so frequently, without subject- ing her to calumny "' "Heavens I sir, it cannot be so!" "It is so. Miss Somerville has already been made the subject of invidious remarks." Louis grew very pale. "Tell me, sirl by whom-by whom has Susan been slandered I If by any living man, by Heaven, he shall pay dearly for his temeri- ty-if of any living woman, her father, brother, or husband, shallsettle the account." "Pooh I pooh I Louis, I did not say slander -disparaging speculations. Can you call a man out because his wife or daughter ' wonders,' what Susan means, and 'hopes it will all end well. Pshaw I but, Louis, you are doing Su- san a more serious injury than in subjecting her to the gossip of the neighborhood. You are trifling with her affections, Louis." No-no, sir I God knows that I am not I , Oh, my father, for what do you take me!" t "For a heart-sick, brain-sick, thoughtlessly selfish, and cruel young man."   "In the name of Heaven, what do you mean, 9 "              w sirt" q   , "That you have won the heart of Susan Somerville-a heart not lightly won or easily lost" "No, sir I no I It is not so-it cannot be so. Susan, so good, wise, and calm, love a broken reed like me. Come, sir, I am not a coxcomb.". ," My dear Louis I it is just such good girls as Susan Somerville that are apt to love such good-for-nothing fellows as you. It is a law of nature. If the good married the good, and the strong the strong, and the evil the evil, and the weak the weak-what a world of beauties and of monsters, of demons and of angels, we should have. I tell you, that this Busan-good, wise, calm, strong, as she:is-loves with all her heart and soul this brain-sick, heart-sick, broken- down son of mine." "Oh, sir, this cannot be so. Heaven forbid that it should be so, indeed. Susan loves me, it is true, but it is as a sister loves a brother, as an angel loves a sufferer Hnot else." "( She loves you as a lover, Louis --and 'you, Louis fi "And I ]I love Susan as a dear sister-I revere her as a guardian spirit-not else." "Louis, you should marry her." "Sir." "You should marry Susan Somervile." "Good Heaven, sir! impossiblel I do not love her in that way."  ( And yet you cannot for a single day do without the company of this girl, whom you do not love well enough to marry I Louis, as a man of honor you must do one of two things --marry Susan Somerville, or never see her more I You said that she loved you' as a bro- ther, I say that she loves you as a lover." "Are you sure of this, sir ". "Sure of it, Louis'"     e I "Sir, I will take one week to think of it. At the end of this time I will either resign the consolation of Susan's society for ever, or I will offer her my hand 1" "My dear Louis, that is right r" The week Louis Stuart-Gordon requested was for this purpose: to write once more to Louise-once more, and for the very last time I This letter was aa eloquent appeal He con- cluded it thus: "Though an act-of the Legislature ias di- vorced my-hand: from yours, no power on earth can divorce my heart from yours, best beloved Louise I I am not twentytwo .years of age, 12   Louise, yet a few silver hairs are already mingling with the brown on my temples  I have no hope of happiness in the future, ex- cept in the feeling that you still lie! that while there is life there is hope I Write to me once again, Louise, and write to me frankly, for my destiny and that of others, hangs upon your words.

"MR.

"With due Heespect,  "tHORE7NSE BL OSTONE ARUMSTRONG' -* This, singular communioation .and,proposal w. actually made. ,z   Whenever Louis received a wound, his in- E stincts sent him to Susan Somerville, to have s it dressed. So, as soon as he had received this cruel letter, he felt that he needed the gentle a girl, whose kind words, and soft tones and glances had such power to soothe his excited s mind. He placed the letter in his father's a hand, and stood, cap and riding-whip in hand, E waiting for him to read it.        h "You are going to The Crags, Louis, I sup- r pose," said the old gentleman, taking off his E spectacles, and returning the letter.   n "I am, sir." ' "You remember your promise, Louis-    a never to return thither, unless it was with the l intention of offering your hand to Susan Som- erville." "I remember it, sir, and I go for -that pur- i pose."             .      r "Itris well l" "Susan--Susan Somerville-I know that I 1 am utterly unworthy of you I I am a bowed, miserable, and despairing man i You are firm, o strong, and calmly happy in your strength.  Yet, Susan, now I cannot live without you; at f least, so it seems to me, and I am about to ask you to undertake the resurrection, the redemp- tion, of just such a lost wretch as I am!" The face of Susan grew deadly pale, and then flashed back to crimson. She withdrew the hand that he had taken, arose, and walked in an agitated manner to the window. Louis got up and followed her.  "Susan I dear Susan! is it such presump- tion to hope that I may be able to persuade you to give me your hand in marriage? Why do you not speak to me, Susan?" "Louis!" she faltered, and her frame trem- 'bled from head to foot. ("Well, dearest Susan, but that is no an- swer 1" ?"Alas I Louis, do not dream of another mar- riage-especially with me--with me, who had such an affection for-" "For one to whom I will now allude for the very last time. She is to be married in three 'weeks, Susan 1" "Gracious Heavens I No!" "This is so!" "And you, Louts!" "Look at me, Susan I I am very calm and ,quiet 1 Come, Susan  I have passed two years of widowhood; that is a long time to wear the willow for a faithless woman.

"Now, then, Susan, during all this time that she has deserted me, you have been my good angel; you have kept me from the grave. Say, Susan, will you not bless the life that you have saved? I feel, Susan, as though I could not live without your society. Come, Miss Somerville, make my father, Britannia, and myself, happy 1"  "Louis, as far as in me lies, I wuill make you all happy. I will be your friend and sister, as heretofore-and nothing more, Louis." "' Alas! Susan, do you not know that the world does not recognize such a relation be- tween those whom the ties of blood or of mar- riage do not unite." .. Susan leaned her elbow on the window sill, dropped her brow. upon her hand, and re- mained silent. ("Susan, you must either give me your hand, or I must totally resign the comfort of your so- ciety. Nay, I have passed my word to my father, to do so." "Louis! this is strange I this startles me! Louis, leave me." "Not without my answer, Susan." "Then take it, Louis. An impulse, strong as life, impels me in one direction-a power inexorable as the grave, holds me back. Be- tween them I am on the rack. Go, Louis l angel-tempter! Go, and let me draw into the quiet." "Not without my answer, Susan." He took her hand, and pressed it to his lips; he argued, implored, but failed to persuade. After some hours he left, and returned to The Isle of Rays. Susan dropped, pale and languid, upon the old settee. When Harriet came in to give her a cup of tea, she looked up languidly and said- "Harriet, you are old and experienced; did you ever know any one who was miserable all their lives?"  "No, Miss Susan, I never knew any one, not even the poorest slave, who was miserable from youth to age-except it was from re- morse. No, Miss Susan, but I have seen many i a cloudy morning clear off beautifully towards mid-day. Is not the sun breaking through the , clouds of your life now, Miss Susan?" General and Mrs. Stuart-Gordon came up to i The Crags in the afternoon. Their object was to persuade Susan to accept the hand of Louis.   The truth is, that General Stuart-Gordon was tired of having his family deranged with un- certainty, anxiety, grief, anger, and illness, and all the various passions, emotions, and calami- ties, that had agitated the Island manor for the last two years. He longed to see Louis comfortably married, and with a young nur- sery growing up around him. He knew that Louis never could be persuaded to address any young lady, unless it was Susan; he knew, also, that such was the feeling against divorce in the neighborhood, that scarcely any father could be induced to give the hand of his daugh- ter to a divorced man. Miss Somerville had no parents or guardians to interfere, and, be- sides, she loved Louis. Lastly, she had a great veneration for " those in authority," and for the opinions of her elders in general, and General Stuart-Gordon in particular. She would be likely to yield her prejudices to his persua- sions. As for Britannia, she loved sunshine; and Louis, delicate as he was, made a great shadow at The Isle of Rays, especially when Susan was away. And she wanted a female companion; she could not make one of her housekeeper, or her maid. She wanted a lady, an equal. So that I am afraid there was a little alloy of selfishness in the pure gold of benevolence with which the General and Brigh- ty wished to secure the happiness of Louis and Susan. Miss Somerville did not long hold out against all those influences brought to bear upon her. Not because she was alone and poor, and denied the pleasures of a social fam- ily circle, and the comforts of wealth-not because she loved Louis-not for all these strong -reasons would SusarrSomerville have consented, but because the happiness of Louis and the cheerfulness of his family seemed to depend upon her decision. At last, while Bri- tannia was clasping her hand, and smiling in her eyes, Susan assented. Then Brighty fond- ly embraced her. The next day, Britannia, attended by Louis and a servant with a led horse, came up to The Crags, to bring Miss Somerville back to The Isle of Rays. Having arrived, Brighty took Stusan up stairs. A wide, hall divided the second floor, as the first. This hall was lighted by two large bay windows, one at the front, and one at the back. It was also lined with paintings, and furnished with book-cases, rich reading desks, and lounges. On the right side of this hall were the winter rooms of Britannia. Throwing open a door on the left side of the hall, Brighty said, smiling- ly, "These are to be your apartments, Miss   Somerville-those on the opposite side being mine. Throwing this fine wide hall between us, we shall not come in contact, or quarrel, you know." Then she conducted Susan in. They were a beautiful suite of rooms, consist- ing of a boudoir, a dressing-room, and a bed- chamber, running parallel with the hall from front to back, in the order I have narrated them, connected by doors, and each having a door opening upon the hall. 'The draperies. Were all light-blue silk, and gave a singularly cheerful aspect to the rooms. "Now, my rooms, you know," said Britan- nia, "are in the reverse order of this. My bed-room is in the front, my dressing-room in the middle-oh! that is just where yours is; and my-boudoir, in the back is turned into a nursery for little Brighty. It was once Louis's dressing-room. All that week Britannia was' occupied in preparing for the wedding. But now came the trouble and the mystery. From the moment of their engagement-from the moment that the firmness of Susan Somner- ville had yielded to much solicitation on the part of Louis Stuart-Gordon and his faimily- from the moment that the factitious interest of the struggle was over, and the object was at- tained-the spirits of Louis flagged-he sank day by day into a deeper depression. Unlike the lover he had been for a day-unlike even the friend he had been for years-Louis be- came gloomy, abstracted, and absented himself as much as decency would permit from his betrothed. And Susan! she watched his increasing despondency with a sad, though quiet surprise -and silently set herself to discover the cause and means of curing his malady. General Stuart-Gordon observed the un- grateful neglect of Miss Somerville by his son, and became seriously displeased. Brighty was as much vexed as it was pos- sible for Brighty to be. The marriage ceremony was to be performed very quietly on the next Sabbath, at church before the morning service. Saturday came, and the despair of Louis was frightful to look upon. General Stuart- Gordon was indignant, and Britannia herself was struggling against an increasing irrita- bility. Gertrude Lion and her brother were to be the bridal attendants. They arrived to an early dinner-intending to remain all day and night. The family met at the dinner-table, but   :the sorrowful abstraction of Louis, much as he struggled to overcome it, damped the spirits of the whole party-even Gertrude's' laughter was smothered in something very like a great sigh. In the afternoon little Zoe arrived. After an early tea, the household separated -that is to say, Louis went off to his own apartment-Susan disappeared, no one knew where--the General betook himself to his wainscoted parlor to sulk, and Brighty followed him, in an amiable spirit of contradiction, to defeat that profitable object. Brutus Lion stalked off to the stables, and the two girls, -Gertrude and her pet, went to their own rooms to have a good confidential girlish talk about matters and things in general, and the ap- proaching marriage in particular. Up to this time, be it remembered that Gertrude had not chanced to know that the aspirant to the hand of Louise Armstrong was her own ci-devant admirer, Frobisher. No I that Gertrude had now to learn; but we will leave the girls gab- bling in their chamber in good time, before the unlucky little tongue of Zoe shall have told the news, or applied the match that, shall explode our dear grenade, Gertrude. We will follow Louis, though he is not just now an agreeable object of study. Louis had left the tea-table, and wandered in an abstraction to his own chamber. It was situated in the front of the house, as I said. It was so early in the evening that the window blinds had not been closed. The windows overlooked the river and the opposite high banks--the highest crowned by Mont Crystal, the old home of Louise. It was very distinct in the evening light. The sun had already set; but the western sky was gloriously beautiful, with its reflected light. Gorgeous crimson, purple, and golden clouds were piled up like the mountains of ruby, topaz, and amethyst, in the Arabian Nights, and reflected in all their' marvellous splendor in the crystal river below. On the eastern side, the moon was just rising, and striking an arrow of diamond light down the stream. Before him was the opposite bluffs crowned by the lofty colonnaded White front of Mont Crystal. It was a lovely and a soothing scene, yet Louis sickened at it. He closed the blinds, and sat down in dark- e ness. He sat down in a deep and high-backed I chair, and dropping his head upon his open I palms, gave himself up to sad thoughts. 1   An hour passed, and he' had not changed his i attitude. Suddenly he felt two light, soft hands de- scend like'a blessing on his head. He looked up in surprise, and recognized Susan Somerville. I er hands slipped down over his temples, and then dropped kindly upon his hands, which they took and pressed. "My dear Susan!" exclaimed Louis, in a tone between surprise and remorse. She silently pressed his hands, went quietly to the window, 6pened the blinds, letting in a flood of moonlight, and returning, half leaned over his chair, as she addressed him- "Louis, you are very wretched-why do you not deal frankly with me a" "My dear Susan."' "Why do, you not honestly tell me the cause of your remorse t" "Oh, Susan!" "Why not have said to me, ' Susan, I loved thee as a dear sister, I drew health from thy presence, and cheerfulness from thy talk; but, Susan, I mistook my heart when I thought that I could wed thee. " "Susan:! Susan!" "Come, Louis! we have both acted foolish- ly-we have both been weak and wicked; let us retrace our footsteps, while there is yet time." "What mean you, Susan?" "Let us break this ill-omened engagement- 'it was wrong; do not let it become fatal-come, let us consider it." "Never, Susan I Never I Pardon, dear Su- san 1 pardon a few regrets given to the past- they will soon themselves be past!-they are past. Susan, you merit my entire devotion- you have it." "Thank you, dearest Louis I but' my pur- pose is fixed. Since you will not agree with me to annul this engagement, I break through it. I came here for that purpose." "But, Susan, this is hasty-this is rash. You have not considered all the consequences." i"My friend!" said Susan, with a mild solem- nity, "I have erred, and suffered somewhat from rashness. I will never be rash again! No, Louisl I have thought of this some weeks, but I resolved to do nothing rashy." "But, Susan-" "To-night, my mind is made up finally, and,"f said Miss Somerville, standing* up and resting her hand upon the dressing-table-" and Louis! here I take the God and his holy. evangelists to witness, that I will never, under any posi-   ble circumstances, give you my hand in mar- riage, or sustain any other relation to you than m that of sister and friend."  Louis started to his feet-would have arrest- ki ed the hand that fell upon the Bible, but it was too late; the oath was recorded.        q With a sudden revulsion of feeling-by a strange contradiction, Louis was struck power- sl less by the sight of the consolation so unex- b pectedly, so irretrievably snatched from him. d At last he faltered out--  , Oh, why! why have you done this? rash and hard-hearted girl."           t "To cut this matter short at once and for ever, Louis. And now, dear Louis, we shall be friends again. We have been such strangers a since our betrothal, Louis. Now that. that is  annulled, we shall be friends again. I shall be  thy sister and consoler as heretofore. When- r ever thou art lonely, or wearied, or troubled, thou shalt come to me-yes, in season and out ; of season, at all times and at all hours, Louis, and find a sister's affection and a sister's conso- lation." "Oh I but, my dear Susan, the world I the world!"     .   .   . ".As I told one gentle one, who is nameless here, the world will make no mistakes about me. Good night, Louis I go to announce this new phase of affairs to Britannia." Louis caught her hand, and pressed it fer- vently to his lips, and then permitted her to leave him. She went out, with the purpose of de- scending into the oak parlor to talk with Brighty, when the opposite door of the cham- ber, jointly occupied by Gertrude and Zoe, was thrown open, and Gertrude Lien, in a state of high excitement, burst out and fled past her down the stairs, and into the ;oak parlor. Amazed, Susan drew back and returned to her ownsroom. I'll he hanged, drawn, and quartered, be- fore I stand it I'll be torn to pieces by wild beasts before I stand it I rl be blown up from the crater of my own volcano before I stand it!" thundered Gertrude Lion, bounding like a storm into the midst of the room-her tall figure elevated, her fine head thrown back, her yellow hair falling like a cataract, her broad white bosom now red and heaving, her neck, her cheeks, her very brow, flushed to a bright carnation, her transparent nostrils dis- tended, quivering, her light-blue Saxon eyes dilated, blazing. General Stuart-Gordon and Britannia looked at her in silent astonishment.   "H shall break a blood-vessell I wish I might, it would be a relief. I shall choke to death-I shall burst!" cried the giantess, sha- king with her thunder from head to foot. "Why, what is the matter, Gertrude " in- quired the General "HOLD YOUR TONGUE!" shouted the Amazon, strutting up and down the room like a chafed bearess in her cage. "Don't speak to me, I am dangerous; I shall do damage; I shall ex- plode and blow the house up 1" "Can you guess what has angered her, Bri. tannia r" Brighty shook her head. "It is insufferably hard, so it is, that out of all the millions on this burdened earth, I only care for one boy, and I am to be swindled out of him!" cried Gertrude, flinging back the tor- rent of hair, every golden thread of which bristled with agitation. "You all part with your sweethearts and wives with as much in- difference as you would resign the partner of a dance. By my own heart's strength, I will not. I have felt a long time as though I ought to roll up my cuffs and take that womanin hand! This is a judgment on me for not doing it. I have let her scheme and plot, and marry ; and unmarry, and torture and break hearts to her own heart's content. Oh, just God that I have spent so much time in ridding the - woods and mountains of wolves and bears, and ) that I have let this human hyena walk abroad among women, and never resolved to deal with a her, until she struck her fangs into my own h heart I Selfish that I was I Not for the sake - of Susan, of Louise, -of Louis, of Zoe, of all s the hearts that she has trampled in the dust, f did I resolve to punish her I Now she would r plant her cloven foot upon my bosom-would r marry off my boy-my own, own boy--the gift o of the mountain cataract to mne; my own beau- tiful white water-lily, that I found broken and e. half drowned amid the foam of the torrent and. d the peaks of thp rocks.

But how can Louise help him in his plans of life? Oh, he has been charmed, fooled; he is in a bewilderment. He shall be saved!" The storm had nearly expended its fury. From tearing and striding-from thundering blazing, and roaring, Gertrude subsided into sauntering, crying, and exclaiming. The storm had subsided, but not the resolution to which it had given birth. General Stuart-Gordon took his paper and walked out of the room. Brighty arose, and, taking the hand of the still somewhat excited girl, led her to a seat by the fire, and placing one hand upon her heaving breast, she inquired, "Now, what is all this about, Gertrude?" "What is all this about? Why, that I have just heard from Zoe Dove the name of the young man to whom Mrs. Armstrong is going to marry Louise. It is James Frobisher, my own betrothed!" "My cousin, the Earl of Clonmachnois whose life you saved! But were you bg- trothed!" "' Yes-no! That is to say, I do not really know if it was actually so or not. This was the way of it: He passed six weeks with me at The Lair. Just before he went, he asked me to have him-but just to go to a boarding-  ,school for a year, and learn some accomplish-  ments. Well, I told him No, very decidedly; s of course I was not going to have a man for the  first asking. I wanted to be courted like other X women? I suppose he misunderstood me, or i he hadn't time; at any rate, he took my NO, and went off with it  Something in my own bosom assures me that he prefers me to every other woman. Mrs. Armstrong knew it all. She was in the neighborhood all the time while you were away; and in two words, I am going to Washington to forbid the banns." "You are mad, Gertrude!" "Then I am the better company for those I go to see!" exclaimed the Amazon, with spirit. "Good night I Late as it is, this night I go to si The, Lair, and to-morrow, with early dawn, I in set out for Washington. -Oh, I'll strike her a ar blow! I'll give her a turn I'll purposely nu wait until the last moment-until the bridal m circle stand before the parson!-then Ill de- we nounce her villainy  Then I'll insist upon th being heard-then and there I will denounce ac her 1" "You are mad i Ponder, my dear Gertrude mi -bethink you, we have no proofs!-nay, we est en   ree are not certain even in our own hearts of her ed, guilt." ise  "THEN and THERE! in her pride of place, in en her hour of triumph, I will denounce'her as a ie traitress-as a murderess! and I will trust to her own conscience, in that moment of surprise 'y. and horror, to corroborate my testimony if I g, am right, or cover me with confusion if I am to wrong. Good night, once more! I have no m time to lose in vain ceremonies! Make my Ch adieus to the family." And the Amazon an bounded from the room. n.  The next morning, at breakfast, Britannia "mentioned the mad freak of the Gerfalcon. le  "What! do such a desperate act as that? g She will not, with all her madness." is  "Rely upon it that Gertrude will do it." "If she has such a design, she must be pre- e vented from carrying it out. It would kill e Louise." And Louis arose from the table and g rang the bell. y  "Saddle the fleetest horse in the stable!" was the order he gave the servant who ap- 3, peared. In fifteen minutes, Louis Stuart-Gordon was galloping rapidly towards The Lair. He ar- y rived in two hours. Gertrude had set out for s the metropolis at four o'clock that morning. It was now eleven. She had seven hours in ad- vance of him. Gertrude, with her strong, fleet horse, and her hard riding, would probably reach the city by nightfall. He, were he to set out now, might reach it by ten or eleven o'clock at night. He resolved to attempt it. 'Writing a hasty line to his family, and sending it by a boy, he set out for Washington. CHAPTER   VIL THE SWOOP OF THE GERFALCON. An eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight! Shelley. IN Washington city are several elegant man- sions, upon the building, adorning, and furnish. ing of which the owners have spent fortunes, and from which they derive comfortable reve- nues, by letting them to foreign ministers, members of the Cabinet, Senators, or other wealthy men, whose temporary sojourn with their families in the Metropolis make such an accommodation desirable. One of these man- sions had lately been vacated by the Spanish minister, recalled to Madrid. Mrs. Armstrong established herself in this dwelling for the sea-   son of her sojourn in Washington. Here she commenced the splendid preparations for the marriage of her daughter. The first week was spent in ordering an elegant trousseau for the \ bride and passed among jewellers, dry-goods ,merchants, milliners, and mantua-makers; the second week, in superintending the work of the upholsterers; who were engaged in fitting up the rooms in festive style. The third and last week before the marriage was employed in issuing cards of invitation to the wedding. -During all these three weeks the gates of Mrs. Armstrong's city residence were besieged with private carriages or hackney-coaches, and the gold basket on her centre-table laden with the cards of distinguished visitors, who had called to pay their respects to the wealthy widow. Mrs. Armstrong had also renewed her acquaint- ance, and Louise her intimacy, with the amiable and dignified Mrs. M--, the lady of the President. Louise Hcrushed with sorrow, bewildered, lost in the moral maze in which she found her- self-Louise faded day by day.  She must have taken to her bed, but that her waning strength was sustained by powerful tonics and stimulants-and still her paleness, her emacia- tion, was attributed to mere physical delicacy. And young Frobisher!-if there was any thing he admired with enthusiasm, it was fine physical strength and beauty-this had been the strong attraction that had drawn him to Gertrude; if there was any thing he pitied with. all his heart, it was physical delicacy. Thus as he had loved Gertrude from admira- tion, he now loved-Louise from pity. Still it must be confessed that of late the memory of the glorious mountain-girl haunted him like some grand fantastic dream. And he sometimes sent a sigh floatifng over the hills and forests up into the far mountains of Vir- ginia. I have had little time to analyze the nature of young Frobisher-to show the strug- gle in his heart between admiration of the beautiful Amazon, and dread of introducing such a savage into the refined circles of English gentility. Young Frobisher lacked combative- ness and firmness. With the most elevated aspiration, he wanted decision of character, strength of will, and frequently needed the force of external circumstances, or the influence of another stronger will to impel him in this course or in that. Thus he had acquiesced in Gertrude's negative with very little resistance. Thus he had yielded to the attraction of his sympathies, and the magnetism of the strong and decided wills by which he was surrounded,   when he offered his hand to Louise. This sub- tle influence, this spiritual magnetism, still impelled him in a course which he fancied he was pursuing of his own free will. Some women want a master, and some men need a mistress. o Froisher was one of the latter. The day before the wedding came. Louise was very feeble. Frobisher regarded her with visible anxiety. Mrs. Armstrong sought to re- assure him.  "Once out of this country," said she, "where she has suffered so much, her health will im- prove." And she lectured Louise in private, and ad- ministered quinine. Night came-the night before the wedding. Louise lay on her bed, with her hands clasped over her brow and eyes-eyes that seldom now closed in slumber. "I shall die. I feel that this is the last night of my life, unless a miracle be wrought to save me I I cannot save myself! I am so feeble-I am a very slave.  When I was younger, happier, and stronger, then I uffered myself to be blinded by a moral illusion. Now, that the scales have fallen from my eyes; now that I see how wrong-oh, my God I how de- plorably wrong, I have been, it is too late! Louis is lost to me, and, worn out by slavery and suffering, I have no power to resist this marriage-this execution! I shall die I I shall die there before them all, and then Louis will know how I loved-and mother will know how she erred!" Thus mourned the broken spirit, in its still despair. - Sometimes wild impulses would trav- erse her brain, like forked lightning across a cloudy sky. "Louis lives-lhe lives While there is life there is hope I What hinders me from flying to him now? Because he is not my husband? He is;my husband-he is I though a million of Legislatures in a thousand halls should have pronounced our divorcement. What hinders me now from flying to him; and, if I die, die on his bosom-if he casts me off-at his feet!" She started up with the impulse, but her head reeled, her limbs failed, and she sunk back upon the bed. "In vain-in vain I I have no longer the power to execute even my own weak purposes. The hand of Death is suspended over me-ere I be the bride of that man it will fall on me I Louis only can save me now I I feel that God has deputed the power of life and death into   the hands of Louis. Louis the forsaken I ouis the betrayed I Oh, that Louis would come and save I' Thus all night the sick heart mourned. Thus all night the wild brain toiled; and morning dawned, and the sun arose, and found the bride feverish, excited, yet pale and faint. Night came again-the wedding-night. The house was one blaze of illumination. The grounds around it a forest of carriages. The splendid saloons were filled with a brilliant company. Mrs. Armstrong herself never looked so imperial as on this night, when her daughter was to be wedded to an Earl. In truth, Mrs. Armstrong was a very queen-like woman, and stood among her guests as their sovereign, and her imperious eye, lighted with the triumph of pride, shone over the distinguished assembly with an almost youthful brilliancy. Members of the House of Representatives, Senators, mem- bers of the Cabinet with their families, foreign : Ministers with their suites, were present. The r  President himself honored the occasion with his 1 presence. Yet the centre of all eyes was Mrs. Armstrong herself, in her matronly grace' and majestic beauty.              e The arrival of the Right Rev. Bishop H--, r in his carriage and canonical robes, caused a a sensation.  The arrival of the Bishop was soon b followed by the entrance of the bridal party- v a magnificent spectacle!          c, I wish I could daguerreotype the following scene, and place it in form and color, vividly h before you. I  will try.         co The wall of the vast saloon was hung with w yellow  damask, and formed a  warm  back m ground to the picture. Three immense chan- m deliers hung from the ceiling. The brilliant in company that filled this room had fallen back di on all sides, leaving a space in the centre of the" of saloon, immediately under the blaze of the co central chandelier. In this broad light stood ju the Bishop in his canonical robes.. On his right toi hand, at the distance of a few yards, stood Mrs. for Armstrong, her majestic form arrayed in a royal purple velvet, her black hair arranged in vo massive braids, and adorned with a circlet of Li diamonds and a  tuft of white ostrich plumes, an She leaned upon the arm of General     shi General-in-Chief of the American army, in his sap gorgeous uniform. Upon the left of the Bishop go] stood the British Minister and his suite, in their sta court-dresses. The bridal party advanced, and -1 arranged itself in a   semicircle before this ma group. The bride was arrayed in a rich white ave satin, and over that an open robe of gauze, E with a   deep border of embroidered silver tha   'uis flowers. Her head, her neck, her arms, her md stomacher, were literally blazing with dia- monds. The woman was nearly invisible in ms the sun-like splendor. To her left ran a line ing of six young bridesmaids, with their white silk be dresses and wreaths of white roses. By her side stood the bridegroom, and on his right a he line of six young groomsmen. They were he dressed in that elegant gentlemen's wedding he costume that needs so little description, viz: nt .the fine blue dress coat, the white satin vest, ed and kid gloves. er , The full light of the chandelier blazed down ;s. upon this gorgeous spectacle. It was the focus id of the eyes of all that vast company. Some Id said'that the fine aristocratic features of the )f bridegroom were very pale, like those of a y man going to his doom-but that might have )f been from the contrast of the black silky curls i- and whiskers that encircled his clear white nface. Others said that the bride trembled, and e rested languidly upon the arm of her first s bridesmaid. The Bishop opened his book. I  A  dead silence fell upon the crowd. Their eyes were riveted  upon the group. Many , noticed the fearful paleness of the bride's face, L and saw her lean heavily upon the armn of the bridegroom. The Bishop, in a deep and earnest voice, thus commenced the impressive marriage ceremony: "Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of thip company, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is com- mended by St. Paul to be honorable among all men, and therefore is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God. Into this holy state these two people come now to be joined. If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace." "I CAN!" shouted a clear, high, imperious voice, and the doors flew open, and Gertrude Lioh burst, "a  beautiful embodied storm," among them. She, too, in festal garments; a shining dark-blue satin studded with glittering sapphires, and her magnificent hair rolling a golden glory to her feet. Her commanding stature-her glowing color--her blazing eyes -the glory of her imperious brow, might have made the guilty in that crowd deem that an avenging angel stood among them." Struck statue-still, less by the interruption than by the splendidly beautiful Amazon that   made it, the assembled company was held in a spell of silence while they gazed at her. There she stood in her sublime beauty, ra- diating a cold splendor, like a sun-struck ice- berg. Only one instant was the crowd held in that spell of wonder-stricken silence, and then a hum of many voices rolled through the crowd, as they exclaimed or inquired of one another, "Who is this?" "What does this mean?" "Ha 1" "What!"EHow "  W "Who is she?" "SILENCE EVERY ONE OF YOU!" thundered the Amazon, bringing the loaded end of her riding-whip down upon the table with a re- sounding ring. "Who is this woman?" asked the Bishop, in a low whisper, of Mrs. Armstrong. "Oh, a lunatic! a mad woman of the moun- tains I Arrest her 1'" "HOLD YOUR TONGUE, MRS. ARMSTRONG 1" shouted the giantess, raising the end of her riding-whip, and making a step towards her, "I am GERTRUDE LION! and you know me; and so does James Frobisher, Earl of Clon- machnois!" said she, fixing her eyes on the bridegroom. James Frobisher, Earl of Clonmachnois, was standing there, giving his whole attention to the half-fainting bride. "Leave that man! come to me, Louise l" said Gertrude, in a voice full of commanding tenderness, opening her arms and holding them out. to the poor bride, who with an in- stinctive bound cleared the circle, and fell upon the broad and sheltering breast of the Amazon. "There, there, there, there, be a good girl," dove-like cooed the Falcon, gently caressing her. "Young lady," began the Bishop, "will you please to.--" "SHUT UP," snapped the giantess. and then gave her attention to her charge. "ThereI there I don't weep, Louise, or I shall." "Madaml the assembled    company are amazed, confounded at your- singular conduct. In their name I demand  the meaning of this. Upon what pretence have you arrested this marriage?" asked the Bishop, advancing and .1 standing before her in all the venerableness of his age and office. "I insist instantly upon t hearing from your lips from what cause and  to what end you have arrested this mar- ] riage?"                  t The Amazon raised her imperious brow, and r looking him steadily in the eyes, answered, I   a "Because the would-be bride is' the wife of another man!" "How-what 1" exclaimed the Bishop. A thrill of exclamatory astonishment ran through the crowd. ' t  "Madam, you should be very sure of what n you advance!" exclaimed the Bishop with so- e lemnity. e  "Ask the bride herself. Louise I answer, I s command you I Are you the wife of Louis o Stuart-Gordon, or not!" "Oh, I am I I am I Indeed I am, the wife I of Louis Stuart-Gordon 1" "You hear her 1" said Gertrude, triumph- anly. "She is mad! mad, I say!" exclaimed Mrs. i Armstrong, striding  forward.  "Gentlemen, will none of you arrest this mad woman?" Gertrude threw a glance of mingled triumph and defiance over the astounded crowd. Her eye lighted in its roving upon a new-comer, Louis Stuart-Gordon, pale, travel-stained, and dusty, stood among them. "Take her, Louis," exclaimed she, tossing her charge into his arms  "Take her, Louis, as my free gift, and swear by the name of Gertrude Lion, henceforth and for evermore, amen I Take her and bear her hence, for I have the devil's own -work to do now 1" "An avenging angel's, rather!" replied Louis, receiving the fainting form of Louise in his arms; " an avenging angel's, rather!" ' It amounts to about the same thing," re- plied Gertrude. And terrible was the brow that the Ger- falcon now turned towards the assembled company. "Arrest her I she is mad!" exclaimed Mrs. Armstrong, terror-stricken by the appalling look, of the Amazon. Gertrude raised one hand up, as though ap- pealing to Heaven. "Hear me, all who are gathered in this house. I denounce Hortense Armstrong as the murderer of Genevieve, the first wife of Dr. Armstrong  I  denounce her as having abandoned the eldest child of her husband, and as having concealed and suppressed the will by which that child was acknowledged and consti- tuted the heiress of the half of the Mont Crystal estate lI denounce her as having conspired against the liberty of that child, in having pro- cured her to be sold as a slave I And I ap- peal to Heaven to confute or corroborate my testimony!" and the avenger raised her hand' reverently.  *  *  *  *  cB BEROLD it "OOK TO MRs. ARMSTRONG I  She is: flling!"   Mrs. Armstrong had suddenly dropped to the floor, her throat swollen, her face purple, her whole frame convulsed I 0he was lifted and borne from the room, and the company broke up in confusion. "A word with you, Gertrude the Destroyer 1" commanded the Earl of Clomachnois, beck- oning the Amazon to the recess of a bay window. Gertrude, still "vibrating with the thunder" she had spent, followed him, weak as a fainting elephant I "Terrible denouncer I what have you' done! Have you any proofs of what you charge this woman with V" "Proofs I Every proof that will satisfy my own mind I None, perhaps, that would con- vict her in a court of justice 1" "Explain!" "That little girl Zoe, the schoolmaster's adopted child, who was attached at The Lair as the property of Miss Somerville--that same Zoe was the eldest daughter of Dr. Hector Armstrong and Genevieve Somerville, his first wife by a secret marriage. This marriage was concealed to avert the anger of his father and the disinheritance of the son. Genevieve had no proofs of her marriage in her own posses- sion, and the birth of her child was concealed by Harriet, her foster-mother, to save the poor motherless girl from the terrible wrath of her father. This concealment was effected under circumstances inducing the suspicion that Zoe was the child of George and Harriet. By the machinations of Mrs. Armstrong, these circum- stances were long afterwards used to procure the attachment of Zoe as a slave, in order that she might be got out of the way 1 This, how- ever, in advance of my story. Soon after the birth of her child, Genevieve Somerville died suddenly, and under suspicion of poison. Soon aher that event, Miss Blackistone married Dr. Armstrong. He promised Harriet, who was in his confidence, to acknowledge and take home his daughter-a promise that he deferred to perform from time to time-in fact, he stood in awe of his wife. Finally, he died without having performed his promise. Just before he was taken to his bed, he saw Harriet, and told her that he had made a will acknowledging his marriage with Miss Genevieve Somerville, acknowledging her daughter Zoe, and con- stituting her heiress to half his estates. He said that he was resolved to reveal the whole matter to his wife. -We believe that he did. But he died, and no mention was ever made of   a will, and no step was taken by his widow to ' restore his eldest daughter to her rights. If there was a will, as we fully believe there was, Mrs. Armstrong probably destroyed it, with all that could have proved the parentage of Zoe." "But the servant, then-Harriet I Why did she not disclose the secret?" "Because it would have done every sort of harm, and no good. It would have covered an honest family with shame and confusion, with- out restoring Zoe to her rights." "I do not see that." "Do you not know, then, that, however hon- est and good they may be, the oath of a slave or other colored person, will not pass in a slave State against a white person? The disclosure would have nearly, killed the proud old Major Somerville, because he could not prove the marriage. Therefore Harriet determined to keep the secret, at least until the death of Major Somerville. 'You know the events that followed that death. Harriet and George were taken for debt; Zoe was attached. It was two months before Harriet and George were re- deemed from prison. When they came out, the first thing they heard, with, astonishment, was, that Zoe had been attached, but was now at liberty. The first thing they did then was to divulge to Miss Somerville and to Mrs. Stuart-Gordon and myself the secret of Zoe's birth. Then General Stuart-Gordon was ad- mitted to the confidence, and he busied himself in investigating the affair. Being unable to find the clew to any other proofs but those of George-and Harriet, it was deemed prudent to take no rash step in the matter, but to watch the course of circumstances, and in the mean time to be as kind as possible to Zoe. And I suppose, with their rascally prudence, tfiey would have ' watched the course of circum- stances' to this day, if I had not taken the mat- ter up, and trusted in God for the result." "Gertrude the Avenger I  But this other matter of Mrs. Louis Stuart-Gordon; explain that." "Mrs. Armstrong, through her omnipotent in- fluence over her daughter, separated her from her husband for no other reason than because General Stuart-Gordon married a second time. Afterwards she effected a divorce, and would have broken her heart, and Louis's heart, and drawn you into the marriage with a woman whom you know very well you only pitied, and did not love, Jamie, if it had not been for me." "Gertrude the Preserver! Gertrude, I never   admired you so much in all my life as this evening." In the mean time a scene of death was trans- piring above stairs. In a thickly curtained room, upon a stately bed, lay the wreck of the haughty and majestic Hortense Blackistone Armstrong, still in her robes of state-aa mag- nificent ruin! The Bishop, still in his canoni- cals, and another clergyman of the Episcopal faith, stood on one side of the bed; a physi- cian and a surgeon on the other; Louis Stuart- Gordon stood supporting Louise at the foot of the bed. The Bishop, summoned to the house to perform a marriage .ceremony, was now reading the solemn service of the dying. Mrs. Armstrong hadvnever spoken, or given the slightest sign of intelligence from the moment of her fall. Her attack was apoplexy -a disease to which her full habit of body rendered her peculiarly liable. Terrible was the struggle between Death and the strong physical organization he had to conquer! All night long that swollen and purple face was contorted-all night long that strong body was convulsed. It was the dawn of day before that haughty face was composed-before that proud form was still in the rigidity of death -before that imperious spirit had "migrated to the great secret!" Peace be with her I We do not know whether or not she were guilty of the worst crimes laid to her charge, since nothing but strong circumstantial evidence rested against her. We heard her accusation-we heard not her defence. She was struck speechless and powerless 1 Let us judge her leniently, or leave her with her God! Immediately after the funeral, Louis and Louise Stuart-Gordon returned to The Isle of Rays. Though the papers of Mrs. Armstrong were diligently searched, no vestige of a will or of a marriage certificate, or of any other paper identifying Zoe, as the legitimate daughter of Dr. Armstrong, could 1be found. .Her fate   rested upon the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Stuart-Gordon, who at once acknowl- edged her as a sister, and settled one-half of the Mont Crystal property upon her. Among the papers of the deceased, however, were found some letters, dated near Richmond, Virginia, and touching the health and well- being of a certain little child, Margaret, there at nurse. Simultaneously struck with a wild hope, Louis and Louise hastened to the village, and found there, with more joy than surprise, their beloved child, Margaret, now a brave little girl of three years old. It was clear that Mrs. Armstrong had prac- tised this deception to effect the divorce. It was not certainly known whether she ever meant to reproduce the heiress, but it was thought probable. Some months from this time a double wed- ding was celebrated at the Island mansion, and the county papers the next day announced the two following marriages, one immediately un- der the other. MARRIED, On May 1st, at The Isle of Rays, the seat of his Excellency Governor Stuart-Gordon, by the Rev. Wilton Lindslay, pastor of the Church of the Transfiguration, the Right Honorable James Frobisher, Earl of Clonmachnois, to Gertrude, only daughter of the late Wolfgang Lion. At the same time and place, Brutus Lion, Esq., of The Lair, to Zoe, eldest daughter of the late Dr. Hector Armstrong, of Mont Crystal. Brutus Lion and Zoe reside at Mont Crystal; Louis and Louise of course remain at The Isle of Rays, with Brighty and the GeneraL A year from this time, Wilton Lindslay and Susan Somerville were married; and in the attractive duties of wife, mother, and pastor's helpmate, for all the sorrows of her early youth, Susan Somerville found rich compen- sation.
