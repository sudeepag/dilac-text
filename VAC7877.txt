CHAPTER I.
THE VALE OF SHANNONDALE.
Oh, sparkling clear thy waters flow,
And murmur as they glide,
To the thir trees that bend below
To kiss the loving tide;
And far above the mountains stand,
Like watch towers placed to guard a land
Where alt conspires to yield delight,
Where pleasure reigns by day and night.
S/iantzondale.-L. M. SMITH.
The valley of the Shenandoah presents a suc-
cession of the most various, sublime and beauti-
ful landscapes in the world. The Shenandoah,
which yet retains its ancient, beautiful, and
poetic indian name, springs among the magnifi-
cent rocks of the Cyclopean towers. These
towers, seven in number, rise to the height of
several hundred feet, like the ruins of some stu-
pendous ancient feudal castle, erected to guard
the passes of this magnificent valley. Flowing
on through a beautiful and fertile vale, hemmed
in by mountains, and supposed to have been
once the bed of an ancient lake with its high
and rocky banks, the Shenandoah passes Weir's
Oav-e, one of the greatest natural wonderAn the
new world, and quite worthy to be ranked, (says
an English tourist) with the Natural Bridge or
Niagara, and equal in dimensions, and in the
variety, beauty and sublimity of its objects, to
the celebrated Grotto of Antiparos. Still flowing
on,. the majestic river washes the Western pre-
cipices of the Blue Ridge, forming in its serpen-
tine course, islands and pr Jones, some high,
barren blasted, othei~s covered with beauti-
ful vend &amp; or crowned with lofty trees. Yet
flowing on, the mighty riven, gathering force
from every tributary, rushes with frightfully in-
creasing power and rapidity to meet the Poto-
mac, and with a god-tike strength to rend a pas.
sage through the mountains to the ocean.
'i'h~ stupendous sublimity of this awful scene
was said by Thomas Jefferson to be worth a
voyage across the Atlantic-when a voyage
across the ocean was an affair of six months.
But it is the Vale of Shannondale, the scene of

my present romance of r~al life, that I wish to
describe. A few miles below Harper's Ferry,
the Blue Ridge makes a curve, hemming in a
beautiful and fertile vale in the shape of a horse
shoe, whose opening is on the South. Within
the curve of the ridge, washing its base, and en-
circling the vale, rushes the Shenandoah. From
the river the ground rises gradually toward the
South Ttiis lovely spot combines enchanting
beauty with majestic sublimity. Hemmed in by
lofty mountains, and encircled by a rushing
river, shaded by groves of lofty trees, freshened
by springs .and fountains of sparkling water, fra-
grant with millions of wild flowers, and musical
with the voices of thousands of birds, it reulizes
the vision of the Rasselas' Happy VaPey.
Many years since, it does not matter how
many, stood on this favored spot an ancient man-
sion, one of the first erected in the valley of rue
Shenandoah.
The legend of its erection runs thus; In
the latter part of the reign of Elizabeth, during
the last persecution of the Catholics by thst
Princess, the head of a noble Catholic family m
Wiltshire, England, emigrated to Virginia. The
settlements were then all near the seacoast, or
upon the banks of James River and the~ Rappa..
hannock. All the country West of the Blue
Ridge was unknown. The valley of Virginia
was traversed by hordes of war-like savages,
who sometimes crossed the mountains and made
fearful and destructive descents upon thq.. ~n-
protected settlements, and whose veiy. yell.
were a horror. Soon after his arrival, Lord
Summerfield formed an exploring and hunting
party, who purposed crossing the mountain t
explore the country and to hunt the deer.
This boarding the lions in their dens was an
enterprise requiring great courage, ppidenee and
fortitude. Lord Summerfield possessed RU three
in an eminent degree. He set out with his party
fully equipped for several months exploring,
fighting or hunting, and after maty days of aIter~
nate travelling, sporting, skirmishing and rest
during which they had successfully evaded or
repulsed the savages who would have interrupted
their expedition, early in October they rea~shed
the sublime and beautiful Vale of 8h~bw~n

encircled by its sparkling river, and s~ut in by
its majestic mountains. Here astonished at the
stupendous grandeur, fascinated by the charming
beauty of the-landscape, delighted with the luxu-
riant fertility of the soil, and the exhilarating
purity of the climate, Lord Summerfield stand-
ing ul~on the lofty mountain on the North, and
looking down upon this scene of wonderful
beauty and grandeur, exclaimed,
"This is a spot to dare and do for! Here I
plant my family again! here I pitch my tent!
Here will I live, here die, and here be buried I"
The party continued their hunting and explo-
ring a few weeks longer, until the frosts and
keen winds of winter warned them to return to
the settlements, which they just reached by the
Christmas festivities.
Lord Summerfield was as good as his word.-
Immediately upon reaching home he commenced
preparations for emigrating thither in the spring.
His fellow colonists endeavored to dissuade him
from so hazardous a purpose, but in valn,-he
seemed possessed with the Vale of Shannondale
..Land neither the arguments or entreaties of his
friends, present difficulty, toil, privation, orpro-
spective danger and death could turn him from
his purpose. He contrived to rescue enough
from the wreck of his English estates to pur-
chase the laud from the savages, whose favor he
conciliated by two, with them, all powerful
means, naniely-by placing perfect confidence
in them, in coming to live so far from the settle-
ments~ alone, among them, and by making them
many useful and showy presents. He sent over
an agent to England, where under pain of death
he dared not return in person, to collect together
the scattered remnants of his property, to pur-
chase and ship to him building materials, house
furniture, hunting and farming implements, and
in short every thing that was needed to create a
civilized home in the grand and beautiful wilder-
ness upon which he had set his heart. Another
mission he entrusted to his agent, a letterof ten-
der farewell to his young and beautiful cousin
and betrothed bride living in Wiltshire, at Long-
ford Castle, under the care of her aunt, the
Marchioness of Northampton. His letter was
full of strength, tenderness and hopeful love. He
bade her wait in patience and in confidence until
he had made this wild and lovely vale "bloom
and blossom as the rose," until his house, his
gardens, and Ass parks in the new world should
equal in comfort and elegance her sumptuous re-
sjdence in the old one. Finally until the rapidly
growing country should be~sufficiently settle to
make it a safe retreat for ~r. Then he said he
would transplant his violet to the Vale of Shan-
nondale. Could he indeed expect the beautiful,
refined and cherished daughter of aristocratic
wealth and luxury to join him in his wild hunting
cabin. It never once entered his mind.
Viola, of Summerfield! the most fair and fm-t

gile looking human flower that ever bloomed its
day in the parterres of a palace conservatory I-
Expose her to a wilderness life! No! it was
not to be thought of. So said Lady Northamp-
ton when she had started Lord Summerfield to
America; and yet she was only thinking at that
time of the settlement! How much more dreadful,
then, the idea, had it ever presented itself to her,
of exposing Viola to the almost certainly fatal
toils, privations and perils of the fearful moun-
tain passes infested with savage beasts and more
savage men.
Viola, of Summerfield, was in her luxurious
bower at Longford Castle, when the letter from
her lover was placed in her hand. She caught
it with a bound of joy-it was the first time she
had heard from him since his departure. She
tore it open, and read it with a palpitating heart.
Then her eyes filled and overflowed with tears.
She folded it quietly up, and formed a resolu-
tion.
In the meantime, Lord Summerfield, upon the
Rappahannock, was impatiently waiting the re-
turn of the ship that was to bring out his cargo.
The spring opened, and he had not heard from
the vessel. At last, wishing to vget a small gar-
den under cultivation, that very season he set
out on horseback, attended by two hired men,
also mounted, for his valley estate, having left
orders that his agent should land the cargo, and
transport it in wagons to the spot selected for
building. It was as early as the first of March
when he set out,-it was near the last of the
same month that he found himself again in the
Vale of Shannondale. Already the snows had
melted oft the mountains, and the young grass
was springing in the valley, and the trees putting
forth young buds in the forest. He went to
work with his two men, and felled trees and
built a cabin of logs as a temporary shelter.-
Then~e began to hedge in a small garden, which
the two men prepared for the seed. Every day
as the spring advanced, revealed new beauties
in the charming landscape, and increased the
impatience ol Lord Summerfield to add all the
improvements of civilization and art to the
loveliness and grandeur of nature, The air
was populous with wild fowl, the forests filled
with game, and~ th aautiful river alive with
the finest fish. $ron ore an ed sand-
stone, a beautiful material for hull bound.
ed in the mountains, and springs of r~~eral wa-

he was chemist enough to appreciate, Wer~ free-
ly dispersed about the~ vale. Indeed, it seemed
that nature, in a fit of extravagant liberality,
had here lavished all her rarest and inos~t~j~stly
treasures. c~ was a land to die for !"~ And
Lord Summerfield worked like a day-laborer on
hire, to get it under cultivation, while he ani.
iously expected his teams.

reached the Villa on the Thames-she succeeded
in getting a private interview with the Queen,
who came, at her request, to visit her. Some-
thing frightful passed at that interview, I be.
lieve; at least my poor aunt died in great an-
guish soon after, and it is said that the Queen
has never held up her head since. Well, Ha-
rold, I found myself mistress of my own fortune
and person. As soon as [got over the shock
and grief of my dear aunt's death, I began to
think of communicating the news to you. I had
written a letter, and was waiting for a ship to'
carry it, when your letter arrived. I read it,
Harold, and I determined to put all my property
in cash, and to join you in the wilderness; dear
Harold, were we not betrothed, and had I not a
rsgkt to do so if 1 pleased? I told some of my
aunt's friends. They broke out against me as
unwomanly, indelicate; and, though I felt that
it was not as they said, yet I fee,~ed, that you
would think with them-but, you do not~ do
you, Harold? Do you think lightly of me for
following you out here?"
"My blessed saint! it were a blasphemy to
think an evil thought of you!" exclaimed Lord
Summerfield, fervently.
"Oh, please do not say such extravagant
things of me5 dear Harold! It mortifies me even
more than reproof would-because, alas !-I' am
so far from deserving commendation, still less
praise.~~
"You are beyond and above praise, my darling
Viola-go on with your narrative, dearest one."
"Well, Father White then had been ordered to
quit England, under pain of dhath, within ten
days; I concealed him at Longford Castle; he
was there when your letter came; I told him of
my project to join you in America-I asked his
counsel-and oh, Harold, I hung breathless upon
the words of his reply, for I have unbounded
confidence in his wisdom and goodness; and if
he had given his voice against my voyage-per.
baps, pet-kept, Harold, I should not have come-
perhaps nothing but your own summons would
then have brought me. But our reverend, and
most beloved friend, approved my decision-nay,
he applauded it, and blessed me from the fullness
of his joy, and told me that he would himself ac-
company me to America. Well, Harold, Father
White and myself had many consultations. He
knew several of your friends, who, persecuted in
England, wished to settle somewhere else. He
beld many secret conferences with them, the re-
suit of which was, that we formed a party from
our own neighborhood to come over, and here we
all are. We would have announced our inten-
tionAthad any ship been leaving England for
America; but our own, in which we came, was
really the first that left of the season. So here
we are, dear Harold-your tenants, your friends,

N DALE.
and your wife-but oh, Harold! you do not
blame me in your heart for ibis ?"
"My darling, darling girl, do you want me to
be an idolater; do you want me to fall at your
feet and adore you ?" said Summertield, embra-
cing her fondly.
The purple shades of evening were approaching
-the stars were coming out one by oae-the
dew was falling-the travellers descended the
hill to the spot where their wagons had been
left, and some took out the tents, carried them
up the hill, and pitched them, and some turned
the wagons down for sleeping places. During
all this time Lord Summerfield and Viola sat
under the old oak tree discoursing. The priest
again stood before them
"My children! there must be a marriage here
to-night! do you not know it? Have you not
thought of it? I have been waiting to receive
some communication upon the subject, and now
I have to break the matter myself; for well as
you love each other, I do not believe you have
thought of marriage this evening."
That was true. They had thought of nothing.
They were lost in the delight of merely meeting
and talking with each other again. That was
true, until now-but now the priest's words sent
an electric shock of ecstacy through every nerve
of Summerfield, and threw the delicate Viola i4l~
to a tremor of vague apprehension. Without a
word, however, Summerfield arose, and raising
Viola, and drawing her arm through his own, he
requested FathV White to summon his friends,
and follow him into the cabin.
Then and there they were married.
They lived in the log 'cabin about the cent~&amp;
of the vale. The other settlers selected farms
on the other side of the river, over the mounr
tains, or back into the depth ofthe forest, which
they began to cut down. The beautiful Vale of
Shannqpdale was left to the Summerfields. Tbe~
settlers did everything in their power to soften
the hard lot the fragile Viola had taken upon
herself when she became the wife of a pioneer.
As years passed, the bracing air and the fine
water of the mountains, so invigorated Viola,
that from being an extremely delicate girl she
was 4rowing to be a fine robust woman. In the
course of two years, a handsome and substantial
house of red sandstone was erected in the vale.
This house was furnished with far more taste
and elegance~than usually appertained to the
dwellings of the early settlers. But one child, a
handsome, hearty boy, named after his father,
Harold, blessed this happy marriage, and from
him were descended all the Summerfields, pro-
prietors of the vale, until 17-, when it came
into the hands of the last of that house And
this is the tradition of the early settlement of
the Vale of Shannondale.

SITIANNO
CHAPTER Ii.
THE OLD REDSTONE HOUSE.
That dear old home!
Something of old ancestral pride it keeps.
Though fallen from its early power and vastness,
The sun light seems to their eyes brighter there
Than wheresoever else.      hl(rs. Kem6 it.
I love to make you familiar with the localities
of our stories; the grounds about which our peo-
ple walked; the house in which they dwelt; .the
rooms in which tht~y lived and loved, or sinned
and suffered. 1 will strive to place 'Red-Stone
Hall, the seat of the Summerfields at Shannon-
dale, vividly before you. Pray assist me with
your own attention and imagination.
The house was situated about half-tray up the
gradually rising hill. Behind the house was the
dark and grim oldforest. Before the house, the
ground, green with verdure, and dotted with
groves of old forest trees, descended to the river,
that, rushing around with a sweeping curve,
forms the shape of a horse-shoe; across the river
tower the lofty mountains that shut in' the
vale.
The house itself was built after the manner of
most old Virginian mansions, with more massive
strength than elegance; more breadth than
height, and with more respect to convenience
than to appearances, and hence the result was,
greater durability, comfort, and pi~hturesque ef-
fect, than order and regulari. It had been
constructed of the rich and brilliant jed sand.
stone, found in the mountains. Its form was
square and narrows with a high-peaked roof-
its color, dark red. Its foundations had been
laid broad, deep, and strong, and upon them were
raised two stories, crowned by an attic, with dor-
inor windows.
It was surrounded by a low wall built also of
red sand-stone; in the centre of which, immedi-
ately in front of the house, was an iron gate that
opened upon a brick-paved rqad, shaded on each
side by elm trees, and which led straight up to
the front main entrance of the house, a substan-
tial portico.
This portico admitted into the wide passage
that ran through the middle of the house, dlvi.
ding it into equal parts. In the centre of the
back of 'this passage was the staircase, with its
broad and polished oak steps, and its balustrades
of mahogany, turning off in a scroll to the right
and left of the bottom step.
On thn right of this passage was situated first
the front drawing-room, whose windows looked
out upon the river and the mountains, including
the vale; and behind that, the large saloon, only
used for balls, &amp;c., and whose back windows
looked out upon the grim old pine forest behind
the house. These rooms had been recently fit-
ted up in handsome modern style.

NDALE                                  7
On the left of the passage was first the
front parlor, whose windows commanded the
same view with those of the front drawing-
room; next, the dining-room, and behind that,
the comfortable family sitting-room; it is to
this apartment that I shall soon introduce you.
The furniture of these rooms were old as the
house itself. Behind the house, and connected
with it by shaded piazzas, were wings; that on
the right containing the still-room, used for dis-
tilling herbs, essences, &amp;c., and for preparing
cordials, bounces, domestic wines, &amp;c. It was
filled with closets, in which these domestic trea-
sures were stowed away ;-the carding and
spinning-room-the weaving-room, &amp;c. That
on the left contained the pantry, the kitchen,
the scullery, and the laundry.
Scattered about in the forest, behind the house,
were the cabins of the negroes, who worked the
farm.
At the time our story opens, the only repre-
eentatives of the Summerfield family were Mrs.
Margary Summerfield, the widow of Harold liar..
dinge, the last of the Summerfields, and Imogene,
her only child-the heiress of that large estate.
At this time Imogene Summerfield was finishing
her education at the convent school of George-
town. The August holidays were at hand when
she was expected to leave school permanently,
and great preparations were being made at Red-
Stone Hall for her reception. It was in honor
of this event that the drawing-room and saloon
had been splendidly re-furnis~he A ball and
supper was to celebrate the co~iiing out of the
young and beautiful heiress of the once noble
house of Summerfield.
Mrs. Summerfield had invited party of young ~
people to Red-Stone Hall to welcome he~r daugh...
ter upon her return home-among them~were her
niece, Winifred Darling, the only daughter of
her only brother, Squire Darling, of Oak Grove,
with her companion or humble friend, Sinai
Hinton, and Harriette Joy, the niece of the old
priest, Father Burleigh, who for fifty years had
ministered at the altar of the Catholic Chapel of
the Sacred-Heart
This party of young people deserve farther
notice than I have given them. First, Miss
Darling, or Winny Darling as she was fondly
called by her young friends, was the loveliest
and most loving little creature that ever blessed
a doting father's heart.
She was his only child-a loive chjld, the
child of his adored wife, who had given this
angel life at the price of her own..
Far back of the old hail at Oak Grove there
was a marble monument-it was the tomb of
Angela Darling.
Squire Darling had wished to name his little
daughter after his lost angel, but his mother,

SHANNONPALE.               9

Oak Grove was a fine old baronial-looking
residence. The hall stood in the midst of a
grove of gigantic forest oaks, which gave their
name to the homestead. There wa~ no under-
growth, and the gass was green and smooth as
velvet-so that even in the Autumn the~ deep
shade of the magnificent trees was healthful as
pleasant. Fine orchards, fine gardens, 'and well
cultivated fields, surrounded Oak Grove. The
estate was the best stocked with cattle in the
whole country-while a stable of thorough-bred
and well-trained horses and a kennel of the
finest hounds formed the delight of the squire.
The cabins of the negroes who worked the
plantation were apart by themselves, in a green
glen. The little houses were built ten on each
side of the road, thus forming a street. They
were all uniform, painted white, and with one
door between two windows in front, painted red.
Each had its little garden behind, and its apple,
pear, or peach tree shading in front. At the
head of this street, crossing it at right angles
and facing down it, was the overseer's house.
This was also white with red doors and win-
dow-shutters-but it was larger and more com-
modious than the others, and it had a piazza and
a flower-yard in front, and a larger garden be-
hind. The overseer was an old colored man, an
attached servant of the family, whose father and
grandfather had belonged to the Darlings. Like
most other Virginia negroes he had assumed his
master's family name, and called himself Squire
Darling. His baptismal name ~as Achilles, but
the family called him Uncle Kill. From sun-
rise to sunset, except two hours for breakfast
and two hours for dinner, Uncle Kill's duties of
overseer kept him in the field, where he was a
perfect bug-a-boo to a lazy hand. The rest of
the time Uncle Kill preached the Gospel, played
the fiddle, told fortunes, tracked the coon, or
made himself otherwise useful or agreeable.
Uncle Kill had a wife near his own age, called
Minerva, but whose celestial name, the bad
taste of the household had be-devilled as it had
that of her lord, Achilles. They called her
"Nerve." And this was no misnomer, she
was a woman of great nervous energy. (It is a
pity, by the way, that this word "nervous," in
the same relations, expresses such opposite
meanings-for the laborer's, "nervous
means his great strong powerful Ic
while Miss Fanny Faintaway's" ualis~bs"
means her weak, trembling, ailing, fainting~
members.) Nerve was a woman of strong body,
strong affectie strong opinions, and strong
methods of cx sing them-.-strong will, and a
strong way of expressing it. Nerve's office on
the plan - , was a general supervision of the
spinning, ing, knitting and other women's
work; and she was as efficient in her way, as
Uncle Kill was in his.
When Sina Ilinton arrived at Oak Grove, the

fine old hall, the grand old forest-trees, the
wealth of the estate with its negroes, its fields,
gardens, orchards, and stock of every descrip..
tion, excited her admiration and provoked her
envy-admiration of the estate, envy 01) its
heiress. Such a set of feelings could not arise in
a strong, subtle, and unprincipled nature like
hers, without sooner or later becoming the mas-
ter motives of her actions. She watched the
favorable points of her position, and resolved to
take the greatest advantage of every one. For
"Why should this silly, simpering, cooing little
fool have all this great plantation, and I, her
cousin, have none ?" she said. The respect with
which she was treated by Madam Winifred and
the squire-the aflectio~ate confidence reposed
in her by Winny, the esteem she had won from
the tutor, a ore available for her purposes, and
most of all w the deep unspoken love that her
keen subtilty perceived to exist between Edgar
Ardenne, the tutor, and Winny Darling. "If
this foolish attachment should provoke her fa-
ther to disinherit her-at least the chance is not
bad. The very fervor of her father's love for
Winny, if that love were abandoned for a passion
for another, and outraged by disobedience in
marrying that other against his consent-yes I

Sina Hinton had arrived in July. It was the
latter part of the month that Miss )arling and
herself were invited to make a visit to Red-
Stone Hall, to be there to welcome Miss Sum-
merfield, the cousin of the latter, to her home.
The distance from Oak Grove to Red-Stone
Hall was fifteen miles; but with their fleet
horses the Oak Grove family frequently rode it
early in the morning, dined, supped, and' re- -
turned in the evening; sometimes by moonlight
or starlight; and nothing could be more delight-
ful than those fine night rides through the fresh,
green, dark forest, after the heat of an oppres-.

ness of the evening breeze-tbe brightness of the
wonderful stars-the vague, romantic dimness of
the forest aisles-all conspired to refresh the
nerves and inspire the minds.
84 Hinton, the astute girl, had noticed the
effect of these forest night rides-and she always
took care to drop behind or ride on before, ma-
king the excuse that the path was not wide
enough for three equestrians .-and thus she
would give the lovers every opportunity of im~
proving the romance, and yielding to the tempta-
tion of the hour. It was in vain though as yet,
their affection was too childlike, too simple, con-
fiding and happy, to inspire the wish for a
change. And it was this that made Sina Hinton
exclaim in her vexatioff against the apathy of
the lovers.
It was this that made her resoI~re to bring
about a denouement.
It turned out to be a very sultry day, that upon
*      wiuich Miss Darling had intended to set out for
*      Red-Stone Hall. Miss Hinton proposed that they
should defer it until evening, and take the ride
through the forest by starlight. This was
agreed upon-and accordingly, after tea Winny
kissed her grandmother, who promised soon to
join her at Shannondale, and kissed her father,
who pledged his word to follow the next day,
and went down to the quarters and took an af-
fectionate leave of her "old women," as she
called all the superannuated negresses whose
comfort was her peculiar care-and accompa-
nied by Sina Hinton and attended by Edgar
.44 ~rdenne, set out for her ride. Sina Hinton drop~
ped behind as usual; and again as usual the
child-like lovers dropped into a reverie, broken
only by low toned observations by one of them
and a soft assent by the other! They reached
the Vale of Shannondale and Red-Stone Hall by
ten o'clock-and there they found assembled
Father Burleigh, the aged priest, her niece, Har-
riette or Harry Joy, and lastly, Colon4Henry
Lee Dungerfield, a relation of the Suminerfield
family,:dnd the owner of the largest estate in
the neighborhood. He was an officer of the
army, who had distinguished himself in the re-
cent war of the Revolution-and had now return-
ed to private life covered with military glory.
Miss Summerfield had been betrothed to him
ever since she was an infant and he a lad. She
had grown in beauty by his side, and he had
loved her in a gentle, domestic way, and was ac-
customed to think of her as his future wife. She
had left home at fifteen years of age, and he had
not seen her for three years. He had as a mat-
ter of course been invited to Red4tone Hall to
welcome tier. Mrs. Summerfield, leaving re-

carriage, attended by her own servants. There!.
fore the precise hour of her return was uncer-
tain-but ten o'clock struck, and she had not
come; eleven struck, and still no sound of car-
riage wheels disturbed the silence; at twelve
o'clock the company gave her up for the night,
and retired to bed. The next night was the
time appointed for the grand ball that was to
celebrate Miss Summerfield's coming out.

Early the next morning the guests assembled
at Shannondale, met in the piazak-that right
hand front piazza that commanded the slope of
the grove-shaded hill as it rolled to the river, of
the rushing circular5 sweep of the river, and of the
surrounding towering mountains. Right across
the river, opposite to them, was the Lover's
Leap-a bold perpendicular rock, with a wild
Indian legend connected with it.
"Who knows the story ?" inquired Sina Hin.
ton.
"Every one knows it, but no one tells it but
Father Burleigh, and he never tells it in any other
place but the summit of the rock," replied Col.
Lee Dangerfield.
Sina Hinton sauntered, swayed and undulated
up to the side of Father Burleigh, and said in
her mellifluous, coaxing tones-
"Oh! Father Burleigh, will you not form a
party over to Lover's Leap to-day and tell the
story? I do so love those wild legends--and I
should so delight to get a view of this vale from.
that prominence."
Father Burleigh. was about to decline, upon
the score of his infirmities and the fatigue of as-
ce the hill, but Sine's large, dark, pleading
eye         ed on his own, and there was no
resisting th   He said that he would do so
"with pleasure," if it were agreeable to the rest
of the company.
"Of course it will be agreca to the rest of
the party," exclaimed Harriett oy. "Let us
go, uncle; Mts. and Miss Summerfield will not
be here till night now, and I want d oppor-
tunity for a sentimental flirtation -I know
who!"
"Will you never be steady, Harry-never de-
port yourself like a lady," whispered the priest.

SHAWNO
"Never while you abbreviate my pretty a
of Harriette to Harry! It makes me feel like
a boy !" laughed Harriette, as she placed a
strawhatjauntilyupob her head; and in fact with
her roguish black eyes, laughing lips, and clus-
tering curls, her mirthful countenance, half in
dark shadow from the rim of the hat, half in
light from the kissing of the sunshine, Harry Joy
looked like a sauey-a very saucy boy, and no-
thing else.
"I could fall desperately in love with that
little imp !" mused Colonel Lee Dangerfield, as
he leaned against a pillar of the piazza and con-
templated Harry-" she has just eccentricity
enough to bewilder all one's senses; but this will
not do. I must take my eyes off."
But taking his eyes off and keeping his eyes
off the handsome swaggering4aoyden was not so
easy-he disapproved of Harry from his soul-.-.
he was sorely dissatisfied with himself at the
anomaly of the very peculiarities he so thorough-
ly condemned, attracting him most forcibly.
Harry was the priest's niece-that was her pass-
port into good society-otherwise she was poor,
uneducated, r~'ther rude, but withal possessing
a hearty, joyous, genial nature, that made her
the soul of any frolic that was afoot.
"You must excuse her, gentlemen! You must
excuse her," said t~e priest, "she has never had
the benefit of female culture, .and a single man, 1
even a priest, is unfit to bring up a girl."
"Well, then, uncle, that pr'~yes the evil of 1
your clerical celibacy! You ought to have got
married like an honest member of society, and
then I should have been your daughter and not
your niece !" speaking to the priest, but letting
fly a couple of arrows from her dark eyes at I
Colonel Lee Dangerfield. s
The priest started, grew pale, looked search-
ingly, steadily, severely into the face of his niece, t
but Barry's eyes were dancing with those of ii
Colonel Lee Dangerfield, and she seemed to have v
forgotten her light words. A bitter, bitter t
groan, suppressed at the lips, murmured deep a
down the bosom of the old priest, and he fell o
into a deep gloom. He checked Harry's rude- tl
ness no morn~that morning.                 fi
"Miss S&amp;Irimerfield, of Red-Stone Hall, will v
have to watch her betrothed," said Sina flinton, g
to herself-Sina Hinton always spoke truth when a]
she spoke to herself, and seldom at any other iv
time; "and Herriette Joy is as much the niece t~
of the priest as I am~the nephew of my mother! ti
I have your secret, Father Burleigh, and that is fo
another favorable point in my destiny-so much b
for keeping my eyes open." . of
Overflowing with exuberant life, Harry Joy th
had whirligigged out of the piazza, and Col. pi
Lee Dangerfield was about to follow, when the ~
sound of carriage wheels were heard below, and
soon the travelling chariot of Mrs. Summerfield ~1
rolled slowly up the hill, approached and pause4 r~

and stepped forward with a Queen.like air of

"What a magnificent woman is Mrs. Sum.

a swan's, an eye like an eagle's, a mien
like a monarch's! Heavens I-if I had a form
and face like that, I could do what I pleased
with it I-but Imogene-Miss Summerfield-the
heiress I-let's see what she is like I" comment-
ed Sine Hinton, as she watched the carriagedoer.
Miss Suminerfield alighted, and passed quickly~
through the hail, and entered the house-hel'
figure muffled in a large black silk shawl; her
face hidden by a black lace veil.
'~ She is either ugly or very beautiful. She is
either ashamed of her face, or she saves it for a

They say she was beautiful when she left home

All the guests were waiting impatiently for
he breakfast-bell to ring, when they should
neet at table the heiress of Red-Stone Hall, in
rhose honor they were assembled. The innsk

"Miss Summerfield cannot have the pleasure
of meeting her friends until the evening," replied
the lady. And then the morning meal com-
menced.
It was a breakfast set out with magnificence-
gold and silver plate, and Sevres China flashing
in the light; and all the superabundant luxuries
of the spot and season abounding. The finest
milk,. cream, butter, and eggs, for the dairy and
poultry-yards of Shannondale were unrivalled-
fresh fish from the Shenandoah, game from the
forest, and wild fowl from the air, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.
After breakfast the party formed for Lover's
Leap. The horses were brought to the door.
The party mounted, and cantered off down the
hill to the river-a ferry-boat took them across
-and they began to ascend the opposite moun-
tain by a circuitous back path.
Bina Hinton, contrary to her usual custom,
kept near Miss Darling. "What a venerable
looking man is Father Burleigh, my love," she
~ ~.&amp;id to Winny, "with his silver hair, and reve-
rend countenance, he reminds me what St. Paul
~.. might have been in his old age."
"Yes! desr Father Burleigh! but I am so
sorry that he is so infirm! What a pity It is
that people we love should grow old and become
infirm."
"Ab, but he approaches a better and a hap-
pier world," replied Miss Hinton, in the usual
stereotyped words.
"Yes, but we don't want any better or hap.
:pier world than this. If the Lord would please
to let us, I should like to live a hundred million
~of centuries, on this very earth, with all my
dear friends around me, and would never, never,

"Oh, that is very wicked, my dear-but to re-
- turn to Father Burleigh-he has been here a
long time I"

here as sacristan first of all-then here he was

"Yes! 'who is she? Where did she come
front?"
*" Well, she is the~daughter of his deceased
sister or somebody, and he brought her from
away down in Maryland somewhere."
"Has Father Burleigh always remained here,
and never been abroad?"
Yes-once; he was away two years,
on the Chesapeake near' the ol~tation of Mount
'Carmel, in Marylaul~l. It was a year~ftp his

return to this neighborhood, that he received a
notice of his sister's death, and he went and
fetched home her child, Rarriette, and he put
her in charge of his housekeeper; she has been
with him many years, and now keeps house for
him."
"Urn-rn-hum-rn," again murmured Sina; then
she suddenly inquired-" How old is Father
Burleigh? quite aged, isn't he 7"
"Oh, yes I very, very, old-almost seventy."
"Is it possible!" exclaimed Miss Hinton, with
surprise.
" Yes! is not tlsat old 7"
Sina smiled.
"Why, my dear, 1 supposed him to be eighty
-he looks that. I could not make some
things out either at that rate-but, my little
love, how old is his niece?"
"Harry Joy is twenty-five-but few take her
to be so old; many people think her about
twenty."
"U-rn-rn-rn," replied Sina.
I wish Icould give the reader an idea of the low,
slow, cooing murmur with which that "U-in
rn-me," was floated out. It was pue of Sina's
fascinations-it expressed besides anaffirmative,
love, sympathy, comfort, consolation-only Sina
was so fond of it, that she used it it place, and
as now, out of place-always instead of yes-
like her undulating motion, it was a characteris.-
tic of her.
"You may ride on, now, love, and join Ar-
denne, who is waiting for us at the summit. I
must stop here to arrange my habit a little"-
and Winny, without hesitation, ambled forward
to join her tutor.
The party dismounted at the summit of the
mountain, and walked forward through a tangled
thicket of stunted pines and cedars, and over~
jagged rocks, to the front of the precipice, where
the lover's rock ascended in a ,bold perpendicu-
lar from the river. They seated themselves upon

the central seat. The view from this summit
was sublime, bordering upon the terrific. Be-

Fand amphitheatre of ~hannondaIe, encompassed
on three sides with a crescent-shaped ridge of

Lover's Leap. Below them, at the distance of
several hundred feet, rushed the rapid Shenan'-
doah, filling up the pauses in the conversation
with its roar; ~he vale rising from its banks
rolled off in green undulations shaded with
groves of trees, towards the forest in the back
ground. Half way up the ascent stood old Red-

Byron.
Manyvery many years ago, when this property
was in the hands of Bushrod Summerfield, thi
grandson of Lord Summerfield, the first settler
there came to this part of the country a young
Englishman of high rank, and ~f great wealth,
He was a Colonel in the Hussars, from inclina-
tion to a' martial life, rather than from the
'necessity' of entering the profession. He is said
to have ~bhen a very handsome man, of tall and
commanding stature, with high Roman features,
fired by the light of a falcon eye, and softened
by an abundance of raven ringlets. His manner
-his gestures-the tones of his voice possessed
that marvellous fascination, that compelled the
love-the adoration of all who knew him. Colo-
nel Clinton had come out only to see the coun-
try, at tbe invitation of Bushrod Summerfield,
who, having been sent to England for educa
tion, had formed an acquaintance with Clinton
at Oxford.
Of course, Colonel Clinton became the guest
of Squire Surnmerfield. At this period, a rem-
nant of the tribe of Shenandoah Indians dwelt
on the other side of the mountains, with their
wandering mode of life. They had a reserved
privilege of fishing at a certain place in their
own ancestral river. The head of this tribe
was a woman-Lulu,'the daughter of the great
chief, Worneo.at-akuk.
"But I did not know that a wo~nan ever
reigned over an Indlau tribe-'X *ho~igIit their

y women were generally degraded," said Sina
s, Hinton.
"They are, generally, but not universally,
g and not so much formerly as now. We see by
e the chronicles of the early settlement of the
a country, that the custom prevailed to some ex-
e tent. Lulu was a grand, wild forest girl, of that
d dark, rich, luxurious style of beauty never seen
y in the most beautiful of the Caucasian race
her form was tall and majestic, but beautifully
proportioned-a small, but regal head, an arched
and undulating neck, a fine, high breast,
rounded limbs, tapering towards the delicate
wrists and ankles, and small and elegantly she-
ped feet and hands ;-such her form~ Her fea-
tures were of the Jewess style-her complexion
was dark, but singularly clear, and deepened
into a rich crimson in the rounded cheeks and
full and arched lips. Her eyes were large and
dark, full of liquid fire-fierce and soft, as airger
or tenderness possessed her; her eyebrows were
very black and heavy, her eyelashes long, thick 4
and black, and her hair rolled in shining waves
of purplish black nearly to her feet She usually
wore a superb dress of fine scarlet cloth, richly
and beautifully embroidered with various colored
beads, silks, and gold and silver threads, end
fringed with variegated feathers. Her dress
was short, and confined to her waist by a belt,
in which were stuck one or two elegantly.

settlers.) Her neck, arms and legs were bere;
three or four rov~s of bright beads decked her
throat, and heavy gold and silver bracelets en..
circled her wrists and ankles. Her purplish
lockS, twined with many a gem, hung far below
her waist. The fame of the wondrous beauty
of the Queen of the Shenandoahs had gone all
over the whole settlement; and by the braves of
her own tribe, the beautiful Lulu was loved,
adored, worshipped as a goddess, with all the
wild enthusiasm of savage idolatry. Her hand
had been' sought 'in marriage by the chiefs of
other tribes, but Lulu had never felt a throb of
love. She seemed something set apar~'and sa-
cred,-the vestal Queen rejected all these offers,
with proud and high disdain. -
One day there was a great hunt upon the moun-
tains; Squire Summerfield and Colonel Clinton
I joinedinit. The foxafterrunningacircuitofthfr..

Ilorse, came thundering on, and took th~ leap-

p.4 short at the brink of the precipice, and now
they set up a fearful wail. Other hunters rode
up, but seeing no signs of a catastrophe, suspect-
ed none, supposing that Colonel Clinton had, upon
losing the quarry, taken another road.
Colonel Clinton's brain had reeled and he had
lost his senses at the moment the fearful leap
was taken-when he recovered them he found
himself lying on a pallet of delicate furs, in a tent
hung on the inside with fine yellow cloth richly
embroidered with silver thread. The setting
sun was pouring a flood of golden light through
the opening into the tent, which bathed the dark,
bright, glorious form of the Indian queen who
stood in its full blaze. Colonel Clinton strove to
collect his thoughts. It was some time before
he could recollect what had happened. At last
he did; and then beckoning to the dark beauty,
who immediately approached him, he said-
"I know what has occurred. I guess where I
am-but-by what miracle was I saved I"
The Queen of the Shenandoahs replied in bro-
ken English-" broken music"-that her braves
were out upon the river in their canoes fishing-
that they had seen the fatal leap-that the horse
was dashed to pieces at the foot of the precipice,
but that Ins had been eataght between the strong
forks of a projecting tree a few feet from the
summit-that, her braves had climbed the rock,
rescued him, and brought him to their encamp-
ment. Clinton tound that both his arms had been
broken by the fall, but that they were set, splin-
tered, and bound up with great skill, also, that his
body was severely bruised. But Clinton thought
*not of his wounds and bruises-his whole soul was
flooded with an excess of glory and of beauty
that he could scarcely bear and live-languid,
prostrate and helpless as he was, the approach
of the dark, bright, luxurious Indian beauty,
threw all his senses into a delirium of excite-
ment that threatened the stability of his reason.
He recovered rapidly, but he had no wish to quit
his quarters. Heedless of the anxieties of his
friends, he avoided informing them of his where-
abouts, lest they should disturb him in his delici-
ous life of blended ecsttrcy and anguish. You
will anticipate the result. He, with his glorious
beauty, grace and eloquence wooed and won the
fierce and beautiful forest queen.
Ah, tlie tigress grew as gentle as the doe-the
queen became the slave! Her warriors saw with
a fierce and bitter jealousy the growing weak-
ness of their queen-the discrowning of their
goddess. They assembled round their council
* fires and talked-they went to her and expostu-
lated-in vain! in vain! She did not heed or
even hear them! her soul was absorbed in one
idea-one life! her senses all bound up in one
ecstatic trance! They met again in council, and
* after a deliberate, long talk they decided that the
white intruder should leave their encampment
~ twenty-four hours at the peril *f his life.

)NDALE.
This decision was conveyed to Clinton the same
evening. He assente&amp;very calmly. And she!
she left her Indian crown-she left her glorious
heritage of independence, of love, of worship,
and of power, and followed like a slave the
foot-steps of her chosen master when he bade
her follow! A hut in the depths of the forest
received the English officer and his Indian mis-
tress. He supplied his wants and hers by hunt-
ing and fishing. She cooked his meals apd serv-
ed him fondly. This you know could not last
long-the highly educated, highly accomplished,
elegant and fastidious Reginald Clinton, the
flower of the young English aristocracy, could
not long content himself with a savage, however
attractive she might be. After the first ecstatic
shock sent to his heart by her dark electric beauty
had subsided, his passion waned. And after he
had ceased to love her, her very tenderness, hu-
mility and submission only disgusted and revolt-
ed him; he determined to leave her. Reginald
Clinton had nil a fine gentleman's abhorrence of
"a scene." He resolved to evade one, so one
day he took leave of Luin as if for a day of hunt-
log, and he never saw her but once more. He
turned his steps towards Shannondale, where he
arrived late in the afternoon. Squire Summer-
field received him with surprise and joy as one
from the dead. He told them the story of his
rescue by the Indians and of his sojourn, among
them-but he said nothing of [~ulu. Squire Sum-
merfield introduced him to his young sister, Rose
Summerfield, for her exceeding beauty called the
"Rose of Shannondale." She had just returned
from France where she had been educated, and
had arrived at Red Stone Hall during the absence
of Colonel Clinton. Very lovely was the Rose
of Shannondale-with her hebe-like style of
beauty, her exquisite form, her fair complexion,
with its sudden blushes-her deep blue eyes,
with their' meek droop, and the clustering auburn
tendrils that contrasted so brightly with her
snowy forehead and roseate cheeks. Clinton
was thrown constantly in her society, and he
found her mind and heart richly cultivated and
beautiful as her person. He loved her-not
with that passionate delirium of attraction that
had bound him to Luiu; but with a profound and
tender affection founded upon deep esteem; and
an affection that might have possessed redeem-
ing power for him but for his sins against Lulu.
A few weeks passed and Reginald Clinton was
the accepted lover of Rose Summerfield, and
their marriage day was fixed. Splendid prt~pa.
rations were made. The fame of the magnifi-
cence, of the approaching bridal spread all ever
the country. A vast number of relatives and
friends were invited. The marriage day came.
Evening drew on. The guests assembled.-
Night was turned to day with the splendor of th~
iiluminations. The marriage ceremony was over
and the company were all in the saloon. Many

There were about two hundred guests ezpect-
3d, and as the shades of night fell, they began to
arrive.
The whole front of the hall was one sheet of
illnmination-the whole extent of the lwwn a
grove of carriages. Numerous grooms, coach-
men, and other servants and attendants of the
visitors, filled up the piazzas and the passages.
The great saloon was thrown open-a magnifi-
cent spectacle! The dark and polished oak of
the paunelled wall, relieved by large and costly
paintings of old artists, all of a character at
once scriptural and festal-as "The Feast of
the Tabernacle," "The Marriage of Cana,"
"David Dancing Before the Ark of God,"
"The Prodigal Son's Festival," &amp;c. These
pictures were large a.s life-three on each side
of the room-and garlanded with festoons of
flowers. The spaces between them were filled
up alternately with statues, holding immense
wax candles, and immense vases, filled with
flowers. The curtains at the windows, the
sofa, ottoman,~'and chair-covers, were all of rich
purple damask, fringed with gold. A gallery at
upper end of the saloon held the band.
A central chandelier, with a thousand pendant
crystals, hanging from the ceiling, poured down
a shower of various-colored light, filling the
vast saloon with radiance. At the, appointed
hour of reception, the doors were thrown open,
and the band struck up a fine, inspiring strain of
music. The saloon soon began to fill. It was
whispered about that the "Three Belles of Shan-
nondale" were to be present. Two of them
were seated side by side on one of the short
sofas. A perfect contrast were these two beau-
ties-Harry and Winny. Harry, with her wick-
ed black eyes, and her clustering curls, kinking
like grape-tendrils, in short, spiral, glistening
black ringlets around her broad, white, boyish
brow-Harry, with her richly mantling, bright
carnation bloom, and her saucy arched lips, and
arrayed in her showy dress of blue and gold
changeable satin, and frisking her saucy fan,-
and Winny, with her soft, dark-blue, tender
eyes, and her long, smooth, pale gold ringlets,
drooping down her fair forehead and delicate
peach-blossom cheeks-Winny, with her simple
white silk dress, and little p~sey of pinks.
Winny had no fan-she said that Harry Joy
raised wind Onough for them both. Near them
stood the queen of the festival-the beauty and
the heiress-Imogene Summerfield-receiving
her company. She was supported on one side
by the presence of her mother; on th~ other, by
that of her betrothed husband.
Imogene Snmme;field!-how shall I describe
her wondrous, her divine beauty? 1 feel that
my steps are on holy ground as I approach her.
Her form was above the middle height, ele-
gantly proportioned, and arrayed in a richly
embroidered black lace robe, worn over White

satin. The effect of this dress was singularly
beautiful. She wore no ornament, except her
own long, black, splendid hair, that fell in three
divisions of massive ringlets, far below her
waist: one down her shoulders, behind, and two
brought forward, and flowing down in waves of
jet each side of her bosom. Her forehead was
high and fair; her eye-brows black; slender, and
arched; her eye-lashes black, long, and thiek-4
but her eyes-her large, dark, glorious eyes I-
so profound in their interminable depths of
meaning I-inlets to an unfathomable spirit-
world within. She received her guests with a
native grace and dignity; yet withal, a halt ab-
stracted air-as she r!~sed her long eye-lashes,
the light slowly returned to her shadowy eyes,
as though the spirit was recalled from a distance.
"And her smile it seemed half holy,
As if drawn from thoughts more rare
Than ourcorumon jestings are"
There was something of reverence in the
admiration she insp~red. There was some-
thing of veneration even in the tone and manner
of her dignified and gracious mother, as she ad-
dressed her. She did not dance. You could not
imagine her taking part in the lively cotiions-
she did not dance-but when the solemn, half
martial, half dirge-like march of the minuet was
played, then, at the earnest request of Colonel
Dangerfield, seconded by her mother, she gave
him her hand to walk the stately minuet. A
suppressed murmur of admiration, mingled with
awe, floated around the room as the queenly
form of Miss Summerfield sailed on in the ma-
jestic measure. Colonel Pangerfield, also, hand-
some and gallant-looking in his superb uniform,
received his share of admiration from the ladies.
At the termination of the august dance, Coloup~
Dangerfield, with a suave and stately courtesy~
conducted his partner back to her seat, ~owed
profoundly, and remained standing by her side.
Miss Summerfield did not dance again, nor did
Colonel Dangerfield leave her side again that
evening, though from time to time his attention
was distracted by the musical laughter or the
merry looks of Harry Joy.
Quadrilles again followed the minuet, and
Harry Joy bore off the palm in that lively mea-
sure.
"Her feet beat witchcraft as sne led the dance."
Waltzing succeeded, and Winny Darling excel-
led in that charming, half caressing whirl.-
Many people were surprised that Miss Darling
waltzed-a young lady carefully reared as she
had been by her grandmother-but Winny was
entirely tee pure-minded to dream that any one
saw hitrm in waltzing. She waltzed with her
tutor only.

~' Miss Hinton and Mr. Ardenne you are both
welcome back! I am glad to see you!"
'tue whole party retired to change their dress
for dinner.
Squire Darling followed, with a crotchet in his
head. There was a little vein of romance in the
broad strata of benevolence in his composition.
This sometimes led him to jump to conclusions,
not always correct. Miss Hinton and Mr. Ar-
denne happened to be conversing in a very conil-
dential strain when they rode up together; when
they dismounted, Winny, as has been seen, had
run forward to meet her father, and Mr. Ardenne
had given his arm up the steps to Sins, and they
continued their confidential talk until Squire
Darling turned to them. Now Squire Darling
had noticed this, and imagined there was a
love affair existing between the tutor and the
companion! He liked this! this suited him! it
assimilated with the warm geniality and hon
hommie of his temper-it seemed to him very
proper and fitting. Sina is a frank, sincere,
brave girl, and Ardenne is a most estimable
youth; poor things! I dare say now they are
looking forward to many, many years of waiting
before they think they can marry-they are so
destitute! but it shall not be so; I will be their
providence; I will set him up in business, and
they shall be married as soon as they please;
for, by St. Peter, life is too short to be passed in
waiting! but I must see mother first about it."
And as the visitors were all in their private
apartments preparing for dinner, the squire
having an hour of relaxation from hospitable
duties, went to see his mother in her room up
stairs. He found the old lady deep in the perusal
of the "Mysteries of Udoipho." Madam Wini-
fred was a tall, thin, wasted old lady, with a
long, pale, tbin face, with a mild expression.-
Sne wore a black silk dress, with a white mus-
lin inside handkerchief folded over her bosom,
and a white muslin cap, beneath which her sil-
ver hair was parted neatly over her brow. She
looked so clean, pure, gentle and dignified. It
was the dignity of age and goodness rathe'i than
of pride, or even of wisdom. The old lady was
a devoted Christian, though a bigoted Catholic;
and now at sixty.five she was as full of romance
as her grand-daughter of sixteen; yet it was the
high toned and elevating chivalry of romance
akin to religion, and it is to be presumed that it
was from her the squire derived the romantic
alloy in the pure gold of his own sound nature. I
have before mentioned the perfect family har-
mony and unity that existed between the houses
of Oak Grove and Red-Stone; I will now in-
form you that the love and confidence between
this mother and son were perfect.
"Good-morning, dear mother, what have you

"Yes, ma'am. Mother! I have found out a

eyes looking very solemnly over her spectacles.
Winny! pooh! Winny's a baby, in love with
milk and bread! As for Miss Summertield-for
by my life I never feel familiar enough with my
niece to call her Imogene-as for Miss Scm-
merfield, she is enamoured of an arch-angel
in the seventh heavers, perhaps! No, I speak
of Sina and the tutor-they love each other,
poor children, and they can never marry unless
we help them."
"How help them?" inquired Madam Winifred,
whom this news did not by any means startle,
she having foreseen it. "How can we further
the wishes of the poor young lovers?
"'Money makes the mule go'-there is
scarcely an enterprise in this world that money

"More the pity that we should       the

"Yet, God forgive my levity!" said ire,
with one of his sudden changes from lightness to
solemnity -" May lied forgive my levity.

-cannot cure! the loss of my adored wife; and
there is one good-one God-given good-the
possession of my darling, my blessed, my ido-

father, with deep emotion.
Ah! Squire Darling, mone2,1 did not purchase
your treasure, nor can the want of money de-
prive you of her. But-the pride of birth-the
pride of rank-the pride of wealth-the inso-
lence of power-the selfishness of love-the
vengeance of jealousy-these will banish your
love-angel from you!
"Yes, you wrong your better nature, when
you speak so lightly, my dear son. But what do
you intend to do in the premises."
"I intend to have an interview with Sina this

He led her into the dining-room, and plac
her at table, where the rest of the comnpa:
were already assembled. Winny was ther
looking pale and -anxious, yet uncertain ni
mystified, as if she felt the storm in the air, bi
could not see from what point the cloud arose.
Ardenne was the last to enter; placing tI
bouquet in a flower-stand until it might be wan
ed, he took his accustomed seat at the board.-
rhe squire greeted him with an excess of cou:
tesy, amounting to insult Ardenne, as ti
tutor, gave precedence to all the gentlemen c
that side, and sat on the last seat of the row, aa
nearest that of the squire, who presided at fti
least.
"1 have been seeking you, sir," he said.
"I am at your command, sir," replied Ai
denne.
"I am advised of the honor you intend me !~
said the squire.
Ardenne bowed with grave and stately con:
tesy in reply, and the squire, somewhat modifie
by his manner, or recollecting himself as a Vi:
giniasi, a gentleman and a host, returned th
bow, and gave his attention to other things.-
Ardenne sa~ there-but he could not eat-~

and feigned with his knife and fork, to avoi

"Leave the table, Miss Darling !" saidher
father, with a severe frown, hut in a low tone-
gr~atily fearing that her agitation would draw
enrion, and dreading a scene. Winny, tram-
hung, arose aiid left the table. Ardenne arose
with a fierce but steady gaze into the eyes of the
squire, and followed her.
"What is the matter ?" inquired Madam Wini-
fred.
"Nothing! nothing! but that Miss ~Darling

"Death and d-n, sir I she loves you no.1!-

self-control--all sense of decency and propriety,
the squire lroke forth into the most violent and
shameful torrent of invective and abuse-and
concluded by thundering,
"Get out of my house, sir? or by all that's
holy, I sj~sIl kick you out I,'
Livid with the rage suppressed for Winny's
sake, the young man turned and left the study,
and soon after left the house. The squire sank
down into his chair, and wiped and wiped again
the perspiration from his brow, his heart throb-
bing as if it would choke him. This loss, this
utter loss of all self~command, had been what the
squire had tried to guard against all day- -this
was the reason why he had not followed Ardenne
immediately when the latter arose and went
after Winny from the dinner table. In his first
interview with Sina Hinton, the surprise, the
violence of the shock his feelings had received,
had thrown him off his guard, and he had given
way to the phrenzy of anger. When that was
past, though still in a deep rage, he resolved to
guard against its breaking out into fury and
alarming his guests; for, as I said, the squire
had all the instincts of the gentleman and the
hostbut theopenupright frankness, which he call-
- ad the "cool impudence," of Ardenne, had dri-
van him mad. Now he satwith his light hair stick-
lug stragglingly out in every direction, with his
blue eyes contracted, isis fair, red face streaming
with perspiration, his fat knees apart, and hold-
ing a large straw haE with both hands, as he
fanned himself. After a little, he got up and
rung the bell. A s nt answered it.
"Send Miss HinfZi 'ito. me, sink it 1-go and
say to Miss Hinten tWat I beg the favor of her
presence for a few minutes in this study."
The servant left the room. In an instant after,
Sina glided in.
"Sit down, Miss Hinton 1-sit down, my dear?
I have sent the young rascal about his business,
my dear I"
if Alas, sir, frie ly as I feel towards him,"
said Sins, putting er handkerchief to her face,
"I must admit that his expulsion was well de-
served 1"
"I reckon it was I The insolent fellow had
the impudence to ask my permission to marry
my daughter I Now, that was a great deal
more assuming and presumn~ than if he had
tried to elope with her," sa squire, wiping
his face and furiously fanning imselt. "Ah,
talking of elopements, where is that poor little
angel-I mean that wicked little daughter of
mine ?"
'~'I carried her to my room, because it was
nearest, sir-she is lying on my bed."
"Ab I go lock the door !-...go at once, Miss
Hinton-lock the door, and always keep the
key yourself; she shall be in yourcharge; when

ON PA LE~
she wishes to come out, do not leave her side a
moment !"
Now, at first thought, Sina did not like this
being constituted Winny's jailor, but a mo-
ment's reflection taught her. that this was the
very way in which she would be best able to
assist the intercoufee of the lovers, and forward
her own plans. She curtsied and withdrew from
the study to obey the command. She went to
her room, and found Winny still lying on the
bed, with her hands pressed over her face, ann
the tears stealing through her fingers. Sina
stooped over her, kissed her tenderly, and whiz-
pered softly,
"Winny, my dear love, your father-.-your
stern, harsh father-has commanded me to lock
you in; have faith in me, Winny, have faith in
me, dear child, and by seeming your jailor, 1
shall be your friend and assistant. You shall
see your lover to-night," and the girl-..and
double traitress - doubly, trebly steeped ma
falsehood, locked the door and returned to the
study.
"Ahi very well-very well, indeed I" said
the squire, when he saw the key. "Now, Miss
Hinton, is the young villain-the Black Prince
-gone ?"
"I heard a servant say that he had taken his
departure, sir, and that he had left directions
to have his baggage forwarded to Harper's
Ferry."
"Very well, it shall be done-Miss Hinton 1"
"Sir I"
"You are a very pretty girl; give me a kiss."
"1 am a very plain, poor girl, sir, with no
dower but my discretion."
"And a very good dower-and by lleavenyou
shall have a better one," said the squire.
"1 offer you my duty, sir; have you any far-.
ther commands for me ?"
"No-yes! no-that is to say, I have a ques-
tion to ask. Has this disagreeable affair got
wind among the visitors yet ?"
"Not at all, sir. Mrs. and Miss Summerfield
are in their chambers, in a remote part of the
house-and Colonel Dangerfield is out shooting
with Harry Joy, and Father Burleigh has gone
to marry a couple."
"D-n 'marrying a couple'-it's all non-
sense I"
"Anything more, sir ?"
"No! be off with you? you little prude; you
only stay here to worry me."
And Sina Hiuton curtsied~and glided from the
room with a singular smile on her lips.
Sina met the priest as he came in from his
mission. "Good evening, Father Burleigh,"
she said, and hastened to take his staff and hat,
and put them upon the rack-and to offer him a
chair in the coolest ps~f the piazza. "1 can-.
not think where Harr be," said she, leaning
over the balustrade and pretending to be looking

I

SIIANNO
eagerly out-then returning, she sea ccl tit~
near the priest and said, in her insinuating tones,
"What a charming girl your niece is, Father
Burleigh-such a remarkable style of beauty,
too-such a fine expanded white brow; does she
resemble her mother?" and Sina fixed her eyes on
his eyes, and slowly sent their glances deep into
his very soul. "Say, Father Burleigh, doeb she
resemble her mother ?"
The priest grew very pale, and trembled.
"On!" said Sina, with a look of deep repen-
tance, "perhaps you loved her mother very
much-and grieved very much over her death-
and I, indiscreet girl, have opened again the long
closed wound. I am deeply grieved."
The priest arose, tottered, grasped the chair
and sank back into it. Sina ran and got a glass
of water-gave it to him with the softest words
of sympathy and condolence, while her eye fixed
triumphantly, maliciously upon his, said,
"I have the deepest secret of your soul-you
are henceforth my slave. You have unbounded
or almost unbounded power over your p~rssh-
loners, over the families especially of Oak Grove
'and of Red-Stone! You shall use it as I direct."
And havirtg driven this stake, she went to her
room-and in a disguised hand wrote the follow-
ing short note to Edgar Ardenne:
--.-" Your loved one is in the last, the very
last extremity-she lies like a 'bower beaten
down by the storm; nothing but your presence
will revive her-nothing but your presence this
evening, will give her strength to bear the few
days separation that must intervene between
this and your marriage. Be, at ten this evening,
at the place where we talked together this morn-
ing, and I will conduct you to her.
"In haste and in peril,
"You know who."
It will be observed, that in this cautious note,
there was neither name, date, locality, or any
sufficiently distinct allusion to betray her, even if
as a remote possibility it should fall into other
hands than those intended to receive it. Be-
sides, the hand was an imitation of that of ano-
ther member of the family. While Sina sealed
this letter she looked at Winny- Winny was
lying on the bed very quiet, with her face half
b~iried in the pillow-apparently, perhaps really
unconscious of the presence of any one else in the
apartment.
Sina elided from the room, down stairs and
slipped the letter in the post-bag just as it was
about to be carried off. "So far, so good! he
must think it necessary to carry Winny off to
save her life! Now for Winny, she must be
made to believe it essential to the continuance of
his existence, to be carried off by him." And
Sine returned to her room, where Winny still
lay~ She went up to the side of the bed-stoop-
ed over Winny, laid her hand gently on the

ts~rob'ing young head, drew aside the golden
ringlets that clung damp to her temples, kissed
her tenderly, and murmured, in her soft melliflu-
ous tone-
'~Look up, my love; my love-sister look up
and tell me how you are.~~
Winny's white arms arose from the bed and
drew the head of Sina down to hers in silence.
Sina sat upon the side of the bed, nestled to her,
raised her up, and laid her fair head upon~'1ier
bosom, stroking her golden ringlets, kissingher,
and cooing comfort all the while.
"Sinai what passed between-between fa-
ther and-and him I"
"My dear Winny! my little love, it is best
you should not know I" said the artful girl, with
a look o~ solemn meaning.
This of course terrified the poor child. and
stimulated her to fresh and urgent iuquiry-.-.-aa
it was intended to do.
"Oh, tell me! tell me, dearest Sinai"
"My love! my little darling-it would only
make you more miserable-do not ask me I"
Winny turned deadly sick with fear, and
would have fainted but for the mental stimulus
of her keen anxiety.
~' This dread is worse tuna certainty-tell
mc I" faltered the white and trembling child.
"Well, then, dear child, it you must have it,
I will tell you. I happened to be in the pas-
sage leading to the study- he - your -father,
I mean, talked loud, and I could not help
hearing him. Edgar, like an honorable, high
should man as he is, did not seek to conceal any~
things he avowed his love for you; admitted
that he had nothing but a cabin and a life of in-.
dastry and frugality to share with you, and-"
"And oh! if father were willing! it Would be
such a heaven to share that poverty! Oh, it
would be a divine joy to work and to bear pain
for Edgar," said Winny, clasping her little white
hands in a sort of ecstasy.
"Tne inconceivable little idiot! ' thought Sina
to herself.
"Well, well! what said father, Sina ?"
"He! he broke out into fury! he heaped every
sort of obscene and blasphemous abuse upon Ar-
deane."
"Oh, Mary Mother! Oh, All merciful Lord 1"
prayed Winny, with clasped hands and pallid
brow-" and Ardenne! and Ardenne I"
"He was your father, Winny, and that cir-
cumatance struck your lover powerless before
him. Any other man but your father must have
perished then and there by the roused wrath or
your lover-the old bear would have been but as
a child in the grasp of the young lion' But could
he lay hands on your father? Ardenne was pale
with the passion he controlled. He bore tts@

Sina spoke with so much eloquence of words,
tones, anti gestures, That bad as she was, she
must nave in a degree felt what she uttered.-
Winny had been white with terror at the com-
mencement of the description-the tears that
had been frozen at their fountain now melted and
ran down her cheeks-but the lightning flashed
through the shower as she said,
~J'tiat contumely should be heaped upon his
head! My noble, my high-souled, my god-like
one! My archangel! and by my father! But
I-even 1 will compensate him! 1, whom they
call the heiress of 04k Grove; to whom every
one bows with such profound deference; 1, be-
fore whose small footsteps every one turns aside
to make nay; I, the only daughter of the
haughty Darlings, will show him so much defer-
ence, so much meekness, so much submission,
anti so, if contempt approach, I must absorb it-
it shall not touch my archangel! He shall feel
that however others, in their blindness, may
mistake and contemn him, he is my archangel
still I"
"Bat when do you expect to see him again,
since he has left 0 ik Grove ?" said Sina, break-
ing in upon the maiden's enthusiasm. ' What
opportunity do you expect to find for all this
compensation, my dearest Winny ?"
"True! true! Oh, Virgin Mother! oh, pity-
ing Seviour! what will console him in his sor-
row?"

cuitidren-he whose talents opened for him the
road to the highest distinction!"
"Oh, All-merciful Father! not that fate for
Au denne! come degradation! come contempt to
me rather!"
"Listen again! he will be here this evening.
I will admit him when the company are at the
height of their dancing in the saloon. He will
ask you to fly with him-do not refuse him."
"But, oh merciful heaven! my poor father!"
"He trampled the honor of your lover under
his feet!" said the astute Sina.
The eyes of Winny flashed through their tears.
Then Sina said calmly,
"Nonsense! Fathers make a great row be-
forehand, but afterwards they all become agreea-
ble enough. Your father would never consent
to your marriage, but when you are once mar-
ried, he will readily forgive you-how can he help
it? What geod will it do him to retain his wick-
ed anger, for do you Aot see, that though his
anger might prevent yaur getting married, and
is so far useful, yet once married, his persistence
in anger cannot unmarry you, and is therefore
useless. He will be too wise to persevere in
what is useless as well as wrong. B~msides, as 1
said, he cannot help it. You are his only child.
He loves you-he cannot live without you."
"Ahi what an ungrateful child I should be to
leave him then, my poor, old, fond father, my
good father !"

Sina smiled to herself-her end was achieved
-secrecy as to her interference was pledged
from Winny, as it had been from Ardenne, with-
out her seeming to care that it should be so.
"Now, love," she said, kissing her, "you are
not able to go down into the ball'room to-night
--you must remain here-I will send you some
tea and toast ;" and Sina arose, and left the
room On the first landing she met Squire Darling.
"How is my little unfortunate ?"
"Oh! more cheerful, sir !-far more cheerful,
but not able, I think, to bear the excitement of
the ball-room!"
"We must make excuses for her, and try to
let her absence be as little observed as possible.
Fortunately my good mother has retired to bed,
without having inquired for her-imagining her,
I suppose, to be in the chamber of her Aunt
Summerfield."
"Um-m-me," cooed Sina, "that is so well!
It would be such a pity that the dear old lady
should be disturbed."
"SinaI"

they returned from their sporting expedition.
Harry's broad white brow shining between its

We will take glance into the saloon first. Only
a glance, for Winny is absent-Winny, who, as
the daughter of the host, should be "the bright
particular star," "the star of that goodly com-
pany." Miss Hinton, arrayed in a mazarine blue
satin that became her dark style well, and ha-
ving her hair in long black, ringlets, received the
company with much grace. Squire Darling
stood on her right, his stout figure and fresh toi-
let, his fair Saxon face and fair curling hair
looking the very picture of a debonair country
gentleman. No one, as he smiled and bowed
and wiped his brow, and welcomed his guests
and chattered to his attractive assistant Sina-
no, not a soul would have believed that he had,
in a manner, just kicked the tutor out of doors
and locked his daughter up. And as for Sina-
who, to see her smiling and cooing, patronizing
or consoling, could have believed that she was
at the bottom of all the trouble ~. Sina coos to
him, smiles on him, and leans heavily upon his
stout arm. He holds her arm rather tiger than
strictly necessary, clipping it close to his side;
he holds her vinaigrette and wields her fan, and
presents every stranger who comes up-to "My
cousin, Miss Hinton, of Georgetown."

And Sina glided from the other end of the
room, to the side of Winny, caressed, cajoled,
soothed, reassured her.
It is useless to repeat the persuasive sophis-
tries of this unprincipled and dangerous girl. It
is sufficient to say that then and there the plan,
the time and the piace of the elopement were
arranged. Ardenne took his leave. Winny
sunk weeping upon the false, soft bosom of her
treacherous friend. Sina laid her down, and
returned quickly, and with some trepidation, to
the bail-room. All was safe for her there, how-
ever.
"Where have you been, you wretched little

"With Winny."
"Ah, you spoil that naughty child-poor little

"Very well I asleep, I believe, now."

Down in one of those picturesque gaps of the
Blue Ridge, watbred by a branch of the Shenan-
doah, stood the old Catholic Chapel of the Sa-
cred Heart, erected by the first American Sum..
merfield. It was a small gothic building, con-
structed of red sand-stone, in the form of a cros,
with a tower and steeple at the end. It was
surrounded by a graveyard, in which reposed
the mortal remains of all the Summerfteld fa-
mily. Adjoining this chapel was a small cot-
tage, built also of red sand-stone, and surrounded
with a small garden-yard; farther off, an or-
chard of various kinds of fruit trees. This mo-
dest dwelling was the home of the old priest,
Father Burleigh, his niece Harry, and his house-
keeper, Miss Matilda or Mattie ~milie, an
cient maiden and a lay sister of the order of -
Mount Cannel. It was a very poor-looking
house for a clergyman. It wanted all those
little comforts and luxuries with which zealous
Catholics love to surround their Father in the-
Lord. Not but that the few parishioners of the
old priest were kind and liberal, and wished to
enrich him, but because they sos~s few, and

So do My goodness I here comes ~'atne

fidgetting about the kitchen to prepare supper.
The priest entered the kitchen, leaning hea
vily upon his staff. lid laid it down, put off hi
square-topped cap, and sank wearily in hi,
chair, without speaking. Old Gelly arose, curt
sied avid respectfully remained standing, whib
old man's tea was getting ready.
"Ras Elarriette returned?" he asked, witi
some vi rvxiety, of the housekeeper.
"No ~
"Where is she 2"
"Your reverence knows, sir, that Miss Harr3

"Miss Elinton! I utterly object to that asso.

The placid housekeeper promised compliance,
and set the tea on the table.
The old priest changed his boots for slippers,
and drew his chair to the table.
When supper was over, and the table-cloth
removed, and the reading-lamp lighted and set
upon it, and Father Burleigh had taken down a
volume of the "Lives of the Saints," and laying
it on ~e table, had opened and commenced read-
ing, Miss Mattie went up to him, and with a
meek, halt-chastened tone, said-

"But your reverence promised-"
"I promised to investigate it. I will do so,"
and the old man, resuming his cap and his staff,
went forth.
It was very dark; the lofty mountains loomed
gloomily into the clouded sky; the hollow moan
of a rising wind through the forest, and the
hoarse murmur of the swollen river, as it swept
past, were the only sounds that . disturbed the
otherwise dead silence. The priest looked
around upon the murky darkness of the sullen
scene, and seemed to find a morose pleasure in
its assimilitude to his own soul; then, with an
imperceptible smiles at his own credulity, he
turned his steps to where the white tombstones
of tue church-yard gleamed faintly out in the
darkness. He passed the little gate, and was
within the enclosure. Nothing was to be seen I

r stones, and-far, the dark and looming moun.
tains; and nothing was to be heard but the
hollow groans of the wind among the mountain-
- pines, answered by the hoarse moan of the
s river at their base. A vague, but awful terror,
* or presentiment-or some equally fearful jnflu-
- ence, weighed down the spirit of the priest, and
he was about to retrace his steps, whe
"At last!" exclaimed a thrilling voice, near
him.
An icy chill ran through the veins of the
priest-his blood curdled. He was neither cow-
ardly nor superstitious, hut the time, the place,
the circumstances, his shattered nervous system
-certain dark memories of the past, all conspir-
ed to betray his courage. He looked around, but
saw nothing-nothing but the old chapel, the
* spectral tombstones, a~d the giant mountains.
"Who speaks?" he asked, in a quivering K
voice.
" Who ~ was the response.
"It is 1-Father Bixrleigh-pastor of the Sa-
cred Heart Parish-and who art thou?'
"One who knows the deepest secrets of thy soul,
Barna6as Burleigls, pastor of the Sacred Heart!"
Again the blood of the old priest was turned I
back in its course.
"And what-wnat wouldst thou with me 2"
gasped the unhappy man, as his knees smote to-
gether.
"Follow ens !" replied the voice; and at the
same moment a figure clothed in white emerged
from the deep darkness, and glided up the path
before him leading to the chapel.
The priest followed, with tottering steps, de-
spite the support of the staff he leaned upon.
The figure paused at the church door.
"Opem it !" said the mystery, receding, and
leaving the way unobstructed for the priest to
pass.*
Father Burleigh stooped, and drawing the key
from its hiding-place under the door-step, un-
locked the door and entered. The white figure
glided after him. The priest gained the steps
of the altar, struck a light, and turning with a
newly summoned courage-for there was a feel-
ing of sanctity, of safety, in the walls of the
church-in the precincts of the altar-he flashed
its light upon the advancing figure, and said, in
a stern voice, and with a frowning, though pal-
lid brow-
"Come I-approach, intruding spy I-reveal
thyself
The figure walked straight up the aisle,
paused before the blazing torch, threw back a
large, muffling, white muslin veil, and revealed
the face of Sina Hinton, sparkling with the light
of its insolent defiance and malignant joy I

CHAPTER iX.
THE EVIl SPIRIT.
By thy cold breast and serpent smile,
By thy unfathomed gulfs of guile,
By that mod seeming virtuous eye,
By thy shut soul's hypocrisy,
By the perfection of thine art,
That passed for human thine own heart,
By thy delight in others' pain,
And by thy sisterhood of Cain,
I call upon thee, and compel
Thyself to be thy proper hell.  Byron
"Dark, dreadful girl! what wouldst thou
with me?"
It was some moments before she replied; and in
that time her eyes were fired upon his as though
she would strike that sharp, bright glance deep
into the profoundest depths of his soul, and read
there how much of principle might remain to de-
fend-how much of fear to betray him late her
power.
Alas! the eyes of the anointed priest qualled
and fell before those of the sinful girl.
Then she laughed aloud and said, "Oh! I
have no secrets from you! Come hither, Father I"
and drawing him into a side pew, she sat down
before him. The priest trembled in every limb,
and covered his face with his har~ls. "I looked
into your soul just now to satisfy myself of what
1 almost knew before-that is, that I should find
a coadjutor-not a betrayer in you I"
"Lost girl! That your purposes are all bad,
I read in the fiend-like exultation of your coun-
tenance! Dare you count upon my co-operation?"
"Yes! I am mistress of your secret !"
"And though that secret, wretched girl,
should consign me to a-'~
C5~caffold!~~
The old man shuddered from head to foot as
he faltered-
"And even then, detestable girl, do you think
that I will lend myseL~ to any wicked purpose of
yours 2"
"Poh!" exclaimed Sina, with infinite disgust.
"You judge my purpose by your past. I have slo-
thing~ in hand, at which your moral cowardice
shalL shrink, for I have nothing in hand that
shall break any one of the ten commandments,
or any law of the land-as it happens!"
"As it happens? And if it were otherwise 2"
inquired the priest, fixing his piercing black eye~
upon those of Sina, and seeming for the moment
even to lose his fears in serious contemplation
of this singular being
sShe did not quail under that glance, as she re-
plied, boldly-" If it were otherwise, it would
make no whit of difference with ens-whatever
it might with you!"
"Audacious girl-you glory in your wicked-
ness!~,

~%1 TRIUMPH IN MY POWER
"Woman! you are transfigured before rae!
Your eyes flare! they flame! You are a fiend I"
"You have a fine imagination, Father, though
rather a diabolical one-fine, as that of the moon-
struck poet, Ardenne, who calls me an angel,
and whose fancies, in contradistinction of your
own, may be called celestial. Now, neither of
you have hit it! This is the truth. There was
in me, as in you, and in us all, originally, an
angel and a devil, striving for pre-eminence.
They kept up in my soul such an eternal war
that I had no peace between them, so I just
strangled and cast out the angel, and the fiend
has quiet possession. I advise you to do the
same I"
The priest was leaning over the front of the
pew, contemplating her as she sat there. "Sa-
tanic wisdom!"
"Discord in the soul is weakness-war in the
soul is impotency; so long as the good and evil
strive in us, we have no will, no individuality,
no life-it is only at the end of the struggle that
we are born into life, the life of an angel or of a
devil-even in this world-and that life brings
power! grand power! Napoleon never would
have been Emperor, if he had not possessed a
vigorous will, and early put an end to the inner
struggle-early strangled and cast out the angel!
The life that you see around you, is not life, but
a chaos of good and evil impulses in which indi-
viduality-' rnyself'-is lost. Three destinies
await the soul at the death of the body-angel-
life, demon-life, or annihilation; angel-life to
those who have expelled the fiend-demon-life
to those who have cast out the angel-annihila'
tion to those weak souls lost in the struggle. Au
weak infants perish in the crisis of birth, or even
before-so weak souls perish in the crisis of
death, or even before. iMMoRTALITY IS ron.
THOSE ONLY, WHO ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO GRASP
IT
"Incarnate fiend! have you chosen this holy
ground to deliver your diabolical heresies only?
or have you any other purpose? if so) speak it!
for my soul is scorched by your presence as my
body would be by the proximity of a conflagra-
tion!"
"Go on, sir! my father who. was expert at
gambling used to say that it was the privilege
of the beaten to swear!"
"Will you tell me why you seek me in this
secret way I"
"Truth, Father, 1 love to proibng this conver-
sation! It is so seldom I find one with whom 1
can be really frank as I can with you-it is qulte
refreshing I'
The fingers of the priest worked convulsively,
his sunken eyes flashed for an instant and thea
fell-a power as of myriads of angels had sought
to draw him away-a power as of hosts of de-
mons held him tohis seat. The hour and the

place, deep, dark night, the interior of the lone
old church, the presence of this evil spirit scarce~
ly less terrible to him than if disembodied, all
acted upon his shattered nerves and held him in
a state of hopeless imbecility, fitfully varied by
spasms of resistance, each of which left him
weaker than before; at last he said, in a smo-
thered voice,
ft Girl! thou knowest my secret-by what ne-
cromancy, it is bootlessto ask-but, thouknowest
my secret I what is the price of thy silence?"
"AhI now thou comes to the point. In a
word, then. Edgar Ardenne called upon you last
week with a request that you would unite him-
self and Miss Darling in marriage, and you re-
fused to do so 1"
.~" 1 did! I will not officiate in a clandestine
marriage. I wonder that any minister of t~e
gospel ever should."
"Exemplary old man! would you have the
young peopleelope without being married? for
that would be the end of your morality."
"I would have all ministers of the gospel and
all others do their simple duty, and leave the
con5equences~~~~
"I might prove that those very 'consequences'
affect the very point of 'duty,' but I will not. I
will only remark that I wish you to reconsider
that decision! I wish you to pronounce the
nuptial benediction that shall unite forever the
destinies of Edgar Ardenne and Winny Darling!
and at no later period than to-morrow eve
ning!"
"Ha! now do you not know, Miss Hinton,
that such a ceremony would be null and void,
that both Ardenne and Miss Darling are under
age, and that in Virginia the marriage of minors
without the consent of their parents and guar-
dians is illegal, invalid ?"
"Full well I know that, but I know also that
as England has its Gretna-Green, so Virginia has
its Harper's Ferry, and that this law of Virginia
does not diminish the annual number of youthful
marriages. 1 know that its only effect is to take
from the treasury of the State of Virginia, and
to throw into the treasury of the State of Mary-
land several thousand dollars annually, in the
money paid for marriage licenses by citizens of
Virginia to the clerks of the county courts of
Maryland: so much for their imported English
law! Now what I want you to do, Father Bur-
leigh, is this-Edgar Ardenne and Winny Dar-
ling will be at Harper's Ferry to-morrow eve-
ning meet them there, cross the Potomac
with them, unite them in the State of Marylane."
"And the license then ?"
"No difficulty will be met there! The host
of the hotel at Harper's Ferry 'keeps constantly
on hand a supply' of blank licenses from the
Court of Hagerstown, 'which he will sell at a
small advance,"' laughed Bina.
Theface of the priest could not be seen-.-the-

light he l~eld was flickering out-he did not
* speak in reply to what she last said.
*   "And Father, notice-listen !-for now comes
the very point of my argument. My own parei~
citation in this affair must not be known No!
not to one single soul-for, Father, the day that
I lose fsvor in this neighborhood; that very day
your secret is given to the winds !"
Tne light flashed up in an expiring flare, illu-
minating the thin, fierce features, and piercing
eyes of the fiendish girl, and then went out in
darkness.
CHAPTER X.
THE FLIGHT OF THE LOVE-ANGEL.
I leave thee, father! Eve's bright moon
Must now light other feet,
With the gathered grapes and the harp in tune,
Thy homeward steps to greet.

Lay tones of love so deep
Whose eye o'er all my youth hath smiled-

Pouring out joy and woe,

Still changeless-yei I go!
Lips th* have lulled me with yoix strain,
Eves that have watched my sleep!
Will earth give love like yours again,
Dear mother !-Let me weep!
Mrs. Hemans
Oak Grove lay hushed ai~ basking in the noon
of an August day-the silence only dreamily
disturbed by the drowsy murmur of the breeze
au~ong the foliage. Dinner was over, and the
squire, clad in a cool white linen jacket and
trowsers, was lying at length upon tue long
bench of the front piazza, taking his siesta.-
The county paper with which he had read him-
self to sleep, had dropped from hiss hand. A
drowsy little black boy in his shirt sleeves, was
keeping the flies off his master, with a bunch of
long peacock feathers. It is a warm, heavy,
sleepy season, and the little negro nods, and
bobs, and sways the peacock feathers. Presently
he will inevitably slap it into the face of his
master, who will wake up swearing.
In another part of the house, Madam Wini.
fred, in her own chamber, knelt at her mid-day
devotions.
in still another chamber, sat Winny and Sina.
They sat by a window that was closely shaded
with green foliage, the favorite resort Qf singing
birds, which the gentleness of Winny had never
alarmed. And through these green branches
were caught short views of the level lawn, dot-
ted with huge oak trees, and a glimpse of the
distant quarters. Winny leaned upon her right
elbow, and gazed tearfully from this empowered

window Her other hand was neit ny ~ a,
who pressed and kissed it frequently, or stroked
her golden ringlets, and spoke to her tenderly
and soothingly.
"Bitt Sina-dear Sina-this is the last, the
very last day that I shall stay at home! and it
) ka~over. And to think that I am receivingg
my trusting father and my dear, dear graudmo
ther! that I. whom they love so fondly, so much
more than I deserve -I, whom they call their

Winny turned pale, an~ shuddered from head

Win ny was scarcely sixteen-a mere child-
a country child-a home-educated child- with-
out the slightest protective knowledge of the
world-without the slightest suspicion of its
falsehood. Blame her filial impiety as it de-
serves-as she blames it herself, b11o not call

"My dear love! my sweet Winny! my angel!

atrocious wickedness. You are going to be

"Yes! marriage is a holy state! ~ feel that
-oh, so deeply, so strongly, so profoundly now!
But 1 feel, too, that in entering this holy state
against my dear grandmother, my more than
mother's wishes-without my father's blessing,
and in i~efiance of his curse, that I desecrate a
sanctuary-.--that [~ommit a sacrilege, even as

"Winny! Wiuny! my ttttle love! do not

mutual attractions God cas placed in your hearts
He has already married you. You do but lega-
lize on earth what God has done in Heaven I"
"That is true! and yet-and yet-there is a
disturbance-a discord in my soul-a bright joy
struggling with a dark trouble-as if I had stolen
as a thief into Heaven, with the sins of earth all
clinging around me
For the first time, Sina Hinron lost her self-
command; in truth, for a week she had had "a
job" in the several parts she had played with
Winny, with Ardenne, with the squire and the
priest, and her patience wus about exhausted -
she jumped up and walked the floor in hasty
strides, exclaiming-
"In the name of Judas! then send word to
Edgar to go about his business, and so drop the
whole matter!"
Winny held out her hand.
"Be patient with me, Sina! dear Sina I-you
who have nothing to reproach yourself with-
you do not understand my feeling; even as I
who never experienced physical pain, am puzzled
to know why the sick should groan and write
so! Be patient, Sina! Come back to me! I
told you I would go-I will go But come,
Sina! there are some things I wish to leave
with you to do."
Miss Hinton came and sat again by her side,
embraced her, and said-
"Forgive me, Winny-but my dear child,
your morbid sensibility does try my patience,
sadly-and what is the use of it? You compared
your course just now to the whirl of a current
of destiny."
CC No-not of destiny-I did not so excuse my-
self-to a current of inclination"
"It is the same thing. Let me remind you
now of our boating on the Shenandoah. You
and Ardenne were in a skiff together-we bad
many, many miles of smooth water from liar
per's Ferry up to Shannondale, there we got in-
to the rapids, and for a few minutes, during
which we crossed them, our situation seemed -
it was only seeming-very perilous! You held
your very breath for awe !-yet in less than an
hour, we were in smooth water again, and con-
tinued our course gleefully. You are now in eke
rapids of your life, and your griet and remorse
are now as gratuitous and as temporary as your
awe and terror were then Oh! nonsense! my
love! You will smile at this to-morrow-to-

'Mercy of Heaven! this is paralysis I" ex-
claimed Harriette, in alarm. Why didn't ~ou
tell me of her illness the first thing? Who is
with her? Has a doctor been sent for? Where
is Squire Darling ?" And she jumped from her
horse and hurried towards the house, followed
by old Nerve, who was terrified half to death by
a fact that Harry's words had only just made
known to her-
"You-you don't think It is-that there? do
you, Miss Harry ?"
C' It is paralysis, I am sure of it I Where is

Don't know-ain't able to fix a singly thing
on top o' her, but blessed be my Hebenly Jeave,
the first time as ever I sot my eye on her, I telt
as something' evil had come to the house I"
This conversation brought them to the door ot
t'ie aged woman's chamber. Harriette entered
sifily- the room was silent as death, aiid so
dark that it was some seconds before 'larriette
could discern the prostrate form ol the old lady,
*-~xtended nearly lifeless on the bed Sina Kin-
~on sat near the head of the bed, but did not
~eem to be doing any other duty than watching.
Rarriette drew near-and after gazing with pro-
trnnd sorrow, reverence and awe upon this for.
sakon sick bed, she turned, and whispering softly
to Sina, inquired if a physician had been sum-
noned, and if Squire Darling had been sent for?
Woat was her surprise and indignation to learn,
that neither had been done. Miss Hinton had
apprehended no danger, she said, and so bad ta-
tren no precaution. And now Elarrietto discern-
~-d at once the cause of poor old Nerve's previous
freedom from alarm upon the subject And for
the first time in her life, she sent a suspicious,
searching, angry glance, deep into the eyes of
Sina; but those orbs opposed their large, sha-
dowy tenderness, and the fire of Harriette's
glance was quenched in the liquid softness of
Sina's eyes. Harriette reproached herself for
unj ust, and even most unreasonable suspicion-
for, "what motive," she asked herself, "could
"ma have, for purposely omitting to use say
means for the recovery of the old lady ?" Then
she hurried out, and sent messengers, post-haste,
for a physician, for Squire Darling, and for her
uncle, the priest, and then at more leisure, dis-
patcned a servant to Shannondale, to inform Mrs.
Summerfield of the dangerous illness of her mo-
ther.             ______
Evening drew on. The messenger sent for
the squire had returned and declared himself
nable to find his master in any of bis usual
aunts. Mrs. Suinmerfield. ae'"m.sr,'- by
Mi~e Summerfield, and escorted by Colonel Dan-
gerfield had arrived, and they were waiting in
another room the permission of the young priest
who had been called from St. Joseph's in the ab-
sence of Father Burleigh to enter the chamber.
The family physician, who had quickly obeyed
the hasty summons, had been with her exerting
all the powers of his art for her restoration-and
all in vain or with but partial success. Late in
the evening she recovered her speech in an im-
perfect degree. "My son-I must see-msj
son!" were the first broken, nearl unintelligi-
ble words she spoke The doctor stepped out to
Colonel Dangerfield and told him of this-uriring
at the same time tha great necessity of Squire
Darling's speedy arrival if he would see his
mother living.

CC The messenger could not find 'ii in- ue must
have pursued his fugitive 'auguter arid ncr lover
to Harper's Ferry I will go myself in search
of him," said Colonel Dangerfield, and ringing,
he ordered the fleetest and strongest horse in the
stables to be saddled and brought around. And
in ten minutes Colonel Dangerfield was urging
his fiery steed to its utmost speed over the hills
and precipices that lay between Oak Grove and
Harper's Ferry.
Hours passed on, during which the old lady's
life seemed ebbing fast away. Again she strove
tospeak, and when the physician bent down close
to hear her words she articulated with great diffi-
culty-" Margaret-Imogene-my children I"
and Mrs. and Miss Summerfield were permitted
to approach her bedside. She looked on them
with so much love struggling through the death-
ly agony of her fhce! She tried again to speak;
Mrs. Summerfield, her eyes streaming with
tears, bent over to catch the words It was an
abortive effort. The aged countenance was con-
vulsed a moment and then settled-they thought
in death-hut it was not so-again, and oh! with
what a power I-with what a conquering oinni-
potence of mighty love! the soul struggled for a
moment to overcome, to pierce through the phy-
sical torpor. the mortal torpor-to coirirnune
with its mortal loved! It conquers! it con-
quers! light again melts through the glazed
eyes! the pinched and sunken lips again
move! Mrs. Summerfield bends to catch
the words-'~ Winnv-Winny---forgive-love-
bless-"
She was sinking again.
At a sign from the priest all knelt to offer up
the solemn prayers of the church.

One circumstance must be noted even at this
sacred bedside. As they arose from their knees,
the eyes of the young priest chanced to fall on
those of Imogene, his hand to touch hers, and
every vestige of color vanished froiri her high
royal brow, leaving it pallid as marble, while a
visible shudder shook her imperial form, tifl it
rocked as a storm loosened pillar. The physi-
cian drew her arm within his own and led her
from the room.

THE GRETNA GSLzEN OF ritz OLD DOMINION.
They stood, that gentle pair,
With the blue heaven of evening above,
And forest odors dying on the air,
And light leaves trembling round, and early love
Deep in each breast. What rocked their souls of
strife ?
**** rh~y stood that hour,
Speaking of hope while mountain, fount, and flower,
And star just gleaming through the cedar hough~
Seemed holy things as records of their vows;
But change came o'er the scene. A hurrying tread
Broke on the whispering shades, and then she
knew
The footstep of her father's wrath that fled
Up whence the cedars make you avenue
Dim with green twilight; glutting there she caught,
Was it the flash of swords? a swift, dark thought
Struck down her lips rich crimson as it passed,
ADd from her eye the sunny sparkle took
'ne moment with its fearfulness, and shook
Her slight frame fiercely, as a stormy blast
Might shake the rose. Once more and yet once
more,
She stilled her heart to listen-.-all was o'er!
Ilemnns.
Except the Falls of Niagara, the Falls of the
Shenandoah, at Harper's Ferry, presents perhaps
the most awfully sublime prospect in America.
The best view is that from the top of the "Pin-
nacle," a rugged rock on the Maryland side of
the Potomac, towering twelve hundred feet above
the rushing river. From the little tongue of
land between the two rivers at their juncture,
and the two precipices of the mountain at its
gap, the emotions arising from the beautiful and
sublime in nature are pleasurable to a rapturous
-to an ecstatic degree- but such emotions
change their nature as the grand becomes the
terrific-the terrific stupendous! Few of our
people have contempt enough for fatigue, or
veneration enough for nature, to dare the labori-
ous ascent of the Pinnacle to its highest point;~
fewer still have nerve enough to venture to the
maddening edge of the tremendous precipice and
look down. Something of the wild savage in
her nature, that teaching never could tame, nor
sorrow quite subdue, tempted oite to the summit
of that mountain, and to the very edge of that
delirious precipice. At the first fearful look be-
low, the whole stupendous scene moved- swam
-whirled around, as though from the mountain-
top she beheld the whole earth rolling away
from beneath her feet; and overwhelmed by the
painful, the intolerable sense of the awful fall,
had nearly fallen. As soon as this first delirium
of the nerves is over, this chaos of th~ mIn4
settled, and mountain, glen and torrent
each jis ,its place. the grandly expanded.~7 id
deepened landscape, the nearly boundless depth
and extent, seems as if the whole immense earth

were hollowed out, cup-like, to its very centre
and became a measureless green valley with it
grand circumference of mountains, upon the ver~
edge of the highest of which we stand! Belot~
us fall rock after rock, precipice below preci
pice, and abyss below abyss of foliage to an in
interminable depth, seemingly puasing through
the dark centre of the earth itself, and lost it

and    faita in the supremacy of soul, and the
immortality of mind, by confrontingg mere mat-
ter in its most awful--most terrific majesty!
But Harper's Ferry possesses other points of
interest besides the terrific scenery. It is rich
in Revolutionary lore and indian tradition and
it is, besides, the Gretna Green of Virginia.
The reader will recollect that the laws govern-
ing the social and domestic relations of Virginia
are founded, wherever the difference of position
permits, upon those of England. In Virginia, as
in England, the marriage of minors, without the
consent of their parents and guardians, is ille-
I. gal, null and void. Now, though Harper's
Ferry is in Virginia, yet it is upon the very
boundary river separating that State from Mary-
land, and a short distance from the County Court
House of Washington County, in the latter State.
Hence it is the most convenient place for the
purpose, and is the resort of all the indiscreet
and disobedient boys and girls of Virginia who
choose to cast their fate upon the hazardous die
of a rebellious and premature marriage. You
would scarcely believe how many of these mar-
riages come off every week at that place. So
frequent are they that an agent there keeps con-
stantly on hand a file of* blank licenses, pur-
chased from the County Clerk at Hagerstown,
to be filled up when wanted. These marriages
take place upon the bridge across the Potomac,
beyond the high-water mark. And the State of
Maryland annually gains many thousand dollars
from the State of Virginia from that one source.
At the ti~rie I write of there was no bridge, and
the~ preisut hotel did not exist, but on its site
was a smaller one, kept by a Mr. Smiie, who~
owned the ferry-boat thai plied between it and
the opposite shore.
It was mere on the. afternoon of a sultry Sop-i

ONDALE.                                  45
tember day, that a very youthful pair rode in
a "hot haste, 'travel-stained, fatigued, and pale,
1 up in front of the rural tavern. A hostler came
I out to take charge of the horses, and Ardenne,
- dismounting, lifted Winny from her saddle.-.-
- The host, a dapper little man, with a round
and smiling face, came out to meet and con-
duct them in.
"Is the Reverend Mr. Burleigh at the Ferry?"
inquired Ardenne, in a low voice, as he drew
the arm of Winny within his own, and led her
- into the house.
"Yes! yes! he's here!" answered the host,
* with a sly smile, and a confidential air.
* Now there were really no confidences be-
tween Ardenne and the hotel-keeper, to whom
* both himself and Winny were perfect strangers;
* but the former understood at a glance the state
of affairs between the youthful couple, and lent
himself to them accordingly.
For one minute Winny was left in the par-
lor alone, while Ardenne went to procure a
small printed slip of paper at the bar. Then
returning, he drew her arm within his own, and
led her down to the beach, where waited the
ferry-boat to convey them across to the Mary-
land side.
Winny was deadly pale, and looked exhaust-
ed, but recognizing Father Burleigh in the boat,
her spirits revived br an instant, as she raised
and kissed his hand. As they were going over
the river, she raised her eyes to his venerable
face, so beseechingly !-and murmured-
"Oh! Father Burleigh! do you think that
we are doing so very wrong 7"
"It is over late to ask that question now5
Miss Darling!"
"True," replied Winny, sadly-and like
many dther prospective wrong-doers, she wished
the wrong once completed, and the atrua~gte
over.
They gained the other side-they landed im-
mediately under the dizzy heights of the Pin-
nacle. They stood before the priest, with the
tavern-keeper and the ferryrnan for the witnesses.
The book was opened-the imposing ceremony
commenced-completed.
The boy folded his child-bride to his bosom,
and they were turning to leave the place, when
the upraised hand and warning voice of the priest
arrested them.
"I might not refuse to wed you! bu*-sach
a marriage seldom, very seldomprospers!
and girl you have in your proper selves sinned
again the sin of our first parents! You have in
your proper persons incurred again the cuasul

Sorru .s that wait on filial impiety, di-ooeoiei~c
and rehellirn!-hotlckarge thee to bear her uj
and on throoch th~cn all--"
Ardenne clasped Winny more closely to hi
heart-
"As thou wouldet merit and win a final for
giveness from Heaven 1"
"At least we shall, together, meet whatever:
comes," was the uppermost thought in the heart
of both, as they re-entered the ferry-boat.
"Poor child, poor child-where do you inten
to take her now, Ardenne ?" asked the priest.
"We shall remain here to-night-and to-mor.
row-Wiany ?" said the youth, suddenly appeal
ing to the girl.
"'To-morrow,' oh! to-morrow-very, vera
early, to-morrow, we must return to Oak Grove
must go at once to father and to dearest, dearest
grandmother I"
They landed on the other side and were walk-
ing towards the house, when-suddenly thunder-
ing down the hill came a horseman at headlong
speed, and Squire Darling throwing himself fran-
tically from the saddle, rushed furiouslytowards
the party, his face purple, his frame violently
shaking with the very frenzy of anger! bran-
dishing two swords, and exclaiming,
"Thief! kidnapper! villain! scoundrel! tral-
~tor! knave! accursed knave! draw and defend
your reptile life, that I may not have the sin of
murder on my soul !" he hurled one sword at
Ardenne with ~o much violence that it must have
struck him, but that his Winny, with the in-
stinct of devotion and the speed of light, threw
herself upon his bosom, receiving upon her own
person the blow which felled her bleeding to the
earth!
"Murderer! you have killed your daughter!"
exclaimed the priest, in the extremity of horror.
"Devil send I had killed hoth I" roared the
madman; white with terror, nevertheless. Ar-
denne had sunk down and raised her partly on
his lap, laid her falling head upon his bosom, and
oh! in a remorse-in a bitter, bitter sorrow, im-
possible to describe! impossible to conceive!
wac wiping with his handkerchief the blood that
oozed from some inward wound from her lips !-
while the priest kneeling, laved the young death-
like brow and temples with cold water. The
frenzy, the dizzy, the blind delirium of his fury
having been momentarily shocked away; Squire
Darling stood struck statue-still with horror and
remorse- an instant-and tben advanced slowly,
deprecatingly forward to look in fear upon his
work! muttering to himself, "God Almighty
knows I did not mean to strike her!"
Toe news of the act spread rapidly-" Arrest
the murderer! arrest Squire Darling I Arrest

e turn! Strike him down if he resists!" sounded
p from all sides as the villager- carrie runoiig to
the scene of the catastrophe! Disturbe'~ 0y the
s noise, Winny opened her gentle eyes, and fixing
them tenderly on her father's countenance, mur-
- inured faintly,
- No-not hurt, I am not-hurt-dear fatner-
not much," and then sank exhausted
"Arrest Squire Darling! arrest the unnatural
monster! knock him on the head if ne resists!,'
I thundered the crowd, pouring in, aid a scor~ of
hands fell upon the squire. Breaking from ihem
- with the strength and fury of an unchained
- demon, he roared in a frenzy of remorse, despair
and rage:
"Fl-I and furies! let me get at him! he has
made me kil! my child! let me finish the work
by killing him!" and wouldhave fallen with a
frantic ferocity upon Ardenne, but that a dozen
hands intercepted the raining blows ot his arms,
while cries of "Arrest him!" "Knock him
down!" "Unnatural monster I,' resounded from
'I quarters.
At this moment, "Hands off Squire Darling,
instantly! and disperse, every one of you, to
your homes!" exclaimed a stern, deep toned
~"5ce. and Colonel Dangerfield, in the calm
majesty of his self-possession and authority,
stood in their midst. And, to Squire Darling,
who was still struggling violently to get at
Ardenne, he said, '- Madman! double murderer!
desist, and follow me! your mother, your mother
is dying !"
Arouied by the sound, the violet eyes ot the

Hemans.
A year, with its moral and its atmospherical
vicissitudes-with its toils and struggles-its
hopes and fears-its disappointments and vic-
tories-its sins and sorrows-its loves and joys
-a year, with its fruitful autumn, its hoary
[ winter, its budding, blooming spring, and its
exuberant luxuriance of summer-has passed
since the warm eve in September when Winny
Darling gave herself to Edgar Ardenne.
Let us first take a glance at Oak Grove. Mrs.
Darling, the old lady, whom we left prostrate on
what we supposed to be her death- bed, did not,
nevertheless, die then or there, nor did she yet
fully recover. That strong, unyielding, invinci-
ble tenacity of vitality which distinguishes some
r organizations, successfully resisted death, and
she lived; but what a wreck of her former self I
more welcome, less appalling must have been
death! She lived, and sat confined to her arm
chair, in her own lonely and solitary chamber,
paralyzed in mind and body-nothing but the
loving heart left living in its pristine, in its im-
mortal strength!
"Where is Winny? Send Winny to me! I
want Winny I" she would pleadingly say to Sina
Hinton, who, with her diabolical cunning, had
contrived to get the chief charge and control of
the unfortunate lady.
"Yes, yes, we will send for her; you shall see
her!" Sina would reply.
"But when, when," with a child-like perti-
nacity she would entreat.
"Oh, to-morrow; you shall see Winny to-
morrow I" would be the reply of the guileful
girl, thinking, perhaps, that the old lady would
forget; but, no, her heart never forgot! In the
,morning she would be sure to wake early, and
insist on being dressed soon, and sit in her arm-
chair, for, "Winny is coming to-day I" she
would say to her old waiting-maid, and the poor
old servant, not knowing that her lady had been
deceived by a promise, and thinking that in that

also her mine wandered, would go out to weep
over the ruined intellect 05 her old, old compa-
nion and mistress of nearly three-quarters of a
century. And as the hours pasasi' and the day
advanced, the invalid would look- and watch,
and inquire, and weep-and sometimes, with a
prophetic glimpse of the truth, she would say-
her very errors of speech making her lamenta-
tions more pathetic-
"Oh, I shall see Winny never no more! never
no more I"
She knew Sina Hinton perfectly; for, as her
intellect weakened, her instincts became more
subtle.
"Send that girl away !" she would say to her
son, in the very presence of Sina, "she makes
misery!"
But Sina Hinton-sweet, considerate, forgiving
soul !-would go to her, and coo and caress,
while the old lady would shrink in loathing from
her contact.
"What an angel of goodness you are, Miss
Hinton! And, oh, my poor mother, what a
wreck! what a wreck! and to think that she
should injure you so, Sina! sweet, soft SinaI
but never mind, my darling girl! sole comfort
of my afflictions! my console! my beautiful
console! Never mind! bear this a little longer!
do not leave me! Oh, Sina, how shall I ever
repay you, my best, best girl, for all your self-
devotion in staying here? but never mind, Sina,
you shall be rewarded-richly rewarded,- A~r
George! shall you !" the squire would exclaim,
with enthusiastic gratitude.
Thus the instincts, the inspirations of the old
lady were neglected as the senseless gibberish
of dotage, while the falsities of the doubly-dyed
traitress were received as so much holiness and
truth. Her intuition soon divined the influence
this fatal girl possessed with her son-the ascen-
dency she was gradually gaining over him; and
daily would she bow her pure heart before this
polluted power, and plead for her she loved.
"Send for Winny! Let Winny come home-
and take the rest! that is all I want in this
world! Winny home !" and daily the deceitful
girl would promise that "Winny shall come to-
inorrow"-and daily that promise would be
broken, and the sad plaint would recur, "Oh! I
shall never see Winny again! never no more!"
But the words do npt suggest the tone of deep
despair in which they were uttered. Thus day
after day, in sickening "ho~.e deterred," lingered
this loving and suffering heart zWho cars guess
the 'torture-the anguish of this soul. feeling
most poignantly all the sorrows of a bereave-
ment she could yet neither understand nor cure.
She seemed once to feel that Winny was suffer-

Winny Darling had been brought up with even
more tenderness than Southern girls usually
are-a grandmother's pet from earliest infancy--
an only ghild of his idolized and lost wife, a fa..
thor's half-worshipped darling-the heiress be.
sides of an Immense fortune-Winay had been
surrounded $pm babyhood with a love and an
observance that had guarded her from even the
5

idea of inconvenience of any sort, much less from
hardship. ~o much love-and I had almost said
reverence, paid to a child naturally less amiable
than Winny wos~d have spoiled her disposition,
as it spoiled her ability. In her father's house
Miss Darilug had been wakened by her maid
every morning at seven o'clock to take her bath.
Then while sitting at her ease, her hair had been
combed out and curled, and her shoes and stock-
ings put on, and afterward her morning toilet
completed without a thought or an act of her
own in the matter. Old Nerve had washed and
dressed her "little missed" when she was six
day. old, and she continued to do it when she was
sixteen yenrs without a thought of ceasing. Her
grandmother, too, had expressed an opinion that
it was much better for a young maiden likeMiss
Darling to have an old, faithful and attached
dressing-maid, than a young and thoughtless one
as ignorant as herself. So Nerve had remained
in her service, petting and spoiling her to her
heart's content, and guarding her as carefully
from learning to think or act for herself, as she
would have shielded her from war, pestilence, or
famine. Winny's rooms, wardrobe, books, mu-
sic, pictures, etc., were kept in order; and her
walks, rides, baths, etc., arranged without a
single volition of her own will in the matter. It
was one of the "thirty-nine articles" of their re-
ligious creed to love and nerve Miss Darling. Or
if Winny did any little voluntary bit of work, it
was some unnecessary trifle to which her altec-
tionate heart alone would prompt her-such as
displacing her grandmother's maid, for the sake
of bathing, rubbing and caressing the old lady'~
feet, or doing the duty of her father's body ser-
vaint by mixing his mint-julep, and setting him
to swearing by spoiling it! Upon such occa-.
sions hewantedto know whatthe mischief waste
use of his having half a thousand of lazy negroes,.
if his daughter had to wait upon him like a foot-
boy-he wanted to know, for instance, what wae
the utility of anybody having dogs and barking
themselves? And if Winny put in any sweet, af~
fectionate word about the duty and the pleasure of
waiting on her father, he would call it iomantic
rubbish, and say that things were adapted to
uses, and uses to things, and that to put Winny
Darling to mixing toddy-was about as wise as to
take one of her own silk scarfs to wipe tumblers
with. lam sorry to acknowledge it-but as there
is necessity upon me to speak and write the truth
without idealizing-it must be 'confessed that
these instances betray more innate vulgarity
than chivalric feeling in the pride of our fat and
fair-haired squire.
Madam Winifred, with all her refinement, fully
appreciated the religious sentiment in Winny's
love and proffered services, though she veuld
sometimes say to her-
"There are other and more useful ways of ro.

dealing affection, my own darling, than by these
menial services that any other might do as well."
"Ah, but, grandmother, don't you know that
the more humble a service is, the deeper the plea-
sure it gives me? When I am sitting on the
floor bathing your dear, white feet, grandmother,
or when I am combing out your long, soft hair-
1 have a fueling if profound content as when I
hush my heart and bow my head to receive the
priest's benedicite."
And sometimes in a lighter mood she would
say-
"Indeed, grandmother, you would let me be
your little waiting-maid, if you only believed
what an hourly satisfaction, what a real sub-
stantial earthly bread and meat satisfaction it
would be to me 1 It is such a starvation of the
heart to keep my hands away from any one I
love; and it is such a down-right heartfelt content
-such a feast to be fingering about them."
But I have been led too far from the point of
time. Now all was changed with Winny. She
had fallen, smote down to the earth by the sud-
den news that her beloved grandmother was
dying ;-fainting from the loss of blood, she had
been carried into the small tavern and laid upon
an humble bed in a hot, close little room, which
was nevertheless the best one in the house.
When restoratives were applied, and she re-
covered from one faintisig fit with renewed rea-
son and memory, it was only to fall into another
and more dangerous one. Indeed the physician
said that it was only the free bleeding at the
lungs, dangerous though it was, and the extreme
physical prostration caused thereby, together
with the counter irritation, that preserved her
brain and saved her reason from a total and
final overthrow I Thus for weeks she lay alter-
nating between death-like swoons, and short con-
9iilsi've spasms of life, of keenest anguish and
remorse!
And all this time Ardenne, in the bitterness
of a sorrow and repentance scarcely lese than
her own, watched by her bedside; nor night
nor day, for an hour, resigned his post-while
flesh and health and strength passed from him
unnoticed, until he grew as thin, as pale, and
almost as feeble as the wan, wan form languish-
ing, withering before him. Was it a really sin-
cere repentance then? Did they indeed wish
that their error could be blotted out-the ill-
starred marriage under the rock could be an-
nulled, and each restored-she to her family, he
to his freedom? No! no! no! by all the mu-
tual anguish, by all the remorse that only served
to kiiit their hearts more closely together-no!
Each felt in the first calmly conscious meeting
of their eyes, 'each felt more than ever now, in
this season of bitter trial-that were the whole
past to be lived over, the error would be com-
mitted, the anguish risked again! No! no! no-
thing but the hopeless, the impossible defection

of one, or of the other, could have brought either
to wish their act annulled. Yet Squire Darling,
quoting the familiar proverb, "When poverty
comes in at the door, love flies out at the win.
dow," hoped and believed that their attachment
would in a few weeks, or months, be starved, Os
frozen, or fatigued out. And it may be so with
a hasty, fanciful and factitious sentiment, a tin-
sel counterfeit of the pure gold of affection-but
theirs, with all the sin and sorrow it had caused,
was nevertheless, deep, earnest and true-may
their patience and fidelity atone for and redeem
them! Their honey-moon was not that of ro-
mantic young lovers-though be it remembered
both were vry young, he nineteen,~ she sixteen.
No! it had been passed in agony of body and
anguish of mind, prostrate upon a bed of extreme
illness by Winny, and in constant, fatiguing sor-
rowful and remorseful watching by Ardenne!
But they were unselfish, disinterested, devoted
-and this sorrow endeared them to each other
more, oh, how much more than weeks passed in
health and revelry. Every care he lavished
upon the languishing one-every fatigue he in-
dured for her sake, but deepened his affection for
her-but riveted his attachment to her. "I
am proving what the inspired angel mid," he
thought, "I am proving that bodily pain and
fatigue, without moral suffering, endured for a
loved one, is a deep, religious joy-with and for
moral suffering, it is an alleviation, or cure!"
Her suffering, his devotion, their youth and
beauty and warm affection, drew around them
the sympathies of all the small town; yes! the
sympathies even of the cold-hearted gathered
around their loves, as the shivering dr~iw-around
a warm hearth for its pleasant heat. Of course
the whole story was known. And I am afraid
Squire Darling's conduct and character suffered
more severe animadversion than was strictly
just. The two best physicians of the county,
Doctors Tidball and Lackland, attended her, yet
both declared that all their science would have
been powerless to have saved her life, had it not
been for the constant, the vigilant, the untiring
care of Ardenne, and the inspired tact, amount..
ing almost to a sixth sense, with which he in-
stantly detected the mutations and crisis of hat
illness. With all this care her life was saved,
but it was four weeks before it was deemed safe
to tell her any news that might startle or sur-
prise. At last, about the first of October, she
was told that her grandmother still lived-that
though paralyzed, there was no immediate fear of
her death. But, oh! could Winny rejoice in
that spared life, with that shattered frame, and
ruined mind? Her slow, extremely slow con-
valescence, was passed in penitential tears and
prayers, alas! so inconsistently! for a fault she
felt she should commit again, were the tempta-
tion again before her. But perhaps Winny
prayed, as I am afraid too many of us do quite

unconsciOusly pray; namely-to be forgiven, to
be remitted the just punishment of the sin, not
to be cleansed from the dear sin itself! And for
Ardenne, it did seem too severe-it would have
~ wearied out any one less patient than himself,
4 to find that after all his devotion to her, after all
his nigiits and days of extreme fatigue and aux-
iety, that after his almost miraclons res'ora-
tion of her life-her convalescence should be
passed in weeping and ~ailing; but he .ever
thought of that! never, nesnr grew tired of try-
ing to soothe, to console her. Thus passed tue
second month of their marriage.
it was the first ~f Noveriber before she was
able to leave her room. She wrote to tier father
~ imploring his forgiveness-imploring perm tssicn
only to come and see her poor, dear grandmother.
To this letter she received this curt and sharp
reply.

Ardenne and Winny were sitting gather
when this cruel letter came. She read it, and
the sudden, deep despair that struck all color
from her very lips, revealed to Ardenne the death
of her hopes. Winny looked at him, and held
the letter towards the fire.
"Yes! burn it, darling !" said Ardenne, di-
vining her embarrassment; and she let it go
into the blaze, and dropp~ d herself into the kind
arms opened to receive her. Not a word more
was said about the letter.
"Winny, love I we must leave this place, do
you not know it?"
"Oh, yesl"
"There are two plans, Winny, that I have to
propose to you. The first is, that -ye shall go to
the Western country-to begin life with a new
territory, a young couple a young State, and
grow with it Tuere. Wina', should not dread

-- But, Edgar! I could not, upon that account,

"Love! love! I am not twenty, yet-itaying
here a few years, would not 'blight' all my fu.

all yours It is that I would avert, Winny. - -
"Ardenne! will you do as you please-being
sure that I shall know it to be altogether
right?"
"But I would have your counsel, Winny."
"Ah! I wish I could assist you with my
thoughts-but I have no knowledge of the world,
you hOow."
"Your thoughts are purer-your counsel really
wiser for that, my love-knowledge of the world
is oftentimes a gambler's knowledge of tricks
at cards-and we do not wish to enter life as a
game, dear; so give me your honest thoughts."
'-Oh, but Edgar! m- judgment is not good"
"You have been told so, dear, until you be-

that you have a poor judgment, anc then let it

this march of life, Ido not wish 'o goon in advance
alone, selfishly laying out the future and turning
to consort with you, only in hours of idleness
and relaxation No! I love you too entirely-
too wholly; we must be one in mind, as in
heart; I would have you go step by step with
me-if you fail to come up, I must fall back.
Now to return to this subject, Winny, we must
decide it soon. What is your opinion ?"
" Dear Edgar; can I take the responsibility
of advising you when inclination so strongly
biases the little judgtnent I have-"
"And this inclination, Winny; I divine it.
In a word, it was settled between them that
they should remain in the neighborhood for the
present. And then he drew a small table to the
tire, between them, and said,
"Now, dear, let us see what we have to com-
mence with," and taking out his purse~ one that
Winny had knit for him, he turned its 'onteats
upon the board-" Nineteen dollars." He wrote
down that sum, and then taking his watch,
chain and pencil, placed them with the money-
"They cost two hundred dollars-they will
bring half price ;" he wrote down one hundred.
A seal ring drawn from his little finger was
added to the pile, and "ten dollars" added to
the list. Then ~ very small diamond broach,
which he valued at fifteen dollars, completed the
sum. And Winny drew from her finger a small
ring, a ruby heart, set around with pearls, and
laid it with the others, sax ing,
"That is all I have; I never carried a purse
of money, or a watch and chain, never having

had use for either; but that little ring is valu-
able, I think, as a ring."
And Ardenne silently took it up, and would
have replaced it on the small finger, but with a
smile she stopped him, pointing to the third
finger of her left hand, 8he said.
"See I I have still another ring! a dearer ring,
that shall never leave my finger!"
"We have about a hundred and fifty dollars
then, dear."
"Oh! I have more jewelry at home, a great
deal more-a complete set of pearls and a com-
plete set of sapphires-I wonder if I were to
send for my wardrobe, if father would Bend them
to me?"
"Do not send for them, Winny."
"And then there is my-little Sea Foam-a
small fortune to you and me."
"lie must be returned to your father's
stables, dear. It should have been done long
ago, but I waited to speak to you on the sub-
ject."
"But why? why ?-he was purchased for
me."
"For your tese, dear; you were a minor; you
owned nothing-not your palfrey-not your
jewelry."
"Still, if we send Sea Foam home, my father
will send him back, since no one wants him
there; and it my father happens to think of my
wardrobe, books, piano, and all my little per-
sonal effects, he will be sure to send them, for
he may be furious and destroying, but not mean
in his revenge."
"I shall be glad for your sake then, dear
Winny."
That same evening Ardenne hired a man to
take back Sea Foam to Oak Grove. He himself
get in the stage and rode to Winchester, to diu-
pose of their jewelry, which, contrary to his cx
pectations, brought them nearly two hundred
dollars. With that he returned to Winny, and
to settle their debts that had remained unpaid up
to this time.
Then it was that Ardenne tasted for the first
time one of the "sweets" of adversity, in find-
ing how much goodness, how much simple gene-
rosity, and guileless, unconscious magnanimity,
may exist among the roughest and most unpre-
tending of our fellow creatures. First he called
for the host and his bill, and the little, fat
landlord, with his round, baby face and simple
manner, entered the parlor.
"I have to apologize for not asking for, and
settling my bill before, Mr. Smiley-but----well!
Mrs. Ardenne and myself leave you to-day, and
so I wish to settle with you now."
Now this little, round landlord had a bad name
in the county-a thriftless, good-for-nothing fel-
low, always in debt, always behind hand, never
quite sober-though never altogether drunk. At
this moment he had not five dollars in his tili,

kept hotel that now marks the site where then
stood the little tavern, kept by the little land-
lord, Sammy Smiley, the brother of the priest's
housekeeper.
"Have you the bill about you, sir ?"
The little host sat down in a chair, drew up
his feet, rubbed and 8troked his little, fat knees,
and-smiled. Ardenne was standing before him,
pocket-book in hand, enacting patronizing wealth.
"The bill, if you please, sir-- we are hurried"
"The bill! oh-aye-yes, to be sure! the bill
-I-l'v~ mislaid it some where-it-it's lost-
some other time !"
"Can't you recollect the amount, sir 7"
"The amount! oh! yes, certainly, the

head! 'pon my word, I don't know what the
amount was-any other time will do as well I"
"Be so good as to make it out again, if you
please, sir."
"I-I--.l haint time-indeed, indeed I haint I"
said the landlord, with awkward embarrassment,
yet looking so lovingly at the poor young phiu-
as if his little lymphatic body were about to deli-
quesce in tears.
"It will take you but a moment, Mr. Smi-
icy!"
"But I haint that moment to spare I indeed,
indeed I haint! I'm very busy-I'm-i'm awfully
pushed with work! I - I 'dare to heaven,
I am!" persisted the landlord, looking, in every
soft curve of his gentle face and frame, the very
image of an easy mind and infinite leisure!-
Ardenne could not fail to understand his simple
hypocrisies now. He seized his little, chubby
hand, and pressing it fervently, said,
"Smiley, mydear friend, I see your motive,
and from the bottom of my heart thank you for
your kindness; but you know, my good fellow,
I cannot, with any sort of self-respect-'
Here the little host broke in, blushing like a
school-boy detected in lying, and exclaimed,
"Oh, my dear sir? Mr. Ardenne! 1 hadn't
such a thought! I insult a gentleman in that
way, because he is a little unfortunate, or so?-
never!

"I wanted to say," said Winny, taking the
host's other chubby hand between her own deli-
cate ones, "I wanted, so much, to 'say, that we
should have more than the wickedness of Luci-

nerves of the small arm resting on his own, throb

carriages and horses were very expensive, and
economy must commence some time.

while," tie said, and arranged taer seat under a
tree upon the side of the hill. with some broken
pieces of rock, seated her carefully, and sitting
by tier side, put his arm around her waist, and
drawing her head down on his bosom, looked
into her sweet wan face With such intense, ab-
sorbing interest, as to seem, for a while, quite
lost in the breathless contemplation How
faded, how broken she looked already! Oh. she
was dying like a plucked dower on his bosom,
and he c~iuld never survive her, he thought.-
Winny's sweet eyes, upturned to his, read the
poor boy's thought, and she replied, softly
smiling-
"Do not be uneasy about me, dear Edgar 1-
You know people recovering from illness are
always weak I am ashamed of my long-con-
tinued weakness, and shall try to grow strong.
I am gaining strength every day-"
Here she was interrupted by that slight, but
constantly recurring cough.
"This will not do, either, dear; the dews are
beginning to fall, and you will take cold," said
ne, and alter looking at her a moment with a
faint smile, he stooped suddenly, and before she
could object, raised her light form in his arms,
and bore her up the hill. Arrived at the top, he
put her down, and drawing her arm again within
his own, they resumed their walk.
"At least, now, there are some things, and
they are the best things, too, that poverty cannot
deprive us of, Edgar! Oh, Edgar! if it were
not for-" and here she stopped, as if unwilling
to sadden him uselessly, by an allusion to their
mutual and irreparable error,-and here, too,
she made a silent resolution never to trouble
film again with her remorse.
"What were you saying, love ?"
"I say, Edgar, that the wealth, ease, &amp;nd
luxury which we have lost, are nothing in com-
parison to the blessings that yet remain to us.

Ardenne grew pale, stopped, and while one

her, the ot~ier hand was l8id upon the left side
of her bosom-and looking earnestly into her
face, he inquired, very seriously-
"Winny, dear, tell me, and tell me truth-
this wound of yours !-there is no outward sign
of its existence remaining-but-do you feel it
still?"
Winny remained silent, her cheek flushed, she
looked down.
" Tell me, Winny."
"Edgar I"
"Nay, dear, you must tell me! It us post

Yes"
Ardenne became very much agitated; it was
with the utmost effort at self-control, that he
could.speak steadily.
"How ?-tell me all about it, my love."
"Well, then, it is always burning, burning, as
if a small coal of fire was there-it is that
which flushes up my left cheek ~
Ardenne suppressed a heavy groan.
'And when you draw a long breath, Winny,
does it hurt you more ?"
"Yes I when I cough, or raise my voice, or
draw a long breath, a sharp, burning pain darts
from that spot, and scatters all over my chest,
and flushes up my cheek."
The suppressed groan now burst forth in
agony.
Don't grieve, Edgar 1-dear Edgar, don':,
please don't-it is a worse anguish to see you
grieve; besides, I know how to prevent this
pain!"
"Ifow, dear I"

aunty ?" inquired Ardenne.
"Why you see, sir, I quiress of every one I
sees from Harper's Ferry 'bout ray gall, cause
you see, Manse Edgar, I missed her, an' the
Bible say-a 'oman never forgets her nussin chile
-so I couldn't, which proves the Bible to be
true !-so when Billy Smilie, the tavern keeper's
son, at Harper's Ferry, fetches home the pony,
I 'quired arter Miss Winny, an' he telled me how
you had rented an' fixed up Pine Cliffs, an' was
a goin there this evening , so first 1 thought 'good
Lord-he gwine carry her to de debil's icy
peak?' an' then I thought i'd come here die
evening' an' make all warm for her-cause you
see, Marse Edgar, I nussed her-"
And while she talked the old woman went on
arranging the table, filled up the tea-pot, set it
on the waiter, put on the plate of toast and set
two chairs to the table, and as Edgar led Winny
to the head of the table, old Nerve took her place
at the back, as she had been acc~tstomed to stand
at the hack of her master's chair at the head of
the table at Oak Grove. After supper Nerve
took the tea things out and washed them up and
replaced them in the cupboard. Then, as it was
growing dark, she closed the shutters, let down
the paper blinds, mended the fire, lighted a can-
dle and placed it on the table between Winny
and Edgar, and then said,
"Now, Miss Winny, honey! it's time fur me
to be a-walkin', but 'fore I go jes you tell me
wha you' an' Marie Edgar s'iled clothes Is, so I
may get 'em an' take 'em home to wash and
iron 'em-I bring 'em back to morrow, cause
you see, honey, I gwine come up here every day
an' do fhr you-'deed I am! don't care what ole
master say! he needn't know everything!"
"No, Nerve! that must not he! Father would
not consent to any such thing as your coming
here or doing anything for us if he knew it, and
you must do noViing without his knowledge !"
"Now, Miss Wiany, see here! you think I
such a darned etarnal fool ~s to tear my frock oft
my back 'bout ole Inarster's 'fernal nonsense?

SHANNO

no indeed! I gwine come see arter my
chile!"
"No, Nerve, you must riot! we are much
obliged to you. Winny feels your kindness, bat
you must not offend Squire Darling by coming
here without his knowledge and permission."
"Kik.kik-kik! (laughing) You.dem think I
gwine send my mortal soul to de debil by 'dul-
ging that forsok ole sinner in his cussed infan-
nelly whims? No, Marster! when I sot out to

else how I spect my hebenly Marster see arter
me?"
"Please don't speak of my father so, though,
Aunt Nerve, but tell me how he is and who
mixes his toddy every day I"
"Miss Sina Hinton does."
"God bless Sinai tell her 1 say so, Nerve."
"Danno as I shall! 'fore my hebenly Jesus I
don't know what to make o' that there young
gall! I don't indeed! there ain't one soul on the
yeth can do a singly thing with ole master

time I ever catches him asleep!"
Soon after this the old woman took her leave,
and Winny rousing herself from deep thought,
said,
"Edgar! if it were possible for Sina to like
my father well enough, I could wish him to marry
her I She would console him for the loss of me!
She would bring his declining years great com-

or that the coldness of the mountain air was, as
yet, too great a stimulant for her, I know not;
but that night, their first at home, *inny cough-
ed all night; and it was near or quite day, when
she fell into a deep sleep of complete exhaus-
tion. Even then there was no sleep for Ar-
denne Notwithstanding all he spoke, and hoped,
and tried to believe, an insufferable anxiety
seized and preyed upon his heart. He raised
upon his elbow, and watched her by the faint
morning light. Both her little arms-so thin
and white now f-were thrown up over her head
upon the pillow, with that helpless abandon so
piteous to see in the versj weak. Even the de-
ceptive flush ~iad faded from her cheek, and the
pale yellow locks escaped in her restlessness
from the little lace cap, clung damp and clammy
to the cheek and bosom, bathed with the ex-
hausting "night sweat." Her breathing was
distressing, short, quick, interrupted; or, if s
long breath seas drawn, it was emitted like a
shuddering sigh, while a spasm of pain would
contract the wan face, and a slight convulsion
agitate the fragile form. As he watched her
sleep of deep prostration, and her painful and
spasmodic breathing, Ardenne bitterly reproach-
ed himself; but with that singular propensity of
miad that draws us to analogies even in hours
of extreme distress, he thought of the bird he
had caught and crushed in his hand, through his
eagerness to possess it; of the flower he had
plucked which had withered on hi'. bo~om, and
he looked upon this poor, fragile, fadii'i~ human
flower, rudely torn from the parent strm. and
dying on its bed; and he groaned-he rentedd
so that had her sleep been other than the pro-
found lethargy of prostrated weakness it must
have awakened her.
He arose, and opening a window at some die
tance from the bed, to ~,et in the cool, clear
morning air, he dressed himself and went down
stairs, leaving her still asleep. He opened the
shutters of their parlor-or kitchen, as ~ oa will,
for it served for both-and began to make a
fire. Leaving it blazing and crackling, he took
a pail and went to the s~irsng, and, returning,
filled the teadrettle, and set it over the fire.
Ardenne knew more of domestic economy than
Winny. The only child of a youthful and wi-
dowed mother, he had received the education
both of a girl and a boy. And, by the way, I
have noticed that by far the most amiable, the
most considerate, the most gentle and sympa-
thetic men, where women are concerned, are
those brought up from infancy to manhood by
widowed mothers. I suppose the reason is
plain enough-the early chastening of sorrow,
-perhaps early acquaintance with privation,
toil and disappointment, and, above all, early
and intimate acquaintance with women's pecu-
liar trials. The Angel of Sorrow does tiet pre.

And saying this, and promising to return by
noon. A.rdenne left the house
Winny occupied the time of his absence witi
looking through her new home, and finding oul
where everything was placed.
Woile waiting the result of his adverise~nent.
Ardenne was not idle. lie would rise in the
morning, and while Winny Was preparing theix
simple breakfast, he would go out upon the
mountain with his gun, and return with a brace
of wild fowl. All the forenoon he would read
law, seated at a table before the window
of their sitting-room, while Winny sewed by
his side In the afternoon he took an axe and
went to the pine forest and cut woo to pile
up for winter use. Later he would take his
angling-rod and go down to the banks of the She-
nandoah to fish, aad return with a fine lot. His
hopes the first week were very high.
"After all, dear Winny, if you were not the
spoiled child of wealth and luxury, this hall
savage life would not be amiss !"
"Oh! J.'should like it of all things, if my dear-
est grandmother were well, my father recon-
oiled. and I could only get rid of this burning
pang in my left chest!"
Every mail day Ardenne would go down to
Harper s Ferry, but in vain No "commrini-
cation addressed to E. A SHarper's Ferry, Vir-
ginia," was there to claim the promised "prompt
attention." And at the end of the second week
he began to grow very anxious. He kept at
work, however, saying, cheerfully, to Winny-
"There is always something to be done, my
dear Winny, and I have observed through life
that people waste more time in waiting the
result of future contingencies than in any other
manner."
Ardenne had laid aside from his small store,
a sum of money to pay the bills of the physician
and the tavern-keeper. The third week passed
and Ardenne received no answer to his advertise-
ment. Then he withdrew it, substituting an-
other wiehaut restriction as to place This was
also unsuccessful. Next he advertised for a
situation as clerk in a lawyer's office - private
secretary to a gentleman. or bcok-keeper in a
store in vain! Those who have no necessity
for labor, or who find employment sufflient to
supply their wants, have rio idea of the wearing
anxiety of one seeking work from week to week
and finding none--while expenses are going on,
or a family is suffering. Ardenne was sick at
heart-everything seemed at a stand 'till-the
world to be stationary A graveyard sort of

e needless to society; still they continued to do
"whatever" their hands founil "to do."
~ "For at least, Winny, here is an opportunity
of putting ~his place in complete order," snid
Ardenne, and between the times of his reading
law, he would work at making a wood-houor ad-
joining the cottage and filling it with wood ready
cut. Winny, on her part, with the assistance arid
instruction of Hettie Smilie, the innkeeper's
daughter, had made up her own plain dresses and
put Ardenne's wardrobe, which was n great
disarray, into complete order. Then Hettie said
to her,
"If I were you, Mrs. Ardenne-"
"Call me Winny, Hettie."
"1 always forget to-if I were you 1 would
put up some preserves for winter use."
"But they are expensive luxuries and we do
not need them."
"Yes! they as-a expensive luxuries if you put
them up with double refined loaf sugar-pound
for pound, like your grandmother used to-bur
suppose you get toe coarse brown sugar, and
clarify it yourself, and put up some plume and
grapes-that will be cheap, and you will find
that often in the winter, when you are not able
to get a regular dinner, a cup of tea and bread
and butter, with a saucer of preserves, will go
very well. So, Mrs. Ardenne, we will go if you
please into the forest to-morrow with two bas-
kets and gather some wild grapes, and wild
piums also, if any are yet to be found-and next
day I will show you how to put them up, so as
it will cost almost nothing but the work."
Ard so accordingly they did.
Fiettie remained a week with Winny, and
then Willie Smilie, her cousin, came for her.
Widie had something in a bag on one side of his
~addle, which he brought in* and set upon the
floor-and while Hettie was getting her bonnet,
Willie, with many blushes, opened the bag and
drew lorth-a stone jar for putting up preserves,
and holding it up, he stammered.-~-
I was along by Mr. What-his-name's store
to-day, and saw this here, and I thought it was
party, and so I bought it, like a great many things
don't want, and so-and-so-"
Oh, hush, Willie, your hypocrisies are as
coarse and as easily seen through as a wicker
chicken-coop! Mrs. Ardenne, he wants to make
you a present of a blue stone jarand he does not
know how to do it-dear Mrs. Ardenne, do take
it from him, poor fellow, for with all his rude-r
ness, he is so sensitive, that he will never get
over it if you hurt his feelings by refusing," ad.
ded Hettiein alow voice-unheardby hercousin,
who blushing purple, had set the jar down in a
trepidation.
"is this for me ?" asked Winny, taking it up
and looking at Willie.

"Nerve told me something of that."

"For Heaven's sake, Harriette! don't talk so

"Ttiere it is again! I tell you that those are

for Uncle Burleigh has sold my palfrey, and put
the money in the poor-purse-he ought to have
put it in our own, for I don't know a poorer

"'Then I presume if you could reach her, you
would like to see Mrs. Ardenne?'
"'Shouldn't I like to see Winny?'
"'In that case, I will give orders that a pal-
frey be taken over to Sacred Heart, to remain
there for your use, as long as shall be agreeable
-good-morning,' and with a quiet, imperial,
half-abstracted air, she passed from the room;
so that you see, Winny, I owe the pleasure of
this visit to Miss Summerfield, at last."
"flow I should love my cousin, if she would
only let me I"
"There is something so strange about Miss
Summerfield-a beautiful solemnity of brow, as
of one who walking in the light of a high reve~
rence inspires the same feeling in others. But
Winny, dear, I bring you a message from Miss
Mattie Smilie; she says she thinks that the air
of the valley will now be a beneficial change for
you, and she wants you to come and stay a week
with her."
"That is so kind in her; they are the sweetest
family, those dear Smilies; tell her that whether
I come or not, 1 shall feel very grateful for her
goodness. Here comes Edgar."
As Ardenne came in, and not seeing their visi-
tor, kissed Winny, Harriette jumped up t'u4ex-
claimed, "Me, too, Edgar! you are on my kis-
sing list now I"
"And pray how long is the said list, Miss
Harry, that one may know the extent of the
compliment ?"
"Don't speer questions, Mr. Edgar! Does the
extent of the compliment depend upon the length
of the list 7"
"Don't speer questions, Miss Harry! No! but
on the sk.orgness of it."
"Then I beg you to feel highly flattered, for
my kissing list boasts but one name-Winny
Ardenne-that is all."
"Then it shall be a variation of that pretty
name, Miss Harry," smiled Ardenne, as his lips
lighted swiftly upon her half-laug4ing, haif-peut..

you place another name upon your list, erase

Harriette's face flushed with indignation, and
she remained silent for awhile; then-
"Have you, Miss' Summerfield, no power
with Squire Darling ?"
Imogene lifted her heavy lashes, but before
her slow reply was formed, Mr.. Summerfield
answered,
"Miss Summerfield must not expose herself
to her uncle's violence of temper, Harriette."
"Very well, then," thought Harry; "thank

"'Beard the lion in his den,

This was Harriette's secret resolution, but she
did not express it. Something of a natural,
though quiet kauteur in the manners both of the
elder and the younger lady, ever chilled Har..
riette into reserve. Soon she took her depar-
ture, declining Mrs. Summerfield's invitation t.

Unto that asking makes a sad reply.  ZVicoll.
Nothing could be more dreary than the aspect
of Oak Grove, as Harriette approached it. Every
thing about the plantation bore testimony to the
despairing neglect of its master. It was very
evident that Squire Darling no longer rode at
morn and eve all over his estate to see with his
own eyes that every thing was done properIy~
It was proved that he no longer heeded his favo-
rite proverb, that, "The master's eye doth
more work than the servants' hands." Fences
were broken; gates down; fields littered; cattle
straying; negroes dozing in the blazing autumn
sun; every thing bore marks of indifference auid
neglect. Harriette's spirits fell, oppressed by
the scene.

change was here! This fine, heavily-shaded
lawn, which it used to be the easy task of a
score of little negro children to keep perfectly
clean and smooth, free alike from litter, weeds,
or fallen leaves,-this lawn was now grown
thickly up with thistles, drying in the autumn
sun, tall Jamestown weeds, rank with ripe pol-
eon, and filling all the air with their baleful eflIn-
via, and drifts of dried leaves that rattled and
rustled noisily under her horse's hoofs. As yet,
she had seen not a single soul beyond the lazy
group of negroes she had left in the field, dozing
in the hot sun. As she wended her way up the
grass-grown walk, a large snake started up be-
fore her horse's hoofs, and glided swiftly away.
A superstitious awe had been slowly gathering
over Harriette's spirit, and now a shock of fear
thrilled through her nerves. She looked up at
The house. The front doors and windows were
all closed. Cobwebs were stretched across those
of Winny's deserted rooms; dried leaves had
fallen and lodged in them, and the little insect
called the mason, had built its house of' clay in
the corners of the sills. Deserted, desolate,
and forlorn! Harriette had not spirits to go up
the mildewed stone steps, and ring the rusty
bell. She turned her horse's head and trotted
of! towards the Quarters to find Nerve-giving
a fearful glance behind her, as though she dread-
ed having been seen from the house. The dreary
and forsaken aspect of the place made Harry's
nerves tremble as though she were doing some
wrong, fearing some discovery, and incurring
some punishment. Harry trotted down the hill
to the hollow where were situated the Quarters,
ten little white cabins each side of the street,
with a larger cabin facing down the line at the
upper end. This place looked scarcely less lone-
some than the house. Here in the doors sat
negro women, dawdling over their patching, or
old men smoking, or old grannies with the woolly
heads of young negroes between their knees,
engaged with finger and thumb in a nameless
work of destruction. Each nodded, or spoke
respectfully to Miss Harry as she passed them,
and rode up to Uncle Kill's house. Here she
jumped off her horse, and, passing the little gate,
went in. The front door war open, and gave a
view of Nerve within, seated among baskets of
apples, and pans and dishes, engaged in cutting
up fruit for drying.
"Come in, Miss Harry, chile, come in! 'xcuse
me for not getting' up, 'ca'se my lap's full o'
pains. Sit down, Miss Hairy, honey, sit down!
Row's the ole gen'l'man, Father Bully; God
bless him! Take of your hat, Miss Harry,
chile, an' lay it down on table. Has you seen
anything o' my poor baby? We-dem heerd how
she was staying long o' you I Is she dere yet?"
"She has been staying with us a fortnight,
but has now returned home-she is in very bad
health, Nerve."

"I am going to speak to him about Winny,

"I 'vise you not to! You run your head right
into a hornet's nest, if you so much as mention
her name, let alone plead for her! You better
let him alone !-he tuk leave o' ~li sense an' de-

and drink an' swill, an' every singly thing about

man Kill do the best he can-he's overseer, you
know-but br'! he can't do nothin' 'tall with
the niggers, cause you see, when they 'glects
their duty, he t'reatens how he'll 'port them to

master don't pay, no tensionn to his 'porte-how

"I am sorry to hear he drinks so!"
CC He don't do nothing' 'tall else from' mornin'
till night, chile!"
"Well! anyhow, Nerve; I came here for the
purpose of seeing him, and I intend to see and to
speak to him in Winny's behalf, too!"
"'Fore my hebenly Marster, he'll 'suIt you;
he will indeed, honey!"
"Which way shall I get in, Nerve? the front
part of the house is all shut up."
"Stop, honey I I'll go 'long o' you," said the
old woman, pushing the apple parings out of her
lap into an old basket, and preparing to accom-
pany Harry.
They left the house, Harry leaving her horse
there, and walked towards the Hall. Nerve
conducted her in through the back piazza, and
stopped to ask her whether she would visit "ole
madam" ~1rst, or go into the parlor. Harry de.
cided to see the invalid, and the old woman led
the way up stairs, and to the door of Mrs. Dar-
ling's room. Then the sound of voices made
Nerve pause, and hold up her finger to Harry. It
was Sina's voice, in a high key and insolent tone,
apparently speaking to the old lady.
"And Nerve shall not come up these stairs
with her impudent interference, and her awk-
ward blunders, and her mischief~making. If you
want anything done for you, I'll do it!"
A low and plaintive reply was made to this
rude speech, the only word distinguishable being
"Winny."

SHANNC
"You know it is against the orders of Squire
Darling to send any message, or hold any com-
munication with that young woman, and I am
here to see his orders enforced"
"Come, Nerve! Come! my blood is boiling!
my heart will burst! let me in! it is improper,
an'~ how, to listen-and to such insolence as that!
let me in, Nerve, and stop that indignity, or 1
shall lose my reason, burst the door open, seize
that impudent girl and shake the breath out of
her body! Let rue in, Nerve; for 1 do not want
to forget myself."
Nerve, with an "1-told-you-so" look, opened
the door and followed her into the room. The
ol~ lady was sitting in her arm-chair, the very
rure of imbecile suffering. Hariettte went to
her and spoke very respectfully (purposely omit-
ting to see Sina.)
"Oh! how do you do, my dear? Did you
know that Winny was gone ?" she inquired, with
an appealing look of grief.
"Yes, I know it-i saw Winny this morning 1"
'-Did you! did you! Oh. how is Winny "'
"She was over at our house she sent her love
to you," replied Harry, evading the question of
her health.
"Over to your house! and did not come to see
me!-does she know, does Winny know that I am
h.elpless-r hat I have lost the use of my limbs ?"
"Yes, Winny knows it, and grieves about it."
"Tell her not to grieve! tell her not to grieve
-tell Winny I do very well! she mustn't grieve!
she mustn't grieve I you mustn't tell her any-
thing to make her grieve. I'm sorry now she
lnows I am helpless; but why don't Winny come
to see me, then ?"
"She wants to come, but they won't let her."
~CWho won't? who won't? It's my house-
my jointure house! and no one has a right to
prevent her !-she shall come! tell her so! tell
her to come! i'll see !" said the old lady, the
spirit of her youth flashing fitfully up.
"Really, Miss Harriette Joy! I shall be forced
to request you to leave the room, if yoh excite
Mrs. Darling in this manner!" said Miss Hin~
ton, coming forward.
Harry sprang sharply around, confronting the
girl, and flashed upon her a look of such blight-
ing scorn and indignation, that the audacity of
tbe wily girl nearly wilted under it, and she
continued more quietly-
"Mrs, Darling cannot bear the least excite-
ment, and the name of Winny-"
"Mrs Ardenne, I presume you mean," said
Harry, haughtily.
"Mrs. Ardenne, then," continued Sina, with
an imperceptible smile, "is a forbidden name
in this house!"
Harry fixed her dark eyes, blazing with insuf-
ferable light, upon those of Sina Ilinton, 'ud
tending her arm, pointed to the 'oor, saying,
"Sins kiinton, leave the room! I overheard

Sina Hinton recovered er momentary quail.
ing, and smiling, toucied the bell Harry re-
garded her with as much surp. '- as indignation,
and something even oi' admiration. She had
changed very much within the last t~w in'neiitw.
There was a sort of attraction, glamour, witch-
craft, or what not, about that thin, pierce face,
that being neither beauty noi- goodness, was
more fascinating thai either -it was unity,
power, strength, a diabolical individuality - The
bell was answered by a servant, to whom she
said,
"Tell your master that I crave his presence
for a few moments in this room."
She spoke with an air of assured authority,
and the man, bowing with great respect, with-
drew to obey her.
"Leave the room, Minerva," was her next
order.
And old Nerve, saying to Harriette as she
passed-" Let us go, Miss Harry. for Sam is
going to be riz here directly!" went oui.
The step ol Squire Darling was heard upon
the stairs, and $ina turned er dark, bright
face, with its stiletto lignt gleaming out ii"-
tween the wilderness of black, shining ringlets,
with a fierce smile upon Harriette..
The squire entered the' room, saving, with a
maudlin fondness-
"What does my lightning-bug-what does
my little fire-fly-what does my sprite want
with me, now ?"
His face was flushed, his eyes blood-shot, his
step unsteady, and he sunk heavily inro a chair.
Harriette saw, and groaned in the spirit
"Well, what does my little mustard-seed
want with me, now ?"
"Send that girl from the house !"
"That girl !-whieh girl ?" asked the poor
man, his inflamed eyes flying around the room,
and settling on Harriette. "Oh! that's Miss
Harry !-that's little Nimrod !-musn't send ker
away I"
"Then, Squire Darling, I must go," said
Miss Hinton, a flush rising to he~ brow.
"You! you go! oh, never-stop! I'll send
her oft! i'll do anything you tell me to do,
Sins 1-tell me to march up before the whole
congregation-up the altar-steps and pull Father

creasing agitation of Miss Summerfield. She
suddenly dropped the subject, and recurring to
another, said-
"I have given orders for the yellow chamber,
with the adjoining dressing-room, to be prepared
for Winny~"
"Thank you, dearest mother! You confer
a benefit on me, also, In giving me some one to
care for, and be kind to-I mean some one who
like the poor invalid, my Cousin Winny, really
needs, really suffers for attention."
The conversation dropped.
Mrs Summerfield took up her knitting, and
lmo~ene fell into her usual state of cold and dark
abstraction. From this she was aroused by the
opening of the door, and the announcement of
Colonel Dangerfield, who immediately after en-
tered the room.             -~
CHAPTER XXI.
COLONEL DANGERFIELD.
He lakes the hand I give not-nor withhold-
Its pulse nor check'd-nor quickea'd-calmly cold,
And still he goes unmourned-returns unsought-
And ott when present-absent from my inought,
Oh! hard it is the heart's recoil to bear,
And hide from one-perhaps another there
Byron.
Colonel Dangerfield entered the parlor, bowing
with his usual grave and stately courtesy. Mrs.
Suinmerfield arose, curtsied, and indicated a seat.
[mogene nodded gravely without rising. Colonel
Dangerfield took the chair on the other side of
the fire-place to that where Imogene was seated,
md immediately entered into conversation with
Ntrs. Summerfield, who was seated between
~hem. Colonel Dangerfield was not a gentleman
ivho considered his duty violated, if he failed on
~oming in to take a seat by his lady-love; nor
~as Mrs. Summerfield a lady who thought po.
witness infringed, by remaining in the room dii-
ing the visit of her daughter's accepted lover.
Indeed, all this party seemed to shrink from
anything very pronounce Nor was it until Mrs.
ummerfield was summoned from the room by
ter housekeeper, that Colonel Dangerfield, taking
inogene's hand, led her to a distant sofa, seated
mer, and stood before her with folded arms and
evere brow. There was nothing lover-like in
~is aspect. Imogene's hands lay folded one
ver the other upon her lap, and her eyes cast
own, seemed fixed upon them. He stood there
contemplating her full a minute, and then said,
"Imogene Summerfield I what is the relation
supposed to be subsisting between us at this mo-
sent?"

SHANNO
She was silent; a sigh or sob fluttered, strug-
gled in her bosom, but did not escape.
"Did you hear my question, Miss Summer-
field?"
"I heard it."
"Will it please you to reply 7"
"I am your betrothed wife-you do not per-
mit me to forget it !" replied she, without raising
her eyes
"In what light do you consider this engage-
ment, Inogene? Will you be so good as to look
at m'~, Miss Summerfield, when replying to my
question ?"
Imogene's brow flushed as she raised her eyes,
with their slow, returning light, slowly to his
face, and fluted them there so steadily, that his
falcon glance fell before their calm, perusing
gaze.
"I inquired, Miss Summerfield, in what light
you were pleased to look on our betrothal 7"
"I hold it to be sacred, inviolable! at least it
shall be so on my side !" answered Imogene, in
a tone so grave and firm, with a sigh, involun-
tary, but so profound, that Colonel Dangerfield
frowning darkly, said,
"You say that, Miss Summerfield, with the
air of a martyr. I pray you, were your inclina-
tions influenced in the least in this matter 7"
"They were influenced, Dangerfield! We were
betrothed, you know, when I was an infant of
five years of age, and you a youth of fifteen! I
was early taught, along with the Cathechism of
the Council of Nice, the Lord's Prayer, the
Apostle's Creed, and the Ten Comtnandrnents, a
love and veneration for you, as one older, wiser,
more enlightened and more accomplished than
myself, and above all, as one who was destined
to be my husband. I had no brother or sister,
and except Winny, who lived at a distance from
me, no cousin! and I thought only of you."
"Yet I was absent at the university!"
"Bat pro gent. with my thoughts always."
"Well! and then!"
Ct And then came the seven years of the revo-
lution! and I, child as I was, had my whole
soul fired with love of country and of liberty--
yes! and admiration of the boy-hero who, at
sixteen years of age, threw down his books and
seized his musket, and who, at twenty-four, re-
turned, illustrious with military glory, and with
the rank he bears now !" replied Imogene, with
something of enthusiasm kindling her pale cheek.
"And then," said Colonel Dangerfield, bit-
terly, "when that boy-who in his first battle,
and in every subsequent field-in all the trisis,
privations, and dangers of his campaigns - in
hunger and in cold-in vigil and in illness-in

battle and in tent-thought only of ON. being-
one small girl-a calm, proud, majestic little
princess of nature whose high heart he thought
wou'd demand illustrious love! when that boy
returned to lay h a laurels-few or many-at
the feet of the maiden-how did she receive him?
You are silent, Imogene I shall I answer ? - She
met him wih a kindling blush of pride and love
on cheek and brow; and when, in his own proper
name and person, he offered to renew his be-
trothal-ho w did she receive his vows ?"
"With pride and joy! With ptide and joy,
Dangerfield! to be a hero's chosen wife; but
with the losrn of a sister, Dangerfield! Alas!
alas! I knew no difference !"
"What wild words are these, Miss Summer.
field? You knew no difference! Do you knee.
a difference ?" inquired Colonel Dangerfield in
a severe tone.
Imogene had dropped her face within her open
palms, and remained silent.
"Those few bright, glorious days! too bright,
too glorious to last! Oh! we might hive known
them for a phantasmagoria! an illusion! a bright
vision vanished! We parted, Imogene-you to
pass three years at school, for you were but fif-
teen; I to my estate, left desolate during the
war, to occupy the time of yout absence with
converting that estate into a paradise for your
reception. The three years are passed. The
full time for the consummation of our marriage
is at hand. You return from school-I claim your
promise; and now you entreat a delay; I accede.
But if I touch your hand it turns cold in mine!
Once I pressed a kiss upon your bro'r that struck
a sudden paleness down your cheeks! You
reeled-I thought you would have fallen! How
is this, Miss Summerfield 7"
Imogene arose, trembling, and would have
left her seat, but he intercepted her. "Alas,
Dangerfield! my hand is yours whene~ er you
claim it. But, oh! listen! before you take it,
you must hear a dark secret! a sin that 1 have
not dared to breathe in the confessional! a sor-
row that I have not dared to confide to my mo-
ther! and whe~n you have heard this secret you
will cast away this hand with scorn! But not
yet! I cannot enter upon it yet! Let me pass,
sir! lam ill! fainting! let me pass to my room!
Dangerfield! I will leave our destiny in your
hands I you shall be the arbiter of mine! I can
do no less, nor more! Goodbye I' and gliding
past him she left the room, leaving him stupified
with astonishment and horror. Recovering
himself at last, he took his hat, and leaving an
apology with a servant for Mrs. Suminerlield,
left the house.

CHAPTER XXII.
THE DAY OF REST.
How still the morning of the hallowed day!
The poor man's day!
The pale mechanic mow has leave to breathe
The morning air pure from the city's smoke,
As wandering slowly up the river's banks,
He meditates on Him whose power he marks
In each green tree that proudly sprends the bough
And in the tiny dew-bent flowers that bloom
Around the roots; and while he thus surveys
With elevated joy each rural charm,
He hopes-yet fears presumption in the hope,
That Heaven may be one Sabbath without end!
Gralsarne.
Yes, it is only those who toil six days in the
week, that feel all the love and mercy shown in
the institution of the Sabbath-in the command
that makes cessation of toil a dials-rest a re-
ligious service. Winny's household-work was
light enough, yet to ~tser delicate frame and sink-
lug health and unaccustomed muscles, it was
toil. She had learned from Hettie all that was
necessary to know in the conducting of her small
message-and now assumed the whole charge of
the cooking, washing, house-cleaning and needle-
work, upon herself; and with her fragility and
inexperience, it took her all day to get through;
and often in the day her frail limbs would fail,
her head would swim, and her sight cloud from
weakness; but never for weariness-never for
pain would Winny pause while anything remain-
ed to be done; and when night came, she would
lie down thoroughly exhausted, yet oftentimes
too much fatigued and excited to compose her-
self to sleep, while the very idea of the inevi-
table duty of rising again early in the morning
to renew the incessant and now painful daily la-
bor would appal her weak nerves, and keep her
awake. Then that constantly recurring, cruel
cough I the first dropping of her weary head upon
the pillow seemed to be the signal for its com-
mencement. it would continue all night. At
dawn, as usual, she would fall into that heavy
sleep and profuse bath of perspiration, i*hile it
seemed that a rapid and exhausting process of
absorption was going on, and from which she
would awake so prostrated that it seemed impos-
sible to get up, and the painful eflo t required all
her little strength and courage. Opiates might
haVe procured her rest, but Ardenne with his
ideas about drugs, objected to their use, assert-
mg that their beneficial tendency was transient,
while their injurious effect was abiding. Then
Ardenne believed that a favorable crisis was ap-
proaching, which, if well watched and improved,
would eventuate in the perfect re-e4abhshment
of her health. This was th hope he held out to
Winny all the time. And Winny knew also,
that the time would come when another claim-

ONDALE.
ant would need all her remaining time and care
and service. it was now therefore with a wish
to improve her time of comparative leisure, that
Winny toiled hard to set her house in order. She
never complained. Ardenne's lot was hard
enough, she said, and he inevitably saw enough
without her complaints.
Dut when the blessed Sabbath day dawned,
the day that made repose not only a privilege
that might not be improved, but a duty that
must be observed, Winny hailed it with grati-
tude. There was no cooking done that day except
that the kettle was boiled, it is true that she
might not be able always to leave the house, but I
in that case she passed the day reclining her
wearied frame upon a little lounge drawn up to
the window, if the~autumn day was warm and
* bright, to the fire if it were otherwise. And
Ardenne wonid sit by her side and read, and
* they would converse. They bad, upon some mat-
ters, imbibed opposite opinions, or prejudice.,
and when their opposing prejudices struck, a
spark of truth, as from the meeting of flint and
steel, would be elicited that would sometimes
throw a ray of light into both souls never more
to be extinguished. Bot~t said tbat in this mu-
tual and frank confiding of all-even the most
hidden and outrs~ thoughts, feelings, and expe-
riences-they learned more than from all the
books they had read. Thus it ever is between
earnest and loving souls who do not fear to con-
fide to each other their most secret thoughts,
opinions, and speculations.
Their home lay in the midst of a glorious
scene, more glorious now iii this resplendent
autumn weather. Notwithstanding all their
privations-beauty and glory-ex'panded thought
-high aspirations must be their portion here.
It was on the day, the Sabbath day, after their
return to their mountain home, that Winny ex-
hausted, not indeed by work this time, but by the
fatigue of her long ride of the evening previous,
lay on her lounge-the little lounge made by
Edgar, stuffed by Hettie, and covered with light
blue calico by Winny. It was now drawn up to
the open window, and Winny lay there half re-
clining upon a pile of pillows, her long fair
curls flowing over them-a coarse plaid shawl
thrown over her, half concealing the plain whit.
wrapper she wore. Ardenne was reading by
her side, but his eyes continually wandered from
his book to her sweet wan face, with its pure
white forehead and hollow temples, its serenely
arched eyebrows and drooping eyelids-
"O'er which the violet vein
Wandering leaves a tender stain."
The sweet, wan spiritual face, with its trans-
parent fairness and azure shadows I and its look
of unconscious but angelic patience I If her eyes
were ever lifted they ever smiled in his.
It was a glorious autumn Sabbath, and a still

SHAN~4 C
and solemn brightness flooded with a golden
light the gorgeous woods and sky, and both re-
ceiving the influence of the time and place-
bathed with a spirit of celestial love and beauty,
notwithstanding all the wrong, remorse, and
woe,--both were happy, for both felt deep as
inspiration could dart its rays a still, calm con-
fidence in omnipotent love and ilnal good! So
reading and communing, loving and worshipping,;
they passed the Heavenly day until the hour of
noon, when they took their simple meal of tea,
bread and butter, and preserves-and then as
Winny waa refreshed they strolled out into the
glowing forest with its rich and gorgeous foliage
of crimson and gold, purple and green, burning in
the rays of the afternoon sun. They returned
from their walk-merely pausing before re~en-
tering the cottage door to worship the Divinity
in the setting sun, sinking like a world in a blaze,
and lighting up the whole earth and sky with the
insufferable glory of a general conflagration!
While standing there they observed two eques-
trians winding up the mountain path, now hid-
den by a turn around some projecting rock, now
lost in a clump of stunted cedars, now emerging
and appearing in the full light-Miss Summer-
fteld attended by a groom! Miss Summerfield
looked well on horseback-she was not a dash-
ing rider like Harrietre Joy, nor a swilt serial
flyer like Winny had been, but her attitude was
erect and easy-her motion slow and majestic.
She wore a very dark grees habit and a beaver
from which a fall of black ostrich feather min-
gled with her raven ringlets. Surprised and
deeply pleased to see her cousin, Winny passed
her arm intq that of Ardenne and went forth to
meet her. Imogene leaned down from her sad-
dle and embraced her cousin, who said, with a
faltering voice and deep feeling,
"Oh, imogene I it is so good in you to come I
I am so glad to see you !"
In proof of which gladness Winny "burst
out a crying." Ardenne bowed, but Imogene
releasing Winny, held out her hand with a friend-
ly look, and tlssn Ardenne shook it cordially,
welcoming her to "Pine Cliffs" He led her
horse to the block and helped her oft, and taking
her arm in his conducted her into the house.
"I had no idea of the length of this ride, my
dear Winny," said Miss Summerfield, as she fol-
lowed her cousin into the adjoining chamber.
"No-it is deceiving-the distance from Red-
Stone to Pine Cliffs is said to be ten miles, but
by the winding of the bridle path in the ascent
it makes it double that distance. You cannot
return to night. I hope you will not mind the
inconvenience of staying with us one night. We
will make you comfortable as circumstances will
admit," said Winny, while asitisting her cousin
off with her habit. Imogene looked at her wan,
blue, fair face, and fragile, evanescent form-and
In reply pressed her affectionately to her bosom.

." It will be agreeable to me, dear child I
only fear the inconvenience to yourself, Wuinyl
do you think I kept aloof from you with apurpo.e
all this time ?"
"Yes, Imogene, I thought so I-but 1 did not
presume to judge your actions, far less to blame
you! I felt that you were right in testifying
your disapproval of my step."
"My dear Winny, it was not that-' the heart
knoweth its own bitterness l'-perhaps I was
pre-occupied with myself."
it was now Winny's turn to read in that high,
regal brow, characters of profound suffering and
stern endurance. It was like a mournful wail of
solemn music without the words. Apparent,
but not comprehensible; speaking to the emo-
tions, but not to the understanding. There was
something, too, that awed investigation, and
Winny's eyes fell. Then-
"How is my dear grandmother 7" she asked,
in a low, tremulous voice.
Imogene replied by telling her as much and
as far as she knew, or was led to believe;
among other things, that Miss Sina Hinton was
very good to her, very kind and attentive, night
and day, though the unfortunate lady, like many
in her sad state, took a prejudice against her
best friend, and disliked Miss Hinton. That
they could never sufficiently repay Miss Hinton
for staying there under all these unpleasant and
adverse circumstances.
Winny sunk down in a chair, dropped her heed
upon the foot of the bed, and gave herself up
to the agony of remorse and sorrows that the
name of her grandmother, and the idea of her
sufferings, always excited.
A glance through the window, showed Mi.
Summerfield that Ardenne was out in the yard,
just going off to show the groom where to put
the horses, and she turned and addressed her-
self to comforting Winny.
"Dear child, you confirm what Harriette
told me. Your remorse is morbid-it is a dis-
ease, and it is killing you! Winny, your very
error drew upon you duties-not of regret, re.
morse, but of a kind that regret and resnorse
are utterly opposed to, and inconsistent with!
Do you think that your immoderate remorse
for your marriage will promote Edgar's happi-
ness 7"
"Oh, no! and I do not regret our marriage!
No! come what will, in this world or the next,
1 shall never regret our marriage! lt is my
disobedience I repent; its consequences to others
I lament I"
"Well, for that disobedience you have just..
ly, though severely, suff~red,-and deeply re-
pented. Yet justice has been tempered with
mercy-some of its consequencess' have been
as profoundly ha~pv as others have been disas-
trous. Your very sufferings have severely test-
ed the love of your husband, and you i~ave

fou.ti it inexhaustible. In that love you have
been profoundly iiappy.---highly blessed 1-that
love at length is right, now-is religious, now
-evil may surround it, but cannot touch it,
cannot mingle with it! Oh 1 I have thought
of tle fall of wan 1-the loss of Eden I-the
goinc forth into the wilderness! And I have
felt that the curse was not so great 1-the loss
so heavy 1-the exile so dreary, after all 1 It
was just the 'curse' that a Merciful God, a
Loving Father, to keep His word, would have
inficted-to save His children,, would have
softened-for they were sent forth together, with.
leave to love! How much more terrible would
have been the curse to either, had either re-
tained PARADIsE-alone !-had they been for-
bidden to love!"
Winny's eyes were fixed with intense inte-
rest upon the solemnly eloquent countenance
of Miss Summerfield, and she almost uncon-
sciousi v exclaimed-
"Imogene 1 you love 1"
"Hush.! hush.' I am betrothed, I ought to
love 1" replied she, hastily and huskily, growing
so very white under the gentle, but penetrating
scrutiny of her cousin, that Winny quickly
withdrew her glance. Recovering herself, Miss
Summerfield said-.-" I wish you to rouse, Win.
ny I-the past is irreparable! Fidelity to pre-
aent duties is possible and pressing Get cheer-
ful and well 1-look at things broadly and in-
telligently- -Heaven is always repairing the er-
rors, and forgiving the sins, and bringing good
from the evil of earth In the course of this
work some have to suffer by the faults, and for
the good of others-it is the beloved of God who
are chosen for this service. God gave His only
Son for the redemption of the world How
trite that text, but how full of meaning-how
broad-how suggestive. It is the best beloved
children of Heaven who suffer here for the
good of the others. If we judge by her divine
spirit of love and goodness, our venerable pa-
rent is one of those beloved ones-she suffers
by, and through, and for others! You, Winny,
needed this very schooling that you are getting
-will you only improve it? My Uncle Dar-
ling,-with all respect be it spoken-I fear,
needs some severe discipline also. He may not
benefit by it. We too often delay all the kind
purposes of Heaven towards us-delay-not de-
feat, for I fully believe in the final triumph of
Heaven, and of good! But Winny, my dear
child, I did not come to preach you an after-
noon sermon, but to make you a proposi-
tion."
C' Well, come in to the parlor fire, it is bla-
zing cheerfully now, and then we can talk,"
replied Winny, leading the way into the next
room, eetti.'g a c~~air for Imogene by the fire,
and seating i~sisslt b~ her side.
CC Where is Edgar?"

"Gone to the spring, to get water to fill the
tea-kettle," replied Winny, a slight blush of
shame (for which she mentally reproached her.
self,) stinging her pale cheek.
"My proposition, Winny 1 My mother and
myself are lonely at Red- Stone, even now, in
this fine weather, when there is so much visit-
ing. But soon the winter will be upon us,
and the river will be frozen over, enclosing us
on three sides, and we shall be very lonely-
soon, also, this bleak cliff of yours will be unin-
habitable, from its exposed situation, and the
severe cold. So I come, in the name of my mo-
ther, as well as myself, to beg that you and
Edgar will shut up your house for the winter,
and come and visit us until spring Do, Win-
ny 1 we should make a snug, happy family there,
all of us together. We should be quite inde-
pendent of our neighbors for soz~iety I"
Winny took her cousin's hinud and pressed it
gratefully; then she said, with much feeling ex-
pressed in her tone,
"I thank you, Imogene-I am profoundly sen-
sible of your kind and affectionate purpose. Oh,
yes, 1 thank you earnestly for your generous pro-
position, and for the delicate manner of ma-
king it."
"And you will accept it, my dear cousin ?"
C~No
"No ?-why not? I cannot think you are
in earnest"
Winny's cheek slightly flushed; she replied,
"We have nothing left but our self-respect-
let us retain that 1"
"Your self-respect, Winny I What do y~
mean? Your self-respect compromised by pay-
ing us a visit? That is very complimentary to
us, my dear Whiny I"
"Imogene, people do not pay visits of only
ten miles distant, six months long 1 1 tnank you,
dear Imogenel If any one could mase indebted-
ness look like independence-and a benefit re-
ceived appear an obligation conferred-it is you
with your refined and delicate tact. I am grate.
ful with my whole heart, Imogene, while forced
to decline your generous proposal I,'
"But, my love, you had best consult Ardenne
before you give me such a decided answer-he
may think differently."
Winny smiled, a soft, bright smile, and then
she answered slowly,
"Y3u may laugh at the triteness and namoy-
parnbyism of what I am about to say, but Edgar
and I have but one mind between us. I have
only to listen to my own instincts to hear his
sentiments. There comes Edgar, now, with
two pails of water in his hands. You might
now go to meet bim, and make the same propo-
sition to him that you have just made to me.-
He would feel your goodness and affection deeply
as X do, and decline your proposition firmly as I
did."

bHANN
Miss Summerfield received this decision with
a look of deep disappointment. She mused in
silence. She was not inclined to yield the point
so easily.
"Then how in the world is one to be of use
to you ?" at last she asked
"By doing everything to ameliorate our grand-
mother's situation."
"We do that, Winny, from another set of
motives"
"By reconciling my father ?"
"We have tried in vain 1,'
"By loving us yourself?"
"1 do, my dear Winny, with all the heart I
have."
Tne entrance of Ardenne, with the pails. ar~
rested the conversation Winuy arose, tilled her
little kettle, hung it over the fire, and began t~ %et
the table for tea. While she en, thui engage'.
Miss Summerfield turned to Ardenne, and said,
"I shall not return to Red-Stone to-night, Mr.
Ardenne. Will you be so good as to send my
servant home immediately, that mother may not
be uneasy at this unexpected absence, and direct
him, Mr. Ardenne, if you please, to return for
me early to-morrow morning I"
Ardenne bowed, and withdrew to do her bidding
In the course of the evening Imogene renewed
and pressed her proposal to Winny in vain. After
tea, while Winny was absent in the adjoining
bed-chamber, changing the bed-linen and prepa-
ring it for Miss Summerfield's occupation, Imo-
gene took the opportunity of speaking to Ar-
deane apart, upon the subject of her cousin's
falling health and great debility, and by every
argument in her power to persuade him to ac
cept their hospitality for the winter. Ardenne
was affected with grief when she alluded to
Winny's declining health, and, for lies, severe
toils; he was moved with gratitude when line-
gene used every delicate and ingenuous persua
sion to induce him to go to Red-Stoue, but, in the
end, with earnest expressions of gratitude and
esteem, he declined the offer, requesting, as his
decision was quite final, that it might not be re-
peated. Imogene's scheme was relinquished very
reluctantly.
Soon after breakfast, the next morning, her
servant rode up, leading her palfrey, and Miss
Suminerfield bade good-bye to the Ardennes and
Pine Cliffs.

trees and houses standing here and there. Clouds
darkened the sky.
It was on the 15th of January. It had snowed
all night. Edgar leaving Winny in her heavy,
morning sleep, descended to the kitchen to open
the window-shutters and light the fire. The
cold was so intense, that in passing from their
bed chamber to the kitchen his hands grew
numb, heavy, and almost useless. He went to
the window to open tbe shuttera-the snow had
penetrated through the old shutters, filling up
~the spac- bet.'-en them and the window, and
I frozen there, excluding every ray of light, and
making the room pitch dark. It was impossible
I to raise the window without shattering the
I glass, and so Edgar went to the door to open it
and admit the light., The snow was drifted and
frozen against the door, too, for he had to pull
with all his strength two or three times, and
then with the last pull it came violently, though
heavily open, and then-it was still dark 1-and
Edgar knew that a snow-drift had closed up the
whole front ot the house. There was a baek
door, but no back window to this kitchen-parlor.
He went and opened the door, and then turning,
saw in front, from sill to ceiling, a shining bar..
ricade of frozen snow. It was still snowing and
freezing as it fell. He closed the doors and
lighted a candle Then he proceeded to kindle
the fire-by its light you might have seen that
our poor boy was frightfully changed-his face
was pallid, peaked, haggard; his eyes and cheeks
were hollow, the expression of his countenance
despairing.--he might have been taken for the
starved apothecary in Romeo and Juliet. He
looked old, and our Edgar was but twenty. So
much for a romantic name and a runaway watch.
1 think if his sponsors in baptism had called him
Job or Barnabas, or any substantial, respectable,
broad-bottomed, upright and downright name,
that he never would have grown up a sonnet
scribbler, and eloped with nis pretty pupil-but
to call him "Edgar!" I could have told them
so.
Reader! if you ever heard of an Edgar, or an
Eriwin, who did not let his genius, or his pas-
sions, or his demon fly away with him, and who
on the contrary, grew up to be a useful, stout,
and well fed member of society, I shall thank
you to let me know it. There is a spell, a
charm, a talisman in a name If .you want to
make a girl a flirt, call her "Fanny," and the
chances will be good; if you want to make her
anything and everything n turn, and nothing
long-a medley of inconsistencies-a cbaoa ~

I warrant you ebe will cook you up a sermon or
a satire, preach orthodoxy with Isaac Taylor, or
skepticism with S oslley; be a nun or a bac-
chants through life, and having no individuality,
no self, ro UNITY, at death she will dissolve into
her original elements of fire and air, earth and
water! But this is a digression.
Mr. Edgar was neither playing flutes nor
writing sonnets. He was just filling the tea-
kettle and sweeping the hearth-alas! just think
of a "radiant archangel" sweeping up the hearth!
In truth, this was the burnt bottom crust of
their cake of romance! Well! this "burn-
ing and shining light," who was going t~ blaze
forth upon the dazzled world with the' splendor
of a newly created sun !-waa just now the mas-
ter of as dirty a pair of hands, as smut, cinders,
smoke, and ashes could make, as he beat the
little broom against the jambs, when the stair
door opened and Winny appeared, blue and half
frozen, though closely wrapped in her coarse
plaid shawl; she smiled an affectionate good-
morning, and set herself immediately to work at
the table Poor Winny had, in spite of all her
promises of reformation, overslept herself so
often, that she was ashamed now of attempting
an apology. She took a little corn meal and be-
gan to mix a cake. The tea-kettle was boiling,
and Edgar asked kier for the coffee.
"There is none, Edgar; the last was used
yesterday morning."
e Tea, then; tea would do."
"There is but one making, Edgar; and per-
haps we had better save that, in case either of
us should be sick."
"It has come at last, then," said he, bitterly,
(C the time when I see you without the common-
est comforts of life, such as every negro enjoys,
and see myself without the means of providing
them for you."
"Well, Edgarj we ar~ not without the neces-
aarses of life-we have meal yet-that is a com-
fort."
"Meal I-and how much? Tell me that,
Winny I"
"Row much? Oh I enough to last us two or
three days."
"And-then, Winny ?"
"And then-I do not know what then-that is
God's concern I-not ours~ for we have done all
we can"
"Look around, Winny I-is there anything
else to sell or barter for meal ?-your carpets
and quilts, your sofa-everything gone except
one straw bed, a kettle, griddle and two bowls-
and now that we have been married fifteen
months we -are reduced to positive penury-
within a week perhaps of beggary or-"
-       "8ta~vation ?-do people ever starve, Edgar?"
(C Yes!"
(C What? among their fellow creatures?"

"Yes-next door to people who are dying of

"I cannot realize rt!~1
"Do you realize that we are half buried in

"Yes-but we have a good fire I"
"Do you realize that we have not a cent and
no means of getting a cent I-that we have no.
thing between us and hunger but a little meal,
and that is nearly gone?
"Weil lit is likely we shalbbe hungry."
"And how long do you think hunger may hint
before it produces death ?"
"I don't know-bow long ?"
"A few days perhaps."
"Well, Edgar, that is the Lord's affair-when
a case is in extremity it is exclu.i~ely in the
Lord's hands. Faith is 's~orih nothing, Edgar,
that does not pierce the mystery of Do ith-if we
are starved out of earth, which I cannot t~ink

gart I have so much faith I should tot wisri you

By this time the little torn cake was done,
and she put it upon tie table. There was no
cloth-it had been sold. There were only two
common plates. ehy sat down to the table,
and Edgar cut the corn bread into our quarters.
1'hey ate but little-there was so much despair

sorrowing for the other. Ardenne had ever
spoken so plainly, so roughly almost a h~ spoke
now, and here was the secret! As soon ni the
little meal was over, and Winny hid cleared the
table-an easy task, and they sat down at the
fire, she said,

In truth, Ardenne was almost bereft of his
reason. They had struggled, and persevered, and
economzed. Had done whatsoever their hands
found to do, and sought work when it could not
be found-had drawn their little expenses down
to the smallest mijilmum-had practiced "indus-
try, economy and temperance," those catholi-
cons for success-unsuccessfully !-in short, had
lived in a way that would have delighted the
heart of "poor Richard"-and still their income
and their little stock of personal property month
by month diminished, until their house was
nearly as bare as a shebelon tree that the locusts
have deserted. Ardenne was in despair.

Winny watched him through the window as
as picked his way down the precipitous and icy
mountain path, until he was lost to her view-
then a cloud slowly gathered ovor her mind-s
weight settled on her heart. She struggled
against this in vain-blamed herself in vain.
"Why, how weak I am-what a baby 1 am get-
ting to be, to feel thus about Kdgar~s absence for
a few hours-nonsense!" but then she sighed
heavily, from a despair she could neither escape
nor understand. She walked restlessly about the
room-a crumpled letter lay upon the floor-she
passed and trod on it several times-at any other
time she would have stooped and picked it up,
for she was an orderly little housekeeper; but
now at last she kicked it out of the way and pur-
sued her walk. Restless, restless still, she wan-
dered from the kitchen into the shed, turned
over all her little stock of cooking utensils, try-
lug to conquer her depression by seeking some
useful employment. They were all right. Then
she went up stairs and over-hauled her own ahd
Edgar's slender wardrobe. They were In per-
fect repair. There was nothing for Winny to do
unless she had possessed money to buy new ma-
terials to work upon; but now, in tumbling over
Edgar's clothes, she missed some of them from
a closet that served them as a wardrobe. Far
from suspecting the truth, she said, "Ah I poor
Edgar, he has secretly taken some of his clothes
to sell or to pledge; secretly, because he did not
wish to hurt my feelings; what a good heart he

with something like a newly kindled love of the
work, Winny set herself to the exercise. Noon
passed, day waned, Winny grew hungry, and
there was nothing to eat; she walked about
again restlessly, once more with her little foot
twitched that soiled and crumpled, haunting let-
ter out of her path. She sat down at last, fatigued
in body, but still restless and active in mind.
"Edgar must be here now in a few minutes-I
will mend th~ fire!" and jumping up again, she
~went to the d6@ a'nd looked out. There was no
sign of Edgar yet. But the hill was abrupt just
at the top; though unseen, he might be very near.
She went into thashed and brought a small arm-
ful of dry wood, such as she could bring. The
fire was very low. She laid down her wood
upon the hearth, and looked around for some-
thing to start it with. Even waste paper was
scarce with her. Her eyes lighted upon the
crumpled letter-she stooped and picked it up,
and opened to examine it previous to burning,
when a sharp rap at the door startled her, and
she dropped the paper! but before she had made
a step forward to open the door, it was pushed
open, and her stout father, in his brown surtout,
furred cap, fox-skin gloves and heavy riding-
whip, stood in the middle of the room stamping
the snow from his boots and over-alls. With an
inarticulate cry of joy, Winny's first impulse
was to spring forward, but something jerked her
back, and she stood fixed upon the spot where
she had dropped the letter; she tried to speak,
but her heart beat too violently; she lost her
strength, and tottered off to the nearest chair
and sank into it, while still the stout squire
stamped and blew, apparently paying more at-
tention to the condition of his over-ahla, than to
his little daughter. With a great effort, with a
sudden 4art, Winny sprang forward and was at
his feet clasping his knees, burying her face
against him and gulping out-
"Father! Oh, may the Lord Almighty blest
you for coming. Father, forgive me I I do love
you ,0 dearly! Oh! I am so glad to see you!
I nearly died of joy to see you-oh! and terror,
toot Father! say you forgive me! I know by
your coming that you have pardoned me, dear
father, but just say so
"Stop, Winny! Let me go, you absurd girl~
don't you see you are hindering1me from stamp-
ing the snow off, and that you are getting it all
over yourself-leave off your nonsense and go
and get ready-well! come! do you Iscatr me ?',
"Sir ?" asked Winny, releasing her father, who
immediately threw himself heavily into a chair
that creaked under him. "Oh, father! dear ~a-

"Yes! ready, ready, READY! is that distinct
enough? and be quick, too, for the sun is nearly

"Ready for what, my father 7"
"For what? why for to return with me to
Oak Grove, where we will see if we can keep a
closer watch on you than we did two years ago,
and see if we cannot try to prevent you from
running away with any more lackeys.~~
Winny's pale cheek flushed at this indignity,
and withal her face assumed a puzzled and a
troubladexpression-she did not move of course.
"C6irne! come! will you hurry? It is a long
ride from here to Oak Grove, and we have no

"To get ready.~~
The words were so hard and curt, the lips so
white that spoke them, that Squire Darling
squinted at his daughter with something ap-
proaching to intelligent scrutiny as she passed
out. Very soon she returned in her riding habit

Het~ie, just as upset and as crazed as her father
was stupified.
"No! she is not dead!', sail a deep, sweet
voice, near the group.
Hettie turned, to see a gentleman in the long
frock and square cap of a Catholic clergyman,
standing near her.
Just then the carriage that Winny had passed
in her mad flight rolled into the yard. The lit.
tie host, at the sound of wheels, and by the force
of habit, started up to go and meet it, but
checked the impulse, and would have raised
Winny in his arms, but that the gentleman who
ha i test spoken, now said-
"Ge meet your new guests, Mr. Smile, 1
will attend this young lady," and raising her
nightly, he looked to Hettie for direction.
"This way, sir," said Hettie, leading the
way into a little chamber.
"Indeed be is the very image of Miss Sum.
snerfield! He looks enough like Miss Summer-
field to be her father," said Hettie, to herself, as
she gazed at the stranger, unconsciously, with
such intensity that he fixed his large shadowy
eyes, with their slowly returning light upon her
an instant, and then gave his attention to the
recovering of the poor one prostrate before him.
In the meantime Mr. Smile had gone into the
yard to receive the new arrival just as the car-
riage stopped. The footman jumped off, opened
the door, let down the steps, and assisted Mrs.
Summerfield to alight. Cap in hand, and bowing
low, my little host rolled forward to meet her.
"Is Mr. Vellemont here, sir ?"
'~ Not as I know of, madam I A strange gen-
tleman-a priest, is here-just this instant ap

The little host always made an ostentatious
show of calling out-" Here, Hettie, my daugh

gave him an excuse to do so-as if he were al-
ways proud of having a "Hettie, my daughter,"
to sing after.
"Where is Mr. Vehement? Let him know
that I am here," said Mrs. Summerfield, when
she reached the parlor.
"Yes, madam! yes I-you mean the gentle-
sian I told you of?"

"Certainly! Mr. Vellemont, the priest, who
has been appointed to assist Father Burleigh,
who is too infirm to perform his duties any
longer."
"Oh, yes, madam! I see f Will you, madam,

"No, Smilie, I return immediately to Red..

"Yes, madam I-there is another person here,
who-"
"Hurry, Smilie, if you please, it is late."
"Yes! yes, ma'am I yes!" smiled the obliging
little host, hastening out to do her bidding.
Winny was at length shocked from her Insets..
sibility by a fierce, rising pang, lsk~l forked and
scattering lightning I-followed by another and
another, in maddening strength and rapidity, U-

Then followed a sense of sudden relief-exhaus..
tion-thenlethargy~deatb.....an~ih~ati0~. From
this trance she awoke at last with a feeling
of benign repose-of inexpressible, exquisite,
ineffable ease. The soft, elastic swells of a
down bed and~pilows embraced her fragile form,
A subdued, an even light fell sweetly on her
eyes. A gently reviving fragrance filled the
room. The soothing murmur of distant waters
was heard And all-the shaded light-the de..
locate fragrance-the murmuring sound-all
came subdued to the senses of her who lay there
half lost in a bathos of ineffable delight. She
awoke to a sense of almost voluptuous-repose-
to a quiet, delicious, animal life-she was like &amp;
new born babe, waking from its first sleep in its
soft cradle-thought, memory, reason, had not
stirred yet. She had not moved yet, though her
sweet blue eyes were halt open, and floating in
the shade of a vague, luxurious vision. This
was beatitude. In this dreamy heaven of soft
support, of shade, of murmur, and of faint fra..
grande, she was now conscious of something
more tangible than either-it was a touch,
a warmth-a gentle, but thrilling clasp upon her
left hand, that lay upon the counterpane. She
felt that this touch had brought her back from
death-that this warmth had given life-this
gentle clasp had galvanized her deadened nerves,
and started her still blood into circulation agaus
-that the little sinews of her small arm were
delicate electric Wires, conducting the life si

love, upon the languid one.
Both, seemed too feeble, in mind and body, oni
from illness, one from age, to feel any strong
emotion at this meeting.
"Grandmother."

eyes, and dream and reality mingled together in
her vague consciousness. Presently she awoke
again-it was dark now~ except where a feeble
yellow ray from the hearth showed where the
night-taper burned. She murmured-" Grand.

"Do you want anything, dear Winny ?"

Long, long had Winny's tears been frozen, now
at this sun of sympathy, eloquence, inspiration,
they melted and ran down her face. Still her at-
tention was not fixed-only arrested-unsettled
aiid wandering in sad reveries and fancies, for
turning her tear-bathed fa.ce to Imogene, she
murmured,
"Are you then that Angel of Sorror 'with
saddened brow and pitying eye?' Are you that
Angel of Sorrow who presided at my marriage
and presided over my maternity-I do not say.
'come.' but depart from me, Angel of Sorrow,
for the shadow of your wing hides from me the
face of God I"
One day in a more rational and practical mood
she asked-
"Imogene-was no effort made to recall him?
I mean-because I was so 111,-so near death,
Imogene, and you were so good I,'
"My dear, yes-we wrote to Wheeling by the
very next mail, and thinking that perhaps he
might not get the letter soon enough did not
wait the next stage, but dispatched a messen-
ger on horse-back to Wheeling for him. How-
ever before our messenger arrived he had left
Wheeling no one knew whither."
"And so you abandoned the chase?"
"Yes, my dcar Winny, but not the purpose.
~dy mother caused notices to be inserted in all
~he papers throughout the country to 'E-r

Lnd he cannot fail to meet one or more of them."
~" Unless he has lost himself in the boundless
lV~stern wilderness, which is the most likely of

There was a coldness and quietness in her
:one and manner that proved Wanny was n~
herself yet.
"He was crazy, Imogene, mad, maddened by
seing say privations and fearing for me-or he
vould not have thrown me into worse affliction

To. turn her thoughts away, Miss Summerfield
aid,
"Your father is much better, Whiny."
No answer.
"I told you several times that in pursuing you
is had been thrown from his horse and severely
njured."
No answer.

"No."

"No."
"You shock me, Winny l"
"You should not have asked me, then. Mj

hands and pressed it until it was numb. Ai
first I screamed with the pain, but now I feel ac
more-it is numb! Indeed it is, Imogene-it i!
strange-but it is numb, stunned, silent !"
While even they spoke old Gelly entered witi
a letter in her hand.
"Mornia' Miss .Winnyhow you 4o to-day
Here's a letter from ole marster. U~icle Killus
is down stairs long o' do carriage as the old gen.

"Be careful, Angela, you talk at random 1 and

"Yes, honey. Well, honey, I hope it's true-

"Did you say Uncle Kill wan down stairs ?"
"Yes', honey."
"Tell him to come up."
"Yes, honey.~~
And the old woman left the room. Winny's
eyes fell again upon the letter in her hands. It
ran thus-

JARED DARLING.
If you had seen the face of Winny as she read
this letter-the strange, cold, sardonic smile tnat
quivered on her lips, you might have guessed
what a frightful change WRONG had wrought in her
angel disposition. Sce opened the sheet and
turning the blank page, asked Imogene to lend
her her pencil--and Misg Sumrnerfield, taking
the gold pencil from her belt, handed it to Winny,
watching with uneasiness the frosty smile upon
the grI's lips as she wrote. Winny finished her
note written with a pencil on the reverse side of
her father's letter, and folding, directed it. She
laid it down on the corner of the dressing-table
ready for Kill. Imogene took it up.
"May I read it, Winny ?"
She nodded an indifferent assent. Imogene's
sentiment of reverence made her shudder as she
read-
"When you have found and restored to me the
life of my life, my husband-when you will ex-
tend to him an equal welcome with mt-self-then
I will come to you and not till then. You need
send no more letters, for I will receive none

"WiNNY ARDENNE."
"Horrible I most horrible! Winny, nothing,

"You will have to reply to Squire Darling,

"Thea I will reply to my uncle's note-" and
going to her room Imogene wrote the fo2ow-
lag-

and still improving, is not in a condition to come

Monday morning, I. SUMMERFIEIJD.
Sealing this letter, Imogene returned to Win..
ny's chamber. She found h-r in conversation
with old Kill, who was almost crying for delight
at again seeing "Miss Winny." He received
the note from Miss Sammerfield, and turning to
Winny said,
"Now, Miss Winny, honey, what must I tell

"The note has everythig, Achilles."
"Yes, honey I yes, yes! I knows that, too. I

"Will you do as I desire Achilles ?" sa d Miss
Summerfi~ld, with that in -incible air of h sughti-

very seldom assumed. Old Kill bowed lowly,
tu ned around hessatungly, and left the ct mber.
"Now, Winny I" said Mirs Summerfiehi, when
she had dismissed the old man, "now, Winny,
recline on this lounge, while I sit here and talk
to you. Do you intend to cultivate that sort of
spirit towards your father ?"
"I do not cultivate it. He drove Edgar, poor
Edgar, who was so young-mad, and to an act of
madness-never in his senses would he have left
me. I feel, as I said-or to speak more truly, I
have ceased to feel-as I told you before. 1 can-
not help it."
"Winny I" said she, passing her hand once or
twice across her brow, as though she was con-
scious of speaking as much of herself as of ano-
ther; "Winny, it is difficult to govern thought;
nearlyy impossible to govern feeling; but ACTION
is, with few exceptions, entirely under our con-
trol. ~iYou cannot, perhaps, at once, conquer and
expelthat impious feeling of resentment-"
"It is not resentment-it is no feeling at

"It is the remit of resentment, however I
Well I then, you cannot force a filial affection that
you do not feel--and it would be wrong to affect
what has no existence; but, Winny, you can
pay your father filial attention and duty; still ; -
you can, as soon as you are able, return to his
house."
"Imogene, if I weary you, I can return to my
mountain cabin."
"We have not, deserved that at your lips,

"'The peace of nonentity,"' replied Imogeno,
as though she, too, were tempted to sigh for it-
"But, dearest Winny you are not changed, only
your environments. The earth is the same at

mother when any proposition to accompany her
to Chapel was made, and Mrs. Summerfield, with
an intense gaze into the eyes that ever f.il be

Imogene labored now for one object; she knew
that Squire Darling was rapidly recovering, she
knew that upon the first day that he could vent
ture to ride so far, he would come over to see
Winny; she wished to prepare Winny to meet
him, if not with affection, at least without be-
traylog aversion.
But a teariul change was coming over Winny.
It vas now the week before the commence-
ment of Lent. It had been the time honored
custom of the Catholics of this neighborhood
to give a succasioil of dinner and tea-parties for
a week or two previous to Lent Tnis wasp I
suppose, a sort of ofl~pring of the south of Eu-
rope Carnival Be that as it may, it was their
custom, and so about ten days before Shrove
Tuesday, Mrs Summerfield sent out invita'ions
for a large dinner party. Among the invite
guests of course were Squire Darling and hi.:
g protege, Miss Hinton, whose continnert.
dence under his roof was sanctioned by the
presence of a respectahie matron engaged to
k~~p house and nurse him during his convales
cence. In her iiote to her brother, M's. Su o-
merfi-id requested that hewould, if ne were
able to bear the motion of the carriage, ride
over some days before the dinner party, and re
main a week or two ~t Red-Stone Hall, that the
~hange of air and the mineral water, together
*th the society of his daughter, might accele-
te hi#. cover. This kind note was answer
ed b rival of Squire Darling in parson,
look ewhat thinner and paler than when
we las saw him in the arrogance of full blood
ed health and strength. Indeed, instead of his
brown surtout coat buttoned up, looking like an
ov~r-rtuffed bag of woni, it hung rather genteel-
ly upon him, so that Harry Joy, whom he, had
met on the road, and who in her genial bon-
homie, had quite forgiven rudeness and all
his sundry other sins-told him he should text
order a dandy coat from his tailor. Well!
Squire Darling alighted carefully and cautiously
from his carriage, and leaning on his stick and
assisted by his body-servant, went up the stairs
at Red-Stone I-mu, where he was liludly received
by Mrs. Summerfield; his long and dangerous
illness having quite softened the sister's heart
toW ~tls him.

leaving the father and daughter alone
It was a smaf I, luxurious, but sombre chamber,
A soft (ark carpet on the fior; the walls hung
with a dark blue velvet paper. A tent bed.
stead stood at one end, a large bay window at
the other, a fire-place and grate, with two large
easy chairs occupied the third bide, and a dark
mahogany bureau and dressing-glass the fourth;
the bedstead and window were hung with dark
blue damask, and the chairs covered with the
same rich but sombre drapery. Over the fire-
place hung a fine large oil painting of the Ma-
donna Doloroso, by Correggio. When the door
closed on Squire Darling, leaving him in this
still, shadowy blue room, at first the sudden
change from noonday without to twilight with-
in, nearly blinded him, and it was some seconds
before he could make out a slight fragile form,
clad in white and faintly gleaming among the
dark blue pillows of a large easy chair, drawn
up near the fire. He approached the chair and
looked again before he could, before he dared to
recognize that blue-white shade as his daugh-
ter, then he burst into tears. and without a word
dropped his stick, sunk down upon the carpet
and dropping his head upon the arm of her chair,
wept bitterly. "When pride thaws look for
floods" And yet h'- saw only the physical ruin,
he did not guess, perhaps he never could have
understood, the moral paralysis. And there she
sat, motionless, cold, imps-able. indeed like a
spirit or th picture of a spirit; that tempest of
tears making no more impression than if indeed
she had been a shape of mist At last:
"Winny! Winny! Wirings! Oh, my mother-
less child! my dying child! speak to me-eo4~t
don't you speak to me, Winny ?"
"Father."
He took the pocket-handkerchief from him
pocket and wiped the tears and perspiration that
streamed from his face-drew a convulsive,
shuddering sigh, and tottered up on his feet-
"Winny! Winny I my dear child; say some-
thing to me, or I shall believe you dead already!
Winny! speak to me, Winny I"
~C Father, will you take that other chair ?"
"And is that all? My God! how cold and
quiet you are! and this is the first time we have
met since we both were so near death!" bit-
terly said the father, as be sank heavily into
his chair. She replied nothing, looked nothing.
Be was not in the habit of controlling any emo-
tion; he did not try to regain his composure--
but the perfect quietude of her manner acted
upon his nerves, reducing them to something like
calmness. They both sat some time in perfect
silence-he gazing at her in a sort o~ still ex-
citement; his gaze disturbing her as little as it
would have disturbed the Madonna Doloroso
above the mantle-piece. At last he broke out
again,

' My G d, Winny! what is t"is? this is worse
than death. The dying have more words for
their friends, man you have for your father!
Winny! are you armrry, and unforgiving ?"
This question, the nature of which would have
shocked ncr reverence some months ago, did not,
however, affect her now. When it was repeated,
she replied,
"No, father"
"What is it then, my shadow? Oh, my poor
shadow, what is it?"
"Nothing."
"'Nothing!' heavens! how impenetrable you
are! Winmy! where is your little baby? that
will arouse you, if anything will. Winny! 1
say! where is your child ?"
"In the crib, in the corner, father!"
"Ah, it is so dark in this gloomy room, I can-
siot see. Which corner? Oh, yes ~
"Wail you band it to me, father? I have not
left my chair for many days, except to go to
bed."
"So! and they leave you here elope?"
"They are all kindness. 1 prefer it See,
here at my right hand, hangs a bell-rope; when
I want anything, I have only to ring it."
He now got up, and going to the corner, lifted
the child from the crib and brought it to his
daughter. He laid it on her lap. "Why, Win-
nyit is all quietness, like yourself! Why Win-
ny-what makes you so cold-so unlike your-
self. Coma! let me see you nurse your baby I"
"I do not nurse her!"
"Not! not nurse her?"
"No. I have no milk for her-never had
after the first few days !"'
"Oh II see! I see," said the father, with his
voice full of pity. "Yes, I see! poor little mo-
ther, and poor little babe! But it is a great
comfort to you, Winny I"
No reply.
"Say, is it not, my dear child? you love it
very much, it is all the world to you, as you are
to me, Winny. Say, isn't it so? say, Winny ?"
"'No,' again! My God! what! 'No'-did
you bear what I asked? I asked you, if you did
not love your child ?"
CE
"'No!' Good Heavens! 'no!' Is the girl
idiotic, then ?"
(C No, only numb."
"'Numb I" and what may that mean; Heaven I
be good to us ?"
"Listen, father. I tell you what is true. It
seems to me as if I had been dead and brought
to life, with the loss of half my life-half roy-
self. Listen, father; some intellects are annihi-
lated by sorrow. It seems to me, that my affec-
tions have been paralyzed by grief. It is true
Before this babe seas born, I loved it. I feared
so much lest it should die; or Ishould die and

On! she is crazy! she is crazy! she is

"Father, i am not the lease insane-my mind

annihilation of my affections."
"On! she's crazy! she's crazy! ihe's crazy!

"Why, father, when you used to smile upon

the sunshine on our earth is a conscious loving

and that it will be clothed with a new incorrup-

I used to believe this because the priest said it

" Oh&amp;?~snj-child! my child !"

"Oh-h-b-h!"

feel. I can only thick-but I know that when I
get a new, whole heart, I shall be glad of it in
heaven, and I say this as a blind child would
say, I shall see when I get new eyes in heaven."
Again Squire Darling groaned bitterly, then as
his child did not speak again, he seized her hand
-iopins-ves hoping to find fever there to ac-
count for this fearful wandering of the, mind, but
no, her pulee was even and rather slow. lie
picked up his stick, and fait as his remaining
lameness would allow, he hurried from the cham-
ber in search of Mrs. Summerfield. In the mean-
time Mrs Sumrnerfield was engaged in conver-
sation with her daughter.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
NIGHT IN DAY.
The mmd that broods o'er guilty woes
Is like the scorpion girt by fire,
In circle narrowing as it glows,
The flames around iheir c~.pmive close.
Till inly scorched by thousand throes,
And maddened in her ire,
One sad and sole relief she knows,
The sting she nourished for her foes,
Whose venom never yet was vain,
Gives but one pang and curt-s all pain
And darts into her desperate brain.
So do the dark in soul expire,
Or live like scorpion girl by fir&amp;;
So writhes the soul remor~e hath riven-
Unfit for earib-undoomed for heaven--
Darkness above-despair beneath--
Around it flame-beneath it death.
Byron.
Immediately upon leaving Squire Darling at
the door of his daughter's chamber, Mrs. Sum-
merfield had passed down the long, dividing hail,
with the intention of seeking a private interview
with Imogene. In truth, Mrs. Summerfield had
parental griefs of her own, and not, as in Squire
Darling's instance, of her own creation. What
hand had she, in fact, in producing the great sor-
row that was day by day visibly consuming the
health and flesh and beauty-the very life of
Imogene? she who was "innocent of the know-
ledge" of its cause. Her heart was even more
than usually oppressed upon this day. It could
not have been otherwise. Since the prepara-
tions for this large dinner party commenced,
Miss Summerfield had fallen into deeper gloom-
health, flesh and life had wasted with greater
end fearful rapidity. She had forsaken even
Wiarty. She died hourly. Mrs. Summerfield
opened the door of her daughter's chamber and
entered. She paused a few steps from the cen-
tre of the room, arrested by a still picture-still
but full of tumult, like a painting of a battle, ox
of a tempest.
Imogene's chamber was beautiful and luxuri-
ous-it was all that great wealth, an artist's
taste, and a mother's love could make it. It
was the largest front room. T wo lofty windows
from ceiling to floor, opening upon a balcony,
commanded a view of the Snenandoafi and the
mountains beyond. But these windows were
now shaded by curtains of purple satin damask,
lined with orange colored silk. The space be-
tween the windows was filled up with a large
Raphael, a Virgin and Child surmounting a smell
but elegant altar.
Before tbis altar knelt Imogene, her hands
clasped, her face upraised, her lips struck apart,
her brow corrugated, her eyes srrained~nay, her
very ringlets bristling as it Were with anguish.
Yes! there was grief, remorse, terror, despair,

Mm. Surnmerfield could not sleep that night.
"I wonder if she sleeps? alas, no! she lies
and tosses as I do! How many nights, my
heaven! has that poor girl waked and suffered!
night after night, and week after week, yes! and
month succeeding month, until health and flesh
and beauty have wasted away! and my child is
haggard at nineteca! I will go and see if she
sleeps I" and so saying, Mrs. Summerfield arose,
slipped on a dressing gown, took the shaded night
taper and crossing the passage, entered imo-
gene's chamber. It was very quiet. She list"
ened. There wait no sound, no motion, no sigh;
nothing to suggest that the occupant of the
chamber waked. Mrs. Summorfield approached
the bed-gradually ani cautiously advanced the
light-started! almost exclaimed with surprise
at what she saw! she approached the taper
again and looked more intently. Was that imo-
gene? That the girl "steeped to the lips in
gtil" and haggard with remorse? That! Mrs.
Snmnmerfild turned the cylinder of the taper,
ralilag a strong light, and flashing it upon the
sleeper. Was that Imogene, the girl so lately
can~umod with guilt and remorse? What, that
radiant sleeper flooded with the glory of some
celestial vision? Yes! that was truly Imogene,
transfigured and glorified in sleep! how beauti-
ful she looked! and how happy! even to ecstacy.
The cover was thrown off her boaom-~the beau-
tiful bosom only slightly veiled by ~he long
binek ringlets that glided and twined caressingly

93

about it-her arms, the long, loose sleeves faUleg
below the elbows, were thrown up over her
head, carrying half her ringlets with them. The
face was glorious with a beaming j y; the eye-
brows raised, arched and open; the lips full and
slightly apart with a dreamy smile; the cheeks
faintly colored; the whole complexion of face,
arms and bosom, roseate; the muscles all full,
elastic, slightly inflated, as by rising joy or life;
a very gentle per~piration and regular breathing
assured the mother that this was really health-
ful sleep and happy dreaming. Inspired with
hope, the mother dropped upon her knees and
thanked God, saying,
"This girl may be an erring maniac, but she
is not guilty! Thank Gad! The guilty never
sleep, never dream like that! If it were so,
then indeed would the wandering fancies of poox
Winny have struck upon some truth I"
She knelt, and watched her long-receiving
from the radiant sleeping face a balm for all the
wounds the haggard face had given her. Oh!
long she knelt by the side of the beautiful
sleeper, loath to leave her-loath, for fear that
the lost vision would never return to bless her
sight, and soothe her fears again. At last sh~
left the chamber and returned to bed, to lie
there and wonder at the strange occurrence.
S~e thought of all that she had read of trances,
ecstacies, on which, when the body seemed to
sleep, the soul was absent-but all she remem-
bered of such cases, only convinced her that this
sleep of Imogene's was neither trance nor ec-
stacy-the soul was not absent from that glori-
fied body! no !-it was very present-present in
its most exalted lif~e-makmng radiant the coun-
tenance of the beautiful sleeper-no-this was a
healthful sleep, and a heavenly dream-but
what, then, was the remorse, that consuming
Imogene all day long, was lifted frhm her soul
at night?
The lady was an early riser-she was up
with the sun. She saw nothing of Imogene un-
til they were all assembled at breakfast, when
her daughter catered-pale, still, cold, impassi-
ble as usual, and took her seat at the table, as
unlike the radiant and celestial dreamer of the
night before as she was to the tortured, half-
frenzied sufferer of the day before
"Have you seen Winny this morning, Miss
Summerfield ?" inquired her uncle.
"Yes, sir,-I have just left her room. She
has not yet risen-"
"How is she then, my dear ?"
"As usual."
"And who is with her?"
"Our grandmother. She has the adjoining
room to Winny. She stays with her always."
"She was not there when I went in yester~
day, and, by-the-way, I have not seen her mo-
ther-how is she?"

The day of the dinner party came. The hand-

and thrown open, and according to the cere.
monious custom of the day and neighborhood,
Mt-s and Miss Summ'~rfield, supported by Squire
Darling, stood near the de~or to receive their:

nests They were rather a handsome trio.
Squire Darliig "neatly, trimly dresed-fresb
as a bridegroom," in his suit of specklese black,
which well became his fair complexion and fair
blue eyes, cleared by recent illness, and his soft
light hair. Squire Darling betrayed a conscious-
ness of looking exceedingly well. Mrs. Sum.
merfield was a lady of rare ma roniy beaty, as I
have before hinted-her tall and fiusdy rounded
form was arrayed in a full dinner co~turne ot rich
black velvet and a small slight gossarrser cap set
off without concealing the heavy bands of glossy
black hair parted above her noble brow. Miss
Summerfl0ld wore a crimson satin with full and
open sleeves and open corsage, with chetnisette
and under sleeves of tine lace in full and deep
falls. Her long black ringlets flowing down as
usual in their divisions were without any orna-
ment beyond a single string of pearls around her
classic head. Imogene seemed paler, thinner
than ever. Nay by the contrast of her glowing
dress and long black curls her face looked hag.

field ?-and of all wonders ~vlere is Colonel Dan-

visitors would immediately combine these two
circumstances.
Nearly all the expected visitors had arrived,
and Miss Summerfield nearly sinking with fa-
tigue had just requested permission to leave her
post when the name of "Mr. Vellemonte" was
announced, and Squire Darling felt the form re-
clining upon his arm start and quiver as If
pierced by an arrow! and whispering hastily,
"You are fatigued, Miss Summertield, and I
must lead you to a seat" would have done so but
that the gentleman announced immediately af-
terwards entered the room and stood before
them. Squire Darling bowed very lowly and
gravely, and Mrs. Summerfield with more titan
usual sauvity greeted her new visitor and took
him off to a seat.
"That is the new priest!"
"That is Mr. Veliemonte, the new pastor of
Sacred Heart."
"Row remarkably handsome! how singularly
graceful I"
"How strangely like Miss Summerfield! Did
you ever see such a likeness I" were the sup-

remarkable beauty, health was the great and
striking peculiarity of his being. He was the
ideal of physical, mental and moral HRALTH.
The impersonation of a vigorous LIFE. Lir~
was in every limb and feature-in every expres-
sion, gesture and motion. Strange! but when
you saw him you became conscious that every
one else in comparison was more or less out ol
health. He was tall and rather full.formed-his
countenance was very fine-his forehead was
high and broad-his face rather long, but his
cheeks and chin so full and round as to give the
whole face a beautiful oval cast-his complexion
was clear and sanguine-his hair a warm auburn,
and his eyes clear blue-his mouth perfectly
beautiful in form and expression-yet with all
this difference of form and complexion he was
startlingly like dark and haggard Imogene. It
~ was impossible to analyze this startling resem-
blance, for when closely examined it was so in-
tangible that it would disappear, and you would
say it was a hallucination-there was none at all
-until he would look at you or speak, and then
the resemblance-say almost the identity would
half terrify you. There sat the subject of this
description cheerfully conversing with thelady on
his right hand. From the time of his entrance
a new spirit seemed infused into the hitherto for-
mal and silent company. Conversation received
an impulse, and pleasant talk and merry jest
and happy smile went around-and around like
a pleasant agitation-affecting all but Miss Sum-
merfield, who, in a remote corner, sat alone and
woody. Soon Vellemonte arose and mingled
with the crowd, diffusing life and gaiety as he
passed.
"Dear me! I think he is very lively for a mi-
nister of the gospel I" said a sour visaged lady
in a hissing whisper, unconscious of being heard
by the subject of her remark. Vellemonte turned
quickly around and dropped his eyes, raining
light and blessing and joy upon her, and then
passed on. The lady's brow cleared as by magic,
and warmed and exalted she, too, passed on her
way rejoicing in light.
Through the crowd he was seeking Harriette.
He found her-and the merry maiden sprang
joyously to meet him.
"I want you to take me to Mrs. Ardenne's
chamber," said he.
And Harriet, with a "Certainly! please come
this way I" led him out. She took him straight
up to Winny's apartment. "Now do you wish
me to go in ?"
CC Yes," said he, with his hand on Harriette's
short curls. "Yes, I wish you to come in."
And they entered.
Winny was in the same arm-chair-in the
s~e still attitude. The old lady sat in the one
~ite, smiling to the babe that lay in the crib
b.M~ her. A brighter smile bloke like a burst
of uI~bine over the old lady's face. as the young

priest entered. Even Winny's cold face lighted
up. He took the hands of each-and then sat
down between them.                      5
When he left them a half hour after, the face of
the old lady was lighted with intelligence-and
that of Winny, with emotion-at last. When
he reached the drawing-room the people were all
going in to dinner. He took the arm of Miss
Summerfield, and drawing g it within his own con-
ducted her to the table; and during the passage,
while her arm reposed on his, her excited nerves
grew calm, her heart quiet, her mind clear, as by
a miracle. He sat by her side during dinner-.-
watched her attentively, and waited on her
zealously. When dinner was over, he again drew
her arm within his own and took her back to the
saloon to a distant fauteuil, and sat down beside
her-his clear eyes turned with interest upon
her haggard face, seeking to read there the seci~et
of her misery. The other guests who had fol-
lowed them into the saloon, dispersed themselves
in gay parties over the room. None approached
their fauteuil. He was still perusing her coun-
tenance. Her eyes were dropped-yet here was
no disturbance, no paleness, no trembling, no
shrinking from that clear and searching gaze.
All was calmness. At last he spoke, and his
round full liquid notes were melody.
"Imogene, we meet at last-meet for the se-
cond time for three years; and I find you, oh
so frightfully altered! Imogene, I knew nothing
of this. I knew you had never entered the chapel
since my arrival, but I conjectured that devotion
to your cousin prevented you. I did not guess that
you had been ill! Have you been ill, Imogene?"
"In body? no," replied Miss Summerfield,
without lifting her eyelashes.
"Then you have mentally -suffered, Imogene I
it is even as I feared. Tell me the cause of your
trouble, Imogene. Ha I do you shudder so! and
grow pallid, and drop your face upon your hands!
Nay, nay-look up, imogene, raise your eyes to
mine I I would soothe, not agitate you; look at
me, Imogene ?"
Was there mesmerism or magic in those soft
full tones-full of compassion as command? Miss
Summerfield, with the involuntary docility of a
child, slowly raised her eyes, and slowly let them
meet his own-his clear deep eyes, whence light
and life, blessing and joy, streamed into hers;
filling her heart with peace-raising her soul to
a new sense of life. It was as though that glance
had rent apart the curdling blood that now flowed
healthfully through all her veins-flushing her
cheeks, lighting her eyes, and elevating her
spirits.
He was a shade paler, a degree sadder, as he
said, -
"I will not ask you for your secret again,
Imogene. Souse day you seill tell s7 sue. But I
will ask you to come to church. Promise tue
that."

"Yes, I promise it-the more readily that I
have passed my word to my mother to do so."
"That is well Imoge~e, look in my eyes and
reid my soul deeply as your glance can pierce-
and for anything that lies deeper than that, ask
me and I will tell you."
"Why do you say this to me ?"
"Because I read in your countenance, among
other things, a wonder, an interest, and a cu-
riosity."
"Nothing more
"Yes! something more! Bhall Itell you what

"No !" exclaimed Imogene, shuddering vio-
lently, struck with a sudden convulsion.
The hand of the priest fell slowly and lightly
on hers, and her agitation subsided. "Now,
Imogene, you might, if you so pleased, tell me
the darkest secret of your heart, and it would
grow bright in the communication; or, you
may ask me for mine-you may sift me tho-
roughly."
C~ Tell me, then," said Miss Summerfield,
CC the secret of your power."
"My power? Imogene, the evening is plea-
sant, though cool; will you come on the lawn ?"
And without waiting her reply, he cheerfully
arose, took her hand and drew her through the
glass doors, and down the marble steps to the
lawn. "Now, my power-which power, Imo-

C' Listen, then! Three years ago, before SI had
ever seen you, I was attacked with typhus fever.
I was in extremity, and a priest was summoned
to annoint my hands and feet for burial. You
came. I was speechless, sinking-you gave me
extreme unction-your touch struck all the
electric cords of life; you prayed by me-and
your voice called back the departing spirit-I
lived! I knew my life giver! Explain that."
"Imogene! I earnestly desired your recovery.
I prayed for it-believed in it; and sought with
my strong electric life to galvanize yours into s
new vigor; that is all."
'~ Again! we met around the death..bed of an
old, a very old lady. We believed her dying of

"There is something more in this than you
have explained. At least there is more than I
apprehend. Listen yet! This day, before you
came, our company was formal, silent, stiff You

"Not yet! By what power do you draw me

"By WILL, Imogene !"
"Yes! yes! but how does that will act upon

eyes with their dazzling rays of light, full upon
hers and said-" shall I tell thee, Imogene ?"
"No," exclaimed Miss Summerfield, with
sudden energy.
And again that hand sank slowly, lightly,
softly upon hers-and again the delirium of her
nerves subsided, and she grew serene and be-
came cheerful. Rising, he left her side now and
went through the room, like a sun-ray spreading
light and cheerfulness. Many of the visitors

manners. Only one dark form withdrew before

"We war not with flesh ani blood (only,) but j gentle kise of the soft lips was the only answer,

Mrs. Summerfield was suddenly startled from daughter were seated on the downy settee with
her deep sleep, by something-a dr'~atri-a shock their backs to the window. Otis of the mother's

trol of the lady subdued the agitation of her commenced in a low, monotonous tone, like one

nerves, and she arose and struck a light. Her
first thought was her daughter. With an un-
accountable presentiment and a vague terror, she
passed into Miss Summerfield's room. She went
up to her bed-started! suppressed a shriek at
the appalling sight that met her eyes. Deathly
pale, frightfully distorted, violently convulsed,
yet sleeping still-wa. that form. Oh, the
agony! oh, the anguish written on that written
brow of the sleeper I Down and out went the
candle, with her delirium of alarm.
"Imogene! Imogene! awake! awake!" she
exclaimed, raising the girl in her arms. Miss
Summerfield slowly opened her eyes-slowly,
~re slowly than ever before, Earns back the
light of her soul to them. "Imogene! my child,
my child-what is all this ?"
Miss Summerfield was now calmly looking on
her mother's face. She arose, and giving her
hand to that mother, said-" And are yotw
nights, as well as your days, disturbed by care~
for me, my dear mother? Come, I will tell thee
my ~atk secret-thou shalt guide me. Come,
mother! let us go into your chamber-here it
ispnrgatory-.your room is a psiosful and holy
heaven."

indeed talking in sleep and fearful of waking.
C' It is three years-nearly four, mother; since
I went from home to school, is it not? Well,
mother; I was joyous then, was I not? Life
seemed--yes, life was, very brilliant, very daz-
zling to me! I was filled with enthusiasm and
joy! Perhaps the highest joy I felt then, mo.
ther, was in the ardent admiration of my-.-oi
my-of Colonel Dangerfield, Wherever I might
be, I seemed alike to walk in the light ef a glori.
ous vision; and the most glorious feature, the
god of that vision wa~ Colonel Dangerfield.
Yes, mother, whether when I was packed intr
a close stage.coach on my journey to school, oi
in the crowded first-class room, or in the recrea
tion grounds, or the chapel, or the dormitory-
wherever my body, or even my intellect might
be, my spirit was roaming through palace, halls,
grounds, with Dangerfie)d. The ring he p!aee'i
upon my finger at parting, the miniature that
he hux(g upon my bosom seemed to me holy as
the holiest saint's relict. They were my t.jis..
mans; I would clasp them in prayer; 1 *~lk.4

tor, she hoped that this might continue. More
than ever of late, she had been possessed of the
idea that her daughter's melancholy arose rather
from a distempered mind, than from any exter-
nal and tangible cause. She had been crowing
to believe Imogine the subject and victim of a
monomania. This she now hoped would yield to
the spiritual influences of religion. And as 'the
evening wore away, and she saw Imogene emerg-
ing more and more from her moody abstraction,
beaming into bright and brighter life; once more

the Alpha and Omega.- '-the beginning and the
end. Yea, this was the '~enrre around which my
whole life revolved. Did [read bistor~r? I saw
nothing there so prominent as the noble Roman
matrons, the noble wives of history, and said iii
my profoundest heart. even such a wife will I
be to my noble American I Did I weary in any
task? I looked upon my ring, upon his miniature,
and said, for thy sake, for thy heroic sake, I will
conquer repugnance, I will caster this ta~k; and
then my heart would fire WiLh enthusiasm, and
the toil itself would ca4 a reflex pleasure, ex-
quisite as profound 1 lid i.ot mingle with my
school fellows. All deep joy shuns levity as
sorrow does-yes, more nan sorrow does. Sor-
row may seek to disguise or distract itself in
levity, but earnest joy is always serious. So I
walked apart in a golden dream My compa-
nions called me haughty; my teachers charged
me with absence of mind; and they were right.
No nun among my teachers hired such an 'inner
life' as I did. My life was 'hidden' mdccl
with-not with a 'heavenly,' but an earthly
'bridegroom.' Yes I I was indeed 'Glory's
Bride'--in issag~i nation.
"Dangerfield was my enthusiasm, my wdrsaip,
my secret treasure, and I would be glad when
my head was on the pillow, and the real world
was dark and silent, was gone from me, and vista
after vista of the ideal '.orld, each more glorious
than the other, would open before me 'in the
bright pageant of a midnight dream.' The great
cities of the earth, the kingdoms of the world,
and the powers thereof, passed in rapid and daz-
zling succession-a magnificent panorama before
my mind's eye-and first and last, and most
glorious there, lighting up my dream as the sun
lights up day, radiated-IhisGEarIEw. Oh! can
1 make you see how splendid beyond one's bright-
est conceptions of heaven these all-glorious
visions were ?"
"You loved him, Imogene j Oh, Imogene; you
loved him so mitch! You might have been happy
as prosperous! Alas, what followed? I wait
to hear."
A profound sigh, followed by a deep silence,
answered her. At last.
"Do you recollect, mother, that I was scarce-
ly' fifteen years old then, and by no means pre-
cocious 7"
"Yes, yes; I remember-but go on-or rather
I mean-take your time, my dear child."
"Mother, I loved him not. I never loved him,
never could, never can love him I"
"IMOGENE I are you then indeed mad? You
give me the history of the most rapt and passion-
ate devotion, and end by saying that you did
not, could not, can not love the man I"
"Mother, was it thus you loved my father 7"
"No, not with such enthusiasm; he was a
most worthy man, and I loved him truly, sober-

ly, and faithfully; for I was awidowat eighteen,
and never re-married."
A long pause followed this, and then Imogene
resumed the conversat;on
"No, mother, not so; you loved my father;
for you loved, and .[ did not-my passion, for it
was a passion, if one ever fire; a numan soul.--
was of the imagination only-it was the fever,
the enthusiasm, the very ecstacy of HERO -won-
surv !-nor more, nor less."
"Oh, Imogene! there is something behind
yet
~~There is, and yet- Well! you know, mo-
ther; or perhaps you do not know, that the holy
and secluded sisterhood are most voracious
after news of the outside and unholy world! Of
all the dwellers upon earth, they are the most in-
veterate gossips! '17 hey gossip wito the elder
girls, for from them after their return from visits
out, they get the newest newsy and to them
they impart any morsel of interest that they, in
the seclusion of their retreat, may have picked
up from a casual visitor. Thence it fell out that
from the sisters, at last, the elder girls found out
the secret of my betrothal; and then one by one,
and little by little, they sought to edge into my
confidence. One young lady would inform me
that her father had been chairman at the great
dinner given to Colonel Dangerfield at Rifu-
mond; and saying that she believed he was of
my neighborhood, would ask me if I were per-
sonally acquainted with him. Another would
tell me that her eldest sister had been on
the committee of ladies appointed to present Co-
lonel Dangerfield with a sword from the la-
dies of Winchester. I always acknowledged the
acquaintance, but did not encourage farther
questioning; however much the glow that
would kindle on my cheek might betray me.
Sometimes I Would come suddenly into the re-
creation room and find a group of girls discussing
him and me! 'heiress of an immense fortune,'
'yes! already engaged;' 'yes, indeed! I guess
he is! my father says he will be Secretary of
War next term ;~ 'I heard my Uncle Peter say,
that he would run for Governor at the next elec-
tion,' &amp;c., &amp;c. Alas! mother, I suppose you
think I tell you all these petty details to stave off
as long as possible-the truth"
"Nay, courage, my Imogene; 1 have grown
very calm; tell me now calmly what next 1,'
"I will tell you. I too am quiet now. I
dreaded the telling of this story, or the com-
mencement of it, as one dreads the first incision
of the lancet; but now the pierce is past, the
vein Is opened, and the blood flows freely I"
"My child, talk plainly, quietly; do not law
dulge in such ghastly ractaphors."
"I will not. 1 will go on soberly; for now

and I was among its first victims. Our oh
Chaplain and Father Confessor died; a success.

sor had not arrived yet. Mother, more thai
ever in the delirium of fever, was my mind ab

glory as before, but in one every way the re
verse. Visions of fire and smoke-vast sheets
of flame scorched and suffocated me; visions 0:
blood sickened me with disgust and horror; al
one moment I was wrapt in the flames of a burn
ing city, and at another sinking in a sea of gore.
All the horrors of all the wars I ha'; ever read
of in history were re produced and re-enacted
around me. All the fields of carnage-all the
sacked cities and murdered children-all--all the
horror without the glory! And through all wat
that intolerable feeling of burning fire! and that
insufferable, loathsome, suffocating smell of fresh
blood! Oh! it was horrible! horrible! horrible!
and more horrible than all, by a grotesque phan-
tasy, as the presiding Demon of this hellish storm,

the cannon ball on its errand of destruction into

women; little boys and young girls; Innocent
victims! and worse than all, oh! pitying angels,
a babe, the sole survivor of the family-a young
babe lay under a table with both its legs crushed

"Hush! hush! Imogene! those ghastly visions
of your delirium! It was owing to the high fever
-the blood in your bead!"
"Sometimes my visions would escape from the
poignant anguish of individual and detailed saif-
fering, and lose themselves in a dilating horror,
less painful because bewildering. It seemed that
my demon-warrior and bridegroom had built me
a throne of the bleeding bodies."

"Mother, this-gradually, very gradually, the
fire burned low; the fever cooled; the vision of
flame and blood departed, leaving me only the
haunting memory; then my soul fluttered-

ness and reason; still it was not a recovery, or
an atvakening, it was more like a healthful tran-

I me. I opened my eyes and looked up-livin%,
r sane, restored, happy-looked up to meet a, pair
of eyes brooding over mine-eyes so clea~ and
- pure in their beautiful depths, tbat it seemed 1
could look deep down a boundless heaven within.
- Those eyes !-L saw-I felt only those eyes-
I they were another visioii to me-a vision of
- new life-of love-of joy-streams of light pour-
ed from their orbs into mine, illuminating,
f strengthening all my being. They talked to me
so much in that instant of time. They said-
* 'Awake! arise! put on thy strength, for thy
Redeemer cometh' They said...A Even as now
I has passed away that horrid dream of flame and
I blood, so will at last pass away all the crime
and anguish of earth! &amp;nd as now thou aast
awakened cool and happy-so, at death, shalt
thou awake from the fever dream of time to the
life of heaven, and to the eternity ot good.' Then
the eyes set, as the stars go down, or else my
eyes closed on them to open on another a;id a
celestial dream. I heard a silvery rustle of
pleasant voices-and saw a white-winged troop
of angels-.and lighting up the radiant browbf
one were the beautiful, clear eyes of my guar-
dian spirit. Methought they hovered around
a death-bed, waiting trie birth of the angel-and
as they talked, it seemeui to me that thi- deatk
was the second birth spoken of in the ~criprures
-that as the body is born into the mate-
rial world in the first birth, so the soul is
born into the spiritual world at death-the se-
cond birth-that the body must be delivered of
the soul before the soul can inherit the kingdom
of heaven! I realized then how death was the
entrance into a vastly higher life.. ifother I it is
one thing to hear this said over and over again,
until the words have no meaning, and another
thing to realize it as a truth-as the new reve-
lation of a truth I"
Imogene paused, and then resumed-" So I
floated about in the atmosphere of that silvery
dream-bright, radiant, dazzling as a mist of
liquid diamonds-and still the sun of that celes-
tial union was the clear eyed angel-showering
rays of light as he moved. Such were the bliss-
ful visions of my reviving life."

now. The early sounds of awakening life .jegan

verge of her revelation. And her mother silently
pressed her hand.

Ttien, mother, I wrote to you, expressing a wish
to return home-you came and brought me here.
I tried to baneh ever v thought, every memory
or Claude. I prayed, fasted, tried to lose my-
self in study; tried to uproot one image in my
heart, and plent another there! in vain, mo-
ther! I tried to look on Colonel Dangerfield as
I had looked b4ore--to love and venerate him-
to beimev~d owed to him my very being Oii, worse
than vain. See, mother, what remorse has con-
surned my heart, for treachery to my betrothed
huibdaul for my impious, my sacrilegious love
for an anointed priest of God! And when, after
months had passed--months of criminal love and
consuming remorse, and I had nearly withered
to the ruin I am now, we met again, suddenly,
unexpectedly, at the bedside of my grandmother.
When I met his eye-when he touched my hand
-it was like a lightning stroke! The blood
atagiiated in my heart-I reeled-and for a mo-
ment, lost myself." She paused, and then re-
sumed, very gently, in a lower, quieter key, and
in a thin and silvery clear tone-" My mother,
do you think' I have been mad? Yes! since I
left tue convent-since my return home, I have
been mad at times-sometimes frenzied with
such a poignant sense of guilt, that I have
thought in this sacrilegious love, I had commit-
ted the unpardonable sin-the sin against the
Holy Ghost-and then, indeed, I was often near
betraying myself by breaking out into actual
raving madness! Oh, often when you and others
thought me so cold, so quiet, my superficial
composure covered ~n internal storm, that threat-
ened each instant to break out in open iladness;
therefore, mother, when you touched the subject
of my secret anguish-therefore I had to escape,
for my more than life, my sanity! for I was in
momentary dread and danger of losing the slight
but perfect self-control I exhibited. There was
but a ptper wall between me and raving madness!
And I knew if this was once burst through, all
was over with me! I knew if I should lose my
self.command I 'should also forfeit my self-re-
spect, and the respect of others! And with all
my guilt and remorse, I was haughty still!
Mother, 1 dreaded to meet him more than 'death
and perdition! 1 absented myself from church,
and when he came to the house, I kept out of
sight. I did not expect him here at the dinner
party; he came, and therefore I was taken by
surprise! But, mother, now the mystery again,
for after the first shock of my nerves had passed,
his glance, voice and touch had a magnetic pow-
er of tranquilizing and strengthening me-he

103

affected me now as he had in the first hours of
my recovery from death-sickness. Mother, 1
know not the spiritual mystery of what I next
experienced, but it was this-I read God's mer-
cy in his eyes-heard God's blessing in his
voice-felt God's love in his touch- You saw
how cheerful I was, mother. I retired to rest,
arA then came a re-action, a demon-dream, from
which you awoke me. Verily, 'we war not
with flesh and blood, but with powers and prin-
cipalities of darkness.' But, mother, that whole-
some influence of yesterday evening has given
me strength at last to confide in you, and I feel
better for it-speak to me, dear mother."
Mrs. Summerfield sat silent for a long time
-with her hanos clasped together upon her
knees-with her eyes strained upon her handa,
and a look of unutterable anguish on her brow.
She was appalled by what she, like Imogene,
looked upon as a sin of the deepest die, for which
earth scarcely contained a parallel or heaven a
pardon.
"Speak to me, dearest mother! Tell me now
what I am to do and I will do it."
"Oh! lost, lost girl! You say that you were
not mad until after your return home! Alas!
you have been mad from first to last! possessed

"Oh, imogene, would that I could suffer for

"ONE has done that for me, mother! calm
yourself, mother-tell me, what shall I do?"
"Oh, Imogene, the tender arms of the holy
mother church are ever stretched out in mercy,

Sina Hinton had outwitted herself if ever an
intriguante did; she had done too much and too
well; she was cursed with too much success.
Wishing to banish the daughter completely from
her father's heart and home, she had exiled Ar-
deiine, broken the heart of Winny, and so opened
the bosom of Squire Darling for the reception of
his suffering child: that was failure the first.
Then having wished to supplant that banished
chili in the home, heart, and fortune of her fa-
ther, sne had played her part so well, that instead
of adoping her as his daughter, the fat and rosy
old squre must needs fall desperately in love
with her and woo her as his wife 1--lastly having
essayed through the morbid conscience and guilty
fears of the priest to obtain a perfect command of
him, and through him of his most powerful pa-
rishioiiors, she had overdone the thing so com-
pletely as to terrify the poor old man into dota~e
and imbecility-thereby rendering him unfit for]
her use.

broken now, was always punctual in his atten-
dance on divine service. His pew was quite on
the opposite side of the building to that of the
Summerfield family, but it was side by side with
Squire Darling's pew, of which, since the mar-
riage of Winny, the infirmity of the old lady,
and the illness of the squire himself, Miss Hin-
ton was the sole occupant. Now as Colonel
Dangerfield would sit in that pew so cold and
stern, he would some times catcfs a pair of large,
dark, tender eyes fixed in mournful sympathy
upon him, which would drop their long lashes
upon a crimsoning cheek quick as detected.
Such beautiful eyes! they were veiled from his
sight only to haunt his merry. Hush I-he
would not whisper to his own heart-lie would
not listen if his heart whispered it to him-that
there was anything but accident in what made
that corner of the pew where he could lean at
ease and see, without looking at, those shadowy
eyes-so comfortahie. Nonsense! there was no-
thing in it! that corner fitted his back, and the

when the Summerfield pew on the other side
of the church happened to be empty, Miss

And Miss Hintois edging cautiously around the
room, reached the back of the big chair, and
dropping her hands upon his shoulders, while he
could not see her witching countenance, cooed
as follows:

upon the sack of the chair; "but do not talk to

"D- my sister !'~ growled the squire.

"Oh, you did! you did!" maid Sine, clasping
her hands with a touching air of gratitude.

"But, Sina, you pretty little kitten! you
wouldn't leave me alone-not you! You'd

such an innocent, kittenish, bewitching way,.

getting Virginian chivalry, honor, gallantry,
hospitality, he suddenly caught. the girl to his
bosom nearly crusriing all ner little bones in
his bear like hug, and naif suffocating her with
kisses-exclaiming between them-
"Aye, scratch and claw, my little bramble

Hey! my little sal-ammonia! but you are sharp!
you are piquant! you are exhilarating I Ha! I

"I'll! I'll hill you!" exclaimed the enraged
and half suffocated girl.
"Kill away, my tigress! kill away, my sprite.
Oh! it is so good to be scratched and bitten by
you! It must be heaven of heavens to be killed
by you!"
Sina suddenly ceased to struggle, burst into
tears, and dropping her head on his shoulder,
sobbed violently. And he ceased to Worry her,
and stooping over her stroked the dishevelled hair
from her brow and said, soothingly,

All this time Sina was lying in his arms, her

the wily girl, "for I have been violent too-but

how easily these mysteries are unravelled when
one has the key to them. Think now of Colonel

he is still passionately attached to her !"
"Dis-! what/tim"'
"Yes! but this is almost a breach of confi-
dence, which neither the Colonel nor the Sum-
meflelds might like. I tell you this to tranquil-
lize you, that is my only excuse: Pra3f do not
mention it to any of the family unless they first
name it to you !"
"Dis-! Well! Now, Sina, say! Oh, Sina,

"My dear protector, please give me two days
to think of it; will you ?"
"Well, well! if I must, I must, without any
sort of doubt. Here they are with tea."

I'? DALE.
And at that moment Nerve and Kill entered
with two waiters, to arrange the table As soon
as tea was over, Miss Hinton excused herself,
and retired; while Squire Darling communed
with himself to the following effect. "What
Sina says, may be all very true; and in the main
I believe it is; but then again, I do not like the
fellow poking about here so often; and if Into
gene has really discarded him-what ever could
possess the girl to do it? why next thing he'll
be for consoling himself with some other wo-
man. And what woman so likely as Sjna?
Finally! confound him! lowe the man nothing!

be sunk where the sacredness of hearth is con-
cerned! Ergot P11 forbid the fellow the house!
and if he wants to know the reason, I'll tell
him!" And the next day proved the squire
quite as rude as his word.
Miss Hinton was sitting at an upper front
window the next morning, when Colonel Dan.
gerfield rode up. He bowed low as the mane of
his horse, in answer to her nod and smile of wel-
come. When he alighted, she left the room and
came to tbe head of the stairs, from whence she
heard his brisk knock, saw a servant go to the
door, heard his deep-toned voice enquirer . "Is
Squire Darling at home ?" and the false answer,
"No, sir." "Let Miss Hinton know then, that
I am here," said the Colonel, preparing to enter.
But the man held the door in his hand. and re-
plied, in the face of the truth, "Miss Hinton is
not at home, sir. She left here this morning
with my master, to go to Red-Stone Hall 1" Miss
Rinton's face kindled with indignation, and she
made one bound with the intention of running
down stairs to refute the falsehood, when she
felt her waist clasped from behind, and the hard
voice of Squire Darling saying,
"No you don't, my darling! What you told
me last night I believe to have been true-but
then it related to the past, and perhaps the pre-
sent, but gave no earnest for the future. 'Fore
wit is better than after wit'-' A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush'-and-' It's foolish to
'lock the stable-door after the steed is stolen.'
Ergo, I practice 'fore wit;' I keep my 'bird in
the hand,' and I secure my stablesdoors before
'the steed is stolen;' so be easy, my little
girl !"
The fell girl's brow grew black as night, as
she turned away from him to conceal her rage,
and sought her chamber. Squire Darling staid
home all day. That night, after the family had
retired to rest, the dark girl stealthily left her
chamber, (securing tl~e door on the outside,)
passed silently down th~ stairs, out of an end
door, entered the stables, saddled a horse, and
rode swiftly from the house.

Let me pick up some of the dropped stitches
in this complex net. Colonel Dangerfield, im
mediately aftt~r his last recorded interview with
Miss Summerfield, had hurried home. The
next morning he had written hasty notes of adieu
to Mrs. and Miss Summerfield, and set out upon
a longjourney. Ooly very recently he was sup-
posed to have returned. He was now at "Th'
Soldier's Rest," the modest name he had given
to his magnificent winter residence near Win-
chester Since his return he had not once ap-
proached Red Stone Hall This, as we have
seen, had filled the heart of Mrs. Summerfield
with uneasiness, roused to anxiety, when he de-
clined her invitation to dinner. Well it might
be so in a place where domestic and social pro-
priety of conduct is so strictly enforced and ob-
served, and where a departure from established
nile. of manners is visited with the same severity
as a dereliction from morals. It was well known
throughout the whole section of country, that the
heiress of Red-Stone Hall was affianced to Colonel
Dangerfield ;-.that she had been withdrawn from
school to fulfil this engagement; that CQlonel
Dangerfield had made splendid preparations at
"The Soldier's Rest" for the reception of his
bride, and gossip about the costly furniture im-
ported from London, Paris, and Constantinople,
was circulated with the usual quantum of ex-
aggeration, until curiosity was on the qui-vive for
the day when the imposing nuptial~ should be
celebrated, and the magnificent mansion with its
superb apartments, gorgeous furniture, and splen-
did decorations, should be thrown open to public
reception and inspection. But days had chased
days; weeks had slipped gter weeks; months
had followed months; ~ second year had
succeeded the first, an4 silver edged and sil-
ver sealed cards of invitation summoned the
eighborlng gentry to Red-Stone Hall; and the
eet repose of the Soldier's Rest was ixi-
roken-and what had befallen the wedding?

The good people of Jefferson County, you may
be certain, had something to talk about. The
perfect sleep of the Soldier's Rest remained un-
disturbed;-the gorgeous saloons, halls and cham-
bers remained closed ;-ali except the bachelor
apartments of Colonel Dangerfield, situated in
one of the back buildings. The curious passer
by, peering through the semi-circle of lofty
Lombardy poplar trees that surrounded the front
of the lawn, saw only through their foliage a
distant, broad expanse of glistening white mar-.
ble, with row above row of highly polished, dark
mahogany shutters, closely shut-the front view
of the mansion white, cold, impenetrable and re-
pellant as the brow of its lady elect.
But as in the woman, could you have seen be-
low that cold, severe surface, you would have
shrunk away in horror, scorched and blinded by
the fire burning there,-burning more intensely,
consumingly, for its very suppression ;-so in
the mansion could you have passed those marble
walls, and through those polished oak galleries,
halls and saloons, you might have come to a
room where the light of day was excluded, where
among the deep shadows sat or moved a tall,
dark form-like a bad thought in a black heart~
a dark form, gloomy and glowering, upon whose
countenance the lurid glare of a red coal fire cast.
up a weird, demoniac lght, giving the passion-
ploughed visage a yet more fell and fatal aspect;
and you might have fancied that this white and
glistening marble palace was the snow-covered
surface of a volcano, and this murky room, with
its deep black shadows and lurid red light, was
the centre, the forge of the burning lava, and
this dark giant moving among them the demon'-
prince of the earthquake and fiery irruption.
And there might have been more truth than
fancy in the conceit, for in that house, in that
room, in that form, in that ,1wart~ lurked, burned
the spark of a passion, should it blaze out, fatal
as ever fiery flood that, bursting from the bosom
of a volcano, buried a city in hot lava-deeply
wounded self.esteem-jealousy that had outlived
the love that first gave it birth
Now as he walked about the floor-the fire
casting his long, black shadow up to the ceiling
-he seemed restless, anxious with the expecta-
tion of somebody, or something; he would go to
the window, look out into the night, return and
trim the fire, walk twice or thrice across the
floor, open the door and peer out into the dark-
ness. At last the light, swift fall of a palfrey's
hoofs fell on his ear, and then starting, he seized
a paper match, applied it to the fire, then to the
wicks of a chandelier hanging from the ceiling,
and lot the scene was changed as by enchant-
ment. It was no longer a baleful, black figure,
moving fearfully amid black darkness,~ made
visible by gleams of lurid red flame. The rays
of the chandelier poured down in a thousand
rainbow-colored streams of dazzling light, upoa~

the form of a very handsome martial looking
man in the prime of life, arrayed in a splendid
undress uniform, and standing amid a scene of
luxury a sultan might have envied. Of all the
gorgeous apartments in that magnificent man-
sion, none could compare with this small room
for the very perfection of its adornments. The
chandelier had just blazed around, when the door
opened, and Sina Hinton stood in the midst of
the scene; her small, slight figure attired in a
closely fitting crimson satin, her jet black hair
pendant in a mass of glittering spirals down her
beautifully rounded shoulders, her thin, fierce
face sparkling with excitement. Colonel Danger-
field made an impulsive start, as though he would
have caught her to his bosom, but with a quick,
fierce gesture, she repelled him. Casting her
riding hat with all its plumes down upon the
carpet, she threw herself into a luxurious chair,
and lay there, her crimson drapery warmly glow-
ing in the light of the chandelier, her form and
face palpitating, quivering, sparkling, blaring
not unlike a small mass of fire, or a grenade half
exploded, that still continues to jet and sparkle.
Colonel Dangerfield checked the first impulse of
astonishment, composed himself and approached
Iter soothingly,
"Why, Sina, Sina. What is the matter, Sina,
*    Sina ?" he said, cautiously approaching his hand
to her h~ad, and deprecatingly, furtively'stro-
king her head, as you would that of a fierce,
beautiful pet cat you wished to caress, yet fear
ed it should bite. Wh' then, Sina, Sina, my
little salamander! my little fire queen, what is it?
Who has set a match to my little powder maga-
zine, now? Who now has fired my little gre-
nade?"
Sne struck off his hand sharply. He folded
his arms across his chest thenand stood quietly
and silently before her, watching her still glow-
ing, sparkling scintillating with agitation.
"Recollect yourself, Colonel Dangerfield, and
respect me," she said at last, fiercely.
He remained in the same attitude, patiently
waiting for her to recover herself. At last, in~
spied by a bright idea, he turned to a small but
elegant table, upon which stood several cut-glass
decanters and wine glasses, and pouring out
some wine, brought it to her. She pushed it
away, saying,
"No-would you add fire to fever? Water!"
Obediently he brought a glass of water, and
taking it, she quaffed it at a draught. This
cooled her somewhat. Returning the glass to
him, she said,
"Dangerfield, bear with me! You should not
cress me in a mood like this-when the wild-cat
is stirred up in me as it has been to-right I"
~s Compose yourself, Sina."
"Vorgiv-' me-another glass of water I thank
you. I am steadied now.. -IA.p.. Dangerfieldi
you got my note 1"

"Yes, my delightful little torpedo, I receive
your note; and have prepared my poor, lonely
apartments as I best could, for this bright
presence 1,,
"Ah I Mary, Virgin Mother I am I never to
be free from this sort of address ?"
"What mean you ?"
"Colonel Dangerlield I I have been indiscreet
in coming to your house; yet if you knew the
motive that has driven me to throw myself thus
upon your magnanimity for protection-you
would excuse-you would pity-succor the de-
fenceless orphan girl !'~ wept Sina, bowing tier
head till all her bright ringlets fell, veil like,
over her witching face.
"My dearest girl, explain yourself! do, Sina!
Come! I am your friend-confide in me," said
he, kindly taking her hand, and looking in her
countenance.
Sina turned her face away-stooped till her
ringlets fell and veiled it, and then said, in a half
stifled voice,
"How shall I. tell you! how shall 1 tell you
with this garish light glaring around-with your
eye upon me; how, oh! Virgin Mother! shall I
tell you! you of all men ?"
"Nay now, I entreat you speak, Sina! Come,
speak low! 1 will listen."
"Ah, Dangerfield! can you not imagine the
only thing that would drive me from 04k Giove,
to seek advice and assistance of you-what!
no answer! Shall I have to tell you then-"
continued Sina, in a smothered voice, burying
her face in the cushion. "That, that, that Oak
Grove, that Squire Darling~s house is no longer
a fit and proper home for me! There. it is
out!"
"SinaI Miss Hinton, you surprise me beyond
measure!"
"Is not my position a cruel one? Oh, is
it not ?"
"My dear Sina-my dear young lady, could
you not have sought shelter with Mrs. Summer-
field."
C~Ah, sir! do you not see the reusori why I
could not; the brother and sister-the father and
daughter-the uncle and niece, so long estranged
-so recently re-united; would you have bad
me, for any selfish motive of my own, however
excusable, expose that wrong which would have
made more mischief between them?"
This was said with an air of sincerity that
would have deceived an angel-it thoroughly
gulled Colonel Dangerfield.
"True! most true, my high-hearted girl!'
"Therefore, sirs I 4sne to you, as the only
friend I knew. I cocts~ to ask you to procure,
among your i~umerous acquaintances, a place 55
governess in some gentleman's family for me-
and to do it quickly; and to consider with wie
how I shall g' t of-what oxi-use I shall make,
so as not to expose Squire Darling to his sisl~er's

indignation! Can you assist me in my de-
sign?"
"Undoubtedly! But, Sina, I love you! love
you! Let my love shield you from this servi-
tude you would enter! ah, hear me, Sina!"
'.Colonel Dangerfield lit is late; I must re-
turn home," said Miss Hinton, rising and pick-
ing up her hat.
But Colonel Dangerfield caught her hand, and
gently forcing her back into' the chair, said,
"Not yet, Sina-and not alone; I must ride
with you, when you go. And now you must
listen to me. 1 love you, ~
~ "Sir, I must depart."
"Sina, my bird, you must not yet! Sina, I

that my affection is not altogether indifferent to

proves it! Now tell me why these words are

more reasons-come-come-- coma;" and with
every ward, he approached his hand towards
Sina's curie, as though he would have played
with them-but Miss Hinton drew off and re-
pulsed him. Never had SlIm permitted him so
much as to lift her dark little hand to his lips.
"I assure you, dearest Sina, you are a very in.
consistent girl-you are at once the most prudish,
and the roost indiscreet girl I ever saw! Come
now! I challenge you to set up another reason
for me to overthrow. Ahi you cannot do~ it I"
"Yes, sir, I cans" said Sina, turning suddenly
with one of her dazzling, blinding smiles; "yes,
sir, I can! a rule my mother taught me before I i
ever left her I"
"Good! your mother's rule-what was it?"
"Au! I will not tell you I"
"I insist upon hearing it. Com~, your last I
reason for not responding to my love; your mo- (
other's rule."
"Never to talL~ of love, till my lover talked of 3

Wildering smile.

ten. ~' Ruin. I think I do not misunderstand b

CHAPTER XXXIV.
FHR vESPER HOUR AT 5AORED HEART.
Sunday came. The Sunday upon which lmo.
gene Summerfield was, according to promise, to
unburden her bosom of "the perilous stuff" that
had so long lain and festered there. Miss Sun.
merfield was serene, though still melancholy.
The corrugated brow, the strained eye, the col-
lapsed cheeks and angular lines of anguish were I
no longer visible-nor was her sleep that preter-
natural ecstacy it had seemed before. Srae was
in her chamber that morning preparing to ac-
company her mother to church. It was the
habit of those families who lived ten, fifteen,
and even twenty miles from Sacred Roart, to
leave home very early on Sunday morning, or Pu.
mediately after a very early breakfast, and go to
church to stay all day, that is through the early
mass, the sermon, and the evening vespers-ta.
king with them one or two servants and u ham-
per of provisions. And it is one of the queer
and picturesque sights periuliar, I believe, to the
old and sparsely settled counties of MaryLand and
Virginia, to see the small country church, in its
grove of trees, with carriages and horses tied to
almost every tree, and after the sermon, negroes
lounging about, or feeding horses, and famiLes
at lunch in their carriages or even in their pews.
Mrs. Summerfield, besides a hamper of provi-
sions for her own family, always took a bottle of
crusted port or of champagne, and some rare
dainty besides for Father Burleigh; and frequent.
by after vespers were over in the evening, Miss
Mattie Smilie would come to her pew door with
her round face, meek, chastened smile and plea-
sant voice, and press Mrs. Summerfield and
'*Miss Imogene" to stop in at the cottage and
take a cup of tea and some of her nice egg-pont
to warm them before their ride home-and as
frequently Mrs. Summerfield would smilingly
accept the affectionate invitation. That little
Miss Mattie was so neat and nice and fragrant!
though I think somehow or other the dear old
soul never got any new clothes. In church you
might always see her in a faded light calico
gown "clean as a penny," and "neat as a new
pin," and a faded, light colored cleaa shawl, and
an old-fashioned clean straw bonnet, with, a
washed and ironed ribbon on it, with a blue-
white crimped, full cap border all around her
dear old edifying face. And there was always
that smell of fragrant dried herbs about, her, for
Miss Mattie's clothes, house, table, and bed
linen, when not in use, were literally "laid up in
lavender," or bergamot, or sweet marjoram, or
sassafras, for her clean old chest-drawers and
presses were full of them. And indeed in my
infancy when [ heard for the first time of the
"odor of sanctity," I thought it had reference
to Miss Mattie, her fragrant dried herbs and her

SHANN(
5~~flf5~ relics. When in her extreme old age I
once visited herald she hung around my neck
an Agsrus Dei, a small pink satin heart stuffed,
and in the very middle of the stuffing a relic t)3e
size of half a rice grain, saying it was the bones
of St. Agnes, Virgin and Martyr, and that it was
a "protection against temptation"-it smelt so
fragrant of lavender and bergamot, that saints
bones and aromatic dried herbs entered my head
together, and have never been separated since.
She used to make me fancy, too, in spite of all
the glistening and bristling new finery of a
country church, that light colored "fady" cali-
coes, and old poke bonnets with washed and
ironed ribbons, were the very neatest and sweetest
dress in the world. One thing I felt sure, that
Miss (~Iattie was the very cleanest, neatest, most
fragrant little fat and rosy old lady 1 ever looked
at, and the mildest, meekest, most composing
and refreshing old lady I ever talked with. She
had but one trouble in the world, and that was,
as she would say, with her good smile, "Poor
Sammy and his ways," meaning-if you have
"forgotten to remember" the relation-Mr.
Sammy Smilie of Harper's Ferry, and she only
regretted her poverty because she would have
no money to leave to pay for having masses said
for the repose of Sammy's soul after his death.
No bright young child, no beautiful and good
girl ever brought more quiet sunshine into a
church or dwelling than did Miss Mattie, with
her edifying manners, as I said, half bonhom-
mb, half beatitude. She would mildly and smi-
lingly exhort the rich to trust in God and try this
nice soup, in the same sentence; and talk of the
joys of Heaven, and the juices of this nice new
ham so strengthening to the stomach and so gocd
to coax a lingering appetite, in the same breath.
She would kneel down quite naturally arid pray
for the conversion of people's souls and the cure of
their cholics, in the same tone. I am not sure
when her chickens had the pip that she did not
make it a subject of fasting and prayer. I knew
very well when she lost her well worn and faded
thread gloves, she fasted and prayed every day
till they were found, for she told old Nerve so,
who replied to her,
"Well! I should be afraid to bother my bless-
ed heavenly Marster about such trifles."
c~But, honey, it wezrn't a true, it cost me
three-fippenny bits, and I had not had 'em over
two years, and they were jest as gqod as bran new
except that there was about six or seven, or in-
deed for that matter it might have been eight
little darns in 'em; and that-was-all, and
neither do I think that the Blessed Lord and the
ever blessed Virgin ia in defiant to what grieves
their childun-~even gloves - because you see,
honey, I sinful poor creature as I am, pity even
a little duck with the gapes5 or a fly drowned in
tim water, and is the Lord alay less loving than
what I am?"

But this is a flagrant digression-I must
stop. Though I could go on much farther With
details about the old priest's housekeeper, very
interesting to me, certainly, but not so much
so I fancy to you, and I some how regret that at
the end of this tale of real life, I shall have to
drop Miss Mattie without having made you ac-
quainted with half her meek and enduring
virtues.
Mrs. Summerfield had put her basket of lunch
into the hands of her servant, with directions
to stow it away in the box of the carriage, and
to mount himself, speedily, and be ready to at-
tend them to open the gates, and then she had
gone up stairs to see Imogene before their depar-
ture.
~C How do you feel now, my dearest child ?"
she asked, stealing her arm around her Waist as
she stood before a glass arranging her hair,
"Calm, mother, very calm."
"I am pleased, Imogene, there is one thing I
never mentioned to you."
"Well, mother ?"
"That night upon which I woke you up, was
not the ~rst night I had watched by you while
sleeping."
"My dear, dear mother! did I merit such
goodness at your hands ?"
"Yes, Imogene, my love, why not? Besides,
Imogene, I will tell you-what--now I fear you
will never prove, in your own self, namely-that
a mother's love never slumbers nor sleeps. But,
Imogene, there at your bedside I witnessed a
phenomenon I cannot ~
"Well, mother ?"
"Pei~haps you can explain ~
"I do not know-let me hear it."
"You-but tell me first, how did you usually
rest, imogene ?"
"Delightfully, mother. My life, indeed, was
'two-fold-sleep had its own world."'
"Ab !-go on."
"Full of bitterest remorse, and most insuffer-
able anguish, as my days were, mother, I could
not tell you how delicious were my nights, my'
dreams-nor how the blissful visions of the
night enhanced the misery of the next day. It
was a psychological mystery, mother !-I had
no control over my dreams. I have believed in
the possibility of controlling dreams, but I could
not do it. I would pray, read, fall asleep re-

stood by my side; we wandered, hand-in-hand,
through marble halls, cooled with sparkling
fountains; perfumed with myriads of flowers;
musical with millions of birds; and thence, into
the saloons, hung with richest and rarest paint-
ings, with niches filled with marble statues;

luxury than Eastern poetry and magnificence
could imagine; and thence again, into gardens
of more than ideal beauty, and exuberance of
exotic vegetation; and through orchards of rich
and blooming tropical fruit; into vineyards,
where the purple grape, like clusters of rubies,
hung amid leaves of emeralds; out into fields of

cities; and of blue water, thinly dotted with
islands. Then, mother! what shall I tell you I

"Sina, I shall go with you to church, to-day,"
said Squire Darling to Miss Hinton, that morn-
ing at breakfast.
"Shall you, sir ?" asked the young lady.
"Yes, I shall; and 1 shall stay all day, and
return with you alter vespers."
"Do you not think it will be too much for
you, sir? Recollect, you have not ridden so
far yet-nor have you yet attempted to sit up
all day, without your mid-day nap."
"Tender creature! I can take my mid-day

his arm, and greeted his sister and niece. He
and his brain-fever joined the cottage party,
and ordered of! their basket in the track of Mrs.
Suumerlield's hamper. Miss Summerfield re-
quested to be left alone in the church. Her
wien excited no surprise. It was not unusual-
such retirement, for self-examination and prayer
in the time of Lent So Imogene was left to
her meditations in the lonely church, while the
rest of the party migrated to the cottage parlor.
In their route thither, they passed several par-
ties, like themselves, coming from a distance,
and staying all day at church. Dear little Miss
Mattie smiled, and nodded meekly, as she pass-
ed them, looking very much as though she would
like to have them all along, but that was im-
possible-the tiny cottage not having the capa-
cit.ies of a large hotel for accommodation; so
Miss Mattie bad to content herself with promis-
ing mentally to invite some among them next
Sabbath, and all, each in their turn. Squire
Darling followed last of all, with his little ring-
lotted infatuation still hanging on his arm.
"Ab, my little Carditis I -he wasn't here to-
day! Isn't it a pity, now? My dear little blaze,
I'm sorry for you-you burn quite blue upon the
occasion I"
"I do not in the least understand you, Squire
Darling!"
"Don't it-the innocent! Colonel Danger-
field was not at church this morning I"
"Was he not-I did not observe."
"Oh! ho-ho-.-ho-ho! as if one could be-
lieve that 1"
The fat squire was in an angry, jealous, mock-
ing, yet triumphant mood.
Miss Hinton dropped her long, black lashes,
~.nd long, black ringlets, and looked persecuted
and patient. She was temporarily delivered
from her tyrant, at the pic-nic dinner-table in
the cottage kitchen.
Evening came. Vespers were over. The con-
gregation were departing. Squire Darling with
a look of huge gratification tucked his beautiful
crimson sin under his arm, and prepared for a
start, saying, brutally,
"Ah! my dear Cardialgy-not here this
evening either! however, misery likes company,
my dear Ruby, and there is Miss Harry, whose
heart is breaking too, in the same cause-and
there is my superb niece looking like a martyr,
infatuated with the stake! Come along, Cardi-
..lgy, let us go home."
"Thank you sir! I have accepted an invita-
tion from Mrs Summerfield, to. return with her
to-night!" said Miss Hinton, with a look of
malice.
"The d-l you have !" exclaimed the thun-
derstruck and enraged squire.
*Hep.rt.burn.

ONDALE.
It was no use though. His anger was per-
fectly impotent. He was tempted to go to his
sister, with Sina under his arm, and say to her,
"Here! this is the cause of the fatal estrange.
ment between Dangerfield and Imogene,"-but
as I said before, in his greatest fury, Siria's honor
was not forgotten. Re would bitterly upbraid
and brutally tyrannize over her himself, but he
would not expose her to the slightest reproach
from any otherT-so the squire bolted his fury,
and took leave of Sina and his sister, telling hex
that he should send the carriage for Miss Hinton,
early the next morning- Mrs. Summerfield went
again into the cottage, to wait until her daugh-
ter's religious exercises were over. Father Bur-
leigh went into the confessional.
Miss Summerfield-her pale brow still lumi-
nous with the glory of inspiration, passed on to
the church~ The inside of the church -the
splendid altar-the gorgeous pictures-were all
glorious in the golden lustre of the setting sun,
that pouring through the western windows, yel-
low-flooded the whole sdene. The altar occu-
pied the centre of the north end-the pulpit
the right hand corner, and the confessional the
left hand; both these were hung with scarlet
drapery, and glowed hotly in the sunshine--a few
moments-and then-even as Imogene entered
the confessional-the 5~~5 disc dropped behind
the near mountain, and the whole church fell
into sudden gloom.
It was about this time, that Sina-expressing
a wish to retire to the church and prepare her
soul by seif-examisration and pray&amp;, for the sa-
crament of confession-left Mrs Summerfield.
It was deep twilight gloom, when she softly
glided in her serpentine motion up the aisle and
slippeJ into a closely curtained box, near the
confessional, and never used but as a place of
strict retiracy for meditation, previous to con-
fession.
She had been here perhaps five minutes, whpn
the curtains were parted and another person en-
tered. It was Col. Dangerfield. He pressed her
hand in silence, awed by the holy stillness of
the place, and passed on to the seat she indicated
on the other side of herself, and nearest the con-
fessional. He sat down and turned to speak to
her-when she raised her linger to her lips, in
token of silence, just as the profound stillness of
the church was broken by the low tones of a
deep, rich voice, saying-"Bless me, Father, be-
cause I have sinned." He recognized Imogene's
full, round tones, in the opening of the ritual.
There was a pauses-disturbed bythe solemn, but
inaudible voice of the aged priest. Col. Danger-
field with a start of surprise-got up-would
have left the pew, but that Sina put her hand
upon him, with an imploring look, and pressed
him down into his seat, just as Miss Summer-
field's low, melodious voice was heard again in
the comfiteor-but the words were nearly inau-

S I-I AN N 0
dible, until she was heard to murmur, "I accuse
myself of having given to the creature-the love
-the adoration- -the worship due only to God"
Then, her voice was again inaudible during the
five or ten minutes that her rich, deep tones
trembled onward in her story. Then her voico
ceased. There was a dead, dead pause.-
Again Colonel Dangerfield started to icave, but
Sina turning very pale, leaned against the front
of the pew, barricading the door, and signed to
him that she felt extremely agitated-horrified
by what it appeared she had heard, though he
had not! she signed to him to wait a moment,
until she should have recovered herself. Re
dropped again into his seat, with a dark frown
of impatience. This eaves-dropping, although
it was, on his part, and he believed on Sina's,
quite involuntary, and although he actually as
yet, bad heard little or nothing,-was neverthe-
less, extremely repugnant to his sense of honor.
Now the deep, stern, awful voice of the priest
arose-yes, deep, stern and awful as that of the
Judge at the last day-falling upon the ears of
the stout soldier, and of the little demon by his
side with awful impression-with the thunder
of the final doom. The first words of the so-
lemn denunciation were lost, and nothing was
heard distinctly until he said,
"And lastly, oh, thou pernicious girl 1-since
thou hast dared in defiance of God'.~ blighting
curse, to lift thy impious thoughts and sacrilegi
ous eyes up to the Lord's annointed-the holy
one of Israel-the beloved son 01 Christ-the
gi1te~l young brother whose exalted piety has
endowed him, in the opinion of the people, with
the gift even of miracles-hear thy sentence I-
through thy very sin shalt thou do penance!-
through thy very sin shalt thou have added to
the fires of consuming remorse-the shame of
utter self-abasement, and of utter humiliation!
Hear! To this pure and holy man shalt thou go,
and to him, who, in the untarnished image of
hi. Maker, is of too pure eyes to behold iniquity,
-to him shalt thou confess thy impious-thy sa-
creligious love-that in his utter loathing of thy
degradation and thy guilt, thou mayest grow to
apprehend its enormity; and from him shalt thou
receive the sentence of penance, he shall think
most necessary to expiate thy atrocious crime,
and to save thy else too surely lost soul, from ut-
ter perdition!"
A long, low scream of "mercy! mercy!" a
heavy fall-and then Colonel Dangerfield, start-
ing to his feet, upsetting his little devil in his
haste, and rushing to the confessional, raised the
fainting form of Imogene Summerfi~ld~ and bore
it from the church, and into the cottage.
*      .      .     .      a      a
An hour afterwards, Imogene opened her eyes.
The shame, the terror, the anguish, were alJ
gene. Her face revealed a heavenly serenity-
nay, indeed, it seemed that while her body had

beer. lying in insensiburty. her soul must have
been in heaven, and received some divine inspi-
ration, for when she opened her eyes, her coUrt-
tenance beamed with a celestial glory, even on
the stern old priest bending over her bed; and
her tones were full of earnest love when taking
his hard, old hand between her own, she said, "I
thank you for making him my judge! I accept
it! to him will I reveal my whole soul-from
him receive my sentence-and suffer it, what.
ever it be, with, oh! how much joy I"
"Sina, I am free! Sina, will you have me?"
~Yes.~
Then, Colonel Dangerfield folded the wily sy-
ren to his bosom, imprinting on her lips the very
first kiss she had ever permitted, deeming him-
self "very blest."

Miss Hinton put this in her pn.~ke, and the
carriage rolled on towards Oak Grove. Arrived
at the fork in the road where the leit hand turn
led to t.he "Soldier's Rest," Miss Hinton called
to the driver,
"Uncle Kill! Uncle Kill I"

Miss Hinton repeated her order.
"Can't do it, Miss."
'5Wlirst? how dare you, sir, disobey my order?
Turn instantly to the left!"
"Sorry I can't obligerate you, Miss Sina; but
ole master's orders to fetch you straight home
were very peremptolute." -
"See here, sir i you insolent fellow!" said
Sina, burning with rage, "turn immediately
where I tell you, or you shall meet with severe
punishment."
"Tnat may be a doubtingency, Miss Sina, if
I don't; whereas, if I does turn out with you,
it'! be an absolutive certainty I" and so saying,
the old negro put whip to his horses and drove
furiously to ~vards Oak Grove
Arrived there, Miss Hinton went into the diaw-
ing-room, an4 sent for S~nire Darling. Squire
Darling was having a conversation with old Kill.
Poor old Kill! he thought by his literal obedience
to ordei a to merit his master's approbation. So
it was with visible delight that he related hie
little altercation with Miss Hinton, taking care
to say, however, that he would very gladly have
obliged Miss ~1inton, if he co* have done so
without disobeying his master. Our stout squire
fell into a rage with Sines, inhat positively threat-
ened to end in an apoplectic fit. But with his
habitual care for Miss Hinton's standing in the
household, be relieved himself, and deluded and
alarmed poor old Kill, by bursting into a fit of
violent fury upon kim. demanding to know why
he did not mind Miss Hinton? His own com-
mands were to be obeyed, it was true, alecats,
ex~epiing when Miss Ilinton'i wishes interfered!
He (old Kill) knew that! He ought to have his
bar" head broken! It should be done the next
time such a thing occurred! Now we all know
that had poor old Kill committed the mistake of
taking Sina to the Soldier's Rest, he would
have virtually signed his own passport to
cotton fields of Mississippi. And in fact the
old man still suspected as much hiq~iself s how-
ever, with a deprecating "reverence" he re-
plied, that he was very sorry to have mistaken
his master's wishes; that it was not yet too late
to remedy the error; that the horses were still
quite fresh; finally that he could then drive Miss
Binton where she wished to go.
"No SIR! It is dinner time! Miss Hinton is
also very much fatigued I I shall not permit her
to go over all that ground again! Begone i"
It was at this moment that the message from
Sina arrived, calling him into the drawing-room.
He went in. putting a violent restraint upon him-
self, welcomed her home, and desired to be in-
formed of her particular pleasure and purpose in
sending for him.                          '1

folks find their own messengers. Anything else,
Miss Hinton, that I can do for your pleasure-
not that! not that, my dear Carditis! It is too
much to ask of a man! What, the d-~-.l! ar~
you so deeply disappointed at not seeing him at
chapel all day yesterday, that you must go and
make him a visit to-day ?"
Whether Sina Elinton's guardian demon de.
served her that night or not, I do not know.
Certain it is, however, that she was not one to
brook control, or bear disappointment. The
time was not ripe, openly to defy Squire Darling,
if indeed defiance would have served her turn at
all. Be that as it might have been, at eight
o'clock, Miss Hinton bade good-night to Squire
Darling, and retired to her own room-not to
stay, however; very soon she cautiously emerged
from the chamber, and creeping stealthily down
stairs, saddled a horse with her own hands, and
left the house as before, unconscious of a dark
figure on horse-back perseveringly dogging her
course.
The same luxurious chamber, the same hand-
some occupant awaited our little villain; the
only difference being that Colonel Dangerfield, in
a gorgeous dressing-gownreclined in a large, easy
chair, covered with gold colored satin, with his
wounded foot resting upon a cushion.
"My dear, brave, imprudent girl! I knew
you would come! but why then not come in the
day-time and 'with a proper escort ?"
Sina explained, with luxuriant embellishments,
the occurrences of the day.
"My dear Sinai to what a tyranny yon are
subjected. But take courage, Sinai As soon
as I can get a boot on this cursed-I beg your
pardon-I meant to say this crippled foot, I shall
go over to Oak Grove, and paying Squire Dar-
ling the respect due him as your guardian, little
is he deserves it, I shall ask leave to visit you
it his house, informing him of our engagement
it the sa~ne time. I do trust, my dear love, that
shall be able to come over to-morrow"

Sina exerted all her powers of fascination that
evening, and with unprecedented success; never
was a rational man more thoroughly bewildered,
a christian man more completely bed~ivllled than
was Colonel Dangerfield when Sina left him that
night. Look where he would, or shut his eyes
if he pleased, the image of a fiery and intoxica-
ting sprite in crimson satin, whose eyes were
grappling hooks, whose ringlets were nets and
meshes, caught and entangled him.
In the meantime our little scamp pursued her
way lame, where a warm welcome was await-
ing her, of which by the way she was quite un-
conscious.
Squire Darling paced up and down the long
area of his library, cursing the lameness that
still prevented his mounting a horse. Now
he stood with his back to the glowing hickory
fire; now he walked to the window and looked
out into the night; now he pulled the bell rope
violently, unil the whole house resounded, and
the whole grove echoed, bringing in a servant.
"Has Achilles returned yet ?"
"Curse him, he is very slow! Do you be on
the watch for him, sir, and as soon as he comes,
do you take charge of his horse yourself, and
send him without the loss of a moment's time to
me."
"Yes, sir; anything else master I"
" No, go l,~
The man withdrew.
"Satan snatch the fellow! what keeps him so
long-nine-yes, by Jove, ten o'clock, and he
not returned yet."
He seized the bell rope and gave it another
succession of violent jerks. The man immedi-
ately re.entered.
"More light here! My candle is sinking in
its socket."
"Yes, sir! Uncle Kill has come, Sir I I hear
his horse's hoofs gallopping into the yard now."
"Out of my sight then, in double quick time,
and send him up here; let Aim bring the candies."
C~Yes, sir," and the man withdrew.
In a very few minutes Uncle Kill entered the
room bearing the lights.
"Ahi you have come! Set them on the
chimney-piece! Now then-yo~i kept a watch
over your young lady."
"Yes, sir."
* "You followed her at a respectful distance-
near enough to protect, yet not near enough to
annoy her."
"Yes, marster-no, marster-I means she
never knowed nothing' 'bout my hem' on to her

"Yes, sir! at the md door, sir I"
"When-what hour ?"
"At half-past eight o'clock, sir I"
is "Yes, by the devil's dam, whose daughter she
I,' muttered the squire, between his teeth,
"that was the hour she took leave of me for the
night, saying that she had already kept me up
beyond my time, which was true, and that she
would then go to bed herself, which was false.
Well, sir! what then I"
"You, see, roarster, how it wur very dark,

"Who the d-l, sir, authorized you to look

angrily exclaimed the squire, though it is to be
presumed that if old Kill had made any disco-
veries, the squire Would not have been averse to
hearing them and profiting by his servant's
eavesdropping. As it turned out a fruitless
peeping, however, our squire could afford to in-
dulge in a fit of virtuous indignation without loss.
"'Deed, sir, I thought," commenced old Kill,
excusing himself.
"Oh! the fiend! what business had you to
think? Well! and then ?"
"Then, sir, I comed away, an' left her there,

"Because his matrimonial apartments are not

The blood rushed to Squire Darling's head-
his throat swelled-his lace turned black--the
veins started like cords-he trembled all over-
he staggered, sank into a chair; the perspira-
tion started, streamed from his face this save4
Squire Darling from a stroke of apoplexy, I do
believe. He tremblingly drew a handkerchief
from his pocket, wiped his eyes again and again
-heaved a profound nigh-drew a deep breath,
and recovered himself.
Sina was burning, blazing, sparkling, scintil-
lating-mirth, scorn and defiance, in every glow
of her crimson-draped figure, and every flash of
her fierce and elfin features.
"Au-audacious! un-unblushing girl!" gasp-
ed the nearly suffocated squire.
"Why should I blush I"
"She-she glories in her shame 1"
"In my innocence, and the perfect safety of
my position, sir !"
"The perfect safety of your position, you
shameless-oh! my Lord! I do not wish ~o for-
get that she is a woman!"
"Ah, ha! now we are going to have re-
hearsed another comedy of jealousy!"
"Jealousy ! not so, my dear girl! Do not
flatter yourself that I shall amuse you with any
such food for satire, this evening-useless as ab-
surd! No, Sina~ but you need to be looked after
and taken care of."
"Possibly you would recommend a strait-
jacket, sir!"
"Possibly I might, Miss Hinton-at all events
you need to be controlled; and I must have a
better right than now I have, to control you.
And now, this night, Sina, and before you leave
this room, we must come to a down-right under-
standing."
Her tone changed. She left off her flippant,
half-scornful manner of replying, and seating
herself composedly, she said,
"!es-it is as well thht before I leave the
room, we do come to a distinct and final under-
standing; pray proceed, sir."
"Then, Miss Hiuton, are you ready to give,
me your hand to-morrow ?"
"No, sir !"
"When then?"
" P1 ever, sir I"
"Never !"
'Most assuredly, never !"
"Ha! we'll see! pray why ?"
"Because, sir, I have promised the said sallow.

"The d-l! no! that can't be! I swear it

"It's not so! what! Dangerfield! he! so
Aaughty!"
"Exactly, sir! so haughty, that he defies the
commentaries of his neighbors, and dares to
please himself in the choice of a wife. even when
that choice rests on a penniless girl like me I"
"Here's a dell of a tuss! Oh! it's all an
imposition! It can't be so! Wtiat'i~ more, ±t

"She has discarded him, sir, or set him free,
which amounts to the same thing !"
"The d-l! I knew you were trying to en-
trap him. I knew you were flirting desperately
with him-but I knew that you w~re too selfish,
cold and fierce, to come to any harm; and I
never Ireamed that he would wish to marry
you?"
"Thank you, sir !"
"Sins! he shall not have you! By the blood
of Beelzebub! he shall not have you to save his,
to save your own life I"
Miss Hint~n smiled contemptuously
"And what is more, I will have you myself!
I've used persuasion, entreaty, long enough;
now I'll try something else-for, though all tue
power of heaven, and the ingenuity of earth, and
the malignity of hell, were league to prevent
~t, I will have you!"
Miss ilinton laughed scornfully.
"Why don't you answer me, girl ?"
"Because you rave-and it is folly to reply to
raving. How on earth, I should be glad to know,
are you to prevent my marrying whom I
please ?"
"How? i'll go to him, and say that I have
been this girl's lover for two years-during the
whole of which time she has lived with me !"
Miss Hinton raised her splendid eyes, blazing
with defiance, to his.
"And if you do, sir! you will but endorse
what I have told him myself! You will but give
him a new motive for hastening our marriage,
that I may be the more speedily released from
this persecution!'

io the worst, I will go to hiut, and will say that
which you may very readily guess, Miss Hintois
and which will prevent his marrying you !,
Now Siria turned deadly pale with fear. and
rage. Her very lbs were white, and trembling
as she said
"You! a Virginian gentleman! a Darling!
No! you will never do that !"
"Will I not? Miss Hinton, I am the only one
you can, in any sort of honor, marry. I love
you-wish to marry you-will settle a fortune
on you-will place you at once at the head of
society in this neighborhood; but, Sina, if you
persist in this fancy for my rival-,se help me
heaven, I will go to Colonel Dangerfield, and
whisper that in his ear which shall lead him to
break withyou!"
"You will not! no, you will not do that,"
frantically exclaimed Sins..
"Look in my face and see if I will not!"
"Do IT, 5IR~ THEN !" ~t last, in fury, broke
out Sina. "Do it! but do not hope that that
perfidy will serve you! For, look you! 1 am a
fiend incarnate! My mother's mistehiess wrongs!
my own! have made me so! The only human
feeling I have, is an affection for Dangerfield-
an affection that shall not be wounded! shall
not, under any contingency, while he only loves
me! For, oh! listen man! that stan'ieth there
talking of some weak counterfeitthsx thou call'st
love! and mixing it up with carriages and
horses, and houses, and marriage settlements!
Listen! I love Dangerfield-he loves me! and
neither your perfidy, his pride, nor my own soul's
salvation, shall separate us! No I no! no! I
will follow him! live with him! ilve for him! I
had rather be Dangerfield's servant, his dog, than
your wife, with all the emoluments of that honor-
able office! and feeling, as I do, there were
luas shame in it !" Her face worked, nay con-
vulsed with the warring passions of anguish,
despair, and rage! Strange, but the storm, the
tornado raging in her bosom, attracted him
powerfully ; he had been very pale-now his face
flushed deeply; he stretched out his hand, caught
her-strained, her, struggling, to his bosom-
cleared her ringlets from her agonized face, and
~half suffocated her with kisses, exclaiming be-
tween them,
"And I will tell him that tf&amp;u.r I have had her
in my arms-thws I have strained hem to my
bosom!'
"Bold !" said Sins, in a low, deep, stern, con-
centrated tone of rage- "You hug yqur death-
be warned! release me. or Iwill KILL YOU
"1 lose my time," sneered he, resuming his
caresses-and saying between them, "Ah! lit..
tie kittens snarl and slit, but seldom bite like
n',bler animals !"
Iwill kill you !'
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! so you threatened once

Commandments says."
Mrs. Sommerfeld explained-while she array-
ed herself in her bonnet and shawl-that it was
impossible for Nerve to bail her husband out of
jail in the way proposed. Poor old Nerve open-

ed wide her eyes at this, and replied with more
indignation than we have ever seen her dii..
play-
"Not I-not let me pawn myself for my ole
man! Well! I mm' say, as I never murmurs
at anything my blessed Lord in heaven, or my
pastors an' masters on the yeth thinks proper
for to do-but I mus' say !-that that's very nard,
and very 'rannical, very!-when they let a rich
person bail their frien' out'n jail with money-
they won't let a poor person bail their out
with all they* got--their poor ole body I" and
dropping down at the front door, whch they
had all now reached, the old woman rolled on
the marble pavement, giving herself up to sob-
bing and groaning.
Mrs. Summerfield stooped down and said,
gently-
"Nerve, do not cry. I will bail Achilles
out-if it be possible. Don't cry. Get up, and
ensue with me."
Her kind words, and a glass or two of water,
helped the poor old creature upon her feet, and
she entered the carriage with Mrs. Summerfield.
"Take care of your cousin, Imogene. If no-
eessary, 1 will send the carriage back for beth
~.f you, and in that case, you will know how to
bring her without alarming her"
It was not until they hat! ridden some way,
that Mrs. Summerfield could draw from Nerve
anything like a connected statement of what had
~efallen. At last, however, she said-
"Why, you see, Miss Mar'get, honey, las'

Away at once with love and jealousy.
Shakspeare.
£here was quite a crowd of people assembled
at Oak Grove. There is nothing, neither wed-
ding, christening, nor funeral, for bringing people
together like a catastrophe, particularly if there
is a mystery in it. On seeing the state of Squire
Darling, Mrs. Summerfield had thought proper to
send, first for Miss Summerfield, old Mrs. Dar-
ling, and Mrs. Ardenne, from Red-Stone iall.
These three ladles had arrived, accompanied by
Harriet Joy, who was always ready to offer her
assistance in every species of distress. Next
she had sent for Colonel Dangerfield, in his capa-

Squire Darling's wounds had been dressed, and
be lay upon his bed flat on his back, perfectly
motionless, his eyes half open, but "lacking
speculation," his lips blue and glutinous, his skin
of that gray paleness, which is usually the
gathering shades of death. Winny, weak and
pale, sat by her father's bed, her "numbed"
affections slowly reviving at the piteous sight.
Sina Hinton, in the opposite wing of the build-

the idea that she had murdered Squire Darline
and was about to be led to the scaffold for th
crime; all her desperate shrieks and violent
struggles were to escape the visionary exeen

These conversations would occur after Sina,

worn out her strength, and lay in a state of tem-

singular that no one noticed her raving, or at-

Squire Darling? On the contrary, every one

by the cool heads and unburdened hearts of two

confined-not in jail yet, as poor Nerve and his
fellow-servants for his better security had been
led to suppose-but in a distant chamber in the
house, there to await the arrival of the other
magistrates.
They came about noon. One a stern, severe
looking man; tall, lean, dark, bilious, exceed-

tions; his whole grave and still deportment cx-

Lt ducted in the parlor. The three magistrates
occupied seats at one end of ~he room. "1. Rock,
e Esq.," occupying the centre chair. and flanked
-, on the right by the pretty little Mr. Lovejoy,
r and on the left by the stern and sad Colonel
B Dangerfield. A long table was before them, at
a one end of which sat a clerk, with pen, ink and
r paper before him. The family and visitors then
in the house were requested to be present at the
examination. And indeed by this time the house
swarmed with all sorts of people. The servants,
I with frightened looks and whispering tones, were
collected in the passage ways.
Presently poor old Kill was led, or rather drag.
I ged in, half dead with terror, and between two
constables. He was the perfect ideal of abject
guilt. His looks would have been evidence
enough to any jury to bring in a verdict of
GUILTY. Yes, his face then would have hanged
him. He was followed by old Nerve, weeping
bitterly, and goaded in by a man with a stick,
walking behind her. Kill was placed before his
judges, and then Nerve threw herself on his
neck weeping and hugging, and hugging ~nd
weeping; while between sobs and gasps she en.
hosted him as follows-
"Oh I Killus, honey I 'fess, chile! 'less! tell

gifted young curate.
I have spoken before of the half suppressed
joyousness of heart that was the very illumina-
tion of his highly vitalized beauty, and of thaL
power springing from perfect healthfulness of
body, mind, and spirit-rising above circum-
stacces, and making glad every gloomy scene,
bright every dark scene; magnetizing the sick
with health; inspiring the septic with faith
raising the responding by hope; softening the
hardened, and redeeming the reprobate sinner by
love! Jt was in the fullness of this power that
Claude Vellernonte sat by the bed of Father Bur-
leigh on the afternoon of the Sunday next pre-
ceding Easter. He had composed his patient
into a refreshing sleep. He had slept many
hours, and still Claude Vellemonte retained his
seat by the bed watching him steadily. At any
sign of restlessness Claude would quietly slip
his arm under the aged head, raise it tenderly,
change the pillow, let the weary head down
easily again, draw out his arm, and smoothing
back the thin gray locks from the sunken tem-
ples, decompose him to sleep. If again he stir-
red, a few pauses of the cool hand over his brow
and temples stilled him into deep repose-so his
rest was protracted for many hours. At last
Claude Vellemonte knowing that he had slept
long enough suffered him to awake. The yorrng
man sponged his hands and face with cold water
and ~ologne, and gave him a glass of barley
water flavored with lemon-juice. Then he
changed his pillows and resumed his seat by his
side with cheerfulness.
"Claude," began the old priest.
C~ My father!" answered the young man.
"My son in years-my father 1 had almost
said in wisdom and in grace I-~ bless ne for 1
have sinned.'"
"May God the Father, God the Son, and God
the Holy Ghost bless thee, my father!"
"Son, I have somewhat to say to thee I"
"Speak, father, I listen"
"Draw the curtain, shut out the light, close
the door, for it is a long and dark story I have to
tell thee, my son I"
Claude Vellemonte did as requested and re-
sumed his seat at the bedside of the invalid. He
took one of the old wasted hands within his own
and held it while the old priest gained strength
to tell his story.
"Claude, did it never occur to you that I had
a life-long sorrow and remorse 2"
"I have seen it, father, and hoped for the day
when you would confide in me and share your
burthen with me-to-night, I thank God, that
you have strength to do so-I listen."
And he pressed the thin hand, and his young
strong life seemed to send energy through all the
feeble nerves of the invalid. The old priest com.
menced his story.

Tif E SECRET UJIIME.
Claude Vdlemontei I was early left an orphan
with my ti~in sister. We were placed by the
executor of our father's will in the same Mo-
nastic school for education-she in the female
department-i in the male. We were then fif-
teen years of age. 1 admired that sister of mine
with an enthusiasm that no words can describe!
I loved her with a strength and devotion to
which no words can do justice. She was my
sole thought in the present, my sole object in
the future I She was my love, my religion, my
idolatry! If I had an ambition for wealth, rank,
power, or fame, it was that she might be crown-
ed with glory! The strict rule of the seminary
in which we were placed forbade our meeting.
The boys and the girls, or it would now be term.
ed, the young gentlemen's and the young ladies'
department had not even a chapel in common,
but each had its separate place of worship and
its distinct pastor. Once a month, however, I
was permitted to see my sister for half an hour
in the ladies' parlor, In the presence of one of the
siBterhood. These, restricted as our intercourse
was, were the very brightest moments of my
sebool days. Veronica was beautiful! Brothers
do not generally see their sister's beauty, but 1
felt Veronica's extreme loveliness in my heart of
hearts. I could see in every succeeding visit J
paid her, a ne~ unfolding of beauty-some new
fresh leaf of the sweet bud blooming forth I
How I longed for the time to come when we
should be of age-be emancipated from school
life, and when I should take her home and have
her with me forever. Then as I watched her
growing into such woliderful beauty; I would
think that even then some rurin would see and
love her, would win her deepest love and wile
her fioun me, and a pang of jealousy would dart
through my heart. I strove with this feeling-
I partly conquered it. I grew to look upon Ve-
ronica's future marriage as a certainty, and ac-
customed myself to think of passing my life in
her home as the bachelor brother and uncle-
and of making her children my heirs. And yet
I was very much discontented with this prospect,
and sighed for the past days when we had been
the whole world to each other. Yes I I dreaded
now the longed desired emancipation from school
-.1 dreaded it as the greatest misfortune that
threatened us.
Evil.' that we dread seldom happen to tea.
Years passed slowly enough over our heads-
and every successive yeilr Veronica matured in
beauty, and I loved her with a deeper devotion.
But another change besides maturing of her
loveliness, was coming on her. She grew-not
cold to me, but-indiffirene to me, I bad almost
said uacsrnscious of me. Her beauty was get-
ting a devotional character. Her expression be-
casseelevated, rapt, inspired. She was growing
to resemble some pictures of the Virgin Mery. I

sometimes thought her high style of countenance
inadvertently caught, as it were, from the inces-
sant contemplation of some beatified saint's or
virgin's image. My soul felt darkened and chill-
ed as though she had withdrawn her light and
warmth from me, and was breathing it incense
like to heaven. The time approached fur our
leaving school, which was the period also at
which our guardian would surrender up to us our
patrimony, and we should establish ourselves in
the world. I was totally unprepared for what
happened next. Upon the day we were to have
left the seminary we assembled in the ladies
parlor in the presence of the Lady Superior, the
Chaplain of the institution, our guardian, and an
attorney. There we were to be put in posses.
sion f the title deeds of our patrimony, before
taking leave of our many years' abode. It was
there that I received from the lips of the Lady
Superior the information that say sister had de-
termined to take the veil! I could not, I would
not believe it I I appealed to Veronica herself.
* She confirmed the report of the Lady Superior.
Her answer was conclusive. I was overwhelmed
with affliction. I would not give her up. I said
and did everything I could think of that might
affect her resolution! In vain! I used argu-
ment, persuasion, entreaties, tears! To no pur-
pose! but it seemed,-to fix her determination
more firmly! Let me do others justice also.
The Lady Superior, the sisters, the Chaplain, all
thinking perhaps that her ignorance of life in the
world, and her serene life in the convent might
have unduly biased her inclinations, had tried to
prevail on her at least to delay her purpose for a
few years-to go out and see the world she pro-
posed to abandon before giving it up forever.
They wished, in fact, to take no unfair adv3n-
tage of her ignorance and inexperience. The
arguments and persuasions satisfied their own
ideal of strict justice, but had no sort of effect
upon Veronica's resolution unless, as mine did,
they confirmed her determination. She was in-
fatuated-mad-as the sequel proved. Nearly
frantic with grief I took my leave of Veronica
the same day. Our Chaplain consoled me. He
assured me again that every possible delay
should be made, while every means was used to
test the sincerity of my sister-that there was
little doubt that she, like many others, would
reconsider her resolution- that very few were
the "called, chosen, and faithful" brides of hea-
ven. Again let me be just to the convent. Every
means were in fact used to test the strength of
my sister's resolution, but only with the effect
of settling her more firmly in it. Never was a
new postulant admitted with more caution, for
all seemed to feel her step premature and ,ll con-
sidered. She was kept two years in the convent
as postulant before being permitted to enter upon
her noviciate.

see her face within a grate, and her form swath-

with the white mantle and veil of the order.-
Twelve months from h~r entering upon her novi-
elate, she took the black veil. Let me recall the
day of her
TAKING THE BLACK VEIL.
The Ritual of the assumption by a novice of
the Black Veil, that is to hide forever, the
world from her eyes-the pall that is to cover
forever the brow of the living dead,-is, Jet me
tell you, if you have never seen the august and
solemn ceremony-much more profoundly im-
posing than that of the initiation of a mere pos-
tulant by the reception of the white veil.
For weeks before the important day arrived, a
xumbr of a novice being about to take the black
veil, went all over town and country. The awful
ceremony was, even then, so rare in this country,
that an immense crowd gathered, and from the
earliest hour of its being opened, the chapel was
crowded. I repaired to the chapel slowly and
with a dying heart. I arrived late, and finding
no seat, was forced to take a stand in one of the
aisles near the altar. It was a beautiful, gor-
geous and solemn autumn day-the warm, still,
sun rays, poured richly through the stained glass
of the gothic Windows, flooding the church with
glorious, though mellowed light. Amid the
great crowd, an awful silence reigned-an awful
stillness, too, moved only by the quivering of the
gorgeous, many colored sun rays.
Presently, as before, the door on the right
hand of the altar noiselessly swung open, and a
train of sacristans in robes, entered, preceding
the bishop, priests and deacons, in their canoni-
eels, and followed by the holy brotherhood in
long procession, and took their places within,
before, and about the altar,-the bishop occupy-
ing the centre.
The door on the left now swung noiselessly
* open, and a procession of the holy sisterhood en-
.tered, preceded by a cross-bearer, while the
.e~ioir chanted as before-" Veni Creator."-
* '1'hey ranged themselves quietly and solemnly,

1.'he novice approached from among them, and

intoned from the altar, the solemn 'lEmitte Spi-
uitum tuum," &amp;c., "Send forth thy spirit and
- they shall be created?' while the novice re-

) NPALE.
sponded, "And thou shalt renew the face of the
earth."
Then followed a prayer by the bishop, at the
close of which he blessed the black veil, that
lay near the altar. Then a chant was intoned
alternately by the bishop and the candidate be-
fore him. Next a prayer, at the end of which,
the bishop sprinkled the black veil with holy
water, and in the name of the Blessed Trinity,
at the close of which rite, the gospel for the oc
casion, was chanted by one of the officiating
deacons. The Lady Superior and the Sub-Priox.
ess, then led the novice to the grate, where she
was interrogated as follows, by the bishop
within.
"My child, what do you demand I"
"My father, I most humbly beg, that I may
be received to the holy profession."
"My child, do you consider yourself suffi.
cienti, instructed in what regsrds the vows of
rIigion and the rules and constitutions of this
institute? And do you know the obligations
~ ou contract by the holy profession ?"
"Yes, my father, by the grace of God."
"May God grant you perseverance in your
holy resolution and may He deign in His mercy
to consummate what He has begun. In the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. Ame~~~
After this the organ pealed forth its rich tones,
at regular intervals, announcing the solemn Mass
of the HolyGhost. During all this time the novice
continued kneeling before the altar-the Lady
Superior on her right, the Sub-Prioress on the
lett. At the end of the Mass, several prayers
were offered up, several psalms chanted, and
then the Sub-Prioress,-- taking the lighted taper
from the hands of the novice, laid the act of
profession b4ore her. She arose, took It up,
approached the grate, and holding it in her hartd,
chanted the "vota mea Domini," &amp;c.;-"l will
pay my vows unto the Lord, in the sight of
all His people, in the courts of the house of the
Lord I" Then kneeling again, the Comfiteer
was said, after which, the bishop pronouncing
the "Domine non sum dignus," &amp;c ;-" Lord, I
a~n not worthy that Thou shouldat come under
my roof," approached the grate bearing the
Holy Eucharist, which he held before her while
she thus pronounced her vows-reading-

Then writing her name, and making the sign
of the cross after it with the pen, she passed the
deed to the Lady Superior, who knelt at her
right and.
The most interesting-the most awful moment
of the august ceremonial had now come-the
moment when, having pledged herself to her di-
vine spouse, she was to receive, in return, his
pledge and earnest of mystical union; that in-
stant was arrived, when the bishop, repeating
tue following words, administered to her the
Holy Euchariet,-'. What God has. commenced in
thee, may He Himself perfect, and may our
Lord Jesus Christ preserve thy soul unto life
everlasting. Amen."
Turning from the grate, and kneeling to the
Lady Superior, Veronica received from her hand
the consecrated ring, while the whole choir rang
out again in the "Veni Spousa Christi ;"-
"Come, Spouse of Christ." Veronica then sang
with solemn and touching effect-" Suscipe me,
Domine," three times, in honor of the Blessed
Trinity. Then kneeling, she received the Black
Veil from the Lunhop, who said, while placing it
on her head-
"Receive the holy veil, the emblem of chas-
tity and modesty, which mayest thou carry be-
fore the judgment seat of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that thou mayest have eternal life. Amen."
Then rising from her knees, and standing up,
* holding her lighted taper, the newly professed
nun sang the "Posuit Signum ;"-" He has
placed Hi-s seal upon my forehead," &amp;c. Then
followed the august rite of the bishop's benedic-
tion from the altar-responded to in every
clause by the now kneeling nun. Then was
chanted the "Itegnum Mundi," at the end of
which Veronica prostrated herself, and while

chosen vocation. I grew to think that I was
called to it. I think so still. I grew quiet-

sorrow with which I learned that my sister had
fled her convent, abjured her religion, and mar-
ried! Bowed to the earth with grief and hnmi-
liation, without saying one word to any one as
to the cause of my journey, I suddenly left this
neighborhood and repaired to the convent, to
learn there the particulars of the flight. All
that the Abbess had written was confirmed, and
more was told me. Veronica had fled, and the
companion of her flight was a handsome, gay,
and fascinating man, of high rank, and of irre-
proachable reputation certainly-whom, by the
way, I had sometimes seen in my father's house,
and who, the last year of our stay at home,
when Veronica was about fifteen years of age,
had paid the beautiful child rather marked atten-
tion. How he found access to her again, how
he contrived to wile her away, no one knew.
They were married by special license at one of
the Protestant Churches. He had forced the
sisterhood to give up, or perhaps they had volun-
tarily yielded the considerable property she had
brought to the institution. I learned that he
had taken her home to a small farm in one of the
lower counties of Marl land, that formed an item
of her property, and where they were now living.
I was deeply grieved, but this marriage was be..
yond remedy, of course. I returned in deep
mortification to my pastoral charge. I wrote
many letters to my sister, exhorting her, with
every argument and persuasion in my power, at
least to return to the bosom of the mother

church. I wasted a great deal of controversial
theology upon her, to little or no effect. I never
received an answer; I doubt whether she ever
got my letters; I have much reason to believe
they were intercepted by her husband. Finally,
in despair of ever receiving a response, I ceased
to write to her. Years passed. And then,
thinking that time might have brought some
change favorable to a free communication be-
tween us, I wrote to her again, but received no
answer. A second time I ceased to importune
her with letters. Several years elapsed, and
then came a yearning of the heart for the com-
panion of my childhood, that obliged me to set
out on the long, rough, country journey, to visit
her. I travelled on horseback, and it took me
six days to reach the mouth of the Patuvent,
where her farm lay. I arrived at nightfall, find-
ing there the aged overseer, who had always
farmed the land or my father during his life-
time. The old man, with his aged wife, now
occupied the farm-house. He invited me into
the large, old-fashioned parlor, where his wf~i
received me -~ ith much cordiality. He took my
hat and gloves, laid them aside, gave me the
easiest attn-chair in the cosiest corner of the
ample fireplace, and set a little etand, with a
pitcher of cider and a tumbler, by my side.
Then requesting his old wife to hurry supper, he
drew the other great arm chair to the opposite
corner of the chimney, and sitting down pre-
pared to entertain me if I were inclined to con-
versation. I lost no time in inquiring after my
sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Joy. He
gave me the following facts, which I shall, for
convenience sake, put into my own words.
When Frank Joy first brought his bride home
he furnished the house with much taste and ele-
gance. Her mother's and her father's old friends
-~the most exclusive of the county aristocracy1
flocked around them -the story of her elope-
ment from a convent had preceded them, but in
that Protestant neighborhood, onJy made the
beautiful bride more an object of interest and
~iriosity Great attention was shown them, es-
pecially as her family was one of the oldest and
most extensively connected in the county. On
their pats also, the rites of hospitality were
munificeritly dispensed. A series of elegant
little dinner parties, and very select petits coverss
were given by them. These were more rcchirche' I
than the entertainments of the neighborhood
usually were. They were greatly admired, as
also were the accomplished host and beautiful
hostess This was, or seemed, a very charming
change to the simple recluse, who now found
herself a great. lady (on a small scale), the cen-
tre of an admiring circle ot friends.
A severe winter advanced upon them, how-
ever; the snow was Iwo feet deep on the ground,
the waters of the bay near the shore were crust-
ed, the river was closed, the free interchange of

) N DALE.
visits in the neighborhood was interrupted; la-
dies certainly could not get out in that severe
weather; their visiting was embargoed. Not
so the hospital ities of the Coast House. A suc-
cession of select and elegant oyster suppers and
champagne parties, for gentlemen onlr, replaced
the former entertainments. From these, of
course, Veronica was absent; but Frank Joy,
with all his elegant accomplishments and grace-
ful fascinations, was there in power-and so
those select suppers attracted the elite of
county. Veronica was certainly very much
alone at this time, and would have felt very
lonely doubtless, but that her husband loved, her
sincerely, earnestly, passionately, and that cost-
soled her fully for the loss of all other society.
An event soon occurred, however, that seri-
ously interrupted her happiness.
One night when she had retired to bed at an
unusually late hour, leaving her husband at sup-
per with his friends, she fell into a sweet, deep
sleep, from which she was suddenly aroused by
loud and angry words in high contention. The
excited tones came from the supper-room. She
started in terror from her bed. The chamber
clock struck three. She listened. The voices
grew sharp and fierce in conflict And "Cheat!"
"Swindler!" "GAIWuaxa I!" were the terms of
reproach she heard scornfully coupled with her
husband's name. She did not hear his voice in
denial--smooth, graceful, slippery, and fascina-
ting as a serpent he seemed. She heard his
melodious tones without catching the words.
But a flash of light had fallen on her life, and
revealed many, many obscurities she had not
been able to understand before. Meanwhile the
ugh, arrogant, and overbearing voice was loud
in its epithets of "Gambler! 6lackleg! SHARPFIt !',~
insultingly bestowed upon her handsome and ac-
complished-her beloved Frank I Dressing her-
self quickly, she descended to the supper-room,
threw open the door, and stood pale and trem-
bling within. The voice that had been high,
sharp and fierce in angry and scornful invectives
a moment before, now instantly ceased. With
that cbivalric-nay, with that almost religious
homage which Maryland men, even in moments
of high excitement or intoxication, pay to wo-
men-they all became quiet and ge~illemanly as
soon as Veronica made her momentary appear-
ance among them. Only her Fra'~k moved to-
wards her in his graceful manner, and looking in
her face with a fascinating blending of tender-
ness with command, dreer her arm within his
own, and with gentle force, conducted her frou
the room back into their own chamber.
"Remain here. I will return and explain soon
-soon as I get these infernal fellows-I mean
* gentlemen, away," and he left her.
An instant after she heard his sweet, melodious
voice, defending himself with persuasive but
ignoble eloquence. She had been religiously

~HANN4
brought up-educated in a spiritof love, charity,
and forgiveness-yet! if these charges were false
she would have had her Frank rather thrust them
down the throat of the charger, than plead his
defence in this sweet, melodious tone! and if
tree !-but he loved her dearly, she knew it, she
would ask him! No! she could not do chat
either I Ask him! that would be to insult him;
should she insult him also-she! just after he had
been subjected to so much ~ontumely-no I no!
no! never!
Presently she heard the company disperse
quietly-his eloquence, or their consideration~
for herself, or both had prevailed. Frank trip-
ped lightly up the stairs-entered laughing,
laughing gayly. Oh! how she wished he had
not laughed. Whether true or false the charges
-that laugh was too ignoble then I He crossed
the chamber-threw himself gayly and grace-
fully into a chair, and drew her to his bosom.
"My pet! my soft, my delicate, my trembling
little pet! So they woke you up with their
noise, and terrified you with their violence."
Nothing could be more soothing, snore affec-
tionate than his manner. She replied,
"Well, never mind now. It is all over, dear!
And you are very good, instead of getting an-
gry as some men would, because I came in upon
you then-only to feel sympathy with my wo-
manish tremors. 1 ant not given to such trem-
bling, however; I never was!"
"My darling! I have so much sympathy fQr
these womanish tremors, that if they ever
alarm them again, the brutes I they shall never
come here again! that is all I"
"'Never come here again!' I hope some of
them will never dare! Oh! Frank, keep your
forbearance, your tenderness, for your little
spoded wife-pot for them! resent! punish such
insult, as you forgave to-day !"
"'Resent! punish!' is that the advice given
by my little nun ?" he asked, gently caressing
"Indeed it is, Frankyl I can bear offence my-
self, but I can't endure to see you bear it! I
cannot, indeed, Franky! Oh! please stretch that
man at your feet, with the poker, the very next
time he calls you such names! do, Franky! it is
I, your timorous little wife, who loves you, too,
that asks you to do it, because I can not live to
see you bear insult!"
"What! knock down General 'Hector Mount-
leopard! a man four times my weight, and twice
my age, dear'?"
"'?es! it age don't bring respectability, 1 do
not see why it should be respected !"
"Ab! but suppose in knocking him down with
the poker, I kilt! him, and am hanged for it? how
then ?" asked Frank Joy, with a charming
archness.
"Oh! I never thought of that! I never once
thought of that' ' only thought of the insult

deservitig punishment! I only thought of en.
forcing a respect to my Franky's dignity-"
"Yes, you impulsive little creature! It is
your charming red hair, that makes you so fiery-
tempered! For it is red, you little vixen! Gol-
den, your admirers call it! Yes, but it is red-
gold! Kiss me, darling! and forget all the,
rude brutes that have disgraced themselves and
terrified you, this evening!"
She was soothed, not satisfied. All the next
week there were no suppers. At the end of the
week, a handsome set of jewels arrived from
Baltimore for Veronica. It was with a gay af-
fectionate smile that Frank displayed them be-
fore her. Veronica had, just at this time, an al-
most childish passion for dress; this was, of
course, the greater for its novelty; the re-diction
of her re-nunciatory enthusiasm at the convent.
"The greater the sinner, the greater the saint,"
is a familiar proverb. The converse of that ap-
peared to be tgue in Veronica's case. For a time,
amused by her baubles, she almost ceased to
think of the incident that had troubled her so
much at the supper.
A dinner~party was given, at which, among
other guests, peeredd General Hector Mount-
leopard; but notwithstanding Frank's warning
to her, and his gay and smiling request to her,
to be courteous to all his guests, Veronica met
the General with a freezing hauteur, that with
all his arrogance, seriously discomposed that gen-
tleman's self-possession. At the end of the din-
ner, Frank looked grave and displeased, for the
first time in their married life; and Veronica
was unhappy. For what purpose could Frank
be so servile to an arrogant and purse proud
man, who had grossly insulted him? And why
should a man like General Hector Mountleopard,
appear again at the table of a host whom he had
degraded with such epithets as 'Sharper-Black~
leg'?' But the latter question was more easily
answered. Few, indeed, could resist the fasci-
nations of Frank Joy's sunshiny temper and
sparkling wit; and that singular look of candor
in his broad white open brow-with its cluster-
ing black curls! (Look at Harry's, it is the same
brow!)
Weeks passed, and still the handsome, gay
and alluring man, drew constantly around him
the gentry of the neighborhood. Veronica had a
great concentrativeness of mind. Any impor-
tant idea that once seized her-possessed, ab-
sorbed her. Little things were constantly oc-
curring to feed and keep alive the suspicion ex-
cited by the quarrel at supper. As Winter ad-
vanced towards Spring, she could but observe
that the county ladies neglected her. Proud
and shy she kept at home. Her husband was
amassing large sums of money, she knew-by
what mean4 she did not know. The warm, af-
fectionate, confiding intercourse, that had hith-
erto existed between them, was cooling of. Ij

was not-she felt it-from any declension of love
on either side I it was because some wrong thing
had come between them.
One day Frank Joy had a large dinner-party.
The company sat late over their wine; and then
kept up their revels all night. Veronica did not
sleep at all. The noise assisted her mental
anxiety, and kept her awake. At dawn of day,
the wild, disorderly company broke up. Frank
*   Joy came, gay, laughing, roystering, but sober,
up the stairs. Stopped Veronica's questioning
with a kiss-and began to pack his portmantua
for a journey.
"Why, where are you going, Franky ?"
"To Baltimore, on sudden business," he an-
swered; and the next hour he embarked in a
packet that passed, and was oft sure enough.
She afterwards discovered that the "sudden
business" was the deposit of a large sum of
money in bank, which he did not deem it safe to
keep about the house~ In the course of that day
a carriage rolled into die yard. A venerable
lady, clothed in black, descended from it, and
leaning on the arm of a young fragile girl, tot-
tered feebly towards the bouse.
Veronica, from the windows ~f her sitting-
room, recognized Mrs. Martha Downs and her
grand-daughter-Mrs. Mountleopard, the youth-
ful wife of General Mountleopard. This was
the first visit Veronica had received for many
months; and it took her rather by surprise. She
threw a large thin shawl about her shoulders, and
went down to meet them. They were already
in the parlor. There was a gravity upon the
face of the old lady, a distress upon that of the
young one, that startled Veronica with a vague
presentiment. She went up to them and wel-
comed them, courteously offering her hand. The
old lady gravely withdrew hers, and immediate-
ly opened the subject of her visit. She spoke in
severe terms of their (Frank and Veronica's)
having allured her son-in-law to their house-led
him into intoxication and gambling, and won
large sums of money from him; of his having,
the preceding night, been made drunk, and
swindled out of an immense amount of money.
Shocked and indignant, Veronica's red, "golden
red" hair, fairly bristled with scorn and anger.
And she said it was not to be sup~vosed that she
knew anything about her husband's amusements
among his gentlemen guests-but that it was
very absurd to hint, far less to say that he, who
was almost a boy in years and in thoughtless-
ness, should be able to tempt a veteran sinner
ilke General Mountleopard.
"AhI you think we don't know I You think
we are deceived by your affectation of youthful
simplicity I But we know-all the neighbor-
hood knows that you two are in league! that

house I and the authorities are already advised
of that circumstance. And 1 come to counsel
you to re-fund, and save yourselves from the
vengeance of the law, and my unfortunate son-
in- law from utter ruin I"
Language can ill describe the mixed and blen-
ded emotions of scorn, anger, suspicion, and
shame, that raged in the high spirited woman's
bosom. She grew white. She arose from her
chair, tottered to the corner of the chimney-piece
and pulled the bell rope. A servant entered.
"Show these women out," she said, with cold
and ashen lips, and trembling, left the room.
That night Veronica was prematurely confined
of a dead infant. A fortnight after, when Frank
Joy returned, he found her still dangerously ill.
She recovered.
But neither the loss of their child nor the ex-
treme illness of Veronica, arrested the down-
ward course of the infatuated gambler. If it
were a fact that he drew men to their ruin with
an irresistible fascination-it was also a fatal
truth, that he himself was the charmed victim
of a passion, a fiend who was his tyrant.
I described Veronica as possessing a high
spirit and an ardent temperament, great concen-
tration of mind, and intensity of feeling.. It was
in vain now, that Frank 3oy sought, by his
charming caresses and sparkling aaljies of wit,
to beguile her thoughts and feelings from dwel-
ling on the disgraceful facts rec~tIy confirmed
to her. Perhaps no one, not even her husband-
ahi least of all he-no one but myself, her com-
panion from the cradle, could estimate the vie.
lence of the mortal struggle that now ~onvulsed
her soul-the struggle between her passionate at-
tachment to her husband, and the high uncompro-
mising sense of honor that urged her to oppose,
to the death, all that was evil in his character
and conduct.
He had been to her a sort of oracle-an em-
bodiment of her high ideal of moral and intel-
lectual excellence. It was because he had looked
upon her monastic vow as a superstitious act,
that she had been led to view it in the same
light. That was the infatuation of passion.
But now she discovered, with wbat extreme
anguish of soul, few who did not know her wquld
understand-that her beautiful, her accomplish-
ed, her most excellent one, for whom in' hee~ fond
and blind idolatry she had abandoned her con-
vent and her religion-whom in her madness she
had suffTered to take the place of all intermediRte

THE SECRET CRIME CONTINUED.
Aye! Heiv~'n and e~mh do cr~ ' Thiposeible !"
The shuddering angels 'round the eternal throne,
Veihg eh'-mselves in glory, r-hriek 'impossible!"
But hell doth know it true.
Materin's Bertram.
Many times during the recital of this story the
old man ta~i paused aud rested. Now he stopped
to take anme refreshment, and then strengthened
and calmed by the composing manner of his
young attendant, went on with his story.
There is nothing that strikes me with more
force than the often utter unconsciousness of a
great criminal before the crime, of the terrible
precipice of guilt upon which he stands. "Is
thy servant a dog that he should do this thing ?"
was the honest and indignant question of the
self-ignorant Hazael.; to the wise, far-seeing
prophet. Even so honest would have been the
indignant repudiation echoed from the very heart
of rn-any a criminal, if foretold his crime a week,
a day, sn hour, before its perpetration! Sudden,
unexpected, almost irresistible temptation falls
upon an unprepared soul, passions aroused to
almost maniac fury nearly or quite overwhelm
reason and self-control; such is the history of
most crime. He who was free from crime as
the greater portion of his fellow beings when he
lost his self-possession, finds himself a criminal
at whose deeds a world shudders-tyke he comes
~to himself," and ah! there is nothing on earth
or in hell so wretched ~s his remorse. The les-
son should teach us this n-great pity for the
criminal; strict watchfulness over our own dan-'
gerous passions.
I was one day reading in my small study a
rare old ilumluated volume of the fourteenth
century, that Mrs. Summerfield, during her then
late bridal tour, had picked up at New York, and
just presented to me; my feet were on the hob,
for it was a chilly day in September, just waking
a fire comfortable. I was extremely comforta-
ble in mind and body-little dreaming that I was
then enjoying my very last hour of earthly ease
-that in twenty minutes more the first of a
series of events should occur that should deprive
all my future of peace. Had any one in that
nour of e~sy enjoyment foretold a sudden ca-
ramity of which I should be the victim; a fire
that should consume me; a fall from a horse, or
a carriage that should kill me; a sudden illness
that should carry me off; I should not have been
scornfully incredulous at least; for such things
happen in some part of the world every week-
but !-bad any prophet or angel foretold a sud-
den crime of which Ishould be the perpetrator-
I should have felt like repulsing the prophecy in
the indigpant language of Hazael, "is thy ser-
vant a DOG that he should do this thing ?" Well,

to go on-I was sitting in ease and comparative
innocence, when Mattie came smiling in- she
was a woman of early mid-age then-and laid
upon my reading-desk a letter. I took it. up
carelessly. I had no correspondents of mudi
interest. I started slightly, ho~eever, when 1
noticed the post-mark Green Mdle- the super-
scription was in a strange hand to me. 1 broke
the' seal-and merely read-
CoAsT Housz, near Green Mills, September.
My Only Brother -If possibly you ate yet in
the land of the living, and yet resident at Sacred
Heart, where 1 shall direct this letter, hasten mi-
mediately to
Your only sister in extremity,
VERONICA.
I rode like lightning to Squire Darling's. I
borrowed the swiftest horse in his stables, and
that same night set out for Maryland-I rode as
for life. Oh, no one knows or could ever know
how I loved that long lost twin sister of mine-
my only love from infancy to age. I hurried on
half delirious with joy, expectancy, and-fear!
"Extremity !" what extremity? Extreme ill.
ness-death? Should she be dead when 1 should
reach Coast Rouse? I shuddered and hastened
faster on-perhaps it was only extreme poverty!
That indeed might have been reasonably pre-
dicted from the wild improvident course of their
lives. AhI if poverty were the extremity, how
easy to spare from my own provision enough to
sustain her slender wants-or, had she children?
A hundred thoughts, anxieties, anticipations
rushed through my mind as day and night I hur-
ried on-still blaming myself for an unchristian
loss of self-possession.
1 had nearly killed Squire Darling's valuable
"blood" by the time I reached Green Mills. 1
left him exhausted at the inn and hastened on, on
foot, to Coast House. I knew something of the
present condition of the old homestead from
hearsay-the house nearly ruined-and standing
alone in an acre or so of thistle and weed cover-
ed land-the farm sold and annexed to surround.
ing large plantations-a few squalid huts in
which vegetated a few wretched old negroes,
past service, who were suffered to keep a foot-
hold on their native soil, and gain a meagre living
by trapping small game, fishing, wool picking,
knitting coarse stockings, etc.
That evening! What an evening it was! It
was growing dark, and an army of storm clouds
were mustering in the North-West as I approach-
ed Coast House. I heard the dull booming of
tite bay against the cliffs like the opening of s
cannonading. The naked house loomed large
and black through the dusky night. I clambered
over the broken heaps of stones that had long
ago formed the wall, and with a heavy, heavy
sinking of the heart, went up to the great door
of the formidable looking black front. 1 rapped,
and my rap echoed mournfully-hollowly throng

the vacant and deserted halls. All was dark an
silent-and in the stillness I heard the mutterir
of the coming storm and the booming of the ba'
I rapped again-feeling faint with vague terror-
again the cannonading of the bay against the cli
was the only sound that fearfully broke the s
lence. I turned the handle of the lock an
pushed the door open-it fell with a heavy, lou
clang that aroused all the roaring echoes of tb
cavernous old house. I felt ashamed of th
nervousness that shook me like an ague as
passed on over the fallen door, and opening
side door on the right, went into the room that ha
been the family sitting.room of old. As 1 en
tered, the lurid light of a smouldering fire in th
ample fire-place, revealed the form of an inflrr
woman who had risen from her seat, still holding
on the arm of the chair, supporting her frail forni

"I wait-1 want-is Mrs. -, do yot

The womab was looking at me wistfully-
searchingly-then sinking back in her chair, shi
exclaimed, almost inaudibly,
"My God! my brother."
CC Veronica! oh, no! no! this is not my sis-
ter!"
1 knelt down before her, took her hands, and
gazed intently into her face. I could read there
not one single look of my sister !-the features
were different, the expression was different.
Could this old and haggard woman possibly be
Veronica? I was pierced through with a real
and painful doubt-as kneeling I held her hands
and gazed iWo her face.
"Am I so very much changed, then?" she
asked.
"Changed! You are revolutionized-you are
exchanged if indeed you ever were my sister!
Oh! Veronica! Veronica! my sister! my sister!"
1 dropped m'~ head weeping upon her lap, and
her head fell upon mine, and her arms entwined
me. Whell this was over, I arose and sat by her
side.
"Have you eat any supper ?" she asked.
"No, Veronica, nor have I any appetite to eat."
"Yet you 'must do so," she said, and going to
the old corner cupboard, she took out a little
tea-kettle and filling with water from, a bucket
on a bench, she hung it over the fire and threw
on more chips from a pile near at hand. It seem-
ed indeed as if the sitting-room of the ruinous
old dwelling served t.s parlor, kitchen, scullery,
wood-shed, and for every other purpose.

her lift her hand to serve me.

.e dropped trembling and fainting into the chair,

a "Ah, Veronica,, of all our people i~ there none
d left to wait on you ?"
She smiled.
e "Christie takes care of my little house-keep-
fl ing, but Christie goes to her quarter at night.
g Besides, this evening 1 want you to myself."
L.   She got up and made the tea; put a corn john-
ny cake and a piece of cold roast rabbit on the
~ table, and invited me to sit down. I did so to
r please her, forcing an appetite I did not feel.
"To-morrow if you stay with me you shall
~ have some oysters," she said-" old Tom is
~ going down to the oyster-banks to get some.
~ You never get them where you live up there in
the Virginia mountains-they will be a welcome
old rarity to you."
Oh, it hurt me so to hear her talking of small
paltry comforts for me, while she herself seemed
to try to conceal some great grief that yet her
heart-broken look still betrayed.
"My poor sister, I thank you. But do not
trouble yourself about my eating-it is giving
undue importance to a trifle.~ I shall do well
enough. I am neither invalid nor epicurean."
"Ah! well! perhaps I do give 'undue ira..
portance' to the subject-but then it is habit. I
have been caterer and cook for an epicurean all
my life nearly."
This was the second time Veronica alluded to
this fact. After supper I would not permit her
to wash up the dishes, but pushed the table baek
myself and drew our chairs to the fire, which I
mended and made to blaze brightly, and sat
down I looked inquiringly into Veronica'sfaee.
Up tothis time I had not asked her a question of
her life, nor did 1 intend to trouble her with one,
but resolved to wait until she should voluntarily
confide in me. I did not even know whether
her husband was living or dead; whether, if
living, he were with her; whether they had any
children; or indeed any other fact of her late
married life. She replied to my look of interest
by saying,
"I wrote to you, my brother, under a sure
conviction elf approaching death, in order to con-
fide to your care one charge-the child of my

often to insult. He would not permit me to re-

probably bring another babe into the world to

of harmless emigrants. Many mile. of fatigu-

sleeplessness and exposure, had at last made me

They left me i-n a woodman's cottage, on the

could wrest from the reluctant pockets of his
comrades. He gave me in charge of the wood-

greatest possible care of me, and promising mu-

companion of counterfeiters and blacklegs! it
seemed to me like Heaven to be there-a peace
was falling on my spirit. Strange! though this
was my first parting with Frank, and thouh 1
had always dreaded such a parting above all
things, yet now I did not feel it very painfully;
every painful feeling was lost in a sense of peace
and rest,-a feeling of ceeeation from evil-doing.
Impossible, my brother, to make you or any one
else comprehend who has not experienced it.-.-
After that, I began actually to dread the coming
of Frank, and my forcible re-union with the
band. I began to wish ardently, for some quiet,
secluded place, whore I could give life to my
babe in safety, and rear it in peace-perchance
in goodness.
You know that I was always impulsive, im-
petuous. Well, I formed the sudden resolution
of returning home-returning here. For me to
make a resolve, is to execute it. I wrote a letter
to my husband, explaining my reason for leaving
-packed my trunk-liberally paid the woodirian
and his wife for their care of me, and the day
before Frank was expected to re-pass again on
his way South, I left. I believe our boats passed
each other as I was going up the river, and he
down. Well, I arrived here about six weeks
since. Old Christie and Tom did not at first
know me, but they soon recognized me. I have
not been happy since I came, however; the fore-
shadowing gloom of approaching death darkens
over my spirit-I feel that I shall not survive
my child-I feel so more than ever to-night.-
My brother, promise that you will- stay with me
till all is over. It will not be many days, per-
haps not many hours. -
"I promise, but, dear Veronica, do -not give
way to such mournful thoughts-your first half
of life has been very wretched, that is a sure
earnest that the latter half will be blessed and
happy-no long life is miserable from youth to
age-and yours wilt not be !"
"4' 1 live !-I believe you I-no life was ever
wretched from yo\sth to old age, and mine will
not be-i-f I live-but I shall not live, my bro-
ther I I feel it! Bear with me!"
At that moment a sheet of intense and blinding
lightning flashed forth, filling the scene with in-
* sufferable radiance, fo~owed by a clap of thun-
der, whose report seer~ied to shake the founds.
lions of the earth! The storib that had been
gathering all this time had ntrw broken out with
fury Amid the rattling and rolling of the thun-
der was heard a loud-resounding crash, and a
heavy, continuous, tumbling fall. Some part of
the old building had been struck, and was tutu-
bling down.~ Veronica was pale, but self pos-
sessed. I seized my staff, and ran ~ut to
see the amount of the damage done. A broad
sheet of lightning illumined the landscape, and

the third day. My appearance there (I means
that neighborhood ) was so natural that it cause
no gossip. even in a gossiping community
Frank Joy's sudden arrival and~ sudden disap
pearance, was evidently unknown. I placed m:

again shut up the house, and returned to Sacres
Heart with death! yes! with 4e11 in my Loul

portable library at home, among my books ans
papers, that I realized to the utmost, the terrible
thing that had ~iappene4 tb me. My hair turne

ioners-but they were wide of the truth. Ye
ronica! alas! much as I had loved her! deeply
as under other circumstances 1 should hays
mourned for her! 1 thought not of her now
every affection! every emotion was swallowed
up ir one absorbing remorse! At the end of tw(
years, I went down again into Maryland, an(
brought back with me my little niece, Harriette
whom 1 namedafter our mother, at my sister's
request. I even took Harriette the more as a
satisfaction to the manes of the father, than as
a memorial of love for the mother. Ah! ne
feeling! none! could divide the empire of my
sail with the one possessing, absorbing, consu-
ming remorse r Harriette keeps that alive I-
she has not one look of her mother 1-she has
the very features and complexion of her father!
Frank Joy's countenance laughs out to me from
Hartiette's face. Years7-years of utter misery,
have passed. Purgatory cannot be-hell cannot
be worse than my remorse. Oh! often have I
wished that accident might reveal that guilt
which I lacked the moral courage to confess!
And yet, with strange inconsistency, at the
slightest chance of discovery I would turn sick
with te.rror. In such unutterable sufferings had
passed half a century, when the evil destiny
of the neighborhood sent Sina Hinton here- Un-
til her arrival, I had supposed my dreadful se-
cret confined to my own burning soul. Soon at-
ter her arrival, for purposes best known to her-
self, she particularly sought my acquaintance,
and my ear in every-in every company where
we met- An inexplicable look of Frank Joy in
her face, sickened me from the first.
"Yet she is not at all like Harriette, whom
you assert to be the image of him."
"Both are,.and yet, as you say, they are not at

bereaved mother put this question. Even line-
gene's exalted countenance grew still in a blank
expression almost of despair as she said,

"The Mater Doloroso will be thy support1 my
mother! Think of Ma's' resigning her only, her
spotless, her devoted son to the shameful and
agonizing death of the cross for the sins of
others; bow to the will of Heaven, and thou shalt
be straightened to give up thy erring daughter
to the easy expiation ,of conventuni seclusion
and prayer. You will find a child in every saif.
firing daughter of earth that thou can't succor,
my mother!"
"Ah! Imogene-dost thou think that I can
replace thee so easily? Oh! Imogene, shall I
remain in the world when thou art gone? No,
child, no! I will not forsake my own old mo-
ther! I will cling to her while her earthly life
lasts, but then I too will offer my remaining
days and my great sorrows to God within the
walls of the cloister."
Deeply distressed by the despair expressed
even more in her tones and looks than in her
words, Miss Summerfield turned and silently
pressed her mother to her bosom.
This scene occurred upon the morning of Easter
Sunday, the day set aside for the tissigned pe-
nance of confession. The carriage was waiting
below to take the mo'lhor and daughter to chapel.
They entered it and were driven to Sacred Heart.
It was a glorious Easter Sunday! all nature
was waking up in joy-never was the earth so
green and fresh, the sky so blue and clear, the
sunshine so bright and glancing; never were the
flowers so abundant, so beautiful and fragrant;
never were the birds so numerous, musical and
glad! It was yet very early as they alighted at
the church door and entered Sacred Heart. The
congregation had not yet begun to assemble.
The church was empty. Mrs. Suminerfield took
her seat in her own p.ew, and, Imogene having
embraced her mother, silently left her others to
her private devotion and reverently sought the
Tribunal of Confession, where, by a previous
appointment, sat the young priest of St Joseph's
as spiritual judge. She dared not trust lierceif
to look up at the grave though youthful and
beautiful countenance of her spiritual guide-
but she felt the face of an archangel beaming
down on her. Silently she knelt at the grating,
folded her hands upon her bosom and b6'wed her
head in prayer. Then, without change of pos-
ture, her full rich voice was heard in low tones
pleading-
"Father-I have sinned against Heaven and
before thee! Bless me, father, because 1 ha ~
sinned!"
The fair hands of the young priest were ex-
tended and fell lightly, softly upon the beautiful
and shame bowed head-the radiant countenance
of the young priest shone brightly, warmly over
her, and his harmonious voice responded in tones
of fullest blessing:
"May the Lord be in thy heart and on thy
lips, that thou mayest truly and humbly confess

fictionist would not invent, and dare scarcely copy

SHANN(
thy sins-in the name of the Father, and of the
Son. and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."
Again Miss Summerfield lowly inclined her
head, and in an almost inaudible voice began the
repetition of the penitential words of the comfi-
teer.
"I confess to Almighty God," &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c,
but her voice continued to sink and fall, and her
color to rise-she paused
There Wa. silsi' broken very gently at last
by the encouraging voice of the young priest
saying~ in w tojies,
"My child, you should endeavor to bear in
mind that you are in the presence of God; that
it is to God that in reality you open your heart~
Win the blessing of Heaven upon your confes-
mon by namingftrst the sin, whatever it may be,
that you feel i"ost reluctant to confess-for this
act of se1f~rorq~est and humility will be most
accepable in expiation."
Again Miss Summerfield bowed her head, and
wuemured in nearly inaudible tones,
"[ accuse myself of having broken the first
and greal: commandment. I have had another
god but one. I have given to the creature the
worship due only to the Creator. I have not
loved God above all things. I have borne over-
mu.~h hwe to the creature. 1 have thought ir-
reverently of holy things. I' have despaired of
Gud's mercy."
Again her voice died away in silence, and her
head drooped lower, fell upon her bosom He
waited for her to recover herself, but she re-
mained silent, overwhelmed He reached and
took her hands, folded them between his own,
and in a voice full of commanding tenderness,
said,
"Imogene-name specifically the sin that
troubles thy bosom that I may be able to judge
the state of thy conscience. Can a physician
prescribe who does not know the natur f his
patient's disease and symptoms? Spea4r, Imo-

Ost~rwhelmed with shame her head fell for-
ward upon the grating as in a swoon, but she had
not swooned. Silence fell again between them.
At last-" Hast thou any other thing with

)NDALE                               153
which to accuse thyself, Imogene ?" he inquired,
in a low tone.
"None-none," she murmured.
"Hear me then, Imogene Your greatest
fault has been-a want of fortitude and faith in
God-in your mother and your spiritual guide;
and that moral cowardice and unbelief has caus-
ed your greatest suffering-in leaving your mind
to a dark, a blind, and a false misapprehension
of yourself, of me, and of our circumstances and
duties. Had you cleared your bosom of this
secret from your first discovery of its existence,
you would then have saved yourself and others
all the sorrow that has grown out of it. Will
you look at me, Imogene? You have not raised
your eyes to mine since you kneeled down here.
What is there in my face to alarm you? Will
you look at me, Imogene ~
She raised her eyes and met the calm, clear gaze
of the radiant eyes through which the pure, strong
soul shone so truthfully. She felt that there was
nothing in those eyes or that soul to shrink from.
He took her bands between his own, and gazing
down into her upraised eyes, spoke:
"Can you, Imogene, whenever in the future,'
a sin or a sorrow troubles you-~can you lay that
sin or sorrow on my heart ?'~
"Oh! 1 can-I can as on the bosom of the
Virgin Mother!"
"Can you, Imogene, confide every secret of
your soul to my keeping ?"
"Oh! I can as to the bosoni of my Saviour."
"Will you trust me implicitly with the gui~..
dance of your life? .Will you confide your earth-
ly and immortal welfare to my care 7Y~
"Oh, I will! I will! so trustingly! so confi-
dently! so gladly! even as to my God !"
The young priest folded his hands together and
remained for awhile absorbed in meditation, or in
silent prayer At last stretching forth his hands
as in benediction, he said, in a sweet, but solemn
voice,
"Daughter, I am about to pronounce the abso~
tion and remission of thy sins."
"But~ Holy Father, my penance-my expia-
tion ?" murmured Imogene, very gently-.di~-
dently interrupting him
A singular but inexpressibly sweet, benignant,
and happy smile illumined his features for an in-
stant, and then passed away, leaving oiz ~
countenance an elevated solemnity befitting the
confessional, he replied, with grave tenderness,
"Trve, my penitent-thy expiation-do not
believe that for a single instant I had lost sight
of that necessity; I did but delay thy sentence.
The time, the place, and the manner of thy
penance, I will reveal to thee to-morrow, in thy
mother's house and presence. Thy expiatihit,
Imogene, will be the work of thy whole life;
nay, it will change the whole course and purpose
of thy life; it will affect thy earthly and iminer-
tal destiny~ and that of others through thee.


154                              BRAN!
Thou will find in its course, much of trial; muc
of toil; frequent occasions for self-denial; muc
of suffering for the sake of others, wh'~ may,
their ingratitude, disappoint and grieve thee;
short, much of every sorrow; but thou shalt als
find more of compensation; more of well-earne
comfort and enjoyment; more of gratitude an
love from others; more of heart-felt, soul-fell
social and religious happiness I"
A pause gave Imogene an opportunity of reply
ing.; a certain fervor of emotion impelled her t
reply. She murmured in tones, low, but, oh! s
fbll of earnest feeling,
"I understand thee; I had even anticipate
this manner of expiation. My mother is als
prepared to hear it. We spoke of it this morn
ing. She is resigned. I understand thy dela;
also, and thy soothing, strengthening words
Thou wouldst prepare me; thou wouldat comfort
and strengthen me to hear and bear the door
thou shalt so compassionately pronounce Fea
not for me; it will not be bitter-the fate. I
will be sweets coming from thee. Pear not;
accept it! Only one thing I will plead for-thoi
wilt be present at the ceremonials that shall sea
my destiny-thou wilt if possible-if it may b
permitted.-thyself receive my vows -ehysel
place the veil upon my brow, the ring upon m~
finger?"
"It shall be so, Imogene. I solemnly promise
thee to be present at thy religious espousals-
and, Imogene-" here he took her hands, foldin;
them between his own-" Imogene, look up.'
She raised her eyes to his, that were looking ful
upon her. They gazed into each other's eye
till soul met soul, and then he continued in
tone of sweet solemnity, "And, Imogene, thai
ritual will seal our union for all eternity-dosi
thou believe it I"
"-Oh! I do! I do! I do know it so well-fee
it so deeply. I used those very words to express
t!lat very conviction this morning I"
He looked long into her eyes. and then said,
"1 am about to absolve thee, Imogene I"
She crossed her hands upon her bosom and
bowed her bead in the very devotion of reve-
rence. He extended his palms, which descended
slowly, and fell lightly, softly upon her graceful
head, and said,
"May the Almighty and Merciful Lord give
thee pardon, absolution and remission of thy sins,
and bring thee to life everlasting. May our
Lord and Saviour absolve thee; and by His au-
thority I absolve thee from every bond of ex~
communication, and of interdict as far as I have
power and thou hast need. I, therefore, do ab-
solve thee from all thy sins, in the name of the
Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
May whatsoever food thou. shalt do, or evil thou
shalt suffer, be to thee, unro the remission of thy
sins the increase of grace, and the recompense
of life everlasting. Amen."

qONDALE.
h Re ceased. Imogene remained kneeling in
h silent prayer a moment, and then rising, slowly
n and reverently, but with a peaceful a'd radiant
n countenance, was about to leave the confessional,
o when their eyes met in a long earnest gaze. He
d did not withdraw his-she could not drop or veil
d hers. A strong, an omnipotent attraction seized,
~, maddened, nearly1maseered her! To turn away
from him was not painful, it was agonizing; it
was not difficult, it was deathly-not parting
o from one beloved, but the inevitable, the violent
o rending in two of soul and body. She passed
from the confessional. The light and warmth
d that had hitherto sustained her-the healthful,
o .strengthening and happy influence of the young
priest upon her whole being, seemed abandoned.
y A change slowly, coldly, darkly overslept her
spirit. Never did one going from a genial,
t warmed and lighted home out into the dark
ri night and freezing cold, feel the transition phy.
r sically so slowly, painfully, as she did spiritual-
t ly. She reached her pew dizzy, suffocated, blind,
I swooning nearly, and sinking down in her seat;
ii and without looking at her mother, she dropped
I her head forward upon the front of the pew,
e while her despairing thoughts took something
f like this shape-
~    "I shall see him but twice more in ~py whole
life; to-morrow .vhen he comes, and in his
s sweet, commanding tones, tells me to enter a
- convent; when 1, intoxicated with his presence,
~ and powerless, under his will, shall, with a smile,
hut an illusory smile, accept the destiny, as I
1 did just now. He will then leave me, and I shall
* fall into despair, as 1 do this moment. Years
will pass, and I will vegetate through a loath-
I some life, like that of a rank, aquatic weed, on
the damp walls of some sub-marine dungeon.
Then we shall meet again, and for the last, last
I ti-me. And again, and for the last, last time,
shall come the short lived joy, ecstacy, insanity,
of his presence. When he whom I love so devo-
tedly, who loves me so entirely, will place the
ring upon my finger, the black veil on my brow,
and disappear forever from my view. And then
- -and then-and then I shall sink into a living
death-be inhumed alive! Shall I live? can I
exist, a poor, divided being, in a .living tomb?
AhI yes; for I am the strongest of a strong and
long lived race- We are hard to kill; myself
the most indestructible of the whole. Nothing-
no, nothing but a conflagration, or some other
catastrophe ending in a violent death, can pre-
vent my spending sixty or seventy years of a
living death in the grave of the convent."
strong and fearful reaction was movingwithin
her. Her whole strong heart, soul and intellect,
was in open insurrection Her whole nature
rising in terrible and uncompromising rebellion
against the tyranny and the violence put upon
it. Wave upon wave of passion rolling up from
the deeps of her soul, stormed in her tempestuous

bosom, exciting there wild ann sinful, and frr
kee-, unprecedented thoughts. -
"Is Heaven itself worth purchase at this price,
this awful sacrifice? Alas! I madden! I sin! I
am only good; I am only strong; I am only reli-
gious; 1 only live when Claude is with me, or
when I feel that his spirit is near me-as just
now at the confessional-as sometimes at home.
I am evil; I am weak; I am irreligious; I die
when Claude is absent, and withdraws his
thoughts from me as now! It is not insanity; It
is not falsehood; it is not even fancy; but it is
truth-God's holy truth-that I am but the divi-
ded and quivering moiety of a human being when
separated from Claude's presence, and absent
from his thoughts. I cannot! I cannot! I can-
not- I"
For the first time, perhaps, in all her life,
Imogene, forgetful of - her surroundings, lifted up
her voice and wept! Wept! nay, her whole
soul and body was v;olently convulsed; her
whole nature for the first time passionately re-
belled against her destiny
The mother and daughter were as yet quite
none in the church; but it was to be expected
every instant that some one would come in; that
soon the chapel would fill Mrs Summerfield
especially, fearing such a probable interruption
and observation, stole her arm enitly around her
daiff'ilter's waist, and murmured, in gentle tones,
C Imogene, love, the congregation will be
gathering soon; if you canflot compose yourself
we bad better return home, dear, lest we draw
observation upon us."
"Oh, yes! home-home--let ps go home I"
gasped Irnogene; and they were quietly arising
to leave the pew, when the deep, rica tQnes of
Claude Vellemonte at the pew door, arrested
them. He reached his hand over to Mrs. Sum-
merfield to shake hands wito her. The mother's
brow crimsoned for an instant at the sight of the
young priest, until she met his eyes, so full of
strength and purity, when her agitation subsided.
The storm in Imogene's bosom was also stillefl
The magnetic, the fabled miracidqus power of
Claude Vellemonte was once more felt by both
mother and daughter, as he stooped over the lat-
ter and said,
"Imogene, what Is the matter? Compose
thyself, my dear child. Before and above all
things, believe in thy Father's love. - He who
created thee, loves thee, Jipogene; desires thy
happiness; believe and receive this, for it is
true; hear His words ' Verily I say unto you,
there is no man hath left house, or brethren, or
sister, or father, or mother, or wife, or children,
or land, for my sake and the gospel's,
1c 'But shall receive an hundred fold ~ew us
ThUS viwn-houses, and brethren, and sisters, and
mothers, and children, and lands, with persecu-
tions---and in the "vorld r0 come eternal life.' Thus
you see, Imogesie, 'Godliness is profitable in all

16&amp;5

things, having the promise of THIS r~rrz, and of the
life to come' But, lmogen~, to avail thyself of
Gospel promises, thou must believe in and $
se.pon thess. Imogene, repose on tne promises.
Be believing- Be calm. Be cheerful Have~ a
modest confidence us the mercy of thy Divine
Parent. Remain here, Imogene- 1 will see thee
again to-morrow-" He stroked her brow gently,
and was gone.
That day the young priest took for his text the
Scripture: "Whoever will lose his life for My
sake and the kingdom of Heaven's, shall save
it." His text and sermon were singularly ap-
propriate to Easter Sunday, the morning cele-
brating the Resurrection of our Saviour from the
dead; and as singularly appropriate to the state
of at least one of his hearers. He spoke of the
Saviour's voluntary resignation of His life. Of
the anguish, the terror, and the failing, dying
faith of His disciples, as they witnessed His
arrest, His trial, execution, and burial. Of the
deep, the utter despair that followed that event.
He dwelt upon this picture so earnestly, so ole-
quently, that even his hearers were cari'ied back,
in imagination, eighteen hundred years, and felt
that all hope had gone down with the Saviour to
the grave. Then as he turned sunward to the
glorious morning of the resurrection, his whole
countenance was transfigured before them, and
beamed with an archangelic radiance and powe
as he depicted that startling, that electrifying
denouement. The surprise, the joy, the ecstasy
of the disciples, in hailing again their risen and
glorified Lord and Saviour, now proven Lord and
Saviour beyond the shadow of a doubt! their re-
newed and strengthened faith, renewed and
strengthened, for all eternity. Finally he drew
from this a consolation for all christiaps tempted
to despair. Their buried bye and hope, buried,
forever, in their thoughts, would rise again!
would rise in joy! in glory! and surprise them
into an ecatacy of gratitude and worship! *
But 1 feel that in giving this third-hand re-
port of Claude Vellemonte's inspired and most
eloquent Easter Sunday sermon, I am doing him
injustice. Very weakly do his great, strong
words,-very coldly do his fiery words, flow
through my feeble pen. In fine, there waa more
than one soul raised, comforted and strengthened
that day!
At the close of the services, Claude Velle-
monte announced that Father Burleigh had re-
covered his health, and expected, with the bless.
ing of Heaven, to resume his place in the
pulpit upon the next Sunday- That in conse-
quence of that and other circumstances, which
would be duly made known to them, his own
*hort and delightful connection with the congre-
gation of the Sacred Heart Chapel would ~d
with the services of that afterr.don, wben l~e
should take an affectionate and a final leave 9
his beloved charge. Thie.circuxnatance, in the


156
event of Father Burleigh's recovery, was to
natural and too much to be expected, to cause
any surprise how much aoever of regret it might
and did occasion. The congregation was then
dismissed. The mother and daughter returned
home. Imogene, at least calm, if not happy.

Mrs. Summerfield with difficulty subdued her

She used every moral and material means within
her reach, to compose her violently excited
nervous system, and finally succeeded in getting
her to bed av.d 'ullin~ hsr to sleep. There was

).ND ALE.
ono sleep, however, for Mrs. Summerfield. The
lady paced slowly up and down t~e gorgeous but
dimly lighted chamber of her daughter, think-
ing, with deep anxiety, of all the cases of insa-
nity she had heard of, arising from religious fa-
naticism, where it conflicted violently with
some natural law of our being. Then she passed
in review the whole history of Imogene's life,
since her return hoi~e, and all that she had re-
vealed of her life at school. The visions of her
illness, it is true, were probably merely the tem-
porary effect of virulent fever; but the visions
of her convalescence were a more alarming
matter. And after her arrival at home, her
profound melancholy even deepening to gloom;
her days of depression, her nights of elevation;
and what was still more dreadful, her violent,
opposite and inconceivable alternations of mood,
within the last few weeks; being at one hour so
deeply despairing, at another exalted into such
a beavei~ of rehgioos ec.sta~.y, and anon, so in-
effably serene; all these things presented them-
selves to the mother's mind in a new and terri-
ble light.
Yes, yes, wounded affections, violated natural
laws, religious fanaticism, were taking a terrible
vengeance upon their subject, in doing this work
of mental destruction upon Imogene. Her over-
burdened and over-wrought heart and brain were
desperately struggling for existence amid the
horrors of this furious moral typhoon, and her
glorious intellect in imminent danger of ship-
wreck amid the metaphysical breakers a' ound her.
Now, perhaps, for the first time in Mrs. Sum-
merfield's life, a doubt of the righteousness of
that ecclesiastical doctrine by which her daugh-
t~-r was made to suffer such extremity of an-
guish, remorse and humiliation, which would
eventuate assuredly in confl.rmed madness, arose
in the mother's mind; but it was immediately
suppressed as sinful.
Not so easily, however, were her too well
grounded fears for Imogene subdued. Nothing
but the common life would restore Imogene to
sound health of mi"d and body People were
not created with five senses, and put 'pon ttiis
solid earth, covered, as it is, with material beau-
ties and pleasures, to lose their sense in spiritual
abstraction, any more than to degrade them in
excessive luxury. The medium! the medium!
There was right-there was wisdom. IVI . Sims'.
merfield nowfelt this, but, for her immo~tat soul's
salvation, she dared not thin&amp; it out! So she
sighed and groaned, and paced up and down the
gorgeous chamber, till at length she went and
prostrated herself before the image of the Virgin,
on the elegant little altar we have described be-
fore. Here, in silent prayer and meditation, she
spent the remaining hours of the night. Mean-
while, from the united effects of mental and phy-
sical exhaustion and of an opiate, Miss Summer.

chain of lofty mountains shutting in the whole
scene.
A servant entered, and placing a card in Miss
Summerfield's hand, retired. She read it indo-
lently, without at first taking in its meaning.
She looked at it again, and grew pale as she read
the namt~ engraved on it aloud-" MONS. Lz
Duo LIz VELLEHONTE What does this mean?"
She looked up, and Claude Vellemonte stood be-
fore her; or, was this indeed the young priest of
St. Joseph's? No! for the priestly garb was
gone-and this gentleman wore a quiet citizen's
dress of speckless black.-.and yet, indeed, it was
Claude Vellemonte, and not another, who, ad-
vancing, now, and replying to her question, be-
gan to say,
"it means, my dear Imogene~-.~~
But before he Went any farther, he sat down
an the sofa beside her, passed his arm around
~her waist, and drawing her head upon his bosom,
bent and pressed his lips to hers in the very
first, virgin kiss he had ever given woman! or
she had ever received from man I It was a life-
giving kiss to both! and he gazed down in her
radiant eyes with a smile of pure ecstatic joy,
lighting another smile in her face, such as only
children or angels wear!
And she! Was she shocked, alarmed-was
she even surprised at this sudden, this unprece-
* dented joy? or, seas it unprecedented? No! for
even thus they had often met in the spiritual land,
in dreams, that seemed as real as this! No! It
seemed so right, so natural, or rather, every
thought and emotion was swallowed up in a feel-
ing of measureless content, as she lay there in
the pure .srms of her spotless, her almost divine
lover-as she lay there, lost In a trance of joy.
Nor one word of explanation had been spoken-
yet* she was so naturally, so inexpressibly hap-
py! While Claude dazed down upon her, his
radiant eyes showering blessings, and more di-
vinely blessed himself in the sense of giving,
than of receiving happiness. At last he mur-
mured lowly under his breath,
"You beautiful and happy child! Oh, to hold
you tiuts! It is even more of Heaven than my
visi ins promised---to have your head lying here,
where in dreams only it has ever laid! Ah, rest
your head here, on my bosom, where it has so
long ached to rest I where I have so much longed
to have it! You darling! you good! you beau-

*   "My dream-lover !"
"My measureless content! Oh, Imogene!
Imogene I,' he murmured, hovering over her
lips again, lighting softly on them.
"You thought of me all this time! You
loved me all this time-and Claude, I always
knew it!',
"Always! Always! Imogene, I was with
you in niy dreams! By day, 1 would conscien-
tious!y dismiss you-but 'sleep has its own
world,' governed by its own laws-there 1 ever
found you again."
"You were ever with me in your dreams ?"
"Ever-ever, Imogene I"
"I knew and felt it! My days were wretch-
ed; but my nights were unutterably happx !"
"My beautiful embodied dream. Mv happy

Long glossy purple locks! majestic brow, and

grew fo hers again!
"Mr. Vellemonte!!! Father Vellemonto ! !!!
I am HONORED! ASTOUNDED I" exA~laimed the
voice of Mrs Summerfield, who at this '~ritic.si
moment appeared, and was struck still in the
door, like a statue of horrified astonishment in its
niche; "Mr. VellArionte Father V~-llemonte, I
my! you horrify me beyond measure! In the

"Oh! my dream bride! my beautiful embo-

man, straining her again and again to his beom,
and pressing fervent kisses on her brow and
eyes and lips, in the very ecstacy of rapture!
"My God! 1 shall presently madden! Imo-

claimed the deeply scandalized lady, in the en-
tremity of distress.
"Ak, Claude! my archangel! when did I die?

of joy.
"FATHER VHI.rziworsTn, release my daughter,

wards them.
Claud~e now looked up-did he drop Imogene?

feet, he wouPi not have dropped h~r theii I Re

closer to his bosom, before he answered, entire-
ly at random, an observation whose sound he
had only beard.
"Yes, madam, certainly!"
"You shameless man!" cried the excited
lady, in a choking voice. /
A sense of the absurdity of the whole thing,
now struck Claude, who, with the first inclina-
tion for humor that had visited him for many a
day, now arose, and setting Imogene upon her
feet, presented her to her mother, and said,
"Mrs. Summerfield, let me crave your con-
gratulations fo-r my betrothed wife-Madame La
Duchesse De Vellemonte !"
Tue lady had been very red before, she now
grew deadly white-a look of unutterable sor-
row chased every expression of anger from her
face, and gazing on them both wit~h profound
pity, she said, in a voice full of grief-
"Ah, my God! 1 see it all now! God knows
that they have both gone mad!"
Srn.itten~with compunction for the pain he had
given her, Claude Vellenionte took her hand in
the most respeetfnl manner, and said-
"Mrs. - Summerfield 1-mother-my honored
mother! I am neither mad nor guilty, iwr is
yovr daughter, whose faith in me, was to her--
~nowiedge. What I say to you, only requires
your consent and blessing, to make it truth!
You knew before that I was the son of the ban-
ished Duke De Vellemonte, who, during the
.Reignof Terror, became a refugee in this con;-
try, an I died at St Joseph's; you know that I
obeyed his dying will rather than followed my
own vocation, in entering the priesthood; you
know he chose this life for me because he thought
the patrimonial title and estate forever gone;
and because his last days were characterized by
extreme religious dev&amp;ion. Three years ago I
fouWd that I loved Imogene too well to make a
good priest. I struggled desperately with this
feeling, until I discovered that Imo~eire loved
me. I struggled with it then no longer, but, 83
I was yet scarcely entered upon my clerical du-
ties, I wrote to Rome a history of the whole
matter, praying our Moft Holy Father a'dispensa-
tion. from. my vows, but leaving my destiny en-
tirely in his hands, expressing the fullest dis.
position to resign myself to his wi!l. While
I was making this appeal from America,. some
of wy father's old friends, who had gained the
high favor of the Emperor, remembered the
exiled son of their banished friend, and exerted
their interest for me. The end of both their ~n-
tercession and my petition was, that six weeks
ago two packets arrived for me, one from Paris,
containingdispatchesthatre-investedmewith my
late father's title and eStates, and recalledzne to
Paris; and the other, comprising a dispensation
from my priestly vows-that dispensation to
take effect after vesper hour on Easter~Sunday
evening."

tgg

Then, turning to Miss Summerfield, he said-
"Imogene, my child: di'! I anticipate the date
of this dispensation by~n hour?- did I not
faithfully pay the uttermost farthing ot my duty,
even in the trial of hearing thy enforced and ex-
piatory confession? Did I ever, by word or
look, offend thee? I heard thy confession, line-.
gene, because, my child, my approaching dis-
pensation did not wipe from thy soul the sin of
sacrilege you committed in loving a priest-and
because that penance was laid upon thee by thy
Father Confessor, and obedience to thy spiritual
guide, was necessary. When I absolved thee of
thy sin, Imogene, I could not assure to thee a
compensation for thy sufferings, for that would
have then been a breach of the vows which
bound me until evening. But when 1 saw thee
so meekly resigned to give up all the pleasures
of the earth, and in the seclusion of the convent
expiate thy error by devoting thyself to God-
I could and did say, in the words of Christ-
'Verily I say unto thee that no man hath left
house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mo-
ther, or wife, or children, or lands for my sake,
and the gospel's; but he shal! receive an hun-
dred fold now in THIS TIME--houses, and bre.-
thren, s.nd sisters, and mothers, and children,
and lands with persecutions; and in the world
to come, eternal life!' But oh! thou faithless
and despairing child, thou did'st not bind it to
thy bleeding heart. It was my faith, my Izn6-
gene, that saved thee. Ah, Imogene's mot'ier!
I have a vocation for the priesthood !- Heaven
doth truly know that 1 have! But not for ice
necessary celibacy-I have too large a human
hear!; for that-and had this great tide of nato-
ral affections been turned back upon my heart,
it would have become a burning and cenautwug
fire, that would have dried up all the' milk, of
human kindness in my nature; all the blocd in
my veins; all the flesh on my bones; and this
fine, vital temperament of mine, thai. enables
.me to do so much for others more feeble-would
have changed. In body I should have grown
bilious, sallow, thin, and leathery; and the ruin
of mind and soul would have been still greater.
I should have become bigoted, fanatical, asee.-
tic, harsh, given to persecution. Those few
cruel priests whom history records as standing
reproaches to the holy mother church, were con-
scientious men, of ardent temperaments, whose
strong natural affections, turned back from theu~
natural course upon the heart and brain, becatna
furious fires, exciting them to deeds of cruelty;
for such men must -~rv, must feel their i4ij~ if
not in human loves, why then in human, Or
thor, in fiendish hates, and in the excitet2i~
that scenes of blood afford!. History has dealt
severely with them, because philosol~hy ha not
revealed them. No, Mrs. Summerfie!d, all mez~

WINNY.
Courage !-you travel through a darkeome cave,
But still as nearer to the light you draw,
Fre4 galee will meet you from the upper air,
Ai~d wholesome dews of heaven your forehead lave,
And darkness lighten more, till full of awe,
You stand in the open sunshine, unaware.
R. C Frenck.
Winny Ardenne I-have you lost sight of that
gentle sufferer, reader ?-is she forgotten, be-
cause, in the noise of violent and conflicting
passions, and the shock of sudden and tragic
events, the still music of her gentle life is tin-
heard? She is not forgotten by any one near
her. Mrs. Summerfield, amid her heavy domes-
tic trials, and Imogene, in her suffering, had still
fopo$ ioom in their hearts for Winny. The old
lady, who, now that her affections were satisfied
with the presence of her "baby," had fallen into
that still, smiling, blissful dotage, beautifully
termed "second childhood," that state which
is neither quite of earth, nor quite of heaven, but
seems a happy lingering of the soul between
hotly --that loving, lovely close of a long and
good earthly career, which is not death, but an
easy, gentle~ translation of the soul to God-the
old lady was Winny's constant companion.
Those three children, 1 mean grandmother,
Wiuny, and baby, occupied one room at Red-
Stone, and Gelly waited on them. Claude Vel-
lemonte often came to visit and cheer them. In
Winny, indeed, he found a special object for his
life giving mission, and he devoted himself to
her with all his cheerful and hearty faith, hope,
and charity. Perhaps no one in the world be-
sides Claude Vellemonte, could have "minister-
~ so successfully to this heart and "mind dim.
eased." He had awakened Winny's dormant re-
ligious affections, strengthened her faith, and re-
vived her hopes; and with that great hygeiange-
fame, whose possession had acquired for him,
:~a~iong his more simple-minded parishioners, the

his own fair creed."
When Claude Velletuonte had succeeded in
scattering that burning spot in Winny's breast,
left by the old wound-when he had raised her
spirits, and she was no longer suffering fron
pain, or "numbed" by despair, he told her that
she must return to her father's house, and take
her station daily by his sick bed; and Winny,
who ever obeyed his voice, as though her Ba.
viour had spoken by his lips, got into a carriage
with her grandmother and her baby, and made
old Nerve "burst out a-crying" with joy, by
getting out of it at the door of Oak Grove Hall.
Claude Vellemonte had more than one good rea-
son for directing this move, to explain which, I
must go back a little.
It had not been deemed safe by his physicians
to inform Squire Darling of the fate of Sina for
som: we4s, although for many reasons, known
only to himself, he seemed darkly to suspect it.
When at last the manner of her da~ath Was made
known to him, he received the news very quiet-
ly, merely saying, to himself-" Yee-yes-yes
-yes-insanity was hereditary in one branch
of her mother's family-her uncle died in the
lunatic asylum, and one of her aunts died of a
brain fever!" Then he turned his face to the
wall, and spoke no more for hours. All that
day and night he refused both food and drink,
and from that time he sank into deep gloom.
"Shall I never, never be happy again ?" said
the miserable man, as he tossed and tumbled
about, among the bed clothes and pillows.*
Old Nerve, who was sitting c9mfortably in a
large, soft arm-chair, before th&amp; fire, in her ca-
pacity o~ nurse, and occupying herself with
toasting her fat feet, and looking atthe pictures
in a splendidly bound Bible-a copy utterly for-
bidden to vulgar fingers, on account of its splen-
dor-now turned her head, and took u long, ex-
ceedingly self-complacent look at her master.
"Shall I never, never see another happy
day ?" groaned the now feverish and excited
man.
"Never, sarI never! sartain as you're a libin'
sinner, 'til you 'solves that farm, as I telled you
'fore !-'til you 'solves that farm o' Debil Dar-
lin' &amp; Compiny. The 'Compiny' o' the farm is
gone, praised be, my blessed 'Deerner I.-. and
that ought for to be a~warnin' to you."
"Who spoke to you, you in-" faltered the
squire, checking, for the first time in hijlife, a
profane-word upon his tongue.
"Nobody didn't ear, chile, but the spent o'
the Lord, an' 'Woe is me if I preaches i~ot the

"Oh, oh, oh!,' groaned the poor man, tossing
about his arms.
"Yes, honey!' I hopes you's groanin' for your
sinr-'deed I does."
"Oh! oh! oh!"
"Yes, chile, that's right! I hopes you's 'eider-
in' now how you's made other people groan-

"You infernal-oh! oh!"
C(Ah, Lord, see that, now! when i'm a-pro-

power; he done stretch out there, an' 'bilge

year to it all his life before. An' I gwine give
it to him good !" said Nerve, in a tone of
determination, being-in the full knowledge that
her master was entirely in her power-wonder-
fully strengthened to preach the Gospel. "Don't
you know, you poor ole sinner, as he who 'fends
one of the Lord's little ones, had better have a
maelstrome strung around his neck, and be hang
ed to the top o' the trees? an' ain't .1 one

Ain't this here persecution ?"
Here g pillow Was launched at her head from
the hands of the enraged squir-e,.who instantly
fell back, exhausted with the effort. Nerve
tos-aod up the whites of her eyes, and, crossing
herself devoutIy~ejaculated~
"Oh, may the Lord 'give this poor ole forsok

"I'll-oh! oh! i'll-" groaned the highly

"Well, do, honey! Yes, ole master, do heave

yelled old Nerve, in the strong grasp ot the
fever-maddened man, who with the new and ter-
rible strength of delirium, had suddenly sprung
from his bed, dragging the sheets behind him,
and seized his tormentor by the nape of her neck.
"Ah-r.r-r-r-r-r-rf f!!'~ yelled Nerves once more
extricating herself an instant from his strange.
ling fingers. "Oh! praised be my 'Vine Mars-
ter. Mr. Vellemonte! is you comed at last,"
exclaimed phe, running for shelter into the arms
of Claude Vellemonte, who had just then hurried
into the room at the .sound of shrieks; "he's!

"Wocation! yes-thanky, sir! yes-i'll re-
memberize it!"
"You must remember also, not rashly to han-
die holy things, as you do. Nerve, you are a well-
meaning woman, if we except a Blight vein of
sly malice; and a sensible one, barring an over-
weening self-esteem; but you have certainly,
nearly killed your master to-day, by preaching
out of time and place. 'There is a time for all
things,' said the wise man; and the truth is to be
spoken 'in love,' said the apostle."
"Yes, sir."
"Now, if you will promise never more to
speak until I give you leave, I will, on my side,
promise, that before the year is out, you and
Kill shall be free, with a little house, well fur-
nished, and a little plot of ground, with a horse,
a cow, pigs, and some poultry."
The result of this affair, was, that Claude
Vellemonte, on returning to Red-Stone Hall, had
first sent Winny, now somewhat recovered, to
Oak Grove; and then going to Sacred Heart, had
dispatched Harriet Joy as general protector.
But Claude Vellemonte had more than one mo-
tive for sending Winny to her father, for though
it was certain that the fecble-one could do no-
thing in the way of nursing him or even sit by
his bedside for any great length of time together,
yet her attendance there was a duty, and her
mere presence bad a salutary effect upon the
health of the invalid, and exercised a softening
and redeeming influence upon the heart of the
father. We know that when he first saw Winny
after her illness his heart had melted, and his
tears had fallen at the sight of his suffering
child; that he might then have been led to re-
pent his harshness, had his thoughts not soon
been monopolized by the corroding jealousies and
anxieties of his absorbing passion for Sinai and
his judgment been unduly influenced by that
wily girl, who knew, even amid their fierce
quarrels, how to turn his anger against Edgm~
Ardenne, whom she ever artfully presented to
him as a heartless adventurer, who had specula-
ted upon his daughter's affections and his own
wealth and influence. And ~our honest squire,
who had less keenness of perception than via.
len~e of temper and stubbornness of will, con-
tinued to act upon that view~ of the case up to
the time of the catastrophe. But now, under
the influen~.e of the discipline of Sina Hinton's
awful death, and his own prolonged illness, could
he lay there on his bed of slow convalescence,
and not be led to deen reflection on the past, or
could he turn his eyes to where his daughter sat
In her arm-~hair by his bedside and see his pale,
suffering, but uncomplaining child, heart-broken
by his own harshness, and not wish to bind up
that broken heart, and, if possible, to give it
happiness?

How quiet it was in the sick room on Easter
Tuesday morning. A small, bright fire was
burning in the grate at the same time that-for
the weather was dry, clear and pleasant-the
windows were slightly raised and the blinds
partly open to let in the fresh and "sunny air."
They had done breakfast and the room was
made very tidy and cheerful, and the now rapid
ly recovering invalid, newly shaved and refiosh.
ed, sat in bed propped up with pillows. The old
lady placidly smiling to herself, reposed in an
easy chair by the fire. While Winny sat by hex
father's bedside with her baby sleeping on her
lap, as though she had forgotten to lay it down;
she was looking at her baby in a pensive, half-
abstracted manner. ~he was silent, patient and
serene as ever, she had fallen into one of her
reveries, and did not know that her father's
eyes, full of mournful affection, were gazing on
her. Her thoughts were far away. He leaned
over and supporting his head upon his hand,
while he rested on his elbow, fttretchied his
other hand out, and laying it affectionately on
her pale, golden hair, said,
"Winny, my child f"
She looked up.
"What are you thinking of, my dear child 1"
She dropped her eyelids, and two large tears
rolled slowly down her cheeks.
"Winny, my child, have you ever heard from
Edgar since he went away ?"
Now the tears streamed.
t~Say, Winny f-I have a reason for asking
you, my love."
A suffocating sob of-.--
"No-never-never once," was the almost
unintelligible answer.
"Did you love him so dearly then, Winny ?"
Her sobs grew now hysterical-she leaned her
face down upon the side of the bed.
"Don't cry, Winny, my dear, don't cry!"
But Winny sobbed the more.
"Don't cry, Winny, don't! Affairs are not so
desperate as you think may-be, child! Don't
cry so much 1"
"Father I-let mo-it is thefirst time-I've

sled ~ tear-since he went away! You calle
him 'Edgar'-kindly-and that-that-touche
my heart-and-and-let me cry!" sobbed Win
ny, convulsivelywhile the poor father, who couli
not guess the good this great thaw of congeale
tears was doing her-fretted and fumed. As sooi
as Winny could speak she commenced again, an
bet~oeen broken sobs said,
"Father! forgive-not Atm, for he was not t~
blame, but-in., for It was my fault! 1 lovec
him so much, so much, so much, father I-fa-
ther, forgive me-bless and dismiss me, that
may go and seek him!"
"Seek him, poor child, do you know where he
is 1"
"No, father, but God will lead me to him!"
")!ou! you, poor, thin, pale thing, that pani
when you come up stairs."
"God will strengthen me, father! Give me
your blessing and let me go I"
"Wouldn't it be better to bring Edgar back
here ?"
"AhI father, if you would-if you would-
you would make me 50,50 happy! but, oh! fa-
ther! how will you find out where he is ?"
"1 know where he is !"
"You, father! you know where he is I Oh!
father, if you do indeed, for the blessed loving
*    Saviour's sake, tell me! tell me!"
"He is in the wilds of the North-West Terri-
tory, living a hunter's life."
"And you will bring him back? Oh, father,
you will make your only child happy! you will
bring him back!"
"1 do not know, my child, just yet, I'll see !"
replied the squire, who found magnanimity a
new and exceedingly difficult lesson to practice.
"Oh I father, you have my life and death in
your hands-give me life I"
"Winny, my child, hope ali things-this I
will tel! you for your comfort. I t~ok you from
Pine Cliffs and permitted Edgar Ardenne to leave
the State, broken-hearted, because I was justly
incensed against you both, and wished to punish
you both, as well as to try kim-to test his fideli-
ty and integrity. I wasn't sure he was alto-
gether evil. Though I disliked him so much,
that I cared not the toss up of a penny whether
he stood the test or not, yet in the event of his
standing it, I was full determined to bring him
back to you. I was compelled to be silent as
the grave about it, and even act a malignity 1
did not always feel, in order to blind people to
my thoughts, and give my test a fair chance to
work. W ll, I never lost sight (morally speak-
ing) of Edgar Ardenne for one hour after he left
here, or for one hour since-you know who left
in his company.
"No, sir."
"Willie Smiie, Hettie's cousin, and 1 wrote to
him, and have been in secret correspondence
with him ever since."

O NDALE.
f "Oh, father!' -
"It is absolutely necessary, my dear! A pen.
- niless man who carries off an heiress is an object
I of suspicion, and must be submitted to a severe
I test before confidence may be safely reposed in
him. Well !~ 1 am happy for your sake, Winny,
I to say that As has stood the teat-he has been
true even to the severe condition that obliged
him not to seek a re-union with you."
"Father, father! ~,iou compelled him to make
- that promise?"
"Yes! and then 1 was in earnest-my mote
merciful thought was an after thought. Well,
Winny, he has stood the severe test, and so, as
the devil himself can't unmake him your hus. -
band, the father of my grandchild,, and my own
son-in-law-perhaps-mind, I say perAGpa- I'll
some day write for him to come home."
"And 1, father, will never cease to pray you
to do so until 1 see my prayers of no avail, and
- then, with my baby in my arms, I will go and
seek him."
While tbis scene was taking place above stairs,
another was transpiring below. "Monsieur Le
Duc De Vellemonte" had ridden over to Oak
Grove, and asked for Harriette Joy, who still
remained there as a temporary acting mistress
of the house. The news of his change of cir-
cumstances had preceded him in a note carried
by a messenger from Red-Stone, who, every
morning, was dispatched to inquire after the
squire's amendment.
Claude De Vellemonte was closeted with Har-
riette Joy, and his manner was very serious and
her eyes were red with weeping. He had been
confiding to her Sina's whole secret history.-
When he had finished, he said,
"And now, knowing that when we bad sup-
posed him to be getting well, the news of Miss
Hinton's fate threw him back so dangerously, I
have been, up to this time, fearful of opening up
the subject to Squire Darling again; fraught
with so much pain as the story of her perfidy
must be. Still, in justice and in mercy to Winny
and Edgar Ardenne, he ought very quickly to
know how those children were betrayed into
marriage byanother~s artful misrepresentations."
"You may tell him with safety now, I think;
at least it is not right longer to delay," said
Harriette, wiping her eyes, and resuming her
cheerfulness. "I will go up~and inform him that
you are here."
And she went.
"Yes," said Squire Darling, "let him come
in!" and soon after, Claude entered the sick
chamber.
"I suppose 1 may be permitted to congratulate
you upon the happy change in your circumstan-
ces, Monsieur Le D;mc De Vellemonte," said the
squire, gruffly iii tbA.tone 'f-"l s'pose you

SHANNO;
think yourself a very importantpersonage-who
the d-l gave you leave to be any happier than
any body else ?"
"Thank you, squire. Wish me joy of a hap-
pier coming event-my approaching union with
your niece, Miss Su~nmerfield."
"Ah, indeed! When is that to come off 1"
"Our marriage is delayed by circumstances
over which you yourself have the greatest con-
trol. Your own restoration to health, and-par-
don me-the re-union of Winny and Edgar Ar-
"Father Vellemonte I-I beg your forgiveness,
Monsieur Le Duc-I am not-because I happen
to have been ill-grown feeble as a child, to be
tutored by all around me I" said the squire, in
an irritated tone; for like all other rather weak-
minded persons, he was very much afraid of ha-
ving it supposed that he could be influenced.
"1 do not presume to wish to tutor you, my
good sir; 1 have only certain revelations to make
that will throw a new light upon that affair of
the elopement."
"Revelations! Humph!it seems to me that
you have become a book of Revelations 1"
"Are you strong enough to hear a somewhat
tedious story V'
"Don't know, indeed, Father Vellemonte-
beg your pardon, Monsieur Le Duc 1"
"I will make it short as possible, then," said
Claude, with unruffled serenity, and forthwith
commenced giving him the whole history of the
runaway match.
Squire Darling listened with unusual self-
command, only ejaculating "Humph I" and
"Ah I" at certain points. He showed not
much pain at the discovery of Miss Hinton's
perfidy; for, in reality, his quandom passion for
Sina was of that nature which required the pre-
tence of its object to -excite it; and now, be.
tween the loss of her presence and his own ill-
ness, it became to him only as the memory of a
severe fever. He listened to this secret history
with some degree of satisfaction. He began to
feel a wish, and, indeed, a positive necessity of
recalling Ardenne, and he wanted very much a
plausible excuse for relenting. A feeling more
lively than this mere satisfaction, an emotion of
generous regret, and a wish to compensate the
boy and girl he had so deeply injured, crossed
his mind, and impelled him to exclaim,
"By Heaven! there - are ~not reams of paper
enough in all Jefferson county for me to write
to Edgar on!" but instantly, angry with him-
self for this escapade, he relapsed into more
than usual sullenness of silence, and heard the
story to an end with a solitary "Bumphl" at its
conclusion- Then, when, after silently await-
ing his comments for awhile, Claude ventured to
inquire concerning his probable course of action,
he said, importantly,
"This matter requires mature deliberation,

Father Vellemonte-I beg your pardon, Mon-~
siour Le Duc I"
1 am afraid, reader, you do not do half justice
to the goodness that dwelt in Harriette Joy's
merry heart. She was waiting on the steps for
Claude when he came down.
"And so you could get nothing out of him,"
she said, when Claude had told her the resu1~V
his visit.
"He takes time for mature deliberation."
"Yes~ A judge taking time for mature deli-
beration as to whether he will pardon, or not,
and when, and bow far, while the culprits are
bound upon the rack. This must be put a stop
tot I will go myself and talk to him I Be is
fond of me. I-will go and coax him."
"Do not go, my dear Harriette, to-day; he is
too much excited, and I am afraid of a return of
fever, therefore heft him so suddenly. Go to-
morrow morning, my dear child," said Clabde
Vellemonte, squeezing Harriette's hand, and
leaving her.
"I will go up and stay with your father,
Winny, dear, while you and grandmother
(Harry, since coming to the house, had always
affectionately called the old lady grandmother,)
eat breakfast," said Harriette, the next morn-
ing, and accordingly she ran up stairs and enters-
ed the squire's room. He was up now, and
seated in a crimson damask arm-chair by the
fire. He was dressed In a blue velvet dressing- ~
gown, and a many-colored Chinese night-cap.
And by his side stood a nice little mahogany
stand covered with a white cloth, and an eb.gant
litle breakfast service for one person. Nerve
was standing waiting on him.
"Will you take some breakfast, Miss Harry?"
cheerfully inquired the squire.
"Indeed, I'm afraid there's not enough for
yourself," laughed Harriette.
"I do not, in fact, know that there will be
enough for teuo, since the second one is little
Nimrod; indeed; I half repent my invitation-
say 'no, thank you,' Miss Barry I"
"No, thank you, sir; I came up only to wait
on you. Nerve, go down and nurse the baby!"
"Nuss the baby! I think its'bout time I'd
done o' that there," said Nerve, grumbling, but
obeying.
Harriette had chosen her time well-when re-
freshed by a good night's sleep, and by his bath1
Squire Darling "newly shaved-fresh as a bride-
groom," sat in his handsome dressing-gown and
cap, in his large, easy chair, bythe genial, bright
fire, enjoying all the creature comforts with the
infinite, the Ineffable gusto of a conxslescent.
Barry went at her innocent flattering with little
tact. She buttered his buckwheats for him-
kept alive the fire in the chafing-dish under ~ls:
venison steak, and cut of the ebolde pis. ~

laid on his plate. And finallyafter he had eaten
and lingered long over a very hearty breakfast,
she lighted his meerachaum and handed to him-
rolling away the stand at the same time. But

she loved the fragrant smoke of the meer-
schaum better than any perfume in the world!
Ahi Miss Harry! this coaxing and flattering an
old gentleman of Squire Darling's kith, is not the
wisest thing in the world-as you will presently
livid to your cost. She liked tobacco smoke bet-
ter than anything in the world! The mendacious
little sinner! Squire Darling, himself, was not
to be gulled by that very flimsy piece of deceit!
He took his pipe out of his mouth, and looking
down at her with an affectionate archness, said,
"God Almighty bless you, Harriette I you can
~ more play a part than the simplest infant!"
Harriette dropped her eyelids, blushed deeply,
and looked intensely mortified at the idea of
being thought incapable of deceit.
"Well, what is it, Miss Harry? for, of course,
all this wheedling means that you want some-
thing of me!"
"Yes, I do," said Harriette, in a low tone,
"but it was not for'myself."
"Of course it was not-who ever heard of
you're ever saying, doing, or thinking anything
~ fbr yourself. God bliss little Nirnrod! How
refreshing a good girl is," said the squire, pat-
ting her black, curly haired head approvingly,
and stroking down her damask cheek. "Now
what is it, Harriette, for, be sure, there is a
good chance of your suit being gained-there are
few things I could refuse little Nimrod."
"Then I wish, if you please-I should be so
thankful to you if you would-would----would not
be so extremely hard-hearted and cruel to poor
dear Edgar and Whiny!"
"'Hard-hearted and cruel,' humpht Your
manner of advocating a cause should immorta-
lize you as a diplomatist, Miss Harry!" dryly
commented the squire. "Well, I spose that's
wholesome truth, and no flattery," he added,
mentally-then speaking aloud to Harriette, he
said, "Well, what am I to do."
"Deal justly by them, sir !"
"Humph! there it is again! no appeal to-
well! it's well i'm inclined to favor her peti-
tion," thought the squire, and then he said,
"And if I do, Miss Harry, what then ?"
"Oh, sir! they will be so very happy ?"
"And I?"
"Oh, sir! never mind about you
"The d-l."

ter and son-in-law, and their child, or children,
sir!"
"Oh! my daughter and son-in-law-they will
be absorbed in each other--and as for their
child, or children-ain't you ashamed, Miss
Harry, by the way, to be speculating upon conse-
quences 1 1 am not fond of babies."
"Well, sir, at least you will have-"
"I will have nothing!" said the squire, "and
the fact is, that~I am not going to sacrifice my-
self for undutiful children."
"Oh, sir! you-"
"1 WON'T! D- if I do!" exclaimed the
squire, who was in one of his wilful moods, and
wished to torment Harriette-whose want of
diplomacy had certainly contributed to raise the
present perverse spirit.
"No, d- it I do!" repeated the squire.
Harriette coaxed, entreated, wrung her hands,
wept.
"No, d- if I do !" was all the satisfaction
she got.
Harry renewed her coaxing, entreating, and
weeping. In vain.
"No, d- if 1 do !" was the finale.
"Oh, mercy!" said Harriette, "I tbo'ight you
had repented; I thought you were going to re-
form! and here you are, as wicked as ever, and
swearing as hard as ever!"
"When the devil got sick, the devil a saint would be;
When the devil got well, the devil a saint was he!"
"Oh, indeed it is too shocking to hear you-
and I am going away, Squire Darling," said
Harry, "more in sorrow than in £nger," rising
to depart.
"Come back,~ little Nimrod-' thou almost
persuades me to be a Christian.' Come back,
little girl."
"No, Squire Darling, I will not come back-
you distress me too much!" said Harry, deeply
wounded to see one who should be a father in
Israel, acting and talking with so much irreve-
rence and profanity.
"Come back, little Nimrod; I have somewhat
to say to thee concerning Edgar a~d Winny !"
"Well, sir!" said Harriette, returning.
"It seems to me, you have abandoned their
cause very rashly," said the squire, who, after
all, liked well to be coaxed by her.
At it Harriette went again with all her might
and main.
"You say you love Winny, sir! Ah! you
cannot I If you did, you would sacrificeany selfish
feeling for hersake."
"Do you love Winny, little Nimrod ?"
"Ak, ask Winny if I do not, sir !"
"Then you would be willing to do a great
deal for her sake!"
"Tryine, sir!"

"It is in your power to make her happy!"
"How, sir I"
"By re-uniting her snd her husband."
"1 guessed that much, sir, fot that only woulc
make her happy-nothing else certainly would
I mean how is it in my power?"
"You can purchase their pardon."
"How, sir? I say again."
"Will you promise to do anything I wish you
to do-if I promise to pardon them, and recall
Edgar?"
"Yes, the Lord hears me! I will, sir!" said
the rash and unsuspicious girl.
"Anything!"
"Any thing on earth, sir, in the range of my
power."
"Hem!" Come closer to me, Harr~ot. You
are a dear, honest, large-hearted child! Ho~v
nice it would be to have you always here, and
be sure that I should not have some fine fellow
walking around, and carrying you off some day I
as was the case with Winny. Harriette, my
dear," he said, stealing his arm around hex
waist, and drawing her up to his side-" are you
engaged ?"
"Encaged, how sir ?"
"To be married, I mean!"
"No, sir."
"Well, then, Harriette, it most assuredly is
in your puwer to effect a reconciliation between
me and Edgar Ardenne I" said he, giving her a
squeeze
"I do not comprehend you, sir," observed
Harriette, in a low voice, with a rising color.
"You do! you little rogue I" giving her ano-
ther squeeze.
"I want to go to breakfast, Squire Darling!"
sai4 Harriette, flushing with embarrassment be-
tween her disagreeable position and her dislike
of hurting his feelings.
"So you shall, in a moment; butyon promised
to be mediator between me and Edgar."
"Yes-well! if you want me to give you a
ki~s-why as it is you-I'll give you two, if
you'll oriiy let me go now and carry some com-
fort to Winny."
"Ah! Harriette, I want to marry you."
"You are making fun of me, Squire Darling,"
said Harriette, growing pale.
"I have too earnest and sincere an esteem for
you, Rarriette, to 'make fun' of you. I want
youto promise yourself to me, on condition of
my xnaking Edgar and Winny, whom you love,
happy I"
Harriette was silent~
"Come, what do you say?"
" say you are not in earnest, Squire Darling;
ani that the conversation distresses me-ez-
trestely "
"Before Heaven, I am in earnest in what I am
about to declare to you-namely, that~ou shall
never draw fro~.n me apardovz for these ilj~rn,

until you promise to give me your hand in mar-
riage-and that as soon as you will give me that
promise, I will dictate a letter that you shall
I write to Edgar Ardenne, recalling him to Oak
I Grove! Come, will you be generous-will you
be magnanimous-will you be self-sacrificing l~,
"To your own children, you will certainly be
magnanimous, sir!"
"Will I? Humph I I never professed to une~
1 derstand that branch of Ethics-and I swear to
you, that 1 will never grant your petition for
I their pardon, until you grant my petition for
your hand."
A profound sigh from Harriette, who dropped
her head upon her bosom, was the only answer.
"And I say that the very hour you promise
me your hand, I will write to Edgar. Comet
what do you say to that ?"
"I say, sir, that I cannot see any good reason
why their happiness should depend upon your
possessing my hand," said Harry, looking down
piteously at the threatened digits.
"What! see no reason? I'll tell you then!
If Winny and Edgar are re-united, I shall be
very lonesome, and need a companion; and I
want you.~~
A deeper sigh from Harriette followed.
All this time, with his arm around her waist
he held her close to his side.
"Come, Harriette, have you never heard the
old ladies say, 'lt's better to be an old man's
darling than a young man's slave?"'
"No, sir! I never heard any body but old
gentleman say that!
"But you can't deny that it is better to be en
old man's darling than a young man's slave."
"Yes, I can and do, Squire Darling, for in the
latter case, at least, one might be able to love
their master, which would make the slavery
sweet, you know; and then, sir, there is such a
thing as being a young man's darling, and an old
man's slave, which is not only very much more
horrible, but very much more likely to be the
case I"
"That is very severe! Pray, what is your
reason for thinking so ?"
"That as a general thing there is too much
sympathy between the young to permit them to
tyrannize over each other much."
"You think, then, it is impossible for a young
woman really to love an elderly man well enough
to marry him?"
"Nay! I do not sayso; lonlysayitisim..
possible for me. Let us drop the conversation,
Squire Darling."
"By no means, till you decide, for happine.
or misery, the fate of Winny and Edgar, whom
you profess to love so well 1"

after witnessing the marriage, she found a letter
waiting br her. It was post-marked "Win
I chester," and directed in a familiar hand. Ear-
riette's head swam, and her ey~ s filmed over an
instant, as she took it and sank into a chair to
read it. When she had finished, the letter drop-
ped from her hands, her face fell upon her palms,
and quick tears trickled through her fingers
Squire Darling was watching her. Now he' laid
aside his paper, took up the letter, and asked,
"Harriette, what's the matter-may I read
this 'U,
"Yes, sir, and answer it, please," and she
wiped her eyes and smiled.
Squire Darling turned the letter to read it. It
was a long, long epistle, full of history, meta-
physics, inner lifefascination, moral light, expla-
nations, protestations. etc.,for four closely written
and crossed'foolscap pages; the object of it being
to persuade Harriette Joy that Henry Lee Dan-
gerlield, amid all the vacillations of his heart,
turned at last to her, "true as the needle to the
pole," and ending with an offer of his hand and
heart, imploring a speedy answer. Squire Dar-
ling, with his spectacles on his nose, and one~
short, fat leg crossed over the other, leaned back
in 'his chair and read this lengthy piece of
logic, passion and metaphysics, with many a
"Humph!"* and "Ha!" and "Fudge!" and
"Trumpery!" Then he folded up the letter and
deposited it in his coat pocket, uncrossed his
knees, took oil his specs, and looking at Earn-
ette, said,
"Now, do you know what the vernacular of
this grandiloquence is? Just this, Harry, my
dear! As he can't get Imogene, or-hem I-

"Oh! ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! women were made

"Yes, sir, if you please."

"That's a wide margin-I will."

Monsieur and Madame do Vellemcinte were yet
at Red-Stone. Harriette Joy still at Oak Grove.
Squire Darling, who never did anything by
halves, either in the way of falling out or of ma-
king up with a friend, had availed himself of his
first strength In this fine 3une weather, to go on
a journey to meet Edgar Ardenne, who was on his
.way returning from the West Sammie Smnilie was
staying at Oak Grove, during the absence of the
proprietor, as a sort of general supervisor of the
premises, and protectorofthewomen. Rettie Smi-
lie, the faithful companion of Winny in joy as in
sorrow, was there also, up to her eyes in confec-
tionary and pastry cooking. Hettie had her
own little private joys, hopes and expectati.ns-
had not her father sworn off from drinking?-
was not Willie Smille-Cousin Willie, coming
home with Edgar Ardenne? and when he came,
was not somebody to be married and go to house-
keeping at that dear old Pine Cliffs, which was
newly repaired and neatly furnished by Squirts
Darling? AhI Hettie tripped about, thinki4-
this a very bright world after all is said! Harri-
ette Joy was to be married when they returned,
but no preparations for that event especially
were on foot. It seemed to have been tacitly
arranged that her wedding should come off
quietly, and her position in the household be
that of an upper housekeeper. And Harriette,
who had no time to think about it, and no talent
for making herself an object of compassion, never
said a word; but ran about very busy and merry,
exhorting, commanding, entreating the servants,
and superintending a general cleaning, polishing,
and embellishing the house, against Edgar came.
The bloom of hope had returned to Winny's
heart, and the rose of health to her cheek; and
ig ever Harriette betrayed any emotion, it was
one of pleasure, as she would stop in her flitting
hither and thither, and catching Winny to her
bosom, kiss her blushing cheek. She was so
happy in Winny! One injunction she had laid
on Squire Darling with the force of a command
-that he should keep them advised of his pro-
gress towards home, and send a messenger a few
hours in advance, so that Winny's fragile nerves
might be shaken as little as possible. The squire
had promised this.
At length, early one morning, as the old lady,
Winny, Harriette and Hettie were sitting at
breakfast together, a horseman rode up to the
house, and dismounting, entered the hall, and
handed a letter to Harriette. It was from Squire
Darling, and ran thus-

of Henry II.. Matilda of Flanders, Queen Consort of William the Conqueror, and Matilda Atheling, Queen
Oonsort of Henry I. The writer, in giving us the History of these eminent women, has remarkably exempli-
fied the old adage that "truth is stranger than fiction ;" for no puro romance could excel it in stirring in-
cidentand the varied vicissitudes of love, pleasure, sorrow, and sulfuring, which form the staplo of all works of
action. Each sketch iqa ocaiplete fiarrative in itself, possessing all the charms of a Novel, with the additional
value and merit of historical truth. The book may be read with equal entertainment and profit.

A Novel, containing over 200 octavo pages. 50 cents.

TRANSLATED BY FAYETT~ ROBINSON, ESQ.
Price 60 Cents,
A brilliant Rom~uce, and one which will fascinate the reader equally with" ~onto Cristo" and "The Three
Guard~men." Our skillful author here presents the public with a tale whose s~xtraosdTnary iotere4 will take
it by surprise. The narrative is a perfect running fige of incidents, wrought out with an energy, piquancy and
power which keep the readerAa a constant whirl of breathless excitement from the first page to t~e last.
Love, mystery, Intrigue and adventure are mingled with an intricacy which, in the opinion of the 'bader,
must puzzle even the s.~izard pen of Dumas himself to unravel. Nevertheless it is unraveled, and thah~with
a delicacy and naturalness which smite the reader with the most profound, and at the same time th&amp;aooat
agreeable, astonishment. It is utterly impossible to commence the perusal of this work and lay it aside

THE FRENCH FORTUNE TELLER; OB.~ THE KY~TERIOU8 STRANGER.
Price 60 cents.
This is one of those lively and spirited Romances of PirenchIlfe and Intrigue which Sue l~ so famous for
portraying. His "Mysteries of Paris' has immortalized him, and this story is quite as good. The characters
are vividly drawn, and sustained throughout with striking fidelity. The portrait of ANATALD, a cold, specious,
ambitious intriguer, for example, is rendered with an impressive faithfelness, which, once read, can never be
obliterated from the memory. The character of the beautiful DuNn Is a brilliant yet melancholy likeness
of the easy virtue wl~ich marked the female representatives of the proud, wealthy aii~ corrupt upper classes
of her day. The touching history of poor MARIA FavzAu-a type of the fairer portion pf the Bes*rgeoise-wlll
be read with mournful interest, affording as it does a vivid contrast between the nm~oralA of the upper and
middling ranks, end the utter want of protection which virtue, when allied to beauty, has in the Trench metro-
polls, against the lechery of aristocratic libertines.

course laid in Paris, and tIme story will give the reader an insight into the private life of the honored and
distinguished, the wealthy and pious. and also the horrible rascals of that vast metropolis. tn the course of
this great romance, Sue, (while lie adds much to the interest of the plot,) exposes the causes which drive so
many thousands of the men of Paris to gambling, robberyand the galleys, and womra to prostitution and the
Morgue. While It is entirely free from any offensive thoughts or language, it unveils the terrible social
evils that exist in French society.

Sue has given us, in the above powerful romance, another vivid and startling picture of the sufferings and
struggles which aristocracies entail upon the peopLe. The work abounds in incident, and is rc.iplete with inter-
est from the opening chapter to the close. The oliaracters are dl~amvu and sustaimied throughout with spirit
and fidelity. The action is rapid, and the story absorbingly intense. Rarely have we perused a volume which
had for us so deep an interest. It fascinates the senses, like a beautiful woman, and gives the reader no rest
till he has completed the story.

THE MYSTERIES AND MISERIES OF SAN FRAiCISCO.
BY A DISTINGUISHED CALIFORNIAN.
Price 50 cents.

GIDEON GILES; OR, THE STRUGGLES OF LIFE.
BY THOMAS MILLER1 ESQ.
Author of "Godfrey Malvern,' etc. Illustrated. Price 50 cents.
This work is the life of a poor rope-maker and his daughter, struding against poverty and misfortune.
The daughter is beautiful, modest; and captivating. Sir Edward Lee, the great man of the book, notwithstand-
ing wife and daughters~ falls in love with ~lien Gile~, and concocts a plan to carry the unwilling maid away
To do this he employs a villain, with whose real character lie is unhappily unacquainted, and who wishes
the destruction of the girl from motives of revenge, himself being a rejected suitor. Timers are plots and
counterplots, in which the rope-maker and unsuspecting daughter are the victims. The delineations of char-
acter arc excellent; Ben Burst, Mine host of Fallow Deer Ins, ~he Gipsy encampment, and Jeal, the Gipsy's
Daughter, are all drawn to life. The book ends, as all such kooks should, in the happiness of the principal
characters. There are some tragedies; and. the hero, Walter Northcot, a little too perfect. That does no
herm-siR ely a model for the gentlemen to copy.

the fortunes of a hero who fought with Washingtop and Lafayette for the independence of America, and of
being almost a witness, we might say, of those grand, achievements by which the supernatural genius of Nape.
