SNARLER-HACKETT-VICE JIEADS TO DETECTION-AN ASSAULT AND A MSTAKE. "Passions wild, and follies vain, Pleasures soon exchanged for pain, Doubt, and jealousy, and fear, In the magic dance appear?' GUT MANNERINs. Low fleecy clouds swept over the Chesapeake. The wind ' blew from the east, bringing with it as usual piercing and unpleasant humidity. The surf beat on the beach, and wild fowl, as before a storm, were noisy on the white wave; flying 'hither and thither; and then, with a wild scream as they descended to the water, huddled together; each one seeming to be clamorous to speak out his opinion, and perhaps con- cert means for their mutual weal against the coming storm. A schooner, with but half her sails set, was making up St. Jerome's creek; that empties into the bay a few miles above Point Lookout. Her helmsman seemed to understand his business, he ran her in without grounding on the shoal that makes out in that neighbourhood, and laying close to the shore to the left, dropt her anchor, and the sails are furled. "Let down the boat," said the helmsman. "Captain," he continued, "I'll see you at the court house to-morrow," addressing our friend Captain Fulford. "When this storm blows over, you'd best work round to St. Mary's. Here you're snug, should it blow all the water out of the bay." "Ay, ay," said the captain. The boat was let down, one man jumped in with the helmsman, and the two soon rowed ashore; and while the sailor'in the yawl skulled back to the schooner, the other, who was Snarler, made his way up a hill to a house or hut nearly hid by a forest of trees. "My trip to 'Napblis," muttered he, "may be mighty sar- vice to me. Hah, the captain knows a thing or two. He heerd a fellow who came here with him say that young De- lafield would soon be here. Zounds! should he come, and, (7)   8        PILATE AND HEROD. without the will that I've got as tight as death has got him who made it, prove all this property here, and at St. Mary's to be his'n, I'm boxed. But no, I aint born for nothing. That are will no body shan't see, and I hain't had lawsuits not to know Delafield must have the will to get his daddy's property." He now came to the door of the hut. The door was fast- ened. He walked round the house--"What?" said he," that wench Euphy didn't send my critter arter all.! If I don't comb that black rascal, Jim, down and make the wench know her business aint her'n but mine, then may-I be shot. This won't do," he continued, and forcing open a shutter, he entered the hut. ' What? What's this? A man as I live-and asleep too. What can he want here?, 1'll bet he has' been thieving." No one would have said so but Snarler ; for the house was as naked of every thing to tempt a thief as Snarler and the like are born into the world phy- sically and'morally. "I'll brain the whelp," he continued, seizing a chunk of wood from the fire, place; but, as he was about to strike, the sleeper turned; over, and Snarler saw it'to be his man. Dropping the chunk, and kicking the negro--he brawled out lustilyj, ":here's my critter?"  -The negro rubbed his eyes, and recognizing his master, huriied out to catch the horse, who had rambled a little into the woods. The horse was caught, and Snarler rode on ,to St Mary's:. This unwholesome specimen of a man was about five feet Oine inches high, carried but a little flesh, stooped somewhat, and walked quickly and unsteadily. His dress troubled him but little, provided his pockets were golden.: His face and. features were not large. His fore- head was low: andi narrow.. He had evidently no construc- tiveness, and never sowed any wild oats. Plutarch says, those who sleep in. themoonlight aire, stupid and senseless; and perhaps the lunar influence of this lower world may have- dulled in him quickness and: sensibility. He was a usurers out " and out, and - according to Lord Bacon, " the greatest-Sabbath breaker; because:his plough goeth every Sunday. For his money lent oilt worked for him Sundays as well as other days." : He had also a peculiar expression, or perhaps want of expression, that might:;have led an ob- server to think he was a man of great simplicity, or inge- nuousness, if this simplicity, or vacancy, had not been at- P9    SNARLER.           9 tended by an unamiable cast of countenance, and a singular meaning out of the eye, that seemed to prove his simplicity to be the absence of all high, noble, and exalted sentiments. The unpleasant expression in his face was also a tell tale, de- noting him to be one of those unhappy temperaments, who make themselves miserable, and, so far as they can, all around miserable likewise. This inanity of any thing noble and elevating in the expression of Snarler's face Was in- creased by the 'half-snub character of his nose, most gene- rally indicative of small shrewdness and fox-like sense. The greatest fault in Snarler was the littleness of his soul. He seemed to have no kindness or affection. He moved in his nearly solitary home, (having only his niece, the simple-minded Euphy, about him,) as might float an iceberg on the ocean; repulsive and cold, but without its splendour.  He appeared to think that warmth of man- ner, or a kind word, or the display of kind feelings towards the poor girl, who depended on him, was a waste of time, a childishness, weakness, and  improper condescension. So seem to think some would be greater men than Snarler, for fear lest they may lower their dignity.; forgetting that a common table spoon will hold his brains who ants a soul to feel and care for others, and that the dignity which rests upon a  cloudy face, a knit brow, and a pinchqd or screwed up lip is as properly the orang-outang's as -theirs. . If Snarler gave his niece any thing, or granted her a request, he did it with the ungraciousness with which he might throw a useless bone -to a cur, that' he felt half inclined to give a kick to.  If-he asked her for :any thing, his wishes were orders, authoritatively expressed and so snappishy that the poor girl trembled when she waited upon him. Andit was Euphy s  great cross and trial to be poor, and especially to be dependant on this churl of an uncle, who thought it be- hooved him to watch her as suspiciouslyas he did his money, to grant her no favours he could decently refuse, and to find fault with every thing she did-often too before  he knew that he   himself would not have done the very thing, and precisely as she did it. And, if atany time he should chance to be out of -humour, and this was nearlyall the time, Euphy was made to feel his spleen, till he had tired himself down in fretting; or, unlessshe could contrive to steal away to a  neighbour's house, and there, under theo   10,        PILATE AND HEROD. plea of bad weather, indisposition or the like, she would stay free for awhile from his growlings and petulance. "Sad life mine," she would say.  'Uncle thinks I'm only made to fret at. Indeed! I'll marry Mr. Hackett. Love in a cottage is better than this sort of life; though uncle does say marrying without money is the foolishest thing in the world. I'd rather be an oyster in a shell, then rd be quiet, than pass such a dog's life as this." These meditations of the victimized girl often would be interrupted by a squealing voice, calling out, "Come here, wench! You are always out of the way. Now look at you. This aint either Sunday, nor aint it a holyday, and yet you have got your best frock on. Very well, wear it out, and you'll wear your rags to the next party." The trouble about the notes and papers, which we men- tioned, did not improve Snarler's temper, and, though by violence he had gained the release, he was not without fear of Father Hunter's revenge". His own desire for revenge also, being still unsated, wanting an object to vent itself on, like the fox in the Spartan's bosom, gnawed inwards, for this diabolical feeling burns to return an eye for an eye, and a tooth -for a tooth, and feeds on substances so unquenchable that time cannot abate it, and is so inveterate that intreaties and concessions only fan and keep it alive. c"A soft answer turneth away wrath," but not malice. Stich was Snarler. Hackett, who was the cause, in a degree, of this poor man's misery, was hardly less wretched, though differently affected. He had taken one false step, and, as Tacitus said of Tiberius, his remorse left as deep and bloody a print on his mind as the stroke of the scourge does on the slave's back, and hence it appeared that the memory of that step, together with the thought of the consequences, would ever haunt him. He could not dismiss it from his mind, and even when it seemed that the hateful vision had disappeared, something would call it up, and he was tormented with an ever present fear of being at- last detected and exposed. For, though not a man of education or refinement, and certainly not one of principle, (he would hot have stolen if hehad been,) Hack- ett's vanity and sensitiveness to opinion were so great that exposure seemed worse to him than death. This cowardice, unable to face the public, renders men untrue to all obliga- tions, bad friends, and dangerous acquaintances, as well as   HACKETT.           " untrue and hostile to themselves. There is, besides, so intimate a connexion between virtue and every thing about us, that every thing seems to threaten and likely to tell on us, when we have done wrong. Wherever he went, Hack- ett saw thief written. He could not hear a remark that did not, by implication, seem to point him out as a wretch that ought to be exposed. If he entered a store, or the tavern porch, or a parlour, and the company was laughing, or whis. pering low, conscience at once suggested that he was the subject, and he almost wondered at times why the public had so long forborne bringing him to punishment. Much indeed of this was conjecture, but his situation was not without dangers. INe had visited Miss- Euphy, now his betrothed, as mentioned, twice, and secretly; once during Snarler's absence, and the second time after dark, when Snarler was at home; and Euphy received her lover in the back porch. And it so happened that, the morning after the robbery, Snarler found Hackett's foot-track by the chimney in the garden, which he accurately measured, and it happened also that Hackett's visit did not escape SDarler's vigilance, for after bidding Euphy good evening at the porch, he retired by way of the garden--Snarler might hail him from the window up stairs if he went away by the front gate. But, in departing by way of the garden, he left his foot-print on one of the beds, which the suspicious Snarler saw the next morning, and, measuring it, found it to correspond with the other track which he had measured. "Father Hunter or not," muttered Snarler at the dis- covery, "the thief was here agin, and I mean to catch him if I  can." . c  Euphy overheard this remark, and hastened to report it to Hackett, and :it seemed to him now that exposure was near and inevitable. "Be ye sure,'i-said Moses to the Israelites, ('your sin will find you out."  And Hackett knew this remark to be true, if he had ever heard it. Strange while, a  hand invisible, by ways alike wonderful nd efficient, protects the good man, there is neither shelter, ,  place of refuge, nor escape for the rogue. "Commit a rime," says an unknown author, "and the earth is made of lass. Commit a crime, and i  t seems as if a coat of snow  tell on thelground, such as reveals in the woods the track of :very partridge, and fox, and squirrel, and mole. You can- iot wipe out the foot-track. You cannot draw up the ladder,   12        PILATE AND HEROD. so as to leave no inlet or clue. Some damning circumstances always transpire. The- laws and ,substances of nature, water, snow, wind, gravitation, beqome penalties to the thief." Seeing his detection thus near- and certain, Hackett dis- closed every thing to Euphy, and love is so blind, and a woman in love is so unwilling to believe aught against the object loved, that she credited his story) pitied him for being in a situation which so tried and corrupted his integrity, believed him to be after all worthy of confidence and affection, and promised faithfully to do her best to lead her uncle off from his scent. While matters were in this state, Hackett imprudently made a third visit to Snarler's house, the owner being at the time, it was believed, in the town, and he and Euphy were sitting in the back room, when the servant announced that Miss Gordon, the parson's daughter, was at the door. Hackett rose to go, advancing towards the front door, but, to hfs amazement, he saw Snarler not far from the gate, and about entering. ITf he had been innocent, or hardened in guilt, he might have withdrawn, and calmly and easily encountered Snarler. But, i as is usual in such cases, in the attempt at further concealment, he rendered his detection more certain. He therefore went out the back way and by the garden. Snarler at this moment met a servant, and was informed that her niece had company, Parson Gordon's daughter and a gentleman, without stying who the gentleman was. Mut- tering something about the unseasonable hour of visiting, saying that he had enough of the parson in the tobacco tax he had to pay, and he thought all would be better off if they had religion without paying the parson, Snarler walked past the front ga/te. In walking away, Snarler passed along side of the garden fence, and he had hardly come in view of the garden, than he saw the figuie of a man in the6act of retiring. "I'll catch the rascal now,' said he. "That's the fellow." He hurried on by the fence to a back gate, thinking there to intercept the intruder. This garden back gate opened on a bye-road, which led to the highway, and, as Snarler turned the corner of the garden-fence, which was close to the gate, he saw a person walking away from it to. the public road, and concluded that this was the person he was in quest of. Seizing a club, he ran furiously toward this person, and so rapidly as to be upon him just as the latter discovered Snarler.   MONTROSE.  13 This person was Montrose; who, a few minutes before having espied Parson Gordon and Emma on horsebackrid. ing towards Snarler's, walked in that direction, hoping to fall in with them, and especially ascertain where Emma would spend the evening in St. Mary's. But Parson Gor- don rode with his daughter no further than Snarler's gate, and Montrose met neither of them; and, presuming that Emma might have called on Euphy, walked towards Snarler's. By mistake he took   the private road leading to the back gate of the garden, and had discovered his error, and was on his way to the main road, when he heard a noise in the bushes. He turned round, and saw Snarlers with his face livid with passion, in the t of striking him with r oo, , acmt, of' striking him with the club mentioned.   Montrose sprang hastily aside, and evaded the blow, which was prompted by too much temper to be aimed surely; then springing upon Snarler, (forthe youth's blood was up,) he  threw him to the ground; and before the latter could explain, which he might not have attempted, or Montrose could think to demand an explana- tion, he administered to the choleric Snarler four or five smart blows  with his own club; and, then keeping him down, asked the meaning of the assault. We   often want a few  syllabic formations to wreak our thoughts into expression. If we had but the picture-lan. guage of the ancient Mexicans, or the knotted cords of the ancient Chinese and Persians, we'should seek in vain to say what we-Mean under cer  tain circumstances  Andnow even with our language rich, full and expressive Snarler as at a  loss, and the historian of this worthy disaster is also unable to say what  precise feelings or thoughts were uppermost with him.    He was mad, mortified, vexed, and yet cowed. His\ anger was not Whipt out of him, but only kept under. He was humbled, and yet he Vowed mentally he would have the law against Montrose; who, he supposed had first robbed, and now beaten him. And his code of morals, like that of Allgrace, did not condemn his robbery, and almost murder of the sturdy priest of St. Inigoes'. He was mortified to be thus handled by a young man, and by his supposed plun- derer, and yetthis mortification was hardly greater than his vexation at having aimed his blow at Montrose so badly. But Montrose had 'put a  question, and he was resolved to have an answer; for raising the staff, and repeating his de- man nd, he gave Snarler to understand he would beat him V   oL . II,-.!-.2   -14       PILATE AND HEROD. again and more severely. Snarler saw at once the necessity of reply, and, nearly choking, said: "Hadn't I the right to hit a man what robbed me '" a Dotard," replied Montrose, kicking him, " who told you so?" "I saw you jest now," said he, stealing away from my house by the garden." "I have never been to your house, nor in your garden," replied Montrose, and he then explained how he came there. "That's not believable," said Snarler, mentally; but, keeping his thoughts to himself, he added, "Let me git up, sir." Montrose suffered him to rise, and then asked and received an explanation. "The person, you saw in the garden," he continued, " you think stole your papers. I heard you had recovered them." Snarler assented. "Among them is the will, not recorded, of your niece's father, proving that the testator, acting as the agent (of my father he was about to say,) of Mr. Delafield, bought for his factor a large body of land; which, in the absence of said will, you ,hold as yours by your relationship with the deceased. C arles Delafield, my friend, and whose agent I am, claims his father's property. I can prove my attorney- ship. I want the will, and wilL pay you handsomely for it." "That there will haint got any such proof, and it is good for nothing. My cousin was out of mind when he wrote it." "Give me the will," said Montrose, " and I will find and make good the proof out of it. Come, old fellow," hoping to soften him, I'll give you ready money down for it." Snarler seemed to be in a quandary. The property he held was very valuable, but his title might be overthrown. "Give me," he replied, after musing some time, "jest half the property your friend, Charles Delafield, thinks hisen by the will, and I'll give you the paper." Montrose felt vexed at this exorbitant proposition. The fellow, unrighteously and unlawfully, withheld a will prov- ing a large estate to belong to Charles Delafield. He held, by withholding said will, this large estate as his own! To neither will nor estate was he entitled. His roguery besides deserved punishment. And now unblushingly he asked half, of a large estate to surrender what was .ot his? andc   MONTROSE AND SNARLER.        15 which every obligation bound him to give him up freely. Hence Montrose, with eyes flashing, replied, "No." a' What then?" asked the usurer. ' I can burn that- pa- per, if I mind to, and 'alter it; you haint no proof that Charles Delafield owns the property." Montrose looked sulky, and felt that he was in Snarler's power. i"What say ye to giving me a thousand pounds?  Your friend won't miss it;" and, lowering his voice, arid approach- ing Montrose, so as to make him hear by a whisper: If you don't, I knows how all them there fine acres, a mighty big tract of forest land 'tis, may be mine." And his eyes kindled, and a smile played about Snarler's mouth, and he clapped his hands together with 'a sort of chuckling laugh, as if he had the property, as gold, in his hand: Yes all will be mine." "Misretant!' said Montrose, seizing him by the collar, and shaking him.  "Give me the will, or take the conse- quences.' Snarler did not think any consequences were likely to ensue beyond a rough  handling, and, remarking that he had not the paper about him, he looked anxiously up the road to see if any one was approaching, or in sight, or within call. Seeing no one, and not liking the expression on the face of Montrose, he muttered: "If you hit me, I   hope you know I can have the law of you?" "Contemptible wretch!" said Montrose, restraining him- self with difficulty. "If, -by beating you, I could beat honesty into you, I would negotiate our matters with this instrument "-shaking the stick over Snarler's head. "' But come, I'll give you one hundred pounds, but not one shilling more." '"Won't you let me go to my house?" moving towards his residence, "I can't take that offer."  "Pass on," said Montrose, vexed,-anxious to do some- thing, provoked to be foiled by such a man, and, like better men, under like circumstances, relieved himself partially by a   threat. The menace Snarler knew to be-a mere bravado, or rather thought the future had no danger if the present gave- no signs of it. "Pass on," continued Montrose. Snarler moved on slowly, glad to be rid of Montrose,   10        PILATE AND HlEROD. yet puzzled how to shape his thoughts from what had past. "'Tis strange, that's a fact," said he. "He warn't the thief that stole my papers, and he haint been to my house neither; and yet he's the fellow, sure as a gun, I catched coming out of the garden. There's no mistake there. And didn't he say he meant to have the will? This looks mighty like he knowed where I keeps it, and he counts on gitting it agin. But then he's a very Indian in fight! Zounds! I thought he'd have murdered me, and he talks big like them folks that's too grand to steal. Ah I but then may be, perhaps,"--and Snarler caught at it as a bright suggestion,-" he thinks it aint stealing to take from me what aint mine; neither wasn't it stealing to take my release from that dog of a priest. And he takes it for his friend the owner. He's the fellow. I must look out. He'll sartainly come." He stopt at his gate, and stood there for sometime soliloquizing. After awhile he appeared to have digested his thoughts. "Ah! Thief or no thief, I'll say he's one. A pretty gentleman to threaten me with his big words. Yes, I wonder if the law,--the law can't put him: where he'll have to kick and splutter?" Montrose looked after Snarler, anxious to see Emma, but doubting the propriety of following her into Snarler's house. He walked some time before Snarler's gate, and, as Emma came out, he advanced to meet her. But what's the mean- ing of all this? Emma received him so coldly that it nearly chilled in him the warm current of words to ask what he had wished, and the yet warmer inner current of feelings that imust start the words into movement. "My stay in St. Mary's will depend on my father, who is at the castle." "Will my sister be there with you?" he asked, forgetting his assumed character. Emma looked amazed. "I have not the pleasure to know her." "Miss Julia," colouring as be corrected himself. "Miss Gordon's manner is so strange that my head wanders." "The wandering of the head," said Emma, excited, " is not the worst of evils." And, waving her hand coldly, she urged on her horse, and the next moment she was gone.   MONTROSE'S SOLILOQUY.       17 "There she goes," said he, soliloquizing. "She has shot words at me that pierce deeper, and rankle more than would a poisoned arrow. What have I done? Surely not my little flirtation with Miss Evelin. I was not Miss Gordon's declared suitor. I am still uncommitted, and she is not the woman to infer matrimonial intentions from a bow, visit, or compliment. But it is possible something happened at this scamp's house." He thought awhile, walking on slowly. "I think I see now. Snarler took me for the fellow who robbed him, and which person, he said, he saw escaping by way of his garden. But can he think sO now? Well, he is not too good so to misrepresent me. But Miss Gordon would not credit such a story of me, and from such a source?" And self-esteem was for a moment not a little wounded at the possibility of the thing. "What then?" He walked on, chewing the bitter cud of painful thought, and it is not only bitter but very unmanageable, when, after turning over various suggestions, the mind can conclude nothing satisfactorily, and has still the cud to chew. And at times the temples throb with anxiety, and we press our hand to our brow, as if to support the weight that bears us down, and as if, by the action, we would aid the brain in arriving at the truth we want. "Ah!" he continued, "Can it be this? Desperation! No) surely. Yet possi- bly. That old fool has a niece, a simple, trusting girl, and Shepard told me she was attached to Hackett. Snarler opposes the connexion. Hackett, perhaps, lover-like, as he cannot get to his charmer by the door, enters by the window. It must have been his figure Snarler saw in the garden. He had made her a visit, and Snarler was about to surprise them, when he decamped. Euphy, of course, would not tell upon him. Better, she thought, that suspi- cion slould rest on any other than Hackett." And for a moment or so the light this research into the field of hypo- thesis brought with it appeared to calm him a little. Truth is ever less painful than error to a mind qualified to receive it.  Snarler," he added, "thinks I am his niece's secret lover; and so believing, and prejudiced against me, in the heat of his passion, he has returned to the house, and associated his niece's name and mine together in a manner, which might not be discreditable if Hackett's, but is so when mine is mentioned. Miss Euphy, of course, could 2*   18        PILATE AND HEROD. only deny. Explanation was out of the question. May not this be it? We'll see." After supper, with Shepard along, Montrose repaired to the castle. They waited some time for the ladies. Colonel Smithson was not at home. In this interim Montrose said, soliloquizing: "It was due to me not to condemn me unheard, and, if she thought proper to assail me, it was but fair to hear me in my defence. Let Miss GordQn appear. I'll present to her the bold front of innocence, and show her, if she can be un- justly caustic, I can be distant." Advancing footsteps were now heard, and the rustle of dresses. Miss Evelin's laugh could be distinguished. In came the belle of St. Mary's, Julia, Mrs. Smithson, and, more than all, thought Shepard, Mrs. Annie. But Miss Gordon was missing, and Montrose, who felt strongly in- clined, a moment before, to act the hero's part, not seeing Emma, felt neither a hero's ability nor stoutness. "Emma is not well," was Julia's apology to the visiters. More Montrose could not ask. During the evening Montrose managed to engross the company of Julia, and he skilfully availed himself of it to put her in possession of certain facts necessary to place him above suspicion, adroitly, as he hoped, keeping out of sight his motive in referring to the matter, and he closed his statement with the remark: "I waited to see Miss Emma, not doubting to find her, as usual, kind and welcome as a February sunbeam after a dreary winter." "You found the disk of your sun obscured?" interrupted Julia, smiling, and seeing exactly how matters stood with him. "It was misty, I suppose,-bless me, you gentlemen never carry fogs about with you?" "A fog, mist, and an easterly storm to boot," continued Montrose. ' Cap off, and hand to my mouth, and looking as gracious as the first courtier of the King of France when his majesty speaks, I made my greeting. But, to my courteous bow, she returned a very distant acknowledgment, to a very civil question she gave an enigmatical answer." "All right," said Julia, laughing. "If we don't queen At sometimes, you lords of creation would make us mere serving women. But what then?" "Of course t became embarrassed," he said, "and made a slip of the tongue, and then apologized; saying, my head   JULIA'S SONo.          19 wanders. Miss Emma retorted, the wandering of the head is not the worst of evils. She then rode off, light as air, and I felt heavy as lead." He hesitated, doubting whether he should let her any further into his matters. "I called this evening." "Then my presence is very unnecessary," and Julia play- fully rose as if she was about to retire; but soon reseated herself, saying, "well, sir knight." "I hoped kind fortune would make amends for the day; but Miss Emma is not to be seen," he .continued. "A woful disappointment," and Julia laughed, evidently enjoying hischagrin. But a light cloud passed over her face, and sympathizing with him, she added, still in a cheerful tone,-I'll sing to you, what shall it be? "Poor Colin Brown once lov'd a maid, And ne'er lov'd swain as he, The maid she coldly shook her head, When he said marry me. "Poor Colin sighed, oh sweet-heart dear! One sunny smile I pray; I ne'er shall know but vexing care, 'Till you my love repay. "The maiden prest at last said yea, To Colin Brown so true,- Her smile it chased all clouds away And he no more was blue."  Montrose was amused at the song, and said he hoped that Colin would get smiles again. On his return to the tavern, and while conjecturing whether Julia did not more than suspect him to be her brother, a waiter at the inn brought him a letter from his strange acquaintance; stating that he hoped to be in St. Mary's soon, ,and trusted; to fiind him there. The writer announced himself by his signature as simply a friend.. The conjecture of Montrose in reference to Snarler was correct. This singular worthy, with the feelings and sus- picions which Montrose imputed to him, entered his house, and regardless of the presence of:Miss Gordon, broke out on Euphy. "You a nice lady    Pretty manners this! So you, and a Mr. Montrosc eh, have been having-what do you call them?--ah! tate a tates, but what I call in Eng- lish unproper meetings. I was about to come on you and your sweetheart, sitting, I vow, lovingly together, an im-   ZU        PILATEJ AND HlEROD.  pudent fellow, in my house, when he takes the hint, and clears. I saw him though, that I did, and I'll fix him yet." Euphy was of course confounded. She rejoiced at Hackett's escape, but could not understand how Montrose and herself were so connected together in her uncle's imagination. Emma made her precipitate retreat, and on her departure Snarler became so insufferably abusive, that Euphy, alarmed, gathered up her best clothes, and fled to the castle; and on being interrogated by Mrs. Smithson, who had heard Emma's version, how Montrose was mixd up in her affairs, the guileless girl ingenuously acquitted him of any part in them. Mrs. Smithson kindly asked no further, and Emmn, before the next day learned enough from Julia and Mrs. Smithson to see that she had done Montrose injustice. After Euphy's retreat, Snarler, perforce, having no one in the house to let out his ill humour on, calmed down; but, still indignant at the supposed misconduct of his niece, went to her room hoping to find some evidence against her. On the floor he saw lying pieces of a note, which was ad- dressed to her, and which, with some difficulty, he read. '"Ah! here's the gentleman's fist," chuckling as he spoke. He took up the first pieces and read as follows: "DEAREST EUPHY, "I wanted to come and see you yesterday, but your cross uncle stayed home all day." "A nice tempered, honey and sugar spark this," mut- tered Snarler, not relishing this reflection on his equanimity. "'Tis all the thanks I gits for being kind." He put to- gether some more pieces, and read; viz.: "I'll come to-morrow. Be sartain not to go out." "To-morrow,' said Snarler, " the very thing. Let's see what day 'tis? Ah! there's the time in his handwrite. He  wrote yesterday, and said he was a coming to-day. He cum "  to-day, and I've catched him by this.!' He read on: "When we are married, and I am a happy man, I'll ask your jailor no odds." "Married!" muttered Snarler, and the idea struck him with amazement. "Married'! Zounds, by the. smoke of the pit, if the fellow is driving arter that, I won't run my fence across the road. No, indeed, he may put in a double team, atd I'll see the coast's clare. But let me read this over again."     v   -  vsu X .      21 "When we are married and I am a happy man, I'll asL your jailor no odds." "Zounds! by the smoke, 'tis jist as I read it.

It was a letter from Euphy's mother, arler's sister, and who was perhaps, the only person that arler cared for half as well as himself. T hat one spot his heart had no ice, and showed he was akin to his :d. The letter spoke of Euphy s only a mother could--   22        PILATE AND HEROD. then of the mother's ill and fast-failing health; and, in terms that must have cost tears to write, commended the childto his care. "Be kind to my baby,--think of me when you do for her. I shall soon be cold, and can do nothing for her." Snarler's eyes became dim, and he pushed the letter from him. After a while he resumed it, and read on: ' If my dear child should have failings, remember, Tom, that we all have faults; and forgive them for my sake; and think at the time you are not forgiving her, but a sister who took and raised you after our mother was dead." "I will," said Snarler, with difficulty finding words. I'll take her home!" The letter- proceeded: "We shall meet no more in this world. Oh! do not forget to love and do'for my poor motherless child, when I am dead and gone! and depend on it you will have the prayers and blessings of your loving but dying sister, ,*        -C .EUPHEMA." A sigh escaped from the bosom of Snarler. Heyralsed his hand to his eyes, and wiped away a tear. "Well, well," said he, "I must let her have her own way. I'm a very, very fool--" and he seemed to choke a little. ' I'll do what she asked me in her dying moments, poor crittur! I wish Euphy was here." Folding, up the papers, and tying them carefully, he put them away. a Jim!" bawled out Snarler. "Yes, sir-yes, massa," answered the negro, from the kitchen, coming to the house. "Euphy must come home by sunrise. Hear!" "Poor massa! poor massa! all aint right with him," muttered Jim. And all was not right; but one thing was- and this love for his sister, showed that, even Snarler was not totally depraved, nor an incarnate fiend. .!   CHAPTER   XVI.

Scientific discovery and philosophic research have done much to disabuse men's minds Of the grovelling superstitions and infantile imbecility connected with the spiritual world, and the danger now is that we may run into the Sadducean heresy of denying a futre existence, and a   resurrection of the dead. We would tneither afirm nor deny the existence of ghosts. What the ancientjffews believed, as is evident from the parable of Lazarus what the Greeks maintainedo as is proved by the story of Simonides what the modern Italians admitted, as appears from the ghostly revelation about the misng cantoof the Divina Comedia, and what our ancestors generally believed, as is clear from the strane stories of ghostts which have come down to us, cannot be wlaly false or unfounded. When we ind, as here, the quod semper  i and the quod ubique, two out of the three charosc-. teristics of truth, we should pause, and hesitate a long time before we reiect.  the things of the spirit are spiritually discerned, is true in more than on- sense  e   may be very rational, or rather rationalistic, very sensible, or rather very physical,  and while sure not to err in the ventures of t, w may close every window that could let an  li ght whatever in upon the soul.

The telescope cannot inform us about the spiritual world, neither can the stupid spiritual rappers tell us any thing of it; yet that world is vast, and compared to the world of sense "as a continent against a cabage garden." And because we cannot pass out of the cabbage garden, let us not, sage- like, put on a knowing look, and say we have looked over the  I palings, and find there is; iothing outside. As "the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times, and the turtle, the crane, and the swallow, observe the time of their coming," even so sihould m'an kp'w or have faith in that better land to which he is to migrate. We know not what we are, how we are, and wlhat and how'we shall be, but to us as it has been to others, it may eventually be given to discern through the clouds a star here and there, and, by their discovery, to light ourselves on to a further knowledge, and in time, imore and more openings may be discovered, till we shall stand with a clear sky over head, and the vast hea- vens of glowingm truth shall be seen shining down-undimmed, ",not a star obscured."  The ladies mentioned, however, in our story, may be par- doned for being more credulous than ladies in the same class are apt to be in our day, Mrs. Annie particularly, as she was not wholly free from that slavish state in which "' Faith, fanatic faith once wedded fast To some dear falsehood, hugs it to the last.' Her mind had been painfully exercised' on the subject of Iomanism:, Her brain at times seemed to be addled by the questions which perplexed it; and her nervous system was in such state that any hallucination was more than possible. What we wish, we are very apt to believe. When we have made up our minds that God by a miracle will enlighten us, a miracle is nearly as good as forthcoming; we see what, with our ready credulity, passes for one. It is possible, and no doubt occasionally happens, that such persons see what we never can and never may. St. Stephen unquestionably, as he was dying, "saw the heavens open, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God."  St. Paul was unquestionably taken up into the third heavens, and saw things too glorious to be revealed. A good man now may have revealings of God that are only less wonderful than the   JsLA UnlAJu VA16AUiNG      25 fire which burnt in the bush out of which God spoke to Moses, and the light from heaven, beyond the brightness of the midday sun, which smote Saul of Tarsus with blindness. A spirit like Nathaniel's will be apt, and indeed certain, to see heaven open, and angels ascending and descending. "Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams," was the promise to the children of the Church of the First Born. But, as spectral lights hover over graves, and are believed to be mere luminous vapours of the earth, earthy, so lights as lurid and unheavenly often pass for such as shone to Moses and St. Paul, and visions that are the hallucination of distempered fancies and over-wrought sensibility, pass for true and veritable angel visits, and peeps of dawn into the glorious day which after death is to burst upon us. And no better than a distempered hallucination was that we are about to record. It was at the twilight hour; Mrs. Annie was at her resi- dence, Elfin Hall. Her friends, Emma and Julia, were below stairs, and Mrs. Annie, having felt unwell that afternoon, had retired for a few moments to her chamber. She rose from her couch, suffering from much more than an ordinary depression of mind. While sitting on the bed, in a painful reverie, and looking, she knew not where, the dim and shadowy outlines of a female form passed between her and the window, It was but a moment, and the figure was gone. With some difficulty Mrs. Annie rose, and pale with emotion and tremulous, she tottered out of the room, and descended the stairs. Her friendS discovered that something had hap- pened, and, soon as Mrs. Annie found words, were told by her that she had seen the blessed virgin. This declaration startled them, and was said so earnestly, and was so evidently credited by Mrs. Annie, that they were puzzled what to think of it. For, at that early day, it was not known that physical causes, as Mrs. Annie's indisposition, a diseased state of mind, (her anxiety about her rather equivocal state, hovering between the see of Rome and the Church of Eng- land,) were sufficient, with darkness or the twilight hour, to make her see a shadowyform, and so impress her imagina- tion, (impressible as it was to the merest incident,) as to clothe and shape this shadowy form into the blessed rirgin. 'It cannot be," said Rimma. mentally, "though Annie believes it. " It may be so," thought Julia, and her imagi- nation, taking this as a starting point, made an incursion into VOL. II.--   26        PILATE AND HEROD.     : the world of possibilities. For Emma was freer from super- stitious weakness than either Julia or Mrs. Annie; though not altogether free from it; her Scotch education embracing superstitions as a part of it. To her, as to every other of Scotia's daughters, they were as household words, and as the lessons of childhood; and so rivetted, that reason afterwards could not break loose from them. However, from the weak- ness of a Roman devotee, Emma was wholly free, and her mind was steeled against any impression that came from Rome. Hence, she regarded Annie as under a pitiable de- lusion, and very kindly endeavoured to dissipate it. Her efforts were not fruitless. Annie after awhile was calm. She was afraid to doubt the report of her own senses; but was nearly willing to allow that the shadow might be some one other than the Virgin. Still this left an unpleasant dread on Mrs. Annie's mind, which Emma could not divest herself of entirely, and which Julia felt to some extent. A few days afterwards came St. Mark's Eve, (April 24,) and the three friends, with the recollection of this supposed vision of the Virgin fresh on their minds, were conversing on the old superstitions, which were connected with this eve, one of which was, if on St. Mark's Eve, you will watch at the church-porch from 11 o'clock at night, to one hour after midnight, and do so on the same night for three years suc- cessively, on the third year you would see the ghosts of all who are to die the following year enter into the church. If any stay in the church, they are to die during that time. If any come out, they will be sick, but recover. The other superstition was that, on St.-Mark's Eve, ashes should be sifted on the hearth, and there would be imprinted upon them the foot-tracks of such persons in the family as would die in the ensuing year.* Both superstitions were predi- cated on the belief that " coming events cast their shadows before," and that wraiths or doubles of persons are sometimes  seen not very long before their deaths. Old Lucretius' would have said this belief was very reasonable; as man was like an onion, ever throwing off his coat or superficies, or ..outer visible embodiment. The ancient philosophers and cabalists would have said that it was not impossible; as the astral spirit, which is above the sensuous one in us, can out * Vide "Popular Antiquities of Great Britain," by John Brand, M. A., Bohh's Edition, vol. I., pp. 192: for this and other superstitions qco9 nected with St. Mark's Day and the Eve before it '  a   ST. MARK S EVE.          27 of the atmosphere resolve a visible second self; and the vain Paracelsus, who asserted that his cap contained more know- ledge than all physicians, and the hair of his head had more experience than all the universities, might have confirmed this solution of the marvels on St. Mark's Eve. Man is very like man in all ages ; and the Church of Rome seemed to have sanctioned this opinion of being able to see one's second self shortly before death by the superstitions about St. Mark's Vigil. Annie very solemnly mentioned the fol- lowinP coincidence in her uncle's history, as if she believed it implicitly: "Poor uncle Harry was a wilful, though I can't say, a bad man. He was ever doing what few besides would have ventured upon. More from    recklessness, however, than from disbelief, he was bound to try the experiment.   For three years, one after the other, he with two other persons, who, like him, were wild and frolicksome, went to St. Mary's Church on St. Mark's Eve7 at the time of night mentioned. For two years they saw nothing out of the way. But on the third year--" and Mrs. Annie seemed to be afraid to go on. "What?" asked Julia. "H e  saw himself go ia church and there stay, and sure enough poor uncle died soon afterwards."  "This reminds me," said Julia, " of some   lines which were written by ml   dear father; and, being asked if she had them with her} and replying affirmatively, she took them out of her portmanteau, and read as follows: "On the hearth riddle well , The ashes, Then take a  shoe, and tell,' Whose step there on St. Markls night Was left ; for. if seen aright, - You the death of friend or foe May read; ere there will come and go Another year for you to try The ashes.

And, I remember, he compared them also to certain plants which- grow only in -wet and unwholesome climates; and in those shady places where the sun is shut. out." "So you think, Emma," said Julia, tartly, and not pleased at this assault upon superstitions which made certain parts of history so agreeable to her, and which gave an ample scope for her imagination to expatiate at wi ill; "  but I do not. These superstitions, as you call them, like mossy plants, are a graceful drapery to the tree of truth. Nothing so well as darkness, shade, and mystery set it off." Emma smiled, and said, "  You accept them all, eh!-You love mystery not for the truth covered under it, but for the mystery which conceals the truth, whether on St. Mark's Eve the wraiths of people soon to die are seen, or not, you do not care, if it be a fact, out of which good may come, or a lesson be learned; but as a peg to hang an argument, or a fancy tale on." "What if I tell you I believe this story about St. Mark's Eve?" replied Julia. ' I do," said Annie, faintly. "No, no, Annie, Julia," said Emma, quickly. "My uncle and his friends saw these wraiths," said Annie, firmly, but sadly. "Well,t replied Emma, "why should Julia say so? As for myself I love sunlight, I love to know where I am. I want none of this mystery. When I travel I look out for a clearing, or settlement, a something to assure me that I am where there is life, and where I can see human beings like myself." "I can't think so," said Julia, playing with the candle, and asking Annie to observe that the winding-sheet, fell on her side. "Superstition is a, pretty dress under which truth is veiled. Emma knows as well as I do0 that God throws a mystery around every thing. Now who may lift this robe of mystery, and look under it? and who espe- cially can say which is the robe, and which the figure it hides?"- As Julia spoke, the wind through a broken glass blew up the curtain at the other end of the room. The friends invol- untarily started, and Emma, availing herself of the ciroum- stance, said: "There is something meant in the lifting of that curtain I 3*   30        PILATE AND HEROD. Truth we never know, according to Julia. There is a mys- tery in the lifting of that curtain we cannot see." "Perhaps it was a ghost!" interrupted Julia. "Only think so, and we shall soon see it to be so," con- tinued Emma. "There may be," said Julia, seriously. "Oh hush, Julia!" interrupted Mrs. Annie. Your serious manner is enough to frighten one." "It may be a ghost," continued Emma, smiling; " for the wind and ghosts are alike, -bih being things that come and we cannot say how. Iow is it, Julia?" looking at her friend. "I am serious," replied Julia, returning her friend's look by one of earnestness. "Fy, fy! Julia," continued Emma. a Why the thought that certain beings are around me, who have come up from the other world, and are watching my movements,-scowl- ing upon me perhaps at times, who may possibly some night make themselves known to me, who hover in grave-yards, and haunt certain houses and places where dark deeds have been done, is not pleasant." ", You won't say is not true?" interrupted Julia. ("I say nothing where I know nothing," cautiously replied Ermma; r' but why think about what you can turn to no good end?" "Moralize as you please," said Julia, and there seemed to be a resolution on her mind; 1C but I must---" and not explaining herself, she went to the other part of the room. Emma knew not how to unriddle her words, though it occurred to her that Julia meditated something, possibly was serious, and possibly was under the influence of a freak- ish humour. She looked at Annie for an explanation, who, likewise struck by Julia's manner, was puzzled to compre- hend it. She however attached more meanihg to it than Emma, and anxiously watched to see what the denouement would be. Commanding herself as well as she could, she replied: "1 am not in Julia's secret." Impulsive and imaginative persons always act strangely. When they ire extremely so, their conduct is as inexplica- ble as that of the insane; and at times the quietest and most common-sense individual, one who departs least from   ?             JULIA'S ADVENTURE. the normal routine of the right and sensibly, has been known to act very like a comet, and worse even than a comet, to move in an orbit so eccentric that we cannot trace it by calculations. Julia, on reaching the end ofhe e room stopt, and whether she had formed any fixed purpose, or what it was, is not known; but she stopt. The scene out of doors, the moon just rising, appeared to have arrested her attention; and she leaned out of the'window, and gazed for some minutes. A shadow passed under the trees in the garden; the substance from which it was projected she did not see. She heard a voice, and a groan. She started, but -t   bent over to see if she could get a glimpse of the speaker. She saw no one, but just caught a sight of the shadow of some- thing that was passing round the corner of the garden. Whether Julia meditated an adventure or not, she now had one; and excited not very pleasantly, she hurried back to her friends, and with a face and manner very significant communicated rather what she did not, than what She did see, and what she thought than what she knew. And digressing off into, how strange it is that we are surrounded by so much that we do not understand,--that shadows pass at times whose bodies we see not,--that noises are heard where speakers and actors are not visible,-she added, that' Milton must have referred to such mysterious agency, when he spoke of "The airy tongues that syllable men's names On shores, in desert-sands, and in wildernesses." And the three friends, by a natural transition, were dissect- ing the monkish legend of St. Dunstan; e g., that which states he went to Glastonbury church, where he first chaunted an anthem, and then hung his harp upon the wall. The saint next busied himself in sketching the design of a church or ecclesiastical vestment; but, lo! his harp, though suspended to the wall was played upon by invisible hands which kept up the anthem he had just sung  "Now;" said Julia, " though I would call this a beauti- ful incident in St. DDunstan's life, you would say it iv a monkish fable." "What more i"' asked Emma, trying to smile. "I   am very serious," continued Julia.  "There are or may be persons about us we know nothing of. I like St. Dunstan' story exceedingly. It may have been exactly so,"   hid and Julia, with her mind full of the wonderful, and excited too by the incident which occurred at the window, expressed her views to some extent, speaking rapidly at times, and then pausing as if to catch breath, and then talking slow and mysteriously, as if the thoughts she was uttering required or imposed this mode of speaking. While thus busied, her fingers unconsciously were turning over her portfolio, which contained sundry lots of paper, on which she had at different times written verses on whatever subjects presented them- selves. "What is this?" asked Emma, taking up some sheets that appeared to have been recently blotted by the pen. Another ballad, perhaps?" "No," replied Julia, blushing slightly, and restoring the paper to the portfolio, out of which it had fallen. Emma saw enough to awaken her curiosity, and Julia yielding the paper to her, Emma read as follows: "In Glastonbury church, they say, Holy Dunstan went one day, In saintly song his voice to pour, And touch his harp so well and true, As he of living men best knew Its melody and power.  His harp he hung upon the wall, His holy vestments he took off, Fie on wicked tongues who scoff! That he upon his knees should fall, And, plying fast the needle, trace On vestment for the sacred place, Symbols holy and colours bright, To shadow forth, as best he might, Mysteries above the ken And searchings of mortal men. "But. still the vision on his mind, Too faintly grew for him to find His wonted skill to work aright, And'shadows dark before him passed; St. Dunstan-started, 'Is it night? Or are my eyes now failing fast ' He made upon his breast and brow, Of holy cross the wondrous sign; And strange! there's no dimness now. While hues that in the rainbow shine, Which arches o'er the Father's throne, Its mingled glories on him shone, And symbols holy, quick were traced In colours such as have not graced The priestly robe, but when, of old, u;5    More dazzling than the burnished gold, Sapphlre stone, or emerald's blaze, Aaron stood in the holiest place.   JULIANS POEM.          33 "And stranger still than all, I ween, The harp was swept by hands unseen, For an angel choir then lent ! I    Its music to the instrument, And in the anthem which was sung, Prolonged good Dunstan's saintly song, And, by the airs which upwards roll'd, Gave force unknown to Dunstan's soul, Changed into day the seeming night Whose shadows dimm'd his failing sight, Call'd by the sign which Dunstan made When he implored Almighty aid." "Julia wrote this,' said Annie, " after she andI had been reading an odd volume of the lives of the saints. For some days we could think of almost nothing else, and Father Canon prevailed upon her to write off her feelings and ideas about it." The two, Annie and Julia, now bantered Emma, and insisted she could do as well, perhaps better. Emma, glad that the minds of her friends were engaged in less gloomy and unpleasant subjects, was willing to do her part towards giving a right view of Dunstan, and, being urged, set about complying. Julia smiled the meanwhile and said, We have Emma every day in prose, we shall see her in a new dress now. I'll undertake it becomes her." 'As much," replied Emma, looking up from the paper before her, "as a countryman would in the tawdry-dress they now use for a prince in the theatre." "We'll make al allowances," said Annie, "so dismount now from your trotting nag of common sense." "And mount one," interrupted Julia, "that will carry you as gaily as would Mr. Montrose's Selim." 'Yes, and be thrown for my folly," said Emma, writing as'she spoke.  "She has done it, and there's no mistake about it," said Julia, snatching the paper, afraid Emma 'would not allow them to read it. And without waiting for her friend's .on- sent, whose silence and non-interferenc. implied it, Julia read it. The lines ran thus: "Like Dunstan, let it be our care The fitting robe always to wear: The: robe unstained by mortal sin That's bright without, and clean within, The robe whose symbols shadow here The robe we hope in heaven to wear. Hope in the anchor, showing clear, We dread no storm While Christ is near; Faith in the shield that will repel The shafts of Satan and of hell;   34        . PILATE AND HEROD.

She said, ina broken way, that in Coode's house, which was in sight of Elfin Hall, and on Elfin Creek, during Mrs. Annie's absence from home, strange sights had been seen, and noises heard. "Seen and heard when?" was the question. "& At night, come hours after sundown" was the answer. , The servants on the Elfin Hall estate returning home at night from -fishing, passed close by Coode's late mansion, and they agreed in having seen and heard a strange light and noises up stairs. The light was represented to have ;been at times brighter- than a 'candle, and again a mere glimmer, which through a shutterless window they had seen on the wall. The noise, they said, was that of feet pacing up and down the loor and once it was thought they heard the tones of a man's voice. And this report was narrated by the girl with all that circumstantiality and marvellous- hess, pausing occasionally to make an exclamation, which made it more interesting. "Can this be so?" asked Emma, amazed. A    solemn asseveration, expressed with a simplicity that showed, if deceiving others, she was herself deceived, gained their con   SPIRITS.          35 fidence, but did not add to their pleasurableness of feeling. What could hav e produced the light? Whence came it? What did it bode? Was it from a poor soul condemned to move about- this its former earthly sojourn?  Or was it a minister and demon of wrath, a foul fiend that, in conjunction with others as foul, here, had a melancholy, profitless, and tormenting sojourn? hovering as a shadow over places where it was to know no more enjoyment, itself an unsubstantial vapour, its hopes as bodiless, and its light not that of the just which shineth more and more unto the perfect day; but a lurid glimmer, prophetic of those flames in which the lost should wail in torment forever, while the smoke of the pit would forever ascend! These, and like questions, were started, and the friends shuddered as the thoughts suggested called up images s6 fearful.          , ,' '    i1 #            .   CHAPTER XVi1. COODE'S BUIR-FBFARB Of A NIGHT ATTACK. Superstition. "Thou taintest all thou look'st upon! The spirits of the air, the shuddering ghost, The genii of the elements, the powers That give a shape to nature's varied works, Had place and lifein the corrupt belief e     Of thy blind heart."  THE place known as Coode's ruin, had been the residence of the noted John (oodet who is mentioned by Parson Gor- don and' Father Canon m   their letters, and who, as they stated, took for years a i active part in the opposition to the proprietary's government. In this house, in days gone by, Coode had both caroused with his boon companions and political partizans, and concerted with them those measures which led to "the Protestant Revolution in Maryland." The tide of popular favour at length turned. Coode fell into disgrace; deservedly, for his misconduct, say all the chroni- clers of that day, and was constrained to fly to- Virginia. His house was seized, and would have been sold, if Snarler, who had formerly been one of his proteges, had not bought it in for him. After a few years he returned, but his laurels, once green and flourishing, were now tarnished and dead. He was a mortified and degraded man, and so conscious of hisW low estate that he went out no more openly, and was seen, it was said, only by companions whose fortunes were 'aesperate and dark as his own. A portion of these com- panions, it was believed, were the buccaniers, who put in here after reaping heavy booties on the Spanish main, and, as Coode's name was in bad odour, especially with the Roman population, for his prominency in "the Protestant Revolution," it was further said of him that his house was the refuge or resort of beings that were - Unfit for earth, undoom'd to heaven." 36   COODE'S RUIN. At length the neighbours 'neither saw nor heard any thing of Coode, and by som'e it was believed he had gone to'his dread account. Still, ugly stories continued about his house. Lights at night weres^e a i t, and noises were heard toscome frpm it. But for some time these lights ceased to be-seen and these noises to be heard. From the negro girl's state. ment, however, just given, these fearful things connected with Coode's ruin, had returned, and the report sent a thrill of anxious fear through the sensitive frame of Mrs. Annie. Sile and her friends made further inquiries of the girl, and they were told that, ever since Mrs. Annie's absence from home, the neighbourhood had been disturbed. A Mrs. Doolittle, Doolittle's aunt, had been much annoyed; especially an Irish girl Katy, living with her. aty had night. aty now slept or tried to sleep, with a light always burning in her room. but een   then the unearthly visitant thou vhibT      then, oypenitand though-less visible than before, would enter, disturb some- thing in the room, and, after causing her much alarm, would disappear.  The   next day, alarmed herself, and seeing how much Annie was alarmed, and Julia was excited, Em mi the view of removing this unpleasant state) proposed a visit to oode ruin; remarking it i day, ghosts do notiappear but at night, and perhaps we may trace other and less alarming causes for these lights and noises than we think. Julia caught at the suggestion at once; but Mrs. Annie protested it was madness to think of it, anid a madness she could not give into. And it was only till the day had advanced past noon some time, that the friends succeeded in overoming Annie's resolution.-  It was a  pleasant afternoon; the air agreeable and IV ing, and every thing seemed favourable to enjoyment.  their way they saw two persons approaching, and to avoid enm   the ladies turned, a little aside from the road to a. spring.  "Sure enough here come  Mr. Doolittle and that strange parson," said Mrs. Annie;  "they have been to Mrs. .oe. ittle's, and, as I hear, th e y ag ree so e2actly in their religiou s P inions, it m ust have been a pleasant visit all round."' vo0.    II.-4         /,  l   38         PILATE AND   ERBOD. Julia laughed, and said it reminded her of a remark she had-fheard, which was ascribed to Father Canon.    "Mr. Alltgr e must needs be a godly man; for doesn't godliness cousistBin never giving into the siui4&aughing, or creature comforts; but in sighs and sobsi in groans and grimaces, in cross words and looks, and in ratinthe world for its pomps and vanities?  Sure he and his coiscience can't be right; for is he not doing penance- all the time?, If he lived the other side of sixty, he might possibly have less purgatory hereafter to suffer than the:murderer of Servetus.  He and the like of him have a part of their purgatory here." "Well, Julia," said Emma, walking a little in advance of her friends, and turning round and addressing Julia, "here's a riddle for you-'what ugly and venomous animal is not Mr. Allgrace like F" "I should say he was like the toad," replied Julia, quickly, a one carries a -precious jewel in its head, the other has the jewel of setting off by his ugliness of character every good man Iaround him." The friends now could see that the puritans were riding slowly, and heard Allgrace, solemnly, say: "These prelatic clergy are not like Paul, all things to all men. To rags of popery and dead forms, and Amoritish trappings they cling as much as Jesuited priests.    For preaching and praying the black gown so suits the minister.* * We are told by Maimonides, that the'ancient Jewish priest, whose genealogy was at all suspcious8, was dressed in black robes, and dis- missed the company of the priests; black being a mark of disgrace, while the priest, whose descent was indisputable; was clothed in white, and allowed to officiate. (See Horne on the Scriptures, 3d vol.) For the first sixteen hundred years after Christ, no one in holy orders was robed in black; white being always a symbol of purity, and the dress of the clergy. Dr. Adam Clarke the learned Methodist commen. tator, on St. Matt. xxviii. 3, remarks that the angel, who rolled back the stone from our Lord's sepulchre, being in "raiment white as snow," "was clothed in garments emblematical of the glad tidings which he came to announce. It would have been inconsistent with the message he brought, had the angel appeared in. black robes, such as those pre- posterously wear, who call themselves his successors in the ministry of it once suffering, but now risen and highly exalted Saviour. But the world is as mll of nonsense as of sin ; and who can'correct and bring it to reason andpiety ." The puritans always objected to the surplice; first publicly at Hampton Court in the reign of James I., and next at the Savoy Conference at the Restoration; deeming it and the cross in bap- tisma the ring in marriage, observance of holy days, and kneeling at-the Lord's Supper, as things not to be borne with. And to this day, puri- tans in and out of the church evince a weakness, and at times a mania, in opposition to the surplice. With them thie pure white surplice, which colour God Himself enjoined, and His church has ever used and which coldur angels and redeemed saints are in His word said to wear, and which Adam Clarke judged so' scriptural and emblematic of the glad tidings of the Gospel, is an evil of no small magnitude, '\     ELPIN CREEK.       -   39 Ah I it proves that our hearts are filled with a godly sorrow and that, like the turtle dove we go mourning up an&do-ew, the land; bearing in  I, brother, ' there is no peace "to die wicked,' yes, and treimlg 'too lest some snare of the devfl, or the spirit not bo a more powerful than the flesh, or lest some pomp ,an:ity } of which there are, alas I too many in our journe ythrough the wilderness, may lead us astray after and in ungodly pleasure taking." On rode the worthies, denouneing popery and prelacy, and probably our fair friends, while drinking of the refreshing spring, congratulated themselves that they heard no more of the senseless and windy clatter that fanatical and kettle drum heads are apt to make, when they knock together in tete-a-tete. The ladies had now reached the shore of Elfin Creek; and the view, though familiar, was seen with una- bated pleasure.  Wordsworth would have said of it. "Itis a beauteous evening, calm and-free, The holy time is quiet as a nun, Breathless with adoration." The creek lay before them as a mirror, whose clear sur- face. no breath had tarnished. It was shaded by lofty trees, which arched over so as nearly to overlook their branches. The woods were voiceless, and the spot seemed so sweet as to be rather the picturing of,poetic fable than of rugged na- ture; and, if amid the deep and embowering shade, a skiff had quietly advanced, an observer would have said, Here comes the genius loci and fair spirit into whose fairy domain I have intruded, On a  slight elevation, throwing the shadow of its profile on the deep blue waters below, stood Ooode's ruin. No other dwelling was in sight, and the fence and outhouses, which may have imparted an air of comparative-comfort and of living to the spot, had all disappeared. Solitude, it seemed, had here erected her seat, and waved coldly and mutely over it her oblivious sceptre; while of the old iman- sion, the name appeared to be Ichabod.  For deserted it seemed. Its window-panes were shattered. Its outer doors were open or stood ajar, and the building itself was fast falling to decay. High and rank grass was matted over the brick pavement. Briars, bushes and weeds nearly barred up the entrance; and a fox passed out of the back door, as Emma and  her companions stood on the front threshold. f'   40        PILATE AN   HEEROD. Here they paused, and simultaneously, and -without concert, each 6ne hesitated, fearful to penetrate further. "If any one 9or thing dwells here, which might hurt us," reflected Emma, " unless it be' a beast of the6forest, who has made it his lair, this person or thing is here fr no good." And she thought of Coode's desperate charactel' a disorganizer in pol- itics, and in religion an infidel; and this thought gave to the spot the fearful tinge of ita own impress.  a Do, do I let us get away?' said Mrs. Annie, feeling faint at heart. Julia said nothing; being swayed by conflicting feelings, and held equipoised by them. a No-wait a moment," asked Emma, with assumed calm- ness. "You and Julia stay here ;" and IEssing in at once, Emma hoped to acquire confidence as she proceeded. She surveyed the room to the right, and next a large closet that opened into it; and thus she saw nothing to alarm her be- yond the unpleasant grating of the door upon the hinges, and the flutter of some birds of night, which she had startled from their coverts. The room to the left she could notpopen easily. Emmapushed against it,-harder yet- still harder-and, growing bolder, pushed with -all her might. The door gave way, instead of opening, and fell partially in, and Emma fell with it into the room. As she was rising-trembling a little from the incident-she caught a glimpse of a man who was passing into a closet near the fire-place. - She rose hastily, and tried to get out; but the door the mean while had either swung back by its own gravitation, or been pushed back by some one. Emma looked around the room, hoping to find another way of escape, and trembled lest the closet-door might open, and the man who entered it, might spring out upon her. But the windows were very high from the floor; too high for her to get out by them. With a feeling of desperation, she endeavoured to pull open the door, and this time she succeeded in forcing it open; and the door as before fell in, She recovered herself, however, and hastened out. She found Annie at the door, as pale as a sheet, ,and trembling as the aspen. "Where is Julia " asked lEmma, amazed. Annie wrung her hands, and with difficulty said, . She has gone, and unless we fly the spot we shall be put out of the way too ;" starting to run, but from fright, tottering as an infant. "Not without Julia," said Emma; thought of self being   A 'GHOST.          41 merged into anxiety for her friend. "Who took her away?" she continued, wonderstruck at Annie's enigmatical Annie groaned; and said sorfesthing, not very intelligible, about Julia's walking to the corner of the house, there meet. ing a man, and with him disappearing. Emma pressed her iand to her -heart; and between fear about Julia, anxiety about Annie's situation and her own, being at the mercy of whom she could not conjecture, and perplexity as to what all this mystery could portend, she cold devise and think of no solution or way of remedy. At that instant Julia, with wildness in her face, manner, and movements, ran towards them, and, without saying a word, motioned to them to hurry homeward. The three, without exchangng a word, hastened to Elfin Hall, whose threshold they reached in half an hour; and which never was as welcome to them before. After they -had entered, Julia sa down, looking pale anxious, and troubled.             , "What is the matter?" asked Emma and Annie. "I have seen the dead!" replied Julia, shaking as she spoke; and surveying the room anxiously. "What dead 'P-asked Emma, fearful that her reason might be affected.  "My father!" speaking wildly. a, The same I heard from the window." "He's alive, then," said Emma, trying to be calm, and continuing, he spoke to you " Yes, shaking as she answered. I knew is fac e- his voice--and felt, I'm sure, his breath, the pressure of his hand, his kisses even. At last, asI was recovering, he passed into the house, by a door, near the chimney and I fled; the whole seeming a dream."  d The n amer " said- Emma thoughtfully, and- detailed her dventure.  It ould not be Cooder oode's ghost. If Mr. Delafield, it was not a ghost.- If a ghost, and his, why meet his daughter in such a place? Might not Julia be mis- ken? She was toq positive to admit such a supposition."' The friends'took their tea nearly in silence; and with night came the sickly hue of unhealthy musings. As darkness throws its mantle over us, the wisest and most fearless see things through theo mist of mystery; and objects loom upon the imagination gigantic and fearful. 4*   42        PILATE AND HEROD. "What time of the night," Emma inquired again, "are lightsaseen in Coode's ruin t" "Some time fore dis, and den later again," answered another servant woman, wfho was in the room. "Are they to be seen all night?" Ma No," was the reply. i "I suppose we may see the lights from one of the garret rooms," turning to her hostess. "Let us go there." Both Annie and Julia objected, unwilling to make any further investigations. 'Oblige me," continaied Emma; "I think it may be very important," and seeing the two yet unyielding, " even to our safety to-night." The friends looked amazed and frightened at this remark, but yielded. From a garret win- dow they had a good view of Coode's ruin. Thei stars: were shining brightly, and the moon, night's glorious lamp, w beamed kindly down. The ruin was seen standing 'in quiet loneliness on the left bank of Elfin Creek. The night was as calm as had been the afternoon. While they sat glzing, and, in despite of their uneasiness, admiring the silver shining bosom of the creek, and hearing no noise but thee melancholy cry of the whippoorwill; and, fearing they would see the dreaded lights shining from out one of the upper windows, Emma became more and more satisfied it was due to their sfety- to unravel early as possible the mys- tery of Coode's' ruin; and she was also satisfied it either was the resort of supernatural beings, or of desperate und dangerous characters. "Oh P'tnma! Look, Julia! Jesus I Mary! have mercy on us!" exclaimed Mrs. Annie. The -two friends looked where Annie pointed, and saw as moving light in one of the upper rooms of Coode's ruin. Emma immediately hurried down stairs. "Uncle Jack," addressing a faithful domestic in the kitchen, " is this light often seen?" "Lately, every night, Missus." "Wht is it? Who is' moving about?" she asked. "Ah! missus," shaking his head, {'dem be somebody me and you mustn't trouble. Fore God! I only hope dey won't come here." ' I hope soi too," continued Emma; "but, old man, I fear there are people yonder who must be kept froml here."   COODE'S RUIN. "' "ell, missus, what can we do? y! missus; humble servant want to know. Us keep dem off!" and he chuckled at her apparent simplicity. "If dey perspires to come here can we perspire to keep dem off?"' And Jack, ooking proudly on his fellow servants, continued: Who keep dem i     o/'?ff Gates, bars, and loks do no good. Dey ome right in. Guns no shoot dem. Dogs won't bite, but run away when dey see dem." "Well, uncle Jack, tell the overseer" who had the management  of the farms, to have all the hands in to- Li ' ' night." Jack laughed at the simplicity of this order. "All in missus. Nigger too skeared to go out now" Wmell,' continued Emma,  " det them keep watch in the kitchen.  Keep the dogs in the yard." Having given these orders, Emma, aware of rs. Annie's want of nerve to attend to such mafters, endeavoured to ascertain that the doors and windows were all seoured* for the house was strongly built of logs, had massive doors and heavy shutters, and was something between-a fortress and a residence;-a kind of building then very common and a kind which may be necessary again should the lawlss  lence in our cities travel out in the oun vtry. Having made these preparation,, n  on her return' communicated with she had done asoon after he nd her friends retired to their ohambers,to sleepif they could present Power, than in their stout castle,; and faithful ser. vants and dogs. But, in the two chambers which the ladies occupied, -lights, were kept burning.

Emma dreamed that she was wandering in Coode's ruin, and as she advanced, snakes, scorpions, and vipers crossed her path, and bats and owls flew from their hiding places, and the last screeched most frightfully. She came to a closet, the same in which she saw a man secrete himself. She opened it, and saw standing against the wall a skeleton. It occurred to her that this was the body of John Coode, and, -horror-appalled, she essayed to turn away, when -the ,   fleshess relic of what was once a man stept out from the closet, and stood before her. She looked again, and the figure was clothed with flesh, dressed as and looking the pirate, armed with pistols and a dagger. He waved to her to follow ^him. She started to run, but found the door closed, she looked to the windows, but they were barred; she rushed up-stairs by a stair-way leading to the room just over head. On reaching the room, she found it full of irates, and dressed with a black flag, which was pointed tii- a -deathi$?-:ad' a battle-axe, and an hour-glass. In 3the middle othi-;oom was a table, on which was a bowl of blood,w    ge men, with dark, shaggy beard, each -with glass: af nd full of- blood, (the buccanier mode of :oaaSirt mga I Fidishi eomntract to kill and steal in concert, and ithhen kee^o-ift: about it,) were pledging each other, and . ttering at ithe  6 i itime the most horrible imprecations. the affrighted   liurned. to descend as she came up; but the stair-case gave -way. There was a crash, then a yell went up from the revellers above. "All hell is here," cried out a voice; and Emma, in a paroxysm of fear, sat upright in her bed. A minute or two elapsed before she could sufficiently collect herself to know where she was. She rose from her bed, and kneeling down devoutly asked the Divine protection. As she was returning to bed, she thought she heard a noise. "Can it be possible," was her reflection, "that Julia and Annie are still awake and talking?"She opened her chamber door, and passing quickly to the oppo- site room, where they had retired, she gently entered. A lighted taper W^s on the mantel-piece, and Annie and Julia were asleep r; Julia seemed to be, however, agitated by feelings which were hardly less violent than those Which had woke her, The transparent complexion of Julia was as highly flushed) as if she had a burning fever, while she tossed herself about in the bed as if she were racked by'   JULIA'S DREAM.          45 45 pain, making all the time incoherent mutterings. Emma gazed at her thoughtfully, Baying to herself, "Poor child I She is perhaps suffering what I have been just' delivered from. I will wake her."s She bent over the bed, meaning to touch Julia gently, and to call her in a soothing tone. Annie, who la close to her at that moment sat upright, and, throwing he arms about  - - . -  o  -,wins nr arms about Emma, exclaimed, "Holy Mother! pray for us F" Emma shrunk back as if something unearthly had touched her.  Strange! said Emma to herself; "I must believe I fear, in spite of myself, that evil beings or unearthly spirits, are around us."  She was now alarmed by the evi- dent sufferings of Julia; when she saw   Annie's rosary, which was suspended over her head, and to which was ap- pended, as usual, a cross.  "It can't be," thought Emma, ':that this dumb string of beads, though it may have been blessed by a  priests, bishop's, or even the pope's pratr' could save Annie from Julia's sufferings andmine. For sfie seems not to be easy."          - She made a  second effort to waken Julia, 'wOse-ineoherent mutterings alarmed and distressed he, .and'wa -s; i'the acte of touching her, when she heard nolses beiow:.i[a feefiNg, next to suffocation came over her. oway between mid night and morning,  and, except ;  be1low  st11ness reigned out of doors; and what os"' i ed  her'was that the noise did not seem to proceed. from ithe kitchen but the water-side; and besides, with the 'sound of human voices indicating the presence of persons in the creek, she thought she could distinguish the splash of oars. "I My God!" she exclaimed, greatly alarmed, "my dream  and the events of to-night all bode no good. Julia! Annie!" shaking the sleepers, "wake  up-up." "Who ? What are   you ? Hah!" exclaimed Julia. Your friend ,   E nRm a. Oh! do be yourself--Annie! ,Annie'!  Yes, yes," paid Annie, "I'm ready." The two were at length awakened, and were briefly and gently asked by Entma to get up, and dressat once; for : ared that pirates, or some  night-prolero,w ere about a tack the house; that they were comihgin: the creek, perhaps had landed by this time, at the foot of the  garden  anAy--he wished their help in putting the  h  a tate of defenoufon                astate .of    "What can we do?" asked Annie, faintly and despond- ingly; "Oh! pray, don't say that they come from Coode's old house?' and she fell back in the bed. "But," continued Emma- " don't be alarmed. They are not spirits, or ghosts; something worse I fear.- I heard the splash of the oar. We must go down stairs, call up the overseer, and see that your man Jack, and the others I posted in the basement, are up; and then arm them the best we can." ) , Hardly conscious of what she was doing, Annie mechani- cally' followed Emma; while Julia followed, excited by the  occasion* her/dream, and the supposed spectre of her father. The overseer was roused, the, negro men called up, and the available' force of- /the establishment was mustered in the parlour   . : "What arms have you?" asked Emma quickly. "Two old swords,"' replied the overseer,- "which belonged ! to Captain Coode;" and his aguish face and manner showed that the name of Coode could hardly be syllabled by him. "What else?" asked Emma, impatiently. A gun and pistol," was his reply. "Good," trying to look bold, " have you any powder and  ball?"a "Yes," said Mrt. Annie, and she turned to a closet near by, and brought dtit:re ammunition than they were likely to want. The gun and pistol were carefully loaded. "Give me the pistol," said Emma. "Now there are but two doors opening into the yard. Do you think," addressing Jack, "that the doors and bars are stout enough to stand a heavy battering?"             '  I' No fear, rissus," trembling, " no fear of dem fleshhand bfood bokras, like Massa Prentis here, beating down dem' doors, or gittin in by dem dere shutters; ah! -but dese devils, dat's the thing, ky I dey come in any whar." I've no fears of any thing worse than flesh and blood," said Emma. "You think, Jack, there's no mistake about the shutters-?" "Gobd as doors, missus."' ; ;   ,r . No ladders out there to get up to the "' she as Jaki Sid he believed not.   . - Thus assured, Emma felt a little more comfortable, ink- ing, if she should be besieged that the besiegers mu!se uncommon force and alacrity to force their wtay in ,f-ore Lt  '   day-light. She gave her orders. Jack and a stout negro fellow were posted at the front door inside, each armed with an old sword, that had perhaps in former times been wielded by the valorous Captain Jobhn Coode against the proprie- tary and: his government.- The negroes had orders to cut down any body who shoul force open the door, and trT to enter; promising to each of them a handsome present at Whitsuntide holy day, if they behaved bravely. The over- seer, who now felt a blush of manly shame at the superior intrepidity of Emma to himself, a stout man, appeared to be anxious to make atonement. He took the gun, and said that he and the boy Tom, who had a large club, would guard the back door.                 g  "I will stand- in the passage," said Emma, holding the pistol in her right hand.  "I can shoot'aswell asthe nest one;" endeavouring  to seem  confident, 'oping to infuse confidence into her garrison. But het assertion was not ai:" idle bravado.  Her father had taught her the use of fire- arms; under the impression that, in the then unsettled state of the country, she might find this knowledge serviceable. Parson Gordon knew, too, that in order to repel the assaults of dastards, no matter with what intent they come, a gun wielded even by a woman will suffice. -The negroes, though armed and assured by kind words, and ERmma's calm voie,   . were tremulous from  fear, and Emma was about to despair of so craven a force when Annie, roused for the moment by the urgency, hastened to procure from a drawer a withered  branch  of palms, which she broke and distributed among them.

The overseer  was senout   THE ROBBERS ATTACKED.        49 saw a lantern, and a man with a hideous mask on the top of the ladder, "Shoot,!" said Emma, in a-commanding voice. The overseer seemed to be spell-bound. The negroes were paralyzed. Annie saw and heard but little. Julia started up, and wildly gazed upon the man with the mask.  Emma and- Adaratha alone were self-possessed. "I am too far off to shoot," said Emma. In a very brief time, before the overseer and: negroes could rally, three men with hideous masks on, entered into the passage. Their frightful aspects, their unknown' pur- pose, the suspicion that they were pirates, their supposed place of refuge, Coode's house, the almost certainty that they were armed, and must be more than a match for twice their number of ordinary men  (certainly superior to the little force she had around her;) and the terrible thought- that death was the least evil which menaced her friends and self,-all impressed Emma so painfully, that, for a moment, she nearly fell to the floor, and gave up all as lost. This dreadful thought, however, called back, from the necessity it showed of an immediate and desperate effort, the tide of life, and the resolution, which, for. once only, had for- saken her. "We can but -die," said the noble girl, "and welcome death." So saying, she levelled her pistol at the nearest of the three intruders, and fired. At- the same instant, with the agility of a cat, Adaratha sprang forward; and with a large knife wounded the next man, who fell about the same time that he' fell whom Emma had shot. To what extent they were wounded was not known. In the meanwhile, the third person, drawing a cutlass, advanced upon the overseer and negroes, who had now rallied, discovering they were fighting with flesh and blood.- The overseer was in the rear, and so situated that he could use his gun only as a club. This third intruder stood over the bodies of his fallen comrades, parried the ill aimed blows of the negroes, from two of whom he drew blood, and fought so skilfully and manfully that he seemed to be nearly a match for them. But now voices were heard out of doors. "We shall be too late;," said\ a voice. ', Hurry on." Emma and her friends had begun to entertain hopes. VOL. II.-5 1   50        PILATE AND HEROD. On hearing the new comers, they felt like abandoning themselves to despair, Julia perhaps excepted. She seized the pistol in Emma's hand, which had just bben reloaded, aimed at the third person mentioned, and fired. The ball glanced by his hat, and lodged in the passage wall. Quick, however, upon the noises came the speakers,- Montrose and Shepard, the latter being in advance. Annie screamed from excess of joy; and Emma- felt that never before had she found it so difficult to speak her gratitude to God. Montrose immediately waved his -hand to the overseer and negroes to retire, and, advancing to the supposed pirate, said: ' Well, captain, you have brought your valour to a fine port. Drop anchor-now, and quit the sea." Then laying his hand on the person whom Adaratha had stabbed, he continued, "Come, counsellor, have you no pleas to offer in arrest of judgment? This fellow," push- ing the one whom limma had shot " is, I fear, so far gone that Miss Euphy's smile could not bring him to life." Shepard laughed heartily, and said: "This is but 6one, only one of the ten thousand tricks of the mischievous god. He has got the counsellor here into a worse case than he ever manoeuvred an opponent into in court, and besides, after all, there is no Miss Evelin to wit- ness and reward his valour.

To night, at St. Mary's, I learned that Captain Fulford, Counsellor Brief, and Wil- liam Hackett, gentleman, had supplied themselves with masks, and gone in a boat to Elfin Creek.

The sailor could not say nay to one of Mrs. Annie's smiles. Refreshments -were brought out, the affairs of the night dis- cussed, and, before day dawned, the parties retired to refresh themselves with a little sleep. As. she withdrew to her chamber," How idle,' thought Emma, "Lare nine-tenths of the fears which keep us con- stantly alarmed!"  But, idle as are these fears generally, we will add, the events of that afternoon and night were calculated to chime in with superstitious apprehensions. Every thing had a supernatural aspect. Thus the adventure at Coode's ruin, and the lights which were seen in it at night, both of which were inexplicable by any reasoning they could command, and the disturbed dreams of Emma and her friends, though traceable doubtless to moral causes affecting 'the sleepers at the time, were materials from which superstition could easily build. Out of timber even more rotten it erects its'haunted ruin and its ghostly chamber.    H APTER XVIII. A .

"Are from repletion and complexion bred, From rising fumes of indigested food,. And noxious humours that infect the blood ; but supposed they were owing to the same intruder who would not let. Katy sleep., Katy's tale they thought most marvellous. There were three facts, however, mentioned by Katy, which puzzled them not a little, Wbile they ad- mitted the existence of troubled spirits, and believed as firmly in devils and diabolic agency in torturing people, be- sides leading them to sin, as did Baxter and the Puritans in Massachusetts, they could not understand how it could be that Katy should have heard the ghost say hbe was doomed to rove in a cold and dark place till his soul should find rest, nor how, when he laid his hand on Katy, the touch should have been as of ice, and they did not above all un- derstand how it could be, as Katy said, the ghost had asked a mass to be said for his soul in order that it might have rest. This ghost, said they, was a formal prelatist, or a mass Jesuit; and going to torment he should have been in the torment of fire-and fire supposes light and heat; how then could he be cold, or in darkness? His touch surely should rather have burnt her. Masses for the dead were, they were sure, contrivances of popery, and could do no good whatever. - Why then should the ghost ask what he must know was more than useless? Here were problems! that must be solved, and after vain efforts, they cut. short their disquisition about matters too deep for them, by saying that one of two conclusions must be the truth. Katy was a Romanist, and what she saw she may have coloured so as to favour her church; or if, being too truthful to do that, (as earnest and simple they knew her to be,) she told what she saw and heard, then the devil must have deceived her. Another question now disturbed the worthies. Would this troubled spirit let Katy alone at the instance of Father Canon; even should he say a mass for its soul, and then exorcise it Tfhe mass, they understood, Father Canon had said that firning at St. Inigoes'. The exorcism was now to finish Father Canon's laying of the troubled spirit. "a The prayer of a righteous man," said Allgrace, in his usual funerea  one, as the two were riding towards Mrs. Doolittles r'isdince, "availeth much.

Be not afraid, gentlemen, though a Jesuit priest, I have no power over you." So saying the priest rode on, and muttered to himself, "rI'll wager the Talmudists were right in saying that Father Adam had a wife, before he saw Mother Eve, and of her he had many children; all of whom with their posterity were devils; and the puritans in this way only can be connected to Adam, and the rest of mankind." The priest was received by the crowd before Mrs. Doolittle's door cordially and reveren- tially.  As he dismounted Colonel Smithson approached the jovial ecclesiastic, and with mock gravity, but in an under tone, said, "I am happy to meet your reverence on another hunt," "Thank you," was the reply, "' but I shall have better luck than you had, colonel." "Let your reverence beware," said the colonel, "you have a tougher stag to hunt down than the old hart: and, instead of chasing him to the water, he may drive you into this creek." "No fear of that," laughing as he replied, "I can keep him off by holy water, and if I find him very troublesome, why I have only to give him permission," pointing to All- grace and Doolittle. "To take possession of them," said the colonel, smiling. 'Yes, as Christ gave the devils permission to deal with the swine, who were feeding about the lake of Gennesaret," and, having so said, Father Canon entered the house. Colonel Smithson then turned round to Mr. Craft, the collector, and asked if they were not now about to witness one of Father Canon's freaks of humour? The collector looked surprised and hurt. "Oh don't tell me about' Father Canon, Mr. Craft," smiling. "He is too great a lover of fun to let go by a chance. I dare say he will act his part as solemnly in this farce as if he were acting a tragedy." "You forget, worthy colonel," replied the collector, flur- ried, and not liking the colonel's seeming impeachment of the exorcism office,' ithe Catholic Church accounts exor- cism one. of her most solemn offices." '"You misunderstand me, Mr. Collector, I mean no doubt of any office of the Catholic Church; but I know your   DIALOGUE.          57 worthy priest; and hang me, if I know a pleasanter man, or one who can make even the solemn minister to the agreeable. But, Mr. Craft, where do you get your doctrine of exorcism? We Protestants are very, perhaps much too ignorant on such matters." And the politic colonel spoke so modestly that the cautious collector was taken off his guard; flattered doubtless by the seeming deference of one so much his superior in society. Now Mr. Craft's tone of voice was peculiar, being soft, gentle, lamb-like, and nearly feminine. Shakspeare approved such a tone in woman, but some think in a man it is evincive of a want of manliness, and say it awakens the suspicion that the individual may resemble the cat in disposition no leas than in voice. We will not contend for the rule, but allow there may be excep- tions. Mr. Craft hesitated a moment, and then, rather to the colonel's amusement than edification, the collector mus- tered up the little he had read or heard on the subject. He referred to the apochryphal book of Tobit, where Tobias, by the direction of an angel, burnt the liver of a fish, and, by the smoke thereof, drove off the devil Asmodeus. "Who can doubt, colonel, that the smoke of incense now, and the sign of the cross, with the prayers of the priest and holy water, will have the same effect on devils and troubled spirits?"  The colonel looked grave, and the collector, proud of so docile a pupil, said that he had read in Josephus, where one Eleazar, in the presence of the Emperor Vespasian delivered many persons from evil spirits by putting to their nose a  certain ring; the odour or offensiveness of which at once expelled the demon. "And I have heard that the Jews have a  saying that the smell of sweet odours will drive away hurtful spirits."  The colonel smiled incredulously. "Admirable! Mr. Colleetor," said Shepard, who was standing by, "'Eleazar was quite equal to King Eric of Sweden, who, by putting on his conjuring capl made the spirits and even winds obey him. But I am surprised to hear  that demons are so nice about sweet smells. A dirty fellow then is less like a gentleman than the prince of dark- ness. Perhaps that is the reason why your Saint Francis thought saintship and filth1 went together." The rest of the company were talking over the marvellous story of the Irish woman Katy, and- any wondered if there was any, and what connexion there could be between the troubled spirit if Katy's room, and the lights and noises in   58       i PILATE AND HEROD. Coode's mansion, which was about a mile off With the crowd there was both seriousness and solemnity. Colonel Smithson and Shepard were nearly the only persons who appeared to look on with the wish or expectation of sport. Our friend Montrose was all attention, and did not know exactly what to think, while the' ladies, Emma, Annie, and Julia, who were under his charge, were variously affected. In the meanwhile Father Canon entered the house, and saw Katy, looking the picture of despair, starting at every sound, almost glaring at the persons near her, and evidently in fear that the troubled spirit might at any moment make his appearance. She was sittig under a tree in the back yard, and acting thus strangely, when some one said to her, "Father ]anon has come, and wants to speak to you." She immediately began to adjust her dress, and smooth her hair; and having thus briefly made her toilet, she drew near the priest, and knelt with her head lowly bowed, and her arms crossed on her breast.    ,I  - i "Pax vobis, pax robis," said the priest.  ac Blessings on your reverence, for coming to help a poor  craither. And won't you dribe away the horrid baste that  made me lose more days, by not sleeping, than I have slept hours. And sure your riverince will?" "Be quiet," said Father Canon. Katy said no more. The priest robed himself, and hav- ing made his preparations, began at the garret, where he walked around it, and sprinkled holy water-on the sides of the wall. He continued'so to do till he had sprinkled holy water, and said the exorcism office in all rooms, passages, and even closets of Mars. Doolittle's house. { I wish he would speak louder and slower," said Julia to Emma. What does he mean   repeating a part of the exoroism-office, Cc Exoroizo te immundissime spiritua.' See how furiously he crosses himself, and how fast he speaks, when he says: Recede et da locum spiritui sanoto per hoc signum erucis?" "I might tell you," said Emma, in a whisper, to her, if I knew Latin; but, as I led you and Annie into difficulty yesterday, you persuaded me into this improper, unbecom- ing, and I fear, sinful sight seeing to-day. Tomeitseems to be any thing but worship, and I wish we were away from Montrose- heard Julia's question, and eq'fifined the mean- 71Y   "AYING THE GHOST.        59 ing of the Latin phrases to her as an exorcising of the unclean spirit, and a command to him to withdraw, and give place to the Holy Spirit, in obedience to the sign of the cross, which the priest made. "Do you think he will obey?" asked Julia, as if she did not altogether question Father Canon's power. Montrose shrugged his shoulders, and said, "I will be- lieve it, when I know it." The priest now gave the crowd to understand that he had driven the troubled spirit to the cellar; and he was about to follow him there. The company moved with him in that direction; the priest, however, alone entered the cellar; while the lookers-on saw as well as they could by the door and window.  Won't he escape?" said Doolittle,  anxiously.  "Oh! no," replied Mr. Craft in an undertone. a Father Canon, you observe, has made the sign of the cross. He has made it on the threshold of the door, and on the window- sill." Doolittle seemed to breathe more freely, and he turned to Allgrace, and the two whispered to each other their sur- mises. -             . "The Lord bless me!" exclaimed- Mrs. Doolittle, as she saw an Irishman, Katy's brother, by the command ofFather Canon, bring into the cellar from the kitchen a ege iron pot. "Sure, and the never a bit of hot water, no, never," continued Mrs. Doolittle, "shall I be able to boil in my big pot agin. For, if I were now to use it, there's no knowing what might not happen." The pot was placed in the middle of the cellar, aid here was about to be, shown, not " death in the pot," but a spirit, or the evil one in it. Mute wonderment enchained many, while a thrill of exultation blended with fear: pervaded the Roman Catholic spectators, as they saw Father Canon's movements, and heard his Latin, and above all when they became aware, as he turned the big pot over, and defended any egress from it, by guarding it all round with signs of the cross, and solemtn objurations, that the spirit was under it. On Katy the effect was almost marvellous. No sooner had Father Canon closed the services, and said to her, "Dominus vobiscum," and " pax vobis," than she became to allappearanceA sane woman, and was in her right mind as much as ever.   \' ,. * /   60        PILATE AND HEROD. "I want no more," said Allgrace to Doolittle, as the two rode slowly away. " 1 can fix him. If the witch of Endor deserved to die, much more does this priest of the devil." "Oh! let him live," interrupted Shepard, joining them. "The sin of witches lay in calling devils up, but Father Canon has been so kind as to lay this devil. And, provided lie could lay other devils as well," dropping his voice, " the devils of fanaticism and puritanism, I would propose that he be even salaried by the Legislature." And so saying Shep- ard spurred his horse to overtake the ladies of Elfin Hall, who were just ahead of him. Now little communities, like little bodies,are most affected by slight explosions. Our readers have heard of a tempest in a teapot, and have noticed the agitation into which little folks are thrown by " trifles light as air." We have seen a worthy friend, who was rather less in size than the Canadian giant, much disturbed by the intrusions of an impudent pig into his garden. And the effect of this laying of the ghost on the good people in that section of the province was as- tonishing. Tie report which it gave rise to, travelled on i the wings of the wind, and like all other reports, lost nothing in travelling. For, while a traveller rather scatters his wealth, than adds-to it, as a rolling' stone gathers no moss, rumours, like snowhalls, grow in travelling. Thus it was said in Charles county that Father Canon took the devil by the horns, and dragged him into the 6ellar; but the devil, not relishing the idea of being potted, like mince-meat, or fearing, perhaps, if he should be potted, that he might be put on the fire before his time should come, politely as he dared, remonstrated; when Father Canon, concluding that it would not do to be civil to the evil one, made over him the awful sign; repeating at the time some fearful words in Latin; for it would seem that his satanic majesty, as said some of the Romanists, in this matter, (as perhapsin other respects,) showed that the puritans were his inferiors; for he under- stood Latin very well, and appreciated the force of Father Hunter's argument -that a prayer, or abjuration, to be offered properly, must be in Latin. Hence, at the magic words the devil vanished into smoke, settling, it was believed, quietly in the pot. How he came to take the form of smoke, said some, need excite no wonder, for smoke and fire are ever inseparable; and, as with Satan flames are always associated, so smoke   Il            LAYING THE GHOST. was a very proper manner for him to disappear in. E could not have disappeared otherwise, said another, wh regarded the whole story as a miserable fables for wh was but smoke, or a fussabbut nothing),could end only i smoke. The story, however, did not stop here.     t proceeded t say that Father Canon then turned to go aa when there [;i1 i  was" heard an explosion as loud as the discharge of a  musket */  and the pot was seen to sail out o f the cellar with the tro:u. bled spirit seated in it looking much amused at the amae- o e  llar, of /ito le .e ,-t ' E red by the ne ws- msidgey , toh ' M,. il eig near before the door out- si, the pot passed ery near the head of this worthy, and a  singed his pray It was Laid further that the sprint- dp w his abode a or near ess'. at n Uames   s ' to e sg into e      thee creek lie a h      poere  aount the last reportt a ad tha es tath e te a-te wh port od 4 doty. rII.- o' nmng o verf the waves 7at Point he wLs ee aind s  do iretl due east for ther eas tern , . -; an an    ie e ocp his boe ar    n I,    aether, no er he I to o de at or near Devil' s Island, in Somvers, eC took or whetheerhe divides  his time between the country about wSt. Inigo  o   es'  , and thvat about eilnd hile not s    ay.

Allgrace and Doolittle had already, as we mentioned, come to one conclusion on the exorcism of the disturbed spirit, and this was to usewhat they saw and could other- wise establish against Father Canon as matter for a prose- cution in court. Having so concluded, they determined, as the disturbed spirit would not be likely to haunt the house of Mrs. Doolittle, and as that dame particularly desired the company of Allgrace and her brother that evening, hoping to find in their spiritual converse relief and comfort in her then troubled state) these worthies, after riding to St. Mary's, returned just at dark to sup at Mrs. Doolittle's. Katy waited upon them, looking quite a different person, calm, composed, and happy. Mrs. Doolittle felt that a load was lifted from her heart in the laying of. the spirit, and the company before her. Allgrace and Doolittle were not a little thankful that they could now stop in such good quar- ters, without the fear of nocturnal intrusion, and the even- ing passed away, Allgrace thought, more pleasantly than any other he had spent there, since the night mentioned in our first chapter, when Parson Gordon rode by, and heard him "exercising his gifts in prayer." A long and windy prayer closed the chat for the night, and Allgrace was shown to a chamber. He was to sleep by himself, and his room was on the ground floor, and directly under Katy's. The association was not the most agreeable.- But now, he said to himself, beyond the association there was no objec- tion to sleeping in the room. He undressed after awhile, and laid down. His light was but an inch candle, and he lay endeavouring to compose himself to sleep till the candle had burnt to the socket; and then, regretting that his hos- tess had limited him to so scanty a light, and. saying men- tally, there is no need for fear, the spirit is not here now, he blew out the flickering flame. In about half an hour, Allgrace, after groaning as usual, to expel perhaps the ill humours which during the day collected in him,7fell asleep, and was snoring loudly. -"Now is the time to fix the fellow," said a voice in the wall of the chamber. "He'll prosecute Father Canon, will he?" So saying the speaker came from his hiding place by a small door that opened into the room, and he was followed by another person.   ELDER DURAND'S GHOST. " Ve must not make any more noise than we can hel. said the same speaker, or we'll wake Katy, and, poor cr ture, she bas rested badly."  Their advice was rather late. Allgrace slept unsound] and started, hearing the noise. But it was now still. moment after, as he was relapsing to sleep, he heard a gro at the head of his bed. Could he be dreaming? or was real?  He heard another groan. The puritan wanted to a what was the matter? A third groan was heard, and th was followed by a cry like that of a screech owl at the foc of his bed.  Allgrace partly raised himself, and just foun resolution to ask who it was, and what he could do. Th reply was a groan so piteous that the sympathies of Allgrac were nearly as much excited as his fears. "What can I do-?" he asked very solemnly, his voice ye tremulous the while. !"I fear," said the voice, "it may be too late," and there :  was a groan again. "I  adjure th ee,' said the puritan, trying to be calm, "by the living God tell me what thou art, and what I can do." gro  u knew Elder Durand  ?" asked the voice, and another Now, much   as Allgrace venerated the  memory of this !   ttdeceased puritan worthy, he had no wish to keep up an inter- course with him after he had  passed from this breathing world   to the mysterious one-beyond, and, w ithout pausing to ask !   himself might there not be deception or delusion of some kind here, he felt most uncomfortable at the thought that Elder Durand, sainted as he believed him to be had come from the world of shades,an  d was now in his be d-chamber 1 He with difficulty asked, "Ann e  good saint that's gone to heaven, who settled The spectre at the head of the bed groaned in reply, and the visitant at the foot made a  chuckle, sharp, and unlike a X   uman being  s voice, in tone, as if the person breathed and exhaled through a     conth. A llgrace's blood nearly froze with terror. A   sepulchral voice then s aid, "I  am the soul of Elder Durand doomed to wander in this world, and I  want rest, rest , rest."' Such an announcement carried terrible confusion to All- grace's ideas . In his opinion, Elder Durand was the beau ideal of orthodoxy  and goodness, and he thought it was   "       PILATE AND nUBv^. impossible that he could be still a disturbed spirit. There was something wrong somewhere. It could not be, and the puritan almost concluded that the voice came from a demon, and not Elder Durand's spirit in the duress of post mortem confinement. Allgrace, therefore, muttered an incoherent prayer, in which the expressions, "Get thee hence, Satan! "Iying spectre, be one r "esus save me!" were more than once repeated. But he was not allowed to pray but a very few-minutes. The very shrill and most unpleasant noise at the foot of the bed was repeated, evenmore shrill and unplea- saht, and Allgrace convulsively sat upl shaking with terror, and almost desperate with hatred of the thing or phantom that so fearfully announceditself. What to dowasthe question. To lie down, and cover himselfhead and ears with the coverlet, would not get rid of his annoyer. If he could muster courage to dress and leave the room, he might be delivered. But this was the rub. And he sat up in bed trembling, anxious to get out, and deep peering through the dark as if he would see what might be the company around him. But his eye brought him no report and his ear for a moment or two conveyed to him as little. It was a still night, and cloudy and dark. All in the house seemed to be asleep At length he heard a movement at the foot of his bed, and straining his eyes in that quarter he faintly asked ' What are you? Tell me." i"Ftn me- and you'll know," replied the same shrill, piercing voice, and something not very large was'moving on the bed, while the same voice continued: "Where's the slimy snake there stay 1, Where's the toad's bed there I lie 'Where the worm acrees and eats illn, I wait and hope to have thee still. A noise most unnatural followed these lines, a noise between the croaking of a frog and the hissing of a snake. The devil, or something very kin to him, must be near, and feling that something moved on the bed near the foot, Allgrace put out his hand to push it off. He touched an object cold and rough, as we may suppose a frog feels to the touch What AllgracW would have done, must be left to conjecture. But at this instant the door opened, and a figure walking steadily on naked feet, entered. -iped it seemed to be, but it was too dark to say whether it was man or woman. The ghost of Elder Durand, and the companion of the snake, the toad,   KATY THE UHOST         65 and worm retreated hastily by their private door, and by an outlet, left the house. "The ghost, as I live! has come, sure enough," said one of the retreating party, chattering with fear. "Yes," said the other, "'and I wish I was ten miles from here," and with hardly less fear than Allgrace, they buried themselves in the dark woods, and by a path known to them, and only stopping now and then to catch breath, they hur- ried on. Allgrace heard the steps of those retreating, and the steps of the new comer entering; but was in no state of mind to think clearly about the matter. The cold object he touched in bed, the voices and all, and then the prospect of yet further annoyance-took from him all resolution. He lay back in bed coiled up as a rope, with the sheets and coverlet wrapt around him. The figure, which was Katy, somnambulating, walked about the room, and then with- drew, returned to her chamber, and lay down, totally un- conscious that she had played the part of a ghost, or that Father Canon had laid the ghost which had disturbed her. Allgrace's appearance in the morning bespoke a mind ill at ease; but, for reasons best known to himself, he made no allusion to the supposed phantoms, which had intruded into his room. He had received a mortal stab in the imputation cast on Elder Durand. It haunted him nearly as painfully as did the spectres on that night. That the soul of a puri- tan should not be at rest was a supposition calculated to derange his whole system of rewards and punishments. His mind was full of the subject as he rode away the next morning towards St. Mary; too full of meditation to let out his thoughts and feelings to his companion, Doolittle. The absurd plot, that resulted so unpleasantly to All- grace, was carried out by two persons, Darnell and Hackett, who were any thing but ghostly; the contrivance of the plot, of which they were the unthinking agents, was the work of Father Canon, or some other, person, who wished to punish Allgrace for his hostility to the Roman priests. 6*   CHAPTER XIX.

TiE report of the laying of the ghost at Mrs. Doolittle's by Father Canon came to Parson Gordon in St. George's, with such enlargements as the love of the marvellous, and the disposition to exaggerate, had imparted, by the time it had travelled thus far. The worthy rector had too much sense to quarrel with human nature for this infirmity; though he regretted it, as thereby the Church of Rome would have a further hold on the imbecile portion of the population. ,' However, it, is all right, Robin, said he t o McGregor who was with him in a boat, about to cross over to the point of land that is made by the mouth of St. Inigoes' creek. of Themore Mr. Canon lays the deil, the less trouble we'll  He'll has mony deils to lay," sai( Robin, if he maun lay them a" , hy a But you don't believe this story?" was the reply, struck at Robin's solemnity and disposed to smile at his credulity. But Robin was not wiser nor more sensible than others of his day in the same class. He firmly believed in the spirits of the dead returning to earth again and haunting the places of 'their former sojourn; loved to talk about the hobgoblin rings which certain fairies of the larger sort made in the fields near Loch Doebart, and spoke of a Robin Good- fellow, who was dressed in the rough highland kirtle and   I           PARSON GORDON AND ROBIN.        67 plaid that was worn long before his day, that used to come to his father's cabin on the hill side, and for a breakfast of oat cakes, do. any sort of work that old McGregor put him to do. These kind of deils, however) Robin pretended not very much to fear. But -of deils or spirits of another sort, such as, it was said, told to Macheth and Banquo their for- tunes in the blasted heath of Fores, Robin stood in great terror. He had a perfect hydrophobia in this sense, and -ax    never ventured on water without certain objurations before- hand. And these reports about the neighbourhood of St. - Inigoes, not only made him unwilling to venture in that  i    vicinity, but especially to go there by water. Parson Gor- don's business, however, was urgent, and he was not sorry either, knowing Robin's weakness here, by taking him along with him on a visit to a sick parishioner in that quarter, to do something towards inducing in Robin a healthier state of AR    mind on this subject. But Robin's fears were all the time : H    uppermost. He anxiously surveyed the clouds, and looked up and down the river as he got into the boat, preparing to scull the canoe across to St. Inigoes'. -^:a   "Get in man, and pull away," said the rector, "there's no danger." sa elk  Robin thought differently, and pointed significantly to the A    clouds, and the wonderful smoothness of the water, and a certain state of the atmosphere which generally precedes a storm. W " ell,' said the rector, smiling, "these signs only show 'ii  ,we may be caught by a gust of wind in the river, unless you ....vj  are smart in pulling us over." "Hut tut, mon," replied Robin, impatiently, "is that ' "Why," :smiling, {{you seem to think, Robin, that St. Mary's is equal to Lapland. Witches there are said to sell winds to mariners, and by their incantations cause and quiet tempests; but, you know, we break our egg shells, and they can't cross over the ocean." "There are deils here too," said Robin, {"deils mony besides-yes," speaking with some earnestness, " there's a deil in yon cloud," pointing to the north-west, ' that will sink us, if we canna win to the point afore it gets ower head." "Pull then manfully," said the rector; "a few good strokes, and we shall be out of its power."   68        PILATE AND HEROD. But Robin was half right in his fears. The cloud came on as if a Lapland witch or sorcerer were in it, and the storm soon burst upon them. It was now impossible so to lay their course as to keep it, without being turned aside by the gust. For the wind headed the boat round, do what Robin might with the rector's help, and their only safety lay in keeping the boat just before it. They lost no time in so managing her; and fortunately, just as the storm with all its fury broke upon the boat, they reached the point on which stands St. Inigoos' house. On the beach stood Father Canon, where he had been for some time anxiously watching their movements. "An ill wind it is," said the priest, shaking the parson's hand, 'o that blows no body good, and I must think it is a very good wind that has blown you here." "Thank you," was the rector's reply. "How far it may be a port of safety," smiling, "I cannot say; though of course it would be pleasant if we could both cast anchor in the same port." "Well, well," said Father Canon, "any how) since the weather has driven you to St. Inigoes' house, it won't do to keep you out in it." And he led the way to the house. Having reached the porch, the two stood' with Robin, and gazed upon the storm that swept by. "Ah!" said the priest, looking quizzically at Parson Gor- don, "the very weather, sir, for a polemic bout on Protes- tanism and Catholicism. The more the elements raged, the louder the polemics would wrangle. You and Father Hun- ter, I heard, had a friendly, good-natured, and most charm- ing bout at Mr. Durford's, a short time ago." Mr. Gordon assented with a smile. "A very pleasant business, truly," continued Mr. Canon, "to give each other all the thrusts and punches you can, and all out of pure kindness and love. You help the cause of peace by making war; and are yourselves pretty examples' of peace-makers! Well, well, I had rather be delivered from such loving encounters. You have the slaps of the' bear without the hug." "Yes," replied the rector, "and I fear less the bear's slaps than his hugs. Assaults I may fend off, but embraces might squeeze out of me all power of resistance." "Good," said the priest. "' You mean the Church Catholic is the ursa minor, the lesser bear, and this they'call the   'aT'HER CANON AND PARSON GORDON,     -69 north star, and it is the one bright light in the heavens: which we steer our course;" and he chuckled as he spok ness.

St. On entering the library, when he was ushered in, Parson Gordon saw a few old editions of the Schoolmen; the Sum- ma Theologim of the angelic doctor, and a few of the smaller works of Bonaventura, the seraphic doctor, and the Acta Slanerum by   unkwn author.   When he saw the first mentioned womrk, he thought of that incident in Aquinas' life, w  hen, being admitted to a private interview ith Inno- Pent IV., a bag of money, the fruit of the sale of indulgences wasbroughtin.

"I hope I have already reached the true fold " replied the recor, " and this, allow me to say, is'the fold of Christ. not th e ifold of S Peter any more than it is the fold of St: Paul, or of St. John.-" "I can't think," said Mr. tunter, mildly, and Parson Gordon  was pleased to discover that a, warm and sunny kindliness could upon occasions light up his dark counte- nance), "you would say so if you would permit your excel- lent understanding  to act without the trammels of a faulty Parson Gordon smiled.  The priest continued  While it is your misfortune to have drawn  your first   70       PrILATE AND REROD. breath in the corrupt atmosphere of a misled people; it was my lot to have been received in early infancy into the bosom of the Catholic Church." Parson Gordon's looks said better than words, this is all mere assertion. The priest observed the expression, and reddening very slightly continued: "Men kick at the supremacy of St. Peter, and of the Holy See, because they ignorantly believe it to be the in- vention of, what some are pleased to call, the dark ages: and which dark ages they represent as the fruitful womb of the doctrines of the Catholic faith. But let it be un- derstood that this supremacy comes from God"--Parson Gordon looked amazed,--" and no good man would fight against it, but welcome it as a gracious means whereby, through a visible head, God would bind us all together." iMore Roman sophism, thought the rector, what now? He replied' - I ask but this: show me that the authority of supreme bishop, or chief pastor, over all the bishops and prelates of Christendomi, which the Roman see claims, is derived from the word of God; or that it is made clear by the rule of Vincentius of Lerins; 'Quod seoper, qued ubique, quod ab om1nibus crediturm est,' and I yield the point. I ask no more, and it is a modest demand,' that either the Holy Scriptures, or the concurrent teaching and testimony of the Church on to our day, shall sustain the high- claims of the bishop of Rome.* I came not here for an argument, I am but a looker on in Venice, yet I will patiently hear your ar- gument on either of these heads." "Cui bono?.' muttered the priest, still the patient manner of the rector seemed to be defiant, and he said mentally, "' I will see at least some more protestant finesse and make shift." So, after remarking that, perhaps, his guest was too fatigued, and receiving the reply, that he could rest as well in conversing on this as any other topic, he said: ' You will need no more than a synopsis of the grounds, on which the whole question turns," and the priest walked up and down the room, as if, by the motion of his body, he would give more spring and movement to his mind. Hfe was about to grapple with a subject, which giant intel- lects had elaborated and built up into a most imposing spir- Vicentius Lerins, in his Commonitory, states that it was the cus- tom of Catholics to prove the faith; first by the authority of the Divine law, and next by the traditions of the Catholic faith.   PARSON GORDON AND FATHER   HUNTER.    71 itual edifice, and which intellects as,gigantic had taken to pieces and shown to be made up of unhewn and unsuitable timber, and he was about to grapple with an antagonist that Father Hunter'knew from experience could not be handled easily, nor assailed with impunity. Mr. Gordon watched him narrowly, and could not but admire the haughty con- sciousness of power, which Mr. Hunter's step indicated, and the stealthy and adroit craftiness with which he opened - his subject. His cold grey eyes twinkled, his heavy eyebrows looked portentous, and his thoughtful brow appeared to swell, as if to give room to the brain to exert itself, and Mr. Gordon knew he ventured much in calling out an antagonist who knew his weapons and his distance, and was at home in an encounter on such a field. For Roman polemics, when they take the field, do not, like many Protestants, expeco faith to find the powder and ball as they may be required And, though -- ---"thrice doubly Is he arm'd, who hath his quarrel just," yet justice in supplying the weapon gives not the ammuni- tion, nor does it play well the gunner's and the musketeer's part. "You remember, sir," began Mr. Hunter, " that our Lord admitted the apostles to the holy ministry, when He insti- tuted the holy Eucharist on Maunday Thursday.*   But it was afterwards that He commissioned them with the Apos- tleship.  Then He said, 'As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you.' And when He had said this, He breathed on them, saying, ' Receive ye the Holy Ghost, .whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.' Here then He gave to the Apostles equal apostolic jurisdiction. But, at our Lord's third apparition, near the sea of Tiberias, He did more. Then He did not renew the apostolic commission, (which being already granted, needed no renewal,) but He addressed Himself to St. Peter only: and, with more than His wonted solemnity of manner, importing hereby that He was then * The second-canon of the Council of Trent, Sess. xxii. pp. 113, 114, says," Si quis dixerit, illis verbes. Hoc facite, in meam commemorati onem, Christum non institulsse Apostolos sacerdotes, anathema sit." If any one shall say that in these words, "Do this in remembrance of Me," Christ did not ordain His apostles priests, let him be accursed.   7i'- 2     PILATE AND HEROD. about to bestow a power which, up to that moment, had not passed from his hands, our Lord singled out St. Peter; and, as if to prepare him for the awful commission, with which '  He was about to invest him, our Lord asked St. Peter, (and '- how natural the question,) Lovest thou Me more than these?' His disciples, I mean, could claim to love Him. Not as a , blundering tyro would say, Lovest thou Me more than thou dost these sheep? Here our Lord said to St. Peter, I am 9  about to honour you more than all of My Apostles, do you merit this mark of My preference by a greater affection and devotion to Me. St. Peter, so understanding Him, ardently and repeatedly replied,' Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.' Wherefore, bur Lord then and there gave him this special and extraordinary commission to feed His sheep and lambs; that is, to be His Vicar, or Vicegerent, the Shepherd to His flock, wherever and whenever it should be folded. You will not say my inference is forced," (seeing that Parson Gordon's manner implied a doubt of the conclusion he had just evolved from his premises,) "for our Lord either intended to give St. Peter this extraordinary and pe- culiar power, or He meant to him no power at all. He -spoke as the Gospellers do, dealt in mere assertion; used a trope just to show that He could declaim. Why," and he looked at the rector as if he would read the innermost work- ings of his mind, "should He single St. Peter out, and say, 'Feed My sheep; feed My lambs!' Undoubtedly, as St. Eutherius says, ' to make St. Peter not only a Shepherd, but the Shepherd of Shepherds.' Besides, our Lord called St. Peter, Cephas, Petra and Petros. 'Thou art Peter, is His remark, 'and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.' His name signi- fied a rock, and dare we say he was not a rock?" He folded his arms. "On him the church was to be builded, and dare we say that there is another, or are other stones, which can as well serve: for the rock of the church?"He smiled scornfully. "The same critical sagacity might as properly say, that other precious stonesthan jasper, sapphire, emerald, and the like, would have answered to adorn the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem. Further our Lord gave to St. Peter the-keys of the kingdom of Heaven. To do what with? Let them rust in his hands unused? To wear them about his person, and yet not open and lock the door of the church with them? To let them be taken   'H' JKti Vx OF I'ST'. PETER. I from him by another, or others of the apostolic college? To lay them by in the leaves of manuscript copies of the New Testament for Luther, Calvin, and Cranmer to find them, and by them open the golden doors of the church? Why, sir, keys imply government."  Parson Gordon bowed. "And, if St. Peter had the keys, who, without his letting, can pass in the door? None, surely; and, as he alone has the keys to open and shut, St. Peter must open to us the doors, and he will shut against many the doors of the king- dom of Heaven. Further,"--Parson Gordon seemed anxious to take him up,-" for dwell I cannot. You have not for- gotten that, at the election of Matthias, St. Peter took the lead; which, according to St. John Chrysostom, 'proved him to be the prince of the choir.' You know that in the list of the Apostles, St. Peter's name comes first; and that St. Matthew expressly says, 'Simon is the first,' or chief. This could not have been accidental. 'The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,' but this mention cannot be a mere bubble on the surface of Holy Writ. No, it was designed in that Book, whose least word, even the yod in the Hebrew, and the breathings in the Greek manuscripts were inspired by the Holy Ghost; and which for thousands of years God Himself has wonderfully preserved, Again, who spoke first on the day of Pentecost? Surely, your Protestant Bibles do not conceal the fact that St. Peter was the first and chief, and almost exclusive speaker and actor! Who worked the first miracle in the church of Christ? You need not that I should tell you St. Peter. Why, sir, it was St. Peter also that first preached to the Gentiles, and to him, first of all, did God reveal His purposes to admit the Gentiles into His church. Now you Protestants profess to be good textuaries. You pull and tear asunder with unholy reverence the one and undivided word, and from a text here and there, would make out your religions. You tell us poor Catholics to go to the dry bones of antiquity; as you call the fathers, and I will now give you the voice of Catholic antiquity." He paused awhile, took a few strides up and down the chamber. Parson Gordon waited quite patiently.  The priest resumed: "Tertullian and St. Cyprian call St. Peter the rock. Origen says: 'To Peter chiefly it was delivered to feed the sheep.' Eusebius, St. Basil, and the Council of Chalcedon, speak also authoritatively and clearly on St. Peter's chief. vo?. Jn,--7   PILATE AND IIEROD.                I %i.    01 taincy. Thus Eusebius calls him the 'first pontiff of the Christians, and greatest of the apostles.' St. Basil's testi- mony is that he was preferred before all of the disciples; and the great Council of Chalcedon entitles him 'the rock of the Catholic Church, the foundation of the right faith.' Take and digest these facts, (more might be cited, but time and memory are wanting,) ,and disown not him, nor his church, to whom Christ committed His power on earth." The priest then took his seat, and Parson Gordon admired the calmness with which he delivered bold and startling de- clarations. The rector was not frightened by the array of authorities, knowing it was not difficult to make a good plausible argument, in support even of heresy, on the faith of a few texts of Scripture, and by extracts from a few of the fathers.* "In order to prove St. Peter's supremacy," replied the rector, " I ask the same authority which establishes Infant Baptism, the Christian Sabbath, Episcopacy, the Holy Tri- nity, and indeed the articles of the Christian faith. You say our Lord said to the apostles, As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you;' and you admit that He breathed upon them saying, 'Receive ye the Holy Ghost.' You remember that in the appearance of our Lord after his resurrection, which is mentioned by St. Matthew, when there were present five hundred brethren at once, our Lord said to all of the apostles, 'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore.' Now the inference from these passages is inevitable, that, when our Lord addressed himself to all, without particularizing or singling   * On the strength of a passage in Revelation, (xx. 4,) I have heard it argued that our Saviour will reign personally on earth, and the reign of the saints under His government will continue a thousand years; and to support this opinion Tertullian, Justin Martyr, and particu- larly Ireneus, are quoted by the millenarians. Now if one felt disposed to build on a single quotation from the fathers, an anti-temperance person might make large calculations on a remark which Papias ascribes to our Lord, and which Ireneus seems not to doubt; i.e. that during the millenium the vines would have each ten thousand boughs, each bough ten thousand branches, each branch ten thousand switches, each switch ten thousand clusters, each cluster ten thousand grapes, and each grape would contain twenty-five measures of wine when well pressed. A bright future would this promise to an anti-temperance advocate and if one patristic authority, or if many such are reliable in proof of doctrine, where Scripture is silent, and where there is not the quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus tradition or teaching of the church, he might look on this rumour of Papias as good authority for the unlimite4d use of wine, and even of 4tirong drink now,   ST PETER'S SUPREMACY.          75   out any, He gave to each and all of the apostles the same mission, apostleship, and authority. And what was that mission and authority ? Our Lord himself answers: 'Even that which I have received of my Father;' thus investing them with the same powers which He himself had received. Could St. Peter have received any powers above these ?-be clothed with more power than Christ himself had ? Having transferred to them his own authority, what authority had He to bestow on St. Peter ? He did not make him God; but God he must have been to have had more than all power spiritual, which the apostles had. V         " But next comes the text, 'Feed my sheep, feed my ::      lambs;' and here you say, date St. Peter's peculiar powers. How can this be ? These words, neither in themselves, nor as they are interpreted by the circumstances under which they were spoken, nor by the voice of antiquity, will bear out your view: 'Be thou; Peter, the universal governor of my church.' For the words themselves, ' Feed my sheep, feed my lambs,' may be addressed to any clergyman, whe- ther presbyter or bishop, and they neither import nor convey any special authority. But you interpret them, not only as conveying authority, but as conveying it' to St. Peter exclu- sively, because he alone was mentioned by name.  Can this be so ? Take a case analogous to it." When St. Paul said to the presbyters at Ephesus, 'Feed the church of God,' no one supposes he meant to give them authority either over the whole church of God, or for all time by themselves and their 'successors over the church of God in Ephesus. Yet St. Paul's words to the presbyters are full as significant as the words of Christ to St. Peter. Now the, language ad- dressed to St. Peter, apart from the Roman gloss, and seen in its own light, and without the mist of specious reasoning, appears to be no more than an exhortation or admonition, and not language which implies any new functions or pow- ers. Besides, St. Matthew states, (x. 6,) that the apostles were commissioned, when the name of apostle was first given to them, 'to go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel' and, on Ascension day, (xxviii. 19, 20,) they were commanded to teach all nations. Now, if the commission to go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and to teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the adorable Trinity, and instructing them in the precepts of Christ, coupled, as it was with the promise, Lo! I am with you always, even to     76       'PILATE AND HEROD. the end of the world,' be not a comnmission to feed the sheep and lambs of Christ's fold, what more is necessary to make such a commission? Surely your ideas about a shepherd of Christ's flock are more modern than thotsewhich prevailed in St. Cyprian's time. He says, 'Pastores sunt omnes, sed grex uncis ostenditur, qui apostolis omnibus unanimi con- sensione pascatur.' All are shepherds, but the flock is shown to be one which is fed by all of the apostles harmoniously consenting. How could St. Peter's charge be other, or different from the apostles'? They were commanded to teach all nations, and to go into all the world. His com- mission could not embrace a larger "flock than all nations. nor a larger field than all the world. St. John Chrysostom, while he called St. Peter the prince of the choir, thought each apostle had the same authority, and be meant not what you claim by the term prince, for he called St, John ' a pillar of the churches over the world,' and he calls St. Paul ' an apostle of the world.' What becomes then of St. Peter's vicegerency? We must reject it. This vicegerency, how- ever, is not known to the early fathers. St. Ambrose knev nothing of it, for he declares that, ' not only St. Peter, but with him all priests have received this charge of our Lord.' St. Austin knew nothing of it, and he stands first, as you know, among the Latin fathers; for he said: ' When it is said to Peter, it is said to all, Feed my sheep.'" A derisive smile, and then a shade of displeasure, like electric coruscation out of a gathering cloud, passed over Father Hunter's face. The rector continued : "Look next at the circumstances under which these words were used. Before the crucifixionj St. Peter had made more protestations of regard than any of the apostles. He went so far asito represent that their affection for Christ fell below his own. 'Though all should be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.' This boastful declaration needed to be rebuked, for St. Peter, Judas excepted, evinced least regard for our Lord, denying basely with an oath, 'I know not the man.' It was then both proper and very natural that our Lord after His resurrection should remind the apostle of his recent sad defection, and, by reminding him of it, seek to impress abidingly upon him the lesson it taught of humility, and the danger of self-confidence. Where- fore our Lord's question, ' Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?' viz., :my disciples, who have just pro-   ST. PETER'S SUPREMACY.       ." fossed the same unmeasured regard and devotion, but who denied and disowned me less than you have done? And, repeating his question twice, how impressively must have rome home to- the conscience-smitten apostle the charge, 'Feed my sheep, feed my lambs.' Hence St. Chrysostom understands the passage to be 'only an admonition to guard the apostle against a second lapse.' You next rely on the change of St. Peter's name from Simon to Peter, or Petros a stone; and, also, on the expression, rock, or Petra, being said to St. Peter in acknowledgment of his noble confession. From which rock, or Peter, you infer, the church, according to our Lord, was to be built; and, lo! your ready rhetoric forthwith constructs the gorgeous fabric of the papal dynasty. And, I must say, that you here take the same, and as great a liberty, as you charge Protestants with taking with the word of God. True, that word, and every part of it, is inspired, but, St. Peter's chieftaincy is not in the word, but we have only your interpretation of that word. How idle, and dangerous, to build an important doctrine from an insu- lated passage! Thus, the sons of Zebedee, James and John, were called by our Lord, ' sons of thunder,' Boanerges; but must we thence infer that the thunders of apostolic power were confided only -to them? And, if they only, could fulminate spiritual censures, what avails, or means, St. Peter's chieftaincy? The name Petros, a stone, which was given to St. Peter, cannot prove that he was the Petra, or Stone, on which the church was to be built, because each of the apostles, likewise, was a rock, or stone, for, in Revela- tion (xxi. 10, 14,) it is said, the wall of the New Jerusa- lem had twelve foundations, on which were written the names of the apostles, and, while you complain that Protestants might as well say that amethyst, sardonyx, beryl, emerald, topaz, and the like, did not, so properly as other stones, gar- nish the New Jerusalem, as say St. Peter was not the rock on which the church stands, you would make St. Peter to be neither one of those precious stones, but a brighter and more precious stone than all. St. Peter's name cannotprove him to be the rockl,because St. Paul, in Ephesians (ii. 20,) says, Christ is the chief corner stone, and the apostles and prophets are foundation stones in the church of Christ. But, further, in your interpretation, you do what you charge me with doing, you kick against, not only God's word, but Catholic antiquity. For St. Chrysostom, Theodoret, Origen, 7*   78        PILATE AND HEROD. and the fathers, agree, as says St. Chrysostom, that, 'upon this rock, our/Lord, not upon Peter, for He did not build His church upon the man, but upon his faith.' But, suppose we admit the viceroyalty of heaven to be in St. Peter." "Then the whole question is settled,' interrupted Mr. Hunter. "How, happens it," continued the rector, "that neither St. Peter, nor any of the apostles, knew it' For, if they had known it, they could not have asked afterwards, as they did, ' who should be greatest in the kingdom of heaven?' that is, in the church. Strange! if they knew that our Lord had made St. Peter chief, the sons of Zebedee should have contended for it. It is also strange, that St. Peter himself should not have known that he was invested with such extra- ordinary powers, and, knowing his powers, -did not complain of the contention of the sons of Zebedee. You are certainly in advance, in the right, I will not say, of the early church. St. Basil terms St. Petr also 'one of the mountains upon which rock the Lord di Bromise to build His church.' And, referring to this verylonfession of St. Peter, St. Ambrose declares, 'Peter did act primacy, a primacy of confession, not of honour; of faith, jot of order.'* You next say, the keys of the kingdom of l1eaven were given to St. Peter. I admit it, but, as says Catholic antiquity, the'keys were also given to the rest of the apostles. Such is the language of St. Jerome, and, you remember, that the council of Com- peigne terms all bishops clavigeri, key-bearers, of the king- dom of heaven t Wherefore, the keys of the kingdom did not belong to St. Peter only." "St. Peter, then, had no prominency?" said the priest, scornfully. "Pythagoras is said to have seen and read a marvellous writing on the disk of the moon, and, it is possible, that Protestants may be as gifted in reading the Scriptures." "A man must be more keen-sighted than Pythagoras," replied the rector, "who should read on the face of the sacred volume the viceroyalty and chieftaincy of St. Peter. I allow, that the apostle had a prominency among the apostles, but it was a personal, and not an official one; not one, I mean, transmissible to others. In this sense; he did exercise the *"Loci non immemor sui primatum egit; primatum confessionis, non honoris, fidei non ordinis. "Episcopi-quos constat esse vicarios Christi, et clavigeros regni celorum."   IJ oST. PETER'S SUPREMACY.             79 keys of spiritual government on the day of Pentecost; and, by the baptism of Cornelius and his household, 'opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.' His name, I allow, also is first named, but, the fathers say it was because he was first called to the apostleship." "Indeed!" interrupted the priest. "And how came he first to be called?" "That would prove nothing," replied the rector, "for our Lord said, some are first called and last chosen." But, as I was about to add, you might, in proof of St. Peter's chieftaincy, have mentioned that he walked on the sea; the miraculous draught of fishes which were taken by him; our Lord's command to him to pay tribute for Himself and- this apostle; our Lord's first washing St. Peter's feet, and the sick being cured by this apostle's shadow. It is true I might object that St. Peter did not walk long on the sea; but wanted faith, and was about sinking; that in the mar- vellous haul he himself confessed he was "a sinful man;" that his payment of tribute proves that the see of Rome, by Peter-pence, did not as did St. Peter; that his feet would not have been washed if he had been clean; and that his shadow only did what the shadows of St. Paul, St. John, and others would have done. Still, out of these brief no- tices, the loom of your ingenuity can probably weave that majestic robe meet to grace the shoulders of Christ's vice- gerent. But other brief notices would prove as much in favour of the other apostles. Thus St. John was called " the beloved disciple." He it was that leaned on the bosom of our Lord. He asked our Lord a question which St. Peter presumed not to ask. He is the author of more epistles than St. Peter; wrote a Gospel called Divine, and a noble Prophecy. He outran St. Peter, and came first to the sepul- chre; and, outliving all of the apostles, seemed most fit to be the universal pastor. Hence St. Jerome remarks, "'Peter was only an apostle, but John was an apostle, evangelist, and prophet."* Parson Gordon paused a second, and dis- covering that his words were working his adversary to an unpleasant state, and believing that his mind was not open to conviction, he was about to stop here. "When the wolf in the fable," says Jeremy Taylor, "went to school to learn to spell, whatever letters were told * "Petrus apostolus tantum; Joannes et apostolus et evangelista, et propheta."   80        PILATE AND HEROD. him, he could never make any thing of them but Agnus," a lamb. Hence concludes the good bishop, "a man's mind must be like your proposition before it cqn be entertained." Mr. Hunter's mind was not like Mr. GOordon's proposition, hence he could not entertain it. But the priest asked him to proceed. "Because St. Peter's name is first on the catalogue in St. Matthew," continued Parson Gordon, n"must we infer his supremacy? Then we must infer the supremacy of others over St. Peter; because St. Paul on one occasion places his name after James, and on the second occasion places it after Paul and Apollos,; and St. John in his Gospel names St. Andrew first, and St. Peter next to him. Is his forward- ness at the election of Matthias to prove his supremacy? Why is it stated then in the account of this election in Acts, (i. 15, 22,) not that St. Peter either appointed or ordained Matthias, which he would have done, if he had been supreme pontiff, and vicar of Christ? No, he had no such power, and hence we -read that the whole company nominated or selected Matthias, along with Justus, and that God by lot decided in favour of Matthias. If St. Peter's prominency prove his supremacy, then why, being' supreme, when (Acts vi. 2) deacons were instituted, do we read that the disciples, and not St. Peter, elected; and that the apostles, not St. Peter, laid their hands upon them. Your Pope of Rome, as St. Peter's successor, claims the right to elect, and to ordain either in person, or by another. This did not St. Peter. If he had been supreme pontiff, surely St. Peter would have filled the chair, and presided over the great councils of apostles, presbyters, and brethren, which met in Jerusalem. (Acts xv.) For the Pontifex maximus, you know, was considered, 'Judex atque Arbiter rerum humanarum divinarumque,' the Judge and Arbiter of divine and human affairs.. But in this apostolic council St. James presides; and, as Hesychius pithily remarks, 'St. Peter made an ora- tion, but St. James enacted the law.'" "St"James was bishop of Jerusalem," interrupted the priest, "and the council being holden in his diocese, he might without impropriety preside over it." "True," resumed the rector smiling, "but St. Peter's powers of supreme pontiff would have suspended St. James' episcopal jurisdiction, so long as St. Peter was present, if St. Petet had held this office."   ST. PETER'S SUPREMACY.       81 "St. Peter then was, and he was not, any body,' inter- rupted the priest.  "Not supreme pontiff, or supreme apostle," said the rector, gravely. "His zeal, talents, boldness, labours, ex- perience, age, early call, and his intimacy with our Lord entitle him to be regarded as probably first in the light of a personal superiority; which superiority attached to him for these reasons. But he did not enjoy an official superiority among the apostles, and, of course, the official superiority which Rome claims as St. Peter's successor, is not even nominis umbra. The substance had it not, the shadow can- not have it." "Ah! indeed," drawing a long breath, and talking slowly. "Still," resumed the rector, "the son of Jonas stands a great and noble apostle. He stands in the apostolic college, as one of them, but not the chief. The triple crown of Roman divines is the dream of ambitious ecclesiastics in times comparatively modern. And being so regarded, St. Peter stands, not as the rock exclusively, but as one of the foundation stones of the Church of the living God. For, as St. Paul informs us, 'Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.' As I do not acknowledge St. Peter to be the head of the church, even less the Bishop of Rome who claims to represent St. Peter; excuse me for saying, I cannot follow this shadowy thing, papal supremacy; though it does affect to have on a kingly crown; persuaded it would lead me, as I fear it is leading others, a more perilous journey than that which St. Peter took over the sea; without the hope that He alone, who can walk on the sea, will catch us, as we cry, 'Save Lord or I perish.' I fear if I should wait for St. Peter's shadow to pass by, I should miss going to Him, to whom St. Peter says, we should go, for, Thou hast the words of eternal life.'" Father Hunter seemed now to lose all patience, and, instead of replying to Parson Gordon, by attempting to re- fute his positions, or to make his own ground more tenable by additional authority, he turned upon him, and in a voice of more than wonted harshness, said: "So you make nothing of the centre of unity! To you it is nothing that St. Peter and his successors, the Bishops of Rome, who are the centre of unity, the visible head   which holds the church together, are scorned. You would maintain that the church is one without any head; that Christians are united together, yet each conventicle being independent. I know not, sir, which most to wonder at, the cool impudence which could make such an assertion, or the blindness which, in spite of your undoubted ability and learning, could make you rush upon such a precipice of nonsense." Parson Gordon smiled, and after a while said, Will you tell me what constitutes the unity you speak of? And, be- fore you give me your definition, beware that you do not cramp the principle of Christian unity as much as the Stagy- ryte did the- drama; who said its action should not exceed one day." Father Hunter appeared to pay no attention to this remark, and seemed undecided whether he would or would not answer the question, or gratify his interrogator; having nearly concluded that further argument was mere waste of breath and labour. Parson Gordon's smile, however, roused the old Adam in -him, and he determined to make a brief reply to showy if no more, that he did not mean to retreat. "Your reverence asked," he said in a tone of well coun- terfeited respect, " what I meant by unity, and have conde- scended to instruct me what, according to Aristotle, was the unity of the drama. I am happy always to sit at the feet of a magister magistrorum, a teacher even to we poor priests, who claim to be able to teach others. ' Lawyer Brief, if here, if asked what was meant by unity, would say,-' if I  j leased a piece of ground on a certain rent, and afterwards bought the fee simple, that I would then have the unity of possession; having now both the possession and title to the property in fee; the lease being merged into the purchase.' And,! taight reply, that, as St. Peter never leased any part of hiie pltrimony to, you Protestants; much more, never sold;-,any part of it to you, that you have no unity of pos- isessioni; ,aving neither the possession, nor the fee. Are : you answered, sir?" '  "If you have no better to give, I am," replied Parson Gordon, firmly. "I will condescend to give you no other answer.,' the priest felt tempted to say, but, checking himself, he- said, "St. Cyprian said, ' He has not qod for his Father who has not the Church for his Mothe,;,and he intimates, that, "aondhe intimtes fa9   A VISIBLE HEAD.         83 whoever is separated from the Church is joined to an adul- teress." "All of which. I admit," said Parson Gordon " but must say it has no bearing on the question before us. As far as I can understand the theologians of your school, they teach, that a visible head is so necessary to unity, that without it no body of believers can be in communion with that Catho- lic Church, and that this heads is the Bishop of Rome. Do I understand you to maintain this opinion?" Father Hunter met the fixed gaze of Parson Gordon with an eye as fixed, and an expression of resolution, that said, better than words, he was not afraid to stand to the teaching of his church. a I understand you, then," continued Prson Gordon, "to assent?"            -    - The priest very gravely bowed his head, and, seeming intent on some other subject, he passed his hand Over the books on one of the shelves in the library, and his lips rather mechanically, than in obedience to a mental impulse,. repeated the names of the volumes. "Now, I   contend," continued Parson Gordon,'"that, a visible head  is not necessary to unity; because, even admitting the Bishop of Rome to bethe visible head of the church, (which I  do not,) this unity may consist without him. "What?" interrupted the priest, "a visible head, being admitted, the body can have life without the head. Your schismatical bodies must be greatly obliged to you for thus mercilessly beheading them;  representing that they are headless bodies, mere trunks, bodies whom justice has by decapitation deprived of the power of further injury Ah! this is a great conclusion to our argument- ' and he smiled in  scorn.  "Your tropes must pass for what they are worthb," replied Parson Gordon, "they touch not the question. ,Now H maintain that there may be a perfect union, and that'this unity may consist, and yet, the bodies which make up the whole, need not agree all together. If the Church of Eng- land unites with the Church of Rome in believing the one faith, one ministry, and the sacraments, which she does, she need not agree with her in recognizing the pope of Rome as the centre of unity, to be- an equal branch of the Catholic Church." . aW   84       PILATE AND HEROD. Indeed '" interrupted the priest, "let me help you to an illustration. Here's the union lately effected between Eng- land and Scotland, by which the parliament of Scotland is annihilated, the crown betrayed, and that nation's indepen- dency, sacrificed to English gold. You call this, I suppose, a perfect, but not an entire union. Why, sir, the Duke of Hamilton, your own distinguished countryman, asked indig- nantly for the descendants of those who fought under Bruce, and for the Douglasses and Campbells, and for the peers and barons, once the bulwark of the nation, to resist a union so hateful and enslaving." "I believe with you," said the rector, speaking with some emotion; "the union will be ruinous to my dear country. 1 would have shed tears with the audience, who wept at the speech of Lord Belhaven, deprecating its malign influence. You dislike it, I doubt not, because it will strengthen the Protestant cause in England, and may go to defeat the hopes of Rome through the Chevalier George at St. Germains. Still I accept the illustration. For here is a union perfect in the civil connexion it effects between England and Scot- land, making them now one people, and one government, under one and the same Parliament and Sovereign. And, though I regret that Scotland is the loser by the connexion, and that her peers have no seat in the English Parliament, an injustice forced upon us by a nation more powerful than ourselves,-still this civil union, which binds together Eng- land and Scotland, is not the less a union, because Eng- land and Scotland have each their ancient laws, courts of justice, and religion, established, as they are united, under one sovereign and legislature. Again, matrimony produces what is known in God's word and in the law of man, as a per- fect union; and yet it is not a complete union. While the Scriptures say, 'They two shall be one flesh,' and while Lord Coke declares, 'a man and his wife are in law both one person,' still the union between them is not an entire, out and out, complete union; for man and wife will be held at God's bar, each answerable for the deeds done in the body; and in human tribunals, the husband cannot control his wife's property as he can his own. Again, the persons of the adorable trinity are joined together in unity,-and this unity is perfect;-but still it is not complete; for we are, not only told not to divide the substance which makes up the Trinity, but also not to confound the persons. Now, as   A VISIBLE HEAD.         85 the kingdoms of England and Scotland can be perfectly united, and yet the two kingdoms still may differ in many points, as man and wife can be joined together in holy ma- trimony, and yet they are in some respects two distinct per- sons; and as the Father, Son and Iloly Ghost make but one God, though they are still three persons, each having dis- tinct functions, so Churches of Christ may be joined together in the one Apostolic faith, which was handed down to the saints, and in the one apostolic ministry; and at the same time they may disgreee as to whether the bishop of Rome does constitute, or is the visible head of the Church. For their unity depends on the one faith, and apostolic orders, and sacraments, and not on union to any visible head; and their agreement, in recognizing such visible head, even were this proper, (which it is not), being necessary to make their unity out and out a thorough unity; and not necessary to render it a perfect unity." "I am much edified," said the priest; will your reverence proceed?" Parson Gordon swallowed down his rising indignation, and continued,-- "A visible head could not be necessary, because Liberius, bishop of Rome, adopted the Arian heresy, and you will not contend that the other Churches of Christendom should have been heretics also ;-but heretics they must have been, if they had acknowleedged his visible headship; since this acknowledgment would have bound them to receive im- plicitly his opinions as their head and infallible master. No, sir the Catholic Church has ever thought that we must be united to Christ, our invisible, but ever present head; and that each bishop, no less than the bishop of Rome, was the guardian of the whole Church; the error of one not neces- sarily affecting the others."  "Every person, then, may think as he pleases," said the priest, scornfully. A very wise conclusion, I will not say, but, for heretics and schismatics, a very comfortable one." "I say this,"' proceeded Parson Gordon, "that, to be united to the church Catholic, it is not necessary to recog- nize the supremacy of the bishop of Rome, because a large branch of the church allows this supremacy, since this is not one of the fundamentals of the faith. It has no place either in the apostolic creed, or in the Nicene or Constantinopolitan VOL. ir.-8   86        PILATE AND HEROD. creeds. It is a mere doctrine, that may, or may not, be received." "Ah!" interrupted the priest, "we must not agree, then, in doctrine, to keep up this unity. I shall have learned much before our conversation is over." "I hope so," replied Parson Gordon, firmly, nothing daunted by the sneer. "' Thus, in the early age of the church, Papias, Justin, Tertillian, Lactantius, and others, held the doctrine of the millenium, while Origen, St. Clement, St. Jerome, and St. Augustine, rejected it, and, for this differ- ence, neither were supposed to have departed from the unity of the church. Nay, more, the Dominicans, and Franciscans, among you Romanists, differed about the miraculous conception of the blessed Virgin, and yet their variance put neither out of the pale of Catholic unity. The Gallican church contends that infallibility resides in a general council, while the ultra- montane churches maintain it is vested in the pope, and, yet, ' you believe both are in union with the church." But," said the priest, "these persons were all members, confessedly, of one brotherhood, whereas, this feature of unity does not belong to the schismatic church of England." "How happened it, then," replied Parson Gordon, "that Victor, bishop of Rome, and the Asiatic bishops, his con- temporaries, differing about the time of observing Easter, did not commune together? and yet you Romanists allow that Victor, and the Asiatic bishops, notwithstanding, had not, on either side, left, or violated, the unity of the church. A most, beautiful thing, is this centre of unity! this primor- dium unitatis, when there can be, as there was formerly, two popes at one time, and, at another time, three popes! and neither of whom, nor their adherents, communed together. p . However, Rome maintains that the centre of unity existed, *k .notwithstanding; existed when Christendom was yet unde- cided in which of the three popes to place it; existed when the popes, and anti-popes, and their opposing adherents, had no intercourse together. Great benefit, indeed, must result from the centre of unity, from a visible head in a pope, when, in the eleventh century, there were three popes, and it was impossible to ascertain where was the centre of unity. And one of your own writers, Spondanus, says, 'there was in the church a most foul and pernicious heresy.'" The priest scowled at this bold exposure,-but the rector, resolved. on carrying the war into Carthage, proceeded to show the stu-   I       VISIBLE HEAD.         o pidity of this figment of centre of unity. He reminded him that the true pope could not be known, when, at one time, there was a Pope Alexander at Pisa, a Pope Gregory at Arimenum, and a Pope Benedict -at Panischela. Now, if the centre of unity was necessary, then, there being no such centre, Christ could have had no people, there was no Cathoe lic church, and, what was more against the Romanists, their pretended succession from St. Peter was either gone, or not readily, even by them, discoverable. And he made this centre of unity yet more absurd, by stating that, according to Baronius, a Roman author also, in the 10th century, the popes of Rome were abandoned to the tyranny of lewd women, who, at will, removed bishops, and even made their paramours popes, and, there is no proof that the clergy elected them, or, -after their appointment, concurred in it. He asked, therefore, "Could a pope, so made, be the head of the body of Christ?" and the rector, pressing his advan- tage, further proved that Rome could not be the centre of unity, whose bishop, as head, it was necessary to obey, and whose teaching, as infallible, it was necessary to recognise, when not only was it hard to find who was pope of Rome, and not only was a pope made, in a way a Christian bishop cannot be made, but Rome's teaching was any thing but infallible, since, at one period, she admitted infants to the eucharist, and now she denies them; at one time, she held the Millenarian doctrine, and now she condemns that doctrine as false and heretical. There was a short pause, and Parson Gordon, anxious to close the conversation, and leave no room for a rejoinder, quoted the 42d verse of the 2d chapter of Acts: "And they continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrines and fellow- ship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers." 't-Now," continued the rector, (and he sought to catch the rovinrg eye a of the priest, and hold him attentive, though he feared, as : the Duke of Marlborough said of King James II., his heart was as cold as the marble,) " the fellowship of the Apostles is that which we need to keep us in the unity of thefaith, and not the fellowship of St. Peter. He was but one of eleven Apostles, and they had but one fellowship. And so long as I am in the Apostles' doctrine and fellowship, (which I am by maintaining the one faith which was delivered to the saints, and by continuing in a communion of Apostolic ministry and sacraments,) it matters not that' I deny the   88        PILATE AND HEROD. -visible headship of the self-constituted bishop of Rome. Nay it is my duty to fall back on this apostolic fellowship, and denounce,. as the teaching of Satan, that pretension, which would; make me abandon the apostolic fellowship and faith, by seeking a connexion with a communion, which makes a creature like ourselves, instead of Christ, the head of the church; a communion, which requires that we should be united to an Italian Pprelate and in subjection to. him; whereas, we should be joined to Christ, our invisible Head, who is the fulness of Him who filleth all in all."* A rap was now heard at the door, and a servant entered, and said that some one wished to speak to Father Hunter. The priest retired, and while Parson Gordon was reflect- ing on the discussion just given, Father Canon entered with one of his usual smiles, "I thought the argument between Father Hunter and yourself had continued quite long enough. We Catholics, you must know, are testy folks. Our charity is large and warm enough:to embrace and feel for every one; but one must not:presume top far on it." "A heretic especially, as you term us," smiling as he re- plied. "Us, I suppose, you regard, as the Jews did the Gentiles; oiut of the pale of the covenant, and dogs of the concision,?"  ' I was about to say," resumed Father Canon, ' that our charity must not encounter a sturdy heretic like yourself. Then it is apt to fret itself; but let it alone, and, like a wave untroubled, it rolls on peacefully." "Th n Mr.. 'Hunter, being obstructed by my views, has gone offin a foam?" smiling. "I doubt if you Protestants find your tempers any the better when a good Catholic opposes you.

"Why, I think with honest old Flaccus, it is not well ignem gladio scrutare ;' to stir the fire with the sword. So here's some wine," putting on the table some bottles of good old wine, " to keep down your rising choler, if any; hoping it will change the feeling that was uppermost with you, of wishing to down with the Catholic Church, into a cheerful note of Io Triumphe." "That is my note for the body of Christ," said the rector, "but I do say down with the errors which overlie the faith of the Catholic Church." "Well, as you will. Better sing with Tigellius, Io Trk umphe ab ovo usque ad mala; from the eggs to the apples, from the beginning to the end. Why, parson," and Father Canon emptied his glass, and filled Parson Gordon's and his own again, "Horace. must have been a much better Catholic than many I know. He believed in a purgatory. Do you know that I have not seen any where a better description of purgatory than his?" Mr. Gordon looked surprised, and did not know how to read Mr.' Canon's remarks. "Why," continued the priest, ('old Horace warns his friend Sextus that the shortness of'life forbids an indulging in a long future. For the night of death is at hand, and close upon himself, and his friends, were the shades and gloomy house of Pluto. But, worse than all, his friend Sextus would not there cast lots for the sovereignty of wine, but would suffer from the tyranny of an earthly habit. In the land of shades he would seek to quaff his wine as upon earth; while the cup and its contents, though he would often think he was lifting them to his thirsty lips, will vanish in the attempt to enjoy them.* If this be not purgatory, what is? So we'll drink to good fellowship here; when we meet Flaccus and his friend, we shall not have it in our powed so to do."                       K "Rather, my dear sir,' speaking solemnly and kindly, -' su *i *" O beate Sexti; Vitte summa brevis spem nos vetat in choare longam, Jam te premet nox, fabulaeque manes, - Et domus exilis Plutonia; quo simul means, Nec regna vini sortiere talis." - Horace, however, says nothing of quaffing wine in the. land of the shades. Mr. Canon has rather given the Roman Catholic version of the subject, than translated the passage. 8*   yU        PILATE AND HEROD. replied Parson Gordon, "let us serve God with reverence and godly fear; for, 'blessed are the dead who die in the Lord, since they rest from their labours, and their works follow them.'" Towards the afternoon the storm ceased, the clouds broke away, and Parson Gordon and Robin resumed their route for the next point, which was at the mouth of St. Inigoes' creek. Here wag a sick parishioner, to visit whom, as we men- tioned, Parson Gordon was bound, when the storm drove him from his course, and obliged him to take shelter at St. Inigoes' house.   CHAPTER XX. M . DELAFIELD AND HS REFLECTIONS-AN ADVENTfiRE. "I am willing to die when my time shall come, And I shall be glad to go; For the world at best is a weary place, And my pulse is getting low.' N. P. WILLIS. A MAN past the middle age, whose body was a little stooped by years, or infirmity; slightly bald, with a face much care-worn, and a head sprinkled with grey hairs, called, while the events just related were going on, at the tavern of the Free Briton, and asked for Mr. Montrose. "He left," said mine host, " two days ago for lower town, and I expect him back this evening." "With whom did he go?" said the inquirer. "Mr. Shepard," replied the tavern keeper. "Worse and worse, said the stranger, and turning away from the landlord, he walked to the beach near the tavern, and then up and down in an unsteady gait. "With more than a fathers anxiety," continued he, solilo- quizing, whom our readers will be pleased to recognize as the stranger who manifested in the earlier chapters of this history so strong an interest in the religious opinions and welfare of Montrose; "with more than a father's anxiety," he repeated, "I have watched over that boy. -Boy did I say? man rather in size and vigour, but yet a boy, I fear, in, a youth's recklessness, unfixednessb Skimming like a bird over the water, and darting first here and then there, and not any where long. A letter from his college friendi'Johna son, who alone is in my secret, (and a trusty eareful lad is Johnson,) informed me that the blade had taken in a rash wager the name of Montrose, and sailed to this province; and that I would find him. in St. Mary's. And Montrose his name is to be; as if his father had Itade it so dishonour- able that the son was ashamed to own it," and he stopt, and seemed to choke with emotion. "Still, still," continued he, (61)   as2      PILATE AND HEROD. "he is my son. Nature in me will not suffer me to disown him; though for dirty gold, and to oblige a maternal rela- tion, who is incensed at my abandonment of my family, he is to drop my name, and his own by birth, Delafield. Well, well. This is only another drop to my cup, which I thought was running over, and would allow of no addition. I must even submit. An allwise Providence, not man, is the Governor of the universe; and this too has been added to my chastisements to humble and prove me; to purify my gold from its dross, and out of the furnace of suffering to render me meet for that crown, which is to be mine, if I "endure afflictions, suffering wrongfully. Be it so. Not my will; but the will of my righteous Father be done!" He paused, spent with walking, or the feelings which were too much for him, and sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, whose limbs extended into the river. After awhile he proceeded: "I could be content with his assumption of any name, even with the knowledge that he had dropt his own, because he was ashamed of his father, did I know he was likely to do honour to any. But can I feed myself with such hopes? No sooner am I apprised of his change of name, and his having sailed to St. Mary's, than here I wait for him. I find him at the Free Briton, engaged in a round of extrava- gance which soon swept all the means he had in hand. I push myself on him,-eke out of him adroitly his condition, and, by a delicate way, contrive to force on him a purse of sovereigns. Thus I render him my debtor, and both give myself the right to intrude, and create in his mind a sense of obligation, and a feeling of regard for me, which may prompt him to look to me for pecuniary help, should fur- ther be needed. I could put up, however, with his extra- vagance;"--and he added, pausing for some time,-" for this sordidness is a mean, low passion. The glittering gold came from the bowels of the earth. A man must bring himself below his fellows to get it. He must continue to dig and grovel, to live low, and keep low,-and not come 'up to the blessed sunlight to keep it. So I can forgive'him this. Extravagance is but the froth of a generous mind. It will work off, if gambling and love of liquor do not attend it; and he, thank JGod! is no gambler and no drunkard Having made myself useful to him, I follow him to the Roman chapel of St. Mary's. What could the boy want   DELAFIELD' REFLECTIONS.       93 there? Mr. Durford is his acquaintance by a letter which he brought to him, and this cautious, cunning merchant would ere now have had him in his toils by negotiating drafts at a heavy interest, if I had not thus far kept him supplied. -Strange! strange!"Mr. Delafield muttered "that this Father Hunter should be here. We met last in Dublin. Ah! he's' the very man to warp the judgment of unsuspecting youth; and I trembled, when following my son, I saw in whose hands the Roman see had confided this post. Montrose, (for so perhaps I must tutor my lips to call my boy,) I feared, must have wondered at the interest I displayed lest he might take the downward path to Rome ;"-speaking to himself with increased vehemence,- "downward it is when an enlightened mind stoops to the darkness of Romanism; showing an ignorance equal to the wild African who worships his idol feti'so. Ah! I think my talk to him, though on a subject to which he was not used, and which, I fear, may have fatigued him a little, did some good. He has attended chapel service, I understand, but once since. Thus have I watched the youth. It is well,-well." He hesitated, as if overcome by a thought yet more powerful. "Ah! What father, yea more, what mother watches a child as God our heavenly Father watches over us! Who is about our bed, and about our path, and spiest out all our ways,-' who knowest our downsitting and our uprising, and understandest our thoughts long before.' We met again at Poplar Hill Church,--but business pressed,-and I could only in passing call his attention to the admirable sermon of the worthy rector. Soon after- wards I am again in St. Mary's; and it is Sunday, and he has gone to the Roman chapel. I watch his egress from that Roman den, whence, I fear, like the lion's den in the fable, few steps are seen to come out." "I He has made no secret," he added after awhile, " of his plans, nor even of his hopes. He is in loye with the rector's daughter, but fears to aspire to her hand. Ah! perhaps I can help him? If so, it shall be lone. Arid stranger yet," continued Mr. Delafield, rising, and moVing towards the tavern, "we pass out of the tavern to look out upon the night, when the noise of a scuffle is heard, and we arrive just in time to rescue that Roman priest from the hands of a fanatical parson,-an imbecile associate, and that doubly-dyed scamp, Snarler. The very fellow who   u4        PILATE AND HEROD. keeps back the will of his deceased relative, who, as my agent, bought a valuable body of land in this province, and not having made the purchase in my name, it would not be mine or my son's, if, in dying, he had not stated to whom the property belonged. Here is a difficulty that annoys me exceedingly, and which now makes an effort on my part necessary. What is to be done? Can any thing?" He walked more slowly, and was so absorbed in thought that he entered the tavern, and did not observe that Montrose and Shepard were both near the door at the time. Opening his chamber door, Mr. Delafield fastened it, and threw him- self down on a chair. Here he sat revolving for some time the thought which was last on his mind,--and after awhile proceeded: "Reports reached me in St. Paul's that he and Snarler had an encounterband that he had handled the latter rather roughly. - That-will:must be at the bottom of it. I must lose no time,a. He then rose, and busied himself looking over some papers in his trunk. "Perhaps," he continued, "I can find the late Mr. Snarler's letter, acknowledging that he purchased as my agent, and that the property is mine. I must have brought it with me. Ah! yes, yes," he proceeded, "here it is. All is right now. This letter will do if the will should be destroyed." He replaced the letter in its bundle, and after returning it to the trunk, took out a miniature, which he kissed fer- vently. "Oh!" said he, " that those lips had life!"--and he bent over it, and seemed to weep. " My daughter," he added after awhile, "cannot look very unlike this, and she must be at her uncle's, Mr. Holt's; yet in the three visits which a father's anxiety about his son forced me to make here, I have not found the moral nerve to visit Mr. Holt. I am childish, very, very childish. My Julia's death unmanned me,-and my daughter Julia, I feared, I could. not look upon without giving way to more than feminine feebleness. But I have seen her. Yea more, I must master this weak- ness. I must now make myself known to my son and daughter, and quit this recluse life. I will, I will ;"-and he walked up and down his room, revolving this idea, till   AN ADVENTURE.         95 having settled into comparative calmness, he left his room, and walked out. Mr. Delafield had not strolled far before he saw a short distance ahead of him two persons who seemed to be en- gaged in an earnest conversation. In order to avoid them, and not wishing to return upon his steps, he took a bye-path a little to the right. As he was passing along, however, he heard a voice which he at once knew to be that of Montrose, and he could clearly distinguish. the words "Snarler's will;" and paternal anxiety overcame his reluctance to play the eaves-dropper; and his interest in the matter, rather than any elaborate reasoning on the subject, seemed to make it both proper and his duty to hear as much more as he could. The speakers, he discovered, were Montrose and Lawyer Brief; the latter he had seen at one of the courts in Prince George county. "You must understand, Mr. Montrosei, said the attorney, "that in the cowardly assault made on :Father Hunter by Snarler, Doolittle, and that puritan parson, Snarler retook that release, by which Father Hunter hoped to hold for the Catholic Church the grave-yard in this city. Now we are very desirous to regain this release, and we know but one way to effect this object." Montrose expressed his surprise how he could do any thing towards bringing about this result, and said, "With Mr. Snarler I can have no connexion further than is necessary to get possession of his deceased relative's will, and what that has to do with the right of the Church of Rome to the grave yard in St. Mary's is past my compre- hension ;" and having so said, Montrose, who still enter- tained, as at first; no partiality for Brief, turned to go away. "The very thing," said the attorney, laying his hand upon his arm in a beseeching manner. "Bear with me a moment, sir, and I will show you. Like most young gen- tlemen, I presume, Mr. Montrose's purse is occasionally lighter than he would like it to be." Montrose's face flushed, and the youth felt tempted to teach Brief a lesson on minding his own business in a way he was not likely to forget. Brief, in the blandest tone, assured him no offence was intended, and proceeded to say, that Father Hunter em- O   96        PILATE AND HEROD. powered him to place at his command a purse of sovereigns, with the promise of filling it twice more; provided Mr. Montrose would convey to him a third of the right of his factor, Charles PIelafield, to the property claimed under the will." "Well," said Montrose, smothering with difficulty his indignation, ", what has this to do with the release?" "Alli in time, respected sir," said Brief, courteously. ' This one-third of Charles Delafield's right to the valuable property held by Snarler being vested in Father Hunter, he thinks he might bring Snarler to terms, and extort from him the release which he has retaken as a highway robber." ' It takes a rogue to catch a rogue," said Montrose, in- dignantly. "Do you suppose that, acting as Charles Dela- field's agent, I could be so dishonest as to convey away any part of his right without first consulting him? especially, that I could reliiquisk one-third of a very valuable estate for a few sovereigns, iqh less in value, which you con- ceive I nowi bsolutely' ieed?" and Montrose strode indig- nantly away.?' w "A pretty vapouring youth this," said Brief, both vexed and disappointed. His factor, Charles Delafield, is rich. no doubt, if he can get the will; but, as he said about my taking the antlers of the old hart to Miss Evelin, the little word if is an important and insurmountable obstacle at times. But he, this agent Montrose, what is he? A puf- fish youth who swaggers, and lives high, and has run up scores at the Free Briton. Mine host is already uneasy about his pay, and spoke to me about taking measures to get it. I'll go and urge immediate steps, and when the young- ster is in the law's tender clutches, then his scruples about going beyond his powers as agent, or sacrificing his factor's right, or owning his needs, by taking a genteel bribe of two or more purses of sovereigns, will all vanish. This con- science is a very, foolish thing when it fights against interest, and this pride, being above owning one's self to be in want of money, will have to come down," and Brief hur- ried to the tavern, while Montrose walked towards the castle, where he understood Mr. Holt was, meaning there to make a full disclosure of himself, and to ask his advice in the premises. What had passed had not escaped Mr. Delafield. He   AN ADVENTURE.         97 pursued his way also, and more than once, exclaimed, " the time has come for me to make known who I am." "I am to turn over a new page in my history," he con- tinued, "but alas! that page cannot present what the page I can no more turn over presented to me, when I first entered upon this then delightful, but now chequered and painful life! Mr. Montrose," he continued, falling in the same path, and coming up with him, " a word with you." What passed between-them we know not, nor is it peihaps important that we should. The sage Cid Harnet Benengeli, who so fortunately details every particular in the history of the knight of La Mancha, was more favoured with a know- ledge of his hero's movements, than we profess to be in those of our's. This we do know, however. Montrose parted from Mr. Delafield, and at the castle met Mr. Holt; and being gene- rally intent on sports of the field,-and never missing a chance to shoot wild fowl,-he rode down to the house of a cottager or fisherman, who lived on Calvert's Bay. The bay is about ten miles below St. Mary's on the Maryland side of the Potomac, and about five or six miles above the mouth of. the river. Here, in company with the- youth Darnell, he spent the balance of the day, shooting ducks at the mouth of the creek, that empties into Calvert's Bay. Towards sunset Montrose saw quite a raft of what are now known as the canvass-backs, and he and Darnell rowing the boat ashore, Montrose got out, and stole along, intending to take his position behind a tuft of young cedars which were a blind; while Darnell paddled the boat out, and drove the ducks into the sand, Montrose found a clump of young cedars favour- able to his purpose, and gun in hand, squatted behind them. He had hardly taken his position, however, before he felt himself held powerfully by two persons from behind, thrown down upon his face, his hands tied, blindfolded, and borne by two or more men, who spoke in low and unintelligible tones to him; put upon a horse, a man from behind holding him tightly on. The horse was vehemently urged on. He  heard the hoofs of 'another horse as if some one was riding along, and without the power to resist, Montrose was carried for about an hour at a rapid gait, greatly to his discomfort, and vastly more even to his annoyance. He was then taken from the horse, and by two or more persons, one of whdm was evi- dently very athletic, he was dropt as a log in a room, and the YOL,. II,-9 I .      98        PILATE AND HEROD. door fastened upon him. From the first, Montrose, with all his resolution and energy, found resistance useless, and the rapidity with which this movement was executed, left but little time for reflection, and even had time been given him, the unintelligible, indistinct tones of his captors, and his being blindfolded, would have prevented his knowing why he was thus handled. But now that he was left alone, bhe at onz bestirred himself. With a desperate effort he freed his thands from the manacles, and untied the bandage from his eyes. He looked around anxiously to know where. he was, and found himself in a hut, lying on the floor; both the windows and doors of which appeared to be well secured. He next looked to see if any weapon was at hand by which he might repel attack, or act aggressively, and at need force an entrance through the door or window. Under some rub- bish near him he saw a large hatchet, and was in the act of rising to secure it, when he heard voices in the adjoining troom., "This is the fellow at last," said one of the speakers, "what claims all my- land here." "You haint no doubt then," asked the other, , that he mought be the yert man. Supposin you've cotcht the wrong pig by the ear."y "WIhy haven't 1  heerd from England by letter, that Charles Delafield had sailed' to St. Mary's. Didn't Cap- tain Fulford sorter let on that he suspicions this Montrose mought be Charles Delafeld himself." -"All true as natur," said the questioner, "but it 'pears as how, I heerd tell that this mister, we have cotcht, himself telled you he was nobody but Mr. Charles Delafield's agent?" "-That's all a  big lie," said the first, impatiently, and whom we shall call, as Montrose also discovered him to be, Snarler. "But what are you gwine to do with him" asled his questioner. r You don't mean, to keep him here 'till he's starved to death?" "1 No, Robinsbn/' replied Snarler, I ain't such a fool as all that.- I know dead men tell no tales, but he'd take too long to starve to death, and he mought be missed, and sonle ibdy would be poking about here, and let on what I was a driving at," "'Twould be mighty unnatural to $boot him. in sold blood 8   '   !   AN ADVENTURE.         99 so," said. Robinson. "Prehaps you calcilate to give him pisen to eat with his meat'? and he mought be put out of the way, and no one be so mighty wicked arter all, as we couldn't hev made him eat, if he hadn't liked." The talking was now too'low to be heard connectedly. From it, Montrose might conjecture much, and saw his situation to be very critical. "Jim and Bill are big enough to manage him?" he heard Robinson ask. From Snarler's reply he caught an affirma. tive, and then the words, "If he makes much of a splutter, I reckon Bill needn't," here the word was too low to be heard, " but twice." "The devil/' said Montrose to himself, clasping the hatchet tightly, and wishing Snarler's head was within reach of a blow. "This here dog in the yard would tear him should the youngster git out to-night?" asked Robipson. Snarler laughed aloud at the idea of Montrose's escaping. ' You don't know it is a bloodhound, which I got from Havana," said Snarler, "and put here to watch my corn  crib." How, and when, shall we fix him?" asked Robinson. This was the very question which Montrose, himself, would have asked, and he was greatly disappointed that' Snarler's reply was too low for him to hear it. "You think he'll be easy?" asked Robinson. "No, I aint such a-gander as to believe that, if I hadn't so tied him that he's 'bliged to, but that's well thought on. Spose we go in, and see how the youngster gits on, and, if I catches him trying to 'scape, we'll put him where he won't gin us trouble, and then I can pay back the beatings he gin me." Montrose heard this last remark, and his heart beat quicker than he had ever known it to beat before, -That they were both armed, he had every reason to believe; that he would be able to cut his way through them, he thought impossible ; that they meditated his death, or some terrible evil to him, he doubted notf;and, should they enter and find him unban- daged, that his life might be taken by them, he thought most likely. Hence, as they came towards the door of the room where he was confined, stopping, occasionally, and talk- ing, as they approached, he stood ready behind the door to B ell his life dearly, but, though brave and hopeful, full of   xx,.llf'l'ti AI N .I HEtRiODV life, and nerved by far more than ordinary energy, he felt an awful sense of danger. And, in that moment of intense agony, quicker than flowed the life-blood from his heart, as it coursed in the arteries of his system, came visions and thoughts of friends, and others, most dear. Death, under any cir- cumstances, is a fearful crisis, when we have time to think as we approach it; but death to him, with life opening before him with all its vistas of happiness; death, by the hand of such mean and cowardly creatures as Snarler and Robinson; death, whereno one could mark, or would be likely to know, he fell bravely; death, without honour or sympathy; to be butchered, and then hustled into a hole as a dead dog, with a little dirt thrown upon him, and no cry for vengeance to be made, nothing to be done till that great day when all secrets shall be disclosed, was an event full of terror and bitterness. It was hard to swallow down the choking feelings that came over him, and, like a man, to stand up in a negro hut, and an obscure forest, ready to fight hopelessly, with certain death before him. But Montrose was able to do this, and as he stood with his person erect, every muscle strained, lip compressed, and face pale as death, he heard them stop, an& Snarler said, "No use, I reckon. You go and see where's Bill ani Jim.' Montrose breathed freer, and, as soon as he could collect himself, began to devise means of escape. It was now get. ting dark, and he heard the door in the next room open, the crackling of fire in the fre-place there, some low talk between Snarler and Robinson, nd an occasional ejaculation between, as he supposed, the negroes Bill and Jim and then, for the first time, he heard the barking of a dog outside the house. "These fellows must sleep, ere long," said Montrose to him- self,4" and then is my chance, if ever." To attempt an escape before, might lead to the most disastrous consequences. In about two hours, bit, as appeared to Montrose, in ten hours' time, all seemed :o be asleep.. He first tried the only window in the room, tut it could not be forced, without calling up the dog, and the sleepers in the other room. He then tried the door--a desperate remedy this, he knew-but beggars must not be choosers, and he opened the door more easily than he expected. He entered the room very cau- tiously-a cat could hardly have crossed it more stealthily. Light enough was emitted by the fire for him to see the pos-   MONTROSE'S ESCAPE.        101 ture of affairs and persons in it. Snarler lay back in a chair, asleep. Robinson-whom he now saw to be a very large, double-jointed fellow, and hence no longer wondered that he was held so-tightly-lay asleep, his length on the floor. The negroes were before the fire, snoring loudly, while two pistols lay on the table, near Snarler. With the utmost caution, stepping over Robinson's body, and leaning across Snarler's, to reach the table which was the other side of Snarler, Montrose succeeded in seizing the pistols. He examined them quickly, and had just satisfied himself they were loaded, primed, and well flinted, when Robinson, under the influence of a dream, rose to his feet. Montrose's first impulse was to level a pistol at him, ready to fire, if he should make any noise, and that rude figure of colossal life and Herculean vigour, in a moment more, might have been in the agonies of death. But Robinson, more asleep than awake, looked about him a moment, appeared to see no one, and then lay down again. In an instant Montrose was at the door, which he readily opened, and sallied forth; but, as he stept out, the blood- hound prepared to spring on him. With one blow of the hatchet, he broke the dog's jaw, and the creature could only howl; and Montrose hurried on by a path that led from the house, as he hoped, to the main-road which would conduct him to St. Mary's; but, as it turned out, to the bay-side. Here Montrose in about an hour found himself. It was clear star light, and he wandered nearly an hour on the beach, as he supposed, in a south direction; but saw no house, or sign of habitation. He then found his further progress intercepted by a creek, and he saw now that he must either retrace his steps at the risk of encountering Snarler, Robinson, and the negroes who might be in pursuit with another dog to lead them on his tracks; or strike off directly to the right in a dense forest, where there was no clearing, path, or even clue to the point he wished to reach. He found the north star, after looking around some time, and by that might have laid his course, so as to come out not very far from St. Mary's; if he had known how far north or south he was of the ancient city, and, if knowing his bearings, he could in a dense forest have kept a due course in any point or quarter. Difficult, however, as he knew the latter undertaking to be, it seemed advisable to risk it, and as he best could, he kept such a course as in his 9*   102       PILATE AND HEROD. judgment would before morning bring him out not far from St. Mary's. During this while, however, his feelings were any thing but agreeable. He was armed, it is true, and prepared and not unwilling, should it be necessary, to stand at bay, and -face out Snarler, and his associates. But he believed they must have other weapons besides the pistols he had taken. He knew, if aware of-his escape, they would hunt him down as a wolf, and with all his recklessess, and 8. even love of danger, he saw far more peril than glory in an encounter with them. Occasionally he thought he heard a dog's bark in pursuit, and this would quicken his steps. He had travelled, as he judged, ten miles, and it was between midnight and morning and, for the first time since he had turned from the bay-side, he came to a road, that seemed to be well trodden. He was not positive that the road was familiar to him, but still it appeared to him he had seen certain trees before. He quickened his pace, though he felt much fatigued, and in a little time found himself in sight of the castle. All- was quiet at the colonel's, and Montrose soon found his way to his chambers at the Free Briton's. Fatigue gave him no opportunity for much reflection, and in a few minutes he was in a sound sleep. But when he awoke in the morning his head and limbs ached, and he was too un- well to leave his room. In the course of that day he became quite sick, and, either from fatigue, exposure, or anxiety, he was brought nearer to death's door than he had been for years. During his illness his mind was occasionally delirious, and he understood afterwards that his mysterious friend, calling upon him, and finding him so low, nursed him with all the tenderness of a mother, and the affection of, a parent. i But this kind friend had gone to Calvert, leaving a verbal - message of affectionate regard. Shepard was called from St. Mary's by the court thenn i isession in Prince George's. Of Mr. Holt, Parson Gordon, and their families, he heard nothing. The effect of this extreme illness was to sadden deeply his mind, and thoughts of eternity, and a sense of the importance of religion, which he had heretofore shuffled off, as only fit for the aged or moribundis, he dwelt much upon. "I may not hope " said Montrose to himself, "to be a good or even pious -man at once; but I trust to begin or take the steps necessary to make me one.'" Anid, though the youth, in the dreariness of his sick ciamrb i could not, and did not shake off the heydayness so natiral .to him, and, "           *   MONTROSE REFORMED.       . 103 though the sun which came into his windows, with the cheer- ful aspect out of doors, which it revealed of the world and the scenes about him, made him almost impatient to get out and enjoy them; Sickness worked on him a sobering effect. It led heedless rambling impulse to think. It opened -to him a new leaf in his life, and a voice said to him, write on that leaf hereafter holiness to the Lord. What nothing else in this world can effect, as says St. Chrysostom, "a little sickness will correct and amend:" or as St. Paul teacheth, "a light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.'                          ,   CHAPTER XXI. "For herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom; it is still her use, To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, To view w t,h hollow eye, and wrinkled brow An age of poverty." MERCHANT OF VENICE. MVONTROSE had entirely recovered. 'He had heard very recently from England, from his friend Johnson; who was anxious, if he could so arrange his affairs, to come over in the course of the next month, and be married to Julia. Montrose could not divine what was the precise object of Snarler in the violence which he and Robinson had used upon him. He did not know exactly what course to pursue with regard to Snarler. That he might attempt a repetition of the violence, he thought not improbable; and, if he was to be assailed as he had been, weapons would not protect him. "I   cannot put up with this,'" said Montrose, but what can I  do, is the question? I can whip Snarler till he'll rue the day he laid hands upon me; but cui bono? I can't prove the assault, and I should lose in the estimation of some more than the satisfaction is worth; and I am not certain that he may not try the trick again. And yet I feel disposed now to carry the war into the enemy's country. If I could get that will, and have it recorded, I would bet- ter revenge myself than by cuffing him." He   called upon Mr. Holt) who was now alone at Pleasant Lodge. This worthy gentleman received him so graciously, and his manner was so bland, so kind, so courteous, and, as Montrose thought so .unlike, if not superior to that of any other person, that he could not help saying to himself he is the best man in the world, and I want to call him uncle." He mentioned the assault of Snarler, and asked Mr. Holt's advice about it and the will. "I'll do what is proper about the violence used on your person, Mr. Montrose," said Mr. Holt, " leave that to me for the present; but as to the will, I'll call, and let you know n(ext Wednesday." (104)   DIALOGUE.          105 The day designated, Mr. Holt called, and after a long conversation took his leave. A     few hours after Mr. Holt's departure, Shepard, having returned from Prince George's, he and Montrose were riding on the road between St. Mary's town and the head of the river, and the following remarks passed between them. "You wish to make old Snarler," said Shepard, " dis- gorge a certain will that you are anxious to have recorded. Perhaps, friend Montrose, a spice of revenge may season the very prudent considerations which urge you to this step?" "No, none, I assure you," said Montrose, " the law or some other power," kindling as he spoke, '".may bring that on him as an after-clap. - No, Shepard, Mr. Holt advises me to make a second effort to get the will, and has just informed me that Snarler, how he knew I cannot tell, will be on this road this afternoon, and has in his portmanteau the will, which Mr. Holt says is tied-up in a bundle of papers by a red string." "All right enough, Sir Knight," replied Shepard, -" but how are you to get old Snarler to disgorge. He has refused your request, backed by a bribe of one hundred pounds. Do you mean to increase the offer? Or, do you mean to do the thing more genteely still, as some fellows did with Father Hunter lately, and as Snarler and -:Robinson did with you, or, Don Quixote-like, in theway of true knigh-.errantry, play the part, I mean, of a knight of the highway; bawl out lus- tily, the will, sir, oryour life, and you will show. yourclever- ness, at the same time, by clapping a pistol to Snarler's breast; while I, Shepard, the squire, am to stand by, and see that your knighthood wants nothing?" Montrose laughed, and said, "Not exactly. I mean to have this will. Coaxing, I fear, will not get it." Not so fast,' said his friend, 4grease the old fellow's hand well with gold, and the will will slip out of it into your possession. 6  Always put off to the last the fortiter in re; at least till the suaviter in modo has totally failed. A mean man, like Snarler, is only approachable on the side of self- interest. This is his blind side, and, like the one-eyed stag, who always fed with her blind eye to the ocean, not appre- hending danger from that quarter, and from that quarter was approached and shot, so may Snarler. But be sure that your priming is gold dust, your powder that chemical preparation which shoots' but makes no noise, your wadding t , .   106       PILATE AND HEROD. bank notes, well rammed in; and don't forget to put in a silver bullet. And then, if your game should prove invin- cible, why then bring him to terms as you can." "You are right, and I wish now only to make such a demonstration as will, without violence, accomplish my ob- ject," Shepard smiled, persuaded that Montrose meant to do more than he said. "Excellent," he continued, ",and a very formidable ally, you will have in your squire;" stroking down his long beard, and surveying his person complacently. "I want your presence also, should the will come into my possession, to bear witness to the fairness of the transaction." "Bravo," said Shepard, "you mean to have the will, whether Snarler surrenders it with a curse or a smile; and yet you mean to use no violence. You wish me to testify that you did only what our laws empower, meaning by this that I am not to see or know aught to your discredit. If you choke the will out of him, I am to say that his grimaces were pleasant smiles,  And should a-- censorious court and jury reject your squire's testimony, because the knight and squire are one person, like man and wife,' and, therefore, my testimony being before the court, this honourable body is to believe that you are a disciple of Friar Bacon, and can take a thing out of a portmanteau without touching it." Montrose again said, he meant to use no violence, and hoped Shepard lwould interfere if he should. "Very good," replied his friend, "you will hold his hand while I open his portmanteau. But what is to be my gueraon? For I wish to sell my co-operation at a good price, I never having been employed before in the very genteel business of highway robbery. Let this guerdon then be something above the common order, as Mrs. Annie?" 4Agreed," replied Montrose, extending his hand, "Mrs. Annie shall be yours." "If you can give her to me; but, to give her to me, she must first be yours :unless, as you mean to take the will from Snarler without touching it, you can pass Mrs. Annie over to my tender and reverential care, without first having the guardianship of her yourself. For here, instead of saying, ex nihilo nihil fit, we say ex nihilo multurm fit." "Make yourself easy," laughing, "Miss Gordon will ac- complish this business for me."   DIALOGUE.          107 "Really, sir knight, your squire has a worse chance, te derce, than did Sancho of being made governor by the knight of the rueful countenance." "Sancho was governor after all," said Montrose, "and you may be as happy in your kingdom of Elfin Hall, as Governor Sancho was in his island of Barataria." ' But Miss Emma is first to be caught, and then Mrs. Annie. I fear, sir knight, the first bird may fly as much too high for you as Mrs. Annie does for me." "That's true," said Montrose falling into a s'erious vein, and lowering his voice. ' Joking apart, that girl, I know, flies too high for me. I never felt worthy to company along with her. I am grovelling here on base earth, while she is soaring in the pure empyrean. I admire her at an awful distance, and when allowed to approach her, feel- that I am in the presence of a divinity, whom it is my pleasure and duty to pay all obeisance to; but my lips have not dared to breathe to her a lover's devotion." "Yon falcon, then, perching too high to condescend to seat herself on your finger, my bird is to be uncaught; and you and I, like two silly urchins who stand open-mouthed gazing on two noble eagles that are soaring aloft, may stand at a respectful distance, admire, adore. but never win our ladies fair."  That may be," said Montrose, "but-" "Ah I here's your game," interrupted Shepard, laying his hand on his shoulder, and pointing to a figure just ahead. "A truce to moralizing now. Nab him, and we may nab the birds of better plumage afterwards. But take care," trying to restrain Montrose, whose face turned red and pale on seeing Snarler, "he don't soil your fingers. Buzzards won't bear handling." "Halt there!" called out Montrose in a commanding tone, spurring his horse, anddashing furiously ahead. The person addressed, Snarler, stopt a moment, undecided what to do. The first thought with him was that one of his debtors, who had suffered from his pressure, was about to make him a second payment, and in coin too that would tell on Snarler's back, and not in his pocket. The captious man dIrew out a clumsy pistol, and trembling held it in front of him. The sight of the pistol made Montrose forget his pacific resolution, and determined him to violence, and, before Snarler, whose sight'was indifferent, could shoot or recog-   108       PILATE AND HEROD. nize him he collated him, and said: "A word with you. Give me the will of the late Mr. Snarler. Mr. Shepard will see it recorded." A wasp, who is assailed from an unexpected quarter, could not hafe been more waspish. 'Hating Montrose, for more reasons than one, Snarler struck furiously at him with the whip he held in his left hand.' The Bblow missed Mon- trose, but strtck his horse, and made him rear up. Snarler, boiling with anger, fired his -pistol almost in' the face of Montrose. I Shepard could seewhat passed, but was too far off to' interfeie. The pistol, however,' was fired by a man who' was more wratthy tan brav6e; and: it only the more maddened Montrose who: might have handled Snarler very severely, if Starler's horse had not at that moment plunged, and thrown h'is rider to the ground.' On his fall, the horse dashed diown a small hill, and in; descending it, fell. The valise or portmanteau rolled off, burst open, and emptied its contents on the road. "An admirable mishap!  said Shepard, espying the envelope with the red string. "What is picked up in the road is not stolten. What is taken before the owners eyes is done openly.: Whe n a man 'restores to lthe public what belongs of right to the public, he is: a public benefactor. Ergo, sir knight," Montrose came up then, "'pick up this will, pass it into my possesSion, to have it registered, and Mr. Snarler can testify that you have done. a praiseworthy deed; nay more, :carried out, iby giving publicity to his last will and testament, the last wishes of a dying man." And, wliispering to MontroSe , I hold you: to your promise that Mrs. Annie will stoop from her lofty -yrie, and sit upon the bough with me." Snarler by this time had risen, caught his horse, and was in the act of mounting. -Observing that Shepard had not returned the will to the portmanteau: he talked of prosecu- ting them as robbers.  "Prosecuting?" said' Montrose. "4There is a settlement yet to be made for your dastardly attempt on my: life at Calvert's Bay."t Snarler turned very pale;; not suspecting before% that Montrose knew who did it. "Oh! don't prosecute," said Shepard. "It would be a dreadful thing to be tried; for highway robbery," And then changing his ironical tone, "You shoot badly.: From the limping of your horse. I should judge that you had shot   DIALOGUE.          109 him instead of Mr. Montrose. Well, never too late to learn. Let your next lesson be, that a highway robber and your horse are not the same person." & Snarler made. a kind of half effort to resieze his will. Shepard held him off with one hand, and then lifting him up, put him on his horse, and said: "Come, friend Good Nature, ride, and clear yourself. Thank your stars you met on the road side two good Sama- ritans. Come, I say, ride, in a moment, or I'll tie'you to your beast with your head to his tail, and then, like Mrs. Gincum Crancum, in a state suited to'your merits, you will ride through the city of St. Mary's." Snarler saw that he was in the hands of one who was able to do what he said, and who was believed to be not at all scrupulous about doing, when he had determined what it were well to do. He rode off sullenly, grunted a curse at Montrose, not knowing what to say to Shepard. The friends turned their horses' heads to St. Mary's, meaning to have the will registered without delay. They had not rode far before they met the jolly priest of St. Inigoes', and Shepard accosting him heartily, said: "So, father, while we played the part of good Samari- tans, you, priest-like, passed by on the other side. But, pray, when you meet the wounded traveller, infuse into him more of the balm of human feeling." They then mentioned the incident, and Father Canon en- joyed the adventure. "A very Sir Andrew Ague Cheek, gentlemen, and as old Will says, 'if he were opened, and you could find so much blood as would clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of the anatomy.' "A pleasant man, father," said Shepard, "and we have made him yet more agreeable. I fear you would find him quite a different spirit from the one you laid." No doubt," said the priest. Snarler is a lean-visaged, and burnt-up liver son of Calvin." "The other," interrupted Shepard, "which you laid, is a fat and jolly son of holy church." "Come," said the priest, "any message for Elfin Hall? "Yes," replied Shepard, "my friend and myself are dying to pay our respects to her, and I invoke her image more devoutly than she does the virgin's." "Well," said the priest, laughing, " leave your matters VOL. II.-10   'IV       PIILATE AND HEROD. to my management, and I will use my pastoral authority to bring Mrs. Annie to terms." "Do so, good father' said Shepard, with mock gravity, "'and I will spend half my income in masses and charities." "That means," joined in Montrose, "that, having spent his substance on his beard and his wines, he will give you half of an income, which, like a particular estate at law, is in nubibus." u"All the better for being in the clouds," said Father Canon. "I'll see that friend Shepard, from his cloudy estate, rains down upon me a shower of gold, and all in advance too." "Seeing as how," said Shepard, laughing, "said cloudy estate is as well situated, defined, and bounded as is, father, your favourite and much talked of country Limbo, for un- baptized children and the Old Testament folks. A country, you know, which once upon a time his Satanic majesty visited, and found it large and broad, where go those, who dying, put on the weeds of Dominic or Francis; by so doing, hoping to escape the old fellow's clutches. But," continued Shepard, looking quizzically at Father Canon, "as one Milton- reports of Limbo that it is the paradise of fools, and  borders close on to that hot country, where will go the devil you potted at Mrs. Doolittle's. My estate, though a cloudy one, is too high for fools to soar to, and too cool for the smoky gentlemen you exorcise to dwell in." +^  "Be it so, be it so," said Father Canon, impatiently. "I'll have the shower of gold, then, if your estate is so well situated and bounded; but, remember, friend Shepard, I give no long credits. The poor folks in Limbo have a long time to wait before receiving their pay. I must have mine in hand, even if it is to come from the clouds, before I place Mrs. Annie's hand in your's. For you blades are not to be trusted. I know them well. They cut every one." "And most, perhaps," replied Shepard, "the fingers of those who try to hold them." The parties now separated, and we will follow Father Canon. who rode on slowly, and in about two hours' time rode past Mrs. Doolittle's house, where the ghost was laid. Here he stopt and asked for the Irish woman, and was told she had gone to Coode's ruin. "He can't be here long," said Father Canon, muttering *   A SPIRIT.         1" to himself as he pursued his way. "And if no better than he were shriven and absolved, St. Teter's keys would rust for want of using."  He -came now in front of the ruin we have mentioned. The moon was not up, the night was nearly calm,-a slight breeze from the Potomac whispered among the trees, and all else appeared to be wrapt in stillness about; the ruin; darkness now adding its power to the scene. The priest dismounted, and, having fastened his horse to a tree, was approaching the front door, muttering, "He can't be here long. Well for him if he were even in Limbo;" when something seemed to be drawing near,--and his first thought was of Katy, which a second glance made him abandon. So unusual was the sight, that, familiar as Roman priests are by some supposed to be, with thoughts of the supernatural, and potent as Father Canon professed to be in laying the disturbed spirits of the nether world, this one, if a spirit, came in so questionable a shape that he wanted Hamlet's courage to speak to it; but devoutly, as usual in difficulty, began to cross himself. He looked again, and with more fear than he would have allowed was possible; when he saw a figure tall and graceful, with something thrown over the head, standing before him. The face was nearly hid, and the darkness besides, he was able to see but two large and piercing eyes, that even in the dark shone upon him. The little he saw of the complexion showed a dark or swarthy-.: . hue-and the singular silence of the figure disposed the : - priest to believe that now, if never before, he'stood in the 5;/ i presence of the dead. Crossing himself anew with much agitation, he repeated quickly, more than once, "Audi et time Satana, recede, recede;" waving his hand hurriedly, and slowly retreating the while. The figure, however, con- tinued to advance, and Father Canon, having to do with an antagonist, more or less than flesh and blood, as regularly retreated. His bulky and heavy person, however, did not move easily, and fear rendered his breathing hurried and painful.. The figure rather gained upon him, and the father wished he was mounted on his good horse, whose legs, better than his own, could bear him hence. As it was, he still repeated, but faintly, "Audi et time Satana, recede, re- cede ;" that is, hear and tremble Satan, retire, retire. But the figure minded not his exorcism. Prospero, it seemed, had broken his wand. And, if this mystery had continued ,   "2     -  PILATE AND HEROD. much longer, the priest would have trusted to his legs, though they might have refused to second his wish. But the figure now halted, anid, in a manner at once graceful and imposing, waved him to. follow. Father Canon could not divine who, or what was the figure, and of course could not conjecture the nature of the office which was required of him, He had been taught, however, to school his feelings, and, recovering his self-possession, and moving mechanically, when an official or professional act was to be done, from the force of habit he obeyed. He had not gone many yards before three females came in sight, and he was amazed to recognize Mrs. Annie, Emma, and Julia, and in Adaratha, the figure which had alarmed him. The ladies briefly told him that, during the morning, they were sailing down the creek, and, on passing Coode's ruin, at which they gazed some time, they saw a white object wave from one of the upper windows. It soon fell to the water-side; and, supposing it was a signal, they directed the oarsmen to pull ashore. As in the broad day-light they thought they might safely venture in and about the house, Julia and Annie, by this time, being nearly free from the fears they had had about the place, and Emma, unable as she was to account for the lights and noises which the cre- dulous negroes represented as most marvellous, was "not unwilling once more to explore the strange mansion. They picked up on landing a white handkerchief, the object seen i to fall, and saw on it, chiefly to Annie's surprise,- her  mother's maiden name, Jane .Yeo, in her mother's well known hand. How came her mother's handkerchief there? Untying a knot in the handkerchief, they saw a piece of paper enclosed with the name of John Coode written on it; and Mrs. Annie then remembered that she had heard that the once distinguished John Coode, in his palmiest days, a short time before her mother's marriage to Mr. Darnell, had evinced, a decided admiration of her. By some means he obtained this handkerchief, and may have prized it as a golden link connecting him to a golden past,-a fragrant memento of days that were more odorous than a bed of violets. Coode is then alive," said Mrs. Annie, ' was our con- clusion,-perhaps sick and suffering in this rickety house. We parlied a minute or so; the negroes tried to coax us out of it, but our minds were made up."   JOHN COODE.         113 "You saw the dreaded John Coode?" asked the priest. "He is not a raw head and bloody bones as you thought?" "Poor man!" said Emma, " he is at death's door. He tried very hard to say something to us, but we could make out nothing." "What brings you here now?" asked the priest. "It wouldn't do to let him die without trying to help him all we could," replied Emma, "and, night as it was, and ugly as is the house and the reports about it, it seemed uglier to leave him here to die with no one by him 'As our boat reached here, we heard your horses' hoofs, and Adaratha went off-to reconnoitre." The party then entered,-all was still, and it had become very dark. The priest whispered his fears that the last agony was over. They ascended the stair-case, and went in the room to the left. Emma's fearful dream flashed upon her. The darkness and silence, and the thought that the terrible John Coode lay a corpse in the room, made her shudder as she looked around to see and hear what might be moving. "He is dead," whispered the priest, slowly advancing. "I'll strike a light;" and taking a tinder-box out of his pocket, he soon lit a candle which he produced from one of his capacious pockets.  But Coode they found alive, though almost gone. The eyes of the dying man passed slowly from one to the other of the party, and a faint expression of recognition, they thought they saw, as he looked at Father Canon; but faint it was, as in that fast failing edifice of mortality there was but the dimmest spark of light out of its windows. "'Tis as I feared," muttered Father Canon. "Katy has been here, but has gone, and, in her simple but mistaken kindness, has shaken faster than need be the poor wretch's hour-glass. He was on a bed, hard enough I thought, but she has stretched, or, may be, dragged him on the floor to hasten his dying; and, poor creature," he continued, look- ing at the sick man, "she has done her best for him. The relics and ashes, are laid on him. She thinks now the iron hold he had on life will be snapt asunder." Turning now to Emma and company, who understood 'but imperfectly *Father Canon's soliloquy, the priest, in a low and hurried, and at times interrupted tone, said:  "He was poor, wicked, and old.  His passions were 10*   "4        PILATE AND' iEROD. enough to have burnt up the liver of half a dozen common men. He was poor as Lazarus, but proud as Lucifer; and, buttor the doles of charity Icontrived to bring him, he might have died of very leanness, before old age and a demon-like disposition could have ended him. But, to pay him in part for his persecution of the Catholics, he was allowed to live, and made to die, as he is, by inches,-by piece-meal. See," pointing to the dying man, "he lies nearly as he has lain for weeks. His hearing is nearly gone, his sight dim, his feet unable to drag him along, his voice only occasionally able to speak out,-which he did, you say, unintelligibly and with great labour; and thus, like that creeper in the window, he holds on still; though life is nearly gone. Ah! if I had an elixir' to make him well, he'd buy it on any terms. -Yes,.yes," surveying Coode as he spoke, "he'd promise and swear to lift no more that skinny' hand against holy church. But no elixir can save him now." And Father Canon, having hastily robed himself, hurried to prepare ,for death a dying map, whose every faculty was so nearly dead as to be almost useless. He sprinkled him with holy water, i-signed him with the cross, put the images of the Saviour and virgin to his lips, and said most rapidly a Latin prayer, asking the saints to obtain for Coode a re- mission of part of the heavy purgatorial punishment he was soon to feel. ..He then put in his cold hand ,a blest candle, to make a profession of his faith. . John Coode lay now a sad relic. His head, features, and frame were large, while .his pale face, hollow eyes, white hairs, general decrepitude and feebleness seemed not to belong to that unquiet and ruling spirit which led the oppo. sition in the Assembly, and whose voice was a trumpet in the Protestant Revolution. And as he lay there breathing painfully;, and, as if by a spasmodic effort, throwing his head first to one,; and then to the other side, groaning, no hope beyond the grave appeared to;light up his: glazing eye, no cheering call from that dread world seemed to fall sooth- ingly on his dull ears,-nothing cast athwart his dark coun- tenance one ray of peace.* * McSherry, without any authority that T can, trace, states that John Coode had orders in the English Church. In the history of the province, arid owing perhaps to his military"efforts in " the Protestant Revolu- tion," he is called Caiptain Coode, and-afterwards he filled some im- portant civil posts. During all which time we read not that he was a teverend. To have had orders in the English Church, he must have i,                   w^   ROMANISM WRONG.          115 -i The ladies turned away, in ordernot to witness the last conflict in which the iron frame of the giant yields as cer- tainly before the grim monster's grip as the tiny and help- less babe.  -  "We'll go; 'tis over." "What! Leave him   all alone here?" asked Julia, shuddering, and hardly conscious of the force of her ques- tion. The priest bowed assent. "Alone!" thought Emma.   "No! his spirit soon, per- haps already, stands with a countless host;" and she. trem. bled as she added mentally, "Oh! I trust not where the rich man lifted up his eyes being in torment." Father Canon gave his horse to one of Mrs. Annie's ser. vants to ride over to Elfin Hall, while he accompanied the ladies in the boat. Annie and Emma sat at one end, and Julia and Father Canon at the other end of the boat; and Emma, in a low tone, expressed to Annie her amazement that, instead of dying, as did the saints of old, raising their eyes to heaven, and saying,  Lord Jesus  receive my spirit," Romanists kiss the images of Christ and the Virgin Mary,-hold on to a blest candle with the trembling grasp of a dying person, and say, ' Jesus, Mary, have mercy on me ', With the heart manbbelieveth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.'  "Oh, don't talk to'me of this now! The scene harrows my mind!" said Annie.  "Romanism  is all wrong, Annie,"-still speaking low. "Sweet as may sound to some the hymn    Ora. pro nobis,' the cry, 'Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me,' will sooner call sweet mercy down. I tell you, Annie, when the soul is trembling  on the brink of eternity, made a trip to England. But while Captain Coode, and not Reverend, he fell into disgrace and fled from the province. How unlikely that at such time he should have sought, much more been honouredwith holy orders! Coode was permitted to return to the province, and proceed- ings were stayed against him on the ground of his years and infirmity; and no allusion is mnade to the sacred profession, as a reason for ex- tending favours to him,- Thus history tells us he;was a political leader in the lower house of Assembly the master-spirit in the Protestant Revolution, captain-general of the militia of St. Mary's County, and collector of the port of St. Mary's, and that he was noted for his infi" delity and blasphemy. Could the charity which hopeth all things have added, and he was in orders in the Church of England?   "6       PILATE AND HEROD. 'tis madness to ask the prayers of a creature like our- selves." While this conversation was going on between Annie and Emma, Julia, from a variety of motives which she herself probably neither investigated nor cared much to know, asked Father Canon to tell her why he worshipped the Virgin. The priest,'nothing surprised, knowing her impulsiveness and ingenuousness, went to work in his peculiar way to answer her. He quoted the Douay version, where it reads, "She," i e. the Virgin, " shall bruise the serpent's head;" told her that in the 44th Psalm she is called, "Queen of heaven ;" that in the Gospel she is said to be " full of grace," and that it is added, " all generations shall call her blessed." At this point of his remarks, Emma and Annie gave attention to him. Father Canon then, with the easy confidence with wlich he would have delivered the clearest truths, and we say not, they did not appear to him as such, represented that St. Ignatius had said, "No sinner can be saved but by recourse to the blessed Virgin ;" that St. Chrysostom had declared that "Mary had been chosen from all eternity to save by her mercy those whom her Son, in justice, cannot pardon :" that St. Augustine called her, our only advocate in heaven ;" and the priest hastily referred to Ephrem Cyrus,: John Damascenus, St. Ildephonsus, especially to the Colly- ridian heresy, in further proof. "Now," continued he, "you Protestants care as little about fathers in the church, as we do about Luther and Calvin, its'apostate sons. St. Ignatius, you say, was but an old man, and his testimony is no better than the gabble of a garrulous old witness in court. St. Austin, you say, was bishop of a mean city, and only ranked high because he lived among the Africans, a savage people. St. Chrysostom, you say, may have been golden mouthed, but Plato was more- bees sipped honey from his lips. The saints' homilies, you tell us, are rhetorical and eloquent, but not sound in doc- trine. For, it seems, you Protestants think eloquence and learning never were, or can be married together.

And, as to Ephrem, the Syrian, Damascenus, and St. Ildephonsus, they, accord- ing to your teachers, were lazy monks, who, in the cloister's solitude, wanting other employment, concocted this worship of the Mother of God-a pretty fancy, they allow, for young imaginations to kindle around. There is a good deal of poetry in our thoughts of Eve, moving in holy simplicity, and unconscious beauty, about the garden of Eden, and these clever monks have given the fellow to this picture of Eve, as lovely a picture of the Madonna. For, radiant with loveliness, and fragrant with holiness, she is the sweetest bud that ever grew on the stock of mortality." "Have you any other reasons?" asked Julia. Father Canon had a particular regard for the ladies, and his eyes beamed kindlier than usual, as he replied, to this question, "You know, that on Assumption Day, the blessed Virgin ascended to heaven. Now, Enoch was taken up into heaven, Elijah went up in a chariot of fire, our Lord ascended there, and why not His mother?" "The Bible don't say so," said Julia. "If it did, your translation wouldn't have it," he replied. "Your witch-ridden king could believe in witches riding in the air on a broomstick, but the Mi-other of God, he thought, was more tied down to this world than an old hag of a woman." And Father Canon spoke of apostles being present at the Virgin's death-bed, and of St. Mary being carried to heaven amid a vision of angels, and the melody of angel harpers, while angels and apostles, all the while singing a divine psalmody, laid her body in a coffin in a garden of Gethsemane. "You believe, then, in the propriety of asking the prayers of departed saints?" asked Emma, expressing some surprise in her manner, and anxious to elicit such an answer as would reveal truly, without disguise, the opinion of Father Carfon. "I believe in the propriety of asking the prayers of departed saints?" replied he, " why not? We pray for each other, and believe our prayers are more than breath thrown away, or sound made, or syllables uttered by the organs of speech. They reach the mercy-seat, and are potent to evoke to the help of our friends, some good angels, who otherwise might have allowed them to go on in their evil ways worse and worse. And we believe that our prayers unquestionably   "8        PILATE. AND HEROD. avail, if coming from pure lips, and a holy heart, for, says St. James, 'the continual prayer of a just man availeth much,' apd yet we, the best of us, are what?" he spoke with an abruptness and stare, facing Emma, that made her start, " but bits of clay dressed up in silk and woollen, our nether parts resting on leather, and our upper stories roofed by fur, or straw. We are only moving pieces of corruption that are fit to grace the worm's banquet chamber, and from whose inner, no less than our outer man, steam up foul vapours continually; yet we claim that our prayers go up as sweet incense! How much more likely that the prayers of a departed saint should avail, who is free' from earth's sin and stain, who has passed into that holy place where they - see face to face, who, free from sin themselves, and glorified, can boldly approach the mercy-seat, and ask favours there? But time presses. Here we are at Elfin Hall. More at another time. So good night. Dominus vobiscum."  And Father Canon rode on. "This is too bad," said Emnia, mentally, after they had entered the house. '"Annie is nearly free from the meshes of that Father Hunter and his church, but this worship of the saints and the virgin has a wonderful hold upon her. And what has passed to-day, has only, I fear, added to her delusion. Poor Annie! between her doubts, hopes, and fears about Mr. Shepard, and her unfixed state, I fear she is too much excited for her good."   Annie looked serious and thoughtful, Julia said nothing, and Emma retired to her room with feelings of a mixed and disagreeable character, / trusting that He, who could bring light out of darkness, would enlighten the way before her friend, directing her in all her doings with His most gracious favour, and furthering her with His continual help. )' /   CHAPTER XXII. JULIA FINDS HER FATHER--THE INVOCATION OF SAINTS. "They are at rest; We may not stir the heaven of their repose By rude invoking voice, or prayer addrest In waywardness to those, Who in the mountain grots of Eden lie, And hear the fourfold river as it murmurs by." LYRA APOSTOLICA. EMMA had not been long in her chamber before she heard a loud knocking at the front door, and from the movement below stairs, inferred that Annie and Julia were still up. She next heard the door open, and then a scream which she knew to be Julia's; and began hastily to dress herself, fear- ing something had happened, when a servant girl entered and said-with a negro's perversion of a simple story, that Mr. Delafield, Miss July's father, who had been dead these great many years, had come to life again. Emma knew not how to interpret the wondrous tale, and had reached the door, in the act of going down, when she could just distin guish Julia's voice; saying, "My father, my own father," and heard a manly voice, though apparently broken by ex. cess of emotion, say, "My daughter, my dear Julia!" "'Tis even so," said Emma, standing in the door, irreso- lute what to do. "Can it be possible?"  And she looked around, and tried to collect herself, and see if it were not a dream.   "No, sober reality," she continued. The voices were still heard, but lower, and then a man's voice talking rapidly, as if narrating something.  "I will not intrude," said Emma, returning, and seating herself in a chair. In about half an hour Mrs. Annie came up   to Emma's room, and, repeating what the servant should have said, added that Julia had not only found her father, but her brother Charles, " and who," said Annie, looking inquiringly into Emma's face, as if she would drag out its secret, and read there what the owner might not wish to have known, "who do you think is Julia's brother Charles?" (119)   120        PILATE AND IIEROD.         J "Can he be Mr. Montrose?" replied Emma, with assumed calmness. , Who else," said Annie, with evident pleasure, "could Mr. Montrose be? I suspected it. And besides Mr. Holt is here. Mr. Delafield made himself known to him, and they came down here together; and at another time I'll tell you what he has just been saying. But come, they are expect- ing you." And she hurried Emma down stairs. Emma was struck with the intellectual, but care-worn ap- pearance of Mr. Delafield, and saw a likeness to Montrose. But no exclamation that was made that interesting night, on an occasion which Emma, with her warm filial affections, keenly felt, and nothing that then happened in the happy group, which she saw, as she came into the drawing room, struck her more forcibly and touchingly than a few remarks which fell from Adaratha, and her characteristic attitude and manner, as she made them. "Me happy," said the poor Indian girl. "Julia find old and young eagle come back again. Eagle fly way over the big water; but he no leave his Julia for good. He old now, and want he young brave to stand round him, and his young flower to bloom by his side. But Croshaw and Adaratha no tired; they gone! gone!" and she pointed to the west. "They no cross the big water there, no, ho," shaking her head, " too deep, too big;" she paused, and then proceeded; for the company entered too deeply into her feelings to in- terrupt her. "Julia's home happy now. Birds sing there; heap flower bloom, and young vine stay close to oak tree, and no fear storm harm it. Me glad for -Julia. But me heard whip-poor-will cry to-night, and me cry too. Adaratha see no Croshaw, no Adaratha come back there; Adaratha home no home now. The owl set on old tree, and scream., Heap weed; no flower; no home."  And with an expres- sion of forced resignation, Adaratha seated herself on a chair, looking the picture of loneliness. The next morning the company at Elfin Hall were out by the creek-side, near by which some negroes were hauling the seine for herrings. Adaratha, who was among them, seemed to :have recovered from her melancholy on the previous night, and, being more intent on gathering flowers than in noticing the fish, as they were thrown ashore by the seine, turned a little aside t9 the right in the woods; and was soon busied gathering the blossoms of the wild honey-suckle.   INVOCATION OF SAINTS.       121 All at once, Mrs. Annie, whose fears were apt to be on the qui vive, and who was as disposed to challenge coming events and persons, and ask to what they tended, and whether they came as the herald of good or bad news, as sentinel at his post to challenge and demand the countersign-Mrs. Annie, we say, discovered that the Indian girl was engaged in a personal encounter with some person or thing, which or what she knew not. Annie gave the alarm. Mr. Delafield has- tened to Adaratha's assistance, and found she had killed a large black viper. "Good, good,'a said Mr. Delafield, a Ipsa conteret caput trium. She shall bruise thy head. My Indian girl, you have doubly fulfilled the prophecy. As the seed of the wo- man you have bruised the serpent's head, and being your- self a woman and a maiden, you have bruised it also, though Roman doctors make the ipsa, she, to mean the virgin only." "Ah! this is the coluber cacodemon," said Mr. Holt, coming up, " which Adaratha has killed. Its hiss she ought to have heard, and she was rash in troubling it, for its fangs are very large, and its slaver is said to be nearly as poison- ous as is that of the rattlesnake. Strange antipathy hare most of Adam's offspring to serpents of all kinds, as if in revenge for his tempting our first mother, and, I must say, I share it with them, for I killed, one morning this spring, five mocassins, and which I kill generally with more satis- faction than I do even the rattlesnake, for the latter act on the oli me tangere principle, but the first are not only venomous, but will strike at your shadow. You said just now," continued Mr. Holt, addressing himself to Mr. Dela- field, ' that Roman doctors applied the words, as rendered in our version, (It shall bruise thy head,' to the virgin, by whose power Satan, according to them, is to be crushed. You read theology in early life, I believe, and know how to meet the Roman doctors here?" {' My friend, I hope, is in no danger of Roman entangle- ments?" looking with a little concern on Mr. Holt. The latter smiled, and said, "No; but in'a 'conversation that passed lately between Mr. Hunter, the Roman priest who has charge here, I was struck with his ingenious subtlety in getting rid of the charge of idolatry from the worship his church renders to the virgin and the saints. Thus, their worship of angels he calls dulia, from the Greek douleia, service; that of the virgin hyper- VOL. In.-"   122       PILATE AND HEROD. dulia, or a service above; and, the worshp of God latria, which means service likewise. Whether Jlatria is more, or even as much as dulia and hyperdulia, and whether God is more or less adored than saints and the virgin, the words themselves do not determine." "No," interrupted Mr. Delafield, "nor does Scripture either. For in the Greek, or Septuagint version of the Old Testament, and in the original Greek of the New, latria and douleia have one and the same meaning. Thus, in 1 Thes- salonians, (i. 9,) and in Hebrews, (ix. 14,) douleia and latria are both applied to the worship of God. Consequently, the worship of God is douleia no less than it is latria, and hence, if the saints be worshipped with douleia, they are worshipped as God; and, if the virgin be adored with hyperdouleia, she is worshipped above, or even more than God is adored." "Yes, yes," continued Mr. Holt, smiling, "I made this objection to Father Hunter, and was told I was ignorant of the distinction of terms, and that we must not look to the Bible for scholastic refinements. Thus, said he, adoration literally means, to kiss the hand-manum ad os admovere. W:erefore, when we kiss the hand of her majesty, Queen Alne, we mean not to adore her, for, anciently, and even to this day in the Greek church, it was customary to do even more, e. g., to kiss the foot of every bishop, and, when this was done, the language used was, proskuno se, I worship thee. Hence, he contended, without abating aught from, or trenching on God's honour, the embroidered cross which is on Pope Clement's right foot." "As far as the present pope is personally concerned," interrupted Mr. Delafield, "he deserves more homage for his learning than many of his predecessors are entitled to." "Wherefore," resumed, Mr. Holt, "Father Hunter ar- gued we may kiss the images of the virgin and the saints." "A mere patch-work of Jesuitical refinement," said Mr. Delafield. "It was well understood, when an ancient bishop's foot was kissed, he was not worshipped as God. So, when a king's hand is kissed, we render due homage only to the highest functionary in the state, but not as God. Now, according to God's word, we may not worship any other than God Himself. Christ said to Satan, 'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.' In Re- velation, (xix. 10,) the angel would not let St. John worship him, but said, 'See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant.   ANGEL WORSHP.         123 X Worship God.' On another occasion, when overcome by the megaleia, wonderful things he saw, (and who would not have been?) St. John fell down to worship before the feet of the angel,'the angel said, 'See thou do' it not: for I am thy fellow servant. Worship God.' How clear and posi- tive is the prohibition, then, to worship departed saints? to worship one, or what is less, than an angel? At all events, we may not worship what is not more than an angel, a departed saint, especially may we not do it, when the objec- tions here are that we must not worship any but God (which an angel is not,) and that we must not worship a fellow servant like unto ourselves, which a departed saint is, even more than an angel." "Do you not think," asked Mr. Holt, "that angel worship gavrise to saint worship? In Colossians (ii. 18,) St. Paul alludes to 'worshipping of angels,' which he condemns as showing 'a fleshy mind.' In Romans (i. 25,) he charac- terizes worshipping and serving the creature more than the Creator as changing the truth of God into a lie. But sadits' worship was not condemned, simply because it did no prevail, for St. Paul would have said of it that it also cl thp truth of God into a lie." "I think so," replied Mr. Delafield. "Yea, more, e virgin herself could be heard, she would say to her de sed and superstitious worshippers, in the words of the angel in Revelation, 'See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant. Worship God.' Now, the mere act of kissing the images, and of bowing down before images and pictures of the virgin, the saints, and the cross, are degrees of idolatry, if not idola- try to the worst extent, and we cannot know that they do not carry the homage of the affections, even the prostration of mind' and heart, besides the worship of the body, which constitute the worship of God-a very prostration, indeed, debasing the worshipper to a poor and pitiable idolator." "Yes," said Mr. Holt, "take for example the shrines on the way-side, which we find in Roman Catholic countries, the relics of medieval superstition and ignorance. Before them the way-worn pilgrim humbly kneels, and at times with tears and a heart deeply impressed, and tone of voice eloquent of true emotion, he implores the Mother of God to pray and do for him. And here in St. Mary's, on their mantels, you find contemptible shrines, or wretched images,   124        PILATE AND HEROD. which are looked to most devoutly. And if this be not worship, what is?"  "I suppose," interrupted Mr. Delafield, "Mr. Hunter met this objection as the Jesuits in China get over their  i worship of the idol Chacinchoan? You know they say that, while they bend the reverent knee to Chacinchoan, they address their prayers mentally to Christ. A species of logic that will do for a Jesuit, but not for an honest man. What would be thought of a witness who should testify knowingly to a falsehood, and should contend, ,when charged with bearing false witness, that though hisJips said one thing, his heart meant another?" "Yes," replied Mr. Holt, 'he said the genuflexions prove nothing; these, with the prayers, motions of the lips, and votive offerings, the consecration of shrines to the virgin, and the bending before images, he called mere devout acts." "I fear, my good sir, where there is any going of the heart with an outward adoration, (and if the body bends the heart is-sure to supplicate,) there is worship, and of course iolatry. Thus the poor negroes, and ignorant Irishmen ,? egdo they take care to worship God inwardly and the sanii$ioutwardly? Are they careful, in rendering the out- waArdtihomage to one thing, to look beyond and see the in- visible God? jHow unlikely!  We poor creatures are naturally prone to superstition, and to believe in charms, magic, and incantation. The Israelites were prohibited from making any graven image of the Deity, lest they should in their- stupid ignorance bow down to and worship it. And 'they were quite as capable of the mental reservation and the relative worship as we are now. A Romanist is told that an image of the Virgin in his house will save it from lightning, that he must run over his rosary, keep blest candles by him, and say, 'Hail Mary! full of grace.' Now, when the thunder cloud breaks over his house, if he be an ignorant man, he will look to the image instead of God; and, if desirous "of supernatural help on this or other occasions, he will count his beads, and invocate the blessed virgin; in place of seeking the divine protection in and through the office of the one Mediator and lntercessor." "I think I understood youxto say," said Emma, at length breaking silence, " that Romanists say adoration means literally to kiss the hand, and argue, as kissing the hand is a mere salutation, therefore, they may adore and yet not   KISSING THE HAND.         125 worship the virgin, and the saints, and they may kiss images without adoring them." "I did," replied Mr. Delafield. "But this is all a quib- bling about words, a dodging the question, this definition of adoration. Thus adoration is thus defined, "Dextera manu deum, contingentes ori admovebant, which, you must knows Miss Emma, says in English, touching the idol with the right hand, we then apply this hand to our mouth. Here this very act of kissing the hand, which they quote to show that, as kissing the hand is only a mark of respect, adoration means but this and no more, is said to be nothing less than an idolatrous worship." "True, most true," interrupted Mr. Holt. "Pliny's words are to the same effect in his natural history. Inter adoran- dum, dextram ad osculum referrimus. In the act of adoring we kiss the right hand. For it was usual, when the idol was in reach, for the worshipper to kiss it; as Cicero mentions that a  statue of Hercules had been so much kissed as to have worn away much of the chin and lips: and we know when the idol was too high to be reached, then the idolator kissed his hand to it." "No doubt of it," continued Mr. Delafield. "How can Romanists resort to so disingenuous an argument? Do they not know that, when idolatry is condemned in the Scriptures, not only is it condemned as adoration, (this word being em- ployed,) but condemned and described as accompanied by kissing the idol or kissing the hand? Thus in 1 Kings, (xix. 18,) it -is said there were 7000 persons in Israel who had not kissed, or worshipped Baal: and in Hosea, (xiii. 2) kissing the idolatrous calves of heathenism, is said to be a piece of idolatry to which no true Israelite would descend. Ience kissing of the hand, as the Romanists phrase their adoration of the virgin, by an ingenious gloss, is denounced as idolatry."' "And you may add," said Mr. Holt, "that it is no defence to say it means no more than the eastern prostra- tions which were made to their monarchs; for these prostra- tions bordered clbsely on adoration or worship. Hence the kings of Persia, who affected divine honours, required it of all who approached them." ' Very true," said Mr. Delafield, "and hence kissing the hand, as it is literally, or as it is literally done, or adoring the virgin, as is commonly phrased, or any-prostrations to I11*   j::;126      PILATE AND HEROD. any but God, when, by such act, a fraction of regard or reverence is implied which trenches upon the lowest grade of worship, all is inhibited in His word. Thus Job (xxxi. 26, 27) says it would have been idolatry in him, if, while beholding the sun as he shone, or the moon walking in brightness, his heart had been secretly enticed, or to use his words, C My mouth had kissed my hand,-this also were an iniquity, for I should have denied the God that is above.' Here iniquity is made to consist in either a secret entice- ment of the heart after the thing looked upon, or in the act of adoration merely, which is implied in the kissing of the hand. It would require a dexterous divider off the truth now to prove how the heart may give a portion of its affec- tions to an image, or offer to it the outward mark of adora- tion, and not be as guilty of denying the God above as Job would have been for doing the same. "And besides, see Naaman's case. After he was cured of his leprosy, (2 Kings v. 18,) he trusted he should be for- given, if, in the temple or house of Rimmon, he should bow the knee. Hence, any act of adoration, relative as it may be, which is offered to any but God, no matter what may be the mental reservation, is idolatry. Our action is at the time- a part of our worship. The bending of the knee, the devout carriage of the body, and the motion of the lips, no less than the lifting up of our hearts, at the time are parts of one act;( and if the virgin be thus prayed to, and espe- cially as she is invariably, as I Holy Mother of God/ ' The Gate of Heaven,' (Refuge of Sinners,  'Queen of An- gels,' 'Mother of Mercy,' 'Our Life, Sweetness, and Hope,'--rshe is worshipped -as God, and the worshipper is an idolator." "Precisely," interrupted Mr. Holt; " and you remember  that Bossuet, the late learned and eloquent bishop of Meaux, allowed that the ignorant may make the invocation of saints too like that':of Jesus Christ." "Hence," added Mr. Delafield, , the Council of Trent, afraid of splitting on this rock, had the tact to permit, but not to require the invocation of the virgin and the saints. But with the Council agree not the members of the Roman Church in their practice. Bonaventura, in his Psalter of Mary, renders the first psalm of David, 'Blessed is the man who loves thy name, Mary,' In the Biblia Mariae, or Scriptures of Mary, St. John's Gospel (i. 3) reads, ' All   WORSHEIP OF THE VIRGIN.       127 things were made by her.'  Romanists (for all use the rosary) pray to the virgin ten times for every prayer they address to God.: They have seven canonical hours, and five annual festivals in her honour, and term every Saturday in the year the virgin's Sabbath. By Albertus Maus the master of Thomas Aquinas, and a divine offar more learn. ing than genius, she is called ' The almighty Queen.' Yea, more--a French ecclesiastic terms her 'Diva Virgo/ the virgin goddess." "He is as much a heathen as Horace interrupted "r. Holt. "He called Venus  ' Diva potens Cypri,' the power- ful goddess of Cyprus;" and, laughing as he spoke, " these Romanists are nice special pleaders; they beat in quibbling the most subtle of my honourable profession. If their wor- ship of the virgin be not idolatry, what is it? hat think you, ladies?" "I would ask," said Emma, in a serious tone, " if it is not wrong to pray to the virgin, because I do not see how she can be of any service to us?" "True," replied Mr. Delafield, thoughtfully. "The vir- gin we have no reason to believe is in heaven, any more than. any other departed saint; for St. Paul, in Hebrews, (xi. 1,) states that they who have died..in faith have not received the- promises. In the next chapter, (verse 13,) he describes the saints departed as gathered in a vast amphitheatre, alluding to the ancient stadium by way of comparison, where they look down upon us in our race for a heavenly crown, and where they stand ready, if we come out conquerors, to welcome us with a shout. St. John, in the Apocalypse (Rev. vi. 9-11) speaks of those who died martyrs for the faith of Christ; but he says not one word of seeing them in Annie started, and asked if this could be so? Mr. Delafield assented, and remarked that the virgin like all other departed saints, was not in heaven, and had "ot yet gone to glory in the full and proper sense, but was waiting, with them the general resurrection and the life of the world to come. Hence, he'said, as the saints departel do not yet reign with Christ, have not yet attained unto   glory, though they are blessed, and rest from their labours; i 1 even admitting our prayers could reach them, which seems most unlikely, there is no more fitness or advantage in pray- i ing to the virgin and the saints, than to any good person  ! now in the land of the living. Consequently we should not  i pray to them at all." "Which means," added Mr. Holt, "that the imaginga  tion of divines and enthusiasts, in relation to the interces- sion of the blessed virgin and the saints, has worked as extravagantly as Ovid's did in his house of sleep, or Apu-  - leius, in his palace of Psyche." The following day, Mr. Holt and his brother-in-law ordered their horses, and rode off to St. Mary's. Before going, however, Mr. Delafield promised to see Montrose, and, if he could, prevail on him to drop his assumed name, and see his sister as early as practicable. Emma and Annie were thankful for the opportune conver- sation they had heard between Mr. Delafield and Mr. Holt, and carefully read over all the passages in the Scriptures, which they could find applicable to the subject. While Emma and Annie were thus laudably busied, Father Hunter called. He had feared for some time lest his hold on Mrs. Annie would be lost altogether, but knew not exactly how to regain it; and, if the baffled lion bites the bars of his cage, and then disappointed lies down with an angry growl, Father Hunter felt hardly less dissatisfac- tion at the thought that all his efforts were about to prove  fruitless in retaining Mrs. Annie captive in, as Mr. Allgrace would say, the den of the great beast. Still Mr. Hunter could not give her up without one last effort to bring her back. Hence the day after the conversation just reported, and pending the investigation just referred to, Father Hunter was seen to enter the gate leading to'Elfin Hall. As he passed in, some negroes, who were at work, made him as usual profound bows, and which the priest was either too wrapt in his meditations th notice, or felt not iwna mood to return. "Massa priest look mad," said Jack, the negro we have mentioned. "He no like missus no go to chapel now," and the negroes, all having come to the same conclusion, began to speculate on what he would be likely to do. Mrs. Annie did not know of his approach, till his hand was on the knocker of the front door; being at the time engaged in an   earnest conversation with Emma on the adoration of saints;- when his name was announced, she became suddenly very pale, and let the book she had in her hand fall to the floor. "Oh! I can't see him-z-indeed I can'" she said in a tone and manner alike desperate.         n a ttI would not unless I cared to," said Julia, interested in her behalf. , I'l tell hdim you wish to see no company to- day. "No, no--this won't do;" said Mrs. Annie, alarmed. "This will make him worse.  Oh! Emma, what shall:: do?" a Go and see him," said Emma, calmly.  "You have committed no crime. It is better to confront him in sup- porting the truth  than to hold on to his skirts, and go down "You don't' know him, Emma-no indeed." said Mrs. Annie, trembling, and endeavouring to make her toilet; persuaded that Emma's advice was good.,  ' His eye has a look, when he is angry, that withers me," conlinued Mrs. Annie, looking appealingly to Emma. Emma smiled, and said, "Well, he can only look, he can't hur you.  Go, dear Annie-hold fast your integrity, and the more the fear now, and the- harder the struggle, the more credit for keeping in the pure and perfect way.. Father tunter's heavy tones of voice were /now heard at tss r(1 al; the door, asking if Mrs. Annie was at home; and at the sound of them Mrs. Annie's heart sunk within her; her face became pale, and all the resolution, which Emma's words had infused into her, past away. , "I   can't go," said Mrs. Annie, in the act of returning to the room. "1 go with you," said Emma, speaking in a   firm but soothing tone of voice j and, as she spoke, taking Annie's hand, she led her to the drawing-room. Mrts. Annie was hardly conscious of what was passing till she saw herself in the parlour, and Father Hunter stood before her. Be seated," said the priest, coldly, andtmutterin  sorue- thing about having  but little time to spare, and gthat his business was pressing, he waved his hand authoritatively to Emma to writhdraw. Emma Was determined not to leave the room till she saw that her friend had rallied, in order that her reason might weigh well such suggestions a s the priest should offer; and   "OUV       FMAl lEl AAi Mt finVU. only feared for Annie, lest in her agitation Father Hunter might commit her to a rash and dangerous promise. She, therefore, with a forced smile, as if she had not heard Father Hunter ask her to retire, asked him if he brought / any news from the city. "I profess to be the herald of better tidings than the gossip of a petty village," replied the priest, sullenly. , Emma coloured, and asked herself whether her manner was sufficiently respectful. "If it be news to you," said the, priest, "I am to buy the,  privilege of a private conversation with Mrs. Annie, by re- ; tailing the latest on dit of the town, then I must even ac- commodate you. 'Know thin, Miss Gordon, that your     L acquaintance, Mr. Montrose, is charged with having assaulted Mr. Snarler on the public road, and robbed him of a valuable paper. Mark me, I did not say it-was true, nor that any serious steps are likely to grow out of it," fixing his piercing eyes on Emma, and exulting, aaEmma thought, in the effect he was producing. "But," continued the priest, this is a serious business if true. There is no doubt of the assault, nor any either, that a most valuable paper belonging to Mr. Snarler was taken from him without his consent; and, as I passed by Lawyer Brief's, he informed me that, if Mr. Montrose could not give security for his appearance, he would be committed to prison. This, Miss Gordon, is the only news I have heard lately, and I have reported it to you to purchase the privilege of a brief private conversation with Mrs. Annie." Emma felt mortified and vexed. "Please go," said Annie, in a low tone. "It will be worse for me if you stay." Emma saw that it was now proper to withdraw-and, indignant at the cool insolence of the priest, she rose slowly; but, recovering herself as she reached the door, said, "My friend will excuse me a few minutes-I leave her, satisfied that she is as able to withstand the seductions of the adver- sary, as I trust ever to be able to disregard his insulting remarks."  "A female edition of John Knox,"' said Father Hunter, rising, and fastening the door. "The creed and the man- ners belong to the same school. But how is it with my old friend here," approaching Mrs. Annie. "Such exhibitions, with the plausible talk, the evangelical cant, the deification   - ---.*^l .1 V 1Y 1 . J1 of reason, and the contempt of authority, I fear have done no good." "If you mean," said Mrs. Annie, faintly, "whether my friend and mtself agree in our religious opinions--I-, ) Agree with her," interrupted the priest, "you ish to "I do," said  rs. Annie, with more firmness than she would have supposed she could have commanded. Father Hunter, though this had been his own conclusion and to whiekhzl:e had j'ust now given expression, was not prepared to hear this from Mrs. Annie's lips. And it star- tled him nearly as much as if he had never thought of such a result; for it proved that He was 'further gone than he , -: i had feared, and that his further efforts could avail nothing-  towards her recovery. Father aunter's brow   contractedo more than ever, and seemed to be more than usually clouded, :i: and rising, and with a tone and  manner that denoted con- t  centrated wrath and irony said:               . "A brave business, truly! The church's at horit goes for nothing, but a Scotch parson's for every thing. And why not? Is not his training of that sort which enables him to take a text, andb by making many words over it, as a fly would over meat by blowing overit,) enables him to call out a crawling brood of ideas, while inexperienced personsgather about'the Scotchman, as chickens about a hen hussy, to pick Up the very nice, delicate and palatable food he has provided them  ! And you, Mrs."-Mrs. Annie trembled. He let his voice  fall--"you, who ought to be thankful for the uner- ring guidance of your divinely commissioned teacher, prefer the parson to the Catholic Church, and his pert daughter to your confessor." Mrs. Annie attempted to explain: remarking, very tim- dly, she could not " believe the Church of Rome to be the rly true fold; certainly not the safe one" 'e No no,' said the priest speaking quickly,  ," you are mar- ellouslykeen sighted. And pray, where is your Catholic church? the one you are looking for, I mean  9 xah. lafi in cornfully. It will be as hard to find aas wa St. B ran-dona sland by the people'of the Canaries. Yes, when the storm lows, you'll want anchorage ground, and will be swept by hat blast of vengeance, which will sweep away, as autumn- aves, heretics and schismatics.' "I hope not," replied Mrs. Annie, rather faintly. "I do "HrV (UVV1.    132        PILATE AND HEROD. not find in the Bible that I am to pin my faith to your sleeve," And the speaker gathered courage as she proceeded. "I do not see but Parson Gordon is as muck a minister of Christ as yourself; my grandfather's church is certainly quite as much a Church of Christ as yours, and I must think even more so.' aAh?' and he looked scorn concentrated and wrath ready to explode. Mrs. Annie's head drooped, and the Roman ecclesiastic, finding that looks would not awe her into sub- mission, in a minute or so changed his whole manner, and in a tone, which was meant to be very winning, he gently reproached her for her late estrangement from the Catholic Church, as he phrased it, said her case was not wholly hope- less, that Mary, the mother of mercy, would yet compassion- ate her feebleness and want of moral nerve to stand the wiles of Protestant craft, and warned her, if she valued her soul, to confess at once her backsliding; fast rigidly the next fort- night; dismiss the dangerous company at her house, and by her after life of austerity and faithful compliance to his orders as her confessor, atone for the past. Mrs. Annie trembled; a tremor passed over her whole frame; a strug-,  gle seemedf to be going on within. The Jesuit observed it, and, approaching her, laid his hand on her arm, and said, "May I not welcome my daughter back to the true fold?" Mrs. Annie started as if a serpent had touched her. That touch and voice recalled a painful past, and shuddering she replied: "No, never with you." ' Then be a, heretic, and reap its perditions." He turned haughtily away, and, waving his hand coldly, in a gait quicker than usual, Father Hunter mounted his horse, and rode off. Annie fell back in a chair, overcome by her feelings, and retired to and kept her apartment the balance of the day. During that afternoon, however, Parson Gordon arrived at Elfin Hall, and noticing Mrs. Annie's absence, was in- formed of all that had passed on the worship of the virgin, and of Father Hunter's visit; the result of which, not know- ing, they could tell him no further. "While I must condemn," said the worthy rector, " that inquisitorial spirit, which presumes to ask, How can these things be? when sublime doctrines as the Trinity, Incarna- tion, Presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and the like are   ADORATION OF THE VIRGIN.       138 announced, I think that extreme is no less faulty and dan- gerous, which takes every thing for granted; whose faith is a blind confidence in the dictum of a ghostly guide." He seemed inclined to smile, when informed of Father Canon's argument on the worship of the virgin, and said : "Rome must think we are weak indeed if she supposes by such pu- erile statements to make converts." But, the next moment thinking of the troubled state of his fair hostess, he became sad, and said to himself: {"She cannot long continue in her present position. About the time of her father's and mother's death, she fell into the meshes of Father Hunter;" and Parson Gordon thought of her previous estrangement from the Church of England, when like other Roman perverts, she was inveigled by gloz- ing fables, arguments too specious not to catch the inconsi- derate, and by a frontless impudence which would abash most people to a denial of truths clear as the sunbeam. "Poor child T" he continued, "she was unable to cope with a casuist who knew better the windings of her own heart than she did herself, who knew how to bait his doctrines that she could not but swallow them; and when he came to a stand, knew Annie's ardent affection and entireness of de- votion, and here he brought in a ,plausible talk about faith; and spoke of the reward to be given to those who surrender their judgments to their spiritual guides. {Ask no more make the Virgin your friend. Holy Mary loves with a-pe- culiai regard all holy damsels.' But now," he added, , she is undecided. How much is the heart like the rocking stone! A  child may agitate it, but a giant cannot hold it still or keep it so." A long conversation passed between Annie and Parson Gordon, and with tears she laid open to him her view andtfeelings, and he said much to calm, com- fort, and instruct her. He took up the, subject of the ado- ration of the virgin, and presented it so plainly that she "ould not doubt its idolatry. Among other things he told ler that too much stress altogether was laid on the words 'Hail! thou that art highlyfavoured," "Behold all gene  ations shall call .me blessed," because Jael in Judges, (ix. 7,) is called blessed twice, and the benediction of the virgin - ttached not to her personally;--but to her on account of er Son, after the flesh, who was to redeem us from all ini- uity. "I can  understand' he added, " whence arose much' of yoIL, It,-12   134        PILATE AND HEROD. this adoration of the virgin. In the days of chivalry and romance, she was considered the embodiment of purity and loveliness. Devotion in that age seemed to light its torch at her shrine, and love and religion were blended to- gether. She was called the patroness of females, and purity of thought, and exaltation of sentiment in reference to your sex were deemed necessary, in order that the knight errant might win the virgin's approval of his suit; and ensure success to it. Still God's word neither teaches nor authorizes any such doctrine. It gives no countenance to that sentimental re- ligion which clothes St. Mary with benignity and mercy, and her Son with majesty and terror. But it tells us, "God is love.' ' The Father himself loveth you ;' and St. Paul boasts that ewe are more than conquerors through' Christ 'that loved us.' Having shown the impropriety of worshipping the Virgin, he next exposed the Roman doctrine which re- gards her as our Mediator and Intercessor. "The Scriptures," he said, " declare, ' If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous, and He is the propitiation for our sins."  (1 St. John, ii. 1, 2.) St. Paul in Hebrews, (xii. 25,) assures us Christ is ' able to save to the uttermost, all who come unto God, by Him: seeing that He ever liveth to make interces- sion for them.' Wherefore Romanism in the place it as- signs to the Virgin, is directly in conflict with God's word, and robs the Saviour of His mediatorial functions. It elevates the mother where no creature can be, and degrades Christ, who is God, to an inferior position." Mrs. Annie then repeated Mr. Canon's argument on rather expecting benefits by asking a departed saint to pray for us, than by praying to God directly ourselves. "You were told," replied the rector, that " the virgin was not yet in heaven, and though past falling, as we are likely to do who are in the flesh, yet she as well as ourselves is yet to have her 'perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul' in the I eternal and everlasting glory,' at' the re- surrection day. But it is wrong to pray to her for other reasons. The Scriptures say, ' He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?' God here surely means what He says. When He offers to give us freely all things must we hold back, and say, 1 am afraid I am not worthy? What this reluctance to pillow our heads on His promise?   ag -    ADORATION OF THE VIRGIN..        135 Who can enable us to sleep in safety in the darkest storm? Is it faith to distrust God's word, and turning from Him who lovingly-calls us, to go to a creature even as ourselves, and ask her to intercede, and ask her to do? What faith have you in the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world," when your faith sees only the virgin? When to her you pray? When at her shrine your offerings are made? And when you invoke her to dispense the mercy of God?   Why, Annie, your Romish version even, reads, Amen, amen, I say unto you,--If ye ask the Father any thing in my name, He will give it you. Ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.' (St. Jno. xv. 16.) The words any thing,' leave nothing to be added.  Now, as ' His name will suffice to obtain for us any thing' we ask of God, why ask St. Mary to ask her Son to ask God? Rather, my child, call upon God for Christ's sake. Holy lips were not expected to tremble with the name of Mary, but with that of Jesus. Christ as the friend of sinners is-exhibited to us, and not Mary as 'the Mother of Mercy.' The Lord of glory, died for men, and not Mary, I the queen of heaven.' Hence the worship of the blessed Virgin, is beyond ex- pression an outrage on infinite goodness,-a stupid sentimen- talism, the moonstruck fancy of an age when men groped in darkness. The rector then took up one of Mrs. Annie's devotional books, and pointed to one place in it where the virgin is asked to compel God -to have mercy on sinners -- by the right of a mother to command  her Son; and where God is called in the prayer her husband. C Calm the rage of thy Heavenly Husband.' 'This,' added Parson Gordon, is an outrage on infinite goodness, and nothing short of blasphemy.'" Mrs. Annie, however, feared that sufficient might not be allowed to the blessed virgin, and, with some surprise in her manner, asked if he did not lower her -too much? The rector then told her that the Church of England called her St. Mary, and the blessed virgin; here following Scripture; but that this was not to adore her. And, surprised as Mrs. Annie was, she was yet more so when, in prosecuting this subject, she saw  on what exceedingly  slender basis, from Scripture and the fathers, stood the adoration of the virgin. For Parson Gordon took up the sacred volume, and showed to her that the blessed virgin is mentioned by three of the evangelists simply as the 1' Virgin Mary;" and by the fourth, St. John, as "the mother of the Lord:" while neither St.   Paul, many as are his writings, nor St. James, St. Peter, St. Jude, nor St. John, though she lived with the: last, men- tion her' at all in their epistles. The inference was clear i that, if she was to be adored, and to fill the important post of our intercessor, the Scriptures of the New Testament would not have been thus silent. He next ran over the occasions on which she is mentioned or alluded to as " the Virgin Mary," and " the mother of the Lord." "Simeon," said he, "foretold to her in the temple the destiny of the child Jesus, and hefbwn sufferings on account of His cruel death; but did not make the remotest allusion to her exaltation as queen of heaven, which Romanists fable about her. Our Lord, a yduth of twelve years, in company with his mother and Joseph, visited Jerusalem. His parents missed Him, and, on finding Him, his mother asked, 'Son, why hast Thou thus dealt with us? Behold thy father and I have sought Thee sorrowing.' His reply, Ho -is it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?' so far from exalting her as an object to be adored, seems rather to reprove her for tot knowing His divine mission. At the marriage in Cana of / Galilee, 'the mother of Jesus saith unto Him, they have no wine.' He answered, L Woman what have I to do with thee? Mine hour, is not yet come.' It is not supposable  s that the blessed virgin could have been what Romanists   : represent, and that our Lord would have spoken in this manner to her. Our Saviour is told that His 4 mother and brethren stand without desiring to speak with Him. And He answered and said, Who is my mother and who are my brethren? For whosoever' hall do the will of my Father, which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.' Here, instead of exalting his mother above all the daughters of Eve, and teaching us that she is worthy to sit down on the right hand of her Son in. heaven, 'the queen of heaven, and of the angels,' he gives her no higher rank than -to whosoever shall do His Father's will; or as St Luke renders the same occurrence, (viii. 21,) him 'who shall hear the word of God and do it.' "A certain woman, with feelings akin to those of a Roman devotee, cried out that blessed was she who had borne .and nursed our Lord; and her exclamation seemed to be only the fulfilment of the prophecy, that all generations should call her blessed, and blessed we must allow, blessed she was   * .v^ V; 1nr VIRKGIN.  137 for being the instrument of so much good to a condemned world; still to guard against any excess of feeling or rever- ence towards her, and looking very much as if the idolatry of the virgin was here specially meant to be guarded against our Lord replied: {Yea, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.' "We come now to the scene on the cross. And with aught but theological dogmatism, with a spirit subdued before such a scene, thankful to my God that one so unworthy as myself can say for me, as a part of His holy family, He was con- tented to be betrayed, and given up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon the cross,' I stand below that cross. The agony of death is upon Him, yet He masters the pain and the torment, and asks the beloved disciple to take charge of His mother. But He says no more, not a word of her exaltation, or as an object of worship. And the evangelist simply adds, I From that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.' There remains but one instance to be cited. In Acts, (i. 13,) we are told that the disciples 'continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary, the mother of' Jesus, and with His brethren.' By this time something should have appeared of the virgin's exaltation, in ainore honourable mention; but the word of God is silent; it neither-speaks out nor whispers, it neither foreshadows nor leaves us to conjecture that worship of the mother of the Lord, which has sup planted the worship of God in the minds and hearts of millions." When Mrs. Annie retired that evening, with too much on her thoughts to find an expression in words, she sat a long ime pondering this conversation. She could not exactly say hat every doubt had been  removed, and that the pure light :f truth, in which there is no darkness at all, shone in her ath. But she had gained much. She had rested till ecently on dogmatic assertion, or'the dictum of her spiritual onfessor, perhaps on the disingenuous declarations of in- erested persons, perhaps the ignorant misstatement of others s much in-dareness as herself. For the sure and unerring ord of prophecy, God's everlasting Gospel, had not been aclasped to her, and its voice made know n. On this she )ulid plant herself. The veil had been withdrawn, and she rm, not the mother of the Lord sitting on the right hand the MAlajesty on high, but she was favoured with the vision   138       PILATE AND HEROD.. of the martyred Stephen; she saw Jesus standing on the right'hand of God, and all the angels with him. And, over- come with a, sense of the goodness of God in enabling her to look into His priceless word, she wept in very thankful- ness. As she knelt to say her prayers for the night, she was about to invoke, from the force of habit, the help of the virgin; but suddenly checked herself: "I am either an idolator or true worshipper. If an -idolator, praying to my idol is-not the way to be rid of my idolatry. Now Catholic and Protestant both believe in Jesus Christ, and his words are, ' If Be ask the Father any thing in my name he will give it youw' Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be filll.'/ ' And, so persuaded, she fer- vently besought God to enlighten her mind more and more, and, guiding her into all truth, to keep her in the pure and perfect way. The next day Parson Gordon sought and availed himself of an occasion to expose the singular argument Mr. Canon attempted to make out, from the fathers, in favour of the worship of the virgin. He told her that the passages Mr. Canon quoted, he had often seen quoted before, but. never could find in the writings of the fathers, and this base forgery of testimony he severely commented on, as the working of Romanism and not Christianity. He then said, that what the fathers say of the blessed virgin goes to prove that they knew nothing of worship being due to her, and he instanced briefly St. ChrysostomrSt. Augustine, and Ephrem Cyrus. Thus, St. Chrysostom, among- many passages, said, as re- marked Parson Gordon, commenting on the words, "Who is my mother, etc.? It profited her nothing to be his mother, unless that qualification were added. There is only one nobility of birth, the doing of the will of God." St. Augustine, in his numerous and voluminous writings, speaks of the virgin as the Virgin Mary, the Holy Mary, the mother of our Lord, but never as the mother of God, and, comment- ipg on the passage I quoted from St. Chrysostom, "And *ho is my mother?'"etc., he answers, " the whole church is his mother, because she truly bears, by the grace of God, his members, that is, his faithful ones. So, likewise, every pious soul is his mother, doing the will of his Father." Ephrem Cyrus is so far from advocating the adoration of the virgin, that, in a passage in his writings, where he advises us in difficulty to fly unto God in our prayers, he says, "We   ADORATION   OF THE VIRGIN.     139 have the angels, archangels, powers, glorious dominions, cherubim and seraphim, God the sovereign of all.  We have the prophets, apostles, holy gospels, martyrs, all the saints, confessors, holy fathers, patriarchs, shepherds, and priests," but does not say we have the virgin. The conclusion is singularly unfortunate for Mr. Canon, which we must come to from his own authorities. "The others," said Julia, who had taken an interest in the question, "I suppose, are no more in his favour?" Parson Gordon at first smiled, but remarked he felt sad at the same time. He smiled to think that Father Canon was as simple in quoting authorities as he seemed to think his hearers would be in receiving them. "Thus there is no such passage as quoted in Ildephonsus and John Damascenus. The Collyridian heresy, so called from Collyridia, a little cake whichthis sect offered to the virgin, makes no more in favour of the worship of the virgin. For the church Catholic denounced their' veneration of the virgin as heresy. And St. Epiphanius, writing on heresies, and exposing this Collyridian sect, says, ' You say nay, but : the body of Mary is holy. -Yes, but not a deity.  Nay, you say again, the virgin is a virgin, and honoured. Yes, but not given for us to worship.' Elsewhere, this father says, our Lord called the virgin woman, in order that no one, by admiring the holy virgin in excess, might fall into this folly of heresy." "Surely,"' interrupted Annie, " you believe the blessed virgin to be superior to all other women and mortals?" "Don't understand me to deny the personal excellence of the mother of our Lord. Her devout temper, her sweet, calm, and humble spirit, I trust to be the last to deny. That noble hymn of hers in St. Luke, the Magnificat, is enough to show the exaltation of her devotional feelings. No, never may I underrate one who stood in a relation so near to the Redeemer as his mother. I cannot forget Dr. Barrow's fearful words: I Let that mouth be cursed which will not call her blessed! Let the ame of him be branded with the everlasting reproach of folly, who will not prefer her in dig- nity before any queen or empress.'  Parson Gordon then spoke of Father Canon's fable of the assumption of the blessed virgin, a fiction, which the church of Rome com- memorates every 15th of August, Assumption Day. "Mary, the virgin," say Romanists, in their books of devotion, {' is   "O       PILATE AND HEROD. taken up into heaven, to the ethereal chamber in which the King of kings sits on his starry throne." "' The legend of St. Mary's assumption into heaven," said the rector, "is as unsupported as the stories of the Golden Legend, and about as incredible as the accounts we read of St. GeOrge and the dragon. It first occurs in the works of John Damascenus, a Jerusalem monk, who lived about the middle of the 8th century. Damascenus relates it, not as a tradition he found floating in the holy city, nor on the faith of a writing then extant which ewe from a reliable source, but he says a certain book, the Enthymiac history, written a century and a half before his day, merely alludes to such a story. But how?  As a tradition then current? No. As a fact stated by a credible witness, whose statement the writer of the Enthymiac history had seen? No. The writer of the Enthymiac history says he heard that somebody (who, he does not say,) told him that somebody (also un- known,) had reported that once upon a time the bishop of Jerusalem, ,who lived a hundred years before the writer of the Enthymiac history, mentioned to the Emperor Marcian that there was an ancient' tradition of a marvellous event. that happened four hundred years before his day. It was a very faint tradition, or its echoes would have reached the ears of the emperor without the medium of said Jerusalem bishop. It seems to have been known to no one but this bishop, for all the writers of that, and the ages immediately ensuing, knew nothing of it. And said bishop, so reporting it, gives no better authority than an ancient tradition, and, pray, what marvels, what nonsense, what absurdity comes not down to] us as well supported? And even were the chain of historical evidence regularly brought down in the writings of John Damascenus, it would prove nothing, for this legend is found in one of his homilies called, On the Sleep of the Virgin,' and said homily turns out to be not genuine. Somebody inserted this homily many years after the death of John Damascenus, in his writings, the homily and its wondrous legend being alike a miserable imposition.* If religion is to be a tissue of fables, where are we to stop? what are we to reject? The Jewish Rabbins, borrowing from *See an excellent work, "What is Romanism?" published by the London Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1846, in which the invocation of saints and angels, and the worship of the Blessed Virgin are shown to be unscriptural, uncatholic and idolatrous.   ADORATION OF THE VIRGIN.      141 imagination, explain the 10th verse of the 45th Psalm, ' Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women,' that, when Mes- sias cometh,.every king of the world will send Him one of his daughters to wait upon Him. But it is not more absurd than the Roman interpretation of the closing part o the same verse. 'Upon Thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir,' to mean the virgin's exaltation to be queen of heaven and of the angels. The Rabbin's fable that, at Messiah's great feast, will be drank a cup of wine that grew in the garden of Eden, and which from Adam's time was kept in his cellar! You laugh, ladies, and well you may; but the story of the assumption, as Mr. Canon related it to you, is as ridiculous." It was not often, certainly not usual with him, that Parson Gordon, even after the employment of the more proper weapons of argument and dissuasion, resorted to ridicule; but this was an occasion, he thought, which especially called for it. Mrs. Annie thanked him for the trouble he had taken, and the good man trusted, as nothing is a surer antidote to the poison of fraud than its detection, " that his exposure of the disingenuousness of Romanism would, by God's blessing, free his fair friend eventually of its influence." At another time, that day, he connected his foregoing remarks with the Romish legendary lore of the saints, told her that their sainthood stood on the most flimsy ground, that it might do for children to believe that St. Margaret by the sign of the cross overcame the dragon, and the like fables, but it would not do for any who had passed nonage, to give in to such im- probabilities. And, after remarking on the state of the dead who had died in the Lord, where they rest by the still wa- ters, and with the green pastures around and about them; a place of quietude, holy calm, and foretaste of bliss to be theirs, more fully and perfectly after the resurrection-morn, he spoke of the loss the soul must sustain in seeking an im- possible favour at their hands, too distant to hear them, and by not addressing itself to an ever-present God, Who is not far, says the Apostle, from every one of us, and Who, having promised to grant our least request made in Christ's name, will not fail His engagement. "Draw nigh unto Him, my child," he added feelingly, " and He will draw nigh unto you. Cast all your care upon Him, for He careth for you; and be assured, even could a departed saint know   "2       PILATE AND HEROD. of your asking his prayers, you need no such to usher you into the presence chamber of a prayer hearing, and prayer answering God. He is by you, within hearing, and you have but to call on Him, and He will answer; for His promise is, ' Ask and ye shall receive.' The door of mercy you need not go to the spirit world to find, by prayers to de- parted saints; for it is in your closet, and in the sanctuary, and He has said,' To him that knocketh it shall be opened.'"   CHAPTER XXIV. AN LAVqIRY9, A QUANDARY AND A MSTAKE. *' The heart is like the sky a part of heaven, But changes night and day too, like the sky, Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven, And darkness and destruction as on high; .      But when it hath been scorched, and pierced, and riven, l Its storms expire in water drops." o.1          BIBYRON'. THE same day, in which passed what we havy just related, Parson Gordon said to Emma in private: "My daughter, there'is a certain matter in which a parent must take a lively interest, and yet which he cannot allude to, without caution and great delicacy." Emma looked much surprised, and said, "You know, dear father, I have no concealments. from you."  And, as she spoke, she threw her arms about her father, and looked up in his face so calmly and ingenuously, that Parson Gordon, overcome by it, hastened to say, " Has my daughter ever allowed herself to think of Mr. Mbntrose otherwise than as an acquaintance?" Emma was about to answer flatly, "No, certainly not;" when, too honest to speak less than the truth, she hesitated. She was not sensible that her affections were committed to ]Montrose, and she had not thought of him otherwise than as an agreeable aquaintance. But still she had found him very agreeable, and classed him higher than any youth of her acquaintance; she therefore shaped her answer accordingly. "I have not had reason to think of Mr. Montrose except as an acquaintance." "I have no more to say, my daughter.  We'll retire."- Now to retire under such circumstances, with her father's words on her mind, calling up various conjectures, was more than Emma was willing to do, without an effort, at least, to prevent it. "Father, speak plainly. Why this question? Surely no (143)   "4  /     PILATE AND HEROD. onre has tld you, nor can you have seen any thing, show- ing that I have other feelings for Mr. Montrose." "No one, my child," replied her father, calmly. "Did you suspect any thing besides?" and the question cost Emma an effort. "I should be sorry-to believe so." "I have seen no reason to suspect my daughter in aught," looking affectionately at her. "I have given you none." C No--but have you given no one else?" "It would mortify me to think I had," said Emma. "Who could have brought to you an injurious report of i I have not even intimated reports of such a kind," he  replied. "I should not be likely to hear them. But, in A':" supposing that such feelings may have existed, I,thought it possible my daughter might do what her mother did before her-give away her affections before either she or her father knew it." Emma felt uncomfortable. Why she could not say pre- cisely. There was something stirring. What was it? Her father's words had weight. The thought they suggested was new to her. "But still," she soliloquized, ' admit (which is not the case,) I may have been so silly and weak,- why should my father's curiosity or concern be aroused till something more definite occurs than either he, I, or any one else knows." And Emma was anxious that her father should speak out unreservedly whatever was uppermost. Innocence fears no exposure, and never dodges investigation. She, therefore, with one of the sweetest 'miles, and which the father never could withstand, said: :1 - "Tell me, please, the meaning of all this? You are not wont'to be so mysterious."         " ' I meant not to intrude, my dear child," speaking solemnly, and with a look that was deep and yet not prying, serious and yet not stern, " on the sacredness of feelings, which, perhaps, the owner herself had best not know, till the shrine which hides them can be unlocked with safety. And yet, thinking it possible that your affections might be committed to Mr. Montrose, I judged it might be well to know the fact before the matter had proceeded any further. Still, as this is a question which your own heart may never have asked itself, it might not be easy for you to resolve it.   A QUANDARY.         r45 And, as I know all I can or ought to know about the matc we'll dismiss it.". At the same time he imprinted a kisSn his daughter's brow, and moved towards the door. Emma's curiosity was aroused, and she was determined not to be foiledj in this way; and, above all, not to be left in a quandary. This singularity and suddenness were cal- culated to make her anxious to know her father's object in proposing such questions at such a time. So, throwing her arms tightly around him, she said, playfully, but firmly: "Father, you don't escape me in this way. Why do you ask me these questions?  I must know all ;" emphasising must, and looking very resolute, and a little archly at her father. "Not now, if at all," he said, gently endeavouring to disengage her arms, and kissing her again. "No, no," replied Emma, tightening her hold upon him, "I have, by inheritance, a little of your strength, and I nlust, I must know." Parson Gordon seated himself in a  chair, and talking very slowly, as if measuring his words, said: , Yesterday, a gentleman of your acquaintance, Mr. Montrose, and I. had a conversation about you-and what is more, I have re- ceived a very earnest. letter from-his father, Mr. Delafield, on the subject." Mr. Montrose," said Emma, starting, and then men- tioned the report which Father Hunter had brought. Mr. Gordon explained that the affair between him and Snarler was more ludicrous than serious; and then gave the state- ment of it which he had obtained from Mr. Montrose him- self; adding, that Brief, Mr. Hunter's informant, was not kindly disposed to Montrose. "But," said Emma, "how could my    name form a part of your conversation," Parson Gordon smiled, and said, "You have never heard perhaps, that fathers are consulted in the marriage of their daughters? nor that it is possible that two young people can form ; ai-i:attachment to each other?" Emma blushed. "Mr. Montrose, as I   must still call him ," continued Parson Gordon, "avowed to me his warm regard and high esteem for you, and hoped I would not object to his attempt- ing to win your affections and hand. I saw no reason to refuse this request," continued her father, "especially as it V rOe.  II.-13   "6       PILATE AND HEROD.  s made in a manner alike courteous and considerate; and assured him I knew too little of him to say more than that I would not object to his endeavouring to win your consent, unless circumstances might hereafter call for my interfer- ence. But, my daughter, I cannot tell you with what anx- iety I broached this subject. Let it excuse my indirectness and awkwardness. Your union to any one, even to one ^  superior to Mr. Montrose, is an event I could not contem- plate or think of without the liveliest anxiety. I know what a lottery is marriage. Mine was a blessed one"-he spoke with difficulty-"my cup ran over-your sainted mother would have made any one happy who was less than a demon, and I am thankful, brief as my happiness was. But not so with a very large portion of those who marry. Want of sense, affection, forbearance, sympathy, congeniality, and fitness for each other, too much on one side, and no effort on the other to make the reality not too unlike the ideal, render marriage the most solemn and uncertain act we can do. Lachesis spins out for the married pair a yarn twisted with entanglements, coloured by passion, soiled by unfaithfulness, and wet, and at times' dripping with bitter tears. For what is wealth to the parties? No insurance against any of the evils to which the flesh is heir; since extravagance will waste it, and she, who glittered at her bridal in jewels, may cower in rags and want in a wretched shieling; or vice will turn wealth into means of corruption, and the rich husband will sink into the disgusting bloated sot. What avail talents? They are the guaranty of an honourable, at least not dishonoured connexion: provided, however, that integrity sits at the helm, and discretion takes command; but no amount of talents, not the wit of Bacon, nor the genius of Shakspeare, will avail by themselves. What is good family in the husband? Much, I allow, in appearance, and pleasant from the associations connected with a noble name; and good family appears to be a pledge that the blood, which up to that moment has been unstained, may, but none that it will, continue spotless. Some of the best blood of dear Scotland is stained by the degeneracy of a nobly descended offspring. Virtue is the only nobility whose escutcheon is ever bright. I want for the husband of my daughter Christian principles, a life well spoken of, those companionable qualities, (which many of the world's great men wanted, as Milton and Dryden,) that would make   A QUANDARY.         147 him, not my daughter's superior, but her companion; suiJ as God made Adam to Eve; her lord and the head of her household, entitled to her love, honour, and obedience, and happy to requite her services by loving, honouring, and cherishing her. For, when my child leaves her father for another, will she find a love as deep, devoted, and respectful? How may I know that Mr. Montrose, or any other person, will be all this?"And the father seemed overcome by the picture his fancy had painted. Emma, with all her apparent sang-froid calmness, the result of principle, not temperament, became fidgetty and uncomfortable. At first she smiled, then she felt rather inclined to enter a protestation that she meditated nothing of the kind, and, as her father closed, his deep sensibility touched her also, and with an effort to calm down her feelings, she remarked that her father was giving himself much unnecessary concern. "True, my daughter, it may, and I trust will be so." "Then," said Emma, seriously, and a little troubled at the thought, "so I must receive Mr. Montrose hereafter as an acknowledged suitor? My manner must now be unequivo- cally that of one who does, or who does not regard him. I must either cut him, as Miss Evelin would say, or show him that he is ever and truly welcome." "Not necessarily, unless you dislike his attentions, now aware what they mean. And this I know your candour too well not to know you will let him see. But if you have no aversion, do not act precipitately. His communication was not intended to go beyond myself, and he can not know and need not infer that it has. It was proper in him to ask my consent, and a father's concern unsealed mylips to you. But I know it is in safe-keeping. My daughter has too much judgment to act indiscreetly. Should her intercourse extend any further, the time given you for consideration will aid you the better to ascertain your own feelings on the subject, certainly better than if suddenly under excitement, whose cause may be ephemeral and of little worth, you should be called on to decide." In this conversation, whose length was unavoidable, pa- rental sagacity sought to ward off from the offspring the evils attendant on a misplaced connexion, and, though few fathers might act as did the good father here, who will say he erred? that under the circumstances, the like and all proper pre- cautions ought not to be tried? Fortunately in this case the   PILATE AND HEROD.  Advice given, and precautions, which were taken, were not likely to be thrown away. For Emma regarded marriage otherwise than the heedless daughters of folly consider it, who rush into it with the eagerness they would into a dance, and think of it as little more than a frolic; or a voyage d'amour between two loving hearts in a Cleopatra's barge down the Cydnus; and her father's words were never treated by her as some children are wont to regard the counsels of parents, but she valued them as "apples of gold in pictures of silver." She knew- that she could not say of him that he did, "As some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny path to heaven; Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own road." And so appreciating her father's advice, what could have descended more prophetically, than descended the blessings of this affectionate father on his duteous daughter's head! Too often, however, love seems to be not only a blind god- dess, who acts without judgment, but a wilful wight, who, with the strength of Samson, breaks as withes the bands with which we seek to fetter him; and who, like mischievous Puck, takes especial pleasure in deranging all our plans. And so it seemed. To prove which, and particularly to take up the thread of our narrative, we must go back a few days. Our readers will remember that Shepard and Montrose came very seasonably to Elfin Hall the night when Emma and her friends feared they were assaulted either by law- less brigands, or demons of the lower regions. We could not then suspend the narrative of the matters, which we have given, to tell what passed in the tete-a-tetes, then had between Mrs. Annie and Shepard, and between Emma and Montrose. We hope they will accept our apology for the omission. Of this occasion, Shepard and Montrose availed themselves to have all the private conversation they could with -Emma and Mrs. Annie, and when they left Elfin Hall, as they did on the day following that on which Father Canon laid the ghost, Montrose said to himself, "In quiet and un- obtrusive moral loveliness, in the blending of sterling sense with the sea of feeling, which needs only to be stirred to show its depth, in manners that command and yet. win, and   I,   MONTROSE IN TROUBLE.      149 in grace, ease, dignity and love; Emma certainly has no' equal," and so completely was he wrapt up in admiration of her charms and worth, that her presence and words haunted him as a spell. Hence his remark to Shepard, when he and his friend had the adventure on the road with Snarler. So strongly and favourably impressed was Montrose with Emma, that afterwards, meeting Parson Gordon, he communicated to him his great regard for, and wish to address his daugh- ter. Matters were in this train, when, on account of the as- sault upon Snarler, and his fiscal embarrassments, he was in some trouble. Montrose was nearly a stranger in St. Mary's, being known to but few, and to them slightly. He had squan- dered with youthful prodigality the funds he brought over with him, and greatly to his reluctance felt constrained to accept a loan from his strange friend, whom he did not then know to be his father. This sum he had lost in cards, and he had hardly a penny in his purse, when the proposition was made to him by Attorney Brief, in behalf of Father Hunter, to buy a part of the right of Charles Delafield to the pro- perty which Snarler held; the priest hoping thereby to force Snarler to return him the release of his right on St. Mary's grave-yard. This proposition, our readers cannot have for- gotten, Montrose indignantly rejected; when Mr. Delafield accosting him endeavoured to prevail on him to accept a second loan; which Montrose, needy as he was, had the moral courage to refuse. Mr. Delafield still kept from him his true name; unable yet to command himself during the excitement which such a disclosure would lead to; prefer- ring to let him know by letter. Hence Mr. Delafield, hav- ing determined to bring matters to a close, as we stated, made himself known to Mr. Holt, and with him called at Elfin Hall, and there revealed himself to his daughter. Montrose, however, was about this time in a state of mind not to be envied. He was without funds, and, as he believed, nearly without friends, in the province. The time for which he was bound to secresy by his wager with his friend at College, Johnson, had passed; but the youth's pride now revolted at announcing his name under the circumstances which then existed. He sat in his chamber pondering his affairs, and revolving over and over again what step it be- came him to pursue. "I am a fool," said he pacing up and down his room, 'a 13*   150       PILATE AND HEROD. fool of such a stamp, that his folly admits of no apology Here I might have been all that I could have wished, but must, like an ass, make a wager with Johnson, who gave me credit for not being such a ninny as to keep it; and now, after a purgatory of a few months, when I am at liberty to let people know my true and proper name, I have involved myself in embarrassments that will take all the receipts of this year, in advance, from my property in England to meet. My strange friend will have to be paid. -Mine honest publi- can has a long bill against me, the amount of which I am almost afraid to look at. My losses at cards have not all been paid; I want funds also to marry Emma, should- that angel consent to have me, and I may be prosecuted for this affair of Snarler's, and shall want means to defend myself at law, in case of a suit. What is to be done?" He thought awhile, and then said, "True courage consists not in dodg- ing, but in meeting difficulties; in looking at them, as we used to say at school, 'oculo irretorto,' with firm and un- daunted eye. First then what do I owe?" He sat down, and making a memorandum, began to cast up different sums, and having made out the amount, laid 'the paper on the table, and said, "Well, well, I can look at it. It is not a basilisk to strike me dead. This poor paper is very harm- less. But no, no, this can't be.- I don't owe this much," and he counted it over again. "I make the amount more," he continued. "Can this be? I'll count again. How is this?" he proceeded. "My head wanders. Four and six and eight and nine make twenty-eight, and yet here I have put down twenty-seven-one hundred pounds more than I thought." :He looked over the list again, and the paper and figures seemed to dance before him. "Provoking, I can't count up as well as an Eton boy, who has not yet turned over a Latin accidence-I don't care what the amount is-- my brain aches-I never could sum up with any satisfaction to myself, and now I can't do a simple sum of addition," and vexed, .he threw the paper from him. "Away with 'thought!" he continued. "I want to do something. There's no virtue in remorse, none in grieving over debts incurred. I was made for action-onward is my motto, and onward it shall be ;" and he paced rapidly up and down the chamber. "Horse Selil does not loiter- in his course, tc stop and graze upon the meadows by the way. The stag that is doomed to be shot will stop and pick here and there   MONTROSE AND SHEPARD.       151 I take no pleasure in luxuriating over my feelings. 1 want action-I must do something." And with hat on his head he was dashing out of his room, and as he passed into the passage, he met Shepard; who, struck by his wild air planted himself midway the passage, and, in a tone of voice half serious, and half comic, asked, "Running from the constable, eh? Don't hurry so fast. If you must, I'll arrest you and claim the reward." "Let me go," said Montrose, "I mean to ride," taking hold of Shepard's hand. "Not till I have delivered you into the custody of Coun- sellor Brief," replied Shepard, with mock gravity, but, struck with the expression on the face of Montrose, and his air of apparent wildness, Shepard changed his tone, and said, "Come, come, go below, we'll play at primeco. Honest Jack Falstaff," laughing as he spoke, "you told Father Canon, said he had not prospered since he had forsworn it, and that is the reason why you look as if old Snarler, Brief the sheriff,.and a hundred bailiffs were at your heels. Bailiff, as Mr. Holt would say," lowering his tone to an imitation of this worthy gentleman's, "from the Latin bajulus, a guardian of youth, ergo, friend Montrose, a bailiff is a very proper person to have the charge of you." "No, said Montrose, returning to the room, and leading Shepard after him, "I have taken my fill of cards, and, before I'd throw away money,' and time, and heart thus, I'd be a sizer at college." "First rate," said Shepard; "a very ingenious thought this. Othello's vocation was gone when he had killed Des- demona, but master Montrose's is never. He could even take up the vocation of a poor sizer boy at college--put on the black gown of coarse stuff such as wore the old sizer Tobias Nicoll at Cambridge, and, but for the want of sleeves, very like that worn by the noted saint, Mr. Allgrace, and so equipped, instead of capering 'Nimbly in a lady's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute,' being 'rudely stamped,' and wanting ' love's majesty,' why he prefers, in attire most demure, and with an untasseled black cap thrown shantily on his head, to carry up dishes from the kitchen to the fellows' hall, and there, as humble   152       PILATE AND HEROD. servitor, wait till the reverend doctors have dined. I com- mend your choice." "I want money," said Montrose moodily, "and I am in no humour, Shepard, for this." "But you were all primed to go off on a ride," said Shepard. "Now, friend, as horse Selim, with all his fleet- ness, cannot outride the law of England, suppose you try the old bishop of Chester's plan-find a conveyance which will take you to some world other than this." "What!" said Moitrose, " try a coward's refuge against the troubles of this world, suicide, when with due resolution and a few hearty efforts, a man, like a good swimmer, can breast the billows and reach the shore. What mean you, Shepard?" "No harm, of course," replied Shepard, "but I simply designed to call your attention in your present emergency, and most critical posture, to the suggestions of the late bishop Wilkins of Exeter. According to him, you have but to get a conveyance that will carry you in the air as swift as an eagle. Being so provided, give yourself no concern for food, as you can feed on the music of the spheres, and, per- haps, like old Demiantus can live for several days on the mere odour of hot bread. And be not uneasy because, on your way to the moon, there are no inns or taverns to sleep or lodge in, nor even air castles, where a genius like yours, that brooks not the harness of tightened circumstances, and crippling poverty, may strut up and down, and survey his person complacently, for what bed is softer than the air itself? Why, the down of the eider goose, which that blunderer Brief, himself a goose, spoke of, calling duck goose, is not so soft. See, here are some lines which may help you to begin the' enterprise with a good resolution: 'Ah! no more to me is given Emma's smile to cheer my heart, But, like angel cast from heaven, I from peace must ever part. But when she stands at evening tide, And gazes on the moon's pale ray, Oh! may she think it was my pride, To bask in the sunlight of her day!' Ah! hem! There's rhyme for you, if not reason ;-let's see, if I cannot turn off more from my poetical or rhyming machine. q , i   jNluulf uMt; ANU SHEPARD.     100 'Ah! farewell! the word is spoken Like thunderbolt my heart it crushed, The chords upon my lute are broken, To music's power for aye 'tis hushed. Farewell! oh most cruel sentence, Must I take so long a flight, Cannot I move her to repentance, And save at once her faithful knight?' No! it seems you must go, friend Montrose, in spite of bad rhyme and most prosaic poetry, the best I can do for you." And thus Shepard continued to run on, determined by his extravagance to change the current of his friend's medi- tations, and perhaps too in obedience to a restless fever within which seemed to force him at times to do mentally what Montrose was anxious to do physically, mount his horse Selim, and ride off, as if the tempest of hyperbole drove him before it. Montrose listened, and appreciating the man and his motives, bore all more patiently than one of his impetuosity would have taken from almost any other; but he seemed not disposed to talk; and Shepard, changing the subject, rather more seriously, but still with a sprink- ling of irony in his manner, said: "Perhaps you are chiefly concerned about a memorable assault and battery, which youdid then and there commit on the person of one Snarler against the peace and dignity. of the state? Now be pleased to bear in mind that I am not knowing at all to said transaction, being as innocent of it as the lamb was of muddying the branch out of which the wolf was drinking. Said Snarler and yourself I never saw together on said road. Said portmanteau I never laid hands upon; and said will came into my possession, because I took it from you, knowing it to be stolen goods, in order to restore it to its rightful owner, to whom I have restored it, the most honourable court." "I'll bear these particulars in mind," said Montrose. "What next?" "This being the case," continued Shepard, " in compas- sion to your desperate case, I'll undertake your defence; and, as like all desperate characters, your purse is about as low as your reputation, I will take, as my fee, horse Selim. Is that our understanding?" "Agreed," said Montrose, smiling. "He is not mortgaged to mine host below?" asked Shep- ard, with well counterfeited concern. b .   154       PILATE AND HEROD. "No," said Montrose. "This being so," said Shepard, "I shall first contend that there was no battery in the case; unless your Selim could sustain an action against Snarler for striking him. It is, therefore, not an assault and battery. Is it an assault? Now an assault is merely an assultus, or insultus,-an insult, an attempt to hurt the person of another, or the offering of injury to the person of this other, or an unlawful setting on the person of another. But no attempt war made to hurt Snarler's person, nor any injury offered' .o it. The attempt was only to ge hold of a will in Snarler's portman- teau; and as to the ofering of injury to him, you merely acted as a bailiff would laid your hand upon him, and said, 'A word with you, si.' And, as to the unlawful setting on, your riding fast towards him cannot be so construed, because then, when two persons are meeting on a public highway, they must bring their horses to a dead march gait, and keep it till they have passed each other. Ergo demon- strandum est. You are acquitted, sir, and horse Selim is mine." At this moment a servant entered, bringing two letters to Montrose, one from Mr. Delafield, and the other from Julia. The first was as follows: "My dear son,  "Know that the stranger, who has intruded himself occasionally upon ydu, is no other than your father." Montrose breathed hard. "Perhaps a pardonable weak- ness prevented his communicating this fact to you in person. Mr. Holt will see you shortly, and communicate freely with you on this subject. I have been suddenly summoned to Calvert on urgent business. We shall meet in Annapolis during the session of the Assembly close at hand. Your uncle has funds for you. "Remember that want follows on the heels of prodigality, and vice and wretchedness bring up the rear. "God bless you. "Ever your affectionate father, "DELAFIELD." The eyes of Montrose filled with tears, and, choking with emotion, he sat down on the bed, unable to speaks, Shepard, discoverintthat something had happened, and, HiV1   JULIA'S LETTER.        155 suspecting it to be of an unpleasant character,-,the death of a relative,-quietly left the room lest he might intrude on the sacredness of his friend's grief. Montrose was not able for some time to command him- self. When he did, he read the following letter from Julia: "Dear Charlie, "You have seen dear father. How like a resur- rection from the dead! I cannot realize it. I am all impatience to see you. You are a wicked youth to play so with my feelings. How could you keep us in the dark? I have not yet finished my old argument on hunting. One point I mean to insist on, to wit, that no heart but a hunter's could have been so cruel as to trifle thus with a sis- ter. I suspected you all the time, and would have foiled all your plan, and pulled off the 'Montrose-garb, and shown the soubriquet to have been too flimsy a veil to hide from awoman's penetration, if my pride had not stept in, and said, I can hold out, Mr. Charlie, as long as you can. We are to be at the Glebe this day. Meet us there. On this condition only will I allow Emma to look at you. "Your own sister, "JULIA." "Where is Shepard?" said Montrose, rising, and for the first time sensible of his absence. He went to his friend's room, and then down stairs, and anxious to see him, and not finding him in the tavern, left a letter there for him; saying he was going to the Glebe, and hoped to meet Shepard at Parson Gordon's that afternoon. That very day then, as Julia apprised him; and not long after, Montrose, gun in hand, mounted on, Selim, was riding towards the Glebe, dis- tant about thirteen miles, and riding slowly, hoping Shepard would overtake him. Parson Gordon, with Emma, Julia, and Adaratha, left Elfin Hall for the Glebe. As they passed the north-eastern limits of the town of St. Mary's, (Mon- trose and themselves, alike unconscious of the neighbour- hood of each other,) the. Parson and Julia lingered a few minutes at the castle gate to exchange civilities with Colonel Smithson; while Emma and Adaratha rode on about half a mile in advance. As the two last drew near St. Mary's spring, which to this day is noted for the coolness of its   156       PILATE AND HEROD. water, they quickened their pace, meaning there to hqlt, till Parson Gordon and Julia should come up. But one glance at the grove of trees which was about the spring, told Emma that two horses were tied there: She stopt her horse, ask- ing Adaratha to do the same; not knowing how far it would be prudent in them to venture further in their ignorance as to whom the horses belonged, and of the company they might there find themselves in. But as she halted, Emma heard a noise to the right. She and Adaratha looked in that direction, and their amazement may be judged when they saw Miss Evelin leaning on the arm of Montrose, with her head reclining on his shoulder, walking slowly, and in most lover-likem anner. "A providential and timely dis- covery," said Emma to herself, pressing her lips indignantly, and turning the head of her horse back to St. Mary's. Ada- ratha, however, appeared to be even more disconcerted; for she became pale at the sight, and Emma was afraid, she sat so unsteadily, and seemed so embarrassed, that she would fall from her horse. "Strange," said Emma, mentally, "that father should have made the announcement to me last night of the very devoted regards of Mr. Montrose to my poor self, and that to-day I should see him bestowing marks of very devoted regards on Miss Evelin; who is, by-the-by, the last person I should have thought of in connection with him. But, stranger still, the scene just witnessed has caused great pain to poor Adaratha. Surely Mr. Montrose must be a very captivating man! By a declaration of his intentions to my father, my hand, I suppose he thinks, is to be had for the asking; he need do no more. He has evidently, when and how I know not, won Adaratha's heart; for this picture of himself and Jane Evelin gives her any thing but pleasure; and Jane Evelin here shows clearly how grateful his at- tention is to her. Here then there may have been three strings to his bow; one of them I'm resolved shall snap.' They had not rode far back towards St. Mary's, before they saw Parson Gordon and Julia riding towards them; and for whom they now stopt and waited. They said nothing of what had so startled them at the spring, but the four now pursued their way to the Glebe. The Parson and Julia did not look in the direction of the spring, while Emma, on coming near it a second time, to be certain she was not mis- taken, looked, and beheld Miss Evelin sitting under an oak, and leaning on Montrose, whose right arm supported her.   VISIT TO THE HEADLAND.       157 Emma had too much self-respect not to endeavour to put on an air of cheerfulness, and which she tried to infuse into Adaratha. But Emma could not be indifferent to the scene at the spring. "---to be wroth with those we love Doth work like madness on the brain." And, though not loving Montrose, yet, as was natural under the circumstances, she wished to think well of him and it was most painful to be obliged to think otherwise. Besides the favourable impression of his conversation and deportment, his being Julia's brother, and her declared suitor, gave her reason to think kindly of him, even should zhe feel most unwilling to contract an alliance with him. And it was painful to believe that he could be capable of the duplicity, caprice, and instability which the scene just witnessed appeared to convict him of. "Well did I say," she muttered, "that I had no reason to think more of him than an acquaintance. I must now look upon him as less." The afternoon of the same day, the three friends, with Robin McGregor and a servant to manage the boat, visited the headland where lived Croshaw and Adaratha. In days of yore, it was a sweet spot, but it was grown up in weeds and briars, and looked wild and desolate. Adaratha was painfully struck by the contrast, which its abandonment for a few months had produced; though she seems to have an- ticipated it in her remark wherein she, it will be remem- bered, congratulated Julia on finding her father and brother. And saddened, as the Indian maiden was by the event of the day, she became yet more so in viewing the loneliness of her former home. The poet of Keswick ceased to look with pleasure on the beautiful scenery of the Cumberland mountains after his friends, one by one, like leaves in wintry weather, had dropt away; and poor Adaratha now beheld not only an unpeopled home, and missed the familiar faces which rendered that home so dear, but desolation and aban- donment there. "I come get flower," said the maiden, "and see pet deer; but flower no pretty," and gathering some moss, "this do better, and poor pet no here." Emma and Julia heard this remark, and observed that she was busied in making for her head a chaplet of moss. All at once the report of a gup was heard, and a- deer VOL. II.-14                  .   PILATE AND HEROD. bounded from the thicket, with blood trickling down his side, and threw himself at Adaratha's feet. "Poor pet," said the Indian girl, casting her arms about the deer, and greatly concerned for his wound. "A thousand pardons I ask," said- a huntsman, at the moment presenting himself, nearly out of breath. "But I am happy at the meeting." Adaratha, hearing the voice, raised herself from the deer, and recognizing Montrose, screamed and fell. Emma and Julia were far enough off at the time not to know whether Adaratha fell at the report of the gun, or on the appearance of Montrose. They heard the gun's report, saw that Adaratha had fallen, and that part of her dress was bloody, and Montrose, standing by with gun in hand, they were certain, had fired the gun. McGregor was near them, and, like them, heard and saw enough to mislead him. An awful suspicion passed instantly across the minds of the two ladies, and especially McGregor's; which last, knew Montrose by sight only, and disliked him on account of his aristocratic bearing. Robin, therefore, before Emma and Julia could interfere, raised a large pole, and, running, to- wards Montrose with it, aimed a deadly blow at his head. "What?" exclaimed the latter, not suspecting why he was thus assailed. "This to me?" and, evading Robin's blow, he knocked him down with the butt-end of his fowl ing-piece; and felt in a mood to repeat the blow, had not Emma sprang forward, and opportunely came between them. "Begone!" said the spirited girl, provoked at his seeming atrocity in more senses that one. "To duplicity and murder add not a second manslaughter." "Duiplicity! murder!" choking as he spoke. "Where? when?" "Begone! I say," continued Emma, her eyes flashing. "Intrude no more on my company." "I'll obey," replied Montrose, deeply vexed and mor- tified,-" pleasant as it would be to linger here. But what mean you?  I'm guilty neither of duplicity nor murder." "We are at your mercy, sir. Will you let us retire?" Turning away, she made a signal to Julia to help her to place Adaratha, whom Emma   still supposed mortally wounded, in the boat. But during this time Julia was the   prey of emotions which nearly deprived her of reason. She leaned against a tree, pale, spent, and apparently rather the statue of a nymph than flesh and blood. She attempted to comply with Emma's wishes, and tottered a few steps, then stopping, and gazingeearnestly at Montrose, she screamed, and sobbing, My brother!" fell into his arms-.he hav- ing hurried on to meet her. A minute or two passed; and Montrose, bending overhis sister, pressed her to him-like her, overpowered by intense agitation. He soon, however, mastered his feelings, or rather was able to swallow down by an effort of the will the strong desire he had to stay where he was till he knew why he was so treated and stigmatized. He supported his sister to the water-side, and helped her in the boat. Then, returning, he placed Adaratha there,- who was nearly recovered from her swoon; and then waving his hand haughtily to Emma--for Montrose felt that his self-esteem had never been so wounded, and by an archer too so capable of making him feel so acutely, he turned away. All this time, Robin could do little more than raise him- self, groan from the pain he felt, and while he slowly dragged himself to the boat, mutter threats of vengeance against Montrose in broad gaelic. But Montrose was hardly buried in the forest, before Emma saw the wounded deer come limping towards the boat, and was made sensible that the murder, at least, which Montrose had committed, consisted only in wounding a pet deer. Adaratha had entirely revived, and Emma saw that the blood on her dress came from the deer. While Robin, therefore, was muttering his menaces, and the negro man, who wisely kept still, was now sculling the boat towards the Glebe, Emma's conscience smote her severely for her hasty and harsh language and conduct, and the sight of Julia, pale, silent, and nearly unconscious, rendered her reflections yet more poignant. At the Glebe-landing, Parson Gordon and Mr. Shepard met them. The latter inquired particularly for Montrose, and said: ",He left St. Mary's with his gun, and, knowing his hunting propensities, I presumed he would hunt on the way, and reach here by night. I heard a short time ago the report of a gun in the direction of Croshaw's headland, and Judged that his game must have led him off in that quar-   160       PILATE AND HEROD. ter. I therefore supposed he would fall in with you, and return with you in the boat." Emma wished to reply, and before Shepard, particularly, appear calm. But her eyes filled with tears, and saying she could not now explain, asked her father to help her to the house. "But what means all this?" asked her father. "At the mention- of Mr. Montrose's name you shed tears. He is 'not here with you-you seem to know why, but can't now say. Julia is borne down by grief, Adaratha is bloody, and my man, Robin, has an ugly blow on the head; and you all look as if something most unpleasant had hap- pened." "I will then tell you," said Emma, trying to be calm; and, after much effort, succeeded in giving a succinct state- ment of the occurrence, omitting aothing material, and, with many expressions of regret, acknowledging her inconsiderate- ness. "This is a day of adventures," said Shepard. He then explained that Montrose rode on towards the Glebe, passing by St. Mary's spring, that, on reaching the spring, he found a horse tied near by with a lady's saddle on him. He looked about to ascertain to whom it could belong, when he heard w scream, and then saw a lady running from a bull she sup- posed was pursuing her. He dismounted, hastened to her rescue, and came in time to save her from falling. The lady was Miss Evelin, who had an old servant woman living in a hut a few yards from the spring, whom she had visited, and was returning to the spring to mount her horse, when she was alarmed by the bull. Montrose had to support her out of the field, and, on reaching the grove near the spring, hdd to hold her for some time in his arms before she was able to ride back to the castle. Montrose heard the sound of horses' hoofs at the time he was sitting down holding Miss Evelin in his arms, but without changing his position could not, perhaps, see who the persons were. This, con- tinued Shepard, he learned at Colonel Smithsones, where he called for a few minutes on his way to the Glebe, and having there ascertained also that Parson Gordon, daughter, Miss Julia, and Adaratha had passed by the spring shortly after Montrose arrived at it, he inferred that they might have seen his friend and Miss Evelin at the spring. "Wait one moment, Mr. Shepard," interrupted Parson   EMMA'S STUPOR.        161 Gordon. "This poor child Julia must be borne into the house. Excuse me, Emma," and lifting Julia in his arms he deposited her in the house. For some time the party were concerned about Julia, and her condition was visibly improving, when a servant came in hastily, and said that one of the farm hands, while working on the point to the north-west of the house, saw a gentleman, whom he took to be Mr. Montrose, attempting to row a canoe over to the' Glebe from the opposite side. The wind was blowing as it had been for the last half hour, very fresh, and the boat turned over. The negro saw no more, and his conjectures that "Massa Montrose was sartainly drowned," were unwel- come comments on unwelcome tidiigs. Emma heard no more, thought no more, but fell back in a chair, where she lay in a long and painful stupor, crushed by the weight of the most distressing anxiety. "* i9'-  S   .     ,   CHAPTER XXIV. THE BOLDNESS AND ADDRESS OP MONTROSE. "Man! Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear." BYRON. As Montrose strode away from Emma, for the gentleman was too wrathy to walk, his agitation and excitement were almost enough to unbalance his mind. If the offender had been a masculine biped instead of a lovely-woman, it might. have been a great satisfaction to his wounded pride to have seft an ounce of lead into his heart; but as it was Cupid had mortally wounded him, Montrose, taking his station on that fair one's shoulders, with a bullet of a glance from her eye, and a smile from her mouth, and now that pretty mouth -on whose words he had hung, sweeter to him than the ambrosia and nectar of the gods-had stung him by a few sharp words sharply spoken, as severely as if every letter were a birc shot projected into him from a rifle. Such shots tell better than mortal ones. The latter would have laid him flat on the field, and there his troubles would have ended, but these bird shots stung and maddened him. The gentle- man had been hurt in a very tender place, and, unfortunately, he could not get his satisfaction. Now, as under such cir- cumstances, a stag thus wounded might, after running awhile, stop and apply its tongue to the suffering part, and seek to allay its irritation, Montrose, with like wisdom, after having mounted his horse, which he left in the woods, rode on very slowly for awhile, and, using his tongue in the best way he could, soliloquized: "This won't do. Emma must have believed that I had greatly offended, to have spoken so sharply. She is not wont to act but on good grounds, at all events in appear- ance." He then remembered having shot, ignorantly, Adaratha's pet deer, and that Adaratha had swooned, and that there was blood on her dress. This affair might, seen (162)'   MONTROSE'S SOLILOQUY.       163 at first sight, lead Emma to suppose he had shot Adaratha, and the charge of murder, on that supposition, was not wholly unsupported. But the word duplicity perplexed and vexed him not a little. And this was a puzzler. Emma certainly had a double vision, for she saw what he could not in his course. As a general thing, this was not to be wondered at, for who has the gift to " see ourselves as others see us?" And then the swooning away of Adaratha. Now the Mon- golian race, as Montrose knew, from the specimens he had seen in the proviAce of the aborigines, is not remarkable for sensibility. The fashionable and delicate lady of the beau monde, or the sentimental miss, always go for- scenes, and think nothing so pretty and romantic as the tragic exhibi- tion of a swoon, or the delirious cry and laugh of the hysterics. But poor Adaratha! what could she know of the refined luxury of a syncope? She probably was in the blissful ignorance of yet having to learn that she had nerves, and a very troublesome thing called a heart. But the same Creator made out of the same materials, the red face and the pale one, and nature's voice was as powerful in the heart of one as in the other. Adaratha may have swooned, though she knew not that it was an accomplishment in the salons and boudoirs of the European. She may have fainted away as gracefully as a French lady who knew how to die accord- ing to rule. It was a riddle, however, to; Montrose, and he could not resolve it. Having meditated to no other purpose than to make con- fusion worse confounded, he spurred on his horse, and saw'a cottage in sight. Here, if he could get a canoe, by a little rowing he might reach the Glebe in less time than he could on horseback ride round by the road. And, as over-eager- ness ever leaps too far, or not far enough, he. concluded to leave his horse at the hut in view, extract from Emma an explanation of her conduct, and then,- running back to the hut, remount his horse, and spend the night at St. Mary's, his pride being too much touched to think of accepting the hos- pitality of Emma's father; though such had been his arrange- ment by letter with Shepard, and which, as will be remem- bered, had been suggested by Julia's letter. "Can I get a canoe here?" he asked the cottager, who met him at the door. "You may, and you mayn't," was the reply.   164       PILATE AND HEROD. "Speak intelligibly. I want a canoe to cross over this creek to the Glebe. 'll bring it back to-night." "Can't you ride there?" asked the man, 'and take a night? -Prehaps you're afeared of the parson! You don't want no one but the gal hersel."  The cottager judged Montrose by himself.  He would have approached his Blouzelinda in a sneaking way, and thought Montrose, being in love, must go with his head down, have a stolen interview with Emma, and there either snivel out his devo- tion, or, with something of the address of Lochinvar, bear his lady off; asking the parson no favours. "None of your gal," speaking sternly. "Can I get a canoe?" "Gents sich as ye," said the man, "kin talk big to a poor man; but what 'surance mought I have, I mayn't see ye agin?" "Here's my horse in pledge. -Come, move quickly. I must be off."l "Move quickly," muttered the man. "Them's the thanks what sich as we git. If them lords with goold waistcoats gin ony thing 'scept 'tis a kick, why we must be mighty 'bliged, I 'spose." Montrose felt half inclined to suit the action to the word of the boor; but, checking himself with better judgment, he took out a piece of money; handed'it to him, and asked him to lose no time as his business was urgent. The cottager's face softened, and, with a poor attempt at a bow, hastened to the creek-side; saying:  "He aint arter all one of them proud gentsj I 'sposed." Montrose in the meantime dismounted, and gave his horse and gun into the man's keeping. While the cottager was bailing the water out of the boat, thick black clouds were fast gathering in the north-west, and a strong wind began to blow. As Montrose entered the boat, and was pushing it off, the cottager, observing the angry aspect' of the clouds, and how the wind swept across the creek; said, "Mind, mister, pole the cunnue to the pint-whar ye see the Injun's house-keepin close in all the way-whar ye may feel bot- tom-when ye gits to the pint, go it like a streak o' lightnin for the parson's. Keep the cunnue, mind ye, right 'fore the wind, and she's stiff as a June bug, and tight as a gourd; but, by the pokies, if ye tries to cross 'fore ye gits to the , . .   MONTROSE CROSSING TIIE CREEK.     165 pint, I hopes to eat dirt and taturs if ye sees your gal to- night." This was all lost on Montrose. He was soon in the mid. die of the creek, and bearing directly out of it. But the creek here was too shaded by lofty oaks, poplars, and ches- nuts, to feel much of the wind that then blew fearfully. Soon he reached a small point, where a field of the Glebe farm projected into the creek; arid here he saw the Glebe house distinctly defined on the sky beyond, with its sharp roof, and Dutch proportions. The  sight of the house where Emma lived made Montrose feel that he would weather a storm in the Chesapeake in his crazy boat to get to her. Having attained the point mentioned, he might there have landed, and walked to the house, or by keeping the Glebe shore, winding as it was, he could safely have reached the landing after vigorous pulling and poling. But -' -- "Crazed with care, And crossed with hopeless love," reckless, and sans souci about peril, he paddled due south for Croshaw's  headlandj thus leaving the Glebe shore.  Now to make this headland he must row with the wind and waves on his bows; and he was in that state of mind which courts danger, thinks not of difficulty, and counts every thing achievable. 'But here the creek considerably widened' and, a small Indian clearing being just to the north- west of him, the wind swept furiously through the opening, rolled the water in yeasty waves, and made the creek boil as if old Vulcan had brought his furnace into this quiet nook of Neptune's domains. Montrose now became aware that his canoe could not stand the trough of such a sea; still his resolution was good to push her through and on. "The opening is small," he said. "A few bold strokes, and she'll reach the calm waters this side of the headland, and then I can let her drive before the wind nearly all the way to the parson's landing." But it is easier to say than do. His boat rocked like a cradle, and, manfully as he laboured, much strength was thrown away.  His paddle only touched now and then, and more than half the time did no good. In his violent effort he broke the paddle, and, the effort being made on the left hand side of the canoe, drove it to the right; and then, the   100   b   b PILATE AND HEROD, wind and trough striking her, and having now no paddle to steady her, the boat was lifted on the wave, and being struck by a second, before righting, was turned over. Montrose had just time to see his danger. He rose from under the boat, and, tired as he was, made directly for the shore, not very far from the head-land where he had last parted from Emma. Singular coincidence, and as unplea- sant as singular! He had left there a -few minutes before flaming with indignation,-he stood there now cooled down to 40 Fahrenheit. A field-hand belonging to the Glebe saw the canoe capsize, but did not see Montrose afterwards, -did not know that dame fortune had just administered to him the same remedy for wrath that our old English laws were wont to administer to scolds. The wetting, therefore, was not without service, "I was very silly," was his first reflection on reaching shoe. Happy man i if in that washing he could have been cleansed indeed. We will hope he was. He saw it was silly to knock Robin down, when he might have parried or avoided the blow, and come to an understanding with him; silly to disdain the hospitality of the kind-hearted pastor, because the daughter had insulted him, when all would have been mended,- and Emma's smile and penitential ac- knowledgment would have made him love her all the more perhaps, for love is blind, and goes by contraries, and from one extreme to another. "Now," said he, " for a long ride to St. Mary's with wet clothes on." A walk of little more than a mile brought him to the cottager's house. "Ye must take a swim, eh! Waler's cold, aint it?"-- and the boor giggled. "I telled ye so; but no, we poor folks don't know nothing." Self-interest the next moment was in the ascendant. "Ye havn't left my boat to blow out of the creek? Can't be ye's sunk her? May be ye 'low me the gun?"-pointing to his splendid fowling-piece. "What's your idee, Ben?" addressing a red-haired fisher- man, who sat behind the door, and who till now had not been seen by Montrose. a My idee," said Ben. "I sartainly 'spose you mought hold on to the gun till he gits the cunnue." Montrose had much penetration, and could distinguish l   SHOOTING MATCH.         167 between mere talk and what covered the deeper meaning. He saw the propriety of dissembling; for, with only his short sword, which, he wore, in common with the gentry of that day, he was ill able to cope with two stout and un- scrupulous rustics, who evidently had designs on his gun, and might have an itching affection for his horse. "Give me that gun," said Montrose, to the cottager, whose name was Redman. " Before I let you have her for the boat, I'll show you what she can do; and, if your red- haired friend,/--whose name was Littleworth,-" will beat me in one shot out of five, I'll let him have my horse." "'Greed," exclaimed Littleworth, starting up suddenly, "nare fish-hawk, nor nothing neither what go up bird-like I can't hit." "But I mean,"' said Montrose, coolly, "to shoot at a mark, and strike it every time out of five shots; and I mean to shoot from my horse, running him at the same time. You are to be mounted too, and to hit the mark one time in five trials, running your horse as you shoot." "'Deed ! mistur,J" said Littleworth, and he took down an old gun, hurried to the stable, and soon returned with an old plough-horse. "Do you," said Montrose to Rednian, "make a white chalk mark of the size of my hat on the large gate post yonder, that leads out to the main road; and, as I shall shoot running, and my horse is skittish, and hard to stop, so open the gate, .that he may not hurt himself against it, after I have fired." Redman, the cottager and owner of the boat, did as he was asked, with both alacrity and pleasure, saying to him- self at the time: "This young fellow   be's a bigger goose than I 'sposed.   Deed! he don't know how old  Poll runs steady, neither how Ben kin shoot from her back."  And forgetting his boat in the prize thus offered to him, a fine gun, he continued: "Darnell and Hackett, and them thar town folks may stand back when the lawyers and folks cum to court. We boys from Poplar Hill kin shoot wi' them now in the Court House Square." Montrose, having possessed himself of his horse and gun with his feet well planted in the stirrups, examined his gun to see if the load had been drawn. Having ascertained that there was a load in her, and her priming was right, he threw  his powder.horn and    shot-bag over his shoul.   168        PILATE AND HEROD. ders, and then inspected them to see how stood his ammu- nition. "As I feared," he said, "these fellows have just that gauge of understanding to make them scamps. They have emptied my horn-bag, and this accounts for their readiness in giving back my property. They are both armed ;" for he noticed that the cottager, Redman, had a gun, no less than Littleworth, the red-haired fisherman. "They are probably good shots, and," slapping his horse, "now, Selim, if you don't do your best, I shall stand a chance of being shot; and you may have to break up this boor's ground, instead of hunting deer." I'll stand nigh by the gate yonder," said Redman, who was mounted, taking his gun as he spoke, and riding forward to the gate, "it mought be you'd shoot twice, and so I've took my gun and filly, case Ben don't beat ye, to try shootin with ye mysel." "Worse and worse," reflected Montrose, "I am in the clutches of these candidates for the rope, unless Provi- dence and my good horse favour me. This smirk Redman means, by planting himself near the gate, to shoot me if I endeavour to run off. Well," pressing his lips together, "I'll show them that I can ride; that Selim'can fly like the wind; and that at need, if they force me to it, I can send a ball equal to any sportsman." Littleworth now stood close by Montrose, mounted and armed; while Redman on his horse and .with gun in hand, stood near the gate, where the mark was made; anxiously looking on, and prepared to shoot Montrose, should he at- tempt to ride beyond the gate, which by his directions he had opened. "Are you ready?" asked Montrose. "Yes," replied Littleworth. "We'll ride slowly the first fifty yards;" continued Mon- trose, "then in a gentle gallop the next twenty-five; for I suppose the gate is about a hundred yards off, and when we get to the large cedar ahead, we will run our horses: and when we come to the pine tree, which is within gun-shot of the gate, we will fire." "All right," replied Littleworth, riding on slowly; and steadying hinself, he endeavoured to act as stated; and he chuckled as he thought how blank, and much at the mercy of him and Redman would be. Montrose, when he had fired   SHOOTING- MATCH.        169 off the only load he had; though we presume neither of them contemplated with pleasure, or as a thing determined upon, thb taking of. his life. This is an atrocity which even the blood-dyed villain looks not upon, and comes not to, but at the goading of crime and desperate passions. Life is a holy thing, and God has so fenced it around that man leaps not the barrier to shed his brother's blood, except pressed on to it by seeming necessity, and these boors, if they thought at all, knew they would have to swing if they shot Montrose. Having rode half the distance, they kept on together in a gentle gallop, twenty-five yards further, to the cedar men- tioned. "Now," said Montrose, "we'll run our horse, to the pine tree, and there we'll fire." And off, like racers running for the purse, they went. With his left hand on the bridle, and his right holding to his gun, Montrose urged his horse so as to run him just fast enough to keep up with Little- worth, till they came to the pine tree: which they reached at the same time: though it was evident that Selim was not going at his full speed, and 'could easily distance Little- worth's old mare. "Now," said Montrose in a commanding tone. "Ready, aim, fire!" suiting the action to the word, as if he meant to shoot; which, however, was not his intention, and at the same time he buried his rowels into Selim's flanks, and shouted, 'go it, go it." Littleworth fired, and pressed on with a speed that the old mare had never perhaps exceeded, when young and fresh in breast and limb. Redman heard the report, and saw the dust flying. But, as Littleworth reached the gate, Montrose had passed through and beyond it; and was pushing for the main-road, when ahead, intercepting his progress, he saw a high barred gate. "My horse," thought he, "to clear this gate, must hold in a second, and blow." He turned, and saw Redman on his fresh horse; counting on Montrose having fired off his load, and on his being un- able to clear the bars; and, with this opinion, was riding with all speed after him. Montrose heard him call, "Stop; I'll shoot." "Go back!" shouted Montrose in reply, "or I'll shoot you." The wind blew away his words, Redman pressed ahead, resolved to capture Montrose, and not lose such a chance of getting a good horse. VOL. IL.-15   fl' U      PILATE AND IIEROD. "Come back and try again," called out Redman, " ye don't fool me sich a way agin." All this time, Montrose had been approaching the gate, but still had so slackened his pace, that Redman or Littleworth, must bring him within reach of their guns, unless he at once should place himself out of their shot, and then clear the gate. Here, too, the road made an elbow to the right, which added to the dis- tance to the bars, and Montrose saw in amazement, that by a private path which cut off half the distance, Redman might reach the gate first, and on which the latter counted. "I must shoot him then, or be shot," was the thought that quicker than he could speak it, came into his mind. And with his trigger drawn, and eye fixed steadily on Redman, so as not to miss him, Montrose rode sufficiently fast to keep ahead of Littleworth. He must now start his horse into a run, and clear the bars; but Redman by the short cut had placed himself between him and them; and was prepared to shoot him should he attempt to leap them. Montrose paused the blood came and went, and his heart beat quick. It was only for an instant, however, and on such fleeting moments, too brief to be measured, how much depends?"M, My life or his," his lips faintly murmured. Redman raised his gun, and was taking his aim. Montrose fired, and waiting not to see the result, drove his spurs into his horse. The noble beast with a leap that would have done credit to the steeple chasers of England, cleared the bars completely. He then turned, and saw that Redman had fallen, and that Little- worth was riding hastily to his assistance. He was now in the main-road, soon passed by Poplar Hill Church, and, as fast he could prudently ride his horse, he pushed on to St. Mary's. In the excitement Montrose was unconscious of his wet clothes. On arriving at the Free Briton he changed his wet garments, directed the servant to rub his horse down, carefully, and went to bed. "Call me up at light to-mor- row," was his charge to the servant, "and feed and groom Selim ready for a journey." "Ky, young massa," muttered the negro, "treat him horse hard. Here jam by the midnight, and him jest got to bed; and fore massa kin turn ober, here kum day; and up he gits, and went agin. If boksa have nigger sense, it wouldn't be work, work. Him wake like crowing fowl all time of de night, and like owl, him bawl in de night for sar- vant, 'stead of him setting on roost, and sleep dere,'   CONCERN FOR MONTROSE       171 The negro's reflections were not heard by Montrose. -And Cuffy, having given utterance to them, was too much of a philosopher to be even for a moment disturbed; true philos- ophy consisting, as goes the world, rather in wise saws and solemn sentences, than in giving one's self trouble about the past or future. He gathered his person up into a ball be- fore a blazing fire in the bar-room, with his heels, than whitleather more tough, in the ashes, and his head closely covered by a blanket; and Cuffy very soon was in the land where all things are forgotten. In the- meanwhile, Parson Gordon and family, including Shepard, were much concerned about Montrose. Shepard, at the risk of his life, took a canoe, and hunted about fhe creek till night's shadows wrapt every thing in comparative darkness; the wind by this time having somewhat lulled. Shepard then mounted his horse, saying he would ride round to Croshaw's cabin, and if he heard or saw any thing of his missing friend, he would return to the Glebe, and re- port it. After a ride of two miles, he came to the bars over which Montrose had leaped his horse. He here dismounted, and commenced taking down the bars. The moon had just risen, and chancing to look up, as he was leading his horse in, he started on seeing a man, bleeding, lying on the ground, and another man standing by. "Let them thar bars be," said Littleworth. "I spose you're kin to that mister what shot cousin Redman." 'Mister fiery-head," replied Shepard, "Have you seen a gentleman who was mounted on a dark bay, with a gun, having long hair, and fair complexion?" "'Havn't I? I reckon as how I'd give my old mare to see him agin. For ain't he murthered cousin, here? And didn't he jump his crittur o'er them thar bars, as if they warn't nothing? And this didn't he do arter losin cousin's cunnue?" "This is the man who can tell me what I wish to know," speaking to himself. "Montrose shot this boor on the 'ground, no doubt, because he and this woodpecker friend threatened violence." Approaching Redman, who groaned as if every throb of plain would be his last, Shepard, by the bright moonlight, examined his wounds as well as he could; both Redman and Littleworth eying him suspiciously; and from the examination he inferred that Redman was danger- ously, perhaps fatally wounded. He next by questions, but which Ben took his own time to answer, (for Shepard had   172       IrLATE AND HEROD. served his apprenticeship at the bar, and few knew better how to make a witness tell the whole truth,) pumped out of Ben all that passed, the accident in the boat, the wager, the address with which Montrose saved his life, horse and fowl- ing piece, and the desperate measure he was driven to of shooting Redman, and 'then of leaping his horse over an eight-barred gate. Shepard then hastily rode back to the glebe, and telling Robin, whom he saw at the gate, to say to Parson Gordon he had news for him, but had not time to dismount. On Mr. Gordon's coming out, he communicated to hin the result of his investigation. "This is better than I had expected," said Parson Gordon, ?^.  u is though it is bad."  i;^.. -Bad?-Bad?  I should say that Mr. Montrose," re- Ch ;:niid Shepard, " was a benefactor to the provinee, if Redman '   day, in ridding it of such a nuisance, on the same principle that our Assembly allows a certain sum to every one who should kill a wolf." "Not so, Mr. Shepard," said Parson Gordon, gravely, "you suffer your prejudices to run to extremes which your sober judgment will not allow you to persist in." "Why," interrupted Shepard, with some surprise in his tone and manner, "no blame attaches to Mr. Montrose. Self-defence is the first law of nature, and no state of society can deprive us of it. By this law we may repel force by force, whenever either ourselves or families are attacked in, person or property. Our English laws say violence under such provocation is not a breach of the peace. Matters would come to a fine pass if passive submission were the law. Why the weak would be at the mercy of the strong and vio- lent. I have no faith in that morality which would tie my hands, and compel me unresistingly to say to my assailant, "ay on McDuff;' and," softening his tone, he added,  " neither do I think your reverence has."' "it does not," said Parson Gordon slightly smiling. "TI admit fully the right of self-defence, but consider the taking away life ah extreme remedy--a fearful resort; one that under no circumstances we can reeal without deep sorrow, that we should have been forced to take that life we cannot give, sending into the other world a soul laden with sin." "If smitten on one cheek, then, we are tot to turn the other?" asked Shepard, half serious and half sportively.   DIALOGUE.          173 "Our Saviour says we should, and I must say so too,  replied the parson.            -     ) "Practically?" asked Shepard, as if he doubted. "Certainly. I must practise- what I believe,' replied the parson, " though I fear much I should not; and, while I defer to the righteousness of self-defence, when life is assailed, and-would not have blamed Lucretia, if she had stabbed Tarquin to the heart for attempting her virtue; yet in other cases, not of protection, the smiting back again seems to be condemned." "War, then," said Shepard, " you would defend?" "Undoubtedly," replied the rector, erecting his person, and assuming a martial look and manner, as if the trump of battle was sounding in his ears. "Why, sir, on this ground  Tully defended Milo. The centurion was a Roman military '% officer, and our Lord, in place of condemning his calling, commended his faith as the greatest He had found in all' Israel. Still, Mr. Shepard,"-Parson Gordon paused, and looking towards the creek on which the moonlight fell, soft- ening and kindling it,-" as Christian men our weapons should be spiritual, not, carnal. We fight most surely when our hands are lifted in prayer, rather than employed aim- ing deadly blows, and when we confront our enemies with a soft answer that turneth away wrath, rather than one of bold defiance or scorn." ' I am keeping your reverence in the night air," inter- rupted Shepard; and, as he rode off, he muttered, "Well, it may be so, but the gift to see it to be so has not been imparted to me." "It is providential for Mr. Montrose," soliloquized -Par- son Gordon, "that his friend can prove so much in extenu- ation of his offence." McGregor, however, neither so reasoned   nor thought. Of Shepard's statement he only heard that 'Montrose had shot Redman, and that the latter was likely to die of it. He waited to hear no more, but posted to the kitchen, not sorry, we fear, to have bad news to report of Montrose. The negroes heard 'him with all wonderment, and many ejaculations accordingly, and in the midst of his tale, Ada- ratha came in, and heard him repeat it more' than once with paraphrases that both lengthened and aggravated it. In the meanwhile, what had been the feelings of the females in the household? Recovered from   her stupor, 15*   174       PILATE AND HEROD. Emma, without knowing why, sought relief in thinking of Montrose; and pity, which is akin to love, with the circum- stance mentioned concurring, tended, perhaps, to fix the image of Montrose on her heart; for the heart, while at times' unimpressible as adamant, at others is as yielding as wax. And it is probable that Montrose gained more by these undesigned, and, as they then appeared to be, lament- able circumstances, than he might have done by the most studied efforts to win his way. On her recovery, Julia was informed of the entire inno- cence of her brother in the unpleasant affair at Croshaw's cabin. 'But, poor girl! before, her mind could enjoy the calm which this report duly produced, she heard the ser- rvant's statement that her brother was drowned and then her heart's strings appeared almost to crack, and she aban- doned herself to immoderate grief. Adaratha, however, though at first betraying much sensi- bility, had fallen back on an Indian's seeming stoicism, and she evinced an Indian's calmness under suffering. We said she heard Robin's statement, which he had gathered from Mr. Shepard,'and this greatly relieved her; and she hast- ened to impart to her friends the glad tiding that cheered her. For, reasoning as an Indian, killing seemed to her to be only an every day occurrence, and to which no blame attached, if done in the way of battle or private contest. "I don't, and won't believe a word of what Robin says," said Julia, indignantly. "If brother Charles did shoot him, he was forced to it; and though I am a woman, yet all things are not to be borne." Thus spoke out human nature, thus vindicated a woman's love, and thus resented a sister's affection. "Don't talk so, -dear Julia," said Emma, with forced calmness. And, turning to Adaratha, she asked: "Did you not hear Robin say this?"       " -Adaratha wondered why Emma and Julia were con- cerned that Redman was shot. Now that Montrose was not drowned, as they had feared, there was ground for rejoicing. "Ah!" continued Emma.   "I know Robin's Scotch * prejudices. I'll see father;" and she hurried below stairs, and Julia and Adaratha quietly followed her. She easily found Parson Gordon. He was at the time walking up and down the parlour, ruminating on the che-   PARSON GORDON'S SOLILOQUY.      175 quered incidents of human life, and upon the sad termina- tion of the brightest prospects, from the hot haste of youth and' the untamed fierceness of an unsanctified nature. "This youth, Montrose," he said mentally, " may have the root in him; but I wish to see the fruits also. I fear he is too, too impulsive. He has good intentions and correct views; and, if not interfered with or opposed, will be useful and much respected. But morality and superior intelligence should be seen elsewhere as well as in the parlour and social circle. They should shine, not merely in stereotyped opinions, and well finished sentences, but in the life and conduct. We should prove our superior intelligence and morality to others, by better discerning the good, and more promptly rejecting the evil. Alas! the blood of youth, which the Spirit of holiness has not cooled down to mode- ration and judgment, and taught to throb in. obedience to high and sacred impulses, is a fiery stream, burning as the lava, and like a mountain torrent overleaps barriers, and bears down opposition, while mere morality erects no better breakwater than a bank of sand." "Father, do come here," exclaimed Emma, and meeting her, he asked her wishes. Emma mentioned Robin's report. Her father could but smile. He said: :u Ah! I fear Robin is not only a true Scotchman, but a full blooded McGregor. 'I forgive,' is a hard word for him to say." He then gave her Shepard's statement, and satisfied her that Montrose had been unfortunately forced to shoot Redman; but there was no heinousness in his act. "Didn't I say so," burst out Julia- "and she gave way to an hysterical laugh, that seemed for awhile fearful. She rallied, however, and, instead of the foam and surging of a breaking heart, she became calm comparatively, and the oil of gladness was seen to be "glittering on the water of an ebbing grief." Emma, overcome, laid her head on her father's shoulder, and, in despite of her wonted self-command, shed tears, which appeared to speak an interest in Montrose beyond that of an ordinary acquaintance. Her father alone observed it, and said to himself: "Whether she loves him or not I do not object to this expression of feeling. If I must choose between the two, I had rather that my daughter should be even like Niobe all tears, than that she should be petrified into a stone-like apathy, and a statuesque coldness."   CHAPTER XXV. PARSON GORDON AND FATHER CANON'-MRS. ANNIE-A PURITAN COURTSHP-A SCENE AT POPLAR SPRING. "The young must hope-it is the dower of God, To smooth life's flinty way. The young must hope--and beautiful to see Their blind reliance, seraph Hope, in thee! What if it be the vainest phantasy! Forbear to undeceive; Oh let them still Dream sweetly on; too soon the hours fulfil Life's dark irrevocable destiny!" ECLECTIC MAGAZINE. EARLY next morning Parson Gordon was about sending to inquire into the state of Redman's health, when he re- ceived a note from Mr. Holt, requesting him to ride to Pleasant Lodge that morning, as he heard he had a call in that neighbourhood. The writer was very desirous to have some conversation with him, about the obnoxious proposi- tion of an ecclesiastical court, to be called by the approaching legislature. On  s way to Pleasant Lodge, Parson Gordon passed by the barred gate, over which Montrose had made his horse leap. and thought he. would ride to Redman's house, and set' his mind at ease about the affair of yesterday. But, as he was entering in the gate, he saw coming towards him Father Canon, trudging at his usual pace, as if he never was in a hurry, and was determined to take the world fair and easy, let it wag or fuss as it might. "I will halt here,' was his reflection. "Mr. Canon has probably been to ad- minister to R-edman the last office of the Roman Church. He must be therefore very low. And yet little hope, I should think, he could give to such a man. By giving him the last unction, he must believe that he is not exactly a meet subject for the punishment of the lost. He is to go then to purgatory. And great comfort is there in such a thought. He is to be tormented by material fire, and the torture of devils, and may undergo such purgation, long (176)   HOLY OTL.          1" even as they would represent the persons dying in Noah's time Suffered in prison till Christ's descent into hell." Mr. Canon now came up, and stated that he had been sent for in the night; the messenger leaving Redman's a little after dark, and reaching St. Inigoes' by midnight. "A barbarous custom this," continued the Roman eccle- siastic. "Not often may we clerics lie down in confidence that we shall not be called up before morning. True, Beau- mont and Fletcher say, Sleep is care charming, an easer of all woes ;' but seldom are our woes so eased, and our cares so uninter- ruptedly charmed. No, sir, chilly as was the night, and much as I felt the fast the day before, I had to ride my beast over twenty miles; and all to see a man who is as likely to die in a year, as that old pine tree yonder, which has stood many a blast; or as you and I, who may yet look forward to feel half a score of winters howling through our boughs." "Then he is not seriously wounded? Thankful am I to hear it." "Seriously wounded! oh very seriously; for the boor is scared out of all reason; and his face looks serious now, if never before. But really I asked no question about the way he was wounded; though a dull clod-pated lump of mire, whose hair seems to have been dyed in red ochre, tried to tell me in his gibberish jargon. The rub with him is the fear of old Nick, and I must come this long ride to prepare him; as if such a fellow could be so greased with the holy unction as to slip into purgatory out of the old boy's clutches." "A most sorry specimen of humanity, I fear." "Many, many such. Many who only want certain ap pendages in the rear to make them proper quadrupeds, as much as those cows in the field yonder." "Too true, I fear," said the rector, "but such a man is hardly more fitting to receive a holy rite than a beast or stone." ' "But you know, Holy Church says, God's image was only dimmed, not lost, by the fall, and that the power to think and do good works, though feeble from Adam's sin, remains still. This fellow, then, degraded as he is, is human after all; his soul may be benefitted by the sacraments of the,   178       PILATE AND HEROD. church. For, as you know, they infuse grace into him, un. conscious agent that he is." "Object you mean, since he is to do nothing," inter- rupted Parson Gordon, gravely, and shaking his head. "Well, object let it be, continued the priest. "We won't quarrel about words, when you and I can interpret them as we please. As I was saying, it little matters that he is at, the time unconscious as a stone or a dumb beast; seeing that the sacraments infuse into him the righfeoueoess of Christ. And St. James commanded thatf holy oil be used for the moribundis." He now halted his horse, and profifer- ing his hand, continued, "We now take different roads--we part in peace, however. "Certainly," replied Parson Gordon, shaking his ex- tended hand, " and right pleasant would it be if we were -journeying together on a more important road--on the roladl to the city, which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God." And Mr. Gordon kept on towards Pleasant Lodge, and was discussing to himself the great difference between the Catholic view of the sacraments, and the Roman view of the opus operatum, when he heard Mr.-Holt's voice. "You are in a brown study, reverend sir;' and, looking up, saw Mr. Holt standing near him. This worthy gentle- man had just received a letter from Johnson, the college chum of Montrose, who made very particular inquiries about him. Parson Gordon then said that Mr. Montrose had had an adventure that might have been very serious. Mr. Holt looked concerned, and Parson Gordon mentioned his affair with Redman and Littleworth. " This will not do" said Mr. :Holt. "He had best return with his friend Johnson; Vices, like weeds, grow rank in new settlements." Parson Gordon thought to himself, Mr. Holt's nephew has plans in contemplation which his uncle does not dream of. Mr. Holt then spoke of the project which the enemies of the church in the province made no secret of, the creating an ecclesiastical court by the Legislature for the trial of the clergy -of the established church. "Desperate diseases," said Mr. Holt, "I allow, require desperate remedies. But I doubt whether any such extrem- ity now exists. Every man of doubtful principles, or lax             .    DIALOGUE.          179 morals, is interested in lowering the clergy, in order to re- move a body of men whose very existence is a condemnation to himself; and hence such men affect a holy horror at the ungodliness of the clergy; and artfully avail themselves of this counterfeited regard for their purity to make men think the clergy are Go better than themselves. I doubt also whether the ecclesiastical court is a specific for the immorality complained of; though really I am not aware that such a gangrene affects the clerical body in the province. The ec- clesiastical court is an engine of tyranny; a nostrum not to cuf, but kill, the clerical body. I, for one, wish to have no such power to prescribe for a class of men whom Christ Him- self empowered to prescribe for us. But I fear, I fear much, that, with Papists and Quakers to help, the enemies of true religion will pass the bill." i"I will endeavour to be in Annapolis," said Parson Gor- don, and trust, this bill may be killed in transitu." "There is one man whose assistance we shall find a host, if we can secure him," said Mr. Holt; " but I fear he is too intent on pleasure to care about such things; and yet he is the very man to manage those law-makers. His knowledge of men, tact and address, I have heard much commended." "Mr. Shepard, you mean?" asked Parson Gordon. "I should judge as much. But he is a man of the world, and will give his influence where his interest lies; or he will not mix himself in the question; like Gallio, not caring for any of those things. But here comes Mrs. Annie. We'll talk this matter over again." As he spoke Mrs. Annie, in Colonel Smithson's carriage, rode to the front door. "Your reverence must allow me this pleasure," said Mr. Holt, anticipating Parson Gordon's movements. "  Mrs. Annie and I are special friends;' and, looking significantly at Parson Gordon, he said in an undertone, '-(She can do more with him, you know, than any one else," alluding to her influence over Shepard. Having greeted Mrs. Annie, and taken her arm in his this most estimable specimen of a gentleman of the old school, (who exemplihfy continually Lord Chatham's defini- tion of true politeness, "benevolence in trifles,") with the activity of youth, and a face radiant with benevolence, passed into the house with his fair visiter. "Where is Julia?" inquired Mrs. Annie. "Now this is too bad, is it not 7" said Mr. Holt, address- ,' /    180        PILATE AND HEROD. ing Parson Gordon.  It is saying she did'not come to see I an old gentleman like myself. We old folks, your rever- ence, I fear have lost all our powers of pleasing with Mrs. Annie. I flattered myself that, though I was a few years older than the sparks that now fly about young ladies, I could still play the agreeable, and that my friend Mrs. Annie would be the very last to turn from me." "So she will be," said Mrs. Annie, smiling; and giving her hand to Mr. Holt, she shook his playfully, and paid, "You know, when I next sell my liberty, I promised to let' yon have the end of the chain." "Yes) yes," said Mr. Holt, bowing and smiling. "The chain I am to fasten on my neck, and' then pass it back to you; thanks, Mrs. Annie." A few minutes afterwards Mr. Holt was called out by a message. Parson Gordon and Mrs. Annie had a conversa- tion touching the subject they had talked about last at Elfin Hall, and the parson was pleased to find that she was very slightly tinged with the taint of Romanism; but this, like some taints which no chemical washes can wholly remove, comes off slowly and gradually. "The lamp of God," he saidto her, " is jefore you; let it be ' a lamp unto your feet, and a light unto your paths.' Study the Scriptures with the assistance of your Prayer Book, and pray God to 'open your eyes to see the wondrous things of His law." ,Mrs. Annie manifested by her manner that her heart was deeply interested in the subject of the truth or falsehood of the, distinctive peculiarities of Romanism. It was evident that she was not acting a part, nor trying to get up an interest in her behalf, and a stirs and thu make a pompous parade of those feelings which are ever to be suspected when they proclaim themselves publicly. With the multitude at Pen- tecost she had asked to be told what to do, from a sense of ignorance, and an earnest, deep desire to be taught, and, like king David, she might almost say, sleep came not to her eyelids till she,had found a place for the temple of the Lord, and became satisfied that God was seated in his holiness and power in the hallowed shrines of the apostolic Church of England, while she feared he was not to be found amidst those altars which were defiled by the bones of a departed or supposititious saint, and where the virgin is more adored than is God. "I wish I had known before," said Mrs./Annie, 'that, in rendering to any creature, even the blessed virgin,   DIALOGUE. -181 praise and adoration, I was committing th awful sin of ido- latry," and she trembled lest a jealous God might not forgive her ascribing to another his awful and incommunicable attri- butes, nor the rendering to another the honour, homage, or worship which are due to him only. She then observed to Paepon Gordon, being much moved as she spoke, how vastly more comfortable it was to believe that the ear of God was ever open to hear the contrite sinner's voice, without any human mediator, (the sinner looking to the merits and medi- ation of Christ only,) than to believe you must address your- self to the virgin, or saints, and ask them to pray for you. It was this dogma of the Roman church which, as we stated had gained most upon her sensibilities, and, this dogma losing its hold, she was able to see clearly the points of disagreement between the Catholic church as represented by one of its branches, the Church of England, and the Roman branch of it. And the face of Jesus reconciled, the hope that looked to him, and him only, as mighty and willing to save, the sweet comfort that, as dew from the mercy-seat, shed upon her heart its gracious, soothing, and sustaining power, were results that never could have been accomplished by the sensuous religion of Rome. "Oh!" said Mrs. Annie, her eyes filling with tears at the time," too, too thankful I cannot be that God, through-your means, my dear sir, has brought me to this state of salvation, and saved me from a confessor who wished me to hate my good mother." Julia now entered, and had just heard that Redman was not mortally wounded, and her spirits, as usual, especially after the pressure to which they had been subjected, were about to explode in frolicsome freaks. And, after playfully remarking to her uncle that she had heard him say the old astrologers said certain constellations presided over certain days, she asked what constellation was in the ascendant. "Why, child?" replied her uncle, "I think the constel- lation Aries, or the Ram, is in the ascendant now." "So I   should think," continued Julia, " for see how we have been butted about. The  butting powers must have. been in the ascendant, surely."          ;^ We said that Shepard left the Glebe for St. Mary's. A the head of the river, finding a light burning at DoolittlIsA house, which was near the Indian cabins there, he determiWed to call and make certain statements to Doolittle, wlho, he VOL. II.---16   182       PILATE AND HEROD. knew, would duly report the same to Snarler, as would oblige the latter to keep quiet about the assault which Montrose made upon him. Having satisfied Doolittle that Snarler could accomplish nothing by a prosecution, Shepard could not refrain, as he was leaving the house, from saying, "Say to Mr. Snarler I congratulate him on having no bones 'broken," and then, looking serious, he said, to Doo- little, " if his temper were as inoffensive as his position, he might be as undisturbed as the humble bee, who buries her honey under ground. Unfortunately, however, he is snap- pish at times, being afraid that the world will forget the little creature who is delving and fussing in his obscure hole." Shepard then rode off, and was revolving the events of the foregoing day, when he espied a figure ahead, walking under the trees in the moonlight, with another figure in woman's apparel. The first figure Shepard knew to be Allgrace, for his form and step were unmistakeable, and the other figure he discovered to be Miss Doolittle, to whom, it was said, Allgrace was making his bow matrimonial. Shepard dis- mounted quietly, and, fastening his horse to a tree, approached near, enough to the parties to overhear them, keeping himself in the shade of the forest. "'As I live," said he mentally, " here are Allgrace and spinster Doolittle, walking as innocently together, and yet as lover-like, as Adam and Eve in Paradise. Here is not only a -courtship, al fresco, but sub Jove frigido. I have longed, wished," advancing cautiously as he soliloquized, "to know how 'the saints' make love. Surely Mr. All- grace's pure mind never went beyond the purest Platonism. He, good man, sees in the sainted Dorothy, one of those angelic creatures whom  a brother saint cannot too soon appropriate. For, though not a flesh and blood angel her- self, she owns many bright gold angels., And, with such angelic charms, they Can take sweet counsel together, while she, Dorothy, never suffers her vestal lips to breathe, nor her pure bosom to feel any erratic desires."  He now stept behind a tree, while a few paces off were Allgrace and Doro- each holding to the hand of the other. Allgrace was speaking: "Sister Dorothy, I have made this matter the subject of prayer.  Ah! I know the sin of being unequally yoked together. Promise me then, soon as your brother and I   THE LOVERS.          183 shall free this vineyard of the Lord of its present prelatic pastor, and I shall be called of the Lord to go in and out among you, saying none other things than what the Spirit puts into my heart to say, that you will suffer me-"  Here the speaker spoke so low that Shepard could not hear him. The question must have been very pointed ahnd very lovingly put, for Dorothy was much flurried, the agitattn, doubtless, which the gentle breath of love had produced on the surface of a heart that rippled easier to its influence thaiF*water is stirred by a passing zephyr. In a tone of voice, soft as the cooing dove's, and with all the coyness, looking pale and crimson by turns, of a girl of sixteen, this maiden on the dark side of forty was just able to give her lover a dying look, and as  "Love is a figure Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat Dissolves," she fainted in his arms. "An armful of happiness," rnut tered Shepard, and, mounting his horse, he rode to St. Mary's. Montrose was asleep, and Shepard did not like to disturb him. On entering his room- Shepard found a letter, as he supposed, for himself, and did not see his mistake till he had read this first sentence: "Dear Delafield, or Montrose, as I suppose I must call- you, till the time fixed by your wager, shall have past." Hle dropt the letter, started up from his chair, and said, "Do I dream? What, Montrose Charles Delafield? He-  my brother! Heavens! I'll go and wake him, and take now that position in the world which my name would coni mand for me, which my father's fortune, being mine, would make comfortable, and which my acknowledged talents enable me to maintain." But here he was checked by the reflection that Montrose might doubt his statement, and impugn his motives. -He was known as Augustus Shepard, being so named in his maternal uncle Shepard's will. "This is strange!" -pursued he; "in a mad frolic I left col- lege, took shipping, and was wrecked on the coast of Spain, found there a ship bound to Hispaniola, reached that island, working my way as a common sailor, (being too proud and?  : ' anxious for adventures, to own my name and return toV  England;) I found in the island a ship bound to St. Mary's, where, I remembered, uncle resided. Harrived in St. Mary's, was owned by uncle Shepard, and promised him to take his   184       PILATE AND HEROD. name. Since then, years have past, alas! and now I find a brother, who, when I saw him last, was a curly headed boy. My sister I should not know. She was a bright and golden haired baby. If alive, she must be about the age of Mrs. Annie. No," checking himself, "zounds, it may be Miss Julia Holt. It is possible. I saw her for the first time'at the party at Pleasant Lodge, and took a fancy to her from the ballad which I learned some time before. Strange 1" and Shepard's mind seemed to wander.  "Strange! It may be Julia. I might have suspected it, if I had not been under an evil star, and my passion for Mrs. Annie had not driven all reflection out of my head, that it was Julia, for who else can it be?" And, in a low tone, talking by jerks, he continued, 'the impression was general that I was drowned. Perhaps better that I should have been, full five fathom deep," and he sighed heavily. "My father-he loved me though I knew it not-seemed harsh; he took on, for my death, and the hand of the angel of adversity was laid on him so heavily that he left homey and kindred to return no more. Perhaps, like ancient pilgrims, he has gone to the holy sepulchre, or, turning Roman devotee, has buried in a gloomy monastery his life and hopes. His body now may be worn to leanness under a hair shirt and severe fastings, and that head I loved to look upon, bald now pro- bably as was the first of the Caesars, is bowed in anguish to the dust. Curses light on me for my folly!" and Shepard seemed to suffer deeply. After awhile he continued, "Now, ! i myy brother, dear little Charlie, follows after a sort in my 'i-wayward steps. Lo! he doffs his name as I did-why, is a mystery, and I meet him here, and to-night, by a singular train of events, am led to find him out." After this long soliloquy, pacing up and down his room part of the time, and then stopping occasionally all at once, as if moved by a sudden impulse or thought, Shepard took the letter for Montrose which had brought so much light to him, and taking also the candle, he proceeded as quietly as he could, to the chamber of Montrose, He opened and closed the door gently. Montrose was sleeping soundly,  being doubtless overcome by the events which had past, and ?9 the excitement and physical effort he had gone through with. "If he be Charles," said Shepard, "I think I can discover some unforgotten feature of my brother." And he placed the light so that it would fall full upon his fatce, and thus l   SHEPARD'S SOLILOQUY.       185 enable him to scan the features of his supposed brother narrowly. He stood and gazed for nearly fifteen minutes, till his memory, pow prepared to see what it wanted, had traced in the manly features of Montrose a development of the delicate lineaments and peculiar mould and character of his broiber's face in boyhood. "Even so," said he, deeply moved. ' Then I am not alone in this wide, wide world. My heart may now expand, and take in others beside Mrs, Annie. v The world's cold- ness made it contract, and there- was but one warm .place in it, and this was made by her sunny glance,-but one spot where it was disposed to swell and grow; and thanks to her for the sun that warmed it into life, and the dew-drop of comfort that gave itiay vigour and size.."  The trunk. of Montrose was near. The key was in it. "I will open it," thought Shepard. "In it I may find further, conclusive proof of the fact I seek." Ie lifted the trunk,--and, on opening it, exclaimed, so loud as to nearly awake Montrose: "My mother's likeness! Oh what treasure! Golconda's mines would not buy it from me." And he kissed it rap- turously. "I can see that sweet smile now." He seated himself on the floor, --candle in hand, and, in his joy, -forgot that Montrose might wake up at any moment. "Ah! this, this is mine. Sooner will they tear my heart out than tear it from me." Hardly conscious of what he was doing, he jumped up, with the miniature in hand, threw the top of the trunk violently down, and the current of air made by which for- tunately blew out the candle, and, like one deranged, hurried out to his room. The noise awoke Montrose, who saw nothing, as it was very dark, and, it being still a; minute after, suspected nothing. Having reached his room, Shepard, such was his intensity of feeling, threw himself, without first undressing, on the bed, and before long fell asleep, lying on his. face, his right hand holding. with' a grip, which even slumber did not relax, to his mother's miniature. What mother is not, and if not, should not be a holy thing to her child? Hers is the first loved face that smiled upon us. Hers the first lips that soothed and sang to us. Her face, seen in the vista of the past, is the one sweet 16*   186    '   PILATE AND HTEROD. image there. Her voice, heard in its echoes, comes with the solemnity of cathedral music, and the sweet and ravishing tenderness of angelic harmonies. If mothers come back to look upon, perhaps, an erring child, may there not be such a support between the two, that the spirit of one can communicate with the other, and an influence for good be thereby exerted? On the Glebe farm, and about a quarter of a mile from the mansion, was a noble spring, called Poplar spring, ,which flowed in a stream quite large enough to have turned a common over-shot mill. Here, under the shade of a num- ber of tulipifera-poplars, whose blossoms were then just expanding, Emma was seated. The morning was balmy. A fine breeze played through the noble old trees, which were the growth of more than a century; and the feathered songsters were making themselves merry in the branches, and filling the air around with their songs. Emma was alone, and appeared to resign herself to the soothing influ- ences around. While thus absorbed, she beard the sound of a horse's hoofs, and, before she could rise and retreat by a private path along the creek side, Montrose was before her; and dismounting with all alacrity, in the true spirit and manner of an ancient knight, he threw himself'oh one knee, crossed ,his arms on his breast, and, in a most respectful tone, said:  "I wish not to intrude, but I may claim the right to be informed why I am charged with duplicity. Will Miss Gordoniexplain, and give me the chance of acquitting my- self?" "Do rise," said Emma, much agitated, " and you will greatly oblige me; and, if you can bear with me, let it suffice that I wholly recall it, and condemn myself for using it." "With pleasure," standing up, and laying his left hand on his horse, as if about to mount; " and I make now, Miss Emma, and will make hereafter, all due acknowledgments for your kind and prompt retraction. But is your will inexorable not to say why you charged me with duplicity?" and his lip trembled a little. "Perhaps I said or did something to justify/ it."' Emma looked puzzled, and looked down. She hesitated, coloured, was anxious to explain, but could not without mentioning her father's conversation about him at Elfin   MONTROSE AND EMMA.        187 Hall, and her discovery of Miss Evelin and Montrose at the spring of St. Mary's, under circumstances which seemed to show that, while avowing to Parson Gordon his love to her, he was paying his court to Miss Evelin; and this explana- tion would have been more than maiden modesty permitted. If he had declared his regard to her, before he had to her father, then her lips would have been unsealed. Emma struggled with the trials of her position, and, after an effort, said: "Will Mr. Montrose believe me, when I say I have done wrong,wrong,  rong, and am heartily sorry for it? .Will he be so kind also as to believe that I would explain  if I could?" "I certainly ask nothing further," he replied, " and trust at another time she will give me this explanation." 4 Emma felt, perhaps, even more embarrassed. She could not explain till he had addressed her, and she could not tell him she would explain when he had made this overture. She was uncomfortable, and signified by her manner that she wished to return to the house. "Excuse me," said he, touched by her manner. i I say no more on this subject. It is not your wish that I should come no more into your presence?" ' "Certainly not," was her reply. "Then," he continued, speaking with difficulty, " that presence I will not quit now, till you have allowed me to tell you what my lips would often have breathed, and my heart has long been full of." "Mr. Montrose," she interrupted him, " not a word more, if you please." "I understand you," changing his tone and manner as he spoke, and looking dejected. "I shot a man who sought to rob and shoot me. Yet it seems I have done-a deed so vile that the sentiments I was about to utter it does not become Miss Gordon to receive. My passion overshot my judg- ment. With your permission," increasing his speed to the house, "I will not longer intrude than is necessary." "Mr. Montrose, you do me great injustice. I have heard the circumstance under which this miserable man was shot, and am satisfied that no blame attaches to you for it." This assurance relieved him, but he judged it best, knowing her character, not to press the matter. As they drew near the   188       PILATE i AND HEROD. house Robin passed them, and Montrose, observing the angry scowl on McGregor's face, said to Emma: "Allow me to see if I can't make up with your body- guard. I fear he has not forgotten the blow, I gave him yesterday." Emma objected quickly, "No," but, before she had finished saying it, he called to McGregor in a loud and kind tone to come to him. The highlander hesitated, and then, after a pause, with much assured dignity, walked slowly towards Montrose, who asked him to be so kind as to take his horse, and ride round, and inquire into Redman's condition. He then gave Robin a silver piece with the re- mark. "Forgive me, man, for the blow of yesterday. You came so savagely at me, that I knew not what you meant to do. I had to defend myself." The Scotchman felt that the money in the palm of his hand was real silver, and his kindly feelings appeared to start from the palm, to which the money had given a pleasant glow, and next extended to his head, and showed a portion of its warmth in giving a more sunny expression to his face. His hard countenance softened, and holding tight to the money, and pressing it, to be sure there was no illusion; while a blush of shame and indignation, which was lighted by a ray of kindliness, passed over his face. "'Twas a smaw scart you gave me. An my leddy, Miss Emma were not by, an we had been alane, the southron would hae seen the bluid of the McGregor was not sae easily tamed." "Very like," said Montrose, observing that Robin's chief injury was mortified self-esteem. The latter was not gone more than an hour, before he returned with the report that Redman was not dangerously wounded as was believed; and he complained that Littleworth claimed the horse Selim, charged Robin with having stolen him, and Robin said that he and this red-haired fellow nearly came to blows. "The twa," he continued, "are cutlugged rogues. You did weel to shoot the cuddle." Emma complimented Robin on standing up so stoutly for Selim, and the Scotchman, between "the leddy's" praise, and "the siller," forgot the injury he had received. So easily at times are breaches healed, and the unforgiving Adam softened and pacified. Parson Gordon and Julia, having both gone to Pleasant Lodge, Montrose had the privilege of Emma's company to   MONTROSE'S DECLARATION.      189 himself. And, notwithstanding what had passed at the spring, he made the lover's staff his, and "managed it against despairing thoughts." Fr hope whispered its pleasing tale. Busy imagination began to build its airy and dazzling visions; in which a charming future opened before him. Fortune from her cornucopia seemed to shed upon him golden showers. He could hear fame's trumpet-blast, and could seepleasure strewing his path with roses; and in this picture Emma was both the maker and sharer of its bliss. "Facilis descensus averni," said Montrose. "Oh, how gently sloping would be the declivity to the end of life with such an angel along to smile away its gloom!"Emma her- self had to acknowledge mentally, that she had past a delightful day. When night approached, he determined to transgress again, be the forfeit what it might, trusting to extract something yet more explicit. But, after a fervent declaration, he could only extract, "Take a sister's love in return."  He mounted his fleet-footed Selim, waved his hand adieu, and was gone. Emma turned to go in, and there sat Adaratha the picture of hopelessness. What a miracle worker! and what a deranger is love! It unites together by moral affinity persons who would have moved indepen- !dent units of an inharmonious mass. When this moral affinity is wanting, wretched is that household where the heads are paired but not matched. And hardly less cheer- less are those who, unable to find a heart answering to theirs, feel that they are alone and uricared for in the great caravan of humanity, which is moving over life's desert to the Mecca, whither, in reality or fancy, all are bound. A few days afterwards, some time after dark, a vessel dropt anchor with sails half furled just off Chancellor's point, and about quarter of a mile from the tavern of the Free Briton. A boat made for the shore, and landing at the wharf where Father Hunter landed as mentioned in a former chapter, four men from the boat proceeded up the ascent to the tavern. "So you think," asked one in a nasal tone, " that the fellow is got to his room by now? He's the devil for fight, and 'less we pin him down at once, and gag him to boot, he'll spill blood to-night." "I should, judge that Mr. Montrose was both in his chamber and in bed by this time. He was up last night on   190        PILATE AND HEROD. a hunt, and I heard him say before sunset at the court house that he meant to retire early, and make up for lost time," was the reply of the person addressed. "But, Mr. 'Torney," continued the first speaker, "hadn't we better be sartain? You aint got on the track of the fel. low by a capy, and you mought miss him." "All wisely pondered, friend Snarler," was the reply. "We'll examine the coasts well. It might implicate us hereafter if we asked at the bar. You had better take these {i  sailors under your charge-;-and one by one, so as to avoid suspicion, enter the tavern by the back door. And do you see that window to .the water side, next to the corner up stairs? That is his room. He has gone to bed, for the light is out, and I would bet any thing he is sleeping soundly. You will have to proceed softly. Wait till all three are quietly in the room, then secure him, and, hur- rying out, meet me at the back door." "Ncoll will hear us, or some of his black scamps, friend Brief," replied Snarler. "I'll see to that," said Brief, "by going in first by the front door, and get them out of the way." Snarler did not seem yet satisfied, and suggested a doubt whether the' door of Montrose might not be locked inside. Brief laughed at the suggestion, and replied, that there was not a lock in the tavern that would not yield to a gentle pressure. The parties then separated, and proceeded as' Brief had advised.  The attorney saw   that Nicoll and the servants were out of the way, and, by a signal, made Snarler and the sailors understand it to be so; and the latter, hastening noiselessly up stairs, came to the room, which they opened without difficulty. On entering, they saw that the bed was occupied by a sleeper, whom they sprang :upon, and after a short scuffle, gagged and tied. They then hastened down stairs{ out of doors, where Brief expected them, next to the river side, and, depositing their comparatively unresisting burden on the boat, they hastily rowed to the vessel we mentioned. It was quite dark, and, to prevent detection, no lights were on the deck. They hoisted all sails, and, a smart breeze springing up, the vessel Ir   made good progress out of St. Mary's river. They then bore for Point Lookout, evidently anxious to reach the bay. They had hardly, however, passed St. Inigoes' forty than the   A MSTAKE.          191     : wind blew a fair storm. Snarler was at- the helm-and with an occasional curse at the seamen for their apparent slug-    ; gishness, gave his. orders. It was necessary to lay their   :! course for Sandy Point, on the Virginia shore, and the vessel, labouring under a heavy sea and squalls of wind that threatened occasionally to capsize her  f   -* ,her way. The vessel was evidently not very  Ili-  :id she     i readily obey her helmsman. The night/W:r darke, a:      a though a light now burnt at the binnacle, it showed them not whither they were bound, nor how far they were from Sandy Point. A fearful blast swept over themni-the vessel turned, with her masts nearly touching the water, on her   ! leeward side, every timber in her seemed to crack and open; a fearful wave dashed over them-a cry went up amidst the    d storm, and the ship's company gave themselves up as lost. The vessel, however, righted, and as she did so, she struck;  -X wave after wave swept the deck, washing the crew, Snarler,    and Brief overboard, and forcing the vessel more and more in shore. Morning came. The storm had abated. Brief, Snarler, and a sailor, the other probably being drowned,    i were busied putting the yawl boat in a condition to float, meaning to return to St. Mary's. The tide had greatly sub- sided, leaving the vessel well stranded on Sandy Point. The persons spoken of were on their return, making for Calvert's bay.  Snarler and Brief spoke but little; their ejaculations, however, expressed great disappointment. They had in- tended to have kidnapped Montrose, and, putting him on board a Spanish vessel that lay in Cornfield harbour-send him to old Spain; having, by an arrangement with the Spanish captain, guarded against his return to Maryland. Thus Snarler hoped to free himself from the claim of Mon- trose to the large body of land in his possession. Brief was to be paid handsomely for his counsel and assistance, and one condition of the payment was, that Snarler should, forever, relinquish to the Church of Rome, all right and title to St. Mary's grave-yard. , But Snarler and the sailors had kid-   X napped Darnell instead of Montrose. The latter, after     X dark, walked over to the castle, and Darnell, having drank ^. very freely that evening, had, with a drunkard's freedom, : found his way to the first room convenient, which proved to -' be Montrose's, and, asking no questions, soon fell asleep. , He was just sensible of the violence that was offered him. - *          ,        Hei   192       PILATE AND HEROD. He slept out the storm  in the cabin, and awaking up, managed to unbind his hands, and reach the deck and look out, recognise Brief and Snarler in the boat as they were returning to the Maryland shore. Darnell remembered his intemperance the previous evening, and, having had some pecuniary difficulty with Brief and Snarler, concluded that -they had had some agency in placing him in his singular position. How, or why, were, however, beyond his power to divine; for he knew nothing of the storm. With some difficulty, in the course of the day, Darnell reached the land safely, and by night a shelter in a fisherman's hut near Cone river. The next day he hired the fisherman to row him to St. Inigoes' Point, and he vented his indignation the while in vowing vengeance, on the first occasion, against Snarler and Brief.  db ,                         .   CHAPTER XXVI. ADVENTURES ON THE WAY TO ANNAPOLIS. "Conscience! did ye ever hear airry man talk of conscience in politi- cal matters . Conscience, quota, I hae been in parliament these three and thirty years, and never heard the term made use of before. Sir, it is an unparliamentary word, and ye wall be laughed at for it." THE MAN OF THE WORLD. WE must pass over a-few weeks. No one but Dr. John- son, and he only in the estimation of Boswell, was so impor- tant that every day of his life deserved to be chronicled. Montrose and Shepard started from St. Mary's for Annap- olis; the former to see and be seen, and the latter as a del- egate from Prince George county. They crossed the Patuxent river at Point Patience, and, travelling on horseback, took the Bay-side road. On the first day they dined at St. Leonard's. Their road was in sight of the Chesapeake nearly all the way, and in Calvert county it wassandy, and presented an uneven country of hill and dale. Dense for- ests, with cabins at long intervals, showed a thinly peopled country; while the abundance of game, the heavy timber on the road, and the noble bay in sight, satisfied them that few places which they had seen were more tempting to the set- tler, or would better repay his industry. The first night they intended to put up at the house of one of the members from that county, who was an acquaintance of Shepard,; but as night drew on, by some oversight they turned t6o much to the left, and got out of the road. Shepard first discovered the mistake, and remarked to his friend that he saw no longer the two notches on each side of the road; an act of Assembly of four years before requiring them on all roads leading to a ferry, court-house or church. "Perhaps," said Montrose, "the road leads, notwith- standing, to Annapolis." "No, this cannot be," was Shepard's rAply, " for the road to the seat of government is also marked with two notches each side, and when it leaves a fork it is distinguished from VOL. in.-17                (193)   194       PILATE' AND HEROD. the fork by having A. A. marked with'-marking irons and coloured on the face of one or more trees, where the govern- ment road leaves the fork. These notches I do not see, and the A. A. 1 did not look for just now at a fork we passed; you and I being too intent on the traits of personal loveliness 9f Mrs. Annie and Miss Emma, to look away from them right or left to see branded trees." "What shall we do then?" "Bivouac perhaps here in this 'boundless contiguity of. shade,' and to-morrow, when it is light, bear to the right till we come in sight of the bay, and near by we shall find the road to Annapolis." "We had best stop then where we are, for my horse mires occasionally, and it is getting dark so fast, and the road is so obscure that we may ride into a creek before we know it." Shepard halted, persuaded that his friend was more than half right, and the two stood awhile, looking carefully around to see if they could discern a light, or hear any noise which would indicate a human habitation to be near. Montrose first broke silence, exclaiming that he saw a light a little to the right, and about half a mile off. Could they get to it was the next question. The horse of Mon- trose stood, as we stated, on miry ground, and whether the ground to the right or left, or just ahead, was firm, was a doubt theycould not resolve. Shepard was a little in the rear, and where he stood the ground was move firm. "Sir Knight," said Shepard, "move on, or say so, and I'll beat a retreat," A retreat was beaten for a few yards,/ and the two then made directly for the light. They had got out of even the cow-path, which they were in a few minutes before, and were now in a dark, and for aught they knew to the contrary, almost boundless forest. They were obliged to move slowly and cautiously, still they flattered themselves they were making headway towards the light.  All at once Shepard found himself brought forcibly against a tree, and his horse moving quickly from under him, he fell to the ground. Montrose was a little off to the right, and. had just discovered his friend's disaster, when his horse halted ab- ruptly, and refused to advance, as Shepard's horse plunging down a hill, attempted to cross a stream at the bottom. If he could have thought a moment he would have turned back to his friend's assistance but unconsciously using his qpurs,   A BOG TROTTER.         195 he forced his horse down the ravine, and Montrose could not stop him, nor collect himself till he stood at the-edge of the stream, which was seemingly deep, and about twenty or more yards wide. Here, he dismounted, hearing Shepard bawling lustily after him. The latter found his way to him, and was more concerned about losing his horse than of the fall. They found that at that spot they could not cross, and they walked on the stream side some yards up, where, finding it very much narrowed, and there spanned by some trees which, at this spot, had been purposely felled, they crossed over, and Montrose, having trained his horse to follow his call, got him to swim the stream. The two friends'having crossed on foot, (Montrose holding on to Selim,) made for the light, and up to which they came now without further serious dif- ficulty. They saw a hut near the mouth of Parker's creek. The proprietor, having heard the tramp of Shepard's horse coming to the house, came out and easily caught him. He was a genuine Teague, with a red face, broad and strong limbed, hair between red and sandy, very bushy, and stand- ing out like porcupine's quills. He received them as cour. teously as he knew how, and, asking them in, took their horses to a shed near by. "This bog trotter," said Shepard, " carries the Milesian in his face, and shows it in his house. Here are two holes made for windows--and disdaining glass, or shutters, the lazy loon has stuffed in the dirty fragments of his unseemly garments. :Remembering that dust we are, and to dust we will return, there is enough manure on his floor to make a small crop of potatoes; and the smoke from his chimney, in-place of as- cending right upward by the vent or opening,-searches with its sooty intrusion every part of the room. Really Montrose, we should have had agreeable quarters at the members;--but I have scruples about loitering here; yes, though father Canon says scruples, many only make' one drachm; yet I think they weigh down drachms when filth is to be swallowed with them;" and Shepard pointed also to a muck heap just at the door, "whose steam," he said, "the bog trotter wahted to come in with the morning air as a quickener to his appetite." His friend laughed, and told him he had not seen all yet:-being much amused at the annoy- ance which these things gave to Shepard; whose equipments were fine and costly, and in danger of being rendered unfit for service.   196       PILATE AND HEROD. "You have not felt all either, Shepard, for it seems to me, that fleas and vermin are making my body a bleeding carcase; while Mr. Grunter yonder," pointing to a pig that was coming from under the Irishman's bed, " bears about him whole colonies of these jumping gentry, to supply us iwith a further stock, if we have not enough." "'Tis past endurance," said Shepard; and they bolted out of the house, and after sauntering about for some time, they came to a fodder stack, and thinking this the best suited for sleeping accommodations, they returned to the hut to see what chance there might be for supper. And this they were resolved to have, even should the Irishman be obliged to kill his pig to give it to them. 3But there was no scarcity of what was better,--fine fish, and oysters. Except then, an occasional shrug, and his highly perfumed handkerchief to his nose, Shepard contrived both to eat and enjoy his sup- per. After supper they declined the Irishman's loft, which he offered them, after their refusal to share his only room below stairs, with his ".slip of a pig," withdrew to the fod- der stack, where, free from fleas, they hoped to pass the night. They had not been there long before they heard ad- vancing footsteps, and some voices as in conversation. A strange place and time they thought to play the eaves-drop: per. The persons referred to approached till they came near enough to the fodder stack for Shepard and Montrose to see and hear them. "That is Father Hunter," said Shepard, putting his lips close to the ear of Montrose, and that fellow, who is unper- riwigged, unruffled, and wears no sword, speaks for him- self." "Yes, a quaker-a the; and thou fellow. I have heard and seen the like of him lbefore. I heard one of them hold forth not far from Oxford. He denounced the sacraments,-- oaths in court,-a regular ministry, and tithes,-and claimed ) that the true peace and conquest over sin could be had with- out them; attempting to clinch every thing by the text, 'the grace of God, which bringeth:salvation, hath appeared unto all men.' He has the divine light then," said Shepard, ironically; "you and I, Montrose, learned nothing at school comparable to what this solemn simplicity catches' by a sort of infusion from the clouds, whenever he rolls his eyes upward. You have heard, Montrose, that Mary Fisher and her female as-   FATHER HUNTER AND TOBIAS.       197 sociate, were the first who preached Quakerism in America, and that they were examined by the Solomons of Boston to see if they were witches ;" and Shepard was running on in a vein of irony, when Montrose checked him; and they heard Father Hunter tell the Quaker that they would have no peace till the crown and people were informed how unjustly they were all taxed for the benefit of the parsons. to this the Quaker assented.* "TWe thank you, friend Tobias," said the Jesuit. "St. Peter was commanded to put up his sword, and Holy Church draws not the sword against her firm friends, the followers of Fox. But can we count on your friends voting for this bill against the parsons? No measure,-friend, will so soon cut at the root of that unwholesome tyranny which now over- shadoweth us. We must make the parsons amenable to a lay tribunal, which the assembly shall appoint. Your friends and ours will have a voice in that Assembly, and, by unit- ing with the Presbyterians, Nonconformists, and disaffected churchmen, a controlling voice. With a little management we can carry the measure, put our friends in the court, and thus keep the parsons so in check that their tobacco tax, their religious privileges, and their church establishment, will be a name; monstrous in tyranny and injustice in conception, but harmless and ridiculous in operation. Our management and address will take out the fang of the serpent. But then, friend Tobias, can we depend on you and yours?" "I tell thee, friend Hunter," said Tobias very solemnly, "that, as thee for years past has found us friends to thee and thine, thee will find us so again." Tobias knew what he said. Quaker and Romanist have generally stood shoulder to shoulder against Churchmen, Presbyterians, and Dissenters. James II., the bigoted Roman Catholic sovereign of England, little more than twenty years before the date of our narrative, found an actual luxury in witnessing the agonies of the poor Covenanters in the Scotch torture of the boots, and coolly ordered young girls in Scot- land to be drowned for refusing to disown the Covenanter's faith: yet he ever welcomed the Quaker Penn at Whitehall,. and allowed the Quakers to assemble for worship.  He * Dr. Hawks, p. s8 of his work before quoted, speaks of ' the vio- lent opposition," the church met with from the Romanists and Qualers, p and adds that " the Roman Catholics for the most part acted through the medium of the Quakers." 17*   1u  ( I \   PILATE AND HEROD. attempted to crush the freedom of the Church of England, and made Ear upon it in every form that he thought the church wia most vulnerable, and forbade the Presbyterians to meet #jther in conventicles, or " in a barn or outhouse" for worship; yet he was pleased that Roman priests might say mass in all places, and that Quakers might harangue wherever itfc was convenient. And Quakers and Romanists stood together in Maryland, and what was more, they had managed to connect with them in alliance, Presbyterians, Independents, Nonconformists, and Low Churchmen, the last being by name, as was said before, a new phase of religionists. Herod and Pilate were leagued together against Christ, and our Lord prophesied, as they did unto Him they would do unto the members of His household. The Church of England then was receiving but what had been foretold. "What votes do you think you can control?" asked the priest; and, while the Quaker was pondering on whom he could rely, he and Father Hunter walked away. "A queer alliance this," said Montrose. "The Quaker contends for a divine light within, and complains that the Church of England dims it, because the church seeks to kindle it afresh, and make it burn- steadily and purely by the torch of ancient truth; yet the Quaker allies himself to Rome, who would extinguish both the light of revelation and of nature." "A true bill this," replied Shepard, thoughtfully. Our travellers resumed their journey next day, and at night came to a house on South river, where passengers crossed over. Here they found a tavern, and were accosted by a cream visaged landlord, who at first eyed them as if they were horse thieves; till, recognizing Shepard, his face softened into a smile. "Sorry chance to-night, sir," said Boniface. "Every thing like a bed or pallet is engaged." On hearing this Montrose proposed pushing on to Anna- polis, but Shepard insisted on waiting awhile. The publi-  can then mentioned that there were a dozen members of the assembly in the house, who had been drinking hard and betting high. "What brings them here?" asked Montrose. "The game which abounds in these rivers," replied Shepard; ' and, getting drunk, they are game for each other over the card-tables; and, in the midst of their debauch and   TRAP TO CATCH PARSONS.       199 profanity, concoct by spirituous steaming those legislative dishes, which the gullible public are to digest. Thus, while offending all morals, and themselves the proper subjects of the law against nuisances, they make laws to keep in order the more sober community, and even pass those which are to regulate their morals." "What bone of a bill are they mangling?" asked Shep- ard of Proctor, the landlord. "That called the trap to catch the parsons," replied Proctor. "There'll be no end to wonders," said Montrose. "These lewd fellows profess to be shocked at. the immorality of the parsons, and yet there's not one, it seems, who 's not now doing more iniquity than any, which, far as I can hear, they even pretend to charge the parsons with." "All in character," said Shepard, laughing. "You know what Butler says; 'For to prohibit and dispense, To find out, or to make offence, To set what characters they please, And mulct on sin, or godliness, Must prove a pretty thriving trade. You know we law-makers are some bodies in the people's opinion, when the clergy are to be taught how to walk by us: as to the law-makers themselves, why they may walk as they please. What have they to do with morality? Why, provided they can keep the clergy in a straight jacket, they themselves may break loose on the community like so many raving lunatics. The devil was not punished for eating the forbidden fruit, but, what was better, he had the punishing of Adam and Eve who did."  "I am glad to hear you discourse so clerk-like," said Montrose, smiling. "Behold! all at once, the exquisite has become a politician." Shepard looked grave, and replied. "Youn observed I was exceedingly annoyed by the fleas and filth in the Irish- man's hut. Well, because I was where grunters and fleas had no right to come, if I had disputed the sty with the pig, and his filth, and fleas had routed me, I should say it was all fair; being out of my place. What presumption is -it in men to set up for legislators, who cannot distinguish between the common and statutory law! Who so ridiculous and absurd as puritans! They have a coat clerical which   zUUV      PIILA'l'T ANJ HiEROD. somebody found in the wardrobe of Calvin; and they must needs put it on every clergyman: and, if it is too small for any, they say, the fault is not the coat's, but his whom it won't fit. Verily his fleshy-mindedness has puffed him too much for it to button around him. If, however, as there are clergymen of all capacities theological, the poor parson should be too smallfor Calvin's old coat, why then, forsooth, he needs puffing up. They say he is lifeless, and ask, can these dry bones live? And then they raise a hue and cry, that such a parson has the form of godliness, but not the power thereof." "Here comes one," interrupted Montrose, "who was made for Calvin's coat," and he pointed to the Rev. Mr. Allgrace, who was advancing towards them, accompanied by Doolittle. The publican met them at the door, and the friends were amused on seeing how Proctor's whole manner changed; his face resuming its former rigidity and hardness; looking as hard as the bark on he north side of a pine tree; and from his very pious expression of countenance, one would have said, Proctor, unlike any other Boniface, had never heard an oath, nor seen a drunken riot. "Who have you here, Brother Proctor?" asked All- grace. Speaking in a low tone, and with a knowing wink, Proctor replied, "Sure, and who but members of the honourable assembly, my worthy brother?" Ah! indeed! this is news," said Allgrace; and, after hesitating a moment, continued, "Hark ye, Brother Doo- little, here's a fine chance of pushing this moral bill. We must talk to these members, and, by the holiest considera- tions, urge them not to lose this blessed occasion of cleans- ing and purifying the sons of Levi. Are any of the godly among them?" speaking to Proctor. "I can't say any have been regenerated," was the reply, "but talk low," pointingto Shepard and Montrose. "Good," continued Allgrace, not understanding the hint, and feeling in the mood for sermonizing. "Now, provided, I say, Brother Proctor-ah! that's the main thing, pro- vided, I say, there be in them this encouraging sign of a righteous disposition; and every godly man would have it- I mean the wish to pass so righteous a bill; though the out- ward man doth offend occasionally, which is the case, you know, I suppose it may be said of them as Paul did of   DIALOGUE.         201 himself, 'To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not.' They have not yet found- their time by election not being come, and all they want is godly men--such men as will 'blow the trumpet loud and clear in the pulpits, and rebuke the iniquity which is abroad-and great! great is it, brother." "Yes, that is all," said Shepard to Montrose; who, sit- ting together in the dark, were not seen by Allgrace and Doolittle. "But, how happens it, that, where two such pulpit trumpet blasters are, there iniquity most abounds? One would have supposed that the din and clatter they made, would have sent old Satan howling to hide himself among the papists in St. Mary's; or, perhaps among the prelatists in Jamestown." Is there any leading member among them?" continued Allgrace. "There is one," said mine host, " of great influence, and he's resolved to lay this trap, and snare the parsons." "I'd like much, Brother Proctor, to see this worthy member. It beseemeth that the word of exhortation, if spoken to him by me, would be a word in season." "I fear," said Proctor, laying his hand-on Allgrace, who was in the act of entering the room, -; that--that-that his flesh hath the better of his spirit to-night," meaning he was drunk, "but I'll tell him you are here." "I could laugh at what I see," said Montrose to Shepard, "if I did not see in the movement now going on an attempt to bring sorrow and poverty to the houses of the good and earnest clergy in the province. It is provok- ing that such beasts as these law-makers, and such foxes as Father Hunter and Friend Tpbias, and such a nondescript as this whitewashed puritan, should have it in their power to get up a clamour against the best men in the province, and ruin them and their families. How unlike," continued Montrose, "that beautiful bay yonder!" pointing to the bay, on which the rising moon threw its beams, "is the heart of man! There its bosom reflects light only, but man's bosom seems disturbed, dark, and' at times repulsive." "True," replied Shepard. "Even so, friend Montrose, but, like that bay, which, under a shining surface hides the shark, and other monsters of the deep; so does man's heart, under a fair outside, and a face dressed to deceive, and under promises and speeches, (as you will find one day, what I   202       PILATE- AND HEROD. know,) made only for the ear; hide tempers that are more merciless than the shark; and propensities more- hideous than the slimy snake and scaly monsters who crawl out from their oozy bed." We stated that Allgrace wished to see the influential member. The innkeeper went in, and whispered to the latter, whose name was Whitter, that the pious Mr. Allgrace wished to see him. "Allgrease," asked one of the members, hearing the name incorrectly, " what does the crop-eared fellow want V" "Mr. Allgrace," replied mine host, raising his voice, i " wishes to see Mr. Whitter." Now Whitter had lost more money than he could conveniently spare, and' he was out of humour, and being, besides, under spirituous excitement, felt quarrelsome. He forgot, also, that Proctor had said, it was the pious Mr. Allgrace, and his dignity, as the leader of a party in the assembly, was offended, that an obscure indi- vidual, whom he had' never heard of, instead of waiting upon him, should ask him to get up, and go out to receive him. ' I move, gentlemen," said Whitter, with much assumed dignity, "that the sergeant-at-arms bring before Cur honour- able body the puppy who has insulted one of its members, and the body itself." N\ PC"I second that motion, by the - --," said a member present, rising with difficulty, "and I, yes, sergeant-at- arms, will have him here in no time," stammering as he spoke. There was now an uproar. All were ambitious to be sergeant-at-arms, and under the maddening influence of drink, "I'll go-r ill go,"-burst from many lips. Over went the table. Down rolled and. smashed the bottles and tankard, and tumblers. Away flew the cards, and mine host, losing thought, for the moment, of his friends All- grace and Doolittle, (after whom he would have looked if he had been half as pious as he professed to be,) was so con- siderate, in the meanwhile, as to pocket the gold and silver pieces, which were scattered about the floor; being the amount on the table which the gamblers had staked. Some of the members, after staggering to the door, fell out. Others, mistaking the back door, for the front one, went- round the house, bawling, "Where is he?" While   ALLGRACE PURSUED.         203 about half of them, with Whitter at their head, came in a body to the front door. "Where is the beggarly Mr.. Greasy?" said Whitter, his fists clenched as he spoke. "Is it you?" looking hard and fiercely at Shepard, who. stood just outside with Mon- trose. "Me?" asked- Shepard, in a clear, ringing tone, stepping into the light, so as to bring his person distinctly into view. "Who dares to say I am  beggarly? or aught but what is honourable?" and changing his tone to one of grateful sur- prise, "Why, friend Whitter, this is an   unexpected pleasure.  And you, worthy friends, I greet you all a cor- dial welcome," extending his hand to each one by turns, and which was kindly and cordially received. 4' We want a crop-eared Mr. Greasy," replied Whitter. "( He can't be either an acquaintance of yours, or mine," said Shepard, slightly smiling.  "You and I keep better company. Perhaps you want a reverend Mr. Allgrace'? He is tripping it yonder, like frightened deer before the lhounds," pointing to Allgrace, who, as usual when in com- pany with Doolittle, headed the retreat as well as the charge. They took the alarm,--were making for the stable, and intended to get their horses, and push on to Annapolis. Whitter and his five half drunken allies raised- the hue and cry, "Catch him, catch him," and hurried in pursuit. Montrose and Shepard, laughing heartily, followed after. "The first act of the drama," said Shepard, half se- riously, "'the Bill to Trap the Parsons,' closes with the falling of 'the godly' Mr. Allgrace into the snare he had prepared for others." Doolittle and  Allgrace,- nearly breathless from  fear, arrived at the stable, and without examining whether they had their own horses, (for the business was too urgent to be choice,) mounted, and were riding off, just as Whitter and his confederates gained the gate of the stable-yard. 'The situation of the pursued was critical, but not desperate. Men of tact would have held a parley with the pursuers, and might have come off on easy terms. Brave men, finding half a dozen men at the gate cutting off their retreat, would either have leaped the fence, or forced their way through their assailants. But Doolittle was a nose of wax, and All- grace, like a  certain long-eared animal, could only make a   204    I   PILATE AND HEROD. noise. The horse on which Doolittle was mounted, was an unmanageable beast, which one\ of the members had rode there, and, being frightened by the clamour, findirng the gate closed, he went over it. Recovering himself, the horse ran towards the ferry; and, instead of taking the firm but circuitous road, the wilful beast pushed hard for the ferry through the woods, and next an intervening morass. And such was the furiousness with which he ran, that the arch- fiend seemed to be verily a horse saddled and bridled, and he, Doolittle, as verily mounted upon him. One plunge more, however, and the horse anchored himself, and perhaps - the rider, for the night at least, in the mire. Allgrace's horse was not even inclined so to move, but began to back and kick; though the rider, in his anxiety to clear himself, seemed willing to leap the gate, or do any thing. Allgrace was scared as he had never been before; and, as they were  i  climbing over the gate, and would soon take hold of him, his friend Doolittle not being at hand to help, (" so tried," said he, " are the saints,") Allgrace kicked the horse and struck him with the bridle, sweating profusely and trembling in his seat all the time. But the contrary animal backed and backed, where Allgrace could not tell; and then, rearing up, threw Allgrace into a- horse-pond, (thinking, it seemed, he needed a cleansing). Now into this pond flowed the washings of the yard and stable. Doolittle's leap and his Gilpin race were seen in part, and a shout was sent after him, Whitter remarking at the time, "He's on the devil-horse I hired/" But when they saw Allgrace's mishap, heard the splash into the water,-not only a shout, ,but a hurrah of exulta- tion went up; and Allgrace, soaking with his unfragrant wetting, had partially risen, when three or four men laid hold upon him, and, in despite of his most moving expostu- lations, would have handled him unmercifully, had not Montrose and Shepard interfered. But Whitter and his confederates still insisted that Allgrace should return to the tavern, make a formal apology before- their honourable body, and then submit to such punishment as they should inflict. Trembling and cast down, Allgrace' walked with 'head lowly stooped, between Shepard and Montrose,-his body guard,-feeling more like a culprit about to undergo a dreadful sentence, than as- the pious Mr. Allgrace, who was   ALLGRACE'S ESCAPE.        205 about to exercise his gifts, and, by a word spoken in season, as he himself was foul as muck-water, feelingly remind the law makers how they might "' purify the sons of Levi." On the way Montrose whispered to Shepard: ,, They will kill this poor simpleton. We are more than a match for these drunken fellows, though six to two." Shepard smiled incredulously. ," Take care. ! These men have just liquor enough to be ready for a fight. If you will be Don Quixote, I, Sancho, will retreat. But wait awhile. A thorough scare will help the puritan." At this moment a strong blaze of light burst upon ~them, and the tavern was seen to be on fire. Allgrace was, of course, forgotten in the confusion that ensued; and, white all hastened to the place of conflagration, Allgrace ran back to the stable, led out his own beast, and Doolittle's, which he bridled and saddled, and mounting on the first, and leading the other, pursued his way to the ferry; happy to escape the clutches of the very men whose righteous dispo- sitions he had a few minutes before commended. He would not now have said, as he did then, that they transgressed only because how to perform that which was good was not always present with them.    Their drunkenness he thought very, very pardonable if they were plotting the injury of the parsons, but it was ,heinous when it led them, to seek his injury. Self-interest is a sad perverter of truth. Boniface Proctor secured all he could of his property from the raging element. The members arrived in time to rescue two    of their number from   the  flames, who  were sleeping unconsciously just inside the door. Shepard and Montrose, not caring     to sleep out of doors again, rode towards the ferry over the South river. On their way they descried Doolittle so surrounded by the tide that he must spend the night there. :  Allgrace they passed on the causeway. He said he was much concerned for Doo- little, and that the conflagration was a  signal miracle which Providence, in witness of his righteousness, wrought for his deliverance;    forgetting  in this remark, that Providence would have been mudh more apt to have interfered by soften- ing the hearts of those wicked men, than by destroying the property of one of " the godly," as he, Allgrace, considered Proctor to be.   He  next signified, as the first wish now with him, to cross over with them;    observing that "some. VOL. I.--18  WOu       PILATE AND HEROD. body on the morrow will probably take care of Brother Doo. little; surely they will." "No," said Montrose indignantly; "if you are so base as to attempt to cross, and leave this poor man, your friend, to his fate in the marsh, I'll make you and your horse take to the river." "'I would come by all means, Mr. Allgrace," said Shepard. "Brother Doolittle dying here in the marsh; sister Dorothy will have a snug property, and becoming then Dorothy All. grace, you will have such creature comforts as will enable you to practice denials, and eschew all fleshy vanities, after taking possession of the vineyard of the Lordin St. Mary's." Allgrace hung his head, guilty and vexed, and the friends observed, (for the moon shone brightly,) that this sorry specimen of a pastor of Christ's flock turned very pale. But he did not move, and as they were crossing the ferry, they saw him still sitting on his horse, and here they left him; and may every other wolf in sheep's clothing, like Allgrace, stand on a causeway which a full tide surrounds, and a deep river in front forbids to pass; and let such know that, surer than any flood-tide, God's wrath will overwhelm him, who, harnessed in the ministry of Christ, fears to stand his ground; and let such further know that the Mussulman can more easily walk over the gossamer bridge, that spans the river of hell; and Allgraoe can more easily ford a deep and danger- ois river, than an ambassador of Christ can pass to "the haven where he would be," either by cheapening the word of God, lowering its terms, or omitting, in deference to " the multitude who run to evil," "to declare the whole counsel of God." Late that night our friends reached Annapolis, and a few days thereafter they talked of their plans for the future. "Without Mrs. Annie," said Montrose, "you will soon tire of salarying barbers to dress your beard and cue, and blackies to dust your hose and doublet. This hey-deyness 6f youth, that bubbles over the cup of life, is all froth; the effervescence of animal spirit, which will leave in the bottom discontent and weariness. Without her you will soon be sick of strutting about in St. Mary's and Annapolis, with hands under your lappels." Death, man," said Shepard, starting up, "what mean you? to drive me mad? No, rather let my carcase fly on the top of the old State House, the food of buzzards, and my ,  .   ALLGRACE A GAIN.       207 anatomy swing there in the wind; a fitsymbol of the ancient city. This must not be. She must be mine No, Charles." Montrose started, and standing' as he spoke, Shepard straightenedhis tall and athletic person; while 'his voice became solemn, of a heavy base "No. I am sick of this eternal bubbling over of mere froth. I am sick of seem- ing to be the mere foam that dances on the wave. I am sick of keeping barbers and valets to take care of my outer man; when my inner man is worth but little. Talk not to me of weariness and discontent at the bottom of the cup; if in that cup I see not the face of Annie smiling upon me; if I gather not around me once more, a portion at least, of those who stood with me by my father's hearthstone; then- will I fill that cup, and drink it dry with a poison, whose single drop will send Augustus Shepard to the land of shades." "At the bottom of that cup you will see more than Mrs. Annie' smiling, if you'll follow the course pointed out to you by Providence," was the reply from an unknown person, and quarter, which immediately followed upon Shepard's remark. The tone of voice, though just loud enough to be heard, was remarkably distinct. Shepard trembled, and looked at Montrose for an explanation; and the latter, no less amazed, looked round the room, as if the unknown speaker might be concealed in it. "I'll find out the ghost," said Shepard with passion, "and make him know he's no wizard after all." "Come, come,--this is some foolery," said Montrose, trying to detain him, "not worth the investigation." But, without waiting to say good night, Shepard hurried out. As he went out, Shepard proceeded hastily to the room adjoining that of Montrose, and to the right of it. The door was fastened. He knocked, no one offered to open it, and, being confident that the voice he heard came from that room, he was incensed at the attempt of the inmate to play upon his fears or credulity, and assaulting the door vehe- mently with a kick'he forced it open. Judge his amazement on entering to find the Reverend Mr. Allgrace, not at his devotions, good reader, nor, as King David advised, ex- ercising himself reading in the law of God at night, but sit- ting beside the landlady of the hotel with her hand in his; and saying things which Shepard knew were not meant for      .A   208' PILATE AND HEROD. his ear. At any other time Shepard would have greatly re- lished the discovery. -The person, whose voice he heard was not in, this room, and, muttering a half .apology for in- truding on so tender a scene, Shepard retired. "The saint and our hostess," he said to himself, "must have been deeply, absorbed not to have heard me at the -door, or perhaps the noises in this house deceived them as well as myself." What were their feelings armazement and conduct on Shepard's intrusion, we are not infimed. ' I am not to be thus baffled," said Shepard, and he stopt, and asked himself, where else could the voice have proceeded. He then remembered that the room of Mr. Montrose ad- joined also one to the left of it; and that the partition be- tween the two rooms was not plastered, but merely boarded; and through such a partition he knew sound would easily travel. It must be this room to the left, and thus concluding, he lost no time in pushing his inqury. He knocked and the door opened. Shepard started back, and was both discon- certed and disappointed wheni Mr. Delafield presented him. self. Shepard had not been let into the secret that Mon- trose's strange friend was his father; circumstances probably having prevented this communication from Montrose. "Mr. Shepard," said Mr. Delafield, rising, and speaking with a little effort. Shepard bowed, and was in the act of withdrawing, saying to himself, "I must be mistaken again," but Mr. Delafield motioned to him to be seated, and shut the door. Shepard, without knowing exactly why, obeyed, and unconsciously his thoughts wandered away from the purpose which had brought him to the room; for there was a certain something in the stranger before him, his voice, his manner, his face, his features, all, that awoke feelings, which he could neither understand nor describe. Still this certain some- thing, which was nothing else but an association with the past, that thb stranger's manner, voice, and, appearance called up, did not suggest to Shepard the shadow of the thought that before' him stood his father. Shepard, there- fore, with this strange association rivetting him to his seat, looked at the- stranger, and asked himself "What can he want with me?" "I have understood," said Mr. Delafield, a that the late Mr. Shepard of St. Mary's was your uncle. You were his nephew by your father, John Shepard, his brother, I sup- pose?" 'r    DELAFIELD AND SHEPARD.       209 "My father was not named Shepard," Shepard was about to say; but contented himself with rather asking a question than replying to. that which was put to him. "( You knew my uncle, I infer, then?" "I did," replied Mr. Delafield, "and would that I had known less of him; for, connected as we were, it was painful to vary so diametrically as we did from each other." "Connected with my uncle!" said Shepard, looking sur- prised, "Pray how?" and he gazed intently on Mr. Dela- field, as if, by close inspection of him, he would find out for himself. "We were children of the same mother, but of different fathers," said Mr., Delafield, 'and I presume you must have heard him speak of me. But it matters not-" and he paused awhile as if he waited for breath, or resolution to go on. "You have not been a father, Mr. Shepard, and know not a father's anxiety even to wretchedness about his chil- dren; and especially cannot know what I must have suf- fered when, besides losing my wife, I had to nmourn over the hasty departure, never more to return to the domestic hearth, of my eldest son." Shepard started, and he muttered to himself," Strange his son was as wilful and as wicked as I have been. But you have not told me," added Shepard, " how you are connected with my uncle." a True!" replied Mr. Delafield, {' not exactly; for I had a uterine brother, who was connected to your uncle as I was, but he is dead;' and Mr. Delafield was in the act of saying, for the thought was trembling for utterance on his lips, " and you have not told me how the late Mr. Shepard of St. Ma- ry's was your uncle," when Shepard, catching at Mr. Dela- field's last explanation, and connecting it with his former remark that he had to mourn the hasty departure of his son from home, besides the death of his wife, felt himself over- come by feelings he wished to give expression to, but which almost deprived him of speech. He was only able to ask, "Did any domestic difficulty drive that son from home?" "None that I know of," replied Mr. Delafield, answer- ing with emotion, and then- checking himself, he continued. "Perhaps he had; I may' have been stern.; I may have given him cause to complain; I may have allowed a father's fondness to sleep in my endeavour to maintain a father's authority. Still, still, I meant his good," and choking as 18*   *tisu    PILATE AND HEROD. he spoke, "I surely meant not to have driven him from his father's fire-side," and like a child Mr. Delafield wept. "Would you know that son again?'"Shepard trembled to ask him, and this man of the world, whose nerves seemed' generally to be iron, and whose resolution uniformly carried him right onward to his object, faltered; the words would not pass his lips; but he gazed intently and fixedly on Mr. Delafield for some minutes; and by this time, and not till then, did he command himself sufficiently to ask the question: "Would I know my son again? Could a father forget his child? A nursing mother may not hers. Perhaps fathers have not the hearts of mothers. But I ought to know my boy, my son, my own absent, ill-treated, but ever- mourned and deeply and truly loved, as this poor anguish- ' wrung heart can love; my own Augustus," and he clasped his hands in agony. "Then, then bless him and forgive him," said Shepard, falling at his feet. "I am I was this Augustus." Mr. Delafield started, breathed quick and hard, and the first idea with him was that Shepard was imposing upon him, the next thought was, this news is too good to be true, and the last was an effort to collect his thoughts, and know what he was doing, Shepard still kneeling. "My Augustus," he continued, as if talking to himself, "ought to be tall and spare, muscular and not fleshy. His hair was dark, his eyes deep set, his lip his mother's, and his forehead hers exactly." "Like this," said Shepard, producing his mothers minia- ture. "My Julia! ahI how   came this? It is-no-yes. I cannot dream. Like, very, very. It is my son, and I, I am his father," and Mr. Delafield threw his arms about him and cried like a child. It was late in the night when Shepard returned to his room, and we must leave untold the much that passed be- tween father and son in explanation of the past, and let our readers imagine how differently Shepard felt from what he had done hitherto. Suffice it to say, that Mr. Delafield was much worked upon by the shock which he had received, while Shepard-though much younger, being more taught to school his feelings, and being, in a measure, assisted in this endeavour by the circumstances which occurred in the in- terimt and which we propose to relate in' the next chapter- '4   A MYSTERY.         2" was able to act outwardly to Montrose and others as if nothing had happened. Our readers hardly need to be informed that the- voice which Shepard had heard did not come from Mr. Delafield;, and hence, whence came it, must still be a mystery which time may solve. 4.                        . \    CHAPTER XXVII. ANNAPOLIS--GOVERNrOR SEYOUR---FENDALL. "When you get to a glorified flunkey in. lace, plush, and aiguillettes, wearing a bouquet that nobody wears, a powdered head that nobody wears, a gilt socked hat only fit for a baboon--I say the well constituted man can't help grinning at this foolish, monstrous, useless, shameful caricature of a man which Snobbishness has set up to worship it." THRACKERAY. ON a neck of land which is formed by Acton's Creek on the south, and Covey's Creek on the north, and on the southern side of the river Severn at its mouth, where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay, lies the cilty of Annapolis. Here, about the year 1650 some Puritans, a part, it is be- lieved, of Elder Durand's congregation, and the others a more recent importation from Boston, established a govern- ment very like the Judaical hierarchies of Plymouth and Saybrook.  In honour of Lady Anne, Lord Arundel's daughter, who married Cecilius, Lord Baltimore, the county was called- Anne Arundel, and, in compliment to Queen Anne, the town had just been named- Annapolis. In 1694, the seat of government was removed from St. Mary's, and, in the year of our narrative, owing to the partiality of his excellency, Governor Seymour, it was made a city. And who could say it might not, in due time, rival the mighty cities of the world? For no wonder that Rome, in time, attained such a zenith of greatness, when, as far back as- seven hundred and fifty years before Christ, Romulus laid out its foundations on the Palatine mount. Nor was it sur- prisifig that London could boast, at the time we are descri- bing, its almost million of inhabitants, for it was a place of mote in the first century after Christ, and yet eleven hundred years it was not of note enough to be mentioned in the Domes- day Book, minute as this book is in describing the towns and cities of England, and the Latin diploma of any dunce of a graduate is a more imposing document than the narrow parchment charter of five lines which William the Norman gave to it. No wonder, either, that Paris became, in time, (212)   ANNAPOLIS.          213 the emporium of fashion and dictatrix of manners. In the reign of the great Julius it was a sorry village called Lutetia, overing only an island on the Seine, with Hottentotish houses, and rpund at top, as a late kind of hats which are copied after one worn by the great humbug of the present day. And yet Paris grew so slowly that eight centuries afterwards it was pillaged as many as three times by the Normans. Now Annapolis had begun no more humbly than these great cities. Admit that its Puritan founders were an unperiwigged set of canting gospellers, with cropped hair and Geneva gowns, still, they were quite as genteel looking, certainly more " godly," than Romulus and his barbarians. They would have compared also advantageously with the heathenish and' red face painted Britons, and the beaver like islanders of Lutetia. Annapolis, besides, came into being under more favourable auspices. The world was waking up. Whig and Tory politics ran high in England, and the political regeneration of the world seemed near at hand. One thing was clear; Annapolis had shot ahead faster than either of these cities in the same time I In about fifty years from its first settlement it had become the seat of government; and about sixty years from the same event it had been incorporated as a city. What might not a begin- ning so unprecedented promise? It was now a thriving, fussy little town, with over fifty dwellings. The church of St. Anne's, built by Thomas Fielder, architect, was a neat brick eaifice in the form of a T, and the State House, also of brick, was a building in an oblong square, which a lofty cupola surmounted, and around which cupola ran balustrades that were furnished with seats, in order that the honourable the members of the Council, the lower House of Assembly, and the citizens, might, at their ease, luxuriate in the sea breeze from the bay side, and, especially, enjoy the fine water view which the harbour presents. There was also a building called the armory, wherein -were deposited the offensibles of the province. Here were kennelled those dogs who generally bite when they bark. Rome was saved by geese in the capit61l-Annapolis might be indebted for her safety to mouth-pieces which more than hissed. In the armory, also, was a spacious ball-room-proh pudor puritan- ism!-where the gentlemen and ladies danced at public balls, and from the vaulted roof of which was hung a gilt chandelier, and on the walls of which were full length portraits of Queen   214        PILATE AND HEROD. Anne and Lord Baltimore. Now, as might be expected, like some individuals who, having risen suddenly from obscurity, cannot wear their honours meekly, but take great airs upon themselves, so this little city-rhaving thus sprung up, almost magically it seemed, on the Severn river-now tossed its nose in the air, and became ashamed to own its former more humble names of Proctor's land, Severn town, or the more assuming one of Providence, which last name was given to it by Richard Bennett and his Puritan followers. And now, forsooth, it must be called Annapolis, the city of Anne. This last name argued that the little city was casting off its plebeianism, and aiming after the courtliness of better life and more refinement, which it afterwards attained, being ambitious to shine in this new world as the cynosure of wealth and fashion. By discarding the name of Providence it seemed willing to let die'the memory of " the round-heads" who settled it-a commendable feeling-and by tolerating the round-heads in her community, she' showed a desire to do better by them than was done by them in Jamestown. The cavaliers of Virginia drove those Puritan boors to Mary- land, while the little city hoped to polish them, supposing, perhaps, that the next generationi though descended from Puritans, would have enough of the cavalier blood by inter- marriage to redeemt it. Shepard and Montrose met the next morning. The former at first looked sad, and the latter was much perplexed to know whence and how came the voice which- had so startled them the night before. But Shepard's manner did not invite raillery, or inquiry; and the two were silently breakfasting, when a servant entered with a note from his excellency, the Governor, inviting Mr. Shepard to dine with him that day. Shepard returned a formal and courteously worded acceptance, and the servant, with hat off, and bowing very low, retired. He then remarked to his friend that in a few minutes the drum would beat the calling of the Assembly, and, as the two houses met at 8 in the forenoon, adjourned at noon, met again at 2 in the afternoon,-and broke up for the day at 4, P. M., that he would take him with him at 5 that afternoon to fall on the Governor. "Now," continued Shepard, I've sent to Monsieur Riboteau, the tailor from Paris, for the suit I ordered some time ago. My clothes still retain, I fear, the odour of the Irishman's hut. It won't do to appear as I anm before his excellency. You know the old saying, ' He that   DIALOGUE.          215 wears silk, satin, velvet and gold lace, must needs be a gen- tleman.' Cesar alone could afford to dress carelessly." Monsieur Bonbon, the barber, then came in, anad the friends submitted themselves to his manipulations. This operation over, Blonbon, a veritable knight of the strap and razor, bowing as only a Parisian barber can, with his hair tortured into the extreme of fashion and his face lit up with smiles and grimaces, said, "Ah! Messieurs, vous voilai maintenant tout i fait a la mode." Shepard received his suit from Riboteau, and had it on; and, in answer to Montrose's question how he liked it, said, as they were going to call on the governor, "As Bonbon would say, passablement bien. But I think the small clothes are rather loose. These tailors forget that I have not Governor Seymour's stomachic capacity to stow away a sirloin of beef, half --a plum-pudding, and a bottle of Burgundy." Montrose said, "Come now, tell me more about his ex- cellency." "You forget," replied his friend, " it does not need a very great man to play the part of Governor in an English colony. True, he and his officials would act the. King and his lords in the reception chamber, but the acting is mere acting after all, and bad acting at that. There is no want of tinsel, glitter, bowing, scraping, and indeed of forms enough to perplex a Chinese in the upper ranks; but ah! thereis wanting thedig- nified manner of an English nobleman. Here court etiquette is all a farce; where wiseacres wish to pass forBurleighs and Hydes." "But the Governor is a Puritan," said Montros?, "and his cabinet is like-minded. How then?" "He has abjured, therefore, all follies said Shepard; "Puritans do not love power, state, office, creature comforts, and pomps and vanities? Not at all. Oh no," laughing. ," But then Seymour is not now a private individual. As his excellency he must maintain the dignity of his station. See, here is his residence. We'll walk in," opening the front gate which was some distance from the house, "and the Governor shall speak for himself. You'll see whether his pure mind ever turns from unearthly joys, or his body ever has been pampered, and all to obey a tyrannical custom." The Governor received them with -marked formality and ceremoniousness, and, talking in a loud and pompous tone,   216  I     PILATE AND HEROD. laboured to convince Shepard how much he had at heart the purification-of the church. "It may be effected," continued his excellency, pucker- ing his lips up, and swelling out his cheeks, "if an ecclesi- astical tribunal were created with powers to summon ungodly parsons before them,'and deal summarily with them on con- viction " "I should be sorry to believe such a court was necessary," interposed Montrose. "Ah sir, no one more than I," and the Governor sighed and laid his hand on his capacious stomach, "mourns the necessity of such a court. And pnine eye-lids have not been closed for many nights in weeping that on me will devolve the unpleasant duty of presiding over it." ! "You think, then," continued Montrose, "that the bill before the house will certainly pass?" The Governor started a little, and looked searchingly at Shepard as if he could best answer his friend's question. But Shepard's face was as blank as an unblotted sheet; choosing to keep his own counsel. "I would prefer," replied his excellency, "not to be a member of the court. But public opinion, and the public good seem to designate me as the -proper person. And, as a high functionary," swelling out his person, "who has no selfish views, I could not decently decline." Shepard looked significantly at his friend, and said men- tally: "I know the meaning of all this cant. He is warmly for the bill, and his fingers burn to wield the rod over the parsons."     l In person his excelle cy was of such a form, as once seen, could not easily be forgotten. He was not above the ordi- nary height of men; but his body was much over the average size; swelling out like a mainsail filled with wind, and appeared to be stiuffed with the good dinners which were so common during thO legislative sessions. He had lost his hair, owing, it was said to former excessive indulgence in table luxuries, and a general habit of sensualism. Be this as it may, with his well rounded dumpling figure, rosy face, Eolus-like cheeks, and bald head, (the last only visible when from excitement he would take his wig off,) he was no bad representative of Friar Tuck, even the clerical tonsure being well indicated by the hairless crown when his wig was not on.  ie, looked very unlike one who had used such  t   GOVERNOR SEYMOUR.        217 abstinence as would bring his flesh in subjugation to the spirit; though no one was canting so much and incessantly on vanities and a carnal mind. And, if in early life he may have had nothing better than " dura messorum ilia," he feasted better now; no pig in sunshine, or gourmand with a groaning table before him seemed a better exemplification of physical happiness than his excellency, seated at table with the luxuries of the sea and land within reach, all smoking savoury, and just ready to be devoured. And his excellenty was too much of an epicure, he ate with too keen a relish, and the delicious morsel repaid turning over and over on the tongue too well to be gulped down whale-fashion with Jonah, or Yankee style at his meals. Still he was too mindful of his official dignity to lower himself to bacchanalian intem- perance, or unseemly revelry. He could do execution equal to any one with knife and fork; but still in his regular and hearty devotions to oysters, beef, and other table enjoy- ments, he never forgot to worship Governor Seymour. He was ever present to his own thoughts. Like Brutus and Cassius, who, "Ubicunque ipsi essent, proetexebant esse rempublicam," he considered himself as the state, the source of all authority, the one will that said, "Let be," and laws were enacted; the proper object -'f state and popular idolatry. The little brief authority in which he was dressed had completely turned his head. Opposition to his wishes was in his opinion an offence of Iamsae majestatis; and, a very Pope temporal, he would fulminate his bulls quite as meekly as do the pretended successors of St. P9ter. And as bulls, according to some, came from bulla, a little bladder, his threats were bulls undeniably. For, in place of conversing or talking, he exploded. His words came out in puffs more or less violent; and it is possible that the puff of words, which came from him, relieved him occasionally of the dark humours and disturbjng feelings and reflections, which swelled him out as gas does corruption. Shepard's time was either really or seemingly taken up with the business before the legislature; but he had not yet committed himself on the bill to trap the parsons. The governor's party very much desired this ecclesiastical court' bill; and hoped that this engine of tyranny would consist of the governor and three members of his council. A second party did not care much who composed the court, provided the court were created; and the third party was violently VOL. II.-19   218        PILATE AND HEROD. opposed, but on principle and expediency, to the creation of any such tribunal, no matter who were its members; and this party was made up of the friends of the church in the assembly. This third party might hold -the balance of power, if they could consistently unite with either one of the others, or manage to bring over to their side either one of thertwo first mentioned parties. But of doing one or the other of these things there seemed to be no prospect. The clouds looked portentous for the parsons. Puritanic zeal was not likely to cool, nor its animosity to die. The worldling's indifference would not be roused into sympathy in behalf of a class of men to whom they was obliged by law to pay an annual tax, and whose very profession rebuked him for not denying ungodliness and worldly lusts. The parsons had strong friends in the assembly, but they were in the minority. Nothing was talked of but the doom of the par. sons. Witlings ironically toasted them at the taverns. Couplets in bad rhyme were posted at a few of the street corners. The word. parsons became the target for jeerings and flings, scoutings and mirth. The parson was caricatured figuring at a horse race with his wig off, and his gown flying in the air; or as the hero in a groggery with his coat off, playing the part of a bruiser; or, with spectacle on nose, and face most:demure, (as if the preacher could not have a hearer more tired than himself of his sermon,) he was re- presented as doling forth to a sleeping congregation a wishy. washy homily, which he had dragged through as far as seventeenthly. And with this effervescence of the popular mind in squibs and caricatures came up a sound more dole- ful and fearful. A cry of taxation for a privileged class; a cry that the state was burdened for men that bore none of its burdens; a cry that these men, or a part of them, denied by their lives what they professed to preach; a cry that the liberty to worship God according to one's conscience was taken away; this cry, started by Romanist and Quaker, and swelled by Romanist and Quaker, Dissenter and Noncon- formist, swept over the province, and seemed to clamour at the doors of the legislative chamber, and demand a hearing. What if it were a cry as false as thousand-tongued rumour! what if its starters and inculcators may have had blistered tongues for speaking it! what if the cheeks of some crimsoned, for their audacious libel on good men and true! This cry came on "as the sound of outhreaking   PARSON LILLISTON.        219 waters ;" and some of the clergy, not over-strong in nerve, wished to fly the province. A few only could look on, and undismayed, see in the clamour, not the awaking of an out- raged people, but the awaking' of that demon misrule, who, with fair words and great promises, sweeps church and state, liberty, life, and property into a terrible vortex. The bell of St. Annie's Church seemed to toll ominously: having lost its cheerful ringing sound, it was said. The nights had been unusually bright and still, and there was a fearful quiet in the moonlight that shone on the Church, and the dead within its cemetery. The worthy rector of St. Annie's found no heart for study, and did not know howl he might read the words of his flock as he moved among them. He called on Colonel Smithson. "' My good sir," said he, -' you have influence in the As- sembly. Make one of your best efforts. Do not let the church be thus down trodden. Make them to see the evil they are bringing upon themselves, the country, and the church." The colonel shook his head mournfully, and replied : "' I may as well preach moderation to madmen, or with a willow twig seek to stay a torrent in its course. I know the spirits in the house too well. Opposition, I fear, will now but exasperate, and increase the evil-? "You mean then to let them have their own way," asked Parson Lilliston, alarmed and amazed. "And the church is to have only such pastors as a Puritan Governor and un- godly legislature shall think proper to give them!"Colonel Smithson was roused from his wonted indifference, and replied: "To gratify your reverence I will see to-morrow, if I can either lay this spirit of misrule, or soothe and quiet it down to more temperance." Parson Lilliston withdrew, thankful even for this promise, and remarked to Parson Gordon, who arrived that evening from St. Mary's, that perhaps something would yet be done to prevent the passage of the bill. Parson Gordon did not seem to think so. "No man who is half persuaded himself can persuade  others. A man's\v'hole soul must be in his subject to carry others along with him. "I am sick," continued Parson Gordon, " of this apathy on the part of respectable lay members of the church. If they stand back, and come not to the rescue, can we wonder that the rabble rush in the breaches, and storm the citadel?"   220        PILATE AND HEROD. Pursuant to his promise Colonel Smithson made an effort for the parsons. His speech evinced much tact. He pre- sented the objections to the bill in a way so as to offend none, and yet showed that the parsons were not quite worthy of proscription and outlawry. The politic colonel admitted that there might be well-founded complaints; but did not think the remedy prescribed in the bill before the house adapted to the disease. "But admit," argued he blandly, "that the church is brought to bed of a dangerous illness. I doubt very much whether the amputation of so necessary a limb as the minis. try, will conduce to her recovery. Time, quiet, cooling draughts, and fresh air, a wholesome current of public opinion," explaining his figure, "may allay and remove this gangrene which, some think, affects the body ecclesiastic." And the colonel appealed to the justice and fairness of the members whether, even allowing one or two clergymen to be justly liable to censure, it was right to include the inno- cent with them. The speech accomplished two things: it mollified for awhile some members who were eager to pass the bill in- stanter, and it lost the colonel nothing with the opposition, for he admitted the evil complained of, and of course allowed that a remedy should be applied as early as it might be prac- ticable; and the opposition only differed as to the remedy pro- posed. "We will lift up the suppliant hands and bend the feeble knees," said Parson Gordon, coming away from the house with Parson Lilliston, " for vain is the help of man." That evening, the governor's party, waxing bolder at Colonel Smithson's concession, met at the Governor's, and heteroge- neous as it seemed to be, the persons so assembled, united all, were in one voice to pass the bill to tax the parsons, and in thinking it would be well to let the governor and his council have the honour of laying the snare.     H A Captain Fendall was prominent in the conversation, ors consultation, between these worthies, and his prominency was allowed him in deference to his reputation for great, singleness of piety; as singleness he certainly had, for he", had but one idea; hereby resembling a truly great man, Chief Justice Marshall of our day, in one respect, he did but one thing at a time. The captain, it seems, once heard the remark, the Saviour often wept, but never smiled. Hence his gravity was proverbial, like Dr. Donne, in order that his   CAPTAIN FENDALL.         221 outer man might truly represent his inner. Fendall should have had his likeness taken with a winding sheet over him, and only exposing enough of the face to show his eyes closed, and thus the man would seem to see, as he did in truth, but one thing at a time; not seeing at all. In Fendall's opinion the merest trifles were things of great moment; for his. mind was never telescopic, but essentially microscopic, as its always mag- nified; while in a voice between the squealing of a pig and: the hoarseness of one with a bad cold, the captain, on the occa6 casion mentioned, enlarged or prosed on the immorality of the parsons. "Yes! by the powers, and thunder too," interrupted Whitter, the influential member spoken of in the last chap- ter, " and we mean to put a stop to it. We'll rid the pro- vince of an evil that is unbearable. The parsons,--a pretty set!-a bit of piety have they!--a cursed -- " and Whit- ter, forgetting the presence of his excellency, and especially that he might shock beyond endurance the solemn Captain Fdndall,--bolted out two or three startling oaths; to prove, perhaps, his anxiety, and at the same time his ability to improve the morals of the clergy. "I hold in my hand, worthy friends," said his excel- lency, " a list of such of the parsons as it will be the un- pleasant and yet imperious duty of the court to deprive of their livings. Much do I regret that the clergy are not like the apostles, holy, spotless, unimpeachable, pure-minded men.  It is bad enough when officials of the state do not carry themselves above reproach; and when they do not, we feel ourselves at liberty, nay more, called on, to expose them.  The sifety of the state demands that we show favours to none. And we must even do the same if the clergy turn aside; or we shall let the cause of sound morals suffer. What think you, friend?" "True as my right hand,' said Whitter. "If there are any Judases, I say, have at them." The governor looked much: pleased at this assent; and, leaning over with a deferential air, he showed the list to Captain Fendall; and, speaking in an under tone, said to this worthy: "See here. Grave, very, and weighty charges rest on these.  Ah! great, great is the scandal to our holy reli- gion,"-now raising his voice so as to be heard by all; for the governor's good sayings were not breathed in a corner, 19*   i 222       PILATE AND HEROD. but published on the house-tops. "I fear thtthose who are set on the walls of Israel to watch, have fallen asleep." "Indeed!" said Fendall, like every other little souled biped, having no more faith in human nature than he was compelled to have; " and who makes the charges?" "Who?" and his excellency smiled, as much as to say, this was a strange question, for every body makes them. His smile gave the council to understand the charges were endorsed by that very respectable and indubitable indivi- dual, every body in general, and that no body in particular was needed. But, blinking his eye so as to catch Fendall's attention, and at the same time sinking his voice, he said: "I want-no better witness than that very godly man, the Reverend Mr. Allgrace." "Nor I neither," muttered Fendall, satisfied that every public whisper, and extravagant lie, and baseless and mali- cious invention against the clergy were fully proved; and he felt disposed to say, as did his prototypes of thatrMaster in heaven, for whose cause the clergy were persecuted, "What need we any further witnesses? Away with him. Let him be crucified." And the spirit of the murderers at Calvary appeared to animate the little pandemonium at the governor's. - They let themselves out in general and viru- lent abuse of the clergy of the establishment. They were horrified, so they said to each other, at the want of piety in the clergy! With charity on their lips, they distilled ran- cour from their tongues. They professed to be shocked at the want of holiness in the-clergy, and yet they were tossing from lip to lip the holy names of God, and Christ, and the blessed Spirit, with the utmost irreverence. They were re- solved to exterminate "the parsons." They, the legislators, by moral enactments, were about to "strike redemption from the steel." And would not the province be regenerated? Lu- ther, Calvin, and Cranmer, did nothing. The Council of Trent, some think, however, worked out the reformation of the age! Heaven itself was in tumult till Satan and one-third of the heavenly host rebelled, and attempted to put the universe to rights. A piece of cheese is in a most hopeful state when, swarming with animalcular life, its population crawl away from it. The church was to be reformed,-who doubts it? the clergy taught their duty, and a purer Gospel and a purer Christianity would go forth from the spirits that very night assembled at the governors.   DISPERSION OP THE ASSEMBLY.     223 As the conclave broke up, a few went off with Whitter to drink and gamble over the card table; some with Lawyer Brief, the disguised Romanist, to plot in secret so as to make sure what had been agreed upon; while the single- minded Captain Fendall, like Hervey among the tombs, walked by the grave-yard of the new brick church of St. Anne's. t   CHAPTER XXV1II. MR. DELAFIELD'S SPEECH AND ITS EPFECT. "Arouse thee, youth! it is no human call, God's church is leagur'd, haste to man the wall, Haste where the red-cross banners wave on high, Signal of honoured death or victory." JAMEs DUFF. As the solemn Captain Fendall walked by the grave-yard of the new brick church of St. Anne's, he exclaimed, "Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity, saith the preacher," and his Solomonship looked up'and saw that he was near this the first brick church in Maryland. His rigid face relaxed into a contemptuous curl as he added, "They need not have built a brick church to keep up the hoary iniquities of an establishment. A wooden house would have outlasted both the establishment and the principles of this rotten Church of England." And so think Captain Fendalls now. A certain historian once said the Roman see would be in full vigour when, ages hence, a traveller standing neari London bridge, would ask where was London?  And a Roman archbishop in this country said he expected to live to see the day when, Pro- testantism becoming distasteful and unpopular, a Protestant would be carried about the country as a curiosity. What a pity it is that every Scotchman is 'not a seer that such benevolent wishes cannot be gratified! and that the Roman intruder into the diocese of New York will not live as long as did Methusaleh! "Captain Fendall, you are out late this evening," said a voice behind him. Fendall turned and saw Mr. Delafield, who asked if he had been to the governor's, and being answered in the affirmative, by a few questions extracted from the unsuspecting captain all he wished to know from him. Mr. Delafield then turned towards the church, as the captain walked away, and looking up to the belfry, on which the moon shone, he said feelingly, (224)   DELAFIELD'S SPEECH.       225 "May you ring out many a peal, and may these brick walls hear within them for many years the voice of Christ's ambassador  But those peals sound doleful now. Clouds are gathering thick and fast' around the church. I could not serve her in the ministry, I may serve her now in a way less honourable, though the world would account it more so. The enemy is at the gates. The infidel shout echoes so loud and deafening, oh! sanctuary of peace! as to almost drown the voice of praise and thanksgiving among such as keep holy day within thy courts. It must not be. He, who 7ave 'victory unto David,' can, and, I believe will, bless my poor efforts. It must not be, for ' one man shall chase a thousand, and the shout of a king is among them.' It must not be, for 'the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.' Yet the rabble rout musters large. I fear much they will carry this measure, and our fault is it, and for our sins it will be that the clergy are brought under the heel of Roman and infidel hate. We shall have an inquisitorial court in the province. And what then?"   He paused awhile. "Why," speaking to himself, with much emotion, "Jerusalem will be made an heap of stones. Her pastors will be driven from the folds, and time-serving preachers, yea, hirelings indeed, who take their texts from the governor, and their interpretations from any but the Prayer Book and England's best divines, will have the livings of the church. It must not be," he continued, walking quick occasionally, and then halting, he said, "God may in mercy avert the evil if we do our duty." The next day, bright Phoebus rose from behind a cloud. Heavy mistshung upon the bay of Annapolis, and a darker cloud and a heavier mist hung upon the spirits of the church- men in the town. With heavy hearts, and faces expressive of anxiety, they broke their fast. In due time the drum-beat was heard calling the two houses to meet for business. Groups had been for some time forming at the principal tavern and the main store on the street near the State House, and children, negroes, and dogs were hurrying with the market people-this being one of the two market days- towards the State House. On rolled the crowd, "a fussy billow of life," a noisy, anxious, troubled, unsteady mass. In it, by twos, walked here and there the honourable members, some talking by jerks, others in a low and thoughtful tone. A few were heard to laugh from fulness of joy, or, as Gold-   r"e'v      HPILATE AND HEROD. smith might say, from "a vacant mind."  As the most prominent members in support of the bill to trap the parsons came along by the tavern, they were greeted by a hurrah, and dogs, negroes, and children swelled the shout. Just in their rear walked, with step lofty, and with conscious beauty elate, some fair damsels, the daughters of Puritan parents; but with an air and dress that seemed very unpuritanical and as they swept on with their trains dragging behind, or lifted by a servant, out stept some rakish youths, who, hats off, and with bow most reverent, first greeted, and then accompanied them to the State House. And whence came, *and why pressed on, excited, this crowd of grey heads, sturdy manhood, roisterous youth, matron, spinster and belle, round. head and cavalier? Here was a gathering of the clans from the Pocomoke on the eastern shore, to the Elk river at the north, and from the head waters of the Potomac to its mouthb and from east, west, north, and south of the province, to do what? To pass an act of the legislature to make less than two dozen poop half fed, and indifferently clad clergymen answerable for their misdemeanours, real or supposed, truly charged or slanderously reported, to .a lay court of four or more persons, who might be Julians in creed, Jeffreys in integrity, and Neros in mercy. The drum-beat gave quite a martial air and aspect to this gathering of the provincials, and of the honourable; and puffed with consequence, seemingly intent on great deeds, with face, manner, and step, worthy of sons of Mars marched the members into the hall, and seated themselves. Fit was it that the drum-beat should summon them, and that the tocsin, which is sounded generally for violence and carnage, should beat its call, when they were met to make war on the ambassadors of the Gospel of peace. The mar- tial chlmour ceased-the hurrying of steps here and there- the rustling of dresses, the -buzz, the loud remark--the whisper, all were hushed. The lower House was declared, by the speaker in due form, to be ready for business. The gallery and hall were mute and silent when this announce- ment was made. The bill creating an ecclesiastical court being in order, a member from Worcester, strongly in the Quaker interest, moved the passage of the bill without further debate; and, no objection being made, there seemed to be a disposition to pass it at once.   THE ASSEMBLY.         227 Shepard was not in his place, disgusted, perhaps, at the course things had taken; or thinking it, perhaps, labour lost, to put himself -in a breach where he would be pressed in an overwhelming mass; or loving his ease or reputation too much to compromise himself by a fruitless contest with a majority, which was held together by the strong ligaments of ignorance, hatred, and interest. Colonel Smithson was there, and tried to look quiet and satisfied, bland and courteous, though he was ill pleased that his speech had rather emboldened than awed the enemy; and despairing of doing any thing more, though urged strongly by friends of the clergy who were just about him to try again, he refused positively to make another speech. The bill then must pass, and the church in the province be strangled, for the want of a man in that lower house who had nerve and mind enough to say, now, at the fitting time, fitting words in her behalf. A bright prospect this for Romanist, Quaker, and infidel et id omne genus, who sympathised with them in animosity to the clergy, or in a craving for their, generally, beggarly livings. And a dark prospect it was for England's Church, and for all who desired the peace of Jerusalem, and the prosperity of Zion. A few Quakers, noticeable from their plain coats and un- periwigged 'heads, were seen in the gallery, evidently in high glee. A few coarse jokes, and a wicked wish that fell from one of Whitter's confederates, made some females in the gallery blush, and others tremble; while it called out a-itter in that neighbourhood among the members. In the corner of that gallery, nearly unseen, yet himself seeing every thing, and his ear losing nothing, a: close ob- server would have detected, in a black cassock, the large person of Father Hunter. Ah! that admirable embodiment of Jesuitism thought-.and chuckled as he reflected-I have not intrigued for nought. His ever roving and anxious eyes were lighted with unusual satisfaction, and his cloudy face brightened up. Gog and Magog, the trained bands of the open and secret friends of popery, the clamorous and persevering Quakers, the Dissenters and opponents of the Church of England, and every factious person, by his address, in a great measure, (Governor Seymour, for motives of his own, and not suspecting at first that he and Ro- manists stood shoulder to shoulder against the reformed 7          ,t   228       PILATE AND HEROD. Church of England, helping on,) all were formed into a serried phalanx against the clergy. "Who would have thought that so dark a day would dawn on the province in my time!" exclaimed Parson Lil. listen, and starting to go out, as the speaker was about to put the question, he added, "I can do nothing. I must not see what I can't prevent." But as he moved out, he felt his coat held by some one, and he turned to free it from the obstruction. "Wait," said Mrs. Smith, a devoted member of his flock. "Look yonder." He did wait, and he did look. Did he dream? No, a sober reality; yea, more, a ground not to doubt again, that, when truth is about to be overborne, and righteousness trampled on, a champion will be found; who, if not able to make victory perch on their standards, can keep the enemy at bay a while. Parson Lilliston saw a tall and spare per- son, whose head, as Byron said of Southey's, was an epic; an impersonation of lofty and daring thoughts and deeds, 'whose face beamed with more than usual intelligence, though marked by care and suffering; and who in years had past that sunlit period where hope predominates. This persona as the speaker was about to put the question, asked to be heard. "Who is he?" exclaimed many. "Do you know?" asked one member of another. "No," was the reply.. "Do you? You?" and the question passed on, till it came to Captain Fendall, who sat with his lower jaw dropt about an inch, and with his eyes half closed, and his hands clasped; as if this worthy were then and there busied in- voking by prayer the Deity, to send a successful and speedy issue to the bill he had so much at heart. Fendall, l-king interrogated and roused, looked wildly about him. After awhile he saw who it was that so many were unacquainted with. "What is he saying 1" drawled out Fendall. /' Who is he?" repeated his questioner. "Who is he? Why, he aint the man to speak in favour of the sons of Levi," replied Fendall, too anxious to know on what side the speaker on the floor could be to be aware he had not replied to the question which was put to him. "Who is he, man?" urged his interrogator, impatiently. "He aint no one but Mr. Delafield from Calvert. Who did you think he was?"   DELAFIELD'S SPEECH.        229 Fendall received no reply; his interrogator, and every one else, not excepting even Fendall, being solely intent on the words, which at first tremulously and almost indistinctly fell from Mr. Delafield. He was'evidently no orator, and evi- dently unused and untrained to public speaking. But the sincerity which his face breathed, and his voice and manner indicated, with the respect for the company which a diffident opening implies, and by implying gains attention, made the House willing listeners. it You are about to create an ecclesiastical court of lay- men, authorizing them to hear andto try charges against the clergy of the establishment. Why? For crimes and offen- ces against the laws of the land? No; for we have courts which take cognizance of such. For improprieties which af- fect them as gentlemen? No; for public opinion regulates in that matter; but for charges which impeach their piety, and affect their usefulness in their holy calling; and, did I not see it so stated in the bill before the house, and hear it loudly, and often trumpeted out of doors, I should not be- lieve it possible that it is gravely proposed to create a court of four laymen to-exercise powers over the clergy that are strictly episcdpal. Verily this is a stretch of lay solicitude about the morals of the clergy, which shows, either that the laity are the only godly, or that under a pharisaic assump- tion of regard for the clergy, a deadly blow is aimed at them." He rang changes on this key, waxing warm, and boldly and unsparingly exposed the malice, which covertly sought, first to degrade the office, and next to destroy the authority of the ministry in the province. He commented on the sin- gular fact that Roman priests, and Quaker and Dissenting preachers might sin with impunity to any extent they pleased, and then enlarged on the hostile feeling in thus singling out the clergy of England's Church, and visiting upon themethe wicked, hateful, and unprecedented tyranny of a lay court. "The good Lord bless us," said Mrs. Smith, the very devout member of St. Anne's parish, who was present in the gallery, , them parson-haters are bad as the high priests who tried the Saviour.  Like Herod and his soldiers, they'd whip the parsons, and then crown them with thorns." "But who," continued Mr. Delafield, "are to try the triers? No  one, it seems; though the four members of the court may have taken their degrees in every ungodly schol- YoL. I.--20    230       PILATE AND HEROD. arship. If a court be created to maintain the purity of the clergy, let us also have a court to maintain the purity of the lay inquisitors." "If they'd make Mrs. Seymour and me judges to try Governor Seymour, who wants to be chief judge in this court agen the parsons," said Mrs. Smith- to a lady near, ' we'd make him promise to let his wife have her natural rights, and the clergy have theirs too." "This court is to depose unworthy clergymen, and take away their livings. Jndeed!' said Mr. Delafield, with -amazement depicted in his face, and expressed in his tone of voice. "What a farce! in the face of day! and calculated to awaken the derision of Christendom ;" and to show that he dealt not in rhetorical flourishes, or frothy declamation, he opened the eyes of the wiseacres, by showing from the law ,books, that such causes, ecclesiastical and spiritual, as grow out of things done or omitted by the clergy in contravention of their vows, the cognizance whereof not belonging to the common laws, are to be determined and decided by ecclesi- astical judges, according to the ecclesiastical laws of Eng. land. He quoted the great lawyer's opinion that the king-. dom was always best governed, and peace and quiet preserved when the justices of the temporal courts and the ecclesiastic cal judges kept themselves within their proper jurisdiction. Truth is distasteful to poor erring man, and to simpletons ever unsavoury. But Mr. Delafield, to heal, had first to probe the wound, and now that he was fairly out, he did not flinch; though Whitter and some of his coadjutors frowned,  and bristled up. "Pass this bill," said he boldly and- defiantly, "and her majesty will let you know you are assuming powers that be- long only to the consistory of the bishop of London. The clergy may be regarded by you as less than the laity, where- fore you would punish them for offences which laymen com- mit with impunity, and I doubt not but some of the reverend gentlemen, like their master before them, may meekly sub- nirt to Herod's and Pontius Pilate's jurisdiction." He next exposed the ignorance of the advocates of the bill in proposing to deprive the clergy, of their livings and so depose or degrade them, (the two terms were correlative,) on certain charges heard, and as the projected court should determine, proven before' it. "And your deposition," he added, "would do no further temporal harm generally, than   DELAFIELD'S SPEECH.       231 relieve some very worthy men of the necessity now laid upon themn by their consciences, of preaching the Gospel for what is next to nothing, and of earning crowns of martyrdom, to the everlasting shame of the people of this province. But there are great principles here involved." He showed then by the books before him, for he had his authorities within reach, that deprivation was not a civil but an ecclesiastical censure; and, being ecclesiastical, was an act which a legislature, being a lay body, could not do. "The bill seeks to do even more, not only to deprive the clergy of their livings, but of their orders, by deposing or degrading them. This aJso is an ecclesiastical censure, and by an ecclesiastic to be administered. A legislature, and of course, any court -it might create, could have no such power. I knew not that our house was composed of men, all of whom are endowed with holy functions, and empowered to take from unworthy clergymen their orders of priest and deacon. If so I am more honoured in being a member than I supposed." Here there was a laugh. "But how would you degrade? Let us see the form." And he proceeded to show how the bishop took from the offend- ing clergyman, one by one, the robes, books and the like ap- pertaining to his profession, and then asked, who, in the court proposed, would play the bishop?"The presiding officer, governor perhaps." Well, now what mockery would it be in a layman to say, as is said in the deposition, as the Bible and vestments are taken from  the offender, -"this and this we take from thee! By the authority of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and of- us!"Mr. Delafield made this argument tell with irresistible power. There were very few of his hearers who did not feel that the movers and advocates of the bill, in their animosity to the clergy, were intruding on holy, and to their unholy persons, forbidden ground; that the bill was tyrannical in the extraordinary form it assumed; that it was illegal, being against the laws of England, which swayed in the province; and that it was unscriptural, infidel, and sacrilegious; and they agreed for the time, with Mr. Delafield, if a deposing power could in any way be created, or sanctioned by the Maryland Assembly, that it must be vested in a bishop; and then, and not before, can deposition be effected. Thus far had the speaker been allowed to go on unchallen-   232        PILATE AND HEROD.          y X ged-; and, having the floor so long, and using his time and ad. vantage so well, it was feared by some of the members that he would quite turn the current of opinion in 'the house; at least that he would throw bulwarks so high that the flood of anti-clerical feeling could not flow further. He must then be interrupted, and, if necessary, stopt. ,But how? was the estion. There was no hour rule, as in legislative bodies noi and hence he must be allowed, so long as he confined himself to the subject in debate, to talk on, and talk out the day. They might call for the question, and by clamour drown his voice, and by the force of a majority pass a bill which they could not defend, and the objections to which they could not meet. And some of the more violent meditated this plan. But this would have been an outrage so flagrant, a discourtesy so unprovoked, against a worthy member who had nqt exceeded his privileges, an admission of weakness so evident, ^that they durst not attempt it. Stop him then they could not. But he was manifestly no public speaker. Once committed on a subject, and the ice broken, and his mind found ideas and words; but he seemed to be nervous; and an interruption, by a cross ques. tion, or plausible reply thrown in for a few minutes here and there, might embarrass and defeat him eventually. And Lawyer Brief had just the impudence to play this manoeuvre. With a face bland as assurance could make it, and a bow as graceful as might be expected from a paddy who mistakes -,J servility for civility, and with a voice in keeping, and being indescribable, must be inferred, he begged leave to say a word or two, which he doubted not his honourable friend had overlooked in the inevitable haste of an earnest argument. "When our wheels are well greased, and we are! going with a furious momentum, we have not time to pick up pennies by the way, not time even to see them. I travelled after my friend less rapidly, and what he did not, perhaps could not see, I gathered." The little attorney then stated that they were doing no new thing in the province, but only what colonial legislatures have always supposed they might do; and he said, that in South Carolina, less than four years before, the assembly created a court for the adjudication of ecclesiastical cases, which consisted of twenty laymen; and Brief asked, if the Charleston Assembly could give a lay court of twenty ecclesiastical power, could not the assembly at Annapolis give a lay court of four the same power?   DELAFIELD'S REPLY.        233 Brief then sat down, and Mr. Delafield, who had been standing all the time, and seemed a little put out by the interruption, might have been discomposed, if any other but Brief, or a Romaniser, had been the interrupter. But his dislike to Romanism and Jesuitism was so strong that, once roused, the old man tremulous became the old man eloquent, with nerves of iron, and voice as clear as the hunter's horn. He therefore, and much to his opponent's dismay, proceeded to prove that this lay court in South Carolina was no sooner created than both Churchmen and Dissenters complained of it. They addressed a memorial accordingly to the'House of Lords, and set forth that the ecclesiastical government of that province belonged to the Bishop of London; that "the lords voted an address in which," they represent said lay court to try ecclesiastical matters to be against the charter, and the law of the realm, and the Constitution of the Church of England. Whereupon her majesty nullified the bill and the court it created. "These Churchmen preach dangerous doctrines for our times," said Captain Fendall, musing. 'They won't let people or-king meddle in their matters. I've heern of all this independency before. We law-makers would come here to no purpose, if we couldn't set the parsons to right as well as other folks." And it is not a safe doctrine to preach at any time, but it is nevertheless a- true one; and truth is not to be measured by expediency. If the clergy could not be set to rights by certain self-constituted regulators, these regu- lators would have no vocation. Mr. Delafielda heard not the captain's reflections. His head and heart soared aloft. His course was starlit, and, if the murmurs from the Roman and Dissenting side of the house reached him, they no more turned his course than the buzz-of a city does that of an eagle who soars nearly cloud- high above it. He went on to show that the clergy were called of God as was Aaron, and hence answerable for eccle- siastical misdemeanours only to an ecclesiastical superior. "Alas! my worthy friend," soliloquized Parson Lillis- ton, " the enemies of the church have bent their bow, and made ready their arrow, and they won't hear to having their hunt spoiled, though it should be- proven to them that the clergy are not beasts of the forest, but servants of the great King." The morning was now well past; a few minutes more, and 20*   234       PILATE AND HEROD. the house would adjourn. But he must close his argument this morning, and then in the afternoon, if he felt able, end with such appeals as would clinch his forenoon efforts. Hle hastened then to say, that the bill assumed in the court proposed the powers of the crown, no less than those of a bishop. "Thus, the right to minister in a particular place and there take a living, needs induction by a bishop, which invests with the living, and nomination by the crown, who is the patron paramount, or by some patron whose right. came remotely from the crown; but in this province the governor claims both the right of the crown to nominate a clergyman to a parish, and the right of a bishop to invest him with the charge of it; and now it is proposed that this lay court, playing the part of parliament, king, and bishop, shall take away livings from, clergymen." I opine," said Lawyer Brief, with his ready craft, "as the Church of England is an establishment, and hence the creature of the state, that the legislature can take away the livings from the clergy. For, Mr. Speaker, what the state made the state can unmake." This argument, flimsy as it was, took with shallow brains and strong prejudices., Mr. Delafield knew this fact, and instead of an elaborate argument to show that, by enjoying the protection of the legislature, the church did not become its creature,--he carried the war into Carthage against Brief. "The Church of Rome," said he, "is the established church in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal; but does my friend from St. Mary's allow that, not St. Peter, but Caesar, or the civil power, has the disposal of the ecclesiastical bene- S fiees of those kingdoms? Is the Church of Rome there but the creature of those governments?" The appeal hit hard on the attorney, and he was silent. An adjournment was now moved, the hour having arrived, and not a little to the relief of a few did they withdraw from a place where truths most unsavoury had been dressed up and forced down their shallow gullets, to a tavern where, according to Eden Cook, gent., a cotemporary, assembled, "Some to get drunk, and some to eat A swinging share of country treat."  The medley of Romanists, Quakers, and the like, thus banded together against " the parsons," came out of the house feeling much less martial than they did as they entered; and it is possible that their zeal and courage needed pota-   DELAFIELD'S REPLY.       235 tions deep to get up to the martial fervour. Too brief seemed to many of them the recess between the morning and after- noon meetings,. only from noon to two o'clock,-too brief it certainly was to swallow down the unpleasant things they had heard in the morning, rally their spirits, rally their forces, and renew the battle. The interim, therefore, was not unfavourable to Mr. De- lafield. He retired to his chamber, and theie tried te recruit his nearly spent energies for a final and decisive effort, till the drum-beat, and the slamming of doors, and pacing of feet in the passages, and loud talking made him to know that there was other and harder work before him, than "a little more sleep, a little more slumber, a little more folding of the arms to sleep." Having shown that the bill before them was against all law and precedent, Mr. Delafield knew that he had not done all to turn the tide of unkindness which ran, so strong against the clergy. It was now necessary to enlist the kind feelings of the house in their favour. He therefore spoke of the clergy as from the first the friend of the people. To the poor the gospel was preached. To relieve the wretched ever had been their pride. The manse of -"the parson," from the earliest times, had been-open to the stranger and the friendless, knowing full well that he must be given to hospitality. And pursuing this theme, he said: "Whence came the-parliament? The clergy were mem- bers of it under the Saxon heptarchy, and on to this day, by the bishops, who are the lords spiritual of the upper house, they have continued to give to England that legisla- ture in which the voice of an outraged people has spG o freely, and rarely without effect. When mail-clad bliana I claimed that the poor man's wife; daughter, and son .were his vassals, bound to submit to his lusts,. to follow him to,: the wars, the clergy alone dared to command the brutal noble to forbear. "The clergy could protest, yea, beard monarchy in his high places, when others were afraid even to breathe their murmurs. Their'kingdom, they knew, was not of this world, and, looking to a master above to reward or punish, they acted on their Lord's precept, ' Fear not him who only can kill the body, but rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.' You think much of your Magna Charta, and justly esteem it the palladium of England's liberties;   236       PILATE AND HEROD. but to whom are you indebted for it? To the bishops of that day. When King John in'Westminster hall, before the nobility and bishops, swore to observe the charter, the bishops had the courage to extinguish the candles which they held in their hands, and to say in a loud tone, ' Thus let him be extinguished, and stink in hell, who violates this charter.' Brave words were these to be spoken to the face of monarchy. Brave words were these to be spoken by men whom it has 'become fashionable in certain circles to decry and persecute as in -league with the oppressors of our race." "I thought before now," said the solemn Captain Fendal to a member at his left elbow, "that a man must be born again to do what was right, and that where he aint regene- rated he won't do it." Very true, captain, by, the grace of God only can we do, yea, think evep the thing that is right. But, where we have not the ministry of reconciliation to preach the pure word of God, and by the sacraments and worship- of the sanctuary to keep us in that-way, and build us up in the faith, we should most certainly want the grace of regenera- tion, and the new birth unto righteousness, either in the church's or the worldling's-sense of the term. "I like that fellow," said Whitter, whispering to one of, his coadjutors. "And hang me if this aint a dirty business we are at." "Well! well!" said Captain Fendall, the Puritan, over- hearing him, " we must not be nice when we are acting for the good of the people. The Pharisees were, friend Whitter, a very nice class. They made clean the outside of the cup and3plattef. We must purge our consciences, friend, from dead works, and what is this but to purify the sons of Levi?" Thus far, Mr. Delafield's remarks had been mdant for the members of the House generally, and he was satisfied that an impression had been produced favourable to the parsons. There was a nervous fidgettiness in the manners of ,the governor's party, and many faces were turned upwards in confidence to Mr. Delafield, which had sided with the movers of the bill. If now, the members of the Church of England could be roused to step boldly forward, and make the par- sons' cause their own, Governor Seymour's party might be driven to the wall. Hence, to call out the members of the Church of England to lead the phalanx, he spoke of them as athletes of Christ, whose baptismal vow bound them to   DELAFIELD'S REPLY.        237 carry themselves stoutly as much in opposition to this bill as in any other contest with sin, the world, and the devil. "I must interrupt the gentleman," said the member from Worcester, boiling with uncontrollable rage. "My friends and self cannot allow-that we are so near of kin, as he states, to sin, the world, and the devil." "No doubt you think so," continued Mr. Delafield, " and, covering up the iniquity of your real motives by the miser- able and pellucid pretext to help the cause of sound religion, you have persuaded yourself, as you would others, that you do not design the ruin of the clergy of the establishment. I know, however, you do, and cry, therefore, to the rescue. 'Members of the church must not'allow the infidel host to defile her sanctuary, and cast her holy things unto dogs." He paused. "Why? What care we legislators for opinion, -if it be not a sound, healthy, and moral public opinion? Is any one here afraid to do his duty? put his feet on this hole of the asp, and thus forbid the cockatrice to come forth? lest he may be suspected of wishing to deal out, to the clergy that justice of not punishing for crimes till crimes are proved upon them, which we deal out to pirates and highwaymen? What care we? If we have done our duty we have cleared our skirts, and being harnessed for the battle, here engaged as the lawmakers of the province, let us not, like Ephraim, turn back in the day of battle. We know- the bill to :be wicked in every way; let us, then, vote it down. We know it to be a blunderbuss charged with all manner of hurtful missiles against the Church of England; let us, then, render it harmless. We know it to be an entering wedge to a power which Eis designed to split, divide, weaken, and destroy the establishment; let us not allow such an instrument of destruction to have our sanction. "I may have spoken in vain," continued Mr. Delafield, "to some in this house, but there are others, I know, who are not indifferent to England's clergy, and England's Church; and, as if I stood on the battle field and was leading them on against a Paynim host, I would cry 'St. George to the rescue.? We can be but defeated, compatriots in arms for the holiest of causes. Most nobly falls he, who, with his eye fixed on heaven, falls for that cause which brought the Son of God down from heaved to earth. But fall we cannot. God's blessing and succour will attend, and carry on trium-   238'       PILATE AND HEROD. phantly those who make His cause theirs. I stand then for the church and clergy of our native land. I lift aloft its banner, and call to stand under it with me all who bear in grateful remembrance the untold blessings, which,-through the ministry and the word, have preserved us as a people, and exalted us as a nation."9 There was an intenseness, an earnestness, a fire in the face and eye of the speaker that electrified the house. Light shone around, and about, and from him. He stood, as stands a bright apotheosis, in a cloud of glory, and, as he finished, there was a wondrous harmony in his tones, which held the house breathless; and a whole minute and more had passed, when a murmur of applause, spontaneous and irrepressible, arose. A motion for adjournment was immediately made and carried, and then, like the pattering of heavy rain-drops, after abright electric blaze, and sharp explosion, came the pattering of feet on the floor, and the noise of the members and lookers-on retiring from the State House. As the members and spectators walked homeward, those who felt most said least, and some there, Parson Lilliston particularly, felt too full to find words to express himself to -the members of his flock, who knowing his deep interest, and of course gratification at' the noble stand just taken for the church, looked up to him with pleased faces. - Some others, whose feelings were near the surface, were either loud in commending the speech, or in berating as a mean set the parson-haters. One class walked away sulkily and moodily. It was evident that the resolution adopted and acted upon with- such praiseworthy singleness by Mr. Delafield, like every other which faith puts forth, trusting in a Supreme Power to bless, had attained its end in part, if not fully. Some members by it were now shaken in their determination to vote for the bill. A second class were ashamed of their past pusillanimity, not made manifest to them before, and resolved not to be so backward hereafter. A  third set judged that it would be advisable to try another, but less objectionable bill; perhaps it might do. The Governor's party-had he a party now?-were alarmed and disconcerted. On Romanists and enemies of the established church they could count; could they count on each other? It was agreed by them to hold a caucus, we would say, if the word caucus was then known. But they agreed to have one more meeting, and that night, at the Governor's. i'   EFFECT OF DELAFIELD'S SPEECH.      239 Parson Gordon and Montrose entered the State House gallery after Mr. Delafield had commenced his speech. The first heard him out in his argument with heartfelt and grate- ful pleasure; the latter -did more; his eyes involuntarily filled with tears of joy in discovering in his father a speaker who dared to plant himself in the way of the enemies of the church, and so nobly was doing battle in her behalf; and he heard him to the close of the afternoon session with increas- ing satisfaction, and had but two regrets at the time; one, that he could not stand with him in so righteous a cause, and the second that his friend Shepard, being absent, had not been roused to put forth his best faculties in aid of the clergy. Parson Gordon did not attend the afternoon session, feeling satisfied that even were Mr. Delafield able to dis- course as a seraph he must have help to stop effectually the ball of misrule which had been started in the House; and B so persuaded, he denied himself the pleasure of the after- noon session to do his best in the interim to bring succour to his friend, Mr. Delafield, on the morrow. i-    y        \    CHAPTER XXIX. SHEPARD S ADDRESS-SPEECH, AND THE CONSEQBUENCES. "Safe from the bar, the pulpit, and the throne, Are touched and sham'd by ridicule alone." *WHLE   the debate just mentioned was in progresPs. WHLE the debate just mentioned was in progress. Shepard was neither an uninterested nor idle observer of events. Without being present, he knew, from the reports which came to him, all that passed, and his friends, seeing the interest he evidently felt, could not understand his unwonted silence. Shepard, however, keeping his own counsel, mixed daily out of doors with all parties, and, though not of the cabal, was as familiar as any of the governor's partisans with their proceedings. Whitter and his " choice spirits" were won by Shepard's audacity, ready wit, and well counterfeited bluntness; and from some of them he extracted all he wished to know of the wire-pulling behind the curtain at the governor's, and regretted he could not know all that Romish craft had concocted. "The time has now come for decisive action," said Shepard, soliloquizing, " on the part of the friends of the parsons," and he turned over repeatedly the pages of a translation of Macchiavelli's Prince, as if he would catch from this inexplicable woik some insight into the means proper to be adopted in his quandary. While thus musing, and irresolute what to do, he heard a rap at his door. He opened it. I "The very man," said Shepard, greeting Parson Gordon, "that can best relieve me from my uncertainty," smiling, as, he spoke, and then giving him a hearty welcome. "Time presses," replied Parson Gordon. "You can do good service-for the Church of Christ if you will act- now, and for her." "The very thing," replied Shepard, "I was pondering, (240)    DIALOGUE.         241 but how?" and he looked as if it was his sincere wish to act for the parsons. HIow? how?" said Parson Gordon, amazed that he should ask so simple a question, "there is but one way. Go to the house at once, and exert your every talent in averting from the clergy this Star Chamber court;" laying his hand on Shepard, and seeking to take him with him to the State House. "Gently," said Shepard, courteously resisting Parson Gordon's efforts. "Will your reverence instruct me in this most important, and, as you say, most apparent how?" Parson Gordon seemed indignant at this seeming trifling, and-manifest reluctance. Shepard discovered it, and before he could reply, hastened to aid, "What argument, sir, can I use which these parson-haters will understand?" and bowing as he spoke, "I have no wish to sing a lullaby to a sleeping audience." "They will have light enough into the law of the case from Mr. Delafield's speech," said Parson Gordon, musing as he spoke. ' "'Twill be as idle to reason with them. Many of these law-makers care as little for reason as law." "It would seem so," mused Parson Gordon, sadly. "No doubt of it," evidently anxious to acquit himself of the suspicion of being unwilling to do what he might for the parsons. "Allow me to say, your reverence, that, with very few exceptions, even those sermons only are listened to in which reason nods that the audience may keep awake, and in which declamation roars to keep them entertained. And it is no less so in political or parliamentary speeches." "Mr. Shepard," interrupted Parson Gordon, "I said time presses; the how or way to sway the house no one knows oetter than yourself; far as human ability can sway it. The clergy may have iron collars fastened about their necks, when you and I are discussing how we may prevent it. The power to wield efficiently your talents can come only from God. Be advised. Throw yourself in the way-lift no un- certain voice---leav'e untried no fair means to kill this bill before the house-act at once, and I have no fears." , "Bless me," said Shepard, amazed, "he is gone, and his words have hardly been uttered, If I must, I must," and he put on his hat, and was going out. "Zounds," he added, looking out of the window, " the house has adjourned, rOL. II.-21   242        PILATE AND HEROD. What has been done? No time is to be lost. Fool!" mut- tered he, walking up and down his room; " how can I face that noble man? how present myself before Annie? how encounter Miss Emma, the impersonation o/f inflexible virtue? I have waited too long, I fear." And, after-muttering self. reproaches for some time, he continued, 'Well, fortune may yet favour me. And, as the how is so plain, when law and reason are not to be tried, what then? Strike about me right and left with the lash of ridicule? But," hesita- ting as he added, "he who lashes, should keep the refrac- tory ones, that are to be driven to measures, in terrorem; and to do this my words ought to be caustic as frozen mer- cury, withering as the simoon, and chilling as the north- westcr, and piercing as the invisible point of the fabulous spear. And then, then," musing as he spoke, "comfortable thought! the loon, who can't retort by an air-bullet, may by a leaden one. This is cheering. It will impose on me the necessity of finishing by a second mode of homicide him whom th first mode did not kill altogether." He sat awhile, perplexed as to the mode of procedure to be adopted, evidently anxious to do, yet not willing to makes a venture where the chances of success were doubtful. His hesitancy, however, rose not from timidity. He belonged, to that genus humana who, according to Flaccus, is audax omnia perpeti, and once committed on a matter he would have hurried per vetitum et nefas. But Shepard's pride was a predominant feature in his character. His voice had swayed that lower house of assembly almost at will. Suc- cess -was identified with his advocacy of a cause or measure. But past success, while it taught him to rely on his powers, made him value his reputation as the master spirit in the assembly too much to put it at hazard, either for light causes, or where it seemed to be close on to madness to make an Wffort. "No," continued he, " it is better to laugh as did Horace, than bite as did Juvenal. I may win where I can't drive. Coaxing will do much, much, and then, when the legislative beast becomes stubborn, a little goading may force him on." He mused thoughtfully on the plan to be pursued, and at length, much to his relief, determined upon one, and with his accustomed alacrity and vigour, resolved to push it to the end. "This will do," said he, seating himself and 'rapidly   DIALOGUE.          243 writing a number of notes, "Divide et impera." He called a servant, and despatched him with command to hasten back with the answers. He then sent for the landlord, and gave him some orders, and received the promise that his wishes would be, promptly obeyed. This was hardly done before Montrose entered the room, .spoke in raptures of Mr. Dela- field's speech, and, much excited, said: it Now's the time if you mean to do any thing." "Festina lente-hasten on, but hasten wisely," said Shepard. "The governor's party," continued Montrose, " meet to- night. The friends of the clergy are roused to action; much as the governor and Lawyer Brief plot together;" but, seeing the work of Macchiavel lying on the table open, he continued, " at such a time you are reading the odious book of that odious Florentine!" "Exactly," replied Shepard. "Well, Mr. Diplomatist," gaid Montrose, indignantly, "I suppose you mean to entrap the parson-haters, by waiting here in your chamber till they have caught the parsons in their toils; intending then, like the rat in the fable, to make a hole for the lion to get out. A bright invention this!" "I mean,' replied Shepard, drily, "to have Colonel Smithson, Mr. Delafield', here his voice trembled, "Colo- nel Elzey from Somerset, Whitter, and a few others here this evening, to give me their opinion on some as good Bur- gundy as that, with which their holinesses, at Avignon, solaced their Babylonish captivity." l"Inexplicable man," muttered Montrose, with difficulty repressing his rising indignation, and hastily leaving the room. No sooner had he-retired, than a servant entered, saying the room was prepared for Mr. Shepard's guests; not omit- ting to mention the hampers of Burgundy and champagne, which were no inconsiderable part of the entertainment. The servant also announced the arrival of Colonel Elzey of Somerset. This worthy was "A fine old English gentleman, All of the olden time."   V He resided on the Manokin, in Somerset county, and his mansion was justly famous on the Eastern Shore for its profuse and elegant hospitality. His stalwart frame, health-   Att       PILATE AND IIEROD. beaming face, quick and vigorous step, proved that he had snuffed in a large stock of health on the green fields of merry England. "Most welcome, Colonel," said Shepard. I have busi- ness for your ear only." And the two retired toa corner of the room, and, after talking in an undertone for some time, Shepard said, "You understand?" "Certainly," replied Colonel Elzey; "and here is my hand, friend Shepard, and, if they could aid in the good cause, I would add, here's my purse and sword too. But these fellows are too well drilled to be led into the ambush. Hate and craft are hard to come round." "Trust me for that," said Shepard. "You be mum. We'll blow no trumpets to give them notice." Colonel Smithson then entered, and Shepard, having un- folded his views, received his promise of cooperation. At last about a dozen prominent members had been greeted by their host, Whitter entering the last, and Mr. Delafield being the only person bidden who did not make his appear- ance. Shepard, as much as he valued his father, was not sorry for this. His assurance might not have been proof, against the presence of a father, whom he had abandoned in the wilfulness of youth. Whitter was surprised, though not sorry to be in company so select. He preferred Shepard's invitation to one from the governor; tempted by the hope of bacchic revelry; and he felt it to be no small honour to be one of a coterie which embraced the talent and aristocracy of the assembly. After supper cards were introduced, a few games played, and then, rich old Burgundy, fine October, four years in the bottle, and sparkling champagne, were drank. With well counterfeited simplicity, Shepard asked when they meant to dispose of the parson's trap. ' I am waiting its passage very patiently."  Whitter, finding the rest silent, took it upon him to re- ply, that the bill would have been passed that day, but for Mr. Delafield's speech, which had thrown confusion into the house. "You mean to pass it?" asked Shepard. Whitter assented.  Colonel Smithson then said, he spoke for himself, but Wesumed that the bill, after Mr. Delafield's speech, would not become a law without a fight over it.   THE MEETING.         245 Shepard, with the same affeeted simplicity, asked, "Can we not bury the hatchet, and have Whitter and his friends, and Colonel Smithson, and Colonel Elzey and their friends, all in the same battalion?" Colonel Elzey said that his friends and himself could not vote for a bill which would make a pope of the governor of the Province, and give all power to Romanists and Qualers. If so ridiculous a court be desired, let it consist of four laymen whom the as- sembly shall appoint." "So say I, and I, and I," responded every one but Whit- ter and Shepard. "True," continued Shepard, ironically, ' we may not have a Governor Seymour always. Now, I think, we might agree on Colonel Elzey's modification. For I'm anxious to get away from Annapolis. "What say you, Whitter?" filling that-worthy's glass, and forcing down him three or four glasses, in quick succession. "Call you not this an olive branch?". Whitter gave an equivocal assent. "But who," continued Shepard," are to be these four laymen? Hang me, gentlemen, if I'm not half inclined to turn out and electioneer for the place." Whitter's face red- dened as if he had the same thought. Colonel Smithson ob- served it, and hastened to say: '(The court must be composed of men well versed in canon law. The clergy are governed by canons while we are controlled by acts of Parliament and of Assembly." "True," said Shepard, "what know friend Whitter and I, and you also, colonel," turning to Colonel Elzey, and these gentlemen here, about the canons of grave bishops, and doc- tors? We understand something about the other sort of cannon, and I know enough of them to know the less occa- sion there is for them the better." "Friend Whitter here, too," and Shepard smiled as he continued, "knows all about the Scripture canon. He can tell Whether Job lived in the time of Methusaleh or of the Maccabees." "Hang me," said Whitter, interrupting him, "if I know, or care the difference between the Maccabees and Beelzebub. I have often heard of the land of Nod, and that that mur- derer, Cain, went there, and found a wild woman, whom he took for his wife." ' 21*   :24       PILATE AND HEROD. "1I have great hopes of you, Whitter," said Colonel Smith. son. "I see you read your Bible sometimes." "Yes;" said Shepard laughing, " and when he does, like Cain he gets into land of Nod himself; but, being a married man, I presume does not go a wife hunting. Besides," continued Shepard, "there is a kind of law called canon law, and made up of rules taken from the Bible, the decrees of church councils, bulls of the pope and the like, and they make three immense volumes. A man might carry them in his arms. I should deline the attempt to carry them in my head. By these the clergy are to be tried." "You must excuse me, too," said Whitter, "if the par- sons can't be set right, without my turning a plagued puri- tan with a testament sling to my girdle, or a Jesuit priest with my head full of the pope. They may hunt and play cards as much as they please; so that they will not be pok- ing at me their advice till it is asked, and let me curse when I want to." "But they can be tried no other way," said Shepard gravely, seeing that his remarks were beginning to have the effect intended on Whitter. "I propose, therefore, if the parsons must be tried, that the speaker of the house, or some members of our body, or two or three of the ablest of the clergy, examine all persons who may be candidates for a seat in this court; if they approve themselves qualified, that the examiners select four persons to compose the court." Whit- ter hung his head for a few minutes, and then muttered, "The devil a bit of a court shall we have. I am not such an ass as to pretend to know any thing about this Jack priest and puritan parson law."  " know as little," said Shepard, overhearing him, and hoping by chiming in with Whitter to carry him alongxwith him. "We'll let those who do, take care of the parsons." But come, gentlemen, we will drop the subject now. Wine has failed to enlighten us into the proper course to be pur- sued, perhaps a song will do, colonel," addressing himself to Colonel Elzey, "fill your glass, and pass it round, and then give us'something good in the song way." "By all means," said Colonel Smithson, "I'll help my good friend from Somerset if he will give us the ' Hey for the old Cavaliers.'" 'I second that," said Whitter, "and I'll help out the chorus. "And so will I, and I," said others. Colonel Elzey   COLONEL ELZEY'S SONG.         247 did not wait to be further persuaded, but sang as follows: "One bumper yet gallants at parting, One toast to the cause we love best; Here's health to the King and) his army, Confusion to old Noll and his nest, The canting, covenanting ScOtch, A disloyal hypocritical sect, Like Judas, they sold for base lucre, The King they swore to protect, Then hey for the old Cavaliers, Then ho for the old Cavaliers, Let every good knight, that loves a good cause, Fill round to the old cavaliers." "Ay, ay," said Whitter, repeating the last line of the song, "Fill round to the old cavaliers," and he passed the bottle round, after having filled his own glass. "But this is not all," said Colonel Smithson. "I think 1 have heard you sing another couplet." Colonel Elzey continued,- 'Why could we not keep with us ever, Those nobles in field and in hall? Who shouted like war-horse for battle, When glory or peril did call. No, ne'er let their memory perish; But green in our hearts may it be, As gold that use cannot tarnish, As the foam that whitens the sea. Then hey for the old cavaliers, Then ho for the old cavaliers, Let every good knight that loves a good cause, Fill round to the old cavaliers." "A merry set in Mr. Shepard's room," said the landlord below. "Colonel Elzey always brings merry times with him, go where he will." "Yes, yes," said one of the loiterers at the bar,  he's not ashamed to drink with a poor man, and though no man can boast purer blood, and he's rich, and a great feaster too, there's always a place at his table for a clever fellow if he aint got more than a shirt to his back, and his breeches on." Other songs were sung, which, hitting hard on the( in- trigues of the Papists, wherein Guy Fawkes, and James II. were represented as enemies alike to the church and people of England, had the effect, together with that of "hey foi the old cavaliers," of working on Whitter.   248       PILATE AND HEROD. ' These cavalierS were all great friends to the parsons," said Colonel Smithson. "The cause of the king, the church, and of every gentleman or freeborn Englishman in the days of our fathers was the same." "No doubt of that," said Colonel Elzey, with an earnest manner. "My grandfather gave his plate cheerfully, even to the old Fzey christening bowl, to help the cause of the unfortunate king, Charles I. I served with the new mem- ber from Calvert, Mr. Delafield, whose speech to-day has put the good cause on its legs once more, under King William, in Ireland, against Tyrconnel, and his popish sovr- reign. When I see a, Puritan, I see the king brought to the block, and canting troopers lording it over gentlemen. When I see a Papist I see good Alchbishop Sancroft and the five bishops in the Tower, and dumb masses and mum- meries taking place of the noble service of our Prayer Book. I love the cavaliers. I go for the parsons." The colonel rose as he spoke, and took two' or three strides down the room: '"I never saw a fellow yet with the cold blood of a frog who was not a whining, wheezy Puritan, and parson-hater. I cannot see a Papist, that I do not see' either treachery in his eye, or a hateful and hellish purpose." Shepard touched him,--the colonel paused a moment, and then pointing to a spider on the wall, who had caught his net full of flies, he continued: "There is Mr. Jesuit at;work. Gentlemen, shall we help him to put the clergy in his toils?" Whitter felt this, and his eye said he agreed with the colonel. Shepard then plied him on another side, remarking, that Puritan preachers were always on the strong side of a man's wife, and often obliged him, not only to hear a preachment of two hours, but, in,his words, so prime and load his wife that she must follow her husband up, and, beginning at chapter and verse, must ding dong it into his ears; Inor is she then content, unless he, good, easy man, takes his seat Sunday morning, and sings a long' psalm, and says a tediously-long prayer before breakfast; next accompanies her to the conventicle, talking and thinking all the way about the last preachment, and what a saint is the preacher!" "Yes, by the powers, and old Noll to help him too," said   THE MEETING.         249 Whitter, fairly roused, "that is so. Dame Whitter worries my life out exactly so. It is all an eternal jabber about good Mr. Smoothtongue; and, hang me, if it is not to get short of such gentry as him that I want an ecclesiastical court." "Precisely," said Shepard, " and that is what we want;  we won't quarrel like Greedy and the Cook,* whether the Norfolk dumpling be in the fawn's belly or in the dish, so we have the dumpling after all. If we nab the parson, that friend Whitter and I think should be at the tail of a plough, and not holding forth from a pulpit, it matters not that the governor's capacious belly be the court, or the court consist of four laymen, to be appointed by the honourable Assem- bly." They all assented, and the company, having retired, Whitter excepted, who lagged behind to take perhaps a last taste of the good liquor before him,--Shepard, after having gratified his longing, in a low tone talked to him for some time, till he had worked Whitter up to the state he wished to bring about,-ignorant and violent men being ever the tools of those who can keep their own counsel, and have ends to serve; and generally are more easily controlled by them at the very time these men of violence think they are only acting out their own wishes. "You don't tell me," said Whitter, vehemently, " that that crop-eared son of a squeaking pig-- " "Your especial friend," interrupted Shepard, "Mr. All- grease." "Him," continued Whitter, "twho was soused in the horse-pond; that he, the scamp, is leagued with Governor Seymour in urging this bill?" "He's the man," replied Shepard. "How would you like to have him and the like installed as rector and rectors in the different parishes?" Whitter looked vexed and asked, "That's the game they're driving at, eh? I've been to their meetings. ,But old Seymour said nothing of this." "Not to you, of course," replied Shepard. "He keeps the secrets for Captain Fendall and the godly. He and they plan, and they and theirs reap all the benefit. You and your friends are put off on fine speeches to pay you for being * See Ford's Play, "A New Way to pay Old Debts."   ZOU        PILATE AND HEROD. the hewers of wood and drawers of water to the godly. You and yours are not good enough to be admitted into the cabi- net council of the saints." Whitter began to vow he would break at once, and his friends also, with the governor. "Don't be in a hurry," said Shepard, in a tone and man. ner which only the more irritated, "you are aware what a clever man Mr. Allgrace is. He would talk so feelingly that your wife and daughter would be crazy after him. He might even effect a complete conversion of you, Whitter." Whitter could stand it no longer, but almost raved. "Be cool," continued Shepard. "I want no more," said Whitter, rising and clenching his fist. "I'll see Nichols, Randall, White, and Brown, and may I be flayed alive and then salted if I don't," and away he hastily retired. Shepard laughed, and then walked out.   He passed by the governor's house, and, from the lights there, inferred that his party were still in session. "There is rottenness in Denmark,' said Shepard.   He came by St. Anne's church. "What means this, old man?" asked Shepard.  "Surely no church to-night." "Yes, massa, church," replied the sexton.   "Parson Henderson, and a powerful and mighty arnest preacher he, from Prince George, he preach serment.*   Parson Jones from Calvert read, and Parson Trotter from Somerset pray. But no much people here." "Any members?" asked Shepard. * The Rev. Jacob Henderson lived in what is now known as "the forest of Prince George county." A few years after the time referred to in the text, 1716, at the recommendation of Governor Hart and the Ma- ryland clergy, he was appointed by the, bishop of London Commissary for the Western Shore. In 1718 he was inducted by Governor Hart into the rectorship of Queen Anne parish. He continued in charge for thirty- two years, succeeding the Rev. Jonathan White, who had been inducted into it by Governor Seymour. Mr. Henderson endeavoured faithfully to discharge his duties as commissary, and succeeded in restoring dis- cipline among the clergy. He and his lady, who was a Miss Duvall, and wealthy,gave the ground for, and caused to be erected, a chapel of ease to Queen Anne parish. This chapel is now the chapel of the Holy Tri- nity in the parish of the same name, Prince George county. It is be- lieved by some, on what authority I know not, that they also gave a Glebe farm of about two hundred acres, which included the chapel and retory, but said farm is not now in the possession of the parish. How and'when the vestry parted with it, if they ever had it, remains yet to be known.: The reader is referred to Huck s History as above, who pays a high and merited compliment to Mr. Henderson for his zeal, energy, singleness of devotion to the church, and uncompromising and fearless prosecution of his duties.  alid S mS ^ ^^^^^^^^   MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY.      251 "Yes, massa/g said the sexton, "  massa Delafield from Calvert, him what make big speech for de parsons." What is this all for?" asked Shepard. "Why, massa, our minister ax people last Sunday to pray hard and fast, and 'plore God to save de church, and he 'point sarvice to-night, for dem ministers 'spected." "What did Parson Henderson preach about?" "Ah! massa make fun of poor nigger,' he said. "By no meands" continued Shepard. "What was his text?" "Massa!" said the sexton, not sorry to be asked "Parson Henderson say, 'Let God rise up, and his enemies clear out. Let what hate him run away.' And oh! such a sarment!" And the sexton proceeded to sayihow his minister wiped his eyes with his handkerchief, and how Mrs. Smith, who was one of the pillars of the congregation, said she could have sot, and listened to the dear blessed man all the whole night out. And the sexton added, " all feel mighty bad, massa; afeard de governor make massa Lilliston go away." Shepard walked on. "The train is laid," he said, "and it is soon to be fired off." The morrow came, and, in good time, the members were in their places. But they did notlook as they had done the day before when they met for business. In place of an air of triumph on the faces of the governor's party, and the members who were in the Roman and Quaker and Dissent- ing interest, there was a cloud of gloom, anxiety, and per- plexity. They had reckoned too coafidently on success. They had expected by the force of clambur, baseless rumours, prejudiced statements, bitter denunciations, without even a plausible argument, to carry a Star Chamber bill against an unprotected, much maligned, and inoffensive body of men. The speech of a new member, setting forth the law, facts, and merits of the case, and delivered in a fitting manner, had carried dismay into the ranks of the hodge podge anti- clerical alliance. And now they had just heard that Mr. Shepard meant to give them his views. His name was a host. What if he should follow on the same side with Mr. Delafield. Demades was reputed one of the most eloquent of the Greeks, but not one sentence is extant of any of his . speeches. Mr. Pitt wished above all things for a speech of Lord Bolinghroke, the most brilliant speaker in either house of Parliament. It may be well, however, for Demades and   252     ,  PILATE AND HEROD. Bolinghroke that no record has been kept of their speeches. Shepard's effort cannot be done justice to in any description. As he rose to speak; "Who is he for?" asked a Quaker in the gallery, of a bystander. "Dost thee know, friend?" "No," answered the person asked, "and no one else. He'll say what he thinks, and the hardest fend off." "Yes, and that aint all," joined in a third, " and when he speaks you'd think a trumpet was sounding. But, hush!" Shepard's person was tall, but, till the words, "Mr. Speaker," had past his lips, the members were in such con- fusion, sitting or standing, that he was not seen. No sooner, however, had he spoken them, than a dead silence was in ! the house. Every one was in his seat. All eyes were turned to him. His tones were rich, full, and round, while his person appeared graceful and commanding. "When a traveller is; bewildered in a dense forest with roads to the right and left likely to mislead, and a mist and driving storm obscures the route, he either waits for the fog to clear away, or till, by due consideration, he has decided which road it becomes him to take. I am thus bewildered, and must crave the indulgence of the house till I have cleared away a portion, at least, of the fog which invests the subject before us." After briefly adverting to the fact that only two of the speakers-Colonel Smithson and Mr. Delafield-had argued the case, while the rest had spoken as if the question of the necessity of -an ecclesiastical court were already settled, the cry being, "Down with the parsons," and each speaker being anxious to swell the cry, and ring changes upon it, Shepard presented a brief and pithy summary of Mr. Dela- field's argument, and of the law and reason bearing on the case. "While the clamour, therefore,". he said, " is enough to confuse, there seems to be light by which we may find the way in our bewilderment, and, as Demosthenes said, 'to censure is ins the power of every man, while the true counsellor would point out what the present exigence de- mands,' it is proper we should ask why' down with the parsons ' Is this the cure to our supposed evil? this the way out of our perplexity? Should we, then, 'down with the parsons?'  He paused, as if truly anxious for an answer' to his ques- tion. The members looked at each other as if each one   SHEPARD S SPEECH.        253 might read the answer in his neighbour's face; and "the parson haters" looked as if they wondered at so simple a question. "Is it," continued Shepard, "because the parsons are more corrupt than the priests? for we hear no cries of, down with the Jesuit priests." "( He's getting on the right key," said Montrose to Parson Gordon. "4lMy education," proceeded Shepard, "may have been very defective; but I was taught that the see of Rome was a cave of spiritual despotism; where no' light penetrates, frcedom is a name, religion a drivelling superstition, where padlocks are made for the mind, and the keys of which are kept by an Italian prelate, who sits at the entrance its grim and inexorable porter." As Shepard spoke, as if by acci- dent, he threw his glance up to the gallery; and, following it, the audience saw Father Hunter, with his cloudy brow, looking the very embodiment of the Roman prelate he refer- red to. The effect was magical, and Shepard, availing him- self of it, turned to the advantage of the parsons this pre- judice against the Roman priests. "But perhaps," proceeded Shepard, with well counter- feited ignorance, "the parsons are ,supposed by some to be less enlightened than Quaker preachers, Dissenters, and Nonconformist exhorters." "I do not say that friend Quaker's broad-brim symbolizes the shadow which the pre- judices of a sect make about him, shutting out from -him the glorious light of learning, which beams from England's Church, and her clergy." Here Shepard's voice had that ironical inflexion which made a laugh almost inevitable. "Friend, thee has an awkward way of praising us," muttered a Quaker in the gallery. "Nor do I say," continued Shepard, 'that the grum and soured aspect of the Puritan is not an exact reflection of the face of the Master above, which outshineth the morn- ing star, and is radiant with love." Fendall raised this head, and the' comic expression of Shepard's face, aided by a most ludicrous tone of voice, shocked him exceedingly; while most of the audience enjoyed the scene as keenly as they would have done a well acted farce. It was manifest to the house that on the score of ignorance there was no ground to say of the clergy, it Down with the parsons," for their learning cast into the VOL. nI.-22   254       PILATE AND HEROD. shade the Puritan and the Quaker. And it was also mani- fest that, on the score of personal piety, the clergy of Eng- land's Church should not be decried, for they greatly sur- passed in godliness the Jesuit priests. And, by graphic contrasts, Shepard made so apparent the superior virtue and learning of the parsons that the cause of "the parson- haters" seemed to be about to kick the beam. The advo- cates of the bill discovered this result, and Lawyer Brief, nervously apprehensive of it, and Captain Fendall, who felt that, to be silent longer would be unpardonable, both inter- rupted Shepard, and asked if they might be permitted to ask him a question. Shepard bowed assent, and Brief, as plainly as he dared, intimated that the learning of the Jesuit priests exceeded that of the clergy of the Church of England; and thinking such a statement left no answer, Brief looked proudly around the room as he seated himself. Fendall next rose, and with a tone and manner strickingly characteristic, attempted to show, that "the parsons may have more of this world's wisdom than devoted men who seek the lost sheep, without waiting for a bishop to send them; but ah! have they the pearl of great price, the pure' and undefiled religion, which is vastly, vastly valuable?" A smile passed over Shepard's face, and he looked pro- vokingly pleased at the interruption. "I thank the gentlemen," he continued, "for their sug- gestions, and rise to act upon them. Far be it from me to deny to Jesuit priests the honour!6f unequalled superiority in craft and intrigue; or to charge them with having made even one philosopher by their learning, or one saint by their piety, whose life was more fragrant than his bones after dis- interment. Did not the Jesuits discover a morality which will bend to all circumstances? Have they not ascertained that the way of salvation is to believe every thing, and do nothing?  Certainly," and he smiled very graciously on Attorney Brief, who wished most heartily he had let him alone. "Mr. Speaker, I hope to be the last man who can be so ungrateful as not to own my obligations to the Jesuits for lengthening the creed, and lopping off from the deca- Ibgue."         :  "The sinner," muttered Father :Hunter in the gallery. What cares he how many articles the Catholic Church has added to the faith, or that she has stricken out the second commandment, as Protestants read, against image worship?"   SHEPARD'S SPEECH.        255 And the father threw hurried glances around the house to see whether these remarks were favourably received. Did not the Jesuits," continued Shepard, " convince the Chinese that Jesus Christ and Confucius taught the same thing, and must have been the same person? Wonderful men are they! By most ingenious arguments they prove that adultery is no sin, provided at the time we are acted upon by lust; that murder is very excusable, if tumultuous passion gives the dagger, and says, Strike; for, mark the ad- mirable depth of these reasoners, in- all these cases, we are beside ourselves, and, therefore, not free or accountable agents." Some one now touched Brief on the shoulder, and he was seen to go out, and Father Hunter retiring from the gallery, the two were seen talking together in the outer chamber. "The coast is not yet clear of fogs," said Montrose to Parson Gordon, "if the priest and attorney can get up a mist." "I am very sorry," replied Parson Gordon in a low tone, "that friend Shepard does not wield rather the open club of truth, than extend a hand to shake, while he strikes with a dagger. 'Tis a pity, Mr. Montrose, that so serious a subject as the rights and characters of the clergy, by the way of handling it, should awaken bad passions." "I have no wish, either," proceeded Shepard, looking gra- ciously on Captain Fendall, who began to think that he had been passed over, because his remarks were unanswerable, "to deny the Puritan preachers all due praise for piety in a way not attempted even by the parsons." "Hum i" muttered Fendall, pricking up his ears as a horse does when he hears a noise. "What is he at now?" And, instead of caustic comparisons, whichblistered where they fell, with a face radiant with glee, he gave a graphic de- scription of a Puritan conventicle, in which he painted to the life their nasal intonations at their prayers; remarking that in this particular, perhaps, they differed from the Pharisees; for he was " not aware that the Pharisees' trumpet, like the Puritans' trumpet, gave forth a nasal sound." He hit off most humourously their affectations of simplicity. Here," said he, "is Puritanism in its best, most intelligible, most taking, and unmistakable demonstrations. He prays, and if every wild animal in Ncah's ark, (the lion excepted,) had uttered its voice at once, the noise could not have been more   256,       PILATE AND HEROD. unmusical. Surely, Gabriel, the archangel, leans over the parapet of heaven to catch thedulcet strains of devotion, and pass them unchanged in any tone or note to the merey seat. The prayers of Job, Daniel, Jeremiah, and the Apostles never made such a clatter, nor so threatened to take the heavens by violence. The soft low prayer of the contrite sinner, and the tclear unbroken tones of the simple child never so be- sieged -the mercy seat." And thus good humouredly excoriating, as far as his voice and manner indicated, he more effectually put down the Puri- tans than any argument, however elaborate, could have done. Laughter was irresistible'; and Shepard let the house give way to this feeling, and then, with deep solemnity, he asked, ' Why down with the parsons? Must we, to' gratify an affected zeal for purifying the sons of, Levi, create a court, which, having the governor for its head, will degrade his excellency into a broker of parish livings; which will sun- der ties between pastor and people that are thegrowth of years, and commission contemptible spies to circulate in a parish to hunt up evidence against the parson, thereby destroying the usefulness and wearing out the patience of even the most deserving clergyman? A lion may be stung to madness and then to death by a little poisonous reptile that is concealed in his man6. And, who that' knows any thing of the finesse; intrigue, address, management, and unconquerable and daily accumulative energy of the Jesuit, does not know that, let the hope be held out that, on cer-o tain information being laid, before an ecclesiastical court,- the rector 'in any parish will be dismissed the same, and Jesuits will be found able, ready, and resolute to effect his discharge, and the ruin of the Protestant Church in that place."  And Shepard painted the wire-working, and the wicked and crafty intriguing which had been set in motion through- out the province in order to tell at that assembly. He spoke of Irish priests and Irish Papists, openly or dis- guised, circulating in every parish, and on some plea or other seeking to obtain the ear of every member of that house. "And shall we," he asked, offer a premium to Jesuitism?- to that most dangerous incarnation of the evil one, which knows all disguises and can assume all shapes. To-day it may openlygvaunt its Catholicism, to-morrow it will cover itself under a specious liberality. To one person it pro-   SHEPARD'S SPEECH.        257 fesses to speak plainly, to another it whispers sub rosa. It will enter your house by the front door, or if prudent it will come in by a secret ladder. "The bill," he added, " will give such wily foes to your national religion every means of surely ruining you." The moral force of these and the like words gave dignity to his position, made his ridicule tell the more, and so weighed with the house, that Whitter, his friends, and others, now debated whether they should not lay the whole matter on the table, or adopt a middle course, which, while professing to deal out even-handed justice to the parsons, protected them. Shepard sagaciously chose the latter alternative, and moved an amendment to the bill, striking out the words, "the governor and his council," and inserting " four per- sons who shall be appointed by this Assembly." "A pretty amendment this," sai4 the governor's party. "His excellency is to be thrown overboard. The court will be a cipher without him. We shall lose every thing by this motion;" and they became fearful lest the amendment would pass. The friends of the church greeted the motion as a happy di- version to the course legislation before seemed likely to take. "Any court will be a monstrosity," said Parson Gordon to Montrose; " but the design :to lay the clergy at the feet of Governor Seymour and the Romanists will be foiled by it." The most intense interest was manifested while the vote was taking, and, as the speaker was about to announce the result, some held their breath, lest their breathing might prevent their hearing it. "This scene," said Colonel Smithson to Colonel Elzey, "reminds me of the debate in the House of Lords, (her Majesty being present, about three years ago,) in the perils which menaced the Church of England." "Yes," said Colonel Elzey, "Lords Rochester and -Hali- fax, and Bishops,Compton and Burnet, and others, took part in it." Shepard's amendment was carried. - Fendall's jaw dropt on his bosom. Chagrin was visible on the faces of the Pu- ritans,-more than chagrin on those of the Papists,--while the clapping of hands in the gallery by the ladies, and a 22*   258.       PILATE AND HEROD. hearty cheering by others, bespoke the joy of those who wished well to the parsons. Shepard next moved, that Colonel Smithson, Colonel Elzey, Mr. Delafield, and Mr. James Holt, esquire, consti- tute the court. This motion was also carried, and the chagrin of the Pu- ritaps and Papists could not be repressed. Captain Fendall rose, and let out his vexation by harping on the woris "apostolic pedigree," which, he said, was all that the parsons could claim; and this claim he treated as a modern discovery. The member from Worcester also, boiling over with vexa- tion, attempted to draw a comparison between the worldly deportment and manners of the clergy, and the meek, saint- like, and demure carriage and bearing of the Puritan preachers. Shepard seemed to be much amused at these explosions, and, leaning towards Colonel Elzey, whose anti-puritan feel- ings he knew were strong, he said, "Give it tothem, colonel, right well laid on. No man handles a weapon better."l "No, no," replied the Colonel, in an under-tone. "You are more at home in this kind of cavalry duty than my. self." The member from Worcester had just seated himself. Shepard immediately took the floor, and in his happiest man- ner, congratulated the house on its prompt action, and ex- pressing his joy in knowing that so respectable a majority could unite in opinion, asked if he might be indulged a few minutes longer. "Leave! Leave!" resounded from all parts. Shepard bowed, and a smile lighted his face at this mark of the esti- mation in which he was held. A proud moment was it; for both the house and the lobby, crowded with spectators, waited anxiously to hear him. I beg pardon," he said, 'for having omitted to congra- tulate the house, on having in its body one, who, in vocal richness exceeds the Lake of Killarney. The lake has an echo which repeats forty times; but we have an honourable member who, once upon a time, had whispered to him the words 'Apostolic pedigree,' and which to-day he repeated so frequently that it-seemed he had but to open his mouth, and apostolic pedigree would be sounded forth. He thinks - -               ,   SHEPARDS REPLY. ,       259 an apostolic pedigree very foolish. This is not at all sur- prising; and he will not take it amiss that I explain why. Now, as my friend, Colonel Elzey, can trace the pedigree of his turf nag Gaily to dam'Juno, through sire Good Luck, and several sires on to old Famous, all good blood--even so, mine honest friend from Anne Arundel can trace his pedigree to Mrs. Faith and Mr. Godly Fendall, on through Elder -Sobersides and Deacon Holdfast to Patience Brown, and good Master Devout Fendall; the first of' the stock of which history makes mention." This was said in a manner so comic, that the house and lobby lost its gravity, and peals of laughter, to the great mortification of Captain Fendall, drowned all further re- marks for some minutes. The Puritan had listened ith far more than his usual attention, and his saturnine counte- nance had evinced more life than any present remembered to have seen on it; but at this point he rose, and, with a prim dignity, that was meant to be peculiarly impressive, walked gravely and slowly to the door. On reaching which, he turned, and raising his right hand slowly, like the ghost of Hamlet, he pointed it to-Shepard, and struggled for words to express his choler. "No thanks for the Captain,"-said Shepard, determined to twist the captain s manner into an effort to thank him for the way in which he alluded, to his ancestry. "I have spoken but the truth, and a pedigree so renowned should be proclaimed on the house tops." Fendall dropt his hand and head, and mortified and vexed beyond the power to express, retired, as another peal of laughter, at his ridiculous discomfiture, shook the house and lobby. The speaker's hammer rapped many times be- fore order was restored. "Allow me," continued Shepard, "farther to congratu- late the house on the rich gifts which seem to pertain to some among us; 'not of vocal harmony, and ancestral pedi- gree only, but also of unctuous qualities that characterize the inward man. While our parsons are said to play the Pharisee on Sunday only, we have a few in our body who play the Pharisee every day. Their Phariseeism is rich and running, like the oil on Aaron's beard, even to the skirts of their clothing." And thus excoriating for some time, and yet all in appa? rent good temper, Shepard forced the governor's party to hang    260       PILATE AND HEROD. their heads for shame, and provoked more than one angry threat, from the parties offended, to pay him for his taunts. Unfortunately Shepard heard one of these threats, and, though he meant here to have closed, and by an ingenious and appropriate peroration, on his ability to do which well, he felt, perhaps, a like pride with Tully-be was provoked to let himself out in yet further exposure and castigation of the Puritan members. "But can it be that Christ is betrayed when His ministers are supported? that He is betrayed when a tax is laid to make men do for Him and His what they would not do otherwise? that He is betrayed when learning, piety and devotion to His service are favoured by the State? It is a pity that these objectors have such tender consciences. It would be well if they resembled Judas in every particular. Like him they are charged with holding the bag, and loving what is put into it. Like him they are charged, from their anxiety to control church livings, with selling their Lord for the bag and its contents. Would it not be well if, Judas- like, now, when convicted of their base betrayal," and She- pard's voice as a trumpet in its clear and forcible clarion tones shook the house; 'they were considerate enough to go and hang themselves.'  The explosion of a-bomb could not have created a greater sensation, and many members rose from their seats; threats of violence were more than whispered; and Shepard's friends gathered around him to repel the attempts, if any, which might be made upon him. He, calm, collected, like a tower of strength, stood erect, and waiting for order to be resumed, surveyed the assembly, and then added: "Talk not of the price of an establishment. Our broad acres aind richest mansions, a thousand times told, could not pay the value to the State-of a church, on which the throne and parliament lean for their support; while the miserably me- gre tax, laid for its ministry, resembles the widow's mite that was thrown into the treasury of the temple, only in its smallness, and not in the devotion and singleness with which it is given." That evening, Shepard was walking alone on a back street in Annapolis, when, on coming to the corner of a street that intersected it, he discovered three persons masqued near the corner.   SHEPARD ATTACKED.        261 A What mean these fellows?" said ho, " no good," he was about to continue; "I'll keep a sharp lookout on them." "I Halt there," said one of the masques, and Shepard had just time to put himself in an attitude of defence, when he found himself assailed by the three, each one being armed with a sword. Shepard was a good swordsman, and perfectly at home in the science of fencing. He was besides, tall, muscular and active, and his assailants found him as a lion at bay, un- daunted and formidable. "Dog," said Shepard, as the foremost person masqued as- sailed him, parrying his thrust, and driving his sword into adversary's body, "take this as a love token." The assailant fell, and standing over him, Shepard found himself assailed by the two others, who fought with like desperation, hardly greater than their knowledge of the sword exercise. How to protect his person from two assailants, both attacking him at one time, was no small difficulty, and Shepard saw that artifice must now accomplish what skill and force could not. For his strength he was aware was tasked so heavily in parry- ing the dexterous passes which were made at, him, that he might be overborne by the unequal conflict. Feigning therefore to attack his adversary to the right, he, at the same moment that he appeared to direct his sword and at- tention that way, with a leap to the left, and a sudden strik- ing of his sword on his adversary's blade, disarmed him, and thus had but one to contend with. The masque who was disarmed, turned to fly. "Not so fast, my brave assassin," said a voice from behind; and Montrose, who was the speaker, closed upon him, and waving his blade menacingly, the person masqued fell on his knees and besought him to spare his life. "' No mercy to infidel dogs," cried Shepard, noticing all that passed, and pressing hard and furiously on the third person who still confronted him. The parties fought bravely. Shepard saw that he had wounded his enemy, and from his relaxed efforts was aware that his strength was nearly spent, but was vexed add indignant at his apparent contumacy. He pressed him closely, by pass upon pass,-repeated with in- creasing rapidity, and was in the act of driving his sword into his enemy's body, having discovered an unprotected part, when Montrose, who had extracted from the second masque a promise of submission, knocked aside Shepard's x .   ,    t   262       PILATE AND HEROD. sword; and by a blow well and smartly given to the blade of the third person masqued, he disarmed him. Shepard's face coloured with vexation for a foment, but soon com- manding himself, he placed the point of his blade at his an- tagonist's throat, saying-- "Your name and purpose before I send you to the shades." "Seymour," said the masque; and Shepard and Montrose, with amazement, recognized his excellency. "Who is this man?" said Shepard with some embarrass- ment, pointing to the second masque. "The member from Worcester," said the Governor, speak- ing with difficulty. "And the dog who lies there?" con- tinued Shepard, getting mad. "Captain Fendall," said the governor; as he spoke, rais- ing his friend, who, though bleeding freely, was not mor- tally wounded. "Your excellency and myself," said Shepard, holding his person very erect, " have either settled our difficulties, or but commenced them? Let me understand."  The gover- nor was silent. "If they end here," continued Shepard, " then the public is t? know nothing of this very honourable attempt of the governor of the province, aided by two fitting colleagues, to assassinate a member of the legislature for exercising a mem- ber's privilege. If not, then I shall avail myself of all means legal and otherwise, both to bring my would-be-assas- sins to justice, and to defend myself from their daggers; even though the hand of a colonial governor wields the poig- nard, and the assistants are members of the honourable as- sembly." The governor, mortified and vexed, was thankful, however, to get off on these terms; and, in a hurried manner, signified that their quarrel should end here; and seemed anxious to frame something of an apology for his shameful assault on Shepard, but the latter, waving his hand adieu, turned away, taking the arm Of Montrose, and, as he turned, he said, f Your excellency has heard me. Be careful not to for- get it." Shepard and-Montrose discussed, walking away, the singu- larity of the adventure. Shepard said his chief regret was that his blade had not done even better execution on the governor than it had on Fendall. "We will let this pass   THE GOVERNOR'S BALL.         263 for the present, Montrose, but old Seymour. never forgives, and I must take such steps about this matter as will enable me, whenever his excellency would try the like again, to bring him to justice. For, fenced as he is now by the coun- tenance of the powers at home, I might accomplish nothing in a legal process against him. It may not be so always." Seymour, and the member from Worcester, raised Captain Fendall, and bore him to his lodgings, glad that night cast its mantle over their deed of shame, and trembling lest Shepard might bring to light their nefarious attempt. The legislature did not continue long in session afterwards, and the bill, which we said'was so amended as to protect the parsons, by making the court consist of persons who were friendly to them, the governor refused to approve, alleging craftily that he doubted whether the powers at home would sanction it.* The governor was obliged to close the session with the usual ball; and, in order to lull suspicion, Shepard and Montrose were invited, who conducted themselves as if nothing had happened. But his excellency's face was clouded, and his partisans moved about the ball room, or sat moodily in groups more like men at a funeral than at a festive gather- ing. In the old comic romance galled the Hunting of the Hare, the cur dogs who were engaged, instead of catching the hare, fall upon each other, and while the hare escaped, a battle royal ensued, first between the dogs, and then be- tween their owners who were also on the field armed with clubs and bats. A result not unlike followed upon the attempt "to trap the parsons." The clergy, like the poor * As stated in the text, the idea of this ecclesiastical court bill came from South Carolina, and the result of this bill is truly stated by Mr. Delafield in his reply to Brief. Hildreth, in his History of the United States, vol. 2, p. 30, says, the bishop of London complained that the bill in South Carolina was a sacrilegious intrusion ori his episcopal rights, and the dissenters there denounced it as an iron chamber. Dr. Hawks, speaking of the spiritual court bill in Maryland, says, "The governor refused his assent to it, not on the ground, however, it was wrong in principle or was not called for by circumstances, but because he had no directions from home concerning the matter.' He says, further, that some clergymen ofrthe province immediately wrote to the bishop of London, representing that this bill would be establishing Presbyterian- ism in the colony upon the necks of the clergy, and raise an effectual barrier to the introduction of episcopacy. The result was, the aban- donment or non repetition of any further effort to pass a law so subver- sive of all right authority, so tyrannous and inquisitorial, and so dis- tasteful to the church and crown. Governor Seymour died the follow- ing year. Requiescat in pace! but to his intermeddling, and, as Dr. 1tawks states, " tohis pompous self-importance, the church was indebted for her prostration."   264        PILATE AND HEROD. hare, had little else to help them but Providence. Their enemies all joined in the hue and cry, but, like the hare, they broke through the ring which they had made. For the bill was so-amended that their enemies could not agree upon it, and the clergy escaped their cldtches. But not only were Governor Seymour, Captain Fendall, and the member from Worcester sufferers by the rencontre with Shepard in mortified pride and defeated malice, but personal rencontres ,took place between Whitter and one of the governor's party, and between others of Whitter's side and the governor's side, not with sword and pistol, but with fist and club. And this session was signalized by an exciting and tedious debate which ended in a bill that, wanting the governor's approval, did not become a law, and in many quarrels and fights between former friends and allies. The chagrin of the enemies of the clergy was great. They loved each other none the more for their failure. An alliance like that of Herod and Pontius Pilate could produce no good. Each charged the other with remissness and want of faith- fulness, and, as is usual with bad men, when leagued together to work mischief and they are disappointed, they hated each other even worse than the common object of hatred. They had kindled a fire around them, and this fire now circled none but themselves, the fire of deserved reproach, and, scorpion-like, when girt by fire, they turned their fangs upon themselves. Their regret surely was not a godly sorrow, but "the sorrow of the world which worketh death." The clergy had reason to thank God and take courage. Their time in the province 'had been as a dark night in which there was no star shining. But the great Head of the church had fought for them, and their cause had triumphed. He had promised that no weapon which was formed against his church should prosper, and he had now made good his pro- mise. Faith then said, the day is breaking, and soon, soon -faint not, lone watcher on a desolate post!--the Sun of righteousness will come, the Lord will come, and, driving away the hosts of darkness, will establish his kingdom glo- riously and forever.   CHAPTER XX. CONTCLUSIOV. "Last scene of all To close this strange eventful history." As oru LIKE IT. "I MUST return then to England as I came," said Mon- trose.  "No, not as I came either'" hesitating as he spoke, "for I leave her behind whose presence no property can supply, and whose companionship is more to me than every thing else." "No!" interrupted Emma, speaking with difficulty, and much moved. "For with your talents, station, and fortune, you can do much," and she looked as if she meant all she sald. "I am dependant on a   widowed father, to whom I owe every thing. You, you may do and    find much; and this, this, and it cost her an effort to get it out,  ' this little disappointment will be hereafter an incident only in your history." And, having thus far conquered her feelings, Emma availed herself of the silence of Montrose, to soften down her rejection of his suit, hoping to reconcile him to it; and was talking on kindly in a sister's tone, when each word only made Montrose more and more sensible of his loss. IIis distress became apparent -to Emma herself. Rising and taking his hat he turned, and, taking her unresisting hand in his, his look speaking more than words; he said: "Well! We  part," and was about to add, "to meet no more;" but this was an event he would not contemplate, and with her hand still in his he stopt. 'After awhile-re- covering himself, he proceeded.   You talk to me of useful ness, wealth, station, and talents; and ask me," he hesitated a moment, ,r to look to these to comfort and cheer me. I did think, I did hope, I was loved in return." Emma's whole frame seemed to be shaken. Her lip was tremulous, and it seemed she would not be able to calm lown feelings that were struggling for utterance. Her eye oL,  II.-23              (265)   266       PILATE AND HEROD. rested, as if accidentally, on the face of Montrose; who, by his appealing look, appeared to regard her as a deity who held his destiny in her hands, and on whose words it depended. Nature. overmastered the iron purpose, which till pow had sat at the helm. Emma's lips quivered, her face flushed, her eyes filled, and, I love you," came out, and in a very low tone too, before she was aware she had said it; and so unexpectedly that Montrose could hardly realize that words, so potent for good or evil, had been spoken. The seal being broken, which concealed in the secresy of the maiden's heart her affection for Montrose, the depth and fervour of that affection, which lay up there hid- den, likewise 1ecame manifest. Woman-like, loving not by halves, having- "told her love," it was not in her power to say to it, Thus far shalt thou go, and no further. Pressing the opening thus given, before the interview was over, Montrose succeeded in extracting a promise that she would unite her destiny to his; and he saw that he had achieved a great and unhoped for victory. But Emma fell upon the chair, and, burying her face in her hands, exclaimed. "My father! my good father!" and her mind, from the ejaculations which escaped, was oppressed with the thought of leaving her father in his loneliness. Hence she added, "To leave him thus would be a poor return for his kindness and affection." "What I, should have expected, my good child," said Parson Gordon, entering the room. "Be calm;" and, turn- ing to Montrose, he continued, "Be seated, sir. I did not mean to play the spy. I came to the door-caught some words of Mr. Montrose; and heard my daughter signify her acceptance. Now, as I have often said, though I would never advise, nor in any way further such a step, I would not oppose her happiness. Know then that her acceptance has my approval." He paused a minute or two, and then 'added, "And, as Isaac and Rebecca lived faithfully together, it is my fervent prayer that you may keep the vow and covenant which has now been made; and never have cause, or entertain a wish that you had not made it." As Parson Gordon proceeded, his voice faltered, and his large frame quivered from emotion. He addressed himself to Montrose. "Treat her kindly. She is the best of daughters; and, if you will love, honour, and keep her, she will make you the best of wives"    '* *                a ^   MnU"rUSE S NUPTIALS.      267 Montrose felt the force of this appeal; and his short and pithy reply, expressed in a tone of deep feeling, satisfied Parson Gordon that, far as we poor mortals can judge for the future, he had found such a husband as he could safely entrust with his daughter. Montrose then adverted to the necesity of his early return to England; and delicately expressed a hope that his nuptials would take place before his departure. This proposition met with more opposition from Emma than he had anticipated; and it required all his efforts and most earnest persuasions to overcome it. Laying her hand then in her father's, she said, "I cannot bear the thought of leaving you. You must go with me." "Death, my child," said Parson Gordon, solemnly, "will before long separate us all. Our paths have been one thus , far in life, and we could not reasonably expect to travel always along. My duty is one thing, yours is another, and where our duties call us, there lies our happiness." But, seeing that his daughter was overcome by the sacrifice thus suddenly forced upon her, he added, "Perhaps I will follow you." "Where? How soon?" asked Emma quickly. "Before long, perhaps, my child," replied Mr. Gordon. While they were making preparations for the nuptials of Montrose and Emma, we will briefly trace the course of events with Shepard and others. Shepard never knew certainly whence came the voice which had startled him in the tavern. He learned however that a room back of the one he was in, had just been taken by the Rev. Jacob Henderson, who entertained for Shepard's talents the highest opinion, and who, he suspected, might have employed this expedient to awaken in him a proper ambition, and to stimulate him to correspondent efforts. But while Mr. Delafield, by a reunion to his family, found in life a zest and joyousness he had not for years, Shepard also felt that a new career was opened to him by the new and interesting associations he had formed, in finding a -father, brother and sister. "I can be now," said he. what I have never ventured to hope before. A man might be brave enough to attempt to guide a boat over the rapids of Niagara river, and willing to be hurled over its chasm, pro- vided, on the bank, as spectators, stood those whose good opinion he valued, applauding the deed. But what cared I to breast; life's rapids, or that my boat did not bear her-   268       PILATE AND HEROD. self always well? What cared I to risk toil, and study, and denial in a stormy voyage over life's sea; if by me and near me to approve and say, Well done, there stood not those whose approbation I valued? One thing more now is want- ing. Alas! one thing thou lackest, necessary to complete the happiness of every child of Adam." That one thing here, Shepard supposed, was the possession of Mrs. Annie. With the extravagance of youth, and swayed by the tender passion, she seemed to be the ocean to the river of his thoughts and' the rills of his desires. "I must on and try, and try, and try again," he soliloquized. These were his reflections the morning after his arrival at St. Mary's. He made his toilet most carefully. His horse was brought out. Darnell, who stood by, said: "Surely, sir, you'll kick the puppy, Snarler, for his threats of getting out a writ against you."  "Hold that horse better," said Shepard to the groom, and then mounting, turned to his questioner and said, "No, I'll leave that delicate business to you. Socrates was kicked by an ass, and he had too much sense to kick the donkey back again." And off he bounded. "HeIneedn't go to Elfin Hall," said Darnell to some loungers at the tavern, 'who laughed at his discomfiture. "Annie, I know, don't care for him." But away rode Shepard, ascending and descending the hills, as if he meant to trust his fortunes to Mrs. Annie, and not to her cousin. He turned now an angle of the road, and Elfin Hall was in sight. Gates were opened without loss of time, and his rap was next at the door. No one came. He turned and called a servant out of the kitchen. "At home! Lor! no, massa," said a servant girl. "Where then?" he asked. "Deed, massa, she replied, "I no like say whar young missus is," seeming to enjoy his impatience. "Look' here, Miss Sable Saphead," said Shepard vexed, "who went out with your mistress? where? when? Come, none of your nonsense," getting mad. "The berry man massa," she replied, a little alarmed, "what kin fight." "A pray, who is this Samson?" "He no Massa Samson, but Massa Cap'en, him what overseer and fellow-sarvants say fought like alligator dat night;'   "Captain Fulford?" muttered Shepard. "How long have they been gone?" and feeling, though he could not say why, rather uncomfortable. "Since way breakfuss," was the reply. "Where?" "Deed, massa," said the girl, provokingly unwilling to be explicit, "Deed, massa, dey be gone to walk." "For what? Where?" about to give her a back-hand slap to quicken her apprehension. "De captain's vessel in creek yonder," pointing as she spoke, " and dey gone dare." "Strange!" said Shepard, mentally, standing on the steps, and looking hard at the girl, who quailing before his eye, meekly asked: "Massa, let me go now." "What has she gone to the vessel for?" "Why, massa, no know dat dey hab marry dis morning?" Shepard felt that he should sink on the steps for the first moment; and then, raising himself, looked in the direction of the creek. The vessel had weighed anchor, and, her sails filling with wind, she was just moving out of the creek. "No, this can't be," muttered-Shepard. "The girl is a fool." He heard a soft voice say, "Good morning, Mr. Shepard," and, turning, saw Mrs. Annie before him. Between surprise, and other not most pleasant feelings, Shepard forgot his wonted courtesy. He rallied himself, and the old Adam got the upper hand. "I hope Mrs. Annie has had a pleasant walk with her Neptune?" "My walk was not agreeable," she replied, rather shortly. "Will you walk in?" passing in the house, and Shepard followed, irresolute and uncomfortable. "Strange," said he to himself, looking hard at her. Mrs. Annie at that moment turned, and gave him one of those glances which he never could resist. "Mrs. Annie cer- tainly did not send her brave captain roaming over the wide sea," determined now to speak out. "He dismissed himself," she replied, both vexed and surprised at Shepard's apparent discourtesy. "Therefore, you are sad?" 23* L,   270       PILATE AND HEROD. "Yes. I parted from one I have long had a warm regard for." "Ah!" continued Shepard, biting his lip, and meaning to be very caustic., "Allow me to sympathise with you. The sea may give back its treasure." "Your sympathy, sir,".replied Mrs. Annie, indignant at his tone and manner, " will not make up for my loss." "No; that is quite possible. I never expect to equal Cap- tain Fulford in those tropes and figures." "What mean you?" interrupted Mrs. Annie. "I spoke of my simple-hearted friend, Euphy Snarler. She was mar- ried secretly, this morning, by Father' Canon; and, in order to avoid the persecution of her cruel uncle, has taken with her husband, Mr. Hackett, a trip to Annapolis, hoping the storm will not reach her there. And I have known Euphy so long, and at times, intimately, that it was painful to part with her. She may not return till Snarler's death, if she does at all." In a moment Shepard saw how affairs stood. He laid his hand upon his heart, and said, "This heart means all devotion to Mrs. Annie; so much so that the fear of losing her has more than once betrayed my lips into follies. Still," and he seemed to be very serious, "this heart points ever to its magnet and I trust you will forgive the variations of an idle tongue." "Be seated," said Mrs. Annie, confused. "With pleasure," thought he, "and  till doomsday, with you near me." Resolved to push ses affaires du coeur without loss of time, Shepard talked much, and greatly to the point. She heard him out, though not without endeavouring to change the subject. At length she found words to say: ("I fear, Mr. Shepard, that what comes so easily may be more words than heart. H-cannot-should not-do any thing now." "To oblige you," said he, "I-1- consent to any-will do any thing. But you wrong me, Mrs. Annie. If I could coin my heart into words, I'd make you the keeper of my treasure; but time would fail to count it out to you. Easy on my lips? Because I can't keep them in. They must out when truth says,.declare them, and my heart burns to speak its love for you. Put me to the proof, and if I prove re-   MRS. ANNIE AND, SHEPARD.      271 creant, then treat me as one who is detestable and infamous."' And he rose from his chair, as if unable to sit still. "No more." said Mrs. Annie, imploringly, waving her hand to him to be seated. "Agreed," speaking  under excitement, "and I will introduce it again,- whenever I am allowed to come into your presence, so long as you are Mrs. Annie Jones." And Shepard, forgetting his promise to drop the subject for the present, recalled to Mrs. Annie his attachment be- fore her nuptials to Jones, and his devotion ever since. He spoke of himself, (alluding to his isolation before the ac- quaintance with Montrose, and his discovery of his father and his father's family,) as ope whose life had- been early frowned upon by unkind fortune.: With her he thought he could chain the winds. that made him their sports; while, without her, he felt himself to be an ocean wreck drifting before a storm. And Mrs. Annie's heart being easily kindled, was carried away by a fervour that could love so deeply, and express itself so glowingly. Shepard saw that he was talking not unsuccessfully, and, determined to gain his end, repeated: "If Mrs. Annie doubts me, put my sincerity to the test." We said, that Shepard was not handsome, and that he could be, and was at times, repulsive. But a French pro- verb says, "Avec les hommnes F amour entre par les yeux, aveo les femmes par les oreilles." The tongue of an agree- able discourse wins more hearts than all the trappings of dress, and the art of the tailor, barber, and dancing master; and Shepard's powers of winning, resting on the permanent footing of colloquial ability, in which shone the grace of language, and the gold ore of sparkling and valuable sense, had produced on Mrs. Annie far more effect in his favour than she wished him to know, and perhaps even than she knew herself. She knew enough of his hold upon her regard to fear the result, and to struggle against an increase of it. He discovered that a struggle of some kind was going on with her, though the reason, was not suspected by him, and self-esteem with him was occasionally mu6h mortified by his apparent want of succqss after laying himself out to carry the citadel of her affections.) She would not respond, however, affirmatively to her earnest suitor's proposition, and he, with all his energy and resolution when roused, was content to press the matter no further. It was some com-   272       PILATh AND HEROD. fort to him that she had not rejected his suit, and he deter- mined to renew it if he could, at an early day. Mrs. Annie having left the room, Shepard endeavoured to entertain himself as best he could. He opened a book, which was lying on the table, and out of it dropt two pieces of paper, which, from mere idleness, he read, with- out thinking of the impropriety of the act in which he was engaged.  One was a copy of a letter which Mrs. Annie had written to Father Canon, in which she an- nounced to him her return to the bosom of the Church of England. "Here I was baptized, here my mother received every spiritual blessing with which she was favoured,-here my grandfather laboured as an earnest and faithful ambassador of Christ,-and here, since my return, I have known more peace of mind than I ever knew before. I cannot do, then, but what I am doing. I thank you for your past kindness. Your efforts merit this. But, while grateful to you, I must go and worship where, permit me to say, where only I be- lieve I can worship God in spirit and in truth." "All right," said Shepard, mentally. "I am happy to, know she has taken this step. I make no professions on re- ligious matters, except that I have no very especial love for the canting gospellers. But I caninot put faith in these priests. Men conversant with, and believing in, the awful mysteries they profess, would be, I should think, earnest men, not merely devoted to the outward growth of their order, but full of the inner power, the wondrous life, and the heavenly spirit of men who stand between God and man. But these priests are full of craft, full of guile, full of the world, sensuous, wine-bibbers, and not holy livers. Their mass and other offices seem to be set forms which they mum- ble over as a school-boy his lesson; but their faces, their words, their conversation, their sneers, are cdld, cold. I am glad Annie is free from them. Besides," he added, "I have no wish that my wife should be a Roman devotee. The priest may have her conscience so fully in his keeping that, while she exhibits but one side of her character to her hus- band, she may trust the other side to her confessor only. "But what is this?" he continued, picking up a second letter. "Ah! a treasure. Old Neptune has risen from his oozy bed, and, as if Mrs. Annie were a second Amphi- trite, has come here in his sea chariot, drawn by dolphins.   CAPTAIN FULFORD'S LETTER.      273 It is worth something to know how the sea-god makes love. Instead of cooing as the dove, or speaking in the dulcet strains of a poet-plover, he would roar as the blast; and, gathering the finny inhabitants of the deep, would invoke them to unite with him in his suit. But I must be quick. Soft, I'll read. "Mrs. Annie, "I've been navigating these capes too long not to cast anchor in sight of Elfin Hall; but, zounds! I can't be anchored there till its mistress says so. And the worst is I can't spin any yarn fine enough to please one so high, and who's so much above a roving tar like myself. Blast my eyes! if I've seen a ship sail better, or more grace- fully I'd follow in your wake, not only across the line, and never once lose sight of you, but even to Cape Horn. By Neptune and his whales! I could deal out poetry to you by the fathom, but it is all out of my reckoning. As the best I can do of this sort of sailing,--here it is: Though wreck'd by winds contrary, Though toss d on the briny sea, My heart will not be dreary, In thinking, love, ofthee. "Thine eyes d6 light me on, While at the helm I stand, Thy voice to my ear doth sound Sweeter than the cry of land; Calling me o'er the raging sea To moor my bark aside of thee. "Yours in love, truer than compass to north star, and deeper than fathom-line can sound. "JACK FULFORD." 4"The very thing," said Shepard to himself; and now I would give much to know how Mrs. Annie received this bil- let doux, fragrant as it is with the aroma of the sea weed. The captain should have had a sheet of the hide of the whale, and on it have written his amorous confession. In this way he would have perpetuated .his inimitable sonnet." In the mean while Lawyer Brief had not been idle nI prosecuting his love affair with Miss Evelin. The haughty beauty, as we hinted in the foregoing pages, had conceived a partiality for Montrose; but entertained a repugnance to the counsellor. The scene at St. Mary's spring, which led   274        PILATE AND HEROD. to the difficulty between Montrose and Emma, tended yet more to fix this partiality, and to colour it with the hue of love. But Montrose either did not suspect the impression which he had produced on the belle of St. Mary's, or did not care to avail himself of it. He made no further visits to the castle. His absence during the legislature afforded no means of making these visits afterwards, if he had been dis- posed; and it was reported on his return that he and Miss Gordon were to be married. How the report was started we know not, and, as news gets out in a way both curious and inexplicable, it would be idle to inquire how. This report of the nearness of the marriage of Montrose did perhaps more than any thing else to second the attorney's suit. The imperious beauty was indignant at the seeming slight thus put upon her. She held herself above, and had supposed that every one else esteemed her position and claims as higher than those of Miss Gordon." "How is this, Jane?" said Colonel Smithson, not suspect- ing that Montrose had made any serious -impression on her affections. "The belle of St, Mary's and the lady of Evelinton Manor, overlooked, and the daughter of a poor parson preferred." Miss Evelin wished to reply that all was as it should be, in order to disguise her mortification; but the tears came into her eyes; and Colonel Smithson, seeing how matters stood, in order to change the current, said: "Well, the more fool he, Jane. Young men niever know like old folks which side their bread is buttered?' "Indeed uncle," said Jane, "you talk as if I would have had him at a word ;" and curling her lip disdainfully, added, 'i'Tis all right, he'll have love in a cottage." "Yes,' replied the colonel, really anxious to do his best to help her look on the neglect of Montrose as no loss. "The honey suckles will bloom, and the birds will sing out the honey-moon; but then, before long, you think he'll be glad to get cheese-parings and brown bread on Sundays," and the colonel tried to force a laugh. But it was no laughing business to Miss Evelin, and after retiring to her room for the night the tide of contending feelings swept her at will. "Is it possible," she soliloquized, "that I have been overlooked for Emma Gordon?"And, as she spoke, her eyes rested on a mirror in the room, and the light of heri candle fell full upon her face and person.  a   MSS EVELIN'S DISAPPOINTMENT.      275 'I am not ugly," she continued, "I had some charms I thought. But it is of no use," and she laid her head on her ,hands, and the big tear drop rolled down her cheeks. And what is more painful than disappointed vanity, and mortified self-esteem? After awhile Miss Evelin mechanically made her prepa- rations to go to bed, and having finished them, was in the act of extinguishing her light, when a withered bouquet of flowers, that had been given her by Montrose, was seen in one of her books lying on the table. With the sight came up a flood of recollections, and she stood looking upon it, lost in her musings. Like those flowers her hopes were blooming at the time, fresh and fragrant; but now, she ad- ded bitterly, they are faded and scentless. And she clutched the harmless remembrancer of a painful past, and tore it to pieces. "Thus let him be, and my good wishes and good opinion of him," she added. Brief availed himself of the retirement of Montrose, and pressed his suit hard; and Miss Jane, reckless of what she was doing, did not turn away from him. True,' her pride recoiled at his unattractive figure; and his grey hairs did not seem to be exactly those which would look well alongside her own glossy and sunny ringlets. And it is a crusher to youthful hopes and romantic imaginings, a sad dispeller of the golden dreams, which in the sweet solitude of the heart we have nursed, to be forced to an alliance in which the heart has no share. But more crush- ing than all is it for an imperious beauty, who has soared on lofty wing, and esteemed no place high, honoured, or rich enough for her perch, to stoop down, and mate with one every way her inferior. The' lady of Evelintoh manor, revolved this painful idea over and over again. Her heart sickened at the prospect, and her temples throbbed at the mortification of an alliance with Brief. Still the attorney pressed his suit, and so great was her resentment of the sup- posed slight of Montrose, that she could think of no better way of revenge,'than by marrying Brief; forgetting in her passion, as other ladies have forgotten before under like cir- cumstances, that there was no necessity of her marrying at all. And on Shepard's return to St. Mary's, where he hoped to meet Montrose and their father, Mr. Delafield, it was reported that the attorney would in the course of the next week, lead the lady of Evelinton Manor to the hyme-   276-       PILATE AND HEROD. neal altar. As the Romans crowned their victims with flowers, and accompanied them with trumpets, and a showy procession before they slaughtered them, Colonel Smithson, it was further reported, would give such a merry-making as had not been seen in the castle, since the days of Leonard Calvert; that Miss Evelin, like a veritable victim, might perhaps be cheered on to the sacrifice, with these showy but empty expressions of joy. And here report did not exag- gerate. Father Canon had the pleasure of knitting together connubially the stag and hind of St, Mary's. A gay, joy- ous, and as gaudy an assemblage, as had assemWed for many years in the ancient city, met at the castle, anl graced the wedding with their presence. iOur friends Emma, Julia, and Annie, attended by MontroSe, Shepard, and Mr. Holt, were there; and it was observed by all, that, while the bride looked demure and most unbride-like, and the fortunate attorney, as far as appearances went, seemed to be superla- tively happy, Montrose and Julia, moved in the large com- pany the life and soul of all. As Montrose had secured the consent of Emma, he only waited for a few days to have his wishes crowned with the possession of her as his wife; and Julia was hardly less happy.  Johnson, to whom' her hand and heart were alike given, had arrived that very afternoon, and, besides, she felt herself lifted above the common atmosphere in which ordinary mor- tals breathe and know life, by the return of her father, and the discovery of her two brothers in Shepard and Montrose. How often is life a day of halcyon-pleasure! All is peace and calm, so peaceful that its wintry winds hushed-its ocean billows laid to rest--its clouds and thunder dispersed and gone; man, like the famous halcyon of the poets, may build his nest of home-happiness without fear of storms or disquiet. Would it not be well to make such times halcyon-days in truth! nestle to the Rock of ages, and there build our home for eternity!  The party broke up in good time, and returned to their' respective homes. Miss Evelin was Mrs. Brief. A Tom Thumb page was large enough for his name. How large a page would it have required to contain the virtues of her spouse, and the brilliant prospects of such an union? Still "the night is beautiful and ealm; Orion and the Pleiades glitter down quite serene." A horseman, however, was seen to be moving at a rapid gait from the castle across the   SNARLER DYING.        2" ford of St. John's creek, and passing in the gate at Snarler's, knock at the door, which was opened immediately "How is your master?" .was the question which the visiter put to the servant woman, old Sail, who stood at the door. Ah! massa Brief, poor massa most gone! He mighty low. Massa Priest Canon 'pare him now." The attorney hurried up stairs; being summoned away, just as the wed- ding party had left the castle, and,.with his head and heart full of happiness, he was called from his lovely and youthful bride, to stand by the bedside of an old and dying man, and write his last will and testament. Snarler's race was run. The loss of the Delafield estate was said to be the cause, and, from a bitter and rancorous hater of every thing like Romanism, he committed the folly, common to such minds, of going from one extreme to the other, He sent in haste for Father Canon to prepare him to die- and to Lawyer Brief an order that, though dying, he might control in all time that property which he loved best in life. Father Canon did for him as for Coode, and then, after much difficulty, Brief gathered enough from his occa- sional and almost indistinct ejaculations to write his will;  in which (for only on 'this condition was he shriven, the priest hoped to get from her the church lot in St. Mary's,) he gave to his niece, Euphy Hackett, all his property, and on her death without issue to his next of kin in England. These things being done, and with all due haste, Snarler fixed his fading eyes on Brief, and a light almost unearthly for a moment beamed from them as he said: "Delafied--willquick," trying to point. "Where?" said Brief, looking surprised. "Yes-gone!" said Snarler,-" forgot.   Right-Fa- ther?"--trying to turn his head round to Father Canon,- "No property there-there no lands, and slaves?" And the miser groaned at the hopeless prospect before him. "Ha!" he continued.  "Yes, yes, aint this gold here? See! the bag's fill. All mine, too. I'll count. One- two-more. Oh God! Away!-back!-back!-take him out! He has got my gold. Ha! he weighs it; and a soul is weighed along with it,-and they kick the balance, Sister-come-say-your Bible said-didn't it?--'How hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of VOL. II.-24   278        PILATE AND HEROD. God, -^hardly-hardly-riches-God!   No, Mary, have mercy i' "Heis dead," said the priest, addressing Brief.' "We'll ride."' Brief parted from Father Canon soon after they had mounted, and was making his way with no tardy pace through thef meadow at the head of St. John's creek, where the old hart in the hunt was unharboured, and he was im- patient to return to his bride; but a person sprang from a copse of wood to his right, caught the rein of his horse, and jerked the rider off. Before Brief could defend himself, his assailant beat him severely, and left him bleeding and stunned on the ground. The assailant, who was Darnell, remembered the attempt which was made by. Brief and Snarler to kidnap him,-though ignorant that they had mistaken him for Montrose,-and this being the first occa- sion: of meeting with Brief, he availed himself of it in the way mentioned, and then escaped. Brief's horse, being frightened, ran to the castle, and:his appearance, riderless, awakened the worst fears about the rider, who lay stiffened with the injuries he had received, and was not found till the next day. His wounds were not ;mortal; and his assailant, not being recognised, and keep- ing his own counsel, was not suspected. But the attorney's bridal did not have the .-most auspi- cious commencement, and few, who knew his unscrupulous- ness, either regretted his disaster, or augured a favourable issue from a connexion with him. Guilt is foredoomed, and the world at times reads its destiny long before the fulfil- ment. But during that eventful night, lights streamed out from the bridal chamber of the late haughty, but now self-victim- ized belle of St. Mary's, and they burned not less brightly in the death chamber of Snarler. The latter, according to the creed he had just adopted, was going to a sad, sad world, where a fire ofly second to that of the damned, and demons as many to torment as the imagination of England's great epic poet has conjured up, would burn his sins, off; and by torturing penances fit him for heaven. The former had before her a shorter and less formidable purgatory in an union to one she could not love. Such is life. Seldom do we see the inner torture, and the true wretchedness in the glare and glitter of outward appearances!   MONTROSE' MARRIAGE.        279 The banns had been duly and formally, as to time, place and matter, published in Poplar Hill Church by Parson Gordon; and, a few weeks after Miss Evelin's matrimonial annihilation into Mrs. Brief, Colonel Smithson's ooach, with himself, lady, and Mrs. Annie, drove up to said church. Gigs followed, and riders on horseback, and beheld a small but select company, consisting, besides the rector, of Emma, Mr. Holt, Julia, Mr. Delafield, Shepard, Montrose, John. son, Julia's betrothed, Robih, and a few of the parishioners assembled. Parson Gordon, with surplice on, looking pale and ner- vous, stood "in the body of the church ;" while Montrose and Emma, standing up before him, " in the sight of God, and in the face of the congregation,"' vowed to love each other till death should part them. Parson Gordon then, in a tremulous voice, said, "Those whom God hath joined to- gether, let not man put asunder;" and, after: he had pro- nounced them " man and wife together, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," and given them the priestly benediction, the married pair rose from their knees. Parson Gordon waited a while, instead of proceeding with the balance of the office of matrinony, (which is omitted in the American Prayer Book,) when Shepard, with Mrs. Annie leaning on his arm, slowly advanced, , Montrose and Emma at the same time stepping aside. Annie appeared to be very tremulous, while Shepard, now that he was about to attain the object of his desire, for the first time lost his self-possession. A look of surprise, notwithstanding the publishment of the banns, was exchanged by some in the congregation, as Parson Gordon repeated the opening address in the "solemnization of matrimony."  Attention the most profound enchained all, till he came to the words: "I, Annie, take thee, Augustus, to my wedded husband;" and the bride's face became deadly pale, her lips lost their power of speech, and she seemed to be fainting. One of the company screamed, and a voice said, "She is dying." The service was suspended. Shepard: bent in speechless agony over his bride. Mr. Delafield, like one distracted, stood near, the picture of wretchedness; while Montrose, passing Emma's arm into Julia's, hurried out of the church, and immediately returned with a gourd of water, with which Mrs. Smithson wet Annie's face.  In a few minutes   280        ILATE AND HEROD. the blood came again. She raised slowly her drooping head, -gazed fixedly at Parson Gordon, as if to collect her bewil- dered thoughts,-felt Shepard's hand pressing hers, as if thereby he might call her to life and consciousness; and, on Parson Gordon resuming the service, she repeated dis- tinctly after him to the close of the solemn vow. Their hands were joined. As in the case of Montrose and Emma, a ring was laid upon the book, handed to the groom, and by him put on her finger. The blessing of God was asked, and the nuptial benediction followed; and then Parson Gordon closed with the concluding part of the marriage service. Here, as writers of fiction would have it, closed the change- ful fortunes of the leading characters in our story ; but here in truth only opened the first page of their proper life; what that life was we are not able to say. However, all who saw Emma, as she stood there, would have said, that her moral loveliness, undimmed and untarnished by years and suffering, would shine on "( Like the long, sunny lapse of a Summer's day-light." As Annie stood and received the congratulations of the company, her dark eyes, long black lashes, in whose silk shadow lies deepest attraction, the heart on her lips, and -which beamed in her eyes, soft and sunny; all gave the as- surance that she was a proper woman, who gave, her heart with her hand. And Julia seemed not less happy than the brides; being the first to congratulate them, and though her own marriage to Johnson was near at hand, she felt that in their union her own happiness also had been promoted. Mr. Holt next found words to speak. "Allow me, nephew Charles," speaking to Montrose, " to hope you will prove yourself worthy of a wife whose queenly qualities would grace a diadem." And then turning to Shepard, (who seemed to be too happy to do any thing else but hold Annie's fingers in his, which, child-like, he was playing with,) Mr. Holt continued, "Permit me, Augustus, to trust that your princess, whose nobility and charms it requires no penetration to discover, will keep you in fetters, till the adoring lover settles down into the sensible husband." "I thought Mrs. Annie when innupta, unwed," he con- tinued, archly addressing Shepard's bride, "promised me   DIALOGUE..         281 once upon a time, that whenever she might be fettered in the hymeneal chain, I should hold the end of the chain. How's this?"       I (' There's no difficulty here) uncle," replied Julia, observ- ing Mrs. Anne's confusion. "Brother Augustus is the per- son chained, not Annie. She is free as air. But, I doubt not Annie will be obliged to you if you will help her to hold him in fetters." Mr. Holt smiled, and said, "With all pleasure." "And which chain, my son," said Mr. Delafield, for the first time speaking, "will be more valuable to you than if its links were golden, and its lustre that of the diamond, should it, under God, lead you to Him. I trust that no tears of Annie may ever fall upon it!" A few days afterwards, Parson Gordon asked:   I1 "What is to be done with poor Adaratha ' 1 { She will accompany us to England," replied Emma. "Mr. Montrose has described Coverdale manor, and above all London, so glowingly that she wishes to see how the old world will compare with the wilds out here. Mr. Shepard and Annie, you know, will go along with us. Oh that you, dear father, and Mr. Holt, and Julia, with her intended, Mr. Johnson, would be of the number!" "My post," said her father, solemnly, a is one of respon- sibility and trial., I may not leave it till Providence shall seem to order; and, if I had sought temporal ease or hap. piness, I would never have burdened myself with a parish; or, being burdened, would soon have relinquished it, convinced that no position in a worldly aspect is more cheerless or at times more illy requited." ' But, dear father," said Emma, 's could you not find a cure in England, where you might win souls to Christ no less than here?" . "I might'y said her father, cchut God has placed me here, and here I must. stay for the present." "Oh, father!" said Emma overcome, . 'tis tearing life and body asunder to leave you. On the ocean, at Cove'rdale, day and night, ,I shall see but one image, you, my dear father, abandoned by his daughter, without her to kiss and smile away his loneliness; a prey to faction, to cold and un- feeling men; overborne by cares, duties and labours. Oh, it is too much!"  And she sank on her knees, and, holding fast to his hand, bathed it with her tears. 24*   282       PILATE AND HEROD. "Rise, my daughter," said Parson Gordon, solemnly, but with forced calmness; "God's will be done. I cannot say with St. Paul, 'None of these things move me.' I would to God I could! but I trust I can say, 'I do not count my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry that I have received from the Lord Jesus to testify the Gospel of the grace of ,God.' My life, I fear, my dear daughter, is too much bound in yours. Apart from my Master's solemn charge, I live but for you. To raise you as a polished corner of the temple, to see and know you to be a true and faithful child of the Most High, to watch over you, keeping you from the evil, and shielding you from harm; and to lead you on through this valley of tears to the mount of rejoicing, has ever been my wish and prayer. It calls for, then, no ordinary sacrifice to give you up now. Still follow you-I dare not. Wolves are prowl- ing about the fold, and I must be at my post. I do not give you up either. I commit you to His keeping,"-kissing his daughter as he spoke, whose head was bowed with the emotion that overcame her,--" who can and will do for you more than any earthly father. "But here I must stay awhile longer. I may not run away. To finish my course with joy, I must finish it well. My time is short, and the day not distant when I can do no more in this life for Christ and His people. Why should I doubt, then? '"As patriarchs and prophets lived here, having no continu- ing city, but sought one to come, I must live, such being the will of God, as if I had neither wife," and he stopt, and appeared to be unable to proceed, " nor child," bending over his daughter, and pressing her to him, "nor kindred. I can hear a voice from God's book, saying, 'Wherefore, seeing you are compassed about with so great a cloud of wit- nesses, lay aside every weight, and run with patience the race set before you, looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith.' And my dear good child would not have her father prove recreant, for. fear of faction, toil, loneliness, meanness, and painfulness. His rod and His staff will uphold me, and onward I must go, leaning only upon Him." There was a long pause. Father and daughter seemed to be both overcome. At length, Parson Gordon, changing his tone of deep solemnity to one of fatherly affectionateness, said: "'Whether   PARSON GORDON'S FAREWELL.     283 I follow you then or not, or whether the Church of Christ here is to be torn by faction, I seek not to know. These present troubles, which, by the way, are only hushed for awhile, may be the howling of the wind that precedes- the storm, and the ark of God may be nearly submerged; still I doubt not an Ararat will be found on which she will be drifted, and the waters subsiding, the earth will send up to God once more a grateful fragrance." He paused. "It may be, (why should we not hope it?) that these noises impeaching the clergy, are only meant to try them before rewarding them. They may be the trumpet-sound before the day-dawn of the world's awakening. Here we have wild forest, men of untamed natures, wickedness abounding, and a few feeble and scattered parishes without a bishop, and under disheartened rectors who seem just able to pray, "ord, how long?'. Still the day is coming, when there will be here a bishop, with a large and efficient body of clergymen; and parishes crowded with a goodly number of worshippers, will dot and adorn the surface of this pro- vince. "Look up, then, my child. The day-dawn and day-spring from on high is not far off. You, and I, and ours, by every tie, are only of account so long as we render glory to God serving Him faithfully in His holy Church, walking before Him with reverence and godly fear; and knowing no pleasure, but in the way of His commandments. Let us, then, be faithful, and we shall not lose our reward at the recompense of the just." THE END. s ,   N   CHURCHMAN'S LIBRARY. PUBISHED BY H.
