PREFACE, BY THE AUTHORESS.

Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year of our Lord 1862, by
ROWENA-GRANICE STEELE,
in the Clerk's Office of the United States District Court for the Northern District
of'"the State of California.

In placing this little volume before the puWblic I have endeavored-as in. the-
stories hitherto written by me-to bring a moral to' bear upon it; and if
my writings are at all deserving, their sole merit lies in their simplicity. I1aving,
m ingled much with the world,  with the different classes of which it is com-
posed, I usually draw each e  acter fromreal life. When very young, I acted
as tract distributor im the great city of New York. To me this occupation was a
most pleasing one; for, being naturally of a communicative disposition, -I im-
parted freely the history of my own life, and was often repaid by that of t
listener in return. I also draw many truths a'nd conclusions from ny own
4cekered and eventful life; especially when speaking of home-of a kind7
loving mother, and pure, gentle, affectionate, confiding sisters-trials and strug-
(de- with pride and poverty; these.ae old,. familiar scenes, and cling to me
through all the vicimsitudes of life.
1 have frequently heard-he renrk thar t an authoress," or, "blue-stocking,
ai they sometimes call us, "should be shunned as a wife; that they are, as a
general thing, slovernly and idle in their habits; " but-this is a mistaken.notion,
I have had the pleasure of meeting Miss Grace Greenwood, Miss Jane Porter,
Fanny Fern, and a number of other authoresses of greater or less celebrity, and
I found them plain, neat, tidy, unpretending women, pleasing and lady-like in
eonversation- and entirely free f:om  what is called "strong-mindedness" in
women. As for myself, every piece I have written, (and they number about
sixty,) was composed while engaged in domestic affairs. 'I have often laid down
the dish-towel to take up my pen for the purpose of noting down an idea.; and
at my leisure would gather up these disconnectedrideas ; and then, mmo1ing

my real characters around me, weave them together, as we do the different
colored flowers, when forming them into a boquet.
The circumstances of the following story are true; that is, the suicide did
actually take place on the New Jersey shore, opposite the City of New York.
The eveMt, also the dreadful curse, I have 'no doubt, can be found upon the pages
of old fles'of the New York HERALD, SUN, TRIBUNE, and other papdrs published
about the year 1837-8.
Hoping that this little offering will meet the approbation'of an intelligent
public, it is submitted to its perusal with the desire that it will receive a general
and critical examination,                                    R. G. S.

"And must you really go to-morrow, Nelson?" said Carrie- Dean,
in a half ehildish voice, as if she would have it otherwise; "and must
you really go?"
"I must," answered the young man to whom these- words were

embrace from  Mrs. Field, who 'was always over-the wash-tub, or
ironing-table, when "the plague rheumathz," as she elled it, would
permit her to stand. I once heard her say, as I sat crying in one corner,
with a cold potato in my hand: 'Poor child, it is a shame that you
should live so, and suffer with a poor old w~ooman like me, when he is
surrounded with wealth and luxury.' "
"Who, Aunty?" Ieagerly exclaimed; who do you mean ; what he?"
" Did I say he?  Imeant th, 'ie rich nen, rho keep bigstores.
and live in brick houses; you are as good as their children."
" I looked at her for a, moment ; a new thought entered my childish
brain, and I exclaimed: 'Who am I, Aunty? Did I ever have a
father and mother?'"
" For a moment she was silent. She stirred the fire; then throwing
a few shavings upon the coals; said: - Nelsie, the chips are almost
gone, and if you will go to the-ship'yard and get a basket full, I'llcook
the nice little piece of corn-beef the lady gave you yesterday,. and some
cabbage too.'"
"I took the basket and left the house without murmuring my usnal
childish "excuses.  That' thought, that, strange thought-who am
I?'--still haunted my mind."
"I reached the ship-yard andbegan filling my basket with the -chips.
While thus engaged, a gentleman, holding a little boy about my own
age by the hand, passed through the yard. I heard the child say:
'Oh, father! see that poor little boy. Can't I give him nmy mittens:'
.fis hands must be cold. See," he continued, 'I can 'put mine in my
comforter,-or my pockets, but he has-to keep his in the cold all the
time.'"
"The gentleman approached me, and while the little 1)oy gave me
the mittens, he asked, in kindly tones: 'Who are you, my little man ?'"
" That was the question-' who was 1?' I-looked at him and answer-
ed: 'I don't know, sir ; my name is Nelson Wardell. I live with
aunty Field,. and she lives in the cellar kitchen of that old wooden
house there, around the corner.'
"' Is your mother and father dead??' continued the gentleman."
"'I guess so,' I replied."
Poor boy, poor boy,' he said, handing me a sixpence.  ie then
left me, saying-' You must- be a good boy'"            .
"1 looked at the sixpence and wished that I could buy aunty Field
a new dress with it i and after thinking of fifty things that I shoul
have liked to buy. I concluded to take it home and let aunty invest it

according to her own judgment."
"Fron that morning I became a thinker, and have been thinking
ever since-' who am I ?
"To-morrow being my twenty-first birth-day, dear arri, the myte-
rious curtain is to be drawn which has so long concealed from me
all information of my birth and parentage. I expect," 'he said, with
a merry laugh, " I shall turn out the son of some exiled nobleman, heir
to an immense- fortune'; therefore, be patient, Catrie, dear, in a few
days you shall know all."
"I don't want to know more than I do," replied the, girl, in a half
loving, half pettish tone. "I've known you ten years; and I know
you to be a high-ninded, honest, industriousyoung man, whohas risen
from errand-boy to head-clerk in my father's establishment. And as
such, my father is willing that you should become his son-in-law. But
,should you turn out to be a prince or some great titled foreigner, you
might forget little Carrie Dean, who led you to her father's door one even-
ing when she found you, sick and cold, wandering about the streets of
Philadelphia, and marry a princess or lady of honor."
Nlson Wardell looked up. A cloud rested -apon his usually placid
countenance. At length he addressed his companion:
"Carrie, those last words of yours re the only unkind ones I ever
heard from your lips., To be reminded of my former . verty' and
wretchedness, and your kind and heavenly, act of charity, does not
wound my pride. But, to be suspected of fickleness; to he r you say.,
'you fear I should forget you amid good fortune,' are wods unworthy
of your noble, and usually high-minded nature, I will now be as un-
generous as yourself. Suppose that I should turn out to be the son of
dishonorable parents-that my father as a thief, a murderer,
spending a felon's life within the walls of a prison; or, that my m-
ther-"
That sacred word died upon his Tips andhe burst into teark.
Oh, stop ! stop! " cried Carrie, throwing her arms about his neck
and kissing his high, proul forehead; "I did not intend to wound your
sensitiv, nature.  Oh! I have done wrong  Forgive me, Nelson
forgive me! Oh do not sob so ! IIt was a little foolish pang of girlish
tealo usy which caused me to utter those unkind words. Oh, if you
will forgive me this time, such a feeling shall never again enter my
Nelson embraced her fondly and imprinted a kiss of forgiveness on
her tear-bedewed cheek ; but he could not speak. The davt had entered

her in a neat, comfortable apartment. Ten years had passed
eft her to seek his fortune as a peddler of pea-nuts. True, she

" No; he still lives; or, at least, he was living,two years ago."
"M1y father alive, and I left a higgar! Coate, come, Mrs. Field, I
cannot be contet with this raeager explanation; I must insist that you

Mrs. Field drew a long sigh; then, without speaking she arose,
walked to an old chest of drawor, and from one of them drew forth a
little box.. She then unfastned a small key which hung with a bunch
at her side, and holding both box and key in her hand, addressed Nel-
som in the following words:
Dear Yelson, whatever may le the contents of that box, or whate-
Yer unhappiness it may oemsia you, do not blame me. The last

gel face was that which smiled upon him from the ivory?  "Beautiful!
beautiful !" he exclaimed,; " surely, this is not the picture of a human
face ; 'tis but the product of the fertile imagination of some finished
artist. Who is this ?" he inquired in eager tones, of Mrs..Field.
"After you have learned her history, you shall know her name," she
replied.
Before twelve o'clock that night he was in possession of the, follow-
ing details, gleaned from thematiuscript:
"It was one of those bright, calm mornings in May; not a cloul
rested. upon the face of the broad, blue heavens. The very air-without
the aid of orange blossoms-seemed laden with sweets. The rich tint-
ed pink and purple vapors floated in the _air just above the house-lops,
and looked like garlands of bright flowers, twined and festooned by,
angels' hands.
"Such was the appearance of this lovely morning to the eye of the
lover of the beautiful, even in the busy, bustling city of New York.
.housamjs passed and repassed without heeding its beauty. They only
saw the pavement upon which they trod; so busy were their iniuds
with the subjects which occupied their thoughts. But the group of
young girls sitting in the school-room of the Rutger Institute was not
of the latter class. They were six in number--gay, light-hearted, and
beautiful. But the most bright and beautiful among them was Leon-
nie St. James. Tall and queenly in figure for one (of her years, with
heavenly blue eyes, together with a rich musical voico, She was the
last of th6 above mentioned group who arrived, and as she entered the
school-room the others ran forward to meet her to give and receive the
usual good-morning kiss.
" Shall we walk out, or remain here until school time? " said Au-
guAta Somers, another lovely girl. "We have it half hour to do just
as we please in."
",Oh ! let us walk, by all means," cried Minnio Trueman, a nymph
with-roguish gray eyes. 'We will make quite a conspicuous appear-
anco marching along two abreast a la miUlaire."
This last remark drew forth a merry laugh from her companions.
"0, come!" said Leonnie, "let us walk ; it will do uts good this
lovely morning."
I would rather not," said Efie Lane, a palo girl with large black
eves and sylph-like form.

Come, come, Leonnie, let us iear from your wise lips, what you would
do, if a young man should gain your heart and then forsale you for
another!"
"Well," said Leonnie, and a deep, unconscious sigh escaped from
her bosom. "As'I have no father or brother to fight a duel in protection

been introduced to a young man iiamd Philip Wardell, at a private
party. A feeling of mutual love appeared to spring up between them
at first sight. A friend of Leonnie's percieving the marked attention
he paid her, and 'the pleasure those attentions seemed to give her,
wvhisoered in her ear-" Beware of hiim, Leonnie, he is a heartless lib-
ertine."  But Leounic heeded not the warning. She could not if she
would. Her heart was gone-.-gone from her keeping forever, Philip
Wardell was the possessor -of that unblemished gem.
"'The next eveninrg after the party, he called at the residence of the
Josselyns and inquired for Leonnie. He was shown to the parlor by a
domestic. Instead of meeting the sweet smile of Leonnie, he met the
stern eye of her guardian, who thus addressed him:
"Mr. Wardell, you are an unwelcome visitor at this house. Leontie
is my ward.. I love her as a ehild; arid I would not have her despoiled
of her parity and virtue by subh a heartlesslibertine as you have pro-
ed yourself to be. I know more of your doings than you are aware of,
so be gone, and never enter mny door again!"
"Burning with anger and insulted pride, Philip left the house mut--
tering nurses,
X Yes, old man," he said, " I will be revenged i I will plcktyour
lovely flower, and Nhen I have blighted its freshness will cast it with-
ering at your feet. I'll teach you to insult a gentleman's son.~
" After thus unceremoniously dismissing young Wardiell, he summon-
ed Leonnie to his study. 'Come, Leonnie he said, 'and sit in this
chair beside me' The trembling-girl obeyed. ' Yoiiknow,'he began,
' that Mrs.. Josselyn and myself have loved you as well as though you
had been our own child. We have done all in our humble power to
make your home pleasant; and you have well repaid~ us for our pains
by yielding obediently to all our wishes. And now that the trying
hour has come, I trust that you wil take our advice  He then related
what had taken place between himself an *Piip, and also told her his
true character.
"Loonnie listened, and when he had finished, she wiped the tears
from her eyes and said: 'Friend, father, I will try to do as you wish
-forget him ; but oh, it would have been so sweet to have loved hims
Still, I will promise never to speak to him; or at least not to listen to
hi1s words- of love.' 'And this simple-mninded, inexperienced girl
intended to keep her promise. -But, alas!i poor unsuspecting Leonnie,

side. She knew not the honeyed words that would be breathed in her
ear. She had yet to learn how delicious was the draught of first lov(e,
or how impossible to resist the gentle influence of the practiced deceiver
who had two points to gain-her love, that he might toy with her while
the charm lasted, and revenge upon the old man, who had insulted
him.
"On the following morning, as Leonnie was passing on her way to
school, to her great surprise, she met Wardell. It was with half regret
half pleasure that she returned the warm greeting he gave her.. Tie
sorrowful, heart-broken look which he had assumed, a"d the sad tone
of voice in which he addressed her had awakened in her a feeling of
sympathy for him,
"'One point gained,' he murmured, with a smile of satisfdaction, as
he left her. ' Gain a girl's sympathy and you are sure of her love.'
"4Ere he left her he received a promise from her to' meet him that
evening on her return from school. Thus for week they met clan
detinely.
"On the evening following the morning on which the conversation
regarding theasicide in te school-room took place, Leonnie had pro-
mised Wardell to go to the minister's to get married; and it was the
knowledge of.this which caused her to look so-sad upon that occasion.
Sil she felt that there could be no artifice or deception used towards
No, no;' she soliloquized, 'there is-no falsehood in the nature of
Philip. ie, has never spoken a disrespectable word to me. Ile desires
to make me his wife, and my heart tells me that a life of happiness
awaits me if I consent. If not I must be miserable, for I can never
love, another.'
"Alas! the love of woman! It is known
To be a lovely and a fearful thing;
For all of theirs upon that die is thrown.
And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring
To them but mockeries of the past."
When the school closed for the day, Leonnie made an excuse to her
companions for taking an opposite direction from the one she usually
took on her return home. After bidding them goad.by she walked ra-
pidly for about five squars. At the corner of a small alley crossing
Grand street she saw .a carriage, waiting, and as she approached the
driver dismounted and opened the door. The next moment she was
seated beside the idol of her heart-Philip Wardell, and riding at a -
rapid rate down the street; The curtains of the carriage were closely

seek him out. I'll tell him that I am no longer a school girl, but a
woman, with a woman's heart; that I will share his poverty   that t1
will leave this pretty cottage, where we have spent so many happy
hours; this little parAdise where you, my boy, first saw the light of
day and received your father's ivarm kiss of welcome. Yes, I will
give-up all, I can take a little school in the city, and make enough to
keep a neat, comfortable room for Philip"; and when he sees how light-
hearted I am, he will bheer up, and fortune may smile again. I would
go to-night, but the snow is falling so fast tha't I fear little Nelsie would
take cold. I feel as if I could fly. I could pass over to the avenue and
get into the stage, but I have not got a sfipence, for I spent the Lst
few pennies I.had this morning for bread and milk for Nelsie. I won-,
der if there is enough left for his breakfast.' She then arose and laid
the sleeping child in his crib, and with a mother's caution she hastened
to the cupboard to see how the bread and milk held 'out. 'I am very
hungry,' she sighed, as she lifted a smallipait'of a loaf, 'but I must
not taste this. No, I will not ,ob my child. Now, if Philip should
come, what would I do? Ie would want sonie supper. O, if he only
would come ! I could toast the bread, and warm the milk and throw it-
over.. le likes milk-toast. But then there is no butter. 0, well, he
could get along without butter foi once.'"
"Poor teonnie, for it was she, would rob har babe for that heartless
mian, and yet would not taste a crumb, to appease her own hunger.
'More angel she, and he the blacker devil!' -Hugry and almost
heart-broken, she retired to her bed. One thought cheered her; and
that was of starting to the city in the morning, and the hope of finding
her husband. At length she slept but it was not that sweet, undi1
turbed, refreshing stimber of other days. At an early hour in tho
morning, she was awakened by the sweet voice of little Nelsie, calling
'Mama, mama, Nelsie cold.'"
"She arose, and to her sorrow and astonishment, saw that the snow
was still falling. She felt that it would be impossible for her to reach
the city with'her childin her arms in her weak state of health. Just
then a note from her little pet Canary bird fell upon her ear. 'Poor,
little thing,' she said, 'you to, will starve.' Then placing the cage
upon the table,-she began to make a fire, which soon was blazing cheer.,
fully in the grate. She then warmed the milk and fed Nelsie, and aftei'
kissing him twenty times, while the tears stole down her cheeks, shie
said to him :

Will Nelsie be good and not go to the fire optil mama comes back ?
S' Yes,' he replied, in lisping accents, 'Nelsie good boy, maMa, bring
Nvlsie candy?'
"She threw a shawl about her, and taking up the cage, left the cot-
tage. A short distance up the road stood a small shanty, in which
lived an Irish family, w4ho gained a living by retailing cheap liquors,
tobacco, and a few coarse groceries, such as cod-fish, mouldy ham, ,poor
tea, and dark brown sugar. The only article fit for a person: to eat
was the Irish potatoes. To this shanty Leonnie bent her steps. When
she arrived she met a hearty welcome from the fat, good-:natured inis-
tress.ta
I have come,' she said, 'to ask yoU to give me a little milk, a loaf
of bread, and a few potatoes for this bird and cage. The bird cost ten
dollars,,and the cage seven, and I will be glad to get two dollars worth
of provisions for them.'"
" The wonian spoke kindly, and invited her to sit down by the
fire. ,Sure,' said she, 'I have no use for the pretty thing, bu" I will
let vow have the things you want; and if you want to sell the bird and
(age, my old man is going to the city this morning, and he will sell it
for you.
"'Very well,' replied Leonnie, 'that will do; but please give me
the things, for I left my babe, and I am afraid that it will get into the
fire'

"The bread, potatoes and milk were made ready. 'Come,' said the
old lady, 'lc me fix you a nice little warm-drink,,fo,r faith, an' it's
hard weather.
" Leonnic accepted the offer, and took a drink of Irish whisky punch,
which the woman declared was from her own private bottle, and then
started for the cottage. There she found little Nelsie safe, and soundly
sleeping upon the carpet. That day passed, and still no tidings from
Philip."
'1Oh !' she exclaimed as she gazed upon the golden sunset, which
scorned to be smiling a good-night to the snow-covered hills ; Oh! if
it is 'Clear in the morning, I will start for the city. I can get a few
pennies from the woman at the shanty on the cage and bird."'
"At this moment she heard a knock at the door. She hastened to
open it, and as she did so, she saw standing there the husband of her
Irish friend."
"'I have come,' he said, 'to pay you the balance due you on that
bird and cage you left with my wife this morning. I tried to sell it for

"The man took the money, and soon returned with the above-men-
tioned articles. When it was prepared, she sat down to her lonely
meal, and soon after retired to bed. When she arose in the morning
the sun'was shining. After dressing hers,.f and child and partaking
of a scanty meal, she took Nelsie in her arms and crossed over to the
avenue. There she entered an omnibus and yi-oceedd4to the city.
She knelv not the- street or number of her husband's place of business.
and after wandering around for some time, she at length thought of a
directory, inwhgich she found the desired information. His business,
place was No. -, Maiden Lane. To this place she proceeded, not ex-
pecting to-find him ; only hoping to hear from him. Judge of her joy
and surprise upon-opening the store door to behold him in conversation
with a gentleman who seemed about to buy something. There was an
old.gentleman and two younger ones seated at the back part of the
store. - As soon as Philip saw'her he said to the gentlemen:
Excuse me a moment, until I see what the lady ,Wants.' He ap-
4proached her, and she read in his looks-- be silent.
"lHe bent down and said to her: 'Go to the Pearl Street house. I
'Will meet you there in half an hour.'"
"Without replying, or even a look of reproach, she left and wenv
directly to thehouse designated."
At the appointed hour he came; but not the fond affectionate lover
and husband of other days. His first words were/:
Why have you followed me, and how dare you come to the- store?-
I have told you that I did not wish my father to see you, or know any-
thing of imy secret marriage.'"
"At these cruel words Leonnie burst into tears. She couTd not speak.
Little Nelsie crowed and laughed at his father; but the hardened wretch
took no notice of his childish' prattle. At length Leonnie recovered
her self-possession sufficiently to speak, and said:

being hung. I you don't want to live, kill yourself.' "1
" How Leonnie kept her senses through all these taunts and jeers;
and from the lips of the man who had so lately professed to love and
idolize her, I cannot tell."
Here,' he said, handing her a ten-dollar bill, 'take this; it will
keep you and the young one until you find some one to befriend you.'"
"'Oh, Philip!' she groaned, in tones of the deepestagony; 'if you
-no longer love me; if I, whom you once loved to,' caress and fondle
with, have become hateful to you, don't desert your child, and cast him
froin you forever.'",
' 'My child f' said Philip, with a scornful, sarcastic 'look; 'I'm not
so sure of-that;- it's just as likely to be another's.'"
"Leonnie sprang towards him with the fierceness of a' tress. He
had aroused a other's pi'ide-insulted a woman's truth."
"'Philip Wardell,' she said, 'take back those last words, or I will
kill you!'"
"She had snatched a large China pitcher from the table a she
advanced towards him, and held it menacingly above his head. lIe
caught her by the arm and threw her to the floor, and after taking the
vessel from her, slapped her face several tinies."_
'Take that ! and thatb' he said, as blow after blow fell upon her
face and neck. 'I'll teach you to threaten me. I'nm going now; atild
before I leave, I have a few words of warning to say to you: Thi
must be the last time that we ever meet; and if you ever dare to coin e
where.I am, I will have your child taken from you and put where you
will 'neve ' see him again, and you shall be sent to the insae 'asylum
as a lunatic; and I will take good care to keep you there.' And with
these brutal words and a fiendish smile, he took his departure."
"Poor Leonnie; her sorrow knew no bounds. She snatched up the
child and drew it to her breast. 'Oh, God !' she cried, 'do not let my
heart break. Oh, have mercy upon me; assuage the anguish which
swells my breast. Do not let these overwhelming trials drive me mad.
I would l-ive, and in nmy right mind, for my darling's sake.'"
" After uttering the foregoing simple and earnest prayer, Leonnie
felt more calm. 11cr mind gradually became more peaceful, and she

heart crushed, her brain crazed, she felt calm and resigned. Pride
had ceased to struggle in hertosom. As she walked towards the resi-
dence of Mrs. Field, she met a gay young lady. She stepped up to
her and said: ' You will give me some bread for little Nelsie ; wOn'It
You, Birdie?'"
Poor thing,' sighed the young, girl, as she handed her twenty-ive
cents, ' she must be crazy or tipsy.' "
When Leonnie reniehed her humble lodgins, she gave the money
to Mrs. Fiel, who went out and purchased some bread. The poor
wonf n thought she perceived something strange in the actions of theo
yotuig mother, Still she said nothing, but determined not to retire
until Leonnie should be asleep. Little Nelson was sleeping sweetly.
lPoor child, he know nothing of his mother's sufferings."
Come, Leonnie,' said Mrs. Field, ' you had better go to bed ; it is
getting late.'"
"'In a few moments,' she replied, in a sad tone of voice. She then'
went to her trunk, which was nearly empty, and appeared to be busying
herself with its meiiger contents,*fn -a few moments she seated herself
beOside Mrs. Field and said in a clear voice, and with apparent sanity :
DAar friend, I have a strange presentiment which haunts me like
the memory of a troubled dream. There have been times within the
last five or six hours, when I have been unconscious to all around. I
emuld not even call to mind the name of my sweet child. I fear that
I am going crazy. Oh! -hw I have pray ed that this calamity might be
averted, 'for Nelsie's dear sake. You see I cannot cry; Should my
fears become verified, will you take care of N*iei? that is, put him'
under the care ofE those who won't abuse him? I would rather that he
would share your poverty than that he should go among strangers. But
to with him as you please, only do not let that tend have him. I mean
Philip W ardell-his father--my betrayer.' "
"' Leonnie,' saidl Mrs. Field, ' go to bed, you are discouragedl;' a good
night's sleep will make you well again. In the morning you will feel
more light-hearted. The winter is past; it is now the month of May
times will get better. lNelsie is now old enough to lbavo with me, andl
you can get a place at service ; and when you have earned alittle money
you ca~n redeem some of your clothes and b~e prepared to take a situation
as governess. Come, come, ehder up,' said Mrs. Field, in kindly tones,
' there are many happy days in store for you.' "

"Searcely had the words passed his lips, when Leonnie, becoming
desperate, approached the door of the carriage nearest the lady,

that was the name of Philip's young wife.* She shuddered as her

NEw YoRK, SEPT. 20, 18-.
 ALTER DEAN EsQ.-De4r Sir: You will doubtless be much sur-
prised at the contents of this communication.
Circumstances have rendered it impossible for me to return to Phila-
delphia at present Events have transpired of which I was entirely
ignorant until ay resent visit to this city.
During the few days that I have been here, I have learned facts eon-
cernin my birth and parentage which, if known, in the eyes of the
superci ious world, would brand me as unworthy of your friendship or
your daughter's hand. I will leave you to conjecture the truth; but
with a sorrowing heart and eyes flowig with tears, I hereby relinquish
all claim to both.
You know how much I love Carrie, and can guess how many strug-
gles it will cost me to leave her ; but I cannot ask he t share my dis-
grace. I would not take her from her purity-fro a-11 that is chaste
and refined, to have the finger of Ecorn pointed at her. Oh? if she
were poor and humble, I would exclaim, in the language of the Moor :
"If heaven would make me a world of one entire nd perfect chrysQ.
ilte I would not sell her for it."
I will enclose a note to her, which after you have read, you may give
to her, if it should please you to do so.
You will please excuse the briefness of this letter. You may guess
my feelings under the painfkil circumstances. If we never meet again,
may-God smile upon you and yours, is the wish  our true, grateful
and ever faithful friend.                     Etso WARDELL.

At the l eeting of the citizens it was decided that ach one should
take a toy trumpet' as they thought that with this novel instrument it
wtilde impossible to mistake the sinal of the, banditti for that of
their own. The trumpets were ofcourse to be used for signaling the
party to repair to the spot in case of an encounter.

reigned up his horse, asked :
"Who are you?"
"CA dying man," was the faint reply.
Nelson dismounted, and holding his horse by the bridle, stooped
down and asked:
"Have you anything to -say?"
'Yes," whispered the sufferer, "I have been the captain of this
bad for two years, and have many crimes to answer for in thie net
world; but I need not confess them here to you. All I have to say is,
that my real name is Philip Wardell, of New York."
" Philip Wardell I" exclaimed Nelson; " id you know a lady by

After changing his clothes, which were covered with the blood which

valued by hermore than all the rare and beautiful plants whieh deco:.
rated her garden. She paused and bent over it; one briny drop min-
gled with the pure spring water which she used in irrigating. As she
stood, herlbreast heaving with emotion, her thoughts wandering hither
and thither like the dove from the ark seeking a resting place, the world
was completely shut out; it seemed like spirit mingling with spirit.
The sweet trance was still upts her-when the Voice of her father called
her back to the reality of her lore1y state of being.
Oh, cruel parent I first to deceive your daughter in regard to the
truth and constancy of the one she loves, and thrn4 deprive, her of the
sweet communion of spirit with spirit.
"Carrie, child, come in," he said' 'it is far past nightfall. Your
dress is too thin to remain in the dewy air, Come with me -Dougla:s
is in the parlor waiting to:see you."
For a moment Carrie hesitated, 'fhe naame of Douglas was hateful
to her. Not that she would willingly hate any one; but she knew
that he only sought the goodwill of her childish father and herself, that
he might become the possessor of her hand and the-immense fortune to
which she was soleolieir.~
Seeing that herfather was about to repeat his request, she approached
him, kissed his wrinkled cheek and said
"Father, I trust that you will admit that I have ever been to you a
confiding and obedient child; thatI have sought your counsel and acted
according to your advice, and have obeyed all your commands. I love
and reverence you next to my God; and, I know you loveme and would
not knowingly case me pain unless you thought that I would'profit by

buried within my heart. I can never love again ; 'nd would not give

pon receiving this information, poor Carrie gave a faint cry and

mitted suicide. Of course these circumtances, connected with my past
lifl'e although no fault of mine, will render a union between us impossi-
bde. I do not entertain the least shadow of a'hope that your father will
give his consent, even should your generous nature prompt you-to over-
look my misfortune. But, dear Carrie, whatever may be your feelings,
I wish you to wrote a few lines to me. A few kind words from your

assure you that whatever my lot may be, or wherever fate may turn my
fotsteps, you will be remembered with the warm, unchanging affection
which I have cherished for you for the last ten years. -Nothing shall
abusee my heart to change towards you, and if we never meet again on
rarth, it will be the memory of your sweet, pure love which shall gpide
y wounded heart in the pathof duty to my fellow men. Should you
1el inclined, and obtain your father' permission to answer this, I will
write to you again. But; do nothing without consulting him. If 1do
not hear from you-if I am nt permitted the dear pleasure cA^ reading
an epistle from your band, I will strive to bear allwith patience, and still

Come, rouse thee, dearest: 't is not wVel
To let the spirit brood
Thus darkly o'er the cares that swelt
Life's current to a fload.
As brooks and torrents, rivers, all
Increase the gulf in which they fall,
iSuch thoughts, by gathering up the rills
Of lesser griefs, spread real ills;
And with their gloomy shades conceal
The landmarks 1ope would else reveal."
The funeral was over.    A week had passed, during -which Aunt
Deborah and the kind-hearted doctor had used every exertion to divert.
ihe mind of the lonely orphan from her solitary condition. But it was
a hard task for Carrie to assume a pleasant air. Ifers was a double-
sorrow. Now that she couI no longer enjoy the society of her ever
kind and affectionate father, she felt more than ever the want of thro
ear one who had been the companion of all her maiden pleasures and
)1roWS.
"Oh! if Nelson had not left," she would murmur, ''his presence
would assuage much of the anguish which I now feel."
She had confided her secret love and all the circumstances connected
with it to Aunt Deborah, who sympathized with her, and in return
told the story of her own heart-trials.
At the expiration of a week, the lawyer 'upon whom had devolved
the duty of settling up the affairs of the estate, called at the house

und requested Carrie to gatherup all the papers belonging t her deceas-
d father and haid them to him at the earliest opportunity. The, poor
r1 feeling unequal to this painful ask requested her aunt to  erftorin
the duty for her.
"With pleasure, dear Carrie,' said the kind-hearted Deborah.
As she was engaged in this duty, her eye fell upon a note directed to
"Carrie Dean, care of Walter B. Dean," and called out
"fHere, Carrie, is somethir belogi.g to you, dear.
Carrie reached forth her hand and received the note. The superserip-
tion was in the well-remembered hand-writing of Nelson. "What can
this mean?" she asked in a trembling voice; "I never received a note
from  him. There is somtie mystery and perhaps mistake connected with
tIhis. I cannot gather col-rage to read'itmyself, will you do so for me,

by sobs and eca te     t o thelipsof Carrie, such as "Poor. Nel-

Aunt Deborah, too often paused to clear her throat of a choking sen -
sation which  oud rse in spite of her effors ochk it.    She
hadfinished, she arose, and taking Carrie's hand within her own, said:
Dear girl, dry yur tears; there is peace and joy, perhaps' in store
for you. I feel tht he hand of Providence is working for your good
Come, come, cheer up"
But still Carr  ept. '1h0!" she exlaimed amid her  terwhr

Pride; nothing but pride;" sighed Aunt Deborah. "Oh! how
Many true hearts have been severed by that curse.! But for pride
might ha.ve been a happy wife. But Come, Carrie, you are your owt
mistress now;-mistress of an immense. fortune,-mistress of ti"s

Carrie could not help smiling at her aunt's attempt to rouse her; 2and
that smile told more than one tale. It told of a bright, golden glam
of hope which was entwining. itself around her heart, and playing,
bo-peep with the little flutterer.
I will pass over one month. A busy month it had been with Carric
and Aunt Deborah. In that period, all the property belonging to the
estate of the late Mr. Dean had been sold, Carrie had purchased  W
elegant mansion, and had it fitted up according to her own taste. All
of the old servants of her father's household had been retained by the!r
oufg mistress.
"Ad n w, said Carrie, one pleasant morning- just after the break-
fast was over, ",dear Aunt, that all is settled, I want you to eveal to-
me your plan of action in this wonderful plot of yours, which you say,
should it prove successful, will render the remainder of my days, days
of happiness and peace."
"Very well, said Aunt Deborah. with a pleasant smile, "I wil
explain, and if my fair niece-approves, which I think she will, like a
,ood sensible girl as she is, we will lose no time in putting it into prc.'

and is anxious, as far as her means will permit, to support her unfortu-
xate niece in the enjoyment of every little lnxury. The  or child is.
engaged in painting landscapes, which I believe will afford her a very
nice little income. But she is too fragile and delicate to perform much
labor.
I know, dear Nelson, that she loves you still, for I have observed her
weeping while gazing'upon your likeness. She does not know that I
have written anything about her to you ; but if you still love her, I
wish you would write a few lines to her; for I do love her so much,.
There was some mistake about the note you told me yon sent her at the

I think  replied the nurse, "that it was caused by his reading a
letter fr   the States." 1 tried to keep him from reading it; but he
insisted upon doing so, and I could not prevent him.."

"Yes;"4 replied the doctor; "if you will obey my orders, I think
that there is ,o doubt but what you will recover. -You must keep per.

Two Weeks previous to the reception of Mrs. Field's letter, Nelson

sion. At the proper time invitations were sent out, and-of course all
were s rprised at the sudden, Announcement of a wedding.
One Week before theevening on which the wedding was to take phice,
Carrie bid good-by to Nelson and Mrs. Field, and returned to her man-
sion inPhiladelphia, where she was to remain'until the wedding came
"Oh, my sweet love!" said Nelson ;' how shallI live a whole week
without you ? Now- that we have been reunited, I feel that life would
he a blgnk without your dear presence."
During the three weeks'awhich they had remained' together, Nelson
had, related to Carrie the history of his unfortunate mother, and also
of the terrible death of his father.
When Nelson showed Carrie the picture of Leonnie, she was almost
struck duMb with admiration.
"What a sweet face!' she exclaimed; and vhen they parted, she
requested Nelson to let her take the picture with her, to which he con-
sented.
The week passed. The day--the eventfuly came,. apd Nelson in
company with Mrs. Field started for Philadelphiia.At n clock they
arrived and fonnd a carriage with Aunt Deborah at the dep(t, waiting
to take them to the residence of the bride.
Oh, what a-'beautiful place " exclaimed Mrs. Field, as Aunt Ijebo
r-l pointed out the park and elegant house, where the wedding was
to take place.
" Yes," replied Aunt Deboramh, "I think it a very delightful phlee.
and I trust that Nelson and Carrie will enjoy a pleasant honey-moon
there. It will be much more pleasant than traveling this warm awl
dusty weather."
Nelson was silent. Ile was too muich engrossed with the happy
thought of meeting Carrie to even hear what was passing.- -The reader
can imagine his thoughts more easily than I can express them in words.

in one hand and happiness in the other, while gentle Prudence held
forth a banner emblematic of her presence, upon-which was written in
golden letters- PLET,"    A whole train of beautiful spirits was
riing up before his enraptured gaze when his mind was suddenly
brought back to the reality of earthly things by the sweet voice of Car-
rie calling to a servant to run:tnd open the park gate. The next mo-
ment he caught sight (?f her sweet, smiling face, and received a wave of
welcome by a nowy' handkerchief,
The wedding was'over, a week had passed, and yet no arrangements
had been 'made for the future residence of Nelson and his bride, LIe
had placed in a bank upon his arrival in Ner York the sum of fifteen
thousand dollars, and thought several times of consulting Carrie in
'regard to business affairs. Of course he thought Carrie had rather
remain in Philadelphia; and if so, he would make arrangements to go
into business in that city. Ile sat thinking this matter over one morn-
ing, while Carrie and Aunt Deborah were holding a private cerfer6nce
in an adjoining-room. Ile had observed considerable confusion, ard
'had heard some whispering ; but thinking that it would be in-
polite to interfere with thearrangements of the -ladies, he remained
quiet. In a few moments Aunt D~eborah came to the door, and with
som'ethingof mystery in her tone, said:
WNelson, please to just step into the next room."
ie arose and followed her. Carrie met him at the door,' and taking
him by the hand, pointed to alife-sized portrait enclosed in a splendid
frame, banging upon the wall.
" My mother's. pictne! " exclaimed Nelson, in tones of mingled
surprise and pleasure.
" Yei," said Carrie, "I took the miniature to Mr. ,' the best
artist in the United States ; and. do you not think it 'a splendid and
perfect production."
" I do, Indeed," said 'Nelson, wiping a tear from his cheek. "Oh,
arrie, you are an angel! But, dearest, it m t have cost quite an
amount of 'money. Permit me   to send him A check upon my banker."
" 0, no," cried Carrie, "the bill is settled. And now, dear Nelson,
ihat I feel convinced that you love me for myself alone-that you loved
me" as the poor, penniless orpha , 'I trust that you will not love the
wealthy heiress less."
"' What do you mean, dearest ? come, explain;:" said Nelson, hold-
.    4g er to his heart. "Come, come, tell nc what you mean."
"Oh' nothing ; only, that I have practiced Alittle deception upon

you, just to test your love. Instead of being the dependent niece ot my
' witch of an old aunt,' I am heirees to seventy thousand dollars; and,
that thismnension and grounds, which you so much admire,.is to be our
future home; that is, if you wish it, to be so. I amyour wife, and
all that I possess is yours, my own de r husband."
Mrs. Field could not be prevailed upon to shares with her "dear
children," as she termed them, their elegant honie.:So, with  kind,
faithful female domestic, she returned to her ownquiet home in New
York.
'Aunt Deborah remained with her niece, the same, good-natured, and
apparently happy-hearted creature we found her.' And the lhst time
the writer caught sight of her, she held a tiny babe iR her arms wrapt
up in any quantity of flannel, while she glided lightly and noiselessly
about the chamber, where lay the pale-faced mother, who had fallen
into a gentle slumber.
4 letter fell from the hand of old Mrs. Field; and taking her 'specs'
from her nose to wipe away the tears which had gathered in her dim
eyes, she said, in a broken voice:
"Got a babe; a little girl. Oh, my God!' spare it to make glad their
hearts'; and may they be spared to train and guide it in the ight path.
May no rude blast chill'its tender maidenhood. Yes," she cognued,
" and they have called 't Leonnie."
At this exclamation t ie old woman burst into tears; and falling upon
her knees, she breathed forth the following prayer:
"Oh, Heavenly Father ! keep this sweet blossom of true love and
affection from the wily snares of tlie base betrayer. May the history a
of her grand-mother's wrongs and sufferings prove a warning to Ler,
and may she have strength, should the hour of trial come, to resist
temptation.
Not long after this event, the old lady passed away, in a full hope of
salvation, through er Redeemer ; and in a quiet spot near theresidence
of Nelson, she rests in peace.
And nowin taking leave of this happy fainilyNelson and Carrie,
with their little pledge of devoted love, and good"Aunt Deborah, who
was instrumental in bringing about all this peace and felicity, that for
the meekness and patience with which they bore thcii- several afflictions,
which Providence, in its all-wise arrangements saw fit to visit upon

crown encircles them, a al may thejflive long to cnjoy it in undisturbed

from their beauty and fragrance. We find her making them her com-r
panions even after Reason had deserted'her throne. If she had faults,
they must have sprung from lack of careful training during-the tender
years of childhood; or, perhaps, disappointed hopes in girlhood. The
richest soil often produces the most p6isonous and cankerous weeds, if
not properly cultivated. Some early blight or bitter disappointment
may have turned the current of the placid stream into rough and angry
waters. At a tenderagealone and friendless, she launched her frail
bark upon the broad ocean of public opinion; and without counting
upon adverse winds, she thought to stebr clear of shoals and quick-
sands. There were many ways before her, and if, through lack of ex-
perience, she chose the wrong one, there perhaps was no kind voice to
call her back; but thousands of brainless, heartless ones to cheer her
on to ruin, for the mere satisfaction of witnessing the wreck which they
had helped to, make.  or the last fewyears of her life, as if weary of
the mistaken course she had pursued, she turned- her mind upon more
useful matters, and became an humble follower in that faith which, let
us hope, has fitted her for the companionship of the blessed in the realms
of that unon9wn shoreto which the great and pioud, as well as the
poor and humblejmust sooner or later be summoned,' to answer for the
deedscommitted here. I trust her own sex, at least, -,ill never permit
a harsh remark to pass their lips inregard to her past life. Dear lady
readers, speak only of her good qualities; for had she, like many of
you, been surrounded by kindly influencs-her young mind trained
to moral worth-her ambition checked by the gentle and loving voice
of a mother,; had brothers And sisters, and kind friends gathered
around the fireside of her early home and watched her into woman-
hood, with her lofty and towering talent, she might have been, the
1rihtest ornambent of the present age.
