CHAPTER I.
A FAMILY PARTY.
T rhere Wa'S a cloud on Edward ClerVil e's brow,
a graVity on his :lip, that contrasted strongly with
the smiles- of pleased approbation which the faces
of his bi-other and two sisters wore. .Their father
hatd just announced to them his approaching mar-
riage, and now looked around with some anxiety
to mark the effect of the communication. The
congratulations and good wishes 4of his daughteis
and their eldest Jbrother were uttered warmly and'
affectionately. Edward spoke,'too, with becom-
ing respect ; but there was no, cordiality in his.
studied sentences. Mr. Clerville rose and stood
on the hearth so as to 'face the .little circle.
He was still a handsome man, notwithstanding
the slight baldness upon his -forehead and a lit
tle spring ling of silver in the dark hair, which~
b;etokene4 that life, with him, had passed its me&amp;
ridian. His figure, though portly, was not un~

of~proportion which almost' always accompanies a
genial nature and quiet, untroubled tenoi~ of ex-
istence. As he glanced around now, his eye
rested on {wo youths and~ two i~a.idens, of wh6s~
paternity any man migbt4justly haVe been proud.

SONNITS TO QENEYRA, which ate, pei~iaps, equal

Ton's ot~er writings. Almost pctii'e in size, her
figure was fairy-like in lightness and proportion.
one but must have acknowledged her b~auti-
fu I, but of too et1~ereal beauty to. excite general
ad'mir~tion. The' ordinary beholder would pause.
a. moment and gaze, as at "some ~marble saint
pitchedd in cathedral Wall," ai~d*the~ pass onto

H&amp; younger sister, Kate, was as unlike Lucy

possible. The tall, lit1~e figure, quick 'but

f4ce, with an unusual expression' of seriousness,
notwithstanding the smile on herjips. One hand

ret~.ited carelessly on her knee, the' (AAlCr toyed
idly with the hair of her brother Frauk, next to
whom she sat, the fingers twisting aiid untwi~L

F ran k (i5lerville's face was a very han4~-oim
one-bat that was 'its least attraction. So JoId~
genial and kindly his air, that misanthropy itseh
must have turned abashed from a physiognomy
which so obviously confused jts dark theory ot
mafi' s nature. Like Kate's, his face was morc
serious thaii at mosf times. Ther&amp; was even, an
expression of anxiety upon it, as lie glanced from
his father's face to that of his bi~tlier, who loaned
beside thb chimney, his elb~v resting' on the
niantle-piece, while his hand opened an4 ~hu~th~
1eav~s of a 'book which lay thereon. Â£dward~s
physique combined the charact&amp;istics ~qf both
his sisters. The tall, symmetrie~al form and dark
hair andNeyes of Kat~ were tempered by thTe pale~ -
ness an~d repose of Lucy's face. *lt did not need

ANADvI~TURE.
Dare.~devil's visit'of a' fortnight wa~ over, and 'Fi'ank
had accompanied' him as far as Scarsborough, on his~
departure. Kate and Blanche wa~ked'out in the after-
noon to meet Frank as he was returning. Their path
i~ay throughh a pretty Wood, That was inteTrsected mi&amp;.
way by ~a river, which held within its chrystid - arms a
beautiful, picturesque ~iittle-" island. Frank and E4...
ward had been accu~torned in their boyhood to nevi.
gate 'this - stream in a small ~b$at of very primitive'
Construction, the chief t~eoo iidi~tion of which: wa.~

negroes, when they preferred     in the~middie'&amp;f-
~1wtiyer, ~ . The ;b~nk; i~nd

was fastened by' a long, stout chain, to a stake driven
firmly into the ground..
"Suppose we get in the boat, and go across to the
island?" said Kate. "Frank has oftenitaken me over,
toÂ§get muskadines and grapes. There ar~so many
~ vines thei e. Is it not a beautiful place?"
"Beautiful!" answered Blanche. "I- should. like
very much to g~o, though it is now too ~late foi~ ifiusca-
diiies and gi~apes. But I am afraid we vould uot
inan~tge the canoe. Tust think of our sailing off
down stream. We"
"Oh!" interrupted Kate, "' I am sure we can man-
age it. It is as light-"as pos~ible. 'See~ we can. try
~ 'first without unchaining it.' You take that pole.
There-I told you so," she exclaimed in triumph, as,
by their united efforts they propelled the little dug-
K Qiltup stream as. far as thq chain '~oijld admit of its
~ going. "Now we will push uj close 'to the'bank and
unloose it," coritiwued Kat~e, binding with all her
~strengthagainst the pole she held.
"I am almost graid," said Blanche, 'doubtfully.
~ "Do. you really think thnt if we unchain it, it will not
run away with us?"
." Why, I am sure it can't. Why.should not we row

~answered Blanche, laughing~
They pushed the c~inoe close to the bank-and
after tugging until their deli'~ate hands h*~d exchanged
The hue of the lily for thatof the rose, they succeeded
in drawing the heavy iron ring fro~n over the stake.
Dropping the clattering length of chain into the bot~~
torn of the boat, they pushed with all their might;
but, at first, to no purpose. Th~ dug-out s~ernPd

"Ph ! "' exclaimed Kat~, suddenly4 "we ought to

Blanche; you were pushi~ig uS down th&amp; current."
"How learnedly you speak," said blanched; but you
were~ right, I declare. This is really delightful. We
must come on the i~v~r often~, Frank shall have us
a summer-house made on the island-and what charm.~

"Take care,'~ cried Kate. warningly. "We ar'e ap~
proaching the bank. Steady there," ~he oxciarinied,
with affected gravity.. ~FNOW~~~
Thump went the boat~, giving them ,such a rude.
jostle ~.s almost to upset their equilibrium.' Laughing
"and glowing with the unaccustomed and violrnit e~er-
ti~n they had been making, they, lifted thQ chain, and
sprang upon th~bahk.

"I think we can m~'ike it fast with thig," she said.
Having wound the chain several- times about the
trunk of a slender tree- on the' margi~i of the 'water,
they passed the stick through the iron ring and one
link of the ~ thus holding the two together quite
securely.~
"H.xv' clever ~ve ar~!" they both exclaimed-and
by this time quite wearied out~ sat themselves on a
soft cushion of moss to rest.
"1 wonder what Frank will say when he comes and
finds us here'?" 'said Kate.
8'\~That will l~e say, sure enough," answered Blanche..
"I have an idea he will not think it as amusing as we
do.' Indeed, Katydid,'I expect we ~h~~r get two scold-
ings for coming here- one from Frank, and: the other
from Mamma."
"Do yoi~ think ~o ?~ Then we had better return as
speedily as possible. But I am so tired.' We must
rest a little first. My arms really ache. Don~t yours ?"
"Yes~yonder cQmes GleucOc."
As she spoke Frank's great Newfoundland dog
emerged from the bushes on t:he other ~ide the river,
'and plnn-ging into the water, swam ovcr to the island.'
"If we should be in 'danger of drowning,. he ca~i~

Â£' I doubt whdher we sh~iLll find a.nyv~er~ dry~wood

make it ignite, if we did find it."
"Rather than stay here all night, and frighten
them all to de~th~-for ~they would be certain to

there are a great maviy rocks all the way across.

both, and Blanche was about to rise precipitate1~ from
her seat, when she perceived that Edward was so in-i-
mediately before her, almost touching her dress, that
to pass huiii, wduld be impossible;' and he did not seem
at all inclined to move. After starting forward, there-

She turned from him; pushed the' table hastily aside,
and flew rather~ than glided across the rooms to an-
other door, which led into an ante-chaniber. GrQat

awake to lament her brother' s absence. Her soft,
regular breathing'soon told Blanche that she slept;
but it was in vain Blanche shut her eyes: and tried to-
emulate so good an example. Despite every effort of
'~resistance, she could not but d~elI on the thought of
*Edward's departure. She was not in love with him,
assuredlyj she did not even like him,, she believed;.
but she was very conscious of an interest regarding
him that might easily have glided into' liking.-per-
haps love. His face haunted her as no other face had;
and that the tones of his voicewere pleasant to her ear,
-she needed no better eVidence ,th~n that of the quick-
cued puls~tion they had latterlyA'ailed notto produce.
And then only twq -day~ before, she believed itc~r-
tam that he lOved her! Beforethat she had struggled
against indulging a single thought of him; but there
was something very captivating in the i.4ea of, li-is Si-
lent devotion. She had been mistaken~ of course-
and she upbraided herself bitterly for the vanity ~y
whIch she had been misle~d. She must banish all re~
collection. of him fron&amp; her mind ;~ fortunately, his
image had not yet taken possession of h~r heart, ~
thought. He was gone-.-and there was an end of the
little romance she had half uncons.cious~1y cjierished'.
She ~congratulated herself that she would have no
embarrassing meeting to dread on to-morrow, or to-
morrow, or to-morrow:; at which comfortable reflec-.
non she wept heartily; and finally went.to sleep, after
wishj ng 'for the first time that her mother had not
married-and that sh~ had never: seen Edward Cier-
vilfe.
The next morning, she awoke 'with a severe head-

yiil~-~h0 had a great horror of a sore-throat--p1~e-

cheeks and languid eyes 'excited so much comment:

Mrs. Clerville, who' insisted 'oii her returning to her

into hot water~, and wentto bed afterwards, as directed.
Her mother having suP'erinteiided the affair' to that
point, kissed her and Lucy and Kate, and left the

seating herself on the 6t.her, side, read, in her soft and

Benedick and Beatrice, totally uiPSonscious how Blanche

for the time. '
She awoke the next morning amazed ~rt herself fdr

During their run down, the river, a;nd for several days

he looked up in surprise;
"You know I iiever e~chafiged haifa dozen words

- 'You* ixiisunder~tand me,? said Frank,- 'and seem
to, forget that we are liot within the prohibited d~e-

She shook her head reprovingly. 'It is not right
to jest oi~ such ~ subject, Frank."
~I am not jesting. Why- should yQwthink so?'
Uttering au exclamation/of astonishment, she turned

.fle smiled. '
Pshaw, Frank, I knew you were j~ngt But it

put such an idea itito your head ? It seems very
strange to me. Unaccountable.'
'Why sQ? I have long entertained it."'
She looked in his face-with unfeigned amazement.

'Not the sort of love one entertain~ f~ r the person

that you possess, Blanche?' ~
Only theoretic, I assure yo~x.
'Ah! then lain satisfied. 'I beganto be alarrned-

'Because- I am exceedingly 'perplexed, and a little.

her stupor of surprise. 'Such a declaration frdm you
is' so entirely unexpected, that 'I can' scarcely credit

'This-is the first time you ever thought of me asa

to announce to Mi~s* Yarassa that their voyage was

at the' door of the ladie&amp;'cabin. It was the first time
he had asked admittance there. Every day punctili.~

'Good night. You are Tvery kind,' said Xirnena.
She turned away.
He went to enquirer about, her unele. The clerk,
on -consultix~g -his book, told him that there was no
General Wal-wortli in the hotel. There 'was an-A.
H. Walworth, and- -a George D. ~Walworth. Perhaps
one of these was. the gentleman he' was- in search of.
Edward too-k out his note-book tif be certain as- to
-the name. No; he~ was afraid not. j The- name was
Cenera~ Amher8t Walw6rth. The clerk suggested that
the- gentleman might possibly have left off his tifle,
and put in hismiddle name,- 'thus causing a difference
of address.. Edward did ~not think this likely under
the circumstances; but -it ~was easy to ascertain -
whether it was so. Obtaining the number of -A. II.
Walworth's room, h&amp; prot~eeded thither, accompanied
by a servant, to whom he gave his eard, desiring him.
to knock at' the door, take the card. irf to the gentle-
man, and sar that he ~wi~hed to speak -to him for' a
momei~t on very partirn~ilar business, if'he h&amp;d i~ot re-
tired. A crack of light under the door showed that
there was- a. light burning in the room, so that Ed-
ward felt no hesitation about intruding.

ti5n. lie knocked again.
'What do you want, and be d~-d to you?' was
the' civil demand from within. - -
'Here's- a gentleman- wants-to se~ you on very-pa'-

'I never -'do business at twelve o'clock at night, tell

whether thjs was the man he sough~; so he'said to the
grinning servant:
'Ask himif he is General Walwortlkof Kentucky?'.
'The gentleman says, is you General Walworth, of
Kei~tucky ?' bawled the servant.
There was no Verbal answer;' but there was. the
sudden movement of a chair, as if dome ones had
risen hastily-a step passed across the room, the door
Was unlocked and opened with a jerk, and a young
man, with light disordered hair, flushed face, and al-
together ;a very dissipated look, st'&amp;od before edward
in ft owning impatience.
Now Edward, though very shy with women, had
never been troubled with the least diffidence towards
any onb of his own sex;' and .as A. H. Walwortli's
glance met his quiet eye, and~rested on the half smile
of 'his lip, that gentleman's manner modified itself
considerably. in the same instant, Edward himself
recollected that some apology Wa's due for his mistake
and 'untimely intrusion. He therefore'bowed, 1~egged
pardon for having disturbed Mr. Walwortli, in conse-
quence of a misapprehension, the nature of which he
briefly explained, bowed again and retired to~ his
chamber, sati~fled that he had better delay all further
inquiries concerning General Walworth until he could
prosecute them to'more advantage9 It was 'possible,
he reflected, that he had mistaken the hotel at which
'the General. was-to meet his relatives. The name, he
was. sure, he had right, as he had taken a note qf it
at the time.. He supposed he should be able to find
himout in the morning. It would be decided1 em-
barrassing if' he did not. What,' in that case, eould
he do with the, young lady ?~ He went to sleep jon~

II in a young gentleman who had' never before so
much as. asked a young lady to dance, far less to go
to breakfast with him. He smiled as' this thought
occurred to himself~ while waiting for the answer to
hi~ message; and to beguile the time, walked up
to ~he looking-glass and gave an additional brush-
ing to' the glossy waves of his dark hair, remarking,
for the first time, that he was much sunburnedd.
Leaning toward the mirror, he~ scanned his face closely,
then began to brush his bearcV hard and fast. It was
a beard to' he vainof! Black, curling, and very thick.
He had long worn a moustachee; ~ut this. beard was
of Mexican growth, and, like' all Mexican vegetable
productions, of tropical iuxuriaiice. Before he had
finished arranging it to his satisfaction, Thomas re-
turned.. Miss Yarassai' s compliment~ and thinks-

to say to her )at table. 'As she was a foreigner, the
peculiarities of climate and' ~the customs of the Cres-

conversatfon. He had concluded to ask her if she
had. ever seen as damp a day before; intending to in-

generally, extremely damp ~in New Orleans ; that it

But the luggage weighed heavily oii hTh Pii4d, and
just as he was about to enter the hotel, he bethdught
him. that his best plan would be to haiid hi~ list to a

*He glanced at her again. She was looking straight
before her, evidently forgetful of his presence, and
the'expression of her large dark eye was so mourn-
ful that the half-sentiiy~ent' of impatience which had
been excited by what he considered her stupidity
was instantly checked by a gush of generosity and
pity. For the first' time he felt, what almost any
other man would have '~felt long before, a seiise of,
protection and proprietorship towards the lonely and'
~Iovely girl thus accidentally entrusted to his care.

knew jt.~~~ld. be ~6Ao himself. Perhaps she mighI~
object to going, and wish himto take her on to Ken-

so passive afid indifferent. Altogether, it was a-
a very unp1e~s~nt dilemma in which he was placed.
lie resumed his pen, and continued' his sentence-~

the young lady might accompany him, as there

He' was tWe4..-more tired' in mind than in. body-~

Here was" he-he, Edwai'd' Clerville-the piotector
and traveling companion pf-~.a young lady! itwas
really incredible! He was tempted to douht his own
identity! A young 'lady'! And such ~ young lady!
~o quiet and matter of course in her manner of re-
ce iving bis attention that he could not blame any one
,for taking 'her to be his Wife, as he perceived that
everybody did. Not the slightest symptom~ ~about
her of that' little flutter and consciousness which
most young ladies would have exhibited. If she had
been eight instead of eighteen, and he seventy in~
stead of twenty-five, she could not have been moi~
composedly trusting afid. simple in her air to~v~rds
him. No wonder that he had been greeted with con-
gratulations on. his marriage by two acquaintances,
fellow passengers, who saw him.coine on beard with
iMiss Yarassa leaning upon his arm, and followed by
her servants, his servant and horse, and their u~'iited
arPay of trunks. Quite ,a family party they undoubt-

toward the bluff that stood out boldly against the
* eastern sky; expecting to see his brother and th~ car-
riage. Neither was visible. It was strange; Surely his
letter must have bee-fl received in time. With a sud-
den misgiving he put his hand into his bi~east pocket,
- and there it was! Drawing it forth with ~ 'muttered
objuration a~ his own. 'careless forgetfulness, and the
habit which Thomas ht~d of being out of the way
just when he was most wanted, Edward twiste d the
unoffending paper into the likeness of a cigar,. aiid
threw it 'into the water. As thre was no signal for
the .boat; to stop, she held on her way up the river.
A flush of vexation mounted to Edward's brow a~
he thought of the annoy&amp;nces he must encounter 'in
landing atScarsborough. He-was well 1~nown there,
and, like all small towns, it' wa~ a~ gossiping- place.
The people who chanced to see him would be sure to
participle i-n- the mistake by, which lib had already
been ~nade so uncomfortable. He should be stared
at; i~poken to, and talked about Ifrith real village

minutes-and he ought surely to have been satisfied
with such unusual expedition. -jl3ut he had not~ in
the meantime, escaped notice. His- face was aflame
I with confusion, and his manner very forbiddingly
haughty, as he led Miss Yarassa to the ~carriage,
handed her in, and, following~ with all eQuvenietit
[speed himself, drove away~ leaving Thomas to provide
for the ~onveyance of the rest of the party.
He leaned back in his corner, and glanced over at
his fair companion as she reclineil in hers, curibu~ to
discover whether' she had observed and understood
the smiles and look~ so intelligible to himself. It
was plain thAt she ~had not. Sh~ was as pale and
numoved' as usual. By this ti-me he had grown
to consider her as.a breathing automaton, upon whom
words would be wasted. Their drive of ten miles
passed in absolute silence. He was thinking of the
cha~g~s that had. occurred since he left home., It
Was less than - two years, and yet how great. were
these~ changes! Lucy, Kate, Frank; all married--and
his step-mother dead! And Blanch~I he could meet
her now, as the wife of his brother,-with composure.
His ill-starred love troubled him no more. l$ut,
looking back in the calm spirit with which we can
regard things that are of the past, he rejoiced that
he had checked it. in its early growth by absence,
and that a sense of m6ral right, as well aeo'f hono~'
towards his brother, had enabled him later to conquer
it entirely, for he felt that it had been, th~4 it would*~
ever remain the one passion ofThis life. Had it taken.
firmer root in his heart, he might have been a miser-
~1e man. As it was, though he knew that he could

CHAPTER XXT.

RE-AOTJON.
They had left' S carsborough late, and it Was now
sQmep~me ~aftet~ 4dark. The hail 'door w~s open-the
lamp. b~ifrning~verythiii~ looking just as usual. And
yet Edward felt the'~ chang~. There. was' a stillness,
an 'air.hid.escribable, but oppressive, hanging over the
place. No~ ~ ha'ZI' heard their approach~,. it seemed,
as'riot eyea a servafit came to meet them. Edward
*   crossed the hall, passed through  a ccirridor, and
stopped a moment~ at the sitting-room door. Ic was
*   opefr~ and h&amp; could l&amp;ok in on the f~Anily so reduced
in irn~bers since l~e had joined' them last around the
table ~Wh~i~they now sat .~t' tea. Only three-his
father, Fraiik ~nd Blanche 1

eye ~i'ested btit art instant on the familiar fQrm, which,
as he' saw it, looked unaltered, and passiji~g 'Pr~~
with a slight moinentar~r glance, paused at the o ST

seemed to. him a ~tranger. While h~ involuntarily
shaded his sight to &amp;btain a clearer vision, a siigl~t
movement of Ximena's, as she stood beside him, re-
called his wandering thoughts. Without allowing
himself time for further hesitation, he entered the
room.
Blanche saw him first. At her slight exclamation,
Frank looked up, and rose quickly from the table, &amp;nd
I~Ir.' C lerville, turning liis head. awl perceiving' him',
started up too. Ximena remained standing near the
door as Edward hastened forward to meet them. A
few broken words were interch&amp;nged as they gr~spQd
each other's hand-and then Edward turned to
Blanche. She 'had risen, and stood, her hand ex-
tended, as he' approached. Neither spoke. * The .sight
of her pale face and black dress shocked Edward in-
expressiblY; and as she felt. the convulsive trembling
of his han~1, she ~ould.'s~rcClY maintain~the foree4
composure for which she w~s struggling. Ed~
ward bent his head over h~r hand, and his tears feW
upon~it, as he pressed it to his lip's. It was the mute
assurance 'of his sympathy in her sorrow-for~ all this
moment there was n6 thought, even ~his heart,~ave
for the kind mother who was gone.
Mr. Olerville and Frank both glanced at Ximena,
and the, former took a 'step towards her, saying to
Edward-
* 'Have you brought :tne.anoth~r daughWr, my son?'
Then let me welcome her home."'
'Oh! pardon. me!' exclaimed Edward, quickly.
No,' father:; this ,,yoflng lady-' he huri~ied to her
si  and said, 'Allow m~ to present to you my father
.~niy .~r&amp;ther2'' Scarcely giving either party time to
ack~o dge ~the introduction, h~ took Ximena"s
hand a~1~rned to Blanche ,who had advanced. 'I

stammei~ out, '-whom I am su-re--' he 'ended his' sen-.
tei~ce by placing the' passive hand he held in that of
Blanche,. Who pressed it very 'cordially, murmured
some words of welcc.me,. and drew Ximena to' 'a '6hair,
saying gently, 'Sit down and let me take off your
bonnet.'
'Ximeua. submitted. without opposition, and Dianche
removed her bonnet and mantle, while Edward shook

in New Orleans, alluding slightly 'to his detention

expla~n~d about the letter which' 'he had written, but

and the letter had both something to' do with her.

betrothed? It did- not' look so. There were no
glances of' intellige~ie~ nor 3ven a word exchanged
between them. Edw4A~4 seemed to have forgotten
her very existence, a~ he 'sat absently sdrring' his
eoff~e and looking 'intently at Blancjw. Tue young

Blanche mentally echoed- Kate's'~ opinion, ,that he was
the strangest person she ever ~a-w inter life.
Despite her efforts and those of 1\fr. Clerville and
Frank, conversation languished. In fact, none of
them knew what to talk' about. Edward seemed to
avoid speaking of- Mexico, they all noticed. lie was
ahiiost as silent as Ximena. Shortly after tea was
over, Blanche a~ked her guest if she would like to
retire- and Ximena answering affirmatively, they left
the room.1 Summoning, the maid, BTh~nche led the
way up stairs into the chamber next her own, glanced

'Jenny will bring you any thing you want, Mi-'
She broke off .the word in the .midd1~. How e~ces~

'Yes-that i~ his name,7 'answered Blanche, won-

~'And you are his sister?'

'~But how can' you weep. so-?' exclaimed Ximena in
a tone of surprise-~-almost of envy. 'I cannot weep:
I have knot shed a 'tear since' my mother died!'
Blanche pressed her hand. -
'I am ~o weary-weary!' continuedd the poor girl
mournfully. 'If I could but go to ~le.ep,' and never
wake again! But I am very yeung. .1 fear I- shall
live a. long tim~. Do you think it a sin to tray for'
death?'
Before Blanche could answer, Ximena s eye ~acci-
dentally fell upon the ~et rosary. Which' the former
wore depen*ng from her girdle-and which', she had
taken in her hand while Ximena Was spe~king. Evi-
dently soriie sudden thought or association was' ~ng-
gested.to the young Spanish girl by the sight of this
rosary. 11cr lips trembled.-~.and therewas an expres-
sion of troubled thoi7ight in her eye: of doubt or ap-
prehension. At this moment a low~knock at the door
was followed immediately by the enfrai~e of Jenny,
au~rnnpanied by Juanita. Acknowledging the re-
spectful sal~itation of the woman,.' a.&amp; she advanced
towards them, Blafiche rose from her lowly seat,
thinking. that' Ximeua wQuld probably wish' now to
retire. 'She turned to say good-night-but Xhnena
'had. started' forward eagerly, and spoke a few words
rapidly, in Spanish, to her maid,' who answered
hesitatingly; and with. an air of deprecation.
~ Give it me! give it me!' cried her young mistress,
in .English. 'Give me myflio~ther's rosary 1'
Unwillingly, as it seemed, Juanita pr9duced it from
among the folds of the kerchIef 'that covered her bo-
Soul. Ximena caught it with hurried hand, and held
itup to the light. It was o~ 'lapis lasuli, 8et in gold,
and sparkled in the rays of the lamp, as ~t sWayed to

the young orphan saw as she gazed upon it! With a
sudden low cry of anguish she sank on her knees,, and
clasped tl~e precious relict to her heart* and then
the passion of grief which had so long been prisoner,
asi twere~ within her breast, burst forth with fearfUl
violence. She fell forward upon the fipor, writhing
convulsively.' Her tears had'corne at last,, and they
came in storm! lier weeping, compared to that of
Blanche'&amp;, was like the tornado of the ' tropics to a
gentle summer shower. -

writhing form-and ~tr9ve to caln~i the frightful vehe.

orphan refused to be comforted, aiid Wer broken, de-

Blanche could 'notforbear a smile, while at tha same

CHAPTER XXII.
TTVEMORS AGAIN.-

*    -- As soon as - Blanche and Ximena had retired; Ed~
ward explained to his father and~ Frank the chance
-~ circumstances by which Xim-ena1 had been tlI!own
upon his p-rotection----enquiring ~of the finer if he
* rememb~i'ed having been acquainted with the youn~
lady's mother.
'What did you say the name was?' asked Mr. (Dlei~
vil-le. -
'Yarassa.' - -
~' Her maiden name, I mean.'
'Walworth, I suppose.' That is the name of her
brothel', whom I could not ftnd.'
'Walworth!' repeated Nr, Clerville. 'Oh ,ye~;1
recollect now. - Miss Walworth! - She was a schooL
mate of your mothers, I think. At least, a fijend of
hers. I remerubef. Her parents were ~very much
opposed to this marriage ;~ snot from any objection to
Yarassa himself, I. believe, but because they naturally
objected to his living in Mexico. I think.I heard af-
terwards, however~ that they generally resi4d in
- Europe-spending very little time in Mexico.'
'Miss, Yarassa speaks English like a fiative,' said
Edward.                            -
'Poor child!' observed4 Frank. "She - miis~, have
been very much disappointed and embarrassed at not
meeting her uncle in-New Orleans.". -
Edward thought, but an impulse -of delicacy pr(~
vented hi~ saying, that she Was not half as much dis"
appointed and emba~was~cd as he himself had been:
He mentioned having written to General Walworth,
and asked he father whether he supposed' it ~
be neca~aary to write~ again~

I thuiik so,' was the reply. And meanwhile I
hope Blanche can make her contented to remain here.
I am very gla~d, my son, that accident enabled y~u to
render this service to the daughter of your mother's
friend.'
Blanche here entered ~the room, and heard the his-
tory qf Edward's protectorship of Ximena, relating, in
return, the sudden paroxysm of grief into whidi- the
~ poor girl ha~'fall~n a.t~he sight of her mother's ros-
~ ary. WithouKdoubt EdWard. shared to some extent
~ the sentiments of compassion sb warmly expressed
by his father, Blanche arid Frank for the apparentlyy
friendless cpndition and sad bereavement of the
young orphan; but he, nevertheless, could not help
thinkihg- what a fortunate thing it was for him that
this paroxysm did not occur --on board the vessel as
they were crossing the gulf, or at the hotel, or on the
boat c~miiig up the river. Such a circumstance
[*6uld i~ave complicated his embarrassments ~greatly
was rejoiced that the young lady was safely trans-
ferred~ from his hands to those of Blanche. lie
glanced at them-her hands-as this thought crossed
his mind, and gave a quick start-~on1y just restrain-
ing the exclamation that rose to his lips. Just then
Blanc-he rose, and, paying she would return to Xi-
mena, bade them' all good night. Edward was so
absorbed in hi&amp;own reflections that he entirely for-
- got ~* acknowledge and return the salutation until
after she had left the room.
lie was thinking-thinking of-her hand. There
was no wedding ring upon -it I A m~gnificeizit dia-
mond blazed uvon her engagement finger, but wed.k
ding ri~ig there wa~ not! Could it be possible that
they were uta married yet? He had taken it for
granted that they were, because Mrs. Clervill&amp;'~ death
had- noU occurred until some tiPie after the date set for

*   the marriage.' Could anything have happened t~
prevent it before that? He hoped not! lie did hon-
estiy~and earnestly hope not! For since' it was fated
that she could hot be 'his, he wished the barrier that
would separate them forever to be erected at once.
So loi~g ~.s he had considered her actually the wife of
Frank, ~he had' been resigtied, had thought. hi~ '1~ve
was extinct but no sooner did he entertain a doubt
on the subject, than the same love blazed up again
furiously. It' had been covered, it seemed, but not
extinguished~ by the ashes of despair. If thoae
ashes had rainedd undistubed, no dQubt it would
have died out-in time ; but stirred up, and pushed
aside by this discovery, the fire 'had free vent' again.
Frank and his father talked -on; he answered like
one in a dream; sometimes blundering upon the
sense of what they said, ahd ansWering per~tinently-
but oftener giving response so wide of the nark, that
they began to suspect his thoughts to be with Ms fairs
traveling companion~Â±particularly as he every now
and then looked around' nervously at the door, and
once asked Frank, quite abruptly, if it was not pro-
baJ~1e that Blanche would be down again that night.~
r)       Frank said he supposed not, as she had bidden them
good-night; adding thaI~ h&amp; hoped ~IVJiss Yarassa had
become composed before this time. Edward blushed
withv-exatioii, as he perceived that' he wa~ c6nsid~
ered to beAn great anxiety about Miss ~ara~sa..
At length, to his great relief, 'Mr. Clerville remark-
ing that it was late, rose to retir~. Edward' willingly

ner to disclaim the implied impeachment, breakfast
was ready-the opportuHity lost.
During the whole of breakfast, his face was a per~
nianeht erimsqn. Dr. iEldridge~ met him very cor-
dially, and naturally supposing that ha would be as
much concerned about the young lady-whom he
understood to be under his care-as the rest of the
family were, began to assure him he hoped there wa~
nothing serious to be apprehended in her case, but
that, a~ he had no pressing call elsewhere, he should
remain during the day to watch the symptoms.~ Jie
thGught it~rob~ble that fever might come on towards
evening , but he trusted it could 1.ie easily managed.
Much more he said, which~Edward did not hear. The
doctor; observing his embarrassment at the first men-
tion of Miss Yarassa, instantly came to the same con~
clusion the others had; and though he was too'well
bred to alhide, either directly 6r indirectly, to it, his
smile and the tone of his remarks wt~r~ not to be
mi~sun4erstood. Edward sat indignant, but, alas I
speechless. Under similar circumstances, Frank
would have extricated himself from the suspicion with-
out the least difficulty by simply informing them all
of their mistake. But there is the"misf~rtune of your
diffident man. Speech andy ideas always fail him
just at his utmost need. Edward knew that if he at-
tempted an explanation he would stammer and blush
so that it would make bad worse. He was compelled
to en~.ure his wrongs in silence.
lie left the breakfast table &amp;S; soon as he pos~ib1y
could, strode iudignantly into tI~fe iibr~iry, and began
hastily, to invite. a letter.. A ver~.bj'ief and not over

his fault it' he was not: delivered from the imputation
by the speedy departure of the object of his supposed
admiration.. He was joined by Frank as he was
putting ~ the document.
'Is that a death warrantt you are folding ?''said
Frank, with a smile. 'You look as stern and reso-
lute as if it was.'
'No, it is merely a     iiI~s letter,' he replied,
placing it in 'an envelope. Taking a p~en, he hastily
dashed oW the direction.
'General Walworth,' paid Frank, leaning ~ver his
* shoulder to read it; '~your fair Creole'~ uncle, I sup-
pose? But would it not be better~, Edward, for my
father to write to hix~? Let me see what you have
said, will you?'
He took the letter from Ed\vard's hand, openeded it,
* glanced over the very few lines' it contained, and
looked at his brother in surprise.
'Why, my 'dear fellow, this will never do! ~So
eold-it is scare ely civil! The man des'~rves no b~t-
ter, I grant you, if it is by hi~ vQhintary fault that

mediately around it's own base. A little Fiench watch
was placed where the light fell broadest-; and a book,
with4 a jet.mounted fan -resting on its open' page, lay
half within the circle, and half in the surrounding
obscurity;
Blanche removed theNshade, lifted -the lamp, and
approached the bed., Gathering the transparent fol ds
of the. net-' ii4o one hand, and holding it. up in a
graceful festoon, she threw the light full over the
figure reposing on the snowy couch beneath, and mo-~
tioned Frank to her side.
Seldom do~ sculptor mould, or~ painter portray,
xno~re consummate beauty of form and tints, than were
4 combined in the living model before them: She -was
resting on the left side, with her head thrown~ slight-
ly back on the' pillow, so that- almost her" full face,
and the throat, were visible. The left hand,- from the
closed fingers of which fi~ll. several' loops of tie blue
and - gold rosary, supported the cheek. The- black
hair escaping from the little' lace cap into which
Blanche' had ga~there~ it, was spread over the pillow
in luxuriant profusion; and the brows and lashes,'
equally black, w~re marvels of delicate 'pencilling;
The check was~ blooming -with the 'fever - flush, and
the crimson lips. just parted sufficiently to give a
- glimpse 'of. teeth 'white as the p~ulp of- the cocoa-nut.
The 'sheet had-been pushed to the wa~ist,~ by 'a move-
mentof the' right hand, which 'was thrown forward
carlesaly~ looking 'like' an exquisite carving of ivory-
go motionless and clearly chiselled was it-and the''
lovely -bust, thus revealed, swelled softly the white
drapery thc.t covered it."

'Oh! Frank,' exclaimed Blanche, clasping her
hands, "has she taken too much veratrurn?' -'
On the contrary, not eno~igh yet, I. believe. She
must have the other dose at three- o'clock; as her
pulse is still more than a hundred. But, as you oh-

reason of ~r. Lorimei's lingering so every morning,

- peeled. Leaving the table, they went intc~ the charm.

inside of one of the sheets,) she proceeded eagerly to
devour the contents.
It commenced with a slight excuse for not writing,
the reason of which' Kate would understand as she
read 3n, and immediately plunged then into a descrip...
tion of I~dw~rd's arrival; and of tife beautiful stranger
whom he had brought with him. Kate was made to
participate in all the astonished bewildern~ent.which
Blanche herself had 'felt, and finaThy rdieted of the
sate iii -the course ~f the fourth page, by hearing~the
true circumstances 'of the case. Th&amp;i came a re~a-
tion of Ximena~'s illness: the horrible fright Blanche
had been in when she found her. insensible. Frank's
and the Doctor's cruel modes of restoring conscious
ness; Ximcna's amazement when, on becomifig fully
awake, she florid her head, 'hand's and feet so painful
as to shrink at the gentlest touch, and w~s informed
that she had only been kept alive by the applications
which had reduced tlien~ to that coi~idition.
'She is still suffering,' the letter continued, 'with
a slow fever, which the 'doctor says is not dangerous,
but ma~Ir "hang on" for weeks, unless her mind can
be roused and interested' as it is mental depression,
far mere than bodily illness, which is the matter with
her. I can well uiiderstand this; and I endeavor, but
vainly, to interest and amuse her. Alas! I kn~w too*~
well, from experience, hoW fruitless it is to expect her
to be anything ~but depressed and rnise~abh~. But she
is s6
gentle and uncomplaining, that I often feel like
crying over her in very pity. And oh; Kate, she is such
an exquisite ci~eatuve!. J.~ is no exaggeration to call
her perfectly beautiful. I used~to . think your eyes

fectly apathetic; occasionally, almost W~d with 'grief.
Wisely and gently, as one' -a&amp;custonied 4o miiP~er-

the task of corre&amp;ing the evil. He wrought as mudi
'by example 'and the unsVudied teachings that fell
from his lips as by direct precept and admonition. 11i~

A GLIMPSE BENEATH THE SURFACE. 2
It was with no little difficulty that Ximena was
pi evaikd upon, by the united arguments and. entree~ 2
ties of her friends, to forego her intenti6n of returning
to Mexico immediately on her recovery. Mr. Clerville
represented the, extreme probability~the positive
certainty, he: considered it-that General Walworth
had been prevented from receiving the letters ad-
dressed to him by absence from home. lIt 2was the
season when most Southerners forsake their too sunny
hoi5nes for a mountain or r northern climate. He re-~
minded her2 that her mother had committedd her to
Edward' ~ care, to be delivered to the guardianship of
her uncle---of the anxiety which she had mmifes2~ed.

with ~ffectionate reproach,. how Ximena could think
of leaving her, when she knew she loved her so much?
and the doctor, when appealed to on the subject by

and the existeilce of vomito at V~ra Cruz, all forbade
the idea, he said. Instead of this longjourney, he
should recommeDd daily short ones 2 on horseback,
both 'for Miss Yarassa and Miss Blanche.
Blanche had always been in the habit of riding a
f~reat deal, but siwce the death of her mother she had
entirely djscontiriu this favorite exercise. It was
associated in her ~ind with all pleasant memories
and exhilerating e~notion, and seen~ed inappropriate
to her present depressed state2' of spirits. Once or

the latter to consent likewise.

in a marvellous manner.
It' was fortunate that 14s slight' prevarication, of
speaking of I~r present and former self as two differ-

wards bitterlyy reproached himself, it being ~th~ first

now entertained for him was totally unalloyed by

both of them' for their obstinate blindness to this t~wt.
Tl~QiIgh to set out delib~erate1y.with the intention ol
'making a ma'tcb' would have been a shocI~iug. i4ea

His own manner vaswarmer than it had ever been
to her, as he drew her into the sitting-room, Which

'Are you really so very glad to see m&amp;?' she cried,,

me if I could 'not repress a slight seu~e of disappoint-

She looked distressed. 'Dear Frank;' she said ~tf.

he should wait until the' season was. more adv~nc~d.
Blanche was n~t disappointed in h~r expectation
that K~te and Xixnena :would be p~rfeetly fascinated
with each other.. Li~cy,~too, was delighted with the

by saying how very busy he~ was with some final
work he was having done; but Kate thought he might
have deferred it'until after they were gone.
The night before they were to' sLart home, Lucy,
