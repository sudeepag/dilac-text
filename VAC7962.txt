Imagination may be legitimately: allowed to exercise ite strongest powers when bounded by the great outlihes of Ah, ndbe sacred writers themselves indulged in such a Scense, ad so long Salhe imagination does not transcend the bounds of probability no valid objection can be urged against its exercise.   / Talfourd says of the effects of an imaginative literature, "The world is not in danger of becoming too romantic. The X golden thread of plsy are not too thickly or too closely interwoven with the web of existence. Sympathy is the first, great lesson which man should leam.

If -i rard to mere works of fiction where the realW4/Ieft  :itd t/  of excellence are created for the purpose of exciting / kin to loftier standards in the attainment of higher ex- cellencies, why should imagination be shut out of the realm of fact itself?

Ua, or UaO, "the city of light orefire," for such was the meaning thereof in the Chaldean tongue, was situ te.. a valley on the :bank of the river Tigris. - :  ey extended from the river to wUia is now den  ated the- Tiy% mountains, a chai of which extending north and south formed the ancient boundary botween Persia ou 4henortfh aMd east and Chaldea on the west. The country around Ur, extending from its north- ern limits dowa to the city of Nineveh, a distane  of many miles, was B:i:ieent beyond description. The vale of Ispabha Persia, with its varie. d beautiful sceneryf 'forest and plain and' rivets tres nd flowers and surrounding mountains, :its -days of cloudless skies and nights of starry beaut, could not vie with the valley of the Tigris. i spot particularly, which had been designated : the site of ancient Eden, was surpassingly beautiful. ohe' ow   10 ,'   THE ASTROLOGER .OF CHALDEA. In the center of this Eden was spread out a lake whose mirror-like surface zeflected the graceful oriental trees which grew upon its banks, and the gr0ous flowers which lined its margin.  Here ' natie ]iad ::scattered with profusion her choicest gifts. :jere were birds of brightest plumage and' sweetest song. Art could add nothing to its beauty. Indeed,/the clumsy hand of man would have de-, stroyed its loveliness and blighted its flowers. It ,stood near the base of:,the mountain, about equi- distant from Nineveh and Ur, the former of which was the residence of the great king of Assyria, whose palace was as rich and magnificent as the country of which the city of Ninev. :was the me- tropqlis. This palace was situated in;an open plaza -i the center of the city,which was built on an area sixty miles in circumference, and surrounded by a wall one hundred feet high, and, so:-thick that three chariots could be driven abreast on its summit. On this, wall were stationed, at proper distances, fifteen hundred towers, each of which was two hundred feet high. The- city was a. ng, extending along th  aks of the Tigris and :lck to the mountains. [na  days of its greatest prosperity,it contained ibout two hundred thousand soks. Besides the )alace of the king, there were others of great extent nadmagnificence, surrounded by parks and pleasure lardeds. The city of Ur was locatfd in a rural district, and   TIrE FESTIVAL AT 'EDN. D" though not on a scale of equal magnificence with Nineveh, yet possessed some palaces and monuments of art which rendered it attractive. It contained a magnificent temple, the ruins of which have .w, after the lapse of nearly four thousand- years, 'een discovered by an oriental traveler. This tetple was erected to the Sun, and here the priests of Chaldea a assembled to worship the emblem of the Great Spirit. On its lofty summit the holy fire was kept perpetu-  ally burning, streaming afua over the valley and the " plains of Mesopotamia ; and the traveler at night on the mountains of the east, or the far reaching plains on the west, could discern the representation or em- blem of ti- object of their worship. Near its base, in the garden surrounded by an enclosure, was the mystic tree and the holy fountain, with its sacred cup, from which the king and priests drank in honor to the Sun. - This fountain was said to confer im- moitality, and all who were permitted to enter the enclosure and partake of its waters, were considered as consecrated to the Sun. The inhabitants '" mostly engaged in tilling the soil or occupied Ii the peaceful pursuits? a pastoral life, with h* exception of the priestsand those who were devoted to the study of Astrology.... It was here that attention was, first paid to the study of the stars, and from this poipft what knowledge the ancients had of Astronomy was spread throughout Babylonia and Persia, and the countries-of the east, \ln: P   12 -  THE?AROLOGR0  OF CIAALPEA To the beautiful retreat in the valley, of wrhio. we have already spoken, tht citizens of Nineveh and Ur would frequently resort on festive oco0a4ibn8. Thpride and beauty of Nineveh would often gather there, and -there youth and pleasure would meet to join iwAthe sacred dance, and Eden on such'occa- ions, -ould resound with the wild tumultuous joy of the gathered throng. On the road winding down from the summits of the Tiyari, or along the path across the plain, might -eeeen the young men and maidens with joyous hearts and bright anticipations, urging tleir way to the pleasure bowers, On one of these occasions a youth from Ur, tall and graceful, with majestic mien andd thoughtful ountenunce, entered the gay throng, Hejresided  ':with his father, a renowned. prie' f the Sun, and  devoted his time to the service of tihe temple and the study of the stars. Often, while statnding out upon the observatory by night, has Ihegazed up intt the clear deep vault above him, and, as his large black piercing eye would take ints field of vision the orbs of light that glittered in -the outspread oark y, his spirit would whiper to him , and are th"thy gods?" Once, while lost in thoughtful reveries in regard to the Sabien worship and its gods, he, ws more than usually sad at Mi- dreadful uneertainty which rested upon his ::ind in regard t hi*, nature 4and4 destiny. Whenal, .camew ! --What was h!  ", " ' ,    EtBE PSTIVAL An AT lDIM     18 whither was he going-? What would beebme of him? were thoughts which came with overwhelitnig weight upon his mind  He had been among the favored few who had sat beneath the mystic tree; he had partaken ofthe holy cup, and was ranked among immortal; but alas! the draught satisfied not the longingof hi g spirit. There was within an achifig void which sun  nor moon nor stars nor hol flame nor sacred fount could fill.; It was the yearning of the soul after an immortality which the worship of fire and light could never impart. These were fit and appropriate emblems of the Great Spirit who fills all space, and pervades immensity with his presence, but they were only emblems, inanimate emblems of Him,- Whose spirit wraps the dusky mountain ; Whose spirit hovers o'er the fountain: S- While every rill and mighty river Flows mingling with his praise forever." Aa such, they were inadequate to pour light and comfort into his soul. ; .In this state of mind he had resolved that he would attend the approaching festival at Eden.  How often does the unrest and disquiet of the soul prompt its possessor to go in quest, alas often, - too vainly, of that which it bannot find at home. There is a desblateness whibh' attends the weary spirit in its wanderings over the trackless wasteo like the dove of Noah in quest of a kindred bower   "    lHE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. in which to nestle, that only those realize who have been conscious of the wilderness around them, though in the midst of crowding, pressing, gain, and-pleasure-seeking thousands.  On the evening previous to his departure, he had been outto his grotto for the purpose of engaging in h isevening meditations and worship. It was a night of Sernal beauty. The full-orbed moon rose bright over the Tiyari mountains, and sheds her soft and silvery light on the temple of black granite, and seemed even to mellow the glare of the holy fire on its summit. The noise and bustle of Ur was left behind, as Abram "the elevated," for such was the meaning of his name in the Aramean tongue, entered his grotto. Taking his seat, he turned to the east, and fiing his eyes upon the god of light, he ex- claimed, "Divine Creator, the manifest 'Deity and Savior, let thy beams illumine my soul and guide thou me by thisacred influences." Then turning to the west, he beheld the evening star hanging just over the horizon. "Behold," saidrhe to himself, " the God and Lord of my des- tiny.. Brightest and best of all the stars of pight, guide thou my steps, nor let my feet wander in dark- ness." As he gazed and adored the God of his destiny, and was wrapt in intentsp thought, behold! alas! the star of his worship and fate sank below the line separating earth and sky, and was lost to his vision.   THE FESTIVAL AT EDEN.     16 "Ah," said he, "it is ever thus with my bright- est visiots and fondest hopes. Just when I seem to grasp and feel their power to bless and save, like the mirage in the desert, they are gone; like the me.- teor's flash they disappear, and leave my soul in darkness." Turning in the direction of the temple he said  "Yonder burns the only light that does not exipr. e The moon and stars all have their time of departure,  and leave the world to darkness and myself; but thou dost burn on, holy light. O, that thou wast not of man's kindling. Even the sun, the great god of fire, only has its day, as moon and stars have their night, but day and night thy vestal fires as- cend, and burn on forever. Can it be," said the youthful devotee, "that these are my creator; that the mountain and river and valle'y, and trees and beasts and birds and reptiles are the-work of their hands? If so, why do they not impart happiness to their worshippers, and why does death come to man?  King and priest and worshipper alike have gone down to the chambers of the dead. They re- turn no more to greet us with their smiles, and cheer us with their presence. O, my friends! where are they?" he exclaimed with the deepest emotion. In an agony of grief he sank to te earth, and his sad and desolate heart poured forth its sorrows. He thought of his former companions and the one most   16    THB ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. dear to his heart, whose presence always cheered Ai&--the light of whose calm blue eye filled him with such wild delight, as she would gaze upon him  when they met; and whose, mysterious disappear- ance from her native bower, was more like a terrible dream than a dread reality. Ah, where was she? JiJol of his heart. "Alas, that neither beauty I  ^ofdaess, nor intense devotion to the gods, could save from the relentless power of death." While his mind was thus tossed as upon a sea of tumultuous passions, the night passed away. The god of light had hid himself behind the western mountains, and- the god of fire was rising over the Tiyari as he entered the gate of Ur to make prepa- rations for his departure. At an early hour the city was astir, and the aged and the young were busily engaged in getting ready for the journey to Eden. A deputation of priests was sent from the temple of Ur to conduct the sa- cred ceremonies, as the nobility of Nineveh with their horses and chariots, together -with a large multitude, were expected to be present on the occa- Eden smiled in all its vernal bloom. The sacred bowers never looked lovelier, while the whole atmos- phere was redolent with fragrance, as the pilgrims from Ur entered the spacious arbors and reclined in the refreshing shade. The embowered lake was calm and not a ripple was seen upon its surface, ex-   THE FESTIVAL AT EDENS     17 cept occasionally, as'a swan of Snowy whiteners would glide among the water lilies. Presently the blast of a trumpet is heard echoing through the bowers, and the assembled group start to their feet, for they know it is the herald's signal of the royal approach to Eden. Guards ate stationed at the entrance of the royal bowers, and as there wasf'  no need of strewing flowers, for nature had already scattered them in thick profusion along his path, the king and hiAtorl escort were greeted by the "all hail," of the Multitude. The royal -quipage exceeded any thing that had ever before been beheld. The king was dressed in the most gorgeous apparal. A purple robe, elabo- rately ornamented and richly embroidered with gold and precious stones, enveloped his person. A massy crown of gold, decorated with gems, encircled his brow, and in his hand he held the royal scepter. The chariot in which he rode, was made of the richest wood from the far off mountains of Lebanon, inlaid with ivory and gold. The horses were richly caparisoned and were led by eunuchs whose ebo s color indicated the country of their nativity. Two of these were on either side of the royal persoft, holding sacred fans as sun-screens. Then followed in the procession the princes and nobility of Nineveh, all arrayed ii/a style suited to the occasion. It was the arnual grand festival of the Sun, and all having arrived, even t&* dwellers from Tiyari, /   18    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. and the magi from the vale of Ispahan, the priests engaged in making preparations for the morning orison, by the erection of an altar, the consecration v of the sacred tree, and the formation of the mystic circle.- The youg astrologer had never been here before. J-Ie had frequently witnessed similar ceremonies ill the temple at Ur, but not with the same attendant pompous circumstances; and anxious as he was to find the true light, or somethingi t ld satisfy the longings of his soul, and solve the 8ts which gathered in darkening folds around X!: in regard to his destiny, he took a lively and all-absorbing into- rest in the preparations that were going on. When night came, :he returned to the edge of the bower, where, unobstructed by the trees, he;could gaze upon the moon and stars, .and -sigh out his spirit in prayers to those emblems of the gods of his fathers. The first gray streaks of morning were tinging the tops of the adjacenA-mountain, as he rose from his tent and sallied fo:*o look upon the scene around tf:'. All was quiet. The large pavilion of Nine- hb proud king and princes occupied the center F.:f the encampment; while ranged around at regular intervals were the tents of the multitude. The tent of the priest# was',pitched within the mystic circle, which also enclosed the altar and the sacred tree. While he wandered and gazed up6n these scenes, /  morningadvanced, and 'e watchers from the moun-   THE FESTIVAL AT. EDEN.     19  tain announced by the blast of their trumpet the rising of the god of fits in the distant east. The sleepers were awakened, and soon all .was life and activity in the Encampment of Eden. The tents were struck, folded and borne away, and the song of the priests summoned all to the circle. A mes- senger dove was perched upon the sacred tree, that " so soon as the beams of- the sun should strike its top, it mighi :fl to the altar, and thus give to the priests      the approach of their god. All ey r:e!e fastened/upon the dove, which could be see from the outer edge of the circle, nestled on the topmost branch. Another blast from tie trumpet, and all voices were hushed as if by the stillness of death. Soon the dove was seen to spread its wings for flight; its eyes had caught the rays of the sun, and gently descending to the altar, the torch lighted at the holy fire on the temple of the Sun in Ur,- was applied to the victim, and instantly the priests fell on their faces,:and the multitude bowed ins adoration, while alli voked the blessings of their god, as the smoke and flame of the sacrili ascended upwards from the altar. Again and again the priests-prostrated themselves, exclaiming, "Great is the Sun, the source of light and life to all mankind," to which all the people responded "( Selah/" Not all, for there was one who stood ia that group transfixed. He did not speak. He did not bow his 't.1      "   20    THE -ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. knee. His eyes were fastened on some object only visible to him in the distant heavens. He was mo- tionless as a statue, and had"it not been for the kind- ling fire of his dark lustrous eye, and the smi'b of inimitable sweetness which overspread like a glory his countenance, all would have supposed him dead. The young astrologer, for he it was who was thus exciting the attention and wonder of the multitude, could not be diverted fro /his gaze. Some thought he was smitten by the Sun, and tat to: god of fire had marked him for his own. T6 all- entreaties he was deaf.  There he stood, fixed" ald motionless, gazing up into the clear deep blue of that Asqyrian sky. At this juncture a young princess from the court of Nineveh, o4 slender form, richly attired, holding in her hand an alabaster vase of the most costly perfume, glided softly up to the stranger as if fearful of awakening him, yet with that intent she gently touched him, and placing the vase to his nostrils, she hoped to awaken him to consciousness, Find- tg this would 'ft do, she commenced singing-ing- "Wake, brother, wake, the day has come, The god of fire has left his home; Walse, for the morning sacrifice Will glad thy heart and cheer thine eyes." Thq charm was broken, the spell was dissolved, and the averted head gradually and gently turned until the eyes of the astrologer met the gaze of the , ,   THE FESTIVAL AT EDEN.      2  young and beautiful princess who had taken so much interest in his fate.. In that gaze there was a recog- nition, and then a long embrace : the loved and lost wafound. Sarai, the princess, for thus meaneth her name in the language of Chaldea, the betrothed of Abrarp, had mysteriously disappeared from Ur, and she had been mourned ag dead. For her rate beauty she had been abducted, and taken to the palace of the king to be fced among the maids of honor in the court of Nineveh. To her he had a right,-if you please, a pre- emption right, which no king or potentate could set aside. Next, to her God who claimed her as her creator, he claimed her as having the earliest and choicest affections of her heart. Love had united' them, and the Great Spirit had sealed the bond which made them one forever. The stranger, or rather the young astrologer and the princess, soon separated, the latter returning to her company, and the former to his gaze, but not with that intense fixedness which had before charac- terized it. Enoughhad passed between them, how- ever, in the short space in which they were together, to make all arrangements necessary'for a re-union. But what fixed the gaze of the young astrologer? What potent spell bound him to that spot so com- pletely absorbing his spirit, and kindling such rap- tures in his heart? Had he found the objest of his -.   22   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. anxious search-the satisfying portion of his soul; and was it an apprehension that he should lose Che long sought prize, that prompted him to turn again to his gaze in the heavens as quickly as the nale turns to its pole, when the disturbing influences of the magnet are withdrawn? Yes, that object for which his spirit longed and, which he had sought by night and by day, on mountain and in vale, in temple and grotto, had at last been found, and all the chambers of his soul were filled with unutterable joy aId rapturous delight. It was not the god of fire that had riveted his attention. Far up in that cloudless sky, there shone a light and glory above the brightness of the sun. So intense was the splendor, that to the young as- trologer th sun himself grew dim. It was a reve- lation of the Great Spirit, the Divine Shekinah,-a manifestation of the God oqf Heaven, the Creator of sun, moon and stars, whose power dissolves the bands of Orion, gives to the influences of the Plei- ades their charm, and guides Arcturus  ith his satellites. That glory was a divine afflatus to his soul, and as he gazed,' deep upon the tablet of his heart: was stamped indelibly the image of the In- visible One "Whose throne is darkness in the abyss Of uncreated light." The Chaldeans, Babylonians, and Persians were   THE FESTIVAL AT EDEN.     :3 worshippers of the sun, moon, and stars. Their religion was a system of astrology, by which they claimed to know with the greatest exactness, by means of the aspect and combination of the stars and planets, what would be the genius, temper, manners, events of life, and destiny of all whose birth was noted. The expanse of the firmament, according to this systenr, was divided into twelve equal parts, denominated the signs of the zodiao. These twelve equal parts possessed attributes pecu- liar to themselves, such as wealth, honor, and dis- tinction. The planets were divided into the propi- tious, the malignant, and the mixed, and those who were born under these stars were born to a destiny partaking of the nature of the stars which presided over their birth. In the sacred writers we find allusions in reference to -he influence of the stars, which would lead one to infer that the astrology of the Chaldeans was a prevailing sentiment among all the oriental nations, and to some extent at least, gave a tinge to the thoughts of the patriarchs and prophets of olden time. In the Old Testament, the patriarch and prime minister of the courl of Egypt, Joseph, in pronouncing a blessing upon Jacob, pointed to the star of his destiny. The patriarch and prince of Uz referred to the influence of Orion and Pleiades, and urged upon his counsellors to wOiship the god 'of "the Seven Stars and Orion." The proud mon- i,'   SG4    THE &STROLOGIR OF CRAT,LPA., Woh of Israel, though not a worshipper of the stars, yet paid a most profound attention to their study, ' and through the works of God, bowed in humble *d4ration before the throne of their Creator In ferring to the proteotion and defense of the ser- vants of God, he declared that the "sun should not wsit then by day nor the moon by night;" and one of Zion's sweetest minstrels ,sang of the sure pro- te4tion of those who worshipped the God of heaven, in strains like the following: . "No damp shall blast thy couch by night, no star Dart its malignant fires so far." The descendants and successors of the magi thou- ands of -years afterwards, while engaged in their atrological labors in predicting the fate of kings and nations by the position and motion of the -stars, were startled in their nightly contemplations by the strange and sudden appearance of a new star which crossed the field of their vision. As they gazed upon its clear bright disc, and felt the soft myste- rious influence of its rays, their minds werem filled with wonder and delight. It wa0 the re-ap rance of a light which -had come to the Jewish iw-giver on Horeb and Sinai, ad4 which subsequently filled the Tabernacle in tho wilderness and the Temple at Jerusalem with a glory never seen by mortal eye since the cherub stood with flaming sword to guard the gates af ancient Eden. The magi looked upon the celestial. visitant as a harbinger of good, for A+,   i*tHJ FESTIVAL AT D. 2N.5 i, there was nothing malignant in its aspect. In 'searching the ancient predictions they found it to answer to the Shiloh of prophecy, whose coming had long been looked for, and formed a part of the traditions of the East. Sacred history informs us that the magi followed this star, and it led, them to the very spot where the king of the Jews was born. It was, in the language of Astrology, the star of his destiny. The Persians adored th6 Sun, and through their priests and magi, kept up a perpetual worship by means of a perpetual fire which they kept burning on their altars in temples dedicated to that orb. When the god of day first gilded the east with his rising beams, as the eye caught them, the profound- est veneration was paid to him as the source of all their blessings. To him they dedicated a magnifi- cent chariot, with horses of the greatest beauty and value. The same ceremony was performed by the Chaldeans and Babylonians, and we learn from the Sacred Record that some of the kings of Judah in- troduced the ceremiony into the very precincts of the Temple of Jehovah; and the rites were kept up until Josiah ascended the throne. The Scriptrs inform us that Josiah "took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the Sun, at the entering in of the house of the Lord by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burnt the chariots of the Sun with  .        . *I *   26    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. fire. And the altars that were 6n the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king beat down and break them down from thence, and cast them into the brook Kedron." Sometimes they sacrificed oxen to this god, who was very much known amongst them by the name of Mithra. They also paid a particular veneration to fire, the emblem of their god, invoking it first in their sacrifices, and carrying it before their kings in all their marches, intrusting the keeping of the sacred emblem which came. down from heaven to their priests or magi, who would have regarded it as the greatest disaster which could befall them if they suffered it to expire. History informs us that the emperor Heraclius, when at war with the Persians, demolished several of their temples, and extinguished the sacred fire which had been preserved until that time, which-caused great lamentation and mourning throughout the entire nation. The magi or priests were the guardians of all the ceremonies relating to the fire wqriship, and it was to them the people looked fox instruction therein, and, from them they derived a knowledge of the particular days for the worship of their gods, as well as the particular manner of sacrifice to be offered to them. As the magi were all of one tribe, and as none but the son of a priest could aspire to the honor of the priesthood, they kept all their mys- A:    THE FESTIVAL AT EDEN.     27 tic learning, whether in religious or political matters, to themselves and their families. The great festival now being celebrated, was, as we have already seen, the annual festival of the Sun. It had commenced, and the god of the east had risen and blessed with his beams the opening sacrifice. But a more important and imposing sacrifice re- mained yet to be performed. The sun was mounting up the sky and was gradually approaching the zenith in his fiery car. Preparations were made for the great sacrifice. In another part of the grove and joining the mountain ridge, was constructed of stone a huge altar, on the near side of which was an in- clined plane sufficiently wide for three horses to pass abreast upon it. Oih either side of the way and around the summit, were placed a great quantity of dry wood, rendered highly inflammable by having been immersed in bitumen. Tle horses devoted to the sacrifice were those brought by the king of Nin- eveh. They were more richly attired than ever, and garlanded with flowers they were led forth by the magi and harnessed to a chariot of cedar the most elaborately carved, and inlaid with gold, silver, and precious stones. While these preparations Were going on, interesting as was the scene, there was another subject which absorbed the thoughts of the assembled thousands, and that was the appearance of the chosen one of the Sun who should guide the horses and chariot of fire. In secret conclave the 4   28    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. magi had made the selection from among the young priests, and Abram was the chosen one. The hour arrived. Every eye was turned in the directidt of the mystic circle, and soon -was seen issuing therefrom a solemn procession, headed by the priests, who heralded the way for the approach of the young astrologer. He was ,clad in scarlet, with;a crown upon his head, on the golden bands of which were represented the transit of a star over the blazing disc of the sun. Calm and thoughtful, but with firm and steady step, he ascended the chariot and took the reins of the fiery steeds who were prancing to be gone. The faggots were kindled on the altar, and the smoke and flames rose up the sided of the mountain. Hemmed in-by the living ram- parts on either side, the horses dashed furiously up the ascent of the burning altar, and soon were lost to sight amid the flames which fiercely flashed around. The horses passed through the fire, but ere they reached the summit of the mountain they fell blackened with death. Abram alone passed un- scathed amid the flames, and when the multitude beheld him returning in triumph from the fiery or- deal, they looked upon him as the child of the Sun, and there went up the shout of thousands in honor of his name. ,   CHAPTER II. ROYAL FESTIVAL AT NINEVEH. THE sacred festival at Eden was ended, the king and his nobles with the multitude had returned to Nineveh. The fire worshippers from theymountain, the astrologers from Persia, and the priests from Ur, had left the mystic circle, the sacred altar, and the consecrated bower, and had returned to their res- pective homes, more than ever impressed with 'a sense of the greatness and glory of their fire-god.' As the young astrologer journeyed thoughtfully along, one of the high priests of the temple ac- costed him. "( Abram, my son, didst thou find peace and hap- piness in the sacred bower?"' "No, father," rejoined Abram, "not in the sacred bower, nor from the sacred tree nor holy altar, nor yet from the bright face of the god of fire,"  '"Whence then the radiance of thy countenance, which shone with such brightness on the. festal day, and which even now is overspread with sunlight joy?" ( , holy father, I saw a form you could not see, o whose glory outshone the sun, and in whose radiance the moon and stars would fHade away into the dark- ,\ o 29   I:E ASTROLOGER OF HALDEA. ness of midnight. It was a manifestation of the Great Spirit, by whom the sun and moon and stars were made, the great first cause, himself causeless because unbegotten, the God over all and blessed forever." f' Did he speak to thee, my son?" "Not in words of man's speaking,. holy father. I heard noa voice ; but from that radiant glory there came a,,  terious spirit language which my soul understood. 0! the rapture of that hour. My soul was filled with most ecstatic bliss, and I knew it was the Great Unknown who appeared to me." "Ah, my son, I fear it was an optical illusion ppduced on thy fevered imagination, a mere hallu- cination of thy mind, caused by the fire god, who loves to bewilder the senses of his devout worship- pers.  Thy deep thoughtfulness and seclusion for many days before the sacred festival, of which I have heard so much, has so wrought on thy nervous- ness as to exalt thy imagination beyond the range of Fober reflection." "Nay, father, I am fully persuaded of what I saw, and I know by direct inwarMionsciousness that God, the God of heaven, has appeared to me. The vision of the temple is realized, the star of my destiny has risen to go down no more forever. Joy, joy, forever! What for long years I sought, with a devotion you well know, holy father, in the adora- tion of the sun and thenoon, and the study of the   ROYAL EXSTIVAL AT NINEVEa.,     31   stars, has at last come to my possession. Call it a delusion if you may, but the happiness I sought at last I have found." "Will Abram forsake the gods of his fathers, whom all Assyria, Babylonia and Persia worship, to follow this strange light which has so bewildeied, his brain?  Will he turn away from the holy fire and dash the sacred cup from his lips?"      , " Nay, holy father, I but return to the'*jship of the one living and true God, which our fathers adored beyond the great flood, but whose glory was obscured and shut out from the sin-darkened vision of their descendants. This God they once knew, but not liking to retain his knowledge, their foolish imaginations became darkened and they turned aside to the worship of the creature instead of the Creator. The stars are but the stepping places up to his glorious throne, and the sun and moon but lamps to illumine the way."  "Thus saying, thou assumest a knowledge and authority beyond thy years. Go, my son, and learn from the records of the temple that it is not given to youth to s    thus condemningly of the religion of their country and kindred, but in all subjection to learn obedience to the powers that be, ordained of the sun, and observed by all the kings, priests, and astrologers of the realm." So saying, he left him, and they continued their journey.     32    THE ASTROLOG R OPF OHALDRA. The events of the last few days had filled the mind of the young astrologer with profound emotions, The wild and restless sea of thought had been calmed by a power above all the influences of the gods of Assyria ; even transcending-the secret rites of the priests in the temple of Ur, or the more mys- terious ceremonies of the magicians in the temple of Belus at Babylon. The great Creator had re- vealed lkiself, and his all-pervading presence had filled his mind with a peace tranquil as heaven and boundless as eternity. Though he no longer gazed upon the sun and moon and stars as his gods, yet they never seemed half so lovely in his sight. He looked upon these bright orbs, but as the creatures of Jehovah, and the reflections of his wisdom and power, forming a bright pathway vup to his glorious throne on high. He wastno longer left to spell out darkly in the works of nature his uncertain destiny, for revelation had given him a key by which all the mysteries in creation and providence were unlocked, and their most intricate and difficult problems were solved. He was not left to infer his immorality from the fact that he had entered the mystic circle and par- taken of the holy cup, but he felt the new eternal life welling up from the deep fountains of his un- sealed nature, and spreading rapture through all the chamners of his soul. Deeply versed as he was in the occult sciences, the study of which he pursued ,' .   ROYAL FESTIVAL AT NINITSVLi.   33 with passionate fondness, the change which -had B come upon him, and the deep and powerful emotion which it excited, was far more absorbing that the lore of magic or the sublime study of the stars. Before, he could only dimly trace the footprints of the great Unknown in the earth and the heavens; now he realized his presence and his power, and felt that he lived and moved in the great source of light and life, concerning whom "The sun itself was but his shade." Before, he looked through nature vainly hoping to find God ; now, he looked through God upon nature, and the sun and -moon and stars, and the earth, he saw to be the work of his hands. Under such a happy transformation he returned to his father's house at- Ur. It was not long until he made Terah, for that was his father's name, ac- quainted with the wonderful vision he had at Eden. It is said, " the heart knoweth its own bitterness, and strangers intermeddle not with its joy." His father, though a priest of the tepmple, did not know the disquietude and anxiety which brooded over the mind of his dti4ful and affectionate son. He had fiequently chided him for his unrest and the oter- zealous devotion which had recently characterized his nocturnal studies. He saw that the vigils which he kept were making fearful inroads upon his frame, all of which were read in the pale cheek and trem- bling hand, but he knew nothing of the anxious 3   *' - ' 'i 34   .." E ASTROLOs9  Qf OHALDEA. thoughts and gloomy fears that drank up his spirits. Deep in his own heart he hid his sorrows, whick, like *? worm in the bud of a beautiful flower, was working death to his expanding hopes.  Sorrow shuns the world's cold gaze and courts retirement, and as the-stricken deer seeks its native bower to bleed and die, so Abram had sought his grotto and spent whole nights in solitude and prayer. Now that the night of his darkness and sorrow was past and the day of his joy had come, filling him with brighter visions than ever came to him in his happiest dreams, he would make others partake of his joy. Into that father's anxious ear did he pour the ties of his full and joyous heart. Terah looked sad, for he feared that much study had derangedthe mind of his dearest Child. To avoid this dreaded result he had sent him away with the young priests and astroldgers to Eden, that amid the gay throng that would gather there, and the exciting scenes of .the sacred festival of the sun, his mind might recover its wonted tone, that thus restored he might be the same joyous youth he wias in other days. "Why does sadness cloud my father's brow? Such happiness to thy son should not make thee melancholy."  Ah, my son," said the anxious parent, "if it were real happiness I could rejoice with thee, but I fear With priest Benoni that thou art walking in the   ROYAL FESTIVAL r AT NINEVEH. . sparks of thine own kindling, and not rejoicing under the inspiration of what thou callest the Great Spirit. Others have been smitten by the sun and moon, and thy strange furor may have been occa- sioned in the same way. Were it so I would rejoice, for whom the gods of fire and light love, are often thus entranced." The father was evidently as much a stranger to the elevation of mind enjoyed by the son as he was of the source whence it emanated, and hence could not enter ino his feelings or partake of his joy. It was a new and strange development, and as there did not seem to be any abberration of mind in regard to :other subjects, but rather if any thing, an in-, creased clearness and.strength of intellect, connected with a quietude and peace to which the father knew he had been a stranger for some months past, the whole thing was invested with a mystery which the aged priest and magician was unable to solve. To the patriarch it was a new manifestation, a new religion, for ever since Cain was driven from the face of the Lord at the place of worship on the east of Eden, ?where stood the cherubim and the infolding fire, had he and all his descendants turned to the sun, and stretching out his hands, worshipped God in that bright orb. So, in the days of Enos and Seth and Tubal Cain, did they worship the. Great Spirit through the sun, and as the moon aitd stars were placed on high to be the regulators of the   36 THE ASTROI 9QER OF CHALPEA. universe, were they also worthy of being praised and glorified, and they built temples to the stairs, and looked up adoringly to the host of heaven. To the mind of Terah, however, there was one thought which seemed like a forgotten dream re-  vived by the singular experience of his son. He  had heard of a chosen few among his ancestors of  whom it was said they were taken into the secret  counels of the Great Spirit, and that they refused to worship the hosts of heaven. The names of  these illustrious patriarchs were Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem, and Eber, the former of whom had particularly special interviews with God, walking and talking with him face to face as man would hold converse with his fellow man, and who was finally carried away, soul and body, to the grand council of heaven.  Ancient tradition informed him, that years after the translation of Enoch, the patriarch Noah and his family were preserved in an ark from the great flood which destroyed the rest of mankind. He had also heard of Job, a priest and prince of great wealth and influence in Arabia, who, in answer to those that called in question his integrity, said "If I be- held the sun when it shinedor the moon walking in brightness, and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand, I should have denied the God that is above." He had heard also of a mysterious priest- who dwelt at Salem, in the    ROYAL FESTIVAL AT NINEVEH.     - . land of Canaan, who was also called a prince of  peace. While dwelling upon these reflections he became more than ever interested in the wonderful recital of his son, Can it be," said he to himself, "that God will appear and make himself known to mortals. Cab  the ineffable light and glory be so veiled as to be 3een by human eyes?  Surely none by searching 3an find out the Almighty; and if any are thus fa- vored, it must be by divine- manifestations." What was hidden from the father and the aged priests and astrologers, and was lost amid the cor- ruptions of Assyrian worship, was revealed and restored to the son. Being unable to convince his  father and the priests of the temple, of the reality )f the wonderful revelation, Abram sought his wonted retirement in the grotto, and held commu-  nion With the Father of his spirit.  A grand festival was to be held at Nineveh, in honor of her proud and mighty king. Weeks were  spent in making preparations, which were on the nost magnificent scale. To this brilliantfete, princes mnd nobles from Babylon, with priests and astrolo- gers from Ur, and the magi fromt Ispahan, were in-  vited. Expectation was raised to its highest pitch, and all anticipated the rarest enjoyment. The invitation extended to the astrologers ofUr would of course include the young-and gifted Abram, .n and he contemplated the visit with no ordinary de- r   6   ,  THE ASTROLOGEB OF CHALDEA. gree of pleasure, as it would afford him not only an opportunity to see the vast metropolis of Assyria, and furnish him an occasion for becoming acquainted with its astrologers, but the hope was strongly in- I dulged that perchance he might meet the idol of his ; heart, his beloved Sarai, to whom he had already  plighted his vows, and whom at Eden he had prom- i ised to visit whenever opportunity should present. The journey was to -be accomplished by water,  s and boats were prepared for that purpose. Every   thing being in readiness, and the time having arr ed, the party embarked, and the fleet being loosed from  its moorings at the quay, gently glided down the  Tigri s.  The scenery along the banks, always beautiful, presented at this season of the year a peculiarly attractive appearance. The valley on either side, spread out in gentle undulations, was covered with  plants and flowers of every hue. The grass and shrubs .which skirted the margin of the river down  to the water's edge, made the stream appear in its meanderings to flow through beds of living green. On the west, far over ,the, magnificent plains of Mesopotamia, the dim outlines of the huge tower of Belus, with its astronomical observatory, surmounted-  by the colossol silver statue of Jupiter Amnron, $ could be se6id as it were sculptured on the deep blue  of the sky. On the east rose the lofty summits of the Tiyari, covered with trees and herbage.    i A .VI   ROYAL FESTIVAL AT NINEVER.     * The- sight of the. observatory at Babylon ocea-  4 sioned a lengthy discussion among the astrologers and priests in regard to the recent discovery which had been made in the planetary world. The. chief astrologer of Babylon had discovered a new star, which possessed a form and shone with a dazrling brilliancy different from any -which had been found in the astrological annals. It -assumed ever and anon mysterious forms, now readiating an intense brightness, and then, as if unable to support-ite splendor, fading away until its light was. like that of another star. An account of it had been written out and sent to the king and the various astrologers in Babylonia and Chaldea, but as yet none were able to give it a name, or decypher its meaning. It seemed to have taken the place of the lost Ptial one of the holy seven. While engaged in these speculations the time passed quickly and pleasantly away, aidho boats neared the place of their destination. At length -on the eve of the grand festival, the walls and towers of Nineveh appeared in view. It was approaching the noon of night on the secokn day after their departure from Ur, as they neared the gates of the proud capital which opened from the east and west. The lights which streamed out from the fifteen hundred lofty towers an the walls, seemed to the approaching company like a vast Circle;  of burning stars hung around the city.   d&   tTHE ASTROLOGER OF CHATDPEA. Having followed the course of the stream to the western side of the city, the party left their boats and entered the outer gates which opened upon the bank of the river. Within, the city was illuminated. Multitudes could be seen strolling through the plea- sure gardens, while in many a palace as they passed on their way they witnessed brilliant illuminations, and heard the joyous shout of the gay revelers as they tripped to the notes of sackbut and harp, dul- cimer and viol. Every heart seemed wild with joy, at the arrival of the grand festival. As they approached the king's palace, rising from terrace to terrace, a scene of magnificence burst upon their view, grand beyond description. This stately edifice occupioU a large square in the center of the city. It stood on an elevated platform, and had two grand entrances, one on the east, looking out on the mountains, and the other on the west, overlooking ihe Tigris and the vast plain of Mesopo- tania. The immense gateway formed by a pair of human headed bulls, fourteen feet long, wearing a lofty head dress richly ornamented with rosettes a, edged with a fringe of feathers, opened, as we have already seen, to the west. The entrance form- ed by these colossal bulls was fifteen feet wide. It was paved with large slabs of limestone. To the right and left stretched away the walls and lofty towers of the city. Through this gateway a con- tinued stream of human life was passing. Behind '):,?: .   ROYAL FESTIVAL AT NINEVEH.    4e these colossal figures, and between the outl and inner face of the gateway, were two chambers seventy feet long and twenty-three feet wide.-- Beyond the first gate were two others, guarded by human headed bulls and winged lions. After as- cending several terraces, by means of flights of steps made of immense squared stones, flanked with but- tresses, on which at regular intervals were colossal human headed lions and bulls, the party reached the propylaeum at the foot of a wider and more magnifi- cent flight, composed of alabaster slabs elaborately sculptured with many a curious design. On a mon- olith;, at the base of this flight, were placed two immense lions Whose fierce aspect, as they stood revealed in the light of the-grand hall above, struck terror to the minds of those who were unaccustomed to gaze upon such grim colossal guards. The pro- pylaeum was covered witl square slabs of alabaster, pure and white, ornamented with the most rich and beautiful sculptures. At the grand entrance hall, which was arched and supported by immense pillars,  stood two enormous human headed sphinxes,i hile on either side in the wall were sculptured humpl headed winged lions and bulls; next to which were six human figures of gigantic proportions. Passing the grand portal they found themselves in an immense hall, hundreds of feet in, length and breadth, and rising up from columns to a great height, The roof? was flat, and that part of it im-   4!t   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALPBA. mediately over We center of the hall was conse- orated to-the priests, where they kept the holy fire burning day and night, and offered up their sacri- fices to the hosts of heaven. This place could be reached from the different entrances by a circular stairway. Around this hall were three others, on an equal scale of magnificence though not of the same immense size. Above and adjoining these were chambers spread out in every direction, amounting to seventy in number, the floors and walls of which were composed of alabaster, sculptured like those of the grand hall. The ceilings were finished with cedar from Lebanon, acacia wood from HorOeband Sinai, and fir from the Tiyari. Surrounding the whole immense pile were columns of white granite supporting -entablatures richly ornamented with every Assyrian device. Ina recess formed by columns stood the throne of the kingupon an elevated platform. This throne'  was supported by three rows of figures, one above the other. The wood was most richly and elabo- ratelyv carved and inlaid with gold and ivory. The gs of the throne ended in pine shaped ornaments. (Her the high back was thrown an embroidered robe of the most rare and beautiful material. The foot- stool was of the most elegant form, and encased with gold, the legs ending in lion's paws. On this throne was seated the proud moarch of Nineveh, and around him were thtoands of the A* t           ,    ROYAL FESTIVAL AT NINEVEH.    43 princes, priests and astrologers of Assyri  -On this night he was attired in a style of gorgeous magnificence. Long loose sacrificial robes of the richest purple, highly ornamented with crescents and stars of gems and gold, and edged with tassels and fringes, surrounded his person. On this occa- sion the king wore a conical shaped tiara or crown on his head, somewhat resembling the mitre of a high priest, ornamented with crescents and stars of gold and gems so arranged as to represent the con- stellations. Round his neck were hung the four sacred signs, the crescent, the star, the bident, and the horned cap. In front of the throne, on the ala- baster pavement, was sculptured a crescent in the midst of a many rayed star representing the sun and moon. TImmediately in the rear of this was a table containing many sacrificial objects, and adjoining was the holy altar on which burned the sacred flame. Around this in the rearstood the priests in semi- circular form, arrayed in sacerdotal vobes, while, around the whole was inscribed the mystic circle. * The midnight ceremonies of the grand festivl were being performed, and just as Abram and Is companions took their stations around the circle, the high priest from a burning censer lighted the sacred urn upon the altar, and elevating the consecrated cup, blessed it, and presenting it to the king, who drank of its saci contents, it was passed aroua. among those within and those without the circle. *t     ,    "   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. ThIyoung astrologer from Ur did not partake of that cup. He had pledged faith and obedience to another God, and he could no more partake of an idolatrous sacrament than he could worship the gods for whom it was instituted. He had entered into covenant with the God of heaven, and he could not recognize the gods of Assyria as the objects of his worship. There was one in that vast and brilliant assembly whose gaze was fixed-upon the young astrologer from the time he entered the hall. In an apartment dedi- cated to the queen and the noble ladies of her court, which was somewhat elevated above the narble floor and on a level with the throne, sat a young and lovely princess, whose sad and thoughtful counte- nance indicated the deep reverie of her soul. '"Can it be," thought she, ,I that Abram has re- nounced the religion of our fathers? If not, why does he refuse the sacramental cup? But he seems to be troubled. A shade of sadness is on his brow. Would that I  knew his thoughts. O that I could spe"to him." '^ While thus she-mused with eyes intently fixed on thbe subject of her thoughts, Abram cast a glance at the gallery, and as eybe nt eye in mutual recogni- tion, quick as the electric flash along the conducting medium, there was an intercommunion of soul. The mysterious affinity which bound their hearts together annibilated the distance between erm, and that lan-   ROYAL FESTIVAL AT MNEVEH.    45 - guage which is known and interpreted only by the spirit, at once became the medium of communication between those loving hearts.   d  The sacramental service being-ded, the king rose from his throne and presenting his scepter, every head was bowed to do him reverence, while a shout went up from that vast assembly which rever- berated through the lofty dome and was echoed from the surrounding chambers, " O king! live forever." Then laying aside his scepter and touching his lips gently in token of silence, every voice was hushed and deep earnest attention sat on every countenance. Addressing the listening throng, he said, "( O, princes and rulers, priests, astrologers, and magicians, my most worthy servants and safe-guards of Assyria, a new star has appeared, a new god has taken his throne in the heavens, outshining Orion and the Pleiades, and to the chief astrologer Aram, it seems even brighter than Venus, though far beyond its orbit. It doubtless heralds the approach and has-marked the birth of some distinguished prince, or it may be some rival king. If any one cgrtell me the sign of this star and what it meaneth- in as- trology, his desire shall bekgranted even to the richest province of my realm." It was a moment of intense interest, especially to every astrologer assembled there. The astrologers of Babylon, from the depths of whose astronomical well the star had-.been discovered, had searched all   :  46    THE ASTROLOQe R OF COHAtEA. the records in the temple of Belus, but, ags before remarked, unable to solve the mystery of the sirange appearance of the wonderful star, were dumb. The eastern magi, whose deep astrological researches caused them to vie with the astrologers of Assyria, and the astrologers of Nineveh who had searched the chambers of record and had unrolled all the annals of antiquity, were alike unable to give a satisfactory answer to the king. Abra m had been to Babylon, and from the well and observatory of the temple had gazed upon the mysterious orb. His intense devotion to the study of the science had secured for him a name and a fame as an astrologer which extended beyond the circle of astronomers attached to the observatory in his-native city, and no sooner had Aram discovered the celestial visitant than he sent for the youthful astrologer. He was therefore perfectly aware of the interest its appearance had excited among all classes, and from what he had learned, knew that it would claim the attention of the king and court of Nineveh at t festival. To him the star bore a greater re- semblance to the blazing fire on the summit of the temple of Ur, than to the soft luminous rays which radiated from the other stars in the heavens. As the result of his observations he came to the con- clusion that it was not a new star; but from its posi- tion, must be one belonging to the constellation in which it was discovered, and that it.%only assumed a    ROYAL FESTIVAL AT NINEVEH.    47  new appearance by mysteriously robing itself in garments of fire. The meaning of this he could only conjecture or explain by the hypothesis that it was a star of some proud monarch's destiny, and its conflagration and consequent final extinction indi- cated the fate of a king and-&his empire. There, before the king and astrologers, were the astronomical tables and legends of Babylon. The astronomical records of Persia were also introduced, embracing the researches made in India and China. Before the king were the ancient annals of Nineveh, but in none of them was to be found an answer or a clue to. the solution of the royal question. All acknowledged their inability to unravel the mystery connected with the strange and wonderful star. At this crisis Abram gently advanced, and bow- ing courteously to the king, said in a tremulous voice, " O king, live forever! To me it is given to answer thy question. The star is not a strange messenger heralding the birth of a king or the inva- sion of a rival, but a star of destiny, whose fiery glare is a sign of desolation and final ruin. It is the Mene, Mene, Tekel, of some doomed monarch and his empire." At this announcement the eyes of the king, which until now had been riveted on the prophet-astrologer, grew dim and glassy, his head fell upon his shoulder, his hands trembled, and a shudder passed over his  whole frame.   A .48  -THE ASTROLOGER OF CHAJDEA. After his emotion had somewhat subsided, he rose from his throne, and extending his scepter to Abram, exclaimed, O princes, rulers, astrologers, and magicians, I do now decree that Abram be constituted, by royal authority, the chief astrologer of my realm, inas- much as he hath a wiser spirit than ye all." Then said he to Abram,!"Ask, my son, what thou wilt andit shall be given to thee, even to the half of my kingdom. The gods have given thee wisdom above thy years, and thou shalt have whatsoever thou dost desire." Every eye was now turned upon the young astrol- oger of Ur, 4and as the Archimagus or Grand Master of Babylon advanced and delivered the jewels of his office to the king, who placed them with his own hands -upon the person of Abram, every one in that brilliant assemblage did him homage, while the as- trologers and magicians paid grand honors to their newly invested chief. When the ceremonies of in- stallation were ended, the prophet-astrologer turned wigh joyous and thankful heart, and approached the young and beautiful princess who stood -among the nobility of her sex a deeply interested spectator of the scene. She was, as we have already remarked, a blue i eyed maiden, of unusual beauty and- symmetry of form. Often did the young astrologers and priests of her native-city, Ur, gaze upon her as4 she would /          she would   ROYAL FESTIVAL AT NTNEVEH.    49 glide to and from her bower at eve beneath the sil- ver light of the moon, to worship the hosts of hea- ven; or at early morn, as with fixed and steady eye she would watch the rising of the god of fire as his beams would first kiss the distant mountains. She was now away from her loved home, but happy memories of other days ceased not to awaken the most pleasant associations. As a princess, she was arrayed in a style of magnificence suitd to her rank. A rich robe of crimson elaborately decorated with gems, hung gracefully over her well rounded shoulders. Dark glossy tresses fell in eurls on her inclined neck of snowy whiteness. On her head was a turban of the richest silk, in the center of which was a gold star radiated with diamonds. To the youthful astrologer she was a prize more valuable than all the wealth and power and glory of Assyria. Every eye was fixed upon the now young prince and princess, and as Abram took her by the hand and led her to the mystic circle, in front of the throne, every heart partook of the general joy. Presenting her to the king, he said with a voice tremulous with emotion, " O, king, I accept thy generous offer. I ask not to be the ruler of a realm : I ask not wealth nor power ; but I ask, as the betrothed of my heart, she who stands before you, my loved and long lost Sarai." "Thy desire is granted," said the king, and rising from his throne and joining their hands, he pro- 4   sO   THE ASTROLOGER OF OHALDEA. nounced them husband and wife, in the name of the sun. Then embracing and kissing them, he added, "On Abram and Sarai may the gods of Assyria Shed their mildest rays. May the stars of their des- 9tiny never grow dim or expire.' Though the kEig was evidently troubled, as the interpretation f Abram augured no good to his des- tiny and that of his empire, yet he orderemnusic and dan/lg. Flowers were strewn in thick profiti- sion by fair hands, on the tesselated floor in front of the happy pair as they walked arm in arm among the joyous throng to receive their greetings. The sa- cred dance, - for all the amusements of the Assy- rians partook of a religious character, -then began, and all partook of the general joy, which ceased not to reverberate through the halls of the palace until the rising of the god of fire ended the roval festival. ?          '    CHAPTER III. THE TEMPLE     AT BABYON. THE ancient city of Babylon was located on the plain of Shinar on the eastern and westernbanks of the Euphrates. It was laid out on a magnificent scale, the streets crossing each other at right angles, and the river running through the center. The city on each side of the river was enclosed by a high wall, fifteen miles in length, making the entire cir- cuit of the city about sixty miles of continuous wall. These walls were of the enormous thickness of eighty-seven feet, rising up to a height of three hundred feet. They were pierced at regular inter- vals by a hundred gates of solid brass, each one of which was guarded by towers erected on the walls surmounting the gates. The wide straight streets extended through the city on a line with the gates. These streets divided Babylon into seventy-six squares, each of which was two miles and a quarter in circumference. These square s constituted sepa- rate villas, many of which were used as parks or pleasure gardens, filled with trees and flowers. The king's palace was erected on both sides of the river, the sepaAe apartments of Which were connected by a bridge. One portion of the palace next to the   52    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. temple of Belus, was on the west side of the river. This was first erected, and denominated the old palace; the new was on the opposite side of the river, the enclosure and pleasure grounds of which covered a space of eight or ten miles. In after years, this enclosure, history informs us was deco- rated with hanging gardens supported by voluted pillars with elaborately carved capitals, rising from terrace tterrace, higher than the walls of the city.? The temple of Belus, at Babylon, was situated on the eastern bank of the river Euphrates. This tem- ple occupied a square a quarter of a mile in extent, in the center of which rose a tower six hundred feet in height. The tower was pyramidal, and divided at regular intervals into eight separate towers, rising successively one above another, decreasing in dimen- sions to the summit, where there was an oratory containing a couch, table, and other articles, all of pure gold. Here the principal- devotions were per- formed. Immediately over this, on the highest platform of all, was the astronomical observatory by means of which, and the jastronomical well ad- joining the tower at its base, and connected with it by an underground passage, the astrologers ar- : rived at such perfection in the science, that astro- r  nomical observations were kept dating back to within one hundred years of the flood. On the summit of the topmost tower were three golden statues representing the celesftilI deities,   THE TEMPLE AT BABYON.      53 Jupiter, Juno, and Rhea. These statues were all of colossal proportions, that of Jupiter being forty feet high. Juno was represented as seated on a golden throne, with lions at each knee, and two enormous serpents of silver. The statue of Rhea was on the left side of Jupiter. She was represented as grasp- ing a serpent in her right hand, and -a scepter en- riched with gems in her left. Accompanying these statues was a table of wrought gold, forty feet long and fifteen wide, on which were goblets ,and vases of the most massy and elaborate workmanship. The temple was filled with immense treasures, the wealth of kings and conquered countries, and little did Abram think as he entered with his beloved Sarai the palace allotted to the chief astrologer, that the time would come when his descendants would be captives in Babylon, and their most sacred treasures would be deposited in that very temple consecrated to idolatrous gods. He came not; however, to Babylon as a priest, but as an astrologer, and his relation to the king and court of Nineveh, of which Babylon was then a province, Nineveh being the metropolitan city of the Assyrian empire, was not such as to require of him either the acknowledgment or worship of the gods. ^ He came with .his young and beautiful princess to enter upon his duties as chief astrologer in the tem- ple of Belus, not as' a worshipper of the sun or moon, or stars, or Jupiter, Juno, or Rhea, but as a wor- ,.   54    THE 4STROLOGER OF CHALDEA. shipper of the God of heaven, of him who made the sun and moon and seven stars, and Orion and his wife had already embraced the same faith and wor- ship, and was illumined with the same holy light, and felt the same mysterious all-pervading power. We have not omitted the incidents connected with his return from Nineveh to Ur, and the intense excitement produced by his exaltation to the high post of honpr conferred upon him, among his kindred and the citizens of his native place, because there was nothing that would by interesting in the narra- tive, --far from it, but we have omitted their narra- tion as we must many other things possessing equally thrilling interest and importance, though not essential to our history. Scarcely had the astrologer taken. possession of his new home until another remarkable event oc- curred in the history of his life, destined in its results to have a more wonderful effect upon him that any other occurrence connected with his most eventful life. As the shadows of evening were gathering around the city, and the stars one by one were making their appearance in the sky, Abram and Sarai ascended the tower, and reaching the ora- tory, they prepared to engage in their evening devo- tions. They were far above the din and roar of the city, which stretched beyond the temple area on either side for miles up and down, on both sides of the river. The Euphrates reflected the light of the   THE TEMPLE AT BABION.     65 stars from its unruffled bosom, and the vast reser- voir beyond the walls seemed to the spectator likeda field of stars, so faithfully were the celestial orbs mirrored in its waters. On the summit of that lofty tower rose the mighty statue of Jupiter, glistening in the rays of the moon. "How beautiful!" said Sarai, as she leaned against the balcony and gazed upon the scene. "Most beautiful," replied Abram thoughtfully. "Yonder moon, walking majestically among the glittering orbs that deck the brow of night, fitly represents the milder glory of Him who is brighter and greater than the sun shining in his strength, or the moon walking in her brightness and beauty, and serves to lead the thoughts of man at evening hour up to his glorious throne. Let us bow and bless that God who hath formed all these bright creations as exhibitions of his eternal power." So saying, the happy pair prostrated themselves before the God of heaven. From those pious hearts, strongly united by sympathy, there rose a deep and ardent devotion, and a strong faith, lively gratitude, fervent love, and ardent hope, all-pervading and powerful, took possession of their souls. Thus absorbed, their spirits rose to high and glorious 'sympathy with the divine mind, and they held communion with the invisible One. The divine glory came over them, and there appeared the same manifestation that fell upon the vision of; Abram in   TH aSTRBOLOGER OF CHALDEA. ELden. While thus entranced, a voice, soft and low lfthe breath of summer, was heard saying, "Arise, this ids not your rest, and go to a land of which I with tell you," Abram was startled. It was the first time the divine voice had fallen upon his ear. But he was not alarmed. That voice fell upon an ear already attuned to the language of heaven. Those words came to a heart full of faith and obe- dience to God, and when they rose from the altar, a calm celestial resignation to the divine will might have beea seen upon their countenances, indicating the response of their hearts. The revelation was clear, so clear and definite that it left no doubt whatever on the mind of Abram that he was to leave his post of honor, his much loved pursuit, his palace, and more than all, his kindred and friends and native country, and all the associa- tions of his early life, a-nd start out upon a pilgrim- age to him unknown. But was he to wander alone as an exile from kindred and-country and friends? No, not alone, God said "I will go with thee and give thee rest." And Sarai too, for they twain were one, would ac- company him. No sooner did the faithful Abram respond to the voice of God than his young and beauteous wife, all radiant with smiles, embracing him, said, " whither thou goest I will go, even to the ends of the earth." After remaining a few days at Babylon, Abram   THE TEMPLE AT BABYpN.     57 returned to Ur, and communicated to his father and kinsmen the divine command. Terah had embrac6e  the religion of his son. Nahor and Haran had also become proselytes to the new faith. Terah was now two hundred years old, and was resignedlyawaiting his departure to the home of the blestjs the evening shades of life were gathering around him. No sooner, however, did he hear of the faith of his children and their divinely appointed destiny, than he resolved to accompany them. It was a heavenly mission, and he knew that it would have the divine protection. He had made the God of his children his own God. He had abandoned the star and fire worship of Chaldea for a purer, simpler faith. En- feebled with age. as he was, he did not hesitate to start upon the long and weary journey, and with staff in hand nerved by a new power, he started out w;th Abram and Sarai for the land of promise. Crossing the Tigris, and giving themselves up to divine direction, they traveled in a north-eastwardly course until they reached the mountain range. - Worn down with fatigue and toil, Terah was at length compelled to cease traveling, and after having reached a beautiful valley in Armenia they pitched their tents and called a halt until Providence should further open their way. They had traveled a dis- tance of three hundred and seventy-six miles, and were weary of the journey. In that little band there was a promising youth,   j8   THE PSTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. who, having embraced the same faith, had resolved do undertaking the same pilgrimage. He was a brother's son of Abram, and though much younger, was of kindred spirit, and devotedly attached to his uncle. ,For the sake of his religion he was willing to leave fath* eand mother and his youthful asso- ciates, and travtwith the chosen few to the land of promise. His name was Lot. In the place where they had stopped on account of the infirmities of Terah, Abram and his nephew commenced the erection of a village which was called by them Haran, in honor of Lot's father. It was a lovely spot. , Nature ,had here lavished her gifts, and 'with a profuse hand had scattered bless- ings all arbund. As the blessing-of God was upon Abram   and his companions, every enterprize in which they engaged prospered. The little band was increased by additions from their fellow coun- trymen, for they were still in Mesopotamia, and had not passed beyond the boundaries of their native land. They bestowed great attention to the culti- vation of the soil, which produced spontaneously the most odoriferous vines, and it was not many years until they had immense vineyards and vast herds and flocks of cattle and sheep which grazed on the rich pastures which nature had so bountifully provided. An event calculated to fill the mind with melan- choly, and which broke in fearfully upon the happi-   THE TEMPLE AT BABYON.     59 ness of the peaceful village of Haran, ,occurred. The aged patriarch, Terah, whose increasing'feebler ness caused Abram to stop in his unknown j(urney, an event which resulted in the foundation of a city and the accumulation of a large amount of pperty, was called to die. He was well striden in years. The toils of upwards of two centurie'Whad worn him down to the grave, and calling around him his be- loved Abram and Sarai, and pronouncing upon them his blessing, he gathered up his feet And departed in peace to his fathers. The hands of affection closed his eyes, and followed by those who loved him in life--and in death did -not forsake him, together with a large train of weeping villagers, the patriarch-of Haran was borne to the tomb.  It was a sad day to Abram and*Sarai and Lot, who with his newly married companion, deeply mourned his loss. The first grave opened in Haran, it was baptized with many tears, and often at even- tide would Abram and Sarai wander there to weep and pray over the tomb of buried affection. Once, while pouring out their hearts to God at that rural spot, the divine glory again overshadowed them as on the summit of Belus, and a voice came to them, saying, {"Get thee out of thy country, and from thy - kindred, and from thy father's house, into a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will   60    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. bless hem that bless thee, and curse him- that uirseth thee" and in thee- shall all the families of the eart be blessed." It was the same divine voice whose directions they had followed, and which had let them to Haran, and hence it tookthem no time to const in- regard to obeying the command. Preparations were immediately made for another unknown journey" and a few days, in which they gathered togetherg their flocks and herds and -trea- sures, witnessed' their departure, with Lot and his wife, and those who had renounced idolatry and embracea the true religion. Though they had laid tt:foulndations of a city, and in the course of fourteepn ears procured for themselves every thing , necessary tqW:ake home happy, and though last not least,Haran contained the sacred relics of their venerated father, they were ready to make any sacri- fices, leaving all the endearments of home, with their fruitful vineyards and smiling gardens, for the deep shadows of an untrodden wilderness. Their route lay towards Canaan, and after many days of weary travel over rugged mountains, through deetp*:and dangerous ravines and sandy deserts, they at length reach the borders of the promised land, and finally enter the beautiful vale of Shechem, spread out between the mountains of Ebal-.and Gerezim, whereiey encamped and erected an altar to the worship ot God. Nothing could be more lovely an this capacious valley, extending a .           ye   d   THE TEMPLE AT BABYlrON.     61 as it did for a long distance between the m/.taAains of Ebal and GWrezim, which rose on either sideto the height of pight hundred felt,s thickly covered with groves of olive and fig trees, while the rocks were festooned with vines and flowers of every hue, between which natural fountains threw out their sparkling waters, imparting a refreshing coolness to the scene. Nothing could be more inviting. Here the heaven-directed travelers, after having journeyq, four hundred miles, ended their pilgrimage and took up their abode. Again the Lord appeared unto Abran, ' While engaged in evening devotions, and the smoke .9 ti: sacrifice went curling lp from the altar" j ^Pife incense to heaven, the Shekinah agalW^fellped  * the worhippers, and the divine voice sait'"TUnto thy seed'will I give this land."  Abram was childless. Year after year had tome  and gone since he took his beloved Sarai to his bosom, but th6 boon for which both had sighed, and the withholding of which in those days was considered as a curse, came not to qadden their hearts and light their eyes. To writa man child- less in patriarchal times was but to complete the sum of his misery. It was to make him as a lone tree in a dreary desert, branchless, leafless, sapless. But this revelation inspil lhope, and the faithful Abram believed God, and Nejoised in the prospect of its fulfilment. It was a promise it;ivolving the   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. exi'  ai destiny of a nation, numerous as the stars of heaven. That same valley and those tow. ering mountains Mere to be covered and darkened by twelve tribel sand their twelve times twelve thousand that should spring from his loins, and every ear which should hear the commandments of his God.

"Such an idea would not only be preposterous, but " blasphemous in the extreme.

Though he was   ^ *     g   THE TEMPLE AT BABYON, 5.   69 aware of the fact that the whole land of Palestne was thus withering under a drought that had ex- hausted every green thing, and though he was con- scious of the fact that soon his Tesources would be exhausted by the constant drain upon them which his hospitality and benevolence opened for the des- titute in the surrounding country, yet he did not yield to despondency, or for a oment lose confi- dence in the ever acting providence of God.   CHAPTER IV. COURT OF EGYT. ABRAM'S knowledge of the country and climate of the East convinced him that the famine was general, and that no district dependent upon the rains for the productions of the soil, would afford supplies for his large and rapidly increasing family. To obtain these he must journey to another land. In a southwesterly direction, two hundred and forty miles distant, was the country of Ham, the fertility of whose soil was produced by the annual inundation of-a river which took its rise in the mountains of Ethiopia. This country-was bounded on the north by the Great Sea, on the east by the river El Arish on the borders of Palestine and the Syrian or Ara- bian desert, which extends from the sea to the gulf of Suez, and from thence southward by the western  coast of the Red Sea, and on the west by the Lybian desert. From the earliest ages its boundaries to the  south had been fixed by the cataracts of Syene, which are formed by a number of granite rocks that  stretch across the bed of the Nile, and over which t-at river rolled its foaming waters. The length of Egypt, from the mouth of its great river to the cata-  racts, the border of Nubia under the tropic of Can- 70 -    OOURT OF EGYT.       71 er, was about five hundred miles. The valley of the river was narrow, the distance from mount n ,o mountain being only about seven miles. The country of Egypt had attained a higher de- gree of civilization and refinement than even Assyria, the land of Abram. It was the seat of toyal govern- ment, and the arts and sciences were carried to a greater extent of perfection thai at Nineveh and Babylon. Besides, it was the granary of the world, possessing greater resources for the supply of its population than any other land. The peculiar fer- tilitybf its soil depending, as we have already stated, upon the inundation of the waters of the Nile: though no rain should fall on Egypt for a year, or a sucees- ' sion of years, yet the fields wo"ld yield their wonted supply. The various branches of the Nile have their rise in the mountains north of the equator, and flowing through Abyssinia and other regions westward of it, meet in th. country of Sennaar. The united stream flows then in : northwesterly direction through Nubia and Egypt, and after a course of nearly two thousand miles from the far- thest explored point, enters the Mediterranean by several mouths, which forms the Delta of Egypt. In a distance of one thousand three hundred miles i from the mouth of the Lacazze to the Delta, the Nile does not receive a single tributary stream, which in the language of one, forms a solitary in- stance in the hydrographic history of the globe. *,   72    ' TH1 ASTROLOGER O0 CHALDEA. Wte ancients assigned many reasons for the rise of tl waters of the Nile. To see the river rise and swell beyond its banks without a drop of rain, or any visible cause whatever, would necessarily excite many conjectures. They knew not that the vapors exhaled by the sun from the Mediterranean were carried to the mountains of Ethiopia, and there condensing, came 4dow in copious showers, swelling the river to such Ai extent that, first Ethiopia and then'Egypt, were overflowed, and the majestic river became a sea and spread abroad its blessings over the face of the surrounding country. There cannot be a more magnificent eight than that which Egypt presents at two seasons of the year. In the month4of July and August the whole valley is covered with water fr6m mountain to moun- tain. In the midst of this"sea numerous towns and villages appear, with several causeways leading from place to place, the whole interspersed with groves Of orange and liobn trees, whose tops only are visi- ble. This view is bounded by mountain ranges and woods, which terminate at the utmost distance the eye can idiscover, the most beautiful horizon that can' be imagined. In the months of January and February-the whole country is like one continued scene of beautiful meadows, whose verdure, enam- eled with flowers, charms the eye. The air is per- fumed withi the orange, lemon, and other blossoms, heighteiiing, if possible, the enchantment of the scene. 4   COURT OF XGYT-.      73 The Nile being the source of Egypt's prosperity, the inhabitants were lod to look upon it as the givi of all good, and hence they paid it divine honors. The priests of Egypt affirmed that Pheron, the son of Sesbstris, one of their kings, was struck blind by the river god, for an act of impiety. At a certain time when the river had risen to the extraordinary height of twenty-seven feet, a violent storm of wind arose which greatly agitated the waters, the king, i- with a foolish temerity, took a javelin in his hand and cast it into the midst of the foaming waters, and for this act was struck with blindness. The principal festival of this imaginary god was at the summer solstice, when the inundation com- menced; at which season by a cruel idolatrous rite, the Egyptians sacrificed red haired persons, princi- pally foreigners, to Typhon, or the power said to preside over tempests, at Busiris and Heliopolis, by burning them alive andscattering their ashes in the air..     '        ?  - Though of a more recent date than Nineveh avd Babylon, the cities of Egypt were 6f great magnifi- cence and splendor. The capital, which was called No Ammon, was situated on the banks of the Nile. It was the chief seat of the worship of Jupiter; and  such its name denotes in the Egyptian tongue, as the secret invisible creator among the Egyptins was called Anmmon, which signifies hidden. This was an appellation of the true God-- Why seekest Vf   74    -HE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret," or hiden?  This, also, accords with the inscription on one of Egypt's ancient temples, which reads, "I am all that hath been, and is, and will be, and my veil no mortal uncovered. My offspring is the sun." This city was venerated by the ancient Egyptians as the parent city, the seat of sacred mysteries and learning. It had an hundred gates, from each of which ten thousand warriors issued with horses and chariots. The area of the city embraced twenty- seven Roman miles. Its palaces and monuments of art were magnificent without a parallel. The palace of Karnack, which was on the eastern side of the city, the largest edifice in Egypt, was seven hundred feet long and one hundred and twenty-five feet in breadth. Two ranges of columns led to a portico of one hundred and thirty-six columns. The two middle ranges of these columns were eleven feet in diameter; the reminder were seven feet. The length of the Vstibule was three hundred and ninety feet, and the breadth one. hundred and twenty-five. The vestibule led into a court where there were four obelisks and twelve colossal figures. Two other courts conducted to the apartments of the kings of Egypt. Adjoining the palace were spread out on every side extensive apartments, connecting there- with by avenues of sphynxes, lions and rams, all of colossal magnitude. The avenue to the temple of the sun was guarded by enormous hnman and lion  ,    COURT OF EGYT.       75 headed monsters, sixty feet high and one hundred and twenty-five feet long. Here mysteries weit performed to which but few had access, and none were permitted to cross the threshold of that myste- rious place, without previously passing through the most solemn rites. Hitherward Abram and Sarai, with Lot and:yIisz" ; wife, and their children, together with their nume- rous attendants, were wending their way. They had crossed the Syrian and Arabian deserts and reached the shores of the Nile. Their destination was the city of the king, as it was from him Abram hoped to obtain assistance. Aware, as he was, of the idolatry and profligacy of the king and his court,  he resorted to an exceptionable expedient. What was to be done? Sarai his wife, though somewhat advanced in years, was still surpassingly beautiful, An increase of years had only given character to- her expression of feature. ; "If she go to the court of the kihntas my wife," said Abram, "I shall be destroyed, and she taken as a wife by the king; but if she go as my sister,- my life will not be sought on het account, and she may be saved.  So saying, and fearing lest her beauty should become, to- him and to her both, a snare, he finally said, "When Pharaoh shall ask thee who thou art? thou shalt say, 'I am his sis- ter.' " ( Not thy wife, my lord, - and sister too?" said Saari. "Nay, for if thou sayest aught but   *76    THE ASTROLOGER 0F CHALDEA.       that thou art my sister, they will slay me for thy sake. Besides, thou art my sister on my father's side." The day at length arrived for entering Egypt's proud capital, and Abram and Sarai, after entering the city, andl passing through the long colonnade, 1 sid at the ptal of the king's palace. He had already heard of Abram's fame as an astrologer in Chaldea, and no' sooner did he learn who were in waiting, than he granted them an immediate audi. ence. After learning the object of his visit, pro- vision was at once made .for his family, and he and Sarai were taken into the royal palace, where they were supplied with every luxury the fertile valley afforded. The exceeding beauty of Sarai attracted the at- tention of all the- lords and nobles of Pharaoh's court,- and her peculiarly fascinating and attractive mariners, added to-;rdignified yet amiable demeanor, won her a   ist'* of admirers on every hand.  For her sake Abram -was treated with marked respect, and-his attainments in Assyrian lore soon gained for him among the priests and astrologers of the Egyptian court, an elevated position-  Being the Archimagus of Babylon, and astrology having been introduced into Egypt from Chaldea, it was not to ~be wondered that Abram should meet with so much favor in the eyes of the learned.   The- Egyptians were, however, like his own   countrymen, idolaters,   and worshippers off he sun and moon, under the names of Osiris and Isis, With their worship, however, they had connected mysteries peculiar to the occult sciences, and to these ABram was -intro- duced, though at no time did he swerve from the true worship of God, and often did he enter into  ': lengthy arguments to prove the flly of wort  -+ ping the creatwe instead of The Creator.  A The king was specially delighted with his new guest, and loaded him with many costly presents, while at the same time he offered him a place among the princes and astrologers of the land. He had already taken his fair sister among the maids of honor, and she was undergoing  that process of training peculiar to Eastern courts, whereby she would in due time become a sultana of the royal house. The fears of Abram at last came upon him, but in a way he little suspected.  Alreadyr had Pharaoh claimed Sarai as his own.   biTo him it was a dark and dreadful day, .a period of awful sus- pense, and the mind of Sarai was tossed with tu- multuous feelings. They had involved themselves in a sad dilemma. With their own hands they had woven around their fate a web from which no human skill or power could extricate them. Sarai was at the mercy of a profligate court, andshe, trembled in view of her peril and approaching degradation. Under the circuastan ces Abram could    78    THE ASTROLOGERO OF CHALDEA.

Notwith- %si 8iIng all th*i they both resorted to prayer and earnestly besought dliverance from the dreadful evil which threatened their happiness. At length the day arrived which terminated the probation for her admissidn into'the harem of the king, asone of his wives. Her rank and beauty were such as to create quite an excitement in the court, among the princes and ladies. The event which would fix her doom, and forever, consign her to a life of hopeless miseryr was to be preceded by a grand festival, and every note of preparation was sounded. K thousand lights were streaming from incense burners, andjithe long colonnade of sphynxes and lions was lit up by their glare. The proud palace with irs lofty arches, rung with joyous voices, while strains of enchanting music filled the air. But whle every heart beat in unison to the general joy, those of Abram and Sarai were filled with   sadness. The fearful crisis at last came, and Sarai, gors  : geously dressed, as a victim for the slaughter, was  about to be led away ty' the voluptuous Pharaoh. Ik   THE COURT OF 84PT.      79 ,But hark! Among the assembled wine-excited throng a princess falls and a low sullep moan es- capes her lips. Then another and another is smit- ten, and where before there was naught but joyous shouts of mirth, now the palace is filled with la- mentation, mourning and woe. The angel of death  is there, and one after another of the royal he-* hold is struck down and borae away to the placi of graves. What means this sudden and Wfnl visitation? What has sent ah avenging hand to strike terror into the heart of the king? He seeks to solve the wful mystety which has snatched his chosen ones fam his side. In the midst of his terror the truth flashed upon his mind. "Can this be the wife of the ChaIdean?" Abram was instantly summoned to his presence. What is this that thou hast done unto me?" said the terror-smitten king. "Why didst thou nottell me she was thy wife? Why saidst thou, she is my sister?" At this searching and pointed reproof from royal lips, Abram felt keenly the enormity of his deception. Shame and self-mortification, for the first time in his life, became the inmates of his troubled mind, and he was dumb with silence. "Hast thou nothing to say? Wherefore didst  thou deceive me," he added, "seeing that so much ^ evil would come to my house on. account thereof. Now therefore, behold thy wife, she is asshe cam$e  from thy hand, take her and go thy way."   80    THE A$OPLOGER OF CHAT IEA. The agony of mind through whic'4 Sarai had passed was now relieved, the mountain pressure was taken from her heart, and falling into the arms of her beloved Abram she was clasped to his throb- bifig heart, again his own.] ;  The pestilence was stayed in the court of Pharaoh, ^^' arf:jttust as the light of the succeeding morning was breaking over the hills, and bathing with its golden beams the city of Thebes, or ancient No Ammon, a cavalcade was seen moving along the shores-of the Nile toward the land of Canaan. It was a mild summer morn. The air was redo- lent with -the perfume of many-tinted flowers, and vocal with the songs of bright-plumed birds, which filled the groves of oranges and lemons that lined the banks. Abram and his family, loaded with presents, were leaving Egypt. God had sent upon the land of Palestine fertilizing showers, and the parched earth was again renewed, the hills and ' plains and valleys were again covered with verdule, and smiling plenty bloomed on every hand. All nature wore an aspect of life and beauty, while songs- of joy and gladness from those who had sur- vived the faminie, were heard in every place. Day after day the cavalcade moves on towards the promised hand, until finally the travelers enter its borders and soon reach Bethel, endeared by many hallowed associations. Abram  and Salai i hasten to the altar erected previous to their depar- ]   TmITE COvT or hHT.     A 1 ture, and there, surrounded by their numerous attendants and relatives, they bow and offer up a sacrifice of gratitude to the God of all their "mercies, and renew their covenant with Heaven. Pleasant to them was the memory of pass mercies, and sacred, above all other spots, was the one which  had been consecrated by prayer and thanksgiiig. Bethel never looked lovelier. It seemed as if to the past drouth had succeeded a new creation. Blooming flowers and clustering fruits were seen on every hand, and every heart was filled with joy at the return of plenty; To Abram and Sarai the simplicity, beauty, and purity of home were far more precious than the luxury and profligacy of the proud palace and court of Pharaoh, and many Band grateful -were the thanks they offered to God for their deliverance. Bethel, however, with all its hallowed and de- lightful associations, was not sufficiently capacious for the numerous and rapidly increasing family and possessions of Abram and Lot. They were exceed- ingly rich in flocks and herds, sheep and oxen, camels and asses, men servants and maid servants, besides a large amount of silver and gold, and costly presents which they had received in Egypt. Though they lived together in peace and unity, yet the possessions of Abram and Lot were not in com- mon, but kept separate and distinct from each other. So far as they were concerned they could ta   i.    THE A60  OOR OF O"ALDEA. h. have lived forever in harmony, because, though 1their possessions were separate, their interests were one; yet it was not so with their herdmen, among whom a strife arose in regard to the occupancy of pasturage. Notwittanding all the efforts at re- conciliation, it became evident that Abram and Lot muist separate, and occupy different territories. 'This was peacefully agreed upon, and Abram, with a magnanimity which ever characterized his life, made the following proposal to Lot: "-Let there be, :I pray thee, no strife between me and thee, and 'between my herdmen and thy herdmen, for we are brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou i wilt take the left hand I will go to the right; or, if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left." Such generosity, on the part of Abram, to one who had under his protection and auspices, received all j his standing in society and acquired all his posses- ! sions, was worthy of the man, and showed him  possessed of a spirit vastly different from that which -governs the generality of the best of men under like circumstances. No sooner was the proposition made, thane Lot, with a different spirit from that which dictated the generous proposal, eagerly made his selection of  the fertile and well watered valley of the- Jordan. t:his pbrtion of the country was fruitful beyond   (ObUtT OF EifT        83 description, and for beauty was compared by the Almighty himself to the garden of the Lord. Evey preparation necessary for the separation and journey being made, Lot, with his men servants and maid servants started for Sodom, one of the chief cities on the banks of the Jordani.':^ Abram, grieved at thp necessity which caused his kinsman to separate from him, greatly feared the consequences of his taking up his abode in a land of strangers, and especially in a city where the inhabitants were wholly given to idolatry. Lot had departed, but not without his blessing, and at the morning and evening sacrifice a fervent remem- brance was had of him and his family in his prayers. Shortly after Lot's departure the Lord appeared to Abram on the mountain, and said, "(Lift up thine eyes and look from the place where thou art, north- ward and southward, and eastward and westward. For all the land which thou seest I will give to thee and thy seed forever. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it, and the breadth of it, for I will give it unno thee." This was but a renewal of the covenant, and while it assured Abram that his conduct in Egypt had not vitiated the sacred agree- ment, it also determined him in regard to his pre- sent location, and leaving Bethel's plains of peace and plenty, he removed, with all his possessions, again to the mountain range of Mamre. We   have already spoken of the mggedness of   84    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHATDEA. this district of country, and the reader has seen its previous inability to support the numerous family, and whether Abram  was prompted to return to Mamre on account of the decrease in his family and flocks and herds by the separation of Lot and his possessions, or whether it was because he wished to extend his range, holding on still to the fertile val- leys as his God-given possession, or whether he was specially directed of the Lord to this course of action, we are not informed. There were, to the mind of Abram, doubtless, reasons sufficient to justify hid in the movement, and subsequent events in his history seems to indicate their correctness.   CHAPTER V. BATTLE OF THE KINGS. RUMORS of war, with its dire alarms, reached the Patriarch ere he had dwelt long in his beautiful mountain home. The confederate kings of the five cities of the plain, namely, Berah, the king of So- dom, Birsha, the king of Gomorrah, Shinab, the king of Admah, Shemeber, the king of Zeboim, and the king of Zoar, were under the government of Chederlaomer, the proud and mighty monarch of Persia. Being uneasy under the Persian yoke, which had pressed with galling weight up&on them for twelve years, and unwilling to be any longer tributary, or submit to the heavy exactions imposed upon them to support that gorgeous Eastern monar- chy, which extended its grasping arms over the most fertile portions of Palestine, they resolved to rally their forces and throw off the yoke. The, note, of preparation was sounded, soldiers were marshaled, and in anticipation of an invasiofi from the Persian army, every city was fortified. So thorough and perfect were the .reparations for de- fejnse, that the Persian power alone was not able to overcome the ^ings of the plain, and again reduce them to subjection. Such was the opinion of 85   86    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. Chederlaomer himself, but he had powerful allies in i the persons of Amraphel, the king of Chaldea,  1 Arioc, the king of Babylon, and Tidal, the king of  th4 surrounding nations, and through means of  messengers sent to the courts of these respective  kings, a league was formed, and every preparation was made for making war upon. the five cities, and visitingheir respective kingir s with summary ven- geanc  Though the,neighboring provinces of Palestine had not f aitnally declared themselves independent,  or entirely united with the five kings in throwing  off their allegiance to the Persian government, still they manifested great disaffection, and bore with great-uneasiness and constant murmurings their subjection to the throne of Persia. Ilhe king of  Persia was aware of this state of things, and for  the purpose of chastising them and thus coercing a more perfect obedience, as well as inflicting pun- ishment, if not a war of extermination upon the  rebellious kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah,  !- Zeboim, and Zoar, the allied powers marched their  armies against the Rephaims in Astaroth-Karnahim, the Zu ims in Ham, the Emims in Shareh-Kiria- thaim, the Horites in Mount Seir, the Amalekites I i in Kadesh, and the Amorites in Wazezontamar. Thousands upon thousands of these defenseless Ca- naanites fell before the victorious arms of the allied powers, and wherever the proud host4O:f Persia and  P,   BATTLE. OF THE KMGS.,    87 Assyria went, they carried desolation and rapine, and death. It appeared that the more that were slain by the insatiate sword, only whetted it for keener rapine and a more sanguinay destructiofn. Tidings of this dreadful war reached the ears of the confederate kings of the vale of Siddim, and instead of remaining in their strongholds and waiting the attack of the enemy, as they should have done, so soon as they learned of their arrival on the con- fines of their territory, they marshaled their hosts and went out to give them battle.i Thogh it was five kings against four yet the army of the five bore no comparison With the numerous hosts of the four mighty kings.  Besides,- the allied forces were flushed with successive victories, and they could not believe that the petty sovereignties of the plain would be able to measure swords with them upon the field of strife. The contending armies at length met, and a fierce and deadly conflict ensued. For hours nought was to be heard but the clash of arms and the groans of the wounded, mingled with the long and deafening shouts of the victors. Chariots and horsemen and footmen were all mingled together in wild confusion in the deadly strife. At length the army of the eastern allies prevgais,; and the kings of the plain retreat to their cities. In their retreat, the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomor- rah, falling in slime pits, with which the plain of kiddim abmu ded in those days, are taken by the     UW    TIB ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. pursuing hosts. The most of the army fled to the mountains, and the victorious hosts entering the cities take possession of the spoils, making all the ia!bitants prisoners. After feasting and rioting Upon the spoils, the cities were stripped of mtch of their treasure, and taking several of the most dis- tinguished citizens prisoners, the army took its departure,  Eight years had now passed away since the sepa- ration of Abram and Lot, and as the distance from Mamre filtor was forty miles, it was seldom that Abram heard of the fate and fortunes of his kinsman., We have already alluded to the rumors of war which came to his ears, and his anxiety for the welfare of Lot was not a little heightened when a messenger, in breathless haste, approached his teat and exclaimed. "Alas, master, Sodom is taken by the enemy, and thy kinsman Lot, with his wife and daughters,  are carried away into captivity,".  "Whence comes the intelligence of my kinsman's I sad fate?"  "The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fell and' were taken in battle, and I, alone, of the number who fleIt' the mountains, have come to tell of my  master,: rt e "What direction took the victorious army with its spoils "         : . i The direction northward, this side t Jordan,.  my lord."    BATTLE OF THE KINGS.     89 "Then, by the help of the great Jehovah, I will rescue him," said Abram, at the same time sum- moning trusty and chosen men, whom he sent as messengers to the conf derate kings of the neie' boring provinces, Aner, Eschol, and Mamre. In the mean time Abam  rmed his owni chosen band of servants, 'to Ache number of, three hundred and eighteen. Up to this time he had been a man of peace, following a pastoral life, and watching with pious fidelity over his flocks and herds, knowing nothing of the tumult and strife, of wasC: how his bosom heaved with a new and mighty I inmulse, not to gain the renown of a conqueror or to gratify a selfish and heartless ambition, but to avenge the wrongs done to his kinsman, and his magnanimous soul was kindled with energy to deliver .him if pos- sible from the hands of the enemy. His beloved Sarai shared in the truly patriotic feelings which moved his heart, and with her own fair hands she anointed his shield, balanced the nodding helmet upon his head, braced the corslet and mailed coat and buckler above the shining armor, and presented himthe bright unsheathed sword which was not to return to its scabbard until injured innocence had been redressed, and the proud conquerors Af Sodom and its confederate cities had been humbled in the dust at his feet,                  , It was not tong ntil the approaching armies of his friendly,allies sounded their trumpets on the /    90 I   TAE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA, mountain ranges of Mamre. Soon, every arrange- ment being made, the venerable patriarch and his allies were seen on the line of march towards the Afla of contest.?On their route they passed the northern limits of the plain of Jordan, and taking the direction of the lake of Gennessaret, they passed i along its shores; crossing the tributary streams of Jordan they foll6wed the course of that river Up to its very head waters. The victorious army of the enemy was still before them, and they hurried their marchesg nly encamping at night for refreshment and restf iThe spirit which actuated Abram seemed to have been communicated to all the confederate forces. His trust was in his God, and he was nerved by superhuman courage to advance upon the foe. Already had the army marched a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, and were nearing the bor- ders of Syria. Believing that the enemy could not be- far off, spies were sent in advance to reconnoiter the ground and ascertain their position. It, was not long until the messengers returned with the tidings that the army of Chederlaomer and his allies was  encamtped in one of the defiles of Mount Lebanon,  reveling!.in the spoils of their successive victories, and wholyi unconscious of any danger.  Abram  called a council of war, and skilfully arranging all the forces as commander-in-chief, it  was agreed that they should aproach as near as possible the covert of the enemy, and wait until the first watch of the night before making an attack.   BATTLE OF THE KfGS.      91.  Night came, and with it the hour for action. Under cover of the darkness, the army, divided into four companies, led on by their respective comman- ders, stealthily advanced upon the encampment at different points. There were no sentinels posted by the enemy to guard the passes, and when they met on the summits and at the openings of the defile, they flanked out right and left. Then rose the battle-cry, which reverberated from rank to rank, "the sword of Jehovah and Abram," and with every sword drawn, and shields bnd lances glittering in the light of the moon, the lpaliot army rushed to the onset. So sudden was the shock of war, and so unprepared were the midnight revelers for defense, that they fell in great numbers, and the only concern that seemed to actuate the entire army was how to make their escape. Never was: stratagem more successful, never was victory more complete. Terror-stricken they fly in confusion, and those who succeeded in making their escape fled into the deserts of Syria. Multitudes were taken as prisoners of war, and allthe wealth of the spoils of the conquering army, of which they had drained Palestine, became the property i Abram a d his confederates.  Lot and his family were saved, together with many of the nobility and citizens of the five cities of the plain. Tlhe army having met with such signal sucless in achieving its object, organized a   o l,    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHATPEA. detachment of chosen men, and made preparations on the following morning to pursue the defeated kings. The route taken by the main body of the army that could be collected after the battle, was known to Abram, for he had sent spies after them. / Immediate pursuit was given, and having but the advantage of a few hours, it was overtaken at Hobah not far from Damascus. A hbt and desperate con- flict ensued in which the kings were again van- quished, and fled, leaving the remainder of the spoil a prey tiqthe victorious cohort of Abram. Abramrnwis now distant from Gomorrah one hun- dred and sixty miles, and from Mamre by that route, two hundred. So completely dispersed and broken were the forces of the enemy, and so little was the probability that they would be able to rally "'gain, or attempt to reconquer the territories through which they had passed, that Abram thought proper to return to the main army, and collecting all the captives and spoils, to make preparations to return toe the cities of the plain. He was encouraged in this by the signal interposition of Divine Provi- dence in is behalf, and on joining the army which he had1e1ft on'the sfdes of Lebanon, his suggestions met with ani unanimous approval from his compan-  ions in arms. In a short time the victorious army was on-- its march home. On their way back the nearest iand most practi- cable route was to leave Gennessaret and4the Jordan i    BATTLE OF TRE RINGS.     8 to the left and pass through the hill country. It was not necessary, now that the great object of the expedition was accomplished, that the army should resort to forced marches, and hence they took their leisure, seeking the most suitable places for encamp- ment. After such a fatiguing march, and arduous but successful battle, the officers and soldiers needed refreshment and rest. On these occasions Abram would take Lot and his family into his tent, and hours were spent in hearing them rehearse their his- tory since the separation, and the adventurous, incidents connected with the fatal battle al Sodom and their captivity under Chederlaomer' ad his allies. The recital of many things connected with life in Sodom, and thetrials and hardships -endured by the family while in captivity, was painful to Abram, and he labored to effect a re-union of the  families, promising them full protection and every blessing they desired, in his mountain home at Mamre. But, alas, Lot's heart was too strongly wedded to Sodom and its pleasure-seeking, profli- gate inhabitants, to induce him. to entertait with proper regard the kind proposal. His wife and daughters, too, had formed assooiations which they could not think of exchanging for: a country home. At length the army approached the ancient city of Salem ,ear to the mount which was called Moriah. It was a lovely spot. A peaceful vale formed by the aforementioned mountain and another   "   2TH'E ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. on the east, which was crowned with olive trees, spread out its inviting bowers to the toil-worn army, and here they pitched their tents and encamped for the night, among the clustering vines and oversha- dowing olives of the valley. A silvery stream wound through the valley, reflecting the hues of the beautiful flowers which grew upon its margin and easting their fragrance on the evening air. The whole valley, and the sides of the mountains,; o their very summits, were clothed with flowers of the most encqhanting hues, and trees of the utmost grace and beauty. It reminded Abram of Eden, in his own land, where he had such a glorious visionat the ceremony of the worship of the god of day. Early on the following morning, while the sun was gilding the tops of Olivet and reflecting its  - mellow glory on the valley below, as Abram was engaged at his devotions in his tent, he was startled at witnessing a form descend into the vale, dressed t in the most gorgeous apparel, with a priestly miter  on his head. For sumptuousness of vestments he b had nevewitnessed any thing, even in the magnifi- cent palace of the ling of Nineveh, or the temple of the pests insbylon, that excelled those worn i by the mysterious stranger. He approached Abram with dignity and grace. An unearthly radiance  shone from his countenance, and a smile-of inimi-  table sweetness played over his calm benignant features. In one hand the stranger held a,roll of   , BATTLE OF THE KINGS.     96 bread, and in the other a cup of wine. "Surely," thought Abram, "this is a celestial visitant, the angel of Jehovah himself." Approaching the tent, Abram advanced to meet him with a firm and confil dent step. Then "the priest of the most high God" presented to Abram the bread and the wine, while the mysterious person pronounced the following benediction: ",' Blessed be Abram of the most high God who is possessor of heaven and earth, and blessed is the most high God, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand." Then was it known to Abram who the stranger was, for though by name Melchezedeck, which in the Hebrew tongue meaneth king of Salem, or prince of Peace, yet had he a name which is above every name, a priest and king forever, without be- .,: ginning of days or end of years. He had communed with God, and the light and glory of that hour con- stituted one of the happiest reminiscences of his eventful but faithful life. A divine revelation unto him, after this manner, had never been Wade to Abram before. The wonderful person before him was the prophet, priest, and king, Infallible, perfect and everlasting, and, a greater thani Abram and all the kings of the earth, and to him the patriarch presented a tenth part of all the spoils of the enemy. as a grateful offering to God for his interposition ia his behalf.  Q   96    THE ASTROLOGER OF, CHALDEA. Pleasant and delightful as it would hdve been for the returning airmn to have tarried longer in this peaceful vgje, it was necessary that they should re- sume their march on the following morning. We shall not detain the reader by a recital of all the events connected with the march from Salem to Sodom. Suffice it to say, that in a short space of time, passing along the valley of the Jordan they entered the rich and fertile vale of Siddim. The king of Sodom, on hearing of their arrival in the country hastened out to meet the approaching army, The released captives shouted aloud for joy when the sight of their native city burst upon their view. Many of them, doubtless, thought when they were taken captive that they were leaving their home and their kindred forever, but Providence had ordered otherwise, and by ,the powerful arm of a chieftain unknown in the annals of war, they were rescued and restored to their homes and friends. The king of Sodom received Abram and his confederates with every demonstration of respect. The spoils of the cities, "Onsisting, in part, as we have already seen, of great treasures, were brought back with the cap- tivesw and preparati ns were made by the generous patriarch to rewtore them to the respective cities to which they belonged. To this end a council of the ikings was called and the treasures presented, that each might claim the portion belonging to their respective provinces. In addition to the treasure   BATTLE OF THE RINGS.     97 werelarge quantities of cattle which had been taken from the inhabitants and theSurrounding nations through which Chederlaomer had pa-d wdth his army. The magnanimous proposal of Abiam to return the spoils of war, which of right belonged to him and his confederates, was met by the generous re- fusal. of Athe kings to receive any portion of it, all they asked was the restoration of the captives of war. To this Abiam replied, "I have sworn to the God of heaven, that I will;ot take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet, and that I will not take any thing that belongs to others, lest it should be said, 'Abram hath gained his riches by force and arms. All that I ask is that which the soldiers have eate, and the portion that js justly due my confederates, Aner, Eschol and Mamre."' The captives from the neighboring states of Palestine were sent, every man, to their homes, with the portion of the- spoil which had been taken from each. Great were the rejoicings in the cities of the plain. All the kings and nobles did obeisance Abram, and such was the respect and esteem in which he was held that they would have mnade him monarch of the land of Palestine, but he reused the scepter at their hands. God haying already given to him the entire country, he chose not to accept any dig tinction or inheritance from mortals, preferrino stand in his lot and obey alone the directions of 7   $98   THE ASTROLOOBR OF CtALDEA. that divine voice' which called him from his motto ina UI of the Challes, and from the temple and pala  ofo abylon to this then unknown land, a stranger and a pilgrim. For him there were to be higher, holier manifestations, connected with the destiny of nations yet unborn, and his faith ia 4he  divine promise assured him, that through his seed, though yet childless, all the nations of the earth were to be blessed to the end of time. The army was disbanded, and the confederates of Abram returned with their portions of the spoils to their respective provinces. At length the day arrived for Abram's return to his home in Mamre. He had not heard from his I/loved Sarai and household since entering upon his sucessful expedition, and he as anxious again to :embrace the wife of his youti and the idol of his heart. Collecting together his servants, now no longer herdsmen, but well trained soldiers, they entered upon theii march.- Vast multitudes, inclu- ding th:kings and nobility, escorted them from So-  dom, andFa the triumphal procession moved through the streets, and passed over the plain to ascend the  mountain, loud ishouts of victory rent the air, while  from every toitgue was heard the exclamation, "Long live Abram, the servant of the most high God possessor of heaven and earth, who hath de- li td our enemies into his hand; and long live Aner and Eschol and Mamrre, his faithful friends and allies."   BATTLE OF THE KINGS.     99 Many had been the fears, and dark the forebodings of the devoted Sarai, and many and earne had been her prayers for the successful return of Hiram. Nor did she hear of anything connected with his fate or that of his army, until, on a clear bright moriing, after rising from her devotions, her heart was made to leap for joy, asifrom her tent she be- held floating in the distance the victorious banners of the returning atmy. Calling her maids, she has- tened out, with timbrels and song, to meet her beloved spouse and his brave soldiers. It was a joyous meeting. Abram sprang forward and clasp- ed in a long and rapturous embrace the beloved Sarai, and all partook of the general joy. Mamre, with its tents, never looked more beautiful, nor di4 ever the mountain plain ring with louder notes of gladness than on that auspicious day. 1\   "CHAPTER VI. VISIT OF THE ANGELS TO SODOM. ON one of those calm, qut evenings peculiar to the rural districts of Palesti'e, as Abram was sit- ting in a grove engaged in meditation, and pleasant feminiscences came thronging upon his mind, in which he experienced the most grateful emotions, arising from a consideration of the Divine interpo- sition on his behalf, especially Sn his late victorious expedition, a shade of doubt, if not of sadness, was meen to pass over his placid features. The thought which rippled the -otherwise calm surface of his features, and cast a shadow over its brightness, was, that having been the commander-in-chief of the confederate forces which achieved a victory over the mighty army of the eastern allies, they would ere long rally their forces and seek revenge. Under such circumstances he could not but feel troubled. At this juncture the Almighty appeared to him and allayed his apprehensions by assuring him that he t had undertaken his defense and would ever reward I :is faithfulness. The words which came to his ears ^and carried confidence to his heart were, "Fear not Aiam, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward." 100    VISIT OF THE ANGELS TO SODOM.  101 In connection with this, another thought of a distrustful character, took possession of his mind; so true it is that kindred thoughts, be tey plasant or painful, generally associate themselves together, and pass in succession before the mind. He had waited long for the fulfilment of the promise made  1 to him in Chaldea, before he left his native city and which had been renewed to him since his arrival in Palestine. He had been for many years a wanderer, and both he and his beloved Sarai had their faith tried in the long delay of the promise. God had ever proven faithful to him, and he had every reason to believe thatl the day of joyous fulfilment would come, but "hope deferred maketh the heart sick," and hope and fear darkly struggled for the mastery. Having had his mind put at rest in regard lto pro- tection from his foes, he desired additional informa- tion as an encouragement to his hopes in regard to the promise, and he ventured to address the Lord, "What wilt thou give me, O Lord," said he, "seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus. Behold, thou hast given me no seed, and lo, one born in my house is my heir." Heretofore he relied on the naked promise of Jehovah; now it seems he wished to have an addki tional confirmation by a sensible sign. God conz descended to confirm the promise as the patriach desired, and commanded him to make preparations for a sacrifice.   102    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA.  Twilight was advancing, the last rays of the set- ting sun had already faded away in the west, and the giant trees of Mamre were casting their shadows on the ground. First the evening star, and then the others in its train, began, one after another, to take their stations in the sky.  Soon the whole heavens were lighted up with the starry host, and the broad galaxy overhead, formed of innumerable suns and systems, seemed like the avenue of angels, through which they entered the portals of heaven. While Abram  stood beside the sacrifice which he had, prepared, and, as he was w6int, gazed on the bright orbs above, a light superior o their bright- ness gently descended from the parted heavens and rested -above him. It was the same divine glory which had before shed its light upon his vision. 'Cast thine eyes now towards heaven," said the Divine voice, "and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them. Thus -shall thy children be, 0 Abram i"   The soul of the patriarch was filled with bewildering delight as he gazed upon the glory above and around him. Deeper and more intense became that glory. It settled upon him and filled his senses with a rapture insupportable to a mortal nature. Abram was entranced. The material world was shut out from his vision, the stars themselves faded away in the ineffable light, and he was lost to all but the spiritual world around him and within him. Before his spiritual vision now spread out the    VISIT OF THE ANGMLS TO sDOM.    103 future of four hundred years, embracing the histry of his family and their various fortunes, from their bondage in Egypt to their final settlement in Pales- tine. All the events connected with their wonderful history, during the hundreds of years to come, were spread out as in a vast panorama before his aston- ished vision. After this had passed, another scene presented itself to the entranced patriarch. Between the parted victims, slain for sacrifice, there appeared a smoking furnape and a burning lamp. These were the symbols of :the Divine pesence, and by Abram their nature and significance were fully understood. The divine promise was now confirmed as it never had been before, and with it was a confirmatioan of Abram's faith, such as ever Afterwards kept him from doubt, and prompted him uit4er the most dis- couraging circumstances to hope on in full assurance of a fulfilment of the promise, in God's own time. When the revelation had ended and the   ivine glory had disappeared, the patriarch was awakened from his mysterious trance as one would awake from a quiet slumber. The light and glory had departed, the smoking furnace and the lamp were gone, All was still.  The moon had ri sn and mwalke    in brightness among the stars. All nature saued to be enjoying a calm repose after being the silent wit*, ness of a scene such as it had never beheld befor. Abram turns away slowly from the spot, and walka    104   Tt1 4AiTROLOGOIR OF O CALDOA.  towards his habitation. Away in the deep shade of the woods he beholds an object approaching. It was a slender, graceful form, not unlike his beloved Sarai and yet it is not the idol of his heart, for he knew too well her step to be deceived in this. A nearer approach shows it to be the dark-eyed Egyp- tian maid, Hagar, whom Pharaoh had presented to Sarai as her attendant at the harem. As she came near she exclaimed, "Is this my Lord? My mis- tress is anxious for thy return, and from the lateness of the hour hath sent me forth to find thee.' It was not long until he emiraced the fxious one, and breathed into her listening ear the binuing thoughts of his heart, re-assuring her that she should yet fold in her maternal arms the hope of the world. Notwithstanding all these assurances, as well as what she had herslf experienced of the divine regard in working out deliverances in her behalf as well as that of her husband, her mind was filled with per- plexing doubts and fears in regard ;to: the fulfilment of God's word, that she should: .bear the t child of promise. "- Years pass away and increase those dis- tracting fears, until at length wearied and faint with  long expectation, she conceives-as:the ever fruitful  and inventive mind of woman is wont to do--a  strange device, and one which, though not positively unlawful in the times in which she lived, 'was still highly questionable, if not dishonorable to her faith, asist'usting the promise and the oath of God con-  i!   VISIT OF THE ANGELS TO SODOM.  106 firmed by the most wonderful signs. The strange and wonderful device which she conceived, was this, namely, to give her favorite handmaid, Hagar, to Abram for a wife in a second and subordinate capacity. She was now well stricken in years, and her faith could scarcely prompt her to believe that she would ever have a child. She would therefore obviate this difficulty, by giving up Hagar to her husband, that the child which should be the result of this temporary union, might be adopted by her and made the childQof promise. Such were the thoughts and reasonings f Sarai, but little did she dream that she was mingling for herself ingredients in a cup of sorrow which she would have one day to drain to its very dregs. Her Egyptian maid should have ever stood before her as a monument and memorial of that unhappy journey to the court of Pharaoh, so deeply fraught with peril to her virtue, but through which Providence had enabled her to pass unhurt. Censurable as she was for her conduct in attempting to forestal the designs of Divine Providence, still she must not be judged too harshy in the light of modern civilization. Polygamy was allowed in that dark age of the world, and for many succeeding ages. She had long and earnestly desired to see her devoted husband realize the great wish of his heart, and none but God knows the struggles of her heart, and the deep, intense and bitter conflicts which she endured before she made   106   THE AlTaOLOGOK oF CHALoDA.  j ups her mind to relinquisho the idol. of her heart to another, and the right of becoming the progenitor w' of that great and honored line which for many years she fondly hoped would have hailed her as their mother. While therefore, the sacrifice which she made evinced great magnanimity of soul, and an earnest desire to)see the plans of Jehovah con- summated, still it was suggested by unbelief in the divine promise, and fraught with peril. No sooner was Hagar raised from the condition of a servant to something like an equality with a mistress than she began to cherish te hope thait-be was to be the favored mother of Abram's posterity; for she was not ignorant of that which interested her master and mistress, and was so often the topic of conver- sation in the patriarchal family.-, The. consequence of such imaginings became soon apparent in her con- duct towards her mistress. Instead of regarding with more respect and affection the woman who had manifested so much magnanimity, and made so great a sacrifice of feeling in her behalf, she affected to look upon her with contempt, and began to assume a supercilious tone in her manners which roused the lofty spirit of Sarai. Though she had by her own mistaken policy brought all these evils upon I herself, still there was a point of endurance beyond which she could tot go, and she consequently made known her complaints to Abram.  The result was that Hagar was excluded from the family and sent ij   VISIT OF THE' ANGELS TO SODOM.   1 07 out an exile into the wilderness of Mamure. Thoug: an outcast, and abandoned by the patriarchal family, still she was not forsaken of God. Sadly and sor-  irowfully she wandered about in the desert, not knowing where  go. She had grievously offended   ?, her mistress, and to return to her seemed impossible; indeed she felt that; rather than do so she would perish in solitude. Weary and fatigued with walk- ing she sat down by one of those fountains of water which break out of the cliffs on the sides of the desert mountain. , Scarcely had she seated -herself ,ere she was  ted by a soft and kindly voice which pronounced her name.   She turned and beheld an angel who continued addressing her, "Whence camest thou, and whther art thou- going." "I flee from the face of my mistress, Sarai." "Return to thy mistress and submit thyself to her hands, for I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, so that it shall not be counted for multitude. Thou Oshalt bear a child and shalt- call his name Ishmael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction."'  For a moment she stood bewildered, for she knew it was the Divine One who spake to her. The tears came flashing up to her dark eyes like the streams from the fountain whose waters were playing at her feet. Obeying the divine directions she turned her steps homeward, and on arriving there, with meek- ness and docility she entered the tent of her mis- tress.    108   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. AIn process of time the child was born, and Abram gave it the name designated by the Lord. , Still he s was not the child of promise, though assured that ' he should be the progenitor of a vast multitude. So far from being the child of promise in whom all the families of the earth were to be blessed, it was said of him that "his hand should be against every man, and every man's hand should be against him." Thirteen long years roll sluggishy away, and during all this time no visions of God throw their light and glory upon t he path of the weary pilgrims. No di- vine messenger repeated the as stmlnce of the long cherishedcpromise, and the sun of Abram and Sarai seemed fast sinking behind a dark and clouded sky. History is silent about the melancholy years passed by the patriarch and his wife. Their faith was put to the severest test. Abram was now nearing his hundredth year and Sarai her ninetieth. But as the darkest hour is just before the breaking day, and as man's extremity is God's opportunity, so in the deepest night of their despondency Jehovah again appeared. The two were sitting together -in their spacious pavilion, given up to sad and melancholy thoughts. Presently a light shone around them, enclosing them as in a circle, and the well, known voice of Jehovah said, "Walk before me, and be thou perfect, and I will make my covenant between thee and me, and I will multiply thee exceedingly." At this Abram fell on his face,- and Jehovah still /   '  II'T Of THE ANGELS TO SODOM. oiters edwith him, saying, i"As for me;:behoid my cove'nant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of many nations, neither shall thy names be Abraam Bb , and Sarai, but Abraham and Sarah, for a father and  a  mother of many nations have I made thee. I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and nations and-kings shall come out of thy loins. I will make a covenant between me and thee, and thy-seed after thee in their generation, for an everlasting covenant, to be   f a God unto thee-and thy seed forever. And I will Igive unto thee and thy seed, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession. This is the covenant which I shall make, and which thou and thy seed shalt keep forever. Every man child that is-among you shall be circumcised, and it shall be a token of a covenant between me and you. As for Sarah, I will bless her and she shall have a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and she shall be the mother of many nation!. I will also establish my covenant with Isaac at this time next year." After this Jehovah -ceased talking with Abraham, the  glory departed from the tent, and the patriarch arose and taking Isfhmae?; and all that were born in his house, he performed upon them and upon him- self the rite of circumcision, as the Lord had com- manded.  It is the hour of noon, and under the burning rays of an Asiatic sun, every thing droops and lan- guishee in Mamre.

While the venerable patriarch was sitting in his tent door, rosenjoying the refreshing shade cast byraham and one of the spacious trees by which it was em- i bowered, be was startled by the sudden a pearasonagce of three mysterious strangers who had taken their station at the foot of the tree. With true patri- archal hospt ity he immediately rose from his seat, 'and haste i"ifto the strangers invited them to enter his tent for purposes of rest and refreshment. At this a most interestifig ,colloquy ensued between Abraham and one of them, -whom he soon recog- nized to be the Lord, the same divine personage that had appeared to him before, and had spoken words of comfort and blessing.

But tioe hospitality of the patriarch did not end '   . here.? The sacred record informs us he took the three angels on their journey. Their destipation    + : was the.,cities of the plain. After traveling some diltance, one offthe three (the Lord), informed Abraham of the object of their visit, which was the    i destruction of these cities on account of their fla- grant crimes. The heart of Abrahamwas touched at their impending doom; besides, Lot, his kinsman, was an inhabitant of one of these devoted cities, and must inevitably, with his family, share a common fate with their population. HTO therefore intercedes in their behalf. Knowifg that the divine justice did not require the punishment of the innocent with the guilty, as illustrated by the deliverance of Noah and gis family when the world was destroyed by water, he suggests that sparing mercy exercised on the condition that a certain number- of righteous men be found. But, alas, there were not five among all the guilty thousands, that feared God and wrought righteousness. Expostulation could go no further; he resigned the doomed cities to their fate and turned his face towards home. Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, as we have seen, were regal cities. They were not built at a very early period, as we find no traces of:them ,N.          *   c"'   1s    . TH ASTROLOGER OF OCT BA .  . in  Aehiistory. In the same chapter o: Genesis in which an account of the building of Xineveh, ^. ehoboth, Calah, and Resin, 'occurs, we find a men- ton of Sodom and Gomorrah as already existing cities. They occupied a spacious valley or plain, hemmed i in by towering mountains. Through the center of this valley flowed the river Jordan. Divine inspi. ration in recording the beauty and fertility of the spot, compares it to the Garden of the Lord, or an. cient Ednen% This description leaves a wide margin for speculation. Notwithstanding the devastations of war, these cities were filled with an immense population. They were surrounded by extensive 'fields of waving grain, oliveyards, vineyards, and immense tracts of verdurd enameled with flowers of every hue.  The sun was just sinking behind the western hills,  and the lowing herd wed returning to their peaceful folds, driven by their attendant shepherds, as the three strangers are seen descending the western de- clivity and directing their steps with rapid pace  tWwards Sodom. Lot, as an elder in Sodom, sat at  the gate to dispense justice, and the appearance of the three mysterious travelers arrests his attention. i Their dress, their features, and whole demeanor, A are singularly striking, Instead of sensuality and wickedness, which so strongly marked the bold , wantn features of the Sodomites, he beheld angelic  1' * 'I   VISITF THE ANGELS TO SODOM.   j 113 purity, :innocence, and sweetness. nriw the unblushing *;wicedfeB of his neighbors, whose fil- thy conversation andideeds vexed his righteous so8 from day to day, he feaed lest the strangers would  suffer abuse at their polluted hands. To'offer them the protection and hospitalities of his house was but  the work of a moment, and he invited them to enter his dwelling and take up their abode with him during their stay in the city. The angels seemed unwilling * to comply with :this request, and informe4 Lot that *  they would stay all night In the street." At this he earnestly pressed them to enter his house, and they finally yielded to his solicitations. Supper was provided by the' family, and the guests having partaken, were about retiring to rest, when a wild, rude shout, as if from an excited mob, was heard in front of the dwelling. A large com- pany of guilty Sodomites, composed of the hoary headed and the .young, claiorously demanded that the strangers be given to them. Lot #t:ut of his house closing the door after him, and affectionately remonstrated with them, saying, "I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly." All his kind'i 4 monstrance and entreaties were in vain. In vain did he plead the rites of hospitality due to stran' gers. One of the mob came up and in a gruff, angry voice, commanded Lot to " stand back."' Just then another of the lewd rabble exclaimed "This fellow came in to sojourn with us, and he must nee a 8                    ,   "4   AT, ASTBoQL RB F COQHAbiIM. jud' now we will deal worse with him than with the strangers." At this the crowd pressed in upon im, and came near forcing the door. Just at that  moment one of the angels drew Lot into the house and closed the door, and at the same time smote the infuriated mob with blindness, so that old and young  staggered round in darkness, not knowing where to  go. Thus disarmed and disqualified for further attack, they made no subsequent attempts at forcing an entrance int6 the house. The 'angels then in-  formed Lot of the object of their visit, and advised  him to gather together all his kindred and make immediate preparation for leaving the city. He'ac- Oordingly hasteni'to their residences. It was now the dead hour of night, the rabble had dispersed and the streets were comparatively deserted, but here and there, in lordly palaces, lights  were gleaming and the palaces shook witD the heavy tread of the multitude in the whirl of the giddy dance. Alas mirth and revelry. No sleep till  morn would come upn the eyes of all those guilty throngs. Alas! that it should prove the long dread  steep of death. From street to street Lot hurried on. Finding his relatives, he uttered the warning, "'Up! Get ye out of this city, for the Lord will de- stroy it." Instead of heeding the warning, they looked upo'n him as one bereft of his senses. With '  a sad heart he left them to their fate, and returned i to   welling.                 i    VISIT OF TrH ANQXrS TO 8OD0M.  115 At length the night passed away, the last night to Sodom and its sister cities. The grey streaks of morning were tinging the eastern sky. A long narrow line of light skirted the summit of the eas- tern mountain which bounded the plain of the Jordan. The watchmen were retiring from the walls of the city, and the revelers to their homes, sur- feited with debauchery. The only period of stillness for the twenty-four hours had come to Sodom; but it was the stillness that precedes the storm. It was like the hushed stillness which nature inspires pre- vious to the enactment of one of 4her awful dramas. ,The angels arose, and taking ot, his wife, and two daughters, the only inmatesf the family, thef hastened out of the city. On their route, not far from the base of the mountain to the south of Sodom, lay the city of Bela, or Zoar. The& angels having con- ducted the family within sight of this city, said to Lot, "Escape, for thy life look nt behind thee, neither stay thou in ,ai the plain, escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed." But Lot re- plied, " Not so, my Lord; behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast mag- nified thy mercy which thou hast showed unto me, in saving my life, and I cannot escape to the moun- tain lest some evil take me, andI die. This city is near to flee to, and it is a little one: 0, let me escape thither, adh4 d y soul shall live."  The angel con- sented, and said, "I will not overthrow this  gr   "6 .   Ti - ASTOLOGER OF CHA PEA. which thou hast spoken, -but haste thee escape thither, fot I cannot do anything until thou art ,here."  At this Lot and his two daughters hasten- ed on, but his wife lingered behind. Two of her daughters, with-all of her pleasant things, were left behind, and she was loth'to leave the idols of her Deart   , Thi sun was just gilding the top of the mountain which rises above Zoar, as'Lot entered ittsgate. It was/a lovely morning in sumnm*.- All nature re- joiced in the light of day. The dew drops which : heaven shed so gently on flower and tree during the night, sparkled l(,e diamonds in the light of the Itnring sun. The birds sang sweetly as they flit- ted from bower to bower, and filled the groves with melody. All, bu  an, was innocent, and all, but man, united in ascriptions of praise to God. Scarcely had the whole disc of the sun become visible to the. dwellers on, jhe plain ere from the west, as if mftm the very :8:ePths of the great sea, there arose a dark and Angry cloud, whose fretted borders wire seen emerging from the summits of the craggy mountain which overlooked the valley from the west. Onward the storm-cloud urged its way.  Soon the whole heavens were shrouded in darkness, ,nd blackness covered the cities of the plait. ;The wolf of the mountain raa howling from his lair. The eagle screal'ng with ight, swept awaxj1 her yri on high. The birds bewildered,   VISIT OF THE ANGELS TO SODiOM.  117 flew ab(ut wildly, and ceased to sing. All nature joined in a wail of mourning, for the day -of doom had come. That cloud was charged with wrath' and presently, as from a thousand batteries, there poured forth streams of liquid fire, which like burn- ing lava from a volcano, fell upon the cities of the plain, and, instantly they were enveloped in a gen eral conflagration. The palaces and dwellings and walls, coiposedatthey were of highly inflammable materials,: were all consumed in the devouring fire; the very plain ignited like inflammable gas, and the whole valley was consumed, embracing the circuit of the cities. The whole area; to the affrighted spectator, looked like a vast cauldron of boiling pitch on fire, the roar of which made the surrounding mountains tremble. The wife;f Lot, not heeding  5 the admonition of the angel; but casting long and lingering looks towards the idols of her heart which she left in Sodom, was, caught -in the outskirts of the storm, and to this ay a pillar of salt, .detached from the side of the mountain, near the shore of the Dead Sea, is pointed out by the natives as the pil- lar of Lot's wife. Abraham, "the friend of God," and- the father of the faithful," after leaving the angels, returned / to his home on the highlands of Mamre. His mind t was filled witlh, many overpowering -thoughts: the promise of - of the eelestial strangers in regard  : to Sarah, and that in his promised son all -fltmi-   "8   THR ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. ,Jlies of the earth should be blessed, the descendants of whom were to be as numerous as the stars of heaven, for multitude-the fate of Sodom, and Lot, his kinsman, all constituted themes of absorbing interest, and produced in his mind the most intense excitement. e Passing a sleepless night, he hastened in the morning to the highest point of the mountain range, whicth-formed the southern boundary of Mamre, and casting his eye in the direction of the valley of the Jordan, he saw immense columns of smoke rising up and- coering thb whole valley for many miles. It was asa awfully sublime spectacle and. filled the patriarch with awe. As he gazed upon the scene before him, the smoke, which was so dense, after attaining a certain aletude settled and appeared like a-huge black mi*mment which had risen up from the talley below, filling the entire space and forming ar immense dome, thebase of which was formed by the mountaifs that skirted the valley on either side. To Abrahan this was a/tmrost melancholy sight, and he turned afa to weep over the fate of Sodom.   CHAPTER AVt. PROMSE-FULFILLED,       - . SOUTH of the high plains of Mamre, between Xr desh and Shur, was Gerar, one of the Metropolitan cities of Palestine., Soon after the destruction of Sodom and the neighboring cities, from some cause or other, concerning which history and tradition are both silent, Abraham collected together his numer- ous family and possessions, and removed to this city. Strange as it may seem, on his way thither, he conceived the same device wherewith to deceive the king of Gerar that he bg;d adopted to deceive Pharaoh, in regard to his relat on to Sarah. The longevity of the- men and women was such, at that early day, that though Sarah was well stricken in years, she had not passe&d:lif6's prime, and still re- tained her surpassing beauty. Indeed, if any thing, she was more beautiful than in her youthful days, age having imparted an expression and character to her oriental features which made her a model of womanly beauty. When the family arrived at the city, Abimelech, the king, no sooner saw her than, like the king of Egypt, smitten with her-beauty, he resolved on ta- king her to his embrace.  Learning that he was "9   , lS-   TIEb ASTROLOGER OF CHAnLEA. : Abraham's sister, he ordered her to be taken to his *palace for the purpose of making her his concubine. She was accordingly removed, and while the king was making preparation for the sacrifice of her vir- tue, the Almighty appeared to him in a dream and warned him from committing the iniquitous act by assuring him that if he took to his embrace a wo- nian whose husband was a prophet, he should be punished with immediate death. In' consequene of this inirposition, thei king immediately summoned Abraham to his presence, whom he severely repri- manded for his imposition in calling the woman his sister, when she was his wife. The prophet alleged that he did it for his own safety, being apprehensive that had it been known she was his real wife, he might in order to possess her, have robbed him of his existence. He also assured hin, that she was his sister, for though not born of his mother, she was begotten by his father. The explanation satis- fied the king,:and heestored Sarah and give many valuable presents to Abraham with a full permission for him to settle in any rit of the land. The Lord had not-only threatened the king with death, should he violate the chastity of Sarah, but also afflicted him and all the women belonging to him with a kind of impotence. In return for Abimelech's generosity the. Patriarch prayed that th6 curse of impotency might be removed from the king and all his women, and the result was iiat all were restored to their natural power and frtility.

The birth of a child is always an event which awa- kens the de'ep fountains of a mother's love, but what pen can describe the sensations which thrill her soul when she looks upon her first born? A cord is then struck which had been untouched before. Whether in moments of playfulness when the springs bf young life are gushing with a wild exuberant joy, or in the more sanguine days of riper youth when life opens its gorgeous scenes to view, never before has she experienced such deep and overwhelming sensations of rapture. Before, she had loved with an affection sweet as life itself and had felt all the bliss of being loved, but now her emotions are of a new nature, at least of a higher nature; her eye fills with tears while she gazes, and the blood dances with soft yet rapturous delight through her veins. In its strength and power that love may be felt again, but in its strange, mysterious novelty, never. What then must have been the feelings of Sarah, as, for the first time, she gazes upon the beloved gift of God! They were indeed the feelings of a mother, but there were most glorious associations connected with the birth of her child. It was the realization of a long deferred.:, the fulfilment of   f Me  .  :HE A8TBOLOGEB 0F OHALDEA. ^lomise that was to embrace in its wide sfeep :te destiny of the world. As she pressed the lovely babe, for the firsti,ime, to her throbbing bosom, all the old and hallowed memories of the past, and all the long cherished hope f the future came crowd- ing with their gushing glories upon her bewildered 'iagination, filling her with unutterable emotions. SquAll was joy and gladness in the tents of Abraham. A joyous festal day had come, and every heart was glad. It was the period when the beloved Isaac. should be weaned from his mother's breast and re- ceive the seal of the covenant, of which hd was the pledge. Abraham's chosen men and maid servants were present to participate at the spacious pavilion of the Patriarch in the festivities of the hour. The dark-eyed Egyptian, maid, with her wonderful son, was there, and the ceremonies connected with the religious rite were about being performed, when, in the sneer and laugh of Ishmael, who seemed to have been pre-ordained to'marall scenes of happiness by an opposing hapd, was witnessed a contempt for the child of p omise. This aroused the grief and indig- nafiin of the mother, who said to her husband, "Cast out this bondwoman and her son, for -the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son." It was uttered. in a strong, peremptory tone, as it was- notthe first time offense had come through Ha- gar.   Abraham was sad on account of his son Ishmael. His bi iraead awakened the first parental -   PROMSE FULFILtD. *  i *    ti e feelings, and to cast him off was a severe trialW - i his faith.

The scene that followed has been ^pWtrayed in vivid colors upon the canvass, and with deep pathos by the pen, as Hagar is represented in subdued sadness turning herself away to catch with tearful eye the tent she' should behold no more--the trembling benediction of the patriarch father, as, with a gush of grief known only to a father, he presses his boy for the last time to his throbbing heart. The bondwoman and her son started out on their weary pilgrimage, friendless exiles in the forest soli- tudes of Beer Sheba. They wandered on till night, not knowing whither they had strayed; and when fatigued and overcome with their weary journey, they laid down side by side on the dewy earth, be- neath the quiet stars which looked forth like angel guardians upon the exiled sleepers. Day after day they journeyed on, penetrating farther and farther into the wilderness, and as-the anxious mother saw the scanty provision fast wasting away, a darkpros- pect, a frightful image of starvation rose before -her affrighted imagination. Still she shut it out and hoped in God.

It was not long until they found subsistence, and in that very w  derness'where Jehovah met Hagar and Ishmael, te, son became a mighty warrior, and it is the posses- sion of his descendants to this day. In: prode:a of time his mother procured for him a wife of her own kindred among the dark-eyed daughters of Egypt, and the exile from Beer Sheba became the wild man of prophecy, the father of a Vandering people, as yet unconquered and unconquerabie. But more of this anon, Not long after the great festival which was held by the family of Abraham and the events which we have recorded in regard to Hagar and Ishmael had taken place, the kingof Gerar, and the captain of his host presented themselves at the door of the patriarch's tent. It appears that some- strife had arisen between'some of the subjects of the king and Abraham's servants in regard to a well of water, and that it had occasioned a strife in which the Philistines had proven too strong for Abraham's ser- vants. The difficulties connected with this contest had just come to the ears of the patriarch, and he was not much at a loss in conjeot ing the object of   l be       1^6B   THE ASTROLOXBR OF CHALDEA. this visit., The chief optain of the host had him- self led on the contest, and fearing lest the wratli of Abrahamnwould be roused, and being well aware of his power as a warrior, the fame of his achieve- nats in rescuing the kings of Sodom from the combined forces of the East having reached his ears, hne therefore comes to the patriarch accompanied by 6tlhe king for the purpose of suing for conditions: of peace. Phibol, for that was the name of the captain of the host, addressing Abraham, said, in behalf of the king, "God is with thee in all that thou doest. Now, therefore; swear unto me, by the great Jeho- vah, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, no rwith my son's son, but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned." Abraham then addressd Ahimelech, and after reproving him on account of the violence used by his subjects inregard to the well, said, "O, king, be it according asfhou wilt, I am ready to swear." Abimelech/replied, "I know not who hath done this thing, neither had I heard of it until now." All things being in readiness for the cove- nant, Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and he also took seven ewe lambs and set them before him. The king, not understand- ing this last presentation, said to Abraham, "What meaneth this?" He replied, "They are a witness   PROMSE FULFILLED.     127 unto me that I have digged this well." "Be it so," said the king, and they crossed their hands and swore in the presence and name of God, everlasting friendship for each other. After the ceremony was ended, Abraham called the place where the c(i- nant was made, Beer Sheba, because there both of them had sworn-and such is its name to this day.  , -   ;A.    * - Vf'o   CHAPTER VIII. THE TRIAL OF FAITH. ISAAC, the child of promise, and the pledge of Unliversal blessing to man, was reared by his mother with tenderest solicitude in the nurture and admoni- tion of the' Lord. For several years nothing occur- - red to mar the peace of the faithful family, or break in upon their joys. All was light and sunshine in the tent of Abraham. The young and beloved Isaac had passed his childhood and -reached the pe- riod of youth, full of promise, and the idol of his parent's joy. He was not only the hope of their declining years, but he was destined to be the hope of the world, as God had promised that in him all the families of the earth should be blessed. Though no cloud as yqt had cast its shade over the, bright, scene of patriarchal life which we have beeen contemplating, yet a time of trial was approach- ing-the last trial through which the patriarch was to be called to pass until he should stand before the throne on high. As the last and most intense flame which was to perfect the-gold in the purifying pro- cess, so was this ordeal to develop the perfection of a faith which in all trials had never failed, and which was now to shine with transcendant bright- 128 ,    THEI TRIAL ,OF FAITH.    129 ness, and become the mndei of faith t tohe^world, in all time to come. It was not for Abraham alone that he was to pass through the fires in glorifying his God. His faith was to be an example i all generations, and the mode of its trial was to ty-  pically illustrative of a great sacrifice thlough which the world was to be redeemed to God. It was de- signed to be the adumbration of an event the most glorious that ever came to the world, and the Ifill- ment of which would wake the symphonies of new harps in heaven and new songs on earth. It was to W create an expectation which would awaken the anx- iety of patriarch, prophet and King, and constitute the grand desire of all nations. Abraham was offering up his sacrifice in the grovae of Beer Sheba. The poet beautifully alludes to a historic fact in the religious exercises of the patri- archs, when he says, "The groves were God's first temples."  There the morning and evening sacrifice woild x '4  ascend, accompanied by fervent prayer to heavel i and there the Great Jehovah, in answer-to the simple faith and in confirmation of the simple worship or- dained in Eden, would reveal himself and hold communion with the worshipper, as friend holds fellowship with friend. None enjoyed a m0oe free and familiar intercourse with the Almighty thai did the patriarch Abraham. He was, not qly from the 9 9     * v         -i   At30   THE ASTBOLOOR OF CAALEA. pa rity adnstgnLth of hit faith, called "the father ofthe faithful," but from his frequent and unbroken ,om-mijion with Jehovah, he was designated in an emiaent sense, "the friend of God." lwBas on one of those calm and quiet evenings whih are p'culiarly adapted to meditation, that the patriarch having offbred his sacrifice was absorbed i deep nmeditation. His prayer had been heard, his 4erifice tad been accepted, and the Divine pres- ence and glory were around him; At luch a time thhe mind enjoys a vivid consciousness of spiritual things, and shut off from external objects in its elairvoyantr state, beholds unseen realities. The spiritual vision takes in its wide and far reaching scope, the past, the present, and the future. Never before did the mind of Abraham enjoy a greater ex- altation. The scenes through which he had passed when God appeared to him on the banks of the Tigris, and his subsequent manifestations as he loueyed from place to place, associated with the Wde :ful providence which had presided over his idestiny, and the remarkable fulfilment of the pro- mise, were all vividlY before him. His faith, great before, was strengthened, and realities of the things hoped foi, came up before him, and he witnessed, as it were, the unrolling of a grand panorama, ex- hilAti4el g enes in the life of his son, as the nations of th: earth were blessed through his instirumein tality. Ish eiil was no more to him. He had pat- .,   "THl 'TRIAL )F- FAITH.   " ed from him at the Divine, commaid,'ever more to gaze upon his fach again. His affections were now centered upon Isaac, the promised child -he gift of heaven. As the child of a glorious destihy, born  under a brighter star than all the kingsaid pre es of Chaldea could boast, his faith assured himsthat that star would not set until all the Divine promises were fulfilled, and that the same miraculous cireum. stances which attended his birth would attetl his life, and 'ttch over his destiny. The reverie of the patriarch at length*ras broken by the Divine voice, which firmly but kindly fell upon his ear, calling hinithy name. To the Divine call he responded quickly, and said, "Here I am, Lord, what wouldst thou have me do." "Take thy son, thine only son, Isaac, and go with him to Mount Moriah, and offer him there to me in sacrifice.' Didhisfaithstagger? Notfor a moment. Dlread- ful as was the command, he knew it was fromi! God  and all would end right, He felt firmly convilped that should he obey it, and slay his own son on the altar of that mountain, that God would raise him to life again. What Jehovah :ws about to do was as  yet wrapped in a mystery which he could not inow,?: solve, but he was fully,' conscious that he would know thereafter when the work was doneinl' t: He rise, and with unfaltering step and unquaiing heart returned to his tent, to the smilj and greet- 'i'     ' I, +  , Or,        .*-   1:32   THE JROLOOR  OF OilDEA. 6  ings onf hi-iled  Sa ra, and her son. No cloud was on his braw; so fa:fbm it, the vision and glory of the/ored grove were carried into the tent of his bdlove& and dark and mysterious as wag the com- maSl of .Aovah, is unshaken faith enabled him to realize alperfect submission and resignation. His experience was too eep in th things of God to /ause him to falter for a moment, or produce the 8shest sl 's of distrust in the providence of God. That night he went to rest as only those can rest *hwio rest ;ifthe arms of Jehovah, and the beiful visions which came to him in his sleep were only premonitory of the g1ot i s issue of the trial that awaited him. In the morning he made the neccessary prepara- tions for his journey, and taking with him Isaac and r two servants, with th- necessary beasts of burden, they left for the mountain. It was a three days 'jo y, and when they arrived at the foot of the mo:tain, in the vale which bounds it on the south- west, they Balled a halt and tarried for the night. In the beautiful valley on the other side of this mountainous region, Abraham had pitched his tent before, and it was we he was'visited by the priest /r:e most high God, who, as King of Salem, had boxmee down to commune *th and bless him ohis retjn:::*n the slaughter of the kings on the sides, Te untsLes  ,haaon. h- a c  c    ompan A ra,-l The terlts who had accompanied Abra i,  *   'fis TRIAL O FA.  .    3 and his son Isac, to the bage of thM 1titain :were apmmm nded to tarry therommntil they homld ascend its side and offer the sacrifice upon'its su*'iit,; and return. ie wood which had been gatherd from the grove of Beer Sheba and pelpared *b the WPrnt ' offering, was now placed upon the shoulder of Isaac, and the father takin:g the inrose burner, in which was the fire taken from the holy altar in the grove he ancdthe son commenced the ascenti the, mo:n- tain. :bjly father?"           *  "Here am I, my son."

At this crisas of intense and painful interest on the part of -Isaac, who carefully watched every- move-- ment of his father, Abraham wi#h firm and deliber- Cto step approached his son, and taking a cord, he toun his hafids tightly behind him and placed him upon the altar. t  The sacgd historian did not record the farther conversation that passed between the father and the sonM  The probabilityTs-hat the scene was enacte&. in silence, a sublime aid awful silence, like that which reigned in heaven when the angel opened the seventh seal, or that silence which hung onn the lips olf Jesus when, as a lamb he was led to the slaughter.

"Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thort any thing unto him, for now I know that thou fear- est, God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, i. thine only son, from me.:" At this the father'quickly cut the cords that bound Isaac, and looking round he saw a ram caught by his horns in a thicket close by, and takirg it he offered the heaven-sent victim as a burnt offering to the Lord, in the place of his son. As the smoke ascended from the altar and rose up as a grateful and accepted sacrifice to h:Fen, Abraham realized that the ground whereon ]thiod was consecrated, and he called it Jehovah Jireth, as it is said "In the mount of the Lord it 'shall be seen." The poet has most beautifully expressed the feelings of the patriarecNn the description of: the scene.  clie rose up and laid .;, The wood upon the altJ :A was done; : te stood a moment-and "deep quick flus tk Passed o'er his countenance, and then he aermed   136   TrHE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDRAX. -   t' ispirit with a bitter strength and spoke- I  "Isaacl my only son." ---The boy looked up, And Abraham turned away his face and wept. "Where is the lamb, my father?" O, the tones, The sweet the thrilling music of a child!

Such a trial only he could know, and such a faith only he could have, and he would have passed that trial and clung to thatfaith if the earth had reeled from her orbit, the sunn turned to darkness, and the moon into blood. The work was done, and the faith of Abraham, like'gold seven times tried in the fire, came out per- feet. There was no speck or slightest alloy in his spotees, -transparent character. His faith was ac- Po.  d to him for a righteousness which all the works of man could not by any possibility secure, and he thus was made the type of the faithful inS all ages, and the great- father to the church of a prin- ciple which was to costitute the condition of accept tanice with God and the agency through which all spiritual good was to come to man.

It Was from him that a descendant should spring who would turn aside from the throne and scepter and wealth and pleasures of the mightiest monarchy in the world, and embrace a life of reproach and disgrace and toil and hardship, impelled thereto by a faith which would overleap the present and fasten as an anchor on the rewards of the future. By this faith men were to quench the violence of flames, escape the, edge of the sword, stop the mouths of lions, subdue kingdoms, work righteousness, obtain promises, out of weakness be made strong, wax valiant in fight, turn to flight the armies of the aliens. Through this faith also women were to benerved with an unwont- ed courage, and were to receive their dead raised to life again, and even to brave tortures, not accepting release therefrom, that they might receive-a better resurrection. But time would fail to tell of al its glorious results as the ever progressive developments of it should be exhibited to the world. But the heavenly communication was not ended. Again the Divine voice is heard resounding through the solitude, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth," immedi- ately responded the patriarch.,- , "By myself have I sworn, tant because: thou Iast done this thing, and thou hast not withheld thy son,   183   riTHE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDE4. thine only son, from me, in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplyingIF will multiply thy seed as the stars of ihe heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore, and thy seed shall possess-the gates of his enemies, and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, bediuse thou hast obeyed my voice." Isaac had been from his earliest years instructed in the thingsof God, had always been present at the family devotions, and, as a young priest consecrated to the sacred service, had assisted his father at the holy altar, but never before had the voice of Jehovah fallen upon his ear, and while he was made a parta- ker of his father's faith, he was also permitted to witness a confirmation of that faith in the interposi- tion which had been made in his behalf, and the pro- mise and oath made to his father. Heavei-inspired, he felt a new life spring up within him, and the always bright countenance of the youth shone with greater radiance than ever it had done before. It was to him an era in his life never to be forgotten, and ser- ved more powerfully than all parental instruction to form a character which was to be connected with some of the most eveitful scenes that ever occurred in the life of man. Ishmael was now a wanderer in the deserts of Arabia, the child of a wild and fear- ful destiny, but Isaac was, partaker of his father's faifti and hope, a child of the most glorious promise, and whose life was to be identified with the destiny of nations to the end of time.   w THE TRI-AL OlF FAITH.    139 With frm and elastic step, though well stricken in years, the venerable patriarch with his heaven appointed son, descend the mountain,? and taking their servants resume their homeward journey. Whether the nature of this journey was known to Sarah or not,-;the sacred historian does not inform us, but she doubtless waited with anxiety the return of the father and longed again to behold the face of her dearly beloved son. Though the time was short he never had been absent from her sight so long be- fore,' and when-he bounded into the tent he was in- stantly caught in the maternal arms and folidedto the loving heart of the mother. Soon after Abraham's return from the sacrifice on Mount Moriah, he received intelligence from his brother Nahor, whom he leftin the city 6f Ur. It had now been a long time since he had left his na- tive land, with its magnificent cities, for a country life in the land of Palestine. Though he often thought of Nineveh and Babylon, and the scenes of his childhood and youth in Ur, with the circum- stances connected with his conversion from idolatry, and his call to leave thi land for an unknown coun- try, still he had no desire to return, He had proven the great Jehovah thus far, and his faith was more than ever strengthenedin regard to the future. The days of his youth hid been days of blessedness and bliss uninterrupted. Prosperity and happiness had atten- ded his riper years, and now that old age had come ff;'            i" ,       \       o   "O    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. Clpon hip he realized that his last lays were his best days in the servite of his God. Though his brother still chose to dwell-in Chaldea, the most of his de- scendants had removed to Padan Aram, in Canaan, p and it was through these thast the patriarch beard of the condition and ciroumtance- of him and his family. His children had grown up and married. Among the number of those who still resided in the city of Ur, was Bethuel, the youngest son of Nahor, whoseounion with a fair daughter of Mesopotamia had been blessed with a child of the most remarlkable 'promise. Her name was Rebekah. She had already passed the days of her childhood, and was fia blushing, as the virgin rose, into the maturity -?- womanhood. Reared under the most genial circum-5 stances, she possessed4 native grace and sylphke form. From a lofty brow fell on each side of her neck curls of dark, flowing, glossy hair. Her eyes were large and black, beautifully overarched by brows of jet, as if penciled with a master hand. Her complexion, though tinged by an oriental sun, was yet elear and transparent. She was th, pride of. the maidens of Ur, and the young men would seek her for a companion at the sacred festivals. r'"F t s'   X s     'APTE-  l W i GLOO    AD^GLADNESS. ISAAo had passed the years of his minority and had become" aman. But still he4qesided at the pa- ternal mansion, thbi old homestead to which his father had returned in Mamre, and was the stay and staff of the declining years of his devotedn'ther v ad mother. Old age had brought feeblenes to the liabs of both, and the inclined head and tottering step halted to the tomb. More especially was this the case with thk mother. She who in her younger days was the most beautiful of all Chaldea's daughters, and who, even in maturer years surpassed the beauty of Egypt's dark-eyed maidens, and whose dangerous charms had more than once involved Abraham in difficulties, such as only God could de- liver him from, was now wrinkled and bent with hoary years; but still age id not effaced all the lines of beauty from that once bright and yet happy counte- nance. There still lingered enough to show that she had been ,iast in a finer mould than is usually awarded to the lot of mortals. In the estimation of the patriarch she was a princess still, and none could with her compare. -But, she had lived out her "1 ' ' -^ t           v ' .   "2    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA.        i "Iotte time, and her earthly race was run.

' A holy quiet, like that of creation's first Sabbath morns pervades the plain of Maamre. It was the last day of summer. The groves and fields of Mamre wear a serene And quiet aspect; and naught but the chirping of the grasshopper and the coo of the mourtful dove were heard to treak the stillness. The patriarchal encampment seemed solitary and deserted, and the air of stillness which reigned around, save when some servant of the household would be seen moving. noise3esslyoaround with sad and dejected countenance, gave unmistakeable to- kens that some sad calamity had fallen upon the family of the faithful. And such it was. Death had invaded the  cmpn ent, and the beloved and beautiful Sarah w s no ore. The partiarch's face is darkened with sorrow as he bows beneath the chastening rod in the tent of affliction. Alas, to him the sad but certain crisis had come, and stricken with grief, his sad, heart pours forth his sorrows. In all, however, there W a quiet resig- nation to the will of God, which could not admit of boisterous grief. Though that beautiful form, pale as the snow, was devoid of life and motion, yet it *^-i  Sc,    d   - GLOOM AND GLADNESS.      143 was only the casket which contained the -immortl gem, and the spirit of the beloved was with angels and God.

The light of the tent was gone, and every head was bowed with sorrow, while every eye was be- dewed and dimmed with tears at the loss. The nu- merous servants of the family, old and young, were deeply affected at the loss of their mistress, and wherever the sad intelligence went, it carried mourning, for "None knew her but to love her, -None named her but to praise." In the territory on the north of Mamre and ad- joining it, was a rocky cavern, which nature seemed to -have hewn out as a place of sepulcher. It was known by theipame of the cave of Machpelah. This grotto belonged to prince Ephron the, Hittite. Being a beautiful and secluded spot, it occurred to Abraham that he would visit the neighboring prince,   J144   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALPEA.  - and if possible, purchase the tract of land on which it stood, as a family sepulcher. After the oriental custom of mouriingifor the dead was ended, hepro- ceeded to visit the prince and cmake, the application for they burial pia e. VtOn his way he met a multi- tude ,of the people of the country, who were his leigf*]ors, and who havingiearq of the sad cala- mity,. were coming to offer condolence. When he made known to tim his desire in regard to Mach- pelah, they repied, "Hear us, my lord, thou art a mighty prince among* us, In the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher, that thou mayest bury thy dead."  "(I ask not," said Abraham, "for any place ex- cept. Machpelah, and, if you will intreat prince Ephron for me, that he will sell it to me, I will pur- chase it as a possession forever." A messenger was soon despatched, and it was not long until Ephron was in the presence of the illus- trious patriarch. No sooner had he arrived than in the hearing of all the people assembled, he said, i My lord, I will not sell ibee the field wherein is the cave of Machpelah, but in the presence of the sons of my people I will give t to thee forever as a place of sepulcher." X  :^ At this, Abraham bowed respectfully before all, and said, "If thou wilt give it, I pray thee hear me; I will   GLOOM AND GLADNESS.     140 give thee money for the field, and thou must take the price." :The: said Ephron, "The field is worth four hun- dred shekels of silver, but what is that between me and thee.

Abraham counted out the money, and haundsg it over, received from Ephron a, title to the fif: emp bracing the rocky grotto and the surrounding grove, to be his as a possession forever.4 All the preparations having beeh made for the funeral, the numerous servants of the house joined in procession with Abraham and Isaac, accomanied by the surrounding princes, and vast multitudes of people from all parts of the country, and Sarah was borne to her rocky tomb amid the lamentations of ad thousand voices. The last sad offices being paid to the dead, Abraham turned with his weeping Isaac, and walked trembling to his now desolate home, to wander awhile longer as a pilgrim and sojourner, and then after filling up his allotted time, to be laid by the side of 9e loved one in the rocky sepulcher until the resurrection morn. Sarah was now an inhabitant of heaven. Her earthly pilgrimage had ended, and she had taken up her abode among the spirits of the saints in light. The earthly taernacle was dissolved, but she had assumed a spiritual form, and glided among the shining ranks of angels and spirits glowing with a beauty and filled with a rapture unknown to any 10  HE ASTROLOGER OF CHALPEA.

That form divine, which only once she was. permitted to gaze upon when it was veiled in hu- tantij. now was ever before her in unveiled glory, Wucli mortal eye could not behold. She was in heaven, where she saw and heard and knew all that her heart had desired on earth, and as from her heavenly sphere she beheld her weeping companion and her beloved son, she rejoiced to know that in a ibWrtime both would join her in the communings of that better world. K;        '                   E   ICHAPTERE Xs   THE MESSAGE TO          UR. , IN the home of the patriarch all things' tore an aspect of loneliness. The wife and mother had been borne to her last resting place in the silent tomb. Her cheerful smile no longer lighted up the tents of Mamre, and her encouraging voice to father and son was no longer to be heard in this world. As Eden itself would have been a wilderness without woman as a companion for man, so Mamre"must be desole without a second princess to grace its dwellings, an rule over them as mistress of the household. While on an expedition to Damascus in Syria, Abraham had obtained a most valued servant by the name of Eliezer. From his fidelity and the great interest which he took in all things pertaining to the patriarchal household, he had long since been promoted to the office of steward, and to him be" longed the oversight of all the immense treasures of the' patriarch, as well as the control of all the servants and the affairs of the family in general. Isaac, the child of promise, had ripened into a proud and vigorous manhood, and the father desired, be- fore he should go home and be no more among the living, that his son should form a matrimonial 147     "8   TtHE ASTROLOGER OFI CHALDEA. connexio wFith some one of his kindred in that far off land from whence, at the Divine command, he had journeyed. He -desired not that any alliance should' be formed with the inhabitants of Canaan, or that any of his blood should flow through the veins: a nation whose wickedness manifested itself in pr:ering the worship of a dumb and senseless idol, to that of the one living and true God; and hence he was concerned to witness before his depar- ture from earth, an event which he knew would be fraught -with the most important consequences to a posterity which was destined to be numerous as the stars of heaven for multitude. Calling the faithful Eliezer into his presence, Wiing fully assured that he could be trusted with a matter of such great moment, and knowing that he was interested, not only in what pertained to the family, but in the perpetuation of the patriarchal religion which he embraced, he addressed him in the following oriental style: "Eliezer, my faithful servant, place thy hand under my thigh and swear by the Lord Jehovah of heaven and earth, that thou wilt not select a wife for my son Isaac from among the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land- we dwell, but -swear unto me that thou wilt go into my own country, Chaldea, and from among my kindred thou wilt make the choice'." "I will my Lord. Your commands shall be   THE MESSAGE TO UR.      149 obeyed; but perhaps the one I may select will not be willing to come  with me to this land.

"Nay, Eliezer, thou shalt never take my son thither.- The splendor of the cities of Chaldda, and the seductive arts of her priests and astrologers I fear would dazzle his eyes, corrupt his hati, and lead him from the worship of JehoVah. Whatever thou doest, take him not thither, I adjure thee." "By what light my lord, shall I be guided in my search for the one who is to be the wife of Isaac?"' "The Lord God, who took me from my father's house in'Ur, and from my native land, who spoke to me and promised me this land, confirming it by an oath, and thus, by two immutable things ii which it was impossible for him: to lie, hath ratified his covenant, will send before"thee' his aigel to guide thee in the way." "But if she come not, my lord, what thel?" "Thou shalt be free from thine oaths" '"All is well."  So saying he took the oath, and immediately went to work to make preparations for a departure. The, city of Nahor, Abraham's brother, was Ur, situated as we have already seen, between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris.  It lay in the midst of the plains of Aram, and  hence inSoeripture is called Padan Aram.   Mamre was four hundred miles dis- tent from this place, and between them were track,   160   THE ASTROLOGER- OF CHALDEA. less deserts and towering mountains. Eliezer took ten capels and several servants, with all things necessary for the journey, and departed. Various presents for the kinsnrn of Abraham, together with many and elaborately wrought jewels of finest gold for the fair- one, were all provided; and never was cavalca4 more richly freighted than the one wwhich was now leaiing the plains of Mamre for the land of Chaldea. The direction which the caravan was to take lay south-eastwardly, and the site of the doomed cities was in their route. On the evening of the first day the train descended the mountain which sklrted on the west and south the plain of Sodom, and as they cast their eyes upon the valley below, they saw stretching away for many miles, embracing the whole valley even up to the base of the mountain, a vast lake of dark, gloomy motionless waters. Eli- ezer had seen this valley before, when it was covered with rich Pastures and dotted with magnificent cities. With his master he had gazed upon it when the Jordan flawed midway through its living green, and the bright rippling waters sparkled in the sun- shine or reflected the milder, light of the moon and stars. But now, alas, the verdure and flowers and trees and' cities were gone, and from the surface of that dark, leaden, stagnant sea there was no light or beauty. Al was desolation. The sickening sun looked wan, as muffled in its vapors it cast its lurid   THE MESSAGE- TO UR.     161 glare at departing, like a broad eyes of wrath, upon its God-smitten waters. The bird of Paradise, which was wont to nestle in the bowers of this once garden of the Lord," had sought another home, and no living thing was seen to grow upon its banks, or move among the dark, overhanging, craggy cliffs, which frowned back the shadows of the sullen tide. Tide,-it had none: all was dead, motionless, as its rocky shores. All that remained of life was the small, half-deserted village of Zoar, on the side of the mountain which the camels were now descend- ing. Lot was still here with his daughters, all that was left of Sodom, to wonder at its unhappy fate, and drop the tear of sympathy upon its ashes. Farther down the mountain, and near to the wwter's edge rose an incrusted monument, dark and shape- less, like a beacon on some dangerous coast to warn of wreck and ruin. After gazing upon the sad sight, Eliezer turned in to the gate and was kindly received and entertained by his master's kinsman during the night. Early the next morning, before the sun had as- cended the mountain which rose up from the farther shore of the Dead Sea, the train was in motion, and following the coast in a southerly direction a short distance, it entered the wilderness, and thence ta- king an easterly direction, as pointed out by the angel guide, the company traveled on over the drift- ing sands and through the craggy defiles of Arabia   ijg  TTHE ASTROLOGER OF CHALPEA. ttresea. It was a long and tedious,journey, and the route was such, perhaps, as never had been tzveled before. An angel was their guide, how- Rar, and: we may readily presume that it was the pearest and most practicable route that could have ieen taken. How long they were in performing the journey, we know not, as sacred history is silent on the subject. Nor is it important that we "should know: suffice it to say, that at length the caravan descended a gorge of the mountain which they had crossed in their journey into the broad and fertile plains of Mesopotamia. The broads bright disc of an Assyrian sun, was partly concealed by the distant horizon as they came in sight of the long sought city. Its black square temple towering high above the city walls, on the summit of which perpetually burned the sa- cred fire, could be distinctly seen as if painted against the glowing sky. All nature wore an aspect of calmness and beauty-the grain, still in its early verdure, waved to the gentle air, while the meadows, thickly covered with luxuriant grass and enameled with flowers of every hue, were scattering richest perfumne on every breath that fanned them. The shades of evening were beginning slowly to creep down the sides of the Tyari and envelop the city of Nahor in that soft haze of twilight beauty, so pecu- liar to eastern climes. The hum of busy industry was dying away, the lowing herds were returning W  away   THE MESSAGE TO UR.      1531 leisurely to their homes,,and the maidens, as was the custom of olden time, were seen to sally forth gleefully with their pitchers from the massy gates, to draw water from the wells of the surrounding grottos. Directed by the angel, Eliezer drew up his train at one of these. wells, and dismounting, he com- manded all the camels to kneel in semi-circular form, with the servants at their side. This being done, he advanced a short distance and falling pros- trate upon the green sward, he exclaimed, " 0O, Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee send me good speed, and show kindness to my master, Abra- ham. Behold, I am here by the well of water, and the maidens of the city have come hither to draw water. Let it be, O Lord, that the one whom I shall ask to let down her pitcher and give me to drink, let the same be the chosen one whom thou hast selected for thy servant, Isaac. Then shall I know that thou hast shown kindness to my master." Scarcely had the venerable servant arisen to his feet ere a damsel approached.  "She was fair to look upon."  Fairest of the fair throng gathered there, her singular beauty of form and feature, at once ar- rested the attention of Eliezer. Her dark, lustrous eye, as she cast a glance at the stranger with his kneeling caravan, as the eye only can speak, com- municated to the soul of the faithful steward an intelligence not to be mistaken in regard to the visit.   164   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. As ,he drew the water and gracefully threw back her curls of glossy hair, which fell in dark ringlets over her face,'to poise the brimfull vessel on her shoulder, she hastened to bound away over the now star-lit path, back to the city. But she had not proceeded far until she was overtaken by the anxious Eliezer, who, addressing her in soft and gentle accents, said, "I pray thee give me to drink.' Turning round, Rebecca dropped her pitcher quickly upon her hand, and replied, "Drink, my lord." After Eliezer had done drinking, the kind and gentle damsel said, "I will draw water for thy camels, also, that they may drink." By this the servant was assured that the wife of Isaac stood be- fore him; and so overjoyed was he at the successful issue of his toilsome And responsible mission that he was silent while the beautiful damsel drew the water and filled the trough for the thirsty camels. Filled with admiration and wonder at what he wit- nessed, he knew notkwhat to say, or how to act, but bowing himself before the Lord, he gave thanks for the prosperity which had crowned his mission. Had he not been secretly conscious when he first gazed upon the fair face of the beautiful stranger, that she was the divinely appointed one he sought, her benevolence and hospitality would have at once wrought such a conviction in his mind. No soon r ,    THE MESSAGE TO UR.     155 had she performed her kind offices, which she did in an almost incredibly short space of time, than the liveried servant approached her and placedupon her arms two massive bracelets of fine gold, tlen shekels  in weight, and also presented herewith other jewels of the richest and most elaborate workmanship. Then addressing her, he said, " Whose daughter art thou, my fair one ?" "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, my lord." "Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge " "We have plenty of room, and an abuhdance for thy servants and camels."  So saying she departed for the city. At this Eliezer again prostrated himself, and said, "Blessed be the Lord God of my master, Abraham, who hath manifested his mercy and truth in lading me to the house of my master's kindred." Scarcely had he finished his prayer until he saw a young man running towards him at full speed. It was Laban, the brother of Rebecca, who had informed him of all she had seen and done. Approaching Eliezer he addressed him thus, "Come in thou blessed of the Lord, wherefore standest thou without. I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."  Soon ,:, the caravan entered the gates of the city, and giving the camels into the hands of the servants, Eliezer entered the palace of Bethuel, and it was-not long    156   THE ASTROLOGER OF CltALDEA, "il the -girdle and sandals were removed, and he and his company were invited to partake of the even: ing repast.

The father and son, being entirely satisfied that the whole arrangement was divinely superintended, nodded assent, but cast their eyes upon the mother and daughter. They were attentive observers of what- had been said. Rebecca hung upon her mother's neck in tears, and the, maternal bosom heaved twith wild emotion. fhey were silent, but it was the silence which, if it may not be construed as at absolute assent to the proposal, at least gave strong indications that the objections were not insuperable, at least so the ser- vant understood it; and blessing the Lord God of Abraham, he rose from the floor, and ordering his servantslt bring in the treasure, he poured at the feet of Rebecca the most costly jewels, drapery -aud robes, that wealth could purchase, at theb same time bestowing upon the mother an4 brother the richestpresents:. It was now growing late, and after partaking of the bountiful repast spread before him, they all retired to rest.

"We will call Rebecca and she shall answer for herself."             - So saying, she was soon in their presence, and when the mother with faltering voice asked her if she was willing to leave her father'S house and mother's care, for a distant land, never perhaps to look upon the faces of the loved ones at home again, she resolutely but with deep feeling replied, "Th4 Lord's will be done, I go to fulfil my destinmyn the land of promise." The mother's heart was touched ; and she embraced her only daughter and wept. It was a great sacrifice, equivalent almost to burying her from her sight forever; but she gave her up with a mother's blessing. Laban approached and taking her from the arms of her'weeling mother, shraced her and said, "Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands, of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. Go, my sister/"id the God of Abraham and Haran and Nahor go with thee."   *,  168    THE ASTROLOGER OF. OHALDEA. Soon all Was in readiness for the departure. The - servants of Abraham brought up the camels in front of the palace.'- One, richly caparisoned, was made to kneel, and the proudest and most beautiful of Chaldea's daughters was soon in the saddle. An. other, and her old maid servant, who had nursed her from her infancy, was mounted and by her side. Then Eliezer and the servants mounted their camels, and, waving a lat adieu, the gates of Ur were pas- sed and the cavalcade was on its way. As they passed the grotto and hastened over the plain, before the eye of Rebecca rose the scenes of her child- hood, never, perhapis, to be looked upon again. The tear came unbidden to her eyes and bedewed the silken lashes as she cast a last and lingering look upon the receding valley, upon whose peaceful bo- s  m rose dim in the distance the beloved city, her chlldhood's home. The walls, and tower with its :a perpetual fire ascending to the god of day, were all that she could distinguish, and it was not long until a turn in the gorge of the mountain forever obstruct- ed them  from her sight.  Wild summits rose on either side casting their shadows on her way, and anon shbe would come out*on an open space where she could behold, spread out before her, luxuriant plains with isles of foliage, and beyond, the distant mountains rising-up against the far off sky. Day after day passe and ever varying scen4t'resented themselves as she journeyed on, but in the midst of  .  z  , O.                b   THE MRSSA GE TO UR.  .   1 9 all the excitements by iWhich she was surrounded, the scenes and associations of home would crowd  W upon her thoughts and fill her mind with intense emotions.          /  Underi ordinary circumstancenothing could have induced Rebecca to have left/ler home and kindred for a land of strangers, and/to take to herself for a companion for life, one whom she had never seen. But the wonderful train of events connected with the visit of the venerable servant of Abraham, and the interest shown by that patriarch, whose know- ledge and piety were held in the highest esteemaby, -.11 the family as well as the priests and astrologers of Babylon, Nineveh and Ur, wove^around her a web of destiny from which she could not escape; and besides, she felt her heart strangely and won- derfully drawn out after the young stranger who sought her hand. She felt that she dare not resit the influence that was drawing her so powerfully,^ away from her father's care and mother's love, and from all the hallowed associations of her childhood's home. At times it seemed as if she had awakened from a dream, in which she had been carried away from home and friends to desert regions by some chieftain's band, but Phe had returned home and heard again, her mothbr's voice and joined in the innocent, glee of the city maidens; but alas, the surroundig desert, and dangerous defiles through which she was passing, would rouse her from her   I60    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. reverie and recall her actual condition, Often, after the fatigues of the day, had she wept herself to sleep e her tent, upon the faithful breast of .her childhood nurse; but 4n the midst of all she felt a calm and quiet resignation, and the promise of the great Je- hovah in relation to her future destiny would still the throbbings of her heart and chase her fears away. At length the cavalcade reaches the end of the desert and enters the southern borders of' Pales- tine. Isaac, filled with anxiety in regard to the result of the journey undertaken by Eliezer, and judging that it was about time for him to return, had come down from Mature to Lahai-roi, where there was a famous well. All travelers across the desert would stop-at this well for rest and refreshment, and Isaac, therefore, had taken up his abode here for the pur- pose of waiting the arrival of his father's servants from  Mesopotamia.  One evening, while he was walking out in the field which stretched down to- wards the desert, meditating upon the perils of the journey and the probabilities of success, he was awakened from his reverie by seeing in the distance a train of camels emerging from behind a cliff, on the side of the distant mountain. The l61iff was thickly studded with accacia trees, and he could only see the long necks of the camels, with. an occa- sional glimpse of their riders as a short tUrn in the mountafn path would reveal them to his} excited   T HE MESSAGE TO UR,     161 gaze. He saw enough to convince him that the long looked for train was coming, and soon would be in the plain. "Who is that, Eliezer, walking yonder in the field?" said Rebecca, as from the mountain path they saw in the distance a tall young man, of digni- fied mien, walking leisurely along, with arms folded as if in meditative mood.         ) ,That is my young master, Isaac. He waits ur coming." At this Rebecca threw her long thick veil over her face, entirely concealing her features, and the train hurried on. Soon the foot of- the mountain was reached, and they entered the pli. The sun was tinging the tops of the distant moun- tains with his parting beams, and bathing the valley in its golden light as the travelers approached, and when they reached the spot where Isaac stood they form a circle around him, and the camels kneel while Eliezer and the servants bow themselves -to the earth in obeisance to their young master. In few words Eliezer related the incidents of the jour- ney, and closed by introducing Rebecca, who stood veiled before him. Taking her by the hand, Isaac replaced her in the saddle, and mounting another camel himself, the party journeyed on towards Mamre. A fleet messenger from Lahai-roi had been dispatched to herald their approach, and when they arrived, which was about midnight,'the groves and "    -       m      '   ,161   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. tents of ia emre were .lltmined with a thousand lamps, and all the inhabitants were in readiness to receive the bridegroom and his bride. When Isaac approached with his lovely charge, the procession, wh'ih had come out to meet him with their torches, opened right and keft, and alighting from their cam- els, followedby the faithful Eliezer and Rebecca's servant, the welcome company pass into the tent of the departed mother, where the patriarch received, embraced, and kissed his daughter. Joy again had oome to Mamre, and every heart was filled with rapturous delight as Abraham, with his numerous friends, confederates, and family sat down to the sumptuous bydal feast. Just before the solemnization of the marriage, a servant entered the tent, and addressing Abraham, said, "My lord, an Arabian prince and his wife are without, who having traveled a long and weary jour-' ney, ask permission to tarry for the night." "Let the stranger be admitted. Abraham never turned away the stranger from his tent. His joy is too great now to hesitate in extending the rites of hospitality. Bid him come in,' Soon Was ushered into the tent a tall, dark Ara- bian chief, whose warlike dress and nodding plumes contrasted well with the simple yet beautiful habit of his dark-eyed companion, who entered, grace- hlay holditng the skirt of her flowing robe in f   THE MESSAGE TO CR      16? one hand, and with the other clung to the arm of her husband. Abraham welcomed the stranger to the hospitalities of his tent, and after partaking of refreshments with the numerous company assem- bled, they witnessed the marriage ceremonies. The chieftain gazed upon the imposing scene with an ab- sorbing interest, and when at its close the venerable patriarch pronounced the blessing of heaven upon Isaac and hi% blooming Chaldean bride, a tear might have been seen to steal from the dark lashes of the stranger's eye, and fall upon his slightly curled and tremulous lip, as he drew more closely his compan- ion to his side. Nl sooner was the ceremony over than the chieftain and his wife bo'Oid a graceful farewell, and notwithstanding the entreaties of Abraham to tarry for the remainder of the nigit, they silently withdrew, and mounting their Arabian horses were soon lost to sight in the woods that skirted the distant plain. Whence came andwhith- er went these mysterious strangers was often a mat- ter of wonder to the patriarch of Mamre. , .k.    CHAPTER XI. THE WILD MAN OF PROPHECY. ISHMAEL, the name given by the angel of the Lord to Hagar as the name of her child before he was born, hath much in its meaning. In the He- brew tongue it signifies "heard of -God," or "the Lord careth for him." When cast out from his father's house and sent with his mother, a fugitive abroad, and he was ready to perish in the bleak and barren deserts of Arabia, his sad, despairing, dying moan was heard and the angel of the covenant ap- peared and granted him relief, assuring his mother that the child which she had borne, and whose des- tiny had been so eventful, was to be the progenitor of a great nation. We live already seen that Hagar and Ishmael, after the wonderful interposition in their behalf, re- mained in the wilderness. Though she had intended to return to Egypt, and was shaping her course thitherward as well as she knew from the directions given her by Abraham, the appearance of the Lord to her and the announcement in regard to her son's destiny, determined her to remain in the desert and wait the openings of Providence, as the wonderful destiny of her only child should be unfolded. After 164  \   THE WILD MAN OF PROPHECY. -   165 emaining a short time at the fountain in the desert, earing to leave it lest they should again be lost in he dreary and desolate wastes around them, they spied in the distance a large cavalcade approaching. is the procession drew nearer they discovered by heir dress and movements that they were Arabs, he inhabitants of the desert and the original inheri- ors of the land. Soon the train arrived, at the ountain, and from the kneeling camels the Arab hief and his followers alighted to partake of the efreshing waters and refill their leathern bottles to  upply them on their journey. They were on their ray to the passes of the El Ghor, on the northern oast of the Arabian gulf, for the purpose of inter- epting travelers from Egypt to Canaan and Persia, nd of carrying on their depredations as fate or for- une might dictate. They were all armed with a  ow and spear, and wore a fierce and warlike express- ion. Rough as was their exterior, aid unknown as ras their language, the military dress and the mar- ial air of the company instead of filling young     J shmael with fear, inspired him with a wild delight, nd as he gazed upon the ostrich plumes and richly mbroidered dress of the chieftain, who smiled upon "m as he approached, he thought within himself     : iow desirable would be such a life. He was now hirteen years of age and a youth of wild and reek- ess daring. His mother was a dark but beautiful Sgyptian, and though not so dark ts her, yet he had i  .   166    WE AsTROLOQGBR OF CHALDb;A. her black and piceing eye and symmetrical form added to bold manly features for a youth of his age. The chief of the tribe was at once interested in the boy, and handing him a bow and quiver, as if to as- certain whether he knew their use, he soon found the boy was at home in the sports of the field. When the company were ready for departure, the chief addressed the -mother by signs, to know if she would consent to suffer the: lad to accompany them. From, the interest which she saw Ishmael took in the strangers, and regarding it as providential, she consented on condition that they would take her aloDg.. To this the chief assented, and soon mother and boy, afterl having partaken of some dates and wine, were mounted on fleet dromedaries, and the caravan was under way to its place of destination. The tribe was one of the most desperate that oo. cupisd the wilderness of Sin, and had its strong holds in the fastnesses of the mountains of Horeb and Sinai. Many a earavan of merchants had been attacked by the proud bhief who always led on his band in person, and was plundered of its treasures after the conquest. After traveling hard all day at length night came on, and they pitched their tents for refreshment and rest, What time the chief had to spare from the command of his tribe he spent with his young favorite and lhis mother, and showed them every- kindness of which an Arab is capable. On. one occasion, after the journey of the day   TBHR WILD MAN OF PROPHSECY4,.  16 had ended and Hagar and Ishmtel were alone in their tent, the latter busily engaged in stringing his bow: and the former loit in meditation, the mother commenced unconsciously singing one of her child. hood songs, for her mind in brooding over its vcrious fortunes had wandered back to its Egyptian home. It was in the Egyptian tongue, and scarcely had She finished one strain ere the chief entered -in great haste, and addressing her in Egyptian, asked her if she could speak that language. To this of course she responded in the affirmative, as it was her mother tongue. Soon, to the astonishment of young Ish- % mael, his mother and the chief were engaged in a rapid conversation. When the-chief was but a mere boy he was along with his father's tribe, and while engaged in a conflict with Egyptians he: was taken. prisoner, and remained in this condition until he be- came acquainted with the language. He was finally liberated on Condition that he would remain' in- Egypt and serve the king, to which he assentedl But he sighed for his wild mountain home in the wilderness and the inspiring scenes of his boyh9od, and being unwilling to remain, though a bright ca- reer spread out before him, he made his escape and returned to. the land of his nativity.

As the reseiltofl tins   i68    Hus AMTRULOGEbR OF CHAPIEA. interview the chief adopted Ishmael as his son, and immediately commenced teaching him the Arabic language, manners, and customs, with an interest he had never known before. Day after day the powerful tribe urged their way over the now rough and rocky road. They had left the sands and were among the continuous precipices and defiles of Arabia Petraea. At length they came to the terrible pass of which we have spoken. It was , gloomy defile, and seemed once to have been the bed of a mountain torrent. At the entrance of the chasm between the mountains which rose up peredieularly five hundred feet in height, was a grove of cypress and accacia trees, which cast a deep shade from the sides, and projected over as if guard- ing the entrance to the valley of the shadow of death itself Wild fig and oleander trees grew out of the craggy' sides of the mountain gorge throughout its entire length. Masses of rock of enormous magni- tude seemed to have been thrown together by some wild convulsion of nature, forming as it were step- ping stones for a race of giants, on both sides of which towering crags overhung the abyss, which at some places nearly uniting overhead would shut out the light of day, throwing a gloomy grandeur over the scene below. Not far from the enttrance of this frightful pass was a huge cavern which spread away into the darkness, in the recesses of which were many apartments. The burning sun of the desert   THE WILD MAN OF PROPBACY.    169      E penetrated not the depths of this wild mountain      cavern, and its refreshing coolness invited the weary traveler to repose. Every apartment was known to the chief and his men, as it had been the fortress and hiding place of the Sinaitic tribe from an early day. The innermost apartment which was occupied by the chief was soon lighted up by lamps suspended from the sides and ceiling. Into this apartment Hagar and Ishmael were introduced. The tribe, which was numerous, was divided into companies and sought their respective apartments in the spa- cious cavern. The camels were unladened of their treasures, consisting of fine -linen from Egypt, silks  and spices from Ispahan and Arabia Felix, and precious jewels from Hydramant. They had also brought with them a bountiful supply of figs, dates, and dried grapes, with wine, and palm and olive oil. This wandering tribe carried every thing with them ,necessary to afford them the most sumptuous living. Their tents, for which they had now no use either to screen them from the scorching rays of the sun by day or the drenching dews by night, were spread upon the rocky floors of their apartments, which being covered with the skins of Cashmere, made an inviting repose for the weary. Here, day after day as the chief would converse with his adopted son, through his mother, the time passed pleasantly away. Ishmael was becoming rapidly acquainted with the Arabic language, and *q   1 70a  TOC ASTROLOGER OF CHWA-1PBA was soon able to hear and answer questions asaed him by members of the tribe, -among all of lwhom he was becoming a great .favorite. From shis re- treat? he would; frequently sally forth with. his bow on a huntiag excursion, with: some trusty Arab, among the mountain fastnesses, and his skill as an archer wa fen demtonstrated as a wild goat or a mountain roe1 would become the victim of his steady aim. On other occasions he. would astonish the whole tribe by t precision with which he would throw the dart, often bearing off tlipalm- from all competitors. Frequently tha boy, unknown to his mother and the chief, las if impatient of restraint, would start off unattended and ente:rl/pon all the exciting scenes of the chase. +'n one -oocasion the whole tribe was alarmed at the apprehensioni that he was slaim by wild beasts or killed by falling over some precipice, or perhaps taken by some warlike tribe, upon wh'ich, in his wanderings, he had fallen. Night had come and darkness reigned around. The El Ghor was covered with midnight gloom, but still he came not. Couriers were ;ispatched in every direction. The mother's heart "i'"1 within her, and when morning came bringing no tidings :f the lost boy, she would have yielded to despair had. she not recollected the promise of the Divine Being in regard to, the destiny of herison. Another: band was dispatched, consist- ing of twelve; They were divided into four com- panies and were, to go out; three east,. three west, ".j . *    It   lTH  WILD 'MAN oF PROPHECYr*  171  three north, and three south, and enjoined not to re-  . ;urn until some tidings of Ishmael could be heard, )r some clue by which he could be found. Day after day passed away, but they came not. Another band was started and another day of anxiety passed, but alas, no tidings greeted the ears of the watchers. lust as they wer4e about again to retire for the night, having given up all hopes of receiving any intelli- gence from the lost, the loud blast of a trumpet was * heard echoing along the mountains and wiang       i through the El Ghor. Thgi fearful suspense was broken. The lost was found; but whether the fear- less boy was living or dead none but the returning messengers could tell!- The lMasts became louder ind -more frequent as the, detachmenr:teared the cavern. The chief and Hagar hastened down to the-    e ,ntrane.-of the: pass, and soon in the light of the  torches which illuinied the valley, they beheld mounted on the .foremost steed-a fleet Arabian oourser--their idol boy: Though he was daring and reckless he had a kind and generous heart, and-seeing his mother he bounded from his saddle and was caught in her arms. Dipatchfstwere sent in the other directions with trumpets to-reoall the messen- gers. "Where have you been, Ishmael, my son?" ex-. claimed the overjoyed mother. "I was taken, while hunting in the valley, by a wandering tribe, and carried to Ezion Geber:" s                   ,'-   172   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. "Did they treat thee kindly, my son?" "Kindly, my mother, and gave me that beautiful Arab courser and many other presents, among which was this sword," which he drew at the same time from} its scabbard by his side, the jewels of whose hilt glittered in the light of the 'torches by which he was surrounded. "Did they wish you to stay with them?" "They took me to their castle and showed me all its ;eautiful things, and told me if I would become one of their tribe I should be the son of their chief, Abdul-foi. But I told them I was the son of a mighty chief already. 'Ah, but,' said they, 'thou art our prisoner, andsthan never return to thy father, nor see thy mother more.'" "How didst thou es'cape from the castle?" "One night when all were lost in mirth and wine, I mounted my steed, smote down the sentinel, pass- ed the gate, and bounded like a deer into the desert. After traveling all night, just as the sun was breaking over the distant mountains, I beheld in the distance-a tent on the plain,- above which waved the flag of our tribe,iand soon Hwas with my friends and on my homeward journey." God be praised, my son; for thy deliverance." So saying, the assembled group repaired to the cavern, and there was joy and rejoicing, for he who had been mourned as dead was alive again, and he who had been lost was found.   THE WILD MAN .OF PROPHECY.,   173 The next day all the remaining parties that had been sent out fi search of Ishmael returned to the cavern, and day after day passed away without any event occurring to disturb the quiet of the. Arabs. They were evidently, however, becoming tired of waiting for spoils, and their wandering habits were such that they could not remain much longer in that position. The highest happiness of the tribe con- sisted in the excitement of an attack upon their warlike neighbors or the armed caravans of::er- chants ladened with treasures going to or returning from the distant east. They were growing impatient and restless, and having exhausted almost every ex- pedient to keep up that wild excitement suited to their warlike and wandering natures, many became anxious to leave the pass and start upon some fresh enterprize. Long since, they learned from a cap- tive, that on the shore of the Mediterranean sea there was a fortified town abounding in treasures re- ceived from the distant west, and from thence trans- ported across the country to the east, and it had often occurre:; to them that depredations could with ease be committed upon the caravans that would amply repay them for the undertakng. Encouraged, however, by their chief, in whom they had the most unlimited confidence, they concluded. to content themselves with their present position. At length the long looked for period arrived. A sentinel at the western extremity of the Ghor, de-    1 74   THE ASTROLOER OF CHALDAA. stried approaching an immense caravan from Egypt, laden with precious commodities ]for the distant east, and he hastened with rapid pace to make known the approach of the travelers to the chief of the tribe. Soon all was astir with excitement, and every preparation was made for an attack. Once within theedark pass, the Egyptians, however numerous or well armed, must fall a prey to the warlike Arab,  who0till and desperate hardihood were -*ore than a match for the most thoroughly armed and power- ful caravan.?A-t length the tramp of the camels' feet was heard resounding along the defile and echoing through the eaverns of the El Ghor. It was, as we have already seen, a frightful pass and always attended with danger; forming as it did the nearest route to the east, by many miles, it was invariably chosen when the caravans of merchantmen were sufficiently numerous and armed for security and defense. Could they but succeed in getting safely beyond this boundary into the open desert they had but little to fear, as the means of dekf, in#te opportunities odte'apeMom their wild Arab* ne- mies, were suchtasio. insipU r them with confidencee in the success of their journey.

What were left unslain were B:!ound  and taken prisoners into the spacious cavern, to be exchanged for Arab prisoners in Egypt. The camels were secured, and with the treasures they bore were taken into the cavern also, where they were unla- dened of their spoils. The dead were borne off to dark and dangerous defiles, where they were cast down and left to moulder in the winds and rains of heaven, and in a few hours the pass was cleared of all, and no sign was left of the deadly affray save the dark spots, with occasional pools of -blood, with ! which the "rocky pavement of the pass was discol- ored..

His hand was to know no peace and his heart was to be nerved with a hostility that should last as long ase, lived, and when its fitful impulses should be still in death, through all his descendants, to the latest generation, that inborn hostility should con- tinue as long as nation should lift up sword against nation. The first lesson he received from his mother in childhood, as he hung upon her breast and drank in the bewildering light of her dark eye and the in- spiring tones of her rich voice, was that of the mysterious prophecy which betokened his fortune and sealed his fate. He knew enough to know that he wasimmortal till his destiny on earth was fulfilled, and that as a child of 'prophecy nothingotldavert that destiny.                -  In the midst of :the dqadly, conflict Ihmaei w'as by the side of therArab chief, his adopted father, and with a strong and Oexterous hand, dealt merci- less blows upon the armed merchantmen and their servants.

Many fell beneath the sword and spear of that young warrior.     * i        '               A   EaB WILD MAN OF PROPIECY.    1" , - As the young hero was rushing upon an Egyptian prince who wa cuiting his way bravely through the Arab band, with his daughter by his side---a slender but graceful and beautiful Egyptian whose' dark eye gleamed with the fire of woman's valor, and who seemed to be inspired with a super-human strength and fortitude as she smote off with her glittering sword the handt that had aimed a deadly thrust at her father-he saw,-as the eye of the prince met his, something that, quick as thought, tr I  his attention and as suddenly determined hitinon saving his. life and that of his daughter. A word from the:yjoung chieftain arrested the arm of a swar- thy Arab who was just in the act of thrusting through with a dart the heroic princess, Just then a shout, which rose above the din of battle, was heard from the chief of the tribe announ- cing the cessation of hostilities and the achievement of a victory, and Ishmael led the prince and his daughter, into the eavern and introduced theI othe h apart Ba  lis father.    .

He had grown up under peculiar circum0tances, and thresad history of the past-kept vividly before him by the hardfortunes of mhis mother, the only being on earth that he loved, had soured his nature and steeledhis heart against man- kind. There was a adness in his eye, a frown upon his brow, and a scorn upon his lip which ser- ved as the index of his :ealt But the eye lost its wildnegs, and the frown and4:scorn were succeeded by; ' stile which overspfeal, his features, even as tiiright sunlight falls upon the landscape after the storm-cloud has passed away.  Among the maidens of Mamre or Beer-Sheba he had seen none ihose gracefulness of form and beauty of person cQgtld vie with the lovely being now before him. Her brave and heroic bearing in the deadly strife, when she seemed like an angel life-guard to her father, inspired him,.as' he gazed upon her in the conflict, with a reverence; but now that he saw her utnard and gentle as a lamb, with downcast eyes whose long dark silken lashes veiled th ght and fire, he felt an interest in her which, to him, was strange and inilpticabe j No excitement of the chase, or that produced by ;e storm of battle, was half so deep and tumnilfl s as that which he felt rising within him.  Ai  Soon the Arab chief eintetd, and, as we have be- re seen, being acquainted with the Egyptian tghue, he and the merchant prince were engaged ;    THEi WILD MAN' O PROPHECY.   179 in a conversation which was had in an under toneu and lasted for some hours. In the midst of the con- versation;, however, the company were served with  a most bountiful and rich repast. In all parts of the cavern lights were gleaming from a hundred lamps, in the glare of which could be seen groups of warriors feasting, while around them scattered here and there in thick profusion, were bales composed tof the richest products of Egypt's proud capitall In:dark redesses, mind  to the rocky walls, could be seen the prisoners dho had been taken in the conflict. About midnight a council of the sub-chiefs was called in the apartment of the head chief, and while they are engaged in consutltation in regard to the prisoners and the spoils of war, we will take another look at the;group in another apartment, immediately adjoining the one occupied ly the council. Ishmael had been called with the rest, but just as he is leav-  ing he received a soft but imploring look'from the young princess whio- thrilled him through his entire being. It was with great relietance he left, but duty called and he must abey.

Ishmael had never seen the sacred river of Egypt.

The signet is presented, and in due ltime the officers of the army with the magicians ad priests, are called in council witi the king.  llthe Arab chief relates the circumstances connected with the capture of the merchantmen and their seryvnts, and details the purport of his mission to the court of Egypt, whereupon, the king, accord- ing to- the laws olithe land, accepted the proposals -a agreed to exchange prisoners, Arab for Egyp- 'itl -,?according to the number of captives.

It was    n  ot to be wondered that the dazzling splendors of the Egyptian court, the magnificence of the palaces,  and the great and princely gifts proffered by the proud king of Egypt, together with the increasingly   strong attachment which he felt in his heart for the   young and lovely Egyptian princess, who, with her father, he had rescued from Arab violece, came,  with overwhelming power upon his young, impul-     ' sive, and aspiring nature, and seemed for awhile as though it would change the whole current of his    i destiny. But it was only for a moment his nature had to struggle with the temptation. His wild prophetic life rose up before m hiand gained-the mastery, while the splendors of Egypt and. the .,  glory of its kingdom faded away in the brighter vision of scenes more congenial to his at re: m. ^? desert home.  Respectfully bowing before the king he declined   i his generous proposals; and asked but one boon at his hands. He was willing that the Arab prisoners might remain in bondage and continue to toil in the - mines of the 'emerald mountains where they were confined, if th0e king would only bestow upon him for a wife the princess, whom he had rest'red to liberty. He well knew that his love forthebeauti-  . ful maiden  as aturned by an affection pun and- ardent as heriature, all the deep impassoned afieo- tions of whichl were excited in his behalf.

Father, motlh ( er, home, kindred, wealth, distinction, were all to her as the evanescent Vapor exhaled by the sun from the watersof the sacred river when compared with the joy and rapture which filled her whole being when the light of his eyes were upon lhe and the uasic of his voice thrilled her soul. There was, however, an impassable barrier to their union. Belonging as she did to the royal and sacerdotal line, none but those of her country and caste couit hope-to gain her hand in marriage, and so widely separated was her- family from the sur- rounding nations, that only an honorary relation -eould be bestowed upon foreigners, ard that only upon such as had obtained distinction in astrological tljr$. To ditch attainments he could lay no elaim, and hence the cup of bliss which he had but tasted was about to be rudely dashed forever from his lips. While the king and court were consulting upon the proposal of Ishmael, a venerable man among the magi arose, and advancing to the throne, said, ' O king, live forever. Is not this Egyptian the son of the great Abram, chief of all the- astrologers of B a  , and Nineveh', and has n6t the great Un- knownnaisde him a priest in Mamre, and did he not, ,whiW residing i-,this palace, reeivye ouramost sa-- ered mysteries and engage in our mo't solemn rites in theI templ tf hthe Sun?" ;;   IBYTIAN MYSTERIES.     i "Let the imaster of records search the chamber of rolls," said the king, "and if thy wordsaae true*, then may the Arab chief be initiated in the most t. holy mysteries of our temple, and the desire of his heart shall be gratified--the young and beautiful Mirza shall be his companion forever, The vouchers were in due time obtained, and the record not only showed the fact, but set forth thaft no astrologer could be found in the world like to the Archimagus of Babylon. The king commanded that Ishmael should be initiated&at sight, and ordered that he should a- once be prepared-fo: nidaction to all the sublime mysteries of the temple of the Sun. The day at length arrived for the celebration of the sacred rites. The Arab chief had passed through  all the preparatory scenes connected with the initia- I tion, and accompanied by the master of ceremonys, j into whose hands he was placed, and to whose 'idance he was given, -he repaired to. the temple rfhich was at some distance from the capital. An avenue of gigartic monsters guarded the way to a huge iron gate, over the arch of which was inscribed in mysterious characters, "None buf the free born, the good, and the brave, admitted here." The k-nock of the overseer of the outer gate is responde4"by a similar one within, but in a low sepulchral sound   : that startled Is hmel with its strangeness.

The lofty arches resound with the tread of their advancing footsteps. The caverns of the Ghor were light-and beautiful as Eden when compared witti this gloomy pass. After proceeding a short distance in silence, the guide told Ishmael to stop and remain still for a few moments, and fear no evil. The command was unnecessary, for he seemed to have been placed immovably, and as it were, enchaiued in the-;depth of a gloom and obscu- rity profoduati;as ancient night. He remained not long in this position until dim in the distance taint flashes of light break for a moment the darkness which surrounded him, revealing fresh horrors to his excited mind. By these transient flashes he clAght glimpses of monstrous phantoms and awful specters. He also heard near him the frightful hiss of serpents, and the dismal howl of wild beasts, which were repeated and prolonged in the distance by the reverberations of the hollow arches. Anon an interval of silence would come, which, instead'of a relief, awakened such bverpowering,awful emotions in his- mind, that a slight rustling, or even an agree- able bound, made him shudder. Far in the distance at length he saw a revolving light, and his guide approaching speaking words of comfort and courage, they .march on with measured,-tread." As they ad- vart the light increases so as to make the objets ft   RGYTIAN SYSTMKIES.   u   o on either side visible. A change comes over the aspect of the place, and its decorations, thImarble  floor on which he walks trembles, and he s:eems to ' : be raised up to a great height and then again sunk down into a profound abyss. Instantly he felt him- self drawn rapidly along, and though-uniable-to dis- cover the impulse or attraction, yet he was constrain- ed to obey the mysterious power which urged him  Before his eyes, while gazing upon them, the pictures and marble sculptures which' decorated the sides, became animated, beautiful images seemed to shed tears, unwieldy and colossal statues -moved and walked and uttered harmonious sounds.

Phantoms bearing a perfect resem- blUne to beings from whom he had long been sepa- rated and for whom he had a strong attachment, flitted before him and shrunk from the embrace which they appeared to seek. :In the midst of these exciting scenes an awful peal of thunder shook the foundations of the gloomy passage, and all again was darkness. When the dreadful sound died away, there rose upon the still air a voice soft and calm as that of an angel.

'o thi he resiponde:in the affirmative, Then the ,uwiknoe:. again addressing him in kind and gentle t gpne t i i e midst of the darkness, asked him what he most desired. Just then, and before he had time toreply, a burst of light above the brightness of the 1 sun filled tie whole passage, illuminating as with a blaze of day, every recess. Around him were ob- lacts of surpassing beauty, while before him, at an 1eimense distance, were enchanted gardens and pa- laces, the beauty and magnificence of which excelled all that heihad ever seen or imagined before.

The nobility and beauty and pride of Egypt's proud capital were gath- ered there; but among all the gathered throng there were none fiof more noble bearing than the Arab chieftain, with his dark dress and nodding plumes Ad golden signet, nor any more beautiful than his all slender, graceful, and happy bride. Upon them all eyes were fastened as they approached the altar, and when they took each other's hand as a signal of the union otf destiny forever, there was s universal applause which resounded through the palace, and when it ceased, soft strains of "Music arose with voluptuous swell." nd king and nobles, magicians, astrologers, priests, princes, and princesses, alike partook of the general joy. Never was marriage attended with greater demonstrations of happiness than was witnessed on that occasion. The morning after the bridal ceremony, the chief with hi$ wife, attended by their servants, left the palace and started out on their journey in the direc- tion of their wild mountain home, promising to return again at no distant day, the one to perfect himself MiX a knowledge of the higher mysteries of the tem- ple, and the other to revisit the home and friends of * ?ifyouth. We will not detain the reader by a   EOYTIAN MYSxh1tlSc     t193 . recital of the events of the journey homewar4 Suffice it to say, that in due time the party entered the Ghor, and Ishmael and his wife were embrace$  by the chief and the mother, while the whole tribe united in demonstrations of joy. Months roll away, and one scene of festivity fol- lowed another in the cavern. The immense spoil taken from the- merchant princes was sufficient ' support the whole tribe in the most luxurious living for years, and, no longer impelled by necessity, the chief felt disposed to give himself up to a season of rest and enjoyment. The young chief and his bride passed the time most pleasantly, and both engaged heartily in the study of Arabic. Frequently did they mount their steeds at thetearly dawh and sally forth along the coasts of the Red sea, and amoin its grand and beautiful scenery would they pai hours and sometimes whole days. Being on the western arm of the Red sea, they could descry over the bosom of its blue and beauti- ful waters, the rocky shore of Mirza's native land. Here and there grew in wild luxuriance among the . cliffs that lined the eastern shore, the oleander with its beautiful flowers. Beds of white coral sparkled amid the waters, and birds of bright plumage dipped their wings in the wave. On the east was:a wide ocean of sand, stretching to the Elanitic gBilt with here and there an oasis, which resembled small  : islands covered' with palr.

Indeed, night is the most--proper season to travel in Asia, especially in those parts of it which liea-ear the equator.

No time was to-be lost, and Ishmael startin"g at full speed, followed by Mirza, was soon face to face with the enemy. With his strong arm he smote down his foe, and they passed the line, and in a short time were beyond the reach of their pursuers. After a rapid ride of many hours they arrived in safety at the cavern, and were once more with their friends. Having made all the preparations necessary for - the journey to Sinai, Ishmael and his wife started with a strong guard. Passing along the coast to thhat point where they entered the desert, they at length arrive at th6 spot. After a few hobrs travel they came to the pass of Wadey Sheikh; On tje right the mountains rose gracefully and majestiashy and a th6 perpendicutl pealks wore tinted with ahn Qtpur-   e 1   - THE ASTROLOGIR OF OHALDEA. ped tosy hueby the descending beams of the even- ing sun. Mountains of less magnitude were around, frowning in rugged majesty. These were the group of Gebel Serbal. Having passed through this Wa- dey, another was entered of a more deep and gloomy aspect.

On both sides of the pass, like that of the Ghor, the moun- tainSO:hung over -and seemed to meet, and toppling stand as iffj bteath would bring them thundering 'down inio the chasm below. In the middle of the pass was a huge cavern entered by a very narrow secret way, and known only to the Sinaitic tribe. It was kept from the observation of travelers by having the entrance entirely closed by a huge rocky misshapen door, which would roll back on its con- cealed iron hinges. Here the party halted for re- freshment and rest. Resuming:their journey, in a few hours of some- what difficult traveling, they entered the plain E1 ?Raha, in the center of which rose up in gloomy grandeur before them the mountain of Sinai. Scat- tedk here and there over the plain, were masses of rock which seemed to have been torn by some con- vulsion from e summit of the mountain.

Soon they leVaa the gorge, and the beetling crags" are above them, and clefts and caverns all around them. Steeper and steeper becomes the ascent, and finally their path lay between impending masses of vast magnitude, ter- mingatng above, and still farther on, by two arched gateways, the latter of which introduced them to a plain, covered with towering cypress -trees. "But they had scarcely entered upon their toilsome jour- ney. Above and beyond were sharp hanging rocks, clefts, and caverns leading the way up to the tower- ing summit. At length, after incredible exertion, it is gained, and there on the narrow peak the vast region of mountain scenery spread out in terrific grandeur around them. On every side, as far as the eye could reach, the white rocks and sands of Ara- bia Petraea glistened in the sun, while far to the southwest the blue waves of the Arabian sea seemed to mingle with the distant sky. Neither had ever beheld such grandeur and sublimity before, and, inspired with the scene, they prostrated themselves -: in adoration before the great God of heaven,.

At length having arrived at home they gave   1T8   ' He ASTRaoWGB4 OF CHAwPEA. themselves up to quietness and study, occasionally partaking of the scenes of excitement and amuse- ment around them. Once, in company with his wife and a detachment of Arabs, being desirous of revisiting the oasis in the desert and again beholding the spot where he was saved from death by the angel, and where the tribe found him and his mother, Ishmael started out into the vast Arabian desert. The oasis lay on the borders contiguous to the land of Canaan, but the desert must be crossed to reach it; and as numerous warlike tribes infested it in various parts, it was necessary that he should be prepared for defense, though in the main there was a common brother- hood subsisting among the Arabs, yet, when they could not plunder, they would attack each, other, and the conquerors would take the spoil, but with as little loss of life as possible and without taking any prisoner -- It was wliie-on this excursion that Ishmael saw !tin his solitrry ramble in the afternoon of a sultry 4 4, not far from the oasis where his company was liantpea: a caravan in the distance crossing over to the desert of Peersheba in the direction of Lahai- roi.

Through the force of its arms, tribe after tribe joined its standard, its castles and, fortifica- tions became so numerous and powerful, especially in Rooley Arabia, that it was only by the payment of heavy tribute effected through the negotiations of shhmael with Egypt and Persia, that caravans were allowed to pass through the country. By this means the Arab Chieftains became not only strong and powerful but vastly opulent. Ishmael hoa become a mighty chief, and at the #eath of his adopted father succeeded to the highest ?ak in the tribe.  He had,in the mean time red,'gypt, and in due order had received s: al he mysterious rites of the temple, thereby form- ing an enduring alliance with the astrologers, priests, az4 magicians of that nation, which lasted to theaed Xfhis eventful life. He had 'built for hims'f i, magnificent castle among the rocks, and there, 'hen free from the toils of war, he spent his 200 kt *1   DEATH OF ABRAHAMA.     201 time in the bosom of his family. The promise of Jehovah made to his mother when she was an outcast from Mamre, and before he was born, had in part been fufilled. The joyous shott of children met his ears as he ascended to his mansion, and in them he beheld a generation which was to succeed him, numerous as the stars of heaven, unconquer- able as the sirocco that swept the desert, and irresistable as the whirlwind that rent the mr- tains. For their future fate he could have!;no anxiety. -His faith in the Divine promise, already so wonderfully fulfilled, assured him that they like himself, were children of a destiny that no earthly power could set aside. Hagar's eventful life was drawing to a close, but up to the latest hour did she watch with a mother's care over the training of her descendants, shaping their young and tender minds for that great drama of hupan life in which they were to be principal actors. Each of the sons of Ishmael was to become the head of a nation, and their descendants were tof occupy the land until the end of time. a Desiring, as she did, to close her J at tdt 1: * fountain where Jehovah had appeared to her, and where the life of Ishmael was so wonderfully pre- ?, , served, she was accompanied by thl chieftain, his wife, and their children, with a dtachrient of Arabs, who, by short and easy passages bore her aeross the desert to the wilderness of Paran. Here   202   imTHE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. a tent was pitched for Hagar and the family, and every attention that filial kindness could bestow, was,^Vyen to soothe and comfort the weary mother in her last hours. Day after day she partook of, the reviving waters, but she continued to decline, and grew weaker and weaker Until the hour of dissolution approached, when she sank as sinks the evening sun in the unbeclouded skies of Araby. /ery voice was hushed in the tent of afltiction, as!softly and silently the last sleep stole over her senses. Affection could not stay her, or the sweet voice of her daughter would have arrested the spirit in iis' flight as she breathed gently into her dying ear the accents of love. F:Prewell, thou wandering child of sorrow,-thou hast at last found an unbroken slumber. The God who saw thee and succored thee when an unbe- Mfended outcast alone in- the wilderness, has taken thee to himself, and in that better world where jealousies' are forgotten and rivalries are unknown, thou shalt dwell in peace forever. The 'days of mourning being ended, on the spot il(iereiony she fell when her beloved.--Ishmael was -supposed to be dying, her grave was made. 'Over this sacred spot Ishmael caused a temple to be erected, which he consecrated to the worship of his mlother's ::od. This place of hallowed memo- ries was afterwards'known by the name of Mecca, 'which in the Arab tongue, means a place of great   DEATH OF ABSRAAM.   -d  a 03 resort in consequence of the numerous pilgrimages made to it from all parts of Arabia. N?:deadly strife had ever occurred here, Hostile bands there met as friends and brothers, drank together of the waters, and reposed in its shade. Here, in after years, Mahomet the prophet, a descendant of Ish- mael, was born,-and here, after his long and bril- liant career, he was buried, while his tomb is yearly visited by innumerable pilgrims even 'iato the present day. But we must now   return- to Mamre,--to the family of Abraham. Sarah slept in quiet repose among the rocks and evergreens and flowers of the consecrated Machpelah, and Abraham had taken to himself other companions to comfort him iatthe wearisome journey of life. Isaac and Rebecca had been blessed of the Lord with children of wonder- ful promise and equally wonderful destiny. They had removed to the patriarchal possessions at Lahai- roi, and through the powerful influence of his father, Isaac had become a mighty prince in Pales- tine. He possessed a calm and quiet disposition, uniting the gentleness' of his mothe!thb the urbanity and self-possession of his father, and nothing afforded him greater happiness than to rule ' Ac over his own household and cultivate amity and peace with the surrounding princes. CuWhily the voice of his exiled brother was for war, and his very name was a terror to the dwellers in the desert *         ,   204  t THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. and all whho traversed its wastes, his was the voice of pea, and his friendly alliances embraced the entire Country. Abraham had also other sons born to him which in after years became heads of nations, -men of various destiny scattered abroad. In process of time his already extensive possessions became vastly enlarged, and the astrologer and exile from Chaldea became one of the mightiest prHes of the East. HEis pilgrimage, however, was about to close, and having done the errand of his destiny on earth, he was about to join his beloved in heaven. He had nad!ched the age of one hundred and seventy- ars, embracing a period of several genera- tion ;d after having witnessed more in the eventf history of his life than any who had pre- ceded: him, and having 'more involved in that history, so far as human destiny was concerned, than was ever before or since known to man, he made all due preparation for his departure from earth. That he might make that disposition of his estates, which to him seemed right and proper, he summoned his descendants to the paternal abode at Mamre. The proud heart of Ishmael the eldest and conse- quently the first-born of the patriarch, when through the intelligence of messengers, he learned? that his younger brother Isaac was to inherit the vast estates of his father, and he, with the remain*   P EAT OF ABRAHAM.     205 der of the sons, were only to receive gifts, refused to be present on the occasion, and sent o of his chief officers to inform his father that he needed not his gifts nor his protection, as God had given him the whole of Arabia, and if he choshe could make Palestine subject to his sway. The intelli- gence troubled the patriarch not a little, as he recollected how he had sent the mother and his boy fugitives -abroad in the desert, That all motives for an invasion of the territory of Isaac, whose pacific disposition would lead him to make any sacrifices for peace, might be removed out of the way, Abraham conceived the idea of sendintiis other sons into the distant East. AccoL  ; after having bestowed upon them princelf gjf according to their age, he pronounced uponthein his blessing and sent them away. He would gladly have looked upon the face of his son Ishmael again  before bidding adieu to the world, but from what he had learned of the Arab wildness of his disposi- tion, he entertained no hopes of ever beholding again his first born. Isaac was to him soow his only hope, and as the child of promise miractulously preserved, but not more so than Ishmael, the child of destiny, he was the consolation of his declining days. With all the tender solicitude of an affec-, tionate child, Isaac watched his declining hourn. Rebecca, also, the dutiful and affectionate Rebecca, never left the side of the dying patriarch. *.   V06    THE ASTROLOGER OF CH4ADA. On one of midnight's loneliest hours, when every voice Bs hushed knd all was still in Mamre, Isaac ?and Rebecca were watching with intense anxiety the lastflickering rays of life that gleamed from the sunken eyes of the patriarch as he lay stretched on the couch of death. He had given them his parting blessing and had turned away to breathe his last, as two strangers, a man and woman, dressed in Arab costume, entered the tent and walked softly to the side' of the couch. From their dress and manners, the former of which displayed a richness and 'legance, and the latter an ease and grace whriiare rarely met with, they evidently be- longe:i&o the higher caste of Arabian nobility. After gazing for a moment upon the unconscious patriarch, the Arabian turned to the weeping Isaac and said, "Does my father live?" A moment, and brother was in brother's embrace, and Rebecca and Mirza following the example, were locked fast in sisterly affection. The expressions of surprise and tenderness which occurred at that hiour,i however, passed not the dull cold ear of death. The patriarch had g6ne to the spirit world. It was not for him to gaze upon a scene which would have caused his heart to rejoice in the midst of affliction and death, but he had passed away to that world where nothing is hidden from the pure bright vision of the departed. Ce, 4         ** F^ , A   MEATH OF ABRAHA*.      207 When morning came, the sad news of death was borne in every direction. Every tent bre the traces of affliction and sorrow, and Mamre was clad in mourning as when the beloved S   hr died. Death, however, came not as he often comes, with angry brow and relentless arm, to smite down youth in all its flower of pride and loveliness. The rosy health of youth's soft cheek was not made to decay by his blighting touch as when the angel of death spread his wings over Sodom or the 6amp of the proud Assyrian, but like summer's softest sweetest sigh that shuts the rose, the spirit of Abrahi was wafted away when full of years and ripe for mneor- tality, to the home of the blest.   :^    % The days of mourning being ended, preparations were made for the funeral,-and to pay the last tribute of respect for the memory of the prince and patriarch of Mamre, the former friends and allies of Abraham assembled from all parts of the coun- try. Princes from Arabia, Astrologers and Magi from Egypt and Chaldea and Persia, came to the funeral. At length the solemn procession is in motion, and sad strains of music fill the air as the multitude wind through the grove in the direction of Machpelah. First in the train following the hearse are Isaac and Rebecca, then Ishmael and Mirza, with the numerous relatives of both families, and their children. Then followed the sons of Abraham by Keturah, and their wives and children, ;s^ ;    208    THE 18ATROLOGER OF CHATpEA. after which came the Astrologers, Magicians, and Priests tf different lands, and last of all the numer. ous servants of the patriarch. It was, a solemn sC'Pe, w7dt as the procession entered the rocky cemetery in the deep shade of which was the family vault which contained the ashes of the long departed Sarah, Isaac and Ishmael lifted up their voices and wept. The -vault being opened, and all things being in rea diness for depositing the relics in their lastfresting place on earth beside those of his beloved Sarah,?-the funeral chant began, which was followed by solemn and mysterious rites, when all that was earthly of him who led the, most : eve!" llife and exhibited the most remarkable faith, Saving obtained a name which has come down through all succeeding generations as the "friend of God" and the "father of the faithful," was committed to-dust. %lowly and sadly the procession returns, and the various companies which had assembled from various parts of. the land return to their respective homess, solemnly impressed with the scenes they had witnessed, realising that it was better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of mirth, and that by the sorrows of earth the heart is made better.

They met -when a. father's blessing rested alone;pon an idol chiM, upon whose destiny no evil star shed its baleful influence, and when the proud heart of the ill-fated Ishmael for a moment was tremulous with emotion, and then was filled with stern and settled rage, but not despair, for he too was a child of destiny, and wildly he went out to fulfil that destiny in the desert land. But now theylmeet again, not-that Ishmael may be excited to jealousy and revenge, for he is a prince thiong his equals, and needs neither patrimony nor favor from man. He had already cut his way through mountainous difficulties up to the highest point of earthly renown, and his name was known, honored, and feared, from the Euphrates to the Red sea, and from Sinai to the gates of Damascus. Through his swift-winged messengers he had kept himself ad- vised of the declining health of his father, and from time to time was apprised of his approaching dissolution, and he had of his own free will and accord come to see him die.   He was his father still, though he had sent him away from home and friends, and he had a generous heart as well as a daring hand. But he came too late to meet with recognition.

Prior, however, to the occupancy of this vast country, the descendants of Isaac were to pass through various fortunes- they were to be strangers in a trange land, where they were to be reduced to a state of vassalage, and groan for centuries under the yoke of cruel tyrants until the power of God should be magnified in their behalf, and they should be delivered rom bondage and enter upon their God given inheritance. Soon after the arrival of Isaac at Lahai-roi, or Beerseba, the grat Jehovah appeared to him while engg  in offeri g up the evening sacrifice, and said," o not d 4into Egypt; th in4hiB land which I  tell lheeot -Sojopurn in this land and I will be with thee and will bless thee, for unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these coun- tries, and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father, and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and I will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall All the nations of the earth be blessed." Twenty years had now passed away since the matiage of Isaac with Rebecea, and although to him .was the promise renewed and through him was a nation numerous as the stars of heaven for multi- tude to spring, yet he had no children. - It required a faith like to that which was exercised by his father in the divine promise, and although every - 4hing wore a gloomy aspet in regard to its fulfil-   THLE CHLD OF PRQM IS. 21 ment, still he staggered not at the promise which had in his own person been so: far o0ufirmed.. B him the fight of faith was manfully fought, and in fervent prayer and humble reliance upon Jehovah, whose wonderful interposition in the behalf of his father sustained him in the conflict, he believed " k on. At length the time came for its fulfilment, Rebecca became pregnaA but there were circum- stances connected with that delicate condition of a more painful character than usually fell to the lot of Oriental women. So extreme were her sensa- tions that she sought relief a the divine one, and in consulon received it 'startling intelli gence that she -should bee delivered of two children who should be the heads of two distinct powerful nations, and. ,that the contest in which they should engage for superiority had already begun ere yet they were born, as prophetic of their future history, and that in process of time the one first born should yield to the superior force and power of the dther.

After this event, Esau was called Edom from the nature of the pottage, as has already been re- marked.

This attachment increased until a period arrived in which an oppor- tunity Was afforded him of giving still stronger evidence, by granting the hand of his daughter, a ,? young and beautiful maiden, in marriage to the young-and noble hearted Esau.

Here in this city ot ock, as it was afterwards called and which name it tears to this day, ESau, With his lovely and beautiful wife and numerous warriors, took up his abode. In this mountain home he was visited by Ishmael and Mirza, and many were the happy days spent; in each others society. To render the. place still more desirable, Ishmael spt to Egypt for artificers in stone, and out of the mountain sides which rose up around them, were excavated a royal palace. To this were added other dwellings for the tribe, and tombs for the dead were constructed, as also a temple for the worship of Jehovah, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Ishmael, as well as Esau and Jacob.. So famous did the city-of Rock become, that in after years being visited by Pharaoh who had in his family become allied with the descendants of Esau #Zdom, the proud king of Egypt had a temple cut l o-if the rock, which bears his name and stands perfect to this day. Additional ornaments were made to grace the city, and among these were triumphal arches in commemoration of victories achieved by Esau and his warriors.   CHAPTER XIV.-OONTINUED. WHLE the king of Edom, for the country was now called by his name and he was every where hailed as its ruler, was engaged in extending and fortifying his territory by well disciplined warriors, a message came to him from Beersheba. It was from his father, who had now grown old, and who feeling the infirmities of age creeping upon him, realized his near approach to death. Before his departure from earth he was desirous of once more enjoying the presence of his first born, and impart- ing to him his dying blessing. Though Esau had a rough exterior he had nevertheless a kind and generous heart, and he could not but feel kindly towards his aged father. Accordingly, having made the necessary preparation, he started on his journey towards his childhood home. While on his way as he passed through the wilderness of Beersheba, where he had spent his boyhood days ii' the wild sports of the chase, the recollection of his brother's unkindness and the advantage he took of his necessities were brought to his mind with painful vividness. Notwithstanding he had been deprived of his birthright, yet, so wonderfully had he been prospered in his way, occupying as he did 1 5              225   " -' * ' ' ' ,  ' t2,6 THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. a position of power and influence vastly superior to his brother, that he had long since dismissed the thought, and had riot the scenes through which he was passing called up the recollection :of the event, he would not have allowed the act of Jacob to have disturbed his wonted tranquility of mind. At length he arrives at the oldw homestead, and the patriarch being apprised thereof, requested that he be brought immediately into his presence. He desired to receive him alone, and Rebecca the mother, aware of the intent for which he had sent for him, placed herself in a position where she could overhear all that was said. This she was enabled to do the more readily from the fact that Isaac, through age had become blind. No sooner had a servant announced his presence in the private chamber and departed, than the following conversa- tion:ensued: "Esau, my son.'" "Behold, here I am my father." "Behold, now that I am old, I know not the day of my death. Now, therefore, take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field and get me some venison and make me a savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat, that my soul may bless thee before I die." "I will, my father," and so saying, he departed. All this was communicated to Jacob by, his   THE CHLD OJF PROMSE.    2^1 mother, and being determined to thwart the ,pir- poses of Isaac and bring the blessing which he intended for Esau upon his idolized brother, she hit upon the following expedient, illustrative of her strong partiality as it was of the ever fruitful mind of woman: she directed Jacob to go to the field and kill two kids and dress them, bringing her the skins. When he returned she prepared the mess of savory meat, and taking the skins, she so cut and fitted them upon the hands and neck of Jacob as to make him resemble his brother; then taking the raiment which Esau had left in his haste when he departed from home in quest of his fortune in a strange land, she placed the savory mess in his hands and told him to go and give it to his father. When he appeared in the presence of the blind patriarch, he thus addressed him: "(My father!"  "Here am I, who art thou my son?" "I am Esau, thy first born; I'have-- done accord- ing as thou badest me; arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy, soul may bless me." "How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my sOll n?" "Because the Lord thy God brought it unto me." "Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee my son, whether thou art my very son  Esau or not." At this Jacob cautiously approached his father,   228  - THtE ASTRQLOGER OF CHALDEA. who an feeling his hands exclaimed, "the vpice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. Art thou my very son Esau?" "I am."' "Bring the venison near to me and I will eat of it that my soul may bless thee." "Jacob accordingly brought the dish and placed it near his father, at the same time giving him wine, which he drank. After he had finished the repast he called Jacob, still suppossing him to be Esau, and said, "Come near now and kiss me, my son."  Heapproached and kissed him, and smelling the odor of Esap's raiment with which the deceiver was clothed, he exclaimed, ' the smell of my son is the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed, therefore Jehovah give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine. Let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee, be lord over thy brethtep% and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee, i*sed is every one that curseth thee, and1blessed is every one that blesseth thee." Scarcely had the blessing -been pronounced and Jacob departed from the presence of his father, ere Esau returned from the hunt with the venison. Having prepared it he carried it to his father, and placing it before him, said, "Let my father arise and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless mse."   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.     22 9 "Who art thou?"             , "I am thy son, thy first-born Esau." , The fearful truth now flashed upon IsaI's mind that he had been deceived, and his whole frame shook with agonizing emotion. ,Who?" he exclaimed, "where is he thatc; hath taken venison and brought it to me and I have eaten before thou camest, and have blessed him, yea, and he shall be blessed." The words of the father fell with crushing weight upon the heart of Esau, and he cried out in the bitterness of his soul, "Bless me, even me also, O my father^l To this Isaac replied, "thy brother came with deceit and hath taken away my blessing." "Is he not," said, Esau, 'rightly named Jacob, for he hath supplanted me these two times; he took away my birthright, and behold now he hath taken away my blessing; but O my father hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?" m. :: "Alas, my son, I have miadx im thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to Ulm for servants, and with corn and wine have I sustained him, and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?" "Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me, also, O my father!"  These words were uttered with passionate earnest- ness, they were more than the patriarch could bear, and in the fullness of his heart he exclaimed, "Be-   230   THE ASTROLOGER OF CIIALDEA. hold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above, and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother, and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy  k. For the first act of Jacob by which he had taken advantage of the necessities of Esau he was for- given, but for this last act -Esau was too greatly incensed, and though he would not embitter the last days of his father by seeking revenge, yet, so soon as he was dead and the days of mourning for him were ended, he would slay him. Rebecca, fearing such a result, sent Jacob to her father's house in Assyria. Here he married two) wives, and remained for a period of twenty -years. Esau returned to: his home in Edom. Some; difficulties arising between Jacob and Laban, his father-in-law, he determined to leave Assyria with hisi wives and flocks and herds, and return to Canaan.-. He had been twenty years absent from his ivtie land, and now that he was on his return, the variousB scenes through which he had passed were vividly presented to his mind. The inhumanity and unrighteousness of his conduct in taking advantage of his brother's necessities, robbing him of his birthright, and his subsequent deception practised upon his blind old father by which he .deprived Esau of his blessing and secured  ,   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.     231 it for himself, came up before him, and associated as the recollection of his conduct was with the injustice perpetrated upon him by his uncle, he could not but feel that he had deeply wronged and injured his brother. Under such impressions, 4a0 approached the confines of Edom on his journehe became greatly troubled. This was greatly:In- creased, by being stopped in one of the passes of the Seir mountains by a troop of Arab warriors, who only allowed him to proceed on his journey by his claiming kindred with Esau. In his mind again was revived the fear of Esau, whose threat prompted him to leave home and go to Assyria. In this state of perturbation he resolved on sending an embassy to Esau for the purpose, if possible, of allaying his resentment, and securing conditions of peace. Accordingly, he sent his brother the following message: "My lord Esau, thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now. I have oxen and asses, and men servants and maid servants, and I have sent tft tell my lord that I may find grace in his sight." But the warriors who had intercepted the path of Jacob in the mountains-had apprised Esau of his approach, and supposing that his father was dead, for lhe had heard; nothing for a. long time from. Beersheba, he took a chosen band of four hundred warriors and went out to meet him. The messen-   232    THE ASTROLOGER U0' CHALDEA. gers sent oy Jacob had not proceeded a great wag on their journey until they met Esau with his army, and being made acquainted with his intentions, thy hastened back to inform Jacob. The intelli- ge was of a startling and terrific character, and heircel-y knew what could be done. As no time weto be lost, he resolved upon the following:- Taking one half of the people and the flocks and herds, he sent them in advance, with the following presents for Esau, namely, two hundred she goats and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, thirty milch camels with their colts, twenty she asses and ten foals. Each drove was to be kept separate, and they were directed forward. When they approached the army of Esau, which halted as they came up, the chieftain addressing the first servant, said, "Whose art thou, and whither goest thou.' "These," -replied the servant, "are thy servant Jacob's, and all are a present sent unto my lord Esau, and behold he also is behind us." As the droves passed in succession the servants uttered the same language. When night came, he took his wives and maid servants and eleven sons, and sent them  over the ford Jabbok, and he was left alone. In the darkness and solitude he engaged in suppli- cation and prayer. Thus he prayed, O Jehovah f my father Abraham, and of 'tmy father Isaac, Whoa midst to me, return into thy country and to shy kindred, and I will deal well with thee, I am              \!   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.     233 not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and all the truth which thou hsst-shown untp thy servant, for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands.

While thus engaged in prayer, an angel appeared, and in his great distress and anguish of soul he seized hold upon him, believing him to be the angel of the Lord, and determined not to let him go until he should be assured of deliverance and safety from the wrath of Esau. The angel told him to let him go, at the same time struggling to escape ;,but Jacob clung with a death grasp, and so great was the conflict, that his thigh was thrown out of joint, "Let me go,"' said the angel, "for the day Jbreaketh!" "I will not let thee go,'t said Jacob, "except thou bless me." "What is thy name?" said the angel. 'My name is Jacob." "Thy name shall be no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince hast thou power with God and hast prevailed." But what is thy name?" said Jacob. "Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?"-and he blessed him there.   After the   234   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALD1A. angel departed, Jacob exclaimed, "I. have seen Jehovah, faceto face, and my life is preserved." When the sun rose over the Jordan, Jacob beheld Esau advancing with his four hundred men, and takin his handmaids and their children, and going before them, they all approached Esau. Soon as he as :near enough to be recognized, Jacob bowed himself seven times. The kind heart of Esau never failed him, for no sooner did he see his brother in this attitude, than he dismounted and ran and fell upon his neck and embraced and kissed him. In the sight of those stern mountain warriors and the multitude of servants around, those brothers lifted up their voices and wept. After this the wives and children and servants all came forward and bowed to Esau, who received them with the same kindness he had his brother. After the'inter- view was endbd, Esau, at the urgent solicitations of Jacob, took the presents which he had provided, and returned to his home a happier if not a better man. Jacob 'continued his journey and concluded to select a desirable location in the valley, where he built a house and made booths for his cattle. This place was afterwards called Succoth. Here he remained for some time and increased his prosperity, until it occurred to him. that he would remove to Shalem, a eity of Shecheni in the land of Canaan. Here, adjoiining the city, he purchased land and   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.    235 erected an altar which he called El Elohe-Israel. In consequence of family difficulties, he was directed of the Lord to leave his place of residence and go to Bethel, where Jehovah had appeared 4o lim in his flight from his enraged brother Esau. Herehe erected an altar which he called El Bethel. While here, Jehovah appeared unto him and said, "Thy name is Jacob,-thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name. I am God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply, a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come. out of thy loins, and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land." After this interview Jacob set up a pillar in com- memoration of the event, and consecrating it by libations of oil and wine, he removed from Bethel and started for Edar. On the journey, Rachel, one of his wives, was delivered of a child, and as she survived its birth but a short time, it was called Benoni, but the name was subsequently changed to Benjamin. This was the first death in the family, and many were the tears and loud the lamentations of its numerous members. The place at which this melancholy event occurred was Bethlehem, and after' she had been deposited in the grave, Jacob erected a pillar over the spot to mark the resting place of his beloved. From this sad spot he Jour-   236'   THE ASTROLOGER OF -CHALDEA. neyed on until he 'reached his destination and pitched his tent a short distance beyond the tower -of Edar. While here, intelligence reached him of the death of Isaac, his father, who had removed from Beer- sheba to the old homestead of Abraham his father, at Mamre. Immediately on the receipt of this sad intelligence he dispatched messengers to- Esau in 6om, informing him of the melancholy event, and requesting him to join him at Mamre for the purpose of paying the last rites to the remains of their departed father. Every thing being in readiness, Jacob gathered together his family, consisting of Leah and her sons Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and  Zebulon, and the sons of Rachel, Joseph and BenJamin.  He also summoned the sons of his concubines, Dan, Naphtali, Gad and Asher, and departed for Ma-mre. \ The journey was a rapid bne, and in due time the company   arrived at Mamre. Scarcely had they rested from the toils of travel ere i:was announced from  the tent of-affliction that Esau and his com- pany, on fleet Arabian chargers, were seen coming in the distance. The brothers met again in a fond fraternal embrace and shed their tears of anguish over the lifeless remains of their father. All partook of the grief of that hour. It was necessary soon to bear the remains to their last resting place, as Isaac had now been dead several days. Accord- i         ,              I   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.     237 mngly, a procession was formed, composed of Esau, Jacob, their wives and children, and the friends of the patriarch in the surrounding country who had come to the funeral, and with, slow and solemn step they marched to the cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah had been entombed long years ago. After the obsequies were ended, the families started for their respective homes. Jacob's possessions were now immense, andahe devoted his attention mainly to the cultivation of the soil. This was accomplished by his many servants, while -his numerous flocks and herds were principally kept by his sons. Joseph, the first born of Rachel who had died, was now seventeen years  of age. He was a youth of great promise, of fine manly though delicate proportions, and of singular personal attractions. On these and other accounts he was greatly beloved of his father, who frequently manifested for him an undue partiality. Whether to distinguishkhim from the rest of his brethren when at a distance in the field, or to impart to him a dignity above them, is a subject concerning which the sacred record is silent, but so it was, that Jacob had a coat made for Joseph of several colors. The favoritism thus shown by' the father became an occasion of envy and hatred among the brothers against Joseph, and it was with difficulty that they could treat him with any respect or kindness. This' animosity and hatred was increased to a still greater "^ *   ,   238    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. extent by the following circumstances :--It seems that Joseph had two dreams, in one of which he found himself in a field binding sheaves, and the sheaf which he bound rose from the earth and stood upright, while those bound by his brethren stood round about and made obeisance to it; in the other dream he saw the sun and moon and the eleven stars do obeisance to him." These dreams he related-to his father and brethren. The father rebuked him, saying, "{Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren, indeed, come to bow down ourselves to thee to t]he earth?" The brethren indignantly replied, "shalt thou indeed have dominion over us!" Soon after this the sons were sent with the flocks to Shechem, with the exception of Joseph, who was retained at home. Indeed, so great was the father's attachment for him that he could not bear to have him out of his sight. One day, being anxious to hear from the eleven, for he had received no intelli- gence from them since their departure, he called Joseph to him and informed him-that-he wished him to go, to Shechem for the purpose of ascertaining how the young men were getting along, and return as soon as possible and report. When he arrived within a few miles of the place, he met a stranger, who, on inquiring about his brethren, told him they had! some  time since removed from  Shechem 'to Dothan.  Accordingly  he directed his course thitherward, and on arriving in sight of his brethren, ",* a/   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.     239 being easily distinguished by -his parti-colored tunic, all their rage was at once excited. 4' Behold," said one, "yonder comes the dreamer. Come now and let us slay him and cast him into a pitj and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams." Reuben, the first born of Leah, said, "let us not kill him, shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him." When Joseph came up, before he had time to dis- mount and salute his brethren, he was rudely seized, dragged from his horse, his many colored coat torn from him, and he forced forward and thrown into the pit. As he sank down into its dark depths they departed, and- coming into the vicinity of their flocks, they sat down to eat and drink and to make merry. While thus engaged, they saw in the distance a caravan of Ishmaelites laden with the precious commodities of the, East, on their way to Egypt.   As they drew near, Judah said, "what profit is it if we slay -our brother and conceal *his blood? Come and let us sell him to the Ishmael- ites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh." At the same time there came along  Midianites, merchantmen, and the brethren drew Joseph out of the pit and sold him to- the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. The   240    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. traders mounted him upon a camel, and soon he was on the way toEgypt. During the transaction Reuben was not present; he had returned into the forest for the purpose of procuring means whereby to liberate his brother from the pit and send him home. When he returned to the place; he found him not, and supposing his brethren had slain him, he rent his clothbe in anguish, exclaiming "whither shall I gq?"  When he came to, his brethren he learned what disposition had been made of him.  The brethren, to conceal their guilt, determined to practice the following deception upon their father: They killed a kid, and dipping his coat in the blood, sent it to their father, saying, "This have we found, now know whether it be thy son's coat or no." Jacob at once recognizing it said, "It is my son's coat, an evil beast hath: devoured him, Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces." The father was instantly filled with grief, and rending his garments, he put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned -many y days. Though all his son's and daughters rose up to comfort him, still h6 refused all consolation, and in the bitterness of his spirit exclaimed, "I will go down to my son in the grave mourning." The caravan at length arrived in Egypt, and as Joseph was a delicate and likely young man, they took him to the court of Pharaoh, where being met by FPotiphar, the captain of the guard, he was imme liately purchased by that officer for, himself.   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.    241 Being extremely modest, diffident, and retiring in his manners, the captain of, the guard at once' took him to his own palace and'made him servant to his wife. His gentleness and kindness, combined with a ,great devotion to his master's interests and all that pertained to his palace, were such as to win the hearts of all, and such was the iconfidence inspired in the mind of Potiphar in regard to his fielity, that he placed him over all the servants, and put him in possession as superintendent of all his possessions. His youth and beauty of form and person made a strong and powerful impression upon the voluptuous nature of -his master's wife, and she became so enamored of his charms that it was with her a living passion which like a fire raged with uncontrollable violence within her tumultuous bo- som. To possess him and enjoy his -society alone and exclusive, was her only desire, and to effect this object, she resorted to all the irts of which women of passion and pleasure are capable. Young and guileless, he knew not the web that she was ? endeavoring to weave around him, nor the power of fascination she was exerting to charm him from the path of virtue 'and fidelity.  With flushed cheek and languishing eye and heaving bosom she would approach him, and with all the tenderness of woman, solicit him to sin. But he was proof to all her seductive smiles, nor did he for a moment,--so" wonderfully did Jehovah interpose in his behalf,-- 16   242   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. feel an- improper desire arise in his heart. Her buuning glances and seductive wiles affected him no more than would; the glancing moonbeams an icy mountain. It was not that he had no feeling and was exempt from all those passions which are conmmon to humanity, for he was in the full bloom of life, but God had scaled the fountain of his virtue, and hoa placed around it an angel guard, so that no wicked hand should disturb its deep and quiet waters. Chagrined and dsappointed, and feeling her pride wounded, with still a burning desire, she resolved upon another effort to lure him to her embrace. On a certain day she had arranged it to Iave all the servants away from the palace, and seift for Joseph to come to her chamber. He accordingly obeyed the summons, and went trembling with -fear. No 'sooer had he entered than she caught him in hei arms, and with more passionate expressions of tenderness than she had employed before, she entreated him to yield to her solicitations. To all this Joseph replied, "How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"  At this he a straggled to escape from her embrace, and so violent Was the effort that a portion of his garment was torn from him in the struggle.

"See here," said she, holding up the, portion torn from the garment of Joseph, "the Hebrew that he brought to me came in to my chamber to violate my person, and as I cried with a loud voice, he fled and hath left part of his garment."         i When Potiphar came to his palace she relAted to him the same story, and his anger was greatly excited at the rehearsal, so much so that he in- stantly ordered his apprehension, and had him cast into the royal prison among the malefactors of the realm. Though- his position in society had thus suddenly become changed, it did not change his character; that proved sufficiently strong to resist the power of temptation on the one hand and perse- cution on the other. It was not long here as elsewhere that he was permitted to remain, until he became a favorite, and so greatly was he esteemed by the jailor, that he entrusted all the prisoners to his care.  Sometime after the imprisonment of Joseph, the chief butler and baker of Pharaoh's palace, for  some offense which they had committed against the king, were cast into the prison. They had been placed in the same ward with Joseph, and hence were placed under his care. One mornihg they informed Joseph that they had both dreamed, and they were sad on account of them. He requested   "    THE ASTRQLOGER OF CHALDEA. *them to" relate their dreams, which they did as follows:-The chief butler saw a vine with three branches which budded and bloomed and brought forth ripe grapes. The chief baker saw three white baskets placed on his head, in which were all sorts of baked meats for the king, but the birds came and eat them.  "This is the interpretation of the drang' said Joseph, "the three vines are three days, at the expiration of which time," addressing the butler, "thou shalt be taken out and set at liberty." Then addressing the chief baker, he said, "the three white baskets are three days, at the expiration of Which time thou shalt be taken out of prison and hanged upon a tree, and the birds shall eat the flesh from thy bones." After three days all was fulfilled as Joseph interpreted. It was now a, period of two long years since Joseph was cast into prison, and notwithstanding his kindly offices to the chief butler, he had entirely forgotten,' him, not evetn so much as mentioning his name. A circumstance, however, occured at this time,which brought him to remembrance. Pharaoh had a dream, as follows :-He stood on the bank of a river, and he saw coming out of the same, seven fine large cows, and they went to feeding in a meadow which lined the margin of the river. And aain he saw seven poor lean cows come out of the riyer after them and follow them to the meadow. He saw also in his dream the seven lean cows eat   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.     245 up the seven fat cows, after which he awoke. But he dreamed again on this- wise:--He saw seven large full ears of corn grow upon one stalk, and seven thin ears, blasted by the east wind, grow upon another stalk, and the seven blasted ears ate the seven full ripe ears. The dreams greatly troubled the king, and being anxious for their interpretation, he summoned all the magcians, astrologers, and wise men of his realm immediately to his presence. They came at his command, but none of them were able to interpret them or give the least hint as to what they should indicate. While all was anxiety, the chief butler made his appearance and uttered the following language:--l I do remember my faults this day.? The king recol- leets having committed myself and the chief baker to prison, and how that I was graciously liberted while le was hanged. Now it came to pass that we both dreamed, and we told our dreams to a fellow prisoner, a young Hebrew who was a servant to the paptain of the guard,-and he interpreted them so that they came to pass just as he had said." -:On hearing this, the king immediately sent for Joseph, and being duly attired, he'was:presented before him in the royal palace. Having informed him 6of he object of the interview, he relgted his dreams and asked an interpretation. After giving him to under, stand that it was by Divine inspiration that diamopi were interpreted, Joseph gave him thd following O97                     246   THE AgTROLOGER OF OHAI DEA. explanation :--"Both dreams have the same signifi. cation, and Jehovah in them shows thee what he is going to do. The seven fat kine and the seven full ears are designed to represent seven years of plenty, and the seven lean kine and seven blasted ears repre- sent seven years of famine which shall prevail throughout all the land of Egypt." In addition to this; he gave him instruction in regard to the raising of crops and the stowing away of the produce of the land, in granaries in the large cities of the realm, so that notwithstanding the famine should be wide 4pread and grievous, there should be enough and to spare 'from the great plenty with which the land should be blest. Pharaoh was highly pleased with the interpretation and advice of Joseph, and regard- ing him as the wisest man in all his kingdom, he immediately promoted him to the highest honor and authority, averring that only in the throne should the king have the pre-eminence.. Then taking the royal ring from his finger, he placed it on the finger of Joseph, and placing a chain of gold around his neck, he arrayed him in royal vestments. He then ordered the royal chariot, and placing him in the same, he ordered the officers of his court to go befo him and cry out to the multitude:-"Bow the knee before the man whom the king hath made ruler over all the land of Egypt." The king then gavelim an Egyptian name, Zaphnathpaaneah, and presented him for a wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-pherah a priest of On.     Ha   THE CHLD OF PROMSE.    247 Being invested with the vice-royalty of Egypt, he made a journey throughout the length and breadth of the land, and made all the arrangements necessary for garnering the fruits of the earth during the skeven years of plenty which were .to ensue. In process of time he was blest with children, the name of his first born was Manasseh, and the second was called Ephraim. At length the seven years of plenty came to an end and the seven years of dearth began. When the inhabitants of the rural districts had exhausted their supplies,they came to the royal city and made application to tite king for relief, who, on hearing their complaints, referred them all to Joseph, telling them to observe whatsoever he should command them. Intelligence soon came from all parts of the world that the famine was raging, and multitudes flocked to ypt Among the number of those who came from Canaan were the sons of Jacob, with the exception of the youngest. One day, as Joseph sat upon his chair of state dispensing orders in the distribution of Scorn to the numerous applicants, he saw ten Canaanites enter the hall, and as they approached him,' he at once recognized them as his brethren. It was now ten years since they had sold him as a slav:, and from the position which he occupied, as well as his altered appearance and the peculiar manner of dress' which he wore as vice-regent of Egypt, 2e was entirely unknown to themi As they came near him, in a rough commanding voice he said,   248   TaJE ASTaOLOGI O  IF CALDEA. "Where came you?" The eldest replied, "From the land of Canaan to buy food." "Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come." "Nay, my lord, but to buy food thy servants are come. We are one man's sons, we are true men; thy servants are no spies." "Nay, but ye have come to see the nakedness of the land." "Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of Os man in the land of Canaan, and behold the youngest is this day with our father and the other is not." "That is what l. said unto thee, ye are spies. Hereby shall ye be proved. By the life of Pharaoh ye  all not go hence until you bring your youngest brother; send one of your brethren, to bring him, and ye shall be kept in prison until your words may beoproved whether there is any truth in you, or:else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies." They were accordingly put in prison where they remained three days, at the expiration of which time Joseph went to them and spoke through an intetter as follows :--"This do, and live, for I fearr God. If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in prison, and let the rest go and wrry corn for the famine of your houses; but bring your youngest brother unto me, jso shall your words be verified and' ye shall not die."    THE CHLD OF PROMSE.     249 Deeply impressed with these words, they said one to another,--"We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear him, therefore is this distress come upon us." To this Reuben replied, "Did I not say unto you, do not sin against the child, and ye would not hear, there- fore, behold also his blood is required."  The heart of Joseph was touched by this conver- sation, and filled with emotions he could not repress, he turned aside to weep. As soon as he was able to command himself, at their permission he co*', manded Simeon to be bound, and released the others. He also directed the merchants to fill their sacks with corn, and privately, put the money which they had paid, into the sacks. All things - being in readiness, they departed on their josney homeward. When they completed one day's jour- ney, and had stopped at an inn for the night, one of the brethren in opening his sack for the purpose of getting some corn for his animal, found on the top the money which he -had paid for the same; on examination it was found that all the sacks contained the amount paid. At this all the brethren were greatly terrified and were wholly unable to e!ai the mystery. At length they arrived at home and made their father acquainted with all the circum- stances which had transpired, and how that the lords; of the country had required them to bring    2650   THE ASTRBLOGER OF CHALDEA. their youingest brother, retaining as a surety for the performance of the demand, their brother"Simeon as a prisoner. When Jacob heardvthis he was greatly distressed and exclaimed:- ',Me have you bereaved of my children, Joseph is not and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away; all these things are against me." To this'4Reuben replied, "slay my two sons if I bring him niot to thee; deliver him into my hand and I will bring him unto thee again." "My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he is left alone; if mischief befall him by the way which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."    ! The famine continued grievous in the land, and it As not long until the stock of provisions brought from Egypt was exhausted, and it was necessary to get a' supply. Jacob accordingly summoned his sons and commanded them-to go again to Egypt for food. At this Judah responded, "The lord of the country did solemnly protest, saying, ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you. Therefore if thou wilt send our brother with us we wil o, otherwise we can not go." "Why," said Jacob,- "did you deal so cruelly with me as to tell him you had another brother?" "Because he asked us of -our state and of our kiadred, and we knew not his designs. ,Ehou ?.,      A^   THE ClHLD OF PROMSE;    251 wilt let Benjamin go with us I will be surety for him, and if I bring him not back to thee, then let me bear the blame forever." "Then take your brother, but take with you double money and presents of balm, honey, spices, nuts and almonds, and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may return your other brother and Benjamin." Thus they did as they were commanded and started on their journey. When. they arrived in Egypt and presented themselves before Joseph, he commanded that a sumptuous feast be provided, and they were all invited to the princely banquet. When they were informed by the steward of Joseph's palace of his request, they were astounded, and supposed that he had an evil intention; but that officer told them to fear not, for all would be well. Simeon was brought from the prison, and all being in readiness, they entered the palace, and approaCh- ing Joseph, bowed with their faces to the earth, presenting their gifts. Joseph received them kindly, and in an affectionate tone inquired after their welfare, saying, "Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?" "Thy servant our father is in good healthe is yet alive," saying which they again bowed them- selves. Looking upon Benjamin, he said, "Is this your brotfei of whom ye spake. God be gracious to r.,. -; "'   I        ,1 X   252   THE ASTROLOGER O' CHALDEA. thee my son." But the scene was too trying for this affectionate and gentle nature, and he fled from the banqueting hall to his chamber, and gave vent to his feelings in tears. As soon as his emotion had subsided, he returned, and taking his seat with them at the table apart from the Egyptians, for Hebrews may not eat with them. Special attention and favor was shown in serving Benjamin at the feast. Great was the joy and rejoicing of that hour, When the feast was ended, the steward was commanded to fill the corn sacks, and -secretly to place in- that of Benjamin the silver goblet of his lord, which was lined with gold.  Early next morning they were on their way, But they had not proceeded far qlntil they were overtaken by the steward, who charged them with base ingratitude. "NOt content with receiving corn without pay, and all the hospitalities of my lord's house," said he, 'you have stolen the silver and gold of his table." They at once protested their innocence and said, "'if it be found on any of us, he who is guilty shall die, and the rest of us shall be thy lord's bondmen." Let it be as thou hast said," replied the- steward, "and he shall-be my servant;" On searching, the goblet was found in the sack of Benjamin. At this they were all filled with horror and amazement, and rent their clothes with anguish. Agreeably to the stipulations they all returned to the court of 'Joseph. When they made their appearance they wf  so ,'       ? bij      s - &    THE CHLD OF PROMSE.     253 confused they knew not what to say.  Joseph perceiving this exclaimed, "What deed is this ye have done; know you not that such a man as I can certainly divine?" "Behold," said Judah, "we are my lord's ser- vants, both -we and he also with whom the cup is found." , God forbid," said Joseph, "that I should do so, but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant, but as for you, get you up in peace to your father."' Judah stepping forward immediately replied, "Let not my lord be angry. If Benjait go not back to hisfather, the old man will die with sorrow. Take me as thy bondman in his stead, for I became to my father a surety for his safe return." At this, Joseph, whose feelings were becoming intensely excited, cried out to the captain of the guard, "Cause every Egyptian to leave me instant- ly;" and when all were gone but his bretlren, unable to restrain himself any longer, he burst- out into a passionate expression of grief. As Asoon as his feelings had subsided sufficiently to speak, he rose from his -seat, and advancing towards his brethren, 'said, "I am Joseph, doth my father yet live?"The brethren were overwhelmed and con- founded, so that they could not speak. He repeated "I am Joseph, your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt, be not grieved or angry with yourselve-sfor.   254   THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. having soldine, for God did send me before .you to preserve you, to make you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

All this was known to Tiharaoh, and by him well approved, insomuch that he ordered the necessary wagons for the transportation of the family, and supplied the company well with provisions for the journey. He also sent numerous and costly presents to Jacob, and urged him to come add make his home in Egypt.  When they returned and the intelligence was communicated to the aged patriarch that his son Joseph was alive and ruler in Egypt, he was so overjoyed he fainted. When he revived, he said, "It is enough, Joseph my son is alive; I  will go and see him before I die."

Stopping at Beersheba, Jacob offered up sacrifices and thanksgivings to Jehovah, who appeared to him and said, "I am the Goa of thy father, fear not to go down into Egypt for I will there make of thee a great nation. I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also bring thee up again, and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes." Thus encour- aged he rose and pursued his journey. Judah having been sent before as a messenger to inform Joseph of the approach of his father and family, consisting of seventy persons, the viceroy took his chariot and went out to meet them. When they met, a scene of fmost touching interest presented itself. No sooner did Jacob recognize his long lost son than he embraced him, fell upon his neck and kissed him. Then with tearful eyes he looked upon him and said, "Now let me die since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive." The father was taken in the chariot of Joseph and introduced to Pharaoh, who received him kindly and assigned him and his posterity a portion in Goshen. Here they lived and increased in prosperity. Jacob died and was taken by Joseph to Canaan and buried. The Israelites increased greatly, insomuch that in a few hundred years they numbered three millions.

THE CHLD    OF DESTINY. IN the fate of Ishmael and his posterity we have the fulfilment of prophecy quite as wonderful, but still more startling and terrific than that which at present hangs like a dark and gloomy pall over the ,posterity of Isaac. We have already traced the son of the Egyptian mother, from the period when a homeless outcast child 'in the desert, with none but a mother to care for him, and we saw that mother in her despair lay' him down to die,--but we saw a divine interposition in his behalf, his destiny was not yet fulfilled, and thet"ohild was snatched from the grave, and borne on by a providence as wonder- ful as it was marked, frow:s period to period, in his history, until from the chieftain of a single tribe, he rose to the chieftainship of all the wandering tribes of the East, and his own sons became mighty princes and warriors, and he possessed a power and dominion which extended from the gulf ofY-IPersia on the East to that of Arabia on the West, and from the Mediterranean on the North to Yemen and Hydramant on the. borders of the Indian Ocean In the fastnesses of the mountains of Arabia De- serta, and on the plains of Arabia Felix, this mighty- 17             257    68"    THE ASTROLOGER OF CHALDEA. prince constructed his palaces and fortresses, and "pitched his tents. As early as the death of his faiher Abraham, he had become the terror of all surrounding nations,--and no commerce could be carried oniwith the 'ast and the vast and mighty cities of the Nile, without his permission and protections The twelve sons of Ishmael became proprietors of as many towns and castles as there were names am ong them, and it was thus that when , Isai, Was leading the peaceful life of a shepherd, and his sons were quietly with him in the green and fertile valleys of Canaan, living in tents, and Subsisting according ton the simple rules of patri- archal life, Ishmael was a wild and daring warrior on the mountains and valleys and plains of Arabia, living in rock built palaces, subsisting upon the spoils of the East, and reveling in oriental luxury. And it was thus that when Esau forsook his father's house, having baen deprived of his birth- right and his blessing, that Ishmael received the homeless wanderer, and gave him a name and a place among the princes of his house. Having passed to an hundred and thirty-seven years, in- creasing in wealth and power and influence, having already borne to the grave his idol wife and the mother of his valorous sons, the period at length arrived for Ishmael's departure.  He had known and had worshipped the God of his father, and how far the consolations of that graee which had so ' a   THa CHLD oQ DISTUTr.    69 lavishingly beei bestowed upon his divinely ltored and fortunate brother were imparted to him, ,re ,  know not, for as concerning his end the ScrOptuNe His silent, but that he wrought out his destiny to the *4 very letter of prophecy, all h'stqry declares. ,  We dare not enter the secret place of that Being, whose pavilion is darkness, spread overdleep waers and enveloped in thick clouds of the skies, and,te cannot know thp mysteries of that Providence which gave to the children of the same Ifatheiuch a different destiny, and we shall wait the opening of that morn when all secrets shall -be made known, when that which we now can only know in pai shall be known perfectly, and the Great Eternal Father shall justify his ways to man. Till then we are satisfied, and though human reason stagger at the developments of this:life, we are supported by a faith firm and everlasting, that "though clouds and darkness are round about Jehovah, yet righteousness and judgment are the habitations of hisihrone." We have seen also how the fortunes of Isaac descended through Jacob to his posterity, and how, under the blessings of God, every event, however seemingly unpropitous in the beginning, w raht out in the end the most incalculable good.

When the Israelites were on their way to Capaan, they arrived on the borders of Edom, the- country then occupied by the descendants of Esap.

History informs us that before there was a king reigning in Israel, Edom swayed a scepter d power unrivalled in the East, and that a long line of dukes dwelt in Petra, that fifty thousand warriors could issue froth its capital, at a moment's warning, to resist the attacks of their foes. But this was not all their force;-besides being allied to the Ishmael- ites, they had a line of forts extending throughout the length of thei kingdom. They were,r however, doomed.  A dreadful fate had been pronounced against them", their cities were to be depopulated, and they themselves to be destroyed. The time was to come when not one descendant of Esau shouldIhave an existence upon the earth, when the very name should be blotted out forever.

If Edom  then succeeded in shaking off the yoke it was only for a season, since in the days of Jehoshapat, the fourth Jewish monarch from Solomon, it is said there was no king in Edom, a deputy acting as viceroy of the king of Judah." That the latter was ruler of the country, is evident from the fact of his haring fitted out a fleet at Ezion-Gaber. This deputy joined the confederates of Juhah and Israel in their attack, upon Moab.

In the reign of Aha;i hordes of,'Edom- ites. made. intrsions into Judah and carried away captives. About the same period, Rezin, king of Syr' expelled the Jews, from Elath, which was thenceforw^ occupied by the Edomites.  Now had come the period when the other part of Isaac's prophecy, that Esau should take his brother's yoke from off his. nc was fulfilled. Tl. Edomites employed their recovered power in the enlargement of their territry in all directions. They spread as far South as tedan in Arabia, and Northward. to Petra. When the Chaldeans invaded Judah, under Nebuchadnezzer,the Edomites became their willing auxiliaries, dtd tri1mphed with fidnish malignity over the Din of their kinsmen, the Jews, of whose des*olt ands they hoped to obtain a large portion to themselves. By this circumstance the hereditary :odad. of the: Jews -qas rekindled in greater fury   A- XHa CHLD OF 3sYET1. *  than ever, and hence ,the many dire denunciations of the diughter of Edom toge found in the Hebrew prophets. From the langge of Malachi, and a lso from the accounts preserved by Josephus, it would seem that the Edomites did not wholly escape the: Chaldean scourge, but instead of being carried captive, like the Jews, they not only retained pos- session of their owp territory, but became mastersi. of the South of Jidea as far as Hebron. Here, however, in courte of time, they were successfully - attacked by the Maccabees, and about the year 125 A' B. C., were finally subdued by John Hyrcanus,'wk6 4 compelled them to submit to circumci4on and other Jewish rites, with a view to incorporate them with the nation. The amalgamation of the two rits, though proceeding from the same co0mon stock, was, however, not effected, for we afterwards hear of Antipater, an Edomite by birth, being made by Cesar procurator of all Judea, andzlhis son, com- monly called Herod the Great, was at the time of Christ's birth, king of Judea, includingl Edom, and Roman writers often speak of all Palestine under that name. Not long before the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, twenty thousand Edomites were called in to the defense ofthe city by the Zealots, but both parties gave themselves up to rapine and murder.
