CHAPTER     IL "There is a very singular oinolidenpe assoiatedl with your dream, with the ms   you really heard' saidarr-Uy Bluoe to his amiable sister Rose, who wai repeating a dream she wad had the previous night, as they sat 'ta breakfast, at tleir h6me i Bleecker street. it was about like this:."  ' She had reached the Lime Kilns of Mr. Knapp mi Fourteenth street, when a tomb which rppeardd at the entrance seemed to rock at her .approach. Whilst iestitting whether to retire or advanee, the tomb became enveloped in an asoending vapor. In a moment the place echoed the groans of one in the agofies of death; and as the vapor. dispersod, there appeared kneeling on the tomb a most beautiful female, naked to the waisti Her eyes were swollen wIh weeping,.her hi$r wss .aishevened and fro/m her 'wounded breast blood trickled down profusely. while her hands in vain attempted to remove a dagger, the ftal point of wlich 'as buried deep in her bosom.   Rose's attention tothe speptre was so intense and bewilderinag that. she:a idnot:.i& the' form of a man whQ stood contemplating w'ith smiles, t-i agonies of the female, until the sound of a harp, which he touche a   use  her.' ifigure was   adome, a rapd'anner arousie           was handsoe, hS 1 x e s   f6          THE LIME-KILN MAN, OR complexion was dark brown, and dark hair curled in confused ringlets on his forehead-his voice which accompanied the harp, was melodious. Listening to his lively strain, Rose was struck with horror and astonishment at the following rhapsody- Flow softly-gently-vital stream; Ye crimson life-drops stay; Indulge me with this pleasing dream Thro' an eternal day. See-see my soul, her agony I See how her eyeballs glare I Those shrieks delightful harmony, Proclaim her deep despair I Blsrise-i--Infernal spirits rise, Swift dart across her brain-- Thou Horror, with blood-chilling cries. Lead on thy hideous train. O, feastmy soul--revenge is sweet- Louisa, take my scorn- Cursed was the hour that saw us meet; The hour when we were born I Scarcely was the last stanzas sung, when the trembling Rose awoke from her dream; doubting for a moment, whether what she had seen and heard was not a reality. Just as she had over- come the impression arising from so horrible a vision, the night wind wafted by the casement of her chamber the tone of an in- strument so similar to those she had heard in fancy, that starting up in her bed, she drew aside the curtain, under an apprehension of beholding, awake the vision of her sleep. The chamber was in total darkness; but the same sounds were repeatied: and hearing them now more, distinctly, her heart sank within her with terror at the certainty. She determined to quit her bed, and feeling her way to the window, opened it. The same sounds were heard again, yet more distinctly, and were ascertained to proceed' from a seranading party in-the street,. "Do you remember," said Harry, continuing his interrogations, "enough of the place you supposed was the Lime Kilns, to com- pare what you saw in the dream with the place itself!" "Beyond a doubt," said Rose. d; We will take a ramble there in the evening," replied Harry; "and should there be a tomb in the old Kilns resembling that in your dream, I think we should relate the whole to father, Mur- der is a crime, above all others the most offensive to the Diety; and if ever the Omnipotent, displays a miracle, I can conceive nothing more likely to occasion his supernatural interference, than detection of so foul a crime." They seperated. Harry went about his business, and at dinner time as usual, was on his way to Gale's Dining Saloon, No. 15   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.    ' Spruce street, (that excellent place for good dinners,) when he encountered a man of large and cymetrical form, his face quite brown from exposure to sun and storm; his hair, naturally dark, was dyed by a substance that appeared on it, and hung in light golden ringlets over his shoulders; his beard reached his breast, and was in a similar condition with his hair; his dress, always the same, was quite dilapidated; and he had on several coats, and as many pair of pantaloons. This singular man will be recognized by every resident of the city of New York, as William McFarland, or as more generally known "The Lime-Kiln Man." Harry had often seen him, and thought from his eccentricities that some grevious misfortune had befallen him, and he had thus given himself up to the charity of the world; and feeling anxious to know something of his history, he thought a better opportuity might never offer him for that pur- pose; accordingly he invited him to dine with him. The old gen- tleman bowed politely, as he turned towards the door, not waiting for a second or more pressing invitation. They were soon seated at a back table, and their eatables were call ed for. He would have nothing that had ever enjoyed life-nothing in whica sugar was an ingredient; and his drink was water. He never smiled; and the only pleasure he ever appeared to enjoy was the triumph of argu- ment. To obtain this pleasure, he would constantly controvert the most obvious truths; he delighted in attacking revelations, and was indefatigable in discovering the scruples of his hearers on religious points. The irremediable evils of society were his dearest topics, and the climax of his felicity was, by the. abuse of the eloquence he possessed, to render discontent triumphant. He seldom spoke to any one first-when he did so it was his invariable custom to single out one much younger than himself, with whom he would abruptly begin a conversation. Harry had asked him several questions during the time he was eating, which he merely answered, but as soon as he had satisfied his appetite, he tapped a young man who was sitting by his side, on the shoulder, and asked(him if he had read the last novel, so much talked of. "( I never read novels," said the stranger, "Why not!" asked the old man. "It is throwing away one's time, to say the best," was the reply, ":I make a point never to read anything of that sort. I never   8    .     THE LIME-KILN MAN, O0 read a novel in my life, and I never will-they're well enough for girls   . "Prejudice-Prejudice-Prejudice--how art thou worshipped in this isle!" exclaimed the Lime-Kiln Man. "I suppose, then, you plunge a pretty good depth in literature of a more obscure or erudite nature," continued he. "Have you looked into the last political effusion by the Rev. ---." "I make a point never to read works of that description. If I understandits object correctly it is to turn everything topsy-turvy; and I feel no sort of inclination to be made giddy- I leave  this sort of things to your revolutionists."' '; Prejudice again," cried the old man-- perhaps then, you dive into the mines of science. You read --- "Oh, no, believe me, not I. I was obliged to do something in that way at Princeton. But I've done with lectures, completely ; and, to own the truth, the only science I care about now,'is to make an estate of ten thousand a year bring me 'happiness in the way I like it." "I crave your pardon then," said McFarland.!"Had I known you were in the possession of ten thousand a year, I shpnld by no means have suspected you guilty of possessing a mind." "Is there no prejudice in that observation, sir " said Harry with ma smile of modest diffidence. McFarland, instead of answering, fixed a pair of large hazel eyes on Harry; and folding his arms upon his breast examined everv feature of his countenance. Aftet a considerable pause, he said-                      4 "You I believe, do not possess ten thousand a year, but if I am not much, indeed deceived, you have materials of which a skilful artist might form a great mind. Allow me to ask you -have you a father ." "Yes-" answered Harry.  "Do I know him-r-is he of this city ." Harry satisfied his curiosity. "What business do you follow," "Keeping books." "Unfortunate Hunfortunate indeed! that such materials should have fallen into such hands.' You, of course, endeavor to compel your reason to adopt all those doctrines which priestcraft teaches." "Sir," replied Harry, with the glow of indignation on his   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.         9 cheek, " the honored person to whom, without knowing him, you apply a common-place epithet, never strove to inspire a sentiment in the breast of his children, to which the most enlightened reason could object." *' You rejoice me," cried the old man-" you have not then im- bibed the jargon of superstition called religion."* "Superstition and religion in your dictionary then, are synoni- mous terms," said Harry. "In the dictionary of truth they are so," replied McFarland. What is religion, but ceremony, or a set of ceremonies? 'How absurd, how degrading to a human being, with faculties so cqm- prehensive that all nature bows before him, to which she unfolds her sEcrets and submits her laws. I say then it must be beneath the dignity of such a creature to bend his knees, to bow his head, and mumble syllables of absurdities strung together cenituries ago, when, by the exercise of his own powers he might be introduced into the arena of great nature herself." Harry replied-" the dignity of human nature, sir, is no new subject to me. My father taught it me truly, and exemplified his doctrines by his conduct. He taught me, sir, that the dignity of our nature cannot be degraded by a public acknowledgment of our obligations to the Author of Nature, accordingto the customs and manners of our country; and that it is better to sanction bv -example, even prejudices, which cannot be momentarily and safely removed, than by ridiculing those institutions, which the mass of our fellow citizens hold sacred, to give the reins to uncultivated nature, "There is a vein of independence in your redasoning  I admire exceedingly, however much we may deviate in our conclusions,' said McFarland. This introduction led to a long conversation, in which each seemed to take a deep interest. McFarland appeared less and less disgusting in the eyes of Harry, and Harry delighted the old gentleman, who expressed a wish that this would not be the last of their conversations. They seperated after the following dialogue- *Some readers may deem it an impertinent interruption, if not an Impeachment of their understandings, to be reminded- , that the sentiments which are put into the mouths of 'various personages in a novel, are for the illustration of their various characters, and ought never to be viewed in any other light , But the author woulA rather incur the - blame of an unnecessary interruption, than suffer the possibilty of supposition that it wras his wish to disseminate principles, which it ix his aim to destry.,    10         THE LIME-KIN MAN, OR "I can see you any day at dinner-time; by being here, I sup- pose," said McFarland. "For the present," said Harry, "but in a week or two I shall quit this place for Philadelphia." "For Philadelphia!" exclaimed he r: "what takes you to that focus of corruption and folly?" "( My father has most kindly entered into a treaty with a mer- chant there, a share of whose concern is to become mine, after the usual initiation." "A merchant!" cried McFarland--" can you confine your capacities then to the boundaries of a counting house ledger-and condemn your noble faculties to calculations of sources of ex- change X Have you thought what you are about?" "I believe I have thought too much about it "' replied Harry. "To speak candidly I have been at rio small pains to make a match between duty and inclination; but the latter receives the addresses of the former, even yet, but coolly." "Mr. Bunce," said McFarland earnestly, "s as you value your happiness for life, reflect-now is that important momnnt, in the period of your existence, that will gild with pleasure, or darken with discontent, every scene as yet behind the veil of time. , I feel a lively interest in your welfare; and if you can trust your. self with me for an hour to-morrow, I will venture to say you will not regret it. Remember, you will find me at the Lime- Kilns in Fourteenth street at four o'clock. CHAPTER      II. At times, and under certain circumstances, it is pleasing to hear old friends recodnt the incidents of their past lives. So thought Harry Bunce, and presuming that the Lime-Kiln man would en. tertain him, he was determined, if possible to hear his story. Surely an abundance of romance was in it, and something being promised him, he withmuch anxiety awaited the appointed time. It is seldom the desire of an aged man, to close his mortal career without first making known to some favorite friend, the   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.       " little secrets he has so long cherished. In this instance the favored one was Harry Bunce, one well worthy the honor confer- E ed upon him. The time fixed soon came around, and found Harry punctual, as was always his first rule, and in the presence of his relater at the Lime-Kilns. "And you are really come," exclaimed he. "Is it the spur of curiosity that has urged you to this pompliancc? Comej be hon. est, sir, I have read the wondrous volume of this world. I have / been amongst men, I have bustled in the crowd. I have also been secluded from the herd, and in silent musings of full many a year, I have contemplated the strange variety of human nature. f Perhaps there is no passion, no impulse of the mind, that I have not experienced. Man is familiar to me-I know the whole ma- chine-its movements-and the nature of the material of which it is composed. You have an honest mind; by which I mean, that you are sincere; that your tongue utters what your heart dictates, and your reason/prompts. Now tell me what kind of a man you think me to be. "(Forming my judgment on observations/and appearances, I should suppose you a disappointed man; one whom misfortunes have induced to quarrel with the world." i "The very notions I should, have enter ined, had I seen my present resemblance at your age-for thy I viewed mankind through the same fairy telescope that you ct now. But to my story,   . "The father of the man you see before you, was a farmer, and resided in the little town of Brigallen,* Scotland. His family consisted of three besides myself, two brother's and a sister. The brother's names were Thomas and Knox, and the sister's was Maria. He was unfortunate in the concerns of life, somewhat negligent in consequence of misfortunes, and at last, broken- hearted with disappointment, sank poor to the grave." "My mother had gone there long before, when I was little over five years old." "It may be well to remark to you a few traits of my earliest years, as perhaps you may- trace a resemblence. I remember perfectly well, that when only four years old it was frequently my amusement to mount upon a chair, arrayed in my mother's white *Bridge of Alle is the proper name, but it is generally called BrigaUen in this country, /s   12         THE LIME-KILN MAN, OR apron, and assembling around me my brothers, an old woman my nurse, and ihy mother, to preach with considerable vehemence. "The prediction of course concerning me at that period, ele- vated my future fate to a priest. After my mother's decease, I went three or four times to the theatre, and I still recollect the wonderful impulse I felt to leap upon the stage, and join the per- formers." A similar sensation often seized me at church, when I almost wished myself in the pulpit. ' I know now that this was ambition in embryo; and had my parents situation in life placed an army within my early views, I doubt not I should have felt the same im- pulse to have seized the standard from a General, as I did to dis- place the clergyman from his pulpit, or thrust the performer from the stage.          ,       - "At seven years old I possessed the gravity of a sage. The pastimes of other boys were my aversion. Books of all descrip- tions that came within my reach I read, with +hat delight that an. imated me in scribblihg over every piece of paper I could procure with what I called my studies. The effusions were generally of a similar nature with the book I had last read; and, of course, I was a theologian, a dramatist, a poet, and a novelist, in turn. - Noth- ing, however, at this period was a greater treat to me, than to be permitted to remain at table after dinner, when the other children were sent to play, that I might listen to the discourse of my elders. "My bodily frame was such as may be expected from an in- dulgent mode of bringing up, and my own sedentary inclination- weak and- delicate. This consideration induced my father for some time, to object to placing me in' a public seminary, where a relative offered to provide for me. Poverty, however, advancing rapidly towards his humble dwelling, and, quickening its pace after domestic economy had quited it with my mother, made him soon accept the offer of his cousin. I left my native roof ere I was eight year old, and became a member of a daily school in Edinburgh, This I esteem the first grand era in my life. A public school is a little republic, where the honors and advantages of the community lie open to all; and  in no other soil can the seeds of ambition be so well cultivated. Soon was the spark of emulation felt within my bosom, infusing energy and vigor into every action., The middling classes beheld me with envy pass their ranks; and the highest wondered at my p      THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.       13 * swift approach. Success urged fresh endeavors, and ere I hadaat- tained my thirteenth year, I was qualified for the university; where I already was in fancy, struggling for academical distinc- tions. Just before my fourteenth birth-day;, was the second grand era in my life. My father died insolvent. A letter from my father's cousin, my benefactor, acquainted me that, c. in consequence of some considerable failures in his speculations, his fortune was much reduced, and that he could not fulfill his intentions of sup- porting me at the university," adding, that as I was now of age to go into the world, he wished me to think of some trade I should like. You, Mr. Bunce can conceive my feelings at this freak of for- tune. In the first moment of my disappointment, rage, conquer- ed reason, I considered my benefactor worse than an assassin. "My, God i"I exclaimed, " is he not a murderer? Has he not made me the parent of the fondest hopes, the brightest, dearest, expectations? Did he not, himself, beget these preams of bliss, which I, have cherished? and now, with a word, hemurders every hope!"-Trade!-My soul sickened at the sound, as he would re- peat it. Apprentice l-horror was in the word, and every hope of happiness vanished from my sight. In another moment different thoughts agitated me. My warm, romantic fancy, could not at once relinquish the views it had fostered. Pride aided fancy; and I persuaded myself, that were my genius but known, it would most certainly be patronized. I resolved to write to a celebrated character, at that time a patron of literature. The same evening on which I received my cousin's letter, I wrote one for this person, intending to send it the following morning; but in the morning my mind was in a different frame. I resolved to see my benefactor. He was an opulent tradesman, and resided in Edinburgh. "You, have received my letter, William," said he. "l amn sorry you should be disappointed in your views, though I have not a doubt but you will do much better in trade, than by drud- ging all your lifetime over books. Have you any choice?" "None that I can follow now, siir. I have indulged a hope that my industry at college might possibly have recommended me-" "To be some great man's toad eater," interrupted he, " is that what you mean 2 It could do nothing else for you. The church *             4   "        THE LIME-KILlN MAN, OR is absolutely beset with hungry suppliants. There's no arriving at the bar, without a fortune; and as to physic, a man's talents will never recommend him to a patient, if he keeps no car- riage. I wish to be your friend, William, and I think I know how. It must be by placing you in a situation, as however, disagreable it may appear on entering, will lead you to independence." I began now seriously to reflect upon the troth ofI these obser- vations., I recollected I was speaking to the only friend I had on earth; and though my pride suffered a severe wound, my judg- ment was improved in my own estimation. After a pause, I yielded my assent to the truth of his observa- tions, and expressed a wish that,I could write d fine..hand, as it might possibly procure me a genteel situation in some merchant's ,counting-house. "My friend smiled at my wish.--"You are in the same error there," said he "I believe no'set of men labor more, in general, than persons of that description, and what is their reward . A clean shirt, and a shining pair of shoes, which is pleasant enoaugh for a man in his teens. But think of the situation of such men, if they marry-if they live to old age; a mechanic who earns two pounds a week is a prince to them. I by no jmeans control you- if you think genteel misery desirable, you shill be a merchant's clerk.  I was humbled in my own sight; my heart no longer throbbed in the expectation that had delighted it; I felt it sinking, and a passive acquiescence in my friend's sentiments was the conse- quence. We parted with a promise from him to send me the address of a grocer the next day, and on whom I was to wait as my future master. My colleagues at school saw an alteration in my countenance, and soon discovered my future destiny, which attracted the scorn of some, the pity of many. Instead of sleeping that night, my mind was busily employed in contrasting the real with the fancied situation that was to suc- ceed my school days. My thirst for'literature swas never more to be indulged, but conquered. "Ah! ifatal delusion!"I thought it might be conquered. But the thirst of know-edge is occasioned by an unquenchable spark, and must be gratified, or will consume. Imagine not I sanction idleness, which oft asstmes the work of /genuis, but is not, cannot be allied to it. Inagine not that I e   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.        15 approved that morbid sensibility so oft mistook by its possessors for heaven-born genuis-by no means! But if the soul perceives with itself that active principle, which ease nor gain can satisfy; which almost overlooking common things, soars into the regions of sublime inquiry; and creative fancy gazing with eagle eye, even on the source of light-Oh! then let him who feels the heavenly guest obey its sacred voice-for I who have contended with its power, know that genuis is not to be subdued!  Let such a man resist the natural impulse he will feel, to yield his inclinations to the well-meant, but fatal advice even of parents. Let no commands, no tears, no supplications, even of another, bias him. Let sincerity be his guide, and firmness of mind his staff, and his pilgrimage will grow pleasanter in his progress-but if, to dry a momentary tear, or escape a momentary pang, he submits to smother genuis, he seals his own misery, and deceives, beside himself, his friends. William McFarland did so, and mark his history. "I waited on Mr. Arnold the grocer, and was received in a lit- tle room at the back of the shop, where Mrs. Arnold was sitting. They appeared plain, plodding sort of folks, remarkably neat in their dress and precise in their discourse. After a variety of questions, Mr. Arnold inquired if I were sensible of the importance of an interest in the merits and sufferings of my blessed Saviour. Imagination must describe the astonishment this question occasion- ed me. Mr. Arnold saw my surprise- "Well, well," said he, "I see you have not been brought up with a proper sense of your eternal welfare. It is a great mercy however,' that you have been directed to this roof where you will have the benefit of instruction and example in the right road. You may tell Mr. Collwell, (the name of my benefactor,) that I like you very much, and shall be ready to receive you toemorrow, and after a months' trial you may be bound." "Every necessary was provided fc:, me at Mr. Collwell's ex- pense, and I bade farewell, with a sigh, to my school and school companions. "I passed my month of probation. Night after night, as I laid upon the pillow, I meditated upon my situation; and strong was the struggle between what I esteemed my duty and my inclina- tion. , "Often would the swell of, independenoe elevate my mind to the contemplation of the most impracticable schemes. As of0te   16         THE LIME-KILN MAN, OR would a sense of gratitude to Mr. Collwell, as well as an implicit faith in his assurances that my (present almost intolerable) situa- tion would lead to future ease and comfort, baffling the sugges- tions of my romantic fancy. ' Thus were the embers of genuis and ambition dampened, and the powerful energies of a thinking mind depressed by the duties of a mean destination. The progress of my tale will show, that totally to extinguish the former or destroy the latter, is be- yond the power of circumstances, while the senses remain un- impaired. "As yet, sir, you have heard -nothing.!" have but just lifted the veil which seperates the present from the past. As it is forced up higher and higher, and the light of reason, is aided by the cursed memory of other and more happy days-you will hear all--I will reveal all."             \ Here the old man shook convulsively, the tears trickled down his furrowed cheeks, and-with an extended hand he said, e"Would to God, my story ended here," and after a brief pause he continued, "Bust, will you listen to me? Promise me, that you will; and though painful the task, my solitude shall be broken by the recital of a history overwhelmingly filled with sorrow, and which must soften even an adamantine heart." I shall never forget the deep anguish which beamed from his eyes, as he faintly articulated these words. And then, as if sud- denly seized by an inspiration, he concluded- "Meet me again to-morrow. Remember, four o'clock to-mor- row;' CHAPTER      III. A summer day drew near its close, when Harry was seen on his way to the rendezvous of his, now interesting old friend, the Lime Kn Man. He was received without scarcely being noticed, but was pointed to a seat, consisting of a board, one end of which rest. ed on the sill of the building, and the other on a block of wood.   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.       17 Harry obeyed, and sat in silence for some moments; the old man's eyes were fixed upon the ground, till at length he slowly raised his head, looked Harry steadilv in the face and said- "You are punctual, sir, and I doubt not, you are ready to hear me proceed with my sorrowful tale-or, as it could better be called, horrible experience; the thought of which alone, makes me shrink from the recital; but as I have promised, I must proceed. "The menial offices which my situation compelled me to per. form, at first, were galling to my pride; but I soon discovered it to be a false pride, and by degrees I became its master. I could stand behind the counter and weigh sugar without feeling the shame of a mean action; but I was often rousedfrom a reverie by my master, when I was weighing teas, and at the same time busily employed in the regions of fancy. " When the business of the day was ended my apartment was the kitchen, my companions a methodist old woman who was the servant, and her friend, a black cat, Here I might have regaled myself with reading, but unfortunately, the old lady's library con- sisting of the Pilgrim's Progress, the Holy War, and a volume or two of sermons, was at that time little'suited to my taste. The pious discourse of the old dame was still less pleasing; thus, too much fatigued for bodily employment-sleep, or meditation were my only. alternatives; and from these I was'frequently roused by ,the tabernacle hymns, to the time of which the old woman mended her stockings. "On Sundays I  regularly attended the church to which my mas- ter belonged, where I was compelled to hear doctrines, at which my blood chilled, and my heart grew faint. "The gloom of Calvanism, the disappointment of my first hopes, the conquest of my pride, the dull and cheerless life I led, in a short time so cooled the ardor of my mind, that, if it is too much to say that I was heart-broken, I was reduced to that state of mind which sees no. brightening prospect in futurity, and which, ceasing to hope, studies and struggles to endure. "Such was the state of my mind when with a trembling hand, I signed the indentures that consigned me for seven years to the gloom ofa cloister, without its consolations or tranquility "Mr. Arnold, previous to my being bound, had often hinted to me, that I was slow in business, and thinking of onething while I was doing another; and having once caught me in the attitude of   18         THE LIMEKILN MAN, OR study, leaning on a broom, with which I was sweeping the shop, he exclaimed: ' William, this wont' do; you seem more fit for a philosopher than a tradesman." "With this opinion, which was certainly a just one, Mr. Arnold ought not to have taken me as his apprentice. But Mr. Arnold was not a rich man; and Mr. Collwell had promised him a pre. mium of six pounds per annum. "From what I have related, you will readily conceive that I made but poor progress in the art and mystery of the grocery business ; and though cheerfully and willingly obeying my mas- ter in all his commands, I yet failed to please him; the natural consequence of a want of that energy in my business, of which in- clination must be the authority. t "I was more fortunate with my mistress. She was of a mild temper and humane disposition, and was -a strict Calvinist from sincere convictions. Superior to her husband in intellect, she would frequently, when opportunity offered, enter into conversa. tion, andI discovered an amiable heart. She was mistress of all the controversies upon theological topics, and felt great delight in confuting the arguments of the opponents of Calvin. "When you recollect that Mrs. Arnold's was the only conversa- tion I enjoyed, which embraced in any degree mental topics, you will not be surprised, that, notwithstanding it was religious, I es. teemed it highly, in short, I became delighted with these occasion- al recreations from the jargon of Twankay, Hyson, Black, Green, Hyson Skin-Java, Mocha, Maracaibo-St. Croix, Cuba, Musco- vado, Porte, &c. &c. "Still more delighted was I to hear her, while she qualified the doctrines and labored to reconcile the benevolence of the Creator withthe doom of the created, and the unborn. Her language was warm, her colorings exhibited the strongest lights and the darkest shades. She staggered my reason, opened new scenes to my view, and so far conquered my objections as to make me wish and pray that I could believe her creed. "She perceived the crisis, and gave me permission to take what books I pleased from her book case, which contained the whole element of Calvinistio divinity. Thus two or three years passed away, at the expiration of which, I had become a zealous Calvin- ist. "Power of the universe!-how I shudder, when I think upon   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUOEB       A9 the thousands, who at this hour, cherish iun their breast those horq rible ideas of Thee, which at that time formed my preed! 'I was about seventeen years old, when Mrs. Arnold, qne evening, was sent for in great haste tA visit a stranger who had. late- ly taken lodgings at the next door, and who was then at ,the point of death. ' This stranger was a man, who having obtained early in life the possession of a considerable estate, had given reins to his passions, and had indulged in every pleasure that a vitiated taste and;corrupt principles suggested. On the bed of sickness his heart smote him. "Chance led him to the house he was in, and' the landlord ;of that house was a strict dissenter of the same persuasion as Mr. Arnold, whose,sanctity and upright conduct had been frequently proclaimed in the hearing of th6 dying man. He requested to see him; derived a pleasing consolation from his discourses and pray- ers, and placed in his breast an ample confession of his crimes. "There was only one object living, for whom, in his present situation he felt any concern; and that was a daughter, the fruit of an unlawful intrigue in the West-Indies. "This daughter he had broqght up with the true affection of a father, having bestowed a very liberal expense upon her:educa- tion at a very eminent school in the vicinity of Edinburgh, where sheethen resided as a boarder. "For this daughter Captain Willis felt an increasing concern as his own end drew nearer. Himself grasping eagerly at the hopes and promises of eternal happiness offered to him by Mr. Arnold on the simple condition of believing; he became anxious that his Pauline should share the sam blessings, but which he now fully persuaded himself she would never taste, unless converted to the same faith with that which he' himself had embraced. "Such at length, was the -: confidence he reposed in Mr. 'Arnold, that he made a will, by which he bequeathed an entire and consid- erable propqrty and funds to his daughter, upon the express con- dition of her residing with Mr Arnold till her twenty-fifth year, or till her marriage with his consent. "The captain died. Miss Willis had visited him two or three- times at his lodgings, and was apprized of his intentions regarding her. A day was appointed for her removal, and I was ordered by my master to take a coach and bring Miss .Willis and her appur- tenances to her home that was to be,   O  .

Aiffetion truly: maternal glowed in the charming counte- nahice of the governess;: who threw her arms round the neck of her departingi charge, and burning tears of sensibility told her loss. Thle young ladies, her companions, saluted her with, a Warm and sincere affection, while even the youngest of the scholars clung to her, Kissing her hands, and twitchihg her robe, while- a buzz ran round the room, of ' Remember me Miss Willis-Pray, remem- ber mi  '  "] My native tdnderness was rising; but the gloomy principles I then nourished, checked every generous feeling of the heart, as allurermenits frminthe, love of heaven! "; Miss Wiliis at length burst from their embraces, and hurried into the coach. I 'itook my seat opposite her, and imprinted on my memory a face and form, never-no, never to be erased 1" The old man dropped his eyes to the ground, and drew a deep sigh?,and then starting up, as though he had remembered some. thing, said, t I will show you her image, a sketch token when we were both under out master's roof, ana when I indulged no thought but of her. It is not to artistic as it nfight have been, but is a correct And opening a little rough box, hoe presented before Harry a ppencUi sketch, and udder it wAs written--"Pauline Willis." While he was yviewing it, he thus continued, "She was not, perhaps, the most beautiful woman in the worid -her complexion,. when she left Jamaica as an infant, was rather tinged ,with anr orange hue; but her features were thb notices of those inmates of the female;heart, .which charm the soul of mamn- sweetness of temper, and conquering submission; whilst, the soft expressions of her eyes indicated the superior eultivation of an exquisite mind., She broke the silence of some duration by asking me if I was the son of Mr. Arnold, which led to several other questions; the result of which was a short description of-the family she was about to join, for which she expressed her thanks, though I saw the pain which the intelligence occasioned; her. I pass over her introduction to her guardian and M. Arnold, but must n6t omit to mention a conversation which took place in the evening, while I was assisting in unpacking some boxes inr;thE^   atrttamnt allotted for her eiamber. ThSBrwere :sofe shelVes in the closet--  "I am glad to see those shelves," said Miss Willis, for I have books enough to fill them." "Books-books!" exclaimed Mr. Arnold; " what books, child 7 Let me see-it's proper I should see what books you have." "Certainly, sir," was the reply, " though I flatter myself you will approve the sele eion, for they have reeeived; the approbation of my dear Mrs. Madison." "I dare say Mrs, Madison i; a good sort of moralwoman, but what are her religious sentiments,? Thoee is the impOrtait point." By this time I had untied the cord, and began placing the books upon the floor. Mr. Arnold took upl a volume, and opened it-- "What is this child, eh!--outlandish jargon, I take it. What is it 1" "It is'a system of geography in French, sir," replied Pauline. '"French! ah, well? it may be Dutch; or Greek, or Algebra, or anything else, for what I know, but I -must take this here book, and all them there, that I doh't understand myself-pack of non. sence, I dare say-but they'll cut up for the shop." "Oh, dear, sir," said Pauline, " you would not surely destroy my library!  If you do not approve of my reading FrenchlI pledge my word, I will not. But pray do not destroy the books, several of them are invaluable to me." "Pledge your word-yes, yes--pretty pledge enough, No, no --the safest way is to put it out of your power. I stand in a most awful situation, child. I shall have to answer for the great charge of your soul, that has been so providentially committed to my care; and nothing-shall you read that I do not understand." Pauline looked astonished, but Mr. Arnold did not notice her having laid his hand upon another book- "Mercy on us! here's a play book!" exclaimed he. "Did your Mrs. Madison know of this too?" ' O dear, yes sir; there are eight volumes of them-they are the immortal Shakspeare's." '"God forgive you, child! Immortal!--yes; he is, doubtifass; i "mmortal torments.   Here, William, take the immortal Shdil- peares away.'    -                ,   - THs LtMEKLU MAN, OB Poor Pauline trembled-Mrs. Arnold. saw her distress, and aid-  'You; should consider, my dear, Pauline has been brought up by worldly people; and though it is an infinite mercy that brought 'her to our. roof, there must be an inward change wrought in her before she can be brought to see the folly of her worldly wisdom." -How I blessed my mistress. She spoke my thoughts. Mr. Ar- nold made no reply, but proceeded with the true zeal of an in- quisitor.       ( Milton's Paradise Lost'! aye, put that on the0helfif you will," said he. "Gray's Poems, that you may take. But here, put all the rest up in the box, William, and carry them, for the present up to the loft; take a hammer and nail the box shut; I can't "stand looking now, JIve got something else to do. So child, If you want books to read ax Mrs. Arnold, and she'll put what's proper into your hands'; though I think the needle suits best of week days; and on the Sabbath you may read the bible." ' Surprise, regret, and something like anger, mingled their influ. ence in the mind of Miss Willis, and a tear stood quivering in her eye. I obeyed:so much of my master's orers as to carry the box Into the loft, and intended to finish my commission when I went to my chamber, which was one story lower than the loft. But, O, sovereign gehuis-invincible power-inextinguishable spark:- then, again thy smothered embers blazed! Taking my candle and my Jammer, I ascended to the loft, I placed my candle on the floor, and was about to drive the nail, when a sudden impulse of curiosity seized my arm. "Suppose," thought I, "I just look over these books." 1 They are profane," said Calvin; " they are the productions of men -destitute of the enlightened spirit of God, and may tend to draw your affections from holy things." "Only one peep," cried curiosity, perhaps I may meet some old acquaintance that I have forgotten; for it was full three years since I had looked into any book, save the theological labors of calvinists. Down I dropped upon my knees. "If it be a sin, God forgive it; if it is a temptation, Lord deliver me." I opened the box, trembling; I took up a volume and opened it. Jt was a volume of Shakspeare, and the passage that caught my eye was the speech of Porti on mercy, in the Merchant of Yenice, Act IV, Scene first.   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUnE.       23: As I read, my heart grew warm.: as I proceeded, it grew warmer; and when I came to the line- '"It Is an attribute to God himsel=f6 it literally glowed within me. This speeeh had been my favorite at school, and I had spoted it a hundred times. It brought to my recollection another, for which I eagerly searched and found in the same volume- ' To be ornot to be, that is the question :- whether 'is Wnobler in the mind To suffer the stings and arrows of outrageous fortune," A&. My spirits seemed to have gained a deliverance from fetters: my heart beat quicker than for a long time past; and I went on devouring the contents of the box with as much appetite as a hun- gry man would a dinner. I tasted every dish that presented it. self, and found each a dainty. Nearly at the bottom of the box was a volume of Walter Scott.   Conceive the interest I felt; and judge my regret when I heard the clock strike three, and saw the approaching departure of my light, which glim. mered in the socket of the candlestick. I found my way to bed in the dark;- but sleep was far off. The Spring of reason, that had been compressed to impotence by bigotry, seemed by this accident to have recovered its activity, and once more resumed its operations. O superstion; how great- ly to thy prejudice-        .           '  I recollected the scene in Miss Willis' chamber. I placed be- fore my fancy the ignorant piety of my master, and the profane intelligence of his ward. Hdared even to: trace the origin of their principles, I did more, I inquired, if it was, a consistent idea, to  suppose a benificent Creator would grant a'special light to a few t of his creatures, By which they only should be guided to eternal bliss; while the multitude are doomed to wander throngh a dark  passage to the precipice of everlasting woe t And' when I ad mi; quired--I blushed I ,Mmmmgmm,   TA LmE-KILN MA2, on CHAPTER IV, Various were the emotions wnich agitated the mind of Harr as he strolled towards the Lime-Kilns.

I looked forward with impatience to the termination of my set. titude, when I imagined, I should burst upon the world as a prod. iy of genuis. The hours of pleasure which were heretofore gloomily spent in reading the horrors of Calvinism, were now em. Voyed in perusing vrarious authors, or in the composition of verses. The subject of my verses of course, was my Pauline.

Still, we did not- give up; if a little deceptive tale would not do--stratagem must --so we gave up our p r6ject altogether in the sight of the old wo- man, and as evening amea  on, we retired seperately as if going to our chambers-but it was quit' the opposite we were soon to- gether; after we were safe from intrusion; from the old dame, and had arranged a cord and passed it out of the window of Pauline's room, I sprang out and slid gently down, and after. me came Pau. line in a-similar manner.

In lifting my hands to my head,. I found I had been bled. The people around me stared in my face, and at one another, but made no reply to my questions.

Every one appeared to be running after some object that occupied his mind, and brought emolument to himself. ' And where shall I go? sighed L "In Chambers street I met a mob, dragging a poor wretch to justice, who had been detected in picking a pocket. I mingled with the crowd to hear the examination."  "What means have you of getting a livelihood X" said the Mag- istrate. The culprit was silent. "Why then, to save you from the gallows, I shall send you for a soldier."  "What means have you of getting a livelihood!" rung in my ears. I traversed street after street. Often would I check my- self with the question-' what means have I of getting a liveli- hood?' Where am I going .? ,Not to my father, mother, sister, or -brother; these are unmeaning sounds to me! Not to my home- even that cheering sound, which delights the poorest, was 'but a mockery to me. Then darted across my mind-yes, let me own it-your image, Pauline. I saw, at that moment, the utter im- possibility of your ever being mine-nay, bear with me a mo- ment! I saw you given to some rich old idiot, whose bigotry might please old Arnold; and I almost cursed existence .?  ' "Just then the martial sound of fife and drum struck mv ears.

The Lieutenunt beingi my friend, by his interest I obtained a discharge from my rash engagement, and Pauline and myself were shortly after married. Mr. Brooks continuedthe friendly rook on which we built our little bower of bliss. His counsel directed, his benevolence aided, his generosity mufhificently remunerated our labors. He was en- gaged in a very extensive concern, and found us abundant employ. Pauline wrote a novel, which succeeded well. We published jointly a volume of poetry; and we:mutualy labored at transla. tions. Competence was the sweet reward of our labors, supplying us; with all the inecessaries, and many of the decent luxuries of life; we resided in a-small but neat cottage at- Brigallen; only visiting the city occasionally, The life I then led was the very reality 'of that picture which imagination had taught my youthful bheart to doAt upon; and yet possessing this reality, Iwasnbt :content. When literary compo- sitions became the means of fmy subsistence, I found it irksome ; I .faned/.it amean employ of talent: taolet it outfor hire: I grw   dissatisfied; I formed 'a valety of new schemes, which alternately delighted 'ando disgusted me. A period, however, approached, which compelled me to submit to the irksomeness, and even meanness (as I deemed it,) of my employment.

As secretary of\this society, my house became a sort of rendez- vous for its members. My Pauline and I were delighted at our good fortune in this respect as it-offered us many hours of rational amusement in the conversation with men of taste and educa- tion. My brother's business was that of a painter. His person was a composition of manly beauty; a countenance expressive of the most tender sympathies.; his manner was engaging, his converse truly :captivating. -Wei delighted in his company, and ,he seemed to receive an equal satisfaction in ours.

Just as the sun of pros- perity was ascending the meridian, and his , beams had gilded a wide and beauteous landscape of enchanting hopes, a little sable cloud sprung up, and iioated in a corner of the hemisphere. It sailed towards my dwelling. It swelled as it drew nearer; it in. creased till the sun. was hidden from my sight, and then descend- ing, burst upon my head, o'erwhelming all prospects of the hopes I had beheld, and left me nothing to contemplate, save the frightful desolations of despair! To dwell as little as possible upon a subject that shakes every nerve with horror at its remembrance, know then, young man, that this pretended moralist, this zealous friend, this smooth speeched brother, proved himself a consumate villain. He came to our dwelling, and found:peace, innocence and love, its inmates; he saw as fond a pair as Natnre ever designed for each other's happiness. What, then, was that principle that could excite within his breast the horrid pulpose, the execrable, vile design to mar such bliss? With the dissembling visage of benevolence, he must have borne a heart that languished for the muder of his species; or how could he deliberately have planned the destruction of one of Nature's noblest works!

This was conviction: and all the powers of my reason fell beneath the impulse of revenge,. My hand instinctively grasped a dagger that was near me. I rushed into the room, and aiming a justs reward at the seducer's heart, the cursed villain shrunk from my vengeance, and it fell on the poor, lost Pauline!  The coward fled, and I was discovered kneeling by my bleeding wife, the fatal weapon still buried in her breast. In'that moment of agony I, know not what occurred. I was dragged by force from the body, and confined, in my own house, under the care of some medical gentleman. )  In a few days my senses returned, and I was able to give some account of the horrible transaction ; which being corroborated by the circumstance of Knox MO]farland's flight, the coroner's jury  returned a :verdict of accidental death, and the remains of my poor Pauline were interred.                   t Though I was not then deemed a madman, my reason had sus- tained a shock it never has perfectly recovered. .       r When I looked back upon the happiness I had enjoyed, and gazed h upon the dreadful wreck around me, my blood now chilled to ice- P now flowed like burning lava through my veins--and mny affright- 1 ed reason fled, at the horrid view.

I placed my daughter under the care of a respectable person in le neighborhood, and made an ample provision for her education, ad, in case I should never return, had left her the whole of her other's fortune. I supposed Knoxhad gone to America, and I determined to low.  I shipled at London on board a merchant shio. Fair nds wafted us onward at a lively pace.

I thought my r knew me as he stood over me, and had saved me, only to r more satisfactory death than seeing me sink beneath the   38        THE IIMBE-KILN MAN, OR- waves. I looked him in the face and was on the point of gra-p ing him, and cursing him, when I bethought me that he did not re- cognize me, from my extreme thinness caused by a troubled mind. I refrained from speaking to him. The other prisoners I knew would be with me in any scheme I might devise to escape, or to revenge myself of the wrongs he had so unscrupulousy done me. I kept my raging passions down, and by degrees got in the con- fidence of the crew. I at length thought that I had quite a num- ber of friends on board, and so they proved to be. I told them my secret, and they sympathised with me, and said they did not like him as their commander,-and would cut his throat if I would take his place.  " That task be mine,"' said I. X I owe him that for a better cause than you do. Say you agree to it, and this night is his last." They agreed that their captain should die, and urged that I should take his place. Night came. It was a beautiful night. The bright moon was peeping through the broken clouds, and not a breeze was stirring. Knox had been ondeck admiring the beauties of nature, and had unconsciously sat himself down against a gun carriage and fallen asleep. This I was not slow to see, and as soon as he was dozing, with dagger in hand, I advanced with some of my friends near me, and cautiously walking on my knees till I could reach the spot I wished, I poised my dagger more sure than I did the first time it was aimed at him. And then the-blow, sent its cold point cutting to his heart. I fell back in hysterics, at my soul's satisfaction, of having at last acomplished the prominent wish of my heart. He was tumbled,into the sea without form or ceremony, and I was chosen as their commander. We cruised about several weeks but accomplished little, and at length were chased ashore by a man-of war, on a little island. Both vessels were crushed to, pieces as they struck on the rocks of the island. Few of the crews of either saved themselves. When all, were ashore that could be found, there proved to be four--three of the pirate's men, and one of the man-of-war. Raised to a high state of excitement by relating the foregoing scenes, McFarland arose from his seat, and began, walking to and fro, withont saying a word, but groaning in a manner that made Harrvr feel unomfortable, and he arose and quitted the place un- so  *"j . ,               .     perceived by MoFarland; but before he got out of hearing he heard him say-- "What! has he gone I why did he not wait until I had further relieved my troubled memory."

"Whilst I was residing at Brigallen," said McFarland, when Harry again visited him," I became much attached to a child, whose parents lived a few doors from me; he was somewhat older than my daughter, and possessed that show ofbeauty and elegance, seldom witnessed in a person so young. His parents were wealthy, and liberally contributed towards his education. A  fancy would often come to me that I should be happy in my older days to see my little one wedded to a man such as he prom- ised to be. I, one day, when he was busily engaged in playing with my little girl, sat by my Pauline, and said to her. It Pauline would you not be satisfied if you could see our girl grow to be a woman, and marry a man like Charles!" "That, indeed, would be a blessing," said Pauline, " but how sadly may we be disappointed if we indulge in a hope like this." "But can we not train them to love each other?" said I, " and when they arrive at a marriageable age they will think of nought but each other." "' True, with the love of a brother and sister," replied Pauline; "but the love of lovers, is quite different: 'it is not a flower that grows on the dull earth; springs by the calender; must wait for sun-for rain; matures by parts-must take its time to stem, to leaf, to bud, to blow. It owns a richer soil, and boasts a quicker seed! You look for it, and see it not; and lo! even while you look, the peerless flower is up, consumate in the birth!'" Little did I dream that my happiness was so soon to be wretch- edness; even there the evil spirit was lurking near: but thought I, then, a brother could be so heartless, as to make miserable, one who has always been his warm-hearted friend and assistant?   40         THE LIME-KILN MAN, 0R But, we will leave these too well-remembered scenes, and re- treat to the island on which I was wrecked as a captain of a pirate ship.! I was in the South Atlantic ocean, near the trade line from the Cape of Good Hope, though so far from that line, as. never to be in the way of any trading vessel unless driven out of its course by a storm. The island was one of rocks, with here and there a small oasis, or level portion, which' was very fertile. When I reached the island, no other was yet there, but soon two of my comrades stood by me; we could do nothing to save the lives of the rest of the crew, as ,the heavy sea then run. ning, beat madly towards the beach.. After we had been there some hours, we saw a man coming, tumblng about on the mad waves, and was thrown up near us, by a heavy breaker, which retired and left one of the crew of the man. of-war with us: we kept our station till near night when we be- gan to thinkof ra place to sleep, or at least to rest. We started to find some shelter, but-to our surprise, foundourselves on a small island, entirely uninhabited. We returned to the beach where we had landed; and now the storm had increased to a gale, and brought large portions of the ship ashore, besides some of the. stores, These were all taken careeof by us; in this occupation the whole night was spent. Morning came with a calm, and found us pros- trate with fatigue. After securing all the provisions we could find along the beach, we all started to explore the island, and see where we were. The day passed and found us again at head quar- ters. All felt discouraged; ho sign of a habitation, or of a living, human being exhibited itself on the whole island. After a con. sultation'was held, we determined to build a- hut and - take our chance of hailing a passing vessel. The first few weeks we spent in looking continually for a sail, but not one was to be seen ; the thought of starvation began to come upon us; our provisions were disappearing, and no source from whence to replenish our stores; we began looking over our provision barrels, and amongst them found two-filled with potatoes, and one filled with whole corn. These we immediately determined to plant, as we had several beautiful plots, and we doubted not the fertility of the soil from the luxuriant growth of grass and shrubbery upon it. Our water casks were being emptied at a rapid rate, and water we could not do without, so in one of these spaces, between two rocky ledgeNs "we dug a well, and to our agreeable surprise found water.

Poetry was my  favorite style then, and as I had not the  material to complete anything very   voluminous.

The third year had almost made its course, when one fine day, as were arranging our gardens, a dispute arose between us, and from words it canme to blows; we clenched and came to the ground; and in that position I killed him! Poor fellow, I was sorry for what I had done, after my passion had abated, for I was now alone in my little world. I now had no one to provide for me, or I for any-one, but lived from day to rday in my garden, or was seated in my favorite haunt, pencilling some sketch, or composing some verses. Every view I could get on the island, I had faithfully committed to my slatei beneath each one writing a descriptive couplet. I had given up all hope of ever being rescued, and therefore made myself as comfortable as circumstances would permit. The climate was warm the year round, and thus I was saved from per- ishing, when my clothes became worn out. In this manner nine years passed away and still left me the sol- itary being of the island. A had in this time contrived and con- structed a sort of boat, with which I went out to fish-an occupa- tion I often amused myself with, having procured some fishing tackle from the wreck. I was one day seated on a high bluff, watching the foaming breakers, as they tossed with mad ferocity upon the beach; and casting my eyes to windward I beheld a ship just rising into the horizon, and appeared to be driving with might and main before the gathering storm direct for the Island. It cheered me; my heart leapt with joy at the thought of a hu. =an being within sight. I quickly hoisted from the highest point my signal of distress, though I could scarcely expect it to be no- ticed in consequence of the storm that was coming fast upon them. They neared the island, and yet bore steady for it; they appeared not to heed the danger they every moment were approaching. I was happy at the thought that they should be wrecked, and that I might once more behold the face, and hear the voice of a living human being,       . They still bore direct for the land, and in a moment more, a crsh was heard-the masts fell to the deck; the. bow of the ship was run high on the rocks while the stern sunk precipitately be- neath the waves; boats appeared to be in readiness for the shock, in they, immediately. emerged from the crushed vessel filled with mon. As they neared the shore, I perceived that they were all wamed to the teeth with swords, pistols, axes, spears, cutlasses, 4.         ,  , *  v '   -u VIUwTIM OVf MSFORTUNE.      43- &ce I began to fear for my life-I took them for pirates-and then I thought I was nothing more or legs when I was driven there, and they would perhaps for that reason sympathize with They  hded, and after watching the beating fo pieces of their ship for some time, they began to look about for entertainment, I took courage and started to meet thym ; they saw mne approach and stopped to await my coming; T stepped up to the one I took for their leader and spoke 'to him, and the answer I got was a shake of the head. 4He could not understand me. Their dress and features at once told mre that they were Chinese. However, hle pointed toa woman they had with them, and made signs that I should talk with her. I addressed her, and was answered if tones that again suddenly brought to my distracted recollection, my Pauline. She was beautiful, and evidently of a first-class family of Europe. I asked her how she came to be in the hands of such ruffians, and her answer was- ", with two others of my sex, were all that were spared from the remorseless deathinflicted upon them, by this band of outlaws and robbers; we were taken on board their ship about two weeks ago, and were treated like brutehs. A fesw days after that a ves- vel came  in view which proved to be an English man-of-war. Theyv gave chase; but the pirate being a smpart- sailer, kept the dis. tance between them  about the same; the chase Was kept up for several days; sometimes the vessels would barely be- in sight of. each other, and at others they were almost within hailing distance. One night a  gale sprung up and it was very dark; the pirate shift- ed his course from north-West to south-west, and when morning came, not a  sign of the pursuers were to be seen; a calm succeed- ed, and left us laying motionless on the water, and while there, a strong breeze brought in sight the same  man-of war from the niorth-west. All sail was set but to no purpose; before the breeze reached the pirate, her pursuers were close upon her; but when her broad canvass caught the wind she stood away like a sea bird, and was chased, with the pursuers in sight until yester- day, when the watch discovered. this island, A consultation: Was held by the leaders and they determined, if the chase was keptup to run the vessel ashore, and thus, you see me a captive of a gang of lawless ruffians.

The tender chords of:my heart were touched with sympathy for the lady, and I determine4 if possible to rescue her from the hands of such wretche ,though I could scarcely make myself be- lieve I was any better than themselves. I left them and retired to my own home, which was now a cave in the rocks, the entrance of which was quite small, but afforded plenty of room inside. I began to devise a plan to effect theescape of the lady from those she so much detested. I at length hit upon a plan, I thought their ignorance would not detect. CHAPTER VII. Several days passed, sfter the wreck of the 'pirats, and my haunt was yet unknown to them, although my gardens had fallen a prey to their ferccious appetites. By stratagem I obtained a meeting with:the lady, and gave her instructions how to act. She possessed the confidence of her masters, and was therefore, free to go where she pleased. ,On a fixed day, was to go into opt eration the plan I had suggested. I went as usual to visit them, and found them much disturbed at the -disappearance of their prisoner; search began to be made; I of course helped them, and' at last repaired toothe beach, and surewenough,%agreeable to our arrangement there found a slate on which were written these words-- U I have found it impossible to' escape with life, from a gang of thieves and murderers, andito rid myself of their infernal b haviour towards me, I here bury myself beneath the, briny Wb I took it and read it to them; and, interpreted it by signs.

I went to a place appointed, and there found the English girl anxiously wait- ing for me- She thanked me again and again as we walked towards my cave'. But, now the point I had aimed at was gained; how was I to secrete my prize from these insolent villians? Should they discover that their prisoner was in my possession I would meet an immediate and horrible fate, as well as the one I had rescued from their insolence. After arriving at the cave, we had a cool and deliberate, discussion, and at length determined to keep them in ignorance, as long as it could possibly be done, and should they gain a knowledge of the lady's existence, to resist every attempt to regain her, even if it resulted in death to us both. The night was passed, and the sun again lit up the heavens with its beautiful crimson. I felt inspired with new life and vig- or. Iwas happy at the thought of speaking and being answered- not by an echo, but by the real voice ofa fellow being. I dared not allow Ellen--as she called herself, outside the entrance of the cave, for fear of a discovery by her persecutors. I ventured out, and looked around; none of the Chinese were to be seen. I told Ellen we were safe from being discovered then, and brought her out to enjoy the prospect with me. No sooner had she a view of the ocean than she exclaimed- "A sail! do you not see a sail!" and pointing in the direction, she fell upon her knees, and imploringly looked to heaven. And then again she steadily gazed upon the approaching vessel. It was yet a great way ff, and kept bearing to the left of us., I hoisted my signal of distress, and it was noticed, and immediAtely she bore down upon us. As she neared, Ellen cried out, ("We are at last safe. It is the same good ship that tried so hard to catch these assassins when they were free on the ocean." "Let us repair immediately to the beach," said I, "that we may not be detained, should any of them find us.' We went to-my boat which lay in the edge of the water, in -a little eddy; and was then half a mile from where the ship had an- chored. We seated ourselves, and I was pushing out towar;ds the ship with a light heart when happening to look to our right I no- tibed that the Chinese had not only discovered the ship, but us; and was giving chase to rescue their prisoner. Their boats were of a regular build and consequently were fast gaining on us, I hav. ing but one paddle, and they four to. each boat. Life or death   A4P         THE LIME-KILIN MAN, OR Was on either side of us; we felt safe if we could reach the ship in time to shield ourselves, from the merciless Chinese who had been so completely duped. We were anxiously watched from the ship, and as soon as the motives of our flight became apparent to those on board, they seemed interested to the greatest extent in behalf of the little craft bearing the pursued. As we neared the ship, we were but just out of reach of the savage Chinese, and the next moment would have been certain death, when to our great relief and un- bounded joy, we saw'-the pirates fall back, and turning to the ship, we found the cause to be a rather savage looking muzzle staring them in the face, from a port-hole that had been thrown open. The captain beckoned us on, and we were soon handed up the side of the English ship, and well provided for. ' After taking some refreshments, I was questioned in regard to the circumstances that brought me on the island; also about the Chinese, and after hearing tmy story as you have heard it, two boats were dispatched filled with men, to capture these felonious butchers.  The boats disappeared behind the promontory, where a short time before, the pirates had retreated. An hour's suspense, and I was satisfied at seeing them re-appear with the savage looking devils with them-not all, however, alive. A stout:resistance had been offered, and before they would surrender4,wo of their num. ber were shot down. They were all well taken care -of, and the ship weighed anchor and bore leisurely away to the northwest. The weather was fine, and the conversations I had with the crew, had in a few days almost driven sorrow and past recollections from me. The lady too, whose benefactor I hyd been, was ever ready to soothe and interest me, till indeed she became ny fayor- ite companion. I would sometimes forget that I was on boar&a  ship, and thought myself atmy beautifil littlehome atBrigallen, but such dreams were not to be indulged in--reality only aggravated the already lacerated wound, and made me shrink from human sight when the true picture would force itself upon my view. One day, about two months after I was taken aboard, as I was pacing the deck, turning over in my mind the real and the imagiq i nary, a voice from mast head sang out- L anid ho!"  "Where away V" shouted the captain.   THE VICTIM OF M ORTUNOE.        47 On larboard quarter," was the reply. "Let her drive, we are nearinghome boys," said the captain. I immediately applied to the chart and found we were passing Cornsore Point, Ireland. My heart leaped with joy, when I thought myself so near my native home. Liverpool was our desti- nation, where we arrived safe. The- English lady was soon on her way for London, the place of her nativity! and after seeing the Chinese pirates properly taken care of, I too, took my leave and started in the opposite di- rection for Edinburghl, where I arrived in due time. But I could scarcely remember Fe place-change upon change had been wrought. The first object that brought to my mind other days was the old theatre. It still stood, and it seemed but a day or two, since the catastrophe that so materially altered the course of my life, happened before its doors. I pondered a mo- ment, thinking whether I should enter, and witness the perform- ance of the tragedy  of Hamlet, which was to be rendered that evening by a celebrated artist; or if it would best become a pa- rent, to first greet his child. I shuddered at the thought of again attempting to approach the door of the theatre, and therefore resolved to see my daughter at the home of her adoption, as sood as I could be carried there. i procured a conveyance and was directly on my way to my once happy, but now cheerless home.  The night was passed in travel. ing, and before day-break, I was set down in front of the village inn at Brigallen, I took a room but could get no rest; my for- mer troubles came back upon me with redoubled weight, and I could do nothing but walkIthe floor, until thehour came when I could be admitted to see my Elinor, the only object in the world for whom my. heart felt a glowing interest. She often started to the vision of my  memory, and impressed me with the dreadful antici- pation of her fate in such a world of treachery and woe. I left my  room, and the first person I saw I asked in regard to my   daughter, when to my horror I was told-- The old man's eyes filled with tears, and utterance was not in his power. After regaining his self-command, he continued- As I was going to say I was told she had eloped about a fort- night before! Any attempt to describe my  feelings at this intelligence were vain. I  reproached myself as the uthor of her guilty fate, in hav ing abandon ed her education to strangers.  * ts '    48         THE LIME-KXL1N MAN, OR 'A severe illness followed this intelligence, which threatened my dissolution. 'Every effort; to discover her, proved unavailing, where she was, or whether' she existed at all, I knew not. As soon as it was known that I was in, the village I was visited by some of my friends, and amongst them' was young Randall, my former little friend, and the often anticipated bride-groom of my daughter; he knew me, and informed me of the particulars of the affair ; which are of too great length and too little interest to tell you now. Kind friends and strict attentions soon revived my spirits to an extent that would allow me to exercise and walk out.,  The hollow sound of revenge! again sounded in my ears, loud- er than before, and I at length yieided, and determined to blast the traitor from earth, could I but trace, him and discover him. I started for London, where I arrived safe, aud after spending some time in searching boarding house lists, I almost despaired of ever seeing-my sweet child again, when one day I was informed by an acquaintance I had made, that there was to be a masquerade that evening and that a general invitation had been tendered to all who wished to attend. I immediately prepared myself for the oc- casion. My dress was that ;of a Hermit. As I entered the hall, remarks were passed in regard to the oddness of my dress and manners. "Does any one know him? does any one know him?9 was buzzed about the room. I recognized among their voices one I had heard before; It was Charles Randall.  -"The man should be confined," said a tall man dressed as a Monk, "he must absolutely be mad." "Somebody had better take care of him," cried a lady in the vest of a Nun; " he may commit some mischief." "Its excessively unpleasant to be so bored with his sermons," said a swarthy lord. "Insects, away!"I cried, in a voice Charles immediately recog- nized. "Insects, away!--ye flies of fashion!-ye fluttering noth- ings!-Devoid of thought-caprice impels, or folly leads your steps. Leave me-leave me to my own reflections--aye-can *you laugh!,-Grin on--'tis'Levity's meridian now, and this the paraldise of Folly!

'How will you meetthe herald of your dissolutions, who have nyver fostered-the unfortun- ate, or sympathized with the miserable' di the:dying!" Charles had stood silently observing what passed, but when I and the crowd had passed him,: he exclaimed- "'Good Heavens; the last man in the world I should have ex- pected to meet at a masquerade,!"  I presently spoke to Charles, and we left the place together, without any information as to the whereabouts of my daughter, more than a repetition from my young friend that she was un'- doubtedly in London. CHAPTER     VIII. Charles Randall had' been well educated, and possesesd a talent for a more elevated calling than a me're book-keyper. But such was his 'father's notion, and consequently, Charles was sent to Lon- ion to be made a merchant of. For the first-time, Chailes entered the metropolis--for the first time, breathed the fashionable air of Portland Pi,  where Mr. Robinson-Charles' employer-resided. From  the .adount Charles' had received, of the meanness and avarice of traders, from an old acquaintance at home, he was not a little surprised to observe the' elegant appearance of Mr. Robin- son's residence. ,",His astonishment increased, when, upon admis- sion into the hall, he was surrounded by four or five stout, tall fellows' i blue and silver, large buitihes of flowers in their bosoms and white cambric handdkerchiefs in their hands. The youth Was absolutely confused, and felt some difficulty in persuading these gettlmeft of thec ceremoiiies to proCe him an: auience with Mr. Robinson, whoo was 9entertaining :the ca/inetminsters that evening at dinner, at his oWnh table.: '    '   '   50         TEE GIB KINT MAUNP, O90 They c0ndescended, however atlength, to show him to a parlor, where, in about an hour afterwards, Mr. Robinson came to him, Ch!arles having sent in his name. " Instead of the merchant of the old school Charls expected to meet, Mr. Robinson was a man of elegant deportment, and dress- ed in the extreme offashion.  He entered the room in a style so commandingly, yet easy, that his presence bespoke: the most accomplished manners. "I am extremely concerned, sir,' said he', "very particular peo- ple are with Ine to-day-, and prevent my receiving you more agree- ably with my wishes, and the respect due to a nephew of Sir Wil- liam Randall.- Allow me, however, to cangratulate youuponyour g safe a'rrival, and to introduce' you to Mrs. Robinson, and her daughters.         ' Charles apologized for his appearance, and would fain hsive avoided the introduction C "O, by no means," said Mr. Robinson, ringing-." In what part of the house is your mistress," said he to the servant who ap- peared. "The ladies have drove down to the Pavillion this morning, sir, and will not return untill to-morrow." "That is unfortunate indeed, but you will excuse me, I am sure; we shall be better acquainted soon, and apologies will become un. necessary, William, serve dinner in this room to my friend, Mr. Randall, and telithe butler to bring what wine he orders." With a cordial shake of the hand, Mr. Robinson left his young frienid to a soliloquy, full of wonder, at the scenes before him. The manner in which he was received tastonished him. Cabinet ministers dining with a merchant was a novelty to him; but more strange than anything else, appeared to him the idea of a,man pot knowing whether his wife and daughters, were at home, or in the country,        , .,   , '  ' A profuse dinner was served up, consisting, of every delicacy that the season afforded, and in a style of elegance beyond every- thing Charles hadpever seen, It wasmiear ten o'clock, when he had finished his sumptuous dinner; and about eleven, he retired, but pleasing recollections would not let him slep.;          . From the spimqns he hd seen that day, Charles was prepare to. expect a very; different ,8style of living, frnom that which .he had anticipated in the country, and such wasz;the reality,    THE VICTIM 0'F MSFORTUNE.       51 RIe was established in Mr. Robinson's house in the capacity, rather of a private secretary than a clerk. Instead of being ;on. fined from an early hour in the morning till late at night, in post- ing ledgers, and copying invoices, as his uncle had taught him to' expect, and as was the case with all merchant's clerks Whe: he -was in the'trade, Charles found that the sons or nephews of mert chants who threw a capital into the firm, underwent no such drud- gery, which is consigned- to boys who had learned to write' fine hands at charity schools. This leisure for a considerable time was also solitude to Charles who had refused several invitations to visits for the vulgar reason of not liking the party.  A well stored library was his usual lounge after dinner; and in the evening he amused himself with music; or drawing; and occa. sionally in attempts at poetry, of which he was fond to excess. The library of Mr. Robinson comprised an assemblage of liter. ature in all its branches, and the privilege, of aceess to such a store was, perhaps the greatest happiness Charles had ever expe- rienced.  :I ving one afternoon finished reading the life of the unfortua. ate CQaitterton, he was detected in tears, by the servant who brought himr his tea and the evening papers. Charles hastily snatched up the newspaper to conceal his emo' tica, and casthis eyes rapidly over its contents.  While his heart beat indignant at the fateof Chatterton, a para. graph presented itself, in which the enormous sums paid in one s(eon to Didelot and his wife for dancing at the opera were enu. merated.                   ' , "Good God!" he exclaimed, when left- to himself, ," how small s portion -of this wealth might have saved to England, and t the 'orld, another Milton!"e 'His ardent mind pursued the melanbholy thought, andhe penned ,he following sonnet-      - "SBlush-blush'ye groit! to hear the frequaet gh,' Depair xtort s friom may a Briton'y. brest- Ipire dby Genui, ind by want deprest,  Whose life i,pmiery-whose hiope-to die  W^hilst in your gorgeous' teatres ; behold; ".  *. :From oelgn siore s a( pantomimie band , .

This latter suspicion aroused the jealous resentment of the but- ler, and the whole coTs of domestics resolved upon a war of inso- lence against him, which, however, the engagig suavity of his manners soon converted into the homage of grateful respect. New senes now opened. The reign of dissipatio n commenced for the season by the arrival of C Irs. Robinson and her daughtersh Charles was introduced by M, Robinson. "Lord, child," said Mrs..Bobinson,'* you can't think how ex- cessively I've been longing to see you, ever since I knew. of your arrival.

Feeling my way up two pair of dark stairs, I entered a miserable apartment. The walls had once been white-washed, but were now covered withsmoke and dirt. A dull light was admitted through a small casement, darkled by pieces of old rags stuffed in several/ places where the glass was broken.

'4' I had saved up about a crown, but that I know'd wouldn't last long; and as I could do no washing for the other girls while I tended her, there was nothing coming in; and so I was obliged to apply for her to be removed to the hospital, where she was to have gone this morning; but,: last night she changed so for the worse, I thought it cruel to move her and as she wantea onlya little moisture in her mouth I said I'd tend her till she was .re- leased, and they might send for a coffin--' "'No--no' I exclaimed, ' I will provide what's wanting now. Perhaps an earlier meeting might have saved her life.' "She was decently interred. The good Mrs. Andrews was re- warded. Good, I call her, for whatever in her youth she may have been, she now possesses a heart that wills all good imagina. ble to her fellow creatures. "Thus far I had acted upon the presumption of her being my child. There was a little doubt upon the point indeed; but still it was not certian; a circumstance took place that confirmed me more in doubting than believing. I applied to the woman who so inhumanly thrust her,from the house, for information, but she could - give me none. There was a trunk of her's she said in her posses- sion, which upon paying what was owing I might receive. She believed it was full of letters. "I eagerly consented; and, upon opening the trunk, found it, as she said full of letters. Among them was a bundle written in a female hand. J untied the bundle, and found the letters signed "Elinor." They were compositions of uncommon merit as to style and manner, but the matter though ingenious, was highly exceptionable. 'This circumstance staggered me extremely. That the letters :were written by my-daughter, is beyond a doubt. They had been sent under cover, and began "Dear Friend," but no address was ,upon them. "The only conjecture, then, that can reconcile the deceased's having these letters, written by herself in her possession is, that   THE VICTIM 0o MSFOrt  .     -  ' 59 'they have'been returned from the person to whom they were written.'" "It may be so,"'said Charles; -' but surely it is not too much to hope, that the deceased, after all, was the friend who resided with your daughter; and that she herself may yet be living." "Not for the wealth of worlds would I change the certainty of her death for such a torturing suspense. No-no, I will cherish the thought of having laid her in the silent grave though it be a '  delusion. "Come with me-come I'll show you the spot where she lies. I'll repeat to you the story of her sufferings: for, O, young man, - n   such a house as this, these lessons are not common. The riot, the mirth, the glitter of guilt alone, you behold here. Come-- come to the abodes of the dying, and the graves of the' dead and learn its certain consequences. And we started-together." CHAPTER X. A  few days after my visit, and while the Robinsons were yet at the pavillion, Randall received the following letter-- 'Sir, It is with extreme reluctance that an unhappy stranger obtrudes herself upon your notice. The forms of society do not so strongly condemn me as the emotions of my own proud heart, but adversity weakens, even where it does not Conquer pride-and I  have known adversity. "Though perfectly unknown to you now, as an acquaintance, I hope you will not spurn the  fortunfortunate. It is indeed, almost too much to solicit the favor of a visit, though they tale I am corn- pelled to relate, I should be unwilling to trust on paper. I will venture, then, to beg one hour of your time, whenever it can be best spared from more cheerful occupations, to listen to the dis- tresses oft "Sir,  "Your most obedient servant, ELINOR   iMAION .

E M   9O        TTHE LIMB-KILN MAN, OR Curiosity and compassion, were awakened by this letter in the breast of Randall. Repeatedly and distinctly, he read its con tents. There was distress, yet delicacy peculiarly blended in its phraseology-then in the warmth of his first impressions, he was going immediately to Berners. street; but the impropriety of such a step soon occurred to him. This incident occupied his entire thoughts-he formed a variety of conjectures, formed his conduct according to the suppossed -cases, and as speedily renounced his imaginations as absurd. That the purport of this visit was to afford him an opportunity of displaying his generosity, seemed certain; and he began a cal- oulation of his finances, His father had remitted him large sums, His expenses though great, were well managed. Hewas i strict economist, and therefore, though his hand had been liberal, his purse was not empty. "If, therefore," thought he, " a temporary assistance will avail, I shall have the satisfaction of affording it; and if, on the contrary a more deep calamity, than my ability can disperse, claims the just notice of discriminating benevolence, there is my uncle, or Mr'. McFarland, who, I am sure will thank me for the information, and surely the writer of this letter cannot be unworthy of their favor. Such were the reflections, of experience, and such the feelings of a benevolent and uncorrupted heart. He wrote an answer, appointing the next morning, at twelve o'clock for the interview; and felt no inconsiderable anxiety till its arrival. At the appointed time he repairedto Berners street, and was ushered into a very neat and elegant drawing room. In a few minutes a lady entered, in deep mourning, with a work basket in her hand. She seemed almost sinking with diffidence; and the 'struggles of her wounded pride appeared depicted .in her counte- nance. Charles rose, and bowed respectfully. "This condescention, sir," said she, hesitating; "' the condeseen- tion of this visit, is, at the same time, the source of so much satis- faction-and pain!-that I must request your pardon;-but-I really-I---," and she sank into a chair, and applied her hand- kerchief to her face. Randall stood mute with surprise. Instead of the female of his imagination, worn with woe, and wasted with despair-a formand face had appeared to his view, the most beautiful hehad ever seen.   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE. 6! Her figure, considerably above the middle size was majestic, dig- nified and elegant--her countenance admirably corresponded with her person. Dark hair, flowing in luxuriant ringlets, on'her fore-: head, and hanging loose on her neck greatly heightened theeffect of a most delicate complexion, still farther assisted by well formed eyebrows, and lips of coral hue. Her dress was-sirmply elegant, and displayed the beateous sym- etry of her person to advantage. After a pause of some dura- tion, she said-- "Pray, be seated, sir; for Randall, unconscious that he did so, had stood silently gazing on the forem before him-" how weak are our strongest resolves!" continued she. "I had imagined, pre. pared myself for this interview; and' thought myself strongly armed against all the attacks of pride--but the remembrance of what they have been, is among the last things with which the un- fortunate are compelled to part." Charles, extremely afflicted at her distress, attempted once or twice to speak himself, but failed in the attempt. The lady con- tinued- "Many and powerful, were the struggles I have encountered, ere I resolved upon soliciting this interview; but the character of Mr. Randall-so opposite to the volatile and unthinking youths oP'fashion to whom a story of distress is the source either of spleen or scorn--added to the very encouraging traits of benevolent sym- pathy so strongly portrayed in his countenance, at length embold- ened me to take a step, I have since, more than once, repented. I have therefore, sir, to entreat your pardon for so great a liberty, and hope you will completely erase from your memory the indis- creet request I have made."     , "Madam-I--if I can-if it is in my power--I shall be happy, madam-I hope-if there is anything" Such were the incoherent words of Randall, in whose breast pity, which was its constant guest, now mingled its influence, with a new and strange Sensation; so strange, so new, as to create a wild alarm, not only in his countenance, but in his words and manners. *'I perceiveyour generous intentions; but I cannot--I ought not to take advantage of so much goodness --Hoew strongly you resemble you' worthy father!" "You know my father?" ' Yes. sir, I knew him once. They were happpy- days When I   62         THE LME KILN MAN, OR knew Mr. Randall! I little dreamt how severe adestiny was too succeed those joyful days., Butalas, how feeble is our hold on earthly bliss--how fleetingour joy-how unstable our hopes of happiness! O, painful to coritemplate the picture of what I have beenh--tad view the gloomy scenes before me. Wealth and friends and hope were then all mine. Now poverty, and enemies, and fell despair surround me; and the worst that fate can ordain tot mortals is my gloomy expectation?" Randall had struggled to overcome his embarrassment; and collecting himself as much as possible, he said-  "If the calamity, which has wrought so unhappy a change, may be communicated without pain, believe me, madam, the confidence with which you honor me shall be respected, by one who has ever felt for the unhappy, but who never felt so unhappy as at the pres. ent moment." *' Ah, sir!" said Elinor, and sighed-'" the soothing voice of friendship, has been so long unheard; my ear has been so used of late to the sounds of anger and defiance, that the tenderness of your expressions has the influence of music on my mind., But when you- are acqhainted with my story, I much fear that your ]an- guage will be altered:; and that ceasing to pity my misfortunes, you will only censure my misconduct."  U Pardon ne, madam," said Randall. "The emotions of pity are arbitrary sensatibns, for :the justice of which we cannot be pre. sumed to be responsible; but the voice of censure ought at least to have the sanction of experience, and the motives of prevention. So add poignancy of reproof to'the stings of convictions, betrays an unfeeling heart at all times; but most unpardonable, indeed, would it be to pour reproach into the breast that seeks by confi- dence' the balm of consolation.     ' "Cease, sir! I beseech you, cease to speak thus! You are not aware howemuch you increase the wound you seek to heal!" Then rising from her chair, and walking with considerable emo- tion about the room she continned-  "I have born oppression, I have suffered with some degree of dignity, the stings and arrows of outrageous fortune; bat your pity, your sympathy, Mr. Randall, disarms- me ,of my purpose, and increases the weakness I had almost subdued. I will hasten to relate to you my errors, that yourscorn and contempt may sib- due the baneful effects of your too cruel tenderness!" "'Mysterious!' exclaimed Randall, in a low tone.

It was not the first offer I had received, but it was the first that had received the pressing recommendation of the Dean.

"My uncle," said she, after being absent a few minutes, MEd again seating herself near Charles' chair; "My uncle so warmly espoused the cause of Lord Tyrone as to descend to, threats of his displeasure, if I persisted in refusing his proposals. iHe is naturally a humane man; but, in this instance, his anger over- came him, and his, expressions were harsh and cruel. Still, sir, I persisted in myarefusal. "My brothers were appealed to.  MySmarried sister,and her lord, were also made my judges; and with one voice they. all condemned me to the cruel alternative of marrying -a man, for whom I felt no preference, or of forfeiting, for ever, their protec- tion and esteem! " The most insulting and unfeeling motives were attributed to  me in rejecting so splendid anc honorable a,proposal. I was shunned by the whole family.  My walks were watched; at last prohibited.  IJ was detained a prisoner in my uncle's castle,- nor even plemitted to walk -beyond the boundaries of his park. "( As my relations increased in their cruelty towards me,. Lord Tyrohe redoubled his tenderness and attention; obtaining by his interest, occasional liberties, and some few marks of concern from my tyrants; but, instead of gaining by this conduct, any advance in my esteem, it:sunk him beneath the former level of indifference and I became disgusted with the man, who would consent to re- ceive such mean advantages. "My situsation grew .daily more and more intolerable., A faith- ful. servant, who had attended me for many years, was discharged upon the. pretended suspicion of aiding me in an ideal; corespon- denoe^. which ,teyaid I carried on with some low' bori wretch, who I had the meanness to prefer to the man of their hoi'e.   (oG0        THE LIME-K'ILN MAN, OR "Alas! how much were they mistaken, if, indeed, they imag- ined my heart at that time had a preference among mankind. No, sir, not even a friend beyond poor Mary, who they discharged, had I in the world. When she was gone, they placed over me a cruel, insolent old woman, in the capacity of servant, but with the power of a mistress. "Debarred the comforts of society, of reading, drawing, or any other amusement; my mind, unshaken in its resolution, became desperate; -and after duly weighing all the obstacles that opposed themselves to such a step, I determinedto quit for ever, the house that had hitherto been my asylum. "  , My faithful Mary found means to acquaint me, in my captivi- ty, that, after her dismissal, she hadtravelled, at her own expense twenty-eight miles from the castle to an old lady, who was my  father's distant reation, but an inveterate foe to my uncle, and to all my mother's relatives. "This lady, a widow, and childless, was extremely rich, and though she had never seen me, such was the success of Mary's. tale of my sufferings, that she commissioned her to tell me, she would receive me as her daughter, if I could escape from the castle. '"I did escape; and Mary and I were received by my relative with every mark of respect. "My uncle soon discovered my retreat, and wrote a letter filled with indignation at my conduct, and a formal renunciation, in which he was joined by my brother and sister. "It my new situation,I was for some time as happy as I could wisi; till an event-' -but let me stop in time. If I proceed with sincerity to relate the cause of my Unhappiness, I am- afraid--in- deod Mr. Randall--I am much afraid, the loss of your esteem would be the painful consequence, and Heaven only knows how highly I esteem your good opinion." (' Madam?" exclaimed Randall. "Aye, sir, you may wh be -surprised! My face, my voice, are neew to you; not so yours to me."  "t Indeed!".said Randall. "Where, pray; have you seen it?" "i No matters sir-since I now see it for the last time!" "I hope not!" said Charles, with warmth. Stranger as you are to ime, madam I feel so deeply interested, so much concerned in yoburwelfare, that excepting my sister and my mother, I know no person in the world I more ardently desire to serve" -    THE VICTIM OF MSFORITUNE.      67- "You are kind-you are very kind!" said Elinor. "Can I serve you, madam "- "You alone can serve me; but you will not, nay, you shall not serve me."' "' You speak mysterious, and look wild. Fear not, I beseech you, to confide to me your sorrows!-my bosom shall be their sacred repository." "Generous-generous youth!" exclaimed Elinor-, and with a beaming unconsciousness, threw her arm upon his shoulder-then appearing to recollect herself, hastily withdrew it. Every moment now, increased the desire of Charles to be made acquainted with the causes of her distress. HHe gazed earnestly upon her countenance.  He ventured to take her hand- "Dear lady, let me entreat you to delay the recital of your woes no longer. Of whatever nature they may prove, God only grant me the power to remove them, and I shall be the happiest of all men." "Your generosity of mind, your tenderness of heart, are indeed the objects of my admiration! But, alas! my- calamity is of so peculiar a nature, that the most generous mind, the most suscep- ' tible heart cannot conceive anything that can alleviate it. Mine is a silent sorrow, thatchroods within my own breast. A sigh is its only expression--a tear is its only relief. No tongue has pro. claimed it-no ear has received its complaint. To you it desires to speak-to you alone it will ever speak; but spare me, pardon me; leave me!?' and she wept. How strange is her behavior, thought Randall--how wild, yet how mournful her countenance! After a pause, Elinor recov- ered her former serenity, and continued-- I am to blame, sir, thus to trifle' with your time. I will en- deavor to conclude my dull narrative, and at all hazards venture to' explain the motiverf my request to see you. "My benefactress, whose bounty was my only resource, con- tinued to treat me with the affectionate regard of a parent; my days'rol1ed on in comfort; and my heart knew no distress, till that event to which I before alluded. O, God! how shall I relate it! But it must be told. "There resided near our dwelling a family of respectability, but not wealthy; they therefore did'not visit our house, but we sonce or twice met in. the neighborhood. Of the father, of the mother,   VO        'Tlfi  'J 1.MfTlfiMEJ LN X AMj, OU of the daughter I shall say nothing; but of the son! Pardon me, indeed I cannot proceed!" "6 Waive this reluctance," cried Randall. Confide in me as your brother; you shall(find me as tender of your feelings, as zealous in your service, as if we each, recognized the same parent." "What do I hear!" cried linor, quickly; "is it possible! Did you say, you love me as a brother! Happy, happy mo- ment!"She took his hand, and kissing it with warmth, exclaim- ed- "My brother--my brother!" Randall starting from his chair, and snatching away his hand seemed thrown into a delirium; while Elinor appearing to recol- lect herself, hung down her head, and blushed. ;' In the name of heaven, Madam, tell me, who and what are you? Finish, I beseech you, this mysterious tale, and quickly, that I may, if possible, serve you ; or if not, may instantly escape a presence that creates emotions of pain and pleasure, too powerful to be long endured!" "( I entreat your forgiveness," cried Elinor, "'But go, sir-go- ere you know the misery you have occasioned-the storm of ruin that you have faised--go ignorant of my wretchedness, which to know, would perhaps excite a painful pity in your breast, but no re- lief to me! Since to behold me is so painfadl--" "I did not say so!" cried Randall, "or if I did - " "I see, we are both too much agitated," interrupted Elinor. "Your surprise, and perhaps your pity, have overpowered you; whilst Ham the prey of feelings which rack my bosom with tor- ture inexpressible.!' ( 'Tis suspense alone that tortures me?, said Randall. ," Your manner-your mysterious words, and the wildness of your eyes, make me dread a something which I fear-yet ask to know!- You speak of a youth who resided near yomu-you talk of ruin, of misery, of which I am the author--you request to see me---you ' desire me to leave you, as ignorant as I came! Whence Spring such inconsistences?" 4' From a source you never dreamed of --- From love!'" Her countenance was now altered from the picture of contend- ing influence to a portrait of determination. Her eyes were fixed firmly on Randall, She: remained silently gazing on his face a considerable time. RandaJl was dumb. "'Tis, over!" at length she cried;, I hbav conquerred! The   --........ w U..i..VI IU nf'jf - oU youth to whom I have alluded, is Charles Randall!--yes! -he it is, whom Fate had ordained my destruction! For him, I quit my friends, my country. For him, I forfeit affluence, and embracethe horrors of poverty, in a foreign and distant clime. Was it, then, too much to ask the favor of one hour's interview, whereby to de. clare how ardently I love, and how largely I sacrifice to a hopeless passion! O Nature!--can I thank thee for the liberal share of personal attractions thy hand has given me, since they have served to. heap upon my head the persecutions of a train that I cannot help despising, while on that heart alone, which I esteem, their in- fluente is too weak to impress even a cold regard:!"  Randall was lost in wonder. After various attempts, he said- "I dont remember ever to have seen you before!" "I can easily believe you, sir." "And yet, I think, if ever I had beheld such a countenance as yours, surely, madam, I could not have forgotten its interresting traits!" "Nay, sir, I must not hear you, if your voice assumes that. strain. A Do not imagine sir, my declaration meant to claim your pity I No; my resolution is fixed as firmly as the decrees of Fate. One moment longer let me detain your ear and then, fare- well for ever! Briefly, then-the same persecution though from different quarters, rendered the abode of my benefactress as mis. erable as my  uncle'&with this addition of wretohedness--that in the latter, my'heart was wholly disengaged; in the former, your image, your worth, barred all avenues to affection for another. The object so dear to me was unknown to my benefactress--to all the world, but myself. My refusals were therefore deemed ob. stinancy: my  perseverance became rebellion; and I was at length driven to the dreadful alternative of quitting for ever, the refuge I  had obtained, or to approach the solemn altar, and vow fidelity with my lips, whilst my heart would be adulterous for ever. Such was the choice held out for my adoption-and could I hesi- tate? No, not a  moment! I  waited not to be driven from the house. Voluntarily I  departed. I have remained some time in the metropolis-I determined to see you, and now, will forever quit the country that gave birth to my existence and my woes! I will seek in some corner of a distant land, that grave, which alone can restore peace to my heart by an oblivion of you!" She ceased. Randall who had risen from his chair, and was walking about the room, was deeply involved in thought, corn.   'SU        THE LIME-KILN MAB, OR batting one suggestion of his fancy after another, till his head be- came giddy. He threw himself on a sofa, and leaned his head on his arm. Elinor with the tenderest expressions of concern, took his hand, and pressed it warmly. "t If I have given you pain-if I have relieved my own breast at the expense of a moments uneasiness to you, what a source of eternal regret! Or, if I have rendered myself odious, by a dec- laration which custom condemns, and have erected a monument of scorn in that remembrance, where I sought to deposit the pearl of pity. O, how miserable has my folly made me! Say then, only that youdo not abhor me-and I will never-never-trouble your quiet more!" "His heart must be differently moulded from mine," said Charles, " that can despise,or abhor you, madam. Your confession has so much influence onmine, I would say more-but at present let me entreat of you not to quit this place, till I have been favor- ed with another interview.

Then swear to me--nay, I will not quit this posture till you do swear to me, that you will not, to your dearest friend, utter a breath, that may betray me!" ," Good God, what do you ask p" cried Randall"in the most try. ing situation of my life, would you deprive my inexperience of their superior counsel, who love me, and have wisdom to direct me?" "What council can you want-what is there to determine?t cried Ellinor. "By to-morrow's setting sun, I shall be the oceah's charge. All that you have heard will then be only as a vision, that may occasionally ask a sigh; while it reminds you that there is one in the universe, on whom the night will never steal, or the dawn break, without a prayer to Nature's Author for your heart's peacee!

"Not till I have received your solemn promise i"   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.       71 Charles hesitated some minutes; during which time she held his hand between her own, and leaned her warm cheek upon it. ' Will you then, promise me," said Randall, " to remain here till to-morrow?" "By no means!" "Will you permit me an interview this evening?" ( For what purpose ." "Nay, I know not; but my heart tells me that I am to blame. I would prevent the necessity of your leaving England." "Necessity /" exclaimed Elinor,--', it is my choice!" "But if-if-why-why do you wish to restrain me from  con-, suiting my friends? I have an important, very important point to decide; and I dare not trust my feelings with the decision." "' I understand the insult now!" cried Elinor, rising scornfully. "You would insinuate that-if your relations can find no just ob- jection to my character, and fortune, you might condescend to pity me, and perhaps if, and supposing so and so, you would then offer me a love, not the offspring of my creation, but a conde. scending acceptence of overtures, you may-imagine I have made to you!  I had conceived your heart a different composition, Mr. Randall; or mine would never have been known to you." "You judge wrong, madam, I assure you! Your candor, your noble-mindedness, have impressed me with a reverence, not con. tempt; and if this new sensation in my bosom be not- But spare me only' for a few hours-permit me to see you in the oX evening-and if, then, you require the oath, I will most solemnly take it; and till then not a whisper shall escape my lips concern- ing you." After a  pause, she continued-  "I cannot see the necessity for this, Mr. Randall. Why should we meet again? Why not immediately separate for ever?  But since your request is otherwise-be it so, sir. I shall expect you in the evening; till then, farewell!" "Adieu, madam," said Charles, and tremblHngly he retired. Va   72  ax     THE LIMB-KILN MAN, OR CHAPTER XII. In the most profound reverie, Randall passed the distance be- tween Berners street and Mr. Robinson's. The bustle that sur- rounded him, the rattling of carriages, were insufficient to arouse him from a sort of stupor into which he had fallen. When he arrived at home, he rushed through the hall, and hurt rying to his own room, threw himself into a chair---"Marion!- Marion!" muttered he; "I have never before heard the name; I have no recollection of the face--O, what an important day! those looks! -that form!--never will my soul lose the impression!" He sighed deeply, and painfully. "Love me?-yes, she loves me. She owns it-nay, her behavior declares it more powerfully than her words! What a wondrous effect has she wrought upon me? What means this swelling of the heart, this difficulty of re. spiration Can I imbibe a partiality so instantaneously? Are :our natures indeed so susceptible? Surely, it cannot be It must be pity for Elinor-for her suffering-that pains me thus. Then let me soften them as much as possible-let me send her in writing the oath she requires, and spare her the pain of another interview!--andyet-never to see her again! Why do I feel a dread at that thought? Suppose she should be already gone? Forbid iit heaven! Once more-once more, let me behold a form so lovely! What brilliant expression in her eyes!--what sense? s what animation in her countenance! How happily might I pass my life with such a woman! But then her situation-my own too! Madness alone can suggest such a thought. She is proud. I dare not offer her pecuniary a;d. Where can she go? What part of the globe does she seek? Unhappy Elinor! Would I had never seen you!-would to God 1 had never seen you!" Such were the meditations of Randall-Elinor absorbed all his thoughts, while her beauteous form floated in air before his imagi- nation. Never, till this day, had his imagination been heated by the charms of woman! In others he beheld amiableness, modesty and beauty that won the esteem of his heart, and the approbation of his understanding; but in Elinor he saw far more attractive qualities.   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.       73 This woman was beautiful in the extreme. Nature had indeed been liberal of her gifts, and education had increased the value of her beauty. Elinor had once possessed everything desirable in the female character; for she once possessed virtue and innocence. But she parted with innocence, and' in its stead had admitted, as the guest of her heart the most accomplished cunning. At an early period of her life she had surrendered all claim to chastity, and had since then submitted to that miserable traffic, which is the most severe libel on civilized society. Too aspiring to herd with the unhappy class to which she haa reduced herself, her strong and towering mind was perpetually busied upon schemes more valuable to herself, and far loftier in the scale of wickedness than the generality of those unfortunate beings, whose daily infamy is their daily bread. In her own fall, she was-the-dupe of a professed rake; and her own schemes upon the tranquility of others, were all infused with a large portion of revenge. Man at large, she deemed her enemy; and the talents, and the charms she possessed, she considered as her weapons of revenge. Unlike many a sighing wretch, whom severe distress urges to compunctive acts of shame, Elinor was systematically' vicious. The present world bounded her views of futurity, and the strug- gles of the present scene ended, in her imagination, the drama of ,existence. Thus, no principles of a religious nature swayed her thoughts, no checks of conscience'ever intervened between the inclination, and the deed. Pity, and all the tender sensibilities which many natures fee], were her inward derision; but their semblance was perfectly at her command. Such was Elinor!  Such was she, for whom  Randall at first sight, had unconsciously imbibed the most powerful love'! She had never once seen Randall after her departure from the scenes of their childhood for the school where her father had placed her. But having learned his movements-thegreat confidence re- posed in him by Mr. Robinson, the large sims of money entrust- ed to his care, she, was not long in arranging a method to ensnare him within her power. For this purpose, she had spared nopains to obtain the intelligence she had gained concerning him, and had feigned the story she had related to him, and which did not contain one syllable of truth. Her sentiments, her tone of voice, her gestures were studied for   74         THE LIME KILN' MATj, 'OR the occasion; and she was guided from movement to movement in the ,lan she would pursue, by the effect which her penetration discovered she had wrought on her victim. Thus artfully had she prepared the ground-work of her plot; and had thus far succeeded to the extent of her wishes. The interval between his departure and the hour 'at which she expected his return, was anxiously spent by Elinor; and she re- pented more than once, that she had suffered him to leave her--a step to which she consented, chiefly to carry on appearances, and from a persuasion, in which she was not mistaken, of her power oaver him. Meanwhile, he, for whom her machinations were devised, was planning the means of making her happy. Many and various were the resolutions he fobred, but all unstable. His heart had admit ted a spark, which his reason was too impotent to extinguish, and which was rising rapidly into a flame, of whose influence he was ignorant, but whose. warmth he began to discover. If the imagination of Randall was already wrought to a danger- ous warmth, the next reception he met with in Berners street was well calculated to increase it. On a crimson damask sofa, placed under a brilliant mirror, illu- minated by wax lights, reclined the Syren, Elinor. A most, ele- ganit white dress had superseded the sable weeds of the morning.; with a turkish turban, ornamented with gold studs and tassels. The solemn air of dignified sorrow was exchanged for the most fas. Cinating smiles; -and instead of the reserved and bashful demean- or, Randall had prepared himself to meet, he was thrown off his' guard by the most alluring glances. She did not rise when he entered the room, but holding out a most beautiful arm, encircled at the wrist with a brilliant brace- let, she said, with an enchanting softness-  "4Mr. Randall." Charles approached with the most profound astonishment, and received her offered hand. "Am I not a strange creature!" continued she. 'My trap- pings of woe, you see, are soon thrown off. But, in truth, I did not think it consistent with the pleasure I expected in your society to wear the semblance of sorrow!" Charles was petrified with amazement, and doubted, for a mo-  ment, wheth-er the woman of sentiment he had seen in the iorning s'   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.        76 and the wanton form before him were the same. As she stillheld his hand in hers, she fixed her sparkling eyes full on his face- '"You have an uncommon countenances" said she. "You are very severe-and yet have great sensibility. You are a com- pound of the stern and tender. I scarcely know which predomi. nates in your nature. You do n14t lack courage or fortitude; at the same time you will weep at a tale of misery, and the unfortun- ate are sure of your tympathy. Is it not so? Now, let me try if I am mistaken. Place that harp near me, and I will sing you a ditty about a door simple maid- w * * 'who never told her love, But let concealment,) as the poet says-and so on--now be silent," He placed the harp, and Elinor changing her features from the wanton to the languishing, gave him the manuscript to hold, while she sang and accompanied a simple pleasing ballad with exquisite taste and melody. The expression of her eyes was perfectly in unison with the words; and her voice uttered the sweetest sounds. It was a pathetic story and affected Randal extremely. ' Thiere," said she, "I knew you would weep, at a fiction too! Ah, Mr. Randall, to me only are-you insensible! My abrupt sin- cerity has made me the object of your scorn! Yes, cruel and in- sensible, you return the most glowing affection with the choldest disdain." "Disdain!-O, no," said Randall--" say, rather, admiration and esteem. Where is the being, who could,gaze on such charms and disdain their possessor? How must the heart be formed that can remain insensible to so much beauty?" 9"There are hearts, I fe;r," said Elinor, (, round which the hand i of worldly prudence forms  a circle, that freezes every passion of the soul. Tihele are beings, who can have according to a scale of reason, and model their affections by a standard. But I do not-cannot think so of so young a heart as your's " ': Our reason," interrupted Randall,' with a satirical smile. "And where did you learn that maxim t I suppose some pon- derous folio so says. But have books hearts? No, no, Mr. Ran- dall. Ask those who wrote the senseless lies, what is this reason, that isso omnipotent? Where is to be seen-or who possesses it 2" "Astonishing!" said Randall. "Doyou-then deny the existence of Reason?" fo   "Yses, such Reason as the black letter gentlemen depict. Can reason quench the thirst. or satiate the appetite of hunger? Ah! no -no. Ahd is the fstroingest impulse of our motions to be so easily swayed, y Reason then? Why have we passions--merely to torment us? O, infamous libel on the author of our existence, -who has given his creatures allthings to enjoy. Well, the poet sings.? 'To enjoy is to obey!'" The airs, the doctrine of Elinor now roused, for the first mo- ment, as suspicion in his mind of her intentions which startled  Randall. lie sunk into a profound reverie, his eyes cast on the floor. Elinor observed it, and saw the struggles that was risingin his breast. Perfect mistress of her art, she was aware how im- perceptible her bold advances had stolen into his heart, and with a cunning caution restrained her efforts, and changed her opera- tions. Instead of attempting to continue an argument, at which she well knew he, revolted, she touched the strings of the harp, and raised an enchantment of melody, from the slowest and softest to the most brisk and lively measures, her fingers swept the trem- bling chords, The effect on Randall was instantaneous. In vain did the enamored youth aim to repress the rising flame-in vain he attempted to resist the maddening impulse of desire! On the precipice of danger, he was ignorant of his situation. His cheeks flushed, his eyes looked wild, and he fell back on the sofa, over- come with the force of such new and powerful emotions. The syren saw her time. She struck the harp again, and- "Softly sweet in Lydian measures, Soontfhe soothed his aoul to pleasures." She sighed--she gazed with looks of warme st love-she seemed to yield her soul to her desires-sank by the side of Randall--r- clined her head upon his cheek-presed the warm lips to his, anl conquered. ,-   - ....... v. a -so-LfVit 'UNJ. " CHAPTER XIII. About an hour before the time appointed for Randall to be in Berners street, the following letter was handed to him- "Author of my future destiny! my conqueror!-my bus band!-(will you allow the title!)-still dearer name, my Ran- dall!-your trembling Elinor throws herself upon vour generos- ity. She trusts implicitly on a heart that has so effectually mas- tered her awe! "My uncle is in pursuit of me-for worlds I would not at pres- ent behold him. He bas inquired for me in Berners street, I was of course denied.  He is to be there again this evening. "Oh, how I wanted your advice; why had you left me.? As it was, I was compelled to decisive conduct. I discharged the lodgings immediately, ordered a post-chaise, and drove to Picca- dilly. "I write from the house of a tradesman, whom I had formerly employed; and leave your feelings to express to you, how impa- tiently I wait your arrival! what shall I subscribe myself? Oh! Randall, for both our sakes, let me entreat your presence! And let fate play what part it may, I shall ever be C, YOUR OWN." "The bearer will drect you." Thunderstruck at such an unexpected procceeding, Randall was for some time incapable of deciding what step to take. While he hesitated, I entered the room. "He still held the letter in, his hand- "You are engaged?" said I.. "No, sir--yes, sir-that is-I-" Well, sir," I  interrupted, ' I'll not intrude. I may, perhaps, bring stale news top., I have inquired twice to day in Bemners street. At first the lady was not visible; the second time, I learned that she had taken post horses, and left town. You may possibly know the route." "4 No, sir-yes sir -" said Randall again hesitating. "Ah," said ,   " how difficult does motive find the winding paths offmean dissimulation!  If you would retain your peace of mind,   78         THE LIME-RILN MAN, OR Oh, youth, retain sincerity. And remember, that shame or dan- ger will prove as unwelcome at the end of a maze, as if boldly met at their first appearance!" Ere Randall could reply, I took his hand affectionately, and said- "One caution let me impress upon your memory, and I am gone. Make no promises of secrecy! Farewell." Randall, had not the power, nor indeed just then, the inclination to detain me, and I retired. "He has called twice in Berners street," said Randall, after my departure. "Perhaps, then, Elinor may have imagined his in- quiries to be her uncles. But why that caution as to promises of secrecy? Surely Elinor-. But while I am arguing, she spends the moments in anxious expectation." He rushed towards the door, and desired the man, who waited, to conduct him to Elinor. Immediately they met, she ran to him, apparently in the great- est distress of mind, and hiding her face in his bosom, cried-- "Oh, hide me-hide me, my dear Randall from my pursuers." 'Dispel these fears, Madam!" said Randall. "Your alarms may be groundless. It is possible you may have mistaken the description of another person for your uncle." "I have seen him. He pursues me, and will tear me for ever from those loved arms! Oh, how cruel-how peculiarly cruel is my destiny. Perhaps already he has traced my chaise to this very door, and will soon be here. Let us quit the house!" Randall, alarmed and greatly concerned for her distress, thought of nothing at the moment but relieving it. , Where will you be safe?" he exclaimed. "Alas! I know not! But let us this moment quit this place. my trunks may be left here for the present. Come-come!" She hurried on her cloak, and leaning on his arm, walked to- wards the door. They had walked a considerable distance from the house ere Randall had sufficiently recovered from the surprise her. conduct had occasioned. "I am faint!" dried Elinor. This aroused him, and being near the coach stand at Hyde Park Gate, he called a hackney coach. When they wete seated-          .    o "Where am I drive, your honor V" said Ohe man. Elinor leaning her headn against the side of the coach, remained   THE VICTIM OF MSFORTUNE.       79 , silent. Randall knew not how to answer. After a considerable pause, he said- "The case is this-this lady is just arrived in town, and, we want lodgings. Drive slowly along the Brompton road, and if you observe an advertisement at any door stop there." The coachman obeyed. They stopped at a house kept by a widow, and Randall hired the lodnings at the rate of two guineas a week. Elinor, thus placed in a safe retreat, as she pretended from her uncle, gradually reassumed her serenity of countenance, and expressed her gratitude to Randall in the warmest language, and by the most seducing endearments. The pretended fears of Elinor, so admirably played, completely answered the purpose for which she had assumed them. Her pene- tration had easily discovered-that Randall's mind, if time was allow- ed him for reflection, would too scrupulously examine the question of propriety. She therefore artfully resolved to take him by sur- prise. The apartments in Berners street, she had taken for the express purpose of their first interview, where she had resided but a few days, and had actually discharged them in the manner she had related. The story of her uncles pursuit was entirely a fiction. Her present aim was to obtain a habitation at the expense of Ran- dall, and this it is seen, she accomplished. Having thus far succeeded, a pause in her operations was nec- essary. She therefore, dallied with the unfortunate youth, who was the pliant victim of her arts, and evaded all his inquiries as to her future designs. When an air of sadness marked his fea- \ tures, she would sing-when he hinted his wish that they were \ married, she sighed deeply, turned her head away from him, and talked on some different subject; when be spoke of his friends, she effected the extremest agitation; wept (for she could weep at wilD and implored him, as he valued her life, to retain their con- nection an inviolable secret, for at least some time to come. 'Randall started as this caution I had given him," never to prom- ise secrecy," rushed across his memory- "Why, why should there be secrecy?" he exclaimed. "My old friend, MoFar--" "' No matter sir, our fates have rendered it most necessary," she interrupted. ' Ah! Mr. Randall, you know not yet all the per- plexities that rack this heart. Pardon the mysterious veil that for a moment conceals it, and confide in the, assurance, that it is   80.        THE LIME KILN MAIT, OR wholly and forever yours. It is to be wished, that we, yes, we, (for I will not affect to throw the guilt wholly on you) had not yielded to the too powerful impulse of our passions! .But who can recall the past? How useless, then, is it to repine! Let us, my dear Randall, rather conquer than submit to our fate, and em- ploy ourselves in a prudent anticipation of the future, in prefer- en"O to a gloomy retrospect of the past." S i h were the blandishments with which-the syren soothed the regrets of Randall, and such the arts by which she bound him in unfelt fetters. At his return home, the following morning, he found a packet of letters from his uncle's. Soon as he saw the well known writing, his heart smote him. For some days previous to the unfortunate affair with Elinor, accident had prevented his writing to his sister, with who he had hitherto regularly corresponded, since his arrival in London, and the events which had occurred since then were such as he felt no inclination to relate. With the just apprehensions of reproof, therefore, he broke the seals, and read the following letters- "ETTER I. "My Dear Son, t"I am very uneasy at a silence of which I know not the cause. If you are as happy as usual, why not let us be equally so, in knowing that you are? If otherwise, why so sel- fish as to retain, in your own breast, cares in which others have a right to participate . Ns it possible you can forget that you have a sincere friend in '"Your most affectionate mother, ' M. RANDALL." "ETTER II. "My Dear Brother, "It is with pain, and agitation, I am compelled to complain of you, even to yourself!

Thusi my dear brother, do I tor- ture imagination to find excuses for your conduct; but as imagi. nation has yet offered nothing in your favor, to the satisfaction of your judge, you are now called upon for your defence. Speak then, sir. You have a powerful pleader in the breast of your sis- ter, and if you can make but a tolerable excuse, you may assure yourself of a ready acquittal. It is necessary to conclude by way of memento, in the old fashioned style, that ' I am, de* brother, Your affectionate sister, ELIZA RANDALL." "ET TER III , ;Dear Nephew, I take this opportunity of expressing to you my approbation of your conduct, the report of which, from Mr. Robinson, gives me great pleasure.

I hope you pay par- ticular attention to your expenses, and never suffer yourself, for * the sake of momentary pleasures or false pride, to go beyond the mark, which would compel you to descend to real meanness, or bring on lasting uneasiness. You will take this as caution, not re- proof. I have every reason to rely upon your prudence, and shall fall with quiet into my grave, if only I am permitted to see my brother's son settle respectably in life, and become the guardian and protector of his widowed mother and his sister, which if you like, will be enabled to be.

These letters, the simple, genuine effusions of affectionate hearts were perused by Randall with mingled sensations of pleasure and   83         i THE LIME-KILN MAN, OR pain. When he compared the last of these with his situation with respect to Elinor, he shuddered. "What steps shall I pursue?" said the distractpd youth. i' They charge me with silence-how shall I ever write again! I have pledged myself to Elinor-I have sworn to be seoret. If I write, therefore, I must conceal from them my perplexities -I must disguise my feelings-must invent occurrences to ac count formy time. Dreadful situation! And who can foresee its durationS. How long may the too lovely Elinor envelope herself in this im- penetrable mystery? "' I have incurred a certainexpense in a provision for her-per- haps too far. Oh, God! what a precipice am   I descending!- There is no. possible way of sustaining my ground, but by a timely disclosure of my errors-and from that I am prevented by a rash oath!

Why should she exact it  So contrary to my nature, to my' practice, too. I hate, I abhor se-' crecy. It is but another name for deception! I will fly instantly  and retract my engagement Iwill convince her how necessary it is that our marriage should immedihstely take place, and be de- clared; then, even if the anger of my benefactor should overpower. his tenderness and affection, I have the world before 'me.

But to continue the mean paths of dissimula- t tion--to start at every noise-to tremble at every glance-xeist under the uplifted rod of fear, is worse, much worse, than any evil wtiich can result from an opposite conduct. This is the voice of prudence, of interest-and is in unison with the lessons of morali- ty, and the precepts of religion." I will obey it instantly. Such were the inward musings of Randall; such was the noble resolutions of his heart. As he was completely' master of his own time in Mr. Robinson's absenrce, he answered someiletters received that morning fdiom Buxton, and went'immediately to Brompton. t s'  *    i  ---- ,v'nmMor bTi/tt CHAPTER XIV Elmeor, a she reeeived him wr.. we,  , Radall , sitd though w' n eould glatl hao dispendt reiae; , visitd!" i1ried Rnda seriously; "be first cerina, thatmy "BT so grae anaddres, you terrify me!" sh cried, pIreteiid: ig exoessiWe alarm.

"Extraordinary woman!" cried Randall. " ow, then, am I to act Say Elinor, had you a mother and a sister whom you loved, and to whom you had been accustomed to reveal your in- most thoughts, could you refrain from recounting such a train of interesting events as have occurred to us within these few import- ant days?" "What can be more easily decided than your question? Ask yourself, what benefit you can expect from revealing these events? You would merely create a host of painful apprehensions in those breasts, which you wish should be the mansions of peace; and the only possible result of their knowing what has passed, would be a painful anxiety to know more than itis apresent in your power to reveal."1 "And yet, to conceal the true state of my mind, I must feign a satisfaction I do not feel; I must assume an indifference to which my  heart is a stranger. How pan I answer suchlettersas these?" Randall then gave her the three letters he had received in the morning. When she had perused them, she said-- "Your sister is an amiable girl; and your mother is doubtless a good woman, but I scarcely know how to pronounce on your uncle. His letter of prudence seems more the acquisition of hab- it, than the suggestions of his own reason. He is very rich I presume?" "I understand so." "And has no children?" "None."

It has hither- to been too much swayed by prejudice, early imbibed, and still unexamined. But as you adv, ance in life, you will discover that the wisest and best of mankind find it impossible to model their actions by given rules. The incidents of life hinge so entirely on chance,: that our situations, relatively and individually, assume many complex shapes; and are perpetually at variance with de. fined notions of duty. It is therefore impossible to exhibit a standard of vittue or vice. "Let us apply this observation to your conduct and present situation. You say you cannot be a hypocrite! I grant you, hypocracy is classed amongst what are called vices; but will any one say, that to distress the feelings of a mother and sister, to wound their hearts with the arrows of perplexing, doubts and ap- prehensions, is more virtuous, than simply to conceal the events which' have passed, and which were not the effects of our own de- signs? -Such a doctrine scarcely merits a roment's thought!" By these and similar arguments, did this mistress of dissimula- tion, at length defeat the hoble purposes of that sincerity which hitherto had dwelt in Randall's breast, and he fatally resolved to keep his friends in ignorance of his situation. In the honesty of his nature, he had confessed to, Elinor, that he had mentioned the'affair to ore friend; but that he was igno- rant of any thing that had occurred since their second interview; and overcome by her tears, her arguments, and her pers(asions, he promised he would never allow himself to mention 'heir again even to this one friend, nor would ever suffer him to name .her to hinself.            - This was the precise point which the arts of Elinor aimed to accomplish; for she knew that, among the many and va'rious er- rors to which youth and inexperience are exposed, there is none more fatal in its consequences than the concealment of having committed them. The first deviating steps from the paths of rec- titude, may often be retiriced by the aid of friendly council; but he who denies himself that timely aid, will in vain implore its effi- cacy when entangled in the maze of deception; and when every avenue on the return to happiness is obstructed by some unex- peoted obstacle.   VICT Y1'MT OF MSFORTUNE.       8 CHAPTER X-V. The next day Randall received the following letter from his sister :-  "My Dear Brother, "There is something wrong; you are un. happy, and you have renderedus sotoo Whiaka letter was yOur last."

But ^when we found it devoted to improvement of the mind, to the elegant pursu s literature, and particularly when spontaneously you devote so large a portion of It to a correspondence, that brought us, as it were, daily into each other's presence, Wer heart glowed with gratitude to the memory ef him, who is now no more, as she hailed with joy the sweet blossoms of his early cultivation. "Shall we then be deceived at last!

Some indiscretion has, for a While, shed its sombre influence over the mind, that cannot be at once in error, and at ease. Is it so, my dear brother? I have a right to presume it is, from your conduct; for on no other ground can I define it. And if it should be so, what have we ever done, that' our hearts are denied their just right to a knowledge of you imperfections? How often have the imperfections of human nature been our theme! How often have we pitied the poor disciples of modern philosophy who boast the reverse. We have heard persons declare, that they have never repented of one act of their lives, and we have smiled. It must be false shame, or false fear, then, that has betrayed my dear brother into the concealment of his errors. "Perhaps you may imagine, that to acquaint us with, them. would occasion us pain; and that what we do not know, we can- not regret. Fatal delusion! How many wrecks of promised happiness has that rock occasioned! Most who approach it, perish. Examine this specious suggestion of Pride. It is no more. We are unwilling to descend in the esteem of those we love, and we conceal from their knowledge indiscretions, which we imagine would have that effect; forgetting that by the very concealment, we practice a crime, instead- of committing an error, and are guilty of the meanest hypocrisy, in passing ourselves upon our friends for such miracles of perfection, as make a comparison with their own experience, painful. Besides the meanness of this deception, it will be found impolitic., it is the unwarying law of nature, that all causes produce effects. Indiscretion, then, must have its con- sequences. And how frequently is it seen, that the consequences declare the indiscretion to those, from whom we have sought to connceal it, and then. how contemptible do we appear, from the very fact, which we vainly imagined the prop of our characters! "Pardon me, dear Charles, in thus reminding you of truths gathered from yourself; and believe me, that my heart would not have rested satisfied, had I said less. Anxious will pass the mo- ments till I hear from you; and if you are not indeed angry and offended at an officiousness, of which the tenderest love, and dear- est interest, are the parents, you will not hesitate to repose in a mother and sister's breasts the distresses or perplexities of your- own.

The heart of Randall suffered the severest conflicts from thepe. rusal of this letter. The fallacious arguments of Elinor, respect. ing the propriety o concealment were answered, ias completely as if he haad ex'pressed them to his sister. :His mind was learly con- vinced of the folly, as well as guilt, of any furthjrsecrecy; and he' once more determined to acquaint Elinor, that he could no longer submit to a clandestine connection. As he entered the room, she met him and exclaimed- ' Why, my dear Randall, is your brow thus constantly cloud- ed?"  i  He answerei not, but threw himself on the s6fa.  "I shall never be happy again," murmured he. , Oh! IElinor, what a wretch have you made me!'

CHAPTER XVI, "Not at home all night!"I exclaimed as the information was given me in the hll at Mr. Robinsons. "Not at home all night," I repeated, But while I was speaking, Randall knocked at the door. Atlthe sight of lme he started back, and hung down his head. His hair was undressed, his eyes were red and swollen, and :his whole ap- pearance proolaimed the revelry in which the night had passed. I sryeyed him leisurely from head to foot; during which time he reeooveredfrom ,his surprise, and invited me into the parlor. 4"Ha ing a few hours of leisure this morning," said I, 'seating myself, "- yes- Hyour old friend McFarlafid-have come to converse with you,on various matters. I am sorry that my visit is so ill timed. I really had no -intention ofbreaking in upon your hours of rest; but my vulgar idea had not associated going to bed , with the suninthe meridian.

"You, Mr. Randall who possess faculties of no common magni- tude, cannot have so far descended from thw dignity of a human creature, as to have surrendered the distinguished powers',of intel. lect to the. grovelling pleasures of the glass.

OHAP TER     XVIi     .. A few days after my departure for Ramsgate, Randall had 0c- casion to viritthere, in company with Einor: and *while there I encountered him. i immediaitely toldhim of the discovery I had made, and said to him,  "The monster shall niot, escaope the vengeancer due to, his' enor- mous crimes. I will be revenged- a daughter's shArie-a' daiugh- ter's death must be revenged-Mathetws, or MoFIa;nrid dies." "' Mathews!" exclaimed Randalli ' Aye, Matlews--Captain Mathewsg-;thefriend, the intimate, the familiar of your Mr. Robinson. He it was who destroyed the innocence a father had abandoned! However, I shall 'hate the satisfaction of taking his life. I met him to day, and was not very delicate in accusing him, of what I am now certain he is guilty of, and his reply was this- "Sir, I will not brook this conduct. Let me see this injured fa- ther, you speak of, and I will confront him to hi face!" "You will-then do. Behold him   you reptile! behold him here!" said I, rising, and folding my arms on my breast; stood op. posite to Mathews; when the astonished Captain staggered back a full pace and trembled. "-You don't know me. I am not one, who frames, destroys, and frames anew his resolutions.! I came not in the moment of passion, to wreak revenge, but calmly to inflict upon a villain the punishment of death!" ,( You come to murder, then?" cried Robinson. "Sir!".said Mathews, after a long struggle of cowardie-e" sir, I-see-thiat-you-are determined, not to listen to anything I offer in my defence; and therefore name yourjplace adid tim'g; and take what satisfaction you please- ..

"Shall we meet alone, or shall those who are now present at- tend us there?"I asked. "Is it impossible to prevent this meetingS? said Robinson. Can no concessions-no recompense  " "Are you a father," I interrupted, " and you talk of recompense. If indeed, he has power to raise the dead, and make that pure and spotless, which his lust has sullied, there might be meaning in your speech. I know no other recompense that he can offer, or I can receive. The meeting was arranged. It was agreed that Mr. Robinson and yourself should attend. You will be punctual V" "You can rely upon me, sir," said Randall, and we parted. Morning . came, and found Randall and myself within sight of the mill. We had not arrived three minutes before we were join- ed by Captain Mathews and Mr. Robinson:   The paces were measured, the pistols loaded, and the antagonists took the ground. The surprise which had made a coward of Mathews, had worn away and he now resumed the courage for which he was celebrated. We were to fire together, at a signal from Mr. Robinson. The word was given. My ball grazed the shoulder of Captain Math- ews, who fired in the air? "( How is this?"I exclaimed, " why did you fire in the air?" "Having received your fire, sir, I presume I may now without the imputation of cowardice,.solicit your attention for a few mo. ments to some observations I would offer. When you have heard me, it shall remain for your decision whether the affair shall pro- ceed. If it is your wish to fire again, I shall think myself justified in returning it, after the explanation I may offer, and the satifac. tion I have already afforded by receiving your ball." "I cannot refuse to hear you, sir; but our situation requires you should be brief." "If I could prove from the most certain evidences," said the Captain, '" that your daughter lives---" , :My daughter lives!" exclaimed I, "Pshaw, pshaw!-I saw her die--I saw the earth recieve her poor remains into its bosom r Why, then, the paltry evasion?" "I am patient," said the captain, I bear with the effusions of sorrow-----but, believe me, sir--if the unfortunate girl whom the madness of desire urged me to seduce, and whose name was   McFarland, residing at Mrsi Arthu-if, sir, this, was your daugh- ter; she still lives,;I saw her last:night,' . ::-' Saw her list night," I repeated, clasping my: hnds together.

I ' You-tiust haoe been deceived, -ir, by somAe strong resemblance of person, or some striking coincidence of circumstances-for, by Heaven, I repeat, Miss McFarland lives!" "Wonderful, wonderful!"I sighed. "After the strong impression of her death, which you have re- ceived, nothing will, perhaps, convince you of her existence unless you were to see her." "See her! see her!"I exclaimed, fearfully looking around me. "Is she nesr me I would rather embrace; the severest tortures cruelty ever framed! See her!-horrible!" and my whole frame shook as with a convulsion. "Your arm, my friend," I continued to Randall, ( I am faint." I reclined my head on Randall's shoulder. Mr. Robinson then advanced, and proposed retiring to his house, that Captain Math- ews might relate the story of the preceeding evening, from which I might draw my own conclusions. I submitted, and. by a slow walk we arrived there. I asked for a glass of water, and after ta- king it requested Captain Mathews to proceed. "It is a very considerable time, sir, since Miss McFarland and myself seperated. I would, if possible, avoid shocking your mind, but I am compelled to say, that Elinor's infidelity was the cause." "Facts, facts, sir, if you please, and spare your comments," said I. "Since our separation, I understand she visited Rome, Flor- ence, and several of the Italian States, in company with a young nobleman, whom at length, she left, and sunk into, that way off living." "I understand, sir, pray, go on," "From that period till last night, I have remained ignorant of her entirely, when I met her in company with Mr. Randall.
