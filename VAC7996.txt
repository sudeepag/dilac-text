what I have to say and what I have to show you."
"Now, then, Reveren4 Sir, the last three years of my wretched li~
have beezi passed daily in prayer and contrition. You have had doubt,
less~much experience among sinner8, do you think that amount of repent..
anec will avail to blot 9Ut the black record of at leaat ten years. of 4ate~,
able, diabolical wickedness?"
The sick man raised himself to a sitting posture, and, grasping ~Iie 1~and
of the clergyman, gazed into his fa~e with a look of such in~eu~ anxiety
and earnesiness, that the. latter for a mon~eu~ averted his head and though~
to himself:
"Is this really a man or a demon in the flesh 7"
.And he would fain have released himself from the j~ot, dry han~l that
held him and left the house. B~~t suddenly,, as b~ expressed hiftiseif, "
Aj.)irit of the Lord seemed to come upon him," az~d strenghtene4 him fo~
the scene that followed. And he replied;
"Poor sinful man, remember that the goodness of God ~s great and that
His blessed mercy endureth forever."
"Then, Bishop, why is it that there is a hell, and why is it that si~ners
g there, if all that is required of them is that they repent? ~' psked 2~ut'
ten with increased eagerness.
"Because they do not really and truly repent of their e~ns, ~'
"But how is .a sinner ~o know that he ,~ fo~giv~n? That is the
main point. Answer rue tl~a~ satisfnctorily, for ileaveigs sal~! ".
"He feels it in his heart. It comes to him like a gush ~f ~r~ght warm
sunshine in the very. midnight of cold and' darkness." ..
"He must bcome conscious of it just as lie becomes ~OJi5CIQU5 that he
4      lives and yet cannot explain how. Is~ that it?"
The dylug man half gasped, then slowly released ~e Bishop's h~an4~
and sank back upon his couch, never, however taking his strange, n~g~
netie eyes off the clergyman's f*~ce,, As his hea4 touch~l the, pi~low'~ he
said in tones of n~ter woe and despsir: ,, , ,
"Then all my three years, my eleven hundred days and ~ig~ts of re~

.poped they wpuld not trouble themselves about her~ When I found how
my mother, had, been treated 'by her professing Christian friends I was
much enraged, and' while I had only' bated religion and religious people
before, I now conceived a deadly desire to be revenged upon some pious
p~rsou. Indeed this dreadful idea becanie the ruling passion of my life.
I at once removed my mother to more comfortable quarters. until such
tiu~e as I, could buy a~hou~e and take her home to live with me. Com~
ing across this house and lot for ~sale, and liking it, I bought it and had
it ~'nrnished,. and in, due time my" mother was installed as its mistress.
Yet she and I did not agree well for the following reason. The' moment
her Church friends found' QUt her altered fortune they commenced to flock
round her and to bring her subscription lists for charitable objects. She
received them just as though they bad never treated her so contemptibly
as they had, aud wished4 to give them nioneyto help along with their
good works. I denounced them fiercely as hypocrites, and she excused
and defended them. 8o that she and I had frequent ebullitions of feel.
ing about the matter.
One day in conversation mother chanced to say" to me:
"My dear James, yen have the most singular temperament of any ntau
I ever saw. Now why do you not 'get' married, to some nice, respectable
3nd companionable girl? One who would make' you happy?"
The idea was, new to me, and made such a deep impression on my
minU that,' I could think of nothing else. And here, as at every other
turning point in~ '~y life Satan stepped 'in and moulded my design. I re~
solved t~ m~rry, b~~t at the same time 'it should be not fi~r love nor admir.
ation; but for~ sheer, diabolical deviltry~ I determined to marry the most
pious girl I eould fln4, and~ after she became my wife, to torture her in
mind and.body in every way my hellish genius could invent or devise.'
Full of ~his wicked intention II conferred with' 'my mother as to who she
would marry if she were me. Very~mur~Ii j~leiised to see me entertain
the notion of wedlock~ my unsaspectin~ 'parent "named over eight or ten
exemplary young women any one of Whom shewas sure' would 'make me
~,gpod, kind and lovingwife~ But In particular ehe lauded Miss Mnrtha
Mprtou ~. good lookingand estimable young woman of twenty4our.' She
was an exceedingly devout church goer, and, 'howard wretch 'that I was,
the, fact that shehad not a relative'living, decided' me to eezect her as' my
My plot being thus conceded I quickly put it into execution. 'Martha
bad visited ~ur house once ~ twic~, and I told motherto invite her again,
tb$s time, ,t~ stay ~to tea. Martha gladly came, atid, during her stay 1
made ~yseIf as ~gre~ahIe as' I~ possibly could, wfttcbi~g her~ cbntinually
Ii~e a f~wIer wat~bes the innocent birdie is erisn'~ring,'to' see what effect

q~,t@d, ~nd l~eWild~rQd4 when, attb.time, of her 'starting for home I 'inei~t-

ed upon escorting her thither. When, oui reaching the 'house where sli.
lived, I asked her permission to pay 'my addresses to her, I knew, from
tiietr~nihliog a~eents of her reply, that her heart Was fluttering with alt
the ecstacy of new1y.~wakeued' delight '~'
During thenext six months I cooked' Martha most attentively; not
day or evening ~f the Whole time paying' without our seeiiig e~ch other
once or twice. At the ei~d' of' this tiw~ I proposed to her, a2nd was at
once accepted. She named a day of a month in advance, but I insisted
that no longer delay tbantwo weeks should be made,'giving as nvrejisoa
that I 'iVished to get settled down at once. Martha, evOr ready' tu please.
me, agreed to my notion and in a fortnight she became my wife. We
were married in this very room.

to come yet, that     but the
d~ein the perinhing,, guilty soul of Sutten. After ten mi~u~es' rest the late
ter ~'esizAied his confession.. ' '
During m~ mother's lifetime I confined my meditated brutality to prer
venting my wife from attending to her 'religious duties, to 'deriding. all
religious subj~cts ih1i~r presence. This continued f~ ~bout thirteen
mouths when my Wother died. Her death made n~ i~ipxo~ion whatever

My wife said ~o more; but, sobbing all the while, she divested he~selt
of her out door clotheS, put 7pn t~hose she us~zally wope, about the house,
a~d went dowz~ stairs to attend to some domestic affairs.
Meantime I retired to my study, ,or smoking room as I used to eall it,
azid, lighting r~y 9igar, I flung myself on ~he lpung~, and, fiend that I
was, actually luid there half the night levising by what plans and means
I could torture my victim, wife. I felt at the time that I was possesed of
the d~vil, and I gave my~e1f up to the dem9n with delight, instead of
ti'ying to thr9w off th~ hideous influence.,
It so happened t~s I lay thus studying my future action that I glanced
up at a book ease containing a number of volumes. Among these I not-
Iced One, entitled "The Tortures of the Spanish Inquisition," A moment
more and, I was 'runn~n~ over the leaves of the book, gloating upon the
engravings, especia1lytho~e whb~h showed the various eontriva~Ices that
Weleused'in the Ir~qui8ition to extort confessions from its victims.
"That's it I" I said gleefully to myself', and my only regret was th~t I
could not devour the, horrid instruction at once with my eyes, and so be
conversant with it by morning, when, I could begin to imitate it.
After, sketching here and there~ through the, volume, and reading such
paasr~ges as , particularly st~nck, my, fancy, I suddenly conceived the re-
solution to go to bed, get a good long sleep, afid go at the book in the
nipg~and study itfrom beginningt~ ei4 I ~id so, and early the sac
feeding day I was at my wicked task with all the ardor of an enthusiast
in ~ome good cause. As I read along through the book I wrote notes
here and there in it at such places where I thought the poignancy of any
toi~ture could be increased.
In the rni~ldle of my ,work, Martha called me to breakfast and I went
down to the meal actually in a good humor with her, from' the very fact
that I was about, .~o s~ortiy to he able to inflict upon her the most hor-
rible bqc~ly, tortures. ~ the progress 'of our breakfast I noticed my
wife every r~ow and thea, glancing furtively at 'me when she thou~l4 I
was npt looking at ~ier,
"Wh4c~o you ~,tare at me s~ for?" inquired I' with a scowi.
"Oh, James you do look so, strange about the, eyes, ~" replied my wife.
"I am beginning, my dear, to be afraid of you; that you will, kUl me. It
~ you do not love me any longer~~and~, do not want rue about you, pleas#
tell ii~eeo plainly, ~nd I will ~o away and not be any more burden or
tro~ible to you. ~
A~a wy~ wif~'s words fell upon my ears, I, felt a chill of apprehension
creep through rue, for the following reason. If I kept up my abuse other,
she would perhaps run away-~-escape' froi~ m~ aztd I should lose m,

her gaze upon my ey~s~ ,
"My dear Martha," said I, passing my arm about her Wai~t, and draw-
ing her uiwn my lap' "there is one secret of my life Ihave never told
you though I ought to have done so before we got married. It is that &amp;~
times I have a ver~r bad temper. Now, deane,, I am going to make a
strong and final effort to curb it and bring it under control. YQU believe@

I could always throw Martha completely off her guard by talking pious.
ly to her.
"Oh, dear James," indeed I wiU pray for you, night and day, in sea,
son and out of season. Let us kneel here and together pray to the Throue
of Grace."
She kneeled down., So did I, and ta1~e hold of her ha~d whil? she pour.
ed forth her pure heart in a most fervid appeal on my behaW Iurin~
the whole time she was thus engaged I was coolly calculating how much
torture she could endure without dying, and which kind of torture I
should apply to her first.
When we, arose I talked long and earnestly ~witb Martha in sue~ a
way as to completely disurb.i her of any auspicioa that m~ previous con.
duct might have aroused.

securely in the house so that it would be in~pos~ible for ,her to escape, an4
yet account for her sudden disappearance satisfactorily to such of her
church and other frien~s who ihight make inquiry concerning, her.
This gave me a gr~at deal of trouble, and plan after plan did I cast
aside as being no1~ spre, until I hit upon, the foPowing. I had some re.
f~    natives inOhio, near Xenia. Mp~rtlia's health~ not neing yery good~ I per~

one I saw to join ue in a farewelltea party; in fact did a~1 ip my power
to make the affair as noticeable as possible.
Meantime I gradually apx~ secretly purchased suitable lumber and car-
penters' and m~chh~ists' t6ol~, all of which I con v~yed to the upper rooms
of this hou~e. When I say secretly I~ncan so far as refuted to any neigh..

t~ention to minutiae as you will see,. 'and as each part played along into
the next, just like the tooth of a perfectly calculated ~ogw'he&amp;l works into
its counter, I actually rubbed my hands with glee.
Toward the middle of the evening's entertainment I took up a salver
of glasses containing nn~si~at wine. My wife took another, she serving
the gentlemen and I the ladies. I had taken care to count the guests
and" glasses and filled" several more than was necc~sary of the latter.
After we had coxnpletA. the tour of'tbe room, I adroitly dropped a small
powder into one of my glasses unseen by any person.
"Now, then, Martha," said I, "Jet you and I exchange a; glass of
Wine~ Here is one for you, and you give me one of yours.'
I took th~poWdered glass'froin m~ salver and put it in my wife's fiand;
she took one from hers and handed it to me.
"Now, dear," continued I, passing my arm through Martha's in such
a way that they interlocked, "you shall give the toasL."
"Then it shall be this," replied she, "Here's to all our dear friends,
present and absent. May love ever attend th~in and sorrow never come
to any of them."
"Especially may that be the happy fate of our beloved sister, Mrs.
Sutten I" added one of the guests 'as the toast was being drunk.
About half an ~hour later my wife came to m~ and complained of feel-
tug very strange and unwell, and said she would have to go up to her
room. My plan was working most admirably. Excusing her for a few
minutes and enjoining our friends to enjoy themselves, I led Martha up
stairs to her room, and assisted her gently to lie down upon the bed.
Immediately I bounded ,out upon the staircase to see if all was clear.
~o one was about. I rushed back, hastily raised my now half insensible
*ife in my arms andwith unnatural strength bore her into the upper
?oom, at the far end of which by means of long oaken scantlings I had
~onAti'ucted a c6xiinplet~ cage. Into this I thrust her, locked the door,
~nd then hurried 'sack into her bedroom, taking especial good care to also
locI~ the door of the roomccii.~taining the cage.
As I passed through my wife's apartment I placed upon her dressing
table a note which I had prepared during the day, handwritten in a hand
so like her own that no expert CQUld tell the difference. I then returned
to the parlor, and explained to our guests that Mrs. S~itten would come
sown in a few minutes, as she was only troubled' with a slight vertigo
to which she was subject but which never lasted long at a time.
An hour went on, and, as Mrs. Sutten had not yet made her promised
reappearance, somebody suggested that.Mr. Sutten should go up and as~
certain if she were better
I selected the most intimate one of Martha's female acquaintances, and

bad completely mastered its details, I set myself about the task of tuak,
ing one. Going up stairs, I ent~rcd the' gage, in which 1 kept ~Iar~ha;
and measured her head with a tape measure. Since the struggle I ha~
had with her, on the day she tried to escape, she had regained her origin.
al humility and resignation to, her fate. Her viol~uee on that occ~siop
resulted, I tiiinl~, from the effects of the narcotic I bad administered to
her.
"Oh, James," she now pleaded, as I passed the tape roupd her head,
"what are you gojog to do to me? Why are yo~ taking.the. dimepsioua

appetite for giving her pain and torture. With an awful oath, that I
will not repeat' to you, Bishop, 1~ pushed my poor wife from 'me, causing
her to fall heavily on her side, and I exclaimed with' rancour:
"Let you go, eb? Send you away from me so that I shall never see
you again. Oh, no, that would be depriving myself of the only pleasure
I have! No, lnd~ed)' you casting hypocrite,' I married 'you for the ex-
press 'purpose of t~srturing you to death. 1 have gone to' every expense,
to make my arrangements complete. 'You are doomed; tuind I tell yen!
You will never get beyond this teem. Rest assured of that. I hate
your chanting Chrisianity!"
"Oh, James, hav9 mercy upon me! be pitiful to me!" still pleaded
Martha.
"Not a whit' of mercy!" sneered 1, "not a whit. 'i've made up my
mind, that you shall suffer! Ha! ha! you shall be a rn~i~tyr, and I'll
make up a new edition of Fox's Book of Martyrs, and will immortalize
you and pass your name into history!"
When I said this, Mart~ha looked steadily at me for 'a moment or so,
and then,' in a voice, whose' strange, saintly accents haunt my ears now,
said solemnly:
"James' Sutten,' I an~ a poor, weak woman, without a human friend.
You are a ~trorxg' man, rich land with many friends; but I have One, who
~will not forsake me in my hour of trial. Blessed be His Holy ~ame, He
will not tutu away His Face from me.' All I can do is to submit to your
4~orture, if you are wicked enough ~ apply 'it. You may rack and destroy
~i4 frail bOdyr but my' so~il is beyond your power. My spirit, when loos..
~d from the clay, Will' 'ascend to Heaven, I hope, and be at rest forever
more."
She then fell upon her knees, and, raising her hands to Heaven, mur-
mured:   '     I
Oh my Heavenly Father, if I mtist drink of this Cup, giYe me, i
httmbly beseech Thee strength to bear up. Not my will but Thino be

With an oath I left my victim, with hell's malice rankling 'in my wick-
ed heart, and, going down stairs, got charcoal, made a fire in a portable
furnace, and commenced at once to manufacture the "brank." Being
particularly handy about mechanical contrivances, I succeeded very well
in my job, and after nearly a day's steady labor, I finished the instrument'

became lustreless, her faco changed white 28' warble, the l;erspiration
sprang out in heads at every pores and she uttered the most aiVfal moans.
Taking out my watch, I stood and watched my victim for ten minutes,
with all the ferocity of a ti~er. She went dawn' on her knees to me,
wrung her hands, shook her head and'pointed to the iron helmet, begging
me in her pain, to relieve her. Fludhig at the end of ten minutes that
she was likely to faint, if not speedily released, I undid the screw and re-
moved thebrank. All she said, when I did so, was:
"Oh! Oh!"
Then she sank down upon th~ floor in the corner, bui~iod her face in
her hands and cried bitterly, 'while there I stood laughing like a very"
fiend at her mental anguish and physical torturc.~ "Presently she raised
her head aud said piteously:
"Oh, James, give me some Cold water, j~t a little cold water."
"To he sure I will," replied I, and, going out' of the 'cage, I' got a
tumbler of water and brought it back to her. She drank it ofT at a
draught, but looked intently ~at~ a white powder-like sediment in the bot-
tom of the glass and then looked' at' me. I burst into a loud laugh, and
exclaimed:
"What are you gaping at? " That's pure st~ych~ ne
"Then I thank you' for it," said 'she, in reply "f3r I shall now be soon
out of your road forever."
"Ha! ha!" roared I, "you can keep' 'your thanks for so'     bCt~.
ter. That is ~iot strychnine but only a little gl~iping stuff, that will give
you some pain, but do you no injury."
"James! James! 'I hope God will forgive you for this studied cruciltv
to me. Surely you must be tinder the 'control of some fiend, to behave so
to me, who have never done yen any harm."
"Bab! "' I sneered, "the Devil himself 'and I are' tl;e best' of friends.

After my 'poor wife had drt~n~ the~,water, eh~ became convulsed with
the most terrible pains in the stomach, and holding herself with her hands,
~he rolled Qver the floor, groaning and ,scroarning
"NQne of~yorir. screaming now i~" ~xclahped I, seizing the brankin my
hand threateningly, "none otyour singing those psalms; or on goes your

Martha turned her eyes up to me, as much as to say that she would
obey me, and not scream out, and ~he thereafter only groaned heavily.
Be, after standing in the cage a short time, ii went out, closed and fasten..
ed the door, and with a final warning to rny'wife, to make no loud iiAses,
and a~ threat to put the hrank ~u her; I left the room and went down
stairs,
Dressing myself, in my out door costume, I fastened up the house in
the most. secure manner, and strolled off toward the city, where I' spent
the rest of the night in debauchery, with the exception that I was careful
not to drink any' intoxicating liquor. I had a constant" dread df liquor,
for fear it might at some time overpower 'no, cause me to expose my daily
wickedness, and thus rob me of my' victim.
I. arrived back home just before daybreak, and~ entering the' house I
bounded up stairs to the "Cage room,. '~ as I used to. call this apartment~
When I went in, I flashed a 'dark lantern npoa the cage. My wife. was
lying upon the floor in the corner of the enclosure~ She did not move,
when the glare of the lantern fell upon her upturned face, and. a fearcame
over, me that.she 'was~ dead ~t ast-~-all too soowfor thesatisfaetioa of~my

"Well, never mind about the ravens," I laughed, "your old devil
bawk-ab, I mean your dear, devoted darling husband; will bring you
something better than 'bread and cheese."
I then descended tq the kitchen, and though completely fa~ged out, I
prepared ~tn elegant meal for my prisoner. It consisted of boafsteak, fish,
~oysters, ham, sausage, potatoes; bread, coffee and so forth, quite nicely
cooked, for I had taught~ myself the culinary art from several first class
cookery books.
I took all these vianda, together with a bottle of wine, upstairs, and
spread it forth upon a table in the cage room, in sight of my victim, whose
eyes glistered. at the sight with all the longing of a half starved person.
When I had got the meal all ready~, the Devil prompted me to let it stand
thus within sight' of pooi' bungi~y Martha, and not allow her to eat a
n~orsel; thus affording myself the d4~light of a new species of torture
3314 t dreaded, as I havfi before told you, that if I inflicted too much upon
her,' she would break down and die. So I resolved to take her out of the
cage and let her enjoy the breakfast. I could at least inflict mental pain.
at the
Sitting down       table myself, I deliberately uttered a mock grace
over the various dishes. Then rising, I address~ my wife with the
words:
"Now~ if I let you out of that cage, to get your breakfast, will you be-
have yourself and walk back into the cage, as s6on as you have done,
like a good convict?"
"I will, .Thmes, '~ replied
"[Very ~vdl, then, come otit,'and eat as much as you want to."
As I spoke, I drew back the bolt, opened the cage door and let Martha
walk from the cage to the table. Though so excessively hungry, my wife
y~as in such dread' of me,'that, before tukin~ her 'Scat at the table, ~he
turned round and looked at me to see, if I approved. I nodded assent,
and she sat'down'iuid conimen&amp;~d' to eat. During the meal I did not in-
terfere with her; but took a sort of grim delight, in calculating, how much
strength she would gain by the food; she' ~o voraciously swalIow.ed~ and,
as a result how much mor ~Pire sh6'w'6uld'be able to undergo without
d'yin~'. It 'took her fully three fourths of.an hour to satisfy her appetite,
and then she rose and said:
"Must I g~ back into' the' cage,' James?"
"You must, my darling sugar plum ~f Christian sweetness!" rejoined
I, with gruel, delil~erate' emphasis.
Martha said ii~ more, 114 ~v'aiked straight back into her former abode
"May ~ h~v~' a chair dr'st661 t~ sit 4~wn' upon; James?"
"Yes, ~you~ m~y, my pious~ p~i hypocrite, " '~h~*~' Is one, ~' and I band-

to yourself. And you shall have plenty to eat and drink, three good,
square meals a day." '
Martha looked at me, as though within herself she were. saying:
"I wonder what fearful thing this man is preparing for me now." But
wisely enough, she said nothing except:
"I will thank you truly for your kindness, dear James."
Quickly I got all the articles~ of furniture I had 'mentioned, and placed
them in the cage. They nearly filled it up. I then locked the deor, so
that my prisoner should not escape, and, going to my bedroom, I went. to
bed 'and slept soundly till past three o'clock thatafternoon. Upon awaken~
ing, I rose and prepared supper for myself, and also for Martha. lle~
appetite was scarcely Ies~ than at hraakfast~
I h~d made up my mind to feed. my wife well, for a week or two, by
which time she would, I calculated, he strong enough for me to recom~
mence my torturing upon her.
SUTTEN RENEWS HIS CRUELTIES,
I kept up my "kind treatment," as I called it,,of my wire, for over
three weeks, by which time I had completely restored her strength anj
health, It was on a Sabbath morning that I recommenced my iniquitous
cruelties upon my poor wife., ~She~had just finished her breakfast, whichi
I had brought to her, and she had pu~e~ui~ed to pray aloud for me iu my
hearing. This enraged me to active hostilities. In the midst of her
prayer I seized the brank, flung back the swin~higpiee~, clapped it upon
Martha's head, and gave the screw a fierce turn, As she had her eyes
Closed, at the time, arid wns completely interested in her devotioius, ~he
was thoroughly unconscious of the approaching assault, until the instru~
i~uent of torture~Was secured upon her head.
On this occasion she did, not swoon as before, but leaped up and stag.
gered into 'the cage, whcre she,, clutched 4 the scantling bars in great
agony; but ~be di~1 notlook' towards n~e pleadingly, asahe did the other
time. This b~avery'and enclur4nco of h~ra rendered rue exceedingly furl.
ous, and, rushing after her into the cage, I seized ,the serew'h~ndle',an~
~gave it a fresh turn. It was too mi~ch, however, and, v~rithont a groan,
my wifa fell lnsen~ible to the floor. I quickly removed tho brank, heft
the cage, and locked her 'in, to recover when she might.
I was m~~ch chagrined to find my iron bonnW thus ~'faiIuro. Them I
began' to think it. over, ~nd.cn~nAe to thp ~o~clu5in, that it.wd~iPI he more
sn~cessful as ~ tor1t~ire, ,to merely ~unke Martha wear it eohtinuall~r, and,'
be careful, not to turn on the Screw~ ~o tightly ~t any onetime. ' Sub~'q..
quently I used to keep Vhe brapk, on my wife for six and ~eve~i daya at: 4

After she had lain, insensible for about an ., slowly began
hour she
to recover. I t~hereupon entered the cage, and removed, evt~ry article of
furniture I had. p1~ced there, with the exception of the 4esk'a~id chair.
M~ idea for leaving the~n there~ was to allow her to write down her
thoughts from time to time, as I thought the perusal thereof would afford
me a great deal ofamtzsem&amp;nt.
I zio~V begau~ 'to invent ne~ tortures. I remembered that my 'rife had
a 'mostr terrible aversion to monkeys, and, posting down to Baltimore I
purchased the moSt repulsive looking brute of the Moi~key tribe that 1
ever SaW. Qarrying~ it home, I took it up stairs, and, turned it loose in

monkey steadily, like one fascinated. Every motionr~ that thc animal

the cage, &amp;ok tefnge directly ben~ah bet' desk.
Martha moaned ~iteously, and, crowding herself back close against the

pointin~g at ~he monkey, made signs 'begging me to remove it.
"T~4~9 away your dear little' brOther frdm you?" laughed I; ":why

During the next ten days I adopted' a new species of torture. I ob-
tamed some ~hips of the quassia wood, anSI ground prickly ash bark.
*Pu'tting these into a large stone jug, I filled 'the latter with water nearly
to the top, and then added about a gill of pure alcohol. This I placed in
Martha's cage, and gave her nothing else whatever to eat or drink for
~three days. All the first day she would not touch it, moi~e especially be-
cause the monkey several times stuck his paws 'into 'it, and jabbered, when
he licked the hitter drink off them. But about midnight Martha's thirst
became so intolerable, 'that she was obliged to take a sip or two. Its
bitterness was disagreeable at first to her, but her palate soon becoming
'~sed to that, ~he dr~~nk more largely of it each successive time, that she
grew thirsty. Of courSe, UI)Ofl her empty stomach, this intensely power-
'ful 'tonic and appetizer speedily took effect, and on the second day, toward
ev~ping, Martha became ravenously hungry. To all her appeals for food
I told ker to go to the stone jug. In order also to add additional pangs
:to her sufferings, I cooked the most delicious and' savory articles of food,

THE CONTENTS OF THE MANUSCRIPT OBTAINED BY THE BISH~P.

For sometime after his arrival at home, the Bishop was sorely per;v1ex~
~d whether he should at once make his singular adventure public, or* let'
it die out. After giving the s~Ibj~ct prayerful consideration, beeonclAudedl
that it would be most advisable to allo~v the affair to remain asit' 1.hOTlA
was, until such time as he' could give it proper pu~ilication.A The nlann.i
script upon being examined by the Bishop, was found' to be a eoin~te
detailed history or confession ~f Sutten~s act of persecution and'torture'of
his unfortunate wife, together with descriptions of the various machineW
and instruments, which he had constructed for his hellish purpose; There'
was. also a sort. of diary, or 'rather jottings down of thoughts and lteehio~S!
bsr the poor' wife. Some of her writing was most hearttoucbing'aiid'itui
perusal caused the Bishop to shed tears: It is given further on; It' will~

40              TEN. YEARS OF. TORTURE; OR

increasing or decreasing coldness of the temperature, and noticing what
kind of clothing her husband ~vore~ Beyond this she was actually no-
thing mQre' than a.living corpse.
The only portion of the narrative left written by Sutten, which we omit
in the succeeding pages, is that part, giving substantially what the dying
manimparted orally to the Bishop: on his deaLli bed. Evidently Sutten,
wben he commenced the history, was the subject of the most poignant
remorse for what he had done to his wife.
THE WRITTEN CONFESSION.
"What a frigbtftil night I have passed! :If I trust myself to think
for a moment upon the events of the last ten years, I seem like a monster
whom~Satan, in 'companion, becomes. an innocent lamb. She has gone
to her reward, ~my poor, persecuted, murdered wife I Oh, Martha! angel
that you were, and now sainted spirit that you are, can you be looking
down up~n me now? Yes! yes! I can see your sweet, forgiving face
beating upon me, your. double-dyed guilty 'murderer. There is' no fury
in your eye, no hate~upon your countenance. All is love! all is forgive-
ness4 Oh, what is 'to become of. me? Though the mountains and rocks
were to fall upon me and crush me, my conscience would still torment
me'th~ same 'as it does' now. Though all the billows of the ocean were to
roll over 'me, they could not quench one jot li'or title of the fiery agony
that is consuming me.
I dread 'to call upon God for forgiveness, for He would surely destroy
me at once' for my presumption. I have heard so much and so often of
the forgiveness of the sins of the worst of malefactors. But when or
where' was there ever such a malefactor as I? Not in all history! Judas,
w'i~o'betrayed his Holy 'Master was not as bad as I have been. lie corn-
mitted his one enormous crime of the betrayal, while I have been guilty
of a series of enormous crimes for ten long, darksome years on God's
handmaiden.' Had I been an ignorant, outcast heathen, there might be
annie .sl)adow of excuse for me. But instead of that, I was the child of
God's household, brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
The' bri~ht' sun of righteousness was constantly illumining my wsy, so
that my feet ought not to have slipped nor my steps gone astray. Then
again our Saviour, when 'speaking of ministering to the wants of even a
little child,.He uses 'the language,' '~' And even as ye did it unto one of
these little ones, ye did it 'unto me. ~' That referred to the mere act of
givia~: a child a cup of cold 'watek'. 'The Master intended to show that
*~6u so small a kindness ,'done to a:little child, would be remembered
favorably to the giver' 'and would be looked upon, in the same light as
tk~ugh the leed had bQwa' .dono4o Ulniacif.

Now then,, if that be true, must not thereverse be also true? If a wick.
ed man had refused .toa little. thirsty child a cup of cold water, 'wotild it
not be remembered against him?. The Master Himself certainly neant
so, when He uttered the words: "Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these
ii We ones, ye did it not to me."
How then c~n I dare to priLy to God for forgiveness:after'rny ten years
of blasphemy and horrible 'wi&amp;kedness,. and bloody, worse than Pagan
'cruelty? Yet sometimes I think, God's power to forgive is cei'taialy co-
equal with. His power to ~uni'sh. With 'fear and trenil)liug I register my
vows l)efore Heaven, to humbly spend the remainder of my days, be they
many or few, in contrite sell-inflicted, suffering and repentance for the past.
Aii~l it may be, t:hat; in His Gr~t Mercy, my Heavenly Father may vet
vouchsafe meWs forgiveness4
Pray for me, spirit of my murdered Martha I.. my martyred wife!
Oh.my fellow men, who may read this narrative, you will see by read.
ing how a man may f&amp;ll under the dominion and power of the Devil, by
yielding too easily to the first temptation. The Arch Destroyer of souls
does not take possession of you all at once, for then His presence would
be so hideous th~t he. would be forthWith driven away. But he first gets
one foot on the threshold, 'and so 'grad uall~ Wdrks his~way into youi~ soul,
until he becomes your master and you cannot eject him; '
At first I ha~ intended tolet all my hdrrible deeds, committed in~secre-
cy, so far as human. obsei~vati~n ~vent, die out with myself, ~td 'riot per-
petuate by recordingtheni. But I' have changed 'my mind on thr~t" point,
and have determined to tell them to my fellow beings, to show what a
tearful demon a wicked.. wan may become by giving his l)USCI' passions
full sway over him. I"know . you will curse me as you reacI~ butyo~
cannot curse ~me worse than I have often cursed myself since my con-
science roused m~'.to.'a.fult appreciation ofwhat I had been guilty of.
Here the narrative begins, anJ we omit all of the first portion as fimras
$utten got in his recital t.o the l3isjrop.
I was obliged tO use a vast. amoumit of precaution in giving Martha
food after having starved herso completely during th~ 1)revious't~'n~day~
for, had I allowed her as. much, or even half as much, Ss her l'avenofls
appetite would have impelled her to' eat, she would have died, within
twenty-four hours.       ..' .       . .       .
Therefore I made her some moderately st!o~ig . beef tea and broke tip
two ounces of sailor's biscuit: in ohe gill ';~nd'a 'half of the tea. ~"This I
gave her in the x~o~n1ngthen'the sahie atintervals of.fourKh~iitts for t~6
days with an occasionall ~sip of 'te~ sngar~'.knd wate~, 'or. coffee: between
times. On .the third day I gave her some fresh bread and a small 'tiuit.'

powerft4 indeed, that ~within one month after I had commenced to re
~upprate tier physical powers, she was as strong and healthy as she used
to b~ previously.
Pouring all this time she. did not cease to pray almost continually, that
God would change my heart and send inea new spirit. This used to
make me frightfully angry; but I concealed my rage, because I' was
afraid that if 1 attempted any further infliction of corporeal torture upon
Martl~, she Would succumb under it, aria so' deprive me of any further
pleasure. I used to sit like a grim demon, grinding my~ teeth, and con-
* soling myself, tbat~ after awhile, when she was stronger, I would make
herf si~ffer four. fQld worse for. herprayers.
* Every day saw me working with hand' and brain upon some infernal
mechanical contrivance, which would inflict a maximum amount of agony
with a mininium amount of destructiveness upon the human frame.
~Wbile I was engaged in bringing my poor wife's 'health and strength
hack again, I worked most of the time in the lower part of the house as I
did not wish to have my object delayed by such mental torture and wor~
riment as her seeing me thus at workwould have produced. But after
she was well, it gave ~me a kitid of advance pleasure-if I may use such
a teriw,-4o let Martha behold me thus making the~ hideous preparations
for her torture.
In. addition to the monkey, that I had bought for the purpose of tern-
fying1~artha, I caught two enormous frogs, which I also shut up in the
room; where the cage was. These' reptiles were in truth most horrible
looking monsters, although of course perfectlyharmless. I got a small
wooden tank of water, which I placed close to Martha's cage, and in this
[threw the frogs, after showing them to my wife.
The creatures no sooner .obtained their liberty, than they leaped about
in all directions, all' over the' room, avoiding, however, both myself and
Martha..
"They are a little shy, yet, my dear," said I, as 1 thr~w them down,
but when they get to know you well~ why, theywill become as affection-
ate, as two i'abhits; they'll jump in your lap, and on'your' head, and kiss
yoi, ai~d if you'll only op~ii your' mouth wide' enough when you. pray,
they'll jump down your' throat. Then kigain they are most' magnitleent
singers, and when your monkey missionary gives ou~ a 'hymn or psalm~
tb~se two fellows will hell) you 'to' sing most' gloriously~
* "And that reminds me, that. you haven't seen your little missionary
for a couple of days Just wait till I fetch him. I have been getting a

went toward the'fro~s~ and witha stick drove them toward the cage. The
horrid looking creatures would not~go~ into the cagebtit bounded ami

deplorably teri4fled~ uly Wife Martha, or the monkey.
M'arthai got into one corner 'of'tbe cage, wringing her handa and'groan'

The monkey, that I had named John 'Wesley~ would' watch e~ry' mot
tion of the frogs, ah'd~' as fast as either made a' leap, the monk4 woi~ld
jump from spot to ~pot~ and fr~m bar: to bar of the cage, uttering each
time a shrill, ~aPspliVting shriek 'or'cry like that oPa human being. The
cunning. creature' noticed the 'fact that the frogs did not wish to g~t intO
the cage, ~ad he~ therefore, would' not come ~uteidO. At last I succeed
,r ed lh driving them close to' the bars, against which they~sprang. 1naktt~

nestled himself down by her side, and endeavored to push himself1 in~ be.t

~nally ti~y took, refuge in their tapk of water and :renwiined beneath the

w~as~ be~oming soinewJ~at um~d to the e,~hibit~on, II reaol~ed to vary it.
So, the next day I went down to the city. and purchased a rattle snake

floor, sounded like a wet rope. The momCnt afterward,.finding.~itself no.

to torture her with, "was what now rende~'ed me soifurious, and 'so, as' I
caught sight of Martha looking at me with so much pity, I gnashed"nmy

eating nte'~d' torturing" me'?" Surely' you would be happier yourself, to
have me serving you as a dutiful, affectionate wife, hying, ~ I would
faithfull3r' try', to please you "in everything. Would this not be more
pleasant for'y~u, than to have me' caged iu"h~re'like a wild beast, and to
bed aily and hourly adding to ~our'sins' by torturing a poor, weak help-
less woi~au like' me, who has never done aught to harm or offend you?"
"Why no,' of course not, you siniple' daughter of Zion. But never
mind now; I do not want any more of your chanting nonsense, Shut up
your mouth, and don't say another word to me, or I will' slap on your
iron b~n net end screw your infernal tongue clean' down into your throat,
so that you'll never be able to get' it hung again properly in your mouth."
My. wife said, no more; but wont away and ~at in the corner of her
sage, evidently in great dread' ef what I' might be going to do next to her.
THE iRON DOOT.
In the volume describing the various instruments of torture which were
used in the Spanish inquisition, I found a description of one that I took a
Iancy to try upon~my wife.. It was called the Iron Boot. It wus made
*f six iron. bands, each bent and fashioned iu such &amp; way, that when all
were' adjusted in tI~eir proper relirtiye positions, they formed a boot like
that usually worn 'by men. 'Ait the toe, instep, and top of the leg part
~vere set screws, by whIch a frightful compression could be made, causing
t~he victim npou whom the boot might be puts to suffer the most exquisite
torture.
When I had' made np'my mind to apply this horrible torture to my'
poor~ wife,, I ~et about the construction of the boot. I had already made
several machines of torture, but had used 'none i4 th6rfl as' y'et
Du~ing. all the time~I wa~ working upon the iron bott, Martha watched'
me with dreadfully increasing intcr~st, but she did not attempt to inquire
what it was.
One day when I nearly, badit completed, I held it up and said:
"Martha, guess what that ~ and who it is for.
~ty'poor wif~,1ooked atth~ ,boot, then at rue; and, with fear ~nd sorrow
ea her face,. replied: ' '' ' , "
I, cannot tell what it is; but I think It Is some new Instrument of ton.
'~re, and that it is Intended for me. "'             ,
' Verily, yon are an excellent guesser at first shot. Well, it. is for your

is this! Curse my soul, if I dou't!"
With this awful expression on my lips, I kicked Martha's bibi
across the room. Not satisfied with tbat, I bounded to the boc
taking it up, deliberately tore it leaf from leaf, spit on it, threw it
and ground it under my heel.
Poor Martha wept bitterly, and put her hands over her eyes
out the sight of my villainy. But she Aid not say unythiag to we.
One day shortly after this aflair, T bought several pounds of
snuff, and, taking it home, I threw the whole quantity over Marth

cowardly attack was to nearly strangle my wife, and give her fr
sickness, nausea and headaches for more than a week.

But .1 cannot go on, giving full details of everything ~ did. It
*                                     horrible. So let me hasten to the latter portion of the history.
It had been nearly ten years since I married M~rtba Mort0n
through my barbarous treatment she had been reduced from a
jiandsome woman to a mere wreck~ During all that long, time not
of love or affection had ever passed my lips to h~r, nothing but
ribald, obscene balderdash anA blasphemy. I had tortured her in
conceivable manner, going to every expense and trouble to invei
construct diabolical machines for my horrid purpose. I had used
one of these machines, tothe number of twentv~one, several times
and my inventk.n had ~t last failed. I could make nothing ne~v.
*   these had done their infernal work so well, that my poor wife was
gone. She could no longer stand up nor walk about for atiy leni
time; her breathing was broken *and short, her face was pale, a
pale as marble, her cheeks hollow, and most of hc'rtoeth gone. I ha
deliberately filed* many of her teeth, and then applied su~lphuric a

~y design. But I did waver the moment Ii entered the room. Perhaps
God had 'fixed the limit there, past which I was HOL to torture His saint
~ny more. Never before, during all the previous tei~ years had I felt as
Ii did that niorning, when this new sensation came over me. As the
strange thrill went through~ me, I thought of the' manifestation of God's
power to Saul of 'I'arsus, when that persecutor was on his way to destroy
the children of the Lord.
"God has strh~ken me through all the panoply of the Devil ! "' I gasp-
as I sank trembling on the floor.
Never was there a more terrified, abject wretch than I was at that iiio-
ment. I wept, and cried, and g:'oaned. Martha had been asleep, but,
'at the strange sounds, she started suddenly up, and gazed at me in pro-
found wonder. As~ I -beheld her looking at me through the bars of her'
cage, I exclaimed in my fearful agony:
"Oh! Martha! Martha! Martha!"
"What is it?" asked 'she, with anxiety in her voice, as with her wo-
~ian's intuitive perception, she saw that I was in earnest.
"What is it?" Oh'! that shall I do? what shall I do? God has
laid His hand on me at last! What a guilty wretch have I been! Here,
go free! go free! Leave this house, at once! Go down to the City, take
out a warrant for me, a~id let me be arrested and punished! Punished'!
Oh, Heaven! what punishment is there that man can inflict, which would
be' adequate for the hellish sufferings I have inflicted upon you, my saint,
my darling 'wife? Here, take this ~pistol and shoot me dead a.t your feet!
'See, I am kneeling before you, Martha!"
As I was uttering all these wild expressions, I leaped to my feet, hasti-
ly undid the door of the cage, drew my pistol, and, falling on my knees,
offered the weapon to Martha. Instead of using it, however,'~ my angel
wife put it down upon her bed, and then, with a cry that I shall never
forget, she kneeled 'before me, and, flinging her arms around my neck, she
almost whispered, so intense was her new delight:
"Thank Ood,~Jatnes! At lust! at last!"
Then she burst f a flood of te~irs, and wept, and wept, till I thought
her~heart would bre~k 'with joy. All ~he did, for almost half an hour,
was to cry, and ~ and kiss me fondly. At last she became calm enough
to talk, and then 'she said
ae4J~h, my dear James, I have been praying so long, so long for this. I
was afraid, I would die before you became convinced of the error of your
ways. I was afraid I should b~ gone from you forever, before you would
see fit to speak to' me one word ~f kindnt~ss, one syllable of loves 13ut,
thank God, it has come at last, and I can die happy!"
'Great Heaven, Martha!" exclaimed I, drawing my poor wire fondly
to my b~som, "after all the heinous crimes I have committed against
rou, after idi my blasphemy of your religion, how can you have aught

else than feelings of revenge and hatred? In return for my ten years of
cruelties and tortures, how ct~n you have only these tender sentences of
love?"
"Why, no, certainly not, James. Uow cQuld 1, and be a follower of
the Lord and Saviour, Jesus t~hrist?"
For a long, time I 'could not speak; but sat silently fondling M~rtha~
with all the childish fervor of a young lover., And she ,was equally as
much affected as I was. The emotions that swiftly coursed after each
other through my heart for the next hour, II could not begin to describe.
The strongest, most fervid language I might conjure up, would be a thous-
and fold too weak to paint theni.
At last we~ both calmed down ~sufficiently to talk about the future.
"The first thing I must do, Martha, is to make, reparatioii to you. Yoti
must get well and strong again. Let me see, the tenth day of next month
is the date ott which I gave that paxty, and invited all your friends 'and
acquaintances here for the demon-like purpose of blasting your fair name;
that I ought to have defended with my own life. No wonder that you
said, you would, never forgive me for that."
"Yes, but IL do, dear James; I do forgive you, even for that. Because
ydu certainly would not have done it, if you had been in your right mind;"
rejoined Martha, quickly interrupting me.
"Well~" resumed I, "whether ,or not, I am going to invite all tho~
self same persons here again on' the tenth, and, before them all, I shall
confess my fault, my wickecfness toward you.
"Never, James, shall you do such a thing. I would not have any one
know that you did it;" hastily rejoined my noble wife. "No," continu-
ed she, "I shall not live long, and, while I live, I do not 'wish to re-enter
society. The few friends I had, doubtless consider me dead and gone,
and so let me remain to them-among the departed. Your love for the
rest of my short days is all I ask."
"But what shall I say if any of them happen to see you?" asked I.
"Tell them that I came back to you, that you and I:a~e friends again,
and not to ask you an~ more questions About it."
"Oh, my dearest Martha, you are, indeed, a faithful Christian. Yot~
are really a true disciple and follower of the Saviour of mankind. But
oh, my darling, when I think of the hprrid blasphemy of which I have
been guilty, to say nothing of my frightful persecutions of youself, I fe4
that there is no forgiveness for me."
"My dear James, yoi~ might as well doubt God's power to creatO, orto
destroy, as to doubt Ills power to forgive. Xou must pray to Him. Arid I
will help you I will pray incessantly for you, James, till you feel that your
sins against the Creator ar~ forgiven."
'Nearly all of that day Martba and I spent in talking, much of ~hiisJt~

young lQverS. But it was not so to us, who bad been estranged for tea
tong, weary..yoa~s of wretebedness and suffering, and torture on the part
of my poor wife..
During. the 'day abe. did not Wish to go outside the house, but just at
sunset she thought~ she would like to~take a little walk into the surr~und~
ing country. The. weather was na~at delightful, the atn~o~phere being
clear and the air 'balniy. ' When Martha'.went to dress herself, she found
that all her. clothing had become moth eaten, or so rotten with' nijidew' as
to falito piecca tit her touch. "I f4~lt very contemptible~ when I saw her
dresses~ and shawls, and other gai~nients thus ruined ~ but, passing my
a~rm about her, I said:
"Never' miad,' dear Martha, I will' go to 'the city tomorrow, and you
shall have plenty of 'every thing you want."
"You are very' good to me, James," replied my wife, kissing me 'in a
fond, childish' w5y;'t but don't go buyL me too much; Just get some-
thiag plain and genteel to be in 'ahont' the house here, aut~l to take an oc~
caslonal stroll with you into the country. "±
So, instead of walking out that evening, Martha and Isat out on the
back porch ofthe house, saying nothing about the past,'bul~ con~'ersiiig in
~lowing tei"n~s, about the future. We' sat 'close together as~ we talked,
mueb like the marble statuettes I had so often 'seen of John Anderson, my
Joe. Martha~ 'w~hId' persist in holding one of my bands in b~h of hers,
~d eveiy now and then she would say':'
"James, I are so glad to have you love me once Inure. '~"'
Sometimes' sb~ would even stop 'abruptly itt some unfinished . sentence,
and, without any apparent' ettuse, to' repeat" thin to me.
At last it, became 'too damp' to slt on the porch 'any' longer; and' I led
Martha int~' the house.
"Dearest Martha,," said I, 'as we entered the kiteheu, "suppose yoa
get us a little supper ready."
~My wilb looked at me, and was in the act of waking some reply; but
instantly caught' herself, evidently' taking' a ,second thought, ~h~t what
she was about to say might perhaps' hurt my feelings.~ Then she~chang~~
tid it, and 'replied:
"Indeed 'I' 'will, with 'pleasure, dear 'James, though, 'from lack of prae~~
tice, I may not please 'you as well' as I' could otherwise."
"~Well, 1' will help you," said' 1. "First I will make, up' the fire, grind'
the coffee, and cut a nice slice of hare',' whilo you peel the potatoes. You
will find the tbing~ i~ the same p~Iaces' nearly as~ they were before '
I stumbled here in my spee&amp;~, and; as the 'hot blood; mantled to my face,
I finished' with the words, "as th~y used' to be. "
Martha and I soon had supper ready', and sat down to it side by side.
~at she' did not cat very much, and; 'when I urged her to do co, she're-
plied4:  '                     "

"Oh, James dear, I am too happy to eat."

After this pleasant evertilig 'meal was over, and Martha had cleared awa~*
the dishes, she and' I went up stairs to what, when we were 'first mnrried~
used'to be our sitting room.
"Now, my dear," said I,'let me begin my'repettauiee at ohee. You
have had your tortures; mine are now t~' begin. I drbad, oh, I 'dread se

Heaven leading Satan to supplicatio~i. And whaixa touching; beautiful,
~e~vent prayer' did my wife pour forth in my behalf. As for me .1 could
r~ot pray. I could only listen to her words, wring ~my~ hands, and weep
like an infant.
Soon after we retired. How strange it seemed to me, who. for ten years
past, had lain in n~y lair at night like ~onw misanthropical, wild, beast or
id~mon; all alone, to slumber, or study, ans~I toss about ~restlessJy; coneout~
'lug some infernal deviltry for the morrow. How strange, I repeat, it
seemed to me now t~ enfold in my arms my wife, who had been ruthless-
ly, brutally, banished from there for a whole decade of her lifetime. As I
thns clasped her to m~ throbbing bre~mst, I said:
"' Would to God, Mai'tha, it 'ha~d always been thus I"
"Oh, James,~~ replied she, with the old expression, "I am So glad to
have you love .me once mo~e~~
It was a long' time before I went to sleep, though Martha fell into a
sound slumber soon ~after she had nestled her head upon my shoulder..
Several times, while I' was awake, shehalf murmured some broken word;'
ai~d clung tighter to me with her clasping, arms, as though she were dream..
lug of some new separation. I would always soothe her then with ten-
der expressions of endearment, 'and draw her closer to n~e..,.
The next day immediately after brem~kfast-which meal Martha prepare~
~d entirely herself.-I wont dowa' to the city and did not get hack till
night, so occupied was I with' making purchases of such things as I
thought would be useful to, or gratify my wife. Among other things I
bought a beautiful horse and earria~re, cspec~ally for Martha, whom I knew,
after her long term of incarceration and sufferings,, would be in no con~~
~ition to walk for sometime. Into this vehicle I loaded my other pur-
chases, and drove b'omeward~at a' rapid rate.'
As I came up the road that commanded' a view of my 'house, I could'
see the pale face of my wife,' pressed; against the sittir~g room window.
She was watching for me. Pulling out my handkerchief, I waved it to
her to let know that it was I coming. Instantly she disappeared,'and in~
a few moments 'more she was standing out. on the porch, ready to' 'wel-
come me.
"I have been, very lonesome Without you, dear James," exclaimed
Martha, as I sprung from the carriage, and t~ok berm, my arms.
"And I have been as expeditious as I possibly could, ~darling, consider..
Izig the quantity .efjuy purchases. ~Just wait till I get all into tha house,

SUTTEWS DL4TH BED CONFESSION.
The next day was taken up with examining the different dress patterns.
laces1 linens, muslins and So. forth, that I had fetched home. Before I
married Martha, she had been aseankstre~5, and so, now she quite handily
made up all the dresses and the garments she needed. Two weeks were
required, before she had enough done to enable her to appear before auy
one. Then I advertised for doi~estic help, in response to which ,I got*
two servants for Martha, in order that she should have nothing ~vhtttever
to do except, to oversee the affairs of the household.
My wife had been nearly six weeks restored to her proper position as
my wife, and she seemed to be improving in her health~ One day she
and I took a drive (Iowa the pike. The afternoon was a most lovely one
when we started out, but, all of a sudden the sky grew overcast, and ~
chilly, the rain commenced, that drenched us both to the skin, before we
reached home. The moment I got back, I took every precaution to guard
against any ill effects of the wetting Martha had received. I could but
compare this solicitude with my former criminal carelessness and murder,
ous cruelty toward Martha.
Notwithstanding all this, however, my poor wife's shattered frame and
constitution, shattered by. my wickedness, had not strength enough to re-
pulse the attack of cold, which followed, and within five weeks from the
day of her ride, my darling wife breathed her last in my arms, of what
the three eminent physicians, I called in to attend her, called "Gallopin&amp;
~onsumption.~~
On the day she died, Martha would not bear me out of her sight.
" Please do not leave me, dear'James, for the end is very near now; if
I live till sunset, it will be as much as I can do, Hold me in your arms,
dear, till I am gone. It will be like going to sleep on your bosom, as I
did in the long ago."
I took her off of the bed-she was so wasted away as to be ho burden
whatever-and sat down in the large, cushioned chair. The mere lifting
exhausted her so much that for several hours, she could not speak, and
she just lay like a baby gazing up into my face with her b4ght, happy,
blue eyes fixed on mine.
Oh, Martha, if you could only get better," I kept ~ialf moaning to
myself.
At last when she could speak, she replied:
"I shall soon be better, dear James; so~n be better now. Tonight
will be my glorious morning. Presently I shall fall asleep, and when .[
wake 'again, it will be in Heaven., I .wi~h I could only tal~e you with
me"
As my wife said this, it~seemed like a signal to my conscience; to spring
upon me ~nd rend my vitals like the' Vulture of Mythology~ And I
groaned in spirit.. To go with her,. my sainted wife, "wonl4 be~the acm4

of felkity. As I thought of my crimes, I -felt certain that I would ne-va
gotoher-no matter how sincerely I repented.
The sun- 'was just going down, leaving a long, warni yellow shaft of
light -to move slowly up the wall toward the ceiling. Martha glanced
once in awhile at this shaft of fading light, and just as it disappeared, she
said in-the &amp;ld, childlike way:
0-h, James, I feel I am so glad, so happy to have you love me once
more. Kiss me!" -
This request -was made in - such a strong, earnest tone of voice, that I
atarted,- and looked more intently at my wife. Her tone was so much
like tjiat- Qf a person hurried by taking leave, -that I said to myself as -L
kissed her: - -

"Oh James, I am-so glad to have you love me once more."
.1 instinotively looked upward, for I could have taken oath, that the
~oice- which repeated these words of Martha's was in the air above me.
Yet it was her voice.
When I gazed - down upon my -Martha again, she had died, and in my
arms rested only her earthl~r form. I kissed the wan, thin lips again and
- again; and again; and tried- to -make - the wasted arms twine about my
neck. But the spirit was gone,- and they fell heavily away frorti me as in
i~ev~nge for my former wickedness:
Then- I rose and laid the corpse upon the bed, and straightened and
eompoeed the limbe. -Then Ileft the honee and wandered I don't know
where till morning. Then I returned home, and, from that moment -till
the funeral. was over, I never left my dear, departed Martha.
Subsequently I discharged my servants, and lived the life of a hermit.

[Bishop Willi-an~s, when he visited the cemetery to sea this strange
tomb stone, found it on the wife's grave. rvhe latter was most beautiful.
ly adorned, by the repentant husband's own band. The' mouzid. itself
was perfectly rounded, the shape being secured so as to last for 'a-long,
lorg time, by a most ingeniogs arrangement of fragments of stone. The
grass on it also differed from that on the surrounding graves, it being of
a richer, brighter green. It was quite likely grown fr mseed; that Sutten

of a dark leafed, over-green, ground ivy was trained and pruned so as to

niarbleii~ the shape of~a classic shield. It-s size w~ about-twenty one

scription on it -was simply the expvession of Mrs. Sutten's, that made
such a deep impression on the-husband:

especially about funerals and grave yards. We hare noone-belonging to

.74               TBZ~ YEARS OF' TORTURE; OR
"Oh; I knew that well enough," she answered, "because of the way
you behaved whenever I saw you at the grate. You '~vould ~ot have
done so to a little child, nor a man, nor any one you did not love very
much. Please Sir, did you not always love that lady, your wife, a great
~deal4"
"'I could not brave the truth to that innocent young creature, who diii
not know how ehe pierced my soul with her question, and I lied to her as
"I said:
"Vertainly my~child."
She and her grandmother both walked along with me, until I reacin~d
Martha's grave and remained there, until tbe' marble tablet had been
properly adjusted in its position. Both then bade me good day and I saw
them no more.
When I returned home I got down the scrap book .in which my poor
wife had recorded her feelings from tinie to time during the long, dreary'
years, I had her shut up ii~ the horrible cage. These tortured me when.
ever I perused them, but there was a fascination about them that it was
entirely impossible for me to resist. There was one in particular which
invariably met my eye first somehow or other. It was penned the next
day after I had crushed Martha's limb in the Iron Book' It was this:
"Yesterday James put me to a new and dreadful torture, thatof screw-
ing my leg un in a kind of iron boot which is so constructed, that, by the
turning of different sets of screws I was put to' the most excrutiating
agony. I thought at one moment that I would go completely out' of my
mind with pain. But, thank God, who gave me power to endure this
new ondeal of my faith, I triumphed nt last.
"Again and again the question recurs to me, why does James treat me
in this barbarous manner?' Had I been his worst enemy he could not
treat me more dreadfully than he does.' 'Yet I have never spoken an ill
or harsh word to him.
~'But he cannot always be this way~ He is p6ssessed 'i~ some myste-
rious way by the Evil One. Satan has him iii his clutches and he is
forced to do his bidding. Again some times I think that God allows all
this that lie may try m'e and' see if I am worthy to be considered His
hand maiden. Thus far I believe F have proven my faith in the powel'
of God by my endurance of the tortures to which I have been compelled
to submit.
"Sometimes the flesh is weak, and I feel the rising' of runruhurs in
my~ heart. Then the clouds gather around me' and all beccx~ies dark.
But like Christian in the Pilgrim's Progress I rouse myself, call' upon
my $av.iour, and at once a brilliirnt star of light breaks through and
disperses all the clouds ; my murmurs' are hushed, my repiningS
give way to rejoicings' and I 'become as contented and as happy as
though I had n~ care, nor sufferings in' the world. Oh, my

SUTTEN'S DEATH BED CONFESSIO~J.
Savior, my Blessed R6deemer 'I thank Thy floly Name for all Thy by'..
ing kindness. Vouchsafe to me in the future, as in the past, strength to
drink of whatever cup of bitterness may be put to my lips.
"But, above all, I beseech Thee; in the plentitude of Thy Mercy, to
forgive my husband and remember IIdt his transgressions against him
He knows not what he does. Satan bath bound him in his chains, and
he cannot escape without the iifterposition of Thy power. Pluck him, I
pi'ay Thee, as a brand from the 'burning. Save him, unto life eternal, that
his soul may not perish but may be held~ precious in Tby sight~
A nothea' extract reads as~follows:
"My head aches*~ dreadfully this morning. I do not know how long
James intends to treat me as he is doing now.. Surely it must end soon,
for I cannot much longer bear up under it. Oh, my dear husband, would
to God some beneficent angel would only kring you a new heart and ~
right spirit from on High, that you might ~ee the error of your ways and
repent.
"Often times I think what a dreadful thing it would be if you were to
die suddenly, unrepentant an~l in ~he full fiowir of your Bins againstRea.~
yen., Everyday, yes, and every hour nearly, I pray, that God will not
look toward you in anger, but in His Great Mercy save your precious
soul for life eternal."
The last entry in Mrs. Sutten's diary is one which was made after the
great and happy change had taken place in her husband, It reads like
the perfection of felicity.
"At last my prayers are answered. The clouds which have hung so
gloomily and heavily athwart my skies are broken, and the bright, warm
sun shines through. It is like the sudden coming of Summer with its
pleasant flowers and song birds in the middle of the Winter; The dreary,
frightfully dreary ten years of torture and misery and horror are passed
and gone forever. The tritul has been a dreadful one; but I thank my
God with my whole heart that I have been endowed with strength to
hear meekly the tilbnlations, to which I have been sul~jected. It isal~
for the best; all for the best."
Here the mhnuscript broke off and Bishop Williams could not find any
continuation of it, though it might have been mixed in with the 'heap' of
papers which encumbered the drawer. Never before has there been a
case, at least that we have any record of that has presented such charac-
teristics as that of John Sutten and his wife.
Sutten was evidently an intellectual human tiger; that is the only ex-
pression which will convey anything like an adequate idea of the man's
Organization. His moral part was perfectly dead. Bishop Williams, Ia
