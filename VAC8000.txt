RACHEL SUTTON  was a born match- maker, and she had cultivated the gift bydili- gent practice. As the sight of a tendrilled vine suggests the need and fitness of a trellis, and a - stray glove invariably brings to mind the thought of its absent fellow, so every disengaged spinster of mar- riageable age was an appeal pathetic and sure -to the dear woman's helpful sympathy, and her whole soul went out in- compassion over such " nice " and un- appropriated bachelors as crossed her orbit, like blind and dizzy comets.  Her propensity, and her conscientious indulgence of. the same, were proverbial among her acquaintances, but no one -not even prudish and fearsome. maidens of altogether uncertain age, and prudent mammas,    DE3WLESS ROSES. equally alive to expediency and decorum-had ever labelled her "Dangerous," while with young people she was a universal favorite. Although, with an eye single to her hobby, she regarded a man as an uninteresting molecule of animated nature, unless circumstances war- ranted her in recognizing in him the possible lover of some waiting fair one, and it was notorious that she reprobated as worse than useless - positively demoral- izing, in fact -such friendships between young persons of opposite sexes as held out no earnest of prospective betrothal, she was confidante-general to half the girls in the county, and a standing advisory committee of one upon all points relative to their associations with the beaux of the region. The latter, on their side, paid their court to the worthy and influential widow as punc- tiliously, if not so heartily, as did their gentle friends. Not that the task was disagreeable. At fifty years of age, Mrs. Sutton was plump and comely; her fair curls unfaded, and still full and glossy; her blue eyes capa- ble of languishing into moist appreciation of a woful heart-history, or sparkling rapturously at the news of a triumphant wooing; her little fat hands were swift and graceful, and her complexion so infantine in its clear white and pink as to lead many to believe and some- I need not say of which gender -to practise clandes- tinely upon the story that she had bathed her face in warm milk, night and morning, for forty years. The more sagacious averred, however, that the secret of her   DDEWLES8 R OSES.      . - 9 continued youth lay in her kindly, unwithered heart, in her loving thoughtfulness for others' weal, and her avoidance, upon philosophical and religious grounds, of whatever approximated the discontented retrospection which goes with the multitude by the name of self- examination.         I Our bonnie widow had her foibles and vanities, but the first were amiable, the latter superficial and harm- less, usually rather pleasant than objectionable. She was very proud, for instance, of her success in the pro- fession she had taken up, and which she pursued con amore; very jealous for the reputation for connubial felicity of those she had aided to couple in the leash matrimonial, and more uncharitable toward malicious meddlers or thoughtless triflers with the course of true love; more implacable to match-breakers than to the most atrocious phases of schism, heresy, and sedition in church or state, against which she had, from her child- hood, been taught to pray. The remotest allusion to a divorce case threw her into a cold perspiration, and apologies for such legal severance of the hallowed bond were commented upon as rank and noxious blas- phemy, to which no Christian or virtuous woman should lend her ear for an instant. If she had ever entertained " opinions" hintingat the allegorical na- ture of the Mosaic account of the Fall, her theory would unquestionably have been that Satan's insidious whisper to the First Mother prated of the beauties of   10       JDEWLES8 ROSES. femn;nmne individuality, and enlarged upon the feasibil- ity of an elopementfom Adam and a separate main- tenance upon the knowledge-giving, forbidden fruit. Upon second marriages-supposing the otherwise indissoluble tie to have been cut by Death -she was a trifle less severe, but it was generally understood that she had, grave doubts as to their propriety - unless in exceptional cases. "When- there is a family of motherless children, and the father is himself young, it seems hard to require him to live alone for the rest of his life," she would allow candidly. "Not that I pretend to say that a con- nection formed through prudential motives is a real marriage in the sight of Heaven. Only that there is no human law against it. And the odds are as- eight to ten that an efficient hired housekeeper would render his home more comfortable, and his children happier than would a stepmother. As for a woman marrying twice"--her gentle tone and eyes growing sternly decisive-" it is difficult for one to tolerate the idea. That is, if she really loved her first husband. If not, she may plead this as some excuse for making the ven- ture-poor thing I But whether, even then, she has the moral right to lessen some good girl's chances of- getting a husband by taking two for /herself, has ever been -and must remain a mooted question in my mind." Her conduct in this respect was thoroughly consist-   DEWLESS: ROSES.        " ent with her avowed principles. She was but thirty when her husdand died, after living happily with her for ten years. Her only child had preceded him to the grave four years before, ar-d the attractive relict of Frederic Sutton, comfortably jointured and without incumbrance of near relatives, would have become a toast with gay bachelors and enterprising widowers, but for the quiet propriety of her demeanor, and the steadiness with which she insisted - for the most part, tacitly-upon her right to be considered a married woman still. "Once Fredericks wife - always his!" was the sole burden of her answer to a proposal of marriage re- ceived when she was forty-five, and the discomfited suitor filed it in his memory alongside of Cwesar's hack- neyed war dispatch. She had laid off crape and bombazine at the close of the first lustrum of her widowhood as inconvenient and unwholesome wear, but never assumed colored apparel. On the morning on which our story opens, she took her seat at the breakfast-table in her nephew's house.--of which she was matron and supervisor-in-chief - clad in a white cambric wrapper, belted with black; her collar fastened with a mourning-pin of Frederic's hair, and a lace cap, trimmed with black ribbon, set above her iux- uriant tresses. She looked fresh and bright as the'- early September day, with her sunny face and in her daintily-neat attire, as she arranged cups and saucers t .          '   DIWLESS ROSES. for seven people upon the waiter before her, instructing the butler, at the same time, to ring the bell again for those she was to serve. She was very busy and happy at that date. The neighborhood was gay, after the open-hearted, open-handed style of hospitality that dis- tinguished the brave old days of Virginia plantation- life. A merry troup of maidens and cavaliers visited by invitation one homestead after another, crowding bedrooms beyond the capacity of any chambers of equal size to be found in the land, excepting in a country house in the Old Dominion; surrounding bountiful tables with smiling visages and restless tongues; dancing, walking, driving, and singing away the long, warm days, that seemed all too short to the soberest and plainest of the company; which sped by like dream-hours to most of tl e number. Winston Aylett, owner and tenant of the ancient mansion of Ridgeley - the great house of a neighbor- hood where small houses and men of narrow means were infrequent-had gone North about the first of June, upon a toui of indefinite length, but which was certainly to include Newport, the lakes, and Niagara, and was still absent. His aunt, Mrs. Sutton, and his. only sister, Mabel, did the honors of his home in his stead, and, if the truth must be admitted, more accept- ably to their guests than he had ever succeeded in do- ing. For a week past, the house had been tolerably well filled ditto Mrs. Sutton's hands; ditto her great,   warm heart. Had she not three love affairs, in differ- ent but encouraging stages of progression, under her roof and her patronage And were not all three, to her apprehension, matches worthy of Heaven's making, and her co-operation A devout Episcopalian, she was yet an unquestioning believer in predestination and ^ special Providences "- and what but Providence had brought together the dear creatures now basking in the benignant beam of her smile, sailing smoothly toward the haven of Wedlock before the prospering breezes of Circumstance (of her manufacture)?  While putting sugar and cream into the cups in- tended for the happy pairs, she reviewed the situation  rapidly in her mind, and sketched the day's manceu- vres. First, there was the case of Tom Barksdale and Imo- gene Tabb -highly satisfactory and creditable to all the parties concerned in it, but not romantic. Tom, a sturdy young planter, who had studied law while at the Uni- versity, but never practised it, being already provided for by his opulent father, had visited his relative, the Tabbs, in August, and straightway fallen in lo; with the one single daughter of his second cousin--a pretty, amiable girl, who would inherit a neat fortune at her parent's death, and, whose pedigree became identical with that of the Barksdales a couple of generations back, and was therefore unimpeachable. The friends on both sides were enchanted; the lovers fully per-   w14: .     DEWLESS ROSES. suaded that they were made for one another, an opin- ion cordially endorsed by Mrs. Sutton, and they could confer with no higher authority. Next came Alfred Branch and Rosa Tazewell -in- cipient, bqt promising at this juncture, inasmuch as Rosa had lately smiled more encouragingly upon her timid wooer than she had deigned to do before they were domesticated at Ridgeley. Mrs. Sutton did not approve of unmaidenly forwardness. The woman who would unsought be won, would have fared ill in her esteem. Her lectures upon the beauties and advan- tages of a modest, yet alluring reserve, were cut up into familiar and much-prized quotations among her disciples, and were acted upon the more willingly for the prestige that surrounded her exploits as: high priestess of Hymen. But Rosa had been too coy to Alfred's evident devotion--almost repellent at sea- sonsi Had these rebs not alternated with attacks of remorse, during whict the exceeding gentleness of her demeanor gradually pried the crushed hopes of her adorer out of the slough, and cleansed their drooping plumes of mud, the courtship would have fallen through, ere Mrs. Sutton could bring her skill to bear upon it. Guided, and yet soothed by her velvet rein, Rosa really seemed to become more steady. She was assuredly more thoughtful, and there was no better sign of Cupid's advance upon the outworks of a girl's heart than relerie. If her fits of musing were a shade   DE!WLES8 ROSES.      f - 15  too pensive, the experienced eye of the observer de-  scried no cause for discouragement in this feature. j Rosa'was a spoiled, wayward child, freakish arid mis- chievous, to whom liberty was too dear to be resigned 'I without a sigh. By. and-by, she would wear) her shackles as ornaments, like all other sensibleand lov-  ing women.                ' Thus preaching to Alfred, when he confided to her  ! the fluctuations of rapture and despair that were his lot in his intercourse with the sometimes radiant and  inviting, sometimes forbidding sprite, whose wings he  would fain bind with his embrace, and thus reassuring a: herself, when perplexed by a flash of Rosa's native per- I verseness, Mrs. Sutton was sanguine that all would   ! come right in- the end. What was to be would be, and : ; despite the rapids in their wooing, Alfred would find. in Rosa a faithful, affectionate little wife, while she  could never hope to secure a better, more indulgent,  i and, in most respects, more eligible, partner than the  Ayletts' well-to-do, well-looking neighbor.  .    :i But the couple who occupied the central foreground ' :  of our match-maker's thoughts were her niece, Mabel  - Aylett, and her own departed husband's namesake,  Frederic Chilton. She dilated to herself and to Mabel .. with especial gusto upon the "wonderful leading," the 'J inward whisper that had prompted her to, propose  a trip to the Rockbridge Alum  Springs early in July, ' i Neither she nor Mabel was ailing in the slightest de-o   DEWLZESS ROSES.  gree, but she imagined they would be the brighter for a glimpse of the mountains and the livelier scenes of that pleasant Spa--and whom should they meet there but the son of" dear Frederic's" old friend, Mr. Chil- ton, and of course they saw a great deal of him-and the rest followed as Providence meant it should. "Thle rest" expressed laconically the essence of numberless walks by moonlight and starlight; in- numerable dances in the great ball-room, and the sweeter, more interesting confabulations that made the young people better acquainted in four weeks than would six years of conventional calls and small-talk. They stayed the month out, although "Aunt Rachel" had, upon their arrival, named a fortnight as the ex- treme limit of their sojourn. Frederic Chilton was their escort to Eastern Virginia, and remained a week at Ridgeley - perhaps to recover from the fatigue of the journey. So soon as he returned to Philadelphia, in which place he had lately opened a law-office, he wrote to Mabel, declaring his affection for her, and su- ing for reciprocation. She granted him a gracious re- ply, and sanctioned by fond, sympathetic Aunt Rachel, in the absence of Mabel's brother and guardian, the correspondence was kept up briskly until Frederic's second visit in September. Ungenerous gossips, en- vious of her talents and influence, had occasionally sneered at Mrs. Sutton's appropriation of the credit of other alliances-but this one was her handiwork be-   DEWLESS ROSES.        17 yond dispute - hers and Providence's. She never for- got the partnership. She had carried her head more erect, and there was a brighter sparkle in her blue orbs since the evening Mabel had come blushingly to her room, Fred's proposal in her hand- to ask counsel and congratulations. .Everybody saw through the dis- creet veil with which she flattered herself she con- cealed her exultation when others than the affianced twain were by- and while nobody was so unkind as to expose the thinness of the pretence, she was given. to understand in many and gratifying ways that her masterpiece was considered, in the Aylett circle, a suitable crown to the achievements that had preceded it. Mabel was popular and beloved, and her betrothed, in appearance and manner, in breeding and intelli- gence, justified Mrs. Sutton's pride in her -niece's choice.  The old lady colored up, with the quick, vivid rose- tint of sudden and real pleasure that rarely outlives early girlhood, when the first respondent to the break-' fast-bell proved to be her Frederic's god-son. "You are always punctual! I wish you would teach the good habit to some other people," she said, after answering his cordial "good-morning." "None of us deserve to be praised on that score, to- day," rejoined he, looking at his watch. "I did not awake until the dressing-bell rang. Our riding-party was out late last night. The extreme beauty of the    18       DEWLESS ROSES. evening beguiled us into going further than we in-  I tended, when we set out." "Yes you young folks are falling into shockingly irregular habits--take unprecedented liberties1 with me and with Time!" shaking her head. If 'Winston do not return soon, you will set my mild rule entirely at defiance." Chilton laughed -but was-serious the next instant. "I expected confidently to meet him at this visit," he said, glancing at the door to guard against being overheard. '"Should he not return to-day, ought I not, before leaving this to-morrow, to write to him, since he is legally his sister's guardian a It is, you and she tell me, a mere form, but one that should not be dfs- pensed with any longer."  iM "That may be so. Winston is rigorous in requiring what is due to his position - is, in some respects, a fear- ful formalist. But he will hardly oppose your wishes and Mabel's. I He has her real happiness at heart, I be- lieve, although he is, at times, an over-strict and exact- ing guardian - perhaps to counterbalance my indul- gent policy. He is unlike any other young man I know." "His sister is very much attached to him." "She loveshim - I was about to say, preposterously. Her implicit bellef in and obedience to him have in- creased his self-confidence into a dogmatic assertion of infallibility. But "- fearing she might create an un- ,..

Only " - relapsing hopelessly into the con- fidential strain in which most of the conference had been carried - " between ourselves, my dear Frederic, I am never quite easy with these patterns to the rest ,of human-kind. I should even prefer a tinyvein of depravity to such very rectangular virtue." "You are seldom ill at ease, if human perfection i all that renders you uncomfortable," responded Fred- eric. "There are not many in whose composition one  cannot trace, not a tiny, but a broad vein of Adamic nature. What a delicious morning!" he added,-' sauntering to the window. "And how sorry I am for those who did not get up in time to enjoy the freshness of its beauty!" cried a gay voice from the. portico, and Mabel entered by the glass door behind him-her hands loaded with roses, herself so beaming that her lover refrained with diffi- culty from kissing the saucy mouth then and there; He did take both her hands, under pretext of reliev- ing'her of the flowers, and Aunt Rachel judiciously turned her back upon them, and began a diligent search in the beaufet for a vase. "Do you expect us to believe that you have been more industrious than we? As if we did not know !that you bribed the gardener to have a bouquet -cut and    209       DEWLESS ROSES. laid ready for you at the back-door," Frederic charged upon the matutinal Flora. "Else, where are other evidences of your stroll, in dew-sprinkled: draperies and wet feet 3 Confess that you ran down stairs just two minutes ago! Now that I come to think of it, I am positive that I heard you, while Mrs. Sutton was lamenting your drowsy proclivities after sunrise." "I have been sitting in the summer-house for an hour - reading!" protested Mabel, wondrously re- signed to the detention, after a single, and not violent attempt at release. If you had opened your shutters you must have seen me. But I knew I was secure from observation on that side of the house, at least un- til eight o'clock, about which time the glories of the new day usually penetrate very tightly-closed lids. As to dew-there isn't a drop upon grass or blossom. And, by the same token, we shall have a storm within twenty-four hours ." "Is that true . That is a meteorological presage I never heard of until now." '"There is a moral in it, which I leave you to study out for yourself, phile I arrange the roses I and not the gardener - gathered."  \ In a whisper, she subjoined - Let me go! Some one is coming!" and in a'second more was at the side- board, hurrying the flowers into the antique china bowl, destined to grace the centre of the breakfast- table.   -D EWLESS ROBSES.       21 "Good-morning, Miss Rosa. You are just in sea- son to enjoy the' society of your sister," Frederic said, lightly, pointing to the billows of mingled white;and red, tossing under Mabel's fingers. The new-comer approached the sideboard, leaned languidly upon her elbow, and picked tp a half-blown bud at random from the pile. "They are scentless!" she complained. "Because dewless!" replied Mabel, with profound gravity. "It is the tearful heart that gives out the sweetest fragrance." "I have more faith in sunshine," interrupted Rosa, a tinge of contempt in her smile and accent. "Or- to drop metaphors, at which I always bungle - it is my belief that it is easy for-- happy people to be good. All this talk about the sweetness of crushed blossoms, throwing their fragrance from the wounded part, and the riven sandal-tree, and the blessed uses of adversity, is outrageous balderdash, according to my doctrine. A buried thing is but one degree better than a dead one. What it is the fashion of poets and sentimen- talists to call perfume, is the odorof incipient de- cay." "You are illustrating your position by means of my poor oriental pearl," remonstrated Mabel, playfully, arresting the hand that was beating the life and white- ness out of the, floweret upon the marble top of the beaufet. "Take this hardy gdant de batailles, in-  '   ,22        SEWLE SS ROSES. stead. My bouquet must have a cluster of pearls for a heart.'"  What a ierce crimson!"Frederic remarked upon the widely-opened rose Miss Tazewell' received in place of the delicate bud. "That must be the 'hue angry, yet brave,' which, Mr. George, Herbert asserts, 'bids the rash gazer wipe his eye-.?" "More poetical nonsense i" said Rosa, deliberately tearing the bold "gdant ,to pieces down to the bare stem, " unless he meant to be comic, and intimate that the gazer was so rash as to come too near the bush, and ran a thorn into the pupil." No one answered, except by the indulgent smile that usually greeted her sallies, however absurd, among those accustomed to the spoiled child's vagaries. Mabel was making some leisurely additions to her bouquet in the shape of ribbon grass and pendent ivy sprays, coaxing these with persuasive touches to trail over the edge and entwine the pedestal of the salver on which her bowl was elevated; her head set slightly on one side, her lips apart in a smile of enjoyment in her work and in herself. It was a picture the lover studied fondly -one that hung forever thereafter in his gallery of mental portraits. Beyond a -pair of fine gray eyes, the pliant grace of her figure and the buoy- -ant carriage of youth, health, and a glad heart, Mabel's pretensions to beauty were comparatively few, said the world. Frederic Chilton had, nevertheless, fallen in   Di9ElWzLBSS ROS/JE.     23 love with her at sight, and considered her, now, the handsomest woman of his acquaintance. Her dress was a simple lawn - a sheer white fabric, with bunches of purple grass bound up wit yellow wheat, scattered over it; her hair was lustroUs and abundant, and her face, besides being happy, was frank and in- telligent, with wonderful mobility of expression. In temperament and sentiment; in capacity for, and in "Ademonstration of affection, she suited Frederic to .the finest fibre of his mind and heart. He, for one, did not carp at Aunt Rachel's declaration that they were intended to spend time and eternity together. Still, Mabel Aylett was not a belle, and Rosa Taze- I well was. Callow collegians and enterprising young merchants from the city; sunbrowned owners of spread- ing acres and hosts of laborers; students- and practi- tioners of law and medicine, and an occasional theo- logue, had broken their hearts for perhaps a month at a time, for love of her, since she was a school-girl in short dresses. Yet there had been a date very far back in the acquaintanceship of each of these with the charmer, when he had marvelled at the infatuation which had blinded her previous adorers. She was "a neat little thing," with her round waist, her tiny hands and feet and roguish eye - but there was nothing else remarkable about her features, and in coloring, the pic- ture was too dark for his taste. Why, she mnight be mistaken for a creole And each critic held fastito i:;   24       DE WLESSE ROSES. his expressed opinion until the roguish eyes met his directly and iwith meaning, and he found himself div- ing into the bright, shimmering wells, and drowning -still ecstatically before he reached the bottom whence streamed the light of passionate feeling, strik- ing upward through the surface. What her glances did not effect was done by her dazzling smile and musi- cal voice. As one of her victims swore, "It was a dearet delight to be rejected by her than to be accepted by a dozen other girls-she did the thing up so hand- somely! And yet, do you know, sir, I could have- shot myself for a barbarous brute when I saw the pitying tears standing upon her lashes, and heard the tremor in her sweet tones, as she begged me to forgive her for not loving me"          Those she had once captivated never quite rid them- selves of the glamour of her arts; remained her trusty squires, ready to serve, or to defend her always after- ward. Aunt Rachel, intent, during the short pause, upon the movements of the servant who was setting the  ( smoking breakfast upon the table, glanced arouid . when all was properly arranged, to summon the t o to their places - but something in Rosa's attitude a d countenance held her momentarily speechless. Maiel still bent over her roses, in smiling interest, and Fred- eric Chilton was watching her-but not as the thi d N '^.

"She looked like a panther lying in wait for her prey!"Mrs. Sutton said to her niece, many months later, in attempting to describe the scene.. "Or like a bright-eyed snake coiled for a spring. The sight of her sent slivers all down my spine." Her interruption of the tableau sounded oddly abrupt to ears used to her pleasant accents. "Come, young people 1 how long aryou going to keep me waiting? Breakfast is cooling fast I " "I beg your pardon, Auntie! I did not notice that it had been brought in," apologized Mabel, drawing back, that Frederic might lift the loaded salver care- fully to its place upon the board. As they were closing about this, they were joined by Messrs. Barksdale and Branch, Miss Tabb delaying her appearance until the repast was nearly over, and meet- ing the raillery of the party upon her late rising with the sweet, soft smile her cousin-betrothed admired as the indication of unadulterated amiability. The breakfast-hour, always pleasant,; was to-day particu- larly merry. Rosa led off in the laughing debates, the play of repartee, friendly jest, and anecdote that incit- ed all to mirth and speech, and tempted them to lingel 2   X  r .    . O if6   DEBWLES ROSES. '1 around the table long after the business of the meal:- - was concluded. "This is the perfection of country life 1 " said Fred- eric Chilton, when, at last, there was a movement to end, the sitting. "But it spoils one fearfully for the everyday .practicalities of the city- a Northern city, especially." ".Better stay where you are, then, instead of desert- ing our ranks to-morrow]' suggested Rosa, gliding by his side -out upon the long portico at the end of the house. "Wh t does your nature crave that Ridgeley cannot supply . "Work, and a career!"  - '(You still feel the need of these?" significantly. "Otherwise I were no man 1" "You are right!" tHer disdainful eyes wandered to the farther end of the portico, where Alfred Branch, in his natty suit of white grasscloth, plucked at his ebon whiskers with untanned fingers, and talked society nothings with the ever-complaisant Imogene. a Come what may, you, Mr. Chilton, have occupation for thought and hands; are not tied down to a detest- able-- routine of vapid pleasures and-i common-place people!"

I wondered, moreover, when you were railing at the practicalities of city life, if you were learning, -like the  rest of the men, to accommodate your talk to your audience. Where is the use of your trying -to disguise the truth that all women are slaves? I used to envy you when I was in Philadelphia, last winter, when you pleaded business engagements as an excuse for declin- ' ing invitations to dinner-parties and balls. Now, if a woman defies popular decrees by refusing to exhibit herself for the popular entertainment, the horrible whisper is forthwith circulated that she has been ' dis- appointed,' and is hiding her green wound in her sewing-room  or oratory.

Having but one object in existence, there- can be but one species of dis- appointment. Marry she must, or be piti'ed!"with a  stinging emphasis on the last word. Tom Barksdale and Mabel were pacing the portico -from end to end, chatting with the cheerful familiarity of old friends. Catching some of this energetic'sen- tence, Mabel looked over her shoulder.  . "Who of us is fated to be pitied, did you say, Rosa  dear?"      :   -28      IDEWLELSS ROSE. I .            ,. "Never yourself I " was the curt reply. "Rest con- tent with that assurance." Her restless fingers began to gather the red leaves that already variegated the foliage of the creeper shad-  ing the porch. Strangely indisposed to answere he. animadversions upon the world's judgment of her sex, or to acknowledge the implied compliment to his be- trothed, Frederic watched the lithe, dark hands, as they overflowed with the vermilion trophies of autumn. The September sunshine sifted through the vines in patches upon the floor; the low-laughter and blended voices of the four talkers; the echo of Tom's manly tread, and Mabel's lighter footfall, were all jocund music, befitting the brightness of the day and world. What was the spell by which this pettish girl who stood by him, her luminous eyes fixed in sardonic melancholy upon the -promenaders, 'while she rubbed ithe dying leaves into atoms between her palms-ha stamped scenes and sounds with immortality, yet thrilled him with the indefinite sense of unreality and dread one feels in scanning the lineaments of the beloved dead? Had her nervous folly infected him? What absurd phantasy was hers, and what hid concern in her whims?       , A stifled cry from Mabel aroused him to active at- tention. A gentlemen had stepped from the house ,upon the piazza, and after bending to kiss her, was shaking hands with her companions..   -DSE"WLSS, 3S0E8       29 t The Grand Mogul" muttered Rosa, with a comic grimace, and not offering to stir in the direction of the stranger.    .  In another moment Vabel had led      to her lover, and introduced, in her pretty, ladylike way, and bravely enough, considering her blushes, " hMr. Ciilton " to "my brother, Mr. Winston Aylett." *         It , +  +   t r   ND so y  know nothing of this g ntlem  N EXOrANGE OF CONFIDEaOiia AND so you know nothing of this gentleman be- yond what he has told you of his character and antecedents?" Aunt Rachel had knocked at the door of her nephew's study after Inner, on the day of his return, and asked for an interview. "Altgh I knowi you must be very busy with your accounts, and so forth, having been away from the plantation for so long," she said, deprecatingly, yet ac- cepting the invitation to enter.  lr. Aylett's eye left hers as he replied that he was quite at liberty to listen to whatever she had to say, but --his manner was entirely his own - polished and cool. Family tradition had it that he was naturally a man of strong passions and violent temper, but since his college days, he had never, as far as living mortal could tetify, lifted the impassive mask he-wore, at the bid- diig of anger, surprise, or alarm.

In person, he was commanding in stature; his features were symmetrical; his bearing high-bred. His conversation; was sensible, but never brilliant or animateld. In his own household he was calmly despotic; in his county, respected and unpopu- lar -one of whom nobody dared speak ill, yet whom nobody had reason to love. There was a single per- son who believed herself to be an exception to this rule. This was his sister Mabel. Some said she wor-e shipped him in default of any other object upow ch. she could expend the wealth of her young,s-Adent heart; others, that his strong will enforced her homag - The fact of her devotion was undeniable, and upon -hia4 appreciation of this Aunt Rachel built her expectations of a favorable hearing when she volunteered to prepare the way for Mr. Chilton's formal applic for the hand of her nephew's ward. Between herself and Winston there existed little real liking and less affinity. She was useful to him, and his tolerance of her sodiety was courteous, but she auderstood perfectly that he secretly despised many of her views and actions, indeed, he did those of most women. Her present] mission was undertaken for the -love she bore Mabel and her sister. It was not kind to send the-girl to tell her own story. It was neither kind nor fair to subject their guest to the ordeal of an unheralded disclosure, ofehis sentiments and aspirations, with e puissant lord of Ridgeley as sole auditor. Ji   '32   AN EXCHANGE   OF CONFIDENCES. "Fred would never get over the first impression of your brother's chilling reserved" said the self-appointed envoy to Mabel, when she insisted that her affianced would plead his cause more eloquently than a third person could. "For, you, must confess, my love, that Winston, although -in most respects a model to other young men, is unapproachable by strangers." As she'said, "your accounts and so forth," she looked at the table from which Mr. Aylett had arisen to set a , chair for her. There was a pile of account-looks at , the side against the wall, but they were shut, and over- heaped by pamphlets and newspapers; while before the owner's seat lay an open portfolio, an unfinished letter within it. Winston wiped his pen with delibera- tion, closed) the portfolio, snapped to the spring-top of his iind, and finally wheeled his office chairs away from the desk to face his visitor. "Is it upon business that you wish to speak to me?" He always disdained circumlocution, prided himself upon tLe directness and simplicity of his address. This acted now as a dissuasive to the Sentimental address Mrs. - Sutton had meditated/as a means of winning the flinty walls behind which his social affections and sympathies were supposed to be intrenched. Had her mission been in behalf of any other cause, she would have drawn off her forces upon some pretext, and effected an ignominious retreat. Nerved by the thought of   AN -XaSANGE O'F CONFIDNCES.      83 ' :Mabel's bashfulness and. solicitude, and. Frederic's strangerhood, she stood to her guns. Winston heard her story, from the not very coherent preamble, to the warm and unqualified endorsement of Frederic Chilton's credentials, and her moved mention of the mutual attachment of the youthful pair, and never changed. his attitude, or manifested any inclina- tion to stay the narration' by question or comment When she ceased seaking, his physiognomy denoted no emotion whatever. Yet, Mabel was his nearest liv- ing relative. She had been bequeathed to his care, when only ten years old, by the will of their dying father, and grown up under his eye as his child, rather than a sister. And he was hearing, for the first time, of her desire to quit the hbme they had shared together from her birth, for the protection and co anionship of another. Mrs., Sutton thought herself pretty well versed in "Winston's ways," but she had expected to  detect a shade of softness in the cold, never-bright eyes, and anticipated another rejoinder than the sentence that stands at the head of this chapter.  - "And so you know nothing of this gentleman be- yond what he has told you of his character and afitece- dents?" he said--the slender white fingers, his auAnts fancied, looked cruel even in their idleness; lightly linked together, while his elbows rested upon the arms of his chair,                .  , "My dear Winstonl what a question!

He was ,a fine, manly little fellow, and the eldest son. The qchristening-feast was postponed, for some reason I do not now remember, until he was t(ro years old. It was aivery fine affair. The company was composed of the very elite of that part of Maryland, and the Bishop himself baptized the two ,babies--Frederic, and a younger sister.

"Doubtless, your intimacy with-this estimable and distinguished family continued up- to the time -of your husbands death"     ' "t did'." - And afterward?" Xrs.

W. in-- ston interposed, overlooking her agitation as irrelevant to the matter under investigation. "No I For many months I/wrote no letters at all, and Mr. Chilton was never a punctual correspondent. The best of friends are apt to be dilatory in such re- spects, as they advance in life."  "I gather, then, from what you have admitted"-- there was no actual stress upon the word, but it-stood obnoxiously apart from the remainder of the sentence, to Mrs. Sutton's auriculars--"from what you have admitted, that for twenty years you have lost sight of -this gentleman and his relatives, and that you might never have remembered the circumstance of their existence, had he not introduced himself to you at the Springs this summer." "You are mistaken, there!" corrected the widow, i eagerly. . "Rosa Tazewell introduced hIim to Mabel at the first' hop' she'-Mabel - attended there. He is very unassuming.

The recognition followed as a matter of ,course." "He was an acquaintance of Miss Tazewell -did 9you say?)" "Yes -se knew him very well when she was visit- ing ih Philadelphia last winter." "And proffered the introduction to Mabel?" the faintest imaginable glimmer of sarcastic amusement in his eyes, but none in his accent. "He requested it, I believe."  - 'That is more probable.

I am willing to ascribe this blunder, however, to ignor- ance of the code of polite society, and not to intentional disrespect, since you represent the gentleman as amia- ble and well-meaning. I am, furthermore, willing to examine his certificates of character and means, with a view to determining what are his recommendations to my sister's preference, over and above ball-room graces and the fact that he is Mr. Sutton's namesake, and whether it will be safe and advisable to grant my con- sent to their marriage.

"I trust it will be as yol say -but credulity is not my besetting sin, I am ready to see the gentleman at any hour you and he may see fit to appoint." "I will send Mr. Chilton to you at once, then." Mns. Sutton collected the scattering remnants of hope and resolution, that she might deal a parting shot. "Winston is an awful tria'o my temper, although he never loses his own," she was wont to soliloqmze, in the lack of a confidante to whom she could expatiate upon his eccentricities and general untowardliess. His marked avoidance of Frederic's name in this donference savored to her of insulting meaning. She Mad rather he had coupled it with opprobious epithets 'iwhenever he referred to him, than spoken of him as '? this" or 4     xq      , t. "(that gentleman." If he took this high ^ nd chilly tone with Mabel's wooer, there was no teiing what might be the result of the affair.   ! "Don't mind him if he is stiff and uncompromising- for a while," she enjoined upon Frederic, in;.apprising him of the seignior's readiness to grant himaiaudienc.

I-will bear the latter hint in mind," rejoined the - young man, with the gay, affectionate smile he often bestowed upon her. "I don't believe he can awe me into resignation of my purpose, or provoke me into dislike of the rest of the family." 7 Mabel was in her aunt's room, plying her with queries, hard to be evaded, touching the tenor and consequences of her recent negotiations, when a servant broght a message from her brother. She was wanted in tab study. The girl turned very white, as she pre- 'paredtto obey, without an idea of delay or of refusal. - O Auntie 1 what if he should order me to give Frederic up!" she ejaculated, pausing at the door, in an agony of trepidation. "I never' disobeyed him in , .my life." :-  I He will not do that, dear, never fear! He can find -no pretext for such summary proceedings. And should he oppose your wishes, be firm of purpose, and do not forsake your affianced husband," advised the old lady, solemnly. "There is a duty which takes precedence, in the sight;of Heaven and man, of that you owe your brother. Remember this, and take courage." Mabel's roses returned in profusion, when, upon entering the arbiter' dread presence, she saw Frederic COhilton, standing on the opposite side of the table from -that at which sat her brother at his ease, his white fin- gers still idly interlaced, his pale -patrician face emotionless as that of the bust of Apollo upon the top r" "- "   '-   ,AN -EXCHANGE O   OONF IDENOEa    D U of-the bookcase behind him. It was Frederic who led her to a chair, when she, stopped, trembling midway in the apartment, and his touch upon .her arm inspirited her to raise her regards to Winaton's countenance at the sound of his voice.         \ ("I have sent for you, -Mabel, that I may repeat in your hearing the reply I have returned'to Mr. Chilton's application for my sanction to your engagement- -I should say, perhaps, to your reciprocal; attachment.

In all their intercourse, Frederic had no more gra- -cious notice from Matel'es brother thali this semi- apology, delivered with stately condescension, and a courtly: bow in his direction. It sounded very grand to Mabel, whose fears of - opposition or severity from her Mentor, had- shaken -courage and nerves into pitiable distress.: -,Frederic ' could desire nothing more affable than Winston-s smile:; no more abundant encouragement than was aforded-by   * 40 -        Ev DSXCr as OF COYFiVDkENah7S his voluntary pledge. Had not the thought savored of disloyalty to her lover, shegould have confessed her- self disappointed that his reply did not effervesce with gratitude, that his deportment was, distant, his tone constrained. "I appreciate the last-named consideration, Mr. Aylett, I believe, thoroughly, as you do. I have al- ready told you that I invite, not shirk, the investigation you propose. I now repeat my offer of whateyer facil- ity is at my command for carrying this on. No hon- sorable man could do less. Unless I mistake, you wish now to see your sister alone." He bent his head slightly, and without other and especialsalutation to his betrothed, withdrew. Odd, white dints came and went in Winston's nos- trils the one aind unerring facial sign of displeasure he evelr exhibited, if we except a certain hardening of eye -and contour that chiselled his lineaments into a yet closer resemblance to marble. ' He is very sensitive and proud, I know," faltered Mabel, hasIfi marking these and understanding what they portended. "You need not like him the less on that account, always provided ihat the supports of his pride are legit- imate and s-ubst ntial," answered her brother, care- lessly transferriing to his tablets several names from a sheet of paper upon the table -the addresses of per- sons to whom Frederic had referred him for confirma-   AN EXCEANYGE OP aONZllENC   S.   41 tion of his statements regarding his social and profes- sional standing. "I hope, for your sake, Mabel," he pursued, pocket- ing the memoranda, " that this affair may be speedily and agreeably adjusted; while I cannot denythat I deprecate the unseemly haste with which Mrs. Sutton and her ally have urged it on, in my absence. Had they intended to court suspicion, they could not have  done it more effectually. You could not have had a more injudicious chaperone to the Springs." "Indeed, brother, she was not to blame," began the generous girl, forgetting her embarrassment in zealous I defence of the aunt she loved. "It was not she who presented me to Mr. Chilton, and she has never at- tempted to bias my decision in any manner." -  "I have heard the history in detail." Had his breeding,been less fine, he would have yawned in her face. "I know that you are indebted for Mr. Chilton's acquaintanceship to Miss Tazewell's generosity. But in strict justice, Mrs. Sutton should be held responsi- ble for whatever unhappiness may arise from the inti- macy. You were left by myself in her charge." "I do not believe it will end unhappily," Mabel'was moved to reply, with spirit that became her better than the shyness she had heretofore displayed, or the sub- ,issive demeanor usual with her in te'd-tates witht her guardian. He smiled in calm superiority.  As ;   -.42 'A   EXCHANGE 0F COONFIDENES. "I have expressed my hope to 'that effect.

The loss of Frederic; the destruction of her love-dream; the weary years of lonely wretchedness that would fol- low the bereavement, were to him only unimportant incidentals to her 'c affair ;" weighed in the scale 'of his impartial judgment no more than would nnconsidered dust. For -the first time in the life to -which he had been the guiding-star, she ventured to wonder if the unswerving rectitude that had elevated him above the level of other men, -in her esteem and affection, were so glorious a thing after all; if a tempering, not of; human frailty, but of charity for. the shortcomings, sympathy for the needs, of ordinary mortals, would not subdue the effulgence of his talents and virtues into mild lust tre, more tolerable to the optics of fallible beholders. Unsuspicious, with all his astuteness, of her saeri- legious doubts, Winston proceeded:   l "In the event of your marriage, you would desire, no doubt, that Mrs. Sutton should take up her abode with you? You would find her useful in many ways, and she would get on amicably with her, husband's- godson." -, "I do not think she expects to go with me,"? an- swered' Mabelj staggered by his coolly confident' air.

Mabel sat down again, totally confounded, and strug- -gling hard with her tears The thought of her broth- er's marriage was not in itself disagreeable. She had ofteni lamented his insensibility to the attractions of E suchwomen as she fancied would add to his happiness, :and grace the high place to which his wife would be exalted. : She never liked to hear him called invulner- able; repelled the hypothesis of his incurable bache- lorhood as derogatory to his heart and-head. .This un- looked-for intelligence, had it reached her in a differ- ent way, would have delighted as much as it astonished ber. The fear lest her consent to wed Frederic and leave Ridgeley might be the occasion of discomfort and sadness to her forsaken brother had shadowed all her visions of future bliss She ought to have hailed with unmixed satisfaction the certainty that he would not miss her sisterly ministrations, or feel the need of her companionship in that of one nearer and dearer than was his child-ward. She had-striven not to resent,   ,    .

For how could he know anything of the palpitations, the anxieties, the raptures of love, when he was a stranger to the touch of a kindrted emotion  He meant well; he had her welfare in view, unfortunate as was his style of discussing the means for insuring this--for he loved her dearly, dearly! She must never question this, although he had dealt the comfortable persuasion a cruel blow; wounded her in a vital part by withholding from her the circum- stance of his attachment and betrothal- until the near, approach of the wedding day rendered continued se- crecy inexpedient. No softening memory of his affi- anced' had inclined him to listen with kind!ly warmth to her timid avowals, or Frederic's manly protestations of their mutual attachment. He recognized no analogy in the two cases; stood aloof from them in the flush of his successful love, as if he had never known the pregnant meaning of the word. Smarting under the sense of injury to pride and affection, her language, when she could trust her voice, was a protest that, in Winston's judgment, ill beseemed her age and station. "Why did you not tell me of this earlier, brothers It was unjust and unlind to keep me in the dark until now."   "   AN E'uxcGE   OF CONFIDENCES. "You forget yourself, Mabel. I am not under obli- gation to account to you for my actions." He said it composedly, as if stating a truth wholly disconnected with feeling on his part or on hers. "I have given you the information to which you re- fer, in season for you to make ample preparation for / my wife's reception. And, mark me, she must see no sulkiness, no airs of strangeness or intolerance, because I have managed a matter that concerns me chiefly, as seemed to me best. Say the same to Mrs. Sutton, if you please; also that I will submit to no dictation, and ask no advice." Mabels anger seldom outlived its utterance. The hot sparkle in her eye was quenched by moisture, as she laid her hand caressingly upon her brother's. "Winston I you cannot suppose Ithat we could be wanting in cordiality to any one whom you love, much less to your wife. ' Let her come when she may, she will be heartily welcomed by us both. But this has fallen suddenly upon me, and I am a little out of sorts to-day, I believe -- excited and nervous - and, O, my darling! my oldest and best of friends! I hope your love will bring to you the happiness you deserve." -The tears had their course, at last, bathing the hand she bowed to kiss.

"You have not asked me her name, and where she lives. What has become of your curiosity? I never knew it to be quiescent before." "I thought-you would tell me whatever it was best for me to know," replied Mabel, drying her eyesi  If she had, said that she was too well-trained to assail him with interrogatories he had not invited, it would have been nearer the mark. "There is nothing relating to her which I desire to conceal," he rejoined, with some stiffness, For she would never have become my promised -wife., She is a Miss Dorrance, the daughter of a widow residing in the vicinity of Boston, Massachusetts. I met her first at Trenton Falls, where a happy accident brought me into association with her"party. I travelled with them to the Lakes and among the White Mountains, and, while in Boston, visited her daily. We were betrothed a week ago, and having, as I have observed, an aver- sion to protracted engagements, I prevailed upon her to appoint the tenth of next month as our marriage day. There you have the story in brief. I have not Mrs. Sutton's talents as a raconteur, nor her disposition   48   AN EXCHBANGEE  O COFNFI7EN to turn hearts inside out for the edification of her an- ditors."

Ridgeley will have a queenly mistress. The likeness is considered faithful, but it does not do her justice." He took it from  Mabel, and they scanned it to- gether; she resting against his shoulder. She felt his chest heave twice; heard him swallow' spasmodically in the suppression of some mighty emotion, and the palpable effort drew her very near to him. She never doubted from that moment, what she had more cause in after days to believe, that he loved the woman he had won with a fervor of passion that seemed foreign to his temperament as the evidence of it was to his conduct. .

The large, limpid eyes became shallow and cunning; the smile lurking about the mouth was the more treacherous and deadly for its sweetness; while the burnished coils of hair brushed away from the temples had the opaline tints and sinuous roll of a serpent. Mabel shrank back before the horror of the absurd imagination.                      I Winston raised the picture to his lips. "My peerless one!" i   CHAPTER  II.

"They vaunted themselves upon the antiquity of their line, and were more liberal in allusions to departed grandeur than was quite well- bred. When I knew them they were not wealthy, or in what they would have called 'society.' Indeed, the mother kept a private boarding-house near the law-  school I attended. There were several sons-very decent, enterprising fellows. But one lived at home, and a daughter, the wife of a lieutenant in the navy, whom I never saw. I boarded with them  for six months, or thereabout."   \ "You never saw the daughter! How was that "' "I must have expressed myself awkwardly if I con- veyed any such idea.

You need not look at me so intently love, as if you feared that some dark mystery lurked behind this matter-of-fact recital. If I do not tell you every event of my former life, it is not because it was vile. I could not sustain the light of your innocent eyes if I had ever been guilty of aught dishonorable or criminal. But even the follies and mistakes of a young man's early career are not fit themes for your ears. Ad I was no wiser, no more wary, than otlier youths of the same age; was apt to believe that fair which was only specious, and that I might play, uninjured, with edged tools. Nor had I seen you then, my treasure--my snow-drop of purity! Mabel! do you know how solemn a thing it is to be loved and trusted by a man, as I love and confide in you? It terrifies me when I think of, the absoluteness of my dependence upon your fidelity--of how rich I am in having you- how poor, wretched, and miserable I should be without you. I shall not draw a free breath until you are mine beyond the chance of recall." Nobody else wants me !" breathed Mabel in his ear, nestling within the arm that enfolded and held her tightly in the corner of the piazza shaded by the creeper. . "The danger of losing me is not imminent to-night, at all events," she resumed, presently, with a touch of the sportiveness that leit her manner an airy charm in lighter talk than that which had engrossed her for the past hour. 'O*  *.    *                    ,           .   The evening was warm and still to sultriness, and the moonlight, filtered into pensive pallor through a low-lying haze, yet sufficed to show how confidingly Imogene leaned upon her attendant in sauntering down the long main alley of the garden. Rosa was at the piano in the parlor, singing to the enamored Alfred. Mrs. Sutton had withdrawn to her own room to rumi- nate upon the astounding disclosure of her nephew's engagement, while Winston bent over his study-table, busy with the interrupted letter his aunt had seen in his portfolio. "There is no one here who has the leisure or the disposition to contest your rights, you perceive," said Mabel, running through a laughing summary of their companions' occupations. "Betrothals are epidemic in this household and neighborhood," Winston was writing. "There are no fewer than three pairs of turtles cooing down stairs as I pen this to you, my bird of paradise. The case that next to mine--to ours - commands my interest is that  of my sister. I came home to learn that the little Ma- bel I used to hold on my knee had entered into an engagement - conditional upon my sanction - with that traditional tricky personage, a Philadelphia lawyer-a Mr. Frederic Chilton, at the door of whose manifold perfections, as set forth by my loquacious aunt, you may lay the blame of this delayed epistle.

"What is that?" asked Frederic, halting before the windows, of the drawing-room, as a wild, sorrowful strain, like the wail of a breaking heart, arose upon the waveless air.  Rosa was a vocalist of note in her circle, and she had never rendered anything with more effect than she did the song to which   even the   preoccupied strollers among the garden borders stayed their steps to listen. Through the open casement Mabel and her lover could see'the face of the musician, slightly uplifted toward the moonlight; her eyes, dark and dreamy, as under the cloud of many-years of weary waiting and 'final hopelessness.  Her articulation -was always pure, but the passionate emphasis of every word constrained the breathless attention of her audience to the close of the simple lay: "Thy name. was once the magic spell By which my thoughts were bound; And burning dreams of light and love Were wakened by the sound. , My heart beat quick when stranger-tongue, With idle praise or blame, Awoke its deepest thrill of joy .

"Yet still thy name -thy blessed name I *My lonely bosom fills, Like an echo that hath lost itself Among the distant hills, That still, with melancholy note, Keeps faintly lingering on, When the joyous sound that woke it first Is gone--forever gone!" "A neat conceit that last verse, and the music is a fair imitation of a dying bugle-echo!" said Winston 'Aylett to himself, resuming the writing he had sus- pended for a minute. "That girl should take to the stage. If one did not know better, her eyes and sing- ing together would delude him into the idea that she had a heart. Honest Alfred evidently believes that she has, and that the patient labor of love will win it for himself. Bah!" Frederic and Mabel retired noiselessly from their post of observation, as "honest Alfred)" made a motion to take in his the hand lying: prone and passive upon the finger-board. They exchanged a smile, significant and tender, in withdrawing. "We understand the signs of the times," whispered Frederic, at the  upper turn of their promenade.

"You are really happy, then?"  queried Mabel. "Quite content " "Did I not tell you awhile ago that I was not satis- fied?" returned Chilton. "Two months since I should, \ in anticipation of this hour, have declared that it would be fraught with unalloyed rapture; I was happier yes- terday than'I am to-day. It is not merely .that wee must part to-morrow, or that your brother's precaution- ary measures and disapproval of what has passed be- tween us have acted like a shower-bath to the fervor of my newly born hopes.

We will call it a mild splenetic case, induced by the sultry weather, and the very slow on-coming of the storm  presaged by your dewless roses." He laughed naturally and pleasantly. Having con- fessed to what he regarded as a ridiculous succumbing of his buoyant spirit to atmospheric influences, he O ,  *.

"But the burden you describe has weighed me down since morning. While Rosa was singing, I felt suddenly removed from you by a horrid gulf. What if all this should be the prepara- tion to us for some impending danger "  "'Sweet! these are unwholesome vapors of the im- agination. Nothing can be a disaster that leaves us to one another," was the text of Frederic's fond soothing; and by the time Mrs. Sutton descended from her cham- ber of meditation, to remind Imogene that the seeds of ague and fever lurked in the river-fogs, the couple from the piazza came into the lighted parlor, all smiles and animation, wondering, jocosely, what had become of the recent occupants of the apartment.  Neither reappeared -until breakfast-time next, morn- ing. Rosa was like freshy-poured champagne, in sweet and sparkle.

Imogene had caught cold, walk- ing bareheaded in the evening air, and Tom condoled with her upon her influenza and sore-throat too sin- cprely to do justice to the rest of his friends and his breakfast. Mr. Aylett was never talkative, and his un- varying, soulless politeness to all produced the conserv- ing effect upon chill and low spirits that the atmosphere of a refrigerator does upon whatever is placed within it. Mis. Sutton's motherly heart was yearning pity- ingly over the lovers who were soon to be sundered, while Mabel's essay at cheerful equanimity imposed upon noblody's credulity. Frederic comported himself like a man - the more courageously because the host's cold eye was upon him, and he surmised that sighs and sentimentality would meet very scant indulgence in that quarter. Moreover, he was not so unreasonable as to descry insupportable hardships in this parting. By agreement with Mr. Aylett asd his sister, he was, if all went prosperously, to revisit!lidgeley at the end of six weeks, when his design was to entreat his betrothed to name the wedding day. The prospect might well sup- port him under the present trial.

"The carriage will be at the door in fifteen minutes, Mr. Chilton. The road is heavy this morning, and the stage passes the village at ten." "I shall be-ready," responded Frederic. I am sorry your carriage and coachman must be exposed to the rain."' That is nothing. They are used to it. Inever al- ter my plan of travel on account of the weather, how- ever severe the storm.

I wish you could be persuaded to stay with us until it clears off, Mr. Chilton, and"- making a bold push--"I am sure my nephew concurs in my desire."      '  "Mr. Chilton should require no verbal assurance of my hospitable feelings toward him and my other guests," said Mr. Aylett, frigidly-smooth as ice-cream. "If I forbear to press him to prolong his stay, it is in - recollection of the golden law laid down for the direc- tion of hosts -'Welcome the coming, speed the part- ing guest.'"  "You are both very kind, but I must go," Frederic replied, concisely and civilly, following Mabel into the parlor, whither the other visitors were fabled to have re-   60     UNWROLES0OME YAPOOS. paired. As he had guessed, his betrothed was the only person'there, the quartette having dispersed with kindly tact, for whichl he gave them due credit. "Don't think hardly of me, dear," he began, seating himself beside her on -the sofa. "Allow me to offer you a few of the finest cigars I have enjoyed for many years," said Mr. Aylett, enter- ing in season to check Frederic's movement to encircle Mabel's drooping form with his arm. "You smoke, I believe? You may have an opportunity of indulging in this solace in an empty stage. At least, there is lit- tle probability that you will be denied the luxury by the presence of lady passengers. I procured 'those in Havana, last winter. In case you should like them well enough to order some for yourself, I will give you the address of the merchant from whom I purchased them." He wrote a line upon a card, as he might sign a beg- gar's petition--with a supercilious parade of benevo- -lence--and passed it to the other, who accepted it with a phrase of acknowledgment neither hearty nor grateful. Then the master of the house paced the floor with a slow, regular step, his hands behind him; his countenance placidly ruminative, his thoughts ap- parently engaged with anything rather than the pair upon the corner-sofa, whose leave-taking he had mer- cilessly marred. Frederic dumb and furious; Mabel equally dumb and amazed to alarm, knowing as she   UN WHOLESOME VAPORS.        61 did that her brother's actions were never purposeless, sat still, their hands clasped stealthily amid the folds of Mabel's dress; their eyes saying the dear and passion- ate things forbidden to their tongues., Neither would , feign indifference, or attempt a lame dialogue upon other topics than those that filled their minds. Mr. Aylett was not one to pay outward heed to hints when he chose to ignore them. He, kept up his walk until the carriage was driven around to the front door, in- formed the parting guest that it awaited his commands, likewise that he would need all the time that remained to him if he hoped to catch the stage; without leaving the room, called to a servant to bring down Mr. Chil- ton's baggage, and did not lose sight of his sister's lover until the last farewell was said, and Frederic be- stowed inside the vehicle. There was nothing offen- sively officious or malicious in all this. Having declared as an incontrovertible dogma, that a ward could form no engagement without the formal sanction of her le- gal guardian, he saw fit to put the seal upon the decis- ion at this, their adieu, in a manner they were not likely to forget. An hour's harangue would not have imbued them with the sense of his authority, his determination to exercise it, and their impotency to resist it, as did this practical lesson. Mrs. Sutton could scarcely restrain her tearful re- monstrances against what was, to her perception, an   62 -     ZTN.

I wonder how he would like the same game to be played upon himself 1'? commented Alfred, aside, to his Dulcinea. Her lip curled in disdainful amusement. "As if he had ever done an inconsiderate thing since he put off long clothes! There is method in all this, if we were clever enough to fathom it." Within herself, she determined that she would solve the enigma before she was a week older. Frederic cast one hasty, eager look at the portico, as the carriage turned out of the yard. ]Mabel stood in the foreground, her figure framed by the climbing roses drooping over the front steps. She was very pale, and, forgetful for the moment of the observation of the bystanders, leaned slig]tly forward, her eyes strained upon the carriage-window--one hand laid upon her heart, the other resting against the pillar nearest her, as for support. She waved her handkerchief, in re- sponse to his smile and lifted hat, and simultaneously with this interchange of adieux her brother took her by the arm. "You are getting wet there, Mabel! Come into the house I It is well I have come back to look after you!"  I *  '  *.   CHAPTER IV. ( FOUinDED UPON A ROCK." SF Mrs. Sutton had raised horrified eyes and de- spairing hands upoLr learning the date of her nephew's proposed Carriage, it was because she miscalculated his executive abilities, and the en- ergy she had never until now seen fairly put forth. Within three days after his return, the homestead wasz alive with masons, carpenters, painters, and upholster- ers, engaged by the prompt bridegroom on his passage through Richmond; and so explicit were his orders as to the minutest detail of the work appointed to each, that he could safely leave the scene of action at the time appointed for the flying trip, northward, to which he had referred in his dialogue with Mabel on the afternoon of his arrival. The party of visitors had emigrated to other regions, a couple of days. after Frederic Chilton's departure, with the exception of Rosa Tazewell, who accepted Mabel's invitation to prolong her sojourn, the more willingly since she " flattered herself she. could be of /,nsw   "    "FO  z1DED UPON A OCK.," use in the general upheaving of the ancient founda- tions, and establishment of the new. If there was one thing she enjoyed above another, it was a tremen- dous bustle -a lively revolution." She made her boast of personal utility good by in- stalling herself forthwith as Mrs. Sutton's aid-de-camp, and rendering herself so far indispensable in the work of reconstruction that Mr. Aylett deigned to ask her not to desert her post in his-absence. "Yours is the genius of renovation, Miss Rosa," the potentate was pleased to say in his handsomest style. "Do not, I beg of you, forsake my aunt and sister in their need. Let me feel that I leave one head as the motive-power of the multitudinous hands." She agreed, in the same strain, to oblige him- a decision greeted with satisfaction by the pair in whose behalf he besought her friendly offices. The versatile invention and deft fingers of the little brunette were welcome to the heavily-taxed housekeeper, as were her gay good-humor and words of 'cheer and affection to the younger of her companions. The two girls became more confidential in six days than eighteen years of neighborly intercourse had sufficed to make them. Mabel's innate delicacy and excellent common sense would, in ordinary circumstances, have barred effusive-t ness upon the taempe nearest her heart, but love at nineteen is rarely discreet, even when the persuasives to communicativeness are less powerful than were   "FOUNDED UPON A   .ROCK-." A  65 the sorcery of Rosa's sympathy and the confessions that paved the way to answering and trustful com- municativeness on her friend's part. They were having what she called "a good, long, comforting, as well as comfortable chat" over their sewing in ]Mabel's chamber on the afternoon of the eighth day of Winston's absence. The weather was lovely, with the mellow brightness and balmy airs that make Virginian autumns a joy and glory until Novem- ber is half spent, and the atmosphere held, at sunset, the warmth and much of the radiance which had set the day:- a perfect gem - in the heart of the golden month. Into the eastern windows gazed the full moon, a crimson globe-upon the hazy horizon, while Yenus lay, large 'and tremulous, among the dying fires of the west.  "'Lovers love the western stfar,'" quoted Rosa, mer- rily, taking Mabel's work from her and throwing it upon the bed. "Come and enjoy the holy hour with me." They leaned together upon the window-sill, their young faces tinted by the changeful hues of the sky, both thoughtful- and mute, until Rosa broke the silence by a heavy sigh. "O Mabel, you should be a happy, happy girlf blessed among women. *IYou can love-- freely and joyously- and have pride-and faith in the one be- loved."   66    "P-OUNDEID VUPON A ROCK." "As you will some day," rejoined the other, draw- ing nearer to her, "when you, in your turn, shall know the iunspeakable sweetness of unquestioning faith- of utter- dependence upon him to whom you have given your heart." "Utter dependence!" echoed Rosa. "That would mean utter wreck of heart, hope - everything - should the anchor give way. It is a hazardous experiment, ibeobl ie /'          . The Other looked down at her with simple fearless- ness. "'For it was founded upon a rock "I she repeated softly; yet the exultanl ring of her accent vibrated upon the ear like a joyous challenge. Rosa's-fretful movement was involuntary. "Mine would drag in the sand at every turn of the tide, every rise of the wind, if I were to follow your advice, and say ' yes' to the pertinacious Alfred," she said reproachfully. "Don't say advice, dear!' corrected the other. I only endeavored to convince you that there must be la- tent tenderness beneath your sufferance of Mr. Branch's devotion; that /if you really were averse to the thought of marrying him, you could not take pleasure in- his society, or enjoy the marks of his attachment wh ich are apparent to you and to everybody else." "Can't you understand," said the beauty, petulantly, "that it is one thing to flirt with a man in public, and   "FOU2JDIED UPON A ROCK"B     67 another to cherish his image in private? There is no better touchstone of affection than the holiness and calm of an hour like this. If Frederic were with you, the scene would be the fairer, the season more sacred for its association with thoughts of lnms and his love. Whereas, my Alfred's adoring platitudes would disgust me with the sunset, -with the world, and with myself, for permitting him to haunt my presence and hang upon my sile-- foppish barnacle that he is! If you knew how I despise myself sometimes!" "Dear Rosa! I shall never try again to persuade i that you care for him as a woman should for the man GOD intended her to marry. But why not act worthily- of yourself--justly to him, and reject him decid:-  edly?"     - l"Because "-- her face shrewd and wilful as it had I been sorrowful just now--"I am by no means certain that I can do better than to marry him.

We shall not expect to pass our days in-gazing at sunsets and walking in the moonlight, you know. It is not every woman who can marry the man she loves best. While the right to select and to woo is usurped by the masculine portion of the community, it must, perforce, be Hobson's choice with an uncounta- ble majority of feminines. I should not complain.   68     "PFOUNDED UPON A ROCK." The stall allotted to me by Hobson --alias Fate - might hold?a worse-conditioned animal than my wor- shipping swain."

As to ,your figure of the stabled steed-this disapproving customer has the. consolation that she need not accept him, unless she wishes to do so. She has the invaluable privilege of saying' no' as often and obstinately as she:pleases." "I deny it," said Rosa, -perversely. "Parents, in this age, do not make a custom of locking up refractory daughters in nunneries or garrets until they consent to wed Baron Buncombe or my Lord Nozoo, but there are, nevertheless, compulsory marriages in plenty. Society wrarns me to make a creditable match, upon penalty, if I decline, of being pointed out to the suc- ceeding-and a fast-succeeding generation it is! as a disappointed old maid--a passee belle, who squan- dered her capital of fascinations, and has become a pauper upon public toleration, while my mother, sisters, and brothers are growing impatient at my many and profitless flirtations, and anxious to see me 'settled.' My mother's pet text, since I was sixteen, has been her prayerful desire that I, the last of her nestlings, should make choice of a tenable bough and helpful partner, and set up a separate establishment before she dies.

And Winston would show himself an adept in such arts, if occasion offered." "Rosa Tazewell! you are speaking of my brother, my friend and benefactor one of the best, noblest, most disinterested creatures Heaven ever made!" cried Mabel, erect and indignant. "You have no warrant - I shall never give you the right - to asperse him in my presence. He is incapable of cruelty or unfair- ness. It is my duty to obey him, but it is no less a pleasure, for he is a hundred-fold wiser and better than I am- knows far more truly what is for my real ad- vantage. As to his conduct in this affair of Frederic and myself, you cannot deny that it has been generous   70     ' FOuNDE)  UPON A ROoCK" and consistent throughout. He has been cautious- never harsh!" "So!" said Rosa, scrutinizing the flushed counte- nance of the other, her own full of intense meaning, "you have had your misgivings!" Mabel reddened more warmly. C   Misgivings! What do you mean?i"  "That the uncalled-for vehemence of your defence is a proof of disturbed confidence, of wanting belief in the infallibility of youre semi-deity. The trailing robes of divinity have been blown aside by a chance breath of suspicion, and you had a glimpse of the clay feet. I am glad of it. Scepticism is the parent of rebellion, and the time is coming when fealty to your betrothed may demand disloyalty to the power that now is." Mabel's smile was meant to be careless, but it was only uneasy, and gave the lie direct to her assevera- tion. "I have no apprehensions of such a conflict.

The annoyance passed from her brow, like the sheerest mist, as she read the superscriptions-- one in her brother's hand- writing, the other in Frederic's. Rosa interfered to prevent the breaking of the seals.  "I am going to leave you to the undisturbed enjoy- ment. of your feast," she said, in her most winsome manner. "But - won't it taste the sweeter ti your antepast is the delight of forgiveness?

I proposed to tear down the pan- elling, but she was horrified at the thought. I could not take more pride and interest in preserving the antique character of the home of my forefathers than does she. She will -have it that the hall, thus improved, aid hung with a few old pictures, some bits of ancient   "FOUNDED UPON A ROOK."      75 armor, and Carpeted with maroon and green, will be truly baronial.

You cannot fail to derive i'finite benefit from intercourse with her. "This brings me to (another subject to which I desire to call your immediate attention. I wish her to:sefect a couple of dresses suitable for your wear on the night of our reception-party, and at others which will, un- doubtedly, be given in our honor. She objects to do- ing this unless I obtain from you 4 written request that she should thus aid me. She fears you may con- sider her action 'premature and officious.' Write to her at once, requesting her to do this sisterly favor for you, setting forth your distance from the city, the mea- gre assortment of the goods to be had in the Richmond stores, etc., and giving her carte blAnche as to cost and style.

I earnestly desire that yol should look your best at your introduction to her." "' Maroon and green ' a ' baronial' -hall, and new party-dresses for insignificant me!"Mabel stopped to say aloud in great amusement. -"What would my sage brother have saod to such paltry memoranda six months   76-    "i POUNDED UPON A ROCK." ago? He is an apt scholar, or he has an able teacher. Ah, welll love is a marvellous transmogrifier!" With this apothegm from the storehouse of her late- ly acquired wisdom, she passed to the next paragraph. "Now for another matter about which I meant to write to you yesterday, but I was prevented by our ex- pedition to Lowell. .The evenings I of course devote to Clara. I have not been so engrossed by my own very important concerns as to neglect yours. I stopped a day in- Philadelphia, illy as I could afford the time, to make such investigations as I could, without ex- citing invidious suspicion, into the character of the per- son' whom I found domesticated at Ridgeley on my re- turn from my summer tour. The information I picked up in that cautious city was so meagre and tantalizing as to provoke me into the belief that he had selected his references with an eye to the slenderness of their knowledge of his personal history. Accident, however, has since placed within my reach a means of learning all that I wish to know. Without wearying you- with explanations, which, indeed, I have no time to write - being engaged to drive out with Clara in an hour from this time,--I will transcribe a portion of a letter re- ceived by me, two days since, from a gentleman of un- exceptional standing, and upon whose word you may safely depend. "'He says: 'In reply to your queries as to my ac- q   "FOUNDED   UPON A ROCKT."    t quaintanceship with one Frederic  Chilton, now a practising lawyer in the city of Phiadelphia, I would, "  if conscience permitted, repay your frankness by eva- sion of a disagreeable truth.

He was then -what I have but too much reason for believing him at this day-a plausible, unprincipled man of pleasure. Our inter- course, which commenced at the card-table, terminated with a severe horsewhipping I administered to him in punishment of an offence offered a married lady--a relative of my own. Taking advantage of the pro- tracted absence of her husband, who was a naval officer, he offered her many attentions, received by herself' as tokens of innocent and friendly regard, until he forgot himself so far as to make her open and insulting pro- posals, even urging her to consent to an elopement, and threatening, in the event of her refusal, to ruin her by infamous calumnies. Her father was infirm; her hus- band in a foreign land. His base persecution woild have met with no chastisement, had not I espoused the terrified woman's cause. These are the bare facts of the case.

"I shall write to Mrs. Sutton'sprotdg by the mail that carries this, ihforming him of my oppor- tune discovery, through no instrumentality of his pro- viding, of the poverty of his claims to the title of gen- tleman, and the audacity of his pretensions to my sister's hand.

A   "FOUNDED   UPON A ROCK."    79 The clamply, nerveless hands dropped - the fatal sheet below them--into MabeJ4 lap. She did not cry out or moan. TiSngs stricken to the heart gener- ally fall dumbly. It was not her cramped position within the window-seat that paralyzed her limbs,nor the chill of the twilight that crept through vein and bone. For one sick second she believed herself to be dying, and would not have stirred a muscle or spoken a syllable to save the life which had suddenly grown so worthless - worthless, since she was never to see Frederic again; be no more to him than if she had never laid her head upon his bosom; never felt his kisses upon lip and forehead; never lived upon his words of love as rapt mortals, admitted in trances to the banquet of the gods, eat ambrosia, and drink to di- vinest ecstacy of nectar --the elixir of immortal life and joy, sparkling in golden chalices. She had had her dream-ravishing and brief-- but the awakening was terrible as the struggle back to life from a swoon or deathful lethargy. As to think- ing, I believe nobody thinks at such seasons. Nature shrinks in speechless horror at sight of the descending weight, and when it has fallen, lies motionless, gasping in breath to enable her to support the intolerable an- guish, not speculating how to avert the next stroke. Frederic and she were parted!

Yet it could not have been half an hour--thirty fleeting minutes-since the two had talked as dear friends out of the fulness of their hearts. Where were the hopes and happy memories that had made hers then a garden of pleasant things, a fruitful field which Heaven had blessed? In that little inch of time, the flood had come and taken them all away. Would the dry aching in her thro t and chest ever i be less? Tears had gushed freely and healthfully after her last leave-takiig with Frederic - the looked farewell, which was all Winston's surveillance had granted them. She had been wounded then by her brothers singular want of tact or, feeling. *She had not the spirit to resent anything to-night, unless it were that God had made and suffered to live a being so wretched and useless as herself. She supposed it was wicked -but she did not care! She ought to be re- .signed to the mysterious dispensations of Providence -that was the prescribed phraseology of pious people. She had heard the cant times without number. What   "FOUNDED UPON A ROCK."       81 more would they have than her utter destitution of love and bliss? Was she not miserable enough to satisfy the sternest believer in purgatorial purification? to ap- pease the wrath even of Him who had wrought her desolation? It must be-the judgment of a retributive Deity upon her idolatrous affection that she was bear- ing-her worship of Frederic. Yes, she had loved him; she loved him now better than she did anything else upon earth-better thah she did anything in Heaven. In the Jartial insanity of her woe and despair, she lifted her gray face and vacant eyes to the, vast, empty vault, beyond which dwelt her Maker afar off, and said the words aloud--spat them at Him through hard, ashy lips. "I love himi I love him I You have taken him from me - but I will love him for all that! ' Heaven -or Fate - her blasphemous mood did not distinguish the one from the other- was a robber. Her brother was pitiless as the death that would not answer to her call. Between them she was bereaved. It was but a touch - the lightest breath of natural feeling that broke up the hot crust, that shut down the fountain of tears--Rosa's voice, tuneful and sad as a nightingale's, chanting the border-lays she loved so well: ' When I gae out at e'en, ' '    , Or walk at morning air, Ilk rustling bush will seem th say , I used to meet thee there.   82 ','   $FOUNDED UPON A ROCeK.

As he would never do again I "My-darling I my darling I " she cried aloud. The, the grief-dro6came in a flood.   CRAPTER V.

"Rosa, love, excuse me for three sec- onds, please. I must see what is the matter. I do hope there is no bad news from--  " (arrested by the recollection that there were servants in the room, she substituted for the name upon her lips)-" in her letters." "I don't think she's much sick ma'am," said the maid.  "She is a-settin' in the window." "Where I   left her with-her letters, an hour and more ago," observed Rosa. "Don't hurry back if she needs you, Aunt Rachel. I will makee myself at- home; shall not mind eating alone for once." Notwithstanding the array of dainties before her, she only ,ibbled the edge of a cream biscuit with her little white teeth, and crumbled the rest of it upon her   84        CriJsAn  ANDS. plate in listlessness or profound and active reverie, while th'hostess was away. She, too, had her conjec- tures and her anxieties- a knotty problem to work outland the longer she pondered the more confident was she that she had grasped at least one filament of the clue leading to elucidation. Mabel had not stirred from her place--sat yet with her brother's letter in her lap, her hands lying heavily upon it, although her muslin dress was ghostly in the stream of moonlight flowing across the cham- ber. She had wept her eyes dry, and her voice was monotonous, but unfaltering. i "I am not really sick, aunt, but I have no appetite, and haVing a great deal to t hink of, I preferred stay- ing here to going to the table," was her answer to Mrs. Sutton's' inquiries. "Your hands are cold and lifeless as clay, my child. What is the matter? It is not like you to be moping up here, alone in the dark." "Won't you leave me to myself for a while, and keep Rosa down-stairs a " asked Mabel, more patiently than peevishy. "Before bed-time I will-see you in your room, and we can talk of what has disturbed mne.

This was strange talk from the frank-hearted child , she had reared from bab hood, and while she desisted from further attempts at consolation, Aunt Rachel took a very sober visage back to 'the supper-room with her, and as little appetite as Rosa had manifested. The meal was quickly over, and by way of obeying the second part of Mabel's behest, the innocent diplo- matist begged Rosa to go tothe piano. "I always enjoy your delightful music, my dear. It makes the house more liv'i "Thank you, dear Mrs. Sutton. I should take pleasure in obliging you; but 8 Mabel is out of sorts, Idon't believe she will care ,to have the house lively to-night," was the amiable rejoinder. "Moreover, I am dying to finish 'David Copperfield.' Will you al- low me to curl myself up in the big chair here, and read for an hour?"     ! Mrs. Sutton gave a consent that was almost glad in its alacrity, and pretended to occupy herself with the newspapers brought by the evening mail, until she judged that Mabel had had season in which to com- pose her thoughts. Then she muttered something about "breakfast," "muffins," and "Daphnei" caught up her key-basket, and bustled out. Rosa's book fell from before her face at the sound   86        CLEAN BANDS.     s of the closing door. The liquid eyes were turbid; her features moved by some passion mightier far than curiosity or compassion for her friend's distress. '"I have done nothing -literally nothing, to bring this- on!" was the reflection which brought most calm to her agitated mind. "If it should be as I think, I am guiltless of treachery. My skirts are clear. My hands are clean! Yet there have been moments when I could have dipped them  in blood that this end might be attained!" Too restless to remain quiet, she tossed her book aside and wandered from side to side of the room, halting frequently to hearken for Mrs., Sutton's return, or some' noise from the conference chamber that might alleviate her suspense. "I tried to put her on her guard," she broke forth at length, bent, it would seem, upon self-justification against an invisible accuser. "I saw aversion in Win- ston's eye the day he came home to find the other here. He would never forgive his slave the presump- tion of choosing a husband for herself. Did I not tell her so? Yet this has caught her like a rabbit in a trap--unprepared for endurance or resistance. The spiritless baby! Would I giye him up, except with life, if he loved me as he does her?"  It was not a baby's face that was confronting Mrs. Sutton's just then. It was no weak, spiritless slave who sustained the pelting shower of her comments, her   CLEAN HANDS.        87 wonderment and her entreaties that Mabel would re- fuse to abide by her brother's decision -her guardian though he was --and if she would not write to Fred- eric with her own hand, empower her aunt to apply to him for an explanation of the disgraceful mystery. "We should condemn no man unheard," she argued. "It is but fair to give him an opportunity of telling his side of the story." "Winston's letter will inform him of what and by whom he is accused," said Mabel. "He will have the opportunity you speak of. I should not be content with my brother's action, were this not so. I have been over the whole ground again and again, since sunset. We--you and H are powerless. This story is either true or false. If what we have read really happened, what could arise from our correspondence with, the offender against honor and virtue a It would but complicate difficulties. If he is unjustly accused, he can prove it, and put his- slanderers to shame with- out our promptings. Our interference would be an in- timation that he needed our championship." "I believe he will clear hinself of every stain," re- turned Mrs. Sutton earnestly. "This is either a vile plot concocted bysome secret foe, or the Frederic Chil- ton mentioned here," pushing the letter away from her on the table, with a gesture of loathing, "is anothen person." "That is very unlikely!"I   88       CLEAN HANDS. Mabel leaned her forehead wearily upon her hand, and did not finish the sentence immediately. "I will be candid with you, aunt, upon this subject, as I have tried to be-in every other confidence with which I have burdened you. Frederic Chilton was a student in the law-school, which was also attended by Winston's correspondent, and at the date specified by him. I have reason to think there was something un- pleasant -something he wished to conceal from me, and perhaps from everybody else, connected with his stay there. He referred to it ambiguously on the last evening of his visit here, as a folly, a youthful indiscretion. I have the impression, moreover, that a married woman was mixed up in this trouble, what- ever it was - a lady, some years older than himself, whose husband, a naval officer, was absent upon a long cruise. This may be the germ of the story related, here, and it may have nothing whatever to do with it." In saying "here," she pointed to the letter. Both avoided touching it as it lay between them, the big seal uppermost, and looking more like bright, fresh bloo( than ever, in the lamplight. "1 [y-dear, all this proves nothing - absolutely nothing--except that the shock and over-much soli- tary musing have made you morbid and unreasonable." Mrs. Statton assumed a, collected 'air, and delivered herself with the mien of one who was determined to submit to no trifling, and to credit no scrap of evi-   CLEAN HANDS.         89 dence against her friend which .counter-reasoning could set aside. ,:"My husband's godson-we must remember he is that, Mabel!--could never be guilty of the infamous conduct ascribed to this Chilton by Winston Aylett's anonymous friend.  I am  accounted a tolerable judge of character, and I maintain that it is a moral impossibility for my instincts and experience to be so utterly at fault as these two men would make you be- lieve. As to the .corroboration of your 'impression,' that would be consummate nonsense in the eye of the law. Let us sift the pros and cons of this affair as ra- tional, unprejudiced beings should--not jump at con- clusions. And I must say, Mabel"--was the consis- tent peroration of this address, uttered in a mildly- aggrieved tone, while the blue eyes began to shine through a rising fog-" it seems to me very singu- lar- really wounds me - it not what I looked for in you--that you should rank yourself with my poor boys enemies!" ( I, his enemy!"The word was a sharp cry - not loud, but telling of unfathomed deeps of anguish, from the verge of which the listener drew back with a shud- der. "I would have married him without a single glance at the past! Let him but say 'it- is untrue- all that you fear and they declare,' and I would disbe- lieve this tale, instantly and utterly, though a thousand witnesses swore to the truth of it. Or, let him be all   90        CLEANs EA S8.      ' that they say, I would marry him to-night, if I had the right to do it. But I promised- and to' promise with an Aylett is to fulfil--that I would be ruled by my guardian's will, should the investigation, to which Frederic himself did not object, terminate unfavorably ' for my hopes, and contrary to his declaration." "It was a rash promise, and such are better broken than kept." "Your Bible, Aunt Rachel - to-night, I cannot call it mine!--commends him .who swears to his own heart and changes not," replied the niece, with restored steadiness. "It would have been the same had I re- fused my consent to Winston's proposal. I am a mi- nor, and who would wait two years for me?" "Anybody who loved you, provided your trust in him equalled his in you," said Mrs. Sutton, slyly. Mabel's answer was direct. "You want me to say that I do not believe this tale of Mr. Chilton's early errors; to brand it as a mistake or fabrication. You insinuate that, in reserving my sentence until I shall have heard both sides of it, IX show myself unworthy of the love of a true man; be- tray of what mean stuff my affection is made. I sup- pose blind faith is sublime! But for my part, I had rather be loved in spite of my known faults, than re- ceive wilfully ignorant worship." The daring stroke at Mrs. Su-ton's hypothesis of the   CLEA N HAETDS        91 inseparable union between esteem and affection, excited her into an impolitic admission. "iMy child,-you make my blood run cold! You do not mean that you could love a man for whose charac- ter you had no respect!" "There is a difference between learning to love and continuing to love," said Mabel, sententiously. "But we have had enough of useless talk, aunt. In two days more Winston will be here. Until then, let mat- ters remain as they are. You can tell Rosa as much or as little as you like of what has happened. She must suspect that something has gone awry. To-mor- row, I will look up this Mr. Jenkyns, and deliver the messages with which I am charged - likewise consult the mason about the 'baronial' fireplace," smiling bit- terly. "You never saw another creature so altered as she is," Mrs. Sutton bewailed to Rosa, in rehearsing the scene. "If this thing should turn out to be true, she is ruined and heart-broken for life. She will become a cold, cynical, unfeeling woman-a feminine copy of her granite brother."1 "If!" reiterated Rosa, testily. "There is not one syllable of truth in it from Alpha to Omega! - I know he is your nephew, and that it is one of the Medo-Per- sian laws of Ridgeley that the king can do no wrong; but I would sooner believe that Winston Aylett in- vented the slander throughout, .than question Fred               .      92        Crm,7 Vt HANDS. Chilton's integrity. There is foul play somewhere, as you will discover in time - or out of it 1 " To Mabel, Frederic's spirited champion said never a word of the event that held their eyes waking until dawn- each motionless as sleepless lest her bed-fel- low should discove her real state. "I have had no sLare in causing the rupture. I am not called upon to ieal it," meditated she. "In this, the law of self-preservation is my surest guide." Her resolve to remain neutral was sharply and un- expectedly tested the next afternoon. The two girls went out for a ramble about four o'clock, taking the beaten foot-path that led through cultivated fields, and between wooded hills, to a small post-town two miles distant. The day was sunless, but not chilly, add when they had outwalked the hearing of the murnur of rural life that pervaded the barn- yard and adjacent " quarters," the silence was oppres- sive, except when broken by the whirr of a partridge, f the melancholy caw of the crows, scared from their feast upon the scattered grains knocked from over-ripe ears of corn during the recent " fodder-pulling," and, as they neared it, by the fretting of a rapid brook over its stony bottom. The pretence of social converse had been given up before the friends cleared the first field beyond the or- chard. Rosa's exquisite tact withheld her from ob- truding commonplaces upon the attention of a mind   Cr,L H4ANDS.         93 torn by suspense - distracted between disappointment and outraged pride, and Mabel had not besought her sympathy in her grievous strait. They walked on swiftly, the one staring straight forward, yet seeing nothing; the other, although thoughtful, losing not one feature of the landscape -the light-gray sky, the encircling forest, the yellow broom-straw clothing the hill-sides, the crooked fences, lined with purple brush, golden-rod, black-bearded alder and sumach, flaming with Scarlet berry cones and motley leaves. It was her principle and habit to seize upon whatever morsels of delight were dropped in her way, and she had a taste for attractive bits of scenery, as for melody. There was no' reason why the evil estate of her corn-  panion should debar her from quiet enjoyment of the  autumn day. She was sorry that Mabel was suffering. It was unpleasant to see pain or grief. Smiles were prettier than glum looks. She hoped she had enough humanity about her to enable her to recognize these facts. But, in her soul, she despised the girl for her tacit acquiescence in her brother's decree; contemned her yet more for her partial credence of the rumor of her lover's unworthiness. It was as well, taking these things into account, that Mabel was not communica- tive with regard to the great change that had befallen her since this hour yesterday, when she had exult- ingly proclaimed- that her trust was "founded upon a rock."   94       CLrAN BHANDS. "Var,mm et mutabile semper fcemina!" reflected Rosa, who knew that much Latin-and, attracted by the waving of the bright grasses beneath the waves of the rivulet they were crossing, she stopped to lean over the railing and poke them aside from the stones with a chincapin switch she had picked up a little way backl ]ghel did not look around; apparently did not ob- serve that she walked on alone. "I dare say she would not miss me for the next mile'!" soliloquized the idle lounger, snatching foam- flakes from their nestling-places behind the rocks, and watching them as they danced down the stream. Something, whiter and more regular in shape than they, lay upon the margin of the brook, partly con- cealed by a clump of sedge.  A   letter, with the address uppermostl Rosa's optics were keen. She easily made out the direction upon the envelope from where she stood. It was Frederic Chilton's name in Mrs. Sutton's quaint, old-fashioned ' back-hand" chir- Pgraphy. An hour before, as Rosa now recollected, she had seen, from her window, a negro man take the path to the village! arranging some papers in the crown of his tattered straw hat. He had dropped this, the most important of ,all, probably in, stooping to drink from his hollowed palms at the spring-stream. However this might be, there it lay-the warning to the calumniated lover that his traducers were-making         *      . .U   Or, AAT B AND9.        95 clean (or fouD work with his fair fame in the quar- ter where he wished to stand at his best; perhaps cit- ing him to appear and answer the damaging charges in person before the same tribunal.       ' "If she would only let me drop him a friendly line, askings him, for her sake, to contradict this horrid slander!" the distraught matron had sighed, last night, in her recapitulation of the conversation with her -ob- durate niece. "But she will not hear of it." "I hardly think he would like it either," Rosa had rejoined. "It would hint at distrust on your part or on hers. Mr. Aylett's letter should be sufficient to 'elicifthe defence you crave." "You are in the right, perhaps!" But Mrs. Sutton had looked, miserably discontented. "Yet to be frank with you, Rosa, Winston is not apt to be conciliatory in his measures when he takes it into his head that the family honor is assailed. I am afraid he has written haughtily, if not insolently, to poor Frederic.." Rosa had no doubt of this, even while he answered, "Neither haughtiness nor downright insolence would prevent a man who has so much at stake as has Mr.  Chilton, from taking instant steps to re-establish him- self in the respect of the family he desires to enter. This is a very delicate matter- take what view of it we may. tHadn't you better wait a few days before you interfere? Nothing can be lost-something may be gained by prudent delay." gai      delaysI   96        CLEANz HANDS.  "And I suppose Winston would be very much dis- pleased, at my officiousness, as he would term it," had been Mrs. Sutton's reluctant concession to her young guest's-discreet counsel. "But it is very hard to re- main quiet, and see everything going to destruction about one I "-! She had evidently reconsidered her resolution to let things take their wrong-headed course, and in virtue of her prerogatives as match-maker and mender, had thrust her oar into the very muddy whirlpool boiling about the bark of her darling's happiness. Rosa wrought out this chain of sequences, with many other linkS, stretching far past present exigen- cies and possibilities, ere Mabel's figure disappeared behind the shoulder of tte hill rising beyond the brook. Should Frederic Chilton receive that letter, in less than a week--in three days, perhaps, for he was a man prompt to resolve'and to do--he would present himself at Ridgeley to, speak in his own be- half -an event Rosa considered eminently undesira- ble. Certainly Mabel's pusillanimity merited no such reward. She had no right to question therectitude of one she professed to love, nor her aunt the right to act as mediator. If Mabel Aylett, with her sound sense and judgment, and her inherent strength of will, would not hold fast to her faith in her affianced hus- band, and defy her brother to sunder them, let her lose that which she prized so lightly.   CLEAN HANDS.         .9  If the epistle, soaking slowly there in the wet, -had been committed to Rosa's charge, she would have scorned to intercept it; would have deposited it safely and punctually in the post-office. As it was, if she left it alone, Frederic would never get it, and Mrs. Sutton remain unconscious of its fate-unless some other passer-by should perceive and rescue it from il- legibility and dissolution unless Mabel should espy it on their return-walk, or; coming back, the next mo- ment, to seek her truant mate, catch sight of the snowy leaflet of peace in its snuggery under the sedge. ,Astartled partridge flew over Rosa's head from the thither rising ground, and in the belief that he was the harbinger of the approach she dreaded, she dislodged the envelope from its clovert, with a quick touch of her little wand, and it floated down the stream. Slowly - all too gradually at first - swinging lazily : around in the eddies, catching, now against a jutting stone, now entangled .by a blade of grass--Rosa's heart in her throat as she watched it, lest Mabel's foot- steps should be audible upon the rocky path, Mabel's  hat appear above the spur of the hill. Then the chan-  : nel caught it, whirled it over and over, faster and faster, and sucked it downward. Mrs. Sutton was at the tea-table with the girls that evening, when Johnson, the sable Mercury, showed himself at the door, to inform his superior that he had "got everything at de sto' she sent him fur to buy." 6o  , '*.    - 98       aCLEAN lANDS.

CRILTON.? The cool contempt of the reply to his imperative dis- missal of whatever claims the presumptuous adventurer his aunt had encouraged believed he had upon Ma- bel's notice or affection, was likely to irk Winston Aylett as more intemperate language could not. It did more. It baffled him, for a time. He could, and he meant, to withhold the lover's letter from his sister's eyes. He could - and upon this also he was deter- mined - command her, in the masterful manner that heretofore had never failed to work submission, never to meet, speak, or write again to the man he almost hated; will her to forget her childish fancy for his handsome face and glozing arts, and in the fulness of. time, to bestow her in marriage upon a partner of his own providing. He had no misgivings as to his ability to: accomplish all this, if the blackguard aforesaid could be kept' out - of her way until that remedial agent, Time, and lawful authority had a chance to do their work.  -But he was openly defied to prevent communication between the betrothed piir, unless his injunction had   - CRAPT--OR DIPLOMACY?       101  ]3abels endorsement; and, upon alighting from the stage at the village, on his return to Ridgeley, he had taken from the post-office, along with the impertinent missive addressed to himself, one for Mabel, super- scribed by the same hand. From the first, he had no intention of transferring it to the keeping of the proper owner. It was forwarded in direct disobedience to his; commands, and the writer should be made -to under- stand the futility of opposition to these. For several. hours, his only purpose respecting it was to enclose; it, unopened, in an envelope directed by himself, and send it back to the audacious author, by the next mail. He was balked in this project by no fastidious scruples as to his right thus to dispose of his ward's property. Nature, or what he assumed was natural affection, concurred with duty in urging him to hinder an alli. ance by which Mabel's happiness would be imperilled and her relatives scandalized. But when, in the soli-. tude of his study, he vouchsafed a second reading to Fredericks letter, preparatory to the response he de- signed should annihilate his hopes and chastise his im- pudence, a doubt of the efficacy of his schemes attacked him for the first time. i Under her own hand and seal,' were terms the explicitness of which commended them to his grave consideration. His next thought was to oblige Mabel to indite a formal renunciation of her unworthy suitor. There were several objections to this measure.   ,I 10o2    CRAFT-OR DIPLOMACY? Firstly, he disliked whatever smacked of scenic effect, and women were apt to get up scenes --hyster- ics, attitudes, and the like - upon trivial provocation. He wanted to get the thing over quietly and soon. Secondly, he was not very sure that he should find in Mabel the docile puppet. she had appeared to him for -7o many years of tutelage. She, had matured marvel- lously of late. Her very manner of meeting him that afternoon impressed him  by its self-possession and freedom from the emotion that used to gush from eyes and lips, in happy tears, and broken, delighted greet- ing at his approach. For alght he knew to the con- trary, she inight have accepted his fiat as just, if not merciful, and not a dream of rebellion been fostered thereby. The grave tranquillity of her demeanor might arise from the chastening influences of the mortification she had sustained, and a consciousness of ill-desert that bred humility., He would fain have be- lieved all this, but until he broached the subject to her, his incertitude could not be removed, and in a step so momentous as that which he meditated, it behooved him to try well the solidity of the ground beneath him .                      ; Lastly, our blood-prince of the kingdom of Ridge- ley was, whether he confessed it or not, acting under orders. -... "Be very tolerant with that poor little deceived sis- ter of yours!" his fancde had implored, her diamond   ! CBlAFT-- OR DIPLOMA CY?    103 eyes bedimmed by quick-springing damps of conmmis- eration. a Recollect that the consciousness of wasted love is always harder to bear than what dis commonly known as bereavement. If you find her refractory, be patient and persuasive, instead of dictatorial. Craft often effects what overt violence would attempt in vain." "Craft!"  The word struck unpleasantly upon the Virginia lordling's ear, and he echoed it with a suspic- ion of a frown upon his brow. "I am not an adept in chicanery!" "But ybu are a born diplomatist!" seductively. "And because I am of the same credulous sex as our mis- taken little darling, you will not proceed to open war- fare with her, even should she be loth to resign her lover a It is the glory of the strong to show charity to the weak and erring." ' For her sake, then, our flattered diplomatist would try the effect of guile, instead of brutality, upon the helpless girl, the balance of whose fate was grasped by his shapely hand. For one base second, the idea of attempting an imitation of his sister's handwriting flashed through his mind. But he was a gentleman, and forgery is not a gentlemanly vice, any more than is counterfeiting bank-notes. Finally, the kuthor of craft--the subtle, refined virtue bepraised by his: bride-elect - the devil - came to his help. 'Mabel, like most other girls, had a dainty and fan'   10Q4-     KAFT-R*fll- OS DIPLOMACYt P tastic taste in he matter of letter-paper and envelopes. Shei used inoie but French stationery, stamped with her monogram-a curious device, iwrought in two colors -and at the top of each sheet stood out in bas- relief the Aylett crest. With these harmless whimsies Frederic was, without doubt, familiar. If his letter were returned to him, wrapped in a blank page, taken from her papetiere and within one of her enve- lopes, it would not signify so much -whose handwrit- ing was upon the exterior. Paptiere and writing- desk were in Mabel's bed-room, but she was in the parlor, practising an instrumental duet with Rosa- a favorite with Miss Dorrance. Winston had brought it south with him, and asked his sister to learn it forth- ,with, in just the accent he used to employ when pre- scribing what studies she should pursue at school. There was nothing in his errand that he should be ashamed of, he reminded himself with impatient se- verity, as he traversed the upperthall on tip-toe to the western chamber. He had, on sundry previous occa- sions, sought, in the receptacles he was about to ran- sack, for sealing-wax, pencils, and the like trifles. Mabel was too wise a woman not to keep her secrets under lock and key, and if there were private docn- ments left in his way, he was too honorable to pry into them. Shutting the door 'cautiously, that the snap and blaze might not betray him, he struck a wax match,   'RAFT- OR - DIPLO OMA CY?     10 warranted to burn a minute-and-a-half, -and raised the lid of the desk. His unseen but wily coadjutor had guided him cunningly. In fingering a heap of envelopes in order to. find one large enough for his purpose, he brought to light one addressed to "Mr. Frederic Chilton, Box 910, Philadelphia, Penn." Upon the reverse was a small blot that had corn-  demned it in Mabel's sight, as unfit to be sent to  ' her most valued correspondent, -and which she had not observed before writing the direction. Selecting an- other, she had thrown this back carelessly into the desk, meaning to burn it when it should be convenient, and forgotten all about it. The livid dints were deep and restless in-Winstonls-  nostrils, as seen by the light of the tiny taper he raised to extinguish, when his prize was secured. The devil supplied him with another crafty hint, as he was in : the act of folding one edge of Frederic's letter that it might fit into the new cover. Why not strip off the letter entirely, that it might seem to have been opened, - read, and then flung back- upon -the writer's hands with contumely I Half-way measures were unsafe and fool-  ish. Stratagem, to be efficient, should be not only- deft, but thorough; else it was bungling, not diplo- macy. His hand did not shake in divesting the' closely- written sheet of its wrapping, but in 'one- respect his behavior was in consonance with the gentlemanly in- stincts he vaunted as a proof of pure old blood. He ' pro '-     I Wv   106     CRAFT-- OR .DIPLOlACYGY?, averted his eyes lest he should see a line the lover had penned to his mistress. The letter slipped smoothly into-the quarters prepared for it -smoothly as Satan's mark usually goes on until his tool has made his dam- natioh sure. "Well done?" said Diabolus. "That was a- clever hit!" chimed in his assistant, complacently, after he had put the sealed envelope in- to. the portfolio for safe-keeping, and burned the torn one he had removed. "Nobody but an idiot or a madman would persist in following a girl up after such a quietus."  He replied to Frederic's note to himself shortly and with disdain, using the third person throughout, and infotming Mr. Chilton with unmistakable distinctness that Miss Aylett had offered no opposition whatever to her brother's will in this unfortunate affair. So far as he -Mr. Aylett--could judge, her views coincided exactly with his own. Mr. Chilton's letters and pres-, ents should, be returned to him at an early day, and thus should be finished the closing chapter of a volume which ought never to have been begun. All this done to his mind, he set the door of his room ajar, and watched for Mabel's passage to hers. He had not to wait long. The young ladies had fallen into habits of early retiring of late - a marked change from their olden fashion of singing and talk- ;ing out the midnight hour. Himself unseen, Mr. ' , !*         CSRAPT- OR DIPLOMACY        07 Aylett scrutinized the two mounting the stairs side by side- Rosa's dark, mobile face, arch with smiles, while she chattered over a bit of country gossip she had heard that afternoon from a visitor, and the weary calm of Mabel's visage, the drooping eyelids, I'pnd, when appealed to directly by her volatile comrade,'the measured, not melancholy cadence of her answer. The girl had had a sore fight, and won a Pyrrhian vic- tory. She was not vanquished, but she was worsted. Some men, upon appreciating what this meant, and how her grief had been wrought, would have had direful vis- itings of conscience, surrendered themselves to the mas-  tery of doubts as to the righteousness and humanity of stringent action such as he had just consummated. He was not unmoved. He really loved his only sister, as proud, selfish men love those of their own lineage who have never disputed their supremacy, and derogated from. their importance. He said something under his breath before he called her, but the curse was not upon bhimself. "The low-bred hound!" he muttered. "This is his doing.!" Mabel halted atthe stair-head, the blood suddenly and utterly forsaking ;heri cheeks when he spoke her name, although his address was purposely kind, and, he thought, inviting. "Can you spare me a moment?" he continued, smilingly, to win her advance. "I will not detain .   A8    OCsAV-OSDIPOIA OI CY you long. I know you are agoninzing to have your talk out, Miss Rosa." Rosa laughed, with a saucy retort, and turned into her chamber. Mabel entered her brother's, and without speaking, took the seat he offered. She was to be sentenced, and she must reserve her forces to sustain the pain -ithout a groan. "You saw Jenkyns--did you not?!" began Mr. Aylett, with the manner of one at peace with himself, and those of his fellow-men whose existence he chose to acknowledge. "I did. He made memoranda of your orders, and said all should be done as you wished." "I ordered the masons, this evening, to begin the hall-chimney to-morrow.  While the work is going on, you had better occupy some other bed-room. I shall hurry it forward, day and night, or it will not -be done in season for us when we return from our bridal- tour.

'  He would have sneered bt this strain'in another as hyperbolical and fatuous. The absurdity of it in his. mouth consisted mainly in the cool arrogance of the assumption that whatever belonged to him was above adverse criticism, and would be maligned if it were referred to without appending an encomium. Much of fervor might and did mingle in his thoughts of her he was to wed, but none warmed his enumeration of her perfections. He did nothing con amore, unless-it were exalting the dignity and glory of the Aylett name, and maintaining his right to support their an- cient honors. Mabel did not respond to his gratuitous praise of the fa and benevolent Clara. While he was talking, he seemed to recede a great way from her; his tones to ring hollowly upon her hearing, his form to grow indistinct. Was he playing, with. her suspense, or could it be that he-a being with heart and nerves like hers, had -no conception of the rack on which- she was stretched -no suspicion that every one of his de- liberate sentences was a turn of the screw that re- doubled her torture? The Ayletts were a' strong- willed race, and she repressed all sign of suffering save intense pallor; made this less palpable by screening her eyes from the lamp-light -with a paper she took  :110     arcT-  OR D IPLOMACY?. from the table, and ther'eby throwing her features into deep shadow. "But it is not my intention Ato trouble you with matters that concern me alone," he pursued, without varying his intonations. "As I anticipated, Mr.- Chil- tqn declines explaining the ugly story relative to his earlier career of dissipation and, deceit, which I for- warded to you. He indulges, instead, in a tirade of personal abuse touching my right to control you, de- claring his purpose to pursue you with letters and at- tentions until he shall be discarded by yourself. We will not stay to discuss the gentlemanliness and deli- cacy of his behavior in this regard. I merely declare, that, having had a fair opportunity of 'honest confes- sion or denial of statements detrimental to his princi- ples and pursuits, and having shirked both, he has placed himself outside the pale of respectful consider- ation. Has he written to you since his receipt of my letter "               D "No" " Mabel was staring at a figure in the carpet, on a line with her feet. Had she regarded her brother never so attentively, she would 'have detected no change in hip countenance. He did not prepare ques- tions without also studying how to deliver them. "I am glad he has the moral decency to forbear carrying out his threat of persecution." He could say it with the greater hardihood in the "*         , I * /.    CRAT-- OR DIPLOMACYt     1 remembrance that the "persecution" had been at- tempted. "I wish he had written!" rejoined Mabel, abruptly, but without passion. "He was right to protest against accepting his dismissal from any other than myself." She had not removed her eyes from the-spot on the carpet, or lowered the paper screen. She looked like a statue and spoke like an automaton. Mr. Aylett's nostrils quivered ominously. "Is it your wish to recommence the correspondence I have ended a '  "You know that I would strike off my right hand sooner than do it. But if he had written to me, I should have answered his letter, if it had been only to bid him farewell. Since he has not chosen to do this, I carnnot take the initiative."  If Winston had never entertained a favorable opin- ion of his own sagacity prior to hearing this avowal, it would have forced itself upon him now. How timely was the thought, how felicitous the accident, that had aided him to ward off the disaster of renewed inter- course!  Involuntarily his fingers crept nearer to the closed portfolio. "No good 'could have come of that!" returned he, coldly.' "When an amputation is to be performed, wise people submit to it without useless preliminaries. The exchange of farewells in this case would be inex-   "2     aRAFT- OR DIPLOMACY? pedient in the highest degree. You would compro- mise yourself by continued acknowledgment of this fellow's acquaintance. My will is that you and the world should forget, as soon as it can be done, that you ever saw or heard of him. The connection was de- grading.' "Don't abuse him, brother! ILet the knowledge that we are parted forever, satisfy your resentment. Since he has not appealed to me from your verdict, I am left to suppose that, upon second thoughts, he has resolved to acquiesce in your will. I do not blame him for the change of purpose." Still impassive in feature and voice, still not withdrawing her fixed gaze from that one point upon the floor. "He, too, has pride, and it matches yours. I do not say mine. I question, sometimes, if I have any." - "If your conjecture be correct, you cannot object to ?*; ^turn the letters you have already received from him,;' said Winston, pressing on to the conclusion of a disagreeable business. "Since you are not likely to add to your stock of hese valuables, you do not care to retain them, I suppose? I believe the rule is total surrender of souvenirs when a rupture is pronounced hopeless."  ' I shall keep them a week longer!" She assigned no reason for the resolution, and her Manner, without being sullen, aggravated her brother   CRAFT- OR DIPLOM aCY?       113   , - . into wrath, the effusion of which was a withering sneer. , Your hope in his repentance is creditable to the strength -or weakness-- of woman's love. But have your way. The illustrious record of his former life is a powerful argument in favor of clemency. In a week, then!" He nodded dismissal, wheeled his chair around to the table, dipped a pen in the standish, and pulled an account-book toward him. He was surprised and not pleased, nevertheless, that Mabel retired without other reply than a simple "Good-night" said without temper, or any evidence of excitement. A month before, a milder sarcasm, the lightest breath of reproof, would have brought her to his feet in a paroxysm of tears, to implore pardon for her contumacy, and to promist obedience for all time to come. She was getting beyond his control tfie while she offered no open resistance to his govern - ment. Was sorrowful shame, or her infatuation for  the adventurer he cursed in his heart by his gods, the influence that was .petrifying her into this unlovely caricature of her once bright and affectionate self? She presented herself, unsummoned, in his study at the expiration of the period she had designated, a pac- quet in her hand, neatly done up and sealed. "I will trouble you to direct it," was all she said, -as she laid it before him.               ?::   "4:     CRA OT- O DIPLOMA C Y? "This is done of your own free will - remember!" he said, impressively. "In after years, should you be so unreasonable as to regret it, there must be no mis- conception on the subject between us. If you wish, at this, the eleventh hour, to draw back, I shall not op- pose you." You will write the address, 'then, if 'you please!" was Mabel's reply, showing him the surface intended for it. Then she left him. "A sensible girl, after all! a genuine Aylett, in will and stoicism I " commented the master of the situ- ation, beginning in his round, legible characters, the inscription he hoped never to trace again. "So endeth her first lesson in Cupid's manual!" , .: He never knew that Mrs. Sutton had bolstered the Aylett will and stoicism into stanchness at this clos- ing scene. In a fit of despondency, she had that morn- :ing imparted to Mabel the fact that she had written to Frederic, ten days before, and had no answer, although she had besought an immediate one. "I have expected him confidently every day for a week," she lamented.  "I didn't suppose he would stay at Ridgeley, after what has happened; but-tiere's the hotel in the village, and, as I told him, he could accomplish more by an hour's talk with you thmn by fifty letters. It is very mysteriots--his continued si- lence! He always appeared so frank and reasonable.   CAprT- O  DIPLOMAC!      .115Y Nothing else like it has ever occurred in my experi- ence  and I have had a great deal, my dear!" "I am sorry you wrote, aunt," replied Mabel, sor- rowfully dignified. "'Sorry you have subjected your- self to unnecessary mortification. I am past feeling it for myself. We cannot longer doubt that Mr. Chilton desires to hold no further communication with any of us. Within the hour she made up the pacquet and car- p ried it to her brother., - . . . , ." .  .   CTTAPTER VII. WASSAl i "OST sixteen months had passed since the, dewless September morning, when Mabel had gathered roses in the garden walks, and her brother's return had shaken the dew with the bloom from her young heart. It was the evening of Christmas-day, and the tide of wassailthe blaze of yule, were high at Ridgeley. Without, the fall of snow that had commenced at sundown, was waxing hevier and the  in fiercer.. In-doors, fires roared  and crackled upon every hearth; there was a stir of busy or merry life in every room. About the spacious fire-place ir the "baronial" hall was a wide semicircle of young people, and before thatin t he parlor, a cluster of elders, whose graver talk was enlivened, from 'time to time; by the peals of laughter that tossed into j ubil- it surf the stream of the juniors' converse. lNearest the mantel, on the left wing of- the line, sat ;he. three months" bride, Imogene Barksdale, placid, loye-eyed, and smiling as of yore, very comely with (116)              I    WSsA -S,. s117         . 1 her expression of satisfied  prettiness nobody called vanity, and bedecked in her "second day's dress" of azure silk and her bridal ornaments.  Her husband hovered on the outside of the ring, now pulling the floating curls of a' girl-cousin (every third girl in the country was his cousin, once, twice, or thrice-removed, and none resented the liberties he, as a married: man, was pleased to take), anon whispering in the ear of a bashful maiden interrogatories as to her latest admirer or rumored engagement; oftenest leaning 'qpon the back of his wife's chair, a listener to what was going on, his hand lightly touching her lace-veiled shoulders, until her'head gradually inclined against his arm. They were a loving couple, and not shy of testifying their content to the world. "Theyremind me irresistibly of a pair of plump babies sucking at opposite ends of a stick of sugar candy!" Rosa Tazewell said aside to the hostess, as the latter paused beside her on her way through the hall to the parlor. "The candy is very sweet I" replied Mrs. Aylett, charitably, but laughing at the conceit--the lwi, musical laugh that was at once girlish in its gleeful- ness, yet perfectly well-bred. Aylett heard it from his stand on the parlor* rug, and sent a quick glance in that direction. It was' slow in returning to the group surrounding him.  He had married a beautiful woman-so said every    "8,    -    WAss8Al.  body-and a fascinating, as even everybody's wife did not dispute. In his sight, she was simply and entirely worthy of the distinction he had. bestowed upon her; an adornment to Ridgeley and his name. From their wedding-day, his deportment toward her had been the samel as it was to-night--attentive, but never officious; deferential, yet far removed from ser- vility; a manner that, without approximating uxorious- ness, yet impressed the spectator with the conviction that she was with him first and dearest among women; a partner of whom, if that were possible, he was more proud than fond - and of the depth and reality of his affection there could be no question. She declined to seat herself in the circle, although warmly importuned by her guests thus to add bril- liancy to their joyous party, yet remained standing near Rosa, interested and amused by the running fire of compliment and badinage that went to make up the hilarious confusion. If the family record had been consulted, the truth that she had counted her thirty- second summer would have astonished her husband, with her new neighbors. Apparently she was not over twenty-five. Her chestnut hair was a marvel for brightness and profusion, her broad brow smooth and white, her figure, as Winston had described it to his sister, rounded, even to voluptuousness, yet supple as it had been at fifteen. In her cheeks, too, the blushes fluctuated readily and softly, and when she smiled, her h  .    M A W  M8AT l,.  " '   g 19 teeth showed like those of a little child in size and -: purity. JIer voice matched her beauty well, never loud, always melodious, with a peculiar, gliding, legato movement of the graceful sentences, for the pleasing   ;i effect of which she was indebted partly to Nature, and - : much more to Art. She appeared on this evening in a green silk dress, matronly in shade and general style, but not devoid of coquettish arrangement in the square corsage, the opening of which was filled with foam- like puffs of thulle, threatening, when her bust[ heaved in mirth or animated speech, to overflow the sheeny boundaries. A chaplet of ivy-leaves encircled her    ' head, and trailed upon one shoulder; her bracelets    , were heavy, chased gold without gems of any kind;  a single diamond glittered -a point of prsmatic light at' her throat. Her wedding-ringwas her only other ornament. I "Very sweet, I grant you, and very flavorless," re- turned Rosa. "And alarmingly apt to turn sour upon the stomach. I had rather be fed upon pepper lozen- ges." "You should have been born in the Spice Islands," said the hostess, tapping the dark cheek with her fore- finger., "But we could'nottspare you from our wassail-  cup to-night, my dear Lady Pimento "        I " She bent slightly, that the flattery might reach no I : other ear. She may not have known that Rosa's creole skin was at a wretched disadvantage, as seen against    ...20   ,  ---- WA SSA F,. the green silk background; but others noticed it, and thought how few complexions were comparable to the wearers. She had the faculty of converting into a foil nearly every woman who approached her. "Thank 7youl So I am pimento, am 1" queried Ro6a, pertly. "And each of us is to personate some condiment -sweet, ardent, or aromatic--in the exhil- arating draught! Which shall Mr. Harrison here be? 4t ' Ci*nnamon or ginger, nutmeg or cloves? '" "-That is a line of a college drinking-song!" The speaker was a young man of eight-and-twenty, who sat between Rosa and Mabel, and whose atten- tions to -the latter were marked. Of medium height, with Sandy hair and whiskers, high cheek-bones, that gave a Gaelic cast to his physiognomy; which was re- markable for nothing in particular when at rest, and followed somewhat tardily the operations of his mind when he talked, he would probably have been the least likely person present to rivet a stranger's notice but for the circumstance that he played shadow to the host's sister and was Mrs. Aylett's brother. With regard to the feeling entertained by the former of those ladies for him, there were many and diverse opinions, but his sister's partiality was unequivocally exhibited. Of her three brothers, this-the youngest, the least handsome, and the only bachelor--was her favorite. She took pains to apprise his fellow-guests of this interesting   WASA L.     11.' fact by petting him openly, and exerting her finest artifices to bring him out in becoming colors. "It is," she answered him now, admiringly. "What a memory you have, my dear Herbert! Now I am never positive with whom to credit a quotation. I recollect, since you have spoken, that your famous quartette-club used to render that with much gelat, and how it was encored at the brilliant private concert you gave in behalf of some popular charity or other." ' Thus encouraged, Mr. Dorrance proceeded to enlarge the fragment: "' (Nose, nose, jolly red nose I Where got you that jolly red nose? Nutmeg and ginger, cinnamon and cloves, These gave me this jolly red nose.' You did not quote the third line correctly, Miss Tazewell." "Never having been a college bacchanalian, I am excusable for the inaccuracy," she retorted a "I did not even know where I picked up the foolish bit. Having ascertained the origin to be of doubtful respectability, I shall never use it again." "My sister has alluded t our quartette-club,' pur-    - sued Mr. Dorrance, turning from the caustic beauty to    - Mabel, without noticing the impertinent thrust. "It     : was the most successful thing of the kind I ever knew    ; of, being composed of thoroughly-trained musicians-  amnateur of course - and practising nothing but classic   :I 6     .    .          .

"Especially when the theme of their consideration is the. ' Jolly Red Nose,"' interposed the wicked minx at his other elbow. Two giddy girls tittered, unawed by Bhes. Aylett's proximity and her brother's owl-like stare at his critic. "You may not be aware, Miss Tazewell, that lyric to which you have reference is celebrated, both for its antiquity, and the pleasing harmonies that must ever commend it to the taste of the true lover of music; although I allow that to a disciple of the modern and more flimsy ,school of this glorious art, it may seem puerile and ridiculous," he remarked, in grandiose pat- / ronage. Then,- again to Mabel, "There were four of s - as I said- all students. What is it, Clara? a  "I have dropped my bracelet upon the floor, between yu -and Miss Tazewell," stooping to shake out Rosa's full kirts, from which the trinket fell with a clinking sound. Three gentlemen darted forward to pick it up, but her husband noted approvingly that, while she accepted it graciously from the lucky finder, and thanked the others for their kindly interest in the fate of her " bau- ble," she held out her arm to her brother, that he might clasp it again in its place. Affable always, winning whomsoever she chose to admiration of, her personal   WA4 SA 7IT.   ,123       : and mental endowments, she never departed from mat. ronly decorum. The company agreed silently, or in guarded asides, that she was charming. No tongue- even the most reckless or venomous-- ever lisped the dread word, levity, in connection with her name. "Take care, my dear brother! you will pinch me!" those near heard her say, and she twisted the golden circlet that the clasp might be uppermost. Rosa's alert ear caught the hurried murmur which succeeded, and was muffled, so to speak, by her affec- tionate smile of gratitude. "What were you about to say? Will you never learn prudence " " "The dove has talons, then?" mused the eavesdrop- per. ',But what was he in danger of revealing?" If the interdicted revelation had connection, close or : remote, with the famous quartette club, he kept well away from  it after this reminder, beginning, when he resumed his seat, to discourse upon the comparative    i excellence of wood and  coal fires, of open  hmney-  I places and stoves.                    I Mrs. Aylett smiled an engaging and regretful "au te revoir" to the circle, and passed on to look after the   ] comfort and pleasure of her elder visitors, and Rosa soon discovered that her awakened curiosity would be in no wise appeased by listening to the steady, patter-   ing drone of Mgr. Dorrance's oration.  Oratorical he    l was to a degree that excited the secret amusement of   i   124    ;    W  ;AATAM,. the facile Southern youths about him. With them, the art of light conversation had been a study from boy- hood, the topics suitable for and pleasing to ladies' ears carefully culled and adroitly handled. To amuse and entertain was their main object. Erudite disserta- tions upon science and literature; abstruse arguments -whatever resembled a moral thesis, a political, reli- gious, or philosophical lecture met with the sure ban of ridicule from them, as from the fair whose devoted cavaliers they were. If they laughed, when it was safe and not impolitic to do so, at the ponderous elocution of the Northern barrister, they marvelled exceedingly more at Mabel's indulgence of his attentions. That a girl, who, in virtue of her snug fortune and attractive face, her blood and her breeding, might, as they put it, have the "pick of the county,"' if she wanted a hus- band, should lend a willing ear to the pompous plati- tudes, the heavy rolling periods of this alien to her native State-a man without grace of manner or beauty-in their nomenclature, " asolemn prig," de- fied all ingenuity of. explanation, was an increasing wonder outlasting the prescribed nine days. He rode with the ill-assurance of one who, accustomed to the sawdust floor, treadmill round, and enclosing walls of a city riding-school, was bewildered by the unequal road' and free air of the breezy country. He talked learn  edly of hunting, quoting written authorities upon thi? or that point, of whom the unenlightened Virginians   WA SSAr.        v 125  had never heard, much less read; equipped himself for the sport in a bewildering arsenal of new-fangled guns, game-bags, shot-pouches, and powder-horni, with a numerous belts, diagonal, perpendicular, and horizontal, and in the field carried his gun d la Winkle; never, by any happy accident, brought down his bird, but was continually outraging sporting rules by firing out of time, and flushing coveys prematurely by unseasonable :talking and precipitate strides in advance of his dis- gusted companions. Yet he was not a fool. In the discussion of graver matters-politics, law, and history-that arose in the smoking-room, he was not to be put down by more fluent tongues; demolished sophistry by solid reason- ing, impregnable assertions, and an array of facts- that might be prolix, but was always formidable -in short, sustained fully the character ascribed to him by his  brother-in-law, of a " thoroughly sensible fellow." "No genius, I allow!"Mr. Aylett would add, in speaking of his wife's bantling among his compatriots, . "but a man whose industry and sound practical knowl- edge of every branch of his profession will .make for him the fortune and name genius rarely wins."  With the younger ladies, his society was, it is super- fluous to observe, at the lowest premium civility and. - na-ive kindliness of disposition would permit them to declare by the nameless andc innumerable methods in. which the dear creatures are proficient. To Rosa Taze- - i   126     .  ,  '-- JSA IT, ' l well he could not be anything better than a target for the arrows of her satire, or the whetstone, upon the unyielding surfge of which she sharpened them. But she showed her prudential foresight in 'laughing at him when out of his sight, and ijmabel's. As long ago as the night of Mr. Aylett's wedding-partyy at Ridgeley, her sharp eyes had seen, or she fancied they did, that the hum-drum groomsman was mightily cap- tivated by the daughter of the house, and she had divined that Mrs. Aylett's clever ruses for throwing the two together were the outworks of her design for uniting, by a double bond, the houses of Dorrance and Aylett. She knew, furthermore, that Herbert Dorrance had travelled with the Ridgeley family for three weeks in October, and that he had now been domesticated at the homestead for ten ;days. Mrs. Aylett's show of fondness for him was laughable, considering what an uninteresting specimen of masculinity he was; but the handsome dame was too worldly-wise, too sage a judge of quid pro quo, to entice him to waste so much of the time he wis addicted to announcing was money to him, for the sake of a good so intangible as sisterly sentimentality. t Unless there were some substantial and remunera- tive ulterior object to be gained by his tarryin' in the neighborhood, cunninglRosa believed that "dear Ber- tie" would have been packed off to Buffalo, or what- ever outlandish place he lived in, so soon as the bridal   WASATr,.         127 --  j'i festivities were over, and not showed his straw-colQred whiskers again in Virginia in three years, at least, in- stead of running down to the plantation every three months.                         ] "If such an ingredient as the compound, double- distilled essence of flatness is to be infused into the wassail-cup, it is he who will supply it!" thought the , spicy damsel5 with a bewitching shrug of the plump shoulder nearest him, while engaged in a lively play of words with a gentleman on her -other hand. "What can possess Mabbel to encourage him systematically in her decorous style, passes my powers of divination.   : Maybe she means to use him as a poultice' for her bruised heart. In that case, insipidity would be no objection." Mabel had not the air of one whose heart is bruised or torn. That she had gained in queenliness within ' the past year was not evidence of austerity or the cal- . lousness: that ensues upon the healing of a wound.    X The Ayletts were a stately race, and the few who, while I she was in her teens, had carped at her lack of pride because of her disposition to choose friends from the  ] walks of life lower than her own, and criticised as un- becoming .the playful familiarity that caused under-  j lings and plebeians -the publicans and sinners of the aristocrat's creed-to worship the ground on which    ! she trod--the censors in the court of etiquette con- ferred upon her altered demeanor the patent of their :nr the pa 'th'e"i r,   1-2$8        WASSAIL. approbation, averring, for the 'thousalndth time, that good blood would assert itself in the long run and bring forth the respectable fruits of refinement, self- appreciation, and condescension. The change had come over her by perceptible, but not violent, stages of progression, dating- Mrs. Sutton saw with pain; Rosa, with enforced respect-- from the sunset hour in which she had read her brother's sentence of condem- -nation upon her then betrothed, now estranged, lover. After that one evening, she had not striven to conceal herself and her hurt in solitude. Neither had she bor- rowed from desperation a brazen helmet to hide the forehead the cruel letter had, for a brief space, laid low in the dust of anguished humiliation. If a whisper of her disappointment and the attend- ant incidents crept through the ranks of her associates, it died away for want of confirmation in her clear, level-lidded eyes, elastic footfall aid the willingness and frequency with which she appeared and played her part in the various scenes of gayety that made the winter succeeding her brother's marriage one long to be remembered by the :pleasure-seekers of the vicinity. She had not disdained the assistance of her sister-in- law's judgment and experience in the choice of the dresses that were to grace these merry-makings, and, thanks to her own naturally excellent taste, now tacitly -disputed the palm of elegant attire with that lady. Her Christmas costume, which, in many others of her   WASSAIL..;        129 age, would have been objected to by critical fashionists, as old-maidish and grave, yet set off her pale complex- ion -dnone of the Ayletts were rosy after they reached  man's or womanfs estate--and heightened her dis- tingue bearing into regal grace. Yet it was only a heavy black silk, rich and glossy as satin, cut, as was then the universal rule of evening dress, tolerably low in the neck, with short sleeves; bunches of pomegranate- blossoms and buds for breast and shoulder-knots, and among the classic braids of her dark hair ahalf-wreath of the same. She had the valuable gift of sitting still without stiffness, and not fidgetting with fan, bouquet, or hand- kerchief, as she listened or talked. Rosa's mercurial temperament betrayed itself, every instant, in the bird-like turn of her small head, the fluttering or chafing of her brown fingers, and not unfrequently by an impatient stamp, or other movement of her foot that exposed fairy toe and instep. Contemplation of  the one rested and refreshed the observer; of the other, amused and excited him. Mr. Dorrance's plhleg-   matic nature found supreme content in dwelling upon the incarnation of patrician tranquillity at his right hand, and he regarded the actions of his frisky would- be tormentor very much as a placid, well-gorged sal- mon would survey, from his bed of ease upon the bot- tom of a stream, the gyrations of a painted dragon-fly overhead. 6*            '   -   A-WASATT ,. A lull in the general conversation--the reaction after a hearty laugh at a happy repartee - gave Others besides Mabel the opportunity of profiting hy his learned remarks.  "But does not that seem to you a short-sightd pol- icy," he was urging upon his auditor, with the ;assist- ance of a thumb and forefinger of one hand, joiied as upon a pinch of snuff, and tapping the centre sf the other palm; " does not that appear inexcusable profli- gacy of extravagance, which fells and consumes whole surface forests of magnificent trees- virgin growth (I use the term as it is usually applied, although, philosophically considered, it is inaccurate) giants, which centuries will not replace, instead of seeking beneath the superficial covering of mould, nourishing these, for the exhaustless ricles, carboniferous remains of antediluvian woods, hidden in the bowels of your mountains, and underlying your worn-out fields?" Rosa was shaking with internal laughter - she would give no escape except through her dancing eyes. Indeed, Mr. Dorrance's was the only staid counte- nance there, as Mabel said, pleasantly, moving her chair beyond the bounds of the ring, "I, for one, find the combustion of the upper forest-growth too powerful, just at this instant. This is a genuine Christmas-storm.- is it not? Listen to the wind?" In the stillness enjoined by her gesture, the growl of   w SATs.4 rr        131 the blast in the chimney and in the grove; the groan- ing, flapping, and creaking of the tree branches; the pelting sleet and the rattle of casements all over the house brought to the least imaginative a picture of out-door desolation and fireside comfort that prolonged the hush of attention. Tom Barksdale's pretty wife slipped her hand covertly into his tight grasp, and their smile was of mutual congratulation that they were brightly and warmly housed and together. Rosa, pre- ternaturally grave and quiet, lapsed into a profound study of the mountain of red-hot embers. Several young ladies shuddered audibly, as well as visibly, and were reassured by a whispered word, or the slightest conceivable movement of their gallants' chairs nearer their own. "I think we have the grandest storms at Ridgeley that visit our continent," resumed Mabel thoughtfully. "I suppose because the house stands so high. The wind never sounds to me anywhere else as it does here on winter nights." Yielding to the weird attraction of the scene in- voked by her fancy, she arose and walked to the ! window at the eastern extremity of the hall, pulling aside the curtain that she might peer into the wild darkness. The crimson light of the burning logs and the lamp rays threw a strongly defined shadow of her figure upon the piazza floor, distinct as that projected by a solar microscope upon a sheeted wall;     132'        WASSAIL. sent long, searching rays into the misty fall of the snow, past the spot from which she had her last glimpse of Frederic Chilton, so many, many-donths, agone, showing the black outline of the gate where he had looked back to lift his hat to her. What was there in the wintry night and thick tempest to recall the warmth and odor of that moist September morning, the smell of the dripping roses overhead, the balmy humidity of every breath she drew? What in her present companion that remind- ed her of the loving clasp that 'had thrilled her heart into palpitation? the earnest depth of the eyes that held hers during the one sharp, yet sweet moment of parting-- eyes that .pledged the fealty of her lover's soul, and demanded hers then and forever? His con- science might have been sullied by crimes more heinous than those charged upon him by her brother and his  friends ; he might - he had --let her go easily, las one resigns his careless hold upon a paltry, unprized toy; but when her hand had rested thus in his, and his pas- sionate regards penetrated her soul, he loved her, alone and entirely! She would fold this conviction to her torpid heart for a little while before she turned-herself away finally from the memories of that love-summer and battle-autumn of her existence. If it aroused in the chilled thing some slight pangs of sentiency, it would do her no hurt to realize through these that it had onoe been alive,   'int WASSAIL.         133- She saw'a shadow approaching to join itself to hers- lpon the whitened floor without, before Mr. Dorrance -  nterrupted her reverie by words. "The fury of the tempest you admire proves its pa-  ;ernity," he said, with a manifest effort at lightness. J ' It emanates from the vast magazines of frost, snow, md wintry wind that lie far to the north-east even of -  my home, and that is in a region you would think Irear and inhospitable after the more clement airs of Af your native State." "We have very cold weather in Virginia sometimes," returned ]Mabel, still scanning the sentinel gate-posts,  mnd the pyramidal arbor-vitse trees flanking them. Her gaze was a mournful farewell, but she neglect-  ad none of the amenities of hospitality. She was used :o talking commonplaces.  "We feel it all the more, too, on account of the  mildness of the greater part of the winter," she sub- joined. "Allow me!" said the other, looping back the cur- ;ain she had until now held in her hand. "Whereas )ur systems are braced by a more uniform temperature;i to endure the soevrity of our frosts. and high, keen  I blasts."                -  "I suppose so," assented Mabel, mechanically, and : unconscious as himself that meaning glances were stol-: en at them from the fireside circle, while the hum and conversation was continuous and louder, for the   1   134         WASSATL,. good-natured intent on the speakers' part to afford the supposed lovers the chance 'of carrying on their dia- logue unheard.           , "But our houses are very comfortable - often very beautiful," Mr. Dorrance persevered, keeping to the scent of his game, as a trained pointer scours a stubble- field, narrowing his beat at every circuit; " and the hearts of those who live in them are warm and con- stant. It is not always true that    \  . The cold in clime are cold in blood; Their love can scarce deserve the name. I I have thought sometimes that that feeling is strongest " and most endtring, the demonstration of which is guarded and infrequent, as the deepest portion of the ,channel is the most quiet." If his philosophical and scientific talk were heavy and solid, his, poetry and metaphors were ponderous and labored. Yet Mabel listened to him now, neither facing nor avoiding him, looking down at her hands, laid, one above the other, upon the window-sill, the image of maidenly and courteous attention. Why should she affect diffidence, or seek to escape what she had foreseen for weeks, and made no effort to ward off 'She had come to the conclusion in October that Herbert Dorrance would, when the forms he con- sidered indispensable to regular courtship had been gone through with, ask her to marry him, and coolly   WASSAIL.         135 taken her resolution to accept him. This morning, on the reception of a handsome Christmas gift from him, and discovering in his actions something more pointed than his customary punctilious devoirs, and ih his did- acticism the outermost of the closing circle of pursuit,  she had furthermore concluded that his happy thought was to celebrate the festal season by his betrothment. She was quite ready for the declaration, which, she anticipated, would be pompous and formal. She would have excused him from " doing " the poetical part of it; but, since it was on the programme, it was not her province to interfere. "I am no enthusiast," he next averred.-Rosa would have said, very unnecessarily -" the tricks of si'Slling lovers are beyond--or beneath-my imitation. I could not 'write a sonnet to my mistress' eyebrow,' or move. her to tearful pity by sounding declarations of my ad- oration of her peerless charms, and my anguish at the bare imagination of the possibility that these would ever be another's. But, so far as the earnest affection  i and sincere esteem of an honest man can satisfy the requirements of a good woman's heart, yours shall be   : filled, Mabel, if you will be my wife. I have admired you from the first day of our meeting. For six months , I have been truly attached to you, and seriously medi- tated this declaration. Your brother is satisfied with  the exhibit I have made of my affaal my prospects,    i and sanctions my addresses, I can maintain youmore .     136         W WASSAIL. Om\  b   u i   b A than comfortably, and it shall be one of the principal aims of my life to consult your welfare in all my plans for my own advancement. I have been settled in the large and flourishing city of Albany about seven years, and-ignoring the trammels of mock humility, let me say to you - have, within that period, gained to a flattering extent the confidence of the most respecta- ble portion of the community; have built up an ex- cellent and growing ]business connection, and secured the entrde of the best society, there. These are the pecuniary and social aspects of the alliance I propose for your consideration. Through my sister, and by means of the intimate association into which hler mar- riage with your brother has drawn you and myself, you have been enabled, within the twelvemonth that has elapsed since our introduction, one to the other, to learn whatever you wished to know with respect to my personal character, my tastes, temper, and habits. It has given me heartfelt pleasure to discover that these are, in the main, analogous to your own. I have built upon this similarity - or harmony would be the better a\ sword - sanguine hopes of our future happiness, should you see your way clear to accept my proffered hand, consent to link your future with mine." "I beg to lay the 'ouse in Waleot Square,.the busi- ness and myself, before Miss Summerson, for her ac- ceptance," said magnanimous Mr. Guppy, thus clinch-   WASSA r.   .r137. ing his declaration that " the image he had supposed  was eradicated from his 'art was not eradicated." 1: It was more in keeping with Rosa's character than  M9abel's to recollect the comic scene in the book they had read together lately, but the latter did rememberi it at this instant, and despite the momentous issues involved in her immediate action, was strongly tempted to laugh in her wooer's solemn face. Then-so abrupt and fearful are the transitions from the extremes of one emotion to another-arose before her another picture. As in a dissolving view, she beheld herself walking with Frederic Chilton in     the moonlighted alleys of the garden; midsummer  flowers blooming to the right and left, her head droop- ing, in shy happiness, as the lily-bell bows to shed its freight of dew; his face glowing with the ardor of     verbal confession of that he had already sought to ex- press by letter -heard his fervent, pleading murmur, "Mabel! look ap, my darling! and tell me again that you will not send me away beggared and starving. I cannot yet believe in the reality of my bliss!" These were the love-words of an " enthusiast"-- these The vision vanished at the short, hard breath she drew in unclasping her locked hands, and lifting her grave, tranquil eyes to the level of her suitor's.  "I will follow your example in repudiating spurious sentiment, Mr. Dorrance. I believe you to be a good, ;:   138          SSA rr,. true man, and that the attachment you profess for me is sincere. I believe, moreover, that my chances of se- curing real peace of mind will be fairer, should I com-o  mit myself to your guardianship, than if I were to sur- render my affections to the keeping of one whose vows were more impassioned, who, professing to adore me as a divinity, should yet be destitute of your high moral principle and stainless honor. When I was younger and more rash in judgment and feeling, I was led into a sad mistake by the evidence of eye, ear, and a girl's imagination. I ought to tell you this, if you have not already heard the story. I will not deceive you into the persuasion that I can ever feel for you, or any other man, the love, or what I thought was love, I knew in the few .brief weeks of my early betrothal. But you must know how that ended, and I have no de- sire to repeat the mad experiment of risking my earthly all upon one throw of fate. If friendship--if es. teem, and the resolve to show myself a worthy recipi- ent of your generous confidence--will content you, all else shall be as you wish." In her determination to be candid, to leave him in no uncertainty as to her actual sentiments, she had concerted a response but a degree less stilted than his proposal. She would have been ashamed of it had he appeared less gratified. His dull eyes brightened; his face flushed and beamed with unfeigned delight, and in his transport   WASSA rM.        139: he said the most natural and graceful thing that ever escaped him during his wooing. "I am content! The second love of Mabel Aylett must ever be more to me than the first of any other woman!" True, he nearly spoiled all the next minute, by pro- ducing from his pocket a wee velvet case, from which he extracted a valuable diamond ring, and proceeded, then and there, in the shadow of the accommodat- ing curtain, to fit it upon her finger. 'He had fore- seen that she would not be hardly won, and with characteristic providence had prepared himself for the event. The blood leaped to 3ghel's temples and the fire to her eye, at the prompt seal set by the practical non- enthusiast upon the contract, but she bit her lip, and submitted after a second of thought. He owed his exemption from rebuke to her memory of his latest utterance. She could not mistake the tone of genuine feeling, and she overlooked the breach of taste that followed; treasured up the heart-saying as one of the few souvenirs she cared to preserve of his courtship. "If he is content, I need not be miserable" was the consolatory reflection with which she took upon herself her new and binding obligations.   CHAPTER   VIiI. THE FACE AT THE WINDOW. RS. AYETT was in her best feather that night; the suave chatelaine, the dutiful con- sort; the tactful warder of the interesting pair whose movements she had not ceased to watch from the moment they took their places with the party about the fire-place in the hall until she, alone of all the company, saw Herbert Dorrance draw the dia. mond signet from its receptacle, and the sparkle of the jewel as it slipped to its abiding-place upon Mabel's finger. Lest something unusual in their, look or behavior should excite the suspicions of their companions, make them the focus of inquisitive observation and whispered remark, the diplomate passed again into the hall, sweeping along in advance of them when they deserted their curtained recess, and would have joined the rest of the company. "Are we to have no dancing this evening?" she said, in hospitable solicitude. "It wants an hour yet of (140)   THE FACE AT THE WI lOW.      141 supper-time. The exercise will do you all good, par- ticularly the young ladies, who have not stirred beyond the piazzas to-day. I have been waiting for an invita- tion to play for you, but my desire for your welfare has overcome native humility. Will you accept my services as your musician " The suggestion was acceded to by acclamation, and while one gentleman led her to the grand piaing which stood between the front windows of the drawing-room, and another opened a music-book which she named, a set was quickly formed in the long apartnent, the soberer portion of the crowd ranging themselves along the walls as lookers-on. Mrs. Aylett was a proficient in dance-music. She never volunteered to perform that which she was not conscious of doing well. She had occasionally taken the floor for a single quadrille, to oblige a favored guest- always a middle-aged or elderly gentleman -or moved through a cotillion with ease and spirit as partner to her husband, but she declined dancing, as a rule; was altogether indifferent to the amusement, while she delighted to oblige her friends by playing for them whenever and as long as they required her aid. Without saying, in so many words, that she dis- approved of the waltz -for unmarried ladies, and frowned upon promiscuous dancing for matrons, she yet managed to regulate the social code of the neigh-   "2    T7tI PACE AT THE W    NdOW. borhood in both these respects, was imitated and quoted by the most discreet of chaperones and belles. Mr. Dorrance was Mabel's partner; Rosa stood up with Randolph Harrison, a gav youth, who was her latest attache ; Tom Barksdale led out a blushing, yet sprightly school-girl, and Imogene was his vis-d-vis, supported by-an ancient admirer, who had comforted himself for her preference for another man by falling in love with a prettier woman. The room was deco- rated with garlands of runuing cedar -a vine known in higher latitudes as , ground-pine," and which car- peted acres of the Ridgeley woods. The vases on the mantel were filled with holly, and other gayly colored berry boughs, while roses, lemon and orange blossoms, mignonette and violets from the conservatory were set about on tables and brackets, blending fresher and more wholesome odors with those of the Parisian ex- tracts wafted from the ladies' dresses and handker- chiefs. Mr. Aylett had - accidentally, it would seem - his wife understood that the action was premeditated- stationed himself at an angle to the piano that allowed him a fair view of her, and did not grudge the merri- est bachelor there his share of enjoyment, while he could keep furtive watch upon the changeful counte- nance, the Sappho-like head, and the delicate hands which one could have thought made the music, rather than did the obedient keys they touched. The wedded   I ri FACE AT  KI   au WINDOW.  143 lovers had taste and pride in equal proportions, and a parade of their satisfaction in one another for the edifi- cation or amusement of indifferent spectators would have been revolting to both, but the ray that sped from half-averted eyes, from time to time, and was returned by a kindling glance, also shot sidelong beneath dropped lashes, said more to each other thain would a quarto volume of stereotyped protestations and caress- es, such as Tom B1arksdale 'dealt out profusely to his beauteous Imogene. Clearly, neither Mr. nor Mrs. Winston Aylett was fond of sugar-candy. Mabel's faith in the sincerity of her sister-in-law's agreeable sayings and ways was not invariable- nor absolute. She liked her after a certain fashion; got along swimmingly with her, the amazed public decided "so much\ better than could have been expected, and than was customary with relations by marriage, and not- by descent;;" yet her more upright nature and different training helped her to Idetect the petty artifices with which Clara cajoled the unwary, moulded the plastic a/t her will. But she had never questioned the reality of her love for Winston. As a wife, her deportment was exemplary, her devotion too freely and consistently rendered to have its spring in policy qr affectation. She gloried in her handsome, courtly lord, and in his attachmlunent for herself. Whether she would have es- pied the same causes for loving exultation in him, had he been a poor clergyman or merchant's clerk, was an Io  "4   . ; Z S PRACE AT LEB WIND.

Clara Dorrance was a clever woman, and she had given these due weight in accepting his hand; and they may'have had their influence in moving her to unceasing, yet unobtrusive endeavor to make herself still more neces- sary to his happiness, to strengthen her hold upon him by every means an affectionate and beloved wife has at her command. She had done well for herself -she was thin kng while he concluded as silently within himself that the slight pensiveness tempering the ex- pressive face was its loveliest dress. She- beautiful and penniless, ambitious, and a devotee of -pleasure- yet dependent for food and * clothing upon her mother's life-interest in an estate, not one penny of which would revert to her children at her decease; without kindred and without society in the elegant suburb they had inhabited for four or five years, might have been elated at a less brilliant match than that she had made. The "best people" of the aforesaid suburb were exclusive; slow to form intimacies with their unaccredited neighbors, and very hasty in breaking them at the faintest whiff of a doubt- ful or tainted reputation. And of the second best the Dorrances had kept themselves clear. - Having met and captivated her wealthy lover on a rarely  fortunate summer jalmt, made in company with her   'H-JPA FACE AT THE WINDO W.    145 eldest brother, his wife, and two relatives of the last-named, Clara did not repel him or disgust the best people of Roxbury by indiscreet raptures over, or exhibition of, her prize.  "I feel with you an invincible repugnance to throwing open our hearts to the inspection of .the unsympathizing world, at the most sacred moment of our lives," she said, in stating her preference for a qutiet morning-wedding, a family breakfast, and instant departure upon their bridal-trip. "If I be- gin to invite my friends and neighbors, our cottage -,lawn and garden included-would not? contain them, and after all were asked whom I could remem- ber, as many more would be mortally offended at being forgotten." The bridegroom gladly acquiescing, with a com- pliment to her womanly delicacy, the ceremony was performed in the presence of the bride's nearest rel- atives; an elegant repast was served at which the Dorrance plate made an imposing show, and Clara turned her back upon the scenes and reminiscences of her past life to commence the world anew.  Yes, she had done very well for herself   how wonderfully well she knew better than did any one else, and at this date she had fresh cause for' self- gratulation. Througll her, Herbert, her favorite bro- ther, was likely to form an alliance which would be a timely and  substantial stepping-stone to his ag-    "6    THE FA CE A T THE WID O W:. grandizement and wealth. There were more reasons why she should hold her head higher--why the blood should clothe her cheek with a richer carmine, and a smile encircle, the mouth, as one swift glance took in the spacious, luxurious room, thronged with well- dressed aristocrats, her husband the stateliest, most honored of them all, yet her fond thrall; the splen- did apparel in which his wealth had bedecked her, the queen of the scene - more reasons, I say, for the ineffable thrill of pleasure that coursed, a rapid, in- toxicating stream, through her veins, than grateful affection for the author of all these goods. With a Sybarite's dread of pain and loneliness, she seldom trusted herself to look at the dark curtain in the background, against which her latter-day glories shone the more dazzlingly. But to-night she felt safe upon her throne - sat, the lady of kingdoms, sultana in the realm of her spouse's heart and in his domain, and could stare full upon the past-could measure, without shuddering, the height of her actual and as- sumed estate above- Mr. Aylett stepped forward in haste and concern at the deadly pallor that overspread her face-the look of horror, fear, loathing, before which smile and brightness fled, blasted into wretchedness. The revel- lers stopped in their giddy measure at the discordant jangle, preluding a dead silence. Mabel, chancing in the evolutions of the set to be       .4   'EE PACE AT THE EWINDOW      147 nearest the window, and noting the direction of the fainting woman's eyes, was quick enough to see a shadow flit across the yellow square of light upon the snowy floor of the portico -a man's shape, as it ap-  peared to her, crouching and slinking out of view into the darkness.     -  "She saw   something,- or somebody, through the window, and was frightened," she said; in a low voice, checking Tom Barksdale and another gentleman, who would have pressed with the inconsiderate crowd toward the senseless figure Mr. Aylett had laid upon the sofa.  "Will you see what it was? ' The request cleared the room directly of all the men of -the assembly, with the exception of Winston and Dr. Ritchie, a young physician, who was superintend- ing the administration of restoratives to Mrs. Aylett. She was reviving  rapidly when the search party gave in their report. There were fresh tracks upon the piazza, and these they had traced to the back of the house, losing them there in the drifting snow, the wind blowing like a  hurricane, and ploughing what had fallen and, what was descending into constantly changing heaps. But the watch-dogs had been un- chained, and four of the negro men detailed as senti- nels, the gentlemen engaging to make the round of the premises again before bed-time.             1 The effect of this communication was the reverse of tranquillizing upon the patient.

It may have been a human face- it may have been the shadow of the cur- tains, or the reflection of the lights upon the glass; but it startled me, appearing so abruptly. Please say no more about it. If it was a living creature, it must have been one of the servants, tempted by curiosity to peep at the dancers." ' It will prove to be a costly indulgence to him, if I can discover who the rascal was"' said Mr. Avlett, de- cisively. "I would not have had you so startled for the worth of all the lazy hounds on the premises." His wife laid her hand upon'his. "It is Christmas night, my love, and the poor fellow is excusable. He showed excellent taste. It was a very pretty scene. I shall not soon forgive myself for throwing it into such ' admired disorder.' Miss Scott "-   THE Fae aCE T A  T ll W1D0    149 [to a musical spinster]--c may I tax your politeness so far as to ask you to take my seat at the piano?

I shall be encouraged to re- turn wjien I hear the music." Her collected, urbane self-once more, she took her husband's arm, and passed through the opening ranks of her friends, bowing to this side and that, with apologetic banter and graceful words of regret-still very pale, but changed in no other respect. "A singular episode in an evening's entertainment," said Mr. Dorrance, leading Mabel to her stand in the re-forming set. "I never knew Clara to succumb be- fore to any type of syncope or asphyxia. She is a woman of remarkable nerve and courage. And, by the way, how preposterous is the common use of the word 'nervous.' The ablest lexicographers define it as 'strong, well-strung, full of nerve,' whereas, in ordi- nary parlance, it has come to signify the very opposite of these. When I speak of a nervous speaker or writer, for example, wh t do I mean?" "One who imbibes unwholesomely large quantities of strong green tea, and sees hobgoblins peering at her through, the window-panes!" said Rosa, sarcastically artless, tripping by in season to overhear this clause of his small-talkl.    150    TEEH ACEAT TME WINDOW. Mabel's imperturbable good-breeding prevented em- barrassment or resentment at the interruption. At heart, she was vexed that Rosa should omit no oppor- tunity of shooting privily and audaciously at her prac- tical admirer, but to betray her appreciation of the im- pertinence would be to subject herself to imputations of sensitiveness on his account "I saw the hobgoblin without the aid of green tea," she rejoined. "There was really some one upon the porch, but why the apparition should scare Clara out of her wits, I cannot divine. The negro is an incura- ble Paul Pry, and, next to dancing a Christmas jig himnself, is the pleasure of seeing pthers do it."- Irs. Aylett verified her brother's encomium upon her nerve by reappearing in the saloon by the time another set was over, and just before the announce- ment of supper, radiant and self-possessed, prepared to do double social duty to atone for the fright she had caused, and the temporary damp her swoon- had cast over the festivities. The revel went joyously forward Christmas-games and incantations, the dexterous introduction, by a jo- cose old gentleman, of a mistletoe-bough into the fes- toons draping the chandelier, and divers other tricks, all of which were taken in excellent part by the vic- tims thereof, and vociferously applauded by the spectators. The great hall-clock had rung out twelve strokes, and two or three methodical seniors were be- Q  *  .  ' I  '    *  , '  ,  .  i  .   THE FA CE AT THE WINDOW     151 ginning to whisper to one another their intention to take French leave of the indefatigable juniors and eek their couches, when a confused tumult arose from the yard-barking and shouts, and voices in angry or eager dispute. Unmindful of the nipping air, the ladies flew to the E windows and raised them, while the gentlemen, in a body, rushed out upon the porch, many to the lawn- - )the scene of the disturbance. "They have caught him!" "There are several of them-a gang of thieves, no  doubt'!" "No! Iseebutone! They are bringing him to the house!" were morsels of information passed over the shoulders of the foremost rank of inquisitive fair ones to the rear, but none were able to answer the returning inquiries. "Who is it" " "What does he look like?" - "Does he offer any resistance?" : "Do you suppose he is a burglar, or only a common vagrant?" "I'thought the Ridgeley grounds were never infested by prowling beggars, or other vagabonds," said a lady to Mrs. Aylett, who prudently remained near the fire, even then shivering with the cold, and casting uneasy looks at the windows. "* r. Aylett is a model to his brother magistrates in   152    THZE FaE AAT T  W1Y/JO W. his treatment of such nuisances," remarked another. '"His name is a, terror to strollers, whether they'be organ-grinders, pedlers, or incendiaries." Mrs. Aylett, excessively pale, applied her vinaigrette to her nose, and trembled yet more violently. "I believe he is very strict," she assented. '; But I am really afraid those ladies will take cold! The snow-air is piercing. And they are - most of them - heated with dancing. Cannot we prevail upon them to close the windows, now that the mysterious prowler is secured . We shall hear all about him when the gentlemen return, and they will not stay out of doors longer than is necessary.)  They began to pour back into the room, while she was speaking, laughing, and talking, all together, shaking the snow-powder from their hair and hands, and anathematizing the cold and their thin boots. The particulars of the midnight disturbance were quickly disseminated. The ebon sentinels had, di- rected by the barking of their canine associates, dis- covered, munder a holly hedge on one side of the yard, a man lying upon the earth, and almost buried in the snow he seemed not to h ve strength to throw off. He was either drunk or so nearly frozen as to be incapable of answering coherently their demands as to what was -his name (and what his business upon the premises. The interrogations of the gentlemen and the ungentle shakings administered by his captors elicited nothing \                ;, l .   ITHE FACE AT TIE leeWINDO W.   153 but groans and muttered oaths. Hie could not, or would not, walk without support, and to leave him where! he was, or to turn him adrift into the public road, would be certain death. Therefore Mr. Aylett had ordered him to be confined for the night in a garret room. In the morning he might be examined to more purpose. "But he ought to have a fire, and something hot and nourishing 'to drink!" exclaimed Mrs. Sutton, upon hearing the story. "' He will freeze in that barn of a place-- poor -wretch!" "I imagine he has no need of additional stimulants," said Mrs. Aylett, dryly, again resorting to her smelling- bottle. "From what the gentlemen say, I judge that he had laid in a sipply of caloric sufficient to last through the night. And the first use he would make of fire would be to burn the house over our heads. His lodgings are certainly more comfortable than those selected by himself.  There is little danger of his finding fault with them. What manner of looking creature is be?" "An unkempt vagabond!" rejoined Randolph Har- rison, rubbing his blue fingers before the fire. "His clothes are ragged, and frozen stiff. I suppose he has been out in the storm ever since it set in. There were icicles upon his beard and hair, his hat having fallen off. It is a  miracle he did not freeze to death long ago.   It is a bitter night."  ! ?,        ,   154     RS PACrE AT THE  IDO W. "Did you say he was an old mane" inquired the hostess languidly, from the depths of her easy chair. "He is not a young one, for his hair is grizzled. But we will form ourselves into a court of inquiry in the morning, with Mr. Aylett as presiding officer - have in the nocturnal wanderer, and hear what ac- count he can give of himself. Who knows what ro- mantic history we may hear- one'that may become a Christmas legend in after years " "You will get nothing more sensational than the confessions of a hen-roost robber, I suspect," said Mrs. Aylett, more wearily than was consistent with her rdle of attentive hostess. Her husband noticed the tokens of exhaustion, and interposed to spare her further exertion. a Our friends will excuse you if you retire without delay, Clara. You still feel the'effects of your agita- tion and faintness." This was the signal for a general dispersion of the ladies-the gentlemen, or most of them, adjourning to the smoking-room. Since the late extraordinary influx of visitors, Mabel had shared her aunt's chamber, but, instead of seeking this now, she went stright from the parlor to the sup- per-room, where she found, as she had expected, Mrs. Sutton in the height of business, directing the setting of the breakfast-table, clearing away the debris of the evening feast, and counting the silver with unusual   THE .AFACE A T .7t s WIND O W. 15' care, lest a stray fork or spoon had, by some hocus- pocus known to the class, been slipped into the pocket of the supposititious burglar. "Aunt," began Mabel, drawing her aside, that poor wretch up-stairs must be cared for. It is the height of cruelty to lock him up in a fireless roonl, without provisions or dry clothing. If he should die, would we be guiltless?" Mrs. Sutton's benevolent physiognomy was per- plexed. "Didn't I say as much in the other room, before everybody, my dear? And didn't she put me down with one of her magisterial sentences-. She is mistress here-not you or I. Besides, Winston has the key of that east garret in his pocket, and I would not be the one to ask him for it, since he has had his wife's opin- ion upon the subject of humanity to prisoners." "I shall not trouble him with my petition. I dis- covered by accident, when I was a child, that the key of the north room would open that door. If I order, upon my own responsibility, that a cup of hot coffee, and some bread and meat be taken up to him, yo not deny them to me, I suppose "  ' Certainly not, my child! but I dare not se a servant with them.  Winston's orders were positive-- they all tell me--that not a soul should attempt to hold communication with him.  And what he' fays he . means."    '  J4   15.6    THE FA CE A T THB WINDOW. "Then," replied Winston's sister, with a spark of his spirit, "I will take the waiter up myself. I cannot sleep with this horror hanging over me- the fear lest, through my neglect or cowardice, a fellow-being- whose only offence against society, so far as we know, is his dropping down in a faint or stupor under a he ge on the Ridgeley plantation - should lose his life." "Your feelings are only what I should expect f om you, my love; but think twice before, you go up-st irs yourself! It would be considered an outrageous am- propriety, were it found out." "Less -outrageous than to let a stranger perish Ufor want of such attention as one wiwould vouchsafe tp a stray dog " questioned Mabel, with a queer smile. "Roger! pour me out a bowl of coffee at once. Put it on a waiter' with a plate of bread and butter - or stay! oysters will be more warming and nourishing. I am very sure that Daphne is keeping a saucepanful hot for her supper and yours. Hurry!" The waiter, whose wife was the cook, ducked his head with a grin confirmatory of his young mistress' shrewd suspicion, and vanished to obey her orders, never dreaming but she wanted the edibles for her private consumption. He enjoyed late and hot sup- pers, and why not lshe? Thanks to this persuasion, the coffee was strong, i clear, and boiling, the oysters done to a turn, and smoking from the saucepan. Taking the tray from him, with a gracious "Thank l .e         'fth a g OUS   THEE RPACE AT THE W'INDOW:     157 W you'! This is just as it should be," Mabel negatived his offer to carry it to her room, and started up-stairs. Mrs. Sutton followed with a lighted candle. "Winston or no Winston, you shall not face that desperado alone," she said, obstinately. "There is no   : telling what he may do--murder you, perhaps, or at least knock you down in order to escape. Winston talks as if he were the captain of the forty thieves."   I "He is pretty well hors de combat how, at any rate,"   j smiled Mabel, but allowing her aunt to precede her with the light to the upper floor. "And should he offer violence-scalding  coffee may defend me as effectually as Morgiana's boiling oil routed the gang. My captain had to be carried up-stairs by four servants, who left him upon a pile of old mattresses in one cor- ner of the room.  Here we are!"  They were in a .wide hall at the top of the house, the  unceiled rafters above their heads, carpetless boards beneath their feet. Mabel set her waiter upon I worm-eaten, iron-bound  chest, and went further lown the passage to get the key of the north room. ier light footstep stirred dismal echoes in the dark orners; the wind screamed through every crack and :eyhole, like a legion of piping devils; rumbled lugu- riouslyv over the steep roof. The one candle flickering i the draught showed Mabel's white bust and arms, ke those of a  phantom, beaming through a cloud of  -     ,  ' Kr"/l   158  .  b1 FACE AT I'lz' WINDOW:.^ blackness, when she stooped to try the key in the lock  of the prison-chamber. After fitting it, she knocked before she turned it in :the rusty wards -again, and more loudly - then spoke, putting her lips close to the key-hole: "We are friends, and have brought you supper. -Can we come      in"  There was no answer, and with a beating heart she unlocked the door, pushed it ajar, and motioned to Aunt Rachel to hold her candle up, that she might gain a view of the interior.- The wan, uncertain rays revealed the-heap of mat- tresses, and upon them what looked like a mass of rough, wet clothing, without sound or motion. "He is pretending to be asleep! Take care!" whis- pered Mrs. Sutton, trying to restrain Mabel as she pressed by her into the room. "He is dead, I fear!" was the low answer. Forgetful of her nephew's prohibition and her recent fears, the good widow entered, and leaned anxiously over the stranger's form. A tall, gaunt man, clad in threadbare garments, which hung loosely upon the shrunken breast and arms, black hair and beard, mot- tled with white, ragged, and unshorn, and dank from exposure to the snow and slede; a chalky-whiteface, with closed and sunken eyes, sharpened nose, and promi- nent cheek-bones--this was what they beheld as the candle flamed up steadily in the comparatively still   -2.PW F ACE AT MJ:a' WlAJOW.    159 air of the ceiled apartment. The miserable coat was buttoned up to, his chin, and the shreds of a coarse woollen comforter, torn from his throat at his capture, still hung about his shoulders. His clothes were sod- den with wet, as Harrison had said, and the solitary pretence at rendering him comfortable for the night, had been the act of a negro, who contemptuously flung an old blanket across his nether limbs before leaving him to his lethargic slumbers. He had- not moved since they tossed him, like a worthless sack, upon this sorry resting-place, but lay an unsightly huddle of arms, legs, and head, such aswas never achieved, much less continued, by any one save a drunken man or a corpse. Mabel ended the awed silence. "This is torpor -not sleep, nor yet death," she said, without recoiling from the pitiful wreck. ' Indeed, as she spoke, she bent to feel his pulse; held the emaciated wrist in her warm fingers until she could determine whether the feeble stroke were a reality, or a trick of the imagination. "Dr. Ritchie should see him immediately. : He is in the smoking-room.  If you call him out, it will excite less remark than if I were to do it. Don't let Winston guess why you want him," were her directions to her aunt, uttered quickly, but distinctly. "You will not stay here! At least, go into the hall I What will the doctor think  "       ; "I shall remain where I  am. The poor creature -is   :160    Ists' ,PiA OE AT THE WlaNDO.  too far gone to presume upon my condescension," with a faint -sarcastic emphasis. At Mrs. Sutton's return with the physiciap, she per- ceived that her niece had not awaited her coming in sentimental idleness. A thick woollen coverlet was wrapped about the prostrate figure, and Mabel, upon her knees on the dusty hearth,was applying the candle to a heap of waste -paper andbits of board she had ferreted out in closets and cuddyaholes. It caught and blazed up hurriedly in season to facilitate the doctor's examination of the patient, thrown so oddly upon his care. Mrs. Sutton had not neglected, in her haste, to procure a warm shawl from her room, and she folded it about the girl's shoulders, whispering an entreaty that she would go to bed, and leave the man to her management and Dr. Ritchie. lMabel waved her off impatiently. "Presently! when I hear how he is!" moving toward the comfortless couch. The physician looked: around at the rustle of her dress, his pleasant face perturbed, and perhaps re- morseful.                  i "This is a bad business I I wish I had examined him when he was brought in. There would have been more hope of doing something for him then." But, to tell the truth, I was one of the five or six prudent fel- lows who stayed upon the piazza, and witnessed the capture from a distance. I had, no idea of the man's   THE FACE, AT THE WINDO W. 1I real situation. Mrs. Sutton! can I have brandy, hot water, and mustard at once  Miss Mabel! may I trouble you to call your brother? He ought to be advised of this unforeseen turn of affairs," His emissaries were prompt. In less than ten min- utes, all the appliances the household could fmrnish for the restoration of the failing life were at his command. An immense fire roared in the long-disused chimney; warm blankets, bottles of hot water and mustard-poul- tices were prepared by a corps of officious:servants; the master of the mansion, with three or four friends at his heels, and a half-smoked cigar in his hand, had looked in for a moment, to hope that Dr. Ritchie would not hesitate to order whatever was needed, and to predict a favorable result as the meed of his skill. Half an hour after her brother's visit, Mabel tapped at the door to inquire how the patient was, and whether she could be of use in any way. She still wore her evening dress, and the fire of excitement had not gone out in her eyes and complexion. "Don't sit up longer," said the doctor, with the authority of an old friend. "It will not benefit your 2rotegd for you to have a headache, pale cheeks, and heavy eyes to-morrow, while it will render others, whose claims upon you are stronger, very miserable." She thanked him laconically for his thoughtfulness, and bade him  "good-night," without a responsive gleam of playfulness. Her heart was weighed down   162    --THE FAaE AT THE WINDOW. vith sick horror. The almost certainty of which he spoke with professional coolness, was to her, who had never within her recollection stood beside a death-bed, a thing too frightful to be anticipated without dread, however its terrors might be alleviated by affection and wealth. As theJyiale of their Christmas frolic - perhaps the consequence- of wilful neglect in those who should have known better than to abandon the wanderer to the ravages of hunger, cold, and intoxica- tion - the idea was ghastly beyond description. She was about to diverge from the main hall on the second floor into the lateral passage leading to Mrs. Sutton's room in the wing, when her name was called' fin a gentle, guarded key by her sister-in-law.   -OHaP'IAE IX.

And Emmeline has been telling me that Mrs. Sutton actually let you go up into that Arctic room." "It was my choice. Aunt Rachel went along to carry the light and to keep me company. She would have dissuaded me from the enterprise if she could," responded Mabel, sinking into the low, cushioned chair before the fire, which the mistress of the luxurious apartment had just wheeled forward for her, and con- fessing to herself, for the first time, that she was chilly and very tired. "But where were the servants, my dear?

They are slender and long, and his features in youth and health must have been handsome. Dr. Ritchie thought the same. Who can tell that his wife is not mourning his absence to-night, as the fondest woman under this roof would regret her husband's disappearance? And she may never learn when and how he died--never visit his grave!" "I have lived in this wicked world longer than you have, my sweet Mabel; so you must not quarrel with me if these fancy pictures do not move me as they do your guileless heart,' said Mrs. Aylett, the sinister shadow of a mocking smile playing about her mouth. "Nor must you be offended with me for suggesting as a pen- dant to your crayon sketch of widowhood and desola- tion the probability that the decease of a drunken thief or beggar cannot be a serious bereavement, even to his nearest of kin.

"XMammy is to relieve him so soon as he is con- vinced that human skill can do nothing for his relief,'" said Mabel very gravely. Her sister-in-law's high spirits and, jocular tone jarred upon her most disagreeably, but she tried to bear in mind in what dissimilar circumstances they had passed the last hour. If Clara appeared unfeeling, and her remarks were distinguished by less taste than was customary in one so thoroughly bred, it was be- cause the exhilaration of the evening was yet upon her, and she had not seen the death's-head prone up- on the pillows in the cheerless attic. Thoughts of pov- erty and dying beds were unseemly in this apartment' when the very warmth and fragrance of the air told of fostering and sheltering love. The heavy curtains did not sway in the blast that hurled its whole fury against the windows; the furniture was handsome, and in per- fect harmony with the dark, yet glowing hues of the   168   HE DEPARTETH IN DsAR   CSS. carpet, and with the tinted walls. A tall dressing- mirror let into a recess reflected the picture, brilliant with firelight that colored the shadows themselves; lengthened into a deep perspective the apparent ex- tent of the chamber and showed, like a fine old paint- ing, the central figure in the vista. Mrs. Aylett had exchanged her evening dress for a cashmere wrapper, the dark-blue ground of which was enlivened by a Grecian pattern of gold and scarlet; her unbound hair draped her shoulders, and framed her arch face, as she threaded the bronze ripples with her fingers. She looked contented, restful, compla- cent in herself and her belongings - one whom Time had touched lovingly as he swept by, and whom sor- row had forgotten. "Not asleep yet!" was her husband's' exclamation, entering before anything further passed between the two women; and when his sister started up, with an apology for being found there at so late an hour, he added, more reproachfully than he ever spoke to his wife, "You should not have kept her up, MaLel! Her strength has been too much taxed already to-night. I hoped and believed that she ha been in bed and asleep for an hour." "Don't blame her!" said Mrs. Aylett, hastily. "I called her in as she was proceeding to bed in the most decorous manner possible. I may as well own the truth of my weakness. I was, nervously wakeful - the   !   .

"And what is the latest morceau " inquired Mr. Aylett, indulgently, when Mabel had gone. He was standing by his-wife's chair, and she leaned her head against him, her bright eyes uplifted. to his, her hair falling in a long, burnished fringe over his arm-a fond, sparkling siren, whom no man, with living blood in his veins, could help stooping to kiss before her lips had shaped a reply. "You wouldn't think it an appetizing morsel! But I listened with interest to our unsophisticated Mabel's account of her Quixotic expedition to what will, I fore- see, be the haunted chamber of Ridgeley in the next generation.

Mabel showed even less than her usual discretio in detailing the incidents of her ad- venture to you."  Flattery of his sister had never been a failing with him, but, since his marriage, the occasions were miani- fold in which her inferiority to his wife was so glaring as to elicit a verbal expression of disapproval. It was remarkable that Clara's advocacy of Mabel's cause, at these times, so frequently failed to alter his purpose of censure or to mitigate it, sincen all other respects, her influence over him was more firmly established each day and hour. Old Phillis, Mabel's nurse and the doctress of the plantation--albeit a less zealous devotee than her master had intimated of the potent beverages left within her reach, ostensibly for the use of her patient, should he revive sufficiently to swallow a few drops- was yet too drowsy from the fatigues of the day, sun- dry cups of Christmas egg-nogg, and the obesity of age, to maintain alert vigil over one sheA in common 369    HE DEPARTETH IN DARKNESS.     171 with her fellow-servitors, scorned as an aggravated specimen of the always and ever-to-be despicable gk- Inus, "poor white folks." There was next to nothing for her to do when the fire had been replenished, the bottles of hot water renewed at the feet and heart, and fresh mustard draughts wound about the almost pulse- less limbs of the dying stranger. She did contrive to keep Somnus at arm's length-for a while longer, by a minute examination of his upper clothing, which, by Dr. Ritchie's directions, had been removed, that the remedies might be more conveniently applied, aind the heated blankets the sooner infuse a vital glow through the storm-beaten frame. The ancient crone:took them up with the tips of her fingers - ragged coat, yest, and pantaloons - rummaged in the same contemptuous fashion every pocket, and kicked over the worn, soaked boots with the toe of her leather brogan, sniff- ing her disappointment at the worthlessness of the habiliments and the result of her search.  "Fit fur nothin' but to bury his poor carcuss in!"  i she grunted, and had recourse to her own plethoric pocket for' a clay pipe and a bag of tobacco. This lighted by a coal from the hearth, she tied a second handkerchief over that she wore, turban-wise, on her head, mumbling something about " cold ears " and' ' rheumatiz; " settled herself in a rush-bottomed chair, put her feet upon the rounds of another, and was -reg-   L72 E\ BE DI3PARTET-I] DAOR  ESS.  llarly on duty, prepared for any emergency, and to be Ilarmed at nothing that might occur. So strict was the discipline she established over her- self in fifteen minutes, that she did not stir at the creaking of the bolt, or the shriller warning of the un- oiled hinges, as the door moved cautiously back, and a cloaked form became dimly visible in the opening. A survey of athe inside of the chamber, the unmoving nurse and her senseless charge, with the fumes of brandy and tobacco, reassured the visitant. Her stock- ingless feet were thrust into wadded slippers; over her white night-dress was a dark-blue wrapper, and, in ad- dition to this protection against the cold, she was en- veloped in a great shawl, disposed like a cowl about her head. Without rustle or incautious mis-step she gained the side of the improvised bed, and leaned over it. The face of the occupant was turned slightly tow- ard the left shoulder, and away from the light. The apparition raised herself, with agesture of impatience, caught the candle from the rickety tables at the head of the mattress, snuffed it hurriedly, and again stooped v toward the recumbent figure, with it in her hand. ' It was then that the vigilant watcher unclosed her flabby lids, slowly, and without start or exclamation, much as a dozing cat blinks when a redder sparkle from the fire dazzles her out of dreams. One hard wink, one bewildered stare, and Phillis was awake and wary. Her chin sank yet lower upon her chest, but   tE DEPARTETH IN DARKNES8      173  the blackl eyes were rolled upward until they bore directly upon the strange tableau. The shawl had dropped from the lady's head, and the candle shone broadly upon her features, as upon the sick man's pro- i file. Apparently dissatisfied with this view, she slip- ped her disengaged hand under the cheek which was downward, and drew his face around into full sight. "And bless your soul, honey!" Aunt Phillis told her young mistress, long afterward, "you never see sech a look as was on hern- while her eyes-was that bright and big, they was jist like live coals sot in a lump of dough- she growed so white"          Nevertheless the spy could return the candle to its place upon the table without perceptible tremor of lip or limb, and after bestowing one scrutinizing glance upon the nurse, who was fast asleep beneath it, she went to the heap of damp clothing. These she lifted -one by one -less gingerly than Phillis had done, and ransacked every likely hiding-place of papers or- valuables, goin  through the operation wi th a rapid dexterity that astounded the old woman's weak mind, and made her ashamed of her own clumsiness. An-  ticipating the final stealthy look in her direction, the heavy lids fells once again, and were not raised until the rusty bolt passed gratingly into the socket, and she  felt that the place was deserted by all save herself and i the dying stroller. She was in no danger of dozing upon her post after ,i.   174   SEDP   TESTfI INf DARKNESS this visitation. For the few hours of darkness that yet remained, she sat in her chair, her elbows upon her knees, smoking, and pondering upon what she had witnessed, varying her occupations by feeding the fire and such care of the patient as she considered advisa- ble ; likening, in her rude, yet excitable imagination, the rumbling of the gale in the -chimney and across the roof-tree, to the roll of the chariot-wheels which were to carry away the parting soul; the tap and rat- tle of sleet and wind at the windows to the sumrmons of demons, impatient at Death's delay. "The Lord send him an easy death, and let him go lp, instead of down!" she groaned aloud, once. But the dubious shake of the head accompanying ,the benevolent petition betokened her disbelief in the possibility of a favorable reply. In her articles of faith it was only by a miracle that a " no-account white mnan, picked up out of the highway, and whose pock- ets were barren as were those she had examined, could get an impetus in that direction. The stormy dawn was revealing, with dreary dis- tinctness, the shabby disorder of the lumber-room, when Dr. Ritchie appeared in his dressing-gown, rubbing his eyes, and yawning audibly. ,Gone-- hey?"  was his comment upon the ne- gress' movements. She had bound a strip of linen about thelank jaws; combed back the grizzled hair from the forehead into   YzE DEPARTEZTH r  DARKNESS   175 sleek respectability; crossed the hands at the wrists, as only dead, hands are ever laid; straightened the limbs, and was in the act of spreading a clean sheet over her finished work.        - "Nigh upon an hour since, sir,' she responded, respectfully. "He did not revive at all after I left him V" "Not a breath or a motion, sir. He went off at the last jist as easy as a lamb. Never tried to, say nothin', nor opened his eyes after you went down.

Well! I'll go back to bed now, and finish my morning tap." He was at the threshold when he bethought himself of a final injunction. "You had better keep an eye upon these thing, Aunty!" pointing to the coat and other garments she had ranged upon chairs to dry in front of the fire. "There will be a coroner's inquest, I suppose, and there may be papers in his pockets which will tell who he was and where he belonged. When you are through in here, lock the door and take out the key--and if you. can help it, don't let a whisper of this get abroad before breakfast. It will spoil the ladies' appetites. If anybody asks how he is, say 'a little better.' He can't be worse off than he was in life, let him be where he may."     \ "Yes, sir," answered Phillis, in meek obedience "But I don't think 'he was the kind his folks would care to keep track on, nor the sort that carries valeyble papers 'round with 'em." "I reckon you are -not far out of the way there " laughed the doctor, subduedly, lest the echo in the empty hall might reach the sleepers on the second floor, and he ran lightly down the garret steps. The inquest' sat that afternoon. It was a leisure season with planters, and a jury was easilfcollected by special messengers - twelve jolly neighbors, who were   BE DEPARTm'ffI IX DA RKNESEL    1" not averse to the prospect of- a glass of Mrs. Sutton's  famous egg-nogg, and a social smoke around the fire in the great dining-room, even though these were pre- faced by ten minutes' solemn discussion over the re- mains of the nameless wayfarer.  IIis shift was marked with some illegible characters, J done in faded ink, which four of the jury spelled out as "James Knowlton," three others made up into "Jonas Lamson," and the remaining five declined de-. ciphering at all. Upon one sock were the letters "R. M.," upon the fellow," G. B." With these unavailable exceptions, there was literally no clue to his name, pro- fession, or residence, to be gathered from his person or apparel. The intelligent jury brought in a unanimous verdict - "Name unknown. Died from the effects of drink and exposure;" the foreman pulled the sheet again over the blank, chalky face, and the shivering  dozen wound their way to the warmer regions, where the expected confection awaited them. , Their decorous carousal was at its height, and the ladies, one and all, had sought their respective rooms   to recuperate their wearied energies by a loll, if not a siesta, that they might be in trim for the evening's  enjoyment (Christmas lasted a whole eek at Ridge-    i ley) when four strapping field hand sharefooted,  that their-tramp might not break the epicurean slum.  bers, brought down from the desolate upper chamber X rough pine coffin, manufactured and screwed tight   178    BE DEPARTETH IN DARRWESS by the plantation carpenter, and after halting a minute in the back porch to pull on their boots, took their way across the lawn and fields to the servants' burial-place. This- was in a pine grove, two furlongs or more from the garden fehnce, forming the lower enclosure of the Mransion grounds. The intervening dell was knee-deep in drifted snow, the hillside bare in spots, and ridged high in others, where the wind-currents had swirled from base to summit. The passage was a toilsome one, and the stalwart bearers halted several times to shift their light burden before they laid it down upon the mound of mixed snow and red clay at the mouth of the grave. Nalf-a-dozen others were waiting there to assist in the interment, and at the head of the pit stood a white-headed negro, shaking with palsy and cold -the colored chaplain of the region, who, more out of custom and superstition than a sense of religious responsibility least of all motives, through respect for the dead--had'br ved the inclement weather to say a prayer over the wanderer's last home. The storm had abated at noon, and the snow no lon- ger fell, but there had been no sunshine through all the gloomy day, and the clouds were now mustering thickly again to battle, while the rising gale in the pine-tops was hoarse and wrathful. Far as the eye could reach were untrodden fields of snow; gently-roll- ing ills, studded with shrubs and tinged in patches by russet bristles of broom-straw; the river swollen into   HE DEPARTETH IN DARKNS.

To the. right of the spectator, who stood on, the emi- nence occupied by the cemetery, lay Ridgeley, with its environing outhouses, crowning the most Ambitious height of the chain, the smoke from its chimneys and those of the village of cabins beating laboriously up- ward, to be borne down at last by the lowering mass of chilled vapor. The coffin was deposited in its place -with scant show of reverence, and without removing their hats, the by- standers leaned on their spades, and looked to the preacher for the ceremony that was to authorize them to hurry through with their distasteful task. That the gloom of the hour and scene, and the utter forlornness of all the accompaniments of what was meant for Christian burial, had stamped themselves upon the mind and heart of the unlettered slave, was evident from the, brief sentences he quavered out - joining his withered hands and raising his bleared eyes toward the threatening heavens: J "Lord! what is man, that thou art mindful of him?

The dead know not anything, for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy is now perished, neither have they a portion for- ever in anything that is done under the sun. "Lord! teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. Oh, spare me, that I may recover strength, ere I go hence and be no more I "In the name of the FATHER SON, and HOLY GHOST -dust to dust, and ashes to ashes I Amen!" "By the way, Mr. Aylett, the poor wretch upstairs should be buried at the expense of the county," re- marked, the coroner, before taking leave of Ridgeley and the egg-nogg bowl. "I will take the poor-house on my way home, and tell the overseer td send a coffin and a cart over in the morning. You don't care to have the corpse in the house longer than necessary, I take it? The sooner he is in the Potter's Field, the ;more agreeable for you and everybody else." Mr. Aylett pointed through the back window at the winding path across the fields. A short line of black dots was seen coming along it, in the direction of the house. As they neared it they were discovered to be-men, each with a hoe or shovel upon his shoulder. "The deed i done!" said the master, smiling. "My ood fellows there have spared the county the expense,   HE DEPARTETH IfN DARKNES&S     181 and the overseer the trouble of this little matter. As for the Potter's Field, a place in my servants' burying- ground is quite as respectable, and more convenient in this weather." The jurors were grouped about the fire in the baro- nial hall, buttoning up overcoats and splatterdashes, and drawing on their riding-gloves, all having come on horseback. In the midst of the general bepraisement of their host's gentlemanly and liberal conduct, Mrs. Aylett swam down the staircase, resplendent in silver- gray satin, pearl necklace and bracelets, orange flowers and camelias in her hair-semi-bridal attire, that be- came her as nothing else ever had done. "My dear madam," said the foreman of the inquest --a courtly disciple of the old school of manner, and phraseology- as the august body of freeholders parted to either side to leave her a passage-way to the fire- place-" your husband is a happy man, and his wife should be a happy woman in having won the affection of such a model of chivalry"-stating succinctly the latQ proof the " model " had offered to an admiring world of his chivalric principles.  The delicate hand stole to its resting-place upon her lords arm, as the lady answered, her ingenuous eyes suffused with the emotion that gave but the more sweetness to her smile, ' I am a happy woman, Mr. Nelson! I think there   182   ' s DEPARTETH IN DA RINESN is not a prouder or more blessed wife in all the land than Ii am this evening.'  Laugh, jest, and dance ruled the fleeting hours in tile halls of the old country-house that night, and the pre- siding genius of the revel was still the beautiful -hostess:-never more beautiful, neveri so, winning be- fore. No one noticed that, by her orders, or her hus- band's, the window through which she had beheld the goblin visage was closely curtained. Or, this may have been ,an accidental disposition of the drapery, since no trace of her momentary alarm remaine, in her countenance or demeanor.        j In the kitchen a double allowance of toddy was served out, by their master's orders, to the men iwho had taken part in the interment on the hill-top. End, in their noisy talk over their potations the vagrant was scarcely mentioned.             t Only the pines, hoarser in their sough, by reason of the failing snow that clogged their boughs, chanted a requiem above the rough hillock at their feet.

All the per- sons composing it were well dressed, and had the car- riage of people of means and breeding. Beyond this there was nothing noteworthy about any of them, ex- cepting the youngest of the three ladies of what seemed to be a family group. When they stopped for consul- tation upon their plans for this, their first evening in the capital, directly beneath the central chandelier of the largest drawing-room, she stood, unintentionally; perhaps, upon the outside of the little circle, and not exerting herself to feign interest in the parley, sought amusement in a keen, but polite survey of the assem- bly, apparently in no wisq disconcerted at the volley of glances she encountered in return. .', ., (,188) .  .   1'84         ROSAd.  If she were always in the same looks she wore just now, she must have been pretty well inured to batteries )f admiration by this date in her sunny life. She was below the medium of woman's s  ature, round and pli- mnt in form and limbs; in complexion dark as a gypsy, but with a clear skin that let the rise and fall of the  blood beneath be marked as distinctly as in that of the fairest blonde. 'Her eyes were brown or black, it was  hard to say which, so changeful were their lights-and shades; and her other features, however unclassic in mould, if criticised separately, taken as a whole, formed i picture of surpassing fascination. If her eyes and fleft chin meant mischief, her mouth engaged to makewe nnends by smiles and seductive words, more sweet than honey, because their flavor would never clog upon hipm -who tasted thereof.

But instead of detracting from the charm of her appearance, the seemingly unconscious gesture 6nly heightened it. It was the overflow of the exuberant vitality that throbbed redly in her cheeks, flashed in her eye, and made buoyant her step. "What an artless sprite it is I" said one old -gentle- man, who had stared at her from the instant of her entrance, in mute enjoyment, to the great amusement, of his more knowing nephews. "All but the artless !" rejoined one of the sophisti- cated youngsters. " She is gotten up too well for that. Ten to one she is an experienced stager, who calculates to a nicety the capabilities of every twist of her silky hair and twinkle of an eyelash. Hallo! that is gush. ing- nicely done, if it isn't almost equal to the gen- uine thing, in fact." The ambiguous compliment was provoked by a change of scene and a- new actor, that opened  other optics than his lazy ones to their extremest extent.  A gentleman had come in alone and quietly-a tall, manly personage, whose serious countenance had just time to soften into a smile of recognition before the black-robed fairy flew up to him-both hands ex.   186         ROSA. tended -her face one glad sunbeam of surprise and :welcome. - "You here!" she exclaimed, in a low, thrilling tone, shedding into his the unclouded rays of her glorious eyes, while one of her hands lingered in his I friendly hold.

The Member's wife was a portly, good-natured Virginia matron, whose ruling desire to make all about her comfortable as herself, sometimes led to contretemps that were trying to the subjects of her kindness, and would have been distressing to her, had she ever, by any chance, guessed what she had done. She opened the social game now, by saying, agree- ably: "Your name is not a strange one to us, Mr. Chilton. We have often heard you spoken of in the most affectionate terms by our friends, but not near neighbors, the Ayletts, of Ridgeley, county. Is it long since you met or heard from them?" "Some months, madam. I hope they were in their usual health when you last saw them?" Receiving her affirmative reply with a courteous bow, and the assurance that he was "happy to hear it," Mr. Chilton turned to Rosa, and engaged her in con- versation upon divers popular topics of the day, all of which she was careful should conduct them in the op- posite direction from Ridgeley, and his affectionate in- timates, the Ayletts.

The slander that had blackened him in the esteem of his betrothed had, he naturally supposed, injured his reputation beyond hope of retrieval with her acquaint. ances. Rosa,her bosom companion, could not but have heard, the whole history, yet met him with undimin- ished cordiality, as a valued friend. Either the Ay- letts had been unnaturally discreet, or the faith of this interesting girl in his integrity was firmer and better worth preserving than he had imagined in the past. Perhaps, too, since he was but mortal man, although one whose heritage in the school of experience had been of the sternest, he was not entirely insensible to the privilege of promenading the long suite of apart- ments with the prettiest girl of the season hanging upon his arm, and granting her undivided attention to all that he said, indifferent to, or unmindful of, the flattering notice she attracted. Over and above all these recommendations to his peculiar regard was her association with the happy days of his earlylove. Not an intonation, not a look of hers, but reminded him of Ridgeley and of Mabel. It Was a perilous indulgence- this recurrence to a dream he had vowed to forget, but the temptation had befallen him suddenly, and he surrendered himself to the intoxication. Yes! she was going to the President's levee that   ROSA.         189 evening, Rosa said. A sort of raree-show-was it not? with the Chief Magistrate for head mountebank. He was worse off in one respect than the poorest cot- tager in the nation he was commonly reported to gov- ern, inasmuch as he had not the right to invite whom he pleased to his house, and when the mob overran his premises he must treat all with equal affability. She pitied his wife I She .would rather, if ithe choice were offered her, be one of the revolving wa dummnnies used in shop-windows for showing the latest style of evening costume and hair-dressing -for the dolls had no wits ? of their own to begin with, and were tot expected to say clever things, as the President's consort was, after she had lost hers in the crush of the aforesaid mob, who eyed her freely as an appendage to their chattel, the man they had bought 'by their votes, and put in the highest seat in the Republic. No! she was not provided with an escort to the White House. She did not know three people in Washington beside her rela- tives, and, looking forward to creeping into the pala- latial East Room at her uncle's back, or in the shadow  of her cousii's'husband, the vision of enjoyment had not been exactly enrapturing--but, her companion's proposal to join their party and help elbow the crowd Iway from her, lent a different coloring to the horizon. But- again --flushing prettily- was he certain :hat the expedition would not bore him? Doubtless, le had had some other engagement in prospect for the *         ,    190          ROSA. evening,- before he stumbled over her. He ought to know her well enough not to disguise his real wishes by gallant phrases. "I have never been otherwise than sincere witf you," Frederic said, honestly; "I had thought of going to a  the levee alone, as a possible method of whiling away an idle evening.- If you will lallow me to accompany you thither, I shall be gratified - shall derive actual pleasure from the motley scene. It will not be the Xonly time you and I have studied varieties of physi- ognomy and character in a mixed assembly.   Do you recollect thee hops at the Rockbridge Alum Springs '  "I do," replied Rosa, laconically and very soberly. He thought she suppressed a sigh in saying it. She was a warm-hearted little creature with all her vagaries, and he was less inclined to reject her unob- trusive sympathy-than if a more sedate or prudent person had proffered it. It was certain he could not have selected a more en- tertaining associate for that evening. She amused him in spite of the painful recollections revived by their intercourse. She did not passunobserved in the dense. crowd that packed the lower floor of the White House. Her face, all glee and sparkle, the varied music of her soft Southern tongue, her becoming attire- were, in turn; the subject of eulogistic comment among the most! distinguished connoisseurs present. It was not   ROSA          191 probable that these should all be unheard by her cava- lier, or that he should listen to them with profound indifference. He was astonished, therefore, when she protested that she had had "enough of it," and proposed that they should extricate themselves from the press and go home. It was contrary to the commonly received tenets of his sex respecting the insatiable nature of feminine vanity, that she should weary so soon of adulation which would have rendered a light head dizzy. Mrs. Mason was not ready to leave the halls of mirth. She had met scores of old friends, and was having a " nice, sociable time " in a corner, while Mrs. Cunningham had "not begun to enjoy herself, looking at the queer people and the superb dresses." Of course, they had no objection to their wilful relative doing as she liked, but did not conceal their amazement at her bad taste. "Take the carriage, dear! You'll find it around, out there somewhere," drawled the easy-tempered aunt. "And let Thomas come back for us. He will be in time an hour from this." "Would sit be an unpardonable infraction of eti- quette if we were to walk home?" questioned Rosa of- Mr. Chilton, when they were out of Mr. Mason's hear- ing. "The night is very mild."

"I left a pair of thick gaiters in the dressing-room, which I woie in the carriage." 9"Then I will be answerable for the breach of eti- quette, should it ever be found out," was the reply, and Rosa disappeared into the tiring-room to equip herself for-the walk. It was a lovely night for December - moonlighted and bland as October, and neither manifested a disposi- tion to accelerate the saunter into which they had fallen at their first step beyond the portico. Rosa dropped hsr rattling tone, and began to talk seriously and sen- sibly of the scene they had left, the flatness of fash- ionable society after the freshness of novelty had passed from it, and her preference for home life and tried friends.     . "Yet I always rate these the more truly after a peep at a different sphere," she said. "Our Old /Virginia country-house is never so dear and fair at any other time as when I return to it after playing at fine lady abroad for a month or six weeks. I used to fret at the monotony of my daily existence; think my simple pleasures tame. I am thankful that I go back to them, as I grow older, as one does to pure, cold water, after drinking strong wine." "You are blessed in having this fountain to which you may resort in your heart-drought," answered Fiederic, sadly. "The gods do not often deny the gift of homne and domestic affections twoman. It is an exception   ROSA          , 193 to a universal rule when a man who has reached thirty without building a nest for himself, has a pleasant shel- ter spared, or offered to him elsewhere." "Yet you would weary, in a week, of the indolent, aimless ife led by most of our youthful heirs expect- ant and apparent," returned Rosa. "I remember once telling you how I envied you for having work and a career. I was youthful then myself - and foolish as immature."            "I recollect!" and there was no more talk for sev- eral squares. Rosa was getting alarmed at the thought of her te- merity in reverting to this incident in their former in- tercourse, and meditating the expediency of entering upon an 'apology, which might, after all, augment, rather than correct the mischief she had done, when Frederic accosted her as if there had been no hiatus in the dialogue. "I recollect!" he repeated, just as before. "It was upon the back piazza at Ridgeley, after breakfast on that warm September morning, when the air was a sil- very haze, and there was no dew upon the roses. I, too, have grown older-I trust, wiser and stronger since I talked so largely of my career - what I hoped to be and to do. When did you see her - Miss Ay- lett," abruptly, and with a total change of manner. "The Rubicon is forded," thought Rosa, compla- cently, the while her compassion for him was sincere 9   194          ROSA. and strong. "He can never shut his -heart inexorably against me after this." Aloud, she .replied after an instant's hesitation, de- signed to prepare him for what was to follow--"I was with Mabel for several days last May. We have not met since," "She is alive- and well " he asked, anxiously. An inexplicable something in her manner warned him that all was not right. "She is--or was, when I last heard news of her; - we do not correspond. She doe? not live at Ridgeley now."         There she stopped, before adding the apex to the nicely graduated climax. "Not live with her brother! - I do not understand." "Have you not heard of her marriage?" "No I " He did not reel or tremble, but she felt that the bolt had, pierced a vital part, and wisely forbore to offer consolation he could not hear. But when he would have parted with, her at the door of her uncle's parlor, she saw how deadly pale he was, and puther hands into his, beseechingly. "Come in! I cannot let you go until -you have said that you forgive me!" There were tears in her eyes, and in her coaxing accents, and he yielded to the gentle face that sought to lead him into the room. It was fearful agony that I   ROSA.          195 contracted his forehead and lips when he would have spoken reassuringly, and they were drops of genuine commiseration that drenched the girl's cheeks while she listened. ,I -have nothing to forgive you!

Now, I know I never de- spaired before! Great Heavensl how I loved that woman! and this is the end I " He walked to the other side of the room. Rosa durst not follow him even with her eyes. She sat, her face concealed by her handkerchief, weeping many tears for him--more for herself, until she heard his step close beside her, and he seated himself upon her sofa. "Rosa! dear friend! my sympathizing little sister! I shall not readily gain my own pardon for having dis- tressed 'you so sorely. When you can do it with com- parative ease to yourself, I want you to tell me one or two things more, and then we will never allude to irreparable bygones again." "I am ready!" removing her Soaked cambric, and forcing a fluttering smile that might show how com- posed she was; " don't think of me I I was only grieved for your sake, and sorry because I had unwittingly hurt you. I was in hopes--'I imagined -" 6   t   ROSA.. "That I had outlived my ' disappointment? : You said, that same September day, that women hid their green wounds in sewing rooms and oratories. Mine should have been cauterized long ago, by other and harsher means, you think. It seldom bleeds- but to- night, I had not time to ward off the point of the knife and i touched a rsw spot. Don't let me frighten you! now that the worst is upon me, I must be calmer presently. You were at Ridgeley, in Sep- tember, a year since, when she who was then Miss Aylett '- compelling himself to the articulation of the sentence that signified the later change-"received her brother's command to reject me " "I was." "He would never tell me upon what evil report his prohibition was based. He was more communicative with his sister, I suppose"  And Rosa, following the example of other women- and nen--who vaunt their principles more highly than she did hers, made a frank disclosure of part of the truth and held her tongue as to the rest. "1 couldn't help seeing that something was wrong, for Mabel, who, up to the receipt of her brother's letter and one from you that came by the same mail, had been very cheerful and talkative, suddenly grew more serious and reserved than was her habit at any time; but she told me nothing whatever, never mentioned your name again in my hearing. Mrs. Sutton did hint   to me her fear that Mr. Aylett had heard something prejudicial to your character, which had greatly dis- pleased him and shocked Mabel, but even she was un- accountably reticent. Intense as was my anxiety to learn the particulars of the stdry, and upon what evi- dence they were induced to believe it, I dared not press my inquiry into what it was plain they intended to guard as a family secret." His reply was just what she had foreseen and guarded against. "It would have been a kind and worthy deed, had you written to warn me of my danger, and advised me to make my defence in person. As it was, I was thrown ff roughly and pitilessly - my demand upon the brother for the particulars of the accusation against me-my appeal to the sister--loving and earnest as words could make it- for permission to visit her and learn from her own lips that she trusted or disowned mne, were alike disregarded. Mr. Aylett's response was a secopd letter, more coldly insulting than the first-- hers, the return of my last, after she had opened and read it, then the surrender of my gifts, letters, notes, everything that could remind her that we had ever met and loved. Mrs. Sutton, too, tay father's old and firm friend, deserted me in my extremity. And she must have been acquainted with the character and extent of the charges preferred against me. I had hoped better things from her, if only because I bear her dead hus-    ROSA. band's name; Did she never speak in your hearing of writing to me ?" "She did-but said, in the next breath, that it would be useless, since the minds of the others were fully made up. I knew she thought Winston arbi- trary, and Mabel credulous; but she was afraid to in- terfere. i As for myself, what could I have told you that you had not already heard? I could only hope that the cloud was not heavy, and would soon blow over. From the hour in which it cast the first shadow upon her, Mabel was estranged from me-the decline of our intimacy commenced. The Ayletts take pride in keeping their own counsel. Winston, who never liked me, and whom I detested, was as confidential with me in this affair as my old playfellow and school- mate. Believe me when I declare that if my interces- sion could have availed aught with her, I would have run the risk of her displeasure and Winston's anath- emas by offering it." "I do believe you ! Xoor need you expatiate to me upon the obduracy of the Aylett pride. Surely, no one, living has more reason than I to comprehend how unreasoning and implacable I find it is. I looked for injustice at Winston Aylett's hands. I read him truly in our only private interview.

But he was powerless to do more than annoy me with- out his sister's co-operation.   - "She stood in great, almost slavish, awe of him," urged Rosa, in extenuation of Mabel's infidelity. "Aye!" savagely. "And love was not strong enough to cast out fear! She was justifiable if she 8 hesitated to entrust herself and her happiness to the keeping of one she had known but two months. It was prudent-not false--in her to weigh, to the finest grain, the evidence furnished by her brother to prove my unfitness to be her husband. But having done all this, she should have remembered that I had rights also. It was infamous, cowardly, cruel beyond degree, to cast her vote against me without giving me a chance of self-exculpation. Hr hand-not his- struck the dagger into my back!"  i Again Rosa's| fingers involuntarily (.) stole into his, to recall him to a knowledge of where he was, and there were fresh tears, ready to fall from her gazelle eyes, when his agitation began to subside. "My poor child!" he said, penitently. "I am be- having like a madnian, you like a pitying angel! We will have no more scenes, and you must oblige me by forgetting this one, as fast as may be. From to-night Mabel Aylett is to me as if she had never been. To nobody except yourself have I betrayed the secret of   200         ROSA. my hurt. After this, when you think of it, believe that it is a hurt no longer." Rosa "had out" her fit of crying when he went away, betaking herself to her chamber and locking the door that her aunt might not surprise her while the traces of tears disfigured her cheeks. But she was anything but broken-hearted, and only slightly sore in spirit in the retrospect of what had ensued upon her communication to the discarded lover. He had, in- deed, given more evidence of his unconquered passion for Mabel than she had expected. His undisguised pleasure in renewed companionship with herself; his excellent spirits during the greater part of the even- ing; his unembarrassed reply to her aunt's malapropos observation, and fluent chat upon other themes, had misled her into the hope that the ungenerous and un- civil conduct of the Ayletts had disgusted and alien- ated him from sister, no less than from brother. It was a disappointment to discover that it cost him a ter- rible effort to pronounce Mabel's name, while the ab- rupt intelligence of her marriage had distracted him to incoherent ravings, which had nearly amounted to curses upon the authors of his pain. "And all for a woman who could bring herself, after being engaged to Frederic Chilton, to marry that dolt of a Dorrance!" she said, indignantly. "I wonder if he would have been consoled or chagrined had I painted the portrait of the man who had superseded  .   t               -     BosA.         201 him. It is as well that I did not make the experiment. Hle would be magnanimous enough when he cooled down--which he will do by to-morrow morning - to pity her, and that is next to the last thing I want him to do. Thank goodness! the denozuement is over, and the topic an interdicted one from this time forth. Now for the verification or refutation of the saying that a heart is most easily caught in the rebound. There was some jargon we learned at school about the angle of incidence being equal to that of reflection. You see, my dearly beloved self," nodding with re- turning sauciness at her image in the mirror before which she was combing her hair, "I undertake this business in the spirit of philosophical investigation." She needed to keep her courage up by these and the like whimsical conceits, when the forenoorr of the next day passed away without a glimpse of Mr. Chilton. He had not yet left his card for the Masons, nor called to inquire after her health, when the summons sounded to the five o'clock dinner. A horrible apprehension seized and devoured her heart by the time the dessert was brought on, and there were no signs of his appear- ance. He had, ashamed to meet her after last night's exposure of his weakness, or dreading the power of the reminiscences the sight of her would awaken, left the city without coming to say "Farewell." That is, she had driven him from her forever I /    ,               ,   ROSA. The room went around with her in a dizzy waltz, as the notion crossed her brain. "The sight and smell of 11 these sweets make me sick, Aunt Mary," she said, rising from the table. "My head aches awfully! May I go to my room and, lie down ?" "Try some of this nice lemon-ice, my love!" pre- scribed the plump matron. "The acid' will set you all straight. No? You don't think you are going to have a chill, do you ? Father!" nudging her husband who was burying his spoon in a Charlotte Russe, "this dear child doesn't want any dessert. Won't you pilot her through the crowd ?" "Only to the door, uncle! Then come back to your dinner! " Rosa made answer to his disconcerted stare. "I can find my way to my chamber without- help." She could have done it, had she been in possession of her accustomed faculties. But between the har- rowing suspicion that engrossed her mind and the nervous moisture that gathered in her eyes with each step, she mounted a story too high, and did not per- ceive her blunder until, happening to think that her apartment must lie somewhere in the region she-had gained, she consulted the numbers upon the adjacent doors, and saw that she had wandered a hundred rooms out of her way. She stopped short to consider which   203   [ROSA.   of the corridors, stretching in gas-lit vistas on either hand, would conduct her soonest to the desired haven, when a gentleman emerging from a chamber close by stepped directly upon her train.    CHAP'TER XI. IN THE REBOUND. "BEG your pardon!" said a deep, familiar voic-- Then the formality vanished from face and ad- dress. Is this you?" holding out his hand in hearty friendliness that instantly dispelled Rosa's forebodings. "What or whom; are you seeking in these wilds?"  The crystal beads glistened upon her lashes in the fulness and joy of her delmerance from doubt and fear, and before she could twinkle them back, broke into smaller brilliants upon her cheeks and the bosom of her dress. It was very babyish and foolish, but it is to be questioned whether she could have contrived a more telling situation had she studied it for a month. What is it!" inquired Frederic, kindly, not releas- ing the fingers that twitched, more than struggled, in his. "  Have you been frightened?" "Yes," with grieved, but fearless simplicity. "I was frightened because I thought I had offended you --perhaps driven you away - and that I should never ,(04)    IXN 211' .EBOUlJv1.      205 'be able to ask your forgiveness for my cruel abrupt- ness last night I In thinking about and worrying over this, I somehow lost my way, and was just trying to remember by what route I reached this strange neigh- borhood, when your appearance startled me." "You did not know, then, that this is Bachelor's Hall - the haunt of unmated Benedicts, wifeless vis- itors to the city, and celibate M. C.'s ." he rejoined, pleasantly. "Let me be your guide to more desirable as well as more accessible quarters!" On the stairs he bent to scan her blushing counte- nance. "How am I to punish you for your naughty distrust of my friendship and common sense? I have been too busy all day to spare a minute for social pleasure. - I dined at two o'clock, having an appointment at three, -returned at half-past five, and was just coming down to your parlor to look you up. Another bit of unimport- ant news, with which I should not have annoyed you if you had not merited a little vexation by your pre- posterous fancies, is, that, instead of taking an early train to Philadelplia, I have to-day entered into en- gagements that will oblige me to prolong my stay in this place until the first of February." He looked bright and cheerful, ready for sport or badinage. Rosa caught herself wondering many times during that evening, and the succeeding days of the three weeks they passed under the -ame roof, if she   200      IN 2T  ' RzBOUND. had dreamed of--not beheld with her bodily optics- that one stormy burst of passion which had been his farewell to the hope of a final reconciliation with Mabel Aylett. He never spoke of her again, or referred, in the most distant manner, to his visit at Ridgeley. The omission was an agreeable one to Rosa for several rea- sons. Silence, she believed, was to oblivion as a means to an end. Judgig from herself, she adopted the the- ory that people were apt to forget what they never talked of themselves, nor heard mentioned by others. Furthermore, she was relieved from the necessity of concocting diplomatic evasions, dexterously skirting the truth, to say nothing of plump falsehoods. These last cost her conscience some unpleasant twinges. To avoid narrating in full what had happened was a work of art. A downright he was a stroke of heavy business, unsuit- ed to her airy genius-and  when the Aylett-Chilton complication was upon the  tapis, it was difficult to avoid undertaking such. For three weeks, then, Mr. Frederic Chilton and the Virginian belle visited concert, theatre, and assembly- room in company, sat side by side in the spectators' gal- lery of House and Senate chamber, walked in daylight along the broad avenues from one magnificent distance to another, and on home-evenings- which were not man   -- chatted together familiarly, the well-pleased Masons thought confidentially, by the fireside in the   IN THE  EB OUND.      207 family parlor. It must not be inferred from theircon- stant intercourse that he had the field entirely to him-  self. Gallants of divers pretensions - first-class, me- diocre, and contemptible -considered with a practical eye to "settlement," hovered about the fascinating witch as moths about a gas-burner, and had no citable cause of complaint of non-appreciation, inasmuch as she shed equal light upon all, save one. ' My very old friend, Mr. Chilton," she was wont to denominate him in conversation with those who inwardly called them- selves fools for their jealousy of a man of whom she spoke thus frankly, with never a stammer or blush; yet they acknowledged to themselves all the while that they were both suspicious and envious of his superior advantages. However backward Frederic may have been in the' beginning to monopolize the notice and time of his " sisterly friend," he was not an insensate block, who could not perceive and value the compli- ment paid him by her partiality - ever apparent, but never unmaidenly. Impute it to whatever motive he might, the distinction titillated his vanity, touched, at least, the outermost covering of his heart. It might be 'pity, it might be pleasant, mournful memories of other days--it was most likely of all a sincere platonic af- fection for one with -tastes and feelings akin to hers that gave lustre to her eyes, and gentle meaning to her smile when he drew near. At any rate, it would be churlish not-to accept ithe preference these conveyed,   208      IN THEzE REBOUJND. and to like her and his position as her chosen knight better every day; it was inevitable that hi should mar- vel-not without melancholy-, at the iht of time that brought so soon the day of parting. -The Masons, with himself, were engaged to attend a large party on the last eveningl of January. Without analyzing the impulse thlat constrained him to do so, he had refrained from reminding Rosa that his stay in Washington was so nearly over, and, with masculine consistency, he was half disposed to be affronted that she had forgotten what he had said to her of its extent. He had never seen her more lively--in more radiant spirits and looks-- than she was upon the night of the 30th. He had dropped into her aunt's parlor about ten o'clock, and detected Rosa in the act of dragging her new ball-dress from the box in which the mantua- maker had sent it home. "Conceive, if you can - but you can't, being a ran -what I have undergone for an hour and more!" ihe 'cried, at seeing him.. "My treasure-the darlinIest love of a dress I have ever ordered - was brought in exactly two seconds before a brace of honorables - lm- bering machines that they are! knocked at the dor. So, lest they should brand me as a frivolous doll (ai if anybody with a soul, and an infinitesimal degree of love for the beautiful, could help admiring the divine thing!), I pushed the poor box under the sofa, and there it has lain in ignominious neglect, like a pearl of   IN B'SE REBOUdND.      209 purest ray serene smothered in an oyster, all the time they were here. I was purposely cross and stupid, too, in the hope of getting rid of them the sooner. If you despise what most of your .undiscriminating sex call fancy articles, consider a woman's fondness for a rav- ishing robe despicable and irrational, Mr. Chilton, you need not look this way. You could hardly have a severer-certainly not a more appropriate-punish- ment." "You depreciate- my aesthetic proclivities," he re- joined, catching her tone. "You would not trust my bungling fingers to help excavate the gem, I know; but I may surely use my eyes- admire, as we bid children do  with my hands behind my back." Notwithstanding his\ boast of knowingness in the mysteries of feminine apparel, he could not'have told of what material the divine robe was made-except that it was some shiny white stuff, with wide embroid- ery upon the flounces. But Rosa, her aunt, and cousin had gone into ecstacies over it, and instigated by kind- hearted Mrs. Mason, the enraptured owner had rushed off to Mrs. Mason's chamber to try it on, returning presently in full array, elate at the " perfect fit," and insisting upon a unanimous declaration that she "had never before worn anything one-thousandth part as becoming.' "It is a   insome, fantastic, enchanting little. being!" remarked Mr. Chilton, in soliloquy at his   210      IN  IS' REBOUND. dressing-table, the next evening "I hope she will enjoy the gathering to-night, as she hopes to do. Will she miss me at the next she attends? ' Then  laughing at the sentimental visage portrayed upon the mirror - It would be the acme of ludi6rous folly for me to disturb myself on that score.

Expressing in his composed lineaments and firm stride nothing like disconsolateness at the programme, he flung his cloak over his arm, took his white gloves in his hand, cast a passing glance at the glass to see that his whiskers and hair were in order, and ran down the two flights of stairs lying between Bachelor's Hall and the Masons' private parlor. "t Come in!" said a plaintive voice, in answer to his knock. Rosa was alone in the cosy apartment. She was curled up in a great padded chair, set upon the hearth. rug. Her dress was a plain black silk; she wore a scarlet shawl, and her head-gear was some odd, but   IN W-i- REBOUN/D.      2" distractingly pretty construction of white lace, a square folded in two unequal triangles, and knotted loosely, handkerchief-wise, the points in front, under her chin. "Not ready!" exclaimed Frederic, in merry re- proach. "You, the model of punctual women! i I am not going!" sighed the humming-bird, dol- orously. "I have had a horrid sore throat i all day- and - a- headache - and Aunt Mary got frightened, and forbade me to put my head out of doors." *  "That is a heart-rending affliction! And could you not send the incomparable dress as your representa- tive . " "Don't laugh!:" she said, jerking away her head. "I cannot bear it to-night-not that I care the millionth part of a fig for all the parties in Christendom; and as for the dress, you think that I haven't a soul above such frippery and gewgaws: but I wish I had never seen it. I shall never wear it as long as I live!" And out came the laced cambric to absorb the gath- ering dew.      a "There is something in this I do not understand," said Frederic, setting a chair for himself close to hers. "Are you really suffering? I imagined that yours was a case of simple cold, and that Mrs. Mason advised you to remain indoors chiefly on account of the weather. It is raining hard!" "I am glad it is!' she replied, with the manner of one bereft of human sympathy, and extracting gloomy   2l2      IN THE REBOUND. delight from the unison of nature with her morbid ? broodings. "And my throat isn't nearly so painful as I made Aunt -Mary believe. I did not want to go out. Parties are an aw ul bore when one is sad-hearted." "You really must forgive me!" said Frederic, as she twitched her face agpy again at the laugh he could not suppress. "But sadness and you should not be thought of in the same week. Honestly, now! is not the inimitable fabric you sported for five minutes last night, at the bottom of what appears to you a fathom- less abyss of woes Have you tried the efficacy of rational consolation in the thought of how many more parties there will be this winter to which you can wear it? The Secretary of State is to give one in ten days, which is to be the sensation of the season. S That of to- night is, in comparison, as a caucus to a general con- vention." "I shall never put on the hateful thing again. If Julia Ciunningham chooses to bedizen herself in it, she is welcome to it -flounces and all. Yet I did like it! I had hoped-. but no matter what'! You had better be going, Mr. Chilton. Aunt and the rest of them went three-quarters of an hour ago." "Does a dress go out of fashion in so short a time?" persisted innocent Frederic, bent upon mitigating her sorrow. "If my memory serves me aright, I have seen ladies wear the same ball-dress several times in the same winter."

I will just run down and dismiss the carriage then, with your permission, will return and spend the eve- ning here."  Her cheeks looked as if they had been touched with wet vermilion when he resumed his place near her, and the folds of the handkerchief in her hand hung more limply. "I ought not to allow this sacrifice!" she faltered gratefully. "Because I have the vapors, I have no right to keep you within reach of the infection. It is shamefully, wickedly selfish 1" "It is no such thing!" he contradicted. "If you would know the truth, I was, myself, averse to attend- ing this 'crush.' But for your indisposition, I should hail with unmixed pleasure the chance that releases me from the obligation to form a part of the throng. It is far more in consonance with my feelings to pass this, our last evening together, as we have spent so many others, in quiet talk at this fireside. I had not sup- posed it possible that I could ever feel so much at home in a hotel--a Washington caravansary especially --as I have within the -last three weeks. Do you know, or have you not burdened your memory with such un-   IN THE REBOUND.: important memoranda as the fact, that I must set my face Philadelphia-ward to-morrow ?" "I had not dreamed that the time was so near at hand -it seemed such a little while since the evening of our arrival - until I happened, last night, after you left us, to take up Mrs. Rogers' invitation-card for this evening. Then, I recollected !" Her listless resignation had in it something piteous, and the lever of compassion impelled him to further efforts of cheer. "I have to thank you for all the enjoyment of my visit to this, heretofore to me, dismal city. If you should ever visit Philadelphia-as I ear estly hope you will  you must acquaint me with your where- abouts immediately upon your arrival. I. should be sorry to think that our friendship is to end here and now." "As well here and now, as anywhere and at any time!" returned Rosa, yet more resignedly. "And the end must come, sooner or later. This was what I was saying over to myself when you came in. I am a fool-a baby- to mind it !" angrily dashing away the obtrusive brine from her mournful eyelids. " I wish you would leave me alone for a few minutes, Mr. Chilton, until I can behave myself!

"I have found no fault in your L ehavior I" he said, too coolly to please Rosa's notion. "I know you despise me l" she burst forth, chok- ingly.

But I have been so happy, so content and grateful, lately! And everything will be so different after - after to-morrow! " Her voice had failed to a sobbing whisper, and the diaphanous cambric veiled her bowed face. Frederic Chilton did not stir a finger or attempt to speak for a full minute, but in that minute he thought a volume, felt acutely. This, then, was what he had been doing in his hours of relaxation from the business which had occupied his mind to the banishment of nearly every other consid- eration; that had driven into comparative obscurity the i old gnawing grief which had incorporated itself with his being ! The intimacy with a beautiful, sprightly girl had been a holiday diversion to him after arduous ,.- brain-labor, recreation sought conscientiously and sys- ; tematically, that his mental powers might be clearer and fresher for the next day's toil in court and among perplexing records; in hunting up titles and disputed property, and proving their validity.

It was to slip to her knees at his feet, and kiss his hand, then lay her cheek upon it, as some dumb, devoted thing might do. Then she was lifted into his arms, and kissed with a fervor she mistook for awakening passion, and her heart bounded more madly in the belief that her vic- tory was complete, that he would henceforward be hers in feeling as in name. Yet the words breathed into her ear as her head rested upon his bosom might,have taught her the fal- lacy of her conviction and her hopes.   l f"My noble, faithful/girl What have I to offer you in payment for all this?

"What good would that do, aunt?" asked Mabel Dorrance, without raising her head from her sewing. i "And what has she done that should incense you, or any one else against her? She was free to choose a husband, and we haveing right to cavil at her choice. I hope she will be very happy. I used to love her- we loved each other very fondly once. There are some excellent traits in Rosa's character, and when she is once married she will be less volatile." - "Don't you believe it. Her flightiness and insincer- ity are ingrain!

But I was secretly aware, all the time, that there was a radical defect in her composition. A woman who has been engaged, or as good as engaged, to six or eight different men, cannot retain much purity of mind or strength of affection. I heard you tell her yourself once that such unscrupu- lous flirtation and bandying of hearts were profane touches that rubbed the down from the peach." "That was the extravagant talk of a silly, romantic gilrl," replied Mabel, with a smile that .changed to a sigh before the sentence was finished.

Little scenes come to my memory that caused ne trifling uneasiness then. I shall never for- get, for instance, how she eyed you, the morning Win- ston came home so unexpectedly." Andishe described the incident recorded in the lat- ter part of our opening chapter. "Can it be," she pursued, " that she had even then designs upon the man she is about to marry-?' She knew all the circumstances of the trouble that ensued, and if/disposed to be meddlesome, she had the means at her'command.'", 'I told her nothing," said Mabel briefly. "But she pumped me pretty effectually, confessed i the aunt shamefacedly. "I thought there could be no harm ,in giving her a synopsis of the case - she being your intimate friend."

"You don't imagine for one instant that she I ould be annoyed by any such scruples as beset you!"' ried Mrs. Sutton scoffingly. "Why, the woman would soon- ir go to the altar with a handsome, dashing libertine, who had broken hearts by the dozen, than marry a quiet, honest Christian, who had never breathed of love to any ears except hers. The aim of her life is to create or experience a sensation. I don't quite see how she could have made trouble in that sad affair, but I should like to be positive that she did not." "You may safely acquit her of that sin," rejoined Mabel. "There was neither need nor room for her in- terference. Whatever may have been her inclination, she was shrewd enough to perceive that the natural course of events was bringing about the desired end-- if it were a desirable one to her- without her help or hindrance.

But your eyes and fingers have labored incessantly for six months upon the finest work you could devise, and you begin to look ike a shadow- I don't wonder Mr. Dorrance seems uneasy sometimes.

"Mr. Dorrance is ignorant of diseases and medicines, as men usually are who have not studied these with a view to practise upon themselves or others. I have said that he is not really uneasy; but he says, and with truth, that the Northern March and April are raw and cold, and will try my strength severely. Winston and Clara share in his fears. It is very kind in them to tender me the hospitalities of their house for so long a time, but I should feel more at home in my own, during my illness and convalescence." "Why not tell your husband this plainly? ' "Because it might bias his judgment and embarrass his action. I am willing to do as he thinks best." There were not many subjects upon which Mrs. Sut- ton was irascible, but she patted the floor with her foot now as if this was one of them--her discontent finding vent at length in what she regarded as a per- fectly safe query. W Will he remain with you Z " "He cannot. His business is large and increasing. He can afford but this ohe fortnight vacation." "How do you expect to get along without him?"

Do you understand, and mean to be complaisant? You are all the mother I have ever known, auntie." "My lamb! you need not fear lest I shall not im- prove every opportunity of seeing and comforting you. I shall return a civil and grateful reply to Mrs. Aylett's invitation, for your sake! and for the same reason try and remember, while I remain'her guest, that her right to be and to reign at Ridgeley is superior to yours or mine."          l The good lady was not to be haishy censured if she now and then, in private confabulation with her favorite, let fall a remark which was the reverse of complimentary to her niece-in-law. Mabel's marriage was the signal for a radical reorganization of the Ridge- ley domestic establishment, by which MDrs. Sutton was reduced from the busy, responsible situation of house- keepr to the unenviable one of unnoticed and uncon- sulted upernumerary.

"But Mr. Aylett wishes me to assume the real, as well as nominal, government of the estab- lishment" - Mrs. Aylett was fond of the polysyllable, as conveying better than any other term she could em- -ploy the grandeur of her position as Baroness of Ridgeley. 'I He insists that the servants are growing worthless and refractory under the rule of so many.

I shall undoubtedly have much trouble in curing the satellites appointed to me of their irregular habits, and reducing them to something resembling system; but Winston's extreme dissatisfaction with the anarchy that prevailed under the asneien regime moves me to the undertaking." "They have always--for generations back, I may say--been called excellent servants; faithful in the discharge of their duties, and attached to their owners," returned Mrs. Sutton tremulously. "And since I have een in charge-ever since my dear sister's death, I ave done my best with them, as with everythingo se committed by my nephew to my care. But of course I have nothing to urge against your plan. If I can help you in any way " -       - "Thank you! You are extremely kind, my dear madam," honeyedly.

I have not the vanity to believe that my maiden at- tempt at housewifery will be attended by the distinc- tion that has crowned yours, but practice will perfect in this, as in other labors. And my dear Mrs. Sutton, Mr. Aylett bids me say, in his name, as it gives .me pleasure to do in my own, that although your occupa- tion is gone, you are ever welcome to a home at Ridgeley, free of all expense. It is our hope that you may still content yourself here, even if Mabel has gone from the nest e I suppose, however, nothing will satisfy her, when she goes to housekeeping, but having you with her as a permanent institution. My brother inti- mated as much to me before his marriage." Declining with mild hauteur, that gave great, but secret amusement to her would-be benefactress, the handsome offer of a free asylum, Mrs. Sutton went to live with a cousin of her late husband's, whose snug, plantation was situated about twelve miles from the Aylett place, and in the neighborhood of the Tazewells, It was a pleasant, but not a permanent arrangement, she gave out to her numerous friends, any of whom * * . .  *'  '   .

"Ridgeley was changed and lonely since Mabel's de- parture, and her own habits were too active to be con- formed to those of so small a household. Indeed, there was nothing for her to do there any longer, so she was glad to avail herself of Mrs. William Sutton's invita- tion to stay a while with her. The children made the house so lively. In the fall, the house Mr. Dorrance was having built for his Southern bride would be ready for them, and Mabel's claim upon her aunt's society and services must take precedence of all others." The fall came, and Mabel wrote detailed descrip- tions of the beautiful home Herbert had prepared for her; wrote, moreover, with more feeling and anima- tion, of the new and precious hopes of happiness held out to her loving heart in the prospect of what the spring would give into her arms, but said nothing of her aunt's coring to her for the winter, or for an in- deflnite period, the bounds of which were to be set only by her beloved relative's wishes. The omission A was trying enough to the foster-mother's heart and patience, even while she believed the knowledge of it to be confined to herself. She could still hold up her head bravely among her kindredsand acquaintances, and talk of the "dear child's "good fortune and contentment with it; how popular and beloved she was among them, and what an elegant house her generous husband had be- *Si      4         \   A i,..'

An end was put to this innocent deception - for, if any deception can be termed innocent, it is surely that by which he who practises it is himself beguiled- the blameless guile was then arrested by a story repeated to her by her indignant hosts, as having emanated directly from Mrs. Aylett. She had given expression, publicly, at a large dinner-party, to her amazement and pity at the self-delusion under which " poor, dear Mrs. Sutton ' labored, in expecting to take up her residence with Mr. and Mrs. Dorrance. "My brother laments her hallucination as much, if not more than his wife does," she said, in her best modulations of creamy compassion. "But, indeed, my dear Mrs. Branch, they are not accountable for it. Not a syllable has ever escaped either of them which a rba- sonable person could construe into a request that she should become an inmate of' their 'household. So careful have they been to avoid exciting her expecta-. tions in this regardl that they have refrained from ex- tending to her an invitation for even a month., Those who are most familiar with the poor lady's peculiarities do not require to behold how ill-advised would be the  arrangement she desires. Mabel is a thoroughly sensi- ; I   -230 AUTNT RAHEEL WAXES UNC'HARITABLE. ble woman, and too devoted a wife to advocate any- thing so injudicious, while her husband is naturally jealous for her dignity and the -inviolability of her au- thority in her own house. Mrs. Sutton left Ridgeley in opposition to our earnest entreaties that she would spend the evening of her days with us. I was assured then, as I am now, that she would receive the same love and respect nowhere else. But she could not brook the semblance of interference with her rule where she had reigned so long and irresponsibly. And while we may deplore, we can hardly fnd fault with this weakness. It must have been a trial-and not an ordinary one - to be obliged, at her age, to resign the sceptre she had swayed for upward of fifteen years." "' Their words are smoother than oil, but in their mouths is a drawn sword, " quoted Mrs. Sutton, in meek protest against the sugared malice of this slander when it was told to her. "This is none of Mabel's do- ings. She loves me dearly as ever, but one might as well hope to move the Blue Ridge as to teach that prag- matical husband of hers to consult her wishes and her good, before he does his own. His head is hard as -a flint, and his heart - never mind! lHeaven forgive me if I am unjust to him! I should be thankful that he does not really mean to misuse my darling. lNow, my dears, you see how undesirable an inmate of any house I am rated to be.

William Sutton and his wife--a woman who was both sagacious and amiable-reiterated their assurances that she could not confer a greater boon upon them than by remaining where she was, and with them she had stayed until Mr. Aylett sent over the Ridgeley car- riage, one day in the third week in February, with a note from Mabel, begging her aunt to present herself, without needless delay, at the homestead, since she was not reckoned sufficiently strong to attempt the uneven and muddy roads that still separated them. Mrs. Aylett also dispatched a billet by the coachman, the graceful burden of which was the same as that of Mabel's peti- tion, and the two long-sundecd friiends were speedily together; fellow-partakers orca bountiful and pains- taking hospitality, which kept them continually in mind that they were guests, and not at home; The dialogue relative to Rosa Tazewell's matrimonial project took place on the third day of Mrs. Sutton's visit, in Mabels chamber, and when the former, having   232   A7UNTRACEEL WA-ES U NCHARITABLE. talked off the topmost bubbles of her righteous wrath, recollected several very important letters- business and friendly--sheought to have written a week ago, and trotted off to her room where she could perform the neglected duty without visible and outward tempta- tion to that she was more fond- of doing - to wit, talk- ing'- the young wife continued to work - steadily, and with apparent-composure. It was not a bright face on which the light from the western windows fell, yet it was not unhappy. She had never pretended to herself that her marriage was a step toward happiness, but she had believed that it would secure to her a larger share of peace, immunity from disturbance, and indepen- dence of thought and action, thant fell to her lot in her brother's house, and for these negative benefits she longed wearily. Mr. Aylett was not wantonly or openly unkind to his ward, and ungenerous persecution was utterly incom- patible with the temper and habits of his lady wife, but between them they had contrived to make the girl's life very miserable. It was Winston's cue-- adopted, let us hope, from the strict sense of duty he avowed had ever actuated him in his treatment of the charge bequeathed him by his father - to deport himself with calm, seldom-relaxed severity to one who had showed herself to be entirely unworthy of confidence; to ex- ercise unremitting surveillance upon her personal as- sociation with young people out of the family and her '         .            of t a   A U T' RACHEL WAN S UNCHARITABLE.    233 correspondence, and to curb by look and oral reproof the most distant approach to what he condemned as in- discreet levity. In a thousand ways - many of them ingenious, and all severe, she was made to feel the cur- tailment of her liberty, and given to understand that it was the just retribution of her unlucky love-affair with an unprincipled adventurer., Mrs. Aylett professed to discountenance this policy - to be Mabel's secret friend and ally, while she deemed it unwise to combat her husband's will by overt measures for his sister's protec- tion. Thus, for a year, the object of his real displeasure and her affected commiseration lived under a cloud, too proud to complain of her thraldom, but feeling it' every second; mourning, in the seclusion of the trebly barred chambers of her heart, over her shattered idol and squandered; affections, and fancying, in the morbid distrust engendered by the discovery of her lover's base- ness, and the weight of her brother's unsparing repro- bation of her insane imprudence, that she descried in every face, save Aunt Rachel's, contempt or rebuke for the faux pas that had so nearly cast a stigma upon her name and lineage. In Herbert Dorrance's honest admiration and assid-. nous courtship;the most suspicious scrutiny could de- tect no tincture of either of these feelings, and it was not long before she took refuge in his society from the risk of being wounded and angered by the supposed g   234  AU.

Here was one man who couldnot but know of her foll0y n all its length, breadth, and depth, who was a witness of her daily chastisement for it at her guardian's hands, yet who esteemed her unsullied by the unworthy attachment, undegraded by punishment. Gratitude had a powerful auxiliaryin her feverish longing to escape from scenes that kept alive to the quick, memories she would have annihilatedhad her ability been commensurate with her will. All other associations with the house in which she, and her father before her, had been born, and in which she had passed her childhood and girlish days, were overrun by the thickly thronging and pertinacious recollections of the two short weeks Frederic Chilton had spent there with her. He haunted her walks and drives; trod, by her side, the resounding floor of the vine-covered portico; sat with her in parlor and halls; sang to her accompani- ment when she would have exorcised the phantom by music-- was always, whenever and wherever he appeared -the tender, ingenuous, manly youth she had loved and reverenced as the impersonation of her ideal lord; the demi god whom she had worshipped, heart and Foul --set, in her exulting imagination no lower than the angels, and beheld in the end.- with besmirched row and debased mien, a disgraced sensualist, not mere y a deceiver of another woman's innocent confidence, and her tempter to dishonor and wretchedness, but a jol- i   .           t   235 AUNT RACEEL WAXES UNCHAEITABLE. 235 troon-- a whipped coward who had not dared to lift voice or pen in denial or extenuation of his crime.  The law of reaction is of more nearly universal ap- plication in moral and in physical science than men are -willing to believe. We have seen how cunningly Rosa calculated upon it, and wiser people than- she, every day, attribute the most momentous actions of their lives to its influence. "My advice to every woman is to mrarry for good- ness- simple integrity of word and deed!" said a lady, once in my hearing. She was an excellent scholar, attractive in person and in manner, gifted LA conversation and opulent in purse. Her hand had been sought in marriage by more  than one, and in early womanhood she had made choice among her suitors of a man whose plausible exterior was the screen of a black heart and infamous life. Con- virced of her mistake barely in time to escape copart- nership in his stained name and ruined fortunes, she set up the history of her deadly peril as a beacon to r others as ardent ancunwary as her old-time self. Either to put a double point upon the moral, or to insure her- self against similar mishap in the future, she wedded an amiable and correct fool, a mere incidental in the work of human creation, who was as incapable of mak- ing his mark upon the age that produced him as an angle-worm is of lettering solid granite.

With no thought of any more formidable cause of outcry than a cramp in the much-quoted spine, Mabel dreamed on sketchily and indolently, enjoying the sight of the once-familiar process of building a wood-fire, until the yellow serpents of flame crept, red-tongued, through the interstices of the lower logs, and the larger and upper began to sing the low, drowsy tune, more suggestive of home-cheer and fireside comfort than the shrill, monotonous chirp of the famous cricket on the hearth. The pipe-clayed bricks on which the andirons rested were next swept clean; the hearth-brush hung up on its nail, and the architect of the edifice stepped back with a satisfied nod. "I have often wished for a glimpse of one of your beautiful fires, Mammy, since I have been in Albany," said Mabel, kindly. "Our rooms and halls are all heated by furnaces. An open fireplace would be a novelty to Northerners, and such a roaring, blazin'g   8240      JLIUS LENNOX. pile of hard wood as that, be considered an unpardona- ble extravagance."        .      , " Humphl I never did have no 'pinion of them people."

"You are wrong about that, if you mean that I have not every comfort I could ask. My house is warm in the bitterest weather, and far more handsomely fur- nished than this. And I have many kind friends. I like the Northern people, and so would you, ifyou knew them well." "They send dreadful poor samples down this way, then," muttered Phillis, significantly.. "And, some as pertends to be somebody is nobody, or wuss, ef the truth was known. Don't talk to me 'bout 'em, Miss Mabel, darling! 'Twas a mighty black day for us when one on 'em fust laid eyes upon Mars' Winston. You've hearn, ain't you, that my house is to be tore down, and I'm to go into the quarters 'long with the field hands and sich like common trash? So long as our skins is all the same color, some folks can't see no difference in us."   JULIUS LENNOX.        241 "I had not heard it. I am sorry. Mabel spoke earnestly, for "Manmmy's house," a neat frame cottage a story-and-a-half high, embowered in locust-trees, and with a thrifty, although aged garden - honeysuckle clambering all over the front, was to her one of the dearest pictures of her early days. She could see herself, now.--the motherless babe whom Aunt Rachel and Mamnmy had never let feel her orphanage-sitting on the door-step, bedecking her doll with the odorous pink-and-white blossoms in sum- mer time, and in autumn with the light-red berries. "Why is that done?" she asked. "I spiles the prospect, honey!" fiercely-ironical. "Northern folks has tender eyes, and I hurts 'em- me and my poor little house what ole marster built for me when lars' Winston was a baby, and your blessed ma  : couldn't be easy 'thout I was near her- we spiles the prospect!

I'se a heap of wear in me yit, and there ain't nothing 'bout babies I don't understand." Mabel colored painfully. "If I had my way "- she began - then altered her plan of reply. "I could not enter into such an ar- rangement without consulting Mr. Dorrance, Mammy, and I am afraid he would not think as favorably of it as you and I do., He has been brought up with differ- ent ideas, you see."

But her outside is all that's decent about her, ef you'll listen to me-- " "You are forgetting- yourself again!" said Mabel, unable to suppress a smile. "Mrs. Aylett is your mis- tress  " The woman's queer behavior arrested the remon- strance. Stepping on tiptoe to the door she locked it, and approached her young mistress with an ostentatious attempt at treading lightly, shaking her- head and pursing up her mouth in token of secrecy, while she fumbled in her bosom for something that seemed hard to get at. Drawing it forth at last she laid it in Ma- bel's lap - a small leather wallet, glossy with use, tat- tered at the corners, and tied up with a bit of dirty twine. ' What is this, and what am I to do with it " Mabel shrank from touching it, so foul and generally disreputable was its appearance. {        '               ,    .    244       JULIUS LENNOX. "Keep both your ears open, dearie, and I'll tell you all I know I  And with infinite prolixity and numerous digressions she recounted how, in removing the sodden clothing of the unknown man who had been picked up on the lawn on that memorable stormy Chistmas night, more tlhan a year before, this had slipped from an inner breast-pocket of the coat, "right into her hand." Not caring to disturb the doctor's examination of his pa- tient, or to tempt the cupidity of her fellow-se vants by starting the notion that there might: be other valua- bles hidden in 'the articles they handled so carelessly, she had pocketed it, unobserved by them, guessing that it would be of service at the inquest. Her purpose of producing it then was, according to her showing, reversed by Mrs. Aylett's stolen visit to the chamber and minute inspection of garments she would not have touched unless urged to the disagreeable task by some mighty consideration of duty, self-interest, or fear. "'Then,' thinks!"--Phills stated  the various steps of her reasoning--" you wouldn't take the trouble to pull over them nasty, muddy close, thout you expected to get some good out on 'em, orwas afeard of somethin' or 'nother fallin' into somebody else's hands.'

But when I come to think it all over arterward, I was skeered for true at what I'd done, and for fear Mars' Winston wouldn't like it. What reason could I give him for hidin' of the pockethook, ef I give it up to him I Ef I tole all the truth, she'd be mad as a March hare, and like as not face me down that all I had said was a dream or a lie, or that I was drunk that night and couldn't see straight. - I'd hearn her tell too many fibs with a smooth tongue and a sweet smile not to be sure of that! So, all I should git-for my care of the repertation of my fam'ly would be her ill-will, and to be 'cused by other people of stealin', and for the rest of my days she'd do all she, could to spite me. For I'm sure as I stand here, Miss Mabel, that she knew, or thought she knew, somethin' 'bout that poor, despisable wretch that died up in the garret. What else brought him a-spyin round here, and what was there to make her faint when she ketched sight of him a-lookin' in at her through the winder? and what could. a sent her upstars when everybody else wa asleep, fur to haul his close about, and poke them white fingers of hem  into his pockets, and pull his whiskery face over to the light so's to see it better': Depend 'pon it, there's a bad story at the bottom of this somewhere. I've heam of many a sich that came of gentlemens' marrying forringers what nobody knowed anything about. Anyhow, I want you to take keer of   246.       JULIUS LENNOX. this 'ere pockethook. Ef I was to die all of a saddent, and 'twas found 'mong my things, some misctief mought be hatched out on it. It's safer in your hands nor it is in mine. Now, I'll jest light your lamp, and you can 'famine it, and pitch it into the fire, ef you like, when you're through." In a cooler moment Mabel would have hesitated to obey the advice of an ignorant, prejudiced person, her inferior in station and intelligence. But in the whirl of astonishment, incredulity, and speculation created by the tale she had-heard, she untied the string which formed the primitive fastening of the worn wallet, and unclosed it. The main compartment containeidfour tickets, issued by as many different pawnbrokers, testifying that such and such articles had been deposited with them for and in consideration of. moneys advanced by them to Thomas Lindsay; a liquor-seller's score against Wil- liam Jones-unpaid; and a tavern bill, in which brandy and water, whiskey and mint-juleps, were the principal items charged against Edmund Jackson. This last -was the only paper which bore the indorse- ment "Rec'd payment," and this i circumstance had, probably, led to its preservation. The adjoining di- vision of the wallet was sewed up with stout black thread, and Mabel had to resort to her scissors before she could get at its contents. These were a couple of ,worn envelopes, crumpled and dog-eared, and stained   JULIUS LIXJ vOX.       247 with liquor or salt water, but still bearing the address, in a feminine hand, of "Lieutenant Julius Lennox, U. S N." In addition to this, one was directed to Havana, Cuba; the other to Calcutta, in care. of a mercantile or banking -house at each place. A third cover bore the superscription, "CERTIFICATE," in bold characters. The negress' watchful eyes dilated with greedy ex- pectancy at rs. Dorranceis ghastly face when this last had been examind, but she was foiled if she hoped for any valuable addition to her store of information, or anything resembling elucidation of her pet mystery. "It will take me some time to read all these," re- marked Mabel, still scanning the half-sheet she held. "You had better not wait, Mammy. They are safe with me. No one else shall see them, and no harm can come to you through them." She promised mechanically what she supposed would soonest buy for her privacy and needed quiet, and gave no heed to the manifest disappointment of her visitor. When she was at last alone, Mrs. Dorrance relocked the door, and bent close to the lamp, as if more light upon the surface of the document would tend to clear up the terrible secret thus strangely committed to her discretion and mercy. The paper was a certificate, drawn up in regular form, and signed by a clergyman, whose address was appended below, in a different hand-   248       JVJULIUS LE; OX. writing--of a marriage between Julius Lennox and Clara Louise Dorrance. "Her very name!" repeated the whitening lips. "I remember asking her once what the L' in her signa- ture stood for." But while she said it, there was a look in the read- er's eye that bespoke inability or reluctance to grapple with the revelation threatened by the discovery. "The letters may tell me more!" she added, in the 'same frightened whisper, refolding the certificate. They did-for they were in the long, sloping chi- rography of her sister-in-law, and signed "Your ever- fond, but lonely wife." Each contained, moreover, al- lusions to "Ellis," to"OClermont," to "Julia," and to "Herbert"--all family names in the Dorrance con- nection; spoke gratefully of her parents' kindness to his "poor Louise" in the absence of "her beloved Ju- lius; " and was liberally spiced with passionate pro- testationsof her inconsolableness and yearnings for-his return. Both were dated ten years back, and the paper was yellow with time, besides being creased and thumbed as by many readings. "What am  I to do?" thought Mabel, sinking into her chair, trembling all over with terror and incerti- tude.  ,   If there were one sentiment in 'Winston Aylett'^ heart that equalled his haughtiness, it was love for his wife. But could it be that he had totally forgotten   JZULIUS LENNOX.       249 pride and his habitual caution in the selection of the woman who was to be the partner of his home, fortune, and reputation -possibly the mother of children who were to perpetuate the noble name he bore? By what miracle of unrighteous craft, what subornation of wit- nesses, what concealments, what barefaced and unscru- pulous falsehoods had this adventuress been imposed upon him as unmarried, when the evidence of her for- mer wedlock was held by a low stroller - a drunken wretch who might betray it in an unguarded or insane hour, and who, judging from his exterior, would not be averse to publishing or selling the information if he could make more money by doing this than by pre- serving the secret. And how came he by these papers? Confused, partly by his numerous aliases, more by incapacity to conceive of such depth and complication of horror as were revealed by the idea, the perplexed thinker did not, for a while, admit to herself the possi- bility that the nameless vagabond may have been Clara's living husbandinstead of a mercenary villain who had secured surreptitiously the proofs of a marriage she wished the world to forget. Having learned that she had wedded, a second time, in -her maiden name, and that her antecedents were unsuspected in, her present home, the thought of extorting a bribe to continued si- lence, from the wealthy lady of Ridgeley, would have occurred to any common rascal with more audacity than principle. It was but a spark- the merest point   250       JULIUS LENNOX. of light that showed her the verge of the precipice tow- ard which one link after another of the chain of cir- cumstantial evidence was dragging her. Groping dizzily among her recollections of that Christmas night, there gleamed luridly upon her the vision of Mrs. Aylett's strange smile, as she said, "It may be that his wife, if she were cognizant of his con- dition, would not lift a finger or take a step to save his life, or to prolong it for an hour!" Then, in response to Mabel's indignant reply- the momentary passion darting from her hitherto languor- ous orbs, and vibrating in her accents, in adding-- "There are women in whose hearts the monument to departed affection is a hatred that can never die." If this man were a stranger, from whom she had nothing to fear, why her extraordinary agitation at see- ing him, even imperfectly, through the window? She must have known him well to recognize him in the darkness and at that fleeting glimpse. Perhaps she had believed him dead, until then! This would ac- count for her clandestine visit to his chamber, to -which Mrs. Sutton and her niece had gone, without effort at concealment;, explain the rigid examination of his clothing ensuing upon her scrutiny of his features. "I must be mad!"Mabel said, here, pressing her hand to her head. (I There does not live the woman, however wicked and hypocritical, who could sit at ease in the midst of it-gotten luxury, on an inclement   JULIUS LENNOX.        251 night, and talk smilingly of other things, if she suspect- ed that one she had known, much less loved, lay: dying in wretchedness and solitude so near her." The vagrant was some evil-disposed spy, whose per- son Clara knew, and whose intentions she had reason to dread were unfriendly. Had she dared '-for she was daring- to attempt this nefarious plot against the fair fame and happiness of an honorable gentleman, her family would not have become her accomplices. They could not have  ded themselves to the perils of the enterprise, the extreme probabilities of detection, the consequences of Winston's anger. Herbert, at least, would have forbidden the unlawful deceit. When his sister was wedded to Winston, he believed that her first husband was no longer in, the land of the living - as she must also have done. "For he is a good -an upright man!" thought the wife. "But he was privy to the fact of her previous marriage! Why have I never heard of it? He has invariably spoken- of Clara as having lived single in her mother's house up to the date of her union with my brother." She could not but remember, likewise, that there was a certain tone about the Dorrance connection she had never quite comprehended or liked - a reticence with respect to details of family history, while they were voluble upon generalities, over-fond of lauding one : another's exploits, virtues, and accomplishments refe. '-vj::   252       JULrUS LENNOX. ring in wonderful pride to "our beloved father," and extolling " our precious mother," who, by the way, was so little in request among the children, that she had, since Clara's marriage, occupied apartments in a second- rate boarding-house in Boston. Mabel, when convinced of the futility of her hope of having Aunt Rachel with her, had proposed to offer Mrs. Dorrance a house in the commodious mansion of her youngest son; but Herbert, with no show of gratification at what he must have known was a sacrifice of her inclinations, had coolly reasoned- down the suggestion. The whole tribe --if she excepted her husband, and perhaps Clara--had, to her perception, a tinge of Bohemianism, although all were in comfortable circumstances, and lived showily. Mabel had often chided herself for uncharitable judg- ment and groundless prejudice, in admitting these im- pressions of her relatives-ill-law; but they returned ip- on her in this twilight reverie with the force of convic- tions she was, each moment, less able to combat. What darker secret lay back of the concealment her rectitude of principle and sense of justice declared to be unjust- ifiable? and might not this concerted and persistent reserve imply others yet more culpable? It showed her correct estimate of her brother's char- acter, that she never for a second accused him of con- nivance in the deceit practised upon his relations and neighbors. He would not have scrupled to wed a w4ow, kInos ing and acknowledging her to be such.   J7LIUS LENNOX.        253 Nothing-not love, tenfold more ardent and irrational than that he felt for his siren wife- could have wrought upon him to introduce to the world, as Mrs. Aylett of Ridgeley, bne who had been before married, and was ashamed, for any cause whatever, to avow this. The blemish left by the acrid breath of common scandal upon a woman's fame was to him ineffaceable by any process yet discovered by pitying man or angels. The maligned one may not have erred from the straitest road of virtue and discretion, but she had been " talked about" and was no consort for him. In his State and caste, private marriages were things disallowed, and but one shade more respectable than liasons that did not pretend to the sanctity of wedlock. What would he say when the contents of this dingy pocket-book were spread before him a Ought his sister to do this? Could she? He had not earned compassionate con- sideration from her by any act of gentleness and for- bearance. He had handled the lopping-knife without ruth, and let the gaping wounds bleed as long as the bitter ichor would ooze from her heart. She had learned hardness and self-control from the lesson, but not vin- dictiveness. Now that the power was hers to visit upon his haughty spirit something of the humiliation and distress he had not spared her; that it was her turn to harangue upon- esallancees and love-matches, and want of circumspect investigation into early ecords before committing one's self to a contract of marriage -   254       JULrUS LENNOX. she recoiled at the thought; felt, in her exceeding pity for the trustful husband, a stirring of' the love she' had herself once borne him in the days when the changed homestead was her world, and its master a king among men.  And yet--and yet -was it the truest friendship- the most prudent course to prolong the ignorance which left him liable at any moment to be shocked into the perpetration of some desperate deed by the discovery, through some other channel, bf his wife's perfidy, and the abominable snare that had been woven about him? ,    'a' To                    .

ABEL was still turning the vexed question of right and expediency over in her'fast-heating ( .I brain, the next evening, as she sat in the parlor, and feigned to hearken to the diligent duett- practising going on at the piano, her husband and Mrs Aylett being the performers. 1rs. Sutton had gone home that afternoon, engaging to return for a longer sojourn in the course of-a month. Mr. Aylett read his newspaper at one side of the cen- tre table, and his sister employed her fingers and eyes at the other with a trifle of fancy-work-an, anti- macassar she was cricheting for her hostess. Her in- dustrious or fidgetty habits were chronic and inveterate, and people, in remarking upon them, did not reflect that this species of restlessness is in itself a disease, seldom analysed, more seldom cured. There are few students or physicians of human nature, in this world of superficial observers, who go deep enough into the springs of man's action to distinguish the external   i 256        "'BORN D27M P  symptoms of heart-cancer from ossification, or to learn the difference between satiety and atrophy. A nighl of nervous sleeplessness, a day of irresolution and dread, had aggravated almost beyond her control the restlessness which in Mabel was the unerring indica: 5 tion of unhealthiness of mind and body. To sit still was impracticable; to talk connectedly and easily would soon be as difficult. She was glad to see Aunt -Rachel go-immeasurably relieved when a musical evening was proposed y the brother and sister, second-' ing the motion with alacrity that called forth a pleased smile from the one, and a look of surprised inquisitive- ness from the other. "You have grown more fond of instrumental music " said Mrs. Aylett, half interrogatively. ' You used al- ways to prefer vocal.": ' Try me and see what an appreciative listener I am," rejoined Mabel, with a  sickly smile, and the concert commenced. Overmuch thought upon the revelation of the pre- ceding day had begotten in her, fears of the imminence of the danger to Winston's peace of mind - a persua- , sion that the birds of the air and the restless air itself , might bear to him the news she still withheld. Mammy had averred,upon her cross-examination, that "not a living soul had ever seen the wallet" since it fell from  the dying man's pocket -an affirmation Mabel' could ,.

"I was aware that it was not dead when you mar- ried a man worth a thousand such scoundrels as that fellow in Philadelphia. I believed that the sentiment was powerful in impelling you to that marriage, and that this irrevocable measure would, be an antidote to the evil.

I caution you to be on your guard lest your husband should take just offence at all this. The need of dis- simulation is lthevidence that something is radically wrong in your moral nature, and is derogatory to your lawful partner.

You have, without doubt, been informed long since how I obtained the most im- portant proof against that villain?" "I have not heard Mr. Chilton's name in a year un- til yesterday," said Mabel, the scarlet spots ceasing to flicker, and her voice hard as was his own. Unable to interpret her sudden steadiness of de- meanor and accent, Winston leaped to the irritating conclusion that she was sullen, and meditated a defiant retreat from this untimely usurpation of his olden au- thority. "It was injudicious--miserably ill-judged in Dor- rance not to acquaint you with this. I have always feared lest his indulgence might not be the most salu- tary method of repressing your self-will and pride of opinion. You, more than any other woman I know, require the tight rein of vigilant discipline. I inti- mated as much to Dorrance when he asked my consent to your engagement. But this is his lookout, not mine. What I began to say was that, in my opinion, he would have acted more sensibly had he not encour- aged your squeamish repugnance to talking of your early fault and its mortifying consequences." "Fortunately for me, my husband is a man of feel- ing and delicacyI!"Mabel was goaded. to boast.

"He would have overcome it more quickly and thoroughly had he informed you that he had had the honor of horse-whipping your ci-devant betrothed!" sneered Winston, with white dinted nostrils. "That he was the author of the letter, a portion of which I copied for your perusal, when I announced the disso- lution of your provisional engagement-the main agent; in effect, of the rupture, since but for himn I should have had much diffliculty in proving what I had believed from the beginning-that the rascal ought to be shot for presuming to think of you inm any other light than as the merest acquaintance. And he should never have been that, had I been with you that Ln- lucky summer." "We have been over that ground so often, Winston, that both of us should be tolerably familiar with it" rejoined Mabel, decidedly. 'I prefer that, instead of reviewing the circumstances of what you term my 'early fault,' you should show me the evidence of your singular assertion respecting Mr. Dorrance's agency in a matter m which he could not at that time have had the slightest personal interest. Or, shall I ask him? It is an enigma to me." Withoutlother answer than-it contemptuous laugh, Winston left the room, unnoticed by the musicians. But before she could form a conjecture as to the - '   '       ." BO .N/ DEAD."      261 meaning of his abrupt movement, he was back with a letter in his hand. "Documentary testimony!" he said, shortly, passing it to her.

Then followed the expos of Frederic Chilton's mis- deeds, which Winston had transferred to his own epis- tle to Mabel, as the leading argument in his refusal to sanction her engagement. Mabel read it through without flinching; then turned over to the first page and put her finger upon a paragraph. "Who was the lady here mentioned?" Mr. Aylett shrugged his fine shoulders. "I have never interested myself to inquire. Beyond the statement of your friend's rascality, the story waet nothing to me." "Herbert!"   262       "BOR., D iA )n., The ringing call-sharp and clear- checked the pian'ists in the middle of a bar. "Step here a moment, if you please!" The novelty of the imnperative tone and the glitter of his wife's eyes moved Mr. Dorrance to more prompt compliance than he would have adjudged to be dignified and husbandly in the case of another maan & Mabel held out the letter at his approach, still point- ing to the'passage she had asked her brother to ex- plain. "To whom does this refer T Who was the relative whose husband was a naval officer " Herbert Dorranoe's constitutional phlegm was a val- uable ally in the very contracted quarters into which this question drove him, but his sister was his deliv- erer. Affecting forgetfulness of the letter and its con- tents, he glanced down one page, Mrsi Aylett leaning upon his arm, and reading with him. "I doi't think you need mind telling the name, here and at this late day, Herbert," she said, seriously and slowly, "provided Mabel will never repeat the story when it can do harm. Have you never heard any of us speak of poor Ellen Lester, my mother's \  niece, who died several years before your marriage?" accosting her sister-in-law, with a face so devoid of aught resembling cowardly or guilty fears, that Ma-   ," BORN DiAJ)".        263 bel's brain, tried and shaken, tottered into disbelief of her own wild surmises. "Not that I remember!" 4"Is that soI Yet it might easily have been. She accompanied her husband upon his last voyage, and the ship was never heard of again. Her parents are dead, too, so there are few to cherish her memory. She was a school-fellow of mine, and Herbert loved her as a sister." Mabel was gazing fixedly at her husband's stolid countenance and averted eyes, and made no rejoinder until the silent intensity of her regards compelled him to look up. Reading distrust. and alarm in these, he shook off his sister's warning hold. "When you wish to catechise me upon family mat- ters, Mabel, it is my wish that you should do it in pri- vate," he said, rofighly. "Then you shall learn all that it concerns you to know.- There are subjects into which only prurient curiosity cares to pry." "I beg your pardon!" answered Mabel, quietly. "I have but to say, in self-defence, that I did not ask to see the letter." "It is a matter of profound indifference to me whether you did or not," was the reply. "For aught that I know or cared, you may have read it a year and a half ago. I retract nothing that is set down there. Clara, shall we go on with our music I " Glancing around stealthily at the finale of the piece, I  .                    !   264        ",BOo i iV4.R." he saw that Mabel's chair was vacant, and Mr. Aylett was reading composedly beneath the lamp. Clara made the same discovery at the same moment, and came forward laughing to her husband. "What had you been saying to our dear, excitable Mabel, that challenged the introduction of that unfor- tunate document " "Told her of Frederic Chilton's intended mar- riage!" curtly, and without laying aside his volume. ' "Preposterous!" i "I agree with you -but it is the truth." Herbert stood apart glowing'at the fire. "You must have approached the subject unskil- fully," urged the peacemaker. "These old sores are best left alone." "It is best for married woman to have none," re- torted Winston, doggedly. "She does not persist in doubting his unworthiness, does she " queried the wife,. aside, but not so cau- tiously that her brother did not hear her. He wheeled about -uddenly. "She shall believe it, or call me a liar to my face?" he uttered, angrily. "I will put a stop t this senti- mental folly!"  "You are late in beginning your reforms," observed Mr. 'Aylett, dryly.   "You are a less sensible man than I give you credit for being, if you ever begin!" interposed his sister.  ,   "BORN DEAD."         265 "Leave Mabel' to herself until she recovers from the shock--if it be one-of this intelligence.   The surest means of keeping alive a dying-coal is to stir and blow upon it. And even we"-lifting the heavy locks of her husband's' hair in playful dalliance- "even we are mortal. We have had our peccadilloes and our repentances, and have now our little conceal- ments of affairs that would interest nobody but our- selves. Do you hear what I am   saying, Herbert? Leave off your high tragedy airs and attend to reason, as expressed in your sister's advice. While your wife is my invalid guest, I will not have her subjected to any inquisitorial process. There is a time for every- thing under the sun, saith the preacher. This is the season for tender forbearance, and if need be, of for- giveness." Herbert blessed her humane tolerance in his alarmed heart, when Mabel awoke from her troubled slumbers at midnight, in extreme pain, -that culminated before dawn, in convulsions. Two physicians were hastily summoned, and when Mrs. Sutton arrived about noon, she met Phillis out- side the door of the sick-chamber, carrying a lifeless infant in her arms, and weeping bitterly. This was the end of the months of hopeful longing and glad anticipation which were Heaven's messengers of healing and comfort to the sick and lonely heart. The cunningly-fashioned robes were never to have a   -266       "BORN DEAD." wearer, the clasping arms to remain still empty. Oh wondrous mystery -past finding out - of the humai soul I Had the lungs once heaved with breath, the heart given one throb.; the eyes caught one beam o: Heaven's light ere they were sealed -fast in eterna darkness, she, who travailed with the infant througl the inexpressible agony of birth, would have been writ ten a mother among women; have had the right ac corded her, without the cavil of formalist or the dis putations of science, to claim the precious thing as he] own stil'l- a living baby-spirit that had fluttered bacd to the bosom of the Almighty Father, after alighting for one painful moment, upon the confines of the lower world. As it was, custom ordained that there should be no mourning for what had never really been. An guish, hope, and the patient love at which we do nol -scoff when the mother-bird broods over the eggs that may never hatch--these were to be no more named or remembered. In silence and without sympathy she must endure her disappointment. The tenderest woman about whose knees cluster living children, and who has sowed in tears the blessed seed, that in the resurrection-morn shall be gathered in beauteous sheaves of richest recompense - would smile in pity. ing contempt over the, tiny headstone which should be lettered ' Born Dead." All this and much more Mabel was to learn with the return of health and reason, but she lay now, like t    "BO0N DEAD.";        267 one who had passed for herself the narrow sea that separates the Now from the Hereafter; her features chiselled into the unmoving outlines of a waxen image, only a feeble flutter of breath and pulse telling that this was lethargy, not jdeath. They watched her all night, Mrs. Sutton on one side and Phillis on the other, the family physician stealing in with slippered tread from hour to hour, to note with his- sensitive touch if the few poor drops of vital blood yet trickled from veins to heart, always with the same directions, "Give her the stimulant while she can swallow it. -It is the only hope of saving her." Armed with this, the two devoted women fought the Destroyer, praying inaudibly, while they wrought, for the life of the child they had reared to her sor- rowful womanhood. "He's asleep, and so is she /" whispered .Phillis, once, pointing alternately to the adjoining room where Herbert Dorrance awaited the issue of this critical stage of his wife's illness, and to Mrs. Aylett's chamber across the hall. "The Lord forgive. em both! It won't be they two that will shed many tears if so be she doesn't see the light of another day--the mur- dered lamb I They tormented the life out of her.

The faithful creature's prejudice wronged one of the hated pair. Mrs. Aylett's slumbers upon her downy couch might be none the less serene for her sister-in-law's danger, but Herbert's was the sleep of exhaustion, not callousness. He had been up all the previous night, and racked by the wildest anxiety throughout the in- tervening day, and to compass this vigil was beyond his physical powers. Mabel would not miss him, and he could do nothing for her - would only be in the way, being totally unpractised in the art of nursing, he reasoned; and there was-no telling what new draught upon his strength the morrow might bring. He would just lie down for an hour; then he would be fresh for whatever serviceb might be required of him. With this prudent resolve, he threw himself along the bed in the spare-room, and was oblivious of everything sub- lunary until sunrise. "If there should be any change, call me!"Mrs. Aylett had enjoined, plaintively. Winston will not hear of my sitting up, but I shall not close my eyes all night, so do not hesitate to disturb me, if I can be of any use whatever." Which, it is idle to remark, was the last thing either of the nurses thought of doing. If their darling were, in truth, dying, they were the fittest persons to receive her latest sigh; for had they not been present at her birth, and did not her mother go to glory from their supporting arms I   /BOR/Y DEAD."        269 There was a change, and not a favorable one, before daybreak. The patient, from mutterings and restless starts, passed into violent delirium, laughing, crying, and singing in a style so opposed to the prescribed di- agnosis of- her case, as to lash the provincial doctor to his wits' end, and extinguish in Aunt Rachel's sanguine heart the faint hope to which she had clung until now. Herbert, awakened finally by the turbulent sounds from the room he had been told must be kept perfectly quiet, jumped up, and showed himself, with disordered hair and blinking eyes, in the door of communication, just as Mabel struggled to rise, and pleaded weepinglyM with those who held her down that they would restore her child to her. "I had her in my arms not a moment ago!" she insisted. "See! the plint of her little head is here on my breast! You have taken her away among you  I saw it all - those who ordered that it should be done, and those who did it, when I was too weak to hold her, or to keep them back!" And passing from the height of furious invective to deadly and earnest calm, she told them off upon her 'fingers. "Clara Aylett Rosa Tazewell! Winston AylettI (he married Clara Louise Dorrance, you know!) Her- bert Dorrance! J-ulius Lenno!" The household was astir by this time, and Mrs. Ay- lett entered from the hall as her brother did from his   270       "BOXN DEA." bedkoom. There was but one spectator who was suffl- ciently composed to note and marvel at the scared look exchanged by the two at the sound of the last name. This was Mr. Aylett, who, from his position behind his wife, had an excellent view of all the actors in the excit- ing tableau before she fell back, swooning, in his arms.                   D He was alone with her in their chamber when she re- vived, and the earliest effort of her restored conscious- ness was to seize both his hands in hers, and scan his face searchingly--it would seem agonizingly--until his fond smile dispelled the unspoken dread. "Ah!" she murmured, hiding her face upon his bosom, "she is still alive, then! I thought--I thought" - a mighty sob --"Don't despise your weak, silly wife, darling I but it was very terrible I I believed it was the last struggle, and was appalled at the sight. And my poor Herbert.! he Gas frightfully overcome. Did you notice him? Will you send him to me, dear? I can soothe him better than any one else--prepare him for what is, I fear, inevitable. I shall not give way again to my terrors." The brother and sister were still together when word was brought, two hours later, that Mabel had fallen in- to a profound sleep - a good omen, the doctor said. "Thank Heaven!" ejaculated Herbert, fervently, his eyes softening until he turned away to conceal his emotion.    "BORN DEAD."        271 He was haggard with solicitude, while Mrs. Aylett's healthful bloom betokened slight interest in the ter- mination of the seizure, a glance at which had thrown her into a faint. Nor did she echo the thanksgiving. She waited until the messenger had gone, and contin- ued the conversation her entrance had interrupted. "I incline to the belief that she caught the name, in some manner, on Christmas before last. He was delirious, too, and although doctor and nurse reported that he did not speak articulately after he was brought in, she may have heard more -than they. From what has been told me, I gather that she was in the room with him alone, while Mrs. Sutton was downstairs looking for Dr. Ritchie. In a lucid interval he may have given his name-possibly some particulars of his history. Unless--are you positive there has been no indiscretion on your part, or that others may. have talked negligently to her, because she was a mem- ber of the family?"  "There are topics of which we- your mother, sis- ter, and brothers--never speak, even to one another. You may trust us that far," rejoined Herbert, em- phatically. "Nor do I see what we can do, except wait for other proof that Mabel really kniess anything beyond a name she has picked up at random and never, to my knowledge, repeated, save in herravings. Should she recover, the test can be easily applied, and we can judge then, how to handle the dilemma."   27f2       "OBRO   DEAD."

For nine .. years the wallet taken from his person had lain unopened in a hidden drawer of Mabel Dorrance's escritoire, and the half-guessed secret been hidden in her breast. Mammy Phillis had followed her mistress to the tomb, six months after her removal from her beloved cottage to the despised " quarters." She never held up her head from the' day of her degradation; died from a broken heart, murmured those who best knew her--of a "fit of spleen," said Mrs. Aylett, in cool reprehension of her unmannerly vassal. Mabel had guarded the mystery well. Her husband examined her--covertly, as he thought; awkwardly,ac- cording to her ideas-with regard to the vagaries of her delirium, and was foiled by the grave simplicity of her manner and replies.

Herbert jotted down in his notes for his sister's peru- sal: "she has associated in some way--she cannot tell exactly how or why - the name with the tramp who died in the garret. She is not sure that it was his designation. Thinks it was not, or that, if used by him, it was an alias. Has an impression that it was marked upon his clothing, or upon a paper found in his pocket. Showed no agitation and little interest in the subject, except when she inquired if I saw the stranger at all -living or dead.

"Lawyerly! ergo, absurd and unsatisfactory!" pro- nounced the reader, to whom the foregoing leaf had been committed on the morning of her brother's de- parture with his slowly-convalescing wife for tfeir Albany home. "But until the nettle prifcks more nearly, I shall continue to enjoy my roses." They had blossomed thickly about her path during this decade. 7Her matronly beauty was the wonder and - praise of the community. The changing seasons that had bleached the locks upon her husband's temples and heightened his forehead had spared the bronzed chestnut   THE 0GOOD SAARITAN.       275 fuller, but graceful, and more queenly than of yore - if that could be. There was not an untuneful inflec- tion in her voice, or a furrow between her brows. Under her careful management the homestead wore every year an air of increased elegance. No other furniture for many miles on both sides of the river could compare with hers; no other servants were so well-trained, no grounds so beautifully ornamented and trimly kept. "But for all that Ridgeley is a lonely, desolate place to me," said Mrs. Sutton, one early spring morning to her niece and crony, Mrs. William Sutton. "A house without children is worse than a last yearns bird's nest. It is a riddle to me how Clara Aylett contrives to occupy her time." "She should have some of these socks to darn, if it hangs upon her hands," replied Mrs. William, humor- ously, running her five fingers through the toe of one she had just picked up from the great willow basket set between the two upon the porch-floor. "The Lord isn't very apt to make mothers out of that sort of material," said the elder lady. "Nor fathers out of Winston Ayletts. They are-so wrapped up in their self-consequence as to have no thought for others." "Yet they say Mr. Aylett regrets that he has no heir. It is a great pity Mabel lost her only child as   276     T   't' GOOD, SA VA RITALN . she did. The family will become 'extinct in anoth -generation.

Her darning-needle quilted the yawning heel, Tommy Sutton's sock with precision and celerity, ar she ruminated silently upon the vicissitudes and fai ures of mortal life until she was interrupted by Mi William's exclamation: "There is Mrs. Tazewell's carriage at the gate, an the driver has a letter in his hand.

Mrs. Sutton wiped her spectacles and gave the note to her niece. "There is but one thing for me to do, you see, my dear. Jack!

"My child!" she, ejaculated, upon the threshold, "you did not tell me that you were confined to your bed!" "I ought not to be!" The rebellious pout and tone were Rosa's, as were also the black eyes-unnaturally large and bright though they were - but the pretty lips were wan, and strained by lines of pain; the pomegranate flush was no longer variable, and was nestled in hollows, and the hands were wasted to translucency.

"For whom else should I live and work-?" laughed Mrs. Sutton, in her cheerful, guileless fashion. "My personal wants are few and easily supplied, and I like to be busy. I account it a privilege to be able to fuss about my friends when they are ailing." By way of doing as she liked, she attacked the dis- orderly room. Rosa's three trunks stood in a row against the wall - all of them open- the tray of the largest lying beside it upon the carpet, the lid of this thrown back and the contents in utter confusion; laces hanging over the sides and trailing upon the floor. A casket of medicines was uppermost in the next trunk, crushing a confused medley of collars, ribbons, gloves, and handkerchiefs. A dressing-gown lay upon the seat of one chair, a skirt over' the back of another; boots and slippers peeped from the valance of the an- tique bedstead; there was a formidable array of bottles upon mantel and bureau-conspicuous among them cod-liver oil, cologne, and laudanum-incongrubus appendages to the various appliances of the toilette scattered between them.   ^----280    ad'1W GOOD -SA RAITAN. fion 'of the unlooked-for arrival; the faintness and prostration of the consumptive; the restless night, and the well-meant but inefficient ministrations of negroes in an establishminentwhere the mistress had been feeble for years, and was now chained to her- room and chair by paralysis.

"My Mabel was a pink of neat- ness and order compared with her. Dear me! here is a bottle of oil, cracked, and an immense grease-spot in the. front breadth of a splendid silk dress I hope these things do not annoy her as they would me!" Whether the universal disarray made Rosa uncom- fortable or not, she enjoyed the aspect of the tidy apartment, when- her nurse brought her noiseless labors to a close by exchanging her night-gown for a flannel wrapper; putting clean linen upon her and the bed; combing the tangled hair and washing her' hands, wrists, and face in tepid water, interfused with co- logne, "It prevents, a sick person from taking cold when bathed, and freshens her up wonderfully, I think," was her explanation of the fragrant preparation.

She ' couldn't bear to have men around, cluttering up everything!' she would growl the instant his back was turned, with a deal more of the same talk, until I was afraid to ask him to take a seat the next time he came in. He was continually bringing home baskets of fruit, and game and bouquets for me. She let me have, the flowers, but she ate nine-tenths of the nice thngs herself, I never suspecting her, and he was too delicate to asl if I enjoyed his presents. At length he surprised her in the act: of devouring a bunch of hot-house grapes, for which he had paid almost their weight in gold, and then all came to light, and he sent her off in a hurry.

"He is kind! too kind!" murmured Rosa, compos- ing herself among the cushions, as if to sleep. She was quiet so long that Mrs. Sutton had leisure for some reflections relating to her own personal action   THE  GOOD SAMARITAy.      283 in the somewhat embarrassing position she occupied. She had never seen Frederic Chilton from the day he left Ridgeley as Mabel's betrothed. His visits to the neighborhood since his marriage had been few and brief, and she had studied to avoid him whenever she happened to be with the William Suttons during one of these. He might have guessed her design, or un- wittingly favored it on his own account. The meeting could not be more pleasant to him than to her. - But why had he allowed his wife to send for her? The alteration in him must indeed be great, if he could, witho-t a conflict with resentful and painful memories bow his pride to sue for the services of a relative of the Ayletts, and formerly one of their household, even in such a cause as that which now commanded her sym- pathies. At -his point of her cogitation she, became aware that Rosa's eyes were wide open, and staring at her with a whimsical blending of curiosity, melancholy, and gratification. "Aunt Rachel!" she said, bluntly, "you are a very good woman! the best and most forgiving human being I ever heard of. I should not feel one particle of surprise to see you float up gently through the roof, at any minute -cap, spectacles, and all -translated to the society of your sister angels --and no questions asked by St. Peter at the gate of Paradise!"

Above all, she should not be allowed to exhaust herself by talking, or hysterical paroxysms. She 'had no more self-control than a child, and she must be treated' as such.

Fortified by this resolution, she heard, without any show of pride or trepidation, the clatter of horses' hoofs in the yard; the sound of voices below stairs, as Mr. Chiltoh ushered the physician into the parlor, and the 'light, careful tread with which he mounted to his wife's apartment. His momentary pause at the entrance, and surprised look at beholding the other tenant of the chamber, were the best passport to herindulgence he could have desired. It was clear to her instantly that poor Rosa's passion for manoeuvring had survived the wreck of health and prostration of spirits. She had never chosen the straight path' if she could find a crooked or a by-road, and her project for obtaining Mrs. Sutton's services and company had been put into exe- cution, without consultation with her husband. How- ever reprehensible this might be in the abstract, it was not in the kind old soul to betray her, as she advanced, placidly and civilly, to-reassure the startled man. "How are you, Mr. Chilton . You hardly expected   THEI 0OOD SAMARITAN.     287 to meet me here, I suppose? But I am a near neighbor of Mrs. Tazewell now, and hearing that Rosa was sick, I came over to se? if I could do anything for her, knowing how infirm her mother is." "You are very kindl" He grasped her hand more tightly than he intended, or was conscious of. "We were ignorant ourselves of Mrs. Tazewell's true con- dition. Mrs. Chilton's sisters have forwarded more en- couraging reports to her of her mothers illness than they would have been warranted in doing by anything except 'the fear that a faithful accountwould operate injuriously upon the daughter's health. I should have chosen some other home for my wife, had I known the actual state of affairs here. Change of scene and cli- mate was imperatively demanded." He spoke low and rapidly Lhardly above his breath; but the black eyes, unclosing, flashed upon him. "So you have come back!" said Rosa's weak voice. "You stayed away an eternity!' Her coquettish displeasure and the asperity of her accent contrasted so oddly with her vehemently ex- pressed attachment for her husband and extolment of his virtues, that Mrs. Sutton regarded her in speechless amazement. She submitted, to his kiss, without return- ing it -even raising her hand pettishy as to repel fur- ther endearments. "I should have died of the blue devils if Aunt Rachel hadn't, by the merest accident, heard that I was ailing, and driven over, like the Good   -288     Yt' GO 00D SA MA RITAN. Samaritan she is, to take pity upon me in my destitu- tion; to pour oil - not cod-liver - into my wounds, and wine into my mouth. She is better thani all the men- doctors that were ever created; so if you have brought your bearded Esculapius hope with you, you may tell him, with my compliments, hat I won't see him yet awhile. He was an old beau of mine, and I hope I have too much respect for what I used to be, to let himn get a glimpse of me until Dr. Sutton has set me up in ,better flesh and looks. She brought me some enchant- oing jelly-one of her magical preparations for the amelioration of human misery, and I am to have a bowl of her unparalleled chicken-broth for dinner. I wish dinner-time were come the very thought makes me ravenous. I am to do nothing for a week, but eat, drink, and sleep, at the end of which period I shall be dismissed as thoroughly cured. So, Mr. Chilton, you can go back to your beloved clients whenever you please " To Mrs. Sutton's apprehension this was an infelici- tous introduction of herself to the husband's toleration. Certainly, she did not know many men who would have parried the thrusts at themselves with the dexterity he manifested, and acknowledged her merits and kindly offices willingly and gracefully. He did not apologize for his protracted absence, nor insist upon conveying his physician to the sick-chamber; but he chatted for five minutes or thereabouts upon such topics as he   X THE GOOD SAMnRI TA..     289 knew would entertain the captious invalid, and finally arose from the bed-side, where he had been sitting, fondling her hot hands, with a good-humored laugh. "But all the while I am enjoying myself here, the hirsute Galen aforesaid is munching the invisible-salad of the solitary in the parlor I am to eject him, incontinently, am I? My conscience will not let me withhold the admission, when I do this, that my wife's judgment in the matter of medical attendants is vastly superior to mine. While Mrs. Sutton is so good as to remain with you, you are right in thinking that you have need of no other physician." Aunt Rachel would have entered a disclaimer, but Rosa spoke before she could open her mouth. "I didn't say that, Frederic!  There was never such another impatient and inconsiderate creature upon the globe as yourself. It would be unpardonably rude in us to send the man away, if he is a charlatan, without letting him see me. Have him up, by all means, and let us hear what priggish nonsense he has to say. He will feel the easier when it is done." Dr. Ritchie's private report to Mrs. Sutton, who ac- companied him to the lower floor, under color of seeing that he was served with luncheon, was discouraging. The disease had made fearful inroads Upon a constitu- tion that had never been robust, and the nervous excit- ability of the patient was likely to accelerate her de- cline.  She might linger for severalmonths. It would -I1   290     tAis GOOD ,SAIMARITAN. not surprise him to hear that she had died within twelve hours after his visit. It was but fair and professional, he added, that he should, through Mrs. Sutton, ad- vise Mr. Chilton of her state, although, munless he were mistaken, he had already anticipated his verdict. This Mrs.- Sutton found was the case, when she es- sayed that evening to insure him against the awful shock of his wife's unexpected dissolution. "She has never been entirely well since the death of our second child, a year ago, ihe said. "The little one was buried on a very stormy day, and the mother would not be dissuaded from going to the cemetery. The severe cold, acting upon a system enfeebled by grief, induced an attack of pneumonia. Dr. Ritchie but coincides with every other physician I have con- suited." "It is a pity you are obliged to leave her so soon," observed the sympathizing nurse. "Although she may be more comfortable a week hence than she is now."

S HE shadow of death drew on apace to the sight of all, save the consumptive, and her seimi-imbe- f cile mother. These seemed alike blind to the 'G fatal symLptoms that were more strongly defined with every passing day. The paralytic, sat in her wheeled chair, in the March sunshine, at the window of her chamber, and talked droningly of other times and paltry pleasures to that one of her daughters or grand- children whose turn it was to minister to her comfort and amusement, and insisted upon having all the neigh- borhood news repeated ini her dull ear with wearisome -to the narrator--amplifications and reiterations, sbaking with childish laughter at the humorous pas- sages, and whimpering at the pathetic. Rosa cheated time of heaviness by. unceasing demands upon her at- tendants for service and diversion. Unable to sleep, except at long intervals, in snatches of fitful dozing, she had a horror of being alone for an instant, from dusk until dawn; was ingenious in contrivances to sur- (292\   ItMJ zONEST HOUR       293 prise an unwary watcher nodding upon her post; plenteous and plaintive in lamentations, if the device succeeded. Fifty times a night her pillows must be shaken, her drink, food, or medicine given, and after each of these offices had been performed, occurred the petition: N Now-sit where I can see you whenever I open my eyes,! It drives me crazy to imagine for a mo- ment that I am by myself. I want to be sure all the while that some living human being is near at hand. I have such frightful dreamsl I awake always 'with the impression that I am drowning or suffocating, or floating-away into a sea of darkness alone!" With the light of day, her spirits revived, and her hopes of speedy recovery.  "You need not grudge waiting upon me now, for I shall be up and about shortly-well and spry as the best of you!" she would say. "And while I am play- ing invalid, I mean to have my quantum of attention. I have been avaricious of devotion all my life, and this is a golden c:hance that may never happen again." Her laLsband she would not willingly stffer to leave her for an instant. But for Mrs. Sutton's management and kindly authority, he would have been condemned to take lis meals at her bedside and from the same tray with herself. She would be removed from the bed to the lounge by no other arms than his, and at any hour of the twenty-four he was liable to be called   3i9.YW9 HEONEST HOUBR upon to read, sing, or talk her into composure. Varia- ble as ever in mood and fancy, and more capricious in the exhibition of these, she was fond, sullen, teasing, and mirthful with him as the humor of the moment dictated; sometimes assailing him with reproaches for his indifference and want of regard for her wishes and tastes, now that -she was no longer young, pretty, and sprightly; at others, clinging to him with protestations of repentance and love, bewailing her waywardness and imploring ,his forbearance; then, taking him to task for the slightest inadvertence -the spilling of a drop of h'r medicine or jarring of her sofa or bed; anon lauding him to the skies as the most skilful nurse she had, and enjoining upon all about her to render verbal testimonial to his irreproachableness as husband and- man--oh   it was a wearisome, oftentimes a re- volting duty to listen to and bear with it all-keep in mind though one did that the intolerable restlessness preluded centuries of dreamless repose. Mrs. Sutton could endure everything else better- and she believed that it was the same with Frederic- than the needless and puerile trickery to which Rosa resorted to achieve the most trivial purposes. If she wished that one of her sisters should pass the day with her, or (t sit up for a part of the night,'she worled upon her by means of others' intercessions; or broached the subject by covert passages, the end of wlich, she flattered herself, was successfully -nasked, until her   THE HOZ EST HlOU       295 train was ready for explosion. Did she set her fancy upon any particular article of diet, the same tortuous course was pursued to present the delicacy in question to the mind of him or her who, she designed, should be the provider. Under her sauciest rattle of fun or per- versity lurked some subtle meaning. She had either some end to subserve, or wanted to possess herself of some bit of information she could have gained sooner and, more easily by direct inquiry. Cajolery and in- trigue had become a second nature, stronger than the original; and it never occurred to her that her wiles, in her mental and bodily decadence, were transparent as they had onice been artful.           i A discovery, made on the fourth day of her visit, ex- cited Mrs. Sutton's sympathies in behalf of the much- enduring husband to a pitch it required long and serious pondering upon the wife's weakness and critical condition to restrain from indignant demonstration. Rosa was sleeping more soundly than usual under the influence of an anodyne, and Frederic, with a whispered apology to his coadjutor, went into the next room, leaving the door ajar. From her seat, Mrs. Sut- ton had a distinct view of him in an opposite mirror- a circumstance of which-she was not aware for several minutes. Happening, then, to look up from her knit- ting she saw that he was writing, and half an hour af- terward that he was leaning back in his chair, looking at something in the hollow of his hand, a miugling of   296      THE iHONEST HOUR. such love and sadness in his countenance that she felt it would be unlawful prying into his most sacred f el- ings for her to watch him longer. He turned his head at the slight rustle she made in removing to anotier part of the room, and beckoned to her. At her ap- pioach, he arose and held out a morocco case, contain- ing the miniature of a child - a bright-eyed, delicate- featured girl of seven or eight summers - exquisitely painted. "You have never seen my little Florence, I think . " "I have not. She is pretty- and resembles you strongly." He did not color or laugh -at the unconscious com- pliment, or seem pleased at her praise of his darling. Instead, there crept over his face a shade of more painful sadness, darkening his eyes and compressing his lip, as he answered. "So every one says. She is the dearest child in the world--a sunbeam of gladness in any house -amia- ble, affectionate, and intelligent. I wish you would read her last letter to me. She is a better correspon- dent than many grown people." Then, smiling, apolo- getically, "If my commendation seem overstrained, you will excuse a father's partiality." The letter-although the unformed chirography betrayed the writer's inexperience in pen-practice-- was correctly spelled and easy in style, crowded with  loving messages to " dear papa and mamma;;" relating   *'      THE HO NEST HO$UR.      297 anecdotes of school and home life, and while express- ive of her longings for her parents' return, professing willingness to stay where she was "until mamma should be well enough to come back." "I pray every night that God will cure- her, and make us all happy again," she wrote. "I dreamed one night last week that I saw her dressed for a party, all rosy and funny and laughing, as she used to be, and that she kissed me, and put her arm around me, and called me ' baby Florence' and 'little one,' in her sweet voice. Wasn't it strange? I awoke myself crying, I was so happy! I do try to be brave, and not fret about what cannot be helped, papa, because I promised you I would; but sometimes it is right hard work. It is always easier for a whole day after I get one 6f your nice, long letters. It is not quite as good as having real talk with-you, but it is the best treat I can have when you are away." Mrs. Sutton wiped her eyes. "The dear child!"I she said, in the subdued tone habitual to the frequenters of the sick-room. "No wonder you want to see herI Why didn't you give her a holiday, and bring her to Virginia with you " "I dreaded the effect of a child's high animal spirits and thoughtless bustle upon her mother's health"- the shadow thickening into trouble. "The next best thing to having her with me is to know that she is kindly and lovingly looked after by my married sister, 13*   1:B HONEST HOUR . of whom she is very fond. Florence is merrier, if not always happier, with her young cousins than if she were condemned to the repression and joyless routine of a house where the care of the sick is the most en- grossing business to all." The more Mrs. Sutton meditated upon this conversa- tion, the more enigmatical it appeared that the mother never spoke of missing her only living child--never pined for the sound of her vivacious talk and the sight of her winning ways. Curiosity -her strong love for all children, and a lively interest in Florence and Florence's father, the two who assuredly did feel the separation-got the ascendency over discretion that night, when Rosa, too nervous to sleep, begged her to talk, "to scare away the horrors that were sitting, a blue-black brood, upon her pillow." "Your little daughter would be an endless source of entertainment to you if she were here," said downright Aunt Rachel, with no show of circumlocution. "I am surprised you do not send for her." "Children of that age are a nuisance!" returned Rosa, peevishly. " And of all tiresome ones that I ever saw, Florence is the most trying. She doesn't talk after I bid her hold her tongue, but her big, solemn eyes see and her ears hear all that passes. If there is one thing that pushes me nearer to the verge of dis- traction than' another it is to have my own words quoted to me when I have forgotten that I ever uttered   them. And she - literal little bore!-- is always pre- tending to take all that I say in earnest. If I were to tell her to go to Guinea, it is my belief she would put on her bonnet, cloak, and gloves, pocket a biscuit for luncheon and a story-book to read by the way, and set out forthwith, asking the first decent-looking man she met in the street at what wharf she would find a vessel bound for Africa." Mrs. Sutton was obliged to laugh. "She must be a truthful, sincere little thing I" "Didn't I tell you she is too outrageously literal and unimaginative ? Just let me give you an example of how she tires and vexes me. One day, about a fort- night before I left home, she set her heart upon spend- ing the whole of Saturday afternoon with me. Her father objected, for he understands, if he does not sympathize with me, what a trial she is to flesh and spirit. But I was moderately comfortable, and my nerves were less unruly thar usual, so I said we would try and get on together. "No sooner had he gone than the catechism com- menced: "'Now, mamma, what can I do to amuse you ' "She talks like a woman of fifty., "' What should you propose f I were to leave it to you ' I asked. "'I suppose,' said my Lady Cutshort, 'that it would   300  ,    THE   HONEST HOUR. excite you too much to talk, so I had better read aloud. What book do you prefer .' "I named one-a novel I had not finished--and resigned myself to martyrdom. She reads fluently- her father says prettily; but the piping voice rasped my auriculars to the quick, and I soon stopped the ex- hifition. Then we essayed conversation, but our range of themes was limited, and a dismal silence succeeded  to a short dialogue. [By and by I told her that I was sleepy, hoping she would take the, hint and leave my room. "'Then, mamma, I will just get my whrk-basket, and sit here, as still as a mouse, and prevent all dis- turbance.' "With that, she gets out her miniature thimble and scissors, and falls, to work upon a pair of slippers she was embroidering for her father's birthday present, sitting up, starched and prim as an old maid, her lips pursed, and her forehead gravely consequential. I could not close my eyes without seeing her still, like an undersized nightmare, her hair smooth to the least hair, her dress neat to the smallest fold, stitching, stitching, the affected, conceited marmoset'l '"At last I said:, "' Put down your sewing, Florence, and look out of the window at the people going by. You must be very tired.' I "Not in the least, mammf, dear,' answered Miss   T'H HOXEST HOUR       301 Pert. 'I like to work, and there is nothing interesting going on outside.' "I tossed and sighed, and she was by me in a sec- ond. "' Darling mamma! my poor, sweet little mother I' in her reed-like chirp; ' can I do nothing to make you feel better' putting her hands upon my head and stroking my face until my flesh crawled. "' Yes,' said I, out of all patience. 'Take yourself off, and don't let me see you again until to-morrow morning! You kill me with your teasing.' "And would you believe it? she just put up her sewing in the basket and went directly out, without a tear or a murmur, and when- her father came home lie could not prevail upon her, by conrnands or persua- sions, to accompany him further than the door of my chamber. So he, who won't admit that she can do any- thing wrong, instead of whipping her for her obstinacy, as he ought to have done, guessed she 'had some rea- son' for her disobedience which she did not like to tell, and interrogated poor, persecuted me. When he had heard my version of the manner in which we had spent the afternoon, he only said, 'I should have fore- seen this. But the child -she is only a child, Rosa I -did her best!' and he looked so mournful that I, knowing he blamed me for his bantling's freak of tem- per, told him plainly that he cared a thousand times more for this diminutive bundle of hypocrisy than he   802    ..'tSJ -HBrONEST HOUR ever did for me, and that his absurd favoritism was ?'fast begetting in me a positive dislike for her. I couldn't endure the sight of the sulky little mischief- maker for a week after her complaint of barbarity had brought the look into his face I knew so well." "O Rosa, she is your own flesh and blood! and, as her father said, a mere baby yet I You said, too, that she refused to assign any cause to him for her singular conduct." "She might better have made open outcry than have left upon his mind the impression that I had banished her cruelly and unnecessarily. 13ut I despair of giv. ing you an idea of how provoking she can be. She is a Chilton, through and through, in feature, manner, and disposition-one of those 'goody' children, you know! a class of aSimals that are simply intolerable to me, She is too precocious and unbaby-like to be in the least interesting. You should have seen my little Violet to understand what a constant disappointment Florence is. She was myself in miniature; and more- over the most witching, prankish, peppery elf that was ever made.. The best trait in Florence's character was her love for her baby-sister. She gave up everything to her while she was alive, and they told me that she would not eat, and scarcely slept, for days after ler death. Her father will have it that she is singularly sensitive, and has marvellous depths of feeling; but if this be so, it is queer I never found it out. Nobody   "T' HON:E6s T HOR       3 could help adoring Violet--my sweet, lost, beautiful angel " The hysterical sobs were pumping up the tears now in hot torrents, and these Mrs. Sutton was fain to as- suage by loving art she would not - but for the dan- ger of allowing them to flow - have been in the tem- per to employ, so full was her heart of yearning pity for the hardly-used babe, and displeasure  at the mother's weak selfishness. It was easier to forgive and forget Rosa's sins; to lessen, in the retrospect, her worst faults into foibles, than it would have been to overlook the more venal failings of one less mercurial, and whose personal fascinations did not equal hers. Ere the close of another day, Mrs. Sutton had ex- cused her unnatural insensibility to her child's virtues and affection, by representing to herself how fearfully disease had warped judgment and perception; had cast over the enormities she could not palliate the pall of solemn remembrance of the truth that. death's dark door was already as surely shut between mother and  daughter, as if the grave held the former. A week of chill March rains and wind was disastrous to the pa-  tient, who had seemed to draw her main supplies of strength from the sunshine admitted freely to her room, with the spring air, redolent with the delicious odors of the freshy-turned earth, the budding trees, and early blossoms from the garden beneath her win- dows. She shrank and shivered under the ungenial   804  a       HO1' NST H ONEST OUR. sky, while the drizzling mist soaked life and anima- tion out of the fragile body. Occasional fits of de- lirium, increased difficulty of breathing, and a steady decline of the slender remains of vital force, warned her attendants that their care would not be required much longer. She was still obstinate in her disbelief of the grave nature of her malady. The most distant reference to her decease would arouse her to angry refutation of the hinted doubt of her recovery, and excited her to offer proof of her declaration that she was less ill than others supposed; she would summon up a poor counterfeit of energy and mirth, more ghastly than her previous lassitude; deny that she suffered from any cause, save the unfailing nervous depression consequent upon the unfavorable weather.  . Then came a day on which the sun looked fortli with augmented splendor from his sombrely curtained pavilion ;when the naked branches of the deciduous trees, the serried lances of the evergreens, and the broad leaves of the, tent-like magnolias - the pride of the Tazewell place-shone as from a bath of molten silver. The battered flowers ventured into later and healthier bloom, and a robin, swinging, upon the lilac spray nearest Rosa's window, sang blithe greeting to the reinstated spring. Rosa heard him- opened her eyes, and smiled. "One -maybe the very same-- used' to sing there every morning when I was a girl-- used to awake me \       .    .  I .   J E.

A messenger had been sent, at daybreak, for her sis- ters and brother, who resided several miles away, but as yet ]Mrs. Sutton and Frederic were her ohly nurses. She had dozed allmost constantly during the night, and been delirious when awakened to take nourishment or ! tonics, muttering senseless and disconnected words, and moaning in pain, the location and nature of which she could not describe to the solicitous watchers. "I remember that Mabel and I," she continued, dreamily, after a long pause then correcting herself, "I ask your pardon, Frederic! I said I wouldn't speak of her ever again to you, but we were so much together in those days. Moreover, it has troubled me at times, that you did not know who your real friends were, and she did like you--and -an-what am I saying! You shouldn't let me run on so!" She raised her hand with difficulty, and tried to wipe away the film gathering over her dilated eyes. "Never mind, my darling I Do not attempt to talk I You are too weak and tired!" said her husbands ten- derly. "Tired!" catching at the word. "That is it!

He now laid it by, and came forward into the redder circle of radiance cast by the burning logs. He was in his forty-third year, saturnine of visage, coldly monotonous in accent, a businessa machine that did its work in good, substantial style, and undertook no "'fancy jobs.") He had amassed a handsome fortune, built a handsome house, and married a handsome wo- man, all of which appendages to his consequence he contemplated with grim complacency. As regarded spiritual likeness, mutual affection, and assimilation of feeling and opinion, he and his wife had receded, the one from the other, in the fourteen years of their wedded life There had been no decided rupture. Both disliked altercations, and where radical opposition of sentiment existed, they avoided the unsafe ground by tacit consent. ,Mabel's uniform policy was that of outward submission to the mandates of her chief.

He respected her thoroughly, and loved her better than he did anybody else. She was the one woman he recognized as his sister's superior--supremacy due to the influence of single-minded integrity and modest dignity. What Mabel said, he believed without gainsay-! ing; while Clara's clever dicta required winnowing to separate the probably spurious from the possibly true. If his tone, in addressing his wife, was seldom affec- tionate, it was never careless, as that which replied to his sister's raillery. "Generally," he said in his metallic, unmodulated voice. "The man who would cast away health, useful- ness, and fortune in his chagrin at not winning the hand of a shallow-pated, volatile flirt, must be both silly and susceptible."

Father and child live with a married sister of Mrs. Chilton, I believe." "I had not heard that Rosa left a child," remarked Mabel, interested. "I understood that two died before the mother."  "Only one--and that the younger, Miss Florence is Pow twelve years old, Mrs. Trent says. I saw her at church once, when she was visiting her grandmother and aints. She is really passable-but very unlike her mother."            , Mabel did not join in the desuloy talk that engaged the others until supper-time. There was a broken string in her heart, that jangled painfully when touched by an incautious hand. "Twelve years oldl'" she was saying, inwardly.

Warm arms were about her neck, and a round, soft cheek laid against hers-as no human arms and face would ever caress her-her, the child- less, whose had been the hopes, fears, pains-never the recompence of maternity. She had been to the graveyard that day--secretly, lest her husband should frown, Clara wonder, and Win- ston sneer at her love for and memory of that which had never existed, according to their rendering of the term She had trimmed the wire-grass out of the little hollow, above which the mound had not been renewed since the day of her baby's burial, and, trusting to the infre-  qnencey of others' visits to the neglected enclosure, had  laid a bunch of white rose-buds over thie unmarked dust sheaccounted still a part of her heart, 'neath which it had lain so long.

"My dear Winston, you must recollect what an in. sufferable headache I had that day." "Don't have one to-day," ordered her husband lacon- ically. "Mabel, do you care to go?"  "By all means. I would not fail, even in seeming, in rendering respect to one I used to like so much, and whose kindness-to me was unvarying. You have ho objection, Herbert?"      I         "None. I may accompany you--the day being fine, and the roads in tolerable order." The funeral was conducted with the disregard of what are, in other regions, established customs that dis- tinguish such occasions in the rural districts of Vir- glnla. Written notices had been sent out, far and near, the day before, announcing that the services would begin at two, o'clock, but when the Aylett party arrived at a quarter of an hour before the time specified, there was no appearance of regular exercises of any kind. A dozen carriges besides theirs were clustered about the front gate, and a long line of saddle-horses tethered to the fence. Knots of gentlemen in riding costume dotted the lawn and porches, and within-doors ladies sat, or walked at their ease in the parlor and dining- room, or gathered in silent tearfulness around the open coffin in the wide central hall. The bed-room of the deceased was a roomy apalrt- ,        .    .

"Miss Mary's compliments and love, ma'am; and she says won't you please step in thar, and set with Mistis' friends and relations I' was the audible message deliv- ered to her by Mrs. Trent's spry waiting-maid. Herbert looked dubious, and Mrs. Aylett enlarged her fine eyes in a manner that might mean either su- perciliousness or well-bred amazement.- But Mabel was neither surprised nor doubtful  as to the proper * course fort her to pursue. Time was when she was as much at home here as Rosa herself, and Mrs. Tazewell's partiality for her was shared by others of the family. That she had met none of them in ten or twelve years, did not at a season like the present dampen their affec- tion. They would rather oil this acconmt seize upon the opportunity of honoring publicly their mother's old favorite. The chamber was less light than the hall she traversed to reach it. She recognized Mary Trent, the daughter next in age to Rosa, who fell upon her neck in a sobbing em- brace, then the other sisters and their brother, Morton i Tazewell, with his wife, and was formally presented to their children. Finally she turned inquiringly toward a gentleman who stood against the window opposite the door, with a little girl beside him.   316     A FTR FIFTEEN YEARS.

"I hope you are quite well, Mr. Chilton," said XIa- bel'Ps firm, gentle voice. "Is this your daughter." kissing' the serious-faced child on the forehead, and looking intently into her eyes in the hope of discovering a resemblance to her mother. Then she went back to a chair next to-- Mrs. Trent's, and began to talk softly of the event that had called them together, not glancing again at the window until the outer hall was stilled, that the clergyman might begin the funeral prayer. "The services will be concluded at the grave," was the announcement that succeeded the sermon; and there followed the shuffling of the bearers' feet, and. their measured tramp across the floor and down the steps of the back porch.     l '    PA   AFT. EI FIFTTEEN YEARS.    317 The daughters and daughter-in-law let fall their veils and pulled on their gloves, and Herbert Dorrance beckoned somewhat impatiently to his wife from the parlor door. While she was on her way to join him, she saw his complexion vary to a greenish sallow, his mouth work spasmodically, and his eyes sink in anger or dismay. Winston Aylett likewise noted and knew it, for the same look of abject terror he had observed upon the hard Scotch face when Mabel enumerated upon her fingers those she accused of having robbed her of her babe. The wife attributed it to displeasure at seeing Fred- eric Chilton  among the mourners.   Her whilom guardian, never charitable overmuch, inclined the more to the belief begotten within him by other inci- dents, to wit: that his brother-in-law's talk was more doughty than his 'deeds, and his real sentiment upon beholding the man he boasted of having flogged as a libertine and coward, was physical dread for his own safety. Watchful alike of the other party to the an- cient quarrel, he was rewarded by the sight of Chilton's irrepressibly start and frown, when Mabel put her hand within her husband's arm, and stood awaiting the formation of the procession. The discarded; lover gazed steadfastly into Dorrance's countenance in pass- ing to his place, in recognition that scouted assimilarity   318     AFTER  IFPTEEN YEARS. with salutation, but his eye did not waver or his color fade. "I would not be afraid to wager that this is but another version of the fable of the statue of the man rampant and the lioi couchant," thought Mr. Aylett, following with his wife in the funeral train down the grass-grown alley leading through the garden to the family burying-ground. "It would be an entertaining study of human veracity if I could hear Chilton's story, and compare the two. He is either an audacious ras- cal, or there is something back of all that I have heard which will not bear the light." It was not remorse at the thought of the total altera- tion in his sister's life and feelings that had grown out of this imperfect or false evidence, but simple curiosity to inspect the'lineaments and note the actions of the cool rascal whose audacity commanded his admiration, and note his bearing in the event of his coming into closer contact with his former foe, that prompted him to single him out for 'scrutiny among those whose rela- tionship to the deceased secured them places nearest the grave. F- For a time the widower was gravely quiet, holding ris child's hand and looling down steadfastly into the pit at his feet, perhaps remembering more vividly than anything else a certain sunny, day in March, many years back, when another fissure yawned close by, where now a green mound-the ridged scar with \   AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS.      319 which the earth had closqd the wound in her breast - and a stately shaft of white marble were all that re- mained to the world of "Rosa, wife of Frederic Chil- ton." But, while the mould was being heaped upon the coffin, he raised his eyes, and let them rove aim- lessly over the crowd, neither avoiding nor courting ob- servation-the cursory regard of a man who had no strong interest in any person or group there. They changed singularly in resting -upon the family from Ridgeley. A stare of stupefaction gave place to living fires of angry suspicion and amazement lurid flame that testified its violence in the reddening of cheeks and brow, in the dilating nostril and quivering lips. Then he passed his hand downward over his features, evidently conscious of their distortion, and striving after a semblance of equanimity, and looked again in stern fixity, not at her from whom he had been parted in the early summer of his manhood, nor at his success- ful rival, nor yet at the guardian who had offered him gratuitous insult in addition to the injury of refusing to permit his ward's marriage with a disgraced adven- turer- but at Mrs. Aylett, the chatelaine of Ridgeley, the wife whose serene purity had never been blemished by a doubting breath; chaste and polished matron; the admired copy for younger and less discreet, but not more beautiful women. He surveyed her boldly--if the imagination had not seemed preposterous-Mr. Aylett would have said scornfully, as he might study   320     AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS. the face and figure of some abandoned wretch who had accosted him in the public thoroughfare as an acquaint- ance. .   -  A haughty and uncontrollable gesture from the hus- band succeeded in diverting the offender's notice to himself for one instant-- not more. But in that flash he detected a shade of difference in the expression that irked him; a ray, that was inquiry, sharp and eager, tempered by compassion,. yet still contemptuous. All this passed in less time than it has taken me to write a line descriptive of the pantomime. Tile mound was shaped, and the decorously mournful train turned from it to retrace their course to the house, Frederic Chilton imitating the example of those about him, but moving like a sleep-walker, his brows corrrugated and eyes sightless to all surrounding. objects. He had awakened when the Ridgeley carriage drove to the door. Mrs. Sutton detained Mabel in one of the upper chambers to concert plans for a visit to the homestead while the Dorrances should be there. Aunt and niece had not met since the arrival of the latter in Virginia, a fortnight before, the elder lady being in constant at- tendance upon Mrs. Tazewell. "This is very stupid-! And I :am getting hungry!" said Mrs. Aylett, aside to her lord, as she stood near a front window, tapping the floor with her feet, while vehicle after vehicle received its load and rolled off. ' We shall be the last on the ground. Herbert! can't   AFTER FIFTEEN   EARS.     321 you intimate to Mabel that- we are impatient to be gone?" "I don't know where she is!" growled the brother, for once non-colmplaisant to her behest, and not stirring from the chair in the corner into which he had dropped at his entrance. His head hung upon his breast, and he appeared to study the lining of his hat-crown, balancing the brim by his forefingers between his knees. Mrs. Aylett had lowered her veil in the burying-ground or on her way thither, but it was a flimsy mass of black lace - richly- wrought, yet insufficient to hide the paleness of the upper part of her visage. Mr. Aylett watched and wondered, with but one definite idea in his brain be- yond the resolve to ferret out the entire mystery in his stealthy, taciturn fashion. Herbert Dorrance had been, in some manner, compromised by his association with this Chilton, had reason to dread exposure from him, and his sister was the confidante of his guilty secret. "I shall know all about it in due season," thought the master of himself and his dependents. Not hat he meant to' extort or wheedle it from his consort's keeping, but he had implicit faith in his own detective talents. "Here she is at last!" he said, when Mabel came down t'e staircase, holding Aunt Rachel's hand, and talking low and earnestly, her noble face- and even "*    322     AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS.  gliding step a refreshing contrast to Mrs. Aylett's ner- vousness and Herbert's dogged sullenness. "I am sorry: I have kept you so long, but there will be less dust than if we h]ad gone sooner. The other carriages will have had time to get out of our way," she said, pleasantly. "Winston," corning up to her brother, and speaking in an undertone, "will it be quite convenient for you to send for Aunt Rachel on next Friday 2 a "Entirely! The carriage shall be at your service at any hour or day you wish," with more cordiality than was common with him.     I However treacherous others might be in their re- serve and half-confessions, here was one who had never deceived him or knowingly misled him to believe her better, or otherwise, than she was. Honesty and truth were stamped upon her face by a life-long practice of these homely virtues-not by meretricious arts. It was tardy justice, but he rendered it without grudging, if not heartily. A few words passed as to the hour at which the car- riage was to call for gMrs. Sutton, and Mabel kissed her "Good-by," the others shaking hands with her, and with three or four of the Tazewell kinsmen who offici- ated as masters of ceremonies, and Mrs. Aylett made an impatient movement toward, the front steps. Directly in her route, leaning against a pillar of the old-fashioned porch, was Frederic Chilton, no longer *                  ' * \   AFTER FIFTZEEi N YEARS.     -323 dreamy and perplexed, but on the alert with eye and ear-- not losing one sound of her voice, or trick of feature. She inclined her head slightly and courte- ously, the notice due a friend of the house she, as guest, was about to leave. He did not bosw, nor relax the rigor of his watch. Only, when she was seated in the carriage, he bent respectfully and mutely before Mabel, who followed her hostess, and paying as little attention to the .two gentlemen as they did to him, walked up to Mrs. Sutton, and said something inaudi- ble to the bystanders. As they drove out of the yard, the Ridgeley quartette saw the pair saunter, side by side, to the extreme end of the portico, apparently to be out of hearing of the rest, but no one remarked aloud upon the renewed intimacy and then confiden- tial attitude. "If it is anything very startling, the old gossip will never keep it to herself," Mr. Aylett congratulated himself, while his wife's complexion paled gradually to bloodlessness, and Herbert sat back in his corner, sulky and dumb. "'And she is coming to us on Friday!"   -CIrAPTER X V111. 'Il'lUNDER IN THE AIR.   ,IE only malady that put Herbert Dorrance in frequent and unpleasant remembrance of his mortality was a fierce headache, which had of late years supervened upon any imprudence in diet, and upon excessive agitation of mind or physical exertion. His invariable custom, when hle awoke at morning withaone of these, was to trace it to its sup- posed source, and after determining that it was noth- ing more than might have been expected from the cir- cumstance, to commit himself to his wife's nursing for the day. She ought, therefore, to have been surprised when, while admitting that the pain in his head was intense, he yet, on the morrowsucceeding Mrs. Tazewell's funeral, persisted in risin; and dressing for breakfast. "It must have been th roast duck at dinner yester- day," he calmly and languidly explained the attack. "It was fat, and the stuffing reeked with butter, sage, and onion. An ostrich could not have digested it. I '(324) .   7TUNDER IN tag AIR.       325 was tired, too, and should not have eaten heartily of even- the plainest food." M[abel neither opposed nor sustained the theory. She had slept so ill herself as to knotw how restless he had been; had heard his hardly suppressed sighs and tossings to and fro, infallible indications with him of serious perturbation. Had his discomfort been bodily only, he would have felt no compunction in calling her to his aid, as he had done scores of times. mier sleepless hours had also been fraught with melan- choly disquiet. Putting away from her-,with firm- ness begotten by virtue born of will--and so much of this thoughtfulness as pertained to the bygone days with which Frederic Chilton was insepara- ble associated, she yet deliberated seriously upon the expediency of speaking out courageously to Herbert of the relation this man had once borne to her, the inci- dents of their- recent meeting, and the effect she saw was produced upon her husband's mind by the sight of him. "If we would have this negative happiness continue, this matter ought to be settled at once and forever," she said, inwardly. "He must not suspect me of weak and wicked clinging to the phantoms of my youth; must believe that I do not harbor a regret or wish in- compatible with my duty as his wife. I will avail myself of the first favorable moment to assure him of the folly of his fears and of his discomfort."   T 2'UNDER IN THE A T. Another consideration --the natural sequence of her conviction of his unhappiness- was a touching appeal to her woman's heart. If he had not loved her more fervently than his phlegmatic temperament and unde- monstrative bearing would induce one to suppose, he would not dread the rekindling of her olden fancy for another. The image of him who, she had confessed, had taught her the depth and weight of her own affec- tions, whom she had loved as she had never professed to care for him, would not have haunted his pillow to chase sleep, and torture him with forebodings. "I must make him comprehend that Mabel Aylett at twenty, wilful, romantic, and undisciplined, was a different being from the woman who has called him 'husband' without a blush, for fourteen years!" It was these recollections that softened her kindly tones to tenderness; made the pressure of her hand upon his temples a caress, rather than a manual appli- ance for deadening pain; while she combated his in- tention of appearing at the breakfast-table. "Lie down upon the sofa!"she entreated. "Let me bring up a cup of strong coffee for you; then darken the room, and chafe your head until you fall asleep, since you turn a deaf ear to all proposals of mustard foot-bath]s and Dr. Van Orden's panacea pills." "No! 'I stubbornly. "Aylett and Clara would think it strange. They do not understand how a slight irreg- ularity of diet or habit can produce such a result.

The dreaded critics received the tidings of his indis-  position without cavil at its imputed origin; treated the whole subject with comparative indifference, which would have mortified him a week ago, but seemed now to assuage his unrest. The breakfast hour was a quiet one. Herbert could not attempt the form of eating, despite his expressed hope of the curative effects of nourishment, and sipped his black coffee at tedious in- tervals of pain, looking more ill after each. Mabel was silent, and regardful of his suffering, while Mrs. Aylett toyed with the tea-cup, broke her biscuit into small heaps: of crumbs upon her plate, and under her visor of ennui and indolent musing, kept her eye upon her vis-a-vis, whose face was opaque ice; and his intona- tions, when he deigned to speak, meant nothing save that he was controller of his own meditations, and would not be meddled with. "You are not well enough to ride over to the Court- house with me, Dorrance?" he said, interrogatively, his meal despatched. "It is court-day, you know?" "What do you say, Mabel?" was Herbert's clumsy reference to his nurse. "Don't you think I might ven- ture?" "I would not; if Hwere in your place," she replied, cautiously dissuasive. "The day is raw, and there    328     2'tUU ERB IN 2:i' AIR. will be rain before evening. Dampness always aggra- vates neuralgia."  "It is neuralgia, then, is it?" queried Winston, shortly, drawing on his boots. His sister looked up surprised. "What else should it be?" "Nothing -unless the symptoms indicate softening of the brain!" he rejoined, with his slight, dissonant laugh. "In either case, your decision is wise. Hie is better off in your custody than he would be abroad. I hope I shall find you convalescent when I return. Good morning!" His wife accompanied him to the outer door. "It is chilly!" she shivered, as this was, opened. "Are you warmly clad, love?" feeling his overcoat. "And don't forget your umbrella." Her hand had not left his shoulder, and, in offering a parting kiss, she leaned her head there also. "I wish you would not go!" she said impulsively and sincerely. "sWhy " , I cannot say -except that I dread to be left alone all day. You may laugh at me, but I feel as if some- thing terrible were hanging over me or you. The spiritual oppression is like the physical presentiment sensitive temperaments suffer when a thunder-storm is brooding, but not ready to break. Yet I can refer my fears to no known cause."   tWlVUZDER IN T/'f An?.       329 "That is folly." Mr. Aylett bit -off the end- of a cigar, and felt in his vest pocket for a match-safe. "You should be able always to assign a reason for the fear as well as the hope that is in you. You have no idea, you say, from what recent event your prognosti- cation takes its hue?" She laughed, and straightened her fine neck. "From the same imprudence that has consigned poor Herbert to the house for the day, I suspect--a late and heavy dinner. I had the nightmare twice before morning. You will be home to supper 2," "Yes." Hesitating upon the monosyllable, he took, hold of her elbows, so as to bring her directly before him, and searched her countenance until it was dyed with blushes.                   i  "Why do you color so furiously?" he asked; in rail- lery that had a sad or sardonic accent.- "I was about to ask if you would be inconsolable if I never came back. Perhaps your presentiment points to some such fatality. These little accidents have happened in bet- ter-regulated fanmilies than ours." "Winston!" She gasped and blanched in pain or terror.

"Yes - here /" laying his hand upon her heart, the beautiful eyes terrified. and pathetic as those of a TO I   2'H*UN DER IN 2ti AIR. wounded deer. "For the love of Heaven, never stab me again with such suggestions. When you die, I shall not care to live. When you cease to love me, I shall wish we had died together on our marriage-day- my husband!"  He let her twine her arms about his neck, laid his cheek to her brow, clasped her tightly and kissed her impetuously, madly, again and yet again -disengaged himself, and ran down the steps. She was standing on the top one, still flushed and breathless from the vio- lence of his embrace, when he looked back from the gate, her commanding figure framed by the embower- ing creepers, as Mabel's girlish shape had been when Frederic Chilton waved his farewell to her from the same spot.  Diid either of them think of it, or would either have reckoned it an ominous coincidence, if the remem- brance of that long-ago parting had presented itself then and there? Herbert spent the day upon the lounge in the family sitting-room a cosy retreat, between the parlor and the conservatory, which had been added to the lower floor in the reign of the present queen. HHer brother's seizure was no trifling ailment.- Alternations of stupor and racking spasms of pain defied, for several hours, his wife's application of the remedies she had found efficacious in former attacks. Her ultimate resort was chloroform, and by the liberal use of this, relaxation ,         J \..

The weather continued to threaten rain, although none had fallen as yet, and the wind moaned lugubriously in the leafless branches of the great walnut before the end window of the-narrow apartment. It was a grand tree, the patriarch of the grove that sheltered the house from the north winds. 3 Mabel, relieved from watch- fulness, and to some extent from anxiety, by her hus- band's' profound slumber, lay back in her chair with a long-drawn sigh, and looked out at the naked limbs of the wrestling giant--the majestic sway and reel she used to note with childish awe -and thought of many things which had befallen her since then, until the steady rocking of the boughs and hum of the Novem- ber breeze soothed her into languor-then drowsiness then oblivion. She awoke in alarm at the sense of something hurt- ful or startling hovering near her. The fire had been trimmed before she slept, and now flamed up gayly; the window was dusky, as ere the distant corners of the room, and Herbert was gaz- ing steadfastly at her. "I fell asleep without knowing it. I am sorry! Have you wanted anything?  How long have you been awake?" "Only a few minutes, my dearest!" with no change in the mesmeric intentness of his gaze. "I want    332:     THUNDER IN- THEI AIR. 'nothing more than to have you always near me. You have been- a good, faithful wife, Mabel, better and nobler-a thousandfold nobler than I deserved. I have thought it all over while you were sleeping so tranquilly in my sight. I wish my conscience were void of evil to all mankind as is yours. I awoke with an odd and awful impression upon my mind.  The firelight flamed in a bright stream between your chair and me-and I must have dreamed it- or the chlo- roform had affected my head -I thought it was a river of light dividing us! You were a calm, white ;angel who had entered into rest-uncaring for and forgetful of me. I was lost, homeless, wandering for- ever and ever!" Had her prosaic spouse addressed her in a rhythmic improvisation, Mabel could not have been more as- tounded. "You are dreaming yet!"she said, kneeling by him, and bindings his temples with her cool, firm palms. "When we are divided, it will be by a dark--not a bright river." "Until death do us part!"Herbert repeated, thoughtfully. U'I wish I could hear you say, once, that you do not regret that clause of your marriage vow.

"I would disabuse your mind -" "All in the dark!" exclaimed Mrs. Aylett, at the door. "And what a stifling odor of chloroform!" ]Mabel got up, and drew a heavy travelling-shawl that covered Herbert's lower limbs over -his arms and chest.      i "I will open the window!" she said, deprecatingly. A sluice of cold air rushed in, beating the blaze this way and that, ptffing ashes from the health into the, room, and eliciting from Mrs. Aylett what would have" been a peevish interjection in another woman. "3Iydear sister! the remedy is worse than the of- fence. Chloroform is preferable to creosote, or what- ever abominable elenent is the principal ingredient of smoke and cold! The thermometer must be down to the freezing-point!" Mabel lowered the sash. "You have been sitting in a room without fire, I suspect. The temperature here is delightful. I am sorry' we have exiled you from  such comfortable quarters."  "Don't speak of it  I cannot endure to sit here alone-or anywhere else. I have slept most of the afternoon. - How the wind blows!

"You were not subject to these spells formerly. People generally outlive constitutional headaches--so I have noticed. It is queer yours should occur so often and wax more violent each time. You should have medical advice before they ripen into a imore serious disorder." Herbert shaded his eyes from the fire, and lay with out replying, until his wife believed he had relapsed into a doze. She was convinced of her mistake by his saying, slowly and distinctly,- "You do not enter into Clara's whole meaning, Ma- bel. We have been careful, all of us, never to tell you that our father was imbecile by the time he was fifty, and died, in his sixtieth year, of the disease your brother named this morning -softening of the brain. I, of all his children, am most like him physically. If it- be true that this danger menaces me, you should be informed of it, and kniow, furthermore, that it is incur- able." ; Mabel also paused before answering. "I cannot assent to the hypothesis of your inherited malady, Herbert. These headaches may mean nothing. But let that be as it may, you should have told me of this before." i4         .   TtUIJDER IN 'IS AIR.      335 "You see," broke in Mrs. Aylett's triumphant sar- casm. "The reward of your maiden attempt at conju- gal confidence is reproof. What have I warned you from the beginning?" "Not reproof," corrected Mabel, in mild decision. "My knowledge of the secret he deemed it wise and kind to withhold would have gained for him my sym- pathy, and my more constant and intelligent care of his health. It is the hidden fear that grows and mul- tiplies itself most rapidly. Before it is killed it must be dragged -to the light." "That is your hypothesis," was the bright retort. "We Dorrances have justly earned a reputation for dis- cretion by the excellent preservation of our own se- crets, and those committed to our keeping by our friends. My motto is, tell others nothing about your- self which they cannot learn without your confession. An autobiography is always either a bore or a blunder. Not that I would regulate the number and nature of your divulgations to your wife, Herbert. As to Win- ston's unlucky hit this morning, it was me-re fortuity. I have never felt myself called upon to enlighten him in fainily secrets, and his is an incurious disposition. He never asks idle questions.  He has a marvellous faculty of striking home-blows in the dark, but that is no reason why one should betray his wound by crying out. Apropos to darkness, may I ring for a lamp, or will the light hurt your eyes?"    336     YTZt,UNDER ZN :/N' AIR "The fire-light is more trying," rejoined Mabel, pushing a screen before the sofa, and placing herself where she could, in its shadow, hold her husband's hand. It was cold and limp when she lifted it, but tight- ened upon hers with the instinctive grip of gratitude too profound to be uttered. She had never been so near loving him as at the instant in which he believed he had incurred her ever- lasting displeasure.  Generosity and pity were fast undoing the/petrifying influences of her early disap- pointment, their mutual reserve, and tacit misunder- standings. If half he feared were true, his need of her affection, her counsel and companionship were dire. Whatever wrong he had done her by keeping back the tale of hereditary infirmity, he had suffered mnore frolm the act than she could ever do. Who knew how much of "what sue, with others, mistook for constitutional phllegm and studied austerity, was the outward sign of the battle between dread of his inherited doom and the resolve of an iron will to defy natural laws and the sentence of destiny herself, and hold reason upon her rickety throne? Heaven's gentlest and kindest angels were busy with Mabel Dorrance's heart in that reverie, and, as they wrought, the cloud that had rested there for fifteen years broke into rainbow smiles that illumined her cointenance into the similitude of the shining ones.   2 UAUER   Zr 2A  A TR.    337 "1 bless Thee, Father, the All-wise and Ever-merci- ful, that she is safe I " was her voiceless thanlksgiving. No more bitter tears over the lonely, sunken grave!  no more hearkening, with aching, never-to-be-satisfied ears for the patter of the "little feet that never trod." The great sorrow of her life that had been good in His sight was at length a blessing in hers. Her "hereaf- ter" of knowledge of His doings had come to her in this world.

"No, ma'am."       . "See that the llantern over the great gate is lighted, and that some one is ready to take his horse. And, Peter," as he was going out, "tell Thomas not to bring in supper until Mr. Aylett retuans." She moved to the window, bowed    her hands on either side of her eyes to exclude the radiance within, and strained them into the black, black night. , "He will have a dark and a disagreeable ride," she said, coming back to the fire. !Ier uneasiness was so palpable as to excite Mabel's compassion. "Every step of the road is familiar to him, and he is accustomed to night rides," she said, encouragingly.    $338 -    TVfUSNER 1'S t' AIR ! "Yes," absently.' "But he will be very wet..

She ob- served; now, that her sister-in-law was arrayed more richly than usual, and her attire was always handsome and. tasteful. A deep purple silk, trimmed upon slkirt and waist with velvet bands of darker, purple, showed of her clear skin to fine advantage, and was saved from monotony of effect by a headdress of lace and buff ribbons. A stately and a comely matron, she was bedight for her lord's return; weighed as heavy each minute that detained-him from her arms. She was, still standing by the' low mantel, her arm resting lightly upon it,.the fire-blaze bringing out lus- trous reflections in her drapery and hair, and tinging her pensive cheek with youthful carmine, when her husband entered. ' I   OTAPTER XIX. T was a peculiarity of Winston Aylett that he was never discomposed in seeming, however embarrassing or distressing might be his posi- tion. In his childhood he was one to whom, to  use the common phrase, dirt would not stick. His face was clean and fair, his hands smooth, and his hair inorder after rough and tumble experiences that sent his companions home begrimed, ragged,:and un- kempt frights. To-night, he had ridden a dozen miles in the teeth of the storm, and made no pause before appearing before his wife and sister, exceptto lay off  his hat and overcoat in the hall. But had he expected to enl[unter a roomful of ladies, his costume could not have beenmore unexceptionable. His linen was pure and fresh, even to the narrow line of wristhand edging his coat sleeve; his clearly cut patrician features were tranquil in every line and tint; his step was the light, yet deliberate stride of an athlete without passion or bravado. Conscious power, (339) Ok   340         D  INNSIS. inexorable -will; and thorough self-command were stamped upon him from crown to foot, and his saluta- tion to the small family party accompanied a smile as, mirthless and cold as were his eyes. irs. Aylett advanced a step, not more, and returned ;he, bow that comprehended all present, with a pleased, aot rapturous welcome. "We were beginning to fear lest you might be we b," she said, emulating his polite equanimity. Genune ;act is always chameleon-like in quality. "It rains tuite fast, -does it not?" . "The storm is increasing, but I experienced Ho inconvenience from it, thank you." He sat down in his favorite arm-chair, and sprei d isi fingers before the fire. "I am happy to see you so very much better "- to EIerbert. "There were many kind inquiries' for you it the court-house to-day. Dr. Ritchie wanted to know if you had ever taken nux vomica, for these' ieuralgic turns. I invited him to come in. with me ind prescribe for you, but he said he must push on home, so we parted at the outer gate." So affable as almost to put others at their ease in his Pompany, he chatted until supper was announced; re- gretted civilly Herbert's inability to go to the table, and gave his sister his arm into the dining-room, Mrs. Aylett following in their wake. If he did not eat leartily, he praised, in gentlemanly moderation, the    ;N vrjiTUMSIs       341 viands selected by his consort for his delectation after his wet ride, and pleaded a late dinner as- the reason of his present abstinence. Then they adjourned to the apartment where they had left Mr. Dorrance, and the host produced his cigar-case. "Mabel says that smoke never offends your olfac- tories, or affects your head unpleasantly, when you are suffering from this nervous affectionj" he said to Her- bert. "On the contrary, it often acts as a sedative," was the reply. Winston lighted a cigar with an allumette from a, bronze taper-stand -a Christmas; gift from his wife, which she kept supplied with fanciful spiles twisted and fringed into a variety of shapes; drew several long breaths to be certain that the fire had taken hold of the heart of the, Havana, tossed the pretty paper into the embers, and resumed his seat in the chimney corner. "A sedative is a good thing for people who allow their nerves to get out ---of gear," he remarked, dryly and leisurely, puffing contentedly in the middle and at the end of the sentence. "But- he who does this, sub- verts the order of the ruler and the ruled, I supposed 'I had nerves once, but it is an ,age since they have dared molest me. I know that I had my impulses when I was younger." iHe stopped to fillip the ash forming upon the ig . *;   nited end of his-cigar, performing the operation with }nicety, using the extreme tip of his middle-finger nail over the salver attached for the purpose to the bronze 'smoking-set., , I obeyed one, above a dozen years ago. I learned only to-day that it was rash and unwise, and to how 'much evil it may lead." "Not a very active evil, if you have just discovered it to be such." The speaker was his sister. Herbert was motionless upon his couch. Mrs. Aylett, in the lounging-chair at the opposite side of the hearth from her husband, was cutting the leaves of a new magazine he had brought from-the post-office, and did not seem to hear his re- mark. "You reason upon the assumption that ignorance is bliss," said Mr. Aylett. "Allow me to express the opinion that the adage embodying that idea is the refuge of cowardsand fools'. No matter how grievous a bankrupt a man may be financially or in spirit, he is craven or a blockhead to shrink the investigation of his accounts. Which allusion to bankruptcy brings ,me t? the recital of a choicely offensive bit of scandal I heard to-day. It is seldom that I give heed to the like, but the delicious rottenness revealed by this tale enfored my hearing, and fied the details in my mind. I could not but think, as I rode home, of the acoes- sories which would add effectiveness, to-night, to my   second-hand narrative. I had the whole scene, which is now before me, in my mind's eye -the warm fire- light and the shaded lamp brightening all within, while the rain pattered without; the interesting inva- lid over there gradually stirring into interest as the story progressed; you, Mabel, calmly and critically at- tentive; and my Lady Aylett, too proud to look the- desire she really feels to handle the lovely carrion." "your figures are not provocative of insatiable ap- petite," returned his wife, with inimitable sang-froid, staying her paper knife that she might examine an engraving. "Your appetite needs further excitants, then? So did mine until I began to suspect that the history might be authentic, and not a figment of the racon- teur's imagination. The hero's name at first disposed me to set down the entire relation as a fiction. It is romantic enough to perfume a three-volume novel- Julius Lennox1 "         ' I  Mabel's instinctive thought was for-her husband, but in turning to him she could not but notice that Mrs.: Aylett sat motionless, the paper-cutter between two leaves, and her left hand pressed hard upon the upper, but without attempting to sever them. Herbert twisted his 'head upon the pillow; until he  faced the back of the sofa, and a convulsion went through him, hardly quelled by the clasp of Mabel's hand upon his.    ,44                   e "Julius Lennox!" reiterated Mr. Aylett, between the fragrant puffs. "A lieutenant in the navy--the good-looking, but, as the sequel proved, not over-steady, spouse of a lady who was the daughter of another naval a officer of similar rank. The latter was compelled to leave'. the service on account of incipient id: oy, and retired, upon half-pay, to an unfashionable quarter of a certain great city, where his wife, a smart Yankee, opened a boarding-house for law and medical students, and contrived not only to keep the souls and bodies of her family together, but to marry off her two still sin- gle daughters- the one to a barrister, the other to a physician. The lovely Louise Lennox--a pretty allit- eration, is it not?--remained meanwhile under the paternal roof, her husband's ship being absent most of -the time, and the handsome 'Julius having unlmited privileges in the line condemned by "Black-eyed Susan" in her parting intrnview with her sailor lover -finding a mistress in every port. It is woman's nature and wisdom   to seek consolation for such afflictions as the deprivation of the beloved one's society, and the almost certainty that he is basking his faithles sself in the sunlight of another's eyes. Our heroine, being at once ardent and philosoph- ical, put the lex talionis into force by fall]]ing in love with one of her mother's lodgers, a sprig of the legal profession. The favored youth-so says my  edition of the  romance- remained preternaturally uncon-    X   NEMESIS.         345 scious of the sentiment he had inspired, attributing her manifestations of partiality to platonic regard, until she opened his modest eyes by proposing- an elopement.- He had completed his professional studies, taken out a license to practise law, was about to quit her and the city, and the no-longer-adored Julius was coming home- -a wreck in health and purse -upon a six months' leave of absence. It must be owned the Lady 'Louise had some excuse for a measure that seemed to have, amazed and horrified her cicisbeo. Recoiling from the proposition and herself with the virtuous indignation. that is ever aroused in the manly bosom by similar advances, he packed up his trunk, double-locked it and his heart, paid his bill, and decamped from the 'dan-le gerous precincts. "Ignoble -conclusion to a tender affair; but not so devoid of tragicality as would seem. Infuriated at the desertion of this modern Joseph, Louise, the lorn, avenged the slight offered her charms by declaring to her youngest brother, the only one who resided in the same city with herself, that Joseph had made dishonora-  ble proposals to her - a proceeding which demonstrates - that the femiinine character has withstood the prover-p, bially changing effects of time from age to age. IMy narrative is but a later and a Gentile, version of the Jewish novelette to which I have referred. The 6..le of Potiphar was cast for the unsophisticated brother?, who, being unable to immure the unimpressible Joseph; ,- 5s*           '  -        ;,?   ,'in the Tombs, attempted the only means of redress that remained to him, to wit: Personal chastisement. "And here," continued the narrator, yet more slowly, "I find myself perplexed by the discrepancy between the statement I have had to-day and one of this section of the story furnished me several years since. In the latter the indignant fraternal relative flogged the would-be betrayer within a quarter of an --inch of his life. The other account reverses the posi- tion of the parties, and makes Joseph the incorruptible also the invincible. However this may have been, the adventure seems to have quenched the loving Louise's brilliancy for a season. We hear no more of her until after' her father's decease, when she re-enters the lists of Cupid in another State, as the blushing and still beautiful virgin-betrothed of a man of birth  and means, who woos and weds her under her maiden cognomen- the entire family, including the valiant brotlher who figured as whippee or whipper, in the castigation exploit-being accomplices in the righte- ous fraud. I  might, did I not fear being prolix, tell of sundry side-issues growing out of the main stalk of this plot, such as the ingenious manceuvres by which the promising couple of conspirators averted, upon the eve of the sister's bridal, the threatened exvosd of their machinations to entrap the wealthy lover. Suffice it to say that the duped husband (by brevet) lived for a de- cade and a half in the: placid enjoyment of the igno-   EM=ESISR     s347 rance which my sagacious sister here is disposed to confound with rational bliss--nor is he quite sure, to this day, whether spouse No. 1 of the partner of his bosom still lives, or by clearance in what court of in- famy or justice she managed to shuffle off her real name, and win a right to resume the title of spinster." He lighted a fresh cigar, and f6r the space Of per- laps a minute, a dead and ominous silence prevailed. Mabel, pallid and faint at heart, could not take her eyes from his countenance, with its cruel smile, frozen, shallow eyes, and the deep white dints coming and going in his nostrils. He had judged without partiality. -He would con- demn  without mercy. He would   punish without remorse. Herbert still faced the back of the loung, but he. had slipped his hand from the relaxing hold of hers, and pressed it over his eyes. She could not seek to possess herself of it again. Winston was not the only dupe of the nefarious fraud, the betrayal of which had overtaken the guilty pair thus late in their career of duplicity. Yet, however severely she had suffered in heart from their falsehood and her brothers intolerance, no stain would rest upon her name, while, terminate as the affair might, the disgraceful revelation rould ship- wreck I her brothers happiness for life, if not bring up- on the old homestead  a storm of scandal that would leave no more trace of the honorable reputation hereto-   348 8ai SrS. fore borne by its owners than remained of the smil ng plenty of the cities of the plain after the fiery wrath of the Lord had overthrown them. Mrs. Aylett resumed the suspended operation of cutting the leaves of her new monthly; fluttered them to be certain that none were overlooked; laid down the periodical; brushed the scattered bits of paper from her silken skirt, and retaining the paper-knife--a costly toy of mother-of-pearl and silver--changed her posi- tion so as to look her husband directly in the'eye. "I believe I can give you thd information you lack," she said, in. curiously constrained accents, the concen- tration of some feeling to which she could or would not grant other vent. "Clara Louise Lennox obtained a divorce from  her first husband on the grounds of drunkenness, failure to maintain her, infidelity, and personal ill-usage. He came home from  sea, as you have said, the battered ruin of a man, fallen beyond hope of redemption. There was no law, written or moral, which obliged her, when once freed from it, to carry about with her and thrust upon the notice of others the loathsome body of death typified by his name and her matronly title. She commenced life anew at her father's death, contrary, let me say to the advice of all her friends, if I except the mother, who could refuse nothing to her favorite daughter. The scheme was boldly conceived. You have admitted that it was suc- cessfully carried out. In New York the family were   NAfr srTRi        349- c not known beyond the circle with which they disdained to associate when the lodging-house business was aban- doned. There were a thousand nhances to one that in her new abode Miss Dorrance would be identified by some busybody with the divorced Mrs. Lennox. She risked her fortunes upon the one chance, and won. I do not expect you to believe that the impostor was moved by any other consideration in contracting her second marriage than the wish to seek the more exalted sphere of society and influence which Fate had hither- to denied her. You would sneer were I to hint, how: ever remotely, at a regard for her high-born suitor the dashing, but dissipated officer had never awakened Mr. Aylett lifted his hand, smiling more evilly than before. "Excuse the interruption! but after your statement of the fact that such sentimental asseverations would be futile, you waste time in recapitulating the- loves of the lady aforementioned, and we in hearing them. I think I express the opinion of the audience--fit, but few--when I say that we require no other evidence than that afforded by the story I have told of Mrs. Len- nox's susceptibility and capacity for affection. We are willing to take for granted that the latter was illimita- ble s         a "As you like!" idly tapping the nails of her left iO t   \ hand with the knife. Is there anything else pertain- ing to this history into which you would like to inquire?" It was a sight to curdle the blood about one's heart, this duel between husband and wife, with double-edged blades, wreathed with flowers., Mr. Aylett's attitude of lazy indifference was not exceeded by Clara's proud languor. He laughed a little at the last question. I have speculated somewhat-having nothing else in particular to engage my mind on my way home- upon the point I named just now, and upon one other akin to it. All that the novel needs to round it off neatly is an encounter between the real and the yuasi consorts. - I cannot specify them by name, in conse- quence of the uncertainty I have mentioned. One was a bod-Jide husband -the other a bogus article, let New York divorce laws decide what they will, provided always that the fallen Julius had not bidden farewell to this lower earth before his loyal Louise plighted her faith; to her Southern gallant. Death is the Alexander of the unmiverse. There is no retying the knots he has cht."' From the pertinacity with which he returned to the question one could discern his actual anxiety to have it settled. Mabel understood that thp only salve of possible application to his outraged pride and love was the discovery that Clara had been really a widow when he wedded her. The divorce and subsequent deception ',  ,  " \    NEMESIS         351 were sins of heinous dye against his ideas of respecta- bility and unspotted honor, but he would never forgive the woman who had had two living husbands, freed from the former though she was by a legal fiction. No one saw this more clearly than did she whose fate trembled upon the next words she should utter. With all her hardihood, she hesitated to reply. LuDx- ury, wealth, and station were on one side; degradation and poverty on the other. The solitary hope of rein- statement in the affection, if not the esteem, of him she loved truly as it was in her to love anything beside her- self, was arrayed against the certainty of alienation and the tearful odds of ignominious banishment. Her answer, under the presure of the warring emo- tions, was a semitone lower, and less. distinctly enunci- ated than those that had gone before it. "The denouement you propose for your romance is impracticable. Julius Lennox died befor the date of the second marriage." Herbert drew himself to a sitting posture by clutch- ing the back of the lounge. His red eyes and tumbled hair made him look more like a mad than -a sick man. "In the name of Heaven," he demanded hoarsely, "have we not had enough lies, every one of which has been a blunder, and a fatal one 1. I told you, years ago, that the scene of this evening was a mere question of time; that, without a miracle, an edifice founded upon   852        XRW  8I8. i iniquity and cemented by falsehood must crush you before you could lay the top-stone.

Mabel's arm was about his neck, her hand upon his mouth.  "No mnore! no more! if you love me 1" she whispered in an agony. "Should he guess all, he would murder her!" ; You are prepared to certif that he is dead now, are you, Mr. eDorrance a " queried Winston, suspicious of this by-play. "I am! 'sulkily.

But he was stubborn and independent.  . 'It can do no good now, he said. ' Fifteen years ago this discovery would have been my temporal salvation. And Dorrance is Mabel's husband. I cannot touch him without wountding her.1 I could not reconcile this mode of reasoning with my conscience. If wrong had been done, it ought to be righted. I did not sleep a wink all night. I wept over my noble, generous, slan- : dered boy, and over you, my darling, but my chief thought was anger at the shameless depravity, the cold- blooded cruelty of the brazen-faced adventureess who sat in your angel mother's place., For aight Frederic or I knew, her real husband was still a-e. He had never heard of the divorce, you see, andthe circum- stance of her marrying Winston under her masiden  name looked black. "Well!

I wonder now how I did it, but I' was excited, and he listened so ,patiently, questioned so quietly, that I did not realie,-for/several . e       '   '   ,   A *    35 6       D IA DN SUMMER  hours afterward, what a blaze I must have kindled in his heart and home, whether he believed me or not. The next thing I heard was not, as I expected, that he and his wife Shad quarrelled, or that he was going to challenge Frederic for having belied him, but that poor Dorrance was very ill with some affection of the brain. It was- not until a year later--just after his death-that people began to talk about the strange carryings-on at Ridgeley; how Mr. and Mrs. Aylett occupied separate apartments, and never sat, or walked, or rode together, or spoke to one another, even at table, unless there were visitors present. Nobody could ira- agine what caused the estrangement, and for the sake of the family honor I guarded my tongue. She must be a wretched woman, if all of this be true. She is breaking fast under it, in spite of her pride and skill in 'ncealment. I ought not to pity her when I re- miember how wicked shehas been; but there is a look in her:eye when she is not laughing or talking that gives me the heart-ache," "She is very unhappy!" replied Mabel, sighing. ".And so, I doubt not, is Winston, although he will not own it, and affects to ignore the fact of her failing health and spirits. It is one of those miserably deli- cate family complications with which the nearest of kin cannot meddle. They are very lind to me, and I think- my visits have been a omfort to, Clara.

It is a dreary, wretched evening of an a/m- bitious life. I ventured to tell Winston, last week, that this would probably be my last visit to Ridgeley, since I was to be married next month. it To Mr. Chilton, I suppose " he said. I answered, "Yes!" "You must be almost forty," he next remarked. "You have worn passably well, but you are no longer young." "I am thirty-seven!" said I. "Well!" he answered.  "You are certainly old enough to know your own business best." "That was all that passed. But I was glad to remem- ber, as I looked at his whitening hair and bowed shoul- der, that Frederic had not as I was foolish enough to suppose for a while-told 'him the story that had blighted. his life. Not that I could have blamed him had he done this. He had endured so much obloquy, suffered so keenly and so long, that almost any retalia- tory measure would have been pardonable." Herbert Dorrance's widow was, as had been said, on a farewell visit to her native State, and after spending a week at Ridgeley was, concluding a pleasanter so- journ of the same length at-William. Sutton's.
