The afternoon. suited my temper, and both were gloomy. Low heavens of clouded steel that yet seemed, 'now and then,. to shiver with the 'still, biting air, and with each shudder, to let down a few wandering flakes of snow; a. bleak landscape of com- mons, blasted by invisible. frost; of sterile hills, that must have been stony and bare in the sunniest spring- time,--,id for a horizon, a girdle of' leafless woods, 'stretching up motionless boughs against the pitiless sky; in the hollow formed by the amphitheatre of hills, an artificial pond-too intensely tame in formn   ni     ,   SALLUTATORY. and surroundings to deserve the name of lake, or be mistaken for aught but what it was, viz., a pool dug and filled with a' single eye to the production of ice for the next summer's use,-this was the picture that greeted my outlooking sight. Within was the dull, icy calm ofL stoical misanthropy; distrust of my fellows, which stubbornly refused to ask of heavenly wisdom the solution of the human enigma that had baffled, in dis- gusting me. Into -the midst of this sunless mood came a surprise. Right before -me, in my steady but aimless track across the waste, was a clump of dwarf trees, poor, puny things that must have had a hard coming-up. I marvelled, in surveying them, that the germs from which they had stirggled had had the courage to sprout in such a bar- ren spot. In the centre of the coppice, head and shoul- ders above his fellows, arose a holly sapling, brave with leaves of glossy green and scarlet berries. The only smile in the drear expanse, it was in itself a whole foun- i tain of cheer. The soil about the trunk might be frozen to stone-lihe hardness, but below, the great heart of Mother Erh pulsed warmly still; throwing up, at each beat, Sap into the hardy frame of her winter-child; v strength to the lusty limbs; verdure to the spiky leaves; blushes to the coral beads. And while I looked, a bevy of brown-coated  plump-breasted snow-birds whirled noisily across the plain, and alighted' with much twit- tering and a ,deal of happy, useless fluttering, among the inviting branches. .., .   SALUTATORY.           vii I had conned my lesson, and I turned my face home- wards with changed spirits and a changed purpose. As one measure towards the fulflrTqent of the latter, I send this Christmas greeting into the waste we know as the common life of this working-day world. We make it too common, dear reader. We choose for ourselves a path across a dead level, and Ithen perversely adapt our feel- ings to what we are pleased to call our circumstances. I pray you, for this one holiday season, learn with me of my holly-tree. Seek out present brightness, and in it read the promise of happy days to come. Sigh not that -"All hope of Spring-time Has perished with the year," while the same Love that nourishes the tiny greenling of the forest into brightness and beauty, despite wintry blast and wintry sleet, will keep alive in your heart, if not the tender shoots of youthful joys, the stronger, braver, worthier growth of love for your brother man; helpful charity for all things weak and lowly and sor- rowing; hope and faith in the wise and tender Father of us all.

                  MRS. DRYDEN was cross!  She would have been at a loss to specify what especial grounds she had for the' dis- content that possessed her on this partic- ular night.: If interrogated, she would probably have returned an evasive reply to the effect that it was none of the questioner's business how she felt or looked, so long as she did not obtrude her unhappiness upon   { other people, Everybody had his and her own troubles- with which others had no right to intermeddle. She was responsible to no one for her behavior; nobody should hinder her from  being low-spirited, if she pleased to be so. She was out of humor with' the whole world, herself included.  The children were troublesome; the servants heedless; her husband indif- ferent to her grievances-and it was Christmas eve. "Really," she said, peevishy, at tea-time, ', one would suppose that Christmas came but once in a century,   12       NETTIE'S PRAYER. instead of once a year! Everybody is as crazy to- night as if there were never to be anbther 25th of December." "By the way," said her husband, looking up from his paper, "I suppose you have baked some mince- pies and fried some dough-nuts- haven't you?" "I have mince-pies and turkey for to-morrow!" was the curt reply. "I knew you would not be satisfied unless you had as good a dinner as your neighbors. But al for dough-nuts-they are oily, rankr, indiges- tible abominations, fit only for an ostrich's stomach, and one doesn't get the smell of the hot fat out of the house in two weeks after they have been cooked. I never mean to make another while I live." Two pairs of sorrowful eyes stole a glance of mutual pity at one another, when this announcement was made; two pairs of cherry lips took a piteous curl, for a sec- ond; two curly heads bent lower over the plates set before their owners. Not that there was any dearth of sweet things in the Dryden larder, or that Ally and Nettie, the proprietors of the eyes,jlips, and heads aforesaid, were gormandiz- era. But this matter of frying doughnuts was great fun to them, as it is to most other small -people who have ever- been permitted to stand by and see the  ,    NETTIE'S PRAYER.          13 I rings, leaves, birds, circles, triangles, and the endless rvariety; of nondescript figures leave the kneading-board pale, flat surfaces df soft dough, and, upon being thrown B into the bubbling fat, sinking, like leaden shapes, with a tremendous splutter and "fizz," arise slowly and ma- jestically to the top of the caldron, as Mr. Weller has it, "swelling wisibly" before the enraptured eye into pufy, crisp, toothsome morsels, fit, in the estimation of the juvenile artakers thereof, for a queen's luncheon. Last year, the brother and sister had spent Christmas week with an aunt in another town. This lady being the indulgent mamma of half a dozen boys and girls, enjoyed nothing so much as making them merry and happy.   The six days passed in her abode lived in the memory of nephew   and niece as a dream  of Paradis- aical delight. But, this season, the holidays were to be kept at home, and   the, prospect was, to say the least, not eminently flattering. Mr and Mrs. Dryden were estimable people in their way, but they had   studied to render themselves in- tensely and purely matter-of-fact. They prided them- selves secretly upon growing  wiser and more-practical -less poetical-each revolving cycle.  Each year, life assumed   a more positive and less romantic aspect; their own duties seemed more momentous and    imper-   ^ ; "      NETTIE'S PRBAYBER. ative; the things which others call recreation and inno- cent amusements were puerile and unworthy. Mr. Dry- den was miling money; Mrs. Dryden was a notable housekeeper, and, so far as the physical needs of the children were concerned, a careful mother. Four little ones, three - boys and a girl, claimed her love and maternal offices. Allison, the eldest, was eight years old; Nettie, six; and a pair of twin babies were in' their third winter. .The mother's hands were certainly full, however admirable might be her faculty of accom- plishing with speed the work set for her to do. It was not surprising that she should sometimes wear a haggard, anxious - look, or that, now and then, she should .be, as she now expressed it, "worried out of her senses." "I don't see, for my part," she broke forth, impa- tiently, presently, "how people find time or have the heart to frolic and observe holidays and the like friv- olous carryings-on! With me, it is work, work, work! from morning until night, and from one year's end to another. It frets me to see grown-up men and women, who ought to know something about the cares and solemn responsibilities of life, acting like silly children. What is Christmas. more than any other time-when one takes a sober, common-sense view of the matter?"    NETTIE'S PRAYER. '        16 "That is what nobody does in this age. of nonsense and dissipation," returned her husband. ." I don't know what the world is coming to!" "Wasn't our Saviour born on Christmas-day, Mam- ma?" asked Nettie's timid voice. "That is not certain, by any means, child. And if it were true, there is all the more scandal in making a frolic of it. If there were to be prayer-meetings held all over the world to celebrate the event, it would be far more appropriate." The polysyllable staggered  Nettie ait little, but she retained sufficient courage to reply: "Our teacher told us, last Sabbath, that everybody ought to be very happy upon the Saviour's birthday.' Before Mrs. Dryden could answer, Ally put in his oar. "Mamma!-why doesn't Santa Claus ever come down our chimney?" "There is no such creature, Allison! You are too old to believe in that ridiculous fable." "But, Mamma, he came to Aunt Mary's last year " cried both children, in a breath. "And we all hung up our stockings in the parlor!" added Nettie. "And Aunt Mary let the fire go down on purpose,   16 .      ETTIB'S PRAYEi. so that the old chap might not be scorched;" shouted Ally, excitedly. -We wanted her to have the'a chimney swept, but she said he wouldn't mind'- a little dirt."' "For you know-- /1 .  *i 'His clothes were all. tarnished with ashes and soot!"' quoted Nettie, '" and yet he was in a good humor t and filled all the stockings'- \ "' Then turned with a jerk,      i And lying his finger alongside his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose 1"' chanted Ally. "Oh! what times we had repeating that, after we went to bed that night. 'His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow. He .had a broad face and a little round-"' "-You children will be the death of me!" cried Mrs. Dryden, distractedly, putting her hands to her ears. "I shall certainly never let you spend another Christ- mas at your Aint Mary's! Your heads-were so crammed with nonsense last year, that I aW  daraid you will newr get rid of it. Finish your suppers and be off Ae"T   NETTIE'S  PRAYEB.        17 to bed!  You are as Christmas-mad as if you had never been trained to more sensible things!" "I can not imagine," said Mr. Dryden, severely, "how they have contrived to remember the senseless doggerel your sister was so injudicious as to teach them." "That is the depravity of human nature!" sighed the wife. Very sober little faces were uplifted to father and mother for a "good-night"' kiss, and very slow foot- steps went up the stairs to the chamber which the brother and sister shared in common.  There was a pathos in the sound, so unlike was it to the brisk patter of other small feet upon other floors and stair- cases on that jubilee eve. The father, albeit he was not an imaginative man, noticed this, and went off to the parlor with a pained and yearning heartsaddenea, he knew not by what -longing for something he could not name. - The chil- dren had interrupted his evening reading, at supper, by their chatter, and he bestowed himself in his arm- chair by the centre-table, to finish the perusal of his newspaper. His seat was comfortable; the light clear and soft; the evening news interesting; the room still; yet he could not fix his mind upon his occupation. ,   18       NE T T I  p'BS PAYEBR. Through the quiet apartment came and went the echoes of the four little feet, in slow dejection, going on up to the repose that was to, be visited by no happy dreams of the glories of Christmas morning. He saw, between him and the printed column, the sadly-serious countenances, that were,by this time, laid upon their pillows. He wondered if the pair would cry them- selves to sleep. He purposely waxed angry with his sister-in-law for putting these silly notions into the children's heads. They were contented enough until that unfortunate visit. Now, there was no telling where this Mischief would stop. It was too provoking to have! two such fine natures, soured by repinings and foolish longings; two minds so intelligent filled with superstitious fancies. Yeet they werelfine childrenI if he did say it-and dutiful as handsome and intel- ligent. His wife had an excellent method of discipline, and deserved much credit for her success in training her offspring. She was a good woman--industrious and conscientious-but he could have wished that her spirits were more equable. He did not relish the idea, that his blooming Nettie might, one day, become a toil-womrn, pains-taking wife and mother; her smooth forehead be ploughed in two deep furrows, like those that crossed her mother's, from temple to temple; her   NBTTIE'S   PRAYER.       19 pouting lips grow colorless and drawn down  at the corners; her bird-like voie sharpen into the shrill peevishness of the tones that had ordered the bairns off to bed. He would like to keep life fresh and bright for his darling so long as he could. She would find out, soon enough, what a dry,' dusty, detestable cheat the world was. If he might have his wish, she should be a child always; a merry, laughing, singing fairy, to gladden his old age; a simple-hearted, trust- ing child, in whose love and purity he   could find refreshment, when disheartened by the faithlessness of his fellow-men. She was very fond of him-grave and undemonstrative as he was. With the unerring per- ception of childhood, she had discovered that she was his favorite, and repaid his partiality- in the coin he liked best. The sound of his latch-key in the door was the signal, noon and night, for her to bound down stairs to meet him; to kiss him, and offer, in her pretty, womanly way, to relieve him of his overcoat; to hang up his hat and bring him his slappers. Such nimble feet as hers were!  Blithe, willing little feet, how they twinkled to and fro, to perform  whatever errands he would suffer her to undertake for his com- fort! Merry, dancing little feet I But the echoes persisted in contradicting his rec- R  j                 *  '    1,        I 20       NETTIE'S PBYBEBR ollection of their lively music. Up And down-sad and slow-they wandered; never drowned for a mo- ment, while their monotonous beat was rendered more, mournful by the hurried, ceaseless tramp of pleasure- seekers upon the pavement without. He wished that he had spoken a kindly word to the downcast inno- cents, instead of the silent salute he had vouchsafed to their mutely-offered lips. Perhaps they were not asleep yet! His wife was still with the twins, in the bedroom overhead, for he heard her walking about the floor, preparing, as he knew, to leave them for the night. He could slip up noiselessly to the small cham- ber adjoining, and solace his uneasy spirit by a loving "good-night," that should dry Nettie's eyes, if they were wet, and comfort Ally's disappointed soul, while the partner of his bosom would be none the wiser for it.  Mrs. Dryden did not allow the attendance of a nur- sery-maid to her elder. children in the evening. 'For more than a year they hadundressed themselves and retired to their respective cots, without noise or com- plaint, leaving nothing for mother or servant to d, but to look in, a few minutes later, and eitinguisa the gas. This had been done by Elen, the chamber- maid, before she went down to her own tea; but   NETTIE'S  PRAYER.       21 the moonlight, streaming through the window-curtain, showed to the father, as he stood without the partly- open door, the two white beds in opposite corners of the room, and the forms that ought to have been snugly laid under the blankets. Instead of this, they were raised upon their elbows to a half-sitting pos- ture, and the low hum of their earnest voices arrested the spectator upon the threshold. "I wonder if Papa and Mamma ever were a little boy and girl!" said Master -Ally, in a doleful key. "If they were, I guess they have foigotten how they used to feel. I could have cried right out, to-day, at school, when the boys were all talking about Christ- mas gifts and what they expected to get. You ought to have seen them stare at me when they asked me what I thought I should have, and I said. that we didn't keep Christmas at ourthouse, and that I had never hung up my stockings but once, and that was when I was at my aunt's!   And one boy asked me if my father and mother were dead. Ad - when I said 'No,' another fellow called out, as rude as could be-' I guess they don't care much about you!' I tell you, Nettie, it makes a fellow feel real bad!" "I know it!" said the miniature woman, tenderly. "But, Ally, dear, Papa and Mamma do love us! Only   22      NETTIE'S PRAYER. they don't know how much we think of Christmas, and how children love to hang up their stockings, and all that. -But that was a very naughty boy that told you they didnit care for you. Papa works ever so hard to get clothes and food for us, so Mamma says; and Mamnma sews for us, and takes care of us when we are sick, and-and-a great many other kind things." "Maybe so; but. she was awful cross to-night, and scolded like every thing, just for nothing at all, and I am very miserable! Just. hear the .boys shouting out-doors, and the peoplejlaughing and talking, as they go along! It's downright mean in them, when they might know that there isn't to be any Christmas in our house. I wish they would be stilll I wish I was dead!" "Ally, Ally, that is wicked!" expostulated the gentle tones of the sister. PI don't care! where is the sense of living, if a 1 fellow is never to have any fun? Where is the use of being good? If I was the wickedest boy in town, I could not be treated worse than I am now. How I hate this stupid old house When I am a man, and have boys and girls of my own, I mean that. Santa Clams shall come every week and bring them   NETTIE'S PRAYER.         23 -oh, such lots of nice things! and you shall live with me, Nettie, and we will fry doughnuts and have New Year's cake every day!" "Ally!" said Nettie, thoughtfully, "do you suppose there is such a man as Santa Claus? M2amma says there isn't!" "I know there is!" returned the boy, confidently. "But he doesn't come to a house unless the father and mother of the children that live there send him an invitation. One of the big boys told me so, to-day. And good fathers and mothers always tell him what to bring." "I was just thinking," resumed Nettie's liquid treble, "if Our Heavenly Father knew how very badly we wanted to have a Christmas, whether He wouldn't send him to us. Suppose I pray to Him  and tell Him all about it!" "You may try it!" was the conclusion of the embryo skeptic. "But. I don't believe it will do any Igood." In a trice, Nettie had slipped to the flopr, and was fumbling among a heap of clothes laid upon a chair. Mr. Dryden watched her curiously. "Now, Ally!" he heard her say, presently, "Here are the clean stockings that Ellen got out for us to put on to-morrow. Manmma wouldn't like -it if we   24       NETTIE'S PRAYER. hung them up ourselves, so I will just lay them on the foot of the bed. If Santa Claus should come, maybe he can pin them up for us." Then, sinking to her knees, she put her hands to- gether and raised her pure face-angelic in the -father's sight- as the moonbeams revealed its expression of meek devotion. "Our Father who art in Heaven! please make us good and happy, and let us have a merry Christmas. If there is any Santa Claus, please let him come to our house to-night, for he has never been here in all our lives, and this makes us very sorry. Bless dear Papa and Mamm'a, and don't let us thinlc hard of them, or say naughty things about them, only because they don't know how little children feel. Amen!" Ally gave a grunt that might mean acquiescence; or doubt, when his sister arose and leaned over to kiss him; but Mr. Dryden could play the eavesdropper no longer. Feeling that he must inevitably discover himself if he remained another minute in his present position, he hurried down-stairs and into the parlor, where he behaved more like a crazy man than the sober, self- possessed head of a staid and decent household. Kick- ing off his slippers, he thrust his feet violently into     NETTIE'S PRAYER.         25 his boots, stamping, with unnecessary force, to get these fairly on; blew his nose repeatedly and loudly, after-' wards passing his handkerchief over his eyes, as though the sudden catarrh from which he appeared to be suf- fering had affected them also. Going into the hall, he snatched his greatcoat from the rack and put it on--still in desperate haste, pulled his hat over his brows, and rushed into the street. He found himself plunged directly into a rapid, buzz- ing crowd. Every step was .quick and light; every face wore a smile, and the air was full of the pleasant confusion of happy voices. Bless the childrenl how they ran under his feet, and trod upon his toes, and kicked against his heels, and jostled him on the right and on the left!   And not one of them was emapty- handed. Parcels of al sizes, shapes, and descriptions, filled small fingers; were hugged by small arms; laid upon sTnall shoulders and slung upon small backs Brown paper bundles; bundles tied in frailer white paper, which, bursting, showed the wheel of a toy- wagon, or the head of a toy-horse, or the arm of a doll; funnel-shaped bundles, fresh from the hands of the confectioner; bundles, wrapped hastily in news- paper by an economical shopkeeper, or one .whose stock of wrapping material had proved inadequate to  A   26       NETTIBE'S PRAYER, the rush of custom; boxes, square, oblong, and many- sided, mimic guns and drums, wih gayly-painted sides, upon whose heads the delighted owners could not re- frain from beating stirring Christmas marches, as they carried them home; here and there a huge hobby- horse, with dilated eye and streaming inane, borne aloft by the stalwart porter of some toy warehouse; these were but a few features in the pageant that streamed past Mr. Dryden-a varied and joyous tor- rent of life. He caught the infection of this atmos- phere of gladness before he had gone a dozen yards. He had come forth with the intention of purchasing something with which to make his children happy; to answer Nettie's prayer so far as lay in his power. Awakened conscience and remorseful affection for those he felt he had wronged, had driven him on to the duty of malring restitution. He soon began to under- stand that there might be enjoyment, active and new, in the task. "4 ow I wish I had brought them with me!" he said to himself, as he felt his features relax into a smile at sight of the general hilarity. "It was hard to send them to bed so early on Christmas eve. But, ,what:-would their mother have said if I had asked her permission to take them out after dark?"   NETTIB'S PRAYER.         27 He stayed his rapid progress, as another query pre- sented itself. What would this very prudent and sedate help-meet say and think of another bold innovation upon established rules, to wit, this expedition and its probable results? How should he meet the stare of mingled astonishment and rebuke that would rest upon his freight of "useless" playthings, upon his return home?  She disapproved of toys, except when great moderation- was displayed in their bestowal. Nettie had but one doll in the world, and, careful as she was of this treasure, her loving arts could not conceal tie ravages of time; said maniMrin having been Aunt Mary's gift to her niece, upon her third birthday. Ally had never owned a hobby-horse.   is mother had a dread of "rough plays."  Our hero was quite aware that on this occasion he was not inclined to modera- tion. He would cheerfully have bought the entire con- tents of any one of the illuminated windows whose splendors drew around them  a swarm   of admiring juveniles, as a hive of honey would tempt hungry bees. The difficulty was to know what would best please the unsuspecting twain at home. "This sort of-thing is not in my line!" he soliloquized. "I suppose there is a difference between girls' and boys'- playthings. I have it!, These people ought to know   TIE'S PRAYER. their business I  I will state my dilemma, and take whatever they advise." Thus resolving, he entered the largest and most bril- liant toy emporium he-had yet seen, and makin:g his way, with considerable labor, through the throng of eager buyers, presented himself at the counter. Luck- ily, the saleswoman nearest him had just dismissed a customer, and turned to him with an engaging -smile. She looked tired-as well she might, poor thing! hav- ing been on her feet for twelve hours, and hard at work all the time-but it was not in a kind-hearted tradeswoman's nature to be cross on Christmas eve. "What can I show you, sir?" she asked, politely. "That is what you must tell me, madam! I want some toys for my little girl, aged six, and my boy, who is two years older. If you can inform me what will suit them, you will oblige me, and please them." His fluent, pleasant speech amazed himself. Cer- tainly, the witchery of the festal eve was working upon him fast. "Has your daughter a tea or dinner set?" inquired the shop-woman, taking down two wooden boxes; pull- ing back the sliding tops, and rummaging among the shred -paper used for packing the fragile contents. "Here is som thing very handsome."   " Just the thing !" ejaculated the father, upon behold- ing the wee tureen; covered and shallow dishes, gravy- boat, saltcellars, casters, and a dozen plates, white, with a rim of gold; all so graceful in design, so dainty in material, as to elicit his unqualified admiration.   Al- ready he saw, in imagination, Nettie's eyes glisten at sight of them; her deft fingers arranging them--cun- ning little housewife that she was. "Then you don't care for the tea-set ?" making a movement to close the box. " I-don't--know!" hesitatingly. "I suppose she will want to spread a supper and breakfast table, as well as play dinner, won't she ?" " If she has not cups and saucers already, I would certainly recommend you to take these," and the artful tempter made a tea-tray of the lid of the case, setting out the service so attractively, that her inexperienced customer speedily regarded the second array of china as a " must have." "Now, perhaps, you will look at a table !" pursued the woman, leading the way to the back of the store. "We have a novelty in that line-an extension-table," "Of course! how stupid in me not to remember that the ehina would be useless unless she had some- thing upon which to arrange it "   TIE'S PRAYER. Mr.' Dryden had entered thoroughly -into the spirit of the enterprise, and was highly diverted at .his over- sight,; very grateful to -her who had corrected his blunder. The table was a neat affair, with turned legs and polished top, and constructed, as had been said, upon the extension principle. Mr. Dryden took it-on the spot. "Chairs?" he said, interrogatively. It was now the lady's turn to be ashamed of her forgetfulness. Half a dozen cane-seat chairs were added to the pile, which betokened Mr. Dryden to be a valu- able customer. Then followed a case of knives, a knife- box, and an assortment of silver (?) ware, and both parties came to a momentary halt.      The gentleman recovered himsel-f frst. "Now, a doll-for which she can keep house !" "Wa / finish, porcelain, biscuit, or rubber ?" said the other, glibly. " Dressed, or undressed ?" "Dressed--I suppose, since to-morrow- is so near. As to the rest, I am no judge. But I want the pretti- est doll- in the establishment." His experience in this species of merchandise was so limited that he might well be excused for starting at the wonder lly life-like lady paraded for his inspec tion. Her hair waved in natural ringlets; she rolled    IE'S -PRAYER.        31 her eyes, as the shopwoman moved her to and fro. She was dressed in they height of the mode-neither gloves, nor hat, nor parasol being wanting to complete her toilet; and when, in obedience to a dexterous pull of a wire upon her left side, she squeaked " Mamma-s and, responding to a similar twitch of the correspond- ing muscle under the right arm, she cried -' Papa l" Mr. Dryden was overwhelmed. "What will toy makers do next?" h-e articulated. "The art of manufacturing dolls is carried to great perfection," quietly replied the woman.  "Did you'say that you would take this, sir?" Take it! what could have bribed him to forego the treat of witnessing Nettie's rapture in the survey of this resplendent and accomplished demoiselle? "We have some very pretty doll-carriages, in which the lady can take the air," was the next attack, and Mr. Dryden fell a willing sacrifice to this new snare. In very compassion for her victim, the woman di- rected his thoughts to the boy's gifts. A .velocipede; a wheelbarrow, with spade, 'rake, and   hoe; a set of jackstraws, for winter evenings; a football and a sled made up the     complement that was to transport the semi-infidel to the seventh heaven of ecstacy, Truth obliges me' to mention that the lavish parent  32       E N ETTIRE'S PRAYERe. sustained a slight shock when the obliging saleswoman figured up and presented the amount of his indebt- edness; but he rallied bravely. "Christmas comes but once a year!" he said, man- fully, and paid his bill with a good grace. "You could not purchase the same quantity of hap- piness so cheaply in any other matnner," remarked the bland merchant, oracularly. The tit-bit of wisdom was assuredly not original with her, but it impressed the hearer as a profound and truthful observation one well worth remember- ing, He was getting on very swiftly, indeed, in the acquisition of Christmas lore. "You have but two children, then, sir?" remarked the lady, casually, in handing him his change. 'Bless my life  I forgot the twins i" exclaimed the father, aghast. "But I suppose they are too young to appreciate Christmas presents." " What age?" queried the other, sweetly. "Two and a half."

'14J   NETTIE'S P-RAYER.         33 selected two rubber balls, and two sets of building blocks for their delectation. "Pur porter will take them  for you," she said, amused at Mr. Dryden's amazed contemplation of the dimensions of the pyramid she constructed of his pur- chases. "Please favor us with your address!" "Really, a little more practice will render me an adept in toy shopping!" thought Mr. Dryden, com- placently, when he was beyond the enchanted ground, the seductions of which had lightened both heart and pocket. "It is not a disagreeable or difficult opera- tion, after all." As he neared his own door on his return, his pockets crammed with conical packages of sugar-plums, nuts} and crystallized fruits, he overtook the porter with his barrow. "Quietly, my man!" he said, inserting his latch-key in the lock with secret trepidation  -of spirit. "It would never do to awaken the children. Or to attract my wife's attention," he added, inly. The porter's load was transferred to the hall so silently that even Mrs. Dryden's cat-like ears did not  hear any bustle. Mr. Dryden sent the man off with a gratuity, and proceeded to dispose of the presents in the following style: the table bestraddled the right   34       NETTIES PRAYER, arm, .and upon it were the boxes of crockery, sur- mounted by the chairs; the case of jackstraws and several other light articles. The velocipede was borne in like manner upon the left coat sleeve; then came the wheelbarrow; the boxes of building-blocks, the balls, and on the top, held firmly in its place by Mr. Dry- den's chin, was the doll. In the right hand he carried the sled; in the other Dolly's carriage. This staid, prosaic pater-familias would have made no bad repre- sentation of the patron saint of the anniversary, the suggestion of whose existence. he had scouted, a few hours previously, as he slowly ascended the stairs on tiptoe, his face radiant with arch delight, despite the cowardly feat tugging at his heart-strings, as to the reception in store for him at the hands of his better half. Treading yet more delicately, in passing his sleeping-room, wherein, he had tio doubt, Mrs. Dry- den was soundly reposing, it being ten o'clock, her invariable bedtime, he pushed open' the door of the smaller chamber beyond, and entered.  The gas was burning-not brightly-but it inabled him to see with terrible distinctness the figure that started up in the aisle between the beds and confronted him  with an excited air. It was his wife! Dropping the curtain upon a tableau which the   NETTIE'S PRATYEBR.        35 reader can picture to himself better than I can de, scribe, we will take a step or two backward in our story. "And it's sorry for the children I am, this blessed night!" said Ellen, to the cook, over their dish of tea. "Sorra a bit of a merry-making will they have to- morrow-and   they such good, peaceful little things, too!

If the maid had been mistaken in her surmise as to the- tears she had seen in-- eyes which were generally dry and bright, there was no doubt as to the   meltig, mood that overtook the mother when she removed the four stockings from the place where Nettie had laid them.   She even pressed them to her lips before fastening the tops of each pair together with a stout pin, and hanging them over the foothoards of the beds. To unpack the bas- ket and undo papers, with as little rustling as was practicable, was her next act.  She paused, when everything was uncovered, to survey her acquisitions. Her expenditures had been on a scale, far less grand than her husband's, but nmaternal tact had guided her in the selection of acceptable gifts.  There were a cooking-stove, Eth its -Apsortment of pans, griddles, and kettles; a wrk-box of satinwood, lined with red velvet, and well stocked; a cradle with a baby-doll asleep under the muslin curtain, for Nbttio. For Ally, she had- provided a bag of beautiful agate marbles-; a    38       S LTTTI 'S PRBAYER B fine hUmnmi-g-top; a paint-box, and a set-fourteen in number  of Abbott's inimitable "Rollo" books for boys. She had not forgotten the twins, as was evi- denced by a couple of whips; two picture-books, and two tin horses mounted upon wheels; one attached to -an express wagon, the other to a baker's cart. Nor had she disdained to call upon the confectioner. Her conical bundles contained "Christmas mixture;" plain sugar candy; peppermint lozenges and oranges; more wholesome, or, rather, less hurtful sweets than the richer and costly delicacies that had captivated her lord's fancy. Altogether, the sight was a pleasant one, and a satisfactory, if one might judge by the gleam of comfort that overspread the tear-stained Visage. She had just dropped a handful of the " mix- ture" into the foot of Ally's sock, when a soft tap at the door startled her. It was Ellen, and she bore a ,plate, covered with a napkin, in her hand. "If you plaze, mem-Biddy hopes yo   won't be offended, mem-but the children were so disappointed to-day, mem; and when I told her you were going to give them a Christmas, she made so bold as to fry them a few doughnuts.

Tell Biddy that I am much obliged to her. These are very nice, indeed!" Yet she cried over them: when the girl was gone. Her very servants pitied the cruelly-oppressed little ones! "I have been a hard, unsympathining- mother!" she thought, sobbingly. "God forgive me this, my sin!" She wiped away the tears, and resumed her tasik. "William  will think I have lost my senses!" she ruminated, cramming an orange into the leg of the tightly-stuffed sock. "But I can't help its if he does!" And, as if invoked by her unspoken thought, her husband, accoutred rAs I have described, stood before her. William!" "Emily! The two detected culprits stared at one another for an instant, in unuttered, because unutterable amaze- ment; then, as the truth dawned upon their minds, they burst into a fit of laughter that threatened to awake the dreamers.

Christmas morning came, clear and brilliant, with t * C    NETTIE'S   PRAYER.       41 1  frosty sunlight, and Mrs. Dryden, as was her custom,  tapped at the children's door; having beforehand stealth- ily unclosed it far enough to allow herself and her accomplice a view of the interior of the dormitory. "Come, little birds, it is time you were out of your nests!" The cheery, loving voice aroused the sleepers more thoroughly than sterner   accents woild-  have done. The mother was spared the pain of knowing that the novelty of the address made it so efficacious. "Yes, Mamma!t answered Nettie, starting  up in bed. "All right!" responded Ally, and he turned over. Thus it happened that the eyes of both rested sim- ultaneously upon an object in the centre of the apart- ment, and a ringing cry of joy escaped them. s{ Nettie, Santa Claus did come 1" "Ally, don't you know what I prayed for?" They were upon the floor before the words had -left their lips.  The next few minutes were passed in speechless admiration of the miracuilous edifice that had arisen during their hours of unconsciousness. Mr. Dryden had made a second trip to the street, the night before, to buy a Christmas tree. A broad, flat box, covered with a white cloth, formed the base upon   42       NEtTIE^S PRAYER.. -which this was set.  The larger toys were placed around the trunk, and smaller ones hung among the gilt balls, flags, and flowers, that decked the boughs. miss Dolly sat at the root upon one of her new chairs, her foot upon the rocker of the new cradle, and, perched utp in the topmost branches, was Santa Claus - white beard, pipe, pack, and all-sniling broadly upon his enraptured devotees. Nettie broke the spell of ecstatic silence. "Dear -Ma Ima! Papa, darling!" she screamed "Come and seel It is jst like fairy-land!" And flying to the door, her curls streaming back, and her face fairly luminous with delight, she ran directly into her parents' arms. "Christmas shall be an '-institution' in our family, hereafter!" said Mr. Dryden, that night, when the happy childiren had kissed them  "good-night" over and over again. "I am a better man for last event ing's work and this days innocent frolic.  I feel twenty years younger, and fifty degrees happier. It pays, my dear-it pays!"  t .       l      eb Waif ,  ,   a----"-oS    0v------ m iDO not approve of lady lecturers, as a O^^  general thing," I remarked meditatively, a while since,to a gentleman, in whose pres- ence I am somewhat prone to think aloud. "You allude to public lectures?" said he, inter- rogatively, with unnecessary emphasis. "Of course!" "Oh!" and he resumed the study of a very dry- looking volume. Affecting not to observe the mischievous gleam of of his eye, I resumed:- "But I am sometimes tempted to ask the use of your lecture-room for one evening, to call together an audience from which' Q1 persons of the masculine gender shall be excluded, and,-then and tWere, ha- rangue my own sex upon a subject that has engrossed much of my time and thoughts for eight years past." ,                    ts   " A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.         1 "What is it-cookery or dry goods? Either topic    would be popular?"  "Something more important than  both put to- gether,!"I retorted. My theme would be "'A e Bights of Babies and the Responsibilities of Mothers!"'  My auditor raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips very slightly-just enough to give one the impression that he would have whistled, had not politeness re- strained him. Seeing that I was in nowise abashed by these discouraging manifestations, he offered an amend- ment to my resolution. "Better write your discourse, instead, and have it printed." "But," I objected, "what I would say would be ad- dressed to women alone.  We don't care to let men know how unmercifully we ca   hancdle one another. Moreover, I should use great painness of speech"- "I think I can set your mind at rest on that point," interrupted my companion, drily. "I don't believe many men would read your treatise." Whereupon he picked up his treatise and withdrew to his Anctum, leaving me to arrange the heads of my "discourse," or to ponder the meaning of his last equivocal observation.-   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH     MOTHERS.   47 And thus it came to pass, that, sitting lonely here, and arranging plans for the coming festival-the jubilee that, throughout Christendom, commemorates the birth of a little Child in the grotto of far-off Bethlehem; musing .of that Child and his mother, while from the wall, the Mater Dolorosa, wondrous in beauty and in sorrow, looked down upon me- thought followed thought, and memories- sweet, ten- der, and full of joy, others sad, yet precious, and mingled with wistful yearning, flowed in uipon me, and I have taken up my pen, not to indite a lecture or an essay, but a simple, homely, heartfelt Christ- mas letter to my fellow-workers in the great mission to which God has called us.

I know that such abominations do exist, and so does the fair reader, who is ready to ostracize me for daring to hint thus publicly at what she privately approves and advocates. I can see that our pleasure-loving neighbors over the water are in a fair way to be rivaled, if not eclipsed, in certain respects, by their American cousins. Further than this I will not go. I only refer to this, to me revolting subject, to substantiate a conclusion at which I have arrived in the course of my serious and often sadly troubled lucubrations with regard to this matter. It is my conviction that the real root of the evil lies back of this, its most reprehensible offshoot. I. have no means of settling the date at which the opinion or prejudice was implanted on this continent, but certain it is, that a vast proportion-I fear, a large majority -of American mothers, would secretly, if not openly, controvert my first proposition. There is among us, if not a woeful deficiency of genuine maternal instinct, a style-a fashion, if you choose to call it, and a   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.        49 very file fashion it is-of deprecating as a grievous affliction the repeated visits of what a higher authority than "the noted Dr.  -, from Paris," or the autocrat of neighborhood gossips, has- declared to be among Heaven's best gifts to human kind. "Poor Mrs. A., with her eight children, like a flight of stairs-just two years between them"-is, by her friends' very pity, made to feel that she is, in some sense, the inferior of Mrs. B., who "manages so beauti- fully!   She has but three, and they are seven years apart. It matters not that Mrs. A.'s household resembles a snug  nest of chirping birdlings, who lie all the warmer for being obliged to stow a little closely; who learn patience and loving-kindness and generosity by hourly practice  of these graces upon one another, without being aware that any lessons are set for them -they come so naturally; who, never lack company or sympathy, by reason of .the abundance of home companions   and home love; who bid fair to keep their parents' name long alive upon the earth, and, in their own maturity, to transmit to an extended circle-to a  large community-it may be to a  whole nation, the principles taught them at their mother's knees and from their father's lips. It signifies little   50  A dHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. to' the feininine cabal that each one ,of the little B.'s has been, for seven long weary years, that most for- lorn and pitiable of juvenile specimens-an only baby; -has become dwarfed, in affections; narrowed as to ability to love and to -enter into the feelings of other children; thoroughly, and often incorrigibly selfish; and when, at last, the lustrum. being accomplished, the newer infant is ushered into the world, the older regards it with dire distrust and lurking jealousy, if not avowed dislike, as the usurper of his or her, hitherto undisputed "rights. "My children will never be companions for one an- other; they are so far apart!" sighs Mrs. B., as the pert Miss of fourteen pronounces the tiny sister, who has not numbered as many hours of existence, " a reg- ular bore l" and "wonders why she came.  Nobody wants her; and it is too provoking to have a baby in the house just as one is beginning to go into society, and'wants a good deal of gay company." But Mrs. Grundy-an American Mrs. Grundy, you may be sure, with a dash of Parisian philosophy- has declared the one matron to be a broken-down druge, a domestic slave-" quite behind the times, in factl" while "Mrs. B. is a truly fortunate and"--   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHER S       61 here Mrs. Grundy whispers--"a very enlightened and judicious lady!" What an odious savor in Mrs. G.'s delicate nostrils would be the antiquated but pious friend who should, out of the plenitude of his love and good will for Mr. Grundy, pray, in the words of the Psalmist, -that his wife might be a fruitful vine, and his children olive plants round about his table! No! we do not, as a, class, appreciate the dignity- I use the word advisedly-the dignity and privilege of maternity! In this respect, our English sisters are far ahead of us. The Hebrew women, under the The- ocracy, understood it better still, when Rachel pined in her quiet tent for the murmur of baby-voices and the touch of baby-fingers, and Hannah knelt in the court of the temple, to supplicate, with strong crying and tears, that the holy fountains of motherly love within her heart might flow   out upon offspring of her own.  In those days it was the childless wife, and not she who had borne many sons and daughters, who besought that her reproach might be taken away; that she might be accounted worthy to be intrusted with the high duty of rearing children to swell the ranks of theLord's chosen people. "If I felt as you do," said a lady, sneeringly, to I*    52 .A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. *         I ,  a friend of mine; "if I considered the gift of chil- dren a blessing, and the care of them a delightful task, I would not wait for the slow process by which Nature creates families, but adopt a dozen at a time from an asylum." "They would not be mine!" was the quiet reply. I do not envy that mother her heart, who does not enter into the meaning of this rejoinder; who has not fez the delicious thrill of ownership in an object so lovely and precious as the helpless babe sie has braved death itself to win; the awed delight of con- templating the new creation-living, intelligent, im- mortal-given to be hersl  It may be- I have seen it somewhere asserted-that there is, after all, a species of sublimated selfishness in the ecstatic sweet- ness -of 'the thought so well expressed by Emily Jud- ,son:- "The pulse first caught its tiny stroke, The blood, its crimson hue from minel I The life which I have dared invoke Henceforth is parallel with THNE!" The candid reader who has known the depth and strengths of a mother's love, her patience, constancy, and self-sacrifice, will, I fancy, agree with me in pro- nouncing the selfishness to be very "sublimated."'   A CHRISTMAS TALLK WITH MOTHER S. 63 Said Mr. Toots, upon the occasion of the birth of his fourth daughter -"The oftener we an repeat that extraordinary woman the better!"-"Everybody laughs at the proud husband's praise of his spouse, but-ask your heart, loving mother, if there is not a strange fullness of joy in watching the reproduction of your traits, physical, mental, and moral, in your child?

How frequently, at the expression of her fancies, or opin- ions, or desires, do you say, with a smile, a sigh- perchance a  tear- II felt, or thought, or longed the same at her years; it is her inheritance?"Is there not a joy yet greater, an inexpressible swelling of love and pride, as you see in the lineaments and gesture of your boy, the faithful portraiture of one dearer to you than your own  soul?  I  am not talking now to those who have felt nothing of all this; from  whom the knowledge, of these sacred mysteries has been withheld, and who are incapable, from the barren- ness and shallowness of their own spiritual natures, of ever entering fully into them. It is useless to say to these that motherhood is, a  holy thing, and off- spring the boon .of Heaven; that, amidst the wild clamor of woman's rights and  woman's sphere, she   " A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. best 'enacts the role appointed her by the wise Parent of all, does most to elevate her race, who rears strong, good men, and gentle, noble daughters to serve God and the generation to come. To the gross, all things are gross, and these truths are pearls, too clear in their purity to be trampled by such.  I appeal to mothers-to brave, pious women who fear God and love their husbands -but who have yet never arisen to the perfect realization of the grandeur of the worlk assigned them; never thought of themselves as the architects of the nation's fortunes, the sculptors, whose fair or foul handiwork is to outlast their age; to outlive Time, to remain through all Eternity. I would awaken those whom the prejudice of education or the plausible sophistries of the modern fashionable school have blinded to the deep significance of those words-"Be- hold, children are an heritage from the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is His reward!"

Two of mine never breathed, and I experienced a sensation of joyful relief when' I found that my cares were not then to be -increased. Yet I love my chil- dren very much as they grow older, and my con- science assures me that I have discharged my duty to them faithfully. I accept them as inevitable evils which religion and philosophy require me to endure as well and gracefully as possible." Yet the speaker was not a "'strong-minded woman," in the popular acceptation of the term. She. believed in St. Paul, and had never read a word of Malthus in her life, if indeed she were aware of the existence of that author.- She reprobated women's colleges and learned ladies; stayed at home and kept her hus- band's house with all diligence, and was generally regarded as a pattern wife and estimable member of society. I declare, nevertheless, that if she spoke the truth in this instance, her babies were motherless. They had a capable nurse; one who discharged the external duties of her position with conscientious fidel- ity, and who, in the course of time, as any tolerably warm-hearted nursery-maid could not but have done,   6  A, CHRISTMAS TALK WITH .OTH MQ    RS S grew into a more lively degree, of interest in the win- some beings committed to her charge.

It is only among the ignorant or the reckless that we find total disbelief and utter neglect of the laws which treat of -the intimate and subtle re- lation existing between mother and  child.  It is no longer customary to scout as old wives' fables- the tales of horrible wrong done by passionate or impru- dent women to the bodies and intellects of their unborn babes. But we have still much t   learn, and more to heed upon this-vital point.   ! Passing thus briefly over the earliest phase6 of motherly duty, we come to the education of the living, breath- ing, "necessary evil," or cherished blessing, as the parent's taste or principles may determine the little stranger to be. The pink, plum-p, piping bantling has been exhibited to the usual round of ceremonious visitors, and passed muster with all-in the mother's hearing-having been praised by one as the image of his papa, and; by another, no less discerning, as his mother's miniature, and, content with having acted well its -part, in voting him to be a "romsnaAably fine child," the "cc finest of the season," Society dismisses the subject -and remands baby to his curtained crib in the darkest corner of the nursery.

Saciety cares or thinks, he may, in that convenient retreat, slumber away the seasons of infancy and adolescence in a sort of Rip Van Winkle torpor, until his long clothes- drop from his growing frame like the husk from a ripe nut.  Society does not regard a "human boy"-as Mr. Chadband has it--as having arrived at the "interesting Age" until he attains the age of discretion. Young lady cousins, enthusiastic school-girls, or matrons, incited to the examination by thoughts- of their own little ones, occasionally lift the lace curtain and turn down the coverlet; call him an "angel," and remark in rapturous whispers upon his increasing size and. comeliness, and forget all about him by the time they reach the foot of the stairs. Or, an old friend of the family who "dotes upon babies," begs:that the "cherub" may be brought down to the parlor, saying, in pathetic reproach, "To think,: my love, how  seldom I see the darling!f' Really deceived into a belief of the sincerity of her visitor's desire, mamnma sends off an order to nurse; baby is caught up from his crib of ease, thrust into a clean slip, his tender scalp brushed to the right' and left of the line--more or less imaginary--where the down--alias hair--ought to part, until the soft, throbbing spot on the top of his head pulsates faster   A CH1RISTMAS TALK WITH, OTHERS,       59 and harder with pain and fright. Duly prepared for inspection, he performs the journey to the lower floor, where he undergoes' a vigorous kissing from the -baby- ' lover, who "must hold him" herself. The blinds are opened, that his budding  beauties may be clearly seen, and while the connoisseur goes into a transport of admiration, Master Baby, alarmed, fluttered, and uncomfortable, first looks long and piteously into the strange visage above him, and proceeds to express his sentiments by wrinkling up his cherubic nose and opening his cherry mouth for a squall. "There! take him, nurse!" says the visitor, hastily. "He does not fancy new acquaintances.    In a year or two, he will be just at the interesting age, and we shall be capital friends. Not a word, my dear!"--to Damma, who stammers an apology. "All young chil- dren behave worst when we want them    to show off their prettiest ways." This may be true, but for my part I don't blame the babies. Most Papas are shy or negligent of their heirs or heiresses at this epoch.  It is quite common to hear ladies relate, as a proof, I suppose, of their spouses' superiority to  small matters, that they are utterly careless of their babies while they are in arms.   60  A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.

It will never need your gentle handling, your quick eye, more than at present.  A pin misplaced, a sudden wrench of a joint; the twist of the upholding hand, bringing the head-or a limb into contact with table or chair, may lay the foundation of years of pain and disease, if not of incurable deformity. We hear much talk about good and bad babies; how Mrs. Such-an-one always has model children, that give her no trouble at all; but sleep and eat at reg- ular seasons, and never cry when awake, unless they are in pain, while Mrs. So-and-so's existence is a woeful burden with her restless, fretful progeny, who turn day into night, and night into day, and some- times decline having any night at all in the course of the twenty-four hours; who are continually crying to be fed at all manner of inconvenient times; who are, in short, as wrong-headed and peevish brats as one can find in a day's ride.   Yet, Mrs. So-and-so sayfs that they are healthy and hearty, and suffer no pain. "It is just her luck to have cross children. All hers 'are born grabbed." In behalf of the infant tribe I enter a protest against this calumny. Well-bred, healthy, comfortable babies are never cross until they are rendered so, in   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.        63 spite of themselves, by misrmanagement.  1 Mrs. So- and-so 'puts her Bobby to sleep where) he is liable to be awakened by the ordinary noises of the household machinery, and, furthermore, when these, or some un- toward accident  as started him   from  the slumber that should have lasted two hours, before one-half of this time has elapsed, if she makes matters worse by taking  him up, instead of quieting all external dis- turbance  and lulling him  again to rest before he knows where he is, or what has happened; if he is fed  just when it suits Mrs. S.'s or  Bridget's con- venience  or Bobby's whim,  at intervals of varying lengths; the probability, I  may say, the certainty is, that Bobby will become   an unreasonable, discontented tyrant, a nuisance to himself and to all around him. And   if Susy, and Jenny, and Dicklry are all trained after the like manner, there is an equal certainty that Mrs. So-and-so will have, among  her acquaintances, the deserved reputation of being the worn-out, irritable mother of a   brood of cross, spoiled, "hateful" chil- dren. But, again I say, I don't blame the babies! First of all, make the darlings welcome;   that is half the battle I Then, make them comfortable.

Like their felliows of a larger growth, they are creatumes of habit. I wish- how fervently and how frequently, I dare inot pretend to say-that method, a wise and just system of duty and recreation, could be made the chief earthly law of every household. Let there not only be "ad place, for every thing and every thing in its place,?' but a -time for every thing, and let every thing be done in its season. When I see the mis- tress of a family toiling and worried from morning until night, pulled a dozen different ways at once, by as many duties, all of apparently equal importance, driving herself and servants, wearying her husband by incessant complaints, and dragging, rather than bringing up her children,- I wonder not that Amer- ican women break down so early, but at the tenacity of life that enables them to endure their load for a ingle year. The clever writer of an article, entitled "A Spasm  of Sense," published not long since, in *                     )   A CHE IST1AS TALtKWITH M:OTHERS., 65 one of our most clever monthes, finds the-cause of the lamentable condition of so many a domestic estab- lishment in the superabundance of olive-plants 'that crowd American -nurseries. From my different stand- point, I am   inclined to believe the trouble to be, not that there are too many babies, but that' there are not more wise and capable mothers. I know a lady whoawas, when she married, a deli- cate, 'beautiful girl, the petted favorite of a large eircle of admiring friends. The seventh anniversary of her wedding-day saw her the mother of five chil- dren. Acquaintances, 'who only heard of this rapid increase of --cares, shook mournful heads and  drew pitying sighs, between contemptuous smiles. "What a change 1" It was a   change, than which my  eyes have rarely beheld a  fairer. Her babies were not pattern, spirit- less dolls, but hearty, roguish youngsters, who frol- icked, and shouted, and disputed, as all sound, sprightly children will do, and as 'they should'not be hindered from   doing.

To each of the fast-coming troop she gave a motherly greeting, and, as by magic, brought it, with its wishes and needs, under the influence of the judicious law of order that extended over the rest of her band. She nourished them from her bosom; bathed, dressed, and undressed them, and herself laid them down for the nightly and midday slumber; made most of their clothing with her own hands; as they grew older, directed their studies-she "could not bear to send them from her to school!"Yet she was the ever-patient, ever-cheerful referee in their sports and quarrels; looked well tp the other ways of her household; was a faithful mistress, a good house- keeper, and a kind neighbor, and, withal, managed to keep up with the best literature of the day; and ! when her husband's business hours were over, became hris companion, at home and abroad, with more ease and frequency than any other wife I ever saw. This is no fancy sketch, nor. have I done the original justice. It is not surprising that the offspring of such a woman should rise up and call her blessed; the marvel and disgrace are, that there are not) hundreds and thousands like her, throughout the country. I do'not ask that our daughters should be brought up in the belief that matrimony is the chief end of !            ^  *:      !   b }      '  A CHREI STMAS TALK WITH MOTHERSB 67 woman's existence. I do hold, in consideration of the fact that an immense majority of our sex do marry and have the cares of a family laid upon them, that girls ought to receive a training which shall fit them, in some degree, for a position involving responsibil- ities so solemn and onerous. ;I know the popular outcry against the slavishness of maternal duties. "As well bury me alive after the first year of mar- ried life!" cries Mrs. A-la-mode. "I, with my edu- cation and accomplishments, may surely aspire to a higher position than that of nursery-maid! I consider that I serve my children more effectually by reserv- ing my strength and cultivating my talents against such time as their maturer minds shall require my companionship." In other words, Mrs. A-la-mode leaves it to hired menials to worl, irrigate, and plant the virgin soil, and expects, in the ripening of the harvest, to put in her patent sickle-latest style-and gather such grain as she shall then decree. I am acquainted with but one way in which a woman can conscientiously and surely evade the fnlfilment of a mother's obli- gations. In this day and ountry, there are no forced marriages. If Miss Faintheart and Miss Easy abhor   68  A CB-RISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. the prospect of directing and fostering a young family, they. can remain single; and, to be frank, I thinlk the next generation will be the gainers by their- celi- bacy.  Again and strictly apropos to this division of my subject- Babies have a right to be heard.  "(My dear children," said a Sabbath-school lecturer; "when I say ' boys' I mean girls, and when I say 'girls' I mean boys."         \ He designed to be entirely comprehensive in his ad- dress, and, engage the. attention of both sexes; but his juvenile auditors were evidently in a state of terrible conftiion after this lucid preamble, most of them imagining that he meditated some game of cross- purposesa; as when "Rise, No. 2"' means that No. 2 must do quite the, opposite thing and not budge, upon penalty of a forfeit. But when I say "babies," I mean children of tender years-legal infants-and do not confine myself altogether to those in arms. Especially has a baby a right to a tearing from Mamma.  Unless you have been so foolish as to let himi form a habit- of crying-and this should be care- fully avoided-his wail or scream always means that something is amiss, and it is your business to find out--what it is.

It is doubtful if you ever had what was to you a   greater loss than either of these is to him.

Eternity can only tell-who has not learned, frol ex- perience, the fullness and sweetness of that simple line," As one whom his mother comforteth." Never let your child have his cry out alone. If he is old enough to observe that yours is studied neglect, he has also sense sufficient to enable him to put his own construction upon what is, to him, your cruel indifference to his suffering; and just in proportion as he recognizes and resents this, your influence over him is weakened; his faith in your love shaken. If he- is too young to guess why you disregard his outcry, terror and pain lay hold of his spirit, as is evinced by the changed tone of his lamentation. Shall I tell you a little story, just here, one which is unfortunately drawn from life? A mother--a good woman, but a trifle too strong of will, and wedded to a pet theory of, family govern-  ment, according to which, children were but machines,  to be subject in every particular to the authority of the chief engineer-one evening laid her babe, about ten months old, in his crib, for the night. The child manifested great 'unwillingness to lie still, and pres- ently began to cry. The mother seated herself quietly to work upon 'the other side of'the room, and took no outward notice of his screams. An elderly gentle-   A CHRISTMAS    TALK WITH MOTHERS.      71 man, a relative, was present, and remonstrated with her upon her silence. "He will certainly injure himself, if you do not stop his crying!" "That is the old-fashioned doctrine," replied the parent, with a smile of conscious superiority.  "I always expect one grand struggle for supremacy with each of my children. He is in revolt now, and must be treated as a rebel. If I yield, and take him up, ' the lesson is lost." ('I don't ask you to take him up! Only speak to ,him.  He is well-nigh heart-broken. He will rupture a blood-vessel." ("No danger! It strengthens' his lungs to cry in that uproarious manner.  I have known babies to scream  for two  or three hours, without sustaining the least injury." "You will excuse me, at any rate, from    staying here to see the battle out!" and the uncle left the room. Returning, at the end of an hour, he found the child still screaming-now, in an anguished shriek that rent the man's heart.   The woman and mother sat still and sewed steadily-it seemed,calmly. "I can not and will not bear this!" ejaculated the   72  A CHRIBSTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. old gentleman. "If you don't take pity on that poor little thing, I,will " "Uncle!" the niece lifted her stern eyes. "I per- mit no one-not even my husband-to interfere in my management of my child.   His passion is at its. height. It will soon subside." The cries were, indeed, growing less vehement. Too anxious to retire again until the scene was over, the  j uncle walked  the room, hearkening, with tortured  nerves, to the feebler and still feebler wail; sinking, j by and by, into fitful sobbings - then, into pants like those of a tired, hunted-down animal.  These came  at longer and longer intervals-and all was still. The  uncle approached the crib, and bent over it.  "An hour and three-quarters!" said the mother,  triumphantly, looking at the clock. "You will find, uncle, that, having gained this victory, I shall never have another contest with him." A      j "You never will, madam!" ws the awful rejoinder. "Your child is -dead!" I wish I could say that this incident was of doubt- ful authenticity, but it is true, from beginning to end. I grant you that it is an extreme case, but)the like might occur with any -young child.   Ask yourself how you would endure a fit of violent hysteriqal   A CHRISTMAS TALK- WITH' MOTHERS.       73 weeping, for the space of an hour, or an' hour and three-quarters .

That which would exhaust and irritate your-lungs, "strengh- ens" his! If your older child has any thing to divulge which he deems important, contrive to give  him a patient hearing; encourage htm  to full confidence.  Many a life has been embittered by fears or fancies, that could have been removed as soon as they were formed, by five minutes' free conversation with a kind, sensible parent. To this day, I own to feeling an unpleasant sensation at the- sight of any singularly-shaped or col- ored cloud in the heavens.   This I attribute directly to a terrible fright I had when but four and a half years old. My nurse, a young colored girl-a genuine Topsey, by the way-had early instructed me in the popular belief concerning the personal appearance of His Satanic Majesty, and I had swallowed every word, until his horns, cloven hoof, forked tail, fiery breath, and worst of all, a certain three-pronged fork he was lin the habit of carrying   about with him, that he ,might impale unwary sinners, as Indians spear salmon-   74  A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. were articles of as firm faith with me as was the fact of my own existence. He had an inconvenient prac- tice of careering through mid-air-Topsey had added -with this trident already poised, on the lookout for bad little girls, who were supposed to be dainty tid-  bits in his estimation. One day, I was walking in the garden, unconscious of coming ill, when, chanc- ing to look up, I saw, righ. above me, a small, dark cloud, irregular in' outline, and moving swiftly before a strong wind. My first glance caught only this; my second traced, with the rapidity of lightning, the head, the tail, the lower limbs, and, brandishing wildly in air, the right arm, holding the fatal flesh-fork! St. Dunutan or Luther would have stood his ground, as did Christian against Apollyon, but I had not the pluck of these worthies, and had I been endowed with the spirit of all 'three, there were neither tongs, ink- stand, nor two-edged sword handy. So I chose the wiser part of valor, and ran, in frenzied haste, for the house, never stopping until I was safely ensconced under my mother's bed. Here I lay for a long time, quaking with fear, queer shivers running down my spine at thought of the sharp points I had so nar- rowly escaped. Then the supper-bell rang, and I crept out, unperceived. I had no appetite, and must   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS;        75 have worn a strange, scared look, for my-mother asked if I were sick  I answered, ' No," very shame-facedly, and she did not-press her inquiries Children are not apt to be very communicative as to any great fright, except in the excitement of the first alarm. They fear to live it over in the recital. That night, for the first time in my life, I cried to have the lamp left burning in the chamber where I slept. My mother reasoned with me, for a while, tell- ing me that the angels watched over good children, etc. This I did not doubt, but I was by no means sure that I was a good child. The--apparition of the afternoon was frightful circumstantial evidenceto the contrary. At last she scolded me for my cowardice and went away, taking the precious light with her. I wonder that my hair did not turn- white during the ensuing hours of thick darkness. I pity myself now, as I remember the poor, frightened baby, lying trembling on her little bed, and staring into the gloom, peopled by her imagination with horrors. Driven to desperation, I once awoke my older sister, who shared my couch, and, in an awe-stricken whisper, imparted my fears and their origin. She was not credulous or imaginative, and, perhaps, did not quite understand what I said, for her only answer was- "pshaw!" and    76  A CHERISTIAS TALK WITH MOTHERS. she was sound asleep again in a second. How and when slumber came to me I knew not, but my mother reproved me, next morning, for wrapping the coverlet so tightly about my head, saying that I would be smothered some night, if I continued the practice.  Three sentences from eitherof my parents would have laid the hobgoblin to rest forever, and I recol- leet that I did, several timesl essay to broach the subject to my mother, very unskillfully, I dare say, for she did not encourage my preliminary remarks, and resolution failed me before I reached the point. I was a tall girl of fourteen when I confessed to her that, for five or six years, I believed that I had really seen the devil! Lastly-for my rambling "talk" has already trans- cended the limits, I at first assigned to it-Babies have a right to be babies. That precocious and unnatural growth of prudence, propriety, and learning in young children, which is variously described as "old-fashioned," 1"smart," and "wearing a gray head upon green shoulders," is some- times an offensive, always a pitiable sight. A life without childhood is like an arid summer day, to which the dew of morning has been denied.  There e blossoms which the heat of incipient decay has  \     A CHRISTMAS TALK- WITT   H MOTHERS.

Happy is she- who has never had reason to tremble at sight of this early and.'brilliant bloom; -who has not wept unavailing-- tears over the pale blossom, as it lay, crushed and faded, at the grave's mouth! Well is it then for the bereaved mother's peace of mind if she can, in the review of the brief years during which the gifted one was lent to her, comfort herself with the thought that she strove, in patient, far-seeing love, to repress, rather than stimulate, the unhealthy growth of intel- lectual powers that were in danger of outstripping physical vigor; that 'she rose superior to the-vulgar ambition to have her child excel all others of his age in scholarship and showy accomplishments.  Ah I it is not until the golden locks are hidden by the green sod, and the busy brain forever still, that, recalling  the deep sayings and vivid thought-flashes that made us look upon our noble boy with such triumphant affection, we measure the short mound with tear- blinded eyes, and say: 'c We  should  have -known, from the first, that all our bright dreams for him were to suffer rude, terrible awakening hoeel  When we should have looked for the blade only,-the bud *     *   78  A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MO T.HERS. appeared and the flowers. The ruit could onlyripen in heaven!" Do not seek to make of your children monstrous, uncomely, infant phenomena. If, by some special inter- position of preserving mercy, their lives and health do not fall a sacrifice to your weak vanity, you will discover, when your prodigy has completed his course of book-study, that he is not one whit better fitted for the actual fight with life and labor than is the fellow-student who used to run wild, with torn hat, trousers out-at the knees, rough fists, chapped by wind and weather, and pockets frightfully distended by a miscellaneous collection of unripe apples, jack-stones, peanuts, top-cord, "taffey," whistles, gingerbread, pocket- knife, hard-boiled eggs, iron nails, of assorted sizes, and, perhaps, a liying specimen or two, in the shape of a spotted terrapin or a June-bug, with a string tied to its leg; the while your Pindar Augustus, in. white linen pants and cheeks to match, sat in learned abstraction from all mean and common things, his spine curved, and his baby-brows knit over his Homer or Euclid. It is distressing, yet instructive, to see how the mill of every-day life grinds down college geniuses into very ordinary men; how the oft-quoted logic of events proves the "bright particular star" of     A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.        79 -the family circle and the school-room to be, after all, a luminary of, at best, the fourth or fifth magnitude. You gain nothing except mortification and disappoint- ment, by cheating your wonderful scion out of his childhood. I am afraid that most of us, even those who have not fallen into the gravely absurd error just referred to, are yet apt to expect too much of our bairns. They may be marvels of sweetness, and sprightliness, and filial devotion, but they are only babies after all. "Children should be seen  not heard!" is often re- peated by us in thoughtlessness or ignorance of the real character of the maxim. It is illiberal and cruel, and belongs to the age when a father held almost unlirnited power over the very life of his child; when the younger members of the household never dared to sit down in the presence of their parents, without their express and gracious permission. I agree that a pert, loud-tongued child is an offence, at all times, but do not let us, on this account, condemn to silence the bird-like voices that make sweetest music in our hearts and homes. Even birds sing sometimes when we would rather they should refrain; so let us be forbearing with the clamor of the babies. Do not I   ,   80  A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS^. pretend to judge them by the rules you would apply to grown people. "Father!" says a bright-eyed boy, as his parent enters the house at evening, " did you remember to get me the ball you promised?" "I did not, Tom. You. shall certainly have it to- morroW." Tom goes off, in apparent content. In reality, he l  sorely disappointed; but he is a good child, and does not wish to make his father unhappy.   The promise for to-morrow helps him to bear the trial tolerably well. ' The next evening, he is more backs- ward about asking. He hangs around his parent's chair for, some time, in hopeful suspense, but as the longed-for plaything does not appear, he ventures timidly upon a diplomatic "feeler"- "  "- ather, maybe  you' ve. forgot your promise, again?" The father has had a harassing -day-filled with carding card-and the smouldering temper needs but a spark to linluence it. "Boyl" he ays, hastily, "if you ever say 'ball' to me again, you shall not have it at all! I will not be teased out of my life about your jimcracks!" Tom shrinks back, as if he had been struck in the   A CHRISTMAS TALK WITH MOTHERS.        81 face; creeps silently off to his little room, and there, in solitude, cries as if his heart would break. He has had a blow. It is not so much the loss of the toy, but his is a sensitive nature, and his father's words were sharp swords. He meant to be very good, very patient. Nothing was further from his thoughts Than to annoy his usually kind   parent. Mingling with, and embittering hiis grief, is a burning sense of in- justice. He knows that the injury was undeserved. "Father wouldn't have talked so to a grown manI It's just because rIm a poor little boy, and can't help myself!" I fear there is too much truth in this shrewd con- elusion of Tom's. We would not dare insult those of our own   age, as we do our children. "That boy is growing   sulky!" growls the father. "Did you see how glum he looked because I forgot a  paltry plaything? I must take him in hand!" Then is the time for you, the mother of the wronged child, to speak up  boldly in his behalf.  Represent kindly, but candidly, to your irritated lord, the true value of the promised gift to the boy, and the great- ness of the disappointment. "And after all, Papa, we  can not expect Tom  to exercise much self-control or self-denial yet.

There are times and circumstances in which it is very hard to remember that "babies will be babies."

They are loving, well-mearning children, and, for almost ten minutes, there is a refreshing season of calm.

He would not be a boy if he did not hurrah at the crash; the girls laugh and clap their hands; and uproar is shortly the order of the hour. Don't spring from your bed, and, confronting them with your pale face and bloodshot eyes, accuse them of disobedience and want of affection for you. They love you very dearly, and they "did mean to mind," they will tell you penitently, "but they just forgot!" It is baby-nature. to be forgetful, and I am glad that it is. The injuries, and slights, and wounded feeling of maturer years are enough to make of mem- ory a whip of scorpions.

The virgin purity of the snow must change, with dust and mel ng, into the hue of the earth beneath; but it is a woeful sight. We would fain delay the process by every means in our power.  Above all, let us make it our prayer that we may never forget that we were once children, and how we felt, reasoned, and acted then.
