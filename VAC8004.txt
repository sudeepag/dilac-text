He was a fine-looking young fellow of four-and-twenty, with a well-developed, sinewy figure, black hair, and a beard whose length, While it would have given an olutrh air to the visage of most men, was yet highly be- coming to his bronzed. complexion and marked physiogno- my.

Which was, being interpreted--"Aleck! Aleck! you are a sad fellow "I A"Can't help it, aunty! If the girls will be fascinating, they must take the natural consequence of their behavior, and endure my devotion with the best grace they can." "I thought you were going to bring her home to America with you?" "I would have done so, assuredly, had I known that you desired it, and if I could have decidad which 'her' you ex- pected me to elect to that supreme felicity." "Yes!? said Miss Ruth, in affectionate ridicule of this conceited speech. "  Tee 'her I meant was that Gret-Gret- na--or some such name you went crazy about, six months ago. It's queer I can't remember what you called her." "Gretna Green, perhaps?" suggested Aleck, with praise- worthy gravity. "'Yoti didn't mention her surname, but I think it more than likely that's the one-the beautiful German girl, whose singing and dancing, you said, had carried you into the se*ehth heaven-and all that sort of nonsense." GCretna Green is of Scotch extraction. Perhaps Gret- chen was the word you could not recollect." "Yes. Where is she?" "I really cannot say.. Probably married to some lager. loving Herr Von Something, making his sauer-kraut' and brewing his bier. I have not thought of her in five months, that I know of. I do remember, however, since you have   COLONEL FLOYD'8 WAREDS.       9 alluded to the subject, that she was quite a pretty girl, and sang tolerably." - Aunt Ruth shook her head again-now, in sorrowful de. precation of the criminal trifling he avowed so carelessly. "I was in hopes you meant to settle down for good and all! Not that I fancied over-much your marrying a foreign- er; and' of the two girls you've spoken of, I'd rather you had brought home the Scotch than the Dutch." "German'!" corrected Aleck. "It's all the same-,ain't it? Aleck! what possesses you to smoke that dirty-lookiong pipe? Maybe you haven't no- ticed how the amber is staining it through and through?' "Aunt Ruth! I am ashamed of you I This is a genuine meerschaum, and cost more money than Robin could get for the best horse in his stable!" "Yes? Let me see it!" She inspected the shining black bowl, with its curious cloudy veins, and the curved stem. "A mere sham-did you call it ." "Yes, ma'am. There areso few of the realarticles among -the many that pass with the verdant purchasers for valuable, that the contemptuous title deserved by the counterfeit has gradually been applied to all. There's a moral in the faet, if you. will take the pains to study it." "It iwants burning out badly!" said his aunt, disregard- ing his philosophising, and handing back the vaunted "real article," with an unmistakable contortion of the nose and upper lip. "It would be the sweeter, and so would your  mouth, for that matter, if you would leave it under the back- log there, all night. I could caution Marthy to be careful- not to crack -or break it when she-takes up the ashes to- morrow mornihg.", Managing his facial muscles with considerable dfficult, the fun-loving nephew explained that the discoloration she                o   10       COLONEL -FLOYD S WARDS.  -condemned was the prime beauty of the pipe, adding divers reminiscenees-authentic, of course-of the high estimate set upon long-used and well-blackened meerschaums by discrimi- nating Teutons. "( Reckon they are not such overly clean people, after all!" was Miss Ruth's conlusion, enunciated with disdainful em- phasis. "But seriously, my boy, what has become of this girl? not Miss Green-the other one! What broke off the match? You as good as told me you were going to marry her iight off." "I did! When-and how?' "In a letter, crammed from beginning to end with het praises, which you wrote me halfa year ago." "-( Ah! that was the end of the matter, I fancy. The flame burned itself'to ashes in that epistle. I cannot reimember certainly what disenchanted, me. I have an idea that it was Gretchen's imnmoderate fondness for cabbage in an ad- vanced stage of decomposition-so-called sauer-kraut." "Yes!"Aunt Ruth sighed. 'tYou don't think that a sufficient cause for a breach of promise, I see," said her nephew, in pretended anxiety. -"I am afraid you will never marry, Aleck!" "If I ever do, my wife's favorite dish shall be neither cabbage nor onions." "Yoiu are as bad as Colonel Floyd! When he has bacon and: cabbage for dinner, he won't allow Mrs. Floyd and the girls to tome to the table. He says it is only-fit for men to smee1. O  Once in a while he has an old-fashioned neighbor there, to Whom he wants to be polite; and since his rich friend'must have the dish, it is prepared, and the ladies don'ts make their appearance until the cabbage is rebmoved. rve heard, though, that Helen will not submit to this non. sense since she came of age-that she will take her place at table and entertain the company in her aunt's absence."'   COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS.        " "They are all well at Belleview, are they?" questioned Aleck, puffing away rather faster. at his meerschaum. "Yes." Mr. Lay turned at the hesitating tone, enwrapping so much of mysterious meaning, and ominous of ill-tidings. "t Why, what's the matter there? . Has any thing gone wrong?" "Nothing new-nothing-but what has been wrong from the start, and that was more years ago than most 'people dream of. Only--from all I can gather from people'd sly whispers-nobody dares say any thing aloud-things are looking crodkeder of late than they used to." She stopped to count the rounds in her sock, preparatory to turning off the heel Aleck said nothing, and seemed to watch the briskly-rising rings of smoke.  "This marriage is a serious business--one that is gener- ally entered upon too carelessly," resumed Miss aslsie, oracularly. "I don't know but you are right to be cautious about risking a chance in the lottery; but there are many worse faults in a wife or husband than a breath scented with cabbage or garlic. Colonel Floyd always reminds- me of the men of old who used to tithe mint, anise, and cinnamon, while they neglected the weightier matters of the3 law. If he had been as careful of his wife's property and happiness, and his children's real good, as he is to spare them a few trifling annoyances that nobody else would ever thinVr of, they'd be better off in mind and estate. They say he gambles awfully-worse than ever-,-and' that if half/ his debts were paid, he would not have Xa dollar or an acre of land left that he could call his own."  "Nobody is surprised at that, I imagine. People lave prophesied that for years past ;-although, as- you say, the real condition of his affairs may be more generally known, and spoken of more openly than it used to be," safd Aleck. S  12       dQZCOLONEL FLOYDAS. WADIS. AMds Ruth's needles rattled nervously against one another.  "Yes; but there's one thing that worries me more than all the rest. While I am, of course, very sorry for poor Mrs. Floyd and the children, still it's natural to feel most uneasy about one's own flesh and blood, and.--well-maybe I ought not to speak of it, even to you-but I'm very sure that Robert has lent ims money, and a good deal of it, and I am doubtful whether he will ever be paid." "You need not. be. There is a moral certainty that he will never;see a cent ofit again. No man ever did yet, who was so foolish as to lend any thing to the colonel. You can set .your mind at rest upon that score."' "Yes, I suppose so; but it is a pity and a shame, Aleck! I wish you co'td put Robert upon his guard. He's so soft- hearted and open-handed that- he can't say ' No' to any- body, much less to a friend. And he always defends Colonel Floyd when he is attacked; says he's not so bad as the world is Adisposed to think, and has some fine traits of character, and has always been very kind to him, and all such talk. You know Robert, and how easily imposed upon he is; and the colonel certainly puts himself out to be .polite and attentive to him, and, Robert told me, gave his -consent in the most handsome manner to his engagement with H elen Gardner, Gracibus, Aleck! you might have broleen it all to pieces!" Aleck stooped to-pick up the pipe that had slipped from hs- fingers and remained in that. position for a minute, busisy brushing the ashes from the gayly flowered hearth- rug--a manifestation of care and neatness which, if Aunt Ruth remarked, she attributed to the effect of his resi. dence among the cleanly Hollanders :"U%[y anda dirty as it is, it would have been a pity to break what cost so much money,- and is so hard to replace   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARIS.       13 in this country?, continued the thrifty housewife. "'Tis't cracked, is it?" "No! But I interrupted you! - What were you say- jig?"Aleck refilled and relighted his pipe, after seeming to examine it solicitously, and stretched out his feet as before. "You were talking about the Floyds." "Yes! so far as I -can judge, there is no love lost between.. Helen and her guardian. I don't think tffere ever has been. He has always found her an unruly charge, I reckon. So it isn't to please her that Robert let him have money, when he asked for it. It's just his own good-nature, and -he will suffer for it." "They have been engaged for some time, have they?" "Who? Robert and Helen? Four or five months. They seem very happy together, as contented . a couple as I ever saw. They expect to be married at Christas,; bet I suppose Robert has told you all about that." "At Christmas! and this is the first of November!" There was a dreary echo in his tone that reached- even Miss Ruth's apprehensions, and elicited a responsive sigh. "Yes-! it will be'a change for us all-for you and me, as well as them! But I hope it is for Robert's good. He will make one of the best husbands alive; and she has steadied surprisingly- sobered down more than I once thought she ever could, since they were first engaged. Do you recol- lect how wild she used to be " ' ' Yes!"  And after this musing articulation of his aunt's favorite monosyllable, there was an interval of silence. Miss Ruth plied her knitting-needles assiduously, and looked over her spectacles into the crackling -fire. - The nephew smoked slowly, and seemed to study the same blazing pile of hick- ory logs. What were her motherly and housewifdy medi- tations, it concerns us not to inquire. The central figure i o "      ' ' ' ,   COLONEL FLOYDI^ WARDS. his dream-pictures was a young girl, with flashing, laughing ,eyes, and dark chestnut locks wound ia heavy braids about her nobly-shaped- head: form erect, yet pliant; dancing feet whose rapid beat was sweetest music to his ears. "Did he recollect howr wild she used to be t" . Mrs. Floyd, sober and shocked, had oftentimes expostu lated with him for aiding and abetting her harum-scarum niece in her hare-brained pranks and lawless proceedings. He had taught her to sit firmly his most spirited hunter, in leaping fences and ditches; to fish, and, most barbarous of all pursuits for a young lady--to hunt! to carry her fowl- in piece and bring down her game with the coolness and address of a veteran sportsman. This last named accom- plishment was rather practised in. secret, than alluded to in public. It was doubtful whether Mrs. Floyd was ever quite sure that Helen had really acquired it. Many a day had she, spent in the woods iin" company with Aleck and-Robert, when governess and guardians had granted her permission to pay a proper, hum-drum visit to Miss Ruth. An unfor- tunate accident finally cured her of her Nimrod proclivities. The three were out turkey-hunting, one day, and Aleck, having stationed Robert with Helen behind the blind of brushwood and bushes, to await the coming of the fright. ened' and scattered flock, grew impatient of the tardiness of the dogs sent to "flush'" the birds, and started off him- self to seek and direct them. He was not long in discover. ing a fine, gang of turkeys, and after assuring himself that 'many of them had taken the direction he desired, undertook to regain the covert by another route.', Crouching low, that his head might not appear above the undergrowth of the wood, he made his way rapidly and stealthily towards the amlbuscade. -He was within twenty yards of it, when the crack of a gun rang out upon- the forest stillness. Helen, excited- and impetuous, had mistaken the"slight motion   COLONEL FLOYD B WARDS.       15 created by his passage among the .bushes, for the advance of the expected game, and fired before Robert cold inter- fere to prevent her rash action. :The Charge from her weapon lodged in Aleck!s -shoulder' and the upper part of his chest, inflicting a-severe, and, as. they, in their inexpe- rience, feared, a fatal wound. Bleeding and suffering-ignorant as his companions of thie extent of his danger, the elder brother still retained his habitual power of resolve and command. "Leave me here-both of you!" was his order. "Robert!. you will see. her home! then ride over to Greenfield and bring a couple of men back with you. And, my dear fel. low! mind! I did it myself  . Helen interposed with a passionate burst of self-accusa. tion. It was all her work-her unpardonable stupidityl her cruel, cruel blunder! and she alone' should be blamed for-it! -She deserved the most severe things that could be said of and to her! "Nelly!"The wounded youth looked up with his own saucy smile. "Do you remember what that old Hebrew king-Abimelech, I believe it was-said to his armor- bearer, when a woman cast a piece of millstone from the wall of the besieged city, and cracked his crown? '.Draw thy sword, and slay me,' that men say not- of me-] -.'A woman slew him!' Robert, youwill do as I said?" Robert hastened away in quest of help; but Helens will was not to be borne down in this matter. For two -hoi'rs-- long in their anguished suspense to her;--short and, deli- cious as a dream of Paradise to the injured boy,-she ilin. gered beside him in the heart of that "lonely forest; stanching the blood with such 'appliances as were within her reach; making; him a pillow of leaves; fanning him; gently wiping his brow, when the pain, that-coulianot ' extort groan from the manly heart, or dim his grateful- smile, 7                   16S      COLONEL FLOYD' S WARDS. ,forced great-beads of sweat through the pores. ^ Nay, more! when the sound of voices was heard approaching the spot, and hebesought her for both their sakes to make good-her retreat before she was perceived by curious or unfriendly eyes, she gazed long and earnestly into his face, a looklthat awoke a new thrill of life in the fainting heart, and, the tears raining down her cheeks, bent over and kissed him. When Robert and his attendants arrived at the scene of the accident, Aleck was alone, lying quietly upon his leafy couch, more than serene, with a happy light upon his counte- nance that glorified and elevated everyfeature. It was but the commencement of a splendid hunting season-the finest, that had been known in' years--when he was shot, and he lost the whole of it. Miss Ruth marvelled at and lauded hit patient endurance of his tedious confinement; his com- rades were affected with equal surprise at the cheerful equanimity with which he received their raillery upon his awkwardness in hitting himself,-he, the best shot in the country!  "Merely a difference of ame, boys!" he said, gayly. "I went to look for turkeys, and brought down a great goose instead!" Robeft carried daily health bulletins to Colonel Floyd's, and never returned without some token of remembrance or sympathzing message from Helen. Sometimes she wrote to the ivailid. -Every one of these hastily penned hotes- incobhrent, girlish, extravagant-was treasured up to this dayoced away, as too sacred for other eyes;-perfumed with the roses she had sent by his brother's hand. The three guarded well their secret; but Helen never hunted again. If she had not lost her unfeminine hankering for a personal participation in the amusement, she shrank fr6m its practice with trembling.' ..                        .   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       17 She was but fifteen then,-scarcely more than. a child. Robert was two years older, and Aleck his senior by eighteen months. He was twenty-two when he went to Germany, and it was still "Aleck" and "Nelly" between them. Still they laughed, danced, rode and sported to. gether, the acknowledged ringleaders of every frolic- the wilder the better--and Robert was the balance-wheel to their impetuosity. He was mirthful, and loved fun as dearly as did either of the others, but he exhibited a gentle steadiness of demeanor, a graceful propriety of action, that caused him to be extolled by all the matrons of the region as a "pattern young man, and a safe chance for any girl." Nobody called Aleck Lay an unsafe chance, yet his popu- larity never equalled his brother's.- He was too unscrupu. lous in speech, often reckless and imprudent in manner. The weak-minded and timid feared- his lash of ridicule; hypocrites and pretenders, his fearless exposure of Itheir true characters.' Little cared he for popular judgment, for public favor, -or public reprobation! Aunt Ruth petted him; Robert loved him; and Helen was his willing ay his fast friend, his confidante upon all subjects save one.  Their farewell, prior to his departure for the Old World, was spoken in the interval of the dankce, at a large party given st Colonel Floyd's in celebration of Lily Calvert's-a niece and another ward of the coionel's-birthday.' "It would hardly be honorable in me were I to- say to you all that is in my heart," Aleck had. said, hurriedly; "for this avowal would force you to a corresponding- frank' ness-and I shall be absent a lojng time-and we are both very young. It would be basely ungenerous, were Ito at; tempt to bind'you by a promise now."  His color came and went almost as rapidly as "did hers,; and his wholebehavior wsyoddlyat variance with ei us. easy, self-assured bearing. . ...   VV*AV.4 JJ vX  JFA ArP --TY p- ". But, if my presumption in daring to speak of this mat- ter-to think of you, to hope and dream, as I have for years, has not offended you; if you will still keep your early play-fellow in remembrance-still permit him to cherish your image where he has always worn it-in his heart of heart--may I ask you to wear this while I am ,away? It is no signal of bondage, recollect! It leaves you free as air.: When I return, if I do not see it on your finger, I shall, nevertheless, have no right to feel myself ill-treated-shall never molest you by demands for any ex- planation." They stood apart from the crowd, at a window partially concealed byea curtain. Without a word-only with one thrilling look into his eyes, that revived the memory of the forest scene, she drew off her glove-his hand touched hers 5-held it for a second! The next minute a partner claimed her for the ensuing set, and led her away, dreaming as little of the ring hidden by the snowy kid, as did the throng at large of the wild throbbings of the heart-the mingled rapture, pain, and unrest masked by Aleck Lay's - laughing face. Helen was never more gay than during the remainder of the revel; and his spirits seemed to keep pace with the rise of hers. Their last dance together was a dashing,- sweeping waltz, whose almost frantic swiftness, and the length of time they kept it up, set all the prudes' heads to. wagging in holy horror, and drew from kind, lov- - ing, charitable Aunt Ruth a deprecating -remark to her nephew. Robert. "SWe's agood-hearted girl, I don't doubt, Robert! And i1ave great confience in her principles; she wouldn't knowingly do aswrong thing; but it's a pity the poor child has no mother!"? The rout over, the adieux were brief-a single glance was interchanged, and a hand-clasp, fervent, but not pro.   COLONEL FLOYDS - WARDS.       19 longed;--a jesting phrase, intended for the benefit of the bystanders,- "Good-by, Nelly! Take care of yourselfl" and "Good-by, Aleck! I suppose we shall not see you again until you are a fat Mynheer, whose thick tongue. will be' unintelligible to untravelled ears." This was all! As he had said, they were both very young then; it was his choice to leave her untrammelled by the shadow of a pledge. The ring might have been a friend's parting gift. She was a woman now--more grave, more thoughtful, more judicious than in the days when she seem- ed to prefer his society to that of other admirers-even to Robert's; a woman who had chosen for herself a life part- ner, and who would, in seven,weeks more, be his brother's wife!  He thought all this over, without the change of a muscle or an audible sigh. His will was strong, and his pride stub- born; himself one of the men who can meet death, however horrible its form, with a steady or smiling front, if it be proved to be inevitable, and there are others looking on to mark how they sustain the trial. His voice, cheery and unfaltering, ended the protracted pause. "All, well, aunty, you and I need not stay here to em- barrass the movements of the rightful master and mistress of this establishment. -Greenfield is a dear and -lovely spot to us both, but duty and expediency unite in forbidding my longer residence here. Maple Hill is sadly in want of a tenant, and I have always looked forward to a settlement of myself and worldly goods there when I should be ready to begin life in earnest. But I cannot keep house by my- self, you know. It would be a doleful and disgrwaefl Bach- elor's Hall, that would cause you to disown me forever. I must have somebody to scold the maids, to pour out my   COLCNEL FLOYD'S WABD. coffee and lecture me occasionally. You will not mind the change of home so much as if I invited you to be my com- panion in a strange neighborhood and unfamiliar house, will you?" "I was born there, lived there until your mother and grandfather died, and your father begged me to come here and take charge of you boys!"  A tear found its way from beneath the spectacles. "And you havr no idea what an exemplary character I mean to become," pursued Aleck. "Not quite so good as Robin, to be sure, but a very decorous and decent young man, notwithstanding beard and meerschaum." Miss Ruth smiled up at him affectionately. Scapegrace though she was often obliged to consider him, he had ever been her favorite of her adopted children; and the vision of an independent home with him was far more pleasant, more in consonance With her tastes, than the thought of resigning the insignia of authority, i. e., the keybasket, into the hands of Robert's wife, and the meek acceptance of a secondary position in the court where she had reigned supreme for upwards of twenty years. "You were always kind-hearted and generous, Aleck  one of the sort whose worst side i the outside. I hope you'll get a good wife of your own some day." "Don't trouble your brain with such useless wishes and unprofitable imaginings, aunty I I do not Whyl it is ten o'clock! Is Robert generally so late in returning from court?'  "No! -I'm--afraid he went home with Colonel Floyd I He often does. It is naturally hard work for him, now he is in lote, to pass the Belleview gate olr his road, especially when he thinks tLat there is nobody ere but me, and knows thatI am never lonesome. We had not an idea of seqing you foafor a fortnight to come. How stupid and selfish it vas   m me not to think sooner of sending a boy to the colonels to inquire if he was there. But, you see, I kept expecting him every minute." "Exactly! I understand! I am glad your after-thought came so late. I would not have him disturbed from his present agreeable quarters on my account. You think that he will not be home to-night, then?" "Hardly.  He usually stays at the colonels all night when he goes there from court. I suppose that, like most other courting couples, they sit up till past midnight, and he doesn't like to trouble me by coming in so late. I should think they would have talked it all out before this time, but that is always the way. Engaged people never seem at a loss what to say to one another."- "Theirs is a theme which is exhaustless, until after mar- riage " said Aleck,yawning and rising. "I feel tired after my journey, and it is already long past your bed-time. Good-night!" . His chamber was the same he had shared -with Robert until their separation, two years before; the same in which he hSd lain, helpless and suffering, during the weeks that fol- lowed the accident already described. There was a bright fire on the hearth; his mother's picture, the object of his boyish idolatry, still smiled down at him from its place above the mantel; every article of the old familiar furniture was endeared to him by its associations of a happy childhood and joyous, hopeful youth, yet the place was inexpressibly cheerless and desolate; awoke a sensation of homesickness, more acute than any he had felt in the way-side inns of for- eign lands. He looked through the window. The moon shone with fitful lustre between flying clouds; the high autumn wind roared through a pine-grove to the right of the house, and tore showers of leaves from other trees-the dismantled   22     -  COLONEL -FLOYD S WBDS. boughs grpaing in every fibre as they gave up their summer treasures. It was a weird, dreary night to a solitary and sad watcher, whether his lonely vigil were kept above a dead form or a dead hope; a night to make friends draw closer the ring surrounding the social blaze, and talk more earn'estly and frankly; a night to cause lovers to cling more nearly and fondly to one another, to feel, as they had-never done before, the warmth and blessedness and glory of that heart sunshine which beamed the fairer for the rush and crash of outward storms.  ' This is my welcome home!" --'He left his look-out; went to a trunk which, with the rest of his baggage, stood against the wall, unstrapped and open- ed it; and took from its depthsa pretty casket. The lid of this was raised, and a subtle perfume stole through the adar. ment-the odor ofrose-lea es, Then, the entire contents of the box were emptied upon the table: notes, dried flowers, a knot of blue ribbon--lastly, a lady's cambric handkerchief, with dark-red- stains upon it. -With this, the rude compress of moss and bruised herbs had been bound upon his shoulder on that memorable'day. One corner bore a name. He tore this off and threw it into the fire, turning his back that he 'might *not seeit burn; the rest, cambric, papers, withered stalks and petals, were rent into sm1ll bits, not impatiently, butt caref-ully, deliberately, as one performs a solemn duty, rTe-ollected and returned to the casket. The November blast screamed hoarsely past his ear as he lifted the sash. In a second it caught the pile of fragments; whirled them aloft; dashed them downwards; scattered them far and wide over plain, hill, and grove. "So let it be 1" was all Aleck said, as he lowered the window.    COLONEL  FLOYD B WARDS.      23 CHAPTER    II. THER  was "'no lack of cheerful company in Colonel Floyd's parlor that evening. The colonel himself read the papers he had taken from the post-office in the afternoon-- seated by a round stand at the warmest corner of the fire- place. So real was hisabsorbed interest. in the sheet he held, that his presence imposed less restraint than it was wont to exert upon the innocent hilarity of the junior por- tion of the party. He had enjoyed in his younger days the reputation of being the handsomest man, the best rider, and most graceful dancer in the county, and the years which had frosted his hair, and made rigid the once flexible lines of his face, had not bowed the stately form, robbed the eye of its fire, or the limbs of their strength. He looked proud and resolute, and he was both of these, and more,-proud, with:a haughtiness that inspired dislike and fear, ratherthan respect; arrogant and overbearing to an extent iihich made him popular throughout the region where he would have ruled with absolute sway. in his famnily, he was an auto- -crat; upon his plantation, a despot, whose laws were Draconian'in severity; everywhere, in theory and in praM tiee,-he was an aristocrat of the -sternest type. It was atcom. mon saying among the working classes, that it was -almost as much as a poor mants life was worth- to press Colonel:Floyd for the payment of a just debt; yet no tradesman or me- chanic durst refiuse!him unlimited credit. It is a sight that may be seen every day in other communities, North, East e,   24       COLONEL FLOYDVS WARDS. and West, where the feudal system has never prevailed as  it did at the date of our tale, in this old Potomac county of Maryland,--I mean the supremacy accorded to a single in- dividual by those, his) equals: and betters in all respects-- merely because he, out of the pride and mightiness of his inflated heart, chooses to proclaim himself a prince and a lord over them. Some of those whom he counts his vassals are too indolent, others too cowardly, others still too amiable, to dispute his reign, and, unchecked, he flaunts his dictator- ship in the 'eyes of his amused or disgusted fellow-citizens, until a Tyrant, stronger and grimmer yet than he, forces him to discharge the last humiliating debt of Nature; proves him to have been, after all his pomp of place and cir- curistance, but common clay.       t The Floyds had, from  their family seat of Belleview, governed the adjacent countyfor three generations back; and distasteful as was the bearing of the present proprietor to his 'well-born, well-bred, and wealthy neighbors, they never thwarted, very rarely contradicted him, Behind his back, he was stigmatized as violent, unscrupulous, and dissi- pated-a rout and a gambler; a bully and a swindler; yet, not one of his uncomplimentary friends ever thought of testifying his disapproval of a course so disreputable by de- clining the hospitalities of Belleview, and obliging his wife and daughters to do the same; none withheld from him the grasping hand and hearty salutation of delighted civility; few there were who did not feel and express themselves as pleased and honored by his visits to their houses, -Upon the opposite side of the hearth was rs. Floyd, mild, inane, and faded-as might have been predicted of the sweet-tempered, spiritless beauty and heiress, who had, at eighteen, wedded this imperious partner. She feared- her husband, loved her children, and found her chief pleas ures in housekeeping, gardening, and the participation in an occa *   ,  I   COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS.       25 sional weak and- innocuous dish of gossip with some con- genial visitor. At the period of her marriage, she had represented several ciphers, prefaced by amore important figure, and these, it was surmised, had formed her principal recommendation, malors her bright eyes and peachy bloom, in the sight of the bridegroom. But beneath his hot, hasty fingers, the sum of which she was the sign and seal had melted away, until the total and her consequence to her spouse had dwindled, in a like proportion, to a for- lorn 0. Yet they maintained the state they had borne when cash was plenty, and houses nor lands were overshadowed by cumbering -mortgages. In mansion and farm and sta- bles, there was no symptom of the d6cay of wealth or gen- tility. People said that they were going down hill, while all agreed that, during the colonel's lifetime, his family would never be allowed to soil their dainty feet with the mud; that to those, reared as they had- been, lies a dread and hopeless quagmire,--filthy and unfathomable, in the vale of Poverty. As for Mrs. Floyd, it may be safely affirmed that the idea of such a descent, the bare prospect or possibil- ity of this terrific fall, had never occurred to her mind. She was half dozing now over a knitted edging she was manufacturing of fine spool cotton-a vacant smile upon her features, a meaningless smirk, that was supposed to in- dicate excessive amiability, which brightened mechanically, as, now and then, a merry out-burst from the group of young people reached her drowsy senses. This was her usual style of entertaining her nieces' visitors. This group, consisting of six persons,-three ladies and a corresponding number of gentlemen,-were gathered about a table in the middle of the large room, engaged, evidently to their own most- lively gratification, in the game of "Con- sequences." The table was littered with the folded slips of paper, so well known to the lovers of the play,.and- each ,    26  :    COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. one held a pencil. The member of the little band who would soonest have attracted the notice of a stranger, was Lily Calvert, the younger of Colonel Floyd's wards,-and his own niece. Her chair -was set in the full glare of the lamp that lighted the scribblers in their -employment. She was nearly nineteen, years of age, but not taller than many girls are at ten, with pale gold curls floating loosely upon her shoulders; exquisitely shaped and extremely small feet and hands; large, melancholy blue eyes, with drooping fringes, and a voice clear and sweet as that of a bird. But her complexion, to which she owed her pet name, now the only one by which she was ever -called, formed the marked peculiarity of her appear- ance. It was white as the purest wax; never warmed by a tinge of color, whatever were her feelings; and her lips had, usually, a bluish tinge. The most obstinate unbeliever in the reality of su'ch phenomena could not, in surveying her, help crediting the explanation of this one, commonly reported among those who were conversant with the family history. Eghert Calvert had married Colonel Floyd's only sister, and settled with her upon the estate bequeathed to her by her father. One night, less than a year from the wedding- day, he was brought home a corpse, stark, cold, and bloody, having been picked up from the roadside by some belated passers-by. He had not a known enemy in the world; no man was more popular and respected, and, in the absence of all testimony tending to prove human agency in producing his death, the ghastly cut upon the back of his head, which had crushed in the skull, was somewhat lamely accounted for by the supposition that his horse--a fiery and imper- feetly broken colt,-had thrown him with violence against the rocky road on which he was lyingswhen found. The poor wife never smiled again; seldom spoke a valuntary , f          t   COLONEL rLOYDS8 WARDS.       27 word. hfter recovering from the swoon into which she fell at the fatal spectacle; but it was not until Lily's birth that- she manifested unmistakable signs of derangement. Luna- cy was not reckoned a disgrace in this patrician community. On the contrary, its frequent appearance in the best, that is to say, the wealthiest and proudest class es, caused it to be recognized as an aristocratic complaint, produced, as it undoubtedly was, by the need of an admixture of fresh, new blood with the thin, blue current cousin had poured into cousin's veins, from one generation to another, for a hun- dred years and more. The Floyds had, like the; rest of those who plumed themselves upon being of "good old stock," been pertinacious in the practice of intermarriage. Grandfather, father, and son had espoused first cousins, and the State Asylum was the more populous by reason of their adherence to ancient customs. So Charlotte Calvert, bereaved of husband, and, more mercifully, of reason, iwas consigned by her affectionate relatives to the safe and comfortable retreat where others of her race were enjoying' a peaceful home; her brother assumed the control of her property, as guardian of her child and trustee for herself, and Mrs. Floyd opened her motherly arms to the worse than orphaned babe.' She had no daughters of her own,-had been, as the phrase'is, " un- fortunate" in her children. Her eldest boy was born an 'idiot, and, 'at the. time of our story, was an inmate of the same asylum in which his aunt, Mrs. Calvert, was confined. The second, a beautiful, intelligent child, lived 'to 'be two years' old, and was then snatched from her within a day after the commencement of the disorder by an attack of croup; the third, a girl, died a few hours after its birth. This event occurred almost simultaneously with the' little Lily's advent, and the latter gained, by means of this asso- ciation and her own sad helplessness of condition, such a i.    28      COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS. hold upon the heart of her foster-mlother, that the subse- quent- arrival of four sons, three of'whom were still alive, could not dispossess her of the first place in the good lady's affections. Her uncle did not pet her; he never petted any thing, not even his most valued racer; but neither did he scold and rebuf and cuff 'her, as it was his habit to treat his own offspring, and'thus she grew to regard herself, and to be regarded by others, as a favorite with him. She was a spoiled child from the beginning of her existence; but more self-indulgent than selfish; exacting of notice and love, and disposed to be jealous of superior attentions bestowed upon others; yet it was so natural to admire and humor her; she was so pretty and petite, and her naive, winning ways so like those of a gleeful, graceful little girl, that it was not often she had reason'to complain of being overlooked. Her supporters on either hand -at the table ,were Tom Shore and Junins Dickson, beaux from the vicinity, who had made'this their halting-place on the way homewards from the county court-house-quite a fashionable practice with the young men for twenty miles around. Facing. her sat Virginia Shore, Tom's sister, an intimate friend of the cousins and a gay-spirited' rattle; next her, Robert Lay, and beside him, his betrothed, Helen Gardner, looking very much as Aleck's yearning heart was then picturing her in his fireside visions, only with a richer maturity, a ripeness of womanhood upon her, that Miss Ruth may have had in her mind, when she essayed to describe the change 'that had taken place in the girl since her engagement. Robert was a trifle shorter kthan his brother, but still a well-made, tall figure, with pleasant hazel eyes, light hair, clear com- plexion, a mouth that betokened sweetness of disposition and delicate sensibilities, a voice at once manly and gentle, and a full, curling auburn beard. He was a handsome fellow; companionable to a charm; easy-tempered to a   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.        9 fault; ald universally beloved by high find low. By unani- mous-acclamation, he was chosen reader of the party; and in his manner of collecting the folded slips, as'each writer pronounced his or hers ready, there was a frank, smiling courtesy, so natural and customary with him, that he was unaware of its manifestation, but which wrought its effect upon those he addressed. "Are you ready, Miss,Helen?" he said to his right-hand neighbor, when all the others had given in their contribu- tions. "Not quite! I am stupid to-night!" "I believe you aire!" retorted Lily, with a slight spice of pettishness in her manner. "You have been behindhand in every round. If you will write what you are dreaming' about it will interest us, I have no doubt." "Never mind! There is time enough, and to spare," observed Robert, kindly, as, Helen bent down,-her face crimsoning with shame or impatience, and scribbled away desperately at the limited space remaining for her to fill. He pretended, further to relieve her, to be busied in sorting the narrow strips of paper deposited in his care. "There!"  Helen pushed hers towards him, and threw herself back in her chair. "My invention'is exhausted! I shall retire at the next round." "Do as I do, and write -whatever nonsense first occurs to. you," replied young Lay. "I should never progress beyond a single line if I attempted to be brilliant!" The game of "Consequences," I may as well state, for the information of those who, from the misfortune of ignorance, or the wilfulness of superior wisdom to such frivolous amusements, need enlightenment upon the subject, is conducted after this wise. A half sheet of note-paper is, furnished to each person who desires to -take part in the entertainment, and he or she writes at the top of this a   character or personal description applicable to a lady--as "the fair and witty," or the "' homely and shrewish"--folds this down so carefully that no part of the writing is visible, and passes it to the one sitting next the said him or her, on one side, receiving at the same moment a similarly prepared page from the neighbor on the other hand. Next co6mes the lady's name, usually that of some friend or acquaintance of the writer; then, a description masculine, and a name; the place of meeting; what he said, and her reply; the con- sequence of the interview, and, as a finale, the world's opin- ion upon the matter. The best fun of the performance is the marvellous and oftentimes ludicrous coherence of the narrative, written piece-meal by so many hands, each scribe being perfectly ignorant of a single word that precedes his own addition to the story. There were a few blushes and a great deal of laughter upon the present occasion, as various good hits and strikingly appropriate allusions were given to the auditors in'the reader's best style.     I At length came a tale that awoke different sensations in the breasts of all, that was felt acutely by at least one mem- ber of the company:- "The graceful and winning Miss Lily Calvert and the re. fined and chivalrous Mr. Robert Lay met in Colonel Floyd's parlor. He said, "' How happy could I be with either, Were t'other dear charmer awayl' "She answered, weepingly, "' The moon looks on many brooks; The brook sees but one moon.' "The consequence was, that the loss of her wits followed upon that of her heart, and his comfort and happiness were not at all damaged thereby. Tile world said--' Poor thing I what else could have been anticipated from her antece. dents '"' *   One or two tried to .raise a spasmodic laugh, and nobody looked-at Lily, whose forced mirth jarred upon every ear, while her taper fingers interlaced each other tightly on the table. "Bah!" said Helen. "That is the flattest thing we have heard yet I! Give us another, if you please, Mr. Lay." No one, unless it were himself, in their private interviews, ever heard her call him "Robert" now-a-days. "This looks racy!" remarked he, catching a glimpse of the names heading the one he was unfolding. "The witty and accomplished Miss Helen Gardner, and the learned but cynical Mr. Alexander Lay, met behind a turkey-blind. He said-' False as fair! did you not plight your troth to me? -Was not this ring the seal?' She said- 'Alas! it is too late! They told me you loved another!' The consequence was that she married his brother, and he lived and died a crusty, rusty, fusty old bachelor. The world said-'It is dangerous, this playing  with edge- tools!'" Robert's smile was free of all unpleasant meaning, as he flashed a merry glance at his betrothed. "Reefs ahead!" he said, in a playful" aside," inaudible to others, amidst the chattering that succeeded the reading of this, the last paper. "I must be on the look-out!- You know that we expect this dangerous rival: of mine in the course of a week or two, do you not?" 'I No-I had not heard! I Let me look at that nonsense!" She took the slip he was twisting between his fingers, perused it scrutinizingly, probably to assure herself that no two sentences were penned by the same individual, cast it. down contemptuously upon the pile with tho rest, arose, and left the room.   '     The entrance of a servant with a tray of refreshments di. verted the attention of the others, and Robert was not long   --V A ALv o a0 rtW Uj. finding and irproving a favorable opportunity for follow- img Helen. They. often met, when there was colnpany in the parlor, in the dining-room just across the hall, where the fire was never suffered to go out in cold weather; and since he had signified to her, earlier in the evening, his wish to see her alone by-and-by, it argued no unreasonable vanity on his part that he fully expected to find her there awaiting him-. But the room was deserted. The fre had been re- cently replenished, doubtless by some sagacious servant in anticipation of the conference he hoped for, and the ruddy shine showed him distinctly every object in the spacious apartment. An unlighted candle was on the table; two comfortable chairs Were set in affectionate and suggestive proximity to one another, in front of the hearth. She will be in presently!" was his mental comment upon the disappointment, andhe sat do wnto bideher easure or qonvenience. Five-ten-fifteen -minutes went by, and while he chafed less at the delay than a mo  irritable man ouldhave e, he yet experienced a growing and disagreeable sentiment of impatience.  "CAt last!" Footsteps approached along the corridor. He stood up to welcome the late comer, with no intention of offering her a reproach or even aremonstrance. Truegallantthathewas he never thought of assailing her with such. If he were her knight, he was her vassal likewise; bowed to her will inglad humility, as in courtly grace. His countenance changedas he listened. Helen's light foot never tro the floor with that lazy shuffle; nor was it her habit, even in the days when she "used to be so wild," to proclaim her coming by whistling "Possum up a gum-tree RacCoon in a hollow." I But it was a melodious whistle, and deftly executed; the   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. ,      33 original mnelody being artistically varied by fantastic trills and cadenzas; and it was a good-humored face which was illunlined by the candle borne in the intruder's hand. "Beg pardon, Mars' Robert! Come for Marster heavy 'boots! Heo want 'em, byme by!" He was a negro lad of fourteen or thereabouts--boot- black, errand-boy, and assistant waiter; a knowing, saucy imp, who stood in awe of but two living creatures, his mas- ter and his father. "Dey ain't in here, arter all!" he ejaculated, inwell-feign- ed surprise, having made an exploration of all unlikely and impossible hiding-places for the required articles, such as the sideboard, knife-box, and plate-warmer. "Dat's too bad!" "I saw a pair in the hall when I camethrough just now," said Robert, whose instinct it was to help every one, no matter how lowly his station, out of trouble, whatever might be its nature. "Thank you, sur! I'm obleeged to you!" Ie halted, in backing towards the doer, as if just struck by an idea. "If you please, Mars' Robert, would you mind asking Miss Helen if she will have a fire -made up in de office? It's  cold for her to be a-settin' thar to-night--and damp besides. To be sure, the chimbly has what you may call a 'different deliverer, and does smoke pretty bad for a while arter the fire is kindled-but, ef she likes to set thar, she ought to have one, and I'm 'tirely at hur survice-ef you'd be so kin as to say so to. hur, sur l" "I will! Here, Gabriel!" He tossed the boy a coin, which was caught dexterously and, without advancing to hear the profusion of thanks that  ensued upon the receipt of the gift, Robert entered the long, dark hall by which Gabriel had come to the dining-room. This led to a wing of the building which was mostly taken. i   I  t   up by store-rooms and closets, and at the farther end by What was termed " the office." Not that any of the Floyds had ever professed to practise law or medicine, unless it had been some obscure younger son, whose very name had passed away from-family traditions. No one now upon tle earth knew from What usage or circumstance the apartnlent had derived its name-only, it had always been called " the ofice" within tile memory of this generation, and innova- tions upon former customs were not popular in the con. nection. . There were scores of ancient volumes, with yellow pages and worm-eaten bindings, packed into two book-cases on different sides of the room; in one corner was an anti quated spinet, its keys dumb or discordant, its gayly orna- mented- top cracked and defaced; in another a dusty spin. ning-wheel, minus a leg leaned against the wall. There were chairs in various stages of dilapidation-legless, back- less, and bottomless; and a  spindle-shanked, rickety table or two; a general flavor of mustiness and cobwebs, the chil- liness of a vault and the choking dryness of a disused garret pervading all.  Any thing more ill-suited to be the bower selected by beauty for lovers' tryst could hardly be imagined, yet Robert Lay saw and thought of nothing except the figure that start- ed back from thq moonlighted window, as he unclosed  the- creaking door. He spoke promptly, to reassure'her. "Nelly ! Darling ! - why are you here all alone ?" No  answer; but there was light enough for him to per., ceive her further recoil into the darkness behind her; to note the drooping head and arms crossed upon her breast. "Are you unhappy ? Is there any thing which I can do for you ?, O; had you rather I  should not interrupt you at present?" he pursued, not offering  wo advance from  his position at the entrance. "No! no "' she laughed, and came forward to meet him   "This is my old Cave of M[elancholy-the grotto of Tropho- nius; my chosen resort in my earlier and more haughty days.- Oh! the tears that have watered these dusty boards! the bursts of angry and pathetic declamation to which these stained walls have lent patient ears! -But you see I ean laugh-now in'reviewing those-my callow days!" Robert was not deceived by this show of high spirits. He had taken her hand and drawn her to the window, while she was speaking. Herlcheeks were flushed, her hand hot in his. "And -the naughty world has dared to use you ill again, has it, although you are now a full-fledged bird?" "Did I say so?" she asked, in quick evasion. "I infer as much, from finding you in the depths of your sorrowful grotto." "Oh! my visit to-night was a whim. Not that I have not had a touch of the blues all day-" . "I have observed t]iis evening, that you were hardly in your usual spirits-a trifle below concert pitch, I should say. Will you not let me share your trouble or annoyance? relieve it, if I can?" Ie ventured to steal his arm around her! the love and sympathy depicted in his countenance were plainly to be read by the brightness of the moonbeams, pouring over them at that instant. She did not repel him, albeit she was generally shy of caresses from her betrothed. She even looked up, as his soothing lovefull accents saluted her ears; then, meeting that eloquent gaze, burst into a stormy flood of tears, and buried her face in her hands. "Robert! Robert! if I could only tell you all " "Perhaps that 'all' is not so profound a secret to me as you imagine, dearest!" He, clasped her more firmly, as she would have started from his side. .    Vl-tL'.PlD J-bVI U D WARjLDS, "Love's eyes are very keen, and mine have discerned much :that you!, from an overstrained, unreasonable sense of honor, would have concealed." Hier sobbing had ceased, but her head was bowed more' lowly still, and she trembled violently. *" In this respect, and in this alone, I have been disposed to accuse you of injustice to me, Nelly. When I gave you my love, or, to speak more accurately, when you accepted it-- for I cannot remember the times when my heart was not yours!--when you accepted my love, I gave you my whole confidence, and entreated that you should be equally unre- served with me. While I cannot fail to admire and appre- ciate the delicacy that has restrained you upon this point, for it is both a difficult and a delicate matter to bring a charge of unworthiness against one who is so nearly re- lated--" She threw ot his arm; raised a pale, haughty face, whose flashing eyes fairly appalled him. "You are laboring under a strange misapprehension, Mr. Lay!   I have no accusation of any kind, certainly none of unworthiness, to bring against the person of whom you speak.  Your information is utterly incorrect, or your im- agination has wandered wildly, if you believe the contrary." "Nelly!" articulated the astonished lover, ' listen to me! [t-is. not my imagination that wanders now. Surely, the bond which unites you to him who hopes, in less than two nonths, to call you his wife, is as strong as that binding you o Colonel Floyd-your guardian, indeed, but merely your mcle-in-law!

Again let me entreat your pardon, if I have offended or grieved you by this my first allusion to a subject concerning which you have heretofore avoided speak- ing. But, my pet-does it not seem preposterous in us, situated as we are, to cherish these foolish, petty re- serves?" "It is I *ho should sue for your forgiveness. I was petulant, unjust! I did not understand you! Will you pardon me?" His answer was a fervent kiss upon the hand she ex- tended. "It is as you have said!" she continued,lin the same al- tered tone-gentle-pleading--almost humble. "This has never been a happy home to me. I will be as frank as you can desire upon this theme; will discard the reserve you deem foolish and childish. My aunt is kind and means well. She could not treat any thing unkindly, :you know; but' al- though my father was her brother, she loves Lily far better than ahe does her niece by blood. I try to please and to be dutiful to her; I am sincerely grateful for all she has done for me; but she and Lily assimilate more nearly to one another than she and I ever can. . "i "I understand," Robert smiled, a little queerly--a gleam that was not complimentary to Mrs. Floyd's favorite. "'I do not murmur at this," added Helen. "I have never experienced a moment's jealousy of Lily.+ She is lovely and engaging, and was born to win affection. She used to call me her sister, and seemed to,esteem me as such;; yet she has changed greatly within the past six months. She does not mean to be unjust; still, she treats me coldly, and will   38       COLOSTEL FLOYD7S WARDS. assign no reason for the revolution in her feelings or man ner. Colonel Floyd, my uncle, never professed any re. gard for me; in fact, I have seen, ifrom the time I came to live here, that he disliked me. He is more irritable now than ever before-sometimes says things that are very hard to bear. Oh, Robert! but for you I should be driven to the belief that I have not the power of retaining the love of any one! The scanty share of this, Life's best gift, which Providence ever bestowed upon me, seems all to have slipped  away. Nobody cares for me now-nobody!" She wrung her hands and moaned much. It was a moment of the most exquisite pain the listener ever endured. Blest-rich beyond all possibility of spirit- need-in the consciousness of possessing her affection, he could not comprehend -this agony of poverty of which she complained. He would fain have hoped to fill her heart, if not so full as she had his, yet, so well as to leave her no cause for such repiriins.. Repressing the expostulation he felt would be selfish and cruel, he told her anew, in words whose fervor was not diminished by the sadness in which they were utterdk of his devotion, single and entire; his trust that coming years had in reserve for her, sunshine that should beguile her into forgetfulness of the gloomy Pa$t. She heard him with calming pulses and more composed mien. Presently, the bowed face was uplifted, and her eyes sought his again--a look that was reverence, admiration-- was it love? So it seemed to his sanguine apprehension, as he laid the unresisting head upon his breast, and bent to the still quivering lips. "My own Nelly! -my precious Love! my Wife!" A cloud, crossing the moon's disc, wrapped every thing in obscurity for some moments, The room was upon the ground floor, the window-sill low, and, as the moonlighrl broke forth again and suddenly, there fell upon, or between '     COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.. 3 the lovers, the shadow of a man-a long, dark figure, witl a gun in its hand. Helen started, with a terrified ejaculation. "Hush!" whispered Robert, smiling. "You know wh, it is?" "Yes-but it was so unexpected! so like an evil thing! Come back here, where he cannot see you! He may look in." "What if he does?" returned the young gentleman, bravely. "I hope he will be edified by the spectacle!" But he retired ihto :the shade of the interior of the apart. ment at her reiterated entreaty. Tile master of the mansion, for he was the startling ap- parition, remained motionless and sentry-like, his back to- wards the window, for perhaps three minutes, when his shadow was joined by another, shorter, stouter, and less erect. This belonged to his only confidential servant, thq head man in the field; and sub-manager of the estate-a negro named Booker, who was sire to the redoubtable Ga- briel, and' to the rest- of the slaves not only a taskmaster, exacting and pitiless, but a veritable tyrant, a meet tool in the hands of his unscrupulous owner. He, too, had his weapon, a thick cowhide, and, after a brief conference, the pair moved on. "Do you patrol your plantation in person?" questioned Helen, abruptly. "Neither in person, nor by proxy! -On the contrary, 1 have never permitted any patrolling gang to enter or search my servants: quarters, except upon very rare occasions, when they had a warrant to examine my premises, together with those of others in the neighborhood, for stolen prop erty." "I am very glad! I cannot describe to you the sensa- tions of disgust and dread which I experience, whenever l   COLONEL FLOYD'S .WARDS. happen to espy those two upon their nightly round. They go at irregular hours, sometimes as early as nine o'clock, at others not until midnight, that they may take trespassers by surprise. Every person is expected to be in his cabin by ten, and if a visitor be discovered, he is peremptorily order- ed off if he has a pass-punished if he has not. You must have heard that Colonel Floyd shot a poor fellow, one of the Reverdy servants, last year?" "I did! But he caught him thieving, did he not? That is the popular version of the transaction." "That was the story set in circulation to palliate the act, for Mr. Reverdy is not a man to submit to wanton injury, as Colonel Floyd well knows. But the-facts of the case are just these:-The negro who was shot, a very decent, well- behaved young fellow, was in love with Sally, my maid. For some reason, best known to himself, Colonel Floyd con- ceived a dislike for him, and forbade his coming upon the plantation, with his master's permission or without.' I was aware that they still met clandestinely, in spite of this pro- hibition, and several times warned Sally of the danger they incurred by so doing. One night they were straying along the edge of the melon-patch, when Colonel Floyd hailed them by name, and demanded what they were doing there. The girl ran one way, the man another. Unfortunately, he went directly'across the field of melons. When midway, he was fired at and severely wounded. Appearances sup- ported the statement of his pursuers--Booker was in attend- ance upon his master-that he was in the act of purloining the melons, and ' on the side of his oppressor there was power.' Poor Sally! it nearly killed her! She is a good girl, and sincerely attached to Thomas, her admirer." "We will make up the match again, and give them a grand wedding at Greenfield, when Christmas is over," was the reply. "Would you be very seiiously afflicted if some   COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS.      41   evil-minded or careless hunter were to shoot me in like manner, wing me, as a certain fair damsel of my acquaint- ance once served poor Aleck?" "Don't, please " she begged, in a tone whose distress touched, while it flattered him. "I am a selfish dog! inconsiderate and unkind, to permit you to stay in this cold vault of a place so long!" he said, anxiously. "Your hands are like two icicles, and you are' positively shivering! There is a fire in the dining-room, and I want to read you Aleck's last letter. Won't he be over- whelmed by the pleasant surprise we have in store for himr "Do you mean that you have never told him-" "That we were engaged? Never! It was hard work to keep the delightful secret, but I could not do the subject justice upon paper, and then again I owed him a Roland for the Oliver he gave me, in writing the pretty tale of his Ger- man betrothal to Aunt Ruth. and never whispering it to me! He ought to be ghot for the trick-the dear old fellow r" It was at this moment the shower of paper fragments was given to the bitter wind. The brothers each took his last look at the stormy moonlight at the same time.   la      VU JUV N.CJJi JJXU V J . 0z w ..XJ, C IIAPTER   IIII. H-,r TEN GARDNER sat sewing with her maid, in her chamber upon the following day, when Virginia Shore and Lily burst in upon her quiet. They had just returned from a shopping expedition to the neighboring hamlet, dignified by the name of a village. "Guess who has come at last!" "Whom do you think we met at the Post Office!" they cried in concert.                ; "The queen of England, or a peer of the realm at the very least, if one may judge from the state into which the encounter has thrown you both!" responded Helen, with pro- voking coolness.  "Pshaw! nonsense! makea real guess!" insisted Virginia. "The Great Mogul, or the Emperor of Timbuctoo-pos- sibly, the Lord High Chamberlain of her majesty, the Em; press of Borrio-boola-Gha!" was Helen's next attempt. "Sally! take these young ladies' bonnets and shawls, and set chairs for them!"           She went on with her needlework, which was a portion of her trousseau. "A more interesting personage than any you have yet named!"Lily walked up to her cousin, and slipped her . little hand under her chin, that she might better study her expression as the news was communicated: "Alexander the Great!  "Cerfainly the most distinguished lay-man of this re. glon!"Virginia supplied an additional hint. If there were suspicious scrutiny in the gaze which Lily   COLONEL FLOYDS WARBDS.        43 would have had convey only the impression of arch mirthful- ness, its end was foiled for that time. Helen calmly released her face from the hold of the pretty hand. "Indeed! he has arrived unexpectedly! His friends did not look for him until next week, at the earliest. Hhope he is in good plight." ' Superb! magnificent! irresistible!" rejoined Virginia, clasping her fingers and rolling up her eyes in tragi-comic earnestness. "Oh, my poor stricken heart'    . "Let Sally unhook your dress, so that the afflicted orgau can thump more freely!" recommended Helen. "Or, if the palpitation is 'ery alarming, try a little hartshorn and lavender!" "Is that what you take when you are thus affected?" ques- tioned the young lady, plaintively. "Always!" Helen answered, gravely. "Then, Sally! if hartshorn be the cure of love, bring it on!" She actually made the amused handmaiden pour out. a few drops of the sedative mixture into a glass, and dilute the potion with water; then drank it off, and executed a grimace. "Faughh! what stuff! the remedy is worse than the disease!" Lily looked supremely disdainful of all this nonsense. "H-ow can .you aot, so ridiculously, Virginia? And you have not once thought to deliver your Irresistible's message to Helen!" The needlewoman's complexion did vary slightly at this, and the swift motion of her hand was less even. "Message! he sent none by me! It was Mr; Robert Lay, who said that they intended riding over this afternoon." "I beg your pardon!" said Lily, positively,(' but my ears are ur fortunately quick, and assuredly heard him begin a sen- tence to you, sotto voce, with, 'And my quondam playfellow, Helen' -I was too honorable to listen any longer."   "      COLONEL FLOYD's8 wADS. "Indeed, my dear child, your ears deceived you for once. I have no recollection of any such language, or if it was used, I said that myself!" denied the rattle. "I was talking about Helen, part of the time, but there was only a single sentence poken on the subject, I am sure.:' "That was what youttwo were whispering about, at the carriage-door, was it?" "I shall not tell you!" Virginia's color arose suspiciously, although she still laughed. Helen set her teeth and held her peace, while Lily sneered significantly. "Oh, well! it is none of my business! r introduced the matter because I supposedthat Helen would be glad to get the affectionate greeting which I supposed was committed to your trust by her brother-in-law, that is to be. Nelly, dear! we, Virginia and I, have been talking heresy on our way home. We have decided that you did not display your best taste in your, selection. The elder and dark-haired brother is unquestionably the handsomer man of the two." "Tastes differ!" replied Helen. "Yours and, mine often do, Lily!" There was nothing on the surface of this speech to call forth the gasp and wince of surprise or pain with which Lily drew in her breath, yet Helen remarked these, and also the sudden quietness- of manner with which she next spoke. -"I am very negligent:! I must go and see if I can give mamma" (so she always called Mrs. Floyd), " any assistance in her preparations for dinner. I am growing heartily tired of dining-days!"  Helen sewed on in silence when she had gone, and her sedate, almost stern composure was an uncomfortable damper upon Virginia's merry- mood. "Do give me some sewing, Nelly! something that ,will jeep these idle hands out of tie mischief which some /              -    COLONEL FLOYDS 'WARDS  .     45 body, who must not be mentioned, always finds for such to do!"     . "I have nothing ready besides what we are doing, thank you!" ( Your dresses are to be made in Baltimore, are they not :" "Yes." "That is the only decent and comfortable way of getting up a trousseau-to commit it to the profession." "It is the least troublesome." A protracted silence, ended by a desperate effort at re- newed liveliness on the part of the chatter-box, "Dear me! I don't wonder you grow sober and thought- ful and matronly before your time,. sitting hereS, stitch- ingr eternally upon your wedding-clothes! The very sight of mine would frighten me out of courage and wits to- gether! If I am ever married, it must be upon half an hour's engagement.

It must be nice to be adored, though! I wish somebody- would help me to a personal experience upon the subject!" "If it were only a 'notion,' I have no doubt that I should, now and then, waver in my intention,"--said Helen; "probably reverse it completely."  "You mean, then, that it was something more substantial than a fancy for his sweet smile, his beautiful eyes and matchless whiskers, that induced you to say yes' when he popped the question?"      -  "I do!" b  ,.,                    "      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. Helen sustained the saucy examination unflinchingly. "And you really-excuse my imiertinence! but I am an humble, sincere, and earnest inquirel after truth, particularly since I have seen the resplendent Alexander--and you really and truly love this man, whom you are to take by the hand, with all your heart, soul, and strength, and are resolved, henceforward, forsaking all others, to cleave to him and him alone; to love, honor, and obey, so long as you both shall live?" ' When the proper time for putting that question arrives, I shall be prepared with an answer." Another freezing silence. "Have I offended you? It is only poor, foolish, rattle- pated Ginnie, remember," pleaded the visitor at length. "I am going off to dress for dinner now. I have a new dress which is perfectly heavenly! The effect upon Aleck's heart must be great, but I shall not enjoy it one whit unless you assure me that you are not angry with me."  "Have I ever been- out of temper with you?"Helen's iciness thawed as she saw the half-roguish, half-penitent face. ' I know what valuation to'put on your words, Gin. nie. You would never give your worst enemy a sly thrust in the dark, or stab one to the heart under pretence of a friendly jest!" ,Of course I wouldn't be guilty of any such shocking things!

I will wait until you exchange it for Helen Lay. My I isn't that beautiful-? Kiss me, and I am gone!" Helen locked the door after her. "I could not have borne it two minutes longer!

It was like him! - His behavior has the merit of consistency, to say no more!" A  She took a note from her work-box. Robert had sent it to her that morning, and thereby prepared her to expect the tidings brought by the girls. MY DEAREST HT1Tr F,: "Picture, as your affectionate heart will teach you to do, my surprise and happiness at finding Aleck here when I returned home! I think I have never been happier (excepting once) in all my life than I am at this moment, as I scribble this,-and the blessed old fellow sits, smilingly, watching my nervous, wayward fingers- unmanageable through very joy. He is well, and better- looking than ever; true as steel, good-as gold!.the same noble, generous soul whom we parted with, so sadly when our trio was broken two years ago.

She went over it twice; she had read it many times be fore, the proud lines of her features hardening at each w jrd; refolded it, and deliberately thrust it into the fire. ohen she unlocked the, door, rang up her maid, and beg n a studied toilette for dinner. There was other company expected to partake of hat repast. The Floyds kept an open house from one ye r'a end to the other, and these impromptu dinner-parties w re, at the lowest computation, of semi-weekly occurrence. )(ne or two families from the neighborhood were bidden on his occasion, as the nominal nucleus of the social gathering; alid to this Lily and Virginia had, in the course of their Mriorning's drive, added several other cavaliers besides the b'rothers Lay. When Aleck and Robert presented them- selves in the parlor, their ears were saluted by the hum of many voices, and they beheld divers- knots of talkers scat- tered about the room. lMrs. Floyd entertained four or five matrons; seated upon a sofa and in rocking-chairs in one corder; the colonel had his: cluster of politicians and fox- hunters upon the'hearth, at the far end of the apartment; Virginia Shore was " carrying on" in her most extravagant style, standing in the middle of the floor, surrounded by a bevy .-of beaux; and Liy Calyert-more ethereal than was common, even with her, in her blue silk robe, her sloping shoulders veiled thinly-by a tulle cape-had her coterie, at a little distance from her vivacious'friend. Upon none of these personages, individually or collect- ively, did the'eyes of the fresh arrivals rest for more than a second. Robert was quick to observe that Helen stood by the western window, chatting with Tom Shore, and that she was very beautiful, as seen in the rich glow of the sun. shine, streaming through the crimson curtain; and having made his bow to hostess and host, waited impatiently for 1 the subsidence of the buzz of welcome and congratulation   COLONEL FIOYD'S WARDS.      " . 49 that swelled towards and around Aleck. -The travellerf re- ceived his old friends with great apparent heartiness and a subdued show of joviality; had a cheery word and a hand- grip for the gentlemen, and a pretty speech for each lady, young and old. Virginia' Shore began to think, as she marked his progress from one to another of the fair ones, who vied with their fathers and brothers in the warmth of their greetings, that she had acted very foolishy-verdantly, she expressed it to herself-in hoarding up, as something too beautiful and precious to be told to Lily and Helen, the sugared nothings -he had breathed into her willing ear at the carriage-door, that forenoon. All this time Robert did not approach his betrothed; made his smile and bow from afar off, the testimonials that he acknowledged and rejoiced in her presence. He wished to present his brother with himself -before her. Nor did she stir from her position, or manifest the slightest agitation at their entrance. She looked at Aleck, as politeness ad- vised and curiosity seemed to' dictate, when Tom Shore re- marked aside upon his tanned cheek and hirsute ornaments-; assented naturally, yet nonchalantly, to that yputh's refined asseveration, that "Lay was a blamed handsome fellow, in spite of his dark skin and Turkish-beard." This was gener- ous, for Tom thought himself an Adonis, and his skin was like milk and roses, his hair fair and curly, his " love of a mouth" tinct as with carmine; his cleft chin innocent of whis- kers, or, sooth to say, any promise of the same. At last, pa- tient waiting had its reward in Robert's bearing off the prize, and the two neared Miss Gardner. She advanced a step-a queen could not have done less-and held out a hand that was neither chill nor tremulous, to salute the wanderer.  "We are glad to see you at home again, Mr.-Lay! You have taken all your friends by surprise. Had you a pleasant voyage?"   50       COLONEL'FLOYD S WARDS. And yet she was standing, her hand in his, upon the spot where she had heard his hasty, passionate farewell; where he had pressed the pledge-ring upon her finger! Involunta- rily he, glanced down. It was not there! In place of the plain gold eirclet there sparkled a diamond hoop--his broth- er's gift. -What else could he have expected? If she no- ticed the look-:.quick as a flash of light-no one else did, nor did other ears detect the faintest shade of sarcasm in his rejoinder. "Very pleasant, thank you, swift and smooth-as time seems to have flowed for the old acquaintances I meet here to-day. I cannot realize that twice twelve months have passed since I left the homestead and my, boyhood's comrn panions-since the evening of our parting, Miss Helen! By the way, it took place in this identical -room, did it not?" "I believe it did!" as calmly courteous as himself. "Here you shed the parting tear, I  To cross the ocean foam," said Tom Shore, who, like his sister, was addicted to quo- tation from latter-day poets, or, more correctly speaking, rhymesters and song-writers. "Exactly-with the trifling difference that ours was dry- eyed mourning," answered Aleck. "You cannot take exception to the concluding lines of the' verse," said Helen. '  '    " 'Now, I'm once again with those Who gladly greet me home.' Your 'Home again' is too obviously an occasion of unfeigned and general rejoicing for you to question its heartiness." "Thank you!"  He bowed profoundly. "I do you the justice to believe you sincere at all times, and in all that you do!" At this juncture, Tom Shore--albeit his constitutional iul   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.   .l firmity was not an overplus of modesty-was seized by the impression that the part allotted-to him by existing circum- stances, in this particular locality, was that' of second fiddle, and walked off in quest of less distinguished company. Simultaneously with his withdrawal, Robert obeyed the imperious beck of Lily Calvert's fairy forefingeri and, to Helen's consternation and Aleck's chagrin, they found them- selves the only occupants of the window recess. Consternation nor chagrin outlived the shock of the discovery of their situation. Both would. have done all in their power, consistent with outward propriety, to avoid the ttte-4-tte; but, now that it was forced upon them, each experienced an interest in its progress and results, pain- ful, yet not devoid of a certain strange sweetness. They talked of common-place topics; of neighborhood ehunmres and  foreign travel. The most jealous lover might have heard every word, noted and weighed the import of every intona- tion and glance, and felt no misgivings as to the. standing of the colloquists with regard to one another. The past-as theirs--was not ireferred to in the most remote manner, yet it was not practicable for Aleck to continue the cruelly sig- nificant badinage which was, to Robert and young Shore, but pleasant trifling between old friends. It seemed un- manly and irreverent-a thing of which he was'ashamed, as' he looked at, and listened to her; as if, while they talkd, the bier, holding the shrouded corpse of his boyish hope and manhood's aim, lay between them. Whether of riot the pride-and bitterness passed away, likewise, from Helen's spirit,. all trace of either disappeared Trom her demeanor. She ceased to question and reply with the elaborate show of strained civility that had hailed his approach, and characterized her conversation while others were by. It was no longer easy to meet his eyes with steady, haughty gaze; to fling back retort for innuendo0; to    - 2      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. repay counterfeit courtesy with lofty indifference. The truth was that neither had, in his or her anticipations of the in- terview, taken into account the subtile and sure effect of the personal presence; the wondrous magnetism of voice and look and action; the indescribable fascination lingering in each and all of these; ;'every one bringing up its swift train of memories, and each link in the chain reuniting, as by magic, with the rest, to draw their hearts once more together. The awakening, and anguish, and shame, and renewed resolves for future conduct with it, would come by-and-by; for the present, they saw nothing beyond the tumultuous joy of being again with one another, after the dreary blank of absence. When dinner was announced, I  Aleck offered his arm, which was silently accepted. Robert walked before them, in attendance upon Lily. Devoted in appearance to his. fair companion, he-- yet found a favorable opportunity for-throwing back a smile to his brothei and Helen. Its gleam of affectionate meaning, its guileless trust and hopefulness, were not lost upon them. When they took their seats in the dining-room, Helen's cheek had lost its blush, and her eye its softness, and beyond offering her the ordinary civilities of the occasion, Aleck paid her no atten. tion while they remained at the board. It was after sunset when the gentlemen rejoined the ladies in the drawing-room. Robert, having  seen that  1Heln was not there, bethought himself, as was his wont, of the least admired or least courted person ofn the- com. pany; and finding her in the shape of a shy school-girl, ensconced in the nook between the piano and wall, sat down in front of her, and tried to draw her-into conversa- tion. The barrier of bashfulness and nervous timidity was being rapidly undermined by his sedulous tact, when Gabriel wormed his way through the talkative groups, dispersed irregularly about the room, up to the two in the corner. ,   '    OOLONEL FLOYDS WAED,        53 "Was you de lady what asked for a glass of water, ma'am?" presenting a salver, with a goblet upon it. "No!" said the girl, in surprise. "Beg a thousand pardons, ma'am! sorry for de mistake, I'm sure, ma'am!" He bowed himself backwards-a bit of court etiquette, upon whose acquisition and practice he plumed himself mightily,'and steered off in another direction; but not before he had adroitly dropped into Robert Lay's hand a folded pa- per. Although the latter divined intuitively and through his recollection of precedents the authorship of the wee note;, hidden so soon as it fell in the hollow of his palm,-and burned with desire to learn its purport, he retained his posi- tion some minutes longer, until he could signal Tom Shore to -come and occupy it. T6m was dandified and conceited, but he was kind-hearted withal, and, to gratify Robert, would have undergone ordeals yet more trying, if that were possi- ble, than expending his time and fascinations upon a girl who was neither pretty, witty, nor rich, nor yet "know- ing" enough to appreciate him; " smacking," as he decided, "rather too much of school bread and butter." Robert read his precious billet by the hall window. It Was, as he had supposed, from Helen, and a simple request that he would meet her at " the spring," where she would wait half an hour for his coming. Hastily,-taking down hia overcoat and hat from the row of pegs in the' wainscot, he was in the act of putting them on, when he heard through - the dining-room door, which was ajar, Lily's voice, sharp with pettishness, yet silvery still. ( Where did you get the note I saw you- give Mr. Lay, just now?" "'Twouldn't be honorable in me -fur to tell what I1m ordered not to, Miss Lily!"- said Gabriel, respectfully but stoutly. YI4N   5:4      COLONEL FLODS WAIDS. "Don't answer me in that way, sir!"  It conflicted sorely with Robert's feelings and sense of justice to leave his Eboe ally exposed to the assaults of womanly pique and curiosity; and, not waiting to hear more of the dialogue, he stepped across the hall, making as much bustle as he conveniently could, and tapped at the door. "Miss Lily!" he called. "Come in!" said the clear tones, with a perceptible change of-key. - Gabriel took advantage of the diversion, and vanished, like a shadow, through another portal. Lily started at -sight of her guest's great-coat, and the hat in his hand. "You are not going yet, surely!      . -"O"ly for a walk with Helen." - -He smiled, and hesitated in .pronouncing the name. 'I wanted to ask you--our dear little sister-to contrive that our absence should' not provoke the criticism of gossiping tongues, if there are any such mstruments .of mischief among the good people in the other room. I will do the same for you some day, when you are situated as we now are!" She made no reply, except a nod of acquiescence-stood looking down into the fire with her great sorrowful eyes, so large and mournful-and there was such an air of deso- lation expressed in her fragile figure. and pale face, that RoberDt felt impelled to say some comforting or friendly word before leaving her there alone.. "I am afraid that we -your cousin and myself--may appear selfish to your apprehension sometimes, Lily; but it is only your imagination that leads you to believe, that there is any real diminution of our regard for you. You must not bear me a grudge because I am happy in the thought of taking her away from you. Our home will al ways be yours; for she loves you as fondly as ever; and, I . ,?   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.        55 for myself, I can truly say that you were never dearer to, me than you are now, while I have in view the blessed prospect of the closer tie soon to be formed between us." He spoke caressingly, for he had known Lily from her babyhood, and petted her to this day and hour, as did nearly everybody else.   - One of her hands-scarcely larger and quite as soft to the touch as a petal of her name-flower-lay passively within his fraternal grasp; his head was bent towards her in protecting tenderness, that looked lover-like, when the door at the si e of the fire-place was pushed back, andin walked Coloiel Floyd! In confusion or- alarm, his-niece snatched her hand away from Robert, with a faint Oh!" "I thought that you were both in the parlor," said the guardian, his dark features gathering additional grimness from his corrugated brow. Robert's pleasant tones answered the reproof he knew was aimed at Lily. - So we were, three minutes ago, sir! - I was on my way out to take an, after-dinner stroll-the 'constitutional' one is apt to need after Mrs. Floyd's dinners, Colonel! and hear- ing Miss Lily's voice, as I passed that door, I steppediin:to engage her kind offices in covering -or excusing my-tempo- rary absence."              - . . ' "The precaution was needless, Mr. Lay! It is my wish and request that my friends should be free to come and go at pleasure, in my house." "No one knows that better than I do, sir. Still, my withdrawal from society, such as is. collected in the parlor, -might subject me to -the charge of moroseness, or a want of gallantry. I shall not be gone long. The bracing air will soon clear my brain from the fumes of that last gleae of champagne."  '    ^  '  ' ^     -  '      .  "   56      COLONEL FLOYD'S WADS. ' He bowed, with his frank, boyish laugh, and went out. Lily also moved, as if to go to the parlor, but her uncle prevented her. "Lilyp! "Sir!" "Is this fine story true, or has that smooth-tongued beau- general been making love to you? One girl at a time is enough for most men." "Love to me, slr!"Her eyes glittered, as polished steel does in the sunlight. "Do you, then, think that I would submit to that insult? for insult it would be from an en- gaged man!"  "You -might do worse, girl! Why did you let him slip through your-net in the first instance? You angled tadiy." "I never had any hold upon him, sir. If I had-" Colonel Floyd's smile was one of sinister gratification, as he studied her face and translated the language of the ges- ture that finished the sentence. If you had, you are no true Floyd if you allowed him to 4 stray with impunity. If you possessed your mother's spirit you would not give him up alive. I have watched him and her, too, and I tell -you, on the authority of one who is sel- dom mistaken in his judgment of character and feelings, that he may still be yours, if you care to make the effort to lure him back."

She had little respect for her guardian, and few loved him except the wife he daily trampled in the dust; but Lily had confidence in his boasted acquaintance with men and the world's ways-his penetrative discrimi- nation of action and motive. He had evidently divined a secret she had imagined was buried from all mortal ken, in the depths of her own mourning heart. Might it not be that he was equally sagacious in readig; those of the be- trothed pair? She roamed up and down through the firelit room, her hands chafing one another, and the colorless cheeks whiter still than before-if that could be-under the strivings and insidious promptings of the passions he had so cunningly aroused. She spoke once, with- energy and fire that seemed to threaten the rending of the slight, shaking frame. It vas an appeal to Divinity-not the cry of a soul that felt the danger of the impending shipwreck among the billows of lawless affections-"Save! or I perish!" or the lowlier prayer of the tried, yet faithfiul heart, "Leave me not to temptation!" but a sudden, insane-sounding ejaculation .- i"Worth having!' Ohb, Heaven! do I not know that too well already!"   doU      'UV1JUVVfIY1Z IX LV LU 0fi W AIWUB, CHAPTER IV. "Tm: spring" was between three and four hundred-yards distant from the mansion-house, at the foot of the hill on which the building was situated; and beyond the arch of rude masonry covering the fountain arose another eminence, thickly wooded and cleft with ravines-the outskirts of the extensive forests attached to the plantation. The night was cold, but there was no wind stirring, and far up towards the zenith the moon rode in unclouded ma- jesty. The frosted earth and brittle grass crackled under Robert's tread as he sought the trysting-place. The walk was a familiar one, and a favorite with him; doubly dear since the scene of four months agone that had hallowed the rustic fount forever. With the gurgling flow of its waters had been blent the first vows of love he had breathed in the ear of her who -now sat awaiting him upon the gray stone that had been their resting-place then. She was not alone. Withdrawn tio a respectful distance behind her mistress- stood a woman, whom Robert recognized with a kindly "How do you do, Sally P" Helen rose immediately and took his proffered arm. Until he spoke she had remained quietly seated, her head resting upon her hand, apparently buried in absorbing thought. "Have I kept you waiting?" he asked. "I was afraid that I should.

You may have thought my message a singular one, but I wished to talk with you, and I knew that we 'could not procure the oppor- tunity for uninterrupted conversation anywhere within doors this -evening." - "Not in the 'grotto?' "-asked Robert, smiling. "Do not apologize, I entreat you! Your suggestion-it was too mod-  est td be called a request, much less an appointment--was highly proper, and eminently acceptable. The most starched prude in America could not condemn it, especially as Sally is-in attendance," casting a backward glance at the girl, who, with her shawl wrapped about her head--in -true Dinah fashion-had seated herself in the shadow of the stone arch.' Hclen tried to imitate his mirthful-tone.  "You surely know why I brought'her along!" "To keep away the bugaboos until I shoud make my appearance, I presume.'"            / "To prevent molestation from bugaboos, indeed-but not of the species which children dread. Time was when I was careless of forms and customs, for I had only myself to con- sider. Now, as my good aunt will certify, It am growing prudent, very like other people. You and-I need no one to play propriety, but since others would advise the attendance of a duenna-,a somniferous onfe is better than none--Ibowr to the decree. But not to postpone the discussion of the subject which I wished to broach to you, I have heard two pieces of news since dinner that have disquieted me.+ One was, that your aunt intends leaving your house and taking up her abode at Maple Hill. Is this true?" Robert fairly whistled with astonishment. She does contemplate such a change, but the matter is yet in abeyance; and inasmuch as the proposition originated with Aleck, the thought never entered her mind until last   vv        vaJIN JUU JLYD X WARDU. night. It baffles me to guess how the story could have reached you so soon. Why, the busiest tattler of whom we have any record-the renowned little bird of the air, could hardly have borne the tidings in this time!" "Mrs. Catlin mentioned it as a settlecr thng to another lady, and in my hearing. She had it directly from Miss Ruth, she stated, having stopped at Greenfield on her way to Belleview. But, Robert! please dissuade her from this step! It has been a serious and constant fear with me, that I may not contribute so much to your happiness as you an- ticipate, for I kniow my grievous shortcomings. Do not add to your disappointment the loss of your aunt-your second mother. Beg her from me to stay with you! You will miss her more than you dream of; you will need her gentle offices, her unfailing consideration for your feelings and com- fort, her steady affection! You cannot exist without these, Say to her that I am miserable in the thought of causing any change in her household; that I will never interfere with her plans; that matters shall be conducted according to her wishes, not mine; that I will endeavor to accommo- date myself to her just ideas in every thing; study to be dutiful--I cannot but be affectionate to her--if she will con- tinue to live with you." "My precious girl, what an impulsive creature you are! You plead like a frightened child, who fears to be left alone - with me! Am I such an ogre that Aunt Ruth must not abandon you to my tender mercies? Before we go any fur- ther, dear Helen," he continued, dropping his jesting tone, "I must say one thing. -Whether Aunt Ruth remains an inmate of my house or not, you, and not she, must be its mistress its irresponsible controller. She understands this. It is nobn-ovel idea -to her, and she has the good sense to admit the wisdom of the arrangement. If she goes to Maple Hill, it will not be to avoid the necessity of taking what would I'                 -   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.        61l be her properl place in my family, in the event of my mar- riage, but at Aleck's instance and earnest solicitation. He' will be very lonely there without her, he represents, and no man of my acquaintance is less fitted than he to be happy in a veritable bachelor establishment." Helen brought out her next sentence with an effort. "But, in time, he will have no need of her in the capacity of housekeeper or-companion, if what we have heard be true." "An important 'ifr Taking it for granted that he means to install his Fraulein as Mrs. Lay, in the course of a year or less, I question her ability to undertake the charge of an American mAnage. Ho has not showed any disposition to speak upon this point since his return, and I would not force his confidence. Aleck is a queer fellow in some respects. The very depth and miglit of his feelings seem to deprive him of the power to express them fluently. I can divine them; yet, loving one another as we do, there are many reserves on both sides. If he-marries a true, loving woman, who can enter into the peculiarities of his disposition, she may unseal the tide. I hope that his Gretchen, if she be indeed his, may bring him one-half the heart satisfaction, the fulness of joy, that my love has brought me." There was no "Amen" from the figure at his side. They were rambling along a narrow footpath, which-wound-about the slope of the wooded hill, and her regards were bent upon the ground. "You will speak to your aunt-tell her what my earnest desire and petition is, however-will you not?" she said, ab- ruptly recurring to the original topic. "Assuredly, if you still wish it!"  "I do!" They stopped under a large oak tree, whose far-reaching branches cast fantastic shadows upon the whitened turf of   62       COLONEL FLOYDrS WARDS. the hill-side. Helen withdrew her hand from Robert's hold anid, folding her arms, leaned against the giant trunk of the forest monarch, and appeared to be lost in the contemplation of the landscape.  I      I "Colonel Floyd has the finest site for a house' that can be found on this side of the Potomac," observed Robert. "It crowns that knoll grandly." "That reminds me Ithat I have another matter on my mind," replied Helen, arousing herself. "I was so fortu- nate or unfortunate, as the event will decide, as to overhear, awhile ago, a part of a conversation between two:ladies, that was not intended for the ears of any member of Colonel Floyd's fatily." "It was delicate and kind in them to introduce such mat- ters-while partaking of his hospitality!" was Robert's ironical interruption. "His extravagance and gaming propensities," said Helen, "were animadverted upon in one sentence, for I heard but twot. The other imparted the, to me, unpleasing intelli- gence that he was heavily in your debt, you having, it was- said, lent him money at several different times. I trust this is a mistake or a fabrication." Robert laughed. "The meddling gossip was partly correct, but I am sorry that you troubled yourself about her story. We should have no secrets from each other, and I do not see why those pertaining. to money matters should be an exception to this rule. I have let Colonel Floyd have a small sum now and theni but not enough to beggar me, should he never return any part ofthe amount." "It was very unwise in you," replied Helen, reprovingly. "You should have remembered what I epetation he bears among his creditors. They say that he never pays debts that honest men consider sacred and confidential, unless   COLONEL FLOYDOS WARDS.     ,  63 forced to it by the strong arm of the law. He is thoroughly conscious that you will never resort to this means of recov- ering what you have advanced. Now, answer me frankly; were his applications to you for assistance out of his difficul- ties made prior to our-our-to the formation of our present relations?" "What terrible 'relations' they must be, to require that tremendous amount of stammering and circumlocution! I have a wretched memory for dates!"' "I am answered  ! It is as I have suspected! He has taken a base and Inwarrantable, a most indelicate advantage of your attachment to his ward to extort mnoney from you  He is no stranger to your generous and pliant temper!

I was easy in purse, and felt it to be a privi- lege, not a hardship, to help a neighbor in his embarrass- ment." "I comprehend fully! My opinion is unchanged, Robert! I have a favor to ask of you in my turn. It is not fair that Colonel Floyd should enjoy a monopoly of this kind of- business." "Make it a hundred, and consider them all granted l" Helen was not to be beguiled out of her earnestness. ," Never lend Colonel Floyd another dollar! Learn to say ' I' !'" "I will-to everybody excepting a little lady of my acquaintance, who cannot ask an unreasonable thing " re- joined he, in playful, yet tender gallantry. She went on, gravely as before.  "Furthermore-and upon this I have a right to insist, 'since i;, more nearly concerns me-if he should propose a   . . WOLOUEL FLOYD'IS WAfRDS. marriage-contract .to you, refuse positively to accede to its provisions-reject them utterly!" "Why, my beauty! who has been vexing your brain with legal lore? Don't you know that every marriage is a con. tract-civil and religious?" "I know from your tone, and evasive, replies, that there has been intimations, if nothing more definite, made to you already, touching the expediency, the moral righteousness, of securing my property to myself. I know it as well as that upon my twenty-first birth-day, months ago, I was enti- tied to the entire control of all that I am worth; that Colonel, Floyd had no further authority over it or my actions; yet I have been repeatedly put off with surly promises of settle- ment at some future date, and am treated more like an im- becile minor than ever before,-know it as-perfectly as that I have rightly interpreted the drift of my aunt's frequent and prosy harangues to me, within a couple of months--ill-con. trived- expositions of -her husband's tenets, respecting the manifold benefits arising from contracts of marriage. How I despise the name and the idea!" "Windmills again?" interposed Robert's gentle raillery.  "Not so! I  can tell you the exact terms which Colonel Floyd has sketched to you-commended to your considera- tion, by appealing to your sense of honor and justice. Ahl that I have inherited froim my father is to be settled upon myself, and my late guardian, an incorruptible Spartan, who could not be betrayed into the least violation of my rights I is to be appointed my trustee." "You are a witch!" exclaimed the amazed listener. "I am a woman whose training has taught her vigilance and distrust! hard lessons-and hardly learned by one of my age and sex. If all men with whom I have had to deal were like you, I should not have mastered the alphabet as yet! I You may think me unfeminine, sordid, calculating, in   COLONEL PLO't S WAEDS.       65 thus obtruding pecuniary matters upon your consideration. I suppose that most women leave these arrangements to parents, guardians, and friends. I am an orphan; I have no near rela- tions; 'no friend, who can aid me, excepting yourself; I had- better never have had a guardian. You have invited and urged my confidence, and you see how eagerly I take you at your word!"She broke off her rapid, passionate speech to say, with an attempt at gayety, "Do you feel as poor Tarpeia did, when she asked for bracelets and got a shower of shields instead?" Robert was embarrassed. "Your confidence can never be burdensome!" he answered, sincerely. 'But, Nell, darling! there was nothing preposterous in Colonel Floyd's plan' of settlement. The most affectionate fathers propose the like, continually. I rather glory in the chance thus af- forded me of showing that my love for you is purely disin terested. You will not discredit my declaration, that, until your guardian made reference to your fortune, the thought of it had never crossed my brain in connection with my 4t- tachment to yourself. Whatever is yours, now, shall remauin your own. I cheerfully relinquish all claim that the law would give m' upon it, with one proviso-all that I possess must be added to it." "I believe in your sincerity, but not in the word of any X other man alive. I am gratefully alive to the generosity, which the world would 'deem unsafe and romantic. But, Robert! in this one thing you must let me have my own way. I have reasons, weighty and sufficient, for pressing my request. I will have no deeds, ho settlements! They will not be valid without my consent, and that shall never be given!" This was a, strange conversation for a moonlight tryst between lovers, and she was an uncommon type of a be- trothed maiden; her every resolute lineamentdiscernible by the white moonbeams; arms Sternly crossed, and feet planted hard against the gnarled roots of the oak, appar- ;   L-u AJLiL FJLOYD S WARDS. ently as impassive and immovable to expostulation as the tree itself. Some minutes of troubled reflection passed before either spoke again. Then Robert resumed the discourse. "I cannot disregard your wishes in this matter; Helen, however they may war with my inclination and judgment; for, as you say, you are the person who will be most nearly affected by the disposition of your property. I did tell your guardian that I acquiesced heartily in his views, and would shape my course accordingly, and he may misinter- pret my altered purpose,; but let that pass! So long as you and I are agreed, and understand one another, what matter the opinions of others?" "I thank you for the sacrifice you make to please me; for, paradoxical as it would be to many--to most vulgar miAids-the acceptance of wealth with your bride, in these circumstances, is a sacrifice, and no light one to you. I take it upon myself to guarantee that Colonel Floyd shall earnm to whose influence your change of intention is at. tributable--upon whom  he is to charge the frustration of his holy design. What is it, Sally?"  Engrossed in their talk, the young couple had not thought of the girl-had not seen that for some time past her mo-. tions had been indicative of extreme restlessness. - er crouching figure had become  erect; the shawl dropped from her ears to her shoulders; her head moved uneasily from side to side; as if she were watching or listening in- tently. When Helen addressed her, she had arisen from her seat by the spring, and approached within a few feet of her mistress and her lover. "I'mra thinking you'll be missed at the house, Miss Helen I I'm sure I've heard Gabriel calling me two or three times-- and-and-it's getting colder, 'seems to me." Helen eyed her more attentively.   COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS.        67 "-It is too bad to havd kept you sitting there all this while, my p:)or girl! We have been walking, and have not felt uncamfortable; but your teeth are absolutely chat-' tering!" "I reckon I must ha' been asleep!" rejoined Sally, with a foolish, ashamed laugh. "I didn't know we'd been out long." "I think it very likely!" said Helen, smiling, as did Rob- ert, in recollection of the " somniferous duenna." Run on, now, and get yourself in a glow. We will follow." As they were ascending the hill upon the other side of the spring-stream, she subjoined an explanation of the re- quest sho had urged with regard to her fortune. "I wras put upon my guard  against Colonel Floyd's probable machinations, by ag story told me by my cousin, Miss Rogers, when she paid us a visit in October. She was an intimate friend of Lily's mother, and having taken quite a fancy to my society, confided to me certain incidents of the family history, which I had never heard until -then. Among others, she mientioned that Colonel Floyd, as his father's executor and sister's guardian, had her share of the estate secured to herself prior to her marriage with Mr. Calvert, and, as seemed natural and proper to most people, assumed the trusteeship of the same. Either Mr. Calvert resented this as an imputation upon his honor, or an impli- cation of his inability to manage his wife's property, for, shortly after the wedding-day, a coolness grew ap between the brothers-in-law, which greatly distressed Mrs. Calvert. There were- serious threats made by 'her husband of a law- suit to recover that which, he alleged in Miss Rogers's hear- ing, had been dishonestly abstracted by Colonel Floyd fromn his sister's portion; proceedings which were suspended by' his own tragic death. It is always best to avoid litigation by having these questions settled beforehand."   O COLONEL FLOYI)S WAEDS. - "What a business head you havej!" replied Robert, much amused. "I had not supposed that you knew how many cents mafke a dollar. Very few of the Floyds are endowed with arithmetical talents. Your uncle, for example, is ut; terly ignorant of the value of; the prime idol of the Yankee . nation.":- "He understands the rule of subtraction, as your pockets can attest. You are mistaken as to his regard for -money. He is an odd compound of extravagance and covetousness." 'At the yard-gate she stopped. ",Do not judge me harshy for tonight's talk!"' she said, almost sadly-. . I suppose that I must appear to you wofully common-place and practical; censorious in judgment and rigorous in action,-for you are charitable and lenient to a proverb. But I have only your good at heart; desire to do that which will be -best for us- both. I do endeavor con- - scientioiisly to study your interests, Robert!" He made-some comforting response, and there the subject rested.. He: was not, however, so blindly in love, that the sub- stance no -less than the tone of this last sentence, did not fall gratingly upon his sensitive ear. It was, of course, pleasant, or :ouht to have been, to know that she looked upon their interests as identical; to see that her manner of speaking of these was characterized by. the clear-sighted zeal and pru- dence; of the wife, rather tha4 the bewitching hesitancy of the blushing bride. Yet, in his heart, he felt a lack -of spme- thing, a deficiency that was at once indefinable and painful. Her bearing was not-too free-that could never happen- still, a trifling diffidence, a dash of coyness would have im- -parted to it an additional charm. The fruit-ripe, rich, and 'round--was his, and. he was proud and thankful in its pos- session; but he Could hage wished that the downy veivet, shading and softening: its bloom, had not been so carefully   COLONEL FLOYD'S WABDS.        69 and thoroughly rubbed off before the treasure ,was given. He could not resist a ridiculous preference for the "Loves of the Angels," as a lover's text-book, above ledger or bank- account, let them be never so accurately balanced, and largely in his favor. Above all, that word, "conscientiously," offended his spiritual nervous organization. Regard unmeasured, be- cause immeasurable,-Soliotiude,-loving and anxious-eyed Aphrodite, born out of the waves of this:boundless love;- 'these would have been to him as the waters of the river of Life and the fruit that grows thereby. But he did not want to be loved " conscientiously." He did not care :to be inform- ed that there was, on her -side, a "conscientious endeavor" to think of and to do whatever would conduce to his happi- ness. lMoreover,-but this was a secondary and very inferior consideration,-he could not divest himself of a disagreeable expectation of an unpleasant, ifno6t a violent scene with Col- onel Floyd, when they came to the question of the final seVt tlement; feared lest the retraction of his partial pledge that -all should be done in consonance with the guardian's desire, would place him, the bridegroom, in a false and humilia- ting position.  Keeping these misgivings and his dissatisfaction to him- self, hp parted from Helen in the hall, with the fond; gentle smile she alone of all women ever had from him, and repair. ed to the drawing-room, whence had proceeded the sounds of music and laughter the outdoor prome. aders had heard- ere they reached the house. A lady, elderly, and who had never been pretty, a gover- ness in one of the aristocratic families there represented, was at the piano, playing a lively waltz; and six or eight couples were whirling-around the room, in the exultant swing of that entrancing dance. Making a wide circuit to avoid   '70      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. collisions, Robert succeeded in stationing himself by the side of the musician. - The piece she was playing was an unfa- nmiliar one to her, and, dexterous and true as were her fingers, she dared not remove her eyes from the sheet. There was no need for her to see his features to assure herself who turned the leaves with a volte subite movement, bespeaking an intelligent eye and a hand trained to the like gallant offices. She. knew who had won for himself the appellation- of "-the wall-flowers' friend," and shunned not to maintain his right to the title by rendering attentions as graceful and assiduous to the neglected children of beauty and fortune, as to the most pampered darlings of both. Poor Miss Carter's lank, starched figure and dyed silk dress covered a/heart slightly indurated and withered by twenty years' thankless drudgery in her present, profession; but there were hidden away there, in shady, jealously-screened recesses, kept green by the, dews and occasional freshets of sentiment and memo- ry, stray blossoms .and modest mosses of romance and, feeling,'whose existence would have been scoffed at by the patrons and acquaintances of the "old maid teacher." And never did these bits of verdure and bloom quiver with more vitality than beneath the sunshine ofRobert Lay's smile. She was not- in love with him; she never deluded erself with the chimera that a single thought of her visited him when she was out of his sight; but in her mental, or rather heart portrait-gallery--how  scantily furnished, it would have given you a heart-ache to see!-he was en. shrined-a stainless hero.. He offered her a glass of water when the tiresome round of variations was at an end, and advised that she should rest her strained fingers for a time. But no! the danbers were ready to begin again, and so must she be also, or give offence. Automatons and ill-paid governesses are not ex- pected to complain of fatigue in the service of their masters. , .    COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       71 "At least, play something that you know," said Robert. "That will be less exhausting to the head--only finger. work! You can talk then!" With himself, he meant, for every other available mascu line specimen of humanity had a partner.  He hardly merited all the credit for self-denial she inwardly heaped upon him, as his pleasant sayings enlivened the monotony of her occupation, for it cost him little trouble- to keep aloof from the dancers, so long as Helnu did not appear. He did not witness her entrance. The first intimation he had of her presence was the sight of her at Miss Carter's back, wheh this-set of waltzes was likewise- concluded. "You should not have been appointed to this work to- night, Miss rter!" she said. "You are not well enough. Does your head ache very badly now?" "Thank you! it is about the same." With a gesture and three words, Helen swept her from the piano-stool and established herself upon it; shook her head in smiling wilfulness in response to the grateful lady's remonstrances, and drowned their continuation in a pealing march, Robert conducted Miss Carterto an easy-chair; found a fan and a bottle of sal-volatile for her, and went back to the instrument. The pale, wearygoverness watched the pair with deep and affectionate interest. They were so young and noble ; so admirably adapted each to the other, in virtues, manner, and disposition, and their mutual attachment so beautiful to behold, it was not marvellous that the romance into which she wove their united lives had not, in its bright texture, one sable thread. If the sigh which heaved her bosom was an inaudible and hopeless lament over her barren life and departed youth, it was untainted by envy of their different and more blessed lot. Presently Helen glanced up at her betrothed, and said something, briefly and positively. Ho   72       COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS. made reply, seemingly, by an interrogation, and upon receipt of her answer turned away, and jined himself to the band of revellers. He went directly up to Lily Calvert, offered his hand, which was smilingly accepted, and they took their position in a cotillion that was just forming.  The music flowed out in a bolder, quicker measure, and lig'ht feet beat time over the floor. Still the silent, un- noticed governess kept watch upon the now lonely per- former-free now, moreover, to indulge at will in the en- chanting maiden visions that attend-brilliant-winged and willing sprites upon the meditations of the ,' young, loving, and beloved." Yet Miss -Carter saw the fine, mobile features subside into pensiveness; then, fixed sadness; the eye settle into melancholy steadiness-a sort of introverted look which told plainly enough that the source of her grief was not far away, nior beyond herself. While the spectator was taxing the me*agre stores of her experimental knowl- edge of Love's mysteries for a solution of this enigma, Aleck Lay drew near, deputed by his partner to convey some message to the dreaming pianist. A red tide rushed over Helen's face as he spoke to her; she started; lost time, skill, and tune, her hands crashing heavily down upon the keys; and a harsh, loud discord from the thrilling wires brought the dance to an untimely pause. "What is the matter?"  "Go on!" cried a chorus of - voice s. "It/was my fault!" -Aleck's sonorous tones quelled the Babel of inquiry. I interrupted her and did all the mis- chief. . I ask a million pardons!" he pursued laughingly, to the drooping and abashed musician, "It was thoughtless and awkward in me to accost you so abruptly, when I might have, seen that you were intent upon your music. It shall be a twholesome lesson to me for the future. I was about to ask you to play a little faster--a very little, if you please."   OLOISLoEL FLOT O'  W DS.3     73 An irrepressible impulse-of gratitude made heriift her eyes to his, and he saw that they -were full of tears., This might be the effect of nervous agitation merely, but the sight sent him back to his place with a madly'throbbing heart. Belen struggled valiantly with the rising softness, superindaeA by a passing vision of the olden days, when he interposed to ward off every annoyance from her; met, with scathing. re- tort, each sarcastic or unfriendly retort that had. her for its object. For the rest of the evening they kept far apart^-did not exchange another look-or word. "A Wholesome lesson for the future,! IThey would do well to remember and profit by the warning!  Helen refused to dance at all that Oight;-she "preferroed to play for the entertainment of the rest;" and when .she would not let him hover near her, Robert Lay's most fre- quent companion wSas Lily Calvert. She wast very pretty and charming; so winning in her childlike, confiding ways; so kind and amiable with him,-and apparently so gratified by his attentions, that he could not resist the temptation/ta sented by all these, and quite forgot his duty to the A ll flowers in waiting upon a belle.

Mrs. Floyd puri;sued a similar line of thought and action, as she overlooked seamstresses, laundresses, and chamber- maids; set aside a gobdlireserve of her finest sweatmeats, and-oldest pickles and liquors; bespoke eggs, far and near, to'be UD elivered a week before Christmas at Belleview; teste .thee golden rolls of butter packed away for the oc- casion-; inspected her poultry-yards, and, like the cele- brated William O'Trimmerty of the nursery rhyme, "Gathered her hens, And put them in peis," to be fattened against the great day. She had private per. sonal trials, in addition to household cares, and the two classes of perplexities thoroughly engrossed every faculty of a mind which was none too capacious at its best estate. Never, in the whole course-of her wedded life, had she beheld her lord in a worse humor than- now held complete possession of him. His household words were one perpet- ual growl-not loud, but deep; and their connubial confabu- lations, which always partook more of the nature of mono- logueS from him, than a reciprocation of ideas and feelings, Were unifornily sostormy now, that she trembled in heart anid body at the anticipation ot them. -When, with simple and /wifly guile, she tried to divert him from his sombre brooding over. his grievances, unknown as yet to her, by srgal domesticdetails, and deferentially. begged his opinion upion: ;tteome nUs topics of invitations, and the number- ed: e-tcetera ertaina gto the grand wedding,-for no Floyd s e    riei^-:withWoutt 6llarge and agnificent party,- he'14 r'6 t h;eigts ntflie guests, and the Bipper; as Gabriel   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.  reported in the kitchen, cussed, up-stairs and down, antd all 'round the lot " reserving his, choicest 'tprecat ions for the unconscious bridal pair, whom.;he:anathenatinA#j .as 'a -" brace of the most ungrateful and unmannerly i'avinsi the most barefaced cheats, that ever conspired to effect a man's, ruin!"

She was not, therefore, the person who could have been expected to discern other signs of the times--such as affected her ease and comfort less than the behavior of her husband and adopted daughters towards her personally. She-never be-  thought herself that Robert Lay's handsome, sunshiny face Was at time6 worn and haggard, and his manner oddly distradit that, while he never failed to follow Helen's every movement with his eyes, and sought out occasions-.of divining her wishes' and forestalling their expression by im- me iately gratifying them, he as frequently had long, con- fidential talks with Lily as with her, and treated the younger cousin- with a warmth of familiarity he had not manifested formerly. Nor did Helen's quicker vision appear to discover this ehange in her lovers bearing, or imagine that there was peril in his increasing intimacy with Lily. Whether she had other food for thought, so much more important in her esti- mation.0pr was incapacitated from feeling jealousy, through perfection of confidence, or, what was surely very unlikely, a calm idifference, was not to be learned from her demeanor. Certain it was that she pursued the avocations so replete with stirring interest to most -women with a mechanical fidllty, a diligent drudgery, that looked more like a consci- enti6us perfornmance of allotted duty than desire; more like an abstraction of ideas and absence of feeling than loving zeal., Occasionally she aroused her torpid conscience to the examiniation of the contrariety of, emotions that alternately depressed ad gitated her, questioned herself sharply, and censuredunsIpariagly. It might be an indication of a noble trust in Robert's truth and affection that she did nit object   COLONEL FLOYDIS WARDS.       83 to see him sit, for an hour at a time, beside Lily's piano, or promenade with her on the lawn for the same period, both talking earnestly and continuously, as friends whose interest in one absorbing theme is a bond of union between their hearts. But did she sin-when she wondered wifat was the source of the relief she experienced in the discovery that, while his kindness to herself remained unabated, he was yet less demonstrative; made fewer demands upon her time and love than of yore; let her alone when she was inclined to in- dulge in pensive revery, instead of trying by cheerful arts I and tenderwiles to dispelthe cloud? She hadoutlived her age of romance, she was in the habit of saying, and perhaps it was better that he should also learn to look at Life's pro- saic side ;-to view feelings, as well as facts, as they were, without the dangerous and deceptive glamour cast about them by a loving idolatry.. They would be happier for the disillusion when their lots were united.. She did not- palliate the folly and, crime of the unutterable sadness that would, combat it as she might, steal over her in the contemplation of this prospect. Was she not going,' of her free will, to' marry a man -who had loved her from her childhood in spite of 4her faults, her many frailties and foibles of disposition arid errors of conduct . who -loved her purely and wholly, as few other women were ever esteemed? Was he not the non-such of his sex, in his spotless life, his engaging deportment, perfect temper, and singleness of pur- pose? She was a fortunate, a happy woman and, if -un- grateful as fortunate,- unreasonable as happy, she might blame herself and no one else. What if she had, in child- ish folly, once hearkened and thrilled to another's vows, as she --had never done to Robert's manly fervor of protesta- tion-? What if, for many months, she had nursed a beau. tiful shadow of bliss, in the belief that this other washers -hers only and forever-as she was keeping herself .for o   VAt;     'ww^^rY NEL FLOYD S WARDS. h -im?P- That was a weary, weary time ago! It seemed as if years of wretchedness had gone over her head since the ssummer evening--but one month prior to her betrothal- when Ashe had :heaved, torn with desperate strength, the great stone-by the spring away from its bed, and buried in the moist black mould the ring she had worn, in credulous - faith, .for a year anda: - half-worn hopefully, joyously, proudly! then rolled back the rock to its place-a tomb that hida gravel   . These trifles belonged to the girl's history; as a girl she had judged falsely-of their nature, and consequently over- rated their value. She had grown into a woman now, ra- tional, strong, resolute! Was she resentful and despairing as well? It might be, for she had no memory of a mother's gentle rectitude of conscience and action; a father's wise coun- sels. A wild, undisciplined childhood had not laid the kind of foundation from which would: spring, in spontaneous growth, moderation of judgment and dispassionate conduct at the age of maturity. She knew her temperament, and what were her besetting sins; and she firmly believed that Robert Lay, of all others, was best acquainted with these, and that- his influence would exert the most salutary effect in restraining whatever was objectionable and fostering/the few germs of good. He had said that she only had the power of making him happy; that Life would be bare and joyless if he were deprived of the hope of winning her; and with tender sympathy, born more of her own intense suffer- ingi her -aching; bleeding heart, than out of the sisterly re- gard she had ever felt for him, she listened, and promised to be, his wife.

COLONEL FLOYD'B' WARDS.   . *85 I heard once of a simple, true-hearted girl, a novice:in the world and its ways, who was cruelly deserted bythe m-an she had loved and trusted for years. -She "bore it wonder- fully," said curious lookers-on. 1 Some went so far as to ex- press a doubt whether her attachment :had ever been so strong- as was generally supposed. 'Cheerfully-and quietly -none guessed how heroically-she went through her round of duties; neither in her home, nor in society, ever yielding, for an instant, to visible depression- of spirits. Two :or three years had elapsed since the event that had chanTgthe- whole tenor of her inner life; the recreant lover had: ed ed- another, and it was considered that she had, In -ommon phrase, " quite gotten over her trouble," when she *was ad- dressed by another suitor, a noble fellow, who could appre- ciate aright her rare excellence, and was, imi himself, enitrely worthy of her love and respect. She was greatly moved as the tale proceeded, and, when he paused for her answer,hid her face and wept abundantly. Encouraged- bythis evi- dence of softness, the wooer pressed his stitu yet more warmly.    '  "Please do not," she sobbed, putting both her ha'nds into his, and looking up at him with an expression of grieving pity. "Do not go on, or I shall promise thatwiii6h will render us both- miserable for life. I know Iow lia6 d it is to endure the pain of wounded affection. Do not mikie me too sorry for you - Had the nature of Helen's former relations t0o Ale Lay been sugch as could be avowed, and Robert-n0t is brother, she would have made a like answer to his confesslion of love. It wanted just three weeks to the wedding-night, arid the brothers had accompanied the Floyds home frommmorning service in the church, to partake of their sunday dinner.

Iily had a meaning %accent -and look, moreover, while she delivered this lively tirade, that piqued and puzzled him. Hlad such a thing been possible, he would have felt assured that she was no. stranger to the true cause of his consistent avoidance of Helen. He was not an admirer or friend of Miss Calvert. When a boy, he had mortally offended her by pronouncing her "a whey-faced witch," which observation, by means of some kind tongue, reached her ears. The feud was further in creased by his invariable championship of Helen, in the petty quarrels between the girls. Lily professed to like ,him at this date. It had even been slyly and gratuitously sug- gested to him, by disinterested young ladies and prudent mammas' that he, the elder and richer brother, was regarded by the Floyd connection as a bon parti, and probable suitor of the colonel's younger ward, now that the other was "out of ,the market." This benevolent warning he received with profound carelessness, and did not trouble himself to contro. vert the theory. It was not fear of these tattlers that kept him away from the home of the elfin beauty. Yet it might be expedient-to throw them yet farther /off the right scent, besides showing his contempt for their impertinent gossip by riding fearlessly by Robert's side, behind the Floyd car- fiage, when it rolled away from the church door on this bright day, and his officious friends were looking on, in rows and squads, awaiting the arrival of their respective vehicles.  F ,ora wonder, the Lays were the only persons present be. mi as the family at dinner, and all found the repast a dull s   ,COLONEL, FLOYD S WAIDS.     . 87 and cheerless ceremony, although the cookery did ample credit to Mrs. Floyd's kitchen. The poor lady's eyes were red and watery. She had a headache and catarrh, she said; but the initiated members of the company, and this included the entire number, recollecting that she had returned from church in her usual spirits and bodily condition, ,Were not slow in assigning a more plausible reason for these signs of discomfort, in viewing the knit brows and hearing the gruff tones of her sovereign master. - He carved savagely, and wasted as few decent words -upon his guests as he, could, taking no share whatever in the conversation that Lily, - Robert, and Aleck tried to keep up, to pover his surlin ess and Mrs. Floyd's tremor. He broke a goblet, in pushing it roughly against the dish before him; swore audibly at the quaking servants; and finally ordered his second son from the table in a voice of thunder, for spilling water on the cloth. The colonel seldom went to church except in summer-time, when he could pass the hours of service out of doors, under the trees shading the sacred edifice, talking politics with neighbors as graceless as himself. He had spent the fore- noon of this Sabbath in examining his account-books-- "business papers' his wife styled them, in a lame apology she offered in the drawing-room for his t" being out of sorts ;" he having finished the meal he had succeeded in spoiling for every one else, and stalked off up to his chamber for his Sunday afternoon nap. "It always gives him the blues to look over, these tire- some papers!" she sighed, while she tried to smile at the absurdity of allowing such trifles to mar one's happiness. "I often wish there were no money matters in the world. I don't pretend to understand them myself!t" "Few ladies do!" said Aleck. ',-They are among the ills: of life which are confined almost exclusively to us unhappy men."   88  '  -   COLONELt ' FLOYD'SD WARDS. - Helen met Robert's eye with a forced smile, which was returned. by one :yet more mirthless. !:Can he be so unjist, after all my frankness, as to imagine me mercenary?"   uif ught, indignantly. ; 'His ut omfor"^tations were, in reality, dwelling ,pon the strong h   that the "business papers" which had stirred up the    bile appertained to the records of his stewardship iveris niece's estate, and the certainty, if this were so, that there were vexatious trials of patience in store for himself, when he and the guardian came to the dreaded-final settlement, The diversion was not unwelcome when Lily called him into her green-house, to inspect a plant he had sent her some time before. It was drooping and yellow,-from some cause,d whose discovery was beyond the reach of her horticultural acumen. Robert was a zealous and: accomplished amateur florist, --and his decision, after a minute examination of the flower, and inquiry into the course she had pursued towards it;, was, that she was killing it wit i kindness. "You pet it too much; water it too abundantly; and dress the earth about 'the roots t Do often. Plants require rest,. like animals. This needs a little wholesome neglect; a judlbious letting alone, with plenty of sunshine. That will bring it atound, if it is not too far gone."

Whether he would have released himself from this position, or awaited the recovery of her composure, -was not to be seen.  "'A letter for you, Miss Lilyl" said Aleck's voice behind them. . His face was stern-his eye and accent penetrating. "Your aunt was going to bring it in to you, and I took charge of it to spare her the trouble." He bowed-and withdrew, before either of the twain, whom his abrupt address had started, could find breath or words for a reply. He was not surprised, on returning to the parlor, to per. ceive that it was deserted. The stiff and labored dialogue carried on by himself and Helen, after they were left together by the floral connoisseurs, was so difficult and painrful to both the participants, that he had seized upon the circumstance of Mrs. Floyd's ,entrance with a note for Lily as an opportune pretext for ending the miserable pre- tenee. Helen understood his eager politeness to her aunt, and contributed her share towards their mutual relief by leaving the coast clear before he reappeared. There was a dark flush of passion upon Aleck's brow as he strode over to- the window, and his mouth worked convulsively under his heavy moustache while he remained there, looking out upon the wintry landscape, blasted and sere, like his own bopes He iwas displeased with Robert-more than dis- pleased with the nrinature siren, whose enticements were operating upon the senses of her cousin's affianced hus- band.  "e can izve twenty women-I but one.! If she were mine, I would have shrunk with loathing from the touch of   I   that little serpent! Instead of enduring her Subtlety and fond twinings about me, would have cast her from me as a hateful thing! How different was the scene transpiring-in here! Have I, then, more regard for his rights and honor than he has limself?"  It was a hasty and unjust aspersibn of his brother's fidelity and delicacy of affection for his betrothed; but his wrath glowed yet more hotly as he reviewed, in detail, the illustration of rigid self-control, amounting to coldness, his manner to Helen had afforded; his absolute reticence of even friendly warmth towards the woman he neverthe- less adored; the extreme circumspection he exercised over each glance and word, lest Robert's bride should chance to read in any of these that which it would be dishonorable in him, who was soon to be her brother, to show; and contrasted this line of conduct and principle with Robert's passive, if not. fond reception of blandishments, such as he had inter- rupted.  He was too angry to look around when Lily's clear voice was heard at the door connecting conservatory and parlor. "Helen! Helen I Why, Mfr. Lay, I thought she was entertaining you all this time!" "You were mistaken, you see!'" he answered, curtly. "Don't you know where she has gone?" "I do not!" "Then I must hunt her up! It was'very uncivil in her to leave you here all alone. I shall scold her well for it?I Away she ran, singing in her bird-like tones as if she had never shed a tear in her life. Robert, who had come in with her, silently took a seat by the fire. Without having the remotest conception of the hidden reasons that exasperated into deep displeasure Alecl's righteous disapproval of the supposed flirtation, the younger; brother yet felt that he had placed himself, or been placed    4LONEL ELOY'S WARDS.          X by another, in a false light in his mentpr's eyes. Unwilling to makea serious affair of an occurrence so trivial, or to Pimpute forwardness and levity of deportment to Lily, he was nearly as reluctant to sustain in his own proper person the weight of the blame Aleck ascribed to one or both of them. That he did blame somebody for what he had seen, Robert did not need his present behavior to convince him. He knew his ideas of a lover's honor--his delicate fastidious- ness upon some -points relative to this-scruples for which  none save those who were most intimately acquainted with -him ever gave him credit. Gay rattle and reckless flirt as he was generally esteemed, his chivalrous respect .fbr true womanhood amounted to reverence; his'recognition of in- nate purity was instinctive, Had he been betrothed, he would have expected-not exacted-a whole-hearted de- votion, not of the affections merely, but of the mind. If he scorned to-exercise the slightest espionage upon the movements of hisfiancde or wife, left her, as free as air, to obey the bent of her inclinations, it would be because he believed, with a faith more powerful than the convictions produced by sight, that she was as pure as the freshest air ever breathed from Heaven ; that she was his-heart, body, and imagination,. incapable of cherishing a thought she would not impart to him; and he would have given as much as he asked. His teasing talk with his aunt about the fabulous Gretchen, and his fine compliments to heedless butterflies like Virginia Shore, were the veriest lip-play, and every one who knewhim understood the badinage and flattery.; No girl could accuse him of more culpable trifling, of the most distant approach to unwarrantable familiarity in language or touheh.  Robert was conscious that he was sinless in respect to that whereof lie feared his brother held him to be guilty; jet, he said to himself, that he wished, since Lily's un-   'COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.   93   guarded, because artless action, was destined-to have another spectator besides himself, that-it had been Helen, and not Aleck. She would have judged of the case more charitably, approximated the truth more nearly. But some- thing must be said to undeceive the real judge, and there was no time to be lost.         ' a "Aleck-old boy 1" He passed his arm over his brothers shoulder, who stood like a statue of ice under the embrace. "Are you thinking hardly of me?-blaming me: for the little scene you happened to behold just now?" "You are master of your ownconscience and actions," rejoined the other, freezingly. "I do not presume to sit in condemnation upon either."        - "I require no stronger evidence that you have arraigned me already--condemned me unheard," Robert said, in a hurt tone.' "You should know me better, Aleck! If you had heard the rest of the conversation you would be more lenient. I wish you had!" He waited for a response, but none came. "It was the simplest, most innocent of gallant farces, Al!"Robert resumed, in a lighter tone. "' When a pretty woman shows her rings, What can a fellow do? "That is an analogous quandary tothe one: in which you saw me--for which you are inclined to have 'me hanged, drawn, and quartered."  -'The question is," said Aleck, turning to face his brother, and speaking slowly, with no softening of his severity, "the question is, whether a man, situated - you are, has a right, or ought to have the disposition, to think of the. beauty of any other woman?" "Pshaw 1" replied the other, still determined to turk the itair into a jest, "that dogma belongs to a formefrgener-  COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.. ation; the Grandisonian race of swains and shepherdesses; the age that painted Cupid blind." "That is very possible. My ideas upon this subject are decidedly antiquated, I admit; somewhat deficient, more- over, in-tolerance of this ' dear passion for many' that mod- ern lovers find so delightful!" answered Aleck, crossing to  the fireplace, and throwing himself upon the sofa. N6thing further passed between them for that time. Even Robert's sweet temper was ruffled by the unmerited sneer. Their disputes were of such rare occurrence that reconciliation was an awi ard undertaking, if either were disposed to attempt it. "Excuse me for leaving you!" cried Lily, floating into the room-her airy motion could hardly be called walking -" but. Nelly and I have been arranging a frolic for this evening. Won't you, gentlemen, aid and abet us?" "The better the day the better the deed?" said Robert, playfully interrogative. He would not allow Aleck's unjust imaginings to influ- ence ]his demeanor to this unsophisticated, warm-hearted child. "Yes-but this is really and truly a Sunday frolic. Mr. Sheppard, the new circuit-rider, is to preach to the servants at Mr. Shore's to-night, and Ginnie has written to say that we must all come. She knows you came home with us to dinner, so She will expect both, of you, certainly. I dearly enjoy these colored meetings-don't you, Mr. Robert?" "That depends upon their hue. I have found them very blue, and a dingy indigo at that, sometimes--taking blue- ness and dulzess as synbnyms." '"Oh! you know what I meant! Why will you be pro- voking? Mr. Lay, I wish you would take him in hand, and teach him how to behave as you do." Aleck did hot raise his eyes from his booky, He would   OOLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.   not be a party to this deceitful trifling. Lily gave him a stare of inquiry, and returned to the more complaisant Robert. "They say this Mr. Sheppard is a stirring speaker, a thoroughgoing revivalist; and the ride home by moon* light will be splendid 1"   96       OOLONEL FLOD'S W   eAR&  '.   ,     ,             i  c CHAPTER VI. SEvEN  o'lock found the quartette from Belleview in the reivalist's-Udience, at one end of Mr. Shore's long dining- hall. The white population of the neighborhood was principally  made op of Episcopalians, with a slight sprinkling of Roman Catholics; but Mr. Shore wedded for his second wife a de- vout Methodist,whose example and precept' hadwrought great, and,' it was hoped by the reformer, radicalschanges in the religious bhabits of the slaves upon her own and certain of the surrounding-plantations. The clergymen of her de- nomination, whose itinerant habits brought them within range of communication with her,' were urgently invited to visit at, and most hospitably entertained in, her house  en- couraged to establish meetings for public and social worship among the negroes, innovations which were not opposed, but rather forwarded, by her indulgent, irreligious husband. The gathering on this occasion was made up, for the most part, of colored people, a goodly assembly in number, seated in eiose rows upon benches manufactured for such purposes by Mrs. Shore's orders.. The room was narrow in proportion to its length, and had a fireplace at each end. Around the upper one of these were ranged chairs, for the accommoda tion of the family and neighbors. There were about thirty in 'al  f and while' the younger portion of the company had nidoubtedly been attracted thitherby the  consideration that had moved Lily's inclination t wiattend, namely, the love of   COLONEL FLOYD S WAR.         9 s . a froli let the clay be what it might,--they beaved ith due decorum, preserved the semblance of resp'ct "e att#6- tion. it would not have been safe to act otherwise :uner Mrs. Shore's watchful eyes. Mr. Sheppard was suffering from hoarseness, having ial ready delivered two sermons and conclduted a class-meeting that day, besides riding twenty miles on horsebaci. He therefore the more gladly coinmitted the p'relimiiary and closing exercises of singing and prayer to those of the on- gregation who were able and willing to ligshtenhis laboIrs'by taking their part in the same.

"Why, Lily! that is downright stinginess, and not what we should have expected from you! We girls expected a sprig apiece for- our bouquets, and the brides should be composed almost entirely of them. What is a wedding without orange-blossoms?"               o "You will shortly have an opportunity of seeing, unless you furnish yourselves from some other quarter, Not one of mine shall you have." Apparently, the diminutive beauty was what would have beeni termed, in a" larger and homelier woman, "desperately out of humor."        .  "One would think that this tree was a present from your true-love-you value its productions so highly!'i observed another "friend." Lily bit her lip, and her blue eyes emitted sparkleW of an- Wy light. Only Helen, of all the girls, knew thit Robert was the donor of nearly every rare plant in her colectfolo ;   122       COLONEL FLOYD S WARBDS that the orange-tree was one of his contributions, she hav' ing raised it from a graft set expressly for her by his hand, three years before,-in a fine bush that graced the Greenfield conservatory; and Helen did not know how sedulously she had tended it to its present flourishing estate; the kisses she had showered upon its glossy leaves; the tears that had lately gemmed its snow-white petals-but the random hit was stinging.    - "Lily is quite right, allow me to say, young ladies!" said the bride, coming to the help of her discomfited rival. "The tree is too beautiful as it now is, to be spoiled by your destructive fingers. The green-house will be lighted to-morrow evening, and the'orange be the queen of the floral belles."  "I comprehend! 'Touch not a single bough!"' said Virginia, dramatically. "But I want to ask, my dear Mrs. Lay-- Mercy, Helen! don't murder me with your eyes, and upton -my word of honor as a lady, I won't give you the title again until the minister grants me leave!", cried the giddy creature, crouching behind the chair of her nearest neighbor, in affected terror.             "What were you about to inquire?" said Helen, recov- ering herself.        - "Only whether you expected Mr. Lay over to-night.; whether he is so selfish and lover-like as to deprive us of your society on this,.the last evening of your freedom?" "He will not be here, I think.   Do you want me, Sally?"    \ "No, ma'am,-but your uncle told me to say as how he would like to speak to you a minute in the -office." Sally had never said "'master" to or of Colonel Floyd, when she could avoid it, since the shooting adventure in the melon-patoh.

To this uninviting retreat had Colonel Floyd retired with his tormentors-thee accounts off his ward's estate, or papers purporting to be such. They were scat tered upon a  dingy table, fromn which hung tattered strips of 'baize that had been green, and whereupon stood also as couple of candles and an ,inkstand.

There is one "  He pushed towards her a sheet of large dimensions, covered with figures.  'I will take a seat, since this is to be inspected," said Helen, coolly, drawing up a chair with a broken back-the most secure one that offered itself among the unfortunate collection-and dusting it with her handkerchief. The chlonel's brows met ominously. "You are not required to undertake that task. Mr. Lay has examined it, and is satisfied that it is correct." "I do not see how that can be.

I am the fittest person to judge of the accuracy of your statements." Unheeding the muttered curse at her " perversity" and "unbearable insolence," she reviewed the long- columns of . numerals; dwelt thoughtfully upon particular items, and raised her eyebrows meaningly at the sum total. "I shall-not affix my signature to this, sir!" she said, letting the sheet fall as she finished its study. "I too have a statement to make, which it is proper you should hear.

"Will you have the goodness to 'inspect,' since you are so fond of using the word, that-and let me have your ladyship's judgment of it?" He flung an envelope over to her so rudely, that it wizzed past her'cheek and fell to the floor.  Nowise disconcerted I   by his violent tone and action, she stooped to pick it up.

You recognize the handwriting, I presume?" i   "I think that I do." "It bears a very tolerable resemblance to Mr. Robert Lay's, does it not?"             . "It does!"  Helen laid the letter down with an air of un. concern. "It was written by him, and intercepted by myself-" "In that case I shall take the liberty of restoring it to the rightful owner," interrupted she, stretching herhand towards the letter.

If demon ever wore a more fiendish smile than the sneer that curled -his lip and looked evilly from his eye at that moment, it must have been the prince of devils himself. Helen's features hardened into stone beneath it. "I have nothing'to say to such a tale, sir, except to in- sist, still, that the letter shall be delivered to the person for whom it was intended!"

"Am I going mad? What, am I to think? What can I do? GOD help me in this fearful strait!"

Strengthen-me to tell him the truth, and then do with me as Thou wilt. ]Keep far from me all bitter or revengeful thoughts of him- for, oh! am I not the more guilty of the two? Did not my sin of unfaithfulness and deceit precede his?" She still knelt-still looked upward, in inaudible supplica. tion, accompanied by fast-flowing tears, when the lock of the door, which she thought she had made fast at her entrance, was drawn back, and a figure glided in. The faint starlight revealed enough of the small figure and *waxen face to show who was the intruder, if her cousin had not recognized her by the noiseless grace of her movements. Supposing that she had come on some errand that would not detain her more than a minute, Helen- crouched lower to avoid being seen, and waited, with hushed breath, for her departure. Every fibre of her frame thrilled to the low cry of agony that stirred the silence of the place. Lily was standing by the orange-tree, which loomed up a pyramid of dusky white in the darkness; bent over and -caressed it as if it were a sen- tient thing, while sobs, mingled with incoherert lamentations, attested the depths and reality of her sorrow. Helen never afterwards inhaled the scent of orange-blos- soms without a return of the heart-sickness, the dqathly faintness of spirit, that came over her in that season of pain- ful irresolution. Lily's heart was breaking,-and she stood between her and happiness,-she, with her empty vows and 'ailing resolution! and did not Robert approach the altar with a divided, if not a recreant heart? "Oh, Helen! if you-could only know!" said Lily, with a fresh- paroxysm of tears. In the woman's grief there was still a touch of the child's   130      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. fretfumness and impatience at being thwarted. Helen seldom denied her any gratification which it was in her power to afford, and this moan appealed to the sympathies of the listen-. er with peculiar and pathetic force. She was the elder of the two-the stronger and wiser ;-her own folly and per. verseness had brought her trouble upon her; but what had this poor girl done that her life should be blighted? "She does know, my darling!" Helen put her arm,around her neck; would have drawn her to her bosom; spoken words of pity and of prqomise; but at her voice and touch Lily sprang back with a stifled shriek; in her mad alarm, struck at the speaker with all her strength, and sped away like a ffrightened -hare at the sound of the 'hunter's horn. The assault took Helen so entirely by surprise that she staggered against the orange-tree and fell to the floor with it. When she regained her feet, she was alone in the dark- ness. She would not, she: could not follow Lily then! Hers was a generous and not implacable disposition, but it was not in it'to recover immediately from the indignation awa- kened by this unfeminine and uncousinlytreatment. She had bruised her shoulder against the flower-stand, and her bosom ached intensely from the effects of Lily's blow. She had not meant to hurt her, Helen knew-perhaps had not recog- nized the person who accosted her so unexpectedly--but her hand had fallen sharply.  "To, morrow!"Helen promised herself.-"By that time she may be ready to listen and I to speak calmly. A night of sober thought'will be beneficial to both of us." Merriment and gamesome entertainment ran high in the parlor that evening, for the bridesmaids were not without their attendant train of admirers. .

MISS RUTH had slept but indifferently well the night be. fore Christmas.  Her maidenly dreams were vexed by images of bridal veils; jellies that poured from the moulds in splashing, insipid liquids, when she would have had them pellucid, flavorous, and firm; torn kid gloves, that could not be mended; burnt and curdled custards; cakes' with .sticky icing and streaky interiors; pie-crust heavy with rancid butter, or tough as leather for want of the for- gotten "shortening;" nuptial benedictions; showers of tears; hail-storms of kisses, congratulatory and confection- ery; jumbled into a confusing, distracting medley, that al- lowed her tortured brain not one hour 'of natural sleep out of the six she spent in bed. "Upon my word," said the good soul, when a ray of red light from the coming sun flecked the gray East, and ap- prised her that the world would soon be awake-" upon my word, I don't believe I could have rested worse if I were expecting to be married myself to-day-and that is saying a good deal!"  By sunrise she was dressed and had mustered her troop of menials. The happy pair were to come home for the second day's feast, the splendor of which was to suffer no diminution by contrast with Mrs. Floyd's wedding-supper. The same company would be present, and comparisons wereiinvitable. The dear woman was brave and confident in view of all this. She had not kept the cleanest house in three counties, and the best table in six, for twenty years, to   COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS.          133   be appalled by the array of any odds of this kind that could be brought against her-no! no! not by the Fl0yds them- selves, whose profuse hospitality was proverbial. So, buck- ling on her armor, in the shape of an immense check apron, two breadths wide in the skirt, reaching to the bottom of her dress, and with a broad bib attached, which was pinned up to her double chin, she walked, with her prim but brisk little pace, to her cake-room. Cake, cake everywhere, and not a faulty crumb in the collection! Snowballs whose hearts were yellow sponge, and their surfaces white satin;. loaves of " pound," smooth, fluted, and beflowered, conical and hexagon, all rich enough to guarantee, on their own responsibility, a fit of dyspepsia to each rash taster among the expected guests; silver cake that, when cut and heaped in alternate slices with the gold, should present a pleasing sight to the eye and agreeable associations to the mind of the beholder; piles of slender "ladies' fingers" and macaroons, cocoa-nut and almond, light as a feather and sweet as sugar; two immense struc- tures, precisely similar in size and shape, inwardly a tooth- some but perilously indigestible conglomeration of currants, raisins, citron, and spices, held together in a not very strong union by a cement of 'eggs, sugar, and flour, made brittle with butter,-externally, twin mountains of snow, wreathed with garlands of the same material as the icing; and upon the summit of each a pink Cupid-the festoon of roses, his insufficient tunic, offering a self-evident apology for the exaggerated flesh-color of his cuticle, when the thermometer stood, as it did this morning, at the freezing-point.  He trode with one foot upon a pair of hearts, also in sugar, spitted together by a red dart, and his bow was drawn at a venture.  Before these her chefs-d'ceuvre, being the bride and bride- groom's cakes, and destined to adorn the head and foot of   134:      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. her dessert-table, ]Miss Ruth paused in full satisfaction, folded her hands upon the check apron, and set her head on one side. A minute elapsed before she spoke or moved; then she inclined her head towards the other' shoulder, gently rubbed her fat palms together, and sighed, in sub- lime content- "YES!"      I A shout of laughter from the open door behind her answered. Her nephews, both early abroad on this morn- ing, had encountered each other in the passage leading past the' apartment devoted, for the time, to the genius who pre- sides over " good things," and stopped simultaneously to inspect the array, and the chief-priestess of the temple. "Yes!" repeated Aunt Ruth, in an altered tone, a blush creeping up to her cap-border. The " particle," as irst enunciated, denoted the height of mortal complacency: now it signified-"I know you wicked boys are making fun of me, but I don't care! I am strong in the consciousness of merit." They came in-Robert foremost--still laughing. "Aunty? do you mean that Mrs. Lay, 'who-is-to-be, is to live by cake alone throughout the honeymoon? That would be rather too impressive an illustration-of the saying, ' Sweets to the sweet!' Hey, Aleck?" Aleck smiled, but somewhat constrainedly. "I believe that caged humming-birds are usually fed upon  honey-paste, as the diet best suited to their constitutions and tastes, while in a state of bondage. Aunt Rlith, you have excelled yourself! I can say nothing more complimen- tary '" "Wait until you see the jellies, blanc-manges, charlottes, and ice-creams 1" replied the housewife, in pardonable vanity. "Or, rather,.until you taste them!

( I do notfeel, just now, as if I should ever care to eat another mouthful," said the groom expectant, with a, slight grimace. "I was scared with visions last night; tormented by all sorts of hobgoblins, and am appptiteless this morn ing." "Yes!" retorted Aunt Ruth, slyly. "I suppose that it is a common symptom in the circum- stances!" answered Robert, coloring a little, " but I had noat expected to feel exactly as I do on this, my wedding-day." "The smell of the calke is sickening- to an empty stom- ach!" said Aleck, retreating towards the door. ('I don't see how you can endure it, Aunt Ruth." Robert-overtook him upon the piazza. You look pale, Al!" he remarked, linking his arm in his brother's, and falling into step with him, in his hurried walk up and down the long porch. "I wish that I could attribute my uncomfortable sensations to bodily ailment! It may sound ungallant, unloverlike, and pusillanimous, but I must confess that I could, without great repugnance, cast my vote for a postponement of the 'happy occasion,' ardently as I have desired its coming, from the earliest hour of my en- gagement. I wish it were all over! I grow positively nervous and tremulous in the anticipation."' His laugh did indeed shake, and his complexion, usually clear and sanguine, took a cadaverous tinge. Aleck gnawed his moustache-a fierce, restless movement he strove to conceal by passing his hand over his mouth. "I suppose," he said, presently, " that, as Aunt Ruth in. timated, this species of stage-fright frequently seizes upon men in your position, and that persons of your temperament are peculiarly liable to fall victims to it." The latter clause was added involuntarily, as it were, ad   UOLONU-4L FLOYUXD S WARDS JI. Robert flushed ap at the latent touch of meaning in the accent. , "It is sheer nervousness-nothing else!" he returned, eagerly-"induced, I verily believe, by the ugly dreams that beset my pillow all night. One vision haunts me wher- ever I look. I thought that I sat by Helen, holding her hand, and talking earnestly and happily of the life upon which we were about entering, when, ll at once, she start- ed up and confronted me, and I saw, instead of her features -ugh!    I will not tell you of the horrid sight!, Yet I dreamed this .three times, and awoke half dead with fright." "You had the night-mare. The sights and smells of hot sweets that have hung about the premises lately have been enough to give any one dyspeptic visitings. Do not dwell upon such fancies!  You are but deepening impressions unsuited to your real feelings and the actual event before you. What a splendid day!" "Is it not?" With his accustomed elasticity of mood Robert welcomed the change of theme. "Happy the bride that the sun shines on! Mlay this bright Christmas morn- ing be an augury of good to her! I shall try to 'make her happy! If zealous endeavor and ardent desire of mine can do this, she will never have cause for sorrow. Yet I have not been without my doubts on this head." Aleck made no reply, and they took several turns in their promenade before the other resumed: "She is a singular girl-a woman of marked character, and I have often feared, recently, that we did not quite under- stand one another; asked myself if we ever would attain to that perfection of mutual confidence that constitutes so large a proportion of the happiness of the true marriage. There seems to be a background of motive and feeling to which I am denied admittance. Yet I do love her! I have loved   her from the time when we were happy children together -we three, and-Lily Calvert!"' There was a slight hesitancy in his pronunciation of the last name, and Aleck's eyes fell quickly-burningly-upon the speaker's countenance.  "Is she the cause of the misunderstanding you deplore ?" he asked, sternly. "Partly--and yet, no! You wrong poor Lily, Aleck, and I fear that Helen does also. I knorw the child better than either of you can do. There are many allowances to be made for her." "You make many, I see ! But we will not revive that subject on this day, of all others. A year hence these trivial differences of opinion and feeling between us will be forgotten, will have died a natural death and be buried without parade. And sooner still will fade into empty air the imaginary want of confidence and congeniality between your wife and yourself." "You are the prince of prophets-the king of seers!  Away with bugbears and dreams! Vive l'amour!" called out Robert, swinging his hat around his head, while the early sunshine wove of his fair hair a glittering crown. Aleck looked at him with a loving, aching heart. "You are a handsome fellow, Robert; I do not wonder all the girls fall in love with you!" "Nonsense! You are the right sort of man to play the deuce with the softer sex'! tall, dark-haired, dark-eyed, and 'bearded like the pard'-' grand, gloomy, and peculiar,' as that rattle, Virginia Shore, called you in my hearing one day. I have said to Helen several times that it was strange'. she had not taken you instead of me. You would have made a splendid couple!" "Don't, Robert! it is both wrong and foolish to run on in that strain," said Aleck, in grave, sad rebuke. "I can.   1OO    '      jUAi }'LhJU D W;atJt/0. not understand how you bring yourself to jest upon sue,. S theme-how you endure the imagination of resigning her you love to another." "Because it is aq imagination, and nothing else! What a glorious day! Did you ever breathe such invigorating air before--ever see such sunlight? ' Every beam is clari- fied to diamond purity and lustre. 'Happy the bride, that the sun shines on' -I say again! What is the correspond- ing adage? There is one, isn't there?" "'Blessed the corpse that the rains fall upon,' I believe," responded his brother. "It runs somewhat after that fashion."      'For pity's sake, man, keep your death's-heads out of sight when you can!"Robert exclaimed, half-angrily. "I had a surfeit of them last night. What have they to do with daylight and bridals, I should like to know'? But isn't that Gabriel trotting down the road? I hope nothing has gone wrong at Belleview." They walked out to the gate to meet the Cimmerian Mercury. His grin and bow in nearing them, his saucily- deferential "Christmas gift, my marsters!" dispelled what- ever anxiety either might have experienced as to any out- ward calamity in his master's household., "All well, Mars' Robert," he replied to the inquiry after the health of the family. "I've brung a note for you, sur." Aleck turned to go back to the house as this was pre- sented, but, against his will, his falcon eye saw the address before he wheeled-so carelessly was the transfer from one hind to the other performed. The billet was directed to a "Mr. Robert C. Lay, Greenfield. In haste," and the chi- rography resembled Lily's, he thought. It was assuredly not Helen's. He had paced the porch for perhaps fifteen minutes when -Robert joined him. Aleck had seen him $   -       -                * ' "'^ '    COLONEL FLOYDXS WARM.       139 scribble something with a. pencil upon a scrap of paper, using the gate-post for a desk; fold it, and give it to the messenger; Gabriel, meanwhile, sitting still upon his horse and eying the operation, from under the brim of his old felt hat, with intense interest. i When he had deposited the reply in the crown of the said head-covering, he set off on a gallop in the direction of home. Then the bridegroom came slowly up the walk, wearing a very unbridegroomlike aspect, re-reading the gilt-edged sheet. He thrust it in .  to his vest-pocket as he reached the steps; mounted them, and continued .the exercise the boy had interrupted. He volunteered no explanation of what Aleck had seen and overheard, although he looked worried and perplexed, and sighed repeatedly, in deep thought or sadness. Finally, when the breakfast-bell ended their matutinal stroll, and disturbed his revery, he said, with an appear, ance of frankness, laying his hand upon his brother's shoulder,- "I am ready to acknowledge that you know my weak points better than I do myself, All I wish I were more like you in certain respects." !"You have chosen a sorry examplar!" replied the other. "Act out what conscience and honor dictate, Robin, and you cannot go wrong." , "Is the voice of feeling then to be wholly disregarded?" asked Robert, looking down. "If it militates against the other and surer monitors- yes-a thousand times, yes 1" said Aleck, emphatically. And, "Ah! brother mrine! we are made of different stuff! where you would be adamant, I am very soft wax- - a fickle, cowardly dog!" ended the -dialogue, for Aunt Ruth,- to whom every minute of daylight was now precious, appeared in the house door to expedite their progress to the dining-room. lt    "O      CLONEL FLOYDTS WARDS. Robert had, as -he had said, little or no appetite for food, but he either was, or feigned to be, in finer spirits than he had been able to summon, an hour previous. He rallied Miss:Ruth upon her household arrangements; prophesying all manner of failures in the delicate and critical manufac- tures that yet remained to be perfected; teased her about an antiquated bachelor planter, a former beau of hers, who had, he affirmed, been fitted by a Baltimore tailor with a bran-new suit of clothes, 'to be sported- that night, in the hope of tempting her to a reconsideration of the discard she had given him twenty-five years ago; condoled with his brother, because-of the probable state of utter isolation that menaced him in his sojourn at Maple Hill, in view of his housekeeper's defection and desertion; inquired gravely from whose establishment the marriage would take place, and warmly advocated the claims of Greenfield to that honor; in fine, conducted himself in such a wild, incon- venient3 manner, that his aunt was heartily rejoiced when he obeyed her commands and quitted the table. Aleck met him soon afterwards on the stairs, equipped for a ride. "You allow yourself ample time for your jaunt!" ob- served the elder- brother, taking out his watch. "I meant to ride with, you so far as our way remained the same, but ' have not ordered my horse yet." "You are very kind, and I should like to -have your company, but I am in a hurry," said Robert, pulling on a tight new buckskin glove, and studiously avoiding Aleck's eye.                       , "It is- but half-past nine, and I understood you to sa] that you were to meet Colonel' Floyd at the clerk's office by eleven." "Oh I for that matter, twelve %ould do as well as eleven if the colonel is faithful to his practice of unpunctuality,   COLONEL.

I dare say you mighto not deem it obligatory upon yourself to keep it, you are such a stone pillar in firmness and fixity, when you will .it to be so.

Could the loving kinsman ever judge harshy of him, while the image of that face, with its sweet smile'and in-  genuous eyes, remained stamped upon the mind's retina? --so long as the pleading tones, gentle and fond, yet not free from mournfulness, continued to sound in his ears? Adamantine -pillalr though his brother regarded him, Aleck would, if questioned thus at that moment, have replied in- dignantly in the negative. "Robert!" called Miss Ruth, hearing the ring of his iron heel upon the frozen-walk outside of the window of the pantry, where she was up to her ears-figuratively speak- ing--in calves'-foot jelly.      .   -  She threw up the'sash, and he leaned upon the sill. "Where are you going?" inquired the aunt, without suspending her occupation of whipping into aggravated pallor and foam  the whites of a dozen eggs she had just broken into a dish upon the table.

"But I shall not believe that I am really going to commit matrimony, until I find myself face to face with the parson. Aunty, you, are look- ing divinely, to-day I! Have you no bowels of mercy, that you can coolly contemplate the certainty of driving old Gales to desperation by the spectacle of your unapproach- able charms?'  "Yes l" sneered Miss Massie, in lofty incredulity; but the wintry bloom deepened in her plump cheeks, and the- egg-whisk flew like lightning- through the stiffening froth. - I never was more in earnest in my life!" pursued- the nephew.- "Look at me, as at an imperfect illustration of what his deplorable condition will be. Don't you see that I cannot tear myfself from the survey of so much love- liness?" Miss Ruth set down the dish, and picked up a switch from a bundle that lay near, to furnish rods for beating trifles and creams. Robert dodged the blow-not a heavy one, it must be owned. "Cruel creature! is this the treatment which all your admirers are to receive?' he complained, at a safe distance. "Alas for Gales's new broadcloth 1" "When are you coming home?" inquired his aunt, dignifi- edly. She would have no more of this foolery.

A pelting rain of empty eggshells upon his head and shoulders admonished him to retreat, which he did, reeling with laughter, and glancing over his shoulder at Aleck, who had remained upon the end of the piazza--a spectator of the spirited scene. How handsome and light-hearted he looked I Cravens and traitors never wore such innocent and joyous mien!      ,                 I '"He may be misguided by judgment, unduly swayed by his pliable temper and tenderness of heart, but he can never be guilty of actual and deliberate wrong!" was Aleck's con- elusion. "That boy will plague the life out of me yet I!" said Miss Ruth, in a tone intended to counterfeit peevishness. "I don't know what has got into him this morning. It's a bad sign for a bird to sing before breakfast. The cat will cetch him before night, and Robert has begun the day in too great a glee.

"You ought not to go at all, I think. You are looking badly. Come back early and take a nap this afternoon. This evening's work will be no trifle to you, seeing you are first groomsman and Robert's, brother." "You are very thoughtful, but I hope that I have strength to do and bear all that lies before me," responded Aleck, walking away.

IT was not often that Aleck Lay's eyes played him false; yet, notwithstanding their evidence in this ease, Gabriel was Helen's messenger. She had arisen early on her wedding- morn--before the herald ray that ended Aunt Ruth's uneasy slumbers pierced the darkness of the night--and committed to paper the substance of a confession composed during the many sleepless hours she had consumed in prayer and thought. She no longer withheld from her intended hus- band the secret of her prior attachment, while she sedulous- ly concealed the name of the one she had loved, and all cir- cumstances. that might assist in leading Robert to a correect surmise as to his identity with his brother. She had suffered i an early disappointment, she said; one that had, she was- sometimes led to fear, deprived her of the power of ever loving again with equal fervor. While smarting under this blow, she had precipitately and wickedly received his atten- tions, and entered into the engagement of marriage now ex- isting between them. "I beg that you will acquit me of having, in this transac- tion--culpable as it was-been guilty- of wilful wrong to you," she wrote, in continuation. "I was persuaded, when I promised you my hand, as I am now, that I could give you all the heart I have left to bestow upon any mdn. I love you sincerely, appreciatively, as a friend who is'nearer: t me even than a brother could be. I can pledge-.you my faith without a sigh for a happier lot; can take honestly upon   "6  -    COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. me the vows of wedded fidelity. It will cost me no strug- gle to love, honor, and obey one whom I know to be, in all respects, worthy of my affection and duty. "Yet before we set the indissoluble seal to a contract that I death only can render void/it is best, for both our sakes, that the work of self-examination should be severe and thorough, and its result undisguised from each other. I have unveiled my past history--the saddest chapter of my life-to you, and I have surely a right-to expect, if not to demand, a corresponding degree of candor in you. Robert! I charge you by every principle of truth, honor, and manli- ness, to answer me plainly one question--Do you love Lily Calvert . I do not inquire if your conduct to her has been, in every respect, consistent with your engagements to my- self; if you have ever given her cause to believe that your attachment for her transcended that which her old playfellow and friend might innocently indulge and manifest. I look deeper; appeal solemnly to the innermost depths of your own consciousness-depths unknown save to yourself and your God. Marriage is a momentous step. I have felt this within the past twelve hours as I never thought to do. I beseech you to give the subject your most earnest consider- ation. If, as I apprehend, from my knowledge of facts con- nected with your intercourse with Lily, and my acquaint- ance with both your characters, you decide that your senti- ments for her are more like those a husband should have for his wife than the love you bear me,--your way and mine are plain. Do not act unfairly to yourself and to me--cruel- ly to her, from the consideration that you have gone too far to- retrace your course with honor. I have excellent reasons for believing that Colonel Floyd is already cognizant of your affection for his niece, and that your union with her would be far more acceptable to him than "the one you at present contemplate.   COLONEL FLOYDS WARDS.       147 "This is my proposition, if the result of your deliberation should be what I expect. Write me a line by the bearer of this, advising me of your purpose: then ride over to see Lily, this morning. Ask boldly for her, and if you gain her con- sent to the course we have concluded to adopt, afterwards keep your appointment with Colonel Floyd, and have the license filled up with your name and hers. I know what I say, when I assert that there is no likelihood of your meet- ing impediments in your path.-Even if you should, it is the right one-the only plan you can with rectitude pursue. This done, commit the rest to me. You have often praised my daring and self-possession, and I engage to afford you, in this instance, a notable display of both qualities. Instead of frowns you shall meet nothing but smiles from the wit- nesses of your marriage ceremony; congratulations upon the cleverness of the ruse that has deluded the community into the belief that you were betrothed to one cousin, while you were really, with her knowledge and approbation, plighted to the other. I am aware that this looks like a bold scheme, and that my programme of arrangements is unprecedented in the chronicles of courtship; but, Robert, dear friend! we have Bad enough of half-confidences and harrowing misun- derstandings. Let us, at the very base of the altar, throw off the mask of unworthy deception,-that must work out a weary weight of misery to us in the end, and appear in our real characters-dare to tell the truth, and the whole truth I I plead for Lily's sake no less than for ours. "But if, after all, my misgivings have been groundless, my penetration at fault with respect to-your feelings in this affair; if you are'still prepared to attest your love for me by marrying me, I stand ready and willing to fulfil my part of our agreement.

Matters can go on in their present train, and I shall expect you at the appointed hour. I leave the decision with you. It will be fraught with important con- sequences to us, and I pray--if indeed my unworthy peti- tions ever reach Heaven--that you may be guided aright. Whatever your determination may be, believe that I must evdr remain "Yours affectionately and truly, "HEIEN." If this novel epistle strike somewhat too boldly at the roof of established prejudices and precedent in love and. match-making, the shocked reader will please bear in mind that the writer was, as her betrothed had affirmed, "1 a sin. gular girl-a woman of marked character."  This was i  further demonstrated by the exclamation with which she arose from her writing-table, when the departing footsteps of her post-boy had died away in the corridor. "Now, whatever comes, I can respect myself once more!"' She had borrowed Gabriel privately from her aunt-an accommodation arranged between them the preceding everi- ing-land to insure secrecy on the subject of his errand, rather than to enjoin him to the needful exercise of faithful- ness and despatch, she had him summoned to her chamber and herself gave him his orders. The imp was agog with anticipationO of "Christmas timeo," including the wedding, and Helen contributed further to his exhilaration by a boun- tiful douceur in honor of the day he was prepared to ecel- ebrate. But he hearkened with a tolerable- semblance of  decorous seriousness to her instructions, received the pack- et, and buttoned it with exceeding care inside of his round- about, and pledged himself to inviolable discretion. Ho   ,         .   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       149 was very fond of Helen, whose steady favor and kindness. were in grateful contriast to ]Mrs. Floyd's fidgetiness, her lord's harshness, .and Lily's caprices. His young mistress did not doubt that she could rely upon him in a matter requiring so much zeal and intelligence. She enacted her part well at breakfast-time; was not only collected and cheerful in deportment, but vivacious in talk, with-sprightliness more real in appearance than was Lily's factitious animation. The latter came down late, as she gen- erally didoand, Helen fancied, avoided her cousin markedly and coldly. "By and by," was the elder's consolations "I may be permitted to tell her all, and she will do my affection justice, Until then, the less we say to one another the better. I will not rush into temptation, and I must await his warrant for speech." Altogether, it was a merry party, with the exception of Colonel Floyd, whose settled moroseness did not affect them long, since he ate little. and withndrew from the table before any one else was half through the meal.  The bride's room was the popular resort of the young ladies during the day, and Helen could not, without positive rude- ness, seclude herself for thought or preparation. .The gentlemen wisely dispersed to parts unknown directly after breakfast, most of them not showing themselves again until evening..      ' ,        ; Helen was affecting to attend to and bear a part in the- frivolous chit-chat rung into her nervous ears by the knot of idle pleasure-lovers about her, when Sally opened the door just wide 'enough to allow her mistress a glimpse - of her face, and made her signal, unobserved by the others. Helen felt the blood curdle suddenly about her heart, and numbness seize upon her limbs, at the apparition for which she had watched so long. The sign notified her of Gabriq's   150      COLONEL FLOYD'S -WARDS return. With an unintelligible murmur, intended as an apology to her associates for leaving them, she walked tot- teringly into the entry, where she found her messenger. It did not occur to. her then that he looked or-acted unlike himself, although his cowed, sulky behavior produced an unfavorable impression upon Sally, who was interrogating him with considerable asperity as to the causes of his dila. toriness. "You stopped to play 'long the road, I'll be bound!" she was saying when Helen emerged from her, chamber, "or, you went out of your way to go by the. Court House. That's always the way with you good-for-nothing chaps. So sure as you get 'a cent to spend, you're crazy till it's gone."' "That will do, Sally!" interposed Helen, faintly. "Did you deliver that letter safely, Gabriel?^ "Yes, ma'am!" dropping his head, with a hang-dog expression, altogether unlike his accustomed pertness. "(And you have an answer for me?" X' No, ma'am. He'say dere was none, and tole me jes' fur to tell you dat all was right," answered the page, mus- tering his briskness, but forlornly enough. "You are sure? Have you made no mistake? Hd you that message from Mr. Lay himself?" pressed Helen, in the earnestness of the dying hope whose existence she had not confessed to herself until this instant. Annoyed or nerved to boldness by the implied doubt of the accuracy of his report, Gabriel looked up straight at K her-an exhibition of courage or forwardness bordering upon effrontery.         ) "I'done tell you' de :xact truth, Miss Helen! He say as how you'd onderstand it, and I must be pertickler to 'peat it jes' as he said it, and I s'posed you would be satisfied ef he was!"   COLONEL FLOYDS WARDS.     '151 s You disrespectful little vilyan?" exclaired Sally, lend. ing him a cuff upon the ear. "Do you know who you're talkin' to?" "You lemme 'lone, now  you'd better!" growled the u nlucky urchin, doubling up his fists. "I won't be blag- j garied by women, and black ones, at dat, nohow!" "Shame!"  Helen's native dignity was aroused at the disgraceful altercation. \ "You both forget where you are! I am ashamed of you! Gabriel! go down-stairs directly. Sally, I forbid you to speak to him again this dayl" Gabriel was too glad to slink away, wiping his eyes and nose upon his jacket-sleeve; .but Sally stopped her mistress, who would have passed her by in offended silence. "If you please, Miss Helen, I'm very sorry I've displeased you 'pon your weddin'-day, but I mistrusted that boy had been up to some mischief, and maybe lost your letter or the answer-he looked so kind o' guilty, and I sp ke sharp to him before I remembered myself- - \ "Never mind, my good girl!"Helen interrupted the ex- cuse, that was fast becoming a tearful one. 1"I know you meant it for the best. We are all apt to act hastily and foolishy sometimes, and, as you have said, it is my wedding- day, and I ought to overlook trifles." Her smile was positively ghastly as she repeated, musingly "Yes! it is my wedding-day! There is no doubt of it now-none! none!" She walked slowly dway to the other extremity of the hall; halted by a window, and seemed to look out. "It is a beautiful day!" she said at length, less dreamily. "I think, Sally, that I should enjoy one more good, long,  lonely walk in the woods. Will you bring me my hood and cloak? and take care that nobody sees you! I do not feellike having company." She succeeded in escaping from the house and yard with-        -,   'out being bhaflenged, and took the beaten -path to the spring. At the rocky, seat beside it she paused a long while, remembering what was buried beneath the rugged tomb, and the binding words--more binding now than ever -so soon to be irrevocable-that had been spoken above it -"Until Death parts us!"Then, stooping and pressing her hand, as in caressing farewell, upon the rough,- gray surface, she said firmly--"Let the dead Past bury its dead!" and ascended the wooded eminence beyond. She stopped again when she reached the great oak where she and Robert had held their "lbusiness talk" on that moonlight-November night. The first shadow of estrange- ment had fallen upon them then and there. It was all her fault that the cloud arose--since, while she was striving to act up to the strict requirements of the duty she owed him, her heart was in wild, almost unconquerable revolt. , "No wonder that he was chilled and repelled! no wonder that I have absolutely driven him from me scores of times since then; forced him to seek consolation in another's sym- pathy, if not happiness in another's love! But we under- stand each other now--quite well! With our eyes open to the truth, each knowing the other's peculiar temptation, we are ready'to unite hands and lives, 'for better, for worse.' Heaven helping me, I shall try to please him in all things; to make him content, that he may not repent his choice!" How vividly every incident of that evening stroll was stamped upon her memory! Even Sally's sleepy approach,   i and the reason she had given her mistress, subsequently, for heiinterruption of the lover's conversation, were not forgot- ten. The fugitive Lem had never been recovered, but the dread of runaways, so common among the women and chil- dren of the slaveholding States--the bugaboos of nursery and fireside tales-had never had a hold upon Helen's mind. What she most :feared just now was the society of her fel. L I   Ww  aiU;L FLOYD  WARDS.     153 lows; what she sought, in her feverish restlessness of body and spirit, was solitude for reflection--and to gain it she plunged more deeply into the trackless forest. The ravines whose moss-grown depths and sides, thickly fringed with brushwood, afforded cool and tempting retreats in the sum. mer's heat, offered, at this season, warmer nooks than were to be found upon higher ground. At the distance of near. ly half a mile from the spring, Helen espied a resting-place that suited her fancy and purpose. Letting herself down a steep bank, overhung by dwarf cedars, she gained a white stone deeply imbedded in moss and fallen leaves-and, al. though but a few feet above the frozen rivulet that had worn the chasm to its great depth, forming a dry and comfortable seat. It had been one of her girlhood's tricks to seek out Isuch nooks and take possession of them while she read, studied, or dreamed, as her mood disposed her to do She was not studying or dreaming now, she would have said, yet she had matter for thought that kept her there a long while-how-long, she never exactly knew. She sat motionless as the stone itself, leaning listlessly. against the stout cedar clump that kept off the wind, if there were any stirring. There were not many, and they were exceedingly. trivial occurrences, to diversify the monotonous passage of the houirs or minutes, whichever they'were. A torpor of misery had complete mastery over her; and, with a dull con- sciousness that after this woesome day it would be crime to yield to its desolate entrancement, she was pa ssive, and let the gloomy spell work unchecked. The penitence and high- er resolve of the preceding night were recalled in stupid marvel how she happened to feel thus--what power support. ed her then, and bore her thoughts and aspirations into a purer, nobler sphere. She could not pray or determine now. She had expended her energy in penning that useless, may- be worse than useless letter, which Robert had not deemed w          *      * '     154      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.  worthy of a line of reply. The die was cast by another's hand, and she must abide by the throw. Ah, well! what was easier, in the abstract, than to do nothing? How arduous she found the practice of quiescence, concerned nobody except herself. A few winter birds hopped from bough to bough of the cedars, 'in quest of the blueberries that grew thereupon. She smiled vacantly in perceiving that they were not scared at seeing her. Perhaps their bright eyes were too intent upon their search for food to observe the presence of the intruder, for her green cloak and hood offered no striking contrast to the dark verdure of the evergreens. Once she heard a gun-not very far away it seemed in the still, clear day-but the report did not startle her--only as it served to awaken more poignant reminiscences than those upon which she was meditating when the sharp echo rolled through the leafless woods, was caught and repeated by the ravines, and died away sullenly among the distant hills. Did Aleck ever think of her last hunt? of the watch she had kept beside him in the Greenfield woodlands? Was the scar yet upon his shoulder? What a cruel wound it was! how fast the blood trickled through her fingers as she renewed"the compress Robert had applied, when it became deranged by the incautious movement of the injured lad! Had he forgotten all these things? Did he hate and despise her when he looked at the mark left by the shot? She wished, at times, that he did hate her, and that she knew, for-certain, that he felt this aversioh. Any active sentiment would be preferable to his unvarying coldness, His studied civility, his constrained address.     "How little I imagined in the dear old times-" She did not finish the sentence, but a single tear forc d its way from under the lid and dropped upon her hand. She shed but that one. . - .         ,           . )   COLON1EL FLOYD'S WARDS.       155 Again, a crow sailed slowly between her and the sun, and the shadow crossing the gully, made her look up. He utter- ed a hoarse croak, just as the shade of his black pinions fell upon her brow. "A bird of ill-omen!" she thought, languidly. ' Portents cannot terrify me now.! I am like the man upon the'wheel, to whom has been mercifully dealt the coup de grace as the first blow!" Awhile later, she did not trouble herself to think or care how long afterwards, there-arrived another interruption to the sluggish current of ideas. This was the tramp of ahorse's hoofs, breaking the dry sticks, and rustling the dead leaves that strewed the ground under the trees. "It will be time enough to move, or take flight, when. I am seen," was her reflection; and her indolence or listless- ness prompted her to the wisest plan for avoiding discovery. The rider was forcing his way through the undergrowth, there being not even a bridle-path in that part of the forest. It could not be the hunter, whose gun she had heard, for the Belleview lands were posted, and no Sportsman in the neigh- borhood was so reckless or intrepid as to trespass upon a domain guarded by the law and a master like the proprietor of this plantation. It must be Colonel Floyd himself or his colored overseer, or, possibly, some other negro belonging to the estate, taking a near cut to the house from the main road. Yet this would be. an unusual procedure. In spiritless curiosity, she leaned slightly to one side, where a gap in the bushes promised a sight of the equestrian. It wal but a glimpse, and an imperfect pone, which she obtained, the head and neck of the horse and the upper part of the rider's body only being visible above the high bank. The animal stepped proudly, and manifested some symptoms of restiveness, cur- " vetting in such a style as to elicit a/sharp reprimand from the man who bestrode him. i       *        i         .            ...   156       COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. "Go 'on, you fool!" he said, angrily. It seemed that a pripk of the spur or a cut from a whip followed, for the mettled creature gave a forward spring and a neigh of pain or Viciousness. The human' brute was Booker, Colonel Floyd's confidential agent. He was look- ing right ahead, and was, moreover, too busy with his ill- mannered steed to notice her. She was glad of this, for his intolerable surveillance, and reports based upon it, were not confined to the cases of his fellow-servants, as Mrs. Floyd, his nominal mistress, had occasionally learned to her sorrow, after having covertly transgressed some of the by-laws her lord -had seen fit, in his sovereign pleasure, to enact for the government of the household. Helen disliked the man with a heartiness she took no pains to dissemble, and, crafty as he was, he had contrived to express to her, at seasonable op- portunities, his reciprocation of the antipathy. It was very fortunate that he had not descried her, hiding like a lost or fugitive thing in that out-of-the-way spot, where no othe-r lady of the family or region would ever think of coming. Her guardian would otherwise have been supplied witRta subject for sneering ridicule which he would have improved to the utmost advantage, and whenever she least desired its introduction. She waited, therefore, where she was, until there was no longer any danger of encountering the spy in his forest-beat, or of falling in with one she cared still less to face, Colonel Floyd. Like: hunter and hound, they were seldom. far apart in their liusiness rounds, by day or by night.          l Stiff and chill, from having sat for such a length'of time upon the ground, she arose with difficulty, climbed the pre- cipitous side Of the ravine; listened for a moment, to make sure that the way was clear, and set out for home. .VaWhen free of the woods, she was surprised to see that the sun had passed the meridian. Mrs. Floyd, like Miss Ruth, had or. ;    COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.      1 dered an early dinner, and Helen was not so careless of wha gossiping tongues might say, as wilfully to provoke the hubbub of inquiries and teasing observations to which she would be subjected, should she be missing from the tabl and the house when the rest were summoned to that repast She found Gabriel at the spring, leisurely filling- a pai with a gourd. "' Is dinner nearly ready?" she asked. He jumped up, letting go the gourd, and it splashed bacl into the spring. Oh, is dat you, liss Helen? How you skeered me!" She repeated her question. "No, ma'am, not as I knows on; leastways, marster ain't come home, nohow!" He raised the pail to his head in a mighty hurry, and began his journey up the acclivity towards the house. "Has anybody called to see me since I went out?'" Helen quickened her pace to overtake him. N "No, ma'am," walking yet faster.  "And' no letter or message sent that you have heard of?" "None as I've heerd on, ma'am!' puffing onwards, the water dashing in great streams from the brimming' vessel, down upon his shoulders and sooty physiognomy. "There is-no need of such-,haste, Gabriel!" said Helen, smiling,in spite of her heavy hearat this ostentatious celerity in one who had the reputation:of:being the laziest fellow on the place. "I may not have another opportunity of speak- ing -with you alone."  Gabriel was almost running now, but she kept up with hhn. hiln. "I want to tell you how sorry poor Sally is for her un. kindness to you 'this -morning, and how much Hblame her for it.. She is disposed to be hasty, but she is a good-hearted '    '    158      COLONEL FLOYD7S WADS. girl, -and likes you. I do not want you to bear a grudge against her or me when we are gone. You have done me many friendly turns, for which I shall always/ be thankful, and if at any time I can bc of service to you, you must not be afraid to apply to me. Oh! Gabriel! stop! I am out of breath!" Thus adjured, the hurrying Aquarius stood still in his tracks; but, instead of facing her in respectful attention, he made a feint at digging out his eyes with his wet knuckles, and bur;st out crying. "Wby, my boy! what ails you?P" inquired the young lady, in amazement. "Are you sorry that I am going away?" "No-o-o, ma-a-a-m!" "Indeed! I had hoped that you were!" returned Helen, laughingly. "What, then, is the matter?" "I don't mean I ain't sorry! Boo-hoo!" Rivulets of salt water mixed themselves with the fresh upon his shining cheeks. "You scoundrel! what are you fooling there about;?" roared a voice from the houseyard, now only some twenty feet distant. "My gracious! if thar ain't marster!" exclaimed the frightened boy, and he resumed his labored flight along the path, breathless under his burden, and palpitating with fear. He ivas not disappointed in the reception he met. Colo- nel Floyd waited for him at the gate; bestowed a curse and several blows of his riding-whip upon him as he passed through; then glowered at his wife's niece, as if anathema- tizing the accident of sex that prevented him from saluting her im like manner. "So, my young lady, this is the company you select upon your wedding-day!" he snarled. "I hope his conversation has edified you!" * ,       ,  -   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       159 Without deigning a reply, she trod past him with her queen-likej elastic step; not hurriedly, but as if she had not seen or heard him. j "You still expect your gallant to-night, do you?" he fol- t    lowed her to say. "Are you speaking to me, or to Gabriel, Colonel Floyd?" she interrogated, casting a side ray of supreme disdain at him.             A His complexion had a purplish flush; his eyes a wild, un- settled glare; his articulation was thick and tremulous. HHe has been drinking!" thought his ward, in disgust. "I may steel myself for any amount of insult." "I am talking to you!  You are hoping to welcome your devoted in season for the ceremony,. are you?" "If you mean Mr. Lay, I expect him, certainly!" walk- ing on.           I "He was in nothaste to procure his license," her tormen- tor continued, still at her heels.  I waited for him a good hour and a half." "You will oblige me, Colonel Floyd, by never opening your lips to me again with respect to the matter officiously brought forward by you last night!" returned Helen, con- fronting him courageously, and speaking with authority. "I wish you to understand distinctly, now and forever, that there is a  complete understanding between Mr. Lay and myself, upon this and every other subject. Your interfe- rence is impertinent and unwelcome. -  I trust that I have i made my meaning sufficiently intelligible. Mr. Lay is com- petent to the management of his own affairs and mine also." She went into the house, without staying to-witness the effect of her declaration of independence. Virginia Shore assailed her in the lower hall. "Helen Gardner! you strange, mysterious, provoking gh-l! where in the name of common' sense, and every thing   COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS. else that is reasonable, have you been traipsing to? Here is the day two-thirds gone, and not an individual thing done. And don'tyou think? something or somebody upset Lily's elegant orange-tree last night,'and snapped ever so many of the finest branches; so we girls have been busy gathering the flowers from them, and putting them in water'; and isn't it a mercy they were so little withered, and are reviving beautifully; and we find there are enoug to distribute among all seven bouquets, unless you are bent upon having yours composed altogether of orange-blossoms, which isn't in the least necessary, it seems to me, for there are white rosebuds, and candy-tuft, and feather-few, and a lovely camelia, if you must have all white flowers, as I sup- pose you will, and geraniums and arbor-vitae for greens; then, too, I am certain that Mr. Lay will send your bouquet from Greenfield; he hinted something of the kind to me,- and, would you believe it? there's Lilyogpne to bed with a bad sick headache-she always picks the most inconvenient season to have them! and won't let a soul of us come near her room, and Mrs. Floyd is afraid she won't be able to be down to-night; says she has fever and all that; and in that case, what will you do for a first bridesmaid? Deal me! what unlucky things do happen at weddings some times!" This breathless string of talk was rattled out while pursu- ing Helen up-stairs to the chamber of the latter, where Miss Shore threw herself into a chair and declared that she was "fagged out--half-dead, in fact!" "I am sorry to hear that Lily is sick!" was Relen's reply, while Sally divested her of her cloak and, walking-shoes. "She appeared quite well at breakfast-time, I thought. I am afraid that she has over-exerted herself." "Between you and me, she has fretted herself sick-if she is sick-about the accident in the green-house-if it was an   accident!" said Virginia, knowingly. " You never saw such a look as went over her face when she heard-of it. I found it out just after you took such very cool French leave of us. I was hunting high and low for you, and peeped into the green-house, among other places, and there lay the stand, pot and all, upon the floor! So I tore off up-stairs to tell the news. I really thought that Lily whas going to strike me, at first! She grew paler than a corpse, and her eyes blazed like lightning, I can tell you I She caught her breath, like one strangling, when I tried to pacify her by saying that no doubt the mischief-was done unintentionally, in the dark, by a dog, or one of the servants. "'No!' she said, in a sort of choked whisper; 'I know all about it! It was not an accident! I will be revenged for that piece of spite, if I die for it!' "'Why, Lily,' I said, 'how unkind and unreasonable F But she would not listen-only took herself off to her room and bed, and there she has been ever since! Who would believe that she could be so peppery a little vixen when she is once aroused?" Helen thought sadly and deeply for several moments upon what she had heard. In the pressure of anxieties personally so much more momentous, the damage done her cousin's pet shrub had entirely escaped her mind, until it was recalled by Virginia's narrative. If Lily were indeed so distressed at the disaster as her volatile friend represented, she might be conciliated by a truthful statement of the manner in which the misadventure occurred, and Helen's regret at having been innocently the cause of it. As 'a preliminary step, she despatched Sally to Lily's room to inquire how her headache'was, and request the privilege of an audience for her mistress. The tiring-woman returned in high dudgeon. "The door is locked on the inside, Miss Helen, and when   i62 j      COLONEL FLOYDBS WARDS. I knocked, that impudent Sylvy opened it a little ways, and peeped through the crack, and had the assurance to tell me that Miss Lily had just fallen asleep, and mustn't be waked on no account. Then she shut too the door again, and I heard her with my own blessed ears speak to Miss Lily kinder easy-like, and Miss Lily answer, her. Asleep-ha? Humph 1" "There! thlat will do!" Helen arrested her indignant volubility, and congratulated herself that Virginia had flitted off to some other part of the house before this item could be added'to her budget of scandal. She did not censure Lily for averting an claircissement that would be productive of embarrassment to them both; and, moreover, it would be of no avail now. Her destiny, and, so far as a strange fatality had intertwined Lily's with it, hers, also, were no longer in her hands. Robert's laconic, but significant message, and his non-appearance, had settled that matter. The afternoon wore away all too rapidly to the idle, taci- turn bride, as to the fussy, excited bridesmaids, and another starlight evening, as cloudless and colder than yesterday's, came on. The marriage service was to be recited at eight o'clock, which, in the accommodating phraseology and ac- cording to the pliant customs of that region, meant any time from half-past eight to ten. The more unpunctual a bridal procession contrived to be, the more aristocratic were te  performances esteemed. Nevertheless, it six o'clock Helen cleared her apartment of the chattering, officious sisterhood, who clamored for the honor of assisting at her toilette, re- jccting sheir overtures kindly, yet peremptorily; fastened the door upon the last of the reluctant exiles, who was, of course, Virginia Shore, and sat herself down before the mir- ror to have her hair dressed by Sally's skilful fingers. The maid's manipulations upon the luxuriant locks were con- I *' ;      \   COLONEL LOYS    WARDS.     163 ducted silently. If her -heart had not been too full for use- less speech, a glance at the grave, settled features, so young in outline and color, so old in expressions which were re- flected in the glass, would have sealed her riouth. She comprehended, in some dim and imperfect fashion, -that her mistress did not go to her bridal as most other women she had seen arrayed for their nuptials had done; that there was no tremulous joy, no excess of happiness, in the suppressed sighs that, ever and anon, heaved her breast; no delicious dreaming in the thoughtful eyes, that seemed to study the untried Future. The glossy hair was wound smoothly around the classic head, braided and looped at the back, and Sally was obliged to speak. "You will not have the flowers put in just yet, will you, Miss Helen? They will droop and wither before you are ready to go down."  Helen aroused herself and glanced at the white buds with their graceful group of leaves, simply beautiful, in spite of Virginia's abuse. They awaited her pleasure in a small vase upon the dressing-table. "They will! you are right. Perhaps I may not wear them, after all. We will attend to that by and by." "The young ladies all seemed to admire the pearls most," suggested Sally, timidly. "And don't you think, Miss Helen, that Mars' Aleck--" Hlen raised her hand with a frown. "Not a word more, Sally! When I am at a loss what to do, I shall ask other people's advice, not before." ' Further debate was prevented by a knock at the door. "What do you want?" said Sally, snappishy, unlocking it, and, in unthinking imitation of her favorite detestation, Sylvia, opening it far enough to allow the tip of her nose to be seen by the person without. A.        v   - 164     COLONQEL FLOYDS WARDS. The reply was in the voice of an under housemaid, whom the brisk Sally was wont to denominate a "stupid, no: account body, who went through the world with her eyes and ears shut."       "Mr. Lay down sta'rs. Want to see Miss Helen, d'rectly, if she can come down. He won't keep her more'n a minute, he say. He in de office." "The office! what did you show him in there for, you goose?

"I No-he-went away somewhar', 'pon horseback-he an' Uncle Booker, nigh 'pon half an hour ago. Dey ain't got home yet." While this colloquy was going on, Helen had thrown off her white wrapper, and, with the utmost haste her shaking fingers permitted her to use, put. on, in its stead, a crimson dressing-gown-part of her bridal outfit-which had been hung over a chair near by. "Let me pass!" she said, trying to knot the massive cord around her waist as she spoke.

Aleck brought the candle and held it behind her shoulder while she de- ciphered it.  "Aleck-old boy! you will never let me call you brother again' after you have read this, but it can't be helped! You have done you duty towards me, and the hardest struggle I have had in making up my mind was to conquer my fear of your displeasure. My resolution is taken! It was naild fast to the mast by the perusal of the enclosed, which you saw delivered to me this morning. The last feather breaks the camel's back, and my feather was not a light one, as you will see. You will agree with me-or ought to -when you have studied this specimen of feminine com- position-in the opinion that she who could write thus on the morning of her marriage-day was never designed by the Maker of matches to be my wife-never desired to be! She says, in effect: 'Be free if you long for freedom! Be happy with another if you love her better than you do me -and I am resigned-rather relieved, if the truth must be told!' "I take her at her word. The direction of my flight I cannot reveal at present, for obvious reasons. There are hot-brained fellows-Harvey Floyd, for example-who would not scruple to chase me down, and pistol me for the slight offered the bride-that-is-not-to-be.

Perhaps the easiest and safest way for you to accomplish this disagreeable but nees- sary business will be to forward her letter with this to Colonle Floyd.

Yet I have seen very much that I considered reprehensible in his intercourse with Lily Calvert; have warned him, once and again, of the evil which might result from the intimacy. He had always already excuse or evasion wherewith to ward off my attack-and I believed him! He was wickedly weak-she, subtle--I, blind! This is the end!" "It is!"Helen arose, erect and calm. "I thank you for the gentleness-the true brotherly kindness with which you have discharged a trust that could not but be abhorrent to you. I am especially grateful that you did not accept the alternative of transferring the unpleasant duty to Colonel Floyd." "I did not entertain the suggestion for an instant. Here is your letter. You notice that he-Robert, I mean-says that it was sent for my perusal. I need not assure you that I have not read a line of it." "I wish you had!" she said, impulsively-then, checking herself),a new flood of crimson bathed her face. She had recollected the confession embodied in the earlier portion of it: "That is"-she resumed, more composedly-"I would like to have you read certain parts. You would then see how faithfully I have striven to be guiltless in this matter; whatever may-be my faults, and they are many, I am not habitually insincere. Will you oblige me?" She proffered the open sheet, designating the top of the second page as the place where he should begin. "I require no testimony beyond what I already have to convince me that your conduct in this lamentable affair has been irreproachable," replied Aleck, repelling the offer by a gesture. "But I would have you acquit me intelligently. When   the tale is trumpeted abroad-as it must be"--her lips were whiter in saying this--" as it must be, very soon, it will be a great satisfaction, the best comfort I can have, to know that there is one who, with a full knowledge of the easei from beginning to end, yet pronounces that I have tried, and tried hard, to do my duty; that I would have shielded Robert from reproach at the same time that I secured his happiness by a union with the woman he loed--for-I was sure that he did love Lily!)-have spared him  the trouble of this flight, and myself the ignominy of being publicly rejected!" She turned her head aside, too proud to let him see how keen was the smart of the last thought, and still extended the letter in mute appeal. Aleck unclosed his lips to speak, then, changing his mind, took the paper with a bow of submission to her require- ment. "Robert! I charge you by every principle of truth, honor, 'and manliness, to answer me one question " This was the heading of the paragraph to which she pointed, and he read the letter through, from that adjura- tion to the close; with what sensations of pain, love pity, and marvel, his countenance, varied and marked as were the expressions that succeeded one another upon it, but feebly indicated. "And this generosity he spurned! this angelic candor, this noble self-renunciation he could despise! could' epeak slightingly of conduct that should have moved him to wore ship!" broke forth Aleck, impetuously. "Helen.! I catnot ask you to pardon him. The man who could sin thus grossly against the love and forbearance you have exhibited towards him, merits your scorn and the reprobation of fihe world!"       -          .  - "Hush! hush!

Only"-the childlike,- troubled look that he had seen before, when she alluded to the public scandal men. acing her, came back-" will it be asking too great a favor of yourself and your aunt, if I tell you "that it will be an inestimable help to me to have you remain here this even- ing, and show that- is friends are still mine? that they, having known me from my childhood, do not cast me off as an - unworthy creature, whose heartlessness has forfeited their confidence? For you must recollect that the people who were invited to the-the wedding, will come; that there is not time to send word to a single ,one of them. The invitations cannot be countermanded, and I must see them I the story must be told! He quotes correctly, you observe, when he alludes to my boast of 'daring and self- possession.' Had the event been what I proposed, and for a time expected, I think that he would have found these sufficient for his purpose and mine. As it is, the trial will be far greater!" She faltered. Helen!" . She did not repulse him when he took her hand again. In this dark hour of mortification and perplexity, she had no other adviser; no other friend or comforter; and his tenderness of sympathy was inexpressibly sweet. "Before I answer your question, let me entreat your in- dulgence while I unfold my plan of action; that which I conceived and matured while coming to you td-night. It is a kindred'idea to that which I find. sketched in your letter, recommended by you for another's adoption. The coinci- dence is an encouragement to me to proceed.. Will you bear with me if it offends you? You will not shrink from me in horror and loathing?" "Certainly not l"   She gazed at him in unsuspecting wonderment. Ihe earnestness of his imploring tone; the anxiety with which he hung upon her look and reply, were more of a mystery than his words. Seeing that he hesitated to go on, she added gently, almost affectionately, "Whatever may be my opinion as to the propriety of adopting and acting upon this unknown 'plan,' I should be unjust and unkind were I to' resent your goodness in presenting it. I have known you too well and too long to impute to you unworthy mo- tives. You could not propose any thing that would involve  the sacrifice of truth or honor, however distasteful its terms might be to me." "Ah! there is the fear!"He groaned in bowing his head upon his hands. She laid one of hers on his arm. "Aleck! will you not be frank with me? Is this a time for mistaken delicacy-false scruples? This should be an honest hour with us both. Will you not tell me what it is that you desire to say? It is your old friend and play- fellow, Helen, who asks this of you?" "I twill be a man! will brave every thing!"He started from his dejected attitude. "At the risk of debasing my- self in your eyes to the level of a selfish, unfeeling monster, who would take advantage of your distress to win his own ends, I will speak! Helen! I have loved you all my life!- loved you more than I ever have done any thing -else on earth! I thought I had made you understand the nature; and aim of this affection before I went abroad. Fervent as was my devotion, I had yet the manliness and justice not to bind you by a formal pledge. While absent, I dared to think and dream of you as my own-mine only ;-to antici- pate a future spent with you as a fair and probable prospect. I returned to find you betrothed to my brother. What I suffered; what I have resigned; what concealed under what   174      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. must- hare seemed to you a heartless and repulsive exterior, I have not strength or time to tell you now. I do not offer ,my love-unabated and unconquerable, after all my bat- tlings with it--as a solace for the pain inflicted by the de- sertion of your betrothed. But I do tender you my name and my hand as a shield against calumny and insult; ask the privilege of protecting you in this hour of isolation and perplexity. I exact nothing in return save that which you -have but this moment informed me is already mine, your v friendship and confidence. If you will marry me to-night as my brother's substitute, I pledge you my solemn word that no unreasonable or ungenerous demands on my part shall ever cause you to regret the act." He delivered this extraordinary proposal in a hard, almost fiercely abrupt fashion; the result of overpowering emotion he tried ineffectually to suppress into the collected, moderato show of earnestness he had resolved on. He did not look at her as he brought the speech to a close. Would she flee his presence as from a moral leper? Would she strike him dead with imperial scorn? For a whole minute there was a profound stillness through- out the room, except for the quick fluttering pants from the figure at his side, Had his audacity taken from her, the power of utterance? Then she spoke-very softly, very musically to his excited senses, that had shrunk in dread of accents so different. - "I thought that you were betrothed to a lady in Ger- many. They.--your aunt and brother-told me so-last summer!" Aleck made an impatient movement. "That absurd fiction again'! I hever loved her-never thought of betrothal to any woman besides yourself; have never breathed a word of affection to any other, at home ol abroad. The letter from which my aunt deduced her preo   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       175 posterous conclusion Was, as anybody but herself could have seen, a foolish, barefaced hoax, from beginning to end. I have told her this since my return, and undeceived Robert also. Could I be so base as to offer you a hand upon which another had a lien?" Still he did not look towards her. If he had, he must have been at a loss how to interpret the warmer blush that slowly mantled her cheek; the fervid, yet tender sparkle of the eye. She reopened the letter to Robert. He heard the rustle, in wondering impatience. What had they to do with that part of the question, now? "I cannot give you a reply until you have read the first -page of this." She could hardly have epjoined a more irksome task; but A he obeyed iher behest instantly and without a remonstrance. His mind was not in'a condition to be easily receptive of hope, or he might have drawn all the encouragement the most ardent suitor could have desired from the cautiously- worded confession; would not have looked'or spoken with such mournful firmness, as he ceased reading.  "I do not love you- more hopelessly now than I have done from the moment I heard of your-engagement to my brother. You say in this letter that a union with him whom you first loved is forever impossible; that you have only half a heart to bestow upon any man who shall here- after seek your favor. If I am personally disagreeable to you; if my presence will annoy or displease you, instead of being a comfort, I withdraw my suit. Otherwise--unless, indeed, I can bring about a reunion between yourself and your early love-" "You do not ask who it was?" "Nor ever shall! It is your secret-yours alone 1" "But what if I'insist upan telling you?"-   *76      COLONEL FLOYD'S WADS.  He gazed upon her now, but in unspeakable amaze. What was the meaning of the playful, yet shy intonation, that im- pressed even his infidel perceptions; incredulous to what- ever seemed to bode happiness and success to himself? Stranger still, she smiled in his bewildered face, a- smile radiant as heaven's own light. "We have both 'played too long with edge tools dear Aleck? Suppose we abandon the dangerous triflin  and take to truth-telling for the remainder of our lives! will set the example, by revealing to you the I dear; fatal-name of him who long ago gained my whole, undivided heart; whose supposed desertion drove me to the mad, wicked step of engaging myself to another. Shall I?" "If you will!" He articulated the monosyllables with difficulty in the tumult that possessed his soul. ' "Bow your tall head, then. I cannot say it aloud." Still mystified, doubting, fearing-any thing but hoping, he bent his head to her lips. They breathed one word in his ear. Had Colonel Floyd, or his devoted servitor and imitator, Booker, chanced to pass through this retired:portion of the grounds just then, upon .his nightly patrol, and glanced in- to the low window, he would have beheld an unexpected and highly interesting scene; one which nmight possibly have awalkened sensations the reverse of delightful in the bosom of the, unseen spy. Bat it happened instead, that this select and exemplary body of police was, at that important instant, engaged about other business, the nature of which shall be briefly explained in the next chapter. .   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       1" CHAPTER XI. SALLY "had the fidgets"--a description of fit that became more violent with every added minute of her mistress's ab- sence. In the adjacent chamber, dedicated to the toilette services of three of the six bridesmaids, she could hear the confused clamor of busy tongues, the patter of slippered feet, and frequent outhursts of such mutual admiration as girls are prone to indulge to their own and one another's delectation, all denoting the forward march of preparations for the great event of the evening. Bells were rung from divers other apartments, upon first, second, and third sto- ries; there was continual rushing up and down stairs, and thiough entries, of valets, butlers, and ladies' maids, each on the run, and all equally regardless of the danger of collisions; already .several carriages had rolled around the drive in front of the ihansion, and discharged their freight of unne& cessarily punctual revellers, mostly relatives -and intimate friends of the family, who liked to preface the" public pro- ceedings by a little social talk. Yet she, in whose honor all this commotion was raised, the star actress ofthe promised performance, without whom the play -would, in fact, be a rer ediless wreck, and a disgrace to all concerned in its an- nouncement and management, was still dallying away the fleeting, priceless moments in love-talk, that could be as well if not better attended to after the ceremony. "There is a season for every thing!" muttered the tiring- woman, distractedly, shaking. out the satin robe and lace i           A,       o     178      COLONEL 'FLOYD'S WARDS. veil for the twentieth time. "And this isn't the tlme for no such boy-and-girl play as they're carrying on!" Sally was in love herself, and, as a consequence, extremely lenient to the delinquencies of others similarly situated, if said derelictions had Cupid's warrant for their apology; but there was a point beyond which delay became inexcusable negligence, and this she considered, and, it must be owned, with just provocation, that the bride was fast nearing. She went into the hall repeatedly, and listened over the balus- trades for the returning feet of her charge-the increasing tumult of arrival and reception below, meanwhile, aggrava.  ting her inquietude to the verge of frenzy; once she 9tole down-stairs, and into the dark passage conducting to the - 5! office-door-went near enough to that uninviting room, now consecrated as the chosen retreat of Love, to hear the low  i murmur of earnest voices; finally, she resolved to sit down n in desperate resignation by the fire in the bridal chamber, 3 and "not budge one single inch again until Miss Helen saw fit to show herself--no! not if she had to wait there until midnight '!"  Her waiting, albeit it was the reverse of " patient," had ?; its rewardc shortly after she had taken this sensible resolu. I tion. :A light footstep her ears were quick to recognize   I skimmed the floor of the hall, stopped at the door, and the long-looked for personage appeared.  "Sally, my good child! I have kept you waiting a tedious  time, I suppose, but there is no haste, none whatever!"   g "It's a quarter past seven!" responded -Sally, not too ' amiably.                ' Generally the most docile and respectful of handmaidens, - she yet availed herself occasionally of the privilege, earned, : by years of faithful service, to'lecture her young mistress. "I know that, Jbut the-ceremony will not take place for an hour or more."                         COLONEL FLOYD'B WAgDS.       179 She had sunk into the chair before the mirror, anda spoke breathlessly. This might have been the effect of her haste in climbing the stairs, and her rapid flight through the pas- sages, to avoidbeing seen abroad at this unseasonable hour,- but the sparkling eyes and glowing complexion could hard- ly have been induced by these influences. Resting her chin in her palm, and her elbow upon the dressing-table, she remained for some minutes, apparently lost in revery, fond, yet agitating. Her lip trembled while it smiled; the fire  in the eye shone Ithrough a soft haze;-even to Sally's un- tutored sight, her aspect was refined and elevated by the emotions that rapt her in silent happiness. Then, a change which was even more lovely grew upon her ;-a chastened gravity, that mellowed every feature; an upward glance told that thought was rising to yet more exalted themes of contemplation. She turned kindly to her attendant. "Sally! I should like to be alone for a little while. Do not be uneasy. I will be ready in season." "Just as you say, ma'am." Unwilling to submit to further procrastination of the momentous business yet to be performed, but awed into implicit obedience of action by her mistress's look and manner, the maid withdrew. Helen's chamber was upon the second floor of the main building, which formed the central pile of the large and irregularly constructed old homestead; and access was had to this, not only by the wide front staircase, but also by a steeper winding fight, leading down to the back door.  Sally was near the head of these, on the alert for the sum- mons to her post of duty, when her attention was dis-, truated by the rumble of wheels. This was now a frequent, almost an incessant sound, but the vehicle to which these  eloged drove around the right wing of the house, where   there was no carriageway over the lawn, and stopped at the rear porch. The listener stretched her head over the railing, with the curiosity characteristic of her class, to ob- tain a view of, the back entrance. What or who was to be introduced into the mansion at such a time, and in this unu- sual way'? .'      . Colonel Floyd pushed the door open from without. iHe was arrayed in overcoat and hat, and carried in one hand' his inevitable riding-whip. The other grasped, and, it would seem, not very tenderly, the arm of a lady, muffled in a large cloak and drooping hood. Good Fathers, Miss Lily!" ejaculated the astonished Sally, under her breath. "I thought she was sick in bed!" Behind the supposed invalid cowered the confidential abigail, Sylvia. She bore a bandbox in her arms, and her mulatto 'complexion was the hue of ashes with fear. The group was completed by her husband, the family coachman, who brought in a small travelling-trunk, apparently from the conveyance standing without. . "Up! that way!"The colonel thrust Lily upon the lower stair. "And you had better rig yourself in your finery in double-quick time, or I will be along to hurry your smart waiting-maid, here!"He lent Sylvia a cut across the shoul- ders with' his whip, by way of further admonition. - "I fatl- ter myself that I have spoilt your fun for this night; and the next time you undertake an elopement, look out that I amnodt at your heels. Leave that trunk there, you scoun- drel!" pointing to a corner of the entry. "I take it for granted that there is no bridesmaid gear in that, and she has changed ler mind about playing bride, for the present."  Idly had now gained the top, of the steps, leasing heavily upon her maid, and Sally:had retreated to a dark corner, not too distant to prevent her 'from seeing and hearing all that transpired. Finding that her uncle had not ascended be- 4F  }   COLONEL FLOYDPS WARDS.       181 hind her, the poor fugitive stopped, and fell back, rather than rested, against the wall; as one half dead with fatigue or fright.    . Sylvia urged her, in a frightened whisper, to go on to her chamber. "I cannot yet! I am so faint!" sobbed the trembling girl, pressing her hand to her heart. "What will become of me? Oh! what shall we do?" Low as were her accents, the sound reached the savage warder below. "Are you there still?" He came part of the way up to catch sight of the laggards. "If you want more of my help, you have only to say so, and it is at your service." The terrified women hurried down a side passage in the direction of Lily's room, and at that instant Sally heard her mistress's bell, and made good her escape. Helen's pre-occupation of mind prevented her from remark- ing the queer looks and behavior of her assistant. Apart from the revolution in her position and feelings, there was much that required her most serious meditation; an impera- tive necessity for self-command, and ingenuity of speech and conduct. The Court House-the universal name applied to the shire-town of each county in the Southern States--was bat three miles from Belleview, and the county clerk, to whom application must be made for a marriage license, resi- ded near his office in that village. There would be no diffi- culty in obtaining this, both the parties to the contract being of age; yet Aleck had deemed it best to take into his confl denc-e and secure as his companion in his nocturnal gallop, Harvey Floyd, a second cousin of the colonel's, and disttntly related to Helen herself. He was a merry rattle of a fellow, ind-hearted as quick-witted, and was to have officiated as second groomsman, according' to the original arrangement of the bridal train. i   1 82-.  .  COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. This gentleman, on being, summonedi from his dress g. room to receive the astounding news of a change of br de grooms, " sOpposed," when the shock of the communica ion had passed off, "that-it was all right-indeed, it was a c qpi- tal joke-the - boldest and cleverest thing he had ever heard of-this having hoaxed a whole community, the wedding party included-up to the very last moment! He would' relish amazingly carrying out the matter in good style. A splendid Christmas trick!" and he laughed until the moidy walls of the office threatened to come down about his ears.  This was after Helen had left the two young meni to- gether; but she conjectured that his co-operation asa obtained without much difficulty, from the fact that fhe heard the clatter of their horses' hoofs down the road in less than ten minutes from her time of parting from them. Harvey was to ride directly back to Belleview, so soon as the license was granted; Aleck would return by way of Greenfield, and bring Miss Ruth with him. Let them use what speed and diligence they might, there would still be a delay of considerable length in the solenmizsation of the marriage, and "this it was Helen's object to make as little noticeable as possible. By way of beginning, she must con- fide that to Sally which no one else-not the bridesmaids themselves-was to learn until the final moment. She was explicit, but brief, in' her narrative to the petrified tire woman. She-Helen Gardener-w  as to marry Mr. Alexan der Lay, and not his brother, as was commonly supposed, -but the secret was not to be divulged as yet to any other person., Least of all must Colonel Floyd, or any member of his family, receive the slightest intimation that could lead to the discovery of the plot. Certain preparations would detain Mr. Lay for an hour, perhaps more, beyond the time set for the marriage, and, to escape unpleasant comments   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       183 upon his tardiness', the bride's toilette must not be complete until nearly nine o'clock. It appeared doubtful, for awhile, whether Sally would ever be equal to the functions of her office,-so staggered was she by the intelligence, coming as it did, before she had entirely rallied fromn the effect produced by the dis- covery of Lily's escapade and capture. Helen laughed merrily at her bewilderment-so heartily, that Sally smiled in real pleasure. "I have not heard- you give a laugh like that in ever so many months, Miss Helen. It does my heart good to hear it; it sounds so like old times!" "I have not been so happy for a long time, Sally. There have been painful misunderstandings that are now cleared away," was the response, sincere and simple. She never imparted to any one else a more circumstantial account of the dark days of her life, and the sudden burst of sunshine following them. Below, the apartments appropriated to the use of the company were filling-fast; and until some officious individual had the bad taste to discover, and was guilty of the ill behavior of promulgating the intelligence, that it wanted a quarter of nine o'clock, and no bridegroom had yet arrived, every thing went blithely enough. Colonel Floyd was a conspicuous figure in the sight of every one that entered. He was dressed with extreme neatness and eligance, and his commanding stature, and stately grace -of bearing, re- called to many of the elder guests-the memory of his most palmy days, when no other resident of the region could vie with him in manly beauty and deportment.   He had deteriorated since, and, by his evil courses, had latterly lost much of the prestige given him by this earlier reputation, and his family rank; but, to-night, he upheld the dignity of the Floyd escutcheon in a style that constrained his   184      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. worst enemies to admiration. Mrs. Floyd was a cipher, according to custom; but she did her besi to receive her friends cordially and entertain them hospitably, and there were few who were so destitute of right feeling as to be wanting in appreciation of her motives. At a quarter toinine, then, an uAmannerly buzz went his- sing, like a serpent, through ihe crowd, leaving in its track dismayed silence, glances of alarmed inquiry, nods and winks of malicious meaning. The knowing and observant ones began to notice the fluctuations of the host's florid complexion from purple to pallor; thatfhis face was lowering and his eye gleamed ominously as he conferred apart with his wife; and that she, poor soul, looked amazed and dis. quieted, and could not prevent her regards from straying every instant to the door. At nine o'clock, without any pretence of apology or show of concealment, Colonel Floyd left the apartment,-it was conjectured, to institute official inquiry into the cause of the mysterious and most ungallant non-appearance of the person who should have been one of the earliest upon the ground. No sooner was this plausible supposition reached by a majority of the assembly than there was a general and palpable effort to seem lively and unconcerned,-a commendable and ostentatious display of ignorance that any thing was wrong which deluded no one, failed to impose upon the most single minded creature there, and that was unquestionably the lady of the house. Colonel Floyd crossed the hall and entered a small cloak- room, occupied, for the nonce, by four very stiff and uneasy gentlemen-the groomsmen--who -awaited the signal to join their fair mates and take up the line of wedding march. - ".This is a very strange affair, gentlemen!" said the colo- nel, gravely, " and it is my painful duty to inquire into it, without further delay. It may have been a mistaken delli   COLONEL FLOYDS WARBD.       185 - cacy which has kept me silent so long. Has any one of you seen or heard from Mr. Lay to-day?" Every man looked at his fellow, and there was nar-inan^ mous shaking of heads.   i  "He called on me at noon yesterday, and engaged to meet me at the clerk's office this morning at eleven o'clock," putr sued the colonel, visibly moved by some powerful emotion. "This engagement he saw fit to neglect. I waited for him until past twelve, and since my presence there was not a le. gal necessity, obeyed the call of other duties, and returned home. Since then--" He was interrupted by the entrance of his relative, Har- vey Floyd. "Well, boys!" said the new arrival, gayly, "how goes it with you by this time? Tired of waiting-hey?" 'They may well be!" returned the colonel, indignantly. "What have you to say, Harvey, respecting this very dila- tory groom? The business begins to look very black to us. He is a particular friend of yours, I believe. Are you the bearer of his excuses?" "(Well, not that exactly, sir, but I can answer for him that he will be here pretty soon, sure as a gun!" thrusting his hands into his pockets andc strolling to the window, where he commenced a careless whistle, that suddenly, and without apparent cause, exploded into a laugh. All were startled, several shocked by the sound. "Beg pardon, colonel! Excuse me, gentlemen, iut the truth is, you four look so like pall-bearers. at a funeral, and my respected cousin there so like chief undertaker, sextoni and parson combined, that I cannot keep my countenance. Haw, haw!" He dug his hands down deeper into his pockets, and stamped about the room, rolling and choking with merri. ment.   186^V COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. "There are some subjects, young man, that are not to be jested upon " rejoined the colonel, his brow blackening with suppressed wrath, while the veins in his temples stood out like cords. "No offence intended, sir!" Harvey tried manfully to swallow his amusement. "Only, when a man goes to a wedding, it does seem ludicrous to see every one else behave as if it were a funeral. Actually, astranger would fell dis- posed to look for crape upon the left arm of each of this lu- gubrious quartette, and to listen for your official pronuncia. tion of 'dust to dust, ashes to ashes.'" "When you can express yourself in a manner becoming your position as a member of the respectable family so grossly insulted by the conduct of your associate, the ex- pected bridegroom-expected, rather than expectant, it ap- pears--I should like to talk with you upon this very un- pleasant matter," said the colonel, with increasing choler. He walked out with immense stiffness. The door opening upon the back porch, the same through which he had con- ducted Lily upon her return from her evening jaunt, stood ajar, and the aperture was filled by a dusky figure. "I would like to speak to you, sir!" it said, in a guarded voice,'as Colonel Floyd crossed the hall. The master started as if the word were a bullet. "What is it?" he asked, hastily. Booker retired into the portico, whither the colonel fol- lowed him, shutting the door after them. "The moon will be up before we get there," said the man, in the same cautious key. "It's time we were off." "Had we not better wait until the moon does rise? It wilP be a  dark, rough walk," suggested Colonel Floyd, staring upward at the starry heavens. His manner was -less that of the arbitrary owner than the equal of the one he addressed. But for the absurdity of the   COLONEL ULOYD S WARDS.     '- 1 idea, one might have imagined that there lurked in his accent a certain degree of respect-of humility. The negro's reply was assuredly positive and familiar, such as few white men -would have dared to employ in conversation with the lord of Belleview. So much the better! We don't want light until we get to the woods. If you are seen quitting the house when it's full of invited company, folks will wonder at it, and there's a chance of our being followed. Then, the ground's froze hard as a rock, and the path is a rough' one, as you say, be- sides being a good mile and a half long. We will want every minute of our time. If I'd had my way, we would have been off an hour ago." ' "That could -not be, you know." Colonel Floyd mani- fested no anger at the imperative -anguage of his inferior. "It was necessary that I should show myself first to those people in the parlors, and contrive some excuse for leaving them." s"That may be so, but we ought to be off now!" repeated Booker, doggedly. "There's nothing else to be gained, and much may be lost by waiting." "Are you sure that you have every thing ready?" whisw pered the master, peering over his shoulder at the lighted windows, blazing all along the rear of the building. All's right, so far as I am concerned!' "Then I will be with you in three minutes!"  He went back into the house, and stopped in the hall to collect thoughts or courage for the next move. His face was curiously changed. A leaden hue had come over it, and he had to clinch his teeth to hinder them from chattering-- probably with cold or nervousness, for no living man had ever seen him show fear or presumed to accuse him of cow- ardice. He felt the alteration in his iooks, for he stroked his features to compose them; while his hand shook from   188,      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. the same cause that had induced the'discomposure he would conceal. First, he proceeded to the dining-room, unlocked the sideboard, and helped himself to a glass of strong brandy and water; .waited a minute to ascertain the potency of the draught, and swallowed a second. Then he again sought the presence of the uneasy groomsmen. There was a glare in his eye that looked like fierceness; and if his voice were slightly husky, and not so steady as usual, it was attributed to the same, or kindred emotions, and these were regarded as altogether natural and comrn mendable by the spectators, or by four out of the five. Har. vey may have had his own ideas upon the subject. He, of the number, seemed least concerned by the announcement that should, in consideration of his relation to the bride, have affected him most. "Gentlemen! you will oblige me by making yourselves at home in my house, and, so far as lies in your power, allay- ing the apprehensions that may have been excited in the minds of others by Mr. Lay's extraordinary and utterly in. excusable behavior. For myself," drawing himself up, and speaking hoarsely, yet dignifiedly, "I shall go in person to seek that young man-to call him to account for the dastardly slight put upon my niece. I think that I have a clue which, fright lrused, will enable me to ferret out the truth." "Better stay where you are, colonel!" interposed Harvey, in some alarm; " or, if it is necessary to make inquiries, let me go in your place. Don't be precipitate! Things may come right without your troubling yourself. Lay is an hon. orable fellow, and, if he is above ground, I am willing to wager my head that he will furnish in good season a solu. tion, and a satisfactory one, of this puzzle." "Mr. Floyd "The colonel wheeled suddenly upon him. "This is my affair, and I warn you, once for all, that I will not be interfered with! The only true kindness you oan at     COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       189 present do your cousin; Miss Gardner, is to undertake the painful office of breaking to her, as gently as you can, the unexpected news of Mr. Lay's disappearance." ("Shall I find her up-stairs, sir?" Harvey was near rupturing a blood-vessel in his frantic attempt to repress another uproarious fit of- mirth. "I presume that she has not yet left her- room."  "Then I'll run right up!" said the willing bearer of the afflicting intelligence.        % He went up the steps, three at a leap, as the colonel sol- emnly bowed around to the bewildered quartette, and left the house by the back door. It was Sally's luck, this evening, to play the undesigning eaves-dropper. While Colonel Floyd and Booker held their cautious colloquy upon the porch, she was within ear-shot of most that was said. She had been to the kitchen upon some trifling errand, and was on her way back to Helen's room, when she espied Booker peeping in at the hall door, either watching or waiting for some one within. Sally in- stantly crouched, like a hare upon her form, and, inch by inch, crept under the portico steps,-not with the intention of overhearing what might follow, but to keep out of the man's sight, and to avoid the chance of meeting him. She hated and feared him, not without sufficient cause, as the reader will allow, and was panic-stricken by the thought that if she encountered him at this juncture of the plot con- fided to her keeping, he might drag the whole truth out of her. She believed him to be possessed of the craft, as he was of the depravity, of the great adversary of mankind.. She quaked in her shoes when the pair-master and man- in drawing away from the door and windows, walked di- rectly above her head, and there arranged the preliminaries of their expedition. Some words were lost; others but par tially comprehended; still, she made out the drift of their   1.U      COLONEB FLOYD'S WARDS. purpose, and, while she was greatly mystified by certain ex- pressions which occurred in the dialogue, she blessed the business, whatever it was, which took them out of the way at the moment when her mistress was expecting the real groom.                        , "Before you get back, the knot will be tied fast and hard, and then let's see you break it!" she chuckled. Not audibly, for Booker was standing upon the top step, awaiting his accomplice's return. The flight was not a tall one, nor was her position comfortable or desirable, bowed- together as she was, and not daring to move afinger, hardly venturing to draw a breath, while she could hear-the creak of Booker's boots as he shifted his weight from one foot to the .other, on the very plank against which her head rested. Her imprisonment was of brief duration in reality, tedious though it seemed to her. She did not quit her covert until the clang of the iron heels upon the flinty spring-path quite died away; but she had one glimpse of the patrolling party, as they passed through the broad stream of light pouring through the dining-room window. Colonel Floyd carried his gun, his inseparable companion in his nightly rambles, and Booker also bore something, she could not determine what, upon his shoulder. "There you go!" soliloquized the girl, stretching her be- numbed limbs. "Two as great vilyans as ever breathed I Hunting runaways, are you? You've tracked some poor fellow to his den, and mean to have him out, live or dead t 'Tain't the first job you've joined hand-in-hand in-but you won't go unpunished in the end, or the ScripteW is mistaken, which ain't likely.

SALLY had no opportunity for the proposed communica- tion. Outside the door of the bride's chamber stqod Helen, in close conversation with her cousin, Harvey Floyd. Both were laughing; for if Harvey attached any importance to the colonel's threat of retribution upon the sinning Robert, he kindly and discreetly refrained from whispering to her a syllable relating to this part of the scene, which he pre. tended to describe to her with great exactness and- evi- dent enjoyment. -The consultation was broken off by the outhurst, from the adjoining room, of a figure in white robes. "Helen Gardner! why aren't you in hysterics, or swoon- ing, or something like that-as is suitable and graceful in the circumstances? I should be terrified into convulsions, if I were in your place. An hour after tite time set for the ceremony, and not a word from the bridegroom! It's a perfect scandal--or, else, some terrible accident has hap- pened-and in either case, you ought to go crazy!" "I have just brought her a message that obviates the necessity of parting with her wits," replied Harvey. "The fortunate man is now on his way to happiness. I left him only half an hour ago. Aunt Ruth's newest cap was not ready in season, and he could not, as a dutiful nephew, leave her-while she was conscientiously opposed to wear- ing her second best. It was trimmed with green, which she said was an unlucky color at weddings. There were  .   '    , '" * ^i   '   ^   i92      COLONEL FLOYD'S WiADS. twelve yards of white satin ribbon to be furbelowed upon the new one, and the last bow but one was being sewed on when I came away; so they cannot be far behind me. You are divine, to-night, Miss Virginia!" ,'Humbugl" with a smile of conscious vanity. "You ought to see Lily now! She is heavenly! So pure-looking, so ethereal, so exactly like a snow-flake, that you are pos- itively afraid that she will melt away before your eyes-be exhaled like a dew-drop!" i I hope she won't melt, or exhale, while I am looking at her!" answered the saucy groomsman. "Where is this same ;snow-drift, or snow-drop, or whatever you call her? I would like to take a parting look at her before she leaves this world for good and all." "In there, with the rest of them," nodding' backwards into, Helen's room; and Harvey, taking the hinted in vitation, walked himself into the midst of the fair and flut tering group. There was a little scream of affected horror and surprise at his unceremonious entry; then the girls closed in upon him on every side. "Mr. Floyd! what is the matter down-stairs?" ^ What makes you gentlemen so tardy? We're tired to death waiting!". "Hasn't Mr. Lay come yet? It's shocking!" and similar inquiries pelted his ears-a confusing volley, even to one of his consummate impudence. "All right!-- all right I He will be here shortly!" he repeated, over .'and over, with slight variations, until tho Babel subsided into a satisfied hum. Lily had remained aloof, looking on with sad contempt, that was heightened into disdain when her cousin accosted her. "Come, Lil! stand out into the light and let me see you I                     .   COLONEL FLOYD'S WAARDS.       193 Miss Virginia likens you to snow-flakes, and dew-drops, and all manner of other beautiful things." He pulled her towards him, that he might take a better view. "Don't, Harvey! you hurt me! Let me alone, I say-!" she cried, sharply, trying to wrest her hands from his. He held her tight.       ] "The half was not told me," said he,l in mock rever- ence. "You are a gem-a star of the first lustre-and sixth magnitude-but nbt snow! There's too much heat for that!" If Virginia's simile had any aptness, this external fairness was the snowy crust veiling a volcanic heart. i Lily's great eyes glittered feverishy; her skin was hot; her lips had a scarlet tinge.    . "You are to walk with me, you know, Queen Mab," con- tinued Harvey.  "I shall watch you very closely, lest you unfold a pair of starry wings and fly away." C"I know no such thing!" she retorted, peevishy, and Harvey perceived his-blunder when he recollected that Aleck Lay, as first groomsman, was the attendant assigned to her. The sound of an arrival below relieved him from the necessity of fibbing to hide his lapsus linguce. "There he is at last!" He dropped the struggling hands and wasl off like the wihd. Miss Ruth passed him on the stairs, mounting to the dressing-room under the pilotage of a maid. The poor lady looked scared and flurried, and Harvey laughed to himself, in the imagination of her amazement at-the recent disclosure made to her. Aleck was in the hall; handsome and self-possessed-a smile of heart-felt satisfaction dispel- ling every vestige of cynicism from his features. "All goes well-l" was Harvey's salutation, " and I have   194      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. served a notice upon Chandler, to take the vacant place in the train. You will -find him with the rest of the fellows, in the room over there.; "' Thank you!" Aleck preceded -him to the apartment designatedc and presented himself to the anxious " fellows." "I am sorry that I have bqen unavoidably detained, gen- tlemen-less on your account, however, I confess, than be- cause I fear my delay has occasioned discontent to the ladies who are awaiting you. Every thing is ready, I believe. Shall we go up and make our peace, as best we may?" "Is your brother here?" questioned one. "L(My brother was called suddenly from home this fore- noon, and has not returned yet. Fortunately, his presence is not indispensable, however much we may desire it." "Not indispensable!" ejaculated Tom Shore. "What do you mean? Who ever heard of a wedding without a bridegroom? unless, indeed, you act as his proxy!" he sub. joined, with a half laugh. "I shall be married on my own account-not in the stead of another," replied Aleck, coolly. "This is a matter which was determined upon between Miss Gardner and myself, more than two years ago. Perhaps you would like to test the truth of my assertion by an appeal to the lady herself," He led the way to the floor above, and the others, includ- ing the 4' dumfoundered"Tom, followed in his wake. Helen did not lift her eyes at their approach, but the bril- liant carmine of her cheek answered the fervent pressure with which Aleck laid her hand within his arm. Never were voluble girls rendered so mute by astonishment as was the knot of pretty attendants. Lily clung to Harvey for sup- port; searched his face in such agony of inquiry, that he could not help whispering an explanatory sentence or two. "It's all right! They have loved one another for years   COLONZEL FLOYD'S WADSD.       195 and years. She was always queer, and so is he. The en- gagement with Robert was a blind. It's the best-joke of the'season!" Honestly he believed but- half of this tale; but he was pledged to carry the matter through, and he would do it with a brazen face, if not with a stout heart. Lily utterly discredited this account of the sudden reversal of precon- certed arrangements, but it mattered little to her how it had come about, while the evidence of her own eyesight showed her Helen Gardner as the bride of Aleck, and not Robert Lay. Divers editions of the surprising story were breathed by the other gallants to their respective charges during the downward march of the procession-; and it sp oke volumes for the self-command or aptitude in deception of the femi- nine part of the band, that when they were drawn up in bridal array, confronting the crowd: of gaping-and aghast spectators, none of them betrayed-the slightest symptom of curiosity or embarrassment ;-each was competent to the oc- casion. Mrs. Floyd uttered an exclamation of dismay or wonder as the clergyman, in obedience to a word from Aleck, and after a glance' at the license presented by Harvey, began the marriage service. He paused longer than was needful or customary after the solemn bidding of the charge; bent a gaze, scrutinizing, and not altogether free from severity, upon the youthful couple, while the silence throughout the room became oppressive. "I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets -of all hearts will be dislcosed), that if either of you know any impedi- ment, why ye may not be lawfully joined- together in matria mony, ye do now confess it: for be ye well assured, that if any persons are joined -together otherwise than as GODls word doth allow, their marriage is not lawful."   ,           ..   196.      COLONEL FLOYDiS W ARDS Aleck met the penetrating eyes confidently-proudly, while Helen stood firm and calm beside him. The cer. emony proceeded; the responses were made promptly and audibly, and Aleck's voice had never been more clear and steady than in articulating the vow:      .. "I, Alexander, tave thee, Helen, to be my wedded wife, to have and to hold firom this day forward, for-better for worse; for richer for poorer; in sickness and in health; to love and to cherish, till death do us part, according to GOD'S holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth." It was done! and, regaining breath and speech with one simultaneous efforts the assembly surged impetuously tow- ards the newly wedded pair. Inquiries more pointed than polite.; banterings of all descriptions, gay, gentle- and ill- natured ;, reproaches that were meant to be playful, and yet had an angry tone mingled with the laugh; every variety of congratulation was heaped upon the perpetrator of the daring deed, in a fashion that few would have been able to bear. But they were blest with dauntless spirits and strong nerves, and while Helen was suffered to remain by Aleck's side she did not shrink, and he was doubly courageous.     ' Poor, poor Miss Ruth! She slipped fast and quietly out of the press after kissing her " children," and heaving one little sob upon Helen's shoulder, and betook herself to the darkest comrner of the conservatory, where she had her cry out in a comfortable style. She alone, beside her nephew and his wife, knew the secret of Robert's dishonorable de- feotion, and the consequent d6nouement between the real loers; and she acquiesced cordially in Aleck's application of the good old-fashioned doctrines, that " those who truly love one another ought to marry," and that "the sooner a false step is corrected the better ;" yet she had been taken so by surprise; her limited range of ideas and conjectures   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.      197 had been st abruptly enlarged; her grief at Robert's inex- plicable behavior so sincere; her dread of tompromising him and annoying Aleck and his bride so great, that it was no wonder she was, to 'use her own language, "fairly lpset." Her privacy was soon invaded. She mopped up the streaming tears at sight of a white dress and the sound of light, hurried footsteps. "I came to look for you, Aunt Ruth," said Lily Calvert, winding her arms about- the old lady's neck, and sinking to her knees beside her. "I have nobody else to whom I can speak-and speak I must, or my brain. will go wild. You will never repeat what I say, will you?" "Yes-yes-dear!" murmured Aunt Ruth. "That is, I would say, 'No,' my love!" "You know every-thing, do you not? Robert has often told me that he kept nothing hidden from you. You must know why and where he is gone?" "Yes!" assented Miss Ruth, distressfully. "Don't speak so sadly, please! You wound: me to1the quick. Ihad looked for charitable judgment from you. Indeed-indeed he could not help it, Aunt Ruth! You would not have'blamed him if you had known all he -had to bear-for he saw that Helen did not love him, and--that 1 did?" She whispered the last 'three words, and buried her face in the listener's lap. "Yes!"- Despite the objurgations Aleck had, in his aunt's hearing, and the early transports of his indignation, launched against Lily's coquetry and treachery, the charitable spinster could not discard all tender thoughts of the child she had loved from the sad hour of her birth. ' Mrs. Calvert had been the friend of Miss Massie's girlhood, and for -her sake she had   198      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. lirst learned to love the daughter. To her Lily*vas always winsome and loving, and she believed in her still; sym- pathized in the emotions whose intensity she perceived without fully understanding. Her motherly hand softly patted the curly head as she thought how young the weeper was-how tender and delicate-how unfit to bear the sorrow that pressed out those great choking sobs, "All may come right, dear, if you love one another-" "Ift"Lily reared her head eagerly. "I have seen that he did love me this long while, and others saw it too! But this morning there came this letter"--taking one from her bosom--' in which he tells me how dear I am, and begs me to meet him this evening--to go with him-to become his wife! And I would have done it-by this time we would have been together, never again to be parted, but for my cruel, cruel uncle X How he guessed my intention I cannot imagine, for only Simon and Sylvia knew of it, and they would never betray me-but he overtook me on the road end forced me back. I can never forgive him-- neverp "Her eyes glowed, and her fingers clutched the letter tightly. ' I am not his slave! I want you to write to Robert, Aunt Ruth. I shall be watched too closely for me to attempt -that. Tell him why I failed to join him. I cannot have him think that I was prevented by cowardice or indifference-and say, moreover, that if my life is spared I will yet escape and do as lie wishes, in defiance of my uncle's threats." "Yes," said Aunt Ruth, doubtfully; "but, Lily dear, there is nothing now to keep him away, since Aleck and Helen are married. Doesn't it seem to you that it will be more proper to wait until he comes home, and let things go on naturally and smoothly? Then again I don't know where to direct my letter." "T  Washington! He writes that he will wait there   COLONEL FLOYD'  WARDS.      199 for tidings of me should I fail to meet him. As to pro- priety, I detest .the word!" cried the girl, passiofately. "If you are hindered by such seruples, I will steal tim, to-night to write to him myself. Will you see that my letter is mailed?" ,Yes!" responded Aunt Ruth, yet more slowly and dubiously. The equilibrium of her ideas was too effectually destroyed by the strange events of the past few hours for her to offer any decided protest against becoming Cupid's postwoman. When she journeyed homeward at midnight, still dazed and wondering, no one part of the performances she had witnessed was more unreal to her than the fact that in her pocket, nestled among the folds of her immaculate ha^dker- chief, reposed a billet whose superscription, hastily scrawled in a fine feminine hand, was, "Mr. Robert C. Lay, Washing- ton, D. C." Harvey Floyd proved himself to be the nonpareil of kinsmen and groomsmen on that trying evening.  aving, as an indispensable preliminary, exorcised his conscience by a potent adjuration in the names of expediency and good- nature, he gayly assumed the r61e of master of ceremonies; circulated freely among the curious and suspicious guests, joking, laughing, and lyinu as he moved; "pooh-pcohing" at insinuations of unfair play towards the absent brother; declaring that he had been the confidant of all three of the parties concerned in this " capital hoax" ever since its inception; had known that Robert was looking after Aleck's interests, while people believed that he was pleading his own cause; hadc often laughed with him at the adroit man- ner in which the wool was pulled over people's eyes, etc., etc. "But how did it happen that neither Colonel nor Mrs. Floyd was cognizant of the true state of the affair? questioned the shrewd ones.   "In for a penny, in for a pound!" whispered tHarvey to his drugd' conscience, as it stirred in its sleep, and he re. plied s'  voce-with a meaning wink-- Colonel never liked Aleck-!opposed his marrying his ward. My worthy relative is a trifle ' kinky,' as we all know. Had no objec- tion to Robert. Since he could make no legal opposition to the match, both parties being of age, he vamosed so soon as he was informed who the veritable Benedict was to be. The thing had gone too far for him to stop it, but he wouldn't look on. D'ye understand?" And even the shrewd ones were so verdant as to believe that they did understand. Helen was voted " undutiful," "unfeminine," and "fast," by the sober adherents to cus- tom  and form; "spunky," "resolute," and "devotedf' by the more youthful and romantic portion of the com- paUy. "You are the biggest story-teller I ever heard of!" de- clared 'Virginia Shore to the laughing bride. "And to think of your carrying it so far as to pretend that you were going to wear those coutemptible' rose-buds as your only oaments, when you intended to behave like a Christian woman, and sport the pearls! It must be owned that you loos lke a queen in them. 'Doesn't she, Mr. Lay? But for all that, if I were your confessor, I would make you we ten miles with peas'in your shoes for such abominable fibbing. And, now, I am just expiring to know one thing. If Four tongue can speak the truth, after its long and diligent practice in the other line, I wish you would tell me' where Mri. Robert is.  It is the one unaccountable cir.. cumstance in the unm'avelled plot-and excuse me, my dear- I must say that it has a queer look!" Ateok came to Helen's relief so promptly that her hesita tion at this very direct question was not noticed. "Until this morning, Miss Virginia, my brother had   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.   a    201 never intimated an intention of absenting ihimself on this interesting occasion. Before breakfast he receiv!l a letter calling him from home upon urgent business. The sum mons was imperative, anid admitted of not even an hour's delay." Lily was passing wher, Virginia's mention of Robert's name. struck her ear, and she involuntarily stopped to listen. Aleck gained her eye at the beginning of his reply, and did not release it until he concluded-held it by a gaze of such significant contempt that, as he said to himself, if the girl retained one grain of self respect or shame, she must' quail beneath its questioning. She did indeed change counte- nance, but it was a look of incredulity or surprise, not con- scious and detected guilt. He let her alone after that. She had no ground to lose in his estimation, and, whatever might be his opinion of her course and motives, he, of all the world, had least cause to murmur at the result of these. Mrs. Floyd-as she was accustomed to aver in after days -would never have lived through that evening but for the support of Harvey's unblushing mendacity and Aleck Lay's ready tact. Nor was Helen backward in sustaining her aunt in her difficult position. Laying aside the stiff stateli- ness, enjoined by etiquette upon the bride, she deported herself as the daughter of the house, who was mindful of her guests' comfort and pleasure, and in considering these lost sight of the novelty of her own position. She did not dance, but she was careful that no lady who wished to do so should lack a partner; she chatted easily and freely with matrons; replied merrily to the badinage of the elderly gentlemen, who were not sparing in their comments upon the extraordinary character of her nuptial ceremonies; privily directed waiters, and as privately suggested forgot- ten duties to the mistress of the establishment. She was l   202      COLONEL FLOYD'S W*ARDS. incalculably more valuable to her perplexed and worrivA aunt thanti wasLily, who spoke and acted all the while like one in a trance. Never did hostess, especially one by nature and practice so hospitable as was the lady of Belleview, hail the depart- ure of visitors so joyfully as did she the first stir of leave- taking among those whose coming she had greeted with un- feigned cordiality. The colonel had not yet returned, when, at three o'clock in the morning, s}he threw her wearied limbs and aching head upon her couch, too tired and full of pain to speculate on her lonely pillow as to the causes of his pro- longed absence. She slept soon and soundly, so profoundly that she did not know when the absentee came in, and'was awakened at last by the broad light of morning. "Bless my life, it is eight o'clock!" she exclaimed, spring- ing up, "and I never eveginheard Amy make the fire! When did you come in, and why didn't you wake me, colonel?" Her husband was at the toilette-table, shaving himself. Apparently, his hand was not very steady, for the lather he had scraped from his chin was streaked with blood, and the rqzor inflicted a deep gash as his wife spoke. She had scarcely expected any answer, other than the one which came-a bitter oath!, and, to tell the truth, she was much more concerned about the wedding breakfast, and the prob- able condition of the rooms used by the company the previ- ous evening, than affected by his humor. He surprised her by a query before her hurried dressing was- completed.-- "How did your dear five hundred friends take the news that there could be no wedding, for want of a bridegroom?" he growled between his teeth. "Sure enough I How forgetful I am! 'You were not here when it all came out!"Mrs. Floyd checked herself in the act-of lowering her dress over her head. "I don't know   COLONEL FLOYDS WAEDS.        203 how to tell you, or where to6begin. It was all so unexpece. ed, even to me! How she contrived to keep it a secret up to the last minute, I cannot divine; but she did, and fooled us all completely. And to think that Aleck Lay could play the hypocrite as well at she did, and Robert too! I wouldn't have believed it of him! I always thought, that he had such an open heart and honest tongue. I declare it beats every thing I ever heard or dreamed of!" She was interrupted by a profane ejaculation, and- On order 4" to say what sh6 had to say, and to stop that infernal gabble!" "Why, my love, I was just going to tell you-! Did you ever suspect that she was not in love with him? that she was throwing dust in our eyes all this time, even when she was making up her wedding clothes and accepting her wed- ding presents? When Mr. Bradley commenced the cere- mony, I really thought that I should faint outright. And nobody knew it except Harvey, -and I must say/that he be- haved very unhandsomely in not giving me a hint. Mercy on- us, colonel! what's the matter?" He had turned about, his back to the table, leaning heavily against it; the razor in his hand; his complexion nearly as colorless as the foam yet left upon his cheeks. "Ceremony! what ceremony?" he said, in a guttural whisper. "Why, the marriage service, to be sure, over Aleck Lay and Helen Gardner. They were married about nine o'clock, and-oh!" She rushed forward with a- scream, in season to prevent his falling to the floor, seating him instead in an easy-chair that was luclily close at hand, and supported the heavy ahead, swaying helplessly to and fro. Her frightened cry speedily brought help. A gang of bustling, terrified ser- vants. collected around him; stripped off his outer clothing, g            I   204      COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS. loosened his collar and cravatrand bore him to the ]bed. By the time they reached this stage of proceedings, he had re, vived so far as to speak, but so inarticulate was his primary attempt, that his wife begged him to repeat it. He did, with an angry effort. "Booker!" "Run for Booker, some of you!" ordered Mrs. Floyd. "Do you want him to go for the doctor,-dear?" she inquired, tenderly. He breathed hard and loudly; his forehead was dark still with the dangerous flood that had rushed up to the brain, yet he scowled at' her; lifted his hand menacingly towards the flock of negroes. -"OutI every one of them!" he managed to say, more distinctly now. The violence of the attack was passing. Booker did not obey the summons with especial alacrity. He was asleep when it .was brought to his house, and awoke unwillingly; arose sullen. Mrs. Floyd was banished, as her menials had been, at-the entrance of this high and sulky functionary. For half an hour she was kept waiting without the chamber, while a low'conference went on inside. Her lord was mani. festly better when the janitor permitted her return to the 'bedside i better in body, but in temper as ill-conditioned as mortal could'well be. After an infinite amount of argument and persuasion, she prevailed upon him to admit the physi- cian, for whom a messenger had been despatched two hours before; and since she was not forbidden the privilege, she remained in the room during his stay. , }  Colonel Floyd had ridden twenty miles the night before, he stated to the medical man, "upon a false scent"--he in- terpolated,- savagely-had eaten nothing, and slept none." The consequence was a rush of blood to the head--a trifle not worth naming but women were such fools I   COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS.       205 Convinced, upon examination, that the seizure was really not severe, and his patient in no peril of his life, the doctor recommended a little cooling medicine and a, day's quiet; buttoned up his coat, picked up his saddlebags, and prepared to go. 'Tihe weather has moderated," he remarked to Mrs. Floyd, in quitting the apartment. "We shall have snow-by night." She accompanied him down-stairs; received an additional direction or two, and resought her husband's presence I He had shifted his position, and dragged another pillow under his head;' raised himself high enough to-enable him to look out of the window nearest the bed. "Didn't the doctor say there would be snow to-day?" he asked, in ill-dissembled eagerness. "Yes, it is' clouding. up fast. We shall have falling weather by noon, I think. Aleck andHelen are about going, my dear. Do you feel able to say 'good-by' to them?" "If I did, they should not cross that threshold!" he said, vehemently. Tell them I say 'begone!' and send my curse after them."                s Mrs. Floyd wisely and politely concluded to modify this amiable message in the delivery; so the bridal pair were only told how sorry she was that the colonel was too seri- ously indisposed to see them, and that the doctor had en- joined absolute quiet.     . ;    ' The dinner party at Greenfield was to proceed, as had been contemplated before the late momentous changes. This was decided upon, partly to gratify Miss Ruth, partly to appease the suspicions of those who obstinately cherished the idea that there was something wrong behind the senes; the incorrigible skeptics, whom even Harvey Floyd ,could not lie into belief of the story he promulgated so industriously.   206      COLONEL FLOYD'S WAD Db  iThe fields were like unwritten white paper; the roads were growing heavy with drifts, and it was still snowing hardl, when, at dusk, a carriage drove up to the ancient mansion of Maple gill, and Aleck assisted his wife to alight. Neither of them would remain under Robert's roof longer than was necessary for appearance's sake. Both longed for quiet and home. Busy hands had been at work within doors all day. The windows were ruddy with firelight,'and the young husband led his bride from the raw, chill outer air into a large, old-fashioned -hall, well lighted and warm, where were ranged a score of family servants, dressed in holiday attire, and profuse of smiles and courtesies to their new mistress. . "The blessin' of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob be upon em!'" groaned a pompous voice from the head of the line. Helen tried to say-"Thank you " but the effort expired in stifled mirth. "The egregious blockhead!" said Aleck,' fretted and yet amused, as, having spoken a kind word of acknowledgment to his dependents, he conducted Helen into the parlor, seat- ed her in a great chair, and undid her bonnet and cloak. "The preposterous humbug! A padlock for his mouth, to be worn constantly, except at meal-times, would be an admirable re'gimen for him." "Petronius, was it not?" asked Helen, still laughing. "Of course it was! By the way, I must have a talk with him to-morrow. It was he who brought that letter to Green. field yesterday afternoon. I omitted in my-- excitement then to -ask him at what point of the road he met Robert. I -would like to inquire into the particulars of their interview. Why are you shivering, love, are you cold?" iNo'! only a passing chill. I have a strange aversion to speaking of- yesterday, or of any thing connected with-- with-what might have happened."   COLO NEL FLOYD'S WARDS.      207 he was very pale, and trembled visibly. Aleck leaned o er to kiss her-put his arm about her. "Why, you dear little goose! the danger is all over now; yc ur fate is sealed! You are a captive, and your jailer is a prppetual institution." She smiled mutely; then her head drooped upon his s oulder, and there was silence for a while. "Speaking of Petronious reminds me of the evening ser- vice we attended at Mr. Shore's, some weeks ago," resumed Aleck, cheerfully, to dispel any remnant of unpleasant feel- ing that might be lingering in her mind. "Do you recollect the bit of paper, the loss of which chagrined Lily so much?" 4"Yes. I knew that you had it then, although I dared not thank you for th6 theft." He took out his pocket-book. "See here," opening an inner compartment. "Why did you keep it?" asked Helen, catching at the soiled and creased leaf.  "Because I read there, in your handwriting, that it was 'dangerous to play with edge tools,'" responded Aleck, "and my own disappointed heart responded to the truth of ' the maxim. I preserved it as a monitor for future direction. The consequence was, that I had made up my mind to live and die a ' crusty, fusty old bachelor!'" With a gesture of playful petulance, that brought back to him the memory of her girl days, Helen put her hand over his mouth, and tossed the paper into the fire. "I am glad it storms!" she said presently, looking at the snow-encrusted panes. "It makes our home so much the more cosey and dear." While they mused, with locked hands, tenderly-smiling lips, and eyes full of happy light, upon the sweetness -wrap- ped up in that little phrase, "our home," Colonel Fl9yd's chamber was dark, save for a feeble glimmer from the fire   208      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. he would not allow to be replenished, and the waning'gray light from the windows. Upon these his haggard eyes were fixed, as they had been from the commencement of the storm, gloating with a sort of greedy 'satisfaction, which was enigmatical to his attendants, over its continuance and increasing fury. Not until the last ray of daylight had van- ished, and he could no longer discern the falling flakes be- tween him and the leaden sky, would he listen to his wife's solicitations that she might have the curtains lowered, and wood and candles brought in. At nine o'clock Booker appeared to inquire after his mas- ter's condition, and recdive his orders for the night. Lily happened to be present at the moment. Her uncle had in- sisted upon seeing her, on her return from the dinner at Greenfield, as if to' assure himself that she was actually in the house. She was- a heart-sore and peevish creature throughout that lonely evening, but ungraciously promised obedience to his further command that she should see him again before retiring to rest. It was upon this second visit that Booker encountered her.  "What of the weather?" questioned Colonel Floyd of hbs retainer.     '  Snilowing faster than ever, sir. The drifts will be :o rt foot deep by morning." "Good!" -The sick man settled himself in his bed, wim h grunt of satisfaction Booker continued,    ' And upon ground so hard froze as it is now, the snoir will lie three weeks and better." "I don't see why that should be so desirable as you see to think!" said Lily, crossly, shrugging her shoulders. "W' will have bad roads all spring."            "Hold your tongue, you jade, and go to bed!" said her uncle, furiously.   COLONEL FLOYD S WDS.       209 "That's because you don't understand, you see, Miss Lily,'".answered Booker, demurely. "Deep snows are prime for the winter wheat, and for every thing else that's in -the ground, for that matter. Good-night, sir; I hope you'll sleep sound." *i z Lj -s "    Q10      OLOnAeL FLOU rS Wettub CHAPTER 'XIII. Two months had passed since the wedding, which had set the tongues of the neighborhood wagging, as only an out. -of-the-way marriage or shocking murder can do. It was a nild, soft afternoon, in the latter part of February, and Helen Lay stood at the front window of her pretty parlor, watching the winding road that led up to the house. Aleck had been absent four days, on a business trip to Baltimore, and this evening was to end their first separation. How keenly she had felt it, might be gathered from her restless movements about the room, when her eyes became weary of straining into the unsatisfactory distance; her changeful coloriand quickened attention at sight of-any far-off moving object, or any sound that fancy could construe into the rum- ble of wheels or beat of hoofs. "HEe won't come while you are looking for him my dear," observed Aunt Ruth, with a quiet smile, from her seat at the fire. 'But, placid as she looked, and steadily as grew the stock- ing under her fingers, she was not free from impatience her. self, and inwardly rejoiced in the signs of anxiety which the young wife could not conceal. They were tributes to her - boy's" worth, proofs of the affection borne him by his best beloved. : Helen blushed, and tried to laugh; then came and sat down beside the diligent spinster. "' I believe that I am ' fidgetty' to-night, as VirginiaShore 'calls it' but it is not altogether the desire to see Alecl ?. N .   COLONEL FLOYD'S W  eS.      :2" again, although I do not deny that that feeling is strong. I am oppressed by the idea of some impending sorrow--a presentiment that something sad or disagreeable is to befall me. You have felt such, Aunt Ruth, have you not?" Yes." "Then you know how hard it is to shake these off." "Yes!" Miss Ruth sighed; a respiration telling of a 'volume of% like experiences. "Not that I believe in omens or presentiments," contin- ued Helen, bravely, "only when one is a little excited from other causes, a notion of this kind fastens more easily upon ,he mind. I have not been very happy to-day; not nearly so buoyant of spirits as I should be. Lily's countenance, as I saw it yesterday at church, has haunted me ever since. You must have observed how sadly she has changed." "Yes, dear!"Aunt Ruth said, in intonation and look-; "who could help noticing the poor child! I never saw a sadder wreck in my whole life." K "I wish, for her sake, that Robert would come home," Helen resumed, pensively. "His movements are a complete riddle to me. They vex Aleck grievously, too. He has written to Robert five or six times, but the two lIters we have received from the runaway, make no mention of his having heard from us. The suspense is hard for the brother to endure; what must it be to Lily, poor girl! Hist!" The faint echo that had entered her ear grew louder. "Yes!" nodded Aunt Ruth, smilingly, in answer to the brightening eyes and uplifteu fingers.  They, harkened a minute longer. A carriage, was cer- tainly approaching.   I       . "I will not stir until it stops!" said Helen, poutingly, her cheeks one'flush of crimson. "You shall see how well  I can behave!"'   212      COLONEL FLOYD'S WAJDS. She fulfilled her promise to the, letter; but there was -  scanty evidence of the spirit of paient awaiting in her gladsome exclamation and rapid flight to the hall door when the wheels ceased to move. The vehicle, a buggy driven by a negro, was similar in appearance to that-which lBiad been sent to the ddp6t for the absent master of Maple-Hill. It had; hlted before the porch steps, and a gentleman was alighting when she- appeared at the, entrance. . But his was not the joyous bound of a wedded lover; nor was it Aleck's figure and features that met her dismayed vision. The driver was Booker, his passenger Colonel Floyd.' Chagrined and disconcerted though Helen was at the unexpected and' unwelcome visit, she coula not but remark the change in his person and movements effected by his recent sickness. His step -was slow and languid; his hair whiter, and his eye had the furtive, uneasy glance of one disturbed by perpetual forebodings of evil, or harassed by constant physical suf- fering. "Aunt was right when she told me, the other day, that he was woefully broken," thought Helen, as with instinctive and lady-like hospitality, she offered her hand and invited him to;enter the house.  Not until he had paid his respects to Miss Ruth, seated himself by the hearth and removed his gloves, did he revert to the errand that had brought him hither. I That he had an errand, and one which could not be intrusted to another, Helen was assured the instant she saw him, for he had never darkened the doors of her new abode until now. "I have called to see Mr. Lay upon business," he said to her. ' Business which should have been settled before this late day, but for my infirm stateof health." "He left home last Friday for Baltimore," replied Helen, 'aEnd has not! yet returned. I am expecting him this even. ing n   COLONrL FLOYD'S WARDS.       213 She. could not force herself to propose that he should await Alecl's arrive Polite insincerity could not carry her to the length of deliberately concerting such a defeat of her anticipated joyous meeting with her :husband.. It seemed that Colonel Floyd was not inclined, in this respect, to stand upon ceremony. He leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs, with the aspect of one who had laidin a , sufficient stock of patience, and had no intention of remov- ing immediately from his chosen position. Aunt Ruth sat up stifly, lips compressed and eyes riveted upon her work. Helen made another effort to do the honors decently. She would not essay cordiality. "I hope that aunt and Lily are well." "I believe they are. I hear no complaints." "Lily is-looking badly, I think. I met her yesterday at church.' "Humph!! Three-fourths of her disorder is imagination. Her aunt tells me that she is troubled with dyspepsia and blues this winter. It is fashionaltle for young ladies to fall into ill-health."        i "She is certainly very thin, and coughs a great deal," responded Helen, smothering her displeasure at hiscon- temptuous jreply--and there was a tedious pause. Her face kindled presently, and glancing significantly at Miss Ruth- she left the room. There was no mistake this time. Another- buggy had driven to the door-Colonel Floyd's moving on to make room for it, and Aleck Lay leaped to the ground almost before the horse was checked. He came directly up the steps to salute his wife; held her to him in a hasty embrace and kissed her; but his first words were abrupt, his tone harsh "Is Colonel Floyd here?" "Yes-in the parlor. I am very sorry-" - l"Iam not!" ;-A ,+7 .' 0'                 '.     214      COLOEL  ZorT's wzaMBI,. ; Htie strodeinto the hall;- tore o his over-coat, and tossed it with-his hat and gloves upon a tae; then moved in the direction' of the!"parlor without another word. Shocked and ethilled by his stern face and negligent treatment of herself, Helen yet ventured to-follow him. "Dear Aleck!" she entreated, hanging on his arm. There is no haste about seeing him. Come to our room and rest awhile--letme brush the dust offl You look very weary,-and a bath will refresh you. I am afraid you are not well" t'  - "Oh, yes I am! I must see this man--get this meeting over at once!" Helen still hindered him. "You know, dear, that I could not help his being here just now! I lid not dream-of his coming until he drove up. I am sure I wish that he had stayed away! You are not angry with me, are you?" - The question o0 the timid tone served to recall Aleck to his senses. He looked down into the loving, pleading eyes, where the tears were already welling. "My precious wife I could I be angry with you even if I had cause? and that can never happen! Forgive me if I act strangely." My mind is full of other and important thinigs--matters concerning which we will talk together by and by.- You know that I am happy inbeing once more at home, and with you!"' -He gave her another kiss, more fond than the former ; re- leased: her, and entered the apartment where his visitor awaited him.

Up to this hour their married life -had glided on like a bliss- ful dream; the lover-husband been all that the most exact- ing bride could require.

I She believed, then, that chshe was. actuated, as she had said to lher-betrothed, by a sincere desire for the advancement of his interests no less than hers. She cared little whether she ' ,weredependent upon Aieek or no. All that she had was his, and for the rest-benefits-a livelihood itself from his hand woUld be all the sweeter because she owed them to -his love. Total dependence upon the one truly and only -beloved- never yet wounded a woman's pride.  She hadd time' to indulge these, and many other medi. tations. in the wearisome half-hour consumed in fruitless waiting and childish ;fears. Then, with a smack of the old haughtiness she condemned as unworthy, even while she ,yielded to it, she resolved to cast aside the part of the love- lorn, lady, pining in her bower; to show him that she,like- fwisecduld be oblivious of tender weaknesses and alive to rational considerations, such as should govern a sober, right-minded couple, from whose cup of happiness eight weeks of wedded experience had puffed away the sparkling foam.

' I am afraid that you are engaged!"   f "You will be no hindrance," was the reply, spoken in grave oliteness; and still doubting which course dignity and expediency would advise, she obeyed his gesture and sat .down. There were candles upon the table, so disposed that they shed a strong light on Colonel Floyd's features, while Aleck, by accident or design, had drawn -back into com- parative shadow. Helen was nearest him, but could only see his profile. Colonel Floyd almost faced her, and she noticed, mechanically, as it were, that he seemed to be annoyed,. or otherwise excited. His hand rested upon sev- eral letters and other written papers lying on the table, and shuffled them nervously as he spoke or listened. "You have had no direct personal communication by mail or in any other manner with my brother, since heleft home, I understood you to say, Colonel Floyd?"-said Aleok, interrogatively, going on with the conversation his wife's entrance had interrupted. "None, whatever, sir. The last interview we had was purely one, of business, and took place in the forenoon of the twenty-fourth of December. At that time he delivered to me the cancelled bonds I have just shown you.

Mrs. Lay perhaps remembers that I was at the house when: she came home after a morning walk,-more. over ,that I informed her of your brothers failure to keep his engagement with me." Again, Helen gave a grudged and unspoken response to his-appeal, which was heeded as little by her husband as the former had been. He sat with an elbowresting upon the table; his hand-:spanning his forehead' and from' its shadow. his: eyes gazed keenly, intensely upon his visitor, never quitting imfor a second. Colonel Floyd felt their scrutiny, for -he winced at each question, and carefully re- frained from looking-at his interlocutor during his rejoinder.. "It is-growing vely late!" he observed, rustling his doe- uments-into a bundle, and tying them together with a bit of .red tape,.

"Have it at home--I can show -it to you, if you doubt/ my word, Mr. Lay," summoning his proudest manner and ac- cent. "I have not intimated such a doubt," replied Aleck, calm- ly.

In the last-named room Helen kept her company, sewing steadiy, and talking, not freely or continually, but pleasantly, when she did speak; the scarlet spot in' either cheek and her curling lip evincing that the in- ward strife was still far from being quelled. "ProudI proud!" soliloquized Aunt Ruth, mentally. ,' Lucifers in pride--both of them I The -best thing I can do is to leave her to solitary reflection far awhile; -at any rate, lto take my old useless body out of the way, in :case he should give in first-as I've heard that men are apt to do--and come to look for her.

Af Yet she sat thieifor two long, long hours, hoping, listen. ing, longing, and resentful, sullen, desperate, by turns; now half resolved to seek him, to cast herself upon, his bosom and supplicate for some demonstration of the affection, so freely and richly lavished upon her heretofore by eye,-word and caress; now avowing that she would die of heart-break - sooner than she would adopt a course so -humbling .to woman's pride. At eleven o'clock she folded her work, closed the-shutters, fastened down the windows and extin- guished the lamp; exercising no remarkable degree of cau- tion in performing the work. The library adjoined the ait. ting-room, and although there was no door of direct com- munication between the two, yet the occupant of the former could not well avoid hearing and understanding the meaning of the bustle prefacing hetretiring for the night. If he did hear it, he would, if he had any consideration for her wishes and feelings, leave his employment-" important" as it was -and come to their chamber to exchange a few words with her before bidding her "good-night." Therefore, she dis- missed her maid, professing that she was too wakeful to sleep, and wished to read awhile; then drew her chair near the fire-again to hearken for feet that did not come, to pine for loving tones and language that were not now to feed her hungry heart.* The hands of her watch pointed to twelve, when, ex- hausted and disheartened, she lay down upon her pillow, and she tossed there a dreary while before falling into a troubled sleep. Dreams connected and vivid, came with more profound slumbers. She was sitting upon the great ,rock at the spring, in the soft, summer moonlight with Rob- ert. The[ story of his long-cherished attachment was still sounding in her ears, awakening the strange, sad heart-ache, the mingled pity and sisterly tenderness she remembered so well; his hand enfolded hers; his arm was about her waist; tl                ,     A 224     COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. when--sudden, stern and sad, up starttd the form   and lineaments of his brother, and' the whole might- of her heiart's love' leaped out towards him.

She was sitting, upright; the cold sweat dripping from her forehead; her hands. clasped, and her lungs heaving convulsively, as if the imaginary pressure had been real, and but just removed.-' The room was dimly illumined by the dull, red glow of the embers. She had replenished the fire just before going to bed. Had it burned out so soon? Groping her way to the mantel, she struck a light and looked at her watch.. Ten minutes past two! and she was still alone I Where was he? Was there then truth in the horrible dream that had scared her native bravery from her breast, and had he ' deserted her? Or, was he ill? Had sudden sickness, or fatal accident befallenshim in that far off, lonely room? Seeking hastily for a wrapper, she took down from the wardrobe the crimson cashmere robe she had worn when summoned to meet Aleck i the -office, on her wedding night. She thought of that interview while prepaiing for this, and the memory strengthened her resolve. Taking the candle with her, she stepped out into the cheerless hall. A ray of light. stole from under the library door, but all was still within. Her soft step had not disturbed the student. With a'beating heart' she turned the bolt and entered.            .  "Who is there?': cried Aleck, angrily springing to his feet.   -   ^- 226   SCOLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. Then, as his wife's pale, shocked coufAenance -met 'W" sight, he passed his hand over his eyes, as if to dispel- th' mists of some horrible illusion, and said more gently, "Ah I' Helen I is it you? You startled me a little; is an) thing the matter?" 'Not:.with me,darling!"  She had seen his face, and pride and resentment fled apace Theterrble anguish that had ploughed those furrows in ;th- ' brow, and left its imprint upon every feature, should not be borne by him alone, while she lived to share the load. :She crept up to him like a child to whom perfect love has taught boldness, and wound her arms about his neck; drew down his cheek to7hers.       ' , 'Aleckl dear husband! you cannot reject my sympathy in your trouble, even while you may no} think it best to confide to me its nature. I wish I could bear it with and for you!"  ,He strained her to his heart, as if he would never let her gpo                 - "Darling! darling!" was all he could say, in accents strangled by the welling of the pent-up flood of feeling. Then he placed her in the chair from which he had arisen; knelt-before her, and still holding her in his arms, buried his face in her lap, wh)le a'storm of sobs shook his whole frame. The, bewildered and terrifiediwife strove by every loving art to. win him back to composure. Not once did she inquire into the cause of the agitation that could so master his heal. thy nerves .and, powerful-wil. She only implored him to be comforted, for her sake; reminded him that whatever other calamity had befallen him, they were still spared to one another; that their' mutual affection remained un changed.   - i"You are mine mine only-are you not I he asked, srddenly lifting himself to look at her.

Hero had been found there, secuiely stabled, and had now occupied his :old stall sat Geenfield formany weeks; but motives of. delicacy, the - principal of which was to shield Robert from public remark, had deterred Aleck from making any inquiries as to who hiad leftkthe animal in the hostler's care. Dismissing these now as absurd, where issues so momentous were involved, he, up6on his arrival at the tavern, made it his business to seArch -out the negro who had Charge of the stables, and recalling to his mind the circumstance and the time of its occurrence, asked whether he had himself seen Mr. Robert 3LayW:hile he waited at the house for the afternoon train. The fellow professed to-recollect every thing connected with the matter, and was positive in declaring that the horse had not been-brought to the stable until two hours after the cars ha- 1passed, and when it was already dark; that his rider was a negro of gruff speech and few words, who represent- ed that he had- been ordered to leave the ho'se in his, the hostleibs, keeping, until' Mr. Alexander Lay, of Maple, Hill, should send forhim, and forthwith departed upon foot. He OWuld;be loath, he subjoined, hesitatingly, to get an inno- cent person- into mischief, but one of the stable-boys had recognized the horseman by flashing a lantern into his face as he was leaving-the yard. He was, the groom was certain, a-i:flree colored. man of questionable character, who liNVed about five miles away. .

O LOITS WABDS,     283 this fellow's abode-a mean:cabin, situated in m pine grove about midway-between Colonel Floyd's plantation -and the dEp6t, a sequestered, ill-looking sot, fit to be the scene of evil deeds that shunned the light. The owner of this choice habitation was absent, but, his wife appeared at tihe- drot when the carriage stopped, and manifested signs of-extreme trepidation at beholding the visitor. Aligh-tingwith a- se- vere,- determined countenance, Mr. Lay called her naide, and boldly proclaimed his knowledge of her husband's errand lto thie tavern on Christmas' night-a job that would get him into trouble unless he could show that he came honestly - by the horse, or confessed who had commissioned him-to per- forms the act. The woman hung back for a time. Sheknew nothing of the matter; she had not seen the animal; she was awayfrom home all Christmas week, and a dozen lies more, which Aleck upset as fast as she brought them for- ward. At last, as he was turning off with the warning that ashe mad her accomplices might shortly find themselves before -a tribunal where means would be devised to extort the truth, she burst into tears, andtoffered to reveal allshe knew, piro vided he would not betray her-to her husband. A horse had been brought to their house about three o'cloek(,on Christmas day, by Booker, Colonel Floyd's headmn.' She had peeped at him through the window as he talkWldIi the yard with Jeff, her husband, had seen him hand Jeffa baik hote, and that the latter led the horse to the ruidehut; they caled a barn, and shut him in, locking the-door and p'oket. ing the key. She did not dare to ask questions, ori d6 d - to mention what she had wiitnessed, unless Jeff should volun- teer an allusion to the affair. :He made but one remiark that could have any biearing upon the subject, and that was at night-fall, just aftr he had despatched his- supper. :  "( I shan't be home -until near midnight," hie had: said,   234      COLONEL FLOYDS 'WARDS . "-and I've got one word to say before I start. Whatever 'you've seen to-day, or may hear to-night, hold your tongue, or you'll suffer for it." With that he wentiout, and she distinctly heard the tramping of hoofs sooh afterwards. While anxiety and suspense were wrought to the high. est pitch by my endeavors to shape a reasonable theory out of all this," continued Aleck, "I reached home, and the first object I beheld was Colonel Floyd's- carriage, with Booker standing by it; heard from you that he himself was waiting to see me. His ostensible business was to ask me to fix a day for- the settlement of his guardianship accounts. He offered the intelligence that he could hand over immediately that portion of your estate which was in ready money, and also render satisfactory statements of sales of property; the $,.   yearly crops and servants' hire; sums disbursed fior your expenses; and a great deal more plausible talk, to which I lent only half an ear. As adroitly'as I could in my unsettled state, I forced him to speak of, his liabilities to Robert, the proofs of which t told him my brother had showed me in a couple of bonds; executed and signed by Colonel Floyd, cov- ering an amount of nine hundred dollars. Accomplished villain as I knew him to be, I was yet thunderstruck when heproducede from his pocket-book the identical bonds, and displayed a long --cross-mark on the face of each, -made, he averred, by Robert himself, on the day before Christmas, at -which date he had paid over the full amount of his indebt- edness, and received these in testimony thereof. Now, my darling, do not be too much shocked by what I am going to say. At twelve o'clock, that very Christmas Eve, Robert and I sat in my chamber, talking over his prospects, pecu. niary and matrimonial, and he exhibited these very papers. uncancelled-told me-of the debt still due to him, express- ing his doubt as to its final liquidation, and his -regret for   COLONEL FLOYD'B WADS.       235 the weakness that had begailed him into lending money to an unprincipled spendthrift." "Can it be!" exclaimed Helen. "Yet I heard Colonel Floyd tell you-" '     ] u , You heard him tell me!" -interrupted Aleek, with in- creasing excitement-" like the liar that he is-, tht he had never held any cormmunication with Robert since the- noon of the 24th of December; that the annulled bonds were de- livered to him at that time; the papers which I stand pre- pared to swear I saw twelve hours later in my brother's hands. I purposely made him repeat the statement in your presence, that I might have a credible witness of the as- tounding falsehood. Now come several grave questions. By what means did he obtain possession of those bonds, and Robert's watch, a prized keepsake, which I have often heard. him declare he would'never part with on any consideration? If that woman's tale be true, and it is corroborated by the hostlers, Colonel Floyd's man Booker must have seen Rob. I  ert, and had some transaction with him on Christmas momn- ing; else how came he by the horse he left at the free ne- j d  gro's? What is it?" for Helen clasped her hands with- a i S low ejaculation.   . I    "! do not know that it is worth mentioning," she said, "but on that day-I took a long walk in the woods -back of Belleview, and while sitting under a clump of evergreens, a-- mile or more from the house, I saw Booker pass on horse- back. I had only a partial view of the horse, but I remem- ber he was dark bay in color, and carried his head high, like a gentleman's hunter. Could it have been Robert's Hero?"  .  "I believe -it," said her husband, emphatically. "In what direction was -he going--along what road?" That was the strangest part ofS-it! t He rode through the thickest heart of the forest, where there was not evenri   2836      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.      i bridle-path. I supposed that he was taking a short cut from the Bryantown to the Maysville road." "The very route he would have chosen if he wished to go by stealth to Jeff Harris's -house. Go on! You heard and saw nothing more while you were there?" "Nothing-,-the day was very still. Oh, yes, I did hear a gun I but it sounded some distance off-I should say half a mile." "  Was this before or -after Booker passed you?" "Before-some time before. My idea was, when I'saw him, that he had fired it, for there are not many sportsmen daring enough to hunt on Colonel Floyd's grounds." ' Doe he allow Booker tp carry firearms?" asked Aleck, assuming the composure thgt was contradicted by the white strain of the muscles on the lower part of his face. "Not that I know of. I do not recollect ever seeing him with a gun. Colonel Floyd rarely stirs from the house without his. Ihave told you that it was by this sign that Sally identified him in the eaves-dropper behind the oak at the spring, one night, when Robert and myself were talk- ing together." Abandoning the effort to look and speak as if no great horror' were, upon her spirit, she said, gazing tremblingly into her husband's eyes--the more fearfully as she saw them ,try to avoid hers-- Aleck! you have not said all yet!   Tell me plainly, what is your fear?  My brain is-in such a whirl that I can- :not connect all the circumstances you have enumerated. I only feel that there is some frightful mystery in this." "Would it be wise or merciful in me to burden you with what may be a mistaken conjecture?" he answered, eva- sively. "Here are Robert's letters-or those purporting to have come from him since his strange flight. Will you look them over with me?"  .      ' i    COLONEL FLOYD'S WA DS.       237 The first was dated Washington, D. C., and contained but eight or ten lines. It was, as the- writer termed it, "a miserable scrawl,'? and signed-- in great haste, R. C. L." The second was longer, and date and postmark were Vicks- burg, Miss. In it, he spoke of himself as a man wrecked in heart- and well-nigh ruined in fortune, and intimated his intention of seeking a residence in some distant land. Dis- honored and disappointed, he could not yet face his former associates. "I have not had one word from you, or from L., since I forsook home, and' resigned reputation for her sake.

I wish you joy of your bargain, and often amuse my- self by fancying how entirely you agree in heaping contempt upon my devoted head. Ah, well! so wags the world! and I must not complain. It is not likely that you will hear i   from me again shortly. I leave this place this afternoon, for New Orleans, where, unless I change my mind, I shall take passage for Europe.

A general resemblance ex isted--sufficient to deceive a cursory or unsuspecting reader but the longer one looked the more bungling appeared the forgery.             l "' What does it mean?" questioned Helen, in a suppressed voice of awe or fright.

He had only to give me this'letter and declare that he had had it from Mr. Robert Lay; that he had met him at such and such a place on the road, and been commissioned to deliver the envelope into my hands. The rascally hypocrite did his work well. "Oh " he groaned, arising and striding through the room " how dull-how madly stupid I have been!" i Helen sat like a statue. "Dearest!" she ventured to say, after a while, "-where, then, is Robert? What has become of him?" iI He. stopped--letting his clinched fist fall heavily upon the table. "Before Heaven I speak what I believe to be the truth, when I declare that Colonel Floyd murdered him -either with his own hands, or by means of his servant Booker!" In his overwhelming excitement he had not made due allowance for his wife's weaker nerves; had not appreciated   the fact that she had had but one little hour in whih -to receive and comprehend the dread conviction that had been growing in his mind for three days. As the word "murdered" left his tongue, she sprang to her feet, with a wild, horrified stare--and when the sentence was finished, gave a cry, and fell back fainting.           , . -           .'.', .   240      COLONEL FLOYD'S .WARD.  CHAPTER     XV. IT was not long after sunrise the next morning when Aleck Lay dismounted at the Greenfield gate. Returning slightly, and with an absent air, the surprised salutations of the few servants who were about the stables and yard, he went quickly up- thelwalk to the house door, unlocked it, entered, and -shut it behind him. The confined air in the halls struck coldly to his heart; the shadows lurking in corners, the feeble light. glimmering through the barred ' shutters,- had something ghostly about them. Unconscious- ly, he trod softly in ascending the stairs;-more lightly and slowly as he reached his brother's vacant chamber. It was very dark, and, to his imagination, colder than the rest of the house. It required an effort of courage to pass the threshold, and he had to grope his way across the room when he, wished to draw a curtain and throw wide a blind. Every thing was in perfect order. Aunt Ruth had spent half a day there, during the first week of Robert's absence; had arranged clothing and furniture; swept and dusted, be- fore, in obedience to Aleck's directions, she-had shut up the chamber and turned the key on the outside. She had per- formed her self-imposed duty with many tears, -but the housewifery eyes were not therefore dimmed, nor had the neat, swift fingers lost their cunning. Aleck's present ex- pedition was undertaken at his wife's suggestion, -and Aunt Ruth's motherly care for her absent boy, joined to her spinsterly particularity, was the nmain cause.   COLONEIL FLOYD S WARDS.      241 When Helen was fully acquainted with the nature and extent of her husband's dreads, and had regained some measure of her usual firmness and penetration, he found her acute intelligence and correct memory invaluable assistants in forwarding his researches. She had recapitulated Sally's account of the dishonorable conduct of Colonel Floyd bn the night of the rendezvous at the spring;-his attempts to induce Robert, and then herself, to consent to a marriage contract; his chagrin and rage at his failure, which, after overhearing the' conversation under the oak, he must have known was irremediable. The maid had never dared to confide the truth of her discovery to her mistress until they were safely installed at Maple Hill, and, when she did im- part it, had joined to the tale such confused details of Lily's attempted elopement, and the scene between master and man on the back porch, while she cowered under the steps, as 'awakened Helen's amazed curiosity, but not her fears. Now these were recalled, and Sally subjected to a thorough examination. Upon sifting her evidence, little that was new could be elicited, and she was stout in her conviction that Colonel Floyd and Booker were out "hunting runaways" when his ward was married, Aleck, reverting to his impression that the note brought by Gabriel to Robert, on the morning of their parting, was not directed by Helen, but Lily, and coupling it with Robert's declaration that he had an appointment at ten o'clock, was sure that this assignation was, in some manner, the plan by which he was lured into danger and destruc- tion. "If I only had that note, I feelassured that I should hold J the key to the whole mystery," he said, wistfully. "How, I wish that I had not obeyed the mistaken delicacy that Porbade my questioning him as to its contents!" "Do you remember what he did with it?" asked Helen.,   242      COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS. "I cannot say with certainty-but my idea is that he thrust it into his vest pocket so soon as he finished reading it." "Aunt Ruth told me not long since," said Helen, thought- fully, " that the hardest trial she had had, in all the sorrow connected with Robert's departure, was sitting down in his deserted room and mending a vest he had thrown aside just before going out, Christmas morning. She met him on the stairs directly after breakfast, and observing that the vest had lost a button, and was frayed about the collar and pock- ets, advised him to change it before he went to the court- house. It was not until she visited his chamber, several days afterwards, to put away his things, preparatory to locking it up, that she knew how well he had- obeyed her injunction. The vest lay on the bureau, where he had toss- ed it upon taking :it Off. She was exceedingly touched by this proof of his regard for her wishes. It may be that the Providence who has so strangely guided your investigations thus far, may lead you to further discoveries by means of this seemingly insignificant incident. Say nothing to Aunt Ruth about it.: The trouble will fall upon her soon enough. Wait for certainty.   ' To find this cast-off garment, then, was Aleck's object in revisiting an apartment where every thing he bieheld aroused poignant grief and vain, bitter remorse. The drawers at which he began his explorations were carefully packed by Aunt Ruth's tidy hands, and his, although less skilful, han- dled each article-with reverent tenderness. A great change had come over his thoughts of Robert. In place of the flush of shame and anger he had been used to feel warm his brow, at; thought of his disgraceful flight, and the unmanly conduct that preceded it; his supposed infidelity and dupli- city; the old tide of fostering fondness for his young, hand- some brother joined with anguish at his loss, and deep re pentance for the rank injustice he had done that gentle,   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARI:S.      243 noble spirit, in thought and speech, and swelled his heart almost to bursting. There was no time to be wasted in unavailing lamentations, or he must have bowed before the torrent of feeling and memory that flowed at sight of many familiar, and now sacred relics. The homeliest article of ap- parel-Robert's hunting suit, the heavy, muddy boots he had worn upon their last tramp through the low grounds-- a stained and shapeless straw hat, discarded as past worthy when the fishing season was over, and left, forgotten and useless, hanging upon a peg in the closet; these had become most precious in his sight. One master emotion drove him onward in the work to  which he believed destiny had appointed him; forced him forward over the graves of early and dear association and later loves; forbade the burning, bloodshot eyes the in- dulgence of a tear-the aching heart the relief of a sigh. Justice-justice, swift and awful, upon. the head of his brother's destroyer! He was not malignant or vindictive by nature, but he experienced a savage thrill of exultation in the thought that the bloodhound Detectioh was ready to spring at the murderer's throat,-ready, and straining at the leash,which he--the rightful avenger of blood-held. "At last!" He had feared lest he might not recognize the garment he sought; yet he knew it at a glance, as it was revealed by an opening drawer of the wardrobe. It lay uppermost, smoothly folded, the wrong side out, but he recollected' the glossy black silk, and its tiny -embroidered rose-bud, in the portion of the fabric composing the collar. He snatched it up, then stood for a moment, powerless to end his anxiety by further examination. He had to summon physical nerve with moral resolution before he thrust his fingers in trem- bling desperation into the;pocket. They touched a -paper, "dragged it forth--an env elope directed to "Mr. Robert Lay,   244      COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS. Greenfield," and bearing in one corner the words-" by Ga briel." He was obliged to sit down to read it, he was so uth terly weak. The ink was very pale, the pen-strokes delicate. An exclamation of extreme impatience escaped him at the trifling delay caused by the necessity of approaching a win- dow before he could decipher the few lines upon which depended so much. "Robert--he read--"I am very, very sad to-day, and there is no one excepting yourself to whom I can speak of my great trouble. It would do me good, be an unspeaka- ble comfort, if I could have one, just one more talk with you before there is put between us a barrier that must last for a lifetime. Believe me, I am not jealous of Helen's superior claims. I pray hourly for your happiness and hers; yet I cannot help feeling lonely now that I am about to lose my brother-my best-I had almost said, my only friend! If you have a half hour to spare this morning, will you not meet me at ten o'clock under the spruce pine? the pic-nio ground, you remember!  It is not so far from the road to the court-house that you will lose much time in comply- ing with this, as it may seem to you, bold request. I will explain my reasons for making it when we meet. Until then, trust me so far as to believe them good and sufficient. What I have to say concerns you no less than myself. Do not disappoint me! I shall wait for you until twelve o'clock.     Your fond sister,    LILY." Five minutes later, Aleck stood upon the piazza and shout- ed to a negro in the stable-yard-- "Ben! saddle Hero, and bring him around directly! directly! {do you hear?" "Hero, did you say, Mars' Aleck?" said the man, coming nearer.   COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS.       245 ' Hero! and hurry I! are you deaf?  The groom shook his head as he disappeared in the stable, implying that he could say much more on the subject if he cared to risk further parley with his impatient superior. While he waited, Aleck walked the porch-floor fast and furiously; gnawed his lip, as was his trick in moments of intense excitement i drew his breath in hot pants, like a wild animal thirsting for prey. Hero was led around to the door, a splendid creature,. full-blooded and thoroughly trained, stepping high and daintily. , How poor Robert loved that horse! The brother's look was not less fierce in the recollection, but the pat uponi the arched neck, the word of salutation-"Hero-old fellow!" that accompanied the hand caress, were signals of the inward thought. "He's-dreadful skittish now-a-days, Mars' Aleck " cau- tioned the hostler, respectfully. "Not a man on- this place dars to back him. Pears like he's been bewitched sence he was fetched home from Rock's tarvern! He flung Art'ur three times on de way from dar-as you heerd, may-be. Sumthin or someboay's sp'ilt him for good an' all--rm afeard!" "He- won't throw me! Whoa!" A spring seated Aleck in the saddle,--the horse bounded forward, and steed and rider swept down the lane with the rush of a whirlwind. "Thar's a par of 'em!'" commented Ben, recovering his breath. "How Mars' Aleck's eyes did snap!  Wonder what's crossed him now? I'd rather meet 'de debbil on de darkest night dat ever shone dan to stan in his way when his blood is up!" It so happened that the illustrious Gabriel was at that- very moment sauntering along the middle of the high road, in the direction of Belleview, snuffing in copious draughts ;,   246       COLONEL FLOTDIS WARDS. of'the pleasant air, and enjoying mightily the increasing warmth of the sun's rays upon his back. His mother, the baker of Belleview, had had "poor luck" with her last jug of yeast, and designing, on this day, to repair the misfor- tune, had, as he discontentedly phrased it, "rousted" her hopeful son from his bed at an unconscionably early hour, and despatched him to a neighboring plantation, to borrow   I from a sister in the profession a small quantity to "raise" the fresh supply. This was the meaning of the small tin-   . pail-in southern parlance, " bucket"--that dangled from    } Gabriel's hand, and was occasionally whirled dexterously about his head without a drop of its contents being spilled; for the errand-boy was an adept in all arts of prestidigita- tion that. came within the range of his observation and practice.                           - As he walked he sang, kicking up the loose dirt in the road with his toes; stopping, now and then, in his march,    never in his song, to shy a stone-at a bird, or a bushy ever- s green where bird or hare might be hiding.

There was a level and straight stretch of road before him, and just entering this vista he descried a horseman bear- ing rapidly down towards him. Aleck Lay had never spoken unkindly to the boy; on the contrary, the graceless imp had received from both brothers pleasant jests, friendly notice, and donations which were innumerable by his arith- metical powers. There was no conceivable reason why he should fear to encounter either of them, if his conscience were void of offence as was their conduct--yet he stood stock still for an instant, eyes starting from their sockets, staring at the advancing terror;--then, seized, as braver men-ay, and brave armies have been since--by an un- reasoning panic, he darted to the road-side fence, scrambled over it, and scampered across the field beyond, fast as his legs could carry and fear could drive him. "Hallo-there! Gabriel! I want to speak to you!" called Aleck, who by this time was near enough to identify the flying figure. Gabriel ran on'the faster, looking over his shoulder to see whether he were followed; and, irritated at his contumacy, ,Aleck put Hero at the fence, cleared it, and galloped over the fallow ground upon the fugitive's track. A race so un- equal could not last long. "Stop I you scoundrel! or I will ride you down,!" came so distinctly to the boy's ear that he again glanced back, to calculate his chances for gaining the next and a higher fence. \              K jt   Not'a dozen yards in his rear was his pursuer; his orbs Xof fire seemed to scorch his sight, even in that brief glimpse; before he could' run ten steps further, the horse, whose streaming mane, glaring eyeballs, and open mouth, gave him the aspect of a demon, would be upon him. He yelled with affright, and dropped prone upon the earth. "You young villain!"Aleck leaned from his saddle, and grasping the boy by the collar, dragged him to his feet. "You audacious rascal! what do you mean by running    ! away from me when I order you'tot stop?" "Lor' a massy, Mars' Aleck! is it you? I 'clar 'fore gr&a cious I thought 'was an evil! I 'most skeered out of my senses!" stuttered the victim, affecting the uttermost aston- ishment.                         ' His captor was in no humor to be amused. "If I served you right, I would flog you soundly!" he pursued, giving him an admonitory shake, under which Ga- briel staggered more than was at all necessary.- "You   - knew me perfectly well before you started to run. If you want to save your bones, tell me the exact truth in answer Ii to the questions I am about to ask you."  '"Yes, sar!"  Gabriel surveyed the heavy hunting-whip in the rider's hand with an air of serious reflection. "You brought a letter tovMr. Robert Lay, on Christmas morning. Who sent it?"  "How   was I to know, Mars' Aleck?" whimpered tho hypocrite, the picture of aggrieved innocence. '"I didn'tsee i it wrote." "Who gave it to you?"Aleck tightened his hold on the collar and raised his whip. "I'm not to be trifled with, boy!" Gabriel studied the lowering visage above him,       i "If you won't tell on me, sir! IDey said dey would kill I me ef I let on a word, an' what dey says, dey will do, Mars' X Alec*i                           "   JOLONEL FLOYD'S WARD8       249 "So will I! you may be sure of that -! What did you do with the letter Miss Helen sent by you, which you promised so faithfully to carry safely?" "Wasn't dat de same I gave to Mars' Robert?" letting his under jaw drop, and looking as like a fool as he could. "I shall have to do it, I see!" Aleck jumped from his horse and clutched the liar's arm, his mien so full of wrathfulo determination that the last spark , of Gabriel's audacity expired. 'Ef you jes won't, sir, I will tell you all-every single thing!" he begged, quaking with fear. "Marster, he nab. bed me in de stable, while I was gettin' de horse ready, an says he, 'Gi'. me de letter!' and fore I knowed whar I was, Mars' Aleck, he had it in his hand, an says he to daddy, who had come in arter him-' Keep him here till I com back!? and he went to de-house.

"And that is all you have to say?" interrupted Aleck. "To whom did you give the note Mr. Robert Lay sent sack by your hand?"  "To daddy," the boy confessed, shame-facedly. "He-was waitin' for me at de fur gate, an I dar'sn't say 'no' to him when he speaks his mind.

"That is all now, is it?" interposed Aleck, as before. "Every thing, sir! I clar fore gracious I don't know  nothin' besides, and I never told a lie in my born days, only  'cept that once-" His auditor had other work before him than staying to : remind the pattern of juvenile veracity of the array of fibs he had endeavored to palm off upon him five minutes pre- . vious to this solemn asseveration.

ABOUT noon of the same day, a party of four horsemen halted in the public route to the Court House, at the entrance-if entrance it could be called-to a disused cart- road which led into the Belleview woods. There were still 'draw bars," that is, rails, that could be slipped back through their openings in their supporting posts-marking the spot where vehicles-wood-carts and farm-wagons- were once wont to pass in, but they were now moss-grown and decayed, and sumach and huckleberry bushes grew thickly on the other side. None of the band-hesitated, however, to follow their leader when he tore the rotten rails from their rests, and, remounting, rode boldly past the sign-board-a new and staring one, that forbade trespassing "under the severest penalty of the law." One pointed this out silently to another as they entered the gap, and the exchange of looks was pregnant with meaning. "That was put up the first week in January," said a third. "A queer time to warn off poachers. Especially when there is no game worth shooting in these woods at any season!" said his companion. The fourth man said nothing-only pushed on deeper into the forest. He knew well the position of the "Spruce- pine" and the " old picnic ground." The tree, the solitary specimen of the kind in the vicinity, stood on the verge of a little glade, a natural break in the wood, turfy, and not  too densely shaded, where, years ago, the young people for   252      COLONEL FLOYDS 'WARDS. miles around had held a sylvan fte--a bounteous dinner, and a dance on the grass that lasted until dark. Robert had danced with Lily Calvert, more frequently than with any other girl there, and Helen was oftenest his brother's partner. How strangely the vision of the holiday scene arose before the latter now, bent, as he was, upon a mission so fearfully at variance with the events of that midsummer day I  He was diverted from his saddened musings by the ex- traordinary conduct of his horse. He had ridden Hero that morning at flelen's desire. She fancied that she would be able to decide, upon seeing him now, whether he were the animal Booker rode upon that momentous Christmas day; and although, after hearing Gabriel's story, Aleck had not deemed it necessary to afford her an opportunity to apply this test to her memory, he had not cared, or indeed thought, to exchange the steed for his own riding-horse. He had gone by the most direct road to the Court House, laid his story before a magistrate, obtained a search-warrant, and authority to arrest the suspected man; collected a Tfew friends in those zeal and discretion he could confide-the magistrate asking permission to be one of the number-and, having despatched a line to Maple Hill, to allay the solicitude his wife might feel at- his prolonged absence, had set out for the spot designated in Lily's note. They had quitted the faint wheel-ruts that marked the windings of the old road several minutes before, and were making their way, still piloted by Aleck, in the direction of the spruce-tree, when Hero stopped short, threw up his head, and uttered a shrill neigh-a sound so expressive of terror, so like a human utterance of fear or anguish, that it thrilled every heart. "Is this the place?" asked one of the party, in an awed whisper, riding up close to Aleck's side.                    ,  . ;     ,            %   COLONEL FLOYDS8 WARDS.       253 's No! it is fully a hundred yards off! On, sir!" he urged the animal, and mad with impatience, forgetting that it was Robert's horse, and entitled to all gentleness of treatment at his hands, he struck him sharply with the whip. Hero rear- ed once, then stood like a rock, his fore-feet planted deep in the damp, woody soil, ears pointed forward, eyes dilate, and nostrils quivering widely-the picture of mortal fear., "There is something in this, Lay!" said the magistrate a grave, judicious man, whom no one had ever accused of excitability of imagination or a too ready credulity. '* Gen. tlemen, if you please, we will examine this ground, before going further!" ' Every man was upon his feet in a moment. The' nder- growth was thick thereabouts, and they literally 'crawled upon their hands and .knees in their anxiety to make the search thorough. Stones were upturned; leaves swept away, that the bare earth might testify of any recent disturbance; broken twigs and boughs inspected; but the keenest eyes discerned nothing unusual, nothing that varied from the ordinary aspect of a winter forest. Leaving their horses, they went on foot to the natural clearing marked by the evergreen spruce, and there the ex- amination was, if possible, more narrowly vigilant, and with a like result. There was absolutely naught to indicate that any deed of violence had ever marred the peaceful quiet of the pretty glade. The sun shone brightly upon the young: turf, already sprouting under the genial skies; and warm breezes of the past week; there were birds twittering in the naked branches above their heads; and as they drew to- gether in the centre of the grass-plot, for conference upon the next best step to be taken, a hare, the most timid of forest-bred creatures, scudded by on her way to her not distant form. "We must make the arrest without additional evidence,   254      COLONEL PLOYDrS WARDS. gentlemen!"' decided Mr. Reverdy, the magistrate. "Colo- nel Floyds possession of the watch and bonds must be ac- counted for, and the matter of the supposed forgery cleared up, before we can lawfully or conscientiously abandon the task we have undertaken." "It will be a bad business for us all if he gets clear, after we have brought so serious a charge," demurred one of the quartette-a nervous, cautious man, and a near neighbor of the Floyds. "The. colonel is a troublesome customer to manage, when his blood is up. I shouldn't relish being at enmity with him, if he is to go at large. He never forgives an affront." "Then, Mr. Dickson, you had better not accompany us!" rejoined Mr. Reverdy, in calm contempt. "For my own part, I shall probe this affair to the bottom, at any and every cost to myself. If no one else will go with us, Mr. Lay and myself will serve the warrant. Shall we return to our horses?" Murmuring something to the effect that he had been "misunderstood," and that he was as "little afraid as any other man," Mr. Dickson walked back with the rest. "Lay! this is certainly very singular!" said the foremost of them, going up to Hero and laying his hand upon his neck. The poor beast was covered with sweat, and shook in every joint. He responded to the friendly touch by another frightened neigh,- wild and piercing as the former; and when Aleck took him by the head to lead him on again, struck his hoofs deep into the earth and pulled back with all his might. They all gathered about him, in wonder- ment and inquiry.- Aleck was the first to remark that the creature paid no attention to their movements; that his eyes \ were fixed upon a cluster of saplings not four feet off. This they had examined more than once in their fruitless quest, ,           .I4   COLONEL FLOYDS WARDS.       55 but the change in his features now directed the attention of the others to the place. ' There are no pinetrees near! Those are hickory sap- lings! Why should the ground under them be covered with pine-needles!'"  The exclamation acted like an electric shock. All sprang forward to the work of clearing away the thick brown cov- ering, It was several inches in depth, and looked as if swine had been bedded there, daring the cold weather--an illusion that had completelyimposed upon the search-party, until they observed that the leaves could not have fallen from the trees above; andthe improbability that they had been brought from a distance for such a purpose, when the herd could as well havebeen-littered under the pines them- selves, presented itself to every mind. A hoe, spade, and pickaxe were hastily produced from a bag which was lashed to the front of Hero's saddle, and-while three used these to rake off the matted needles, the fourth scraped it aside with his bare hands. It was removed in less time than it has taken to describe the process, and there remained exposed a considerable area of lighter color than the black, rich soil around it, as if the earth had been carefully spread over a wide space, to avoid the appearance of elevation in any one spot. Near the middle of this was plainly visible a sunken spot, long and narrow, and perfectly regular in outline. Not a word was uttered, of commnand or remark, as each of the three men. bent to his work, and dug as If his own life or death de-' pendedl upon his diligence.  Of the three t The spade had fallen from the nerveless- hand of the fourth, and his next neighbor, he who had' labored with his fingers only, caught it ere it touched the ground, and struck it boldly into the soil. Sick with horror, Aleck leaned against a tree, and watched the rapidly   256      COLONEL FLOYDS' WARDS. dee  ng chasm at his feet;-noted the signs of a former excavation, in the leaves and sticks mingled with the earth they cast up. Would they have to dig far down?-and if so, would his strength and reason endure this racking sus pense until they reached it? The pit was already two feet deep, and the dirt lay com- pact as ever, settled by the snows 'and rains of two long winter months. Three feet! they worked well I Four!- they must' be nearing it.  Ha! how carelessly that man, plunged the pick-axe up to. the helve I Had he no thought of what he might strike- into what substance the keen, cruel poin't might sink at any moment! Again he swung the implement in the air-and Aleck seized his arm convulsively when he would have brought it down. "For heaven's sake, Dicekson! be careful! you cannot be far from it nowl" he cried, harshy. , None of the excited' laborers had realized their exact position before i but they- eyed- the dimensions of the pit now with careful, wondering attention, and' the man who wielded the pick stepped one side and laid down the dan- gerous instrument. The others kept on with their taslr, but delved warily, more slowly-scraping instead of dig- ging. The tedious process, necessary as he felt it to be-- their expression of watchfulness as each spadeful was re- moved-were more horrible than all that had gone be fore.  "This is dying by inches!" he whispered to Dickson, whc stood at his side; and he put up his hand to wipe away the cold beads that, dripping from his forehead, were literally 'blinding him. "My God!" The low cry broke from one of the workmen, and) at the same instant Dickson, clutched Aleck's shoulder, dragged   COLONEL FLOTD'S WARDS.      257 him; some paces before he could recover from his surprise at the movement.      - "You must not see this, Lay indeed you must not!" ret monstrated the neighbor, withstanding, with, friendly violence, Aleck's struggles to escape from his hold. S "Sit here!"He, pushed him down upon the trunk of a fallen tree---"Sit here, until I go and see whether it is best for you to be there!" Misled by the apparent obedience of his' charge, he ran back to the grave. A grave, in truth, it .was, and within it a figure, from whose features gentle hands were that moment withdrawing the only shield between it and the, earth--a coarse, gray blanket spread over the body, after the manner of a pall. Unchanged, save by the pallor of death, he slept there peacefully, as if loving, and not bloody hands had laid him down to his long rest; as if a costly coffin had sheltered his mortal frame from the contaminating touch of his mother earth, and costly marble sought to immortalize his name and memory.- A hollow groan caused the beholders to look up, and Aleck Lay's white face was seen leaning forward beside Mr Dickson's, turned for one second to the blue, smiling heavens, and his arms were tossed aloft, none doubted, in agonized in, vocation of Divine vengeance upon the murderer; then, he spoke in accents more stern than sad- , "Lift him out I Mr. 'Dickson, your house is nearest; will you ride over and send some conveyance in which the body can be carried to Maple Hill? Frank! .you will stay here until he returns, then'gallop ahead, and prepare my wife for what she must see-that is, if I am not at home myself by that time. I will exchange horses with you; I think that mine will follow him. Mr. Reverdy, if you are ready, we will go cirect to Belleview."   258      COLONEL FLOYDIS WARDS. They left the corpse upon a bed, hurriedly musTce of dry leaves-a cloak wrapped about it and concealiwg :t, save where one curl of fair hair, escaping from the folds, caught the reflection of the afternoon sun-Frank Travis, a cousin -of the Lays, and .Robert's bosom friend, and the faithful J' Hero, its only guards. NOTz.-It may interest the reader to know that nearly every incident relative to Robert Lay's murder had its counterpart in a case which came within range of the au- thor's personal observation. The most important variations in the history, as here narrated, are the needful changes of dates, names, and locality. No portion of the story is more authentic than the phenomenon of Hero's behavior when in the vicinage of the hidden grave, and the discovery of the body as a direct sequence of the hors,'s remarkable conduct.

He had business to transact with a man who lived ten or twelve miles of, and he grumbled loudly at his wife's negligence, and cursed the cook's laziness in not having breakfast precisely at half-past seven, according to the mandate he had issued over night. "Lily, my love, you are eating nothing!" said Mrs. Floyd, solicitously, as she witnessed her niece's want of application to the tempting repast. "I am doing very well, thank you, mamma!" and the girl made a feint of using her knife and fork. 'i Colonel! I wish you would call at Dr. Bryan's as you arei passing through the village, and ask him to drop in to see her," pursued the aunt. , "What's the matter with you?"Snarled .the master of the household, addressing Lily. "Nothing, sir. I feel quite well-the warm weather makes me a little languid-that is all!" she answered. But the slight agitation occasioned by his harsh, abrupt query, brought a tremor to her lips and tears into the large eyes, now sadly sunken and unnaturally bright. Her uncle scrutinized her sneeringly. "Which means that you are lovesick, and have the vapors! Vastly pretty and interesting these look to young- er men, but I don't believe that Dr. Bryan will admire them any more than I do. I sha'n't :be home to dinner,   COLONEL FLOYD'S: WARDS. Mrs. Floyd," and having made these affectionate adieux, he stalked out.  "Nine o'clock! What is that confoundedly slow fellow lagging about now, I wonder?" he uttered, stamping upon the fiont steps. "Dick!" he hailed a boy in the kitchen door. "Tell Booker I am waiting for him. Make haste, yotx rascal! Do-you hear?" "Yes, sar!" The colonel waited, nevertheless, for a quarter of an hour more, wVen the dilatory factotum emerged from his dwel- ling, at ate side of the yard, and came towards his irate master. "Come, Booker! called the latter, in a milder tone than he would hasv employed towards any other person guilty of the heinar's offence of delaying a departure he designed shouldc have l;tn immediate upon the termination of his morning meal.  Booker draov Lim everywhere, now-a-days. Since his apoplectic attat in December, Colonel Floyd seemed distrustful of his continued physical vigor or mental sound- ness. Booker had accompanied him during a week's ab- sence in January -a- manny whose direction and intent were not revealed to his cwa wife-which, Aleck had accident- ally discovered, extended as far as Baltimore.

Colonel Floyd followed, submissive as a child. "If you take my advice, sir, you will get ready for a very long jaunt," said the confidanit, meaningly. "If I ain't mightily mistaken, there's mischief in the wind-and a deal of it!" "Mischief! of what kind?" "The worst that could come 'pon you, sir; I'd better not mention it, even though there's nobody near enough to hear. Jeff Martin was here betimes this mornin', to say as how Mr. Aleck Lay stopped at his house yesterday, on his way back from Baltimore, and scared Jeff's wife-he was from home himself-into confessin' that I had left a strange horse thar, Christmas day. The. woman wouldn't allow to Jeff that she had told any thing, but one of the children was listenin', and let on to his father what a fine gentleman she had had for a visitor. Jeff gave her a proper lesson how to hold her tongue hereafter, you may be sure, but that didn't undo what was done." "Well?" Colonel Floyd-his complexion purple-gray-was biting his nails, and grinding his heel into the turf, in a frenzy of anxiety, Booker's tone and look were dull to stolidity.  "That's one; item, sir. Another that I've just picked up is, that Mr. Aleck Lay overtook that boy of mine, Gabriel, on the road, about an hour, or may-be an hour and a half ago, rid him down, and flogged him within an inch of his life, till the young fool was obliged to tell him that the letter he carried to Greenfield before breakfast, Christmas morn- ing, wasn't the same Mr. Lay's wife that is now-Miss Hel- en that was-had given him. The boy swears this was all   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. that he got out of him, and considerin' that I've been thrash- in' him for half an hour, off and on, to find out the truth, it may be as he says. Now, sir, I think you'll 'gree with me when I say that, in my 'pinion, Mr. Lay has struck a danger- ous scent-one that'll most likely bring him this way before night, and you'd better not be found too easy. Eight miles' ride will take you to the ferry, and by going six mile on the other side of the river, you will strike the railroad. I've got no more advice to give, 'cept that you'd better have a few clothes and a plenty of money along. It's lucky yo 're not short of cash just now-and oh! before I forget it, col- onel--you'd as well leave me a hundred or so, for family ex- penses, while you're gone." The unsurpassed effrontery of this address in the mouth of a menial-the fellow's bold, insolent visage, and disregard of all the forms of respect he had hitherto affected to ob- serve in his master's presence, passed unobserved by; his horror-stricken auditor. Filled with one overwhelming conviction; to wit, that his sin had found him out, and that his one chance of safety lay in precipitate flight-a disor er- ed recollection of his conversation with Aleck Lay upon the preceding day, combining with Booker's revelationsi to heighten his dismay, he ran up to his room, his so-called servitor at his heels; with his assistance, packed a valise with clothing; took from his secretary bank-notes and gold to a large amount-how obtained, the cashier of the bank, Baltimore, could have told-secreted these about his person; in blind, obedient haste, placed in Booker's hands the sum he required, and they were back again upon the piazza, in the buggy, and driving off ere any member of the family discovered that they had not set out at the hour originally appointed.  ( Colonel!"'screamed Mrs. Floyd, hastening out from the diinig-room.   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.     263   Booker reined up, and the meek spouse bustled down the steps to the side of the vehicle. "My love, Lily would like to go to the court-house this forenoon, just for the ride, you know, and I think the air and exercise will do her good. Can she have the carrnage and Simon?" "She and you can go to perdition, if you like!" foamed her husband. "Stand back! Drive on, Booker!" The whip was not spared during the earlier stages of the journey, nor was there much conversation between the travellers so long as they were in their own proper neighborhood, regarded by them as peculiarly perilous. They were within sight of the river, when Colonel Floyd inquired:                    * "What do you intend doing, Booker?" "I shall go back home, sir," with a flourish of the lash about the horse's ears. "Won't that be unsafe?" "For me, do you mean, sir?" "Certainly. You may be taken up as an accomplice. Had you not better stay with me?" "No, sir!" returned the man, impudently. "That would be the unsafest course for us both! Why, it would double the chances of being caught 'Twould be the easiest thing in creation to track a gentleman travellin' with a body- servant.

"You will not turn informer, Booker? That would be a bad day for you, my man!"   264'      COLONEL FLOYD S WARS.,  The negro half laughed at the impotent menace; the ludicrous pretence of the power of revenge from one so completely in his power. The sneer made that moment the most hnmiliating-save one-of Colonel Floyd's existence, yet he could not resent the insult. As to the matter of that, Colonel Floyd, we won't argue who would be worst hurt by what I could tell. But make yourself easy, sir. My evidence could not hang you--" "Hush!" The other started at the word, and looked around to be sure no one was within hearing distance. "Could not injure you very badly, I mean, sir-I am a colored slave--you a free white man"-with a scornful emphasis. "They wouldn't swear me in a court of justice, cSir t It was pitch dark when Booker re-entered the outer gate of the Belleview plantation. He had contrived his journey so as to arrive at home under the shadow of night. The sky was cloudy; the air misty, ,Better opportunity of con- cealing his approach could not have been desired; and congratulating himself upon these, he drove-carefully down the middle of the road, eyes and ears on the qui vive for any suspicious appearance or noise. There were lights in the windows of the dining-room, and iMrs. Floyd's chamber, and from the open kitchen-door issued a stream of reddish light, darkened occasionally by a moving figure within. A slave in name alone, he had long cherished ambitious dreams unknown by others, divined least of all'by him whom he styled&"master." By dint of peculation and undisguised extortion, he had amassed a larger sum than was possessed by- any other bondman in the country; treasured it secretly against 'such time as he should see the way clear for the prosecution of his darling scheme--viz: the acquisition of his freedom, without expending one cent of his money in   C00LN0EL FLOYDB WARDS.       265. itst purchase. Now, he said exultingly to himself, was the propitious season I His master a fugitive under the ban of the law, the hue and cry of the neighborhood directed after him-himself the owner, or what, in his ethics, amounted to the same thing--the possessor of an additional sum, sutient to carry fiim to Canada, if he wished to go so far-what remained to be done but to secure his hoard, and such valua- bles as he could lay his hands upon, and flee under the cover of the favoring darkness? "Whoa--there!" said a deep voice at his very ear, and betwixt him and the kitchen door he saw the dark outline of a horseman;-before he could reaTize the fact of the-ap- parition, he felt the reins snatched from him on the other side ; heard the trampling of hoofs and men's feet in every direction, while murmurs of inquiry and consultation were defined into a simultaneous iexclamation as-a lantern was unceremoniously flashed into his face. "We've caught one of them, at all events."  He had not expected the indulgence of sleep that night, but neither had he anticipated lodgings in the county jail., It was not often that Lily ws- allowed the privilege -of a ride without the attendance of her aunt or one of her cousins, but this morning she had avowed frankly to Mrs. Floyd her desire to visit Helen Lay, and asked for the car- riage and driver,- that she might: carry her plan into ,ex- ecution in her uncle's absence.  "He would not consent to it, mamma, and- you disap- ' prove of it,' I know, but I must see Helen! - I feel some. times as if I must die unless I learn something -which she only can tell me. I am not so strong as -I used to be, and things worry-oppress me more than they did when I was well."  Mrs. Floyd's heart melted   .      - . "My dear child! I would do aoy-thing in my power to          ,    COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. make you happy-but I really thought that you and Helan had had some quarrel about the time she was married, and not been on goocdtertls since." "I behaved foolishy, and, I believe, was altogether in the vrong,"-answered Lily, sadly. "Helen used to be very kind to me. I think she cared for me then. Nobody loves me -very long!" This pathetic petition it was that emboldened Mrs. Floyd to stay her husband's departure for the space of a whole minute and a quarter, and Lily decided to avail herself of the uncivil permission that responded to the request. Pitying affection was Helen's predominant feeling for the erring, cruelly deceived child, yet she had rather, on this particular day, have seen a basilisk creep into her sunny parlor than Lily's wasted figure glide up to the window where she and Aunt Ruth sat at work;--the younger lady pensive and abstracted, yet trying to appear as usual; the elder mild and sedate, quite content with the world since she had witnessed the affectionate parting of her adopted children after their early breakfast, and learned that it was Helen's headache that made her so pale and her eyes heavy -not inward disquiet-or disappointed love. "Yes!" ejaculated the dear old creature, dropping her spectacles upon the floor, Lily's entrance having occurred at the moment when she was resetting them for some super- latively fine-stitching upon a collar for her nephew. Lily understood the " article" as well as Aleck or Robert could have done. "It is I,l Aunt Ruth-not my ghost!" "Lily!" said Helen, rising to embrace her, "dear child I how long it is since we, have seen you!" I know it; Nelly, but it has not been easy for me to get here until now. I have longed for you lately." Helen seated her in a lounging-chair, removed her muf- flings, and smoothed the pale gold hair, gazing on the altered   I   COLONEL LOYD'S WADS.      267   lineaments of the lately happy, thoughtless girl, with- an unspoken heart-ache. Aunt Ruth picked up the key-basket and trotted out. "Helen," said Lily, catching both her hands, and speak ing with feverish energy-" now that we are by ourselves, tell me-have you heard any news of him-of Robert?" Helen shook her head mournfully. "Have you no idea where he is? What does your hus- band think has become of him?" "He has a variety of surmises, Lily dear. It would do no good to repeat them-they are all so uncertain, as yet. We are both much distressed at his continued absence. It seems unaccountable, and he was not apt to do unreasonable things," rejoined Helen, commanding her looks dhd language to the best of her power. "Why do you say 'was?' He is as good now as he ever was. I have faith in him, although all the world may blame him-faith to believe that he would do nothing dishonorable - or unkind. Yet his silence is breaking my heart-breaking my heart!" She bowed her face in her hands with a sobbing, plaintive cry that sounded indeed like very heart-break. Helen took her in her arms as she would have done a child. "Dear Lily! my sweet little sister! there is some cause for the silence that we cannot now understand-but it will be explained in time. I have all confidence in Robert's excellence and honor-and so has Aleck." "Then you don't blame him?"Lily smiled faintly through her tears. "We do not consider that he was in fault in any particu- lar. The trouble was, according to our belief, that he trusted unwisely and was betrayed-" "Not by me!" cried Lily, in alarm. "My great sm was o  - COLONEL, FLOYD'S WARDS. loving him too well and envying you because of that love. I did wrong you often in thought, Helen! There were seasons when I was tempted to do it; indeed, of many little acts of spite I was guilty f but I never committed any overt deed against your peace until the day you were married. Then I received his letter-and, dizzy with the hopes it opened up to me, I forgot honor, truth, every thing except him and the blessed assurance that he loved me. I would have gone to him, but my uncle overtook me on the way." :"I know!" said Helen, gently, for the girl's bright eyes and rapid incoherence of speech made her uneasy. "You need not enter upon a vindication of yourself, dear. Let by- gones be bygones. If I have any thing to forgive, it is for- given, provided you forget the heart-burnings and misun- derstandings of that unhappy time. Let us keep up hope- ful hearts for the future, and if sorrow should come, help one another to bear it." "Only aglass of milk punch, dear!" cooed Aunt Ruth at Lily's right ear, "with an egg beaten up in it to make it nourishing! You ought to drink one every morning of your life at this season. These warm days are debilitating." "She set dowi a salver, containing, besides the glass of punch, a plate of light cakes, and a saucer of calves'-foot ielly with cream poured over it. "To make it more strengthening," she represented. "Ahl Aunt Ruth -yu were always a sad child-spoiler!" said Lily, with a flash of her old archness. She sipped the creamy foam mantling the cordial. "It is the genuine old receipt, isn't it? Do you remember how often you came over to Belleview to make it for me, when I was recovering from the measles? and how, after I had that tedious spell of fever, you, carried me off by main force to Greenfield, and kept me there for a week, cosseting me with all man- ner of good things? I couldn't have been more than eight   /   I   years old then, and was such a wee thing that Robert used to draw me about in his go cart, as if I were a baby. Aunty, it would have been a happy thing for me if I had diedcof that fever-don't you think so?" Aunt Ruth looked thunderstruck at this, according to her principles, impious observation. "Why, my love,' she commenced, when Helen spoke up cheerily. "Nonsense, little one! you will change your mind when you have finished yotur luncheon. You need something to make your blood rich and warm, and then you will feel no proneness to misanthropy." "It is very nice to be here!' murmured Lily, gratefully, obeying the injunction to refresh herself with the delicacies provided. "And here you shall stay for one while!" said Aunt Ruth, energetically. "After you have drunk the punch, you must come with me to my room, and lie down until dinner-time." "Oh! I dare not keep the horses so long!" objected Lily. ' Uncle is to be away until night, it is true, but he would be angry if he heard that Simon had lost a whole day's work." "If that is the trouble, we will send him home, and Helen or I will ride over with you this afternoon in our carriage," persisted Miss Ruth, never doubting Helen's cordial -ac quiescence in the arrangement, and bent upon affording " the poor baby," as she pityingly termed Lily,-a holiday-and trying the effect of an abundance of "nourishing". food upon the wan face and attenuated frame. Lily was evidently strongly tempted. "Would it do, Helen?" she asked. "You are the proper judge of that, dear," said Helen, very kindly. -  She dreaded lest any display of her opposition to tho plan shouldbbe attributed by Aunt Ruth or Lily to an indis. *. g   270      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. position to entertain her cousin in her own house-yet trembled at the thought of the tidings which the next hour might brihg.,  Lily took in the mainer, more than the matter of the reply, and deliberated a moment. I will stay," she said. "It may be an age before I have another such chance of happiness." "Yes " said Aunt Ruth, triumphantly, without in the remotest degree assenting to the sentiment of the last clause of her pet-child's remark. "Now when you have given Simon his orders, you shall go and see what a beautiful room Aleck and Helen have given me. There is a nice, soft lounge, where you shall lie, and I will tuck you up snugly for a fine nap. The punch will make you drowsy, pretty soon. That's the good of it."  "A clear case of involuniary intoxication!" laughed Lily. "Then I suppose I had better use my limbs while I have any control over them-hadn't I?" and she went to confer with Simon. v  The lounge justified Aunt Ruth's recommendation, and so did the punch. F- For awhile, Lily lay enveloped in the soft shawls Miss Ruth had tucked about her shoulders, and watching the placid, motherly countenance, whose eyes, ,ever and anon, strayed from her work to herself, in tender solicitude. Therewas: a clear little fire upon the hearth, and by Aunt Ruth's footstool, a gray cat, sleek and sleepy; the clock ticked as if it too were drowsy. Lily wondered whether this were owing to some peculiar knack which Aunt Ruth had in winding it, and, amused at the conceit, sank into a slumber. She seemed to have slept but a few minutes when she awokeand saw that she was alone in the chamber. The clock said-that her " fine nap" had lasted two hours. "Aunt Ruth has gone to see about dinner, I suppose I' *   *..        ,    COLOXEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       271 she thought. "I am glad she didn't stay here on my ac. count. Her lounge must b  stuffed with poppies. I only wish I had one like it at'home!" She sighed at the recollection of the many sleepless nights that had been her portion for weeks past; drew back a cur- tain that she might have more light for her toilette; brushed, her hair; replaced her collar, and was ready to rejoin her friends. There was an empty chair just outside the door--  and, lying upon the seat, an unfinished piece of knitting. work-a coarse blue worsted stocking. "Isn't that like Aunt Ruth? She stationed one of her maids as a sentinel to prevent my slumbers from being dis- turbed, and the poor girl grew weary with waiting for me to release her., No wonder Il" She went down a flight of stairs and through a side-pas- sage, without encountering a single person. In her igno- rance of the topography of the house, she had taken a private way, one seldom used except by the servants in carrying wood, water, etc., to the several rooms. Then she reached a porch--enclosed on three sides by the wings and central building, and on the fourth by Venetian blinds; and amused at her mistake, resolved togo on until she found some in- habited region, unclosed the door at the other end of this recess, and found hIrselfin a small, dark entry, another door just ahead of her. This series of contre-temps Aunt Ruth and Helen had done every thing that seemed necessary to prevent. The maid posted at the chamber door had strict orders to remain there until Miss Calvert awoke, and then to conduct her to Mrs. Lay's own room, there to await that lady's coming. But thegirl, who had her share, and possibly more, of Eve's foible, had been seduced into a shott absence. To do her justice, it was very brief, for while Lily was wandering in the by-ways of the rambling old house, her janitor, ignorant   27a      COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS. of the prisoners flight, was sitting in the chair without Miss Ruth's apartment, knitting and listening dutifully for any sound from within. The parlor and main hall were peopled with gentlemen who would inevitably have arrested Lily's progress, but by her blunder-perhaps we should say through. the design of an inscrutable and higher Will than that of short-sighted mortals--she had avoided'all these hindrances, and now stood at the outer entrance of the library, Mr. Lay's especial study. Still smiling at her, adventure, Lily laid her -hand upon the lock, and went in. Her motion was very fairy-like and noiseless, and her approach was unheard by the occupants of the room. A solemn group was collected there. Aleck Lay, his features settled into stern anguish, stood with one arm upholding the drooping form of his wife, who wept upon his shoulder, at the back of a sofa which was wheeled into the middle of the apartment. I In front of it knelt Aunt Ruth, hands clasped as if in prayer, her furrowed cheeks bathed in tears, and eyes steadfastly bent upon the visage of him! who was stretched upon the couch. A black oloak- the same that had been thrown over him when first disin- terred, hid the earth-stained garments-only the face and bright hair were exposed, and these, Lily's second step for- ward revealed to her horrified vision . -      -  '   COLONEL FLOYDTS WARD8.       273 , . . - CHAPTER XVIIL ANOTHERI Christmas Eve, frosty and starry, was upon the - earth-and through the fading light shed from the lately crimsoned West, Aleck Iay rode slowly; up the, winding avenue leading to his home. Greenfield was his' now, also, but he preferred a continued residence in/the house to which he had brought his bride, one year before. There were associations connected with the paternal mansion, that bot] he and Helen felt would rest, a perpetual moveless shadow upon the brightness of their hearth-stone. Very rosy anc cheerful looked the radiance from this now, through thE windows of the old place, and as the smile of cheer avid welcome caught his musing eye, he quickened his horse's gait. "All well, Caesar?" he asked of the man who held the rein, as he dismounted. "All well, sir!"       ; i Aleck glanced into the dining-room in passing, and-spoke a kind word of greeting to the plump figure attired n.  black, which, knitting-work in hand, -was overlo6oking the movements of the butler, while he laid the snowy damask table-cloth for supper. "Helen is- in her room, I suppose?" he added. "Yes!" and to her chamber he proceeded accordingly. She had heard his step in; the .hall, and met hi'm at the door with -a smile and kiss of right wifely affection,. But the smile was chastened by sadness or thought-a slight # '    274      COLONEL FLOYD S WARDS. cloud that did not disappear even when she stood with hnim by a cradle at 'the corner of the hearth, and saw him stoop to leave a kiss upon the sleeping face of his first-born. '"Bfow are you feeling to-night?" he asked, fondly, after they were seated, her hand in his. "I am very well. Aunt Ruth says I may eat my Christ- mas dinner with the rest of you, to-morrow. I am quite strong again now, and shall be more cheerful when I can go about the house as usual,-especially when I can breathe the outer air." "I am glad you are to take your old place to-morrow. It will brighten greatly the gloom that must always recur upon the sad anniversary-sad-inexpressibly mournful in the recollection of one event-while it commemorates to me another-that has proved the best blessing, the richest hap- piness of my life. Joy and woe have flowed closely together, yet in divided streams, in our married life, darling." "I have been thinking of it as I sat here alone in the twilight, and reviewed the scenes of last Christmas, said Helen, a tear starting in her eye. "Then, my anxiety to hear the report of your visit of this afternoon has been pain- ful. Was the interview a trying one to you?" "Are you well enough to speak of these things, love? Had we not better postpone the discussion to another day?"' "Not on my account! As I have. said, the anxiety and uncertainty do me more harm than a full knowledge of the truth could. How. did the wretched man appear?" "ike what you have called him-wretched-miserable beyond comparison!" "And. penitent?" interrogated Helen.

That his forgery-of Robert's name was not his first essay in that species of crime, he avowed with infinite coolness. From his youth the facility with which he could. imitate any manuscript presented to him, had been a mighty temptation to him, ' the impulse to employ the unfortunate talent for some practical purpose,'-- I quote his exact words-' had been well-nigh irresistible.' His- pecuniary difficulties had proved the incentive to this ' error,' in every instance,--and he rambled off into an in--' supportable lamentation over the mortifications and hardships to which these had subjected him, until their accumulation and pressure drove him almost to insanity. -Your fortune was imprudently risked in speculations that, 'promising in   Zi O0 WULO NBL FLOYD'S WARDSB thei'r, commeicement, eventuated unsuccessfully.'

"Oh! horrible.!" cried Helen, shuddering. "Was his conscience then altogether dead?" ^"His rulling consideration then was to avert suspicion; to account to the community for the disappearance of one whose absence must, before many hours elapsed, excite uni- versal surprise.) To effect this purpose, he could imitate, with a true and cunning hand, the style and writing of our poor brother, append his name to the letter, and detise a iplan by which it should reach me, without implicating the author in the remotest degree.* "His -account of the concealment of the body in the bushes, and Bookers being sent off with Hero to the free negro's house, as well as the large bribe paid to the latter to undertake the secret service required of him, without asking any questions, tallied with that given by Booker him- self, and by Jeff Martin, at Booker's trial. He alluded, likewise, to the circumstance of the seemingly miraculous preservation of the corpse for so long a time, which was owing, he supposed, to its having been nearly or quite frozen when it was interred. But to these details I could not listen, nor shall you." "You said that you convicted him of premeditation in what he did?" said Helen, inquiringly. "Yes! I happened to-mention Booker's confession.

He was cognizant of several things that you have not admitted--as, for instance, the letters sent to the post-office in Washington and Vicks- burg, for remailing to my address.' "' It would be sheer folly for me to deny that his informa- , tion was correct in that particular,' he, remarked, without a sign of shame. 'It was a needful stratagem, Mr. Lay. The first wrong step involved the necessity of the rest.' "AIAid  what do you say, I proceeded, to another part of your man's evidence, wherein he stoutly affirmed that although he knew that you meditated some iniquitous measure, he was not aware that it was so great a crime as murder, until you called him to take the horse, after you had killed the rider'? . "' It was a lie-an infamous lie!' he exclaimed, thrown off his guard by the question.

I. can stay here no longer. It would be worse than useless, for each falsehood makes heavier the load of your sin.

'The circumstances of her birth were peculiar, and without doubt predisposedher to this malady. She is harmless, is she not?' u She is, perfectly, I answered. "' But idiotic-hey?' "Indignant at this cool questioning, I said that it was rather a partial failure of certain powers of mind, a loss of memory upon many points and a weakening of the higher intellectual faculties; repeating, in effect, my former declara- 'tion that she was now a child, with occasional lapses into a gentle melancholy, more painful to us than it appeared to be to her.  "I cannot but consider her state a blessing instead of an affliction; I concluded, when we remember the events that robbed her of reason. "'Ah! she was predisposed to it!' he reiterated. 'I always dreaded some such calamity to her. Is it your in- tention, may I ask, Mr. Lay, to continue to take care of her --or will you send her to an asy4um?' "Neither my wife nor myself will ever consent to part with her, unless her health should require a change, I said. As to an asylum-we are assured by the best medical authorities upon these points, that no beneficial effects to her could arise from her residence in one. "Desperately hardened as I knew him to be, I was not prepared for his next observation--  "'You may not be aware, Mr. Lay, that my niece has no property of her own-that she will be a great expense to you?'  "That does not alter my resolution, sir! I replied haughtily.

Such a ghastly grimace as it was! "' I think that my mind wanders slightly sometimes, Mr. Lay. You will excuse any incoherence or strangeness in my language or behavior.

After all, what was done so many years since, in the heat of passion, and under extreme provo- cation-we were both fiery tempered-what was done then cannot be mended/now, andwhad better rest in oblivion.'" ;  "He must be deranged!" said Helen, wonderingly. "You would have thought so, had you seen him at that instant," replied her husband. "In another, he was himself again; desired me to give his love to Lily and his respects to you. 'Say to Lily,' he called me back to say-4 that I always intended to provide for her myself-if only as some atonement-but no! perhaps you had better not repeat the message. She might not understand it.' And thus we. parted." 'MayI-come in?"   A silvery voice at the door ended the pause that succeeded Aleck's strange, sad story. "Come in, dear!" said Helen, brightening up, and a di, minative figure in white crept forward on tiptoe.. &   .  '   COLONEL FLOYD'S WARDS.       283 Her beautiful hair had been shorn during the dangerous spell of brain-fever that had attacked her ten months before, and now clustered in short, golden curls about her colorless face. Her eyes were timid and soft, like those of a shy child, and her smile infantine in simplicity and sweetness of ex- pression. . She had taken an unconquerable fancy to wear white constantly ever since her illness, and her kindly guar- dians indulged her whim. To-night she had dressed herself in muslin, and binding her curls was a wreath of holly-leaves and berries. A knot of the same was in her bosom. "Good evening, Aleck!" she said, putting her hand con. fidingly in his, outstretched with an air of brotherly fond- ness he could not have shown her a year ago. "I am glad that you are home again. Did you remember that it was Christmas Eve?" "Remember!" thought he, with an inward groan. He smiled pleasantly at the querist. "Is that the reason you have made yourself so fine to-night, Lily?" "Yes I Sally got the holly for me, for I thought I had heard that people wore it on Christmas Eve. It looks pretty, dpesn't it?" "Very!" replied Helen, cheerfully. Lily surveyed herself in the mirror with lnatFected and guileless complacency. "And to-morrow night, Sally is to get me some orange; buds. I made her promise, if you liad no objection, Aleck. There are plenty in the green-house." "Why should I object?" asked Aleck. "' The flowers be- long to you and Nelly here, not to me." "Yes, but I had a notion that you did not like orange- blossoms ; or was it you, Nelly?" "Neither of us, I think," she responded. "It was all a 'notion,' little one." "It makes me very happy to hear you say so, for, do you   284      COLOInEL FLODS DWAnDS. know,- itouldn't  mits wearing them on Christmas -night on any account," sinking her voice to a mysterious whisper. t'iWho was it, Nelly, that told me that it would be a terrible thing not to wear orange-blossoms on Christmas?" "Another notion 1" Aleck hastened to dispel the cloud of .perplexty he saw gathering upon her brow. "What have you in your hand, Lily?" X "Oh!" she laughed out gleefully, "it is a pair of new socks for baby,. I knit them myself, on purpose to hang in the chimney-coner to-night. See!" ' They were united by a bow of blue ribbon, and she sus- pended them upon a hook at the left of the fire-place, directly above the cradle. Helen laughed. "I will venture to say that no younger 'gentleman in t]ee length and breadth of the land will hang up-his stockings this Christmas Eve. Why, Lily, he is but a month and two days old!"   . "He understands all I say to him!" retorted Lily, tri.  umplamtly *. "Look! he is awake! Don't you see that he laughs at me 1' The little arms tossed down the covering that bound them, and the babe actually smiled in the face bowed over his.  "He knows me best!"She patted the tiny face. "Lily's baby! Lily's pet!"And while father and-- motherlooked on with:smiling lips and moistened eyes, there came another name-breathed in accents orTsueh magical sweetness that one might have thought the child-woman had learned it from angel teachers. "rL'S ROBERTi "  A BATTLE SUMMER. .   A BATTLE SUMMER. CHAPTER I. "WHAT furiously hot weather!" puffed Mr. Bell, throw- ing open, yet more widely, his suimmer sack; said garment  being after the fqahion aptly named "skelethn," material white grasscloth, pure and sheer as muslin. "I never felt anything to exceed it."  j"It is terrible!" panted Mrs. Bell, vigorously plying a  palm-leaf fan. And so debilitating! I have not strength to move " "Insufferable! One really lacks the courage, if not the energy, to look at the thermometer to ascertain the real exr tent of our misery!" sighed Miss Georgiana Rose, Mrs.  Bell's sister. An impartial looker-on might have decided that the trio, thus unanimously condemnatory of the sunny June after-     i noon, were ungrateful for, and therefore undeserving of, the  i surroundings, that, for them, in somemeasure, alleviated -the fervent heat, of what the ruddy farmers were then praising as being " splendid growing weather." Mr. Bell had just dis-  patched a well-cooked dinner, served up neatly and promptly to meet the call of the appetite he brought up town with him from the hotter, because more compactly built, precincts wherein his store was situated. The fowls were tender and  juicy; the vegetables the best of their various kinds;     I (287)          1     A BATXYiJN bL U fVIMNI I. sauces rare and piquant, were at hand; fruits and ice-cream had composed the dessert, instead of steaming puddings, and oily, bile-engendering pastry. A lass of fine old wine, iced, of course, put the finishing touch to his feast, and his satisfaction in the same. The Bells had the reputation of being good livers, and were conscious that they deserved it. The husband was bountiful,-the wife tasteful and judicious. A capital table was the inevitable result of this combin a tion. Attired as we have described him, Mr. Bell leaned back in his own garden-chair, -he had tried a dozen before he found one that suited him "to a T "-his feet upon a camp-stool worked by his pet sister-in-law; a prime Havana between his lips, and gazing across intervening housetops and patches ofgreen, marking the treasured plots of turf and occasional trees, denominated by deluded citizens. "gardens," he sniffed the faint, briny air stealing up from the bay, flashing in the distance, and anathematized the weather. His station was upon a piazza shaded with vines; pots- of mignonette, wall- flowers, heliotropes, and geraniums were ranged around the balustrade, and filled the atmosphere with perfume. Yet he found the city "intolerable" in summer I Within the door of the sitting-room-cool, 'lofty, and cheerful, without being glaringly bright were two light, cane-seated sewing chairs, occupied by the ladies, his fellow-sufferers. Mrs. Bell's was a pleasant face, indicative alike of intelligence and amiability. She. wasnot more than thirty years of age, the mother of three: fine hildren, good-tempered and healthy like herself; and made an excellent and fond helpmeet to a husband who deserved and valued her, being a man of affectionate dispo- sition, sound sense, and comfortable worldly means. GIor- gianna Rose -"Georgia,'o her friends; ("Georgie, der," to her sister and brother-in-law; "Anntie," to the ]ttle Bells -was a pretty, blooming girl, of twenty, whose 1lue   organdie set off to the best advantage her clear complexion and pale-brown hair. "And {hat reminds me," resumed Mr. Bell, after a few pulls more at his choice weed, speaking with much appa- rent indifference, "I had a letter from Roaring River, to day.".  "Ah!" exclaimed the ladies, breathlessly. "What do they say?"  Whether the subject really interested him or no, it was evidently one of the highest importance-to them. "I will read the letter to you-; that is, if I hake it with me. I think that I put it into my pocket after gl ncing it over. But when one has an extensive business correspon- dence, minor matters are liable to be overlooked. I thought that you would .want- to learn its contents," answered the mastf of the house, with the characteristic equanimity of his set, when they witness any lively display of fermnine curiosity. The hypocrite knew perfectly well the precise poket, and the precise corner of that pocket, in whch he had bestowed the document in question. Instead of merely "glancing it over," and then tossing it by to return in thought to the major topic of "business, he had given it a careful perusal at the store, and a second reading in the omnibus, on his way up town. The subject of the communication had not really left his mind for five minutes at a time since is arri- val at home; yet, with the knowledge of all this ithin his brain, he felt a touch of compassionate amusement at the spectacle of the sudden animation his carelessly-uttered speech had begotten in the ladies. Without pretending to analyze the motives that prompted him to tdopt tfhis lie of conduct, I venture to affirm, in passing, upot the authority of one who has: made mankind something of a study, that any other gentleman with whom I have the hdnor of being  A BATTLE S[MFR. acquainted, would have pursued the same apparently mean- ngless policy n a similar case. As Miss Mitford's lisping baby-heroine, Dolly, summed up her experience of the class, Mianth ith all alike!" I am nat affecting to deny or excuse the fact that women do, occasionally, in circumstances of great provocation to the emotion, feel a thrill of curiosity, and that some of the weaker vessels do, say once in a lifetime, betray this in an unbecoming manner; but I dare to state that many of us could be as coolly incurious, and as dignifiedly chary of in- quiry as are our lords, if we had their opportunities of gain- ing information with regard to. passing events. One who has pressed up to the bulleti-board and possessed hiself of every article inscribed thereupon, can afford'to withdraw- satisfied leech that, he is - from the eager crowd, and smile, in genuine enjoyment of the fun at' the figure cut by the un- happy ignoramus. upon the outside ring of the throng, who, by diligent pushing, frantic leapings, and abject crouchings andpeepings, can only make out the capital letters, and-the string of exclamation points. like a shower of sky-rockets, which may mean either crowning triumph or irreparable dis- aster. ..

" From which of the s  istersisit? asked Mrs.; Be3l. "It is signed Jemima -Ketchum " was the answer. Horrors, what a name I ejaculated: the wife. "She writes a good hand," 'Mr Bell remarked. ," I should judge her to be a person of considerable culture.. Dr. Mol- eye told us, you rec9llect, that the ladies were educated and refined, and fine conversationists."  "'Dear Ronald! wnt you read the letter? We are dying with impatience!" pleaded Georgie.  Her brother smiled indulgently, and vouchsafed to end her suspense. ROARiaN  RIVER, JueT 10, 1860 "'MR. R. M. BELL: Dear Sir, -Your polite favor of the 1st inst. Was received four days ago; but we, my two sisters and myself, deemed it best to weigh your proposition seri- ously, as its importance merited, and not to respond to your inquiries until we could give a definite, and, if posible, a satisfactory reply. Otherwise, we might excite expectations which, after matur6 deliberation, we mnight find' it imprc- ticable or: inadvisable to gratify. While we are of course pleased with the favorable report of our mountain retreat given by our esteemed friend, Dr. Moleye, we are not sur- prised that he remembers with feelings of lively'delight; his sojourn in this charming region. We did all in' our power to render his stay pleasant, as we do with all our guests. We heartily reciprocate his expressions of good will' id agreeable souvenirs. Please remember us most cordially to him when you meet him. He is one of those rare spirits that once met are never forgotten." i       i "Mercy '! interupted Georgie.  "Who would have   292  -     A BATTLE S UMTR. thought that prosy old Dr. Moleye would have produced such an impression? That is a queer business letter, Ron!" 'CDont'be too quick to judge! ' We are coming to the business, now." And he proceeded:- "As he has informed you, my-dear sir, we do not keep a boarding-house. Our revered and ever-to-be-latmented father, one of the most respected- and substantial farmers in -this community, and who represented our native county for sev- eral; years in the legislature, left us at his decease, which occurred ten years-since, in the enjoyment of a modest com- petence that precluded all necessity of any exertion on our part to procure a genteel livelihood. We had not been brought up like most farmers' daughters, therefore had intel- lectual resources that effectually warded off ennui from our seclusion. But two years after the sad event that left us or- phans, our eldest brother having been elected to Congress, from this district, which office he filled with credit to himself and-his family, and at the expiration of his Congressional term being appointed to a foreign consulate, the principality of Smokenuff, and our younger brother leaving the paternal homestead for the great metropolis, namely, New York, we three sisters found the solitude of our lately merry home oppressive, and the more willingly acceded to the importuni- ties of an old and valued friend, Rev. Dr. W. Choken, of Edenvale, that we would receive him and his lovely and accomplished wife, with their six interesting children, as members of our family during the summer months."' The reader paused. "Georgie, dear, please hand me that glass of ice-water." "No wonder, you are out of breath! Are you sure there is not a stop in all that long sentence?" "Not one, except commas." "'We enjoyed their society so much that we allowed ourselves to be the more readily persuaded the ensuing sea-   wA BATT  E UMmR.        293 son, by other friends who proposed to become our. guests. My sisters were growing up, and I felt the need of cultivated associations for them. Thus we fell into the habit of extend- ing our family circle in the warm weather."' "On the principle that heat expands, I suppose! 'I said a new voice, and the reader became aware that Ahs family circle - had been enlarged by the quiet entrance of his next-door neighbors, his married sister and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Earle. "What bosh have you there, Ron?" queried the former of these two, continuing the tone of raillery that had arrested the reading. "The long-looked-for letter from Roaring River," ex- plained Mrs. Bell. "Humph!" "Tom!" said his wife, reprovingly.- "Don't mind him, Annie!" "I do not!" was the smiling reply.  "I know him too well to be seriously afflicted by his barking. Hie never bites. Now, sit down, both of you, and hear this somewhat diffuse epistle. It concerns you as well as ourselves." "And having waded through such a slough of sentimental reminiscences, we must be nearing solid ground  now, I think," said Georgie,. who was not more remarkable for patience than are most other spoiled children. She was never cross, however, with all her sauciness, inm which, it must be owned, she was encouraged by her lawful guardians. M  -r. Bell resumed:  "' Our airy and commodious suite of rooms is always in demand. Indeed, if pertinacious solicitations could win our consent to such a measure, our house would be crowded from basement to attic throughout the summer. But on this point, although generally over-indulgent, we are ada- mant. Our inviolable rule is, not to take more visitors than   A. BATTLE SUM14. we can accommodate with perfect and -entire comfort to themselves, id likewise to us. Our object, to sum up the whole matterin a few words, is not to make money; but to avail ourselves of the charming society of our guests, while affording them an opportunity of seeking health and recrea- tion, and, through these, happiness, among our noble moun- tains, and upon our fine river. Three of our apartments are already engaged to friends from the city, very refined and cultivated people. We have, fortunately, four others vacant, which we have no doubt will-meet your requirements. Two of these are spacious chambers, well lighted and admirably ventilated, and each capable of containing two beds. These, according to our estimate, will suit yourself and brother-in- law, since your sister, Mrs. Earle, would like to have her children in the room with herself, or in a chamber immedi- ately contiguous to hers. The third is smaller, and adjoins the apartment we have allotted to Mrs. Bell and yourself. This we design for Mrs. Bell's sister, the young lady of whom you'wrote. We anticipate much pleasure in forming her acqnaintance. We are all three naturally vivacious, and dearly enjoy the companionship of young persons.'" "Highly honored, I am sure!" murmured Georgie, in affected humility. "' Your oldest daughter might lodge with her. Then, upon the floor above, is a snug bedroom for your servant girls.' Our fare is, we flatter ourselves, irreproachable. Poultry and eggs we have in abundance; we make the best and sweetest of bread'and butter; raise our own lambs; cultivate our own vegetables, and have a well-stockea ice- house, while our river supplies us with all the fish we need. There are fine trouting streams two or three miles back of us; and in their proper season, woodcock and snipe abound in the swamps and along the watercourses near us. I men- tion these particulars as likely to interest gentlemen. We   strive to cater to the tastes of all. But we pride ourselves principally upon our magnificent (I had almost said, unsur- passable) mountain scenery, and the excellent roads con- ducting through it in*all directions. Travellers of refined and ennobling tastes (such as we -are assured are possessed by yourself, my dear sir, and your family connection) must ever experience genuine delight in traversing our elevated plateau, and ascending the grand range of cloud-capped sum- mits encircling it.' ' ' Whew!" whistled the impertinent brother-in-law. His wife tapped him with her fan as an injunction to silence. Mr. Bell laughed a little himself, and glanced down the sheet, as looking for something more practical; "Don't skip a word, I entreat!" petitioned Mr.  arle. "It is a rich composition, refreshes one on a hot day, )ke a glass of soda-water, all bubble, and fizz, and sirup! iPople of refined and ennobling tastes, such as we possess, can ap- preciate its beauties. That girl ought to offer herself as advertisement-writer for Hoofland's German  Bitters, or Macallister's Ointment. She would make more money than by taking boarders." That is not her object in taking boarders!" remarked Georgie, demurely,-the sparkle of fun in her eye abetting  Mr. Earle in his criticism. "Of course not! I wouldn't insult herby such an ins;n- uation. But, if it is not an impertinent question, Ron, what are we expected to pay; or, as I'll wager-any head she phrases it, what remuneration are we to be allowed to offer her for the unspeakable privilege of becoming members of her family, dwellers in her Happy Valley? My pocket- nerve quivers at the bare suggestion.' "It need not!  Mr. Bell named the terms in a tone of suppressed exultation.   i    They were, indeed, extremely moderate, as the other gen- tleman was compelled to admit., "Too moderate!"he said, shaking his head.  "There is a screw loowse somewhere. The sum is a lame and impo- tenet conclusion to that grand, eloquent epistle. I always distrust a bargain. Adjectives sell dear, generally."  "The price is low, I grant, for this latitude," replied Mr. Bell; 'but recollect that the cost of living in that section of country does not equal the expenses onemincurs here, by one- half. 'The most pleasant summer we have ever had, since our marriage, was passed in a quiet farm-house, where the- board was, a couple of dollars less per week than the sum charged by the Misses Ketchum." -"And the fare was delicious!" said Mrs. Bell. "Geor- gie, have you forgotten good Mrs. Worthley's light bread and golden butter? her gingerbread and apple-pies?" -No: nor yet her broiled chicken, fresh eggs, and plentiful supply of milk. What a sweet, restful summer that was!" exclaimed the world-weary girl of twenty. "I do hope that we are going to have just such another!" "'f this Miss What's-her-name is as -volubla with her tongue as with her pen, you will have anything but a restful time, I forewarn you," growled Mr. Earle. "It will be our fault if she gets many opportunities of annoying us in this way," remarked iMrs. Bell, cheerfully, "since we expect to pass much of our time out of doors. Dr.. 'Moleye stays the rambles in the neighborhood-- are delightful. And the trouting, Tom- think of that!"  "And the woodcock!" artfully suggested Georgie. '"And the boating--which she says is the favorite pastime of visitors," said Mrs. Earle, who had taken the letter from her brother, and finished its perusal in silence. , "Avaunt, all of you! Tempters of the flesh and mind!" 9,  .  .        .   A BAOTL E SUMMJR.        ZU4 called out Tom. c:; How dare you basely attempt to pervert a man's judment in this--style?" "Come, now, my dear fellow, let us be serious; examine the matter calmly and without prejudice," bego M'r. Bell, in a tone of mild argument.  ".We want a quiet summer retreat, where the ladies and the babies can have wholesome fare and out-door exercise in the mountain air; ,where you and I can row, swim, fish, and shoot to our heart's content; a place where, free from the shbackles of fashion and fashion;. able gayeties, we can really and truly have a holiday-a good, free-and-easy time, that will send us back to work in the autumn, invigorated in body, thought, and heart. This house is recommended to me by a physician -one: who has made personal test of its capabilities to suit our needs. I made further inquiries, and the result is entirely satisfactory, with she unimportant exceptions that Miss Jemima, the spokeswoman of the three sister, writes a needlessly long letter, in rather a highfalutin strain, and that she charges a low price for board. Candidly, does it not seem absurd to attach any weight to objections like these?"   - "Argued like a lawyer, Ronald!. I have but one bit of blunt, practical wisdom to oppose to all this fair show of reason, and you may have it gratis. It is just this: Himann nature is pretty much the same, the world over; and it is human nature to get, if possible, a fair compensation for whatever one has that is marketable. Viewed in this light, Miss Jemima's offer of all the comforts of a home; the edifying society of herself and sisters; her magnificent mountains, superexcellent roads; trout, woodcock, and boats, for the moderate sum she names, and the consideration of our companionship, is either a piece of egregious simplicity, or there will be found, upon experiment, a grievous defi- ciency somewhere. Now, the woman who wrote1that letter does 'not underestimate herself nor her abode.   The ,   ,probability--t6 my mind, the certainty- is that she las gone to the other extreme, and drawn more largely upon her imaginatiotn than upon her sight in sketching her picture. I distrust these mongrel establishments that are. neither private houses nor hotels. They ware generally miserable humbugs- traps for the unwary, who find, when it is too late, that'they have sacrificed the ease and quiet of their homes without garing the independence of a public house. As to taking boarders for company-just for the pleasure of the thing--that is all bosh!" And having reached the climax off his -protest in this, his pet substantive, Mr. Earle helped himself to a cigar from a case on the table; asked his brother-in-law for a light, and settled down comfortably in a straw chair, the fellow to/ that occupied by Mr. Bell. There was an uneasy pause, ended by Mrs. Earle. "What a croaker you are, Tom! You leave out of sight the fact that we need not stay longer than we like, should we become dissatisfied. We have always the privilege of leaving."  "That is mnore easily said than done, after we have engaged the rooms for the season, lost the chance of getting in elsewhere, and transported all our baggage a hundred miles oir so from' home, part of the way by private convey- ance." He held the letter by this time, and read aloud the postscipL:-            - "' The last twelve miles you will perform by stage; and since the road is steep and. rocky, you will require a more substantial conveyance for your baggage. It is our custom to send our own team of oxen and heavy wagon to the depot for this purpose, if notified of the precise day of our visitors' arrival. We shall be most happy to do this in your case." ,'   "Why in thunder does the woman persist in calling us   A A BATTLE SUMWT. ,Fi.   299   'guests' and 'visitors' and the like twaddle?" broke out the malcontent. "A  man who hires a room of her, and pays her for his breakfast, dinner, and supper, is a boarder, and nothing else!" No one took offence at this plainness of speech, nor were the Bells shaken in their purpose of rusticating at Roaring River. As Mrs. Bell had said, they were well acquainted with their friend's .eccentricities, and knew how little depth there waS to his apparent bitterness of criticinm. They laughed the matter off pleasantly, now, therefore, and during his stay talked of other things.  "We may safely leave him to Kate," observed Georgie, wisely, when their visitors had gone. ' She lets him talk as long and as loudly as he likes; but it always ends in his giving her her own way. She wants to go with us, and, however he may bluster, he '*ill not cross'her inclination.' "You understand these matters pretty well, I see, for one who has had no personal experience in that line," returned her brother. She raised herself on tip-toe to pinch his ear. "So well,' Mr. Saucebox, tha't I tell you now, inasmuch as your wife and sisters have made up their minds on this subject, you may as well write at once, and engage Miss Jemima's rooms.; I have a presentiment that we 5re to have great times this summer. Perhaps I may meet my fate: who knows?'"    CH APTIR i THAT Georgie had prophesied shrewdly as to what would be the family orderm in council, was proved by a scene that transpired three weeks after the reception of Miss Jemima's -letter. It was late in the afternoon of a showery July day. A muddy stage, built after the model of the Jersey wagon, contalning hfour narrow, straight-backed benches, toiled creak- ingly up a rough mountain road. Seated within were Mrs. Bell, two children, and nurse; Mre. Earle, with a dependent retinue of like- numbers and character; and Gergie Rose. Messrs. Earle and Bell were on the outer seat with the driver, and between his father's knees tood Master Harry Bell, the eldest hope of his parents, a manly little fellow of nine years, but whose present aspect was rather disconsolate. Saye Mr. Earle, none of the party wore a very cheerful air, The ladies were tired, heated, and damp, 'besides being uneasy as to the effect of. the humid atmosphere upon the children, who fretted and dozed alternately. Mrs, Earle's babe--a delicate boy just in the midst of the cruel maladies incident upon its second summer-was especially trouble- some. "Poor little lamb " said the kind-hearted nurse, trying to hush the piteous wail with which he started from a fitful slumber in her arms. "And is it much -furter we have to go, ma'am?  i  "I hope not, indeed, Nonah," replied her mistress; "for   A BATTLE SUIMMER.   he is very weary and hungry. Are .we nearly there, Ron- ald?" she called to her brother. '"We have but one mile more to travel," was the welcome response; "and the driver here tells me that there is a pretty view of the'house to be had from the top of the hill; so look out " There was a general brightening up of sober faces and straightening of bent forms; all eyeswere on the alert to catch the first glimpse of the desired haven. But disap- pointment awaited them instead, upon the snllimit of what they had trusted was to be to them one of the Delectable Mountains. What had appeared to be but awdense mist from a distance, changed, as they entered its gray folds, into a soaking shower. So sudden and' violent was its patter upon the roof of the vehicle, that the inmates had not time to lower the curtains, althugh these were but imperfectly fastened up, having been already unrolled three times during the ride of twelve miles, to avoid similar deluges. The air had reroaned so sultry, in spite of the rain, that so soon as the showers had abated, the unanimous cry had been, "Raise the curtains! We are suffocating!" Now the children were hastily huddled together in the centre of the startled group, and sheltered by the nurse's skirts. and shawls, while the ladies shrank from the spray that beat in upon them through the open sides' of the stage, Harry Bell disappeared under the leathern apron which the driver drew up as high as it would stretch, to protect himself and his companions on the front seat. "All the more merit in being jolly, Kate!"Mr. Earle quoted, turning his face, bathed and streaming with rain, towards his wife, she having uttered a cry of dismay. "I be- gin to believe that I am destined to be the Mark Tapley in this company of emigrants. As Georgie would say,' I have a presentiment' that I shall have occasion to 'come- out 26  A UAwJLJ lBl 1b U JVi rM . rIK strong' before our Roaring River experiences are con- cluded."  "I can bear any amount of inconvenience for myself," e- joined Mrs. Earle,anxiously. -But the water is dripping through the roof, and if the-children should get wet, you. know that we cannot procure dry clothes for them to-night. It-is-very strange that the team was Dot sent down for the baggage, as was promised." "Never mind!"  Mr. Bell said in consolation. "Thanks to your thoutghtfulness, in anticipating some such contre- temps their nighttdresses are all in the hand-trunk, and that is dry,; am sure; I put it under the back seat myself. We' will ask permission to take the forlorn little beings to the kitchen fire. Then, dry wrappers, a cup of hot tea, and a good nigh 'srest will set them all right.. Hold hard, all of you! there's a bad piece of road ahead!" He didnot slander the portion of the route they were now called upon to traverse. For Ihalf a mile rocks a foot high, and utsatw6 feet deep, with frequent slants to the right, then to the left,.until those inside :the wagon shrieked in mortal terror of upsetting and bone-breaking, kept every muscle on the strain and jarred every joint almost to dislocation. Thug they reached the bottom of the hill, where the patient moun- tain horses struck Xa trot upon a strip of level road, bounded on: one side by thick woods, on the other, by a- rude stone fence, inclosing a meadow and orchard; turned shaply in at an pen  ate, and- came sto a stand in front of a long, low house, emboweed in a grove of cherry-trees. Bothh babies were' cryi-g; both mother exaniing tender craniums and soft 'limbs, i ddreid" of finding bruises or fractures; both nurses soothing their hurt and frightened charges with the voluble' endeafnenite of their race. So confused, shaken to pieces, .an-gfi e ly miserable ere we all the juveniles, and the  e passengre of- the feminine gender, tht none of   them appreciated the truth that they were, at last, at their journey's end, until Mr. Bell opened the door of their muddy cage with a jubilant outhurst.  "Well, thank fortune, here we are, and our troubles are over!  Mrs. Bell alighted in a puddle of water that surrounded the yard-gate; but-she did not hear the sullen splash, or kow that her ankles were wet, so eager was her survey of, the premises - the Promised Land of Miss Jemima's epistle. It was but natural that her eyes should scan, with lively inter- est, the house that was to be the abode of herself and best treasures for the next two months; and it was^quite as inev- itable that a sensation of hearftsinking, bordering upon con- sternation, should succeed the leen, if hasty examinatithn. The building stood upon a dead flat, that looked like'a'hol- low, now that the eye had become accustomed to the more elevated regions over which she had travelled. It was but a story and a half high; the parlor floor might have been laid on the very ground, so near the earth did the lower windows seem; while the upper, overshadowed by the sloping roof, were just one pane deep. The establishment would have impressed a critical stranger as being an incom- modious and insalubrious dwelling for a 'private family of plain farm-people"- but a boarding-house! Mrs. Bell exchanged secret and rueful looks with 'Mrs. Earle, as they suprintended the upcking of their precious load, and Georgie-whispered,-- covertly sglial. g out the6folds of her sodden anid creased dress,- "Why, the piazas is crowded! I thought there wher t-o b only t'o or three peot ple here besides ourselves! I Wonderif there is no other entrance! -Must we run that gauntlet?" ' This question was speedily solved, to her dissatisfaction, by the appearance, on the one step of the piaet  of 'person age in 'whom the- new arrivals intuitively aind: sfiultite-   ously recognized Miss Jemima. She was a would-be y ung- ish-looking woman, plain in- attire, small in stature, with gray eyes, a large mouth, thin lips, and a turnedgup nose, ltogether the picture of an affected, yet shrewish spinster. The rain still fell slowly, and there was another pool of water, formidable in dimensions, at the base of the step; therefore she didjnot venture from beneath the cover of the portico. "Our guests from the city, I presume," she began, as the doleful cavalcade approached. "Mrs. Earle?" offering a bony hand to the foremost lady. "No? Mrs. Bell, then? Yes? I welcome you to our peaceful mountain seclusion! Mrs. Earle,- I take it for granted that I am right this time,- I am rejoiced to make your acquaintance! Mr. Bell- No? I would say Mr. Earle, then - we are delighted to receive you as a member of our happy family; and you also, Mr. Bell! And these are your sweet little bhildren! What fairies! positively they are divine! I must have a kiss from each pair ofrosy lips! Oh! oh! ohk I do so dote upon chil- dren  I ce't tell you! Oh-h-h! the angelic little seraphs! Aind I am sadly afraid that you have had a dreary ride. We did not dare expect you in such unpropitious weather. I trust the dear babes have not suffered. That was the rea- son that our wagon did not meet you at the depot to get your trunks.. I hope this omission on our part-- pardonable as you must allow it to be -will not occasion you any incon- venience. . Take 'seats- do I This is our parlor, and you must always feel as much at home in it as if it were your ow.. We, think it a tolerably well-appointed room. You perceive that we have a taste for literature and the fine arts. We could not exist without our piano, books, and pictures. Moreover, we try to please our guests in every possible and 'minagne waye. This is my sister, Saccharissa,--as a younger lady entered,- - "Mr. Bell, Mrs. Bell, Mr. Earle,   Mrs. Earle!- I was just saying, Saccharissa, how sorry and mortified we are that the wagon did not meet our friends at the d6p6t. The stage cannot bring a full complement of pas- sengers and trunks. This is our sister Hortensia, the young- est, and pet of us all. There are no others of our household proper at home, at the present time. Our eldest brother,- our comfort and mainstay in our orphasnage,- formerly a member of Congress, is Minister Plenipotentiary to the Sov- ereign Principality of Smokenuff, and, of course, resides. abroad. Our second brother belongs to the firm of Sellum & Co., in the great metropolis. We enjoy the society of our - summer visitors all the more from our comparative solitude at other times." HereMiss Saccharissa - a rather pretty girl, with an elab-  orate coiffure of curls and roses, contrasting strangely with her dress, a cotton print, that yet fitted well to a good fig- ure-succeeded in making herself heard; and Miss Horten- sia- the second:sister's counterpart in manner and attire- joining in, on a different key, the three talked all together in a distracting, breathless medley of commonplaces, spiced with high-sotmding words and frequent exclamations, that stunned the visitors into dumbness. But for the babies-independent little rebels that they were! -- there is no telling how long the trio of entertainers would have remained there, drawn up in line of battle in front of the defenceless ranks of storm-beaten travellers; but Master Charley Earle entered a vociferous complaint against the fate that threatened to prolong his present state of inter- nal emptiness and outward discomfort, and being promptly and ably seconded by Miss Florence Bell, who was six months his junior, the two accomplished the incredible feat of routing the beseigers ignominiously. "I suppose you would like to go up to your rooms pretty soon?" said Miss Jemima, as if struck by a new idea. 25*      '  A -BATnhE -BlWTR.' "We would certainly!" aid Mrs. Bell, emphatically. Mr. Bell slipped in his word at this auspicious instant: - Anid siAcithese poor children are uncomfortable in their -damp clothing, will 'you oblige us, aid benefit them, byal- loWigfthemn t0i dry their feet and cheer their spirits at your kiteen lire? ';' he said, with aii insinuating smile, "gotten up," as' Georgia afterwards told him,' "for that occasion only." "We're very sorry," said Miss Jemima. "It is very unfortunate," bewailed Miss Saccharissa. " If -you had arrived half an hour sooner," chimed in Miss Hortensia. "But the fact is that we have tea at an unfashionably early hour in this primitive region," Miss Jeninma snatched at the thread of discourse. '"Our guests prefer an early tea;"Miss Saccharissa got hold of it in her turn. "-It gives them. an opportunity of driving or walking in the cool of the day, of sentimentalizing in the moonlight." Miss Hortensia.-proved herself a match for her seniors. "Aind tea ieing over and the evening being so sultry," said Miss Jemima. "And not anticipating the pleasure we now enjoy," Miss Saccharissa pursued, winningly. "I do hope you wont think us negligent," sighed Miss Ebortensia. "But we suffered the kitchen-fire to go out an hour ago," concluded they ail i concert. Even iMr. Earle's face lost its smile of malicious amuse- ment at this unforeseen blow. Mr. Bell spoke out boldly the thought of the rest,- ",We can have supper, I suppose? We have eaten noth- "g since twelve oclock today, and are really very hungry." "Oh dear, yes! why, of course!" returned Miss Jemima,   quickly not to say tartly. "You must not suppose is barbarians, Mr. Bell! We make it our rtule to prepare a nice, warm, substantisd repast-for those friendc who hatve travelled far and arrived late. We regard :nothig as a trouble that can conduce to thei happiness of our guestts. Saccharissa, do you see that the rooms are made ready, right away, and Hortorsia and I will attend to the: preparation of supper. We are simple folk here, Mrs. Earl, and not dis- posed to trust much to domestics. We can make6aicharcoal fire in a little while; enough to cook whit we will need." With the magic words "nice, warm, substantial supper," ringing in their ears and comforting their thouights,' the travellers bore, with commendable patience, the half-hour's delay in the parlor. Apparently, Miss Saceharissa had a great deal to do in the chambers the weary wanderers longed inexpressibly to behold. The children were divested of their damp hats and sacks and bidden to rest their cramped limbs upon the sofa; the nurses walked up and down the room hushing their babies, and the elders fell into a quiet undertone of comment and conjecture. "-There were at least twenty persons on the pias a; ladies, gentlemen, and children!' remarked Georgie, upon whom this circumstance had made a strong impression. "Can they all be boarders here? I should, not think' that the house could accommodate so many, unless the upper story is built of india-rubber, and the lodgers remarkably amiable in disposition." "You are verdant as yet; do not understand how theso things are managed," replied Mr. Earle. "I should not be o suprised to see twenty more here in the course of the next week. The season has just begun."  The ladies were not sorry that further predictions of this nature were suspended- by the entrance of a tallI man, who advanced to the centre of the room, struck a match upon   his bootheel, and proceeded very. deliherately to light a large kerosene lamp that stood upon the table. The glare brought out into strong relief a bronzed visage, black-bearled, and with ldarge, not 'altogether in-looking features. His task acoomplished, he, turnned towards the party, with an awk- ward, yet by no; means a bashful bow. ' "I am sorry that you are obliged. to wait a few -minutes for your supper,' ladies and gentleman; but it is unavoid- able. ... We e making all the haste we can with it. You found the. roads in a pretty bad state, sir, did you not?" addressing Mr, -Bell. , ,That gentleman replying in the affirmative, he and .Mr. EZarle fell:into conversation with the stranger, the rest listen-. ing,atten:tively. They heard an enthusiastic description of tle,- beauty, .salubrity, facilities for hunting, fishing, 'and other outdoor -sports of Roaring River, mingled with allu- sions -to the refined hospitality they were to enjoy, and the high .standing-of their .fellow-beneficiaries of the present season; an account tallying so exactly in, all particulars with Miss Jemima's written encomiums, that an unpleasant suspicion stole uponr the minds of his auditors that he was A   a partner in the concern, and had had his, instructions to puff it upon all convenient occasions. This fear was, by and by, dissipated by his saying,-  ' Ham only a boarder here myself; I am a resident of where I have been engaged in active business for many years, retiring, during the summer, to a snug country seat x;ot far from: the sea-shore. My health has become ma- terially injured by close application and the raw sea-air, and, by the advice of my physician, I resolved upon Opend- !ng some months in the mountains.

'  "No: only tired' and hungry," -replied Mr. Bell, shortly. "It is past their usual bedtime." "Their usual bedtime!"  The thought of each?mother flew to the cool, darkened nursery, with its: small: white beds, and contented, healthful sleepers, as she had looked upon them no longer ago than last night, and- as the fretful cries that were not now hushable by any device of nurse-craft, tortured her heart -and nerves, the tears sprang into her eyes at the contrast of -the nlind-picture with the present scene. The stranger, meanwhile, uInmindfiul of Mr. -Bells -hint, lounged to the 'window, and, leaning out, began a conversa- tion with some one outside. I He wheeled about quickly, as Miss Saecharissa presented herself in the 'doorway, a lighted. lamp in her hand. - A"Are the rooms ready, Saccharissa?" he asked, famil- iarly. "They are! no thanks to you!" she rejoined, Poutingly. "I couldn't help it! Jemima kept' me hard at work in the kitchen until three minutes ago.

Poor Mrs. Bell, who had been growing hysterical for the last hour, could now  have sunk upon the uninviting bed and cried heartily with chagrin and mortification, A, pas- sionate petition, born of intense homesickness, was, aJady upon her lips-an entreaty to her indulgent and sympathi. ing husband to take her back to the city on the imorrow; but, at that instant, there, came across. the -hall, a:roar-a shout of famniliar laughter. She know as well as if sheihad seen him with her bodily eyes how Tom Earle was-stamping about the contemptib le little chamber assigned to him and his family, holding his sidesrocking and reeling i noisy merriment at; his wife's disappointment and surprisedobser- vations upon their 'quarters. A glow arose to Mrs. Bell's cheek that dried the spring- ing tears,  "I Lave lodged insmaller rooms than this, my son -at waterirg-places that :were crowded every year, and which   ( mintained a high reputation for fashion. Instead of com- plaining, lt usmake the best of matters,"  "Bravo!" said her even-tempered' husband, deceived by what he considered her cheerful philosophy, whereas it was a flashing upp of womanly spirit -or, spite, whicheveir it might be called,. "Tht is sensible!l We-wont-trust, to, first impressions, especially as, we are unexpected guests.  Things may look very different to-morrow.?? ,. ;- : "They shall!-" responded Mrs. Bell, cowuageously; and, following out the prineplqshe, had laid down, sho emoved d her hat and mantle, and, seating herself in one of thehard   312        A BABTTLE-SUMMEM chairs, took the baby mnu her arms and sent Mary down in quest of milk for the famished imnocent. Baby Florence, leaned her head against her mother's shoul- der and suffered herself to be undressed, only an occasional sobbing aiih testifying that the limit of her slender stock of endurance was nearly reached. Mary was brave and shrewd beyond the generality of her class; so ready of wit and prompt hi action, that her mistress marvelled at her pro- longed absence. The summons to supper had sounded, and Mr. Bell, like a good husband and efficient assistant in, the necessay nursery-work to be accomplished before the meal could be rpartaken of, had found brushes, combs, and soap in the travelling-bag; washed little Annie's face and hands and smoothed her tumbled curls; then, having performed the like offices for himself, and superintended Harry's efforts at mirtation, he took Florence, who was by this time arrayed for bed, upon his arm, and, stalking .back and forth in the short- alley between the bedsteads, sang the enlivening bal- lad of--       ] -' "Hey, diddle, diddle, The cat and the fiddle." Mrs. Bell-had arranged her own hair and dress, when Mary re-entered with a mug of milkl in her hand. "Did you have any trouble'in finding the kitchen, Marry?' inquired her mistress, not noticing her heightened color and worried expression. "I began to be uneasy about you."  .  The girl was uniformly good-natured' and respectful; but the native vehemence broke bounds now in the exclamation, "No thr6uble at all in finding it, msaam; but throuble enough afther I got there!  Then ensued :a burning account of her grievances, Mrs. Bell being too much astonished at the unprecedented rush of fiery'words to check her at once. Mary had applied to   A BATTLE SUMTER.         8313 Miss Jemima-" the ould young leddy," as she designated her-for the milk, and this personage had sent a small bound girl, the sole hired waitress of the establishment, down cellar for the desired nourishment. Discovering, by the combined aid. of smell and taste, that it was sour, Mhary had very respectfully announced the fact to the mistress of the kitchen. "And sez she, ma'am, 'Ah!' sez she, 'its the thun- der this afternoon that has turned it, shure! It ginerally does!' And wid that, she wint on wid her work, leavin' me a-sthandin' there wid the cup in me hand." Mary always became intensely Irish in her speech when excited. "And, sez I, prisently, makin' bould to spake for the sake of the stharvin' darlint that was fair breakin' its heart for the lack of somethin' to ate,- sez I, 'Will you be so kind, ma'am, as to tell me where I'll get a dhrop of swate milk, for it's sore hungry the poor baby is!' Faith, ma'am, and she sthared at me as if I had sivin heads, and sez she, raal scornful-like, sez she, 'Do you always git fresh milk in the city, or shalle and water? ' (Pure, swate milk!' sex I. ' Well, sez she, 'I wish you to understhand for the future, that its against our rule to disturb the night's nillk afther the crame has begun to rise; but seein' you are just come, I'll oblige your misthress for this once.' Wid that, she took the cup her- self, and wint off down cellar, and when she brought up the cup, I'll be blamed, maanm, if it wasn't half water! But what could I do but howld my tongue and jest stay to warm it the least bit over the fire, and put a grain of sugar in? 'Don't ye put hot wather in?' sez she. 'That's too rich for a baby's stomach!' -'In general, I put one-third hot wather,' sez I; 'but I'm afraid it might waken this too much.' And as I come out, I Hleard her rail at me to her sisters and the black-whiskered man for an impudent Irish hussey!" 27    314        A BATTLE SUMMcWR. "There! there! Mary, say no more about it now!"inter- rupted Mrs. Bell, hurrying Harry and Annie from the room, an order they -obeyed with reluctance, so interested were they in Mary's narrative. Their father accompanied them down stairs, Mrs. Bell lingering behind for a moment to give instructions as -to Florences resting-place, and, as Mary cooled down from her white heat, to administer a few judicious words of mingled reproof and. consolation. She then summoned up the most cheerful look at her command, which, she was nevertheless aware, was- a poor counterfeit, and joined the rest of the party in the dining-room. This " apartment "-to borrow the nomenclature of the Misses Ketchum--was according to the pattern of Barbara Allen's death-couch, as ordered by that remorseful maiden, "'long and narrow." There was barely room for a single person to pass between the wall and the row of chairs packed closely together around the table. On one end of this was spread a tablecloth of doubtful purity, leaving exposed a cheerless stretch of-pine boards, stained and spotted by spilled liquids and hot dishes. A kerosene lamp, whose villanous odor was peculiarly penetrating on this hot, still night, illum- ined the feast. This consisted first of two plates of bread, - rye and wheat. Both were hard and both were heaiy; but the rye was sticky and the wheat dry and sour, so there was variety in that portion of the fare. These flanked a plate of -butter--very oily,\ notwithstanding the well-stocked ice-house, and -which, before the meal was dispatched, was dotted over with greedy flies and the lifeless remains of rash candle-bugs; variety there also, you perceive! Then came a dish of boiled eggs, eight in number-- exactly one apiece for the party; tea, remarkable neither for strength nor. heat, and having the unmistakable wishy-washy flavor that betrays the haste or negligence of the maker in not J        *   A BATIITE  - BUMs .      35 allowing .the water to boil; a saltcellar and caster, and nothing more! The three sisters were in obsequious attendance; likewise the man whom the guests had seen in the parlor. He made himself principally useful by replenishing the teapot from a kettle which he brought from the adjoining kitchen, and alternately screwing up and screwing down the -kerosene lamp, thus producing an. agreeable variation of light from glare to gloom. The lamps were, it soon appeared, Miss Saccharissa's care, and she made his officiousness in this respect the foundation of another coquettish complaint. "Be still, Saccharissa: you forget your position!" said Miss Jemima, sharply. "Mr. Burley, let me introduce you to the new members of our happy household. Mrs. Earle, Mrs. Bell, Miss Rose, -'r. Earle, Mr. Bell! This is Mr. Burley, ladies and'gentlemen! A   most important, and valuable ingredient of our social composition; I really do not know  what we should do without him. Have   you brothers, Mrs. Earle?" Mrs. Earle replied simply "Yes," not caring to r n.ind the querist of her relationship to Mr. Bell. She -was both weary and disgusted) and, as a natural sequence, wofully out of spirits. ( Jemima, I am ashamed of you!" interposed Hortensia. "ir. Bell is her brother I How forgetful you are grow- ina!" "If you had one-tenth on your- mind that I have, Miss, you would let a   trifle slip from your memory, once in a while!" -snapped the elder; then, mollifying her tone into one of pensive sentimentality, she pursued: "You -an hardly imagine, Miss Earle, how very desolate we. felt away up here, in the clouds, as one may say, with no guide- and protector, after being accustomed to the society and care of our two brothers. When the-elder left us for Washington, c,.   316       A. BATTLE 'SUMMi.       l it was a fearful blow; but when he accepted the foreign ap- pointment, I thought that I could not survive it. I Kept my bed for a week. ) Indeed, my nerves have never reco ered from the shock. But we ought to be more patriotic, I know; ought to find consolation in the thought that he is serving his country. Patriotism is a great virtue; don't you think so, Mr. Bell?"     -  "It is, certainly!" The unfortunate respondent loked as if he thought that another egg would be a more desirable thing in the then state of his physical system; but aiss Jemima was obtuse to such untimely hints.  'Oh, I fairly dote uponnpatriotism! So, when Mr. ur- ley came to us, it was like- a gift from Heaven. He seems just to fill up the vacant place in our home and hearts. I never.'saw another man with such versatility of talent. He can do anything. He made us a splendid pudding yester- day, and some superb ice-cream to-day. He is a genuine treasure."  "Have some more bread, Miss Rose? I had a hand in that, too!" simpered Mr. Burley, who was evidently used to this barefaced praise, and relished it amazingly. Georgie declined the offered plate as coldly as was consist- ent' with common civility. She hod conceived an intense dlislike for the man, heightened during every minute spent in his presence by the bold regards he fixed upon herself. lHe doubtless-meant this for admiration; but it was none \ the less offensive on this account. "A vulgar, forward fellow!" she said, mentally; and for- getting that they had, by co ming hither, enrolled themselves as Miss Jemima's friend and equals, she added, indignantly, "What right has she to force her underbred admirers upon our acquaintace?P " Jemiowa, Miss Rose will take another cup of tea!" was .- 'his next advance.    A BASTTE SMbuEt          3D- Georgie prevented him by a haughty gesture, when he wound bave removed her cup.- "No, thank you, Miss Ketchum!" she answered, as if the proposition had emanated from that lady. Mr. Burley understood her, for he reddened and frowned; then, leaning, in an attitude meant for negligent grace, against the wall near Miss Rose's sOat, he talked with Miss Saccha- rissa, in a- pretended " aside " that was distinctly auble to all present. The half-gallant, half-teasing strain was iter- rupted by the rising of the company from table. "Will you apcompany me into the parlor and make the acquaintance of your fellow-visitors?"-inquired MVliss Jem- ima. "We have some delightful .people here   some fine conversationalists and excellent musicians. Our evenings are very gay; positively festive! 'You are a musician, of course, Miss Rose?  "I am sure she is I She looks thoroughly accomplished!" said Miss Hortensia. "And such a musical face!P observed Miss Saccharissa, - dulcetly. "We can promise you an appreciative auditory." "Do come!" cried they all, surrounding Georgie, and moving towards the open door of the parlor. "Mr. Norris!" hailed Miss Jemima's/srill tones to a gentleman, who just then entered th6 hall from the piazza., "we have secured such a prize to our musical circle! Miss Rose, Mr. Norris!" "Mrs. Bell, Mrs. Earle!" put in Miss Saccharissa. "Mr. Earle, Mr. Bell!" finished Miss Hortensia. "Do join us in persuading Miss Rose- to indulge us with some divine strains!" chorused the three. Georgie felt like a hunted, worried fawn encompassed by a pack of hounds. So rapid and clamorous was the attack, that she nor her friends, had found space to utter a word, although-both the matrons had striven to interfere in her 27*            ;   Ol- A BATTLE SitM W        . behalf. At the appeal to the passers-by, her anger reached o its height. "I may prepare for fresh insult!" she thought, and her every feature expressed her determination to resist it by the most lofty dignity. -She stood, pale and apparently calin  her disdain, not moving to shake off the hand Miss Saccharissa had laid upon her shoulder, or vouchsating a glance at the referee. How soothingly fell the clear, deep accents upon her throbbing ,pulses! The voice was that of a gentleman, and the words suited it. "Excuse me, Miss Ketchum! Such importunity from me would be unwarrantable impertinence."  Exchapang his cold tone for one of cordial respect, he said: "If I am not mistaken, we have met before, Mr. Earle!" "We have!" exclaimed Tom, delightedly, returning the grasp of the other's hand. "My dear,"-to his wife, "you have heard me speak of Mr. Norris, one of my com- panions on that trip to the Adirondacks, last year. This is the gentleman, and I am right glad to meet him again," "What a charming coincidence!" began the sisters. Georgie waited to hear no more. Profiting by this tempt- ing diversion of attention from herself, she glided unper. ceived from  the group and va nished up the stairway, nor did-she reappear below that night.   A BATTLE SUMER..         319 CHAP TE R    III. THiE sun was redly visible above the brow of the mountain next morning - a rayless ball through the dim mist that still enwrapped the valley, when Georgie and her- niece Arnie, who had shared her chamber, descended to the pivaa. There was little temptation, even to tired travellers, to play the sluggard upon the lumpy husk mattress and Lilliputian pillows that had composed her couch. Moreover, the air of her bed-closet was close to stifling, and had these things been different, the incessant gabbling in thepassages and lower rooms would have put to flight all thoughts of sleep that might have visited'her after five o'clock. The unseasonable uproar was the clatter, not murmur of three treble voices,- Miss Jemimna's loudest and most piercing, and a base, which Georgie knew for Mr. Burley's. Her room had a window near the ceiling - a square aperture, without sash or shut- ter, designed as a ventilator, and opening directly above the staircase. Judging from the sounds that ascended through this, she surmised that the invaluable Burley was assisting his inamorata in sweeping and dusting the first floor, stairs and piazza included. Finding sleep to be an impracticabil- ity, and discovering that Annie was as wakeful as herself, Georgie arose, dressed herself and the child, and, when the voices of the quartette died away in the direction of the kitchen, she ventured to leave her cell. She was not the earliest, even of her party, on the ground, for, seated comfortably upon a bench in the piazza, was Mr. -                   e   320        A BATTLE SUMMER. Earle, in close confabulation with a young gentleman of de- cidedly prepossessing appearance. This, Georgie felt sure, was Mr. Norris, although she had not seen him the preced- ing evening. , She made amends for her former discourtesy by looking him straight in the eyes, now, as her brother-in- law named him; acknowleding secretly, as she did so, that his face was as fill of character and refinement as his voice. His countenance brightened visibly as he was presented to her; but it was only the expression of pleasure one might feel at the introduction to a friend's friend. There was not a sign that he retained any memory of the disagreeable inci- dent connected with their former meeting. The hot flush passed from Georgie's cheeks, as she noticed this, and she responded readily and gracefully to his efforts to engage her in conversation. This was his second visit to the Ketchum farm-house, she learned; and while he could not contrbly the amused look that answered hers of inquiry, he yet spoke guardedly of the indifferent accommodations, and the very objectionable triumvirate that ruled the premises. There were pleasant walks in the woods and up the sides of the mountain, he stated, and tolerable fishing at certain points on the river. The hunting was not so good; as to the trout, he was rather skeptical; but Mr. Earle and himself had just been arranging the details of an expedition that should deter- mine the truth or falsity of that theory very shortly. Meanwhile, Annie Bell had climbed to her uncle's knee, and, too well trained to interrupt the talk of older people, silently occupied herself in rubbing numerous fiery spots *sprinkled over her plump arms. Mr. Earle, chancing to glance down at her, perceived these. C What does this mean?" he interrogated, taking one of the inflamed members in his hand. "They are mosquito bites," replied Georgie. "Our room was full of them. Were you not troubled in the same way?"   A BATTLE SUMM   .        321 "; They never trouble me, individually. They like me not," said Mr. Earle. "Soho, mosquitoes! Why, Miss Fol-de-rol, the eldest sister, wrote to us that there never had been a mos- quito seen within ten miles of Roaring River." "You were correctly informed, sir!" said a pompous voice behind him. It came from  Mr. Burley, who now thrust his head and shoulders out of the parlor window, lounging easily upon the sill, as he continued his remarks. "That nuisance is confined to the low countries and the sea- coast. The creature is a lmsus natwce hereabouts. The eruption upon your niece's arms and face is a species of rash that often appears upon the skin when one exchanges an unhealthy for a pure air. It is nature's effort to throw off the evil humors of the -system. I notice premonitory symptoms of the same breaking out on your forehead, Miss Rose." Georgie looked down in dignified silence. Mr. Norris took care that she should not be, obliged to speak. "That is a reasonable theory, perhaps, -Mr. Burley," -he responded; smiling; "but, like many other theories, it is unfortunately at variance with facts." He plucked a leaf from a tree overhanging the porch. "What title do you bestow upon this insect, in the mountains? If I had met him in the less favored lowlands, I should not have to apply to you for information." Mr. Earle's laugh was echoed by Mr. Bell's, he having just then emerged from the house. "I should call that a well-gorged mosquito!" said the former, getting up to inspect the hapless creature, which Norris held by the wings. "I killed twenty-five of his comrades, all as comfortably filled, before I left my chamber," observed Mr. Bell. "The poor baby is terribly peppered.: I had forgotten what a rare species they are in these parts, or I would have captured a E   322       A: BATTLE BUMMER C dozen or so of the largest alive, and brought them down for exhibition t This raillery was received by Mr. Burley with sulky ef- frontery. Deigning no reply, he disappeared from the win. dow, and, about ten minutes afterwards, came out upon the piaxza, his hands full of flowers,-pinks, larkspur, and laven- der, dripping with moisture. Walking up to Georgie, he offered her a bunch of these, as stiTf and tasteless a group as could well be imagined. "We are all devotees of Flora, here, li[s Rose." Completely taken by surprise, Georgie accepted the bou- quet, hardly knowing what she did. Recollecting herself the next second, she dropped it into Annie's lap, transferring it with a daintily contemptuous gesture of her pretty fingers that- made Norris smile. It was certain that he liked her none the less for it. "Is that the major-domo of the establishment?" queried Mr. Bell, looking after the retreating Burley, as he obeyed a call from the interior of the mansion. "I have a fancy that he will become a partner one of these days," answered Norris. "His present position is somewhat ambiguous." Mrs. Earle came down, heavy-eyed and pale, at the sound of the breakfast-bell, and close behind her was Mrs. Bell. "I did not sleep well, and have a wretched headache this morning;" she said, in reply to Georgie's affectionate inqui- ries. "But I amn not disheartened. When our trunks come, we can arrange matters to suit ourselves. I have baby's crib-net among my things.- It is three times larger than she needs, and I have calculated that, by cutting it up, we can. furnish all our windows with mosquito-bars," i "I always said that you would be a famous manager in the backwoods," rejoined her husband, patting her shoulder. Spunky little woman!  She had reviewed the whole' "sit-   A BATTLE SUMrT. j- 323 uation " in her restless brain, during the tedious hours of that damp, breathless night, as she lay, in compulsory quiet of body, upon the unyielding, uneven flock mattress, holding Baby Florence tightly in her arms, lest she should roll from the tall, aarrow couch to the floor. Mr. Bell and Harry had possession of the other bed. One of Mrs. Bell's main resolutions was, that, since the ladies of the two families had been most eager to try the experiment of a- sulnmmr at Roar- ing River, they should not be the first to complain. Like most other spirited dames, she dreaded ridicule more than physical inconvenience, and she foresaw that an early and ignominious abandonment of a scheme she had been so for- ward in advocating would furnish Tom Earle with perpetual material for teasing. In imagination, she heard the whole story talked over among the acquaintances to whom they had described, in glowing terms, their contemplated retreat, be- held herself and fellow-sufferers the mark for abundant jests and unbearable pity, and she raised her little hand in a vow that, what flesh and blood could endure, she would, and that without a murmur. Furthermore, her sisters should do like- wise! By some telegraphic communication, habitual to the sex, these two were notified of her determination, and signified their readiness to co-operate with her, ere they reached the breakfast table. If the gentlemen chose to declare their circumstances unbearable, upon them should- rest the respon- sibility of changing these, and the jeers of the public. Most women could be martyrs in a cause like this; and all three of our fair friends had rather more than the average amount of wit and spirit. So each called up a smileethat looked agreea- ble and natural, in return for-the profuse salutations of the Misses Ketchum. These stood just within the dinlug-room door, en deshabille in calico wrappers; en grande toilette as. to their hair, Miss Jemima's being puffed over her ears, Miss   324        A BATTLE SUIE  . Saccharissa's curled, and Miss Hortensia's frizzed. Each wore one of Mr. Burley's bouquets. Miss Jeinima's was at the back of her head, Miss Saccharissa's above the left temple, while Miss Hortensia's crowned the frizzled and pomatumed pile on the very top of her cranium. - As the other boarders --guzests, I should say - entered, they were presented, with much pomp of language, if not of circumstance, to the later comers. They were, taken as a whole, an attractive looking company. There were half-a-dozen ladies besides -those of our party, and about the same number of gentlemen and children, and all, with the single exception of Mr. Burley, had the appearance and manners of well-bred people. This last-named personage did not sit with the rest; but carved at a side-table, dispensing amazingly small strips of a tough, leathery substance, complimented by the name of ,steak." There were, besides this chief viand, two large soup plates of a mixture, suspicious in looks and 'odor, called, " hash;" two others of stewed potatoes, hard, grayish, and waxy; two pats of butter, and four piles of bread, exactly similar in appearance and character to that served up to the hungrytravellers the night before. Bessie Earle, a fastidious miss of six summers, turned up her nose at the hash, and after a futile effort to masticate the steak, furtively withdrew the gristly morsel from her mouth, and, depositing it upon the side of her plate, declared to her mother that she 'did' not feel like eating, somehow!"' Distressed at this failure of appetite, Mrs. Earle turned to Miss Saccharissa, who stood nearest her chair, and asked, politely, if the child could have an egg. "Certainly! I hope you will never feel any hesitation in asking for what you wish!"replied that young lady, be- nignly, and withdrew from the room to see to the fulfilment of the request. In a minute'or two she was backagain, and leaning ove -   A BATTLE SUMMER         325 ]Mrs. Earle's shoulder, w4th unruffled urbanity of visage and a manner, expressed her regret that there was not an egg in the house. The last had been boiled for the late supper of the previous evening. ("How, then, did they clear the coffee?" wondered Mrs. Bell, -who always drank tea. A glance at the muddy liquid in her husband's cup laid this thought to rest. "Eggs are awfully scarce; frightfully dear!" said Miss Jemima, who lhad overheard the petition and reply. '"And in a family like ours we use an immense quantity. But 1 think it is sinful to murmur. My brother writes me from the city that they are selling in their market for thirty cents a dozen. Oh, oh, oh-h! isn't that dreadful! Just think how the poor must suffer in those large towns! And even the middle and wealthy classes have to submit to privations that we happy country people never dream of. When I re- flect how many of my fellow-creatures subsist upon swill  milk, stale vegetables, and tasteless baker's bread, I am moved to thankfulness that my lines were cast in such pleasant places. Have you ever visited Washington, M. Norris?" "I have, madam." iThe fare in the hotels there is abominable, isn't it?" "It did not strike me as being unbearable." "Didn't it? I passed one winter in llard's, while --my brother was in Congress. O what a gay time I had  I so enjoyed meeting the distinguished men-of the day! My' brother's parlor was the favorite resort of such statesmen as Clay, Crittenden, Webster, and Calhoun. I became very intimate with them." "Indeed! I had not supposed that your brother was a Congressman so long ago," rejoined Norris, with admirable gravity. "I thought him comparatively a young mani your 28     326        A BATTLE SUMM Rt junior, in fact. I never imagined that he was contemporary with Calhoun." "Is there nothing which that sweet child will eat, Mrs. Earle?" Miss Jemima became suddenly very solicitous for Bessie's comfort. "We have such a variety that something must. surely tempt her. We always study to set a varied and appetizing assortment of eatables before our friends." "I will trouble you for a glass of new milk and a slice of toasted bread, if you please. She is not very well this morn-- ing, I think," said Mrs. Earle, in her gentle, lady-like way. "Hortensia, give the order!" said Miss Jemima briskly. The milk was brought pretty soon, and, remembering Mary's story, Mrs. Earle raised the glass to her own lips be- fore giving it to Bessie. There was no mistaking the quality of the beverage. It had been both skimmed and watered. It did not even leave a white trace on the side of the tumbler as it regained its level. ^ '"I am very sorry," - this time it was Miss Hortensia's  turn to be affably apologetic at Mrs. Earle's ear, -- "but the kitchen fire is so low that the cook says she cannot possibly toast a slice of bread over it." This general lowness of condition was, by the way, as all the boarders speedily discovered, a chronic complaint of the kitchen-fire. "It is so hot that we only kindle it up to prepare the reg-. ular meals,"' Miss Jemima explained. We could not work in the room where a constant fire was kept." Mrs. 'Earle had- a queer sensation in her throat as she broke up a piece of dry bread into Bessie's milk, and saw her try, dutifully, in obedience to 6er injunction, to swallow it. She recollected, as a morsel of consolation, that she had that morning found still remaining in the luncheon-basket a store of biscuits and sandwiches. .How little she had known of their real value when she provided so liberally for, their -d ' '-         -  i!   A BATTLE SWMr M         327 journey! She was glad to think, moreover, that there were a box of crackers; a fine old Einglish cheese; cakes, sugar, lemons, wine, and wax candles among the baggage, which would probably reach them before nightfall., Crusoe, on his desert island, did not overhaul the chest cast ashore with more trembling hope and anxiety than did this thrifty house- wife and tender mother rehearse mentally the contents of the precious boxes - yet undelivered. By nine o'clock the sun gave promise of throwing aside the envious mantle of cloud, and the ladies caught with avidity at a proposition broached by Mr. Be l, that they should don hats and overshoes and walk to a neighboring eminence said to command a fine view. The grass was high and wet in the orchard through which their way lay, and the trees loaded with rain-drops; but they were not to be turned back by these trifles, remembering the ennuii that awaited them in the house they left behind. After ten min- utes'tramp, they stood upon "Prospect Hill."  It overlooked  meado v lands on either side of the river, in on3e direction; the Ketchum farm  buildings in another; the view was bounded abruptly upon two others' by a range of prosaic, monotonous mountains, with no particular beauty of outline; not high enough to be grand, nor was the forest that formed their scanty covering noteworthy for aught except the fre- quent black patches that interrupted the green, and the curl- ing smoke, that betokened these to be the work of charcoal- burners. The river was, at its broadest part, half a mile in width; a muddy, sluggish stream, wallowing between reedy and marshy banks., Georgie exclaimed with disappointment; then, remem-t bering the feminine compact, tried to divert her escort's attention from her indiscretion. "Why 'Roaring River'?' she asked. 'It is quiet enough here."   324      . . A. bTomAE SUMMER. c' There is a tale to the-effect that it-is a turbulent rivulet near its mountain source," replied Mr. Norris. "The Misses Ketchum are eloquent in their description of the-grand cas- cade to be found by diligent search about twenty miles up the: stream. If you remain here n til clear weather, Mrs. Bell, we can make up a party to visit it. At this point, I grant you, Miss Rose, that it 'roars you soft as any sucking dove.'" " /Mr. Earle ejaculated a monsyllable in his wife's ear, as, warned by the dariening heavens that another shower was at hand, they beat a precipitate retreat from their post of observation. Botsh!". he said,' emphatically, and she knew that the scenery and the indoor accommodations were alike written down in his books as a " sell." It rained so persistently, for three days more, that the question was gravely mooted whether the sun were here, as in the polar regions, invisible for half the year. The first day and a half were consumed by the Bell party in unpack- inag trunks and contriving ways and means to convert their cells into tenable habitations. "Stow close" was here, as at sea, the imperative maxim. Trunks were summarily ban- ished to the hall, even at the risk of torn dresses and bruised shins. Under Mrs. Bell's strait, slender-limbed bedstead, were packed, with due regard to order, first, a dozen bottles of wine, and as many of porter, laid in rows upon their sides; then -came a square tin box of crackers - sweet, Gra- ham, and butter -and a round wooden one of cheese; next, a leather case of boots and shoes; and nearest the foot a covered clothes-basket. No decent mechanic in the crowded streets of her native city would have endured to live in such a fashion; but the brave-souled matron said to herself and others that it was absurd to expect the comforts of home anywhere except at home, and made a heroic display of mer-   A BATTE      .        329 riment over the shifts to which they were obliged to resort in order to move and breathe.         . She was not singular -ii  her philosophical principles and attempted practice of the same. Yet the feeble show of jollity that reigned nightly'in the parlor which Miss Jemima described as the home of social mirth and intellect- ual converse," deceived none of the participants therein into a belief of its reality. The ladies crocheted and sewed about the centre-table, conversing in subdued tones; th, gentlemen, having discussed their cigars in the damp piazza, sauntered in, one by one, and: allowed themselves to be set down to whist; submitted to be talked to by one or the other, oftener by all-the Misses Ketchum, or sat gloomily .apart, poring over newspapers three days old; for, among the advantages of the place:which Miss Jemima had accidentally-omitted to mention, was a semi-weekly, instead of a daily mail The triad of sisters were, we may - safely -say, the only ones who really enjoyed their pet" evening reunions." The domestic duties of the day were over; the feeble' kitchen fire allowed to perish peacefully. Assisted by Mr. Burley, Miss Saccha- rissa had washed and .wiped the dishes; Miss Jemima ar- ranged the preliminaries for breakfast, and stored the day's scraps; Miss Hortensia scolded, while she helped the bound- girl to put water in every room and towels where they were due; for these indispensable articles were, like the mail, dis- tributed but twice a week, and then only one or two to each room. And, decked in other and gayer robes than they had worn through the hours of daylight, the Misses Ketchun ap- peared in the state apartment and addressed themselves to the work of entertaining their "friends." Not -that what Mr. Ea-rle rudely, but confidentially anathematized as their ' confounded clack," was more incessant then than at other times. All-three talked conthiually, Miss Jemima especially. Sweeping, dusting, cooking, serving, or waiting, her tongue 28* (of      8'   330        A BATTLE SUMMEE was a terrible confirmation of St. James' wisdom and knowl edge of the gentler portion of mankind, when he pronounced it to be an "unruly evil, which no man can tame." But, in the social gathering after, tea, the hostesses sank the kitchen and chamber-work. Belles-lettres, the fine arts, fashions and flirtations were matters to which they did there most seriously incline. Then would Miss Jemima beg leave to delight thelcompany with "the sweetest thing" from Tupper or Willi{, and enunciate astounding bits of informa- tion concerning lthis or that author, generally a fragment of personal history, she vouching for the authenticity of the story upon the strength of an acquaintanceship with the no- tability under discussion, formed "in my brother's parlor in 'Wrashington, while he was a member of Congress." The parlors, so often aforesaid, would seem to have been an omnium -gatherum of celebrities, since there was scarcely, one belonging to this century whom she had not met'within its charmed precincts during that " heavenly winter in the capital." Miss Jemima was strong upon adjectives. During these three days and nights, the most powerful emotion of our city party,-mastering even their extreme sense of discomfort, and soreness of acknowledgment that they were the victims of an egregious and barefaced imposi- tion-,-was a feeling of overwhelming wonderment at volu- biity so amazing, to them unprecedented and terrific. The marvel was that the woman's vocal apparatus did not abso- lutely wear out. "Sheet-iron and steel springs would have gone to wreck long ago, with one-half the friction," said Mr. Earle. "But gabbling is Jemima's normal state. 'She does violence to her whole nature whenever she shuts her mouth." {v   A BATTLE OSMME.          33 CHAPTER IV. AT last the sky really grew clear, the mists rolled sullenly out of sight into their mountain hiding-places, and the Ketchum house gave up its prisoners. The children, wild with joy, were thickly shod and permitted to ramble in the garden, a tolerably extensive plot of vegetables, bounded by currant-bushes; the babies' carriages were brought out into the drier, because treeless, area between the house and the barn; the gentlemen were busy with live bait and fishing- tackle; the ladies dispersed in various directions--some to gather flowers and berries, while others preferred accom- panying their husbands and brothers in the excursion upon the river. Mesdames Bell and Earle were adjudged by Mr. Norris to be, with their respective lords, full weight for the capacious family-boat they had engaged for the-season. The young man had, for his own use, a tight-built, jaunty little skiff, that danced on the water like a cork. Would Miss Rose honor his humble craft by becoming his passenger? With a blush and a smile that made her look prettier than before, Georgie thanked him for the compliment, and, giving him her hand, stepped lightly into the boat and took her seat in the stern. 'Why, Mr. Norris!" called out a sharp voice that was  only too familiar to the ears of alL Ad What a naughty story- teller you are I Didn't you declare to me, last'week, when I almost went down upon my knees to you to entreat you to -*            .    a4O. A BA TTLE SUMMEt give me a sail in your beauteous c Butterfly,' that it would not be safe for a lady to go in her? And here you are in. veigling Miss ;Rose into danger! Mrs. Bell, I wouldn't trust my sister alone with such a wicked, reckless man! Miss Rose, I warn you against his machina tions!" With a movement savoring more of impatience than any other that Georgie had as yet seen in him, Norris swept the bow of the skiff around by a stroke of his oar. "I said that, in my opinion, it would be unsafe for you to go with me, Miss Jemima. I thought so then, -I know it now.; Miss Jemima commenced an energetic reply, not one word of which they understood, as they moved down the stream, the three pairs of oars clicking- unnecessarily loudly in the rowlocks,:but the sound of her unmelodious .tones pursued them until they -lost sight of her behind a bend in the river. She presented a remarkable figure as she stood on the baonk Watching them. On her head was a wide-brimmed straw hat, yellowish brown, from the- combined influence of 'rain and sunshine. To-the edge of the flapping brim was sewed a curtain of green cambric, thrown back in front; her dress was a faded print, tucked 'up to avoid draggling, and on her arm she carried a basket, she being bound upon-a berrying expedition. , She was a homely woman at the best, but, seen thus, with a vixenish look in her gray eyes, and a mortified sneer she tried vainly to alter into a playful smirk, curling her lip and lifting -her retroutsse nose, she was at once a ludicrous and an unlovely spectacle. Our-voyagers were huma n, and they united in a hearty laugh when she disappeared from their view. ' Grand tableau! Dido calling vainly upon AEneas! I said Mr. Earle. "Take care how you handle that egg-shell of yours, Norris. Who knows but she may have cast an evil spell upon it."   A BATTL E SUMM          833 "I defy her witchcraft!"returned Norris, glancing invol- untarily at the fair, sweet face of his " passenger "-a look of unconscious meaning, that seemed to claim her as his good genius, whose pure influence would render all malevolent designs powerless. "But were you really so ungallant as to refuse her passage in your fairy barque?" inquired Mrs.; Earle. "I told her the truth, madam,- that it would be a peril- ous experiment for her to accompany me; that I thought it more than likely that one or the other of us would be at the bottom of the river before we had gone a mile. She would have run a great risk, for my patience is not illimitable, and better men than I have been driven by a woman's tongue to murder or to suicide. I can assure you that you are per fectly safe, Miss Rose," he added, lowering his voice, as thO boats drifted apart. "The boat is entirely staunch, and i am not an inexperienced oarsman." -  "I know it. I have not thought of fear,;" was the simple rejoinder, uttered with an ingenuous trust that sent a thrill to Norris's heart.           .  "What are you musing about, Tom?" asked Mrs. Earle^ touching her liusband's arm.   .          A Her own regards being fixed upon- the handsome young couple, and her mind engrossed by a pleasant- thought relati ing to them, that had just entered her brainy she was not, quite prepared for his reply. "I was dreaming of Miss Jemim's -berry-basket. I hail its stained sides as the harbinger of better things for thefuture- something less odious than the pie-plant stewed in molasses, with which she has-physicked us for three evenings past. Berries of any description, however green and sour, would be an epicurean treat in comparison with that villainous dose." "Why, she recommended it as the most wholesome sweet- \ .             +    4    5:i3S       A ;BArBTTLE 'SUMMEEAT meat in the world, 'quite medicinal, ' returned Ib brother. in-law. The two ladies were instantly and gravely silent. "So was Mrs. Squeers' matutinal potion of brimstone and treacle," growled Tom, making a face. "I should not be surprisedi some morning, to find/ Jemima waiting to catch-us all at the foot of the staircase, with Burley standing by to, hold the bowl, intent upon administering to each of her dearly beloved guests a spoonful of the delectable compound, just to cool the blood.' "How fast that little boat goes!"Mrs. Bell adroitly changed the subject. Norris was, indeed, pulling with a will, but was not so en- grossed with his work as to be insensible to: the charms of the pleasing picture opposite to him. Georgie wore a sum- mer poplin, a silver-gray fabric; about her shoulders was cast a light worsted shawl, chinchilla and crimson; a pi- quante hat, black straw, with a drooping black plume, shaded her eyes. These were downcast in modesty or reverie, and one delicatehand hung over the gunwale into the water. She was watching the miniature waves, as. they broke up to /  her wrist, and enjoying their cool, rapid rush between herl fingers. So graceful and full of repose were her attitude and expression that she seemed to shed peace and blessing around her, like the delicious quiet of A fragrant summer's eve. "Can she and the fright we left screeching on shore belong to the same sex?" meditated the gazer. Great is the power of contrast, and this one was too strik- ,ing nbt to, have a telling effect upon imagination and heart. Miss Jemima never knew it, and there is reason to believe I that she would not have gone into ecstacies of dhght if she had; but this unavoidable comparison settled a momentous question; showed Mr. James Norris that Georgia Rose took rank above any other woman in his estimation- and affections.   A BATTLE -BUM  E.         835 Miss- Jemima had actualy helped one of her, friends" to an eligible wooer. The two boats met again on the fishing-ground, or water. Oars were drawn in, tackle disentangled, bait adjusted and persuasively lowered, and the solemnly exciting sport com- menced. For half an hour all watched and waited -before the ball was -opened by Mr. Earle's capture of a prodigious catfish. :Norris next -secured a fine silver perch, and after that affairs assumed a more interesting aspect. Decidedly, the best feature of Roaring River was the fishing. Norris was a capital angler, and evinced such zeal and skill in the amusement that Georgie was ashamed to confess how devoid of attraction it seemed to her. She shuddered whein the barb was thrust into the quivering, squirming minnows that did duty as bait; she grew tired of staring at the sun-bright water, that made head and eyes ache, until to her dazzled sight the motionless "float" changed from white and green to scarlet, then to black; then became utterly invisible for one blind, dizzy second. Whenever it really- disappeared, she felt a nervous shock, although it was the very thing she was instructed to expect and hope for, and the chief end of a float's creation, and drew in her line so hastily as usually-to detach the fish that had laid hold of the hook, and to send him flying backl to his native element. She deprecated-her awkwardness when this happened, and perhaps felt the mor- tification her looks and language expressed, but she inwardly rejoiced, at the same time, at the release of the writhing innocent. - Her spoils were not numerous, as may be sup- posed. For an hour, all that she had safely landed in the boat were two small "shiners," so tiny that Norris laugh- ingly seconded her motion to return them:to the river,: and a catfish of decent dimensions. By and by, Norris heard her call in a half-frightened-tone, "I think that I must have hooked Leviathan himselfl " and hasteninig to her assistance, ;   * i   -36        A BATTLE SUMME. found her tugging desperately at some heavy weight. Taking the line from her, he hauled 'the prize to the surface: a black nose, a horrid, gpig mouth, filled with jagged teeth, a long, shrivelled neck and- shining shell. "It looks like a walrus!" cried Georgie. "It is ca monstrous-mud-turtle! We have no accommoda. tions ior his lordship," returned Norris. Scarcely had the mirth at her alarm and the. nature of her captive subsided when Georgie exclaimed, "This time it is the sea-serpent!" and, .in a paroxysm of laughter and fear, threw into the bottom of the skiff an immense eel, twisting and floundering, and effecting such a complete tan- gle of his own sinuous length and the lines as only an eel can do.  Georgie was really pale when Norris, with the help of his clasp-knife, had freed the creature from the coil of twine, and, rolling him up, unceremoniously thrust him into the covered basket provided for their booty. It was plain that she was too timid or too sensitive to cultivate the piscatory art with any hope of success. Blaming himself for not having sooner relieved her from an embarrassing position and distasteful employment, Norris reeled in his line, and proposed a row up the stream. There were rocky banks and shady coves a mile further up, where, the channel, being moreshallow, there was no danger of her taking such gro- tesque specimens. Georgie consented with a glad face that confirmed his resolve not to allow her to throw another hook that, day. He said, moreover, to himself, that he admired her for this womanly shrinkiag from giving needless pain, and from  seeing-and handling these, uncomely reptiles. They had a pleasant pull back, past their s rtingj-oint, towards the mountain gorge that afforded passage to the river. At length, Noris ran the bows on shore ir-to a thiclet of flowering shrubs, and 'sprang: out to gather a     .   .i I   A BATTLE SU  .MER         33T bouquet for his compapion. She Watched him fora time as he mounted mossy rocks and trod gingely on marshy ground to obtain the bright blossoms that grew in profusion all around; then quitted the-boat. and joined the hunt. it was a delightful ramble to both, and, tempted by oner: and another delicate favorite and brilliant stranger, they wan- dered nearly a quarter of a mile away from tho landing,  In her purity of heart and thought, it never occurred to Georgie that there could be impropriety in stroiling from bush to vine with her brother's friend, picking here a flower, there a cluster of berries, or standing, as they frequently did, for whole minutes together, inhali ng the spicy smell of the evergreens, admiring the rich green moss that draped every fallen trunk and stone, enjoying the pipings and twitterings of the birds that flew above their heads in the sunshi e, and speaking softly of these and other beautiful things. It seemed profanation to break by incautibus tones the spell of holy, silence nature had thrown about the place. Returning in the direction of their- boat, they were awakened- from their midsummer dream: by a sort of rhyth- mical screeching proceeding from the cove where their craft lar. Norris smothered an exclamation of petulant disgust as he stepped quickly ahead of his fair chrge towards a natural hedgh of evergreen crowning the little cliff.

The doors, front and rear, were open to secure a free circulation of air; and between these, to get the benefit of said draught, stood Mr." Burley, hat and coat off, diligently turning the crank of a washingmachine.   Outside, Daffy, the small bound-girl, was stretching we  clothes upon the line. Upon a chair in the front doorway sat 'Miss Saccha- rissa, her hair in full curl, and, as usual, dressed with Mr. Burley's floral: offerings, her hands crossed idly, and her smiling face turned bewitchingly 'towards hr stalwakt adorer. It was a received principle among-the Ketchums that smiles were more easily given than shillings, and in: this currency tie fair Saccharissa was recompensing her washer-man. "Hercules and the distaff', said Georgie, softly. "' Mantalini and the mangle, rtheher," was the resPoise. The speaker took no pains to conceal the' contempt min- gled in his amusement, and Mr. Burley, who was not dull- witted, detected it. , "You may consider this an unmanly occupation, Mr. Nor- Ars," he observed, brushing the soap-scented vapor fro  his black moustache; "but I rise superior to the contemptible prejudice and false pride that make a man ashamed to ren- def himself useful in any way." "Mr. Burley is the soul 'of gallantry, the very embodi- ment of high-souled chivalry,- a rare combination in these degenerate days," simpered  Miss Saccharissa,  sgaredly. ' Daffy, lend a habd at that clothes-wringer I  - Spirits are not finely touched  But to fine issues,'" quoted Norris, involuintarily as the Herocules shookout the wrung talecloth and tossed it, with a triuimphant air, upon the heap of wet clothes in the basket.

It was wafer to be impertinent to a lady than in- sulting to a fullgrown ablbodied man. - Georgies poplin skirt ws looped above a Bamoral, gray and crimson, reveal- ing heihi p neatly-laced walking-b-oots., Glancing from her feet to her face, iwhere there was a merry play of roses and dimples, the gentleman ) asked, in a rudely famwiliar tone: Miss Rose, will you inform me what is- the utility or beauty of wearing a skirt so long that you have to fasten it up whenever you put your foot to the ground?" orris flushed up. angrily, and would have retortes but Georgie ws too quick for him. ": Not being so thorough a utilitarian as yourself, Mr. Bur- ley, I do not know that I can 'give you a satisfatory reply.

' muttered BurleF, interrupting her. - "Becausl e gyou did not heat me through.- I was about to give aanaalogous example.

CHAPTER V, Ts, supper, that evening, was marked by two interesting features. first, the substitution of dewherries for the brown- ish-green mixtures whose virtues as a febrifuge were lauded by th manufacturer thereof, but which commended itself neither by tate, odor, nor appearance, to the fancy of those for whoseh benefit it was prepared; secondly, clean} napkins were dealt to all at the board. I should fail in presenting to my readers a true picture of thismodel establishment which I beg tie charitable to be- lieve is not sketched from the life -if I were to omit men- tion of the table-napkin system.. A fresh supply of these useful squares of napery was furnished every Wednesday to the guests. A :lip of paper, containing the name of the ow er,:was-crefully pinned to each, and the advice of-the proprietors was-that all should take their napkins up to their bed-rooms, at the conclusion of every meal, lest this distingIishing mark should become detached and unpleasant exchanges result from the loss. There was not one who did nfot appreciate the wisdomi of this counsel, when it was found that there would be no more clean table-linen until 'these had fulfilled their week. For two or three days, as the case might be, the absurd and increasingly soiled little rolls were carried up and down stairs, one,of the children being gener- ally appointed bearer for each family'; then, in very shame and disgust, they were tossed into the receptacle for dirty, linen, and such as had brought napkins of their own along,   A BATTLE: BtJMM    -T^.     345 in anticipation of picnics in g eenwood and on river, used theirs, while others had recourse to pocket-handkerchiefs. But, to-night, there were clean napkins, thanks to Man- tilini and the mangle; and 'the Misses Ketchum felicitated their visitors upon the luxury. Miss Jemima., who had been snappish at dinner-time to such a- degree that she felt her- self called upon to xemind- each one of her sisters that she was forgetting her position, had cooled down bysunset, or had concluded to bottle her wrath.,      -    - "Oh! oh  oh-h-h!" she said over her shoulder, -while pouring out the tea, at the side-table. Im't awashing- machine the invention of the age? Just +,think-! .we-washed out all the towels and table-linen for the whole establishment in one hour and ahalf!" . "Mama!" chirped Xnnie Bell,.   seel" poking five small, pink fingers through the like number of rents in her napkin . Everybody laughed, more heartily than the case seemed to warrant.  "Yes, dear," returned Miss Jemiinma nowise abashed; .." I meant to get some new ones this season, but they were too awfully dear. We ought to be thankful to have -any.- I know some professed boarding-houses where -such a thing .as 4a napkin is never seen on the table. Now, we don't pretend to keep 'a boarding-house, but we do give our friends the comfortt of a home, let it cost what it may. EoAeylthing: is shockingly expensive, now; don't you think so,-Mrs. -Eaile? I paid fifteen cents. a pound for that very sugar you are: no; putting into your cup." "Indeed! ' answered the amiable -lady addressed, with' equal sincerity and politeness, ' I should not have supposed that it cost 'so much."  Another, but a partialy suppressed movement of applause. The guests were fast learning to mak!e common cause against o     .,D   3466      . A B&TTLES UMMER.' their oppressors;' a feeling manifested only by such slight , and :guarded exhibitions of sympathy. All were well-bred, accustomed to- elegane, some to luxuriousness of fare, and household appointme-nts. How they ASore their present mode ;fl life: was a puzzle even to themselves. But there were various thiins-that rendered a change of place a matter difficult of accomplishment. - It was now the" height of the fashionble season, and watering-places and country board- ing-houses had never been more crowded. It was almost hopeless-to think of securing lodgings for families at any of these, and the extreme heat of the weather- forbade a pre- mature tumrnto the-city life. This location all believed to be-healthy- besides being so remote from all public thor- oughfares as to make the removal' of baggage and babies a serious undertakng. Then, agan, Sthe society assembled here leaving out the Ketchums and-their lover assistant-- was irreproachable. Social and kindly, in feeling and con- duct, the boarders did much towards ithe relief of- one another- from the many- disagreeable features of their situ- ation.., For example: one: -gentleman, the head of a family, whoseiarnval had. -preceded -that of the Bells and Earles by - ten day s,having discovered that the scarcity. of eggs was, ' ,  like the -debiity of the],kitchen-fire a constitutional infirmity o he e     visited the neighboring-farms and ob;ained" the pomlise of a liberal supply of these desirable and popular -ediblesb, ;.Henceforward, )a dish of them always graced- the upperlFend-of ,the board, where sat the purchaser, and three ,as iinVariablyi found their way to the plates of Harry and Anna Bell and Bessie Earle, although their, parents grate- fully declined the polite offer of the delicacy for their own use. For degs were delicacies here, rare dainties upon a breakfast-table -where, day after, day, and week after week, the eyes of wistful "guests " were never greeted by a warm    i A BATTLE SIMEE.          847 biscuit or griddle-cake-of- any description; where the article ( bread" meaint always the four piles of 'sour whe at, and heavy rye; -where the beef was tough 'beyond comparison, and, to use an expressiv e, if a vulger term, 'c cowey '. t the. smell, giving, as Mr. Earle said, i, indubitabled-evidence of having borne the yoke im a youth that belonged -to the far past; "-where the.-ham, tat' sometimes diversified the bill-of. fare, was not unfrequently - tainted; *where- the potatoes were always grayish- and unpleasantly glutinous ; above all, where the hash, as 'was discovered by the horrified Mary, and testified to by the sickened Norah, was compounded of the miscellaneoius fragments of yesterday's feast,-in plain language, such portions of the scrapings from the plates as were deemed suitable for this savory dish! "Still," says some incredulous'reader, I cannot;compre- hend how they endured it t. 'If I liad been in the place of Mr. or Mrs. Bell, I would never have slept- a second night under the Ketchum roof." I dis;lre to divulge the fact,since I fear that it will lower my martyr'friends in the estimation of the lovers of moral courage; stamp them as arrant cowards in the minds of those who have never been so unlucky as to taste of similar experiences; but I cannot withhold the'statement that one of the most poweful dissuasives to the immediate and indig- nant departure of the diipes was the fear of AMiss JemTima's tongue!

It- was never your misfortune to witness the flash of the eye, the twist or the viragish upturning of the nose that accompanied and intensified the fulmination of some "stunner," like that hurled, on the evening of which we have just been speaking, at Mrs. Bonner, a gentle, lovely lady, wife to hm whom Bessie Earle gratefully styled "the egg gentleman.' The provocation for, Miss Jemima's petard would have appeared very slight to a distinterested looker-on. The bitter-sweet spinster, who was an inveterate gossip, pulling other people's vcharacters into shreds as' publicly as she' proclaimed the sacred sensibilities of her own refined nature, was dis- cussing the manners, appearance, etc., of a lady who had passed a part of the preceding summer in the enjoyment of the Ketchum hospitalities. As it happened, Mrs. Bonner was an acquaintance of the party assailed, and was stirred up by the uncharitable and sarcastic remarks of the hostess to,' defend the absentee. "She paid her bill, I presume," said the usually quiet mnatron, in a well-bred tone, but with a flushed cheek and kindling eye. So full of meaning was her face and intonation that all felt she had made a fair hit at Miss Jemima- the first on record except Norris' telling replies, whichit was whispered :he eldest sister bore with such singular meekness. m the ambitious hope of securing him as a life-long .partner for Horteisia. -Jemia was neither thick-skmined nor thick of skull. Talen by surprise she certainly was, but, she let no one perceieothis. Shesat'the teapot down with a thump and iwheeled upon the assailant.

If there is one vice upon earth that I can't, shan't, and wont tolerate, it is grumbling! My rule is to put it down instanter!" Everybody made a   mighty show. of being busy with his or her supper.. Mrs. Bonner was intimidated. Being a lady by. nature and breeding, she was unfit to contend with a ,loud-tongued -shrew. The rest of the company felt, and des- pised themselves for mean-spirited crayvens while they did so, that she, Mrs. Bonner, was effectually "put down," and that he must, in truth, be a valiant man of war who should attempt, after this volley, to grumble in Miss Jemima's hearing.  . The latter part of that July and the first week. in August were known throughout the country as "the heated termin." The newspapers teemed with stories of the extreme heat in - the cities;, how the thermometer stood at 100 in the shade, and eggs:were baked by the sunbeams, and men fell by the score in the scorhing streets, dying or dead from sunstroke. The Ketchum sisters were profuse and clamorous in their congratulations to their captives upon their immunity from these and the host of kindred disasters incident -to a sojourn in the "horrid, unhealthy town," and enumerated almost ad infinithum, quite ad nauseamn the manifold blessings they had purchased -by a judicious flight to this delectable refuge. And the unhappy twenty panted through the -breezeless nights, Oh close proximity to the hot roof, vainly fanning the damp or fevered faces resting on the coarse otton pillow- slips, hardly able to endure the weight-even of th:e scanty sheets; leaving their -doors. wide open until driven: to desperation by the hum and sting -of ravenous mosquitoes, then shutting themselves in and a few hundred of-. her tor-   menters' ou until, again urged to extriemityby suffocation, theyiadmitted all who chose to come. ]lesm. ]Mosquitoes never molested Miss Jemima. Tom Earle: said it was no wonder. He:was not so, harsh in his judgment, even: of these pests, as to suspect them of the depravvity of taste thft would lead them to eat her! -Heasvy-eyed and :spiritless, the boarders met at breakfast, and ate,: as well as they could force themselves to do, of the stereotyped abominations offered and commended to their attention, airily and pitilessly, 'by the trio of Graces - or Fates; this- work accomplished, they dispersed to seek a fresher atmosphere and quiet, if not efreshment, in orchard, :meadow, or wool, Community ef suffering is a sure bond of hearts, and in a marvellously short time the victims became warnly -attached to each, other,. and formed a mutual aid society,.   - iBut for our luncheons, we must have starved,' said Mrs. Be} lfeelingly,: in later months when the thin veil of mod- ;  terf contntment -with the "establishment "was rent away.

No:royal banquet could ever bring to the partakers thereof one tithe of the happiness or inspire one-hundredth part of' the admiration that thes  e simplrepasts xited in the breasts of the ltle creatures.

This was also dispensed from ,the convenient side-table, the dishes of vegetables being left upon the main-board for the family dinner, a labor-saving plan that waa not veryappetizing to the guests.

Five osix were compelled to partake of a tasteless rice pudding, or go without any nominally sweet conclusion to the csuiptuous banquet." Miss Jminna, as wasnow apparent, had foreseen khis shortcoming, and, with habitual shrewdness, looked out for Numnber 1. "The chicken was: not- very tender," remarked Mrs. Bell, on the piazzat, after dinner. "Still, it was pleasant -to see and taste poultry once again.

IT was a warm afternoon about a week after Harr had  performed the threefold part of accuser, witness and lawyer, and which, by the by, acquired additional and ala,ming strength from the pregnant fact that the suppositious"Old Whitey" was the S-ole representative of the feathered race that graced the oKetchum board while our parOY remained as lodgrs. in the farm-house. Georgie Rose stood .behind the curtains of the parlor window, watching the movements of a couple of equestrians just setting off for aAexcursion.  They were Mis. Hortensio, looking really quite prlUy and / graceful in her hat and riding-habit, mounted upon her pony, and Mr. Norris, who had brought his horse into the coun- try with him. Georgie regarded them with interest, that had in it no shade of envy. True, Hortensia was acknowledged by all of the boarders to be the least objectionable of the sisters, havingless affectation than Saccharissa, more :mniability than Jemimta, and better manRners than either. It was true, fur- thermore, that she invited Mr. Norris's attention, and sought his society, and that he was too thorough a gentleman to treat her otherwise than with courtesy; but the idea that their frequent rides and not so frequent strolls together, meant anything serious would have provoked- the Bell elique to contemptuous merriment. ; Georgie was not a practised horsewoman; therefore, could not venture, to mount Mr. ,Norris's spirited bay, and there was no, other asnimnl avail-  -               *'*   able for aladys use on the place, with the exceptionMiss -H0ortnsi's pony, and this, it was understood, she suffered no one :beside herself to ride. Moreover, -George .had enjoyed a'long sail, followedl by a walk, with Mr. Norris that forenoon, ard could afford to be generous, particularly a    shee had .heard Mifs a Hortensia dexterously banter her  -  cavarlier to accompay -her in this expedition.

Not knowing that they were ignorant of her proximity, Georgie retained her position, and thus became an innocent eaves- dropper to the family group. Ah, well, tiey wil  do it!" sighed Mr, Boulby, tilting his chair back against the nearest cherry-tree. "But that.

He has never seen B-,urey but is pleased:at his sister Hortersia' s engagement to Norris, of whom he has the highest opinion." Mr. Bonner shook his head -- but now in .aiament, not' doubt.            -  "I have: heard -hints- dropped by the other siste- about - 'Hortensia.'s beau,' and such stuff, but paid no attention to the foolish twaddle," Mrs Benner -observed slowly -au'if- re-  luctant to adnit the possibility of truth in -what she had just learned.,.

"She:is decidedly the best of the bunch," mused Mr. Bon- ner, desirous to put the best face possible upon the matter.

"He has been trifling in a base,; uinmanly way with our sweet little friend, Georgie- bse.; I feel as if I never wanted to speak to him again!" By this time Georgie was lying upon her hard couch up- stairs; the door locked, and her face buried in the pillow, lest the tearless sobs she could not suppress should penetrate the thin partition to her sisterns room. It was her first trial, and it had fallen with the suddenness and force of an aval- anche. "Perhaps I may meet my fate, this summer," she had said, in talking of their coming to this hateful place- said it in the lightness of girlish gayety, such joyous-hearted speech as she could never use again- never .! Mrs. Bell knocked at the door, an hour afterwards, to re- mind her that the teachell had rung. "Come in!" called a weak voice.          - Georgie had not loosened her dress, but she was on the -bed still, a wet handkerchief laid-over her brow and eyes. "I have a bad headache, Annie. I don't want any tea!" she said, huskily.    .  "My dear child! a headache on this-hot day, and in this close room! Why did you shut the door? Wouldn't you feel better if you were to come down-and get a little fresh air?" "No, no! please don't ask me! ' "There! I don't mean to tease you,!" soothed the sister, moved by the distressed tone, yet attributing it to physical pSA  1i "But let me undress you, an-d send you up a cup of tea."  Georgie submitted, as the easiestway of purrhasing soli- tude and freedom from questioning. While s.

And withered blossomnis are not lovely, Annie!        /  There was something desolate in the faint smile with which she said'this, that aroused Mrs. Bells fears, not for her young sister's happiness, but her health. She caried- the flowers into the other room; then, returning, recommended and administered a simple medicine; sent -Mary:to: the well *  for cool water, withl which to bathe the sufferer's handsand head, and while awaiting the girls return sat at the bedsie, fanning Georgie, and talkikg cheerfully to 'divert her thoughts from the pain.  "What an absurd set these Ketchums are!-" she said  laughing i "I passed Hortesisia in the hall, on my way from supper.

A good night's rest will quitecure you, I hope, dear." Whether the deficiency were in the quantity or quality of the prescribed specific, or that Mrs. Bell had mistaken the case in hand for a less serious malady, could not then be known, but it was. certain that the cure was not complete by morning, Georgie arose, indeed, and came down to the table with the rest, but breakfasting was an impossibility, try as she might to swallow a morsel of bread and drink a few spoon- fuls of the ambiguous fluid poured from the teapot. Her eyes were sunken and glassy, her lips parched, and her pulse de- noted fever. The Misses Ketchum were profuse in their ob- servations upon her appearance, each declaring loudly that she had never seen any one look worse, and Miss Jemima gloomily confident in her prophecy of an impending spell of, illnsess3, ^ -- "' But you couldn't be in a better place, if you are going to be: sick.

But-did you ever hear of anything so barbarous, -Mrs. Earle?- they had their carriage sent up from town, packed it with cush- e ions, and put the absolutely dying girl in it, and took her back to- the horrid, unhealthy low country! I said to her brother, as they were starting, ' I shall expect to hear of her death in aweek.' And ILdid-that is, in a little more than a fortnight. It was out-and-out murder and I shall always be glad that I told' them so, when I found they had deter- mined upon moving her. At any rate, I rejoiced that she didn't die here!" Georgie was walking, with slow and heavy steps, upon the piazza, vainly seeking cooling air for her oppressed lungs, tring bravely to keep up, and conceal the signs of the sick- ness she yet felt was gaining upon her, when Norris joined her. }"I am afraid that you are still suffering," he said, in sym- pathy that was both respectful and affectionate. "Do you attribute your headache to our long walk yesterday? I was-  troubled much, last night, by fears that this might have been the case. I ought not to have let you go so farin such ex- * tremely hot weather." "I am subject to severe headaches," Georgie comanded her voice to say steadily, but more distantly tho she de- signed to speak. An unskiled. actor, she overdi:her-part. "I never trouble myseff with conjectures as to the cause of these attacks."  o    Norris looked down quickly at her countenance - the cor-. rugated brow andpale, set lips. His own face was express- ive of ively-solicitude as he rejoined: "Can we -can your friends do nothing to alleviate your pain? It is sad to wit- ness suffering which one cannot relieve. Believe me," he added, y6t more gently, "I find the thought of yours very hard to endure. We have had many joyous hours together. I, wish-you cannot know how fervently--that I could bear. every pang that would otherwise fall to your lot." Georgie put her hand hurriedly to her head-. In her dis- tress and confusion, she really feared that he would hear the beating in her temples, so fast and loud was it to her ears. iow dared -he, the betrothed of another, address such lan- guge to her? Yet there was a convincing earnestness in his tone she could scarcely withstand.  "You are very kind," she said, stiffly. "I thank you for your good wishes, chimerical though they are. Excuse me, but I must go in. The light here is too strong for my eyes." Norris gazed after her as she turned into the house and ascended the staircase. His look betokened surprise, doubt, and concern. " an I have offended her? or is the change in her demeanor entirely the effect of physical pain?"The inquiry cost him much perturbed meditation for the next hour or' two. At ten o'clock he ordered his horse, and was absent until dinner-time. Georgie kept her room closely after that one unsuccessful attempt to appear well. It was not altogether the fear of encountering Norris's sctrtiny and attentions, or dread of the impertinent comments of the sisters Ketchum that held her prisoner. She was forced to acknowledge secretly that men- t I amn Jh had produced or aggravated the malady of the body. She had a chill at noon--not a heavy one, so she concealed the circumstances from her sister, imputing the '& ' ^   A BAN-TIl, bumata L- ge, in her ignorance of the disease, to nervous exitement, which, she was amed to betray.

F'ding, at her early monig visit, that her patient continued very feverish, asking frequetly for water, and com planing, whenqutioed, of headache, Mrs. Earle advised cantharis and bryo' , substitutig for -te latter, tovards evening, chamomilla, and returning tof th d specifi, aconite, in place of the formner- Thefebrile symptoms were not violent, but the sick girl wasconsumed  by a slow fire that took from her sleep; strength, and appe- tite.                       s n By the evening of the third day of her illness, a fresh causeof anxiety appeared. tttle Annie was seized with a chill, succeeded, as Georgie's had been, by a fever. Miss Jemima "( hoped," at supper, "that the sweet angel had not caught her aunt's comiplant.

"Mr. Norris should have been present to appreciate the insinuated corn. parison. Whenever I think of that affair, I groan with Miss Betsy Trotwood, ' Blind, blind, blind.!'  The Bell parky hardly heard this conversation, so absorbed were they in reflection upon their real trouble. The ladies vrent back to Georgie's room, at the conclusion of the meal; the gentlemen lighted their Cigars, and paced the long piaa in serious discussion of their trying situation. The night was hot and airless, yet damp, with a sort of depressing, bieiging moisture, like most other nights in that locality.

The Bonners had gone down the- road- to take- the exercise .they 'could not enjoy during the day, by reasonof the fierce heat of the sun. The house was unusually still, none of the family being out of doors or in the parlor; but there was a queer,muffled noise in the cellar, like the grinding of a coffee-mill. "If, the idea were warranted by any precedent, I should say that that was the sound of an ice-cream freezer," said Mr. Bell.

He puffed away savagely .at his cigar. They walked for awhile in silence, when - a hor'seIman galloped sharpiy down the hill, rode into the barnyard, and called the hostler. "There is Norris!" said Mr. Bell. "He will get his supper, I suppose, rigid as are Miss jemima's rules of punc- tuality." ' She wont bring him up to the mark I' returned the other.

"Fiddlesticks!" began Mr. Bell, bift Norris's nearer approach prevented further speech on this point.  He saluted-his fellow-boarders courteously, but with a gravity that impressed them with a-sense of coming evil. "Another warm, close light!" said Mr. Bell. V ery sultry!,'  Norris had got thus far, when a figure darted from ground the end of the'house, "O Mr. Norris! just step here for one minute." It was Miss Hortensia, who, Norris having very 'deliber- ately obeyed the summons, whispered- loudly and rapidly to him for, not only ohe but several, minutes. "I can't promise!   replied he, carelessly, malking a movement to rejoin his friends.  "Don't wait too long, or you will repent it!"she said archly, and vanished.- "How is Miss Rose to-night?" queried Norris of Mr. Bell. o   370        A BAoToE SUlW'U.     . "Quite sick, I fear," was the reply. "And our  ttle Anniee has sickened also, with similar symptoms.. We are fearful that the fever-or whatever the disease may b- iscontagious."            '  "Has it not occurred to you that it may rather be indu!ed by local auses?" asked Norris, sd pointedly that his a di tors halted in their walk, struck with consternation. S "No! to what causes do you refer?" asked Mr. Earlc "We were assured of the healthfulness of this region by a reputable medical man," returned Mr. -Bell "-One who had spent a snmmer in this very house." "Come with me, if you please!" requested Norris. They followed him to a point in the yard from which the river was visible. "Do you see the sheet of white fog rising from that slug- gish stream, and slowly unfoldirng itself over the meadows? ,Do you smellthe rank and decaying vegetable matter, cover- ing its banks? Have you noticed that, within the past week, every frog-pond in thoe low grounds is clothed with green scum? I tell you, sir, that this August sun is breed- ing malaria ,and death in those confounded bogs, and I,-- like a ;blind fool, - selfsh i] the enjoyment of my own excellent health, never gave these significant signs a thought until within three days. I eo not know the name of the medical man who- vouched for the salubrity of this pestilen- tial atmosphere, but I happened to have heard of another, - as competent and worthy physician, living about eight miles from this house, --and, becoming ill at ease after my atten- tion was called to this subject by your sister's sickness, I determined to see and consult him. I failed to find him at home yesterday, and the day before. This afternoon f was more fortunate, and had a long talk with him. He tells me that, in a hot, damp season like the present, this place is no. torious for ague and fever- to .say nothing of frequent        *    A BATTLE SUMRR.         371. cases of remittent and even typhoid. Mydear sir,"- 1 ing his hand heavily upon Mr. Bell's shoulder,- I do not repeat this to alarm you, but to urge you, by every argument in my power, to lose no time in removing your family from these deadly influences. When I think of the- misebief that may already have .occurred from my culpable negligence, I am driven almost to desperation!" Shocked and -alarmed as they were by this unexpected revelation, his hearers pitied his evident distress; wereim- pelled to soothe what appeared to them morbid and unwar- rantable self-accusations. "My dear fellow! the fault was ours, not yours, if fault there has been," remonstrated Mr. Earle. "You have but yourself to care for. We ought to have kept a bright look- out for anything and everything likely to affect the wives' and babies. The plain truth is that,-from beginning to end, this whole bl;siness has been an outrageous sell-a pitiable farce throughout. "Pray Heaven the farce be not changed into tragedy!" said Mr. Bell, earnestly. "I thaqk you, from my soul, Nor- ris, for your warning. I meant to call in a physician to- morrow. Your care and consideration for my treasures have exceeded mine." "Ronald!" called his wife's voice from the house. "Is that you?" He approached her.  The others, standing in the shadow of the trees, rermained unobserved by her, but were within hearing of her agitated address, archer husband reaphed the porch where she stood. "Ronald, dear! cannot we leave this wretched place to- 'morrow? I want to go home!" . "Why, Annie! dear child! what has happened?" "Whatt may seem .d trifle   to you, but :which has aroused me beyond control. You know that I haye tried to ^*.       *   ' * 4-      A BATTLE SUMMER .  i make the best of this miserable experiment in summer- boarding. I was most to blame for our coming"- " There was no blame in the case!" interrupted her huc- cand. "It was an error of judgment in us all. Butwhat is the latest enormity?"  "Just this. Georgie craves nothing but ice, and yester- day I asked Miss Jemima if I might send Harry to the ice- house now and then for a little. She said 'Yes,' not very graciously, but I was not inclined to be over-proud where Georgie's cotmfort was concerned. 'So Harry went twice, yesterday, bringing up each time a lump about double the sizeof his fist. This morning he got another, and one again a noon, neither larger than the first supply. Georgie being very thirsty to-night, I dispatched Ilarry, about ten minutes since, witht Mary to hold the light for him, to get more. Would you believe it? that *Burley and Saccharissa came out of the cellar, as they were passing on their way to the ice- house, and called to them that they could not go down. The ice, was locked up, they said'; that Mrs. Bell had already wasted several pounds of it in two days, and if things went on in-this style there would be none left before long to keep the meat fresh.' ' Harry explained that it was wanted for his sick aunt, but it was useless to plead with them.  But, now hear the rest! As I came down stairs just now, resolving to see to the matter myself, the dining-room door was opened, and Daffy-came out. Miss Jemimha ordered her to shut it after hers and this attracting my attention, I glanced in. The three sisters were-there and Mr. Burley- he in the act of emptying an ice-cream, freezer into a dish! Then Hor- 'tensia rushed forwarnd a slammed the door, and ;I compre- hended that it was a family feast, tcrwhich we were not to be admnitted.  And this, while our poor girl is refused a bit of ice to cool her- parched tongue! Dear Ronald,! if Georgie can travel, I will not stay here a day longer!'   A    BTT U E.        373 "I Mr. Norris! where is Mr Norris?" said the weak pipe of the bound girl, as she shuffled out upon the piazza. "Here I am! what do you want?" in a harsh, dry tone. "Miss Hortensia says, 'Come right away, sir, or your share will all be melted! '" drawled Daffy, who was either a great dunce, or a knave who affected stupidity.  "Say to Miss BHortensia - or stay! I will speak to the ladies myself." He entered the house. "Ahem! an invitation- to the private ice-cream saloon!" said Mr. Earle. "Ronald! you don't ask my opinion of this house, but you are welcome to it. It is a diabolical hole, and fitly tenanted. I  eigrate to-morrow, if there is a conveyance to be had within a circuit of thirty, miles!" "We are agreed upon that," responded Mr. Bell, calmly. "Annie, Mr. Norris says" -Then followed an abstract of their friend's sanitary report. The story made' the mother wild with remorse, anxiety, and impatience to depart. Tears flowed down her cheeks as she listened.   * "If our darlings should fall victims to our criminal want of foresight, I should never forgive myself! Poor Georgie! I feel like a murderess when I think of her!" \ "Mrs Bell!" Norris accosted her with habitual politeness, but there was a tremor in his voice that told he had heard her last remark.             . u I hope that your sister knows -nothing of the inhuma answer returned to your application for ice." "I could not bear to tell her!" "I am thankful that you- could not. Please take this to her, without mentioning how you obtained it." He gave her a small basket, loaded with the coveted luxury, and' checking her ardent thanks, turned to the gentlemen to   374       4 BATTLI SUMv e ffer his services in procuring vhicles- for-the transportation of the two ,nm-ili es and their effects homewards Mrs. Bell was prudently silent-to CGeorgi with respect to their:anticipated itting, but in the other rooms, the work of prepmration went: on vigrously as quietly. Before the two matrons and their hsdmaaidens lay-down to nominaXl:re- pse upn their. to -heart.  u mattresses, every trunk was, packed and strapped, and the children's travelling-gear laid out ready for them to don early in the morning, "- ill' ands a'd glad heartsmalkes quick work!" said MaL to Noriah, when they .were shut in their hot closet un. der the-roof.

Shure, and they're the only crayturs that ever gits their full to ate in this house-bad Georgie slept better .that night than did her sister, who, the packing having been completed, relieved Mrs.. Earle's watch in. the- chamber, throwing herielf down beside her sickchild. The short snmmer night was long to the moth- er's anous heart, late as it was when she sought her couch.. Lying there, filled with vain repentance for the mistake that had .entailed so much of. nnoyance, discomfort, and positive suffer ,n upon those she loved, she watched the gray dawn grow into the clear day; the pale morn's blush atthe coming ofezd bniadegr   the .un-; listened to the sounds of awake'ng life without and'. below; the twittering of birds the crowingof ohiekens, the hungry squeal of--pigswhose sty wa:.;,pl.,e tly. near -the house, and. betweens. it and the rxer,-reder  m g t ecoolest breezes that isited the heated ::tealboad, anigase,  ezen t,', Ms JmieartB  was early Abroad, and in great sltength, even   A BATTLE SmUmE.

Before the sun had showed his uppermost: rim above the hills, she had, in Mrs. Bell's heauing, boxed affy once, threatened her three times with a repetition of the pun- ishment,.and'.enjoined each of her sisters separately and ven- omously not to forget .her position. Then came upon the scene of matutinal industry the invaluable Burley, to assume his share of housewifely cares  It was whispered i-mong the "guests" of the surprising elder sister that she didos little, or, to speak more truly, not a little ogling of her riglit- hand man on 'her -own, private account; that, should he be finally discarded by the coquettish Saccharissa, he need not go far to seek solace for his bruised heart in another's favor.' It was not to be disputed that -her nose regarded his approach with signal amiability, and her wiry tones had a certain sweetness in addressing him, meant to be engaging, but re- minding unprejudiced hearers strongly of fermenting sirup. How often had Georgie lain in the corner beneath the square ventilator,  opening upon the stair-case, and laughed -at the dialogues between the precious pair, as they per-formed their joint task of setting the house in order! "If you could only hear her quote' I never loved a dear gazelle' I Georgie had once said to her sister. 'It was too amusing -delivered in her high key, and interpolated by directions how to handle the dust-pan and broom!" Mrs. Bell smiled sadly, as this was recalled by the spin- ster's greeting on this morning. "Good-morrow, Monsieur Burley l- Another  charriing day, you see as fair as the 'rose, newly washed by, the shower, which Mary to Anna. conveyedP' -:You- remeber how 'the plentiful moisture encumbered the flower,v and weighed'down its :beautiful' head.'

I do wish Mr. Norris would not leave his boat-shawl lying here, all of a heap; But he hasn't' behaved like a sane man for these four weeks! I never saw any one deteriorate as he has done lately. It is absolutely infamous." Mrs. Bell raised her head to look over. to Georgie's bed. She lay perfectly quiet, her face turned to the wall, appar- ently in a a peaceful slumber, and her sister, fearing to dis- turb her by any change in her own position, could do noth- ing but lie still and listen to what followed. the colloquists had either forgotten that every word must be audible in Miss Rose's room, or, supposing her to be its only occupant, be- side the sleeping child, were maliciously talking at her. Burley was on the top step, brushingaway at the faded stair- carpet. Mrs. Bell could hear the heavy breathing caused by his stooping posture. - "Hewas off by three o'clock for a ride. Where has he gone?" he asked. ' Mercy knows!I- don't care! I had my say out to him - last night, and I promise you that he got a dose of 'tolerably plain English. If my dear, spirited brother, who is now serving his country ,abroad, 'had -been here, he would have had a horse-whipping as well. I imagine he has gone to Jones's " (a hotel ten miles distant) "to hire a carriage for his hew friends. You know that our house loses its choicest treasures to-day?" in fiercerrony.      , "Saccharissa told me so just no.;" "And our gallant knight-errant has called for his bill, and 9.( ^ ' - .    A BATILE SUMER.          T7 is to act as out-rider!" pursued Miss Jemima, more sardon- ically. "A good riddance, I say!  I told Hortensia just how it would turn out, the very day I found them billing and cooing up there in the woods! I said that she was a sly, designing piece, the first night I saw her. Idon't pre- tend to be so awfully modest aud fastidious; Iam not a shy mimosa or a shrinking dove, or any'of that sort of nonsense! but I do thank my stars, that I have too nice a sense of pro- priety to go boating, and rambling, and flower-gathering, and flirting with a strange young man, of whose character I know nothing, upon three days' acquaintance! I mayn't be so beautiful, or elegant,- or accomplished, assome people think themselves, but I ant too much of a lady, not to say a decent Christian woman, to angle for another woman's beau. For my paft, I had rather bob for eels and catch mud-turtles all my days, much as the sight of the innocentthings shock fine ladies' nerves, than be guilty of so unhandsome an action, such a base violation of the respect and gratitude due' an unsuspecting, kind, confiding, and generous hostess!" This preposterous climax brought Mrs.- Bell to 'her feet. She could remain passive no longer. Burley's voice arrested her unwise impulse to leave the room and face the slanderer' of her pure, noble sister. ," How does Hortensia feel about the rupture?" he in- quired. "There, the stairs are done. Will that do?" i "Beautifully! How expeditious you are!  This hall, . now. Look sharp to the comers, and brush dowh the cob- webs. I am proud to say that Hortensia shows more pluck than one would expect. She says it is, no doubt, a happy escape for her; but it is easy to see that the poor girl bleeds inwardly.

It' was a lovely, moonlight evening. Mr. and Mrs. Bell were enjoying it at one window, the gas being turned down to a spark, glimmering like a glow-worm through the porce- lain shade of the chop-light. Within the recess of another, a' bay'window at the opposite end of the room, were two more figures, seated as closely together as was. the married pair. One of these arose at the abrupt address of the visitor. I! will give it a respectful hearing, at least. What is it,?  ;   ' '    - , My wife and I have been talking it over, and we agree that nothing could be more felicitous and appropriate," con- tinued Mr. Earle, helping himself to a chair. Speak for yourself, if you please," interposed that lady. 'C Georgie, dear, don't mind his nonsense!" "My grand idea is this, good people I Annie, are you listening? I move, that this twain, to be one the day after to-morrow, shall perform a bridal pilgrimage 'to Roaring River." "Tom Earle I if your wife;doesnt feel it to be her solemn duty to box your ears, I do!" cried Mrs. Bell, flying towards him.   880       A BATTLE BSUMMR. In the bustle that ensaed, George slipped from the room, Norris, seeking her presently, found her on the piazza, lean. ing over the railing in an attitude of thoughtfulness. Hei reverie was not so deep that she did not hear his footsteps. Meeting her with a mute caress as she turned towards him, - he drew ier hand within his own, and they began to walk up and down the floor, checkered by the shadows of the embow- A ering creepers. Norris broke the eloquent silence. "You- did not stay to vote upon Mr. Earle's motion." I' -delegated that duty to you. Women have not the right of suffrage."                  . "You had no fear, then, lest a lingering tendresse for Miss Hortensia should bias my decision?" She laughed gayly. "I did not think of that. Perhaps my confidence was rash, after all." "Do you know, little one," Norris resunmed tenderly, while his words conveyed a rebuke, "that the sole cause of, domplasint I have ever had- against you, was your unjust judgment of me in that affair? It is all a dark, sad dream to me; looking back out of the sunshine of perfect love and trust in whichwe now live, your credence of that labsurd. and, to me, dishonoring report of my attachment to another, and that 'other--Miss Jemima's sister! Then came- the train of painful misunderstandings brought on by that belief; doubt, and estrangement, and, suffering. But for your sister, I fear we would never have been reconciled, I could not understand your freezing disdain, and enigmaticalallusions to my fickleness, and you refused to believe in the reality of my devotion. She came to my relief with the story of a conversation purposely held in your hearing ,and hers, when it was positively known that the game was lost, and I began to suspect the iniquitous plot. You must pledge undoubting faith in me'from this time, henceforth and forever, mly beauty, to make amends for this tremendous mistake."   A. BANTE sumME.         381 "I suffered, too, Jaames" said Georgie, Ji a low tone. "As you never shall again, Heayen helping me!  One thng I do owe Roaring River-I there met you for the first time. As to the darker pages of )our experience there, let this be the token that they are sealed fast, never more to be opened." And, bending forward-but, as this is not a sentimental story, we will break off modestly just here, and return to the quartette left within doors. "Yes, we acted for once in our lives like nmitiated donkeys!"Mr. Earle was saying, with his us .al candor: "Still, except for Georgie's spell of sickness, and little Annie's month of fever and ague, I would not regret the lesson. It was pretty severe, but it will stick by us- for the rest of our lives. After this, seeing is believing with me, and I will know for myself, before I go rusticating, whether I am to be a bonafide boarder, who pays a fair, liberal price for good fare, good beds, and good air, to one who takes me With the hope of making money honestly, and isn't ashamed to own it, or whether I am to enter a private family where they' receive a few friends, just for company? and- am to submit in silence to detestable food, poisonous malaria, musty towels and rancid napkins, and beds that would disgrace a squatter's hovel, besides being bored to 'death by a set of predestined old maids, as full of cranks, and notions, and affectations as an egg is of meat, who treat me as their social equal, if not their inferior, and pull caps with my sister fo r her beau, and who, after cheating us for six weeks, abuse us like pickpockets because we fly for our lives from their- odious den and more odious society." "Did Norris tell you that he had picked up some ugly facts touching Burley's antecedents?" asked Mr. Bell. "No :, what are they?" "His real profession is, it appears, that of 'confidence many. combining the characters of jockey, swindler, and   8A382       As-   E a  sU R. blfakleg generally. Happe ingi to cast his eyes upon the snug Kethum: farm, he concluded to make- such arrange. ments as would, secure it as a permanent summer retreat when business was slack, or the public faith inhim below par. :Nomris heard- the tale- from Mr.. Boulby. -He had just seen his friend, the 'brother in the city.' -This young man, who is, James says, really-a fie, sensible fellow, paid his- sisters a visit last fall, and was introduced to. his pro- spective brother-in-law. He recognized him instantly as the notorious' snp 1 have described, exposed lhim on the spot, and ended his unflattering remarks to him by kicking the  gallant scullion out of the house." "Good!" fIr. Earle slapped his knee in applause. "I always said that he was an impostor; that his talk about ,hij 'sea"ide home," his hints of high respectability in his own neighborhood, and palaver about minvestments' and ' handsome property,' while he was danglng like a low-bred kitchen scrub at the heels of his dulcinsa 'inurls and ealico, would prove to be, likethe e other pretensions of the finm, hothing but bosh!" ,TE END, , -' ^ ;  *  , ' \       ;           .  ,    1EW BiOOEKSn  And  New  Editions Recently    Issued: by / cARIETONJ Publisher, New Yr          -- [Madison- Square, corner Fiftht Av. and Broadway.] dN.
