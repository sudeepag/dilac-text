JESSAMNE. CHAPTER  I. A YOUNG girl lay upon a lounge in the recess of an oriel-window. If disease held her there, it had not altered the contour of the smooth cheek, or made shallow the dimples in wrist and elbow of the arm supporting her head; had not unbent the spirited bow of the mouth, or dimmed the glad light of the gray eyes. Most people called these black, de- ceived by the shadow of the jetty lashes. They were wide open, now, and the light of a sunny mid-day streamed in upon her face through the window, yet the upper part of the irid was darkened by the heavy fringe that matched in line the well-defined brows. Her hair, also black, with purple reflections glancing from every coil and: fold, was braided into a coronal, and about the, heavy": plait knotted at the back of the head was twisted a -al- a  I    12         JESSAMXI7YE. wreath of yellow jessamine. Her skin was dark and clear, but she had usually little color; her forehead was not re- markable for breadth or height; the nose was awnonde- script, and the mouth rather piquant than pretty, with suggestions of wilfulness in the fall, lower lip, and the 'slight, downward lines at -the corners.-- Her dress was white muslin, with no ornament beyond the gold clasp of her girdle, and a spray of jessamine at her throat. The casement was canopied with the vine from which this last had been plucked. Hundreds of bright bells were swinging lazily in the warm breeze, and were tossed into livelier motion and perfume by the kisses of brown- coated bees and vivid humming-birds. Heightening the glow of the tropical creeper, while they relieved the eye of the spectators drooped still, lilac clusters of wisteria, and these the girl put aside with impatient fingers when sie raised herself upon her elbow to obtain a better view of the outer scene. A flower-garden, lively with Spring blossoms, opened through a wicket in the white fence into a church-yard-green and level on the roadside-  green likewise, but swelling into long ranks of unequal and motionless billows behind the building. This was an ancient structure, as was shown by the latticed win- dows with rounded tops, and the quaint base of. the steeple that yet tapered gracefully into a shimmering point -ainst the pale noon of the sky. But loving eyes had watched it, and reverent hands guarded it against decay. The brick walls were sound, the masonry of gray:,stone about windows and doors smooth and solid with;, ment made hard as the stone by years and weather. The sward was shaven evenly, and the two grt elms at:the entrance to the-rural sanctuary were   JESSA MN E. -        13 the pride of the region. A double row of these trees bordered the road for a hundred yards in either direc- tion, and now offered shade and coolness to an orderly herd of horses tethered beneath them. A few handsome equipages were there, two or three stately family car- riages and several jauntv buggies, but most of the ve- hicles to which the animals were attached, bore the stamp of rusticity, hard usage, and infrequent ablutions, while the preponderance of roadsters and ponderous draught- borses over blooded stock, betokened that in this, as in other agricultural districts, the beautiful was held in sub- ordination to the useful. The little church, thanks to the taste of the present pastor and. the economical proelivi- ties of past generations, had escaped the vulgarizing in- fluence of "a good coat of paint."  Slow circles of lichens, hoary and russet, had toned down the original ruddiness of the bricks, and green mosses dotted' the slated roof. It stood on the edge of a cup-like valley, surrounded by mountains. So near was the lofty chain on the north-east, that the rising sun sent the shadow of the Anak of the range-"Old Windbeam," across the graveyard to the foot of' the sacred walls; so remote on the west that the Day-god looked his last upon the fertile pastures, winding streams, and peaceful homesteads, over hills round and blue with distance. The watcher in the oriel-window saw neither flowers nor elms; noticed the throng of patient dumb horses and motley collection of carriages as little as she did the mountains, near and far. Every feature Wasistirredwith exultant wistfulness, and her eyes never movd'firom a certain window of the church from which thei- a shutters had been folded back: The house was': Id  - '-  * 'e   a ' *? -c '"-1 ^ ^ ^   "        JhSSA'mJs . packed with living beings-she colcld see through this-- *galleries and aisles, as well as pews, and dimly, in the dusky interior, she discerned an upright - and animated figure-the orator of the occasion. Into the heat and hush of high noon--heat fragrant with waves of odor from resinous woods, and clover-fields, and garden-borders -a hush to which the tinkling bells of browsing kine in the meadows; and the hum of bird and bee close by, brought a deeper lull instead of interruption-flowed a voict sonorous and- sweet; now calm in argument or narrative-now, breaking into short, abrupt bursts of im- passioned declamation; anon, rising with earnest, majes- tic measures, most musical of all, that brought words with the varied inflections, to the rapt listener. .Smiles and tears came to her with the hearing; light that was glory to the eyes; softness that was 'tenderness, not sor- row, to the sensitive mouth. When the speaker's tones were drowned by the storm of applause that shook-the church, and the mass of human heads swayed to and fro as did the cedars in Old Wind- beam's crown on gusty Winter nights, the girl fell back up  4n h*cushions and fairly sobbed with excitement. '":y hero! my king!" A slight bustle in the hall distracted her attention, and warned her of the necessity of self-control. A man's voice questioned, and a woman's-provincial and drawl- ingI--replied, and steps approached the parlor. "Here's a gentleman wants Mr. Fordham, Miss Jes- sie", said-an ungainly country girl, opening the door. Aiftsh figure bowed upon the threshold. : i:^ :m an intruder, I fear,": he said, taking in at once : -*l'e dicts of the young lady's inability to rise from her   JESSAMNE.          15 sofa, and, the confusion that burined in her dark cheek at the unexpected apparition. "But they told me at the hotel below that I should find Mr. Fordham here. He is my cousin." The glow remained in all its brightness, but it was- painful no longer, as she held out her hand. "Then you are Mr. W   yllys?" smiling cordially. "You are very welcome." She waved him to a chair near her lounge with an air of proud, but unconscious, grace, that did not escape the visitor. "I am sorry you did not arrive in season to participate in the celebration of our Centennial. You know, I sup- pose, that Mr. Fordham is the, orator of the day-?  Warily observant, with eyes that habitually looked careless, and were never off guard, Mr. Wyllys remarked the smile and glance through the window at the church, which accompanied this bit of information, but his reply evinced no knowledge of aught beyond what was conveyed - by her words.           "I should be ashamed, to confess -it, but I was not- .. aware until this moment that any public celebration was :" going on, unless it were a religious service in the chuchi -a saint's day or other solemn festival. Is this, then, the anniversary of a notable event in the history of your lovely valley?" There was a tincture of commiseration for ignorancoe minigled with her surprise at the question that mustagve .e diverted the stranger if his sense of humor waskeen.- Heri :; answer was grave as befitted the importance of theiubject, :?- ; t o "The founder of this colony among the hills^wa::   ::::  direct descendant of the Scotch Covenanters--one Dav: ;: \- "- "'i"/^W^   16         J'ESSAMNE. y  Dundee, from whom the settlement took its name. He     emigrated with a large family of sturdy boys and girls,  and his report of the rich lands and genial climate of his new home drew after him  many others-all from his    { native land--most of them his former friends and neigh- '. bors. They cleared away forests, built houses, dug, and ploughed, and reaped, and worshipped GOD after the fashion of their fathers, having, within fifteen years after David Dundee's establishment of himself and household here, erected the substantial church you see over there. At the time of the breaking out of the French and Indian war, there was not a more prosperous and happy commu- nity in the State. In response to the call to arms, the bravest and best of the young and middle-aged men formed themselves into a- company and marched .away to fighlt as zealously and conscientiously as they had felled - the woods and tilled the ground. A mere handful-'and  most of these infirm from age and disease-remained with the women and children, upon whom devolved much   i and heavy labor if they would retain plenty and comfort i in their homes. They were literally hewers of wood and  j drawers of water; they sowed the fields and gardens, and gathered in the crops with their own hands-these heroic  great-grandmothers of ours!--herded their cattle and re- paired their houses, besides performing the ordinary tasks o4f housewives. And-one and all-they learned and     ! practised the use of fire-arms, kept muskets beside cradles and kneading-troughs, and when they met for worship on  , Sabbath, mothers carried their babies on the left arm, a i gun upon the right. One day, late in April-perhaps as   i fair and sweet a day as this-news came to this secluded  i hamlet that a large body of 'the enelmy '-chiefly Indi- A   JESSAMNSi.          -  ans and half-breeds--was approaching. Providentially,  old David Dundee was at home on a furlough of three days-he asked no more-that he might rally somewhat after the amputation of his left arm in hospital. Be had the church bell rung (it was a present from a Scottish lord, and it hangs still in the steeple), and after a brief consultation upon the green in front of the 'kirk,' with the wisest of his neighbors--a council of war from which women were not excluded-he collected the entire popu- lation into the church, first allowing them one hour in vlwhich to bury or otherwise secrete their valuables. The feebler women and the children were sent, for safety, into the cellar, which extends under the whole building; the lower parts of the windows were barricaded with feather- beds and mattresses, with loop-holes through which guns could be thrust, and these stout-hearted matrons and young girls volunteered to defend. The men were mus- tered in the galleries. A sentinel from the bell-tower soon gave warning that the foe was in sight.' From their loop-holes the colonists saw their houses and barns fired, their horses and other stock maimed and butchered, gar- dens, fields, and orchards wantonly laid waste; but not a woman wept or a man swore or groaned in the crowded church. On they came, flushed with success, ravening for hurman blood. David Dundee spoke twice before the uproar without made hearing, even of his stentorian voice, impossible. ' Haud your -fire 'till ye hear me gie the word I' he said, when his small army looked to him for orders, as savages and half-breeds rushed forward to surround the building. A minute later---' The Lord have  . maircy upon their souls, for we'll hae nane upon their; -? : bodies I Fre!!'   18         JESSAME.              e "The fight was a fierce one, and lasted until nightfall." i: '"Then,' says the Chronicler of the story-' seeing that i the enemy had withdrawn a little space, we thankedthe  GOD of battles, and took some refreshment; then set about caring for our wounded and preparing for the renewed attack we. believed the savages were about to make. Finding the hurt of our leader, David Dundee, to be mortal, and that our ammunition was well-nigh exhausted, and being, in consequence, sore distraught in spirit, we gave ourselves anew to prayer-then, stood I to our armses!     '             - "Wasn't that grand I " the girl interrupted herself to say-her wide eyes all a-light with fire and dew. "Glorious! One likes to remember that upon such a foundation as your Dundee and his followers our Re- public was built," assented the listener. "And, then?" j  ".And, then,"-taking up the words with singleness   if of interpretation anda grave simplicity that nearly pro i yoked the auditor to a- smile--"the darkness closed down and hid the foe from their sight. With the dawn came   il a glad surprise. The invaders had retreated, bearing  their dead and wounded with them. The garrison had lost but twenty in all-five of them being women.  They were buried in the graveyard over there-with the exception of the rugged old chieftain, who was interred directly under the pulpit. All this happened a hundred years ago. .When Mr. Fordham was here,1 last summer, the committee having the centennial an-    niversary in charge, requested him to deliver the oration." - :! "I am somewhat surprised that he has never mentioned  1 this new distinction to me, although I knew his modesty to be equal to his ability," said the visitor.      i       'f^     I   JC'SSffA M1 .        ,t o The black brows were knit and the lip curled. "It is 'no distinction' to him to deliver an historical address to a crowd of yeomen, you may think-and rightly! His consent to do this is a proof of his kind- ness of heart and willingness to oblige'his friends. I understand as well as you do, that our pride in the one event that has made our valley memorable in the history of our country, may seem overstrained to absurdity in the eyes of others. But there are some in Mr. Fordham's audience who appreciate his talents, and all admire. Listen!" her forehead smoothing as the applause 'broke forth again. Mr. Wyllys was too well-bred to recall to her mind what she should have learned from his frank avowal of ignorance of her cherished tradition,-namely-that -the "one event" had been, in that hurrying modern age, forgotten by the world outside the noble amphi- theatre of hills. The country girl had told the story well; her face had been an engaging study while she talked, and there was novel refreshment in her naive belief that the tale must interest him as much as it did herself. Otherwise, he might have found the recital a bore. "You misunderstood me if you imagined that I in- tended to sneer-did: me an injustice you will not repeat when you are better acquainted with me. The highe! honor that can be awarded the American citizen is the- opportunity to serve the people. And my cousin-any  man-might well be proud of the complmment conveyed , in the invitation to be speaker on anccasiolike t i-. .  The theme should be, of itself, inspiration. I ..am. ..  posed to quarrel with him for excluding m:. :.-:i. -  20         JESSA MLArE. number of his hearers. His reserve on the subject of the appreciation that meets his worth and talents every- where .is sometimes trying to the temper of those who know how to value these, and the reputation they have won for him." "He is singularly modest. But that is a characteristic of true merit," said the\ young lady, laconically. "You came down from Hamilton to-day?" "I did!" with a slight shrug of the shoulder and a comic lifting of the eyebrows. "Actually arising at four o'clock to take the train. I saw the sun rise, for the first time in twenty years. Your home is very beautiful, Miss Kirke." "We think so. I ought to, for I was born here and have known no other. But I am  not Miss Kirke-only Miss Jessie. My elder sister is in the church. When she comes home, she will play the hostess better than I do." "Excuse me for saying that you are scarcely a compe- tent judge on that point." She met the gallantry with the half-petulant expression and gesture that had answeredhis allusion to his cousin's "new distinction." "I did not say that to provoke flattery. Apart from the truth that my sister is my superior in nearly every- thing that goes to make up the dignified lady, she is, just now, in better physical trim than I can boast. I sprained my   foot a week ago," smiling, and blushing so brightly as to arouse the spectator's curiosity--" and I am for- bidden to use it, as yet." She turned her face to the window  as the crash of a: brass band proclaimed that the oration was at an   JESSA IANE.         21 end. While she beat time on the sill to the patriotic strains the visitor inspected the room and its appoint- ments. It was a square parlor, low-browed and spacious, and wainscoated with oak. Venerable portraits adorned the walls, and the furniture belonged to the era when ma- hogany was plentiful and upholstery expensive, if one might judge from the disproportion in the quantity of polished wood and that of cushions. A modern piano was there, however, and the carpet was new and hand- some. The lounge on which Jessie lay was evidently the workmanship of a neighborhood carpenter, but was far more comfortable than the stately sofas at opposite ends of the apartment, being broad arid deeply cushioned, and covered with a pretty chintz pattern. An old china bowl, full of pond-lilies, was upon the centre-table; tall vases of the same material and antique style stood on the mantel, and a precious cabinet of carved wood--Mr. Wyllys wondered if the owners knew how precious--was in a far corner. The most conspicuous ornament of the room was a large picture that hung over the mantel. - It was a portrait of the second daughter of the house, taken several years before, for it represented a girl of sixteen, kneeling beside a forest spring. She had just filled a leaf-cup with water, and, in the act of raising it. to her lips, glanced at the spectator with a smile of saucy triumph,-a face so'radiant with roguish glee as to win the gravest to an answering gleam. The likeness was striking still, and the painting excellent. The figure. was spirited, the attitude one of negligent grace, and the accessories to the principal object were well brought. in. A vista in the woods- revealed the craggy front of Wind-    22         JESSAMNZE.  beam, and about the old beech, shading the spring, clung a jessamine in full flower. Mr. Wyllys got up to take a nearer view of the picture, and Jessie looked around. "That is one of my father's treasures," she said, with- out a tinge of embarrassment or affectation at seeing him intent upon the scrutiny of her portrait. "It was painted by H   " pronouncing a celebrated name. "He spent a summer in this neighborhood, four years since. He was with us on a picnic to the wishing-well- every county has a wishing-well, hasn't it?--and there made the first sketch of that picture."  "A neat way of informing me that he was struck with her attitude and face, and asked the favor of reproduc- ing them upon canvas!" reflected the guest. "It is a masterpiece!" he said aloud. He marvelled, inwardly, at the paternal devotion or ex- travagance that had tempted the master of the unpretend- ing manse to make himself the owner of what he knew must be a costly work of art. Jessie answered as if he had spoken. -Mr. Hi   gave it to my father, who had been atten- tive to him during a severe illness." She scanned the new-comer narrowly while his regards were engaged by the painting, never dreaming that he was quite conscious of the scrutiny, and prolonged his examination purposely that she might have time and op- portunity for hers. He stood fire bravely, for his mien of easy composure did not vary by so much as the nervous twitch of a muscle; his attitude was one of serious atten- tion; his eyes did not leave the picture. A tall, lithe figure, with a willowy bend of the should- .'   JESSAMN.          23 era, slight, but perceptible, especially when he spoke, or listened to her; fair, almost sandy hair; blue eyes; a pale, and by no means handsome face, inasmuch as the forehead was narrow, the cheeks thin, the mouth?large, and the luxuriant beard had a reddish tendency in the ' mustache, and where it neared the under lip,-- each of these particulars and the tout ensemble awoke in Jessie's mind disappointment, which found vent in a little sigh and a droop of the corners of the mouth as she withdrew her eyes. Then, silence abode between them for awhile. -The music of the band had ceased, and whatever were the con-  A eluding exercises of the celebration in the church, they  a- were inaudible in the great parlor, where cool shadows %* X * ": slept in the corners, and the scent of pond-lilies and : t a jessamine steeped the air into languorous stillness. It Ad:  would- have seemed like a dream to a romantic or imagi-  :i native man, and the glory of the place and hour been the figure among the pillows on the couch, her dark. cheeks ,A stained red as with rich wine; the sultry yellow of the blos- soms in her hair and upon her bosom making more -blaCk -  her wealth of hair, more clear her olive skin, the while, , forgetful that she was not alone, she watched with parted , -- lips and eager, love-full eyes, for the coming of her lord. ' We shall have-abundant proof, hereafter, that Mr. Wyllys was the reverse of romantic, and that his imagi- - nation 'never misled his judgment, but oesthetics was a favorite study with him, and his taste being good, he de- ! cided within his calm and -...roni ing self that the hour - spent in the " best roin m" of the Dundee parsonage was  : not utterly wasted.     . He had had a study in color-and of more kinds thana - A : ita' which met the eye-if nothing else. - f:,'  - ,        *-     : i.:   ;i          .S       . t ^ , CHAPTER IL ERE they are!" : The low exclamation, fraught with delight and ill-suppressed impatience-genuine and artless as a child's-drew Mr. Wyllys to join Jessie's lookout at the window. The road and church-yard were full of the retiring crowd, and -a group of three persons was at the wicket- gate. A white-haired man, of dignified and benign pres- ence, bowed somewhat under the weight of his three- score years and ten, walked' with his arm about the shoulders' of one youthful and erect, who retarded Iris gait to suit the measured tread of his companion. "Stand back! don't let him see you until he comes in!" ordered Jessie; and- lr. Wyllys retreated without having made other observation of te Klady at Mr. irke's side, save that she was of medium height and neatly dressed.             -  Mr. Fordham's face brightened with pleasurea- ,..   JESSAX INAE.        25 amazement at sight of the figure standing at the head of Jessie's sofa. ("Orrin I you here?" "In body and in spirit, Roy!" Jessie's eyes were busy, as their hands lingered in the hearty clasp of greeting. "What a contrast!" she thought, 'twixt pity for the one and exultation in the other. The epithet most aptly descriptive of Roy Fordham's features and bearing was "manly." The broad brow; the hazel eyes, rather deeply set, that looked straight into those of the person with whom he talked; the resolute mouth and square chin; his upright carriage, stalwart frame, and firm step-all deserved it. His height did not equal that of his cousin, but he seemed taller un- til they stood side by side. Without relinquishing the visitor's hand, he turned, with serious courtesy that be- came him well, to the lady who had entered with him. "Miss Kirke, allow me to present my friend and rela- tive, Mr. Wyllys!" It was a formally worded introduction, for Miss Kirke was punctilious in these matters. She bent her head graciously, but with no effusive cordiality such as had gushed forth in her sister's welcome to one with whose name she was pleasantly familiar. "We are happy to see any friend of Mr. Ford- ham in our home," she said in a clear monotone that ac- corded perfectly with her calm face and reposeful de- meanor. "My father, Mr. Wyllys!" The back of the latter was to the lounge when Miss Kirke had committed him to the host's care, and betaken  herself to scine other part of the house; but he ki ]t4e I  -  "- S/*             ' "  ^  ,  *   26       *  JESS&ML INE. Roy was bending over his betrothed, smiling tender re- proach into eyes that filled with happy, foolish tears at his query-"Ilave you been very lonely . " "Not at all! I have enjoyed the morning intensely. I could see into the church very plainly, and hear much that was said. It was almost as good as going myself." : "I told you you would be reconciled to the disappoint- ment by noon." "But not in the way you meant!" The wilful ring was in the voice, loving as it was. Mr. Wyllys: visage was a model of blald deference, and his answers to Mr. Kirke's remarks pertinent, the while he was reflecting,--"You are likely to have lively work on your hands, my good cousin, with your Kate. I should hardly have cast the part of Petruchio for you, either." "I think I will have mine brought to me here, to- day!" he heard Jessie say, softly, when dinner was an- nounced. Roy's reply was to lift her in his armns and carry her across the hall to the dining-room, where one side of lthe table was taken up by a settee heaped with cushions. She pouted and laughed as he laid her down among these. "I believe you imagine that I am losing moral volition as well as bodily strength! I have taken my meals in this a la fairy princess style for' seven days," she- added, to Mr. Wyllys, when they were all seated--" have per- sonated Cleopatra and Mrs. Skewton to my own content and my friends' amusement. I find it so comfortable that I shall regret the recovery which will doom me to straight-backed chairs, drawn up in line of battle against   JESSAMNE.          27 the table. If you want to know the fulness and delight of the term, dolce far niente, practise clumsy climbing among our steep hills, and the fates may send you a sprained ankle--a not intolerable prelude to a month of such luxurious indolence and infinitude of spoilipg as I am now enjoying."              :     ? "The indolence and the petting might be less to his taste than they are to yours," replied her father, ildulg- ently. "Don't you believe it!" said Jessie, with a saucy flash of her great eyes across the table at the guest. "I have a notion that both would be altogether to his liking. Unless I am mistaken, he has had Benjamin's share of these luxuries already."              ' "You have been telling tales out of school, Roy!" said his cousin, threateningly, as Mr. Fordham laughed. Jessie anticipated the reply. "You are wrong-and the accusation is unflattering to my perceptive powers. You betray your ease-loving pro- pensities in every motion and accent. Don't frown at me, Euna! I am complimenting him, although he may not suspect it. Indolence-not laziness, mind! but the , graceful laisser-faire which sometimes approximates the sublime-is the least appreciated of the social arts." Mr. Wyllys answered by a quotation:  ' Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil-the shore Than labor in the deep mid-ocean.'" "The gospel of ease, of which Tennyson is the apos- tle!" said Roy. "Sleep is never sweeter than when it comes to the laboring man, nor is the shore so welcome 's  *  '  '   ,. .   28         JESSAMNE. to him who never leaves it, as it is to the mariner who has gained it by toiling through the deep mid-ocean." Jessie made a dissenting gesture. "  Jejeu-vawt-il la chandelle?" "Yes-if rest and ease be the chief goods of life," was the rejoinder. It was made gently and affectionately, but Jessie ap- pealed to Mr. Wyllys, in whimsical vexation. "Wouldn't anybody know that he is a college pro- fessor? He is a merciless logician, and logic was always a bore to me. Hdon't know the difference between a syllogism and a sequence. Poor Euna! what a fearful trial she had in her pupil " "You use the past tense, I observe!"Mr. Wyllys re- marked, demurely. Everybody was tempted to badinage in talking with her. "Because my days of nominal pupilage are over. The trial remains in.-full force."  "You may say that, my dear." Mr. Kirke laid a caressing hand upon her head. '; Your sister and I would hear the slander from no one else." Miss Kirke said nothing,--only smiled in a slow, bright way, peculiarly her own. While Jessie could not speak without action, the blood leaping to cheek and lip as did the fire to her eye and ready retort to her tongue, her sister sat, serene and fair, observant of every want of those about her, graceful in hospitality, hurried in noth- ing, careful in all she said and did. She must have been 'twenty-five years old; Wyllys decided, but she would look as young at forty, after the manner of these calm-pulsed blondes. The soft brown hair was put plainly back from   JESSAMNE.          29 her temples; her features were like her father's, Greek in outline, but more delicately chiselled; her eyes were plgcid mirrors-not changeful depths. Her dress was a dun tissue that yet looked cooler than Jessie's muslin, and her lace collar was underlaid and tied in front with blue ribbon. Mr. Wyllys had an eye-and a critically correct one-for feminine attire, down to the minutest details, anld he approved of hers as befitting her age, position, and style. He noted, moreover, with surprise and approval, that there was not a touch of rusticity in the appointments of the table and the bill of fare., Old-fashioned silver, mas- sive and shining; china that nearly equalled it in value, and cut-glass of the same date, were set out with tasteful propriety upon a damask cloth, thick, snowy, and glossy, and ironed in an arabesque pattern. From the clear soup, to the ice-cream, syllabubs, and frosted cake which were the dessert, each dish bespoke intelligent and elegant housewifery. Yet the only servant he saw was the lumpish girl who had admitted him. She re- moved and set on dishes without a blunder, decent and prim in a white cape-apron, directed, Mr. Wyllys was sure, in every movement, by the mistress' eyes, unper- turbed as these seemed. Crude brilliancy-mature repose-thus he described the general characteristics of the sisters' behavior, by the time the meal was over. Both were strong, both women of intellect and culture. One was as self-contained as the other was impulsive. He had never before-and his ac- quaintance with the various phases of American society  was extensive-met the peer of either in farm-house or country parsonage.   * 30        JESBSA rTE. "I should as soon have looked for rare orchids in a daisy-field," was his figure. The cousins went out for a walk in the afternoon, a ramble that led them by a zig-zag path, to the summit of Old Windbeam. They had climbed the hugest boulder of his knobby forehead, and sat upon it in the shadow of a low-spreading cedar, smoking the cigar of contentment, and surveying at their leisure the magnificent panolranma unrolled beneath them, when Orrin laid his hand upon his friend's knee, with a half laugh that had in it a quiver of wounded affection. "Why have you left me to find all this out for myself, old fellow? Did you doubt my sympathy, or my discre- tion?" Roy did not turn his head, but his fingers Closed strongly and lingeringly upon his cousin's. "I doubted neither. There was nothing. I could tell you until very lately. I came to Dundee, last September, to pass my vacation at the hotel in the village below. There were excellent hunting and fishing hereabouts, I had been told, and I brought letters of introduction to Mr. Kirke from Dr. Meriden and Professor Blythe, who were his college friends. Before my return to Hamilton, I asked and obtained his permission to correspond with his younger daughter, confiding to him my ulterior motive for the request. He consented and kept my secret. Our letters were such as friends might exchange, and mine were usually read\ aloud to her father and sister. When I reappeared here at the beginning of our intermediate vacation ten days ago, she received me without suspicion or embarrassment. She never knew what my real feelings toward her were until last week--   JESSAI INE.'      -   31  the day of the accident. We were walking together when she slipped and fell. In the alarm of the moment, for she nearly fainted with the pain, and I thought the hurt far more serious than it afterward proved to be, I spoke' words that could not be-misunderstood nor recalled. Not that I would recall thenm! They secured for me the great blessing of my life." Iis voice changed here. Up to this sentence the story was a quiet recitative he might have learned by rote, and uttered at the bidding of one he felt had a right to hear it. The lack of spontaneity did not offend the auditor. He appreciated his Cousin's richer and fuller nature suf- 1 0 ficiently to understand that the most abundant springs of affection and passion lay too far below the surface to be easily forced into view. He saw, too, that the confession of his wooing and winning was made with pain; that the spirit to whose exceeding delicacy of text- ure and sentiment few did justice, shrank from the rev- elation, even to his nearest of kin. He doubted not that when the " alarm "of which- Roy had spoken, cleft the sealed stone, the hidden waters leaped to the light with power that swept reserve, humility and expediency before them; that Jessie had listened to pleadings more fervent, to vows more solemn than are poured into the ear of one in ten thousand of her sex. "Does she recognize this truth a? he speculated within himself. "Or does she-the petted darling of an old man and an only'sister--receive all this as the tribute due her charms . account her flippant talk, flashing eyes, and schoolgirlish arts an equitable exchange for this man's whole being and life ."  His tact was marvellous to womanliness. His tone   32         JTESSARIAE. took its key from that which last met lhis ear;--was slightly tremulous-purposely subdued. "Thank you for allowing me to shaire in your new happiness! I need not tell you how heartily I congratru- late you-how fervent is. my wish that your wedded life may be all sunshine. I believe the lady of .your choice to be worthy of your regard. I am sure she will have the best husband in the land." Roy griped his hand hard. "You are kind to say it. It is a step I might well tremble to take--this asking a young girl who has lived ; in an atmosphere of love and indulgence, and known care only by hearsay, to share my toils, to divide with me the burden of whatever sorrow Providence may send me in discipline or judgment; to endure ,my caprices, be patient with my faults-be loving through and above all." Orrin held down his headt to hide a smile. "I am continually reminded when the theme of our discourse is 'dear, delightful womlan,' of what Willis says of his chum in his 'Slingsby Papers': 'It is sel- dom one meets with a spark of genuine chivalric fire nowadays. Job lit his daily pipe with it.' If another lover were to talk to me as you do, I should accuse him of rank affectation. I believe you feel all you say. liss Kirke should be a proud and happy woman." "She cannot abide that title," said Roy, smiling. "And, indeed, it suits her as ill as it sits well upon Eu- nice." "Is that the elder sister? I thought she-was 'Una.' That would be a fitting name for the chaste beauty. I glanced down, involuntarily, for the tamed lion couch- ant beneath her chair, when Miss Jessie spoJoe it."   JESSAMNE.          33 "She is 'Eunice' to everybody else. They had not tle samne mother, and there is a difference of ten years in their ages. The first Mrs. Kirke was, I judge, a se- date pastoress who looked well after her household and her husband's flock. Her praise is still in the chirches of this region. She, died when the little Eunice was at the age of five. Four years afterward,* Mr. Kirke brought to the manse a beautiful woman-city born and bred, re- fined, accomplished, and delicate. She fell into ill-health very soon. Bland as this climate seems to us who live so much further North, it was harsh to her. She was a South Carolinian, and her fondness for her old home grew into longing during her residence among these molntains. Her invalidism became confirmed after the birth of her babe. In memory of the sunny bowers in which her girlhood had been passed, she gave it the fan- ciful-you mnay think fantastic-name of Jessamine." "It is odd, but pretty, and it suits her."  "Her fondness for the vine and fashion of wearing the flower may appear to you and -to others a girlish whim. In reality, they are the motherless child's tribute to the memory of the parent whom she recollects with- fondest devotion, although she was but five years old at her death."' "She told me she had known no home but this valley. The sisters were not educated in the country, I take it?" "The elder graduated with distinction at Bethlehem. It was her mother's dying, request that she should, at a sutitable age, be sent to the Moravian Seminary at that place. She was thorough and conscientious in her stud- ies, as in everything else, cultivating her talents for music and modern languages with especial diligence that, ' \ '    '   '   34        JESSAMNE. as she has told me, 'it might not be necessary to. send little Jessie from home to schllool.' The younger sister has had no teachers except Eunice and their father, who is a finelclassical scholar."  "And a man of far more than ordinary ability, I should suppose. Why has he buried himself alive in this out-of-the-world region?" "Because he is essentially unworldly, I imagine. FIe has here ample opportunity for study, and- he loves ]his books next to his children. Theh, his attachment to the parsonage and to his people is strong. 'I was ambitious of distinction in my profession, once,' he said to me the other day, 'but that was before .my wife's death.' It may sound like exaggerated sentiment, but I believe he ,means to live and die in sight of her grave. I have learned from Eunice something about his love for her, and his grief at her death. "I have given you this sketch of the family history that you may better comprehend what passes in the household. My lodgings are at the hotel, as are yours, but, most of our time will, of course, be spent at the Par- sonage. I want you to know and like them all-particu- larly Jessie. It may be that you can be of service to her while I am abroad." "What does she say to that scheme 2'" "I have said nothing to her about it. I dread the task!"   Roy looked very grave. "Her father agrees with me that it is wiser to be silent on the subject until, my plans are definitely laid. I would prolong the clear shining of her day while I can." He arose, apparently anxious to dismiss the subject. "We must go!   Eunice's tea-table is ready at sunset."   I JESSAf;E.         35 "He cannot trust himself to discuss this matter of their separation," said Orrin, inly, following the rapid stride of his thoughtful cousil down, the mountain. 'One tear from his pert Amaryllis would reverse his de- cision at this, the eleventh hour. ' Lord! what fools these lovers be 1'"  The manse meadows were gained by a rustic foot- bridge spanning the creek which; skirted these. Two young men, wholn Mr. Wyllys rightly supposed to be members of the "Committee- upon Orator of the Day," were waiting here to speak to Mr. Fordham, probably to solicit a copy of his address for publication, the consider- ate kinsman  further surmised, and sauntered on to the garden, leaving the other to follow when he would,. Lin- gering among the fragrant borders, momentarily expect- ing Roy to rejoin him, he lost himself in a rose labyrinth,. so affluent of bloom and odor, that he did not know where he was until warned of his proximity to the oriel- window by Jessie's voice. Through a crevice in the creepers, he could see her lounge set in the spacious re- cess, and the back of her head as she raised it to speak tp^ some one within the room. 'Roy described him as distingub and fascinating!" she said, in an accent of chagrin. "I call him positively homely! - Don't you?."  Orrin should have moved-assured as he was that he was the subject of unflattering remark. - In his code, this was a reason why he should remain acquiescent and hearken for more.  Perhaps others who make higher pretensions to the minor moralities would have done like wise. "He is not handsome, certainly," returned Miss Kirke.    36  ^JERSSAZX]E. "You are disposed to be unreasonable because your e- pectrations were unduly raised." "By his cousin whlo told me he was the most popular man in Hamilton ore of the glass-offashion and mould- of-form kind, you kTI1ow,' continued Jessie, in increasing vexation. "Am I to be blamed if I lose at least the out- posts odf my temper when, having expected an Adonis, I behold-" -. "A gentleman!"Her sister finished the sentence "Since he is that, dear, and Mr: Fordham's cousin, he should be safe from our criticism. At least, while he is our guest." There was a pause before Jessie spokEe again. Darling Euna! are you displeased with me " she said coaxingly. "I was cross and unlady]ike, I acknow^ edge. I ought not to-I did not expect that he would be Boyds equal in appearance or manner, but I am grievously disappointed."  "Not to be outdone in generous candor, I own that I am, also," was the reply.       . ,  The elder sister approached the window as she said it; and Mr. Wyllys effected a skilful retreat. The labyrinth had its terminus in a mnated arbor near the church-yard fence. Sitting down in this, the subject of the recent discussion indulged himself in a hearty but noiseless fit of laughter.  --  !-! CHAPT'Eli III. RRIN W YLYS   could afford to laugh at criticism that would have provoked a thin-skinned, or moder- ately-vain man to anger, if not to hatred. For he was aware that his cousin had spoken the bare truth when he represented him as the admired Crichton of the town which was their home. His features and form were as I have portrayed them. He had neither beauty nor absolute symmetlry to recommend these. He was not wealthy, nor yet eminent in his profession. A lawyer in fair practice, gained principally by the exercise of other  gifts than legal acumen, he was yet a person of mark in the community. The reason assigned for this would have been the same, in effect, by every acquaintance, whether the witness were the fine lady of ton who made sure of him before is uing her cards for the grand ball of the season, or,the Milesian who "stepped intil his Honors office to ask him could I take the law of Teddy O'Rourklie  for this black eye, or is it himself that will be afther i taking the law of me for the two I've give him " ' -  H      ,  , ,   Bs  *   JESSAI H ,' "^Not ret1ular I handsome, I admit, my deal;" lrss. BeaP u Xonde would say. "But there is somlething mole vpotent, as more subtle inll influence in his preselnce and speech. Do you know I thinl a fascinating hoimely man the' most charming creature in the- world? An d Mr. tVyllys' deportment, tolle, and conversation are unsrtl- passable. Other men may be as well-bred, but there is a nameless Something about his manner that is exquisite and irresistible." 'While Murphy would expatiate by the hour upon the satisfaction a man experienced in daleinog wid a pairflect gintlemnan, and it was Misther Wyllys had tLe beautifu way wid lhirn!" That he danced elegantly, sang explessively, and was a pleasing pianist; that le was conversant with the current literature of the day; that the stelreotyped cant klown as art criticism " fell from his tongue aptly,and as if no one else had ever used the same plirases in his andi- tor's hearing,-undoibtedl y contributed largely to his popularity; but these accomnplishments were secondary im power to the nameless Something lauded by Mis.

His own sex recognized the chlarm more will-- ingly than they are, wont to acklnowledge the claims to favoritism  of one who is the woman's darling of lhis set The graceful 'nsouc'ance that arltfthy concealed his coln- scionsness of the degree long ago awarded hitn, as "Pet of the Petticoats;" his gay good-hlmor, his fllnd of anecdote and repartee, made him as welcome at bachelors wine anddininer-parties as in mixed companies.

After all, however, his brightest bays were gained in his character as carpet knight. Trained coquettes and professional flirts, flushed by a long course of victories, had put confident lances in rest and run vain-glorious tilts with him. Hie was always ready to accept the challenge; ready to become, for a few days, or, in ex- ceptionally touLgh cases, a few weeks, the apparent captive of the ambitious belle. The approach of proud humility than which nothing could have been more opposed to servility of spirit or demeanor; the gradual, and finally rapt absorption of his every faculty and sentiment into' his unspoken  adoration of hers whose chains ile wore; the delicate appreciation of each shade of feeling and thotght, and prescience of each desire;-above and be- neath all, his singular faculty of adaptation to the various phases- f character set for his reading,-could hardly fail, first, to disarm, then to flatter, finally to captivate. Up to this period of his career, when he had entered his nine-and-twentieth year, nobody said openly of him that his business in life was to win hearts for the pleasure of breaking them. If he had broken any, his victims made no moan. In the cases of the veteran coquettes alluded to just now, sympathy would have been thrown away. There were stealthy whispers to the- effect, how- ever, that others, less wary, had been drawn into his snare ;  had dreamed of love, and, awakening to anguished perception of their folly, had shrouded bleeding hearts in    n40         JESSAMNE. robes of pride or Christian resignation, and lived on out- wardly as little changed by the experience as was he. It is superfluous to remark that these cautious rumors lent lustre to his fame instead of tarnishing it;- that dozens of intrepid damsels were wrought by the hearing into a Curtius-like spirit of self-immolation; -panted to leap, bedecked in their bravest array, into the gulf which yawned to destroy the safety and peace of mind of the whole sisterhood of marriageable women in the classic town of Hamilton. -The envious, nor the prudish, stig- matized him as a lady-killer. The coarse term would be an insult to his refinement, his notable honor, and equally notable kindness of heart. He was, beyond question, the most charming of men, a social diamond of the first water, although the obtuse daughters of the Dundee manse had not at once discovered it. , What wonder that he, sitting among the roses in the arbor, found infinite diversion in the recollection that he was pronounced by Jessie " positively homely "-utterly unattractive beside her handsome lover, and that her more discreet sister had mildly echoed her disappoint- ment? He enjoyed the novelty of the incident and the laugh it gave him-was sincere in the half-spoken regret- "What a pity I can-ot publish this verdict and the man- ner of its delivery, in Hamlilton." With that, he pulled down a branch of musk roses nod- ding above his head; broke it, tore off the petals until he had a double handful, and buried his face in the odorous mass. Roy came up with him as the sound of low, sweet singing moved the stillness of the garden and the sunset into music. The songstress was Jessie, lying within her o    ;            JESSAMNE.      -      41 oriel-window alone, and gazing at the amber ocean bil- lowing above the purple hills at the outlet of the valley. Her rich contralto voice was like the colored light and the musk roses, Orrin thought, in no wise tempted to dis- like or underrate her because she did not value him aright. That mistake would rectify itself, by and by. ! He- could stay a fortnight in Dundee as well as not. Roy had pressed him to do so, and he began to think he would.  This was what Jessie sang, never dreaming of the audi- ence, fit, but few, hidden in the blossoming thicket: "Sleeping, I dreamed, Love--dreamed, Love, of thee; O'er the bright wav*, Love, floating were we. Light in thy fair hair played the soft wind, Gently thy white arms round me were twined; And as thy song, Love, swelled o'er the sea, Fondly thy blue eyes beamed, Love, on me." Neither of the cousins stirred until the song was fin- ished, when a robin in the nearest elm began his vespers. "This is Arcadia!"  said Orrin, ravishing another spray-great white roses this time, with creamy hearts. "It is home /" replied the other, softly. Orrin appeared not to hear him. "Or the Vale of Cashmere!" he went on, drawing in long breaths of perfume. "Here are "' Timid jasmine buds that keep Their odors to themselves 'all day, But when the Eunlight dies away  Let the delicious secret out-' roses of Kathay and bulbuls-and Nouimahal 1"   42     :    JESSAMNE. Roy looked at him over his shoulder. "'If you have pulled enough of Eunice's rare, early roses to pieces to satisfy your destructive proclivities, we will go in," he said, pleasantly. Something in his friend's eve and tone disinclined himn l : to pursue the theme. He could not suspect him of an ,intention to ridicule Jessie or her 1home, but he felt the absence of sympathy with his own mood. "Are they' hers?'  asked the other, brushing the wasted leaves in an unheeded shower to the floor. Roy paid no regard to the emphasis. He was strangely averse to talking about Jessie at that moment. "They are," he said, leading the way to the house, Orrin treading on the scattered flakes of fragrance, to gain the "door of the bower. "She is an able florist. There is not anothier garden like hers for many miles around." No one excepting Jessie observed that Mr. Wyllys did not accost her of his own accord while they were at tea, which was set out upon a small table near the large win- dow in the parlor. She, used to petting, and what might have been considered by an impartial judge more than her share of general attention, and a trifle nervous withhal, in her desire to produce an agreeable impression upon Roy's kinsman, did remark it, and was conscience- smitten by: the fear lest her chagrin at beholding a man so unlike her pre-conceived ideal had been reflected in her nmanner. She seized an opportunity, therefore, when  Roy rolled the table to its accustomed place -in the middle of the apartment, to court Orrin's notice. "So you ascended our Mont :Blanc this afternoon?." she said, smiling engagingly. "I amtist retract my saucy innuendoes touching your fondness for ease." ,:.:e,        h   (   H  "*          J ESEAMNE. -J      . ' tHe was quite near her, but he must have been inatten- tive, for he turned his face to her, with--- Pardon me! I did not catch your observation!" (  "It was nothing so dignified as an observation-" she retorted, coloring and laughing. "If I were to repeat it, you would be reminded of the poor girl whose con- plaint-' The soup is hot,' uttered confidentially to a deaf old lady who chanced to- sit next her at a dinner- party, was the signal for the solemn production of an ear-trumpet, and the remark-audible to all present-- 'A very profound and interesting observation, I doubt not, my dear! Will you oblige me by repeating it ' ." Mr. Wyllys laughed in well-bred moderation that, somehow, nade Jessie feel that her little story was not very amusing, and had been tamely told. "I submithto the consequences of my deafness, rather than annoy you by the ear-trumpet," 'was his answer. Bowing, in quitting hler, lie followed Mr. Kirke to anotlher window. "We were speaking of Ruskin's Stones of Veni l to-day," Jessie heard himi begin.       ' She had read the book, and would have ei   -ed- listening to their discussion of it, as did Eunice, to whom Mr. Wyllys appealed at her reentrance, setting a chair foruher by lher fathers, and establishing himself in front -  of them.  Roy apparently did not object to this arrangement, for he drew a stool to the sofa, and talked to Jessie, aside, of things that, would have interested her beyond all other subjects, but for the sight of that group in the moonlight that now flooded the room. It kept astir the uneasy sensation produced by Mr. Wyllys' marked avoidance    "         JESSAMNE. of her at tea-time. While her hand- lay within her loverls, and her ear drank in all he said, and her heart bea't, fast and warm, as he only could make it pulsate, she was ashamed to catch herself watching the slender figure, bending easily forward, his elbow upon the table at his side, his chin upon his hand, now in an attitude of respectful attention, while her father or Eunice spoke, again talking earnestly-she was sure, eloquently also,- in the low, cleverly modulated accents of which he was the consummate master. Did he then regard her as a feather-brained rattle? a forward school girl, of whose prattle he was already weary, and whom he adjudged incapable of entering into, or appreciating, intellectual conversation  "Oh dear!" escaped her, when she reached this point. Roy looked amazed-almost aghast-as well he might. He was in the middle of a description of their future home, prefatory of a hint he' deemed it\ best to drop relative to apetition he had laid before the trustees of the college in which he was professor. This had asked a year's leave of absence, that he might pursue the study. of the German language and literature abroad with one or two other branches of his profession. Orrin Wyllys had brought him letters of approbation from the body named, and the time had come when he must feel his way gently to the announcement of the approaching sep- aration. "My darling I he said. "What is it? Are you in pain . " "Yes! Not my foot!" seeing him look at it. "I have a desperate heartache! I shall never be good and   X  r         JESS AMTN.         45  wise enough for you, Roy! And you will discover this for yourself, one day." "That is the only really foolish thing I have ever heard you say!" returned he, in fond raillery. * "I am tormented, without intermission, by the conviction that I am unworthy of your regard, so we will let the one fear neutralize the other. Love is a powerful solvent, dear. It will melt these stubborn doubts-these flint- stones of fancied incompatibility,that fret your heart when you meditate upon the chances that we shall make one another happy." "But if I were sedate and discreet; cautious as to what I say, and to whom I say it,--more learned and beautiful-more like the blessed old Euna over" there. You see"-in real mortification--"I cannot express the wish to reform without falling into my nonsensical tricks of speech!" Roy could not preserve his gravity. I am not laughing at you!" he whispered, as she flung her arm over her eyes. "What has moved you to this sensitiveness-and with me? I could but liken my sentiments in the imaginary survey of the pattern bride you would igive me to those of Jacob, who was put off with the demure Leah, when he had bargained for witch- ing wicked Rachel."        / "The comparison is an insult to Euna!" interrupted Jessie warmly.  I -said yon ought to marry a woman like her-pure as a pearl, true as steel-in principle like adamant. Leah! Bah! I always detested her! She was a sly, heartless traitor-a smooth-tonguled hypo- crite, who cozened the pretty young sister whom she envied-becoming, as she did, a willing party to her    "         JESSAMNE. father's fraud. She deserved all the unhappiness she got!" "We shall not differ there. The c tender-eyed Jewess is no favorite of mine. But, even supposing that I were to sacrifice inclination to a sense of what you consider the fitness of things, Eunice or one like her would never elect to marry me. It is dissimilarity in certain charac- teristics that provides the best sauce-for courtship. Your sister; for instance, would be well-mated with a man like Mr. Wyllys, the salient points of whose character are those which she has not." "In other words, you tlink the interests of the drama 'demand that I should do the light comedy as a counter- poise to your heavy tragedy?" said Jessie, appeased. "I am sure I coifld never like your cousin-or one like him--well enoulgh to think of Inarrying him."' "I don't ask you to do it!" rejoined Roy, playfully. "But do-not, on that account, shut your .eyes to his real excellence. He is to be your brother, renember-for I have no other. His father was my guardian, and while he lived, I scarcely felt the early loss of my parents. :To Orrin personally, I owe much. He is four yeais my senior, and when we were at school, he fought many a battle in my behalf with boys bigger than eithelk of us. Then, we were separated for seven years, seeiaig one another only in vacations and casual furloughi"t'om business. He is one of the trustees of our collegend, although he will not admit it, I am persuaded that I am indebted to his influence, seconded as it was by my dear old friend, Dr. Baxter's advocacy of my cause,-for my Professorship. You will like and esteem him when you come to know him. I hope you two will be great {  * -   friends in time. As a preliminary to your better under- standing, and consequently your admiration for him--I am going to ask him for some music." Orrin obeyed the call, but not with alacrity. He seemed altogether content with his location and his com- panions.  "Please do not order lights!" he said to Eunice who arose with him. "No illumination can be preferable to the mountain moonlight. It is radiance clarified to purity." It revealed to him, from his seat upon the music-stool, a picture he was artist enough to enjoy. Jessie's white dress and pillows were flecked by the irregular tracery of vine-shadows, but, through an opening in the leafy lattice, the moon poured a stream of light upon her face and bust, revealing even the gleam of the betrothal ring upon the hand supporting her cheek. Roy had opened the piano, and now stood at her feet in the shade, leaning against the wall-a dark, motionless sentinel, with folded arms and bowed head, listening to the music, or watchlful of her. The player essayed no scientific surprises; no juggling. complication of fingers and keys. He began with a moonlight sonata, the original theme of which mnight have been rung by fairy hands upon the jessamine bells, " giv- ing their delicious secrets out" under the weight of sum- mer dew. From this he strayed into the "Midsummer Night's Dream,"-thence to the most beautiful of the musical paradoxes, "Songs Without Words,' and there rested.  "More, please!" entreated Jessie, in dreamy delight. Both hands were folded under her cheek now, and she had not moved since he finished the fairy sonata.     48         JESSA MTNE R "This is Elysium!" she added, softly. "But sing, Orrin-won't you?." asked Roy. So long as-his cousin's music brought his darling more pleasure than did conversation with himself, the gener- ous fellow would, contribute in this way to her gratifica- tion. "You wouldn't have wondered at or blamed me, if you had ever heard him sing," said a broken-hearted wife to me once, in reviewing the ciircumstances of her early acquaintance with the man who had married, neglected, brutally ill-used, and finally deserted her. He was bully, ruffian, liar, cheat, and drunkard, but he sang like an angel, giving to words and music a depth and delicacy of expression that sounded to the listeners like heavenly in- spiration. With the visage of a Caliban and the appe- tites of a satyr, he yet moved others to smiles, tears, high and holy aspirations, to solemn or wild enthusiasm, re- ligious or patriotic. His musical genius was the talis- man by which he made himself popular, courted, envied, passionately beloved. Orrin Wyllys' voice, his exquisite taste in and knowledge of music would have won him social distinction had he been awkward in carriage, boor- ish in manner, and an ignoramus. There was not another amateur performer in his circle who could ever hope to equal him in effective and scientific execution. In the keeping of some-of many-the gift would' have been a joy and a beneficence. He had none more dangerous- and he knew it, lightly as he affected to esteem it. If his first selection on this occasion harmonized less perfectly with the hush and chastened lustre of the even- ing than his unsyllabled melodies had done, he was ex- cusable since it developed the best tones of his voice. It   JESSAMNE.          49 was Mrs. Norton's sea lyric-- "The Outward Bound." His auditors felt the rush of the favoring wind that had sprung up at dawn; heard the flap of the. sails as they filled, and the creak of the line that strained at the anchor; saw the knot of parting friends; the close, tight hand- clasp, that helped force back the tears from eyes that would fain smile farewell. It is a fine old" song," said Mr. Kirke. "I heard it many years ago. I thank you, Mr. Wyllys, for reviving the memory." "This generation has nothing that can compare worthily -  with the'music of other days," replied Orrin's voice from J, his shaded corner. "The true lover of the art must turn i  from thepotpourri of the modern opera, the unflavored whey of fashionable ballads, with the craving of him who, having tasted the mellow wine, refuses the new- for he saith, ' the old is better."'  Jessie moved like duone awaking from a trance--spoke with feigned lightness. "' To weep is a woman's part!' I don't like that line of your song, Mr. Wyllys. If your 'Outward Bound' had admitted mothers, sisters, and wives to the parting banquet, they would have borne themselves as bravely as did their masculine comrades, and without the aid of the 'sparkling brimmer,' which is, I suppose, the poetical name for a potion known, hereabouts, as 'moulntain dew' or ' Dutch courage.' But if poets of the stronger sex are to be believed, Niobe was the prototype woman." ' Your quarrel is with one of your own sex, Miss Jes- sie; not with me or mine," was the cool rejoinder. "Mrs. Norton wrote the offensive line." "There is something very like it in Kingsley's ' Three    50         JESSAMNE. Fishers,'" said Roy, to cover Jessie's trifling discomfit- ure. '"Let us haIve that next." Mr. Wyllys sang it, giving to the refrain a weary sad- ness, exceeding pathos. Hie knew how effective this was h]len he saw Jessie's hand steal up to her eyes. She did not plead for " more," or cavil at "Men must work and women must weep," when he left the instrument, and went back to the window where Eunice was sitting. "If you and your father are not afraid of the dew, I should like to see the mountains in this light," he said, persuasively. "Dare you walk for a little while upon the porch?" The three went out together. - Don't stay here, Roy!" begged Jessie. "The view must be fine to-night. It is not fair that you should be tied to my side all the time. I feel as if I were defraud- ing your cousin of his share of your society."' "You must continue to upbraid yourself with the theft, then," answered Roy, reseating himself upon the otto- man, and drawing her head to his shoulder, "Or, rather, my pet, you must cease to imagine that I could prefer any society to yours, any scene to the delightful seclusion of this, our betrothal nook. Orrin knows all. He has fine tact, and comprehends how precious to me is every hour passed with you." This was a plausible solution of the reserve which puz- zled and pained her. Jessie tried to receive it, in full Ifaith, and forgot to watch the forms strolling back and forth before the two windows which opened upon the piazza. When the party broke up for the night, she ex- tended her hand to Orrin in cousinly freedom. A v "I mean to make Mty trial effort at sittifg up:tht   g   .    JESAMNE.      .5 morrow," she said, blithely. "And we will have some music. Euna doesn't sing, but she will play our accom- paniments, since Mr. Fordham disdains the piano." "I threw a number of instrumental duets into my trunk yesterday," said Orrin- to Miss Kirke. "I did not then know why I did it. I understand now thlat I had ' some intuition of coming enjoyment. I]'y I bring them up to-morrow?" Jessie had never been jealous of Eunice in ler life. Her disposition was as generous as it was impetuous. She did not care, she said to herself, in reviewing the evening that sent her to her pillow tired but sleepless, that Mr. Wyllys had openly preferred her sister's com- panionship to hers; that he had scarcely noticed her proposal about the music in his desire to play with Eu- nice. But she was conscious of a discordant jar in mem- ories that would else have been all brightness, whenever slie reverted to ler repeated efforts to scale the barriers of tlhe strangerhood: that ought not to hlave existed between them for a moment after lie heard Roy's story-and the adroit rebuffs that had met each of these. Eunice had helped- ller undress and seen her comfort- ably laid in bed, kissed her affectionately, and prom- ised to be with her early in the morning.  By the time the door was shut, Jessie had propped her llead upon her crossed arms, and lay with   wide- open eyes gazing through the unshuttered windows at the broad straight brow of Windbeam, black and majestic in the mountain moonlight; listening to the stealthy whispers of the vine-leaves about the casement, and living over the events of the day-an exciting one in her quiet life. Her thoughts of Roy were all of pride-  52         JESSAMNE. ful joy. Her heart was very tender, very quiet in the glad hiumility that possessed her as she pondered upQn the fact that he had chosen ]ler-an undisciplined, -un- sophisticated country girl, to share the career she iwas sure ;would be noble and distinguished. Something more than usually fond in Eunice's silent caress at parting from her for the night, brought up a host of reminiscences of the motherly love with whch this sister had guarded and nurtured her--tle youngling of the household. Such a bright, sweet day her existence had been! In all her sky there was not a cloud, save this light vapor of discontent with herself that the introduction to Roy's relative--tle first- of his old friends whomn she had ever met-should have been so unsatisfactory  "Hiis reserve actually increased as the hours went on1, she reflected. "His manner was more free and cordial while I was telling lim the story of old DaNvie Dundee than after Roy had explained to him what we are to one another. Perhaps he thinks an engaged young lady should be demure and dutiful, having no eyes or ears for any one except her betrothed, Perhaps it is as Roy says, and he fears to intrude upon our tete--tetes. I must con- vince him that we are not so, selfish. -Roy declares that his cousin approves heartily of our engagement-that lie said many pleasant things of me, else I should fear that he had taken a dislike to me, from the beginning, that he thought Professor Fordham might and ought to have done better. I must make him like him for myself-not merely because I am his kinsman's choice." From which soliloquy the reader will perceive that Mr. Wyllys had led off with a winning card.   CHAPTER IV I AN WEEK had passed since the Dundee Centennial, and life in the parsonage-had been in outward as- pect like the weather--still and sunny. The old- est Dundeeian had never known before so early and genial a season. Eunice's roses were in lux uriant bloom; the clover-meadowss were pink and fra grant; the forests had burst into full leafage; the straw berries upon the southern terrace of the kitchen-garden were swelling globes, white on the nether, scarlet upon the upper sides. The ways of the household, always simple and method- ical, were not otherwise now. Roy spent a couple of hours each forenoon with his betrothed. Orrin rarely made his appearance until two or three hours after din- ner when the cousins came up from the hotel together, and did not return to their lodgings before ten o'clock at nighlt. Mr.-Kirke had daily interviews with Mr- Wyllys in the course of the walks and drives they took in corn-   54:         JJESSAMNE. pany, and brought home accounts of his suavity, wit, and varied information, which were endorsed by Eunice, which Jessie heard with growing bewilderment at the chance or purpose that withheld her from participation in what was freely enjoyed- by her father and sister. Even their music practice had not melted the ice that lay, an impas- sive mass, just beneath the surface of his deportment whenever he approached or addressed her. Her liveliest sallies and most friendly overtures, met with a response, ready and civil, indeed, but so unlike the gentle courtesy, the kindliness and graceful deference of his behavior' to Eunice that (nothing but a spirit determined and unsuspi- cious of evil as was our heroine's could have kept her to her resolve to wiln his friendship. Roy found her very charming under the light-veil of perisiveness -this secret solicitude cast over her. She never intimated to him that his kinsrnanl had not met her expectation in every respect. She was thallkful, instead, that her betrothed did not see for himself that all was not right between them. Some day, when the frost was quite dispelled, they would laugh over it together-over her fears, her innocent stratagems for the accomplishment of her object, Orrin's stateliness, and Roy's blindness to her perturbation. She had patience and hope. She would await the vanishment of the mist, passing content, meanwhile, with the heart-riches that were hers beyond per- adventure. She had not heard of the German University scheme. It was unlike Roy Fordham to hang back fromn Inaking a revelation which must come in the end, which delays could not soften, and which could cause no more distress now than if it weire withheld until the close of his vacation. His judgment said that Jessie would             Jt/-&iOO-atA'.Y.2ll .  OA better endure the prospect of the separation while he was with lier, to lead her thoughts to the great and man- ifest advantages that would accrue to him from the year of foreign study, and-overleaping the gulf of absence- to paint the delight of re-union. Mr. Kirke represented that Jessie was a girl of sense and strengthi; that she would be better pleased to be confided in, and consulted as his future wife, than be blinded and petted as a clild; and Roy, acquiescing in this opinion, still put off the evil hour. Was it loving consideration for her-or presentiment-that struck him with dumbness? The-lovers sat on the piazza, one afternoon, just after the sunset repast. Jessie's -" trial effort" had been made with ease that augured rapid recovery, but she was for- bidden to walk without assistance, or to bear her whole weight upon the injured foot. "While I feel strong enough to run a race with you down to the mill," she said, pointing to a venerable build- . ing, a quarter of a mile distant. "You can form no idea of the perversity of the restless thing that used to be a , manageable member, when I had leave to walk, or sit still as I liked. I have a terrific attack of the fidgets!" "Penalty of insubordination--a return to the lounge and oriel-window!" smiled Roy, in warning. "That would be no punishment at all! When I am strong and active again I mean often to play helpless, upon that dear old lounge, to lie within the window and dream. I love it!" Her voice sank in an intonation of ineffable tenderness that went to Roy's heart in a pang, not a thrill. This evening he meant to tell her that for many months she must sit alone in what he had named their "betrothal-   56         JESSAMNE. nook;" that the year they had agreed upon as the period of their engagement must be passed apart, the one from the other. He had made up his mind to another thing. If she asked the sacrifice at his hands, he would abandon the cherished hope of years, the fruition of which seemed now so near. and she should never guess the extent of his self-denial. She was so dear to him! this incarnation of frolic, passion, and of fancies -gay, graceful, as whim- sical as various-but all beautiful to him; she, whose eyes deepened and softened and glowed with the tender cadence of those three words--"I love it!"He had never succeeded in telling Orrin why he loved her. His spoken analysis of her character was cold and imperfect. Had Orrin uttered aloud his unflattering, ' pert Amaryllis,"' Roy would have resented the epithet warmly, yet ac- knowledged, secretly, that his own portrait of her was hardly more like the reality. He could not describe her trait by trait, feature by feature. But for himself, lie knew that she was the embodied glory of his life; that every ray that kept his heart warm and brlight with a very summer of gladness, could be traced to hler,--her love, and the influence the consciousness of this had upon his thoughts of the present, and dreams of days to come. "The oriel is enchanted ground to me. We will build one like it, in our own home, and cover it with jessamine and wisteria," he said, noting, with loving amusement, the crimson flush that always bathed her face at direct allu- sions to their marriage. "Orrin shall sketch it for me. He is a universal genius, and his taste is marvellous. His bachelor apartments are a notable exception to any others I ever saw. They are furnished aclmost as well, kept almost as neatly, as if he were married."   "Isn't he a bit of a Sybarite?" queried Jessie, ab- rnptly. "If he has a fault-or, no! you wouldn't own that he has--but, isn't his foible a love of luxury-of comfort, if you prefer to call it so-bodily and mental2 " "He is certainly not indolent. I know no other man who will work more persistently, although quietly, to gain a coveted end. And if he loves the ease of the flesh, why so do we all-don't wet   His philosophy teaches that it is folly for one to be miserable, when he can as readily be happy and comfortable. His has been a pros- perous life, thus far. He has known little of sorrow or trial. Should these come, they will ripen, not sour him, for the original material is good. I amn the more anxious that you should know and appreciate him because-" The gate swung open to, admit a visitor-a farmer's lad, in whose 'attempts at self-education the young pro- fessor took a lively interest. "I found this in the field on the other side of the mountain, to-day," he said, laying a piece of stone in Mr. Fordham's hand. "I think there's ore in it." Roy inspected it closely. "Miss Jessie "-he gave her no more familiar address in the hearing of common acquaintances--" is your father in his study ." "I believe so," she replied, eyeing the intruder less amia4ly than her lover had done, in the anticipation of the prolonged interruption. "Mr. Kirke has an acid that will test this in a few min- utes," continued Fordham to the boy. "Will you excuse me for a little while " turning to Jessie with a smile loving for herself, and entreating her forbearance for his protege. 2 orge.:a   58         JESSAMNE. Her ill-humor vanished instantly under the benignant ray. "Certainly'!" she replied, nodding cordially to the bashful lad. "He is the noblest man GOD ever made!" she said aloud, when she was alone. She leaned back in her easy chair, her hands folded in blissful contentment, enjoying the breeze from the moun- tains, the sunset clouds, the incense from the flower- garden, and the hum of the mill-wheel, mentally recapit- ulating her hero's perfections, until her heart ached with happy sighs, and she saw the landscape through an irides- cent haze. "I am a baby!" was her indignant ejaculation, as she cleared her eyes with an impatient brush of her hand. "I grow more ridiculous every day " As a means of growing wiser, she' fell to watching her sister and Orrin Wyllys, who were busy tying utp wan- dering rose-bushes in Eunice's pet labyrinth. YMr. Wyllys had his back to Jessie, when she first observed them. He was fastening back a branch which Miss Kirke held in its place, and their hands were very close together. It may have been this circumstance, it may have been the heat of the davy, or the reflection of a bunch of pink moss-roses overhead-it could hardly have been anything which her companion was saying -wlich brought the delicate roseate flush to the face usually pale and calm. His attitude was far too dignified and respectful to hint the possibility of gallant badinage on his part. Bona'-fde love-making was, of course, out of the question, since they had not known each other ten days. "Euna is handsome!" mused her sister in complacent affection. What a high-bred face and bearing she has I   JESSA VINE.         59 Slie looks the lady in her morning-gowns of print and dinity; but that lawn with the forget-me-not sprig be- comrea her rarely. I am glad I insisted upon her putting it on. But she wouldn't let me fasten the lilies-of-the- valley in her hair! Her only fault is a tendency to prim- ness. She and 1Mr. Wyllys get on admirably together. He evidently admires her, and it is a treat to her to have tile society of a cultivated gentleman. I know," smiling and blushing anew, " it is a salvo to my conscience to see them satisfied with each other's company, needing Roy and myself as little as we need them. I should else blame myself for our seeming selfishness." Rambling on discursively, she struck upon an idea, too fraught with delightsome mischief not to urge her to im- mediate action. Eunice had turned her head away, and Orrin was concealed by a tall shrub. The grassy alley leading from the porch to where they were .standing would not give back the sound of footsteps. -How fright- ened and amazed the careful elder sister would be, if she were to steal down the walk and present herself before her! How solemnly Orrin would look on while she sub- mitted to be lectured for her imprudence, and how she, in the end would triulmph over her custodians, Roy in- cluded (who, by the way, was staying away an unconscion- able time), when she should demonstrate that she knew better than they what she could dot and bear; that she was none the worse for the escapade that had wrought their consternation. She only regretted that she must lose the sight of Roy's horrified visage when he should return to discover her flight. Her eyes gleaming with mirth, she arose cautiously, favoring the unused joint, and stepped off the low -piazza,   60         JESSA JTNE. Even when she felt the cool, delicious turf under foot, she steadied herself by grasping the nearest objects that of- fered a support. First it was a clump of box, then the stout prickly branches of a Japan apple-tree, then a fan- shaped trellis, which would by and by be'covered with -Cyprus vines. She -.would do nothing rashy-would come to her own by degrees. But when another step would bring her within arms' length of the florists, she trod firmly upon both feet, and feeling neither pain nor weakness, laughed aloud in wicked glee, and took that step. She saw Eunice start and grow white; saw Orrin's grave yet courtly surprise as lie advanced to offer his arm. Ere he could reach her, the treacherous ankle gave way with a wrench that drove breath and sense in one quick shuddering breath from her body. As they left her, she heard, like a strain of far-off music, a voice say in her ear, "My poor child!"Ihad a dizzy thought that strong arms-stronger than Eunice's -received her: Then, all was a blank until she awoke upon her lounge, hair and face dripping with wet; the scent of sal volatile tingling in her nostrils, and a cluster of anxious faces about her. Eunice's was the first she knew, Roy's next. He was on his knees by her, chafing her hands. She pulled them feebly from his hold, and clasped them about his neck, hiding her eyes upon his bosom. "O, Roy! I was very wrong! very foolish! Don't 'scold me." "Hush! hush!" he said, soothingly. "Nobody thinks of scolding you! If you apologize to any one, it must be to this gentleman. He brought you into the; house, and   I suspect his arms want looking after more than your foot does." He laughed, not quite steadily, in saying it, and Jessie felt his fingers tighten upon hers. She flushed up rosily -was herself again, as she looked around for Orrin. He was in the rear of the family party, as was seemly, but his eyes were bent upon her with a singular fixedness- the irids closing in upon a spark that flashed and pierced like steel. Involuntarily, she shut hers, for a second, as if blinded. He came forward at that. "Don't believe himn!" said the same voice that had sent its echo through her swoon. "I am none the worse for the slight exertion. I consider myself very fortunate in having been near enough to help you, when you fainted -am very thankful that you are better. Come with me, Roy! Here is the doctor I If he scolds you, Miss Jessie, please consider me your champion." The doctor, being an old friend, did scold the '" mad- cap," who had, he for a while averred, undone his and Nature's fortnight's work. Relenting, finally, at Jessie's pretty show of penitence, he confessed that less harm had been done than he had expected, and contented himself with sentencing the delinquent to two days' strict confine- ment' to the sofa, and 1" serious meditation upon what might have been the result of her imprudence-her reckless step.' ("tMy misstep; you mean," said the incorrigible patient. "If I had not lain here so long already as to forget how to walk straightly and squarely, and to maintain the centre of gravity, this would not have happened." Altogether, the evening was gayer than usual to all.   ,62         JESAMNKE. Jessie's spirits were exuberant to a degree her sister feared was lysterical, and Orrin seconded her s;allies with a quieter humor, that amused the rest and enchanted her. "It was worth my while to faint " she owned to him, sotto voce, when he came up to say "(Good-night." t"I wish I had done it before!" Her cheeks were red with exciteient; her eyes laughed up into his with archl meaning that was very bewitching and very indiscreet. His pupils contracted suddenly to the blue spark, and his left palm covered the little hand he held within his right. "You are very kind!?" was all he said with his lips. "What treason are you two whispering there?" ques- tioned Roy. "Nothing that concerns you in the least!" answered Jessie, saucily. "We will keep our own counsel-won't we?" to Orrin. He was too sensible to lie awake thinking, at an hour when people with accommodating consciences and gutta- percha hearts are wont. to sleep soundly. Nor had he ever contracted the uinsafe and irrational habit of talking: audibly to himself-one to which poor Jessie was ad- dicted. Yet he had his thoughts as he put out the candle in his bedroom that night. "She is either a born flirt, and over-anxious to practise her calling, or she is the most charming, because most novel compound of naivete, cleverness, and feeling that has crossed my path for many a day. In either case, she is a study." The best and the worst women were with him resolved into that-studies, all,-and  when they had fed his   II,.

As the dis- secter of men's bodies soon, loses his reverence for what- iHi ever of divinity the common mind may discern in the huiman formn; as the anemone and the nettle are 'to the botanist but different combinations of stamen, pistil, and petal,-so your professed student of character, your mortal searcher and tryer of souls, merges heart into head in the practice of his art. Sorrow has no sacred- ness; Love nio warning purity; Pain no appeal to him. Sensibilities are interesting only as they quiver and shrink beneath his touch; Affection is his plaything; blasted hopes, withered and wounded hearts, are the un- considered debris of the sacrificial honors done the ensan- guined Moloch of his Self-love.

Dr. Baxter was the nominal head of the faculty of professors, and Mrs. Septimurs [Baxter was virtual autocrat of his home. He was a little man, physically, at his best, which was when he was in his own realm-the area enclosed by the walls of his lecture-room. There was, in popular phrase, "no fitl" to his clothes. His trousers bagged at the knees, and his coats hung in loose folds down from his shoulder-blades, on the very day they left the tailor's shop; were shabby within twenty-four lhours. He had a trick of brushing the nap of his hat the 'wrong way in his abstracted moods, and of twisting his forefinger in   one bow of his white cravat until he dragged it into a slovenly loop, two crumpled wisps depending from it. Another and his most inveterate habit was, to tie h1is handkerchief into a succession of tight knots while he lectured, preached, prayed, and talked. Each marked a j   step in ratiocination or a rise in interest in the matter !   that engaged his mind until the climax of proof or dI'  animation was reached, when he would begin to untie ![  them, one after the other, timing the process so judi- ciously that"Amen!" or "Quod erlat demonstrandum!" passed his lips as the released cambric swept through his hand in a flourish prior to its restoration to his pocket. Nevertheless, he commanded respect from students and professors. Hlis courage in grappling with crabbed or ponderous themes; the eagle eye that penetrated the vapors of mysticism, detected the insidious thread of sophistry, which, intertwined with legitimate argument, was gradually but fatally guiding the inquirer away from the truth; the bursts of real eloquence, passages of beauty and pathos, that starred the didacticism of his dis- courses, electrifying his hearers as the musical ring from the desiccated tortoise-shell may have startled the god who tripped over it-these made him   a hero to his classes,- a man to be consulted and reverenced by his co- laborers. Moreover, he had a great heart within his narrow chlest, soft as a child's, generous to self-abnega- tion, and full of suchl holy and Christiau graces as love' the shade, while thellir unconscious aroma betrays their existence to all who pass. Mrs. Baxter had been a belle, and she would hardly have cast a second glance upon the small and shablby divine, but for two weighty reasons. By some unac-   "         JESSASMNE. countable freak of Cupid, or of Fortune, the popular Miss Lanneau had counted her thirtieth year without exchanging her celibate state for that which she lalguishilgly avowed would be preferalble to one of her dependent nature and seeking sensibilities. She laughed yetwithl her lips and executed arch manleuvres with her speaking eyes whllen unfeeling allusion was made in her presence to the "crooked stick " that awaits the over-nice fagot gatherer, and to the forlorn and aged virgin, also a wanderer in woodlands, who answered the owl's "To-who?" all the freezing night with the despairing--"Anybody!" But at heart she was growing restless, if not unhappy, when Dr. Baxter fell in her way. She was a litthrate ur, as well as a beauty, and her reverend suitor was a man of note --a distinguished clergyman, a savant and senior profes- sor in a highly respectable institution of learning. She had longed for a career " all her life-for a sphere of decided influence-social and literary. Would a more promising avenue to this ever be offered ler? She over- looked the"'ill-fitting coat, the dragged cravat, the inevi- table handkerchief. As she put it, she " set the subjective where it should always be placed--above'the grosser ob- jective." In direct English she married the doctor, and had for fifteen years made him an excellent wife. If his testimony were of importance in this case-and he was a sturdy truth-teller-he wanted no better. I have said that he was a little man at his best. He was a pygmy on a certain evening in the November succeeding the Dundee Centennial summer.  To begin with the most severe of the dwarfing processes to which he had been subjected. It was a reception night in the presiden- tial mansion. Mrs. Baxter had given a party the previ-   H   '     *    JESSAMEB.      ..   6T ous week, and now sat in state, as was the Hamiltonian usage, to receive the calls demanded from those who had been the invitees on that occasion. The ceremony in its imildest form would have been purgatorial to her sponse, ig but she had aggravated the torture by personally superin- ':i tending his toilette. This accomplished, she entreated ?  lhim if he had one atom of regard for her, to leave neck- tie and handkerchief alone for that night; walked him il; into the parlor, and] inducted him into an immense easy chair directly beneath a bracket-lighllt; thrust an illumin- ated folio-one of her centre-table ornaments-between his "ngers, and withdrew to her own chair a little way off, to examine the effect. "You are really picturesque, my love!" she decided, in hloneyed patronage. "If you ca n only remember to sit upright instead' of slipping down in the lap of your chair until your coat-collar shows above the back of your neck, you will make a fine study for a sketchb of 'Learned  Leisure,' or something of that kind."- Thle poor Ian smiled resignedly, and beganmto turn the leaves of his book. It was a sacred album, the work of his wife's fair fingers, althoughp he did not know this. "I flatter myself you will iind some Choice bits there 8 ; she said, modestly.

She was, in feature and coloring, a pretty wdcnan still, in defiance "ofher forty-five or forty-six years. Her brown eyes were. ,^B^   B8         JESSAMNE. lively; the red of her complexion, if a trifle fixed and hard, seldom outspreading the distinctly defined round spots upon the cheek-bones, was hers honestly, as were the glossy curls that showed no frost-lines, and the pearly teeth she 1had trained her lips to reveal at every possible opportunity. Her hands were plump, white, and small, and would have been smaller had she exercised themn less. Like the teeth, they were too obtrusive. She could not say "Good-day" to a passing acquaintance without part- ing her lips in a wide smile over the milk-white treasures, tucking away their natural covering in an incredibly narrow fold above the ivory, and stretching it below into a straighlt line which lost itself in creases that had once been dimples. She had been renowned in her youth for her vivacity, and had cultivated it into what nobody was kind enough to tell her was frisky affectation. The ex- tent to which the pliant fingers curved, and twined, and twinkled, and sprawled, in the course of a conversation of moderate length, was a thing of wonder forever to the uninitiated spectator of her gambols. She added to this gesticulation a way of plunging forward from her girdle upward, when she waxed very animated, that threatened to precipitate her into the lap of her fellow-colloquist, after whch she would lay her hand upon her, heaving bust, and *swallow audibly, while awaiting a reply to her latest deliverance. To sum up description in one word- Mrs. Baxter's speciality was Manner. iHer friends were correct in one laudation. She was amiable and kind-hearted in her way, as her husband was in' his. If she trafficked upon this excellence, made the most of it, very much after the style in which she showed off her teeth and hands, it was rather because display - .   ^ JEXSSAINE.        69 was her controlling foible, than through any design upon the answering gratitude of her beneficiaries. She was dressed in black silk, with a jaunty velvet basquine, a sca rlet scarf of Canton crepe fastened upon te rigllht shoulder with an antique cameo, and knotted under the left, the fringed ends falling low down upon her skirt. She was just established in her comfortable causeuse, ;,7, when the door-bell heralded a visitor. "My dear Mr. Wyllys!" she cried, fluttering forward to meet him. "You are doubly welcome when you come alone. One sees you so seldom except in a crowd, that it is a genuine pleasure to have a few moments' quietcon- versation with you." "It is like yourself to excuse my unfashionably early call with suellh graeiou tact,"' responded the gentleman, bowing low over her hland. He shook hands wh the doctor with less empresse- 1 ment, but most respectfully, and sank upon a divan near the hostess.             .  "I have another engagement this evening, but I co-uld not deny myself the pleasure of paying my devoirs to you in passing. I will not ask if you have reco6vered from the fatigue of Thursday night --with an expressive look at her blooming face. ' I believe, however, it is never a weariness to you to be agreeable, as it is to us duller and less benevolent mortals. I am horribly cross, - always, on the morning succeeding a party.

"If thle doctor-dear, patient martyr!-were put into the witness- box, hle might tell sad tales, make divulgations that would demolish your pretty ald flattering tleory. Doctor, my love! Mr. Wyllys is anxious to know whlat was the status of my spiritual and mental thermometer, on the morning after our little re-unionz, last week?" "Ehl, what did you say, my dear 2 " He lowered his --folio. His- eyebrows were perked dis- contentedly, and his forefinger was in the doomed bow she Ihad tied not fifteen minutes before. Mrs. Baxter tried, unsuccessfully, to frown down the' offending digit before she made reply. "Mr. Wyllys has heard that I am like champagne, Cstale, flat, and unprofitable'-with a dash of vinegar- when the effervescence wroughlt by social excitement is off," vivified, by her mirtlhful misrepresentation of her visitor's words, into radiance thlat revealed every molar, and forced, her eyelids into utter retirement. " Al!" The doctor smiled absently, and re-bent lis brows- over the page, protruding his lips in a vicious pout as he read. '4He disdains to notice the slander," resumed Mrs. Baxter, unabashed at her failure" to elicit a conjugal compliment.  Seriously, Mr. VmVyllys, I amn thankful for the guidance of reason and will that counterbalance ms mercurial temperament.

"It is preposterous!" ejaculated the doctor, closing the Russian-leather album with a concussion like the re- * port of a pocket-pistol. "I think not, dear," said the wife, gently corrective, "It is, as Mr. Wyllys says, a rare combination, but cer- tainly not an impossible one." "It is preposterous," reiterated the doctor, with a ruin- ous tug at his cravat, " that a rational creature, who can read and write, should waste time in disfiguring good, honest paper with such ilnconglruous, not to say blasphe- - mous, nonsense as I find here. Itiwas bad enough for me- diaeval monks to declk the CWord of Life in the motley wear of a harlequin.

But when the sacred Script- mures are bedizened into further illegibility by paint and gilding, and illustrated by birds, beasts,^and even fishes daubed upon fields, azure, argent, and verde, the offence becomes an abomination. Such profanation is offered that divrinest of pastoials, the twenty-third psalm, in this volume," elevating it in strong disgust. ig   Mrs. Baxter arose and took it froin his hand in time to save it frorm being, tossed to the table or floor.

"I will not ask you to look at it again, love,"-still amiably. She returned to the subject when the critic had helped himself to at,volume which 'was more to his taste. "I saw few things when I was abroad, before my mar- riage, that interested me more than the illuminated mis- sals and breviaries preserved in convents, muselums, and private collections of vertu," she said to"Mr. Wyllys. I anm the possessor of a relarkably fine specimenelof the illuminator's art-the gift of a dear friend and rela- tive, now no mole.

Orrin examined it in pleased surprise. -Ie had ex- pected to see an absurdity. Hle beheld a gem of its kind; a collection of Latin hymns, including the Stabat Mater, Dies Irve, and Veni Sancte Spiritus, each page encicled by a border of appropriate design, and delicate yet 4ich coloring.  i "I have never seen arything finer. I do not wonder that you prize it highly, I thank you for showing it to me," he said, sincerely. ' By whom was it executed " "My friend ordered it for me of an-adept in his art, then resident at Florence. I forget his name, but you will find it cleverly concealed from the common eye in some one of the convolutions of the title-page," was: the reply. The fly-leaf adhered slightly to the page designated, and Orrin read the inscription upon the former before detaching it. "'Jane .Lanneau', Sfrom Ginevra. Florencee January- I st, 1 8-.' I have surely seen that handwriting before! 'Ginevra!'" he repeated slowly, and the pretty name fell musically from his tongue. "There is poetry in the ' word!" "You would have said so, had you known her!" Mrs. Baxter winked away two unbidden tears that glazed her  - , eyes, without forming and dropping--swallowed anew and very hard. "She always reminded me of a plaintive poem set to music. That is, in the later years of an exist- ence which was all song and sunniness when it was fresh and new."  Orri- fluttered a few leaves; commented upon the   74         JJESSAJfNEY. grace and finish of a decoration here and there, and went back -to. the inscription. It was strongly like Jessie Kirke's writing, but the resemblance was undoubtedly accidental. The' one line had been penned, he learned from the date, before she was born. "She was the Helena to my Hermia," pursued the hostess. "We lived the same life until her marriage, which preceded mine by five' years. She was my senior by some months, but in heart and soul we were twins!" -pressing her hands gradually together, beginning at the wrists, and passing upward to the finger-tips, to express the idea of oneness. "And by a most extra-or-di-nary coincidence, we both married clergymen!" "Another evidence of the perfect harmony of soul ex- isting between you. Did I understand you to say that she is not living?." "Alas! she has been in her grave for fifteen years. I never saw her after her marriage, which was a surprise to all her friends. We anticipated a brilliant union for her. But she bestowed herself, her talents, her beauty, upon a clerical widower who was twelve years older than herself. My poor Ginevra! it was a strange ending to her san- guine dreams. Mr. Kirke was a scholarly man, it is true, and a thorough gentleman, and of his devotion to her there could be no doubt. It was such worship as few women can inspire. I believe that he tried faithfully to make her happy, but my personal acquaintanceship with hiln was very slight." "Kirke!" repeated Orrin, more deliberately,and witht less emphasis than was his wont, and he was always the reverse of abrupt. Hls lazy articulation now was almost a drawl. "I know a gentleman--a clergyman of that   I        X, .JESSA N7E MR -       75 IJ   name--Rev. Donald L. Iiirke, resident, now, and I fancy for many years, at Dundee--" "It is the very same!"Mrs. Baxter started tragically, , and leaned gaspingly toward him, her throat swelling like a pouter pigeon's. "And you know him, you say . Tell me something about him-about his family! My sweet !   cousin left a child, I know. Does it still live a Dundee! yes! that was the quaint Scotch name of my Ginevrals new home. I have always associated it with ' The Cot- ' ter's Saturday Night.' You recollect 'Dundee's wild, warbling measures' '? Do sit down and tell me all!" "You should visit Dundee," said Orrin, sauntering back to the fireplace, but declining the seat she offered. "It is a beautiful valley--sheltered from storms by a bar- ricade of picturesque hills. I was there in May, and the climate and flowers-especially the wealth of roses, re- minded me of sunny Provence. I became quite well ac- quainted with Mr. Kirke. He is, as you describe him, a thorough gentleman-one of the genuine ' old school'- handsome, refined,' and scholarly. His daughters, of whom there are two, are cultivated ladies. The younger -who is, I presume, the child to whom you refer-is, I have heard, very like her beautifulmother. You would be interested in her, first, for your cousin's sake, but very soon for her own. This matter of family likeness is a curious one. I see now what was the resemblance that puzzled me last Spring.' Miss Jessie Kirke might easily be mistaken for your daughter." "(If she were, what a happy woman I should be!" cried the flattered lady, casting up her brown eyes, and raising her clasped hands -to a level with her chin; "The relief afforded by your charming description is beyond expres- -           ' , , e 'yo   76         JESSAMNE       .i sion.

"Perhaps it would be as well not to mention me in colection with this renewal of your intercourse with Mr. Kil-ke's family," he said, carelessly. "Your friend- ship will be the more welcome if it is supposed that it has its root in your fond recollection of your lamented relative.

WYLYS was careful not to repeat his visit within a week.  He could trust to the natural growth of the seed he had sown, and he was too politic to appear solicitous, on his own account, for the resumption of cousinly intercourse between the houses of Baxter and Kirke.  He did not overrate his influence with the would-be leader of H-Iamnilton society. Four days after his party call, he had a note from Jessie. "DEAR COUSIN ORRIN: "I enclose a letter received last night from Mrs. Baxter, wife of the President of Marion College. She is, I have learned from this, my nearest living relative, outside my immediate family circle, being my mother's first cousin. I never heard of her until the arrival of this communni- cation. -My father knew hers years ago, but did not re- menber whom she had married. I little imagined when I listened to Boy's praises of his friend, Dr. Baxter, that   H    I had alny personal interest in, or connection with his ,'   family. Mrs. Baxter writes, you see, in. an affectionate ,t   strain, and is urgent in her request that I should pass the ,  pwinter with her. My father and sister agree with me -that you are the proper person to consult with regard to "  mly answer to the invitation.  You are, doubtless, ac- 1 A" quainted with Mrs. Baxter, and are certainly more aUfait I'd  to the usages of Hamilton polite society than we are. n .  ",Tell me freely what you think I ought to do-freely  j  as if I were in blood, as I am in heart, Your Kinswoman, "JESSIE KLEE." "Here is an example of hereditary transmission that would  stagger Wendell Holmes himself!" thought Orrin, scanning the epistle, letter by letter. "The chirography of the girl, who could not write at the time of her mother's death, is precisely similar to hers-as simnilar as- it is unlike that of the sister by whom she was educlated. ' It is a nut to crack for those who carp at the idea that the handwriting is a criterion of cllaracter, who attribute variety of penmanship to educational influences entirely. What has my fair 'kinswoman' inherited from her matronal progenitor besides her features and carriage, and these sloping, slender Italian characters, I wonder? It may be worth my while to investigate the question as a psychological phenomenon."  . To secure the facilities for doing this, hle resolved to' run down to Dundee the next day. The early train he had condemned in the spring, started now before daylight, and he called himself a fool, as he took his place in the cold, smoky car, for making   bod J           LX...v the journey at all. Being mortal, he was liable to these spasms of. prudence and faltering of purpose, daring which he held serious questioning with Common-sense- leaving feeling out of the discussion-whether he welre snot squandering time and thought in prosecuting hs favorite patimne of winning and wasting hearts. :He knew that, viewed in the dead white light of sober judg- mlent, tested by. commercial rates, his ambition to stand chief victor in Cnpid's lists, would be ignoble and unre- nmunerative. HHe felt that he wotuld himself thus rate it, lad he no other aim in life. Aware-as he was, that he kept step with his fellows in business pursuits, that. he was intellectually the peer of those the crowd called masters, he did not let the thought of adverse criticism of his affaires du ccsur weigh too heavily with him. It was easy to persuade himself that since the world's con- querors and prophets, sages, warriors, and saints, had, each in his time, esteemed the love of woman the worthiest meed of valor, learning, and piety; had fought, gone mad, and made shipwreek of faith, to gain and wear the prize, leaving upon record the aspiration " to waste life upon her perfect lips," alongside of heroic epics and re- ligious meditations,-his researches and successes in this field of art,-the mining and delving and polishing that attended his explorations among the curiosities of woman's affections and follies-were lawful and dignified, and should entitle him to an honorable grade in the school of philosophers. Apart from these cold-blooded considerations (a man flirt is always more cold-blooded than a woman-coquetry and the desire -to conquer hearts being oftener a passion with the latter than a deliberate plan)-apart from these   i  rJtiji MLVi. ff1 I say, Orrin Wyllys was, as he would have said of 'him- self, " not a bad fellow." He liked to give pleasure, to be useful to his kind, to be thanked and praised for his benefactions, Finding myself, once upon a time, in the actual presence and in social converse with one of the brightest of modern (American) stars-a man I had reverenced afar off, as a mental and moral monarch among mortals, I was disenchanted and appalled at hearing him say some- thing like this:  "I have no patience with this talk about finding one's truest happiness in promoting that of others. I believe that man is best employed who makes the most and best of HMSELF! My business in life is to improve Myself by every means at: m command-to make Myself, spiritu- ally and intellectually, 'round and perfect as a star,' without diverting my energies and wasting my sympa- thies with projects for the good of my race. - This is my idea of true philanthropy." "And the rest of mankind may go hang!" said a plain- spoken auditor. The Star shrugged his broad shoulders. "de n'est'as amor acfaire / " This was, substantially, Orrin's creed, but he had his own notions'as to the manner in which the cultivation of Self was to be conducted, and being still some degrees below the exalted plane of observation occupied by the aforesaid Star, was not superior to the weakness of talk- i!!g about philanthropy, even believing himself that he -did good for good's sake, and that his satisfaction in see- ing others made happy through his instrumentality, was pure benevolence. His charities were many--aid open.. 4*   82         JESSAMYE. Indeed, Lady Patronesses shook their heads, smilingly, at him while deprecating his a soft-hearted credulity"  and lauding his generosity, and his name was a synonym among men for good-nature and lenient judgment. Therefore, when he muttered--"Just like, my con- founded amiability, this taking so much pains to benefit those who may never appreciate my motives, nor be grateful for what, I have done!" as he buttoned his over- coat up to his chin and pulled on his fur-lined gloves, he half believed that he spoke sincerely-went systemati- cally to work to arrange his projects with the best side toward him; found substantial comfort in so doing. Roy had left his affianceed to his guardianship, and her action at this juncture might be fraught with important consequences to her and to Roy himself. He could allay Mr. Kirke's scruples, if he had any, relative to his daugh- ter's acceptance of Mrs. Baxter's pressing offer of hospi- tality and chaperonage, better in five minutes' talk than by twenty written pages. He was anxious that Jessie should pay the visit. She had taken a strong hold of his fancy, and he could study her to advantage while she was her cousin's guest; be her cavalier wherever she went, by virtue of the authority vested in him by her absent be- trothed. Hamilton was dull this- season. There was not a woman in it whom he had not read from preface to "Finis-"-and his energies were chafing for lack of ex- ercise in his noble vocation. The prospect; of Jessie's coming--the high-spirited child of nature, lively and lov- ing, was very tempting.    - But this was, he perceived, a digression, and he hastened to regain the original line of thought. His scheme-- which Mrs. Baxter must, be suffered to believe was her's,   instead-of giving the country clergyman's daughter a season in town, was a golden opportunity of improvement of her mind and manners that should not be lightly cast aside. She had, more than once, confidentially bemoaned her inability to procure in Dundee the tuition in music and German she fancied she needed to qualify her to fill worthily the station to which Roy had elected her. The reader of human nature smiled a little just here. "When, if the truth were known, the practical Pro- fessor would be better pleased--aye! and better served in the long run, were his Jessamine to confine her ambi- tion to the realms of cake, and bread, and butter making. I have seen other women as mistakenly risk complexions and eyes in poring over books, under the fond impression that they were 'qualifying' themselves to be their hus- band's 'help-meets'! What an age of shams is this!?' Since,l howevelr this was Jessie's delusion, it might as well be indulged. She could have excellent music and language masters in H-amilton. He would, himself, snatch a few hlours, weekly, that he might read German witl lier. The readings would prevent him from rusting in a language once familiar to him, as his own, and he would find further compensation for his trouble in the elljoymenlt he foresaw in guiding her eager mind through the rich storehouses of literature a knowledge of Ger- man would unlock for her. Waxing more complacently benevolent, he dwelt upon the comfort and pleasure Mrs. Baxter-a worthy, though ridiculous, creature-would derive from the companionship of her young friend. The Lady President was a born Patroness. The intro- duction of the sparkling luminary he was sure Jessie would become in the Hamiltonian firmament, would be   s4         JES SAMNE. with her a work of pride and love. She would spare no pains to make the novice's sojourn in her abode delight- ful to all parties interested in it. Notwithstanding which irrefragable reasoning-such was the effect of atmospheric and other extraneous influ- ences upon one in the undisputed possession of a sound body, sane mind, and serenely approving conscience- Mr. Wyllys relapsed into discouragement several times in tile earlier stages of his journey; wrote himself down an ass for taking the trouble of a ten hours' ride intofthe country at this gloomy season to accomplish that, which, after all, might have been settled by letter. Break- fast by gas-light, a hard run through muddy streets to catch the train; a seat in a damp, close-smelling car, which was chilled, rather than warmed, by a stove-full of green wood, were sorry tonics for preparing spirits and temper for the duties of a new day. It annoyed the phi- lanthropist that he could not put from his mind the vision of Roy Fordham's happy face as it shone upon his wak- ing sight one July morning-the first of the summer va- cation. Valise in hand, he had burst into his cousin's sleeping-room to say "Good-by," for he was off, by peep of dawn, to Dundee and Jessie. Orrin remembered every word that had been spoken; how he had forborne to re- mind- the rapturous lover that this was the last visit he could pay his promised bride before his departure for Europe in August, and the calm surprise he had felt at seeing " prudent," far-seeing Roy- apparently oblivious of all save present delight. - Oddly, enough, it would have been more agreeable to his trusty relative to think of the absentee as a staid, studious personage, whose affections were always subservient to duty and judgment.   JESSAMNE.          185 - Few of earthly mould--such are the freaks of imagi- nation and the complications of nervous irritationl-are, at all times, superior to like vicissitudes of purpose and temper. I trust, then, that my hero will not suffer ma- terially in the opinion of the exceptional minority, when I state that it was near noon ere he finally and stably relassured his dubious mind that in this flying visit to the parsonage, he was acting wisely for Himself, and, as secondary, thiird and fourth rate considerations, for Jessid, Roy, -and- Mrs. Baxter. The lever that completed the' task of elevating his self-esteem from the slough of doubt, was not the anticipation of Jessie's personal and mental im-provernent, or. Mrs. Baxter's gratified maternal long- ings. It was the thought how the light imprisoned in Eunice Kirke's berylline eyes, would break up to the surface in the golden glints he had seen, at infrequent intervals, dash their placid darkness; how her slow, bright smile would greet his unexpected appearance, and applaud his vivacious sallies; the sweet monotone, many a queen of fashion would give her costhest jewels to imitate successfully, reply to his-questioning. For he would have many questions to put. This was a studious autumn -with the sisters. While Roy had laughed ai Jessie's lamentations over her lack of learning, pr:otesting that she ' knew more already of books and men than any  professor's wife he had ever met," he had, in compliance with her desire, and believing that active employment would be wholesome discipline for her in the weary mnonths of their separation, arrangedi a schedul'e of history, ancient and modern, French, German, and gen- eral reading for her. Orrin had also visited Dundee in the August vacation, accompanying Roy back to town,   86tu        JESSAMNE. and not quitting him until he waved his farewell from the pier to the slowly-movingu steamship  "outward bound." During those sad, precious "last days," the disengaged pair were, of necessity, often left to entertain one another for hours together, and their decorous friend- ship had matured naturally-and gracefully into an equally decorous intimacy. Orrin had marked passages for EEunice's consideration in divers books they had glanced over in company; sent to her after his return to Hamilton, Carlyle, Emerson, and Macaulay; besides run- ning down for a day in October, to bring a thick roll of duetts, sonatas and etudes, and the whole- of 1Mozart's Twelfth Mass for Miss Kirke's practice in the lengthen- ing evenings. He had taken extraordinary pains to ascertain her tastes, and displayed his customary tact in ministering to these. "We are almost, relations-in-law, you know!" had been his only apology for attentions and gifts, and Eunice had accepted all in simple good faith. Her interest in his talk and her manifest liking for him, were a more .flattering tribute to his vanity than was Jessie's frank cousinliness. I think it is always thus witIl the tokens of favor vouchsafed to friend and ad- inirer 1by reserved, self-concentrated women. While Jes- sie was his especial study (or quarry) just now, he did not disdain the goods the gods offered him in the esteem and preference of the handsome elder sister. He had found her eminently convenient when his motive was to pique and mystify his cousin's betrothed by a feint of haughty indifference, and he was too wise an economist to cast aside what he had gained. He would be a clumsy   JESSAME.          87 diplomatist, indeed, were he to prove hi mself incompe- tent to the management of two affairs at the same time. If my attempted analyzaition of a " fascinating man's " principles, and intentions has seemed prolix to the surface- reader, he will bear in mind that it is but a meagre abstract of what Mr. Wyllys thought, felt, and reasoned through the dreary November day, that did not see the sun Until a break in the clotids low uplon the western hills let out his light upon a sodden, wretched earth. The late rays burnished Windbeam's coronal of cedars into golden-green, but curling fleeces of mist clung about his mighty chest and flanks, making him look grimmer and blacker by contrast; the valley was full of ,shadows, purple and gray; the old church was lightless save for the one dazzling arrow which was shivered against the slender tip of the spire, when Orrin undid the latch of the parsonage-gate. Proven9al warmth and roses were things that belonged to the dead summer. Eunice's ever- greens hardly redeemed the garden from desolation.' A trim arbor-vitse hedge kept warm the southern border, that would be gayin March with crocuses and tulips; the box-trees were the only leafy shrubs in the alley down which Jessie had crept, to faint in his arms at the other end. A thrifty holly, beaded with scarlet, mounted guard at the left of the front steps, as did a cedar, cov- ered with bluish-white berries, at the right. A stately young pine he remembered as a favorite of Jessie's, filled the air with its solemn sighing, while he awaited the answer to his knock. "So, Winter comes even to the Happy Valley!" he moralized. "I ought to have known it, of course, only I had not thought of it." e   &88         JESSAMNE. Patsey, the good-humored servant-girl, opened the door, and welcomed Mr. Wyllys with the broadest of smiles. "Mr. Kirke and Miss Eunice is. not at home, sir. They're a-visiting some place in the village. Miss Jessie is in, though. Be pleased to walk into the parlor, and I'll tell her you're here." He heard swift feet skim the floor overhead as his name was repeated, and Jessie was in the room before he could take off his gloves. With a wild, scared face, lips that moved without sound, and eyes that demanded con- firmation or denial of the dread that was strangling her heart, she caught his hands and looked up dumbly at him. His smile broke the spell sooner and more effectu- ally than words could have done. She wrested her fin- gers from his, with a laugh so burdened with shame and happiness as to be more like a sob, testifying what had been the pressure and what was the release. "I was sure '-- "That I was the bearer of bad news from abroad. I understand," Orrin took up the broken sentence. "You were never more mistaken. 'Your letter; enclosing Mrs. Baxter's,-brought me. Your fears must take counsel of hope and faith another time. Roy was well when last heard from-well and happy, and, you may be sure, very busy. But what is this Z " leading her to the window and scrutinizing her with fond solicitude. "What have you been doing with yourself? I am afraid he keeps his pledge of health, and resignation to the Inevitable better than you do yours to him. Are you not well  You have been sick, and I was not told of it!" Her complexion was dead to sallowness; her eyes were   JESSAMNE.          89 leaden, the lids drooping wearily, and she was thinner in face and figulre than when he had parted fron her six weeks ago. Her dress, of dark, "navy" blue serge, made plainly, the long skirt heavy and still while she stood, and unrelieved save by narrow linen collar and cuffs, looked like a mourning garb. "The iater Dolorosa to the life!" said the quick- eyed lover of the fine arts to himself. "A blue hood x drawn well forward would make the likeness perfect. Who would have thought that a morbidly love-sick girl could, by dreaming and fretting, stamp her features with the imprint of that divine sorrow! Iarvellous are the tricks of Nature!" All this while he held Jessie's hand; his eyes seemed as if they could not leave the countenance whose 'change had so pained hm. The girl's faint smile was very grateful. "I am not sick! I have no physical ailment beyond a sensation of general good-for-nothinginess. I ought to be ashamed to confess it, but I imagine I have a touch of what fille ladies call the 'blues.' Papa would have in Dr. Winters a month ago, in spite of all I could do and say. He laughed at me a little, scolded me a great deal, and pronounced my malady dyspepsia, or low fever, or nervous debility-he was not certain which. In any case, his prescription was quinine, dumb-bells, and porter, ale, lager beer, or a decoction of gentian-root and chamomile flowers. Think of it!" with a grimace. "Could my cup of existence be more effectually embittered a I take qui- , nine, and swing the bells a thousand timnes each day, but I do not see that the regimen increases my appetite or in-akes me sleep better. There is nothing the matter witl !   90g         JES&M4NE.: me that will not yield to resolution and common-sense and-- and--time! I shall be ll right when I get used to things as they are,'? she continued, with feverish rapid- ity, marking his doubtful look. ' I need discipline, hard- ening, tempering. If papa and Euna would rate me soundly for my folly and childishness, the counter-irritant would brace my system. I should need no other medi- cine. But they won't, unfortunately!" She was laughing now, but not with her native glee.  1 Orrin's scrutiny-serious and tender-was prolonged until her eyes sank and a blush of the lost color tinged her temples. A sigh escaped him as he relinquished her hand, and walked twice through the apartment to collect thoughts and words.         /          I "My coming was timely," he said, drawing a chair to her side, "Dear child! your life is too precious to be wasted in unavailing regrets. Your peace of mind is dear to too many to be wrecked by morbid nursings.   j! Don't think me harsh! You should have something to   i' en'gage your time and thoughts beyond the routine of oc-  cupation and recreation appointed to you here; should see more of the world than that portion of it which is bounded by these mountains. You would starve upon what satisfies your sister. Duty to be performed-duty done-a straight course and strength to walk therein- e  these fill the measure of her earthly desires. Your tem- perament and your intellect demand a larger sphere  wider range for your mind and more food for your heart. You are dying of inanition, and you do not know it. You are a caged wild bird who-is trying to' learn to sing by note." She shook her head wilfully.   fj1 JiJJ *A 1  T.     1 , "You are altogether wrong. I have been pampered, housed, petted, until nerve and muscle, mental and spir- itual, are gone. I need a stimulant, but a moral one." Orrin changed his ground. "Wllat if I supply it in the guise of a German course, seasoned with unsparing admonition whenever you are illdolent or unreasonable?" he said, lightly.   . Y I'- - , ** ,  \ i   CHAPTER 1   VII. "ESS vain man than Mr. Wyllys would have been flattered by the effect produced upon the spiritless, faded creature, the mocking shadow of the old blithesome Jessie, by half an hour's talk with himself. A less patient man would have been chagrined by the discovery that his enumeration of the varied and substantial benefits that would accrue to her from the proposed visit to Mrs. Baxter, and the deli- cate skill with which he contrived to keep before her all the while the prospect of his society and guardianship, weighed but as thistle-down with the obtuse " love-sick girl,5' in comparison with the circumstance that Hamilton was Roy Fordham's home. Orrin was surprised, and not agreeably, when her own words forced this astounding fact upon him. "It will be the next best thing!" she. said, dreamily, a happy smile touching her lips and kindling up her eyes. "I have heard him talk so much of the place and the peo-   JESSA MNE.         93 pie, that it will be like revisiting half-remembered scenes -renewing former acquaintanceships. You will show me all his favorite haunts, let me see the friends he values most highly-won't you?  The ocean is narrower and quieter when I think of taking the walks and drives he likes best--which he has described to me over and over; of mingling with those who were his daily associates- who knew him before I did. Though I don't like -very well to think of thlat"-interrupting herself with a laugh. "I feel as if nobody had the right. It seems to me that I cannot recollect when I did nzot know him." She mused silently for some minutes-the tender light still trembling over her face. It was as if she had for- gotten his presence, until a sudden thought turned her to him with an abrupt query. "Mrs. Baxter knows nothing of-has heard no ru- mors?" in shy anxiety that appeared overstrained to one who had heard the loving soliloquy Orrin was prompt to decide was in very bad taste, even when the unconsidered listener was in the confidence of both parties. "Of your engagement " he said, with grave direct- ness. "Hamilton is in profound ignorance on that sub- ject. Roy knows how to keep his own counsel, and know- ing it was his wish -that your- betrothal should remain secret, for the present, I have mentioned it to no one. You need be under no embarrassment on that score."  "Thank you." Jessie was silent again, but the pause was filled with soberer thoughts. She began to fear lest she had been talking nonsense-- been indiscreet and unmaidenly.  Orrin kindly overlooked the lapse into selfish sentimen- tality, but she was\ ashamed that she had given him oc-   ":        JESSAMNE. casion for exercising forbearance on this subject. He noted, and with satisfaction, that she treated him to no more lore rhapsodies that night; did not voluntarily name Roy in the ensuing dialogue. "I am happy to learn that Mrs. Baxter is warm- hearted and sincere," she said, at the close of a searchng catechism upon that lady's characteristics. "I was pre- possessed in her favor, less by her letter, than because she loved my mother. My sister has been a dear and care- ful parent to me. You have seen what my father's fond indulgence is. But the core of my heart has ached for my mother-my own beautiful mother-ever since she died. 1 was not quite five years old, yet I recollect her as if I had kissed her for the last time, yesterday. M[y father had this oriel built to please her. I remem- ber seeing her nowhere else until she was carried up to her death-bed. Her easy chair stood there"-- pointing-" and her writing-desk beside it. When I could, by standing on tip-toe, just get my chin upon the window-sill, she would make mne measure with a bit of ribbon how much the jessamine had grown in a week. She planted these vines and tended theln as if they had been her children. She said to me, more than once or twice, that she hoped I would be like my name-flower when I grew  up--brave, sweet, faithful-telling how one had for fifty years curtained the porch of the house in which she was born, and how dearly she loved it. She made me her companion, andin. some sort, her confi- dante by the time I could talk plainly, and very proud I was of the distinction. She used to take me upon her lap, or'hold me closely in her arms as she lay on her lounge in the twilight, and repeat stories of her Southern   JESSAAf N'.m         95 home; sing ballads so sweetly sad that I could not help l crying quietly while I listened-very quietly, for fear she ; should hear me, and stop." It was twilight by this time. The mountain-crown was dusky as the plain; the elm-trees in the church-yard   i were swaying in the bleak wind that bowed the garden- shrubbery, and swept the long grass above neglected graves into brown waves. The naked, snake-like sprays of the creepers tapped monotonously against the window- panes. Orriu had healthy nerves, but as he looked through the glooming air at the shaft, standing like a sheeted gliost at the head of Mr. EKirke's second wife, and heard in the stillness of the place and hour, the sob- binog sighs of the pine boughs, he wished Jessie had chosen some other hour and spot for her weird reminis- cence than the November gloaming and this haunted re- cess. She was leaning back in her chair, her hands crossed, her face upraised to the sky : "I have a perfect picture of her before me, at this     moment," she went on, presently. "She, had large, soft eyes, and very dark hair. She was always pale, and she never laughed. But her smile: was my reward when I was good, as her kiss was the cure for every hurt. Nobody else can ever tell me such wonderful tales. Some were    ; in prose, many in verse, more beautiful to my apprehen- sion than any poetry I have read since. This was on her well days--my white days! when the writing-desk would, if I requested, be supplanted by the color-box    : and pencils, and we passed whole hours together-she and Hshe sketching or painting to illustrate anecdote  and fairy story, I perched in my-high chair at her side, R      ,             t    96         JESSAWTfE. loolking on in rapt delight. I believe that I was a troublesome child-noisy, wayward, passionate--to every- body else-in the house. I kept away fromn her of my own accord in my stormy or sulky fits. The earliest lesson taught me by my father was, that 'poor, sick mnamma  must not be disturbed.' I suppose it was on account of her feeble health that- he always heard my prayers, put me to bed at night, and nursed me in my infant sick- nesses. It was he who came to my crib in the dim light of one terrible January morning, and told me that she was in Heaven. I did not understand exactly what that meant, but I gathered that it was something very dread- ful from the sight of his emotion. I have never seen him weep except that once. I had sprung from my pil- low to sob out my childish grief in his arms. Hle pressed me to his bosom until I could scarcely breathe, and said, s over and over, in a strange undertone that terrified me j more than did the drip of the hot tears over my face- .  ' Ginevra's baby! Ginevra's baby!' Baby though I was, the scene is graven upon my memory for life."   j The wind shook the casement, and the bare sprays   L tapped more impatiently upon the glass, as the spirit of the dead mother might have signalled her child to let her in.                         : "Mrs. Baxter will never weary of talking with you   I : upon a theme so dear to you both," said Orrin, shaking off the superstitious fancy. Jessie was aroused to livelier speech by the suggestion. ' You have heard her speak of my mother, then?" " "Yes, but before I suspected the identity of the ' Gin- : ^ evra' who was her adopted sister, with your father's wife. By a singular mischance, she never named him to   JESSA BNI E         97 me until one day last week, when she asked if I knew  him-and you." He had equivocated so adroitly as to bar cross-examina i tion, he hoped, but Jessie's curiosity was not easily parried. ( Was that before or after she wrote to me?" "Probably afterward, for she told me that the sight of a keepsake given her by your mother had set her to think- ing of their early and close intimacy, and that she had 'obeyed the impulse which bade her make inquiries about you, and ask you to visit her.' Those were her words, as nearly as I can recall them. She expresses her- self warmly-but not, I honestly believe, more warmly than she feels." "I would not go to Hamilton had you recalled to her mind the fact of my existence. If love for her lost friend did not prompt her to seek me out, I would not owe my recognition to the recommendation of another. No! not to yours!"                     i Had he not read aright her sturdy pride, her jealousy for her mother's memory and her fathier's dignity .  With what wise pre-vision he had detected the danger, and, by his caution to Mrs. Baxter, averted it!         -  I Eunice, the beryl-eyed, also had her confidential talk with Mr. Wyllys that night. "Father," she said, after supper, as he tarried, for anll instant, in the dining-room. "I should like to speak with  i Mr. Wyllis for ten minutes when Jessie is not by. Can   - you contrive to call her out of the parlor, by and by?"  "Certainly, my daughter," he replied, without curiosity  I or hesitation. Jessie wait his pride and darling-very beautiful and -  *    98         JESSAMXE. gifted in his eyes. He lavished upon her the wealth of a heart that had never known its own depth until he met her inother. The, first Mrs. Kirke was the daughter of one of his college-professors, a little older than himself, very amiable, very discreet, and the best housekeeper in the parish. He owed much to her exemplary manage- ment since, relieved from cares domestic and pecuniary, he could devote much time, bring unjaded energies, and a free mind to the prosecution of the studies he loved so well. Without in the least entering into his enthusiasm in scholastic research, she laid down as one of the rules of her orderly household, that his study was forbidden ground to: heedless or intrusive feet; guarded him when he had entered the sanctum, and shut the door between himn and- the living, active world-as vigilantly as she wotuld have watched and defended hid treasure. He was "about his business," in her phrase, and to her just, prac- tical ideas of duty and life it was but right that people should be allowed to follow their lawful and allotted call- ings without molestation. She did not particularly enjoy her husband's sermons, but he found her bread, butter, and cake always to his taste. He was an accomplished linguist, and would have been glad to have one under his own roof, with whom he could converse in Italian, Ger- man, or French. She had, as his correct ear continually reminded him, but an imperfect acquaintance with her vernacular, according to classical standards. But her coffee was fragrant, clear, and strong; while a whiff of  her Young Hyson was as the scent of a zephyr that had  wandered over acres of flowering tea-plants, and made  the wishy-washy, or over-boiled decoctions of other housewives seem but weedy and rank abominations. If   JEISSAMNE.          99 the refined and sensitive young pastor kept within his own breast many thoughts, dreams, and regrets he would fain have shared with a congenial mate, it should have been a compensation that the shirt-front covering the sealed repository of these was snowy and glossy as a bran- - new tomb-stone; that the heels of his socks were always run before they went on his feet, and that in the years of their wedded life he never :found 'a button off. Mr. Kirke believed. fully all his parishioners said when they -assured him that he had a pattern wife, and that he ought to take good care of her, since he would never find another like her. She worked steadily and diligently-- she was never " fussy "--up to the day on which Eunice's little brother was born. "Overdid herself," said doctor and gossips, while her husband blamed himself bitterly for not having taken thought to spare her who had served him to the death. The death that came so swiftly and easily, she had time for neither parting word nor kiss. "I am tired, I believe," she murmured to the nurse. Unused to complain, she said it deprecatingly even in mortal weakness. "Do you think that I might just take a little nap? If Mr. IKirke should want for anything, don't hesitate to wake me at once." With that she-turned her face to the wall and died--" fell asleep," said her head-' stone. Her baby was buried with her. This was Eunice's mother.  Four years after the decease, the widower met Ginevra Lanneau at a watering- place whither he had gone for health, and she for dis- traction from certain troublesome memories. Whatever may have been her faults and weaknesses; whatever the - motives for her marriage and the causes of her subse-  quent invalidism and melancholy, this good man had  , -       :. -i'.;   100         JESSAIN NE. worshipped her with entireness of devotion; had mourned her with an intensity of anguish that bleached his locks;  bent his stately form toward the earth that had swallowed up his idol; deafened him to the calls of ambition that urged him to leave a seclusion endeared to him as her home and burial-place. But for all this, Eunice was his right hand, in Parson- age and in parish. HHe " really would have no excuse for a third marriage," was a commonl saying in the neighbor- hood-" with such a daughter to keep his house and ' do for him.'" If the spirit of the mother were permitted to watch her child's daily walk and conversation, it must have heightened her beatitude to be thus assured that "Mr. Kirke " was not likely, while Eunice lived, " to want for anything." Her father's trust in her discretion was implicit, and'when she unblushingly asked him to!" con- trive" to secure for her a tete-a-tete with a young and attractive man, he made no demur, formed no conject- ures. Nor did he doubt that the matter of her communi- cation to Mr. Wyllys was, in some way, essential to Jessie's weal. The first and abiding thought with both was " the child," 'he had yet made up his mind to part with. for a little while. Eunice was sewing by the shaded parlor lamp. - Wyllys, while he talked to both sisters, looked quite as often at her as at Jessie. He was in the mood for enjoying him- self, and his surroundings were propitious. He had had an excellent supper. Eunice had inherited her mother's taste and skill in the domestic department. Her D dainty cookery would have done credit to a salaried chevf, said Mr. Wyllys, than whom there were few better judges of all that pertained to the gratifications of the fesh. A i   ' JESSA MNE.          101 wood fire burned busily and gayly upon the castellated ,  ! fire-dogs of shining brass that flashed back the illumin- ation from a hundred curves and points. There wasa  breath of tea-roses and mignonette -in the air, for the shelf running around the inside of the oriel was filled with plants; crimson curtains had taken the place of nmuslin, at the other windows. A November gale-" a dry storm "-was rising without. It was pleasant, while hearkening to its blustering, to bethink himself that he had not to breast it in a tramp back to the hotel, he ;laving accepted ir. Kirke's invitation to sleep at the parsonage. The recollection of his disagreeable journey, now that he was rested, warmed, and filled, was another element in his present content. The old-fashioned parlor with its quaint and massive furniture, were more to his liking than the polish and glow of the modern " suite of rooms," every prosperous mechanic's wife now regards as one of the necessaries of life. From his leisurely and ap- proving survey of the apartment, his eyes came back to dwell longest upon Eunice. She wore a brown mering, that made no noise when she moved, and fell in classic folds about her as she sat in her straight-backed chair. A knot of blue ribbon joined 4, crimped ruffle above the high-necked dress, and frills of the same material were at her wrists. The light, strained through the ground-glass shade, made her skin seem fair  and fresh as that of a little child, while it did not blur the clear chiselling of her features. Her hands were shapely, her motions replete with quiet grace. The high-  - bred lady, stainless in deed as single in motive, spoke in  the fearless, tranquil eyes and composed demeanor.     -- "She rests me!" said the connoisseur in womanly loveli-  : , ' *;   102         JESSAINE. ness, to his appreciative self. "If I were obliged to marry either, I am not sure she would not suit me better than this restless gypsy, who keeps one perpetually upon the qui vive by her sharp interrorgations, her repartee, and variable moods. To secure the perfection of comfort, a man should be able to flirt with one all day, and come home at evening to recover from his dazed feverishness in the cool semi-twilight of the other's presence. I must find out, some day, if she llas ever been in love. I think not. There is a dewy firmness in the texture of her heart that seldom outlasts the fires of even a mild passion -such a timid flame as the pastor's daughter might con- scientiously feel for some pious under-shepherd or amor- ous evangelist." At this precise instant, Jessie, who had been flitting restlessly about the room, picking dead leaves from the geraniums, and seed-vessels from verbenas and mignonette, tossing them, one at a time, into the fire, and pensively watching the blaze feed upon them; parting the curtains to press her face against the glass "to see whetlher it rained," stopping once in a while to lean on her sister's chair and address a question to her or Orrin-obeyeld lier father's summons to his study. The two left at the fire-   a side, followed her to the door with their eyes, then these met. Eunice answered the questioning of Orrin's. "the is over-excited to-night. But there is a nervous restlessness about her of late that makes me anxious. I hope much for her from the proposed change of air and scene." She laid aside her work, neatly folded; put scissors and thimble in their cases, and the cases into her work- box, and calmly confronted her companion. tj ,      JES/AAM l.         103 "' Mr. Wyllys, I wish to say a word to you respecting my sister's antecedents before she goes to Mrs. Baxter." Without a symptom of surprise, he bowed, and ex- changed his seat for one near the stand by which she sat. In this one action, he accepted her confidence, and put his services at her disposal should she desire them. "From the descriptions of this lady, given by yourself and my father, I infer that she is affectionate and voluble. She will be likely to impart to Jessie all she knows of her mother's history, and question her concerning her own childish recollections. I have thought it best that you should hear the truth upon a subject that is rarely alluded to in our family. My father talked freely of it with Mr. Fordham before giving his sanction to his engagement with Jessie; but he has not spoken of it to me in many years-never to my sister. Should a garbled version of a story which is sad enough in itself, reach her ears, it would distress and bewilder her if there were no one near who could correct the mis-statement. My stepmother never recovered the natural tone of her health and spirits after my sister's birth. Her malady took the form of a gentle melancholy, indifference to domestic and neighbor- I ^   hood interests, varied at times by fits of wild weeping, so violent that she was confined to her couch with headache and debility for several days after each. She talked rationally when drawn into conversation, expressing her- self upon every topic discussed with clearness and intelli- gence; but the spring of action was-gone. She never complained of bodily pain; made no unreasonable de- mands upon the time and patience of those about her. Nor did she require to be humored and amused as is the way of most sufferers from confirmed hysteria.  Sh ! '            t          "        104         JESSAMNE. read much and wrote more, burning her manuscripts, however, as fast as they were finished. She' drew, too, rapidly and well, and upon these occupations expended what little energy of mind and body remained to her after the illness that had nearly cost her her life. We guarded her from intrusion and uncharitable remark as far as we could. My nurse, an elderly widow, was then alive, and was our housekeeper, her daughter being our only other servant. IIow the report originated,! cannot say-probably from some indiscreet , remark let fall by this daughter, who has now a home of her own some miles away--but within the year, a rumor has been brought to me that Jessie's mother died a lunatic. It is possible Mrs. Baxter has likewise heard such. If she has, and 'should be so imprudent as to repeat it to y, so unfeeling as to hint it to the daughter of that unhappy lady, may I rely upon you to tell my sister the exact truth? My step- mother lived and died a sane woman-as sane as I am this enoment. Jessie is impressible and ardent. Her love for her mother is a passion. It would nearly kill her if this slander were retailed to her." - She had made her little speech; summed up the case, and offered her appeal with such simplicity, such deft moderation, as challenged the lawyer's admiration. His reply was directly to the purpose. "Ybu may depend upon me,a Miss Kirke. I hope, with you, that I shall never be called upon to fulfil the trust with which you havse honored me. I am confident that Mrs. Baxter is ignorant of the particulars of her cousins ill-health. She has spoken to me with apparent frankness of her early life-of her marriage, and the se- clusion, that followed it."   JESSAMNE.         105 "For which she blames my father!" interrupted Eunice, red indignation staining her fair face. "Be- cause he would not subject his wife to the indifferent or pitying observation of those who had been the associates of hler brilliant girlhood; because he indulged her long- ^ ing for solitude and quiet; guarded her sledulously and tenderly from all that could tax .and jar upon her tort- ured nerves-li-he fell under their ban! He gave me some letters to'examine and file-or burn, if I thought fit--ten years ago. Among them I found one from Mrs. Baxter--one from another cousin of Ginevra Lanneau. They were written to him, just after her death. -Both reproached him--Mrs. Baxter (then Miss Jane Lanneau) gently, the other harshy, for separating his young wife from her friends and I imnmersing her in a savage solitude, where, cut off from all congenial associations, a nature so refined as hers could not but pine itself to death.' I do not quote from Mrs. Baxter. If she had upbraided the best of men and most loving of husbands in these terms, Jessie should never enter her house, unless under my protest."      ' "You are right. But, believe me, she will be safe and happy in Mrs. Baxter's care. Her goodness of heart is undeniable; her impulses are amiable, and she is, more- over, a woman of sound principles and genuine piety. She is vain, but never unkind or censorious. She always reminds me of the pretty bas bleu immortalized by the ' Spectator --or is it the ' Tattler '?' When '-says the essayist-,she would look languishing, there ii a fine thing to be said at the same time that spoils all. Thus, the unhappy Merab, although a wit and a beauty, hath not                     -      .   106        JESSAMNE. the credit of being either, and all because she would be both.' Our, Hamilton Merab has sterling traits, never- theless, and is incapable of using the language you have quoted. No one but a vulgar idiot could apply it to Mr. Kirke. The writer had, I take it, never seen him. You have every reason to be proud of your father, Miss Eunice. He is that best work of the Creator-a Christian gentleman,-I say it without reverence,-a prince of the blood royal." The golden lights glanced up from the dark wells of her eyes; her smile was grateful and exultant. "Thank you! I know you mean what you say, and it is but the truth." Neither spoke for a brief space., The soughing of the pine-tree was annoyingly continuous to Orrin's ear; the fire-flashes were silent. He tried to forget the vexing sound in remarking that Eunice's bent profile showed against the dark wood of the high, carved mantel, clear and fine as a cameo cutting, but it would be heard. "You were very young at the time of your step- :mother's death to be your father's assistant and co-adviser," he said, to prevent an awkward break in their talk. "I am surprised at the accuracy of your recollections." "I was fifteen. The elder daughter of a family early learns to assume and to bear domestic cares; is more mature at the same age than are those who come after her. I remember my own mother, who died eleven years earlier than did Jessie's. I was thirty last month." She picked up her sewing without a flutter or a blush, and Orrin, not daring to offer her the flimsy compliment of incredulity he would have paid another woman who   JESSAM lIAE.         107 had volunteered a confession disparaging to her per- sonal charms, was still casting about in his mind for words that should praise, yet not offend, when his opportunity was lost through Jessie's return to the room.   l -  i CHAPTER   Vi ll OU find us, in humble imitation of Mr. Turveydrop, still using our little arts to polish-polish I " said Jessie Kirke, mimicking the famous trowel gesture of the Professor of Deportment, as Orrin Wyllys entered Mrs. Baxter's drawing-room 'on the even- ing of the fourth of January. The Lady President's " collegiate re-unions " on the first and third Thursdays of each month had, up to this winter, been declared a nuisance by the class for whose benefit she had inaugurated the series; to wit, the homeless, graceless students whose intellectual training was committed to her husband and his confreres, while their polite education was left to Fate and the hap-hazard culture of promiscuous society. Now, promiscuous society -(the term-is Mrs. Baxter's-not mine) in Hamilton, although less detrimental to the principles, manners, and conversational powers of unguarded youth than the same foe would have been in a region more remote from the   JFESSAMNE.         09 9 great humanizing and refining centre expressed, to the visual organs, by the square, cream-colored .mansion at the right of the college campus-was yet inimical to the best interests (another stolen phrase!) of the aforesaid matriculated youngsters. To counteract the evil, the presidential residence was converted, on the evenings I have designated, into a social reformatory, and the ]mistress put forth her utmost energy to render the process of amelioration pleasant to the subjects thereof. The success of her system, which had gone into operation two years before, had been less than indifferent up to the date of her young kinswoman's arrival. Simultaneously with -her appearance at the pillared portal of the crearnm- colored Centre, the cause of elegant deportment and colloquial accomplishments began to look up in the contiguous halls of learning. The "reception" on the ensuing Thursday was well attended, the second was a "crush "-the supply of lemonade and sponge-cake inade- quate to the demand.  This was the third, and the hostess, elate with past, and sanguine of prospective, victories, had, with the assistance of her guest, bedecked iher rooms with New Year's gar- lands and floral legends. - As an ingenious tribute to the learning of the major portion of the assembly, Mrs. Baxter had accomplished a Latinization of certain stock phrases of welcome, and was immensely proud of the " classic air" imparted to her saloon by these. "I suppose they are all right," Jessie said dubiously' to Orrin, when he inspected them. "My knowledge of the dead tongue is confined to the musty sayings every- body has learned by heart--' Sic transit glori6 mundi  ' Mirabile dicti,' and the like."          - .   "O        JESSAMNE. "SALVE!'" blossomed into being in heather, and pink- and-white paper roses over the mantel opposite the door of the front parlor. Over that in the back-"J1bzemus vos salvere," while "Ofaustum et felicem wunGc die!" was tacked above the piano in the music-room. "To polish! to polish!" reiterated Jessie, stroking her gloved left hand with her right, and looking so roguishy beautiful that Orrin had no difficulty ill throwing an ex- pression of intense admiration into his gaze, "Stand off, and let me look at you!" said he, brusquely for him, drawing back for a better view. She was well worth it. Native quickness, aided by the marvellous intuition as to effect, and the -daring that attempts new combinations of color and untried styles of coiffure and dress, which people name "French taste," had wrought together in her attire. She had a " genius for apparel," Mrs. Baxter pronounced delightedly, adding "So much for blood! The Parisian eye and Parisian aptitude are, like the poetic afflatus, naseitur, non fit. You are a true Lanneau." There would be no better- dressed woman in the assembly to-night than. the country girl, whose toilette had yet cost less than that of any other who laid claim to the honors of belleship. H-er maize-colored tissue had a full double skirt; the upper looped with rosettes of black lace and narrow black velvet. A bunch of fuschias-scarlet with purple hearts, drooped above her left temple. Not a jewel was visible except her engagement-ring-a fine solitaire diamond. Instead of a brooch she wore another spray- of fuschias, mixed with feathery green, at her throat, and her only laces were those edging her neck and sleeves. But she was dazzlingsenough to turn stronger heads than those of   JESSAMNE.         1" the sheepish sopllomores, pert juniors, and priggish seniors, who would compose her train, thought Wyllys, surveying her with the deliberate freedom of a brotherly friend. Her eyes sparkled into splendor, her bloom deepened, and the white-gloved fingers toyed nervously with her bouquet as his inspection was prolonged. As the finale, he offered his arm with a sweeping obeisance, and they strolled through the rooms,;untenanted as yet save by themselves. "I hardly expected to see that, to-night," said Orrin, tonching her bouquet. "The utmost I hoped was, that it might please your eye for a moment, as it passed in re- view among a host of others." "There is a degree of modesty which is laughable," she returned. "Pray, whose flowers did you suppose I would prefer to yours?" "'Perhaps I feared the rivalry of the chaste assortment of sweet alysseum and white rose-buds I saw left at Pro- fessor Fairchild's door this morning.5" "Eminently suitable to my ' style '!"  interrupted she, ironically. "The fear reflects credit upon your discrimi- nation-and my taste." "Or--" he went on-" the astounding array of came- lias, azaleas, and orange-blossoms that arrived last night, duly enveloped in wet cotton, sent per express from the green-house of a city florist to the millionnaire's son --Senior Lownd-es.  Rumor affirms that he has neither studied nor eaten since he was first pierced by Cupid's arrows-your eyelids doing service as bows, and the sight of the magnificent offering which is to propitiate the blind god, has driven him clean daft with rapturous anticipation. Seriously and frankly, my advice is that you discard my   "2        JESSAMNE.- simple gift in favor of the exotics. I am content-or I should be--with the grace already shown me by your in- tention to give my flowers the place of hionor. But Mr. Low-ndes may be offended if you do not exhibit his Brob- dingnagian bouquet. It is already the talk of the place, and everybody expects to see it in your hands to-night." "It will not be everybody's maiden disappointment," said Jessie, obstinately. "The floral behemoth has a big vrase and a table all to himself in the music-room, so Mr. Lowndes can play show-man to his satisfaction. I reserve the right of wearing what I please, and my bouquet is part of my toilette. Could anything harmonize better with my dress than these scarlet verbenas, divided from the purple violets by the circlet of white blossoms, and capped by one snowy cape-jessamine--like a queen in her erminie ." "That is the only member of your family to be had in this frozen. region,- rejoined Orrin. "I telegraphed to Baltimore in the vain hope of obtaining the golden bells you love."  "Did you? - They do not bloom anywhere at this sea- son, I imagine. But your effort to procure them was an evidence of thoughtful kindness beyond my expectation and desert. You do too much for me! I am humbled yet happy when I recount to myself your favors." "Don't say' favors! ' If you knew--" "Knew what?" queried Jessie, innocently, looking up. He held her eyes for a second by the irresistible mag- netism of his, then, saying, with a short laugh that sounded like bitter self disdain-"What you will never hear from me " commenced talking fast and gayly about other things., o    IMff0- aM till . I     1 0-  Mrs. Baxter ran in, opportunely, to give Jessie time to collect her thoughts. Unobservant of the gravity of one I:  of the parties to the broken dialogue, and the forced liveliness of the other, the hostess dashed into a profusely illustrated description of tthe contretemps-that had de- tained her in her dressing-room. It was nothing less serious than the doctor's mistake, in taking from a closet a bottle of ink instead of the scented glycerine she asked him to get. "For my, tender skin (we Lanneaus are deplorably thin-skinned) is frightfully chapped this winter, and there is no better remedy for this affliction-than bay-,water and glycerine, as perhaps you know-you who are ignorant of nothing! 'Now, my dearest,' I said,' may I trouble I   you to pour it upon my hands as I hold them over the basin? Gently, doctor, darling! When, presto!"loovn came -an inky deluge!" screaming with laughter, as she iry  had with alarm when the mischance had occurred. "I spent nearly an hour in endeavoring to efface the murky S  stains, and I shall be compelled to keep my gloves on the entire evening. Isn't it a pitiable predicament?  The scarlet scarf was on duty again to-night, but now tied about her waist, the \ knot at the side. "I never feel quite dressed unless I have a speck of !!:; scarlet artfully brought into my costume," she had said i  to Jessie, on the evening of her arrival. "It individual- izes my attire. I should not know-should not be myself without it."  Jessie joined in her merriment over the catastrophe that would have angered a wife. whose temper was less even, but her heart was beating hard and hurriedly with vague alarms. Orrin had altered inexplicably of late.   ..  "!   "4         JESSA TrE. Hits sudden alternations of spirits and mysterious allusions were more than an enigrma-they were a distress to ller. "If I knew!" she repeated mentally. "What was he about to say, and why did he look at me so intently? Why did he refuse to finish the sentence? I have wounded or offended him-'-but how?" Self-condemnation was her first impulse when she noted a change in the demeanor of those she loved. Orrin ridiculed it as a morbid trick of mind that might be cured by reproof or raillery. Roy bore with it patiently and hopefully, recognizing in it an hereditary strain of melancholy which she would conquer or outlive in time. Her eyes were darker, her voice a tonie lower, her smile a trifle subdued all the evening, for the inci- dent that preceded the festivities. Nobody complained of the change. She was new, handsome, and sprightly, a triumvirate of recommendations that would have made her a star of note among her associates had her " style." been less unique, her cast of thought and conversation as commonplace as it was original. She was surrounded continually, to-night, by a group of gentlemen--most of them young, while there were some whose attentions- paid as they were by men of mature years and high standing, intellectual and social-were a- compliment of which the debutante might justly be proud. Orrin kept aloof from her, playing his part among the guests with his wonted spirit and grace. , But his eyes followed her furtively wherever she went, until she was provoked with herself for meeting them so often. He would suspect her of impertinent curiosity, accuse her of forwardness, or feel that he was under espionage. She would not look in his direction again. A resolution she   Ii  -XJSSAXT. 115 was certain to break within three minutes after it was made, tempted to the infraction by the stealthy yet pierc- ing ray she imagined she could feel, when her face was ! turned away from him, and which, struggle as she might f against the inclination, drew her regards again and again in his direction. She descried a new meaning in his watchfulness before long,-a sad yearning that would not let her out of his sight; mournfulness that might signify either compas- sion or regret. Unused to -dissemble, she must have I grown distrait, unmindful of the gay scene and the duties  it imposed upon her, but for the example of his fidelity j in the performance of these. Emulating what she plainly j perceived was self-denial in him, she talked, promenaded, and laughed with conscientious diligence, to the delight of her chaperone and the distraction of the smitten swains I of three classes, the freshmen counting as nobodies. The crowd was thinning fast when Orrin again ap- proaclled her. "We will finish our promenade now that there is room to move and breathe," he said, drawing her hand within his arm. "I want to have a moment's talk with you be- fore I go. I leave town early in the morning." The involuntary clasp of the gloved fingers upon his j sleeve was all it should be, but the deprecating glance and exclamation were too frank and sisterly. "Are you going away?   Not to be absent long, I hope " "'A week certainly-probably a fortnight." "I shall be very lonely without yon! absolutely lost, in fact! replied Jessie, feeling all she said.

Don't think, however, that it costs me nothing to leave Hamilton while you are in it. I shall carry the image of my docile pupil, my bright-faced, sunny-hearted friend, with me wherever I go. You have been a bealti- fill revelation to me, Jessie. Let me speak, for a mo- ment, out of the sad sincerity of a spirit, wrung as I trust yours will never be. Should we never meet again upon earth, you will not cease to be to me--pshaw! what am, I saying? I talk wildly to you, I doubt not, but there are times of/battle and tempest and desolation in the which incoherence is pardonable. When you are married, you may be sorry for me in a calm, sisterly way, as people on the cliff above the beat of the surf, pity the wretches suffocating in the waves.", "Let me help and comfort you now!" begged Jessie, her tell-tale eyes glistening until Orrin was fain to halt before Mr. Lowndes' monster bouquet in the last room of the suite, and keep her back to the company, while she struggled for composure. It breaks my heart to hear you!-" came at last in a half sob from the trembling lips. Don't talk of breaking hearts, dear!" he returned, smiling sadly. "It is an idle phrase in the mouths of the loved and happy. May you always be both!" He squeezed her hands until she winced with pain, took one lingering look into her eyes that seemed to compel her soul to their surface, whispered, "GOD bless you!"-and before she could move to stay him, he 'was making his conge to Mrs. Baxter. Regardless of the stranger and inquisitive eyes that might be 'upon her, Jessie watched the parting.; the hostess' dramatic start, and fingers joined in hospitable   JESSAXMNE.  1,7 supplication; the toning down of her physiognomny from, tragic consternation, at the announcement of llis con- templated journey, to plaintive resignation, as he declared the fixedness of his purpose; marked the animated pantomime, and felt no inclination to smile that it was over-wrought to extravagance. Assuredly, Orrin's going  at all was a serious discomfort to herself. Taken in connection with his evident unhappiness, his disjointed confessions of grief and trial, that, despite the absurdity f of the imagination, she could not help believing had I some reference to her; finally, her inability to soothe ; or aid him,-these all combined to make the farewell the I saddest-save one-she had ever gone through. "You are weary, my dearest girl!" said Mrs. Baxter,  sympathizingly, twining her arm around her and pulling 2 her down upon the sofa, when she had bidden a widely smiling adieu to all her guests, with the exception of a bald, mild man in spectacles, who was penned in the  angle formed by the chimney and the wall, while tile doctor, planted in fiont of him, held to his argument and his handkerchief at such length that only half the l knots were yet untied.

Jessie and I are quite exhausted by ; -'the excitement of the evening." ?:   Jessie was sorry for hilm as he began, with a rueful visage, to disentangle his cambric and his brains. "I 1 hope you have had a pleasant evening," she said, affectionately, going up to bid him "good-night." His eyes cleared at sound of the frank, sweet voice, and the sight of her face. She had never been shy of him, had 'understood him better and sooner than young girls did generally, and made herself useful to him in many little ways. He caught himself dreaming, some- times, in looking at and listening to her, of what his life and home might have been, if daughters of his own had graced and blessed it. Jessie had taken very kindly, on her part, to the j rustic, eccentric scholar. Roy had made her acquainted with his excellences as well as his peculiarities, and bespoken for him a worthy place in her regard. He talked of "my young friend, Professor Fordham," to her more frequently than he was aware of, won to communicativeness by her deep and evident in- terest in the theme. She had not thoughtit best, up to this time, to reveal her engagement to him or to his talkative spouse, although Roy's last letter had gently advised her to do so, at the first favorable opportunity. The doctor might let slip the morceau of news in one of his fits of abstraction, while "Cousin Jane" would, she was sure, be in a twitter of mysterious importance, and de- :% - sire to announce it formally and publicly.

Jessie blushed deeply, but she did-not laugh or bridle, and her answer was straightforward and unaffected as was the query. "I have been told so, sir!" "Very handsome, but somewhat wilful!" continuing his physiognomical examination. "Undisciplined, too! A warm heart, but hasty judgment.  Loving and lova- ble. A nature powerful for good as for evil. My daughter! when the crisis in your life shall arrive-for there is a turning-point in every human life-hesitate long and pray earnestly that you may be directed into the right path. If you take the wrong, great woe will ensue to yourself and others." Then, with the grave simplicity that sometimes in- vested the quaint little man with dignity at which the most irreverent could not mock, he laid his withered, hand upon her head:  "The LORD bless thee and keep thee; make the light of His countenance to shine upon thee, and give thee peace!" After which he kissed her between the great, solemn eyes, and wished her "sound slumbers and happy dreams." "It seems a ridiculous thing when it is put into words, but it reminded me of the way Roy used to say 'Good- night,'last- summner, at the close of our happiest even- ings I thought Jessie, on, her way^ upstairs, a mist between j   JESSAMTf. .        12E her and the glittering stair-rods. "Oh! I ought to be a good woman!" Too mnuch excited by this little episode, or the other events of the evening, to sleep, Jessie sat down by her chamber-fire, when she had dorined her dressing-gown, and unbound the hair that oppressed her head by its 'weight of braids. She had kept up her Parsonage habit of reading a portion of Scripture before retiring each night, and her Bible lay upon her knee now-but un- opened. She was heavy-hearted, notwithstanding Mrs. Baxter's congratulations and predictions. Was it home-sickness that painted the images of her father and Eunice in the fiery bed of coals filling her grate? that showed her, in the violet-tinted flames quiv- ering above the ignited mass, hief chamber in the manse among the hills; her mothers portrait over the white tent bedstead; her mother's escritoire, between the win- dows, that contained Roy's letters Was she already tired of the life that had been so pleasant four hours ago?

In fact, the day and evening had been so crowded with occupation, recreation, and incident, as to leave her scanty space for letters to Dundee, and oblige her to steal hours from sleep that she might live her enjoyments over in describing them to Rov. She had studied faithfully, too, and successfully under Orrin's direction, and spurred on by his encour- agement. She was sure she could never learn so rapidly and zestfully again. Life seemed such hard and dreary labor. She wished herself back in the quiet Parsonage, where the evening's talk, music, or reading was seldom inter- rupted by neighbors or strangers; where one day went by like every other, within doors; where, on snowy af- ternoons, the ticking of the hall-clock could be heard all through the house-by Patsey in the kitchen; by Mr. l Kirke in his study; by Eunice, sewing in her room overlooking the church-yard; most distinctly by herself as she read, drew, or wrote in her favorite oriel, or, in the twilight, walked up and down the parlor, dreaming visions that put winter and gloom to flight-dreams of Roy's return and their united lives. Wished herself back, if she could be -once inore the girl who had left home six weeks ago. She forgot that latterly she had sickened there in mind and body, under the strain of her grief at Roy's absence, and the pressure of her self- imposed tasks, unrelieved by the diversions needful for a girl of her age aid temperament. That life seenedsuch a safe, wholesome one-simple, pure, pastoral. .It beck- oned her as might a living friend, beloved and trusted. She verily believed, after the fashion of young and ig- norant dreamers, who take to misanthropic reverie at   I             J'SSX MNE.        1.23 the first blast of disappointment, as a- frightened deer-to the water, that she had exhausted the pleasures of exist- ,  ence; had proved the gay world, and found it all " hol- low, hollow, hollow"--the whileshe , a blase cynic, could never return to relishful participation in the innocent joys that had once satisfied her. The, touch of Dr. Baxter's hand was yet warm upon her head; the grave accents of his admonition and bless- ing had scarcely left her ear, but she had no thought that the predicted crisis was upon her; that her feet stood upon the veary point where turning was to be bless- ing or curse. Nod! she was fatigued in body, unsettled in spirits. The eccentric doctor's warning had joined to the reaction succeeding the excitement of the day, to put her out of conceit with her present mode of life-    and Orrin Wyllys was to be out of town for a fort -I night. I    This was the diagnosis she made of her discontent gI  after an hour's melancholy lucubration over the restless tongues of flame, and their scarlet substratum.

Orrin's absence would make her feel this the more-would be an actual trial. For was lie not the oldest and best friend she had in America, outside of Dundee? She had thought much, tenderly, and regretfully, since she had become so de- pendept upon Orrin's kindly offices, of her own dead brother--the day-old baby whom she had never seen; who would, had he lived, have been to her ill .that her brotherly friend was-and more, if that were, pq'sble. She had mourned that little baby always. It is^a' tral   124        JRSSAMZINE. for girls to want an older brother upon whom to lean for protection and guidance. She had not guessed what a comfort and joy suchl would be to her until Roy's adopted brother had, in some degree, supplied this need. She had seen him every day since her arrival in Hamilton, and each interview had strengthened her regard and ad-- miration for him. 'His interest in her studies, her amuse- ments, her health-in all that went to make up the sum of her earthly happiness, was marked and unvarying: A brother in blood -could not lhave been kinder, more thoughtful, in providing whatever could increase her comfort or contribute to her pleasure. She had learned 'to expect his coming on the evenings she spent at home; to watch for glimpses of his figure in a crowd of unfa- miliar forms and faces; to refer doubtful questions to his arbitrament, and appeal to his sympathy in lier moments of sadness and anxiety. In fine, he had gained " what may be called Cupid's best vantage-ground-he had rendered himself necessary to.'her enjoyment and peace of mind. His going made a void in her daily life and in her heart. Although romantic and immature, she was not weak or mawkish. Therefore, she did not repeat-"I never loved a tree or flower," as she ended her musings with a sigh to the memory of the student in foreign lands, and for him to whom she had that night said a tearful "Good-bye." But she remembered both in her prayers. If she- named Orrin with more -earnestness than breathed in her petitions for Roy's welfare, it was because she be- lieved his present need of comfort to be greater.

It was given in honor of a niece of his, who was visiting his daughter, and was to be a grand affair.  Jessie had never attended one half so fine, but she was ennwye'e in anticipation. "There will be the stock company of beaux," she-med- itated.

There will be danc- ing in one parlor, and small-talk in another; promenading in the halls and billiard-room; flirtations in all stages among the oleanders and lemon-trees of the conservatory, and a "jam "-not sweet--in the supper-room.

I would rather spend the evening with Mariala in the moated grange, for that mopish damsel would let me'sit still and sulk if I wanted to. And I believe I do!" "A little more .tire, my love!" whispered. Mrs. Baxter in the dressing-room, affecting to be busy in shaking out Jessie's pink silk drapery. I have a presentiment that you ale to meet your fate to-night. But you must posi- tively exert yourself to seem less quiet and preoccupied. Repose and lqfty indifference are considered well-bred, and are a very safe role for the commonplace to adopt. But they are unbecoming to izs." The novice did her best to throw light into her eves and warmth into her complexion. Being a novice, the attempt was a-failure; but Mrs. Baxter, perceiving that ignorance, not obstinacy, hindered the desired effect, for- bore to hint that, in spite of -Jessie's elegant attire -ld becoming coftflare, she had never seen her look worse. Trusting to the animating influences of the festive scene to restore that which friendly expostulation had proved inefficient to recall, she committed her to the officious homage of young Lowndes, and turned her attention to the part she was herself to play in the evening's drama. "What a magnificent creature your niece is; Mrs. Baxter; or is she a cousill?" said an elderly gentleman -also one of the judge's visitors-to her, at length. The pleased and amiable chaperone looked over her shoulder, directed by his gaze, just in time to see Jessie pass, treading as if on' air; her eyes luminous orbs of rapture; her cheeks like the inner foldings of a damLask rose; her lips apart in a smile, sweet and 'happy, and her hand on Orrin Wyllys! arm.   CHAPTER   IX. 8.:lND you have really been to Dundee!"Jessie rwas saying, unconscious that she was clinging to t r. Wyllys' arm-very slightly, but perceptibly ,  to him,. with the glad hold of one to whom spme- thing dear and rare has been restored. Was this a part of the original plan of your journeyings?" "INo,-but my business led me within sight of .Old Windbeam-(' a frosty pow' his is, just now!)-and it acted upon me as did the Iron Mountain of the Arabian Nights upon the hapless ships that approached it. It drew out the nails of doubt as to the best course for me to pursue; the screws of resolution not to be turned aside by memories of the Past and the allurements of the Present. To be brief--I collapsed utterly! took the afternoon train to Dundee, and passed, in that retreat from briefs and busybodies, the happiest Sabbath I have known since last August." "Euna wrote to me about it-the lovely, precise 0old 6*   JESSAMNE.                : ,: darling! She never indulges in extravagances upon any 3sbject, but her concise sentences meanl much, and these said how she enjoyed the day-and your music. I was envious of her, when I read of it-just for a moment, of course. I have seen so much of you this winter it seemed mean and selfish in me to grudge her one day of like pleasure." "Envy so groundless could not but be evaliescent," said Orrin, with admirable gravity. "But tell me about yourself. What lhave you  been, doing while I was away 8" "Cultivating envy, as I said-and, I am not positive, but wrath and all uacharitableness, as well.

Fourteen featlher-beds! Think of it! To sleep amid the waves of one of the Dutch -abominations is enough to engender dyspepsia, apoplexy, and spleen. But what were the three peas in your bed of roses?" "It has rained four days out of eight, nmy Germany letter was behind time-and I missed my brother-cousin at every turn," responded Jessie bravely, vexed that   anything in the enumeration should make her cheek put on the sudden flame of poppies. Two valid and sufficient reasons for, ennui/ As for the third, and notably the least of all, I thank you for the ' welcome implied by it. I have missed you, Jessie!" "But not as I have you!" was the ingenuous response. "I have been homesick, dismal, disagreeable,-horrid gen- erally. But I spare you the recapitulation. I am very, very happy that you are back again in health, and,"-fal- tering a little,-"- in better; spirits, than when you left us." "Mr. Wyllys!" interrupted a consequential personage a young-old bachelor. "Excuse me, Miss Kirke, but this is business of importance!" He spoke a sentence aside to Orrin, who replied briefly in the same tone. "Mr. Hurst is acting as master of ceremonies to-night, conme d  'ordinaire," observed Wyllys, moving on with his companion. "How will Hamilton parties get on af- ter he dies-or marries I wonder? There has been an addition to the ranks of fashion during my absence, I find. I had hardly finished my bow to Mrs. and Miss Provost, when Warren Provost presented me forcibly to Miss Sanford. I learned, before I went three steps far- ther, that this party is given to Miss Sanford, and now Mr. Hurst tells me that I am expected, presently, to dance with Miss Sanford. Who is Miss Sanford!" 'Jessie comprehending, at once, that he shunned further reference to the state of his spirits at their parting, fol- lowed his lead away from the subject, with alacrity. "Miss Sanford is the, daughter of Judge Provost's sis- ter, and such an heiress An American Miss Burdett}-: Coutts, if half the stories in circulation about her be true.   JESSA MVE.            ,   , She is the only child of a five-millionaire, and has, be- sides, a million in her own right, inherited from her' mother. Poor thing! what a nuisance it must be to be so horribly rich!" commented the country girl who thought herself wealthy with ler mother's wedding- portion of ten thousand dollars, carefully husbanded by hber father against her majority or marriage. "If another woman than Jessie Kirke had said that, I should have supposed she was in jest," said Orrin. I believe you mean what you say. But why? Many and- sweet are the uses of money." "Why do I regard it as a misfortune for a woman to be immensely rich.? Because she can never be sure of true friend or lover. Because she seldom escapes one of two evils, dupedom or misanthropy. It must be almost an impracticable task for a great heiress to satisfy herself, that she is not wooedpoour les beaux yeux de ses cus." "But if there are no other beaux yeux in the case-her own being, we will say, leaden-should she npt congratu- late herself that she has one talisman that will win atten- tion and regard?" - "Regard!" echoed Jessie, incredulously. "And why not? She typifies bank stock, real estate, ready money, to the adorer of these. iHe worships them?, it is true, but through her, as discriminating Romanists try to make us believe that they adore the Virgin Mary by the help of her imnages." "And as Dr. Baxter told me, the other day, Aaron and his crew of apostate ingrates bowed down to the-molten calf- as the representative of the Egyptian Apis," putJn Jessie sarcastically. "If a woman can content herself with that sort of worship, put herself on a par with the goose that   laid the golden egg, she wants neither affection nor ' 'pity .  "Yet ll warrant that the famous goose preened hIer- self alongside of the most-gorgeous peacock in the barn- yard; accounted herself the equal, of the stateliest swans. There are as many purse-proud women as menp Million- naires of both sexes do not scorn the court! 'id to their money through themselves. On the contrary, they would be piqued and offended if their dollars were not:duly ap- preciated. Novels aind sentimentalists tell us that the unhappy possessors "of princely fortunes desire to be loved and sought for their intrinsic virtues, whereas the great mass-especially of women--who are wedded for their riches, are quite alive to the truth that this is so, and are far from being wounded thereby. They are neither, dupes nor misanthropes, but sensible practical bodies who regard their property as a part of themselves-soul of their soul-and unhesitatingly appropriate all the advan- tages it buys, pluming themselves, as a rule, upon their ability to command service and fidelity. You shake your head? Let me illustrate from real life. I was talking, some time ago, with a married lady whom nobody had ever, in my hearing, called weak-minded, even behind her back. I had known her for many years, andshe opened up her mind to me freely, with regard to her courtship by, and marriage to, the man of her choice. ' I feared, at one time, that I had lost him forever,' she said. 'He was quite assiduous in his attention to another young lady who was pretty, elegant, and accomplished. I was very unhappy, for he had never declared his intentions to ine. But she had not money enough to suit his notions of theo-: fitness of things,-I quote literally. ' So he came back !    134         JELSSlAMNE. to me. ,%Vasn't I thanlkful then that my dear father had provided for me handsomely and thus secured my lhappi- ness for life? n" "A clever anecdote-considering it is impromptu!" said wilful Jessie, with al air of superb disbelief. "If I could credit it, and you--" "You would cease to commiserate heiresses!" finished Wyllys. ' For myself, I have an antipathy to the whole class. All whom I have had the misery of knowing were sordid, self-conceited, and rapacious of admiration to a degree that passed understanding and disgust." He dropped his voice, for the crowd immediately about them had grown still and attentive. Miss Sanford was going to sing. Jessie and her escort chanced to be near the piano, and had a fine view of her as she was led to the instrument by an ambitious senior, whom she loaded down with her bouquet, gloves, fan, handkerchief, and gold vinaigrette. Shle was probably about twenty-five years of age, but this was a difikult point to determine from her appearance; her hair, eye- brows, and complexion being so light, that, as Jessie afterwards said to Mrs. Baxter, she looked as if she might have lain for forty-eight hours in a bath of caustic soda and water-the preliminary process in the preparation of the phantom bouquets the President's lady was skilled in arranging. Miss Sanford was thin and bony. "Scrag- gy," one would have termed her, had she belonged'to the so-called inferior animals. Her eyes were a pale, fixed blue, like those of a china doll; her'lips met scantily over teeth that were unpleasantly prominent; she had a re- ceding chin, a sharp nose, and a lowforehead. A homely; shrewish-looking girl to the muinstructed eye. Yet her P- ..  .       . . C   JESSAMNE...        135 air showed that she was accustomed to receive court from the sophisticated multitude, the many wlio were awake to the fact that sle was the undoubted mistress of clharms not to be adequately expressed by less than seven figures. EHer dress was a walking advertisement of her pretensions to this intelligent homage, being mauve satin, flounced with point lace. It was cut too low upon the flat chest and prominent shoulder-blades, but the region thus left i bare was made interesting to feminine eyes by a magnifi- cent diamond. necklace. Bracelets to matchi loaded her meagre wrists, and were pushed up ostentatiously before she put her'iingers upon the key-board, with a coquettish gimace at her cavalier. "I don't sing ballads," Jessie and Orrin heard her say)  tossing her head one-sidedly-a frequent trick with her, since it set her ear-rings to dancing until the precious stones seemed to emit sparks of real fire. ' Ballad music is considered so low in refined circles. I have never cul- tivated any but the classical style-operas, you know, bravnras and arias, and all that, you know. Let me treat you to my favorite- just the sweetest thing you ever heard, from La Traviata. I perfectly dote upon it!" She played a thumping prelude and accompaniment in villainous time; her voice was. shallow- and shrill; she made audacious dashes at trills and cadenzas, her feeble pipe breaking down upon the ascendihg, and breakling up upon the descending scale. A more- lamentable and wit- less travestie of operatic execution could hardlTy have been conceived of. The Italian words were made a thing of no account whatever, H" er resources are wonderful," said Orrin, uaecdver   of the buzz of compliments and thanks qthe;at'4:, t hee '   136         JESSAMNE. solng.; "When she forgot what came next she, substituted -something of her own composition--in the Kaffir dialect, I think-with a readiness and coolness tlruly astounding. Honor bright, now," laughing down mischievously into his companion's eyes-" what has this little scene remind- ed yoti of-something you have hitherto viewed as a cari- cature . " ' I won't tell you!  But Jessie's face was alive with fun. It might not be -it certainly was not altogether kind or well-bred in her to join in ridiculing the host's niece, but it was " only Or- rin," and so long as his comnments were for her ear aloie, 1no harm was done. "You need not! Miss Swartz lhas arisen above schll low style' as ' Blue-eyed Mary and ' That Air from thle Cabinet,' but she can still ' sing Fluvy du Tajy if she had the words.' Indeed, being bent upon fascination, she sings it, words or no." He had found Jessie and Mrs..Baxter deep in "Vanity Fair" one evening, had taken the book and read aloiud several chapters, including "The quarrel about an heiress." ".Yet you will not let me say ' Poor Miss Swartz!'"! said Jessie. "Certainly not. She is in Paradise. Reserve your pity for me, who am doomed to ask her to waltz so soon as this part of the exhibition is over. Hark! another sweet selection! This time from  Der Freischitz-- Agatha's, prayer, done into boarding-school German patois, varied .by the amazing improvisations aforesaid. For Heaven's sake! come away into the conservatory. Even 'when music, heavenly maid, was very young, a baby in the cradle, she never squalled like that!    JESSAMNE.         137 Jessie could not help laughing at his whimsical impa- tience. Mirth came easily to-night. The surprise and joy of her friend's return had exhilarated her. The very freedom of his comments upon others made her feel the entireness of their mutual confidence. His- talking to her in this strain was a direct compliment to her discretion. It was delightful to see him gay once more-to believe that his light rattle was the overflow of a heart as full and happy as her own. He lingered with her in the conservatory until the in- defatigable Mr. Htrst came to hunt him up. a You will let me take you in to supper?" said Wyllys, pulling himself up with graceful unwillingness from the fantastic root seat beside the fountain. "Where shall I find you, if I survive the next half hour " "Here'!? glancing up brightly. , It is cool and quiet, and my feet ache with standing. Don't send anybody to me, please! I shall sit here, and rest and think-ponder seriously upon the miseries of the rich, the compensations of the poor." Orrin had chosen their resting-place in the leafy boudoir with his habitual sagacity, having an eye both to ease and the semi-privacy which confidential friends find so enjoyable in the neighborhood of a crowd. An osier frame overrun with ivy, screened Jessie on tie left from any save very prying eyes; -a barricade of lemon and orange trees towered at the back; in front, the fountain, showering fropt peak and sides of a rock-work pyramid, cast a shimmering veil between her and the archway, closing up a vista of vines and shrubs, through which issued music and the hum of many voices with the rhyth- mical beat of feet. Jessie listened to the merry din, tli .   g138         JESSAMNE. nearer dash of the-glittering drops into the basin at her feet; and inhaling the perfume of the exotics behind her, smiled a happy little smile in remembrance of her scorn- ful weariness in predicting the flirtations among the oleanders and lemon-trees. She had no prevision then that she should sit here with one chosen companion, talk- ing freely and gladly of all that was in her heart ; none of the gentle and lovely reverie to which he had left her. From a great globe of ground glass overhead, effulgence like that of a midsummer moon streamed down upon the falling water; the trailing grasses and clinging mosses upon the stones were threaded with tiny brilliants; the broad wet leaves of the aquatic plants overhanging and growing within the marble reservoir were washed with silver. A single lily arose, pure and proud, from a clump of luxuriant flags. Tall ferns standing motionless on the thither margin, made a miniature brake of an alley that stretched away into cool green dimness. A bed of musk- plant yielded up languorous sighs to the warmed air. -All that was sensuous in temperament and artistic in taste made response to the influence of the place and hour. Jessie gave herself up to it without resistance, laid her head against the tortuous scroll-work of the high back of the settee, and dreamed. The evening had been trium- phant, intoxicating to her. The evening she would have preferred to spend with dolorous Mariana! She whispered the familiar lines to herself: "'All day, within the dreamy house, The doors upon their hinges creaked; The blue fly sung i' the panie ; the mouse Behind the mouldering wainscot shrieked, Or from the crevice peered about,-'   JESSAMNE.     -    13 ZBut that was nothing! I dare say the Grange  was a commodious, respectable family mansion; that it would have been as beautifull as the Alhambra to the poor girl, had the faithless lover kept hs tryst. ' Hle cometh not," she said!'  That was the key to the desolation without and 'within. I had not believed that I could be so glad to } see any one except Roy, as I am to meet Orrin again. He has a look like his cousin sometimes. I never noticed it before as I have to-night';-a look that gives me a sense of safety and companionship when with him, which makes sadness and homesickness impossibilities. It is good to have a friend upon whom I can lean my whole weight without fear of causing weariness-in whose society I can be frankly, fearlessly, joyously, myself!" There were but two or three couples in the conserva- tory besides herself, and they, too, seemed to be lulled into silent musing by the subdued lights and odorous airs of the fairylike haunt. Perhaps some of the dancers found fault with the draught from the archway, for Jessie saw Warren Provost and Mr'. Hurst let down the damalsk curtains which had been looped back from it. She drew a deeper breath of content in the feeling of increased seclu- sion. Now that the music, the babble of human tongues, and the tramp of a hundred waltzers were muffled, a mocking-bird from his concealed cage in an acacia tree began to sing. First came a chirp of alarm as if he had just awakened from dreams of tropical skies and mag- nolia groves-then'a trial trill, a gush of liquid melody, clear and soft as the ripple of a mountain rivulet. /Next, he whistled, still softly, but with marvellous, correctness and sweetness, a flute waltz Jessie had heard Omrin.   "O         JESSAMNE. Wyllys play last summer. She smiiled and murmured in her trance,-- "Everything associated with him is pure pleasure!"  Nobody could be moody or dull when he chose to please and interest. To her, his coming was like the spreading of the sun rays down the mountain sides and through the' valley on summer mornings, steeping the commonplace in beauty; making of native loveliness a witching miracle. Dear, dear Roy! She owed this great happiness also to him. He had reckoned wisely and lovingly in commit- ting her to the care of this guardian. The band struck up a march. The blare of the instru- ments burst unwelcomely upon her rosy dreams. She aroused herself with a start to see the curtains pulled back. The mocking-bird ceased his song abruptly. The waltzers, panting and flushed, thronged the narrow aisles of the conservatory; chattered'and flitted among the foliage like brighlt-plumaged, loud-voiced parrots. Miss Sanford was conspico us among them, leaning palpably upon her es-cort's arm. Her affected laugh grated unpleasantly upon Jessie's ears, every few seconds.: She was in exuberant spirits; in high good-humor with herself, and, presumably, with her partner. "Oh! that darling beauty of a lily!" she cried, push- ing roughly past the ivied screen, to get a closer view of the proud, pale princess of the fountain. "I wanted you should see it! FannyProvost, my cousin, goes just crazy over it. It was brought to her all the way from the Nile bl'the Ganges, or the Amazon, or some other of, those stupid rivers in Europe, whose naines I always forget--by her' beau.

Don't you think so? I do think an engagement must be just the cunning- est, sweetest thing in the world!" "That depends, in a great measure, upon who the high contracting parties are, I suppose," replied Orrin, with the slightest imaginable glance in the direction of the con- cealed spectator, but one in which she read a drollery of appeal that wrought irresistibly upon her risibles. Miss Sanford tittered. "I declare I am afraid of you, Mr. Wyllys! Youiare so sarcastic! Of course, that was what I meant. One takes that for granted always. lBut it mnst be just too sweet for two people who are devoted to one another, and who are of suitable ages and prospects, and all that, you know, to promise that they will just perfectly adore one another, till death, you know. At least, that is the way Ilook at it. I am so womanly, Mr. Wyllys! I often tremble at the thou ght of buffeting the world. Everybody is so absorbed in their own self in- terests.

That is the way with 'all you gentlemen-isn't it, Mr. Wyllys?" staring boldly- she fancied engagingly-up at him. "You would have us owe everything to you. Bless me! can that be supper?

"I protest he ought to be the deserted one, in punish- ment for his tardiness!" regaining her hold of Mr. Wyl-  lys' elbow, and making a resentful moue at the derelict gallant. "I have half a mind to go off with you and leave him to solitary regrets. Suppose, if I trust myself to him, my barque should be shipwrecked on the journey?" It was an awkward moment. The heiress' look and action plainly testified that herswas no " half mind" to commit herself to the: pilotage of the man who had not. invited such a display 6i.'confidence. Wyllys extricated himnself promptly and c'editably, and as if her proposal were entirely decorous and ladylike. He had too much sense and tact ever to patronize one of his own sex, and owed much of his popularity to the air of respectful bon- hommie with wlhich he now turned to the perspiring and rebuked Romond't. "Do not try fallible humanity beyond endurance, Miss Sanford! It is hard to be just a-nd magnanimous in the face'of such a temptation, but right is right. Mr. Ro- mondt! grant me the honor of becoming your security for the safe and pleasant transfer of la reine du bal to the supper-room.                 ' Jessie was quivering with merriment in ilersheltered nook.  "I have been in mortal terror lest I should not be launched at all, but be left high and hungry upon the stocks!" she cried gayly, at her attendant's approach. "And supper is one of the substantial blessings of life, when one has a good'appetite." %           - Orrin feigned to wipe the dews of exhaustion from his brow with a despairing flourish of his handkerchief.   "4         JESSAMNE.

CHAPTER X. K UDGE  PROVOST, whose wife and    daughters , were the leaders of fashion in Hamilton, was him- self a social Greatheart. Having brought to bear upon various vexed domestic problems the force of his astute mind and enlightened Christianity, he had arrived at a series of conclusions equally credita- ble to both. The pertinence of his deductions was so ,obvious to the impartial reasoner as to excite his surprise, that the great body of good and sensible men and women did not adopt and practise them. For example, he main- tained first, that the best way to keep men out of jails, was to provide thern with abodes so comfortable that they would prefer these to stone cells and prison fare: sec- :^ s- ondly, as a modification of the same principle, that, since amusements are necessary to the happiness of the young, they should be provided with lawful diversions in their O own homes, lest they should seek unlawful abroa;  . ,   thirdly, in unconscious plagiarism of the wise and genial H) "  7       .     *   ;  "*-"- '-:"n:   "6         JESSAAirT..- author of "Annals of a Country Neighborhood " he held and believed for certain, thlt the surest way to make an indifferent thing bad, was for good people to hold them- selves aloof from doing it. Acting upon thAse principles, the eminent jurist built a bowling-alley at the back of his garden; caused hs eight children to be instructed in music and dancing, and encouraged them to pursue these recreations in his par- lors,-where, also, lay backgammon and chess board in full sight. Finally, he crowined their gratification while. he drew upon himself the reprobation of the zealots and puritans among his neighbors, by throwing a wing out from his already spacious residence, expressly for a billiard-room. It was a pretty place, and a cheerful, with its green carpets and lounges, tinted walls, and long 'French windows, and was, as may be supposed, a popular resort with those of the college students who had the entree, as well as with the young .Provosts and their friends of both sexes in the town. A happy, hospitable set were the young Provosts-the four sisters and four brothers-affectionate to one another, dutiful and loving to the parents to whose judicious affection they owed their sunny childhood and youth. J essie liked them, better than she did any other family in Hi'amilton, while Fanny, the second daughter, had taken a fancy to her at first sight, which was ripening into a' cordial friend-. ship. The billiard-room was very bright with afternoon sunshine and merry with the chatter of gay voices, one day late in February, when a party of six or eight girls was collected about the table--four playing, the others looking on pa nd talking, sometimes of the game in   JE1SAMMNE.        147 progress, sometimes upon other subjects-all in a. familiar yet ladylike way. "Somebody mark for me, please!" said a ruddy- cheeked danmsel who had never, by any chance, won a game, and whose principal points were the point she made of missing every shot. "If I should hit anything it would be a pity not to get credit for it. Now--all of you look and learn I " She poised the cue with a superabundance of caution, pursing up her lips into an O, as she took aim; dashed at the white ball nearest her, which flew frantically from side to side of the board, rebounding twice from the cushion, and, at last, popping into a distant -pocket, having dodged every other ball with a malicious 'in- genuity eminently illustrative of the proverbial perversity of inanimate things. "Better luck next time!" said the player, invincibly good-humored, resigning her place. , "If there is any- thing in perseverance and hope, I shall do it yet, some day, and astonish you all." - The others laughed-withl, rather than at her-and Jessie Kirke took the stand she had vacated. All leaned forward to watch her -play, her skill being already an established fact. A touch-not a thrust--to the white ball sent it against a red at such an angle that in the rebound it hit another quite at the other end of the green table, which latter rolled into a pocket. This,to the uninitiated, meaningless process, being repeated by her, with trifling variations, until she had made sixteen points, waa i^d- ered a feat among the embryo billiardisl, surround r.

"So much for having a good teacher!" said another, less complimentary. "If ZIr. Wyllys would bestow as much care upon our tuition as he has upon heirs, we might be adepts, too." "She has practised ten times as much with me as she has with him,' answered Fanny, pleasantly. ' So, I am entitled to the larger share of the praise for her pro- ficiency. I will not be cheated of mny laulrels." "Is Mr. Wyllys, then, your best plaver?" The querist was Miss Sanfolrd, who "did not care about billiards," and had even remonstrated, at the begin- ning of her visit with her cousin Fanny, with regard to lher liking for the game-ci such a queer one for ladies I She would be afraid to touch a cue for fear she might be called strong-minded." She had discovered, furthermore, that her wrists were not stout enough to bear the weight of a cue steadily, and took pleasure in publishing their genteel fragility. Only that afternoon she had called at- tention to this by an exclamation addressed to Jessie, as she drew up her cuffs in order to be ready for her turn. "Dear me! Miss 1irke! what wouldn't I give to be as robust as you are! Look at her alrms! Thley would make six of mine. What do you do to develop your muscles so?' Jessie smiled in quiet satisfaction with her own beau- tifully moulded wrists. "I am healthy, and I lead an active life," she said, laconically, but politely. Miss Sanford was not pleased either with smile or words, but there was apparently notlhing to resent, and she returned to her pofa. She had attended a party the even-   JESSAX7ME.'        149 ing before, and was to-day " utterly worn out." Whle the game went on, she toyed with her rings, slipped her bracelets of dead gold and pealrls up and down her thin armns, and now and then yawned behind her hand. Mr. Wyllys' name awoke her from the apathetic dron- ing.  , "Decidedly!" replied a looker-on, Selina Bradley by name-a kind-hearted, talkative and indiscreet girl whom everybody liked, yet of whose tripping tongue manv were afraid. "Decidedly the best in town. Don't you think so, Fan?" "There are not many who can eaual him among our finest billiard players," said Fanny. "I do not believe he has lost a game since Mr. Fordham went away. He played splendidly! His nerves were steady and his judgment nice." "Fordham!" repeated the heiress, quickly. "What was his first name? W Vho is he?" " oy-and he is a professor in our college. He is now in Heidelberg, Germany. Do you know him " said Fanny, in surprise. "You must have heard us speak of him before." "Never! I used to -know him," rejoined Miss San- ford, tossing her head. "He was engaged to a very dear friend of mine. No I I didn't know he was in Germany. I am glad of it!"  I  Selina, breathless with excitement,- did not catch the meaning of the latter sentences. 'Engaged! I thought he was love-proof! Fannyl I Nettie! Sue! do you hear this? Who do you guess is engaged to be married? No less a personage than our invulnerable Professor Fordham" -        "   150   -     JESSA MrYNE. The girls crowded about Miss Sanford, forgetting the game in the superior attractions of a love-story. "To whom?" "Who told you . " "I don't believe it!V" were the divers comments upon the intelligence. Jessie remained alone at the table, tapping the cushion opposite her with her cue, her face flaming with indignant confusion. Taken utterly by surprise, she could not at once rally to reply to the false statement she had heard, or govern her countenance well enough to seem indiffer- ent. The heiress bridled at the last remark, setting back her head in a fashion she conceived was regal, whereas it was merely ungracefully scornful. "You are not asked to believe it, Miss Barnes! I said distinctly that the gentleman was formerly betrothed to my friend. I am happy, on her account, to be able to state that the (to her) unfortunate engagement was broken almnost- a year since." "What do you mean?  Iow did it happen? And to think we never heard a breath of it! Go on! there's a darling! and tell us all about it!" entreated Selinaj sink- ing to the carpet at the feet of the in nowise reluctant newsmonger. "Perhaps you had rather not, Hester," suggested gen- ' tie Fanny to her cousin. "Such stories are painful to those interested in either, of the parties to the engagement, and the telling does no good to any one. The fewer people that hear of them the better, it seems to me.," "Oh I I don't mind it in the least now!"Hester has- tened to re-assure her. She settled the voluminous skirt   -JESSATE.    -151 of her purple cashmere peignoir about her; disposed her rings upon her fingers, and her fingers upon her lap to her liking; sighed profoundly, and looked smirkingly sen- timental. is There was a time when I could not allude to it, or even think of it, without tears. My disposition is so sympatheticl But time deadens all griefs, and my poor friend acknowledges herself that it was best the affair should have terminated as it did. She met Mr.. Fordham at the seashore summer before last-was with him there for a week or so. It was long enough for him to fall violently in love with her. He couldn't help being taken by her appearance, for she is just perfectly lovely I a blonde, with blue eyes, and a red rose-bud of a mouth, and golden hair, and the sweetest smile!" "She must be a real beauty!" sighed Selina, in an ecs- tacy of admiration. "She is. People pretend to see a resemblance between us. I have actually been mistaken for her more than once-but that is all nonsense," said Hester, modestly. "I should be just too happy if I were half as handsome as Maria. But I love her too dearly to be envious. We are like twin sisters in heart. I dare say that is the rea- son we are called so much alike. We-go out so much to- gether, you see, that the sight of one reminds people of the other, you know. But as I was saying, this Mr. Ford- ham pretended to be smitten with her, land, early in the winter, visited her at her own home. Her parents liked him exceedingly. He is rather an imposing man, you know, and has some reputation as a scholar. So, when he paid a second ivisit at Christmas, and offered himself, there was no objection raised to the match.

And why, do you suppose?'- He had heard that one of her sisters had died of consumption several years before he knew her, and he 'could not be  hampered by a sickly wife!'" She waited until the chorus of reprobation subsided, then resumed: "He wrote to lier. Iron man as he was, he was afraid to trust himself in her presence. He ' regretted the ne- cessity that forced him to this unpleasant step,' he said, 'but he owed a duty to himself which was not to be lightly put aside. He should always remain her friend,' and all that sort of rubbish, you know. The broken- hearted creature stooped to argue with him. She loved him devotedly, and she had had no other love. If 1 had been in her place, I would have died sooner than let him know how I suffered; but she was such a lamb-like, gen- tle "creature! and. her spirit was utterly crushed. She wrote to hinm,imploring him not to leave her, representing that there was not a sign of hereditary consumption in the family; that her parents were living, and that her grand- parents on both -sides had all died from other diseases. But he was-obstinate. He 'would never,' he replied,'in any circumstances, marry a woman who was not, ill his opinion, perfectly sound in mind and body, or who had ! any predisposition to scrofula, consumption, or insanity.' ': He pretended to believe still that she had the seeds of a fatal malady in her system, and went so far as to allude to her beautiful color--just the sweetest pink and white you ever saw!--as a hectic flush. '/at'as the history of Mr. Roy Fordham's love-scrape!  "And did she break a blood-vessel, or go into a de-   JrES8ASTNE.        153 cline?" asked Sue Barnes, her round face ludicrously elongated, while her eyelids twinkled away a sympathiz- ing tear. "Well-no!"  Miss Sanford hesitated, then made the admission unwillingly, evidently appreciating the damiage her mournful recital must sustain through the want of this orthodox sequel. "But she was in a sad way for awhile. Her family kept the miserable affair as quiet as possible for her sake. The truth was communi- cated to nobody except a few very intimate and dearest friends. But you can't wonder that I have hated the sound of Professor Fordham's name ever since." "Very natural, I am sure!" murmured the plastic Sule. Hester made a parade of wiping her eyes with a lace handkerchief. "Not that I ever liked him. Poor Maria brought him around to our house, one evening, on purpose to have me see him. And the next morning she was in, bright and early, to ask what I thought of him. 'I don't fancy him in the least, my dear child,' I said to her, candidly. 'tHe has a cold, severe eye, and a stubborn mouth. He is quiet in manner because he is unfeeling. If you marry him, he will rule you with a rod of -steel, and make your life a burden.' It was a trial to say it, but I knew it was my duty, and I didn't turn back, you know. She cried her eyes out over what she said was my un- kindness, and left me in a tremendous huff. She would neither speak to me, nor hear my name mentioned in her presence, until the rupture came. Then she sent right away for me, and fell upon my neck, begging my pardon. 'If I had been as clear-sighted as you, Hester, what 7* -         sC   154        JESSAMXE. wretchedness I would have been spared I' she sobbed. I am very acute in my perception of character. My grandmother, Mrs. General Deane--my mother's mother -said to her dying day that my skill in seeing through people especially sheep in wolves' clothing-I mean wolves in sheep's clothing-was--well! the most aston- ishing thing she had ever seen." Jessie was knocking the balls to and fro, in reckless disregard of the laws controlling the game, but the sharp click of the ivory spheres did not distract general atten- tion from Miss Sanford. "I never was more amazed in all my, born days!" said Selina, conscientiously reserved with respect to her pre-natal experience. "Mr. Fordham is so pleasant, yet so dignified, and ranks so high in the Faculty and the church, and has so much influence among the students! Who could ever have thought of his behaving in such an inhuman and ungentlemanly manner?" "Why, people in Hamilton--everybody-out of the college as well as in, consider him a piece of perfection " added Sue. "He is a detestable snake in the grass, then I " es- ter said, vehemently, her energy so. disproportionate to the occasion, that doubts would have arisen, in an un- biassed mind, of her own belief in the affecting narration she had glibly poured forth. "Take care, dear I " cautioned Fanny. "There may be extenuating circumstances of which we are ignorant. Mr. Fordham's character as a gentleman and a Christian is not to be lightly disputed. Every question has two sides, papa says, and those are wisest who suspend judg- --ment until both are heard. I am morally certain there   JESSAMNE.         155 is some mistake about all this, which Mr. Fordham could clear up, if he were here." Tlhe heiress sniffed haughtily, and her light skin was dappled with fiery red spots to the roots of her hair; her faint eyebrows met in a viragoish frown. "I thank you for the inference, Miss Provost! Would I repeat a story unless I was sure-' morally certain,' as you say, that it was true in every particular? If you question my veracity, you can ask dozens of her ac- quaintances in her native place, who will confirm my statement. And you may be thankful if you don't, at the same time, hear some other ugly facts about your Christian gentleman, that I have chosen to omit. If I have a fault, it is that I am too charitable in my judg- ment of human nature. I am perpetually being imposed upon." The cue that had been- stationary while Fanny put in her plea for mercy to the absent perjurer, was restless again, red balls and white chasing one another aimlessly across the green cloth. "To tell the truth," said Nettie Fry, another of the listening group, propitiatory of the mistress of a million in her own right,-"I never admired Mr. Fordham so much as many pretend to do. He was always so cool and lofty--so unapproachable and unlike other young men of his age. And as Miss Sanford says, he looked as8if he might, when married, grow into a kind ofBluebeard." "For my part, I thought him grand and good" con- fessed Selina. "And I liked him a hundred times bet- ter than I did the modern young gentleman, with his flattering speeches and unmeaning attentions. I didn't think he could trifle with a woman's affections.; ': aA. i                        . *   156         JESSAMJNE. dreadfully disappointed! I wonder if Mr. Wyllys knows anything about this shocking business!" "Of course he doesn't! I ow should he? ' retorted Hester, tartly. "( There are not three people besides my- self, even in our city, who ever heard of it." You said ' dozens,' just now, Hester!" ventured merciful Fanny, in gentle rebuke. Selina averted the burst of anger portended by the darkening visage of the moneyed belle. "1 thought Mr. Wyllys would be more likely to hear Mr. Fordham's side of the story than anybody else," she said, timidly. "You know they are own cousins." "'You doni't say so!" ejaculated Hester, horrified; and by a simultaneous conviction of their illdiscretion, the entire party was moved to glance at Jessie. She appreciated the extreme awkwardness of the pause; felt that their eyes were directed, like so many burning-glasses, to a focus that was herself, and me- chanically went on playing with her cue and balls. ' Only Fanny Provost was in a position from whichi she could see that while her features were steady, and her -eyes seemed to follow the red and white spheroids in their windings and doublings, one swollen vein in her throat was beating like a clock, and the nails were bloodless where they pressed upon the cue. "Come! we must finish our- game!" said the young hostess, going back to the table. "Jessie has been per- fecting her skill by a bit of private practice, while we were making havoc of our neighbors' characters." At heart she was exceedingly displeased with the tale- -bearer, but the courtesy of hospitality forbade her more emphatic expression of disapproval.   JESSAMNE.         157 Jessie threw down the slender rod, and tried, very un- successfully, to laugh. "I have done nothing except spoll your game for you. I thought you'had found an occupation so far preferable that you would not care to go on with this. I give up my cue and my place. You must choose other partners and commence anew. I have forgotten how the balls were set up when we stopped to listell to lMiss Sanford's thrilling romance. I must go now, Fanny. My time is up!" -. Bowing a general "Good afternoon,o she made lier way to the library where she had left her hat and cloak. Fanny accompanied her. "You will join us again this evening, I hope," she said, kindly. "Mr. Wyllys is to give us some music. Hester has never heard him sing. By a som'ewhat strange series of mischances, she has never happened to be present when he gave the rest of us this pleasure. She cannot endure contradiction, as yon see; so when she insisted I should ask him for to-night, I complied. I am- often thankful,     Jessie, that I am not an only child, when I see how rest- less and irritable so much notice and petting lias made her. It is a downright misfortune to be so wealthy as she is. Everything and everybody conspires to spoil her. She is more to be pitied than blamed, poor girl!" Jessie said nothing in rejoinder to this ingenious apol- ogy for her cousin's ill-natured tattling, and Fanny was obliged to proceed directly to the point. "I am sorry if you are leaving thus early on account of anything Hester has said," she continued, genuine concern depicted in her countenance-" sorry if the :slur cast by the idle talk of a party of thoughtless, giri:nt:   158        'JESSAMNE. the character of your-of our friend, Mr. Wyllys9 cousin -has wounded or dipleased you. Hester does not mean to exaggerate or misrepresent, but she has a wild, careless fashion of talking sometimes. I am convinced that thelre is some great mistake in the story we have heard. In details and in general bearing, it is not in keeping with Mr. Fordham's well-established character. If you knew him, you would agree with me in discrediting it, in tote." "I do know him, and I quite agree with you I " Jessie was tyving on her-hat, and the action mighllt have caused the slight quaver and weakness in herl voice. It was firmer when she spoke again. Fanny, in consterna- tion at the unexpected disclosure, and the manner which said that more was behind the mere statement, could not summon words for reply. Mr. Wyllys' cousin "-with unconscious emphasis, Fanny imagined was disdainful-"is not a stranger to mne. I have known him a long time. But say nothing to your friends about the acquaintanceship. They might fear they had offended me by their strictures. I will-I may tell you more some other time. You will compre- hend then why certain things which were said just now, have excited me more than I care to show. You are al- ways just and tender-hearted, and I thank you for speak- t ing when I could not. Good-by!" Her lips were set and hard to Fanny's soft kiss, and her eyes glowed dangerously as the latter attended her to the front door. The peace-maker, noting this, refrained from further endeavors to heal the breach between her relative and her new friend. Hester had been shockingly, shame- fully imprudent, even if what she stated were true. Jessie was hurt and angry, and she had a right to be. Yet she,   JESSAMME.         I JEXXAMN 159 Fanny, dared not advance another step without a more 'distinct understanding of the case.. For the present it  was beyond hler art. She tried to content herself by a cordial invitation to "ran in to-morrow forenoon for a quiet billiard-practice-only you and myself-if you do not thinly better of your refusal to come to-night," and let her visitor go. ,f t    CHAPTER XI. e"REATLY perturbed, Fanny returned to the circle of gossips. They had not recommenced their game, but were standing about, and leaning. upon the billiard-table, busily rehearsing the late scene, accentuating their animated periods by tapping the floor with the cues, and rapping the board with the ivory balls. All except Hester, who sat still upon her lounge, twirled her rings, and looked sulky. Selina was foremost and loudest in apologetic exclama- tions-being as candid in regret as she had been in cen- sure. "Do you know I never thought of his being a relation '/ d of Mr. Wyllys until just as I spoke of it? That is like my blundering tongue I There is no half-way house of meditation between the brain and it. We are ruined I you and I especially, Nettie, and Sue is almost as badly off.

"If the man is away off in Germany, he can't quarrel with yol." But he is coming back next Fall I should sink into the earth if he were to ask me any questions about what I have said. Hle has always been so gentle and pleasant with -me! I felt quite. proud of his good opinion." "You had very little to be proud of, I should say!  retorted Miss Sanford, losing command of her tongue and temper entirely, as the discussion proceeded. "Thank Heaven! I am not dependent upon such contemptible trifles for my peace of mind! I wouldn't recognize Boy Fordllam on the street, or anywhere else; would cut him dead were he to enter this room at' this very minute. As for Miss IKirke, I care less than nothing for her, or her opinion. If she chooses to play the spy upon a con- fidential conversation between ladies, and carry tales to gentlemen, she may, and welcome. I never could abide her from the first instant I ever saw her. I do hate tattlers and backbiters! But let her do her worst! I flatter myself that I, at least, am above her reach!" "I should be very uneasy and unhappy, if. I believed that the substance of our conversation would ever reach Mr. Fordham's ears," rejoined Fanny, very gravely "But Mr. MWyllys is no mischief-maler. Nor, for that matter, is Jessie Kirke. iMy- principal regret is that we have wounded her; for I do not think a reputation so nobly earned as Mr. Fordham's' has been, will suffer from our idle chatter. It' is founded upon a rock. As to Jessie's playing the spy, Hester, she had no reason to believe the communication you made was confidential." "She hneaer opened her lips while I was talkiig! just :j ,G ,.   r       .,   162         JESSAI sfood off there, pretending to be busy with the billiard balls, and listened,' said Hester, hotly, - "If that wasn't mean and dishonorable, I don't know what is!" "I am inclined to think it would have been well had the rest of us done likewise I " smiled Fanny, willing to give a jocose turn to the circumstance. "Since we cannot help our blunder, we will try to forget it." But Hester had a troublesome bee in her bonnet. She looked more and more discomposed. "What makes you all think that this Kirke girl will blab to Mr. Wyllys? What has she to do with him, more than any of you here?" What's he to Hecuba, or Hecuba to him!" quoted Fanny, theatrically, bent upon covering her cousin's coarseness of speech and manner. "They are old friends, and lie is intimate at Dr. Baxter's, where she is staying. As I said, however, the least of my apprehensions is that she will stir up strife between us and Mr. Fordham." She chalked her cue carefully, as if it were her chief concern at present. ; "Is he addressing her?" demanded Hester, with in- creasing interest. "I don't know. Selina! will you play on my side?" "In a minute!"The volatile Bradley was off at a tangent. I don't begin to believe that he means to offer himself to her, whatever wiseacres may say. It is well known that he is not a marrying man. tHe brings out girls that have the making of belles in them. It is a sort of hobby with him-a mission he has. This done, he stands back serenely, and lets other men marry them. He is a universal lover of the sex, and. upon occasions like those I have named--a benefactor. Soine of our   I   JESAMTNE.          163    most elegant matrons and handsomest young ladies were his protegges. His sanction of their charms made them the fashion. It is odd, but true." Hester smiled, laid her head on her left shoulder, and peeped at an opposite mirror. - ;    ," It would be a sin were you Hamilton girls to let him ti :  marry this girl. You don't half appreciate him. I have met so many distinguished and gallant men, that I call ?   myself a tolerable judge of true breeding and polished manners. And I can inform you that in a large, gay city such as that I live in, he would be a star! might have almost any girl he wanted. The idea of his thiow- ing himself away upon a poor minister's daughter is just perfectly nonsensical. I have too good an opinion of his I   common-sense and his taste, to believe it for a second. He can't but know that he could look ever so much higher. What there is about this Miss Kirke that you all admire, I can't see, for the life of me. She couldn't carry it, in our place, with such a bold hand, as she does here. She would ble put dowrn at once and forever!" "Jessie Kirke is my friend, Hester, and was but just now my guest," said Fanny,firmly. "Excuse me forsaying that I cannot hear her spoken of unkindly in this house. She is a lady-born and bred. Papa says her family were people of rank in this country, before ours was ever heard- of. I am not an aristocrat, but if I were I should rather belong to what Dr. Holmes calls the ' Brahmin caste' in America, than to any other. Jessie Kirke comes of an educated race, and the refinement of educated genera- ii: tions shows itself in every motion and word. I do not I   affirm that she will-that :she would, if he offered-him- self, marry Mr. Wyllys. I do say that he would do well   164         JESSAM NE. to win her for his wife. And I suspect he does not need to be told this."                ,. The sun was an hour high as Jessie descended the granite steps of Judge Provost's manllsion. The college buildings lay to her right, upon rising grlound, separated by a shallow valley from the hill crowned by the Provost house and grounds. Instead of taking the street that would conduct her to Dr. Baxter's door, she turned sharply to the left, and began another and steeper ascent. There were few residences in this quarter of the town, and these were gentlemen's villas, separated by large gar- dens. She did not look up at the windows of the scat- tered dwellings in passing, although more than one ac- quaintance watched, from one and another of these, the straight, slender figure that held on its rapid course with- out sway or falter. In the plainest garb, she was c6n- spicuous for her carriage and peculiar style of beauty. This afternoon she looked like a young forest princess in her dark green dress, and tunic trimmed with fur, the black velvet cap and sweeping green feather. She had thought of Hester Sanford's colorless countenance and Parisian costumes as she made ready for the call upon Fanny, laughed to herself at the image that smiled back upon her from the mirror, knowing how far 1handsomer, even more "stylish" (Hester's pet word!) she was in her simple robes. .She thought more of such things now than ever before. Her enjoyment in general company was no longer the gratification of a young girl's frank vanity-often as guileless and freely uttered as a child's. The desire to be at her best looks, to attract and to hold the admiration  of those whom  she met abroad, had ceased to be simple and positive. There was   t JESSAMX E.        165 1.i0  in it the baser element of competition. She would be  beautiful and brilliant because otlxers--Hester Sanford I! . .in particular--were homely and silly. The feeling had i  grown upon her insidiously-so stealthily she could not tell when she forbore to laugh, good-naturedly, at the g    heiress' absurdities; to declare openly to :Mr. Baxter-     and Orrin that she had conceived an antipathy to her be- '   fore she lhad known her three hours, or three minutes,- that association with ler invariably provoked her into an I   ' indescribable but intolerable state of discomfort, analogous ! Rto that a cat is supposed to feel when her fur is turned the wrong way. But she disliked the woman intensely now when she hardlyiever named her to'others. i    There were many reasons for this. As proud in her way as Hester was vain-glorious. in hers, it galled her continually that she must appear-even for Fanny's and decency's sake-to submit to the insufferable imperti- inence of one who was her peer in nothing save the acci- dent of riches." She would give her no apparent ad- vantage; would not put it into her power to boast that she had driven her out of the arena whlere she-Hester -'believed that she reigned queen of Fashion, if not of Love and Beauty,-or she would have avoided her when- ever she could. It seemed to her that the more dignified course was to overlook her-lher spiteful innuendoes, her -pompous condescensions, and brainless boastings--with the sublime indifference of one wlhose. thoughts were set upon worthier and more comely objects; to mete out to the heiress scrupulously such show of regard as she would  vouchsafe a peevish, painted gad-fly hissing about her cars and eyes. The gad-fly 'had stung her out of her seeminkg of : .    166         JESSAMNE. haughty carelessness, and since she could not crush or even touch it, she was fleeing before it, as for her life. The figure occurred to her as she climbed a third hill- one she had never crossed before without pausing on the summit to look back over the town--a view Roy had commended to her admiration in one of his letters. She did not stop now, or turh her head, but almost ran 'down the other side, her teeth clinched, and a dry aching in the throat that ought to have been relieved by tears, yet was not to be. She met no one in her walk. The day was still, and very cold; the hills beyond the ice-bound river were strongly defined against a pale orange sky illto which the color seemed to be frozen, so unvarying was it, as the sun rolled horizonward. She had passed the region of paved sidewalks, but the ground rang like, stone un- der her tread; her breath was frosty vapor as soon as it left her lips. She did not think how much colder it would be in the open country road on the other side of the bridge. She would not feel it when she got there. Two wood wagons, each with a team of four horses, were coming across the bridge, abreast, and she stepped aside to let them pass. The drivers were walking behind their loads, swinging their arms and stamping to keep up the circulation of the congealing blood in their limbs. The roadsters tramped in a cloud of steamnfrom their nostrils, about which fine icicles clung to their shaggy hair. They had thick woollen shields over their breasts, fur collars upon their shoulders. "Men are tender in their mercies to the brute crea- tion! ' thought the young lady at whom the men looked with respectful but evident approbation, in going by. "When it comes to women, their pity fails them!"   JESSAMNJS.        1 ' S    She was doing more than escaping the malignant tongue that had blackened the fair famle of her be- trothed. She despised Hester Sanford's intellect and in- ventive talents so heartily that she should have laughed to scorn the tale to which she had hearkened; dissected I:  the ill-formed mass of contradictions, and boldly refuted her statements by a comparison of their incongruities.. Three months earlier she would have covered the traducer with confusion, and rightly punished her gloating audi- ence by standing forth as the defender of Eoy's honor and truth, and proudly announcing the nature of the bond between them. She was incapable of such an at- tempt now. Like a cowed hound, she had crouched in a corner and suffered the outrage to him who was her other self-the gallant gentleman, whose name she was to bear some day-lifted neither tongue nor finger to save that name from obloquy. Not even to amiable Fanny (how much braver than her craven self!) had she been able to say--"This man is to be my husband! Who strikes him, wounds and makes an enemy of me!" Why was this? Shle stopped midway across the bridge; leaned over the parapet with locked hands and rigid features; stared down upon the shining black ice-still not feeling the cold-and tried to answer the question thrust upon her. Why had she made no figit to save the. character of him for whom she had once declared herself willing to die? ' "How dared they?" she had muttered between her teeth, in leaving Judge Provost's portico. On the bridge she spoke again-a hoarse whisper it hurt her throat to sibillate,   168  168         JESSA MNE; ' If this be true!" sie-said, letting her clasped hands fall upon the stone wtall. There was a livid bruise on both, when she removed her gloves that evening, but-she had not felt it when it was dealt. Had then her belief in her lover's integrity succumbed to the weight of the first doubt cast upon it, in her presence? Were her faith and her love made of such flimsy stuff as to be torn into wretched rags by a single gale? .If these were ever well-founded, must not the in- roads of distrust have been gradual in order to be effectual? Had suspicion and forebodings visited her be- fore to-day? been harbored, but not recognized? If so, what were the grounds for doubts and fears a "If it be true-" she repeated, with a desolate moan-- "there is no help for me in earth or in lieaven! I can never trust-or love again l" Some one was coming on behind her with quick steps, which echoed loudly on the icy planks, and she walked on hastily. Her first unwise impulse was to increase her speed in the hope of getting away from the intruder, whoever he might be.  But finding, on reaching the opposite shore, that he gained on her, she slackened, her pace to let him pass. Slle would be the sooner alone and unobserved if she allowed him to go on. It was only a chance wayfarer, of course, but she would shun all eyes, idle or searching, while her brain was in such a whirl, her heart rent and quaking. She detected nothing familiar in the footfall, but she did remark, with a sense of irritation, that it was more deliberate in nearing her.

The hot sparkle was a blaze as she looked up. "Yes! and you, too, must have known it I Yo'u, who pretend to be my friend I My trust has been blind and foolish throughout. You were ready enough to counsel and warn me about other things. Why did you never tell me of Roy Fordham's former engagement? of the" love-affair (save the mark!) that clashed with mine?

Did'not respect or humanity urge you to spare me this bitter hu- miliation "I Unaffectedly amazed though he was at the ohslaught and the information she imparted, Orrin yet refrained from explicit denial. "Who has been talking to you?" he-asked, instead. She dashed through the story in fhe same impetuous  strain, ending it with-"He ought to have told me- this, and so ought you! I can forgive anything but deliberate deception." Orrin mused. "You are excited-" he began, slowly. She interrupted him- ; Who would not be? I am not a stone!'"- "Nobody said that you were, or ought to be," smiling a little. "I was about to say that the displeasure you feel is perfectly natural-j-ist what any woman with a " heart would experience in the cilrcumstances. But let- lis   179       .

"I do not know that he asserted it in so many words," she replied, with a vivid blush. "But I certainly inferred as much from what he has said." "Every woman's inference is the same when she listens to a declaration of affection. Who but a fool would pre- face such by a confession of how many times he had re- hearsed it to other ears? Few men reacli the age of twenty-five without having had two or three grandes pas- saons. I do not maintain, as a gentleman did once in my hearing, when taxed with being engaged in his fortieth love-suit, that in this, as in most other things, practice makes perfect. But I hold that you cannot accuse Roy of deceiving you, unless he has declared expressly that he had never loved or wooed until he met you. Happy, are those who are not visited by the ghosts of by-gone- and, as theydeemed, buried--affections upon their bridal eves 1 Ghosts that are hard enough to lay, as many a miserable married, not mated one can testify."  -"None such shall stand between me and him whom I marry!" cried Jessie, vehemently. "If Roy Fordham once loved--if he still regrets this girl-?has one pang of compunction in the review of her fidelity and her sorrow; if he repents, never so slightly, his relinquishment of her upon insufficient cause-he shall go back to her. I will have a whole heart, or I will quit him, a pauper in mlove. Divided allegiance is worse than desertion." "Be assured of one thing!" returned. Orrin, emphati- cally. "Roy Fordham 'regrets' no past action of his own. Ilis judgment is as calm as his measures are de   JESSAM IN.'        173 cided. If he suffers his heart to go out of his keeping, he does it in the persuasion that he could not act more pru- dently, more in, accordance with his best interests, than to intrust it to her whom he has chosen. But should lie, nevertheless, discover, from subsequent' developments, that he was mistaken, he would recall affections and troth without weak hesitation. ) If Miss Sanford's story be true (which, please observe, I am far from admitting), we may still rest content in the knowledge that he pursued what he thought was the wisest course-performed what seemed to him a simple and imperative duty. He is; of all men I know, the most clear-headed and conscientious. If his ideas upon certain subjects appear to me to be over-strict, if his conduct, in cases that would be trying emergencies to me, looks like an exercise of -superhuinan resolution or self-denial, I do not, therefore, question his wisdom or my failings. His standard of right is so ele- Vated, his views of duty are based .upon-" "Don't make labored excuses for him which. yoiu feel, in your soul, are paltry sophisms!" burst out Jessie, im- patiently ' "Is it your belief that he was ever betrothed to this girl ] And, if so, did he cast her off upon the bar- barous pretext Hester Sanford named a I have tried to think it all out," she continued, putting her hand to her head, like one dazed or stunned, "but nothing is fixed and clear.

"I am thankful that this cannot be!" said Orrin, comn- posedly. "I understand him better tian you do ill some respects. To doubt is to insult him. One sentence of accusation,' aid your power over himn is gone forever. Be guided by me, Jessie! You are not in a fit condition to decide for yourself upon your safest mode of action at this critical juncture.

He may not be an ardent suitor, because his is not a passionate nature, nor is le given to demonstrations of emotion. But he is more than contented. He is sincerely attached to you-"  "Which means that he will fulfil his part of the con- ' tract of marriage, unlessn my sister should die of consump-  tion before the wedding-day arrives!"Jessie checked  his defence of his kinsman by saying, with a rasping laugh. Wyllys looked deeply pained. We will defer further conversation albout this matter untilyou are calmer," he said, with a manifest struggle. "You are not ready for it just yet, or you would not sneer at my well-meant, if ineffectual, attempt to set your minld at rest."

If this is the ablest defence- you can set up for your client, you do well to defer the furtlher consideration of it. I have prayed yo for bread, and you give me a stone! I have said-' Let me have the plain truth! ' and you tantalize me with fine-drawn theo- ries and exhortations to patience anid faith. I am tempted to believe that you are in the league to deceive me!"  17         JESSATVRE "Jessie! Jessie I take care! You do not know what you are doing!" It was entreaty-not'reproach. He seemed to crave a personal boon--deliverance from impending trial of his strength or feelings. Jessie rushed on headlong, deaf to the significance of the petition. "Your advocacy is worthy of the cause you have espoused I And while you expatiate upon your cousil's cool head and colder heart, and recommend me to make. sure of this pattern partner--yesl that is the way you put it-I am being torn by pride and wounded affection and incertitude, as by raging wild horses!

The sun was down. They were in, a routgh cotuntry-road; stone fences on either hand; the!:ked hedge-rows seeming to / shiver in the still, freezing! The hard orange dye of   JES&SA WIVAL        I'('( the west was beginning to melt slowly into a gray as cold. It was a heartless, dreesome afternoon. Jessie never forgot it, or the interval of awful silence that succeeded Wyllys' unprecedented outhreak. Not daring to glance at his face, she had a second surprise, when he, at length, suggested, in a tone tranquil to cold- ness, that they should retrace their steps. Could she be dreaming now? Or were the strange, wild words echoing confusingly in her brain, dictated by her distem- pered fancy? "It will be late before we reach home, as it is," Orrin offered, in support of his proposition. "And the air grows keener every moment." Nothing more passed between them until they were again upon the bridge, where he stayed her, for a moment, that he might rearrange heer furs. "You are not used to this biting weather! Are you tolerably comfortable " he asked, in his usual brotherly way. "Quite comfortable-if you are not angry with me!" she answered, enboldened by the little attention and his tone. "You silly child I I have never had a thought of you that bordered upon unkindness.. We have both been hasty and unreasonable in judgment and in language, this afternoon. Your warmth was excusable. Mine was culpable weakness. Yon will hate me, in time, if I forget myself in this manner. Itwas selfish and wicked, besides being unmanly. Don't contradict noe! I know what I am saying now, at any rate.

"I shall write to him by to-morrowis mail, and tell him all!" said Jessie, with a return of stubbornness. "You will regret it all your life I If he is guilty, he will be offended at your arraignment of him by letter, which must, of necessity, be formal and incomplete as to testimony-you having but one witness, and that by no means a reliable one. Should he be innocent, you inflict severe and needless pain; put yourself in the posi- tion of a touchy, suspicious, exacting Jiancee, whose troth he will ever thlereafter hold by a slight tenure. 'Let sleeping dogs lie'"is a sage motto, unless they can bark to some purpose. If you will allow me, I shall make it my business to sift this story carefully, and apprise you of the result-if I have to cultivate an inti- macy with Miss Sanford in order to get at the truth. Meanwhile, we will depend upon what we are certain of--Roy's integrity and the nicety of his honor. At the risk of' being again taken to task for special pleading, let me say that he-is, in my estimation, as nearly faultless as mortals ever grow to be. You cannot act more ration- ally than to think as much as possible of him, and as little of his vaurien cousin as is consistent with common benevolence." It was silvery-gray twilight out-of-doors when they gained Mrs. Baxter's door, and they found a rosy twilight of summer within her firelighted parlors, balmy, more- over, with the spiciness flowing out in the genial tem- perature, from the latest bouquet presented by Mr. Wyllys. The donor, playfully gallant, and bent, it would 'seem, upon effacing the memory of his late excited speech,   f    .          JESSANMT7E.        179 was chafing Jessie's numb fingers before the fire, and she laughing in spite of herself at his sallies, when Mrs. Baxter tripped in.'  She always entered a room bouncingly, generally with the added effect of being pushed in by some unseen hand from behind. She recoiled, momentarily, at the tableau upon the rug, and Jessie observed it with a sick, guilty qualm that made. her snatch away her hand from Orrin's'hold. ^ He was not discomfited. "Here is a frozen wayfarer I pickled upon the bridge, my dear madam, taking an unconstitutional,5 he said. "Mindful of your known charity and condescension, I took the liberty of bringing her in to be treated by you as her needs require. If I may advise you in a matter in which you are so much wiser than myself, I recom- mend that a cup of warm drink-gruel, panada, or posset -and a reasonable amount of admonition, tempered to suit the exhausted state of the patient, be adminilistered without delay. As an additional precaution 'against rheumatism, pleurisy, or bronchitis, a glass of hot lemon- ade, with"-affecting to whisper--"a tablespoonful of Jamaica rum or old Bourbon, at bedtime, would be eminently judicious. My impertinence culminates in the petition that you vouchsafe to bestow upon my un- worthy but chilly self a cup of the nectar in common use upon your table under the name of souchong." Jessie slipped away to her chamber while her cousin was replying in suitable terms to this nonsense, and did not reappear until the tea-bell had rung twice. She had been crying, Mrs. Baxter saw at once, and she was still very pale. It had been a violent fit of   180         JESSAMNE. weeping that had exhausted her to languor of expres- sion and movement. The doctor spoke cheerily to her as she seated herself beside him. "Well, my little girl, how are your spirits, this freez- ing night? Do they follow the mercury, or rise as it descends?" An unfortunate question, but it brought a faint glow to her face. "I shall be more lively when I have had my supper," she said, averting her eyes. '"I am cold and tired now." The doctor bent his head and raised his hand to ask a blessing, and then bade his wife "pour out Jessie's tea, forthwith. She looks as if she needed it," he sub- joined, uneasily, watching her with eyes that were very keen when he was awake to what was passing in the everyday and material world. Jessie sipped the scalding liquid, swallowing each spoonful withl a tremendous effort, when it trickled down the lump that obstructed larynx and epiglottis, wishing, the while, that the doctor would subside into one of his fits of learned abstraction and knot his handkerchief, in-  stead of staring so solemnly at her; expecting, every second, to bear him demand-"What have you been crying about, my daughter?'" She was! very grateful to Orrin for his persistent and, in the end, successful atttempts to draw the fire of the searching regards; and, rallying her wits and courage,- she, at last, Joined in the- conversation. Mrs. Baxter, likewise, was less voluble than was her wont. Appreciat- ing the fact, recognized by the majority of his acquaint- ances, that Mr. Wyllys was not a marrying man, she6 aroused herself to ponder, in serious earnest, upon what   /   I               JE8SAJINE.         181 was likely to be the result of his fraternal intimacy with her ward. Orrin had made all straight with her at the outset, even before Jessie entered her house as a visitors by representing himself as an old friend of the family, and speaking of Mr. Kirke's daughter in a grandfatherly strain, that entitled him to become the platonic cavalier of the rustic debutante. But platonic grandfathers did not squeeze pretty girls' hands en tete-a-tete in the twilight -" or they should not," reasoned the duenna; and, Jessie's red eyes and pallid complexion increased her misgivings to dreads. She had been asleep all winter until to-night, she thought, shudderingly, and had awak- ened upon the edge of a precipice. If through her neglect or misplaced confidence, Ginevra's child should come to grief, she would rue, to the latest day of her life, the invitation that had enticed her from home and safety, to lose her heart to the designing arts of a man of the world. Orrin had small temptation to prolong his stay into the evening. There was incipient'disfavor in the hostess' eye, which was not neutralized by her stereotyped smile. The doctor betook "himself to his study when he arose from the table, and Jessie shaded her face from fire and lamp-light by a hand-screen, complaining that she was stupid after her walk in the wind. "I promised to go up to Judge Provost's to-night, he said, at the end of an unsatisfactory half hour. ' Won't you join our party for billiards and music Miss Fanny charged me not to come without you." Jessie did not raise -her regards from the sereen. "No, thank you! I have had enough billiards for one day. And I am in an intensely unmusical humor."   182         JESA WrNE "I really ought to 'do' the polite to Miss Sanford," continued he, lightly to Mrs. Baxter's ears, significantly to Jessie's. "I have been shamefully remiss since her appearance among us. Miss FaIIny took me to task for it, an evening or two since, and I was obliged to plead ' Guilty.' I have paid her very little attention except in public, and that has been confined to a dance or two at each party."' Mrs. Baxter, profoundly indifferent to Miss Sanford, and the degree of court he offered her, yet strove to look interested. "That is a little remarkable, Mr. Wyllys, considering your reputation for gallantry and hospitality, and she is invested withl more substantial charms than any of our Hamilton belles can boast." "I am afraid my tastefor the substantial has not been properly cultivated," was the reply. Jessie was silent and gloomy, and Wyllys secretly lost patience with her. "I thought her more of a woman!" he said, inly. "She acts like a fractious child, inconsolable for the loss of a toy. I gave her credit for more depth of feeling, more power of endurance." She called up a faint symptom of a' smile, in response to his adieux, and relapsed into taciturnity and the shadow of her screen, when he had departed. Mrs. Baxter flitted about the rooms like a perturbed guardian angel; poking the fire that her charge's feet might be warmer; dropping a curtain to shut out a draught from the back of her neck; pushing forward a brioehe for her use, and giving her chair a gentle tug nearer the grate, before she essayed verbal consolation.   'JES8A KLNE.        183 Finally, ishe leaned upon the back of Jessie's seat and made several mesmeric passes over her brow and scalp, the fringe of the scarlet scarf it was her pleasure, to- night, to sport twisted around her right wrist, brushing the chin, and tickling th'e nose of her young relative. "Does your head ache very badly now, my sweet " breathlessly' solicitous. "Not at all-thank you, cousin I " "I am delighted to hear you say so! You don't think you have really taken cold, my precious-do you?" "Oh, no! I never take cold!" " "Mr. Wyliys seemed very anxious lest you liad," Mrs. Baxter remarked, quite too earnestly. "I say,;' seemed,' for these ladies' men are not models of sincerity, always, however charming they may be as parlor companions. If I had a daughter, my love-and it is the great sorrow of my life, as it is of the doctor's, that we never had one -if I had a daughter, just blooming into womanhood, affectionate, susceptible, and unsuspecting, I should cau- tion her to be on her guard against a too-ready credence in the flattering tongues and the more. insidious flattery of demeanor and action of gentlemen who are honorable in all things else. I respect Mr. Wyllys "-she contin- ued, the passes faster and more agitated, and the silken fringes bobbing up and down before Jessie's vision. "Il honor his many estimable-admire his many shining qualities. But I am fearful that in'his otherwise- com- mendable desire to please and make happy, he may ex- cite hopes-or expectations may be the better term--he never intended to engender. There is in every conm- munity, my darling Jessie, a class of men--pardon me for saying that it is fortunately a small class-who do *,               ,     184         JESSA WYE. not care or intend to marry except for convenience, or pecuniary gain-perhaps not even then. Yet they are generally the pets of their respective circles, especial fav- orites with ladies. Why, I cannot say, unless it bed that they endeavor to make themselves agreeable to the entire ! sex, instead of concentrating their attentions upon one i woman. Mr. Wyllys is a notable example of this order of carpet knights." Entirely out of breath by this time, she withdrew her hand from her guest's head, to press it upon her own pal- pitating bosom, while her gulp of emotion was as loud as the cluck of a brooding hen. Jessie lowered her screen with a gesture of haughty amusement. "If your object is to warn me against attaching undue importance to Mr. Wyllys' friendly attentions, Cousin, I can disabuse your mind of fears for my peace of heart, by assuring you that it is not threatened from that quar- ter. I ought to have told you, long ago, of a circum- stance that exculpates Mr. Wyllys from the charge of trifling, and renders the notice he bestows upon me alto- gether harmless and proper. I; am engaged to be mar- ried to his cousin, Mr. Fordham, and he knows it. This makes all safe for us both-does it not? I am-sorry I did not apprize you of this state of affairs when I first came to you. It would have been more honorable and kind to you--and a' actof common justice to Mr. Ford- ham, if not to Mr. Wyllys." * ^  ,  .     ,  .   HERE was no prettier spot in the Dundee valley than Willow Creek, a Somewhat wide and in some places deep, stream, just where it was spanned by a rustic bridge at the bottom of the Parsonage meadow's. The fringe of willows on the thither bank, and 'the alder and birch thicket studding that nearest the house, were reflected in the clear, brown mir- ror to the tiniest leaf and bud. 'Beneath and between. these, there were stretches of turf which wereevergreen; beds of w ild balsam that flow ere d all summe r; ferns inm variety and profusin, from the tre it wae-ferns upboanned by teir wiry black stemsi to a height of fouthr or five Parsfeet, to th  e delicate maiden-hair, hiding in t he lee of straws and sto baesk, and on the day we are describingch thickethe fif th ofat September-these alternated win th borders ofwn mir-y mountain sage,  blue-eyed ast ers, tossing plumes of golden- rod, yet taller purple brulsl, stiff and gorgeous, and patches of bright yellow dodder, running riotously into 1   186       - JESSAMNE. - the water, and entangling the commoner arrow-leaf and sedge in its meshes. Through the gorge worn by the creek in the moun- tains, one had a view of the upper valley, and the chain of hills that grew bluer and lower as the eye pursued their southerly course. Below the bridge was the church, benignant warder of the plain fertile as was that of Sodom, loaded with corn, ripe for cutting, and already stacked for the garner, and white, here and there, as from untimely snows, with blossoming buckwheat. The whistle of the quail in the stubble, the rattling roll of empty farm wagons over the stone bridge below the mill. on their way to the field; the duller thunder of heavily laden trains 'creaking and swaying from side to side be- hind the straining oxen, and the drowsy undertone of the mill-wheel, mingled with the nearer warble of birds in the trees and the gentle wash of the waves uinder the  willows. It was bright,-beniglant weather-a day that reminded one of healthy, active, happy mliddle-age, for there was a whisper of Autumn in the air, the mellowness of Autumnal light over plain and water and hill. There was nothing in landscape, air, or sunlight that should have reminded Jessie Kirke of the miserable February afternoon when she stood on the Hamilton bridge, staring down at the black ice below, and fought her first battle of life. But that other scene and the strife of that hour were very present to her, as she halted on the foot-bridge and leaned over the rail to gaze at the slow, smooth current of the creek. The narrow crossing had been designed and partly built by Mr. K irke him- self. The floor was of oak plank ; the railing was com- posed of cedar branches with the bark left on? arranged   JESSAMNE.        187 in fantastic figures, and surmounted by a slender pole of the same wood. Many stopped to examine and admire it in passing over, and it made a picturesque feature in the view. It was familiar in every joint to Jessie, having formed a part of her favorite walk for ten years; but she chose to linger there on this morning, to hang over the' parapet, pick bits of bark from the side and fling them into the creek, as an idle child might launch and watch a miniature fleet. It was a face many removes from childhood's thought- lessuess and childish glee that looked back at her from the glassy surface, A face, wild-eyed and haggard, with bent brows betokening suffering and conflict; a mouth telling, in piteous and patient lines, of defeat. She had returned from Hamilton in April, looking jaded and ill, said the Dundeeials, who shook sagacious heads over her winter's dissipation. Her father and Eunice attributed her loss of bloom and liveliness to too close application to her studies, and cited her improve- mnent in music, French, and German, in proof of their theory. She did not relax her diligence when she was settled at home. Eunice, whose-name was a synollym for industry, did not surpass her in strict attention to all' departments of feminine work. In the kitchen and- the garden, at the needle, the piano, writing-desk, and her books, she toiled from sunrise until bedtime, with energy Eunice silently likened to greediness for occupation of mind aend body, while Mr. Kirke hardly recognized his darling in the decorous thrifty housewife and busy student. Into- nations, phraseology, and department.-all were altered. She was an elegant woman in appearance and coniversa-  tion, but the fond parent missed the tricksy sprite who ,    i    .      188         J  X iSJEsSA4TNE. had wrought mischief and mirth in his home; missed her teasing and her follies, her exactions and her caresses. Not that she was cold or sullen. She told long and enter- taining stories of her Hamilton life; gave faithful de- scriptions of the people and. things she had seen while away from them; listened with apparent interest to neigh- borhood news and family plans; talked of art, literature, and philosophy to him by the hour; was attentive to his every possible want, and offered regularly the morning and evening kiss she had been accustomed to bestow from her infancy. But, having already one daughter who was an exemplar to her sex, he recollected the bewitching niaughtiness of the old-time Jessie, and wished fervently that he had met Mrs. Baxter's invitation by a peremptory negative, and kept his gem as it was. To his taste, it had' lost-not gained-in the cutting and polishing. Eunice was discreet when he intimated something of the kind to her. "She is certainly more quiet and studious," she replied, u but she says she is very well, and she has much to make her thoughtful in Roy's absence. The long separation must, of itself, oppress her spirits continually. And, Father, our Jessie has gained new views of Life and Duty within the last year. She can never be a child again. Her nature-mind and affections-must broaden and deepen with time. We would not have it otherwise, strange as the change is to us now. I fear, though, that she works too hard, while I honor her determination to prepare herself thoroughly for her future position. She will be a wife of whom Roy may justly be proud." Again, when Or. Kirke feared that Jessie was often depressed to despondency, although she strove bravely to   JESSA INe. 189 conceal it, the elder sister " hoped all would be well again when Roy camne back." He can reason or soothe her out of morbid fancies better and sooner than either you or I. - His influence over her is wonderful and always beneficial." "I wish he were home again then!" sighed the parent. He did not guess how heartily Eunice echoed the de- sire. She might be partially successful in quelling his anxieties, but the beryl eyes saw that, so far from all being right with her young sister, something was lament- ably wrong. Jessie's very manner of speaking of Roy and her marriage was totally dissimilar to her former frank or bashful confession. If she had lived with him as his wife a dozen years, she could not have mentioned his name more composedly, or talked of housekeeping and other practicalities in a more matter-of-fact strain. This was exceedingly sensible, but it was not, on that account, the more like Jessie. The transformation from an en- thusiastic madcap, who did and felt nothing by halves let it be loving, laughing, sorrowing, or working-into the dignified partner of Eunice's everyday cares and duties, equable in temper, reliable in judgment, and ju- dicious in action-ought, perhaps, to have elicited com- mendation from one who was herself a model in all these respects but, instead of gratification, she felt only be- wilderment and alarm at the completeness of the change. It had been her habit to think and say, when her sister's crudities or extravagances were more marked than her quieter taste approved, that the discipline of life, as life went on, would rectify these; that they were- but the re- dundant growth of a noble stock. A little pruning--a few sharp experiences, and hypercritical indeed would be   190        TESAM7IE. the judgment that should find room for blame. She was displeased with herself in recollecting this, now that the discipline had wrought upon the free, wild spirit; the redundancies had fallen under the pruning-knife. Something of this external change must have mani- fested itself in Jessie's letters, for oly had twice written  privately to Eunice, questioning her closely about her sis- ter's health and spirits. "Her letters are as regular as ever, and no less beanti- ful than punctual," he said. "But they contain so few particulars of hier daily life and feelings, while they treat freely of other subjects, that I have fancied there is something pertaining to her individual experience she desires to hide from me, lest the knowledge of it should pain me. My noble, generous girl I She would bear any distress or inconvenience rather than afflict me by reveal- ing the extent of her siffering or perplexity. I intrust my sometimes wayward-always sweet, graceful, and clinging Jessamnine to you, our sister! Tend and guard it tenderly for me." Eullice answered hopefully and with such reassurance as she could truthfully impart, and wished more ardently than ever that he would return and assume the charge of his treasure-the charge and the cure. They had had a quiet summer, the most stirring event being a visit from Mrs. Baxter anld Orrin Wyllys, wlho acted as her escort. They were domesticated for a week at the parsonage, and Jessie's monopoly of her cousin's society had left Orrin almost entirely to her father's and sister's care. Nobody made verbal objection to this di- vision of hospitable duties. Mr. Vyllys held longtalks with his host-sciellntific, theological, literary, and political   JtTES1S9Ar7jTfE.       i 191. -during post-prandial smokes, besides driving and walk- ing with hinm in his professional rounds at such seasons as lunice was too busy to attend to her guests. When she was at liberty to devote herself to social duties, there were hours of music and reading; long rambles among the hills-Mrs. Baxter and Jessie, far in advance-for the latter always outstripped her sister in pedestrian expedi- tions; moonlight promenades and conferences on the piazza that left Jessie all the time she desired for conver- sation with her late cha erone. It was generally agreed at parting that the week had passed swiftly and delight- fully; farewells were linked with hopes of a repetition of the pleasure, and the household relapsed into its ordina- ry aspect and ways. If there were any perceptible dif- ference in those composing it, it was that Jessie worked harder and was paler than before the interruption, while Eunice grew younger and prettier every day. "I  have tried very hard!"Jessie said aloud, still hanging over the water, but clasping her hands in a sort of despair. And I am very tired!" Then two heavy tears rolled from her eyes arid broke up the reflection of the sad face below into little dancing circles.- An hour ago, as she stood in the garden grafting a rose- bush, a neighbor rode up. to the fence to say, "Good-day,j and inquire after the health of the clergyman's family. "You'll have company pretty soon' I'm thinking," he said, knowingly.  "I suppose that's no  news to you, though?  "NVe expect no one," said Jessie, carelessly. "It will be a  pleasant surprise to you, then. I saw Mr. Wyllys at the hotel as I cameo by."   19a         JESSAMNE. Jessie's knife swerved slightly as she made the in- cision in the bark, but her voice was firm. C( Are you sure     .    ; "Oh, y es II talked with him. He got up'late last night, he said. Come how, Miss Jessie; I am an old friend, which of you is he after 2 " "Neither that I know of. Certainly not me!" replied she, imperturbably. She finished her task carefully, when the inquisitor had passed; carried twine and- scissors into the house; gave Patsey an order as she .glanced into the kitchen, and, un- observed by the servant, left the dwelling and went down through the garden into the meadow. Her father and Eunice were away from home for the day-probably for the night also, and she, had her reasons for preferring the solitude of the woods, or a retreat among the crags of Old Windbeam, to a prolonged interview with Orrin Wyllys. Did I say, * preferred "? Does not the opium-eater, il' his lucid intervals, prefer thirst and languor and pain to the drug for which his diseased appetite cries out as the dying for breath,-and the fever-scorched forwater? Pre- fer it with mind and conscience, if not with flesh and will? Jessie Kirke's will lived yet, and it had borne her beyond the reach of temptation and kept her there. 'But it did'not hinder her from picturing Orrin pacing the portico, or, sitting in the parlor, awaiting her while she hid herself and her wretchedness among the willows. She had but to go. back by the way she had come, and *hours of blissful companionship 'would be hers; full draughts of enjoyment such as those which had intoxi- : cated the unwary girl who, last winter, had believed that   JESSAMNE.         193 she might drink and be blameless. His eyes would kin- dle into the magic gleam that enervated resolution and let loose a flood of vague, delicious fancies upon her brain; his voice melt into the modulations that'enchained the ear like pathetic music. Under the spell of his con- summate address she would believe, for the moment, or the hour, or the day he spent with her, all that he said or looked, although dimly conscious, the while, that she would despise herself as a weak, guilty fool for the:tem- -porary faith, through weeks and months afterward. As she did now! She was wrung by self-contempt for nursing these imaginations, yet dallied with them- sipped shudderingly, yet with avidity, of their dangerous sweetness.     , "I have tried very hard!" she moaned again. Tried to hold fast to her trust in her betrothed after the cruel shock it had sustained from Hester Sanford's story, for she still believed that it was firm and absolute up to that hour; ignored persistently the fact that other influ- ences had previously been at work sapping her confidence in the attachment of one who, his nearest of kin reluc- tantly admitted, was a man of granite, virtuously severe to the frailties of others, because he was himself prudent, sae, and incorruptible by such bribes as most men found potent-love, and the hope and opportunity of making the beloved one happy.- Not one" word of this had Wyllys ever uttered. He always spoke of Roy with seri- osness and respect, confessing voluntarily, time and again, his own moral and intellectual inferiority to his cousin, and scrupulously keeping-her betrothment before Jessie's mind. Whatever might have been her elapses from loyalty, she could not deny that in this oft-reprated ,   194    :     JESSATMNE. acknowledgment of her paramount obligation to her affianced husband, Orrin had been honorable to punctil- iousness. She had not yet come to see that he had also (been ingenious in pressing invisible shackles into her soul; in reminding her perpetually that she was no lon- ger a free agent. The girl had chafed under the process, without- knowing that she did so, and why. Her broth- erly friend, who had seen a blooded horse, although Aa dpeiaby nature and well broken in, fret and grow rest- ive under an over-tight check-rein, may have known, bet- ter than she, what he was about. She was still uncertain how much or how little truth there was in the heiress' tale. She had contrived to see her but seldom after the scene in the billiard-room, and- in this she was ably seconded by ]liss Sanford when- the newts of "that Miss Kirke's ' engagement to Professor Fordham was circulated in Hamilton circles. Jessie .did not try to analyze the impulse that bade her announce the relation she bore to Roy at -the very time when her doubts of him were at their height. Perhaps she felt the need of a safeguard for herself; or her conscience may have rebuked her that she had not defended him- right or wrong-when attacked; or the suspicion of his unworthiness stimulated her to a strained generosity a resolve-to leave undone no part of the duty she owed, while she was under contract to him. It had been long since her latest mention of the matter to Wyllys. He had replied to her queries by an injunction to con- tinued confidence in Roy's integrity, which was construed by her into a charitable evasion. lie promised again and solemnly to push his investigations as occasion might offer, but she believed' that he was afraid to keep his / "1               do  j    iJEBSA jMr71E.       195 word. He would preserve intact his own love and es- teem for the cousin he professed to revere, and blindly declined to undertake the examination of a record he f;   more than feared contained entries that would lower his opinion of his hero, and damage the latter's character l   iirretrievably with herself. Given this lever of unappeased distrust in, and latent resentment toward him, to whom her allegiance was due, and a less adroit diplomat than Orrin Wyllys might have so weakened the defences of her love and con- staney as to make her question whether surrender were not unavoidable  even desirable. She was "tired," poor j child! dismayed that her labor in "deep mid-ocean " was so tedious and severe, longing for rest in whatever port her worn heart might make. "I shall be tamed by the time you come home," she had said, 'twixt tears and smiles, to Roy at their parting.  "Quite tame and old!" "And I am!" she-thought, the jest recurring to her', now. "Only life has also grown tame, and the world old , and gray!" She had swung her hat upon her arm, and pushing -back. her hair with the palms that supported her 'fore- head, that the wind from the water might cool her beat- -ing temples, she rested her listless weight upon the frail raiting. The woven twigs, once supple, were dry and rotten under the bark, and swayed outward with a sharp crack--a warning that came  too late to save her. She, caughllt, in falling, at the shattered panels left standing, and dragged only a  -handful of :broken sticks with her into the'creek. Coming to the surface after the plunge, she threw her grasping, struggling hands widely abrod,    196        JESSA Mm7E. succeeded in seizing one of the upright supports of the bridge, and clung to it. Her head and shoulders were out of water. She was not actually drowning. In the strength imparted by this consciousness, she drew a long breath, and called for help. A faint echo came back from the hills. The rest of the shout was lost in the Spreading meadows, or over- powered by the commingled sounds that were the voice of the early autumn day. / She heard them more distinctly than when she had istood upon the bridge; the beat of the mill-wheel, the rattle and fumble of the farm-wagons, even the tread of ':the team upon the oaken flooring; the now distant whistle of, the quail, and, close beside her, the lapping of the creek among the sedges. She weighedher chances of speedy release from her un- pleasant and dangerous situation before she raised another outcry.. The stream was the feeder of the,-mill-pond, and was made deeper and more sluggish by the dam, less than half a mile farther down. She remembered to have heard that the depth just under the bridge was about ten feet. It might as well be a hundred if she were to relin- quish her hold. She could do nothing but cling and wait until her calls should bring rescue, or some chance pas- senaer'espy her. This was an unfrequented by-way, and it might be many hours before assistance came to her in the latter form. As to the other, the Parsonage was the nearest dwelling. The mill was no farther off, but the united shriek of twenty drowning wmen could not be heard above the clatter of the machinery. Patsey was alone in the kitchen, her whole soul in her semi-weekly baking, and deaf to all out-door noises excepting those = -  r    JESfAMt ZINA97 from the poultry-yard.  There was no one else in the house, unless Orrin had arrived. Jessie believed that she tasted the bitterness of death, as she imagined him, ex- pectant of her coming, yet thoughtless of evil as the rea- son of her delay, taking a few restless turns, upon the portico; then, wandering into the parlor, and standing, as he often did, for several minutes together, gazing at the picture-of the girl at, the wishing-well; opening the piano and running over some remembered air, or improvising dreamy, wistful strains, with absent thoughts, and eyes fixed upon vacancy. And she was here! nearing the gates that were to shut down between them forever. She called again-a shrill scream that scared the' birds from their perches on the willow and birch Boughs, and awoke a wailing echo among the mountains. Then all was quiet, save for the mill, the fainter roll of heavy wheels, and, louder than either, the lap! lap! lap I of the waves upon the grassy bank. flow deadly cold the water was! And -she became sensible now of an increasing weight drawing her downward-the strain of :her satu- rated garments -upon the arms wound about therough pole which stood between her and death. There Was a current, also, to be resisted, placid as the mirror had seemed from above, and her sinews were aching already.- Her whole body would be numb presently--her clutch be relaxed by cold and the prostration of the nervous and muscular system. - She had decried life as tame, and the world asunlovely. She found them, in this fearfully honest hour, too dear and beautiful to leave thus suddenly. She recollected, ev0en in this season of peril and dread, the oftre atd-   198         JESSAMNE. story that one in the act of drowning recalls, in a flash of memory, every event of his past existence, however re- mote and miminute; reasoned within herself that this must be an old wives' fable, since she, on the brink of eternity, had but one overmastering idea-how to avert impending dissolution. Her father, Elnice, Roy, and Orrin, were all in her mind by turns, but there was no quickening of affection now that she might be leaving them to re- turn no more. They were, in comparison with the terri- ble fact of her present danger, but misty and far-off ab- stractions-faded portraits in her mental gallery, hardly deserving a glance. She dwelt, in agony, upon the cir- cumstances that the stream was becoming like ice to her limbs, and the pain in her arms intense, while her soaked clothing arid the current were sucking her downward. When, the last remnant of her strength should fail, would she be drowned by the cruel waters where she had fallen in, bor ne, conscious, and writhing in the throes of suf- focation, over the dam, to be mangled by the rocks below the fall a.  ,The horror of the last fancy drew from her another shriek. The echo taunted her by its feeble mimickry; the dull boom of the mill-wheel,- the teamster's shout to his oxen, had the'same meaning, and the lapping of the water was that of a fierce destroyer, hungering for his prey. Meanwhile, the visitor at the Parsonage had been through the round Jessie had sketched for him in her tortured imagination; had paced the porch until he was weary of the solitary turns; surveyed the portrait to his heart's content, regretting, in his aesthetic mind, that the original had toned down to the level of commonplace re- i -.*  *     -            .   -JESSAM1IA        199 finement, and had played a pensive "thought" on the piano. This performance brought in Patsey. "Dick Van Brunt was by the gate just now, Mr. Wyl- lys, and he said as how he seen Miss Jessie going down toward the crick, nigh upon an- hour ago. You mought see something of her if you was to walk that way." "Thank you, Patsey. Perhaps T will if she do nfbt come in soon. And perhaps I' Imought' make a fool of myself, clambering over those confounded mountain-paths for half a day, and not get a glimpse of her!" he mut- tered, when the handmaiden had withdrawn. He stepped through the oriel-window into the garden, humming, sotto voce, "My heart's in the Hielands, my heart is not here;'" made the tour of the enclosure, noting how Eunice's rose labyrinth had grown, and that the rarer plants he had sent her in the Spring were recompensing her for the care she had bestowed upon them; brushed both hands over a bed of bergamot until the air reeked with perfume, and plucked a sprig of rosemary from- the spot where he had stood to overhear the-"sisters' criticisms of himself sixteen months before-smiling queerly as he, did so. "I will send the fair Una a root of ' Cesar's Bay,'with the stipulation that she shall set it just here," he said, in- wardly, the smile brightening at the apt conceit. "It shall be to me:a floral monument-a Cupid's Ebenezer." He gathered, furthermore, several bunches of choice  roses, rifling them of their freshest odor by ruthless hand- ling, and strewing them to the right and left as he -went from the gardenpinto the meadow. The day was fine, and not warm enough to make walking a grievous task,+   200         JESSAMNE.         f and he might find Jessie at or near the bridge. He whistled "Casta Diva "' as he strolled over the short, thick grass, elastic to the foot as carpets of the deepest pile,- whistled melodiously, and, one would have said, for want of thought, in remarking his roving eyes and tranquil physiognomy. He looked, as lie felt, on excellent terms with himself and the rest of the world; like a man who had eaten to satisfaction, but not to repletion, of the sunny side of the peach tendered by Fortune, and wilo was suitably grateful to the person to whom he considered that he owed his success in life-to wit, Orrin Wyllys. What a companion portrait to set over against this serene visage and lounging figure in the pleasant meadow- paths was that, which, with distorted limbs, and counte- nance eager to frenzy, hung midway over the stream he was approaching! Jessie had heard the whistle, and known it for his; caught from afar his measured tread upon the sward, and, feeling herself grow weak and voiceless in the rush of reviving hope, had painfully gathered her remaining forces to abide his coming. She could see him through rifts in the low-branching birches; counted every step with trembling impatience until he was within a stone's throw. Then: she signalled him ina husky, dissonant voice that shocked herself, fainting though she was with suspense, :, intent only upon watching his movements, which meant : to her deliverance, sure and swift. "C Orrin! make haste!- I am perishing!" A glimpse of the broken railing told him all. Tearing off his coat as he ran, he leaped into the creek, swam out to her, and, bade her loosen her hold, and re- main perfectly quiet.    JESSA MtE         20o "Don't seize me! I will save you! Trust me!" he said, in authority she did not dream of resisting. In a minute more he had dragged her through the water and laid her upon the warm turf, where the sun fell in brightness that meant comfort to her now as em- phatically as the wavering glitter upon the stream had signified derision of her sufferings when she was very nigh to death. In all their intercourse, Orrin had never spoken words that came so directly from what had once been a heart, as those that stirred the languid pulses and brought iack the fleeting senses of the forlorn creature who lay gasping within his arms--!livid, sodden, almost lifeless. "Darling Jessie! Precious child! Thank Hieaven, I -was in time!" The blue lips were touched by a smile; her eyes un- closed upon his with a look of worshipful love and grati- tude that appealed to meaner elements of his character than those that had prompted his first outhurst. He was himself again as his gaze kindled into responsive softness and fire. "I My love!" he murmured, bending to kiss her. ", May I not call you so for one blessed instant? My only love, and mine alone!" 9-   CFTAP PTE{ xIV. S R. KIRKE and Eunice were still absent when Or- rin paid his second call at the Parsonage that day. He had conducted Jessie home in the forenoon-a drenched and shivering figure, at which -Patsey screeched with terror; stayed long enough to learn from the girl that the preventives he had ordered against cold were administered, and that her young mis- tress was put comfortably to bed, after which he betook himself to the hotel to make the requisite changes in his own apparel. "Miss Jessie hopes you'll stay here, sir," remarked Patsey. "She says you'll find dry things in Mr. Kirke's room. I've just laid 'em out all ready." "I am much obliged to Miss Jessie and to you, my good girl; but I shall run no risk in going down to the village. Say to Miss Jessie' that she will hear from, or see me again before night." Three hours later, a messenger brought a note, inquir-   Fr     - JESSAMNSJ.                203 ing how Jessie was, and if she would be quite able to seQ him in the evening. "For I must return to Hamilton to-morrow,' he added. Jessie wroteone line in reply: "I am up and well. Come whenever you please. Gratefully, J. K." tIis pleasure was to delay the visit until twilight. Per- haps he had a difficult programme to arrange; perhaps he wanted to give Jessie time to recover strength and com- posure, or he may have thought that delay would enhance the value of his society. On the legal principle he had enunciated when Roy's prior engagement was under dis- cussion, we ought to accept his own explanation of his tardiness. "-I could not come earlier," he said very gravely, in reply to Jessie's faltered gratitude and fears that he had suffered from the morning's adventure. "t You needed rest and quiet, and I have been unhinged all day-men- tally, I mean. Don't thank me again! You don't know how like mockery phrases of acknowledgment from you to me sound. Sit down: You are still weak and nervous. You are trembling all over." If she was, it was not from cold or debility. He placed her in an arm-chair, brought a shawl from the hall, and folded it about her; turned away abruptly, and walked the room in a silence she had neither words nor courage to break. The piano stood open as he had left it in the morning. He stopped before it on his tenth round, seated himself, and began a prelude. Then lie sang the ballad she had crooned in the amber sunset, so many, many   204         JE$fSAMNE. months ago! while he listened without, and tore the hearts out of Eunice's roses. He gave the first verse with tenderness that was ex- quisite; rendered the musing ecstasy of the dream with beauty and expression that thrilled the auditor with deli- cious pain. This deepened into agony under the passion- ate melancholy of the last stanza: "Soon, o'er the bright waves'howled forth the gale, Fiercely the lightning flashed on our sail; Yet while our frail barque drove o'er'the sea, Thine eyes like loadstars beamed, Love, on me. Oh, heart, awaken! wrecked on lone shore! Thou art forsaken! Dream, heart, no more!" He came back to wthere she sat-all bowed together, and quivering in every limb-and knelt before her. "Jessie, I have dreamed, and I am awake. I am here l to-night, to ask you to forgive, not only the rash, pre- 1 sumptuous words --spoke this morning, but the feeling that gave them  birth. I have loved you froln the moment of our first meeting. You and Heaven are my witnesses how I have striven with my unwarrantable pas- sion,-how, persuaded that the indulgence of this would' be a rank offence against honor and friendship, I resisted by feigned coldness your innocent wiles to win the good- will of Roy's relative. I deluded myself, for a time, writh the belief that I could control the proofs of my affection within the bounds of brotherly regard. You best know lhow) when your faith in the truth of your accepted lover was shaken, I became his champion; how conscientiously and laboriously I have pleaded his cause with you; tried to be faithful to the trust he had reposed in me;-.how, when I had nearly betrayed myself in an unguarded   O              tTM8A^ MNE. ir Io05 moment, I endeavored to dissipate any suspicions that llmy imprudence might have awakened in your mind. Again and again I have avoided you for days and months to- gether; punished myself for my involuntary transgression against my friend by denying myself the sight of that which was dearer and more to be desired in my esteem than all the world and heaven- itself; have shut myself into outer darkness from the light of your eyes and the sound of your voice. The fruit of the toils, the anguish, the precautions of more than a year, was destroyed to-day I; ' by one outhurst of ungovernable .emotion. "I shall dream no more, dear! I solemnly vow this on my knees, while I beg you to say that-you do not de- spise me!" The bowed head was upon his shoulder now, and she was weeping. He put his arm about her, and held her close, while lie prayed her to be comforted. "I have cost you many painful thoughts, and not a few tears since the day when you told me the story of: old David Dundee, over there in the window," he said, sadly. "It would have been better--much better for you had you never seen or heard of me. These tears are all for me, I know. :But, indeed, darling, I am not worthy of one of them. They make me feel yet more keenly what a villain I must seem to you." "Don't say that!" she burst forth. "If you are un- worthy in your own sight, what must I think of my con- duct? You were under no vow; had professed to love no other, had entered into no compact in the. name of God, to be constant to one-one only-while life en- dured; a compact you called as sacred and binding as marriage. I loathe myself when I think of my fickleesse    206        JESS9A INE. and falsehood. I do not deserve to receive thie love of any true man. There is, at times, a bitter'tonic in the idea that I may be better worth Roy Fordham's acceptance than I would be of anllother's who had never deceived the trust of the woman who loved him." She sat upright, and laughed, in saying it. "We-he and H-could not upbraid one another on the score of inconstancy." "I will not have you depreciate yourself. You have been true to the letter of your vow. There' are sortme feelings that defy control. Listen to me, dearest," sit- ting down by her. "This is a world of mismatched plans,--of blighted hopes and fruitless regrets. But the wise do not defy Fate. They look, instead, for the sparkle of some gem amid the ashes of desolation. Let us be brave since we cannot be hopeful. I can never forget you,--never cease to think of you as the dearest and no- blest of women. The memory will be more to me than any possession in the gift of Fortune. No change of ex- ternal circumstances can make us less to one another than we are now, while to the world we can never be more. Nothing is further from my wishes or designs than to weaken your regard for the strength of a compact so sol- emn as that which binds you to your betrothed. He is a good man, and he will cherish you-'kindly and faithfully. It may be a hard saying, but we are dealing in no mock reserves now, love; and however weakly my heart may shrink from pronouncing the doom of my happiness, I ought not to disguise from myself or you the truth, that, as he has done nothing since your betrothal to forfeit your es- teem, you should fulfil your promise whenever he shall claium it."             n   " Which he may never do "Jessie interrupted the forced calmness of the argument. "I heard a terrible story a month ago-one that has driven sleep from my eyes for whole nights since. Did you ever hear that my mother was insane for many years before she died?" It was too dark to see her features, but Orrin felt the strong shudder that ran over her; saw the gesture that seemed to tear the dreadful secret from her breast. She went on wildly. "That the loving words and caresses, the recollection of which has fed my heart from my babyhood, the tales and songs and sketches that were my choicest pleasures then, were the vagaries of an un- settled mind; that she knew nothing aright after I, mis- erable little wretch! was born! Not even her own and only child! That, through all these years I have been wor- f ^shipping a beautiful myth! I never had a mother! Oh I that I had died while I still believed in her!" The cry of the last sentence was of hopeless bereave- ment, and the specious actor beside her sat appalled at the might of a woe beyond his conception. She resumed before he could reply. "I ought never to marry! Accursed from the begin- ning, I should finish. my shadowed life alone. Y- ou talk of the gifts of Fortune. The best she can offer me now are quiet and obscurity. I have written all this to Mr. Fordham. He knows, by this time, that I am a less de- sirable partner for his fastidious and untainted self tlian was the poor girl whose only crime was that her sister had died of consumption,-that a deadlier malady is my birthright!" "You have written this to Roy!" exclaimed Orrin, in 'i.]i  . : ?]    208         JESSAM'V'E. stern earnest. "Without consultation witl your sister or father -" "Why should I consult them? Itaving deceived me for twenty years or more, they would not be likely to tell me the truth now. The story came indirectly to me, from the daughter of my mother's nurse, who lived, here herself as a servant when I was born. Afterward I saw . and talked with the woman myself. Nothing -but the whole truth would satisfy me. Her account was clear and circumstantial. There is no mistake." "The woman is a lying gossip-a malicious or weak- minded slanderer. You have acted hastily and most un- wisely!" Orrin said, in seriousness that commanded her attention. "This tale is not a new one to me. Your sister informed me that there was such a figment in cir- culation before you went to Mrs. Baxter." He rehearsed Eunice's description of her step-mother's invalidism, softening such portions of it as might, he feared, tend to feed the daughter's unhealthy fancies. "Your father and your family physician will tell you that her disease was physical. Her low, nervous state and hysterical symjptoms were concomitants to this, as were her indisposition to see strangers, and inability to go abroad. It is your duty to write this explanation to Roy.

"For the sake of your mother's memory I " he urged, gently. "The mother who, you are again persuaded, both knew and loved you." She was still for a moment. "'You are rlight," she said then. It would be base to screen my faithlessness at the expense of her reputa- tion. I am cowardly-but indeed, indeed, it is not an easy task to undeceive him. He trusts me implicitly! If you had read his letters! And I do still value his esteem. I believed in him so long, you know. 'But I will tell him all! It is just that I should be spared no humiliation!" To Wyllys this was sheer raving, yet it sounded dan- gerous. "What do you mean a " he queried, in an altered tone. Instead of replying, she hid her face in her hands --(how well he remembered the old action!)-and mnoaned. He touched her shoulder, less in caress than admoni- tion, as he asked, "Tell him what? Why do you speak of humiliation?"  "Because he still believes in me, I tell yo u! ie will scorn me when I confess that my heart has changed- that I can never love him again, as I fancied I did once!" she whispered, as if ashamed to say it aloud. j "He will cast me off-free me at once and forever." The temptation was powerful, and the Thug yielded to it, without a struggle, . "And if he should, darling? What then?" he said, tightening his arm about her waist.   210        JESSAXINE.1 "You should not ask me!" in a yet lower whisper. Had the dusk allowed, she might have seen a smile of triumph upon his face; an involuntary uprearing of the head as from the binding of the bay of victory about his brows. In affections and in spirit, she lay at his feet --her love confessed, her destiny in his power. Did he wish, for one insane instant, that his acting were reality, that, with clean heart and hands, he could fold her in his embrace, and call her by the name which is the seal and glory of loving womanhood? make her his honored and beloved Wife a We are all human, and there may have gaped in that one wild second, an hitherto dnnsuspected joint in his ha-r- ness of unscrupulous egotism. If this were so, he con- quered the weakness before he again spoke. "Jessie, this is sheer madness! My beautiful angel! why have you made me love you only that both :,our hearts should be bioken at last? Do you know what you are doing? Do not injure yourself fatally in the es- timation of all your friends by cancelling this-engage- menit. Your father has talked much to me of the com- fort it is to him. He loves and honors Fordham; is happy in his old age in the anticipation of giving you into his keeping. -This will be a crushing blow to his pride and affection. And Fordham! you do not com-r prelend what a terrible thing his anger is. I, who have seen him aroused, warn you not to make him your life- long enemy.

He knew the signs of her mood, and that the sharpest of the struggle between a ^her will and his was to come. He 'made ready his last shaft. u "Leave things as they are! If I plead earnestly, it is because there is so much at stake. For me, as for you! Do not tempt         me to perjury and dishonor. to keep my integrity by holding fast to your own!

By and by, you-both of Is-will learn quietness of soul, if not content, and nobody surmise- the secret of the locked heart-chambers which are consecrated to one another." "Perjury! dishonor!" repeated Jessie, bewildered. "By what oath are you bound? I do not understand!  "You have heard no report, then, of the business which brought me to Dundee?

"I want the matches! Ah, here they are!" She struck one, the blue flame showing a ghastly face above it, lighted the lamnp, and motioned Orrin to a seat opposite her own, at the centre-table. "-Now!' she said, interlacing her fingers upon the table, and leaning over themn in an attitude of attention. "Go on with what you were saying."  * If she had expected himn to show embarrassment, slihe was foiled. He put his hand upon hers before lle began, and although she drew it back, he felt that it was clay-cold and judged rightly that his real composuremvould outlast her counterfeit. "What could I do" he said, beseechingly. "You were lost to ine as surely as though you were already married or dead. If I am to blame for obeying the reckless impulse to double-bar the door separating us-to divide myself from you by a gulf so wide that expee- tancy, desire, and hope would .perish in attempting to cross it, you are scarcely the one to upbraid me for the deed. More marriages are contracted in desperation than from mutual love. I said: 'If I am ever cured, it will be by this means.' Miss Sanford was not unpropitious to my advances. I will not insult your common-sense by pretending that her evident partiality flattered or attracted me-muchl less that I ever felt one throb of tenderness for her. Since I could never love another woman, what difference did it make who bore my namne and: kept my house? It were better-so I reasoned-to marry one whose supreine, self-love would prevent her from divining my indifference and its cause, who was shallow-hearted, insensitive, and obtuse of wit, than one who, gauging my   II         JESSAMTE.  .       g213 1   feelings by her own, would expect a devotion I could not tmffei I1- 'im   "But I cannot talk of Miss Sanford and myj new bonds, here, and now!

If I could forght the mad, wicked dream that 11divides me fromn that season of purity and gladness, I would peril my soul to do it! You speak of the sanctity of my engagement; of the integrity that ibids you hold X Ufast to yours. We will pass over the first.

And to crown the injury you have done me with ins;ilt, you ad- jure me to save you from temptation to perjury by heap- ing lie upon lie, in continuing to assert by actions, if not by direct protestation, that I love a man to whom I am indifferent. You have sold yourself for Hester Sanford's millions. You would have me sell myself, soul and body, for expediency and convenience-and to avert Roy Ford- ham's lasting enmity. That is the case, stripped of senti- mental verbiage." "Jessie!"  "I have no affection for him, or for any one else! TNo faithl! no hope!" she pursued, towering above him like a lost but menacing spirit. ' You saved my life this morning.. .ou make of that benefit a wrong to-nlight, by robbing life of all that it held of sweetness and comfort; by showing me what a coarse bit of gilded clay Hpoor fool! have worshipped. I wish you had let me drown!" "Jessie! are you mad?" He had .arisen with her, and would have drawn nearer to her side, but she waved him off. There was a terrible beauty in her wrath that fascinated him, in spite of her cutting words.                   "  "I was a happy, trustful child when you crossed my ,path. I am a hard, bitter, suspicious woman-and the ' chlange is your work. You have humbled me forever in my own eyes, by letting me into the dark secrets of my instability and idiotic credulity. I care'not What others think of me. I shall write to Mr. Fordham before I sleep, and release him; if be still considers himself bound to me, shall tell him plainly that my love is dead-and my heart!"      -' -               -  ;,   JEWS A KP I'.    .   1. 0 l"You will judge me more mercifully, and yourself more justly one day, Jessie. Your self-reproaches pain me more than do your vituperations against myself. Nothing you can say in your present mood can alter my k   feelings for you. You have had much to try you, to-day, my poor child! When you are cooler, you will retract- mentally at least-the charges you have brought against one whose heart is now-and always will be-your own. You know me better than you think. I can wait for time and your sober reason to right me. Implacable as I -know Fordham to be, under his impassive demeanor, he will be more lenient to what he will esteem my breach of trust-the wrong I have done him--when once lie has heard my defence, than you are at this moment. "You suppose, then, that I aam going to lodge a com- plaint against you?" she said, contemptuously. "I shall not mention your name. I should be ashamed to own who was the cause of my folly. You have nothing to dread from your cousin's anger." And, although his last remark was a " feeler," designed to elicit such an assurance, this speech stung him more sharply than had the volley of invectives that preceded Mr. Kirke and Eunice did not return until midnight. Jessie had the evening to herself, and the letter toERoy was sent to the post-office before she went to bed. It was short and decisive to unkindness: "When I wrote to you, last week," was the uncere- mIonirons commencement-- 'I said that I would await your reply before sending another letter. I believed that the information contained in the former would be the  means of terminating our engagement. I have learned   216         JESSA TT7E.' since that the story was a malicious or idle exaggeration. My mother died, as she had lived, a sane woman. But this matters little so far as our relation to one another is concerned. Another, and an insuperable obstacle to our union, exists in the change of my feelings toward your- self. If I ever loved you--I think, sometimes, I never did-I love you no longer. Months of doubt and suffer- ing have brought me to the determination to confess this without reserve. I offer no extenuation of my fickleness. I ought to have remained constant, but I have not. May [.1 you choose more happily and wisely in the future! "I write this without conference with my father or sister,-in the knowledge, also, that my change of purpose !, and prospects will be a sorrow and a surprise to both. : ' But I cannot hesitate or draw back. I need hardly say that I have entered into pledges with no one else. No one desires that I should, or seeks to win my affections. It rests with you to give me the release I ask of your generosity and humanity, or to hold me to the letter of my bond. If, having learned the extent of the change that has come over me since I gave it, you insist upon the fulfilment of my promise, I shall submit to your de- cision. "Foreseeing what your action will be, it only remains for me to add that your gifts and letters await youir order. "JESSAMNE KIRKE." ' f * ,44;   CTTCHAPTER XV. HE September nights were cool among the moun- tains, and as Mr. Kirke and his elder daughter * drove home through the moonlight, between eleven and twelve o'clock, from the visit of mercy they had been paying on the other side of the ridge, there were white blankets of mist upon the meadows, and filling up the valleys along which their route lay. The fire was out in the kitchen, and Patsey had been asleep for two hours and more, having made up her mind that her master would not return until the marrow. There was still a light in Jessie's chamber, and she came down, wide-awake and dressed, to admit the travellers. The servant man slept in a room  over the stable, and, after calling to him two or three times without arousing him, the worthy clergyman took pity upon his weariness after his hard day's work, and groomed his horse himself. Eunice exclaimed at the dampness of his overcoat in -helping him remove it, and Jessie-instructed in such  1 1   L8        J ESSAl ZIN U. Ppliances to health and comfort by her watery ad- enture, the telling of which she reserved for a more )nvelient season--prescribed gtlass of brandy-and-water.   IKirke needed nothing except a night's rest, he as- ared tlem both; pincled Jessie's cheek, ill kissing her  g(ood-night," and rallied her- upon her anti-temperance ? roclivities, then ascended to his chamber. He came  - own late to breakfast, the next morning; owned that leep had proved obdurate to hs wooing; that he bhad  , ad sonething very like 1an ague during the night, and  lat it was a violent headache which deprived llin of ,ppetite. When he arose from table, Jessie coaxed him, allnost n the old winsome way he could never resist, into the   [ ,arlor; made imm lie upon the sofa; tucked a shawl  awarrely about his shoulders, and sitting down of her own accord to the piano, played plaintive, soothing airs until he fell asleep.                   A This was the beginning of the spell of fever that,  within twelve hours, laid him upon his bed, and which, ten days later, assumed a typhoid form.          i His daughters were his nurses, by day and' night Offers of -watchers poured in from the few gentle and  ? the many simple who were his parishioners and neigh- bors; but the sisters courteously and gratefully declined tieln, all. Their patient was all-deserving of the narne, and needed no other care than they could give him. He slept much, and suffered little pain, and their light household tasks allowed one or the other to be constantly with him. Thus, to the kindly applicants; while to each other and their parent they said that love would not allow them to delegate a duty so dear and pious even to ,   the true friends who sought to divide their labors. No man ever had more tender and gentle custodians. There was no perceptible difference in the assiduity and skill of the two, but visitors were unanimous in the expression of the opinion that their anxious vigils told more visibly upon Jessie than upon her sister. She wasted almost as rapidly as the sick man, while her eyes were settled in their mournfulness, and she seemed to forget how to smile days before the physician expressed any doubt as to the sequel of her parent's illness. He had been confined to his room three weeks, when, on the morning of the 27thI of September, Jessie met the doctor on the stairs, as she was carrying iin a bowl of beef tea she had just made. "Alh, doctor! I did not know you were here!" she said, more cheerfully than lie had heard her speak 'for several days, unless when within her father's hearing. " Papa is more comfortable--is he not ? " " ie is more quiet, certainly. Can I see you for a moment, my dear, when you have taken that in ? I shall wait for you in the parlor." He spoke very gravely, averting his eyes as he finished; and hope wePnt suddenly and completely out of the daughter's heart. She bore the basin carefully and steadily into the chamber, up to the bedside of the patient, and called his name clearly: "Papa, dear, will you take a little of this for me?" She watched him narrowly as he aroused himself to respond. "He sleeps all the time, to-day," whispered Eunice. There wvas a dull glow in his half-open eyes, and he    220 .       JESSAMNEN .  put his hand to his head, confusedly, staring in his1 younger daughter's face, as she repeated her request. . - "It is Jessie, papa! You have been dreaming, and  are not yet awake. Here is your beef tea. May I give  you a spoonful or two?"            ^* "I thought you were your mother, child!" he said,   smiling faintly but lovingly at her. "I was dreaming,  as you say."                      a She fed hiln as she would an infant, but: he would take only a few spoonfuls of the nourishment, turned his face away, and fell asleep again instantly.    j The doctor's delicate and unenviable duty was half done for him before she joined him in the lower room. "You consider my father worse." was the address  with which she opened the interview. "I grieve to say that I do." . "Can nothing be done for him in"   . - He hesitated. "I am answered!" she said, hastily. "Don't shelter yourself behind the hateful, worthless subterfuge about hope ceasing only with life. Tell me, instead, how. long-)"  The rest of the sentence was beyond her powers of utterance. But she did not succumb in aspect, after the wordless struggle died away in a quiver -of the un- moistened lips. She was very white, but very still. The doctor congratulated himself upon the sagacity that had led him to choose this one of the twain as the recipi- ent of his unwelcome intelligence. Jessie was his fav- orite, and he had always contended that hers was the stronger, as well as the more sprightly nature of the two. Since she was so collected-so well prepared for the sad J   probability-if not the fell certainty-he could be en- -tirely frank. "The symptoms are of general congestion," he said. "If this should advance rapidly, we cannot hope to have him with us more than twenty-four hours, at the utmost. I shall return, presently, with Dr. Trimrnble. But his verdict will, I think, coincide with mine.  The indica- tions are distinct. Your father will probably be uncon- scious much of the time, and suffer little, if at. all. --No one can doubt his fitness for the great change. I have  known him for over thirty years, and I can testify that. he has walked humbly and closely with his GOD.  Hed has instructed you so carefully, Jessie, my dear, that -you  do not require to be told where to look for consolation, for grace, and strength, in this trying hour-k-" A motion of prohibition that had in it none of the grace of entreaty, checked his formula.          - "You will not be long absent?" asked a voice from between the- rigid lips. The circles under her eyes were blacker and broader .  each second. "I shall be in again as soon as I can find Dr. Trimble. You had better take Miss Eunice -into your confidence without delay. She might think it strange-might take      : it hard if anything were to happen, you know---" "Yes! I know 1"           . . . That shut his mouth, and rid her of his presence.-  The day was warm for the season-so sultry that the cirrus clouds swimming in the blue ether, looked soft to ' April tearfulness.

HIad Nature swooned all over the broad earth ? Was there nothing real left in creation save the fact of her great woe ? " My father is dying ! she said, aloud and distinctly. And, again--" I suppose this is What people mean when they talk of not realizing a sorrow !" 'As- if aught but overwhelming appreciation of the might of a present calam;niy could crush the heart into deadness. She was picking the faded leaves from the creepers, and crumbling them into dust, when. Eunice came iln. Jessie's protracted absence after the conference with the doctor had excited -her apprehensions, and she stole dowen, while her father slept, to inquire into the cause. Inl- measurably relieved at sight of her sister's attitude and occupation, she smiled as she aroused her from her rev- erie. c"I could not think what had become of you, dear! What does Dr. Winters think of fatlier ?9 "Sit down, Eunice, and I will tell you! " said Jessie, dreamy pity in her eyes, but no change in her hard, hol- low voice. Eunice sank into the nearest chair laying her hand quickly upon her heart. " You cannot mean--' "That he is dying?    Yes!" interrupted the other; and in the same awful composure, she repeated the doctor's verdict, verbatim. " Now "-she concluded--" I will go back to him. You may come presently, when you have had time to think over the matter."   The beryl eyes were washed with many tears before they again met Jessie's across the sick-bed, but; after that, Eunice bore herself bravely. IIour after hour, they sat in the hushed upper, chamber, facing their nearing, desolation, without a plaint or an audible sigh. Below stairs, all was silent as the grave. Paisey, with an in- definable idea that the house should be set in cr der for the coming of the grim guest, had dusted the furniture, set back the chairs in straight rows agaifist 'he walls in parlor and, dining-room, and closed all the blinds on the lower floor; made her kitche n neat as Miss Eunice could have wished; then seated herself upon the upper  step of the side porch, her arms wrapped in her clean apron. Jessie's orders were positive that no one besides  the doctors should be admitted, and as the servant's look- ;, out commanded the front gate, she intercepted the many  - . callers who flocked to the Parsonage, at the swift rumor  ; of the pastor's extreme illness. "We will keep him to ourselves while he stays with  us!" the younger sister had answered the other's fear   :: lest this proceeding should give offence to " the people."  "He has belonged to therm for thirty years. At the last, - we may surely claim him!" "But they love him  dearly!" expostulated Eunice. "He is their spiritual father and guide1."  "He is our all/" was the curt reply, and Eunice forbore to argue further.  In the midst of her grief, she was slightly afraid of   J Jessie. The wide eyes that were caverns of gloom; the    : i tuneless accents that never shook or varied, cowed her into quiet and obedience.             ,    " There was little to be done. The sick man slept-if     :   224         JESSA MrE.-. it were sleep-except when aroused to take medicine or food. At these periods, he recognized his children, and spoke coherently, although briefly. His kind heart and gentle breeding were with him to the end. His utter- ances were of thankfulness for the services they rendered, and love for those who bent over him, that not a word should be lost of that they felt, at each awakening, might be the last sentence they should ever hear from him. He spoke once intelligibly and calmly of the nearing separation. '1 I am going fast!" he said to Eunice, who was lifting his head upon her arm that she might adjust the pillow. "The Father is very good. The 'precious blood' avails -even for me-for me! I go empty-handed, but rich --for there is the ' unspeakable gift! '"Closing his eyes he murmured softly to himself. Eunice bowed her ear, and held her breath to catch the words. "' The token was an arrow, with the point sharpened by love, let easily into the heart! ' GOD is good-very good!" It had been the testimony of his whole life. "Jessie, dear! my little girl! you are wearing your- self out for me!" he said, at another time. "I wish Roy were herel  But HIs will be done! I1E knows my darling's needs-her temptations-her trials. Like. as a Father pitieth his children, dear! And it is true! Recollect that I told you so, this-and when-andlhow!  She was to recollect it in the Father's good time. Now the words meant little, after she. had heard the dying parent's wish for lRoy's return. She said something in her own heart that was like a thanksgiving that her   J-ESWSAXTMWE.       225 father was spared the one pang which the coming of the ,man he would have her marry, would bring,-that the sea rolled between them.; "We shall be cared for, Papa!" she replied, quietly. "I know! The promise is sure," and he - slept again, like a child at even-time upon the mother's breast. "The 'great peace' is his I said Eunice, in pious gratitude. Jessie was mute. So the afternoon went by, and the-shortening twilight of Autumn drew on apace. The shutters of the southern windows were'unclosed to admit the air which evening had not made raw. The fleecy clouds were packed in a cumulose mass upon the horizon, and this began to rise in. portentous majesty, as the sun set behind it. Dun,- while day lasted, with ragged, brassy edges, it darkened and thickened as Jessie watched it from her seat at the bed-head, into a banner of blackness absorbing the light from the rest of the heavens, and blotting out the earth from her sight. The silence was breathless. Not an insect chirped or leaf rustled. Even the pine boughs were motionless. The mill wheel was still; the roar of the waterfall was the only sound abroad under the inky sky. The sisters could no"longer -see each other, but all the waning light in the room seemed concentred upon the pallid face between them. The effect of the pale radiance and the brooding quiet- about them was weird -unearthly.' Eunice could bear it no longer. rj "I will bring the night-lamp!" she said, rising. She had hardly reached the foot of the staircase, when Jessie heard the garden-gate shut, and steps upon the gravel-walk leading to the kitchen; next, a stifled 10* ,   226'     .   JESSAMNE. scream from Patsey, and a low, manly 'voice in rebuke or reassurance. Listening, as for her life, the deadly cold of hands and feet creeping up to her heart, she caught a faint exclamation from Eunice; then, tLe cautious tread of feet in the hall to the parlor-door, which was shut behind those who went in; after which all was quiet again. For one mioment, the'darkness was Egyptian, and the night more freezing than winter. The'watclher struggled to arise, to raise her hands to her madly throbbing head, but a dull paralysis was upon her limbs. It was not more than three minutes, but it seemed an hour, before will asserted its sway so far as to call back the blood in a tingling rush to the heart and extreminties. Her trial was at hand. This-the cooup de grace- of the appointed tor- ture-was not to be spared' her, and she awaited it dumbly. But for the moveless face upon the pillow be- side her, she must have rushed away to hide herself in 'thicket or cave-perhaps in the river-bed from which , she had been rescued so lately. That she could not leave. Her father slept on, the pale, unearthly glimnzer- ing abiding still upon the broad brow and noble features. He was beyond the reach of earthly solicitude-the, swimming and buffeting, the toil and anxiety, were for- ever overpast; his feet already touched the solid ground. He was very far off from her-bruised, struggling, con- demned to endure the consequences of her own and another's wrong-doing. A weary season of sickness and dread elapsed ere Eunice enteied with the lamp. She put it down upon a stand in a distant corner, came around to Jessie's side, and stooped to listen toiher father's breathing before she spoke.

"There is some one down stairs who wishes to see you, dear," she said, laying her hand upon her sister's, to sup- port her in case she should be overcome by the great joy in store for her. "Some one you will be glad and thank- ful to meet again! o "Is it Roy Fordham?. asked the hard voice, while Jessie did not start or stir. Eunice saw that her prefatory measures were thrown away. "It is! He sailed a fortnight earlier than he expected; arrived in America but yesterday. Dear sister! our Heavenly Father has sent him to us in our sorest need. He is waiting, love!- "Then let him come up. I shall not leave this room." ?;"' i 4,        CTT APTER   XV 1. S  VERY object in the diily lighted chamber seemed, to Jessie's strained eyes, to stand out with painful distinctness, as her long-absent lover entered. Most clearly of all, she saw his familiar figure; noticed even the full beard and gray travelling- suit, while he crossed the floor toward her. She arose, mechanically, and went forward a step to meet his fleet, noiseless advance. "My own one! my precious darling!" He had her in his arms before she could resist, if she had meant to do so. There were fears in his eyes and voice as he kissed her, and he held her closely, warmly, as a mother would a suffering child. She undid his embrace with fingers strong and chill as steel. i, My father is very ill!" she faltered, and retreated to his pillow. Disturbed by the movement and sound of his name,   JESAMNE.         229 Mr, Kirke awoke. The recess in which his bed stood was in partial shadow, but his gaze rested at once upon Roy, and he tried to lift his head. "Is that the doctor?" Jessie replied: "No, Papa! It is Mr. Fordham.'" Instead of welcoming him, the sick man looked heav- enward, and his lips -moved in prayer. Only the daugh- ter who had crept nearest to him, interpreted the burden of his thanksgiving. "ORD! now lettest THOU THY servant depart in peace!" When he moved, it was in an effort to hold out his arms to the returned voyager.    "Roy! dear, dear son!"  Roy took the emaciated hands in his, with one answer- ing word. "Father!" -"Leave us for a little while, my children!" said the dying voice. "We have much to say to one another, and the time is short!" He was obeyed; Eunice going to her room, to weep and pray in mingled gratitude and sorrow; Jessie fly- ing down the stairs into the hall, thence out into the gar- den. The sky was one expanse of cloud by this time. The wind moaned fitfully in the tree-tops; brought down showers of dry leaves into her face and upon her un- covered head. They whispered drearily tol her as they hurtled by and crackled under her feet, and each thicket had its sigh of desolation. She heard and felt all-her soul in unison with the night and its voices of woe. She   }30      -   JESSAMNE. had fled from her father's presence, feeling like one accursed, forsaken by GOD and man. The return for which the dying saint's praise had gone up to heaven, was the event she had anticipated with shame and terror that. made her long to bury herself in the wilderness or the grave, to escape the sight of him whom she had deceived. To him, her father was now bequeathing her -his dearest earthly treasure. Would Roy let him, indeed, depart in peace, or would his stern sense of truthfulness and honor impel him to a revelation of her perfidy,? True, he had taken her in his arms and kissed. her, but she had received this as his farewell, not his salutation;'-seen in it the resistless overflow of the old- time fondness at sight of her and her affliction. Better a thousand times better-that lhe had not come until the eyes that had lighted into gladness at sight of him were sealed in death, than to plant thorns in the painless pillow of the death-bed by relating how she had betrayed the trust of her betrothed, and disappointed her father's hopes. If she could have warned him! If she had had the presence of 'mind to make some sign of caution before. she left them together! Would Roy--" the man of granite "--have mercy? or must her father's last words to her be reproof and not blessing? regret and not thankfulness? Up and down! up and down! she trod the long alley, looking at the faintly illuminated windows of that upper chamber; wringing her hands in her dry-eyed agony, longing yet fearing to hear the summons that should end her suspense. It came at length! Roy's step upon the piazza, and   J"J  A As IAijs.-      21  his call, guarded that it should not reach the sick-room, but audible to her as would be the trunmp of doom. "Jessie! where are you ." -  She went toward him without hesitation. Women have gone to the hall of sentence and to the block in the same way. He met her, guided by her rustling tread among the leaves.               , "This should not be!" he said. "You will be ill next!" iIe led her 'into the house, and to the parlor where   j there were lights.           - ,         : She was not surprised that he did not let her pause  - until they reached the deep window--where she had not sat, for months, until that morning after the doctor left   her. She had not expected a violent outhreak of anger or recrimination; had felt that, even in becoming her    accuser, he could not cease to be a gentleman. Orrin had told her, more than once or thrice, that his ,i kinsman was just to ca!n severity. I He would grant her x  a chance of self-exculpation; would judge her out of her own mouth; .make her rehearse to him the story of her falsehood upon the spot where she had plighted her vow of eternal constancy. And she would meet it all-say      it all, save the name of her tempter-that she was pledged not to reveal-if he would but let her go back the sooner to her father-the father who was dying up- . stairs!  "Don't think me crtiel, dear, or'ungenerous," began Roy, when he had seated her, and himself at her side.   : Had her wretchedness moved him to leniency?  -lHe continued: "But this is no season for useless de-, lays and mistaken reserve. Our dear father is passing :;-j!:!   232'        JESSAMNE. away from us. I met the doctor on my way to you this evening. He thinks that he may leave us very, very soon. One moment, dearest, and you shall go to hiim "-for she had started up. "He has made a dying request of us- of you and me-the fulfilment of which depends upon you. I say nothing of the eager happiness with which I have given my consent to the proposal-only of the com- fort you can shed upon his last moments by marrying me in his sight within the next hour." No! no! no !" She slid from her seat to her knees, and hid her face, crouching to the floor in horror and humiliation. "I cannot! It would be a sin! a fearful Sill!' Roy would have raised her, but she shrank away from him. "Anything but that! Ask me anything but that!/" she repeated. "It is not I who ask it, dear. Our father has decided what shall be the time and place of our marriage. It is not selfish-much less is it sinful in us to yield to his wish--his last earthly desire. It has been his prayer from the commencement of his illness that he might live to join our hands; give you into my keeping before you should close his eyes. Surely, knowing this, we may not fear to repeat in his hearing the vows we made long ago. in this, our betrothal nook." The simple, sad sincerity of his appeal sounded like pitiless will in the ears of the distracted girl, but she could not gainsay his reasoning. The decision was then thrown upon her! Hers was the power to cast a ray of light upon the even-time of the life which had been to her a constant benefaction, or to cloud it with disappointment.   JESSAMNE.         233 "It is not selfish in us to yield to his wish i" The words stung like venomed sarcasm. Nlot selfish to accept the fate against which her nature--physical and spiritual-had lashed itself into revolt for weary months past! Not selfish to bind upon her neck the yoke of the scorned and iuloving wife I The last thought moved her to action. She dragged herself to her feet, still rejecting his aid, and, for the first time since their meeting, looked into his face. "Did you get my last letter? that in which I asked you to release me from this engagement?" Y JYes." He would have drawn nearer as he said it, but she kept him off-less by her gesture than with her eyes-so un- like the sweet wells at which he used to drink his fill of love! "And knowing all, it is still your wish to marry me!  Think well before you answer. This bond is for life, re- mem ber! and life is long! Oh, how long to the misera- ble!" "This is my answer." Before she could avoid him, he- had gathered her in his arms, had pressed the reluctant head to his bosom. "We have been wedded almost a year and a half already, my Jessie. I am claiming my wife, not my betrothed. Did you imagine that I could be frightened from my hope and my purpose by that morbid little note, written by a half-sick, over-sensitive woman? Recollect! you left the decision to me! If, instead of this, you had ordered me to stay away forever, I should have come to you all the same; have taken you, to the old resting-place and kissed away the gloomy fan- cies that had tempted you to banish me, I know your   234         JESSArNE. heart better than you do yourself-and it is minee! The LoRD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part you and me! "Now, beloved, what shall I say to our father? The minutes are precious." "It shall be as you and he desire. I will tell him this myself," replied Jessie, calming all at once into nmourn- ful composure Roy deemed altogether'natural in the cir- cumstances. "One word more!" detaining- her.  I met Dr. Bax- ter this evening at the station, on his way to pay you a visit, promised, he said, ever since last winter. Stopping at the hotel while the stage set down other passengers, we heard of your father's illness, and our dear old friend, withdcllaracteristic delicacy, would not present himnself- s a stranger-to your sister, in the-circumstalnces. He 're- mT ed at the hotel until I should bring further intelli-  gence:' Am I right in supposing that it is your wish, as well as mine, that he should perform the ceremony which is to make us one in name, as we have long been one in heart? If so, I will go for him without delay.'" "Do what you like-'whatever is best," she. answered, hurriedly. "'By all means, bring Dr. :Baxter here! My father will like to see him." "His arrival just now is providential," said Roy' walk- ing upstairs at her side, his arm still supporting her. "There is light, even from the earthward side, upon this dark river, love!" He beckoned Eunice from the sick-room as Jessie went in, exchanged half-a-dozen sentences with her relative to his plans, and ran down the steps lightly and swiftly. He had ordered Mr. Kirke's horse tomle harnessed to his -   s or   V Su/an/ * Ir! 4r tLi E  l buggy before he sought Jessie, and Eunice heard him drive off in the direction of the village by the time she returned to her post. The sisters awaited him and the clergyman where they had sat all day, the one at the right hand, the other at the left hand, of their father. Eunice ventured to suggest to her companion the expediency of making some change in her dress before the ceremony. "I thought perhaps you would like to be married in white," she said, timidly. "I am almost sure Roy would prefer this." "I have not time to dress. I have left himr too long- already," returned Jessie, pointing to her father. She tried to keep her promise of apprising him of her acquiescence in his will, bit was partly baffled by his inl creasing drowsiness. He spoke, it is true, when she told him that she had heard from Mr. Fordham of his request, and determined to gra-nt it, but it was not clear that he quite understood her. "Good child!" he said, with closed eyes. "GoD bless you both!" i " Did " both "mean his daughters or the two who were to be'wedded presently? She could not bring herself to ask. Mr. Kirke lapsed into slumber or stupor, and the room was silent again save for his irregular breathing, showing that his semi-insensibility varied in character from that of the day. Once, Jessie got lip with the remark that it was time to renew the mustard-poultices that stimulated the curdling veins into action, and the pail did the office deftly and mutely. Eunice saw her sister, as she reseated herself, lay her cheek to the almost pulseless hand that 4 -   236         JESSA TmNE. rested on the coverlet, and close her eyes, while her lips were stirred by an inaudible sentence. The observer was thankful for this token of a more subdued and natural frame of mind than the suffering girl had yet exhibited. * It was meet that she should seek the blessing of Heaven upon the union she was about to form, and that thoughts of prayer should be linked with loving ones of her earthly parent. And Eunice, too, prayed in her gentle, pious heart for the happiness of the child she had reared as her own, and for that of the true, fond brother, whose arrival in this their darkest hour, was like a direct answer from on high to the petitions she had offered, during their long days of watching and anxiety. With Roy to console and care for Jessie, the smitten household would be rich even in temporal comfort. Was Jessie praying?. She had proudly flung the charge of perjury at another, saying--"Of this sin, at least, I am innocent." What was the act to which she had given her consent-which the next hour would render irrevocable? It was when this question was forced upon her by some taunting demon, that she kissed the lifeless hand, a-d whispered the formula she had said aloud that morning at the open window, and repeated inly hundreds of times since. "My father is dying!" Since she could not lie down and die in his stead, she would sacrifice the poor hopes of peace that were spared to her from the wreck of her early dreams, to purchase for him what gratification she could still give him. Eunice might well eye her apprehensively, all that day and evening. Many with steadier brains and cooler blood than were hers have been consigned to:insane asylunms. ,   The wind was so loud, the roar of the pine outside the window so continuous, as to drown the sound of returning hoofs and wheels. They were ignorant of Roy's second arrival until he knocked at the chamber-door. Eunice said, "Come in!" and he whispered a few words to her before he approached Jessie. ' Are you quite ready?" he asked, softly. She bowed her head in assent. I-e disappeared for a moment, then came back with Dr. Baxter, Drs. Winters anrid Trimble. The physicians, with difficulty, aroused their patient so far as to swallow the stimulant they administered.- Patsey brought in more lights, and retired, with the doctors, to the back- ground-an interested spectator of the singular scene. " Father!" it was Roy's voice, sonorous yet pleasant, that reached the senses and reason which were fast slip- ping away with life. ' This is Dr. Baxter, of whom you have often heard--Jessie's very dear friend-and whose wife is the cousin of Jessie's mother."  Tile double reference was talismanic.  Mr. Kirke' opened his eyes to their full width-all recognizing in them the glassy stare of dissolution--and tried to move his hand toward the person thus introduced. "He is very welcome!" Dr. Baxter pressed the cold hand between his. "Brother in Christ! we should have met before. We shall meet again. In that safe world there are no crossed purposes or partings. There we shall know even as we are known-of one another and of the MYaster. You are very near the entrance upon that perfect life. I have been sent hither by our LORD to bid you,; GoD speed! on the short and easy journey, and to ask your blessing   23f     -   JESSAMNE.- npon these, our children, who would walk after you, hand in hand. Is it still your wish that they should be mar- ried here beside you, before you go from their sight . " "Yes; by all means!" The emphasis was faint, yet perceptible, and he shut ,his clamny fingers feebly upon those Jessie slipped within them, as she obeyed Dr. Baxter's injunction to join her right hand with that of her betrothed. She felt their loose hold more plainly than she did the warm, strong grasp that signified loving protection, tenderest sympathy. wIt was. a strange, sad rite,-stranger and more, mel- ancholy than burials usually are. The bride's gaze never left the sunken face and closed eyes that rested among the pillows, and her assent to the interrogations put to her was so slight as to create a passing doubt in the mind of the catechist as to whether- she had given any. The mountain storm burst overhead in thunder wind, and rain, as the bridegroom spoke his reverent and stead- fast response, and when the benediction was pronounced, Jessie stooped to kiss her father, apparently forgetful that Roy's was the parfamount right to the token of affection. "Dear Papa! It is yourlittle Jessie! I have done as you wished. Will you not bless me z . The cry sounded in the ear deadened by the death- stupor as a faint and far-off call. Mr. Kirke's eyelids quivered without rising,r and the muscles of the mouth were moved. Then, the gray calm settled down again upon his countenance. "He must speak to me! I must be sure that he hears me-that he understands how I have obeyed him!" said Jessie, frantically. "He muzst!" to the physicians who advanced to the bedside with restoratives.   JESSAMNE.          239 They were useless.  The dying man was beyond the reach of human skill. The lips were parted, the throat did not contract. Dr. Winters shook his head despair- ingly and turned from his old friend and pastor, the un- tasted glass of brandy in his hand. "Ie does not see or hear me!" cried the daughter, throwing up her arms in a passion of despair. "I did it for hin, and he will never know it." She sank to her knees beside the bed and buried her face in the coverings.  Roy leaned over her, and whis-- pered something the rest did not hear. He might as well have addressed her father with words of consolation. When he touched her to recall her attention, she shivered violently, but gave no other sign of consciousness of his presence. I am glad you are here, Mr. Fordham-heartily re-. joiced and greatly relieved," said Dr. Winters, as Roy at- tended him down the stairs. "Your wife needs very deli- cate and judicious treatment just now.  Her whole nervous system is unstrung. I saw it in her manner and eye this forenoon. When the unnatural strain is relaxed, she will break down completely, I am afraid." Mr. Kirke died at midnight. He had noticed no one, and said nothing since his feeble rejoinder to Dr. Baxter's query whether the marriage should proceed, until half- an hour-before lie breathed his last, those about him saw a change in the face that, in stillness and beauty, resembled a fine Greelk mask. Jessie perceived it first; was quick to take advantage of the tinge of color, the tremor of features. "Papa! ' she prayed, raising his head to a resting-place on her arm.  Can you hear me2 .If you can, kiss me.'   The stiff lips moved under the pressure of hers, and a smile, ineffable in radiance and tenderness, remained when the kiss had been given. "You do know me-do you not . " said his daughter, breathlessly. "Who is it that is speaking to you?" All present heard the reply: Ginevra!  q                    I   i CI APTER X V11. HE "breaking down " predicted by Dr. Winters,    . took the form, not of hysterical emotion, as he had  anticipated, but of physical languor and spiritual apathy, which were more alarming. Jessie moved, spoke, and thought like one in a trance; acquies- cing in every proposal made by her sister and Roy;     Ji obeying every request without demur or inquiry. If left  to herself she asked nothing except to be allowed to sit  I or lie- passive for hours together; her great eyes closed or blank; her countenance set in the gloomy weariness that  had marked it from. .the moment her hand left :tirMdead Father's forehead-a look that said she had hene^fOrward nothing to hope for or to fear.  Few husbands would have had tolerance withlthis ex- cessive grief for the loss of a parent, however beloved, .  and worthy of filial attachment. One might search far and long without finding a man whose sympathy with the   i demonstration of this would incite him to warmer love - 1            V ii:   242         JESSAME. and fonder care for her, who, for the time, overlooked his claim to supreme regard in her devotion to a memory. "You could not mourn more bitterly for me!"I once heard a man say in impatient reproach, upon surprising his wife in'fears within a week after she had committed an indulgent parent to the grave. He was a good man, and an affectionate husband, but he could not endure the semblance of a divided allegiance. Had Roy Fordham's love been of this sensitive and exclusive type, it would have been chafed threadbare be- fore the honeymoon was one-tenthh wasted. The new mind 'between them she ignored entirely--not, it was evident, in wilfulness or shyness, but because it had no place in her thoughts; was a matter of no moment in comparison with the event that steeped her whole being in despon- dency. It was well that neither he lner Eunice had any knowledge of the continuous warfare of the summer, the fiercer struggle of that early September day, the morrow of which had brought a fresh sorrow in her father's ill- ness. HHad they comprehe-lded all this, superadded to their fears that her three weeks' watching and its nfinale had seriously affected her nervous system, they would have had small hope of the curative power of Nature and of Love. She was, in reality, insane for the three" days im- mediately succeeding her marriage, if lackl of feeling, thought, and connected memory signify mental aberra- tion. In after years, this period was almost a blank in the retrospect, a confusing dissolving view that defied her scrutiny. While it lasted it was a nightmare from 'which she had not strength to awaken.  When she was led by Roy to take a last look at fer father's face as he lay in his coffin ready to be transported   ESAM. 243 to the church, her eyes were vacant and dry, her features emotionless. "He looks very natural!" she said slowly, like one trying to recall the conventional phrase in such circum- stances. When Eunice bent weepingly to kiss the frozen lips where still lingered the smile of ineffable peace with which he had named his wife, Jessie eyed her with a mixture of wonder and perplexity; and remarking again, Very natural! almost life-like!" turned away, with the airof one who had said and done all that could be required of hier.' In an agony of alarm, Roy soughi Dr. Winters, who had called to inquire after the health of the family, and to see if he could be of service in their affliction. Eunice had taken charge of her sister at night, and reported that what little sleep had visited the latter had been won by the use of anodynes. /Had the physician-asked the bridegroom--a sedative, potent enough to induce slumber for several hours, the after effect of which would not he increased cerebral excitement a Come what might, Jessie mnust not witness the obsequies appointed for that fore- noon. Her mind seemed, to him, to need but a touch to complete its overthrow. While the two gentlemen held counsel, Eunice entered with the welcome news that Jessie had, on leaving the parlor where the remains lay, gone voluntarily to her own room-she having shared her sister's since their common bereavement-thrown herself upon the bed and fallen into a deep sleep. The church-bell was not tolled for the pastor's funeral and a  band of trusty yeomen, stationed fifty yards up and down the road, prevented vehicles from approaching the  * %n   244         JE!88A1fN S. gate of Parsonage or church-yard. The reason was quickly disseminated, and the value of the precaution universally admitted. lMingled with the tears that fell upon the bier of the faithful servant of GoD, were earnest prayers for the restoration of health and reason to the daughter- "the people's" pride and pet as she had been his-the merry, popular " little Jessie," who was known to every household in the parish. Many wistful eyes sought the closed blinds, behind which she lay wrapped in death- like slumber. "The only hope for life and brain!"Dr. Winters liad pronounced, and the dictum was repeated far and near with awed looks andsubdued breath. Within the manse, all was hushed and dark. Eunice sat with the sleeper while the services at the church went forward. "Do not separate us this morning!" was her petition to Roy, iwhotwoulld have taken the post himself. "I have nobody left but her!" She interpreted correctly the meaning of the imperfect sounds that penetrated her seclision-the funeral psalm, the dull tramp of many feet from the front to the back of the church; the awful pause-like no other upon earth-- that told the coffin was sinking to its place-the voice of prayer-the brief, reverent utterances with which the dear dust was committed to the keeping of the Lord of Life, through all the coming ages of Time--then, the muffled tumult of departure. She sat quiet until the end; restrain- ing sob and sigh that the beloved living slofuld not be disturbed; staying her heart upon the Father of the fatherless, the GoD whose goodness the expiring saint had charged his children never to forget.   JESSAMNE.  ,      245 Roy relieved her as soon as the services were over. "Thank you," he said, kissing her with a brother's fond sympathy. "Go now, and leave her to me. I will call you, should you be needed." Alternately, and in company, they watched her until Dr. Winters' third visit that day brought hope that was confidence to their tried souls. :"If she sleep, she shall do well!" said Dr. Baxter, when Roy carried the glad tidings to him, that the stupor had changed to natural slumber. He was sit- ting in the window of Mr. Kirke's study; for a wonder, without book or paper before lim, but absorbed in con- templation of the mountain scenery. "You are wearing yourself ult," he added, observing that Roy's complexion, tanned by the sea-voyage, was fast regaining its natural hue, and that his eyes bore evidence of grief and anxiety. "Jessie is safe in her sister's care, and while she sleeps cannot miss you. Bide here a bit with me "'-he often relapsed into the Scotch dialect- "and refresh yourself by a survey of this picture. I must quit you all to-morrow, and I would have a few words with you before I go." Jessie was alone when she awoke. Eunice had been called to the parlor to see a parishioner from the other side of the mountain who had not heard of Mr. Kirke's decease until that morning, had ridden twenty miles to attend the funeral, and arrived too late. Eunice had been too long the obedient servant of the congregation to hesitate as to the course she should pursue in the dilemma. Jessie slept soundly and peacefully, and EPoy would be back soon. She closed the door noiselessly, and obeyed the summons of' her father's friend.   246        JESSAMNE. Summer zephyrs were coquetting with the sombre pine- branches; summer-scents were stealing up to Jessie's windows from the garden. To such wooing whispers and goodly odors had she awakened many mornings during many years. She mistook the colored light visible through the shutters for dawn; marvelled sleepily that her limbs ached and her head was weary. "It must be time to get up!" she meditated, 'twixt  sleeping and waking. "Yet I am not rested. I have not heard Eunice or Patsey go downstairs." In tossing her arm up to pillow her helad for a second nap, she saw her sleeve. How had she happened to fall asleep without undressing . She sat upright, and tried to remember when/and how she had gone to bed overnight. -ltow queerly ler head felt! "As if it had been dead and was coming to life again!" was her simile. She was at homqe, and in her own room; everything about her was in its usual order. Yet something had happened. What was it? A Bible lay on the stand by the bed. Between the leaves was a handkerchief. She drew it out, and saw- Eunice's name in the corner. How came it there? H lad Eunice sat with her, last evening 2 If so, why a Her feet were oddly numb when she stood up; she was weakl and dizzy as from illness or fasting; but she walked to the door, opened it, and hearkened for movements upon the lower floor. It was so quiet, she heard the droning of a humming-bird mothll-which had come to look for untimely blossoms in- the honey- suckle draping the hall-window. Another sound, almost as monotonous, blended with this-the steady flow of a man's voice talking or reading in the study. Who was   JESSA MNE.   -     24 her father's guest And what hour of day was it It must be morning, since she had just awakened, yet looked and felt like evening. A draught from the open door she had left blew that opposite slightly ajar. Surely, that was Dr. Baxter's voice! lHad she dreamed of his arrival! - A fearful dream, the dim recollection of which made her sick and faint . Sinking to a settee that stood outside the study- door, seeking to stimulate her half-dead brain by rubbing her temples hard, she endeavored to gather the meaning of what Dr. Baxter was saying. He was in the middle of one of the monologues which were sometimes a bore; sometimes a delight. A gleam of amusement flitted over the wan, vacant visage of the eavesdropper as she pictured to herself-still as if she were somebody else and not- Jessie Kirke--the knotted handkerchief she doubted not was on active duty. "Is it consistent with the Divine economy for an im- mortal being to spend twenty-five, fifty, threescore and ten years, in the acquisition of knowledge and expe- rience for which he is to have no use in the world to come? Believe me, they are in grievous error, denying themselves the abundant consolations which the hope of a' continued and -eternal existence should bring, who overlook the plain teachings of the word and the almost divine intuitions of the human soul on this question. Tile Future Life I What is it but the stretching into regions yet unknown to us, into the Eternity of which we bhave but imperfect conceptions, of the life which now is? the Preselt, which is the journey toward the continuing City?. Into that state we shall, it is true, be born as spiritual babes. But not idiots! As the instincts and   248         JESSA MNE. actions of the babe prefigure the disposition and appetites of the man, so the. habits of thought and. feeling, the inclinations and aspirations of the newly disembodied spirit will bear a certain relation to that which it will at length become--the perfect man in Christ Jesus. As hereditary taints and hereditary virtues are reproduced in the mortal babe, we shall find definite traces of our earthly individuality in the heavenly nurseling. And that the proportion which the loftiest attainments of the profoundest philosopher will bear to the infancy of this celestial creature will be less-far less than that which the mere instincts of the earthly infant bear to the wisdom and strength of the adult, I also believe. We shall have to begin with the rudiments of infinite knowledge. But we shall have Eternity in which to learn." Jessie still chafed her forehead, where wrinkles of pained perplexity gathered and deepened, as she tried to put word to word and sentence to sentence. She lost what came next in vainly attelmpting to get the sense of these last sentences. Perhaps she should uunderstand better when she was quite awake. "Such proportion as the seed sustains to the mature plant, the ovum to the living, moving creature, you will tell me--"Dr. Baxter was saying, when she again lent atten- tion to his dissertation. "I grant it. But like produces like in vegetable and animal generation, and why deny the spiritual analogy? What we call Death is but the threshold--and a narrow one-separating the vestibule from the temple. It is all one building--the Life which GOD has given. When I cast off the cumbrous shell I have borne so long that I foolishy fancy'it is myself--a part of my being without which I should be naked, shiv-    ering, and helpless; when it slips from my soul by reason of its own, weight and rottenness, I shall enter upon no new existence. It will be I still-not a different crea- tion. For a moment, perhaps, I may not know what has happened. Thus, I have seen a butterfly trembling with the strangeness of his position, clinging with damp, un- tried wings to the bough that supports the little pendant coffin, now broken--from which he has just. crept. A delicious sense of liberty and space there may be as one breathes more freely in leaving a close room for -the outer air. I shall miss the incubus of the body, and the fleshy desires I have sloughed off with it. Then will dawn upon me gradually-as I have strength to bear the: revelation,that I have passed! Not been made over, mark you! We are nowhere taught that regeneration is a post- hunmous experience. ' He is gone!' some one will say. And perhaps another-' He is dead ' "Dead! I tell you, my friend, I shall be the livest man in that room!  lNot until that hour of glorious emancipation shall I know 'what life is!"    - There was an interval of stillness. Jessie had staggered to her feet. Her eyes, no longer blank, were dilated with intensest and eager inquiry. What did it signify--this talk of death and the life to come. Who was the speak-. er's companion? Her father ' Oh, why did he not speak a Another voice, deeper and sweeter, made reverent re- sponse: "Thanks be too GoD, for His unspeakable gift!": She flung the door widely open; faced the astonished men with the demand, shrieked, rather than spoken: ' Where is he  H He said that! my father!

Where is my father ." Dr. Baxter secured her fluttering hands; looked stead- fastly, yet not sternly, into her eyes. "He may be here, my child I We cannot tell. Be sure he remembers and loves you still, he, who, while in the, flesh, held you so dear. lBelieve this and be still under the mighty but loving hand of GoD!" Her head sank upon his shoulder. "You would not deceive me! You are a good man, and speak the truth always!" she sobbed, excitedly. "Is my father really dead a Oh, I remember it all now!" With the resuscitation of the torpid intellect, came a flood of tears, mingled with anguished exclamations-an hysterical attack that only abated with her strength. By nine o'clock she was asleep, exhausted, but free from fever and the nervous spasms that had made the seizure alarming at first. The danger was tided over, for the present, and ere the rest separated for the- night, Dr. Baxter returned thanks for "the signal deliverance," kneeling between the husband and sister; besought com- fort and peace for the smitten household in fervent, affectionate words, which showed that however -his thought might stray from the subjects to w!lich- his ac- quaintances would hold him, his heart was always in the right place. "I cannot thank you as I should for all you have been to us-all you have done for us!" said Eunice, as they talked of the morrow's parting.   J^tiBS^Ja JL LZV.     ^SV1L "Do not, my dear.! The privilege and the gratitude have been and are mine. : GOD sent me to you. I bless Him for it!" It was after'sunrise when Jessie unclosed her eyes. Eunice's chair was still by her pillow, but it was empty. Her mind was clear. She had no difficulty in recalling how the gentle hands had laid her to sleep; tihe mellow voice read to her from The Book--"A prayer of the af- flicted, when he poureth out his heart before GOD.1" Dear Eunice! her love-tried as it had been by her per- versity and reserve, her late violent and selfish distress- was more precious than ever before. She would arise and share, if she could not lighten, her labors and her bur- dens. As she sat up in bed, she espied upon a lounge near by, a gentleman's dressing-gown. The blood sprang to her cheeks in a burning torrent, for the truth flashed instantly upon her. Roy had asserted his right to the exclusive guardianship of his wife; had sent the weary sister to take .the rest she needed, and himself kept watch over her through the night. There came to her no soft- ening thought of the anxious affection that had held his eyes waking while others slept. She was only angry- desperately indignant that he had dared sit there and watch her without her knowledge or consent. The blind, mad moment passed, she stood, for many more-white as death-thinking Il Then she locked the door. Roy might enter at any instant, or Eunice glide in to ask how she was, and she must be alone while she thought it all out! No mortal eye witnessed the fight of the next hour. The woman-torn and dashed by a legion of pas- sions-verily believed, while they had the. mastery, that she would not survive it. She never told the tale of her        hurts to her dearest earthly friend. It was something she would not renew by relating, even when time had almost worn away the scars. She was made of sterner stuff than she knew. Ere she quitted her chamber, her resolution was taken-every trace of the strife put out of sight. She had " light enough to see the next step."  If she were bound for life against her will and conscience, Roy was basely wronged-and through no fault he had committed against her. If her course were to be joyless-a strait and rou gl path, his was no smoother or more delightsome. Recom- pense him for what she had lost for him, she could not, but she could and she would appear dutiful and resigned. Fordham coming in from the brisk walk in tilhe early morning air by which he had tried to inake up for his vigil, found her in the parlor, arranging the bookls upon bracket-shelves and dusting the rare old china bowl and vases which the sisters let no one but themselves handle. Her breakfast-toilette had been carefully made, contrast- ing strikingly with yesterday's nze4gligk. Her rich hair was braided as she used to wear it, and banded With black ribbon; her white cambric dress was belted with the same, and loops of narrower hung from her mourning brooch. She comprehended all that had happened within the week; accepted the expediencies and proprieties of her position with its sorrows and duties, and he honoared her for it. Her attire showed that she consulted his. taste, wished to be fair in his eyes, and for this he loved her better than ever, if that could be. --He did not know it, but the woman he had wedded never, in her previous or subsequent life, gave another equal proof of strength of mind and purpose, as when, physically faint and   mentally distraught by the frightful ordeals she had already sustained, she lifted this, the heaviest'cross of all, and adjusted it to her shoulders for a lifelong journey.                  '  ' The greeting between them was affectionate on his side-grave upon hers-very quiet on both, as befitted the circumstances of the household. "Ah, Jessie, darling! I am glad you are well enough to be down stairs! But are you not exerting yourself too much?" lie exclaimed at his entrance. And-"I am much better, thank you! entirely able to be about as usual," was the reply, uttered without the , flicker of a blush. 'Tlhen he kissed the cheek that was neither averted nor offered. Dr. Baxter and Eunice appearing, a minute afterward, saw nothing amiss. There may have. been nothing, yet the young husband had looked for a different reception- now that his Jessie was declared to be "quite herself again."  He was a patient man and a considerate, and the secret disappointment was condemned as soon as recognized. This was not the time for love-making-or-this was clearly Jessie's feeling. To oppose her scruple while her grief was so fresh and her nerves unsettled, would be persecution. She deserved all grace and indulgence at his hands, and she should have it. Their life--as theirs was all before them. He would be a help not an em- barrassment, to the orphans. Jessie loved him! Jessie was his wife! That was enough I              *  .'   CHHAPTER XVIII. OY  FORDIIAM   remained ten days longer in Dundee in consequence of an arrangement made by his brother professors by which they divided his duties among them, Dr. 13axter, whose par- tiality for him was proverbial, taking a double share upon himself. The furlough was not accepted by him without misgivings. Hle felt that he ought to be il his place at the beginning of the college session, )ad that to avail himself further of the generous kindness of trustees and faculty, after a year's absence, was an abuse of the same. Dr. Baxter wrote him two strong, short letters to refute this idea, and he found additional solace for his conscience in the discovery that he was needed by the sisters. Eunice and he were joint executors of Silr. Kirke's small property. To Jessie were left her mother's dowry with the accumulated interest; her mothler's picture, and certain articles of jewelry, dress, and furniture, which had been hers. Everything else was Eunice's--a portion had been her. ery   JESSAMEf .        255 that did not nearly equal her sister's, but with which she was more than content. The settlement of the estate was easily accomplished. The just man had no debts, and the few legal papers needful to secure the title of his possessions to his children were in perfect order. At they end of a week the only open question was that of Eunice's residence. Roy had engaged  a house in Hamilton, and was urgent in his desire that she should live with Jessie and himself. The conscientious elder sister hesitated in the knowledge that her income would not support her in like comfort anywhere else. "My inclination leads 'me to follow Jessie," she con- fessed to her brother-in-law. "My sense of duty to my- self and to you makes me doubt the propriety and justice of living in comparative idleness, when, if .I had not the shelter of your roof, I must work to eke out a main- tenance." Which quibble Roy pronounced absurd and far- fetched. "Quite unworthy of sensible Eunice! To say nothing of the manifest unkindness to our poor girl here," he said, as his wife entered the room where he was sitting. "Come here, Love, and convince this unreasonable and sceptical woman that she is indispensable to our happi- ness." Jessie yielded passively to the arm that drew her to his knee. , "What is it . " she asked, listlessly. Roy gave an abstract of the situation. She looked confused -uncertain whether she had heard him aright. It was an effort to understands anything, sometimes. Roy and Eunice glanced from her to one   2c6         JESSAMNNE. another. They saw that dazed look, heard her stammer oftener than either liked; dreaded nothing else so much as they did the repetition of the scenes attending their father's demise and burial. "Of course she will live with me-with us, wherever we go!" she rejoined. "Unless you object "-to Roy. "But I was under the impression that you wished it,- that the matter was definitely arranged.' "It is, now!" said Roy confidently, and Eunice did not dispute it. There was a clear, more constant light in her eye, now that the responsibility of the decision was removed from her, and the step determilled upon without her vote. The prospect of separation from her sister was very painful, and there were other reasons ly -Hamilton should be a pleasant home to them all. This was her representation of the case to herself and to the friends who lamented losing hler. -"Mourning is very becoming to Miss Kirke!' was the usual remark of these visitors upon leaving the Par- sonage. And--"She is ieally amost lovely woman. What will the congregation do without her?" Roy was to leave them for a fortnight, to attend to his classes, and forward the preparations for the reception of his bride. When all was ready for their removal, he would return to superintend the sale of furniture, stock, etc., then take the, sisters back to town with him. t My- family!" he said, in forced gayety, on the morn- ing of his departure. "I assure you, my consequence in my own eyes is mightily augmented by the acquisition of my new honors."   JESSAMNEI .        257 Eunice called up one of her slow, bright smiles in acknowledgment.  Jessie appeared to heed the com- pliment as little as she did the parting, that drew tears from her sister's eyes and choked Roy'sfarewelldirec- tions as to the care she must take of herself while he was away.                    , "I shall write to yon every day, my sweet wife," lie promised. "And it will not harm you--it may help you to while away the time, if you can scribble a few lines to me in return, now and then." "If I can I will. If you wish it I will write certainly. ]But don't expect to hear every day from me. There's very little here to write about, you know,' answered Jessie. Eunice Nvondered, to reverent admiration, at the love and forbearance with which he thanked her for the con-, cession. They attended him to the porch. The morning was foggy, and Roy put Jessie back in the shelter of the hall- door. "It is too daminp for you out here! Don't stand there to see me off!" Eunice--maybe Ire-would have been better satisfied had she disregarded the loving command. As it was, when he waved his hand from the carriage-door, Eunice stood alone in the doorway. Yet she was sure Jessie did not mean to be ungracious.; that she was not really insen- sible to the devotion of the husband of her choice; that but for the stay of his presence she must have gone mad or died in her overwhelming grief. What she mistook for unwifelike reserve was an incessant effort to control her- self, to play the woman and not the child. It was best      258         JESSA N'E. not to interfere even so far as to hint that Roy's kindest schemes for her comfort and pleasure as often as not were unnoticed by verbal thanks or grateful look from her whom le aimed to benefit. As Jessie's interest in the outer world and passing events revived, this blemish would vanish. Older people, who had known more of the disci- pline of life, had fallen into the mistake of idolizing their sorrows while they were new. The sisters were at tea on the third day of Mr. Ford- ham's absence, when a letter was brought to Jessie. "From Roy!" she said, quietly, and laid it down by her plate until the meal was finished,-Eunice hurrying through hers in the belief that the wife wished to be alone when she read it. Instead of this, Jessie broke the seal, and read the four closely written pages by the lamlp upon the supper-table, while her sister washed the silver and china in the sanme little cedar-wood pail, -with shining brass hooips, her- mother had used for this purpose a quarter of a century before. Eunice was inclined to be scrupulous in the matters of extreme cleanliness and system in housekeep- ing, and neatness and fitness of apparel; and had other and quaint, but never unpleasant, peculiarities that leaned toward what the vulgar and unappreciative style " old- maidism." But she was a bonny picture to behold to- night, her black dress setting off her fairness to exquisite advantage; her feattures-chastened into purer outline and a softer serenity by sorrow; her eyes more beautiful for the shadows that had darkened them. She was younger in -appearance and feeling than her companion, who scannled, without change of expression and complexion, the love-words that had streamed, a   JzJESSA *fj.

She read it all, from address to signature; then handed it to her sis- ter, wIlo had just summoned Patsey to remove the hot water and towels. i"There are several messages to youl in it," she said, languidly. "You can read them for yourself." - Eunice drew back. "I don't think he meant it for any eyes but yours, dear. Tell me what lie says to ine." "I should have to go all over it again in order to do that," returned Jessie. "They are scattered sentences- business itemis and the like. You may look for them at your leisure. I shall leave the letter upon the table here."               / She put it down under her lamp, and turned her clhair to the fire. This was their sitting-room, now that the two, with Paltsey, composed the hollsehold. By tacit consent, they avoided the pallor, as recalling too vividly the gatherings and the happiness of other days. Jessie had leaned back in her cushioned seat, staring, in a blank, purposeless way, at the fire for five minutes or more, when Eunice took her place with her work-box on the other side of the hehearthl  ' You insist, then, that I shall read your love-letter ' . slie asked, pleasantly. FaithfuI to lher promisto o Roy to do all in ler ponwer for the restoration of Jessie's native cheerfulness, she compelled herself to wear a tranquil countenance il her sight, to speak hopefully, and, wLen she could, brig-htly in addlessing her. Jessie neit!ler smiled nor frowned. She looked sim- ply and wearily indifferent. 4,   260         JESSAMNE, "If you pleasei" she said, without withdlawing her eyes fromn the blazing logs. Elinice skimmed the first thrlee pages cursorily, on the watlch for any mention of her own name, beset, all the while, by the idea that her act in openinT the letter'at all bordered upon profanation, and affected almost to tears by stray sentences she could not avoid seeing, eloquent of the young liusband's tender compassion for his loved one, his longings to be with her, and fond prognostications of tlhe peace and joy of their future life. At the top of the fourth page, a passage seemed to dart up at her from the sheet, and, leaping into view, to be changed into characters of red-lhot flame: "What a discreet little woman you are, never to hint to me yotlr knowledge of Orrin's engagement! The com- miuntication took me completely by surprise. He would scarcely believe that you had not told me; said that lie went down to Dundee on pur'pose to impart to you the agreeable and important secret. The marriage is fixed for December.

Rnmor-has it that his businesshere is to purchase the new bhouse opposite Jndge Provost's, as a residence for the happy pair. It will be a handsome home, but I hope and believe that we shall be as content with our love-nest of a cottage." Jessie did not look around as her sister refolded the letter, tucked it into the envelope, and laid it upon the table. But while each believed herself to be separated from the other by a fathornless gulf of memories, every one of which was an anguish, both were pondering the same section of the epistle that lay between them. The announcement of Wyllys' approaching marriage was, in itself, nothing to the wife. The thought of it had lost the power- to wound w hen she parted with her faith in  him. Tle wrong he had done her could never be for- given; he had misled ler purposely; deceived her cruelly; had robbed her life of love and hope, and given her self- contempt and remorse} in their stead. But she did not regret himr-as sihe now knew him to be--or linger fondly upon recollections of thleir by-gone intimacy. Hester Sanford was welcome to the suitor her gold had bonght.    , The phrases that had found a sentient spot in her breast were these: "Whlom I  am extremely curious to meet." iI shall expect a full-length description of her." The apathetic misery which had locked brain and heart with fetters of ice since her father's death had not rendered her totally unmindful of her husband's long-suffering and gentleness, his unselfish love and care of herself. She was persuaded that the girlish passion that had made of him  a deini-god was gone forever. Her flesh fainted, and her spirit died within her, at the caresses to which dresses to  -whq-6 '[   262         JESSAMNE. she had turned herself in the days of her idolatry, as roses open to the sun--as innocently and as naturally. Slie could never love again. The fires llad scathed too deeply for that; but she had begun to believe that she might find comfort in esteeming and liking her only pro- tectpr; might seek, and not in vain, in a calln, true friendship for this good man, forgetfulness of the storms that had wrecked her early dreams. In his frank and noble presence suspicion stood rebukled. It was easier to discredit the evidence of one's own senses and judgment, than to doubt his integrity. But here was a deliberate deception. He--Roy Ford- ham-had -known Hester Sanford before she--Jessie- evNer saw her. She was the intimate associate and coni- dante of his former love;--of the woman he had re- nonnced heartlessly and without compunction,--and whose name had never passed his lips in his wife's hear- ing. Sle rec(alled faithfully Hester's account of the call "Maria " had paid with her then betrothed at Mr. San- ford's honse-a statement she would not have dared to make, had it been groundless. Whience this affectation of ignorance, on Fordham's part, of the person and char- acter of his cousin's intended bride, if not as a further means of keeping the knowledge of the affair from her? "To whom it should have been told, more than a year ago!" she reflected, a dreary loneliness creeping over her', with the conclusion-"He is like the rest of them! I would hlave believed in him if I could!  The door shut quietly. She did not hear it, or miss ler sister from her place. It was not an uncommon oc- currence for them to sit together without speaking, for an hour at a time, Eunice's fingers busied witlh some arti-   ,H',$$A I M.

Much less was it in the imagination of the younger sister to follow the elder in her progress up the staircase, her face more stony anl  eyes more desolate with each step, to the fail, large chamber she iad occupied from her childhood. It was cold and dark, but for-the light of the taper slie set down upon the mantel. There were none of the fanciful ormaments,-none of the luxurious devices, the patches of bright coloring that reflected the owner's tastes and whims in Jessie's apartment. All the draperies- those of the windows, the dressing-table, and the antique chairs, were pure white, as were also the walls. The carpet was a sober drab, checkered with narrow lines of blue. The aspect of the whole was so chill and grave on this bleak night, that Eunice shivered as at the breath of winter, as she drew up a seat to a stand in the middle of the floor,; and leaned her head upon the hard wood. Sot a  tear or word escaped her, but a deft and an invisi- ble engraver was at work upon her features, sharpening outlines, deepening here a stroke and there a furrow, until the father would not have known his child.

She had heard-herself called, "a predestined old maid" ever since her mother left her, a demure infant, -apt and serious beyond her years--to become her father's co-worker'and comforter. Her calm smile at the nickname looked like conscious superiority to dread of the obloquy-a fear that infects all classes of her sex. Her love was as reticent as her longing for affection had been. Orrin's most insidious arts had not sufficed to sur- prise her into confession. Of marriage he had never spoken, nor she permitted herself to think. Her attach- ment was artless and uncalculating as a child's. He had  convinced her that the subtle sympathy of their souls had made them one from their earliest meeting; that he had then recognized in her his spirit-mate. The seduc- tive'cant came trippingly from his tongue with the fluent convincingness of much practice, and she was listening- to it for the first time. His dual game was adroitly conducted, and the result was a triumphant cap-sheaf to- his harvest of hearts. His bride-expectant would have torn her flaxen hair--natural and artificial-with rage a had she guessed how tame he found his pursuit of her- self; how deficient in the flavor of excitement that had J marked his courtship of the beautiful but fortuneless coluntry girls. The hall-clock rang out nine strokes when Eunice shook off her reverie, and unlocked a drawer of her   JESSAMNE.          265 bureau. It was lined with silver paper, and the odor of dried violets stole into the still, cold air when she opened it. A bunch of withered flowers; a small herbarium filled by Wyllys and herself in their woodland and mountain rambles, -the vignette on the title-page, from his pencil; all the inscriptions, names of specimens, and poetical legerds, penned by his hand; a thin bundle of letters and notes; five or six books-favorite works with both of them-composed the contents. She took them out carefully, one by one, and laid them in a heap upon the table. Then, she sought in the closet for a wal- nut box, one of her childhood's treasures, an  oblong casket with a sliding top and a strong lock. Without audible evidence of suffering, she arranged the relics within it, with the nice regard to neatness and order which was, with her, intuitive as it had become habitual. The last article was a volume of Spenser's "Faerie Queene"-an English edition elegantly illustrated. Wyl- lys had sent it to her, the Christmas Jessie passed with Mrs. Baxter. His pencillings were upon several pages, and one of the fly-leaves bore an extract from Tennyson. He had apologized for transcribing it, there,:in the letter . 5 accompanying the gift, by saying that it was ever in his - mind, when he watched or talked with her.   No eyes    : save his and hers had ever seen the lines as written upon that page, and they were the more precious to her that this was so.

How vividly arose before her the scene of that Christmas Eve, when the parcel was brought to her! Her -faer r always spent the evening of the twenty-fourth of December in his study-and fasting. It was an anniversary with him; scrupulously observed for' many years, of what event or crisis in his life his daugh- ters never knew. Eunice had made her preparations for a lonely evening by her chamber-fire; collected her books and work about her that she might not feel too sadly the want of human converse. But she had:touched none of these; was sitting, her head on her hand, gazing into the fire, hearkening to the wind as it flung fierce dashes of sleet against the windows, and longing, how hungrily! for some visible evidence that she was remem- bered and missed by another, as she thought of and missed lhim. Into her solitude had come his gift' and letter, and the night was all light about her; the world was no more dark and cold and tempestuous. She walkedin Paradise, hand in hand with the good genius who had wrought the The idealistic character of womnan's love is at once her blessing and her curse. Orrin Wyllys, at that hour danc- ing at a Christmas rout, the gayest of the season, looking  meaning but unuttered flatteries into other eyes; feign-  :ng-as he best could feign-to wait as for the sentence ,j of life and death, upon other i sweet lips would have . laughed in unmixed amusement had he seen, min a magic - : mrror the representment of'himself before wfich a pure, M rag   zESSSA77\i.       26 JW 6, 9 A X I V. ky. fervent soul wag laying votive offerings of; her -best affections and richest fancies ;-to which she was looking up as to the highest of human intelligences, the embo-di ment of manhood's virtues and graces. While to her the delusion was happiness without stain or shade, while' it lasted.  It was over now! Returning from  the pursuit of these shadows-dearer and fairer than any real joyjand? : positive delight that would ever visit her solitary life,- she let the leaves of the book she still held unfurl slowlyv . under her fingers% reading a line here, a paragraph there, always those marked by the hand that must never meet hers again with the lingering touch which said more than,' the most impassioned words from other tongues. A blue' ribbon was inserted at one place, where, a passage was encircled by pencilled brackets, while in the margin was written; "E. K.' Her angel's face , As the great eye of heaven shin6d bright, Aimpade a sunshine in a shady place. Eunice shut her eyes in a throe of memory that ploughed deep pain-lines in her visage. Hell may keep,  but earth has not a keener torment than the contempla- tion of what was once sweetest joy,-now changed into shameful agony.

The travail of concealment began when she tuimed the lock upon the mementos-'few  and innocent-of her only love-dream. Hitherto, it had been a pearl, too price- less and pure to be exposed to other eyes. Defaced and crushed by one rude blow, it was some- thing to be thrust out of sight, kept beyond the chance of suspicion or detection-buried in a nameless grave. The key of the casket was a tiny thing, at which she looked for an instant in irresolution that ended in her raising the window, and flinging it far into the garden. The rain would soon beat it into the loose mould. It would be rusted into uselessness before the spring plough- share brought it again to the surface. Upon the lid of the box she fastened a card. "To be buried with me," she wrote upon it with fin- gers that did not tremble.   - The grave seems near and welcome in the ague-fit that shakes the soul from the divine illusion of reciprocal affection. There was not a symptom of sic T-lv sentimen- talism in Eunice's nature; but she did ^" at she could have said farewell to existence and tL, zow hde loved, with less effort than was required to dress her counte- nance in its wonted serenity, and go back to her sister; to speak and act as if a thunderbolt had not riven the ground at her feet; to consult her rustic and unobserv- ant handmaid about homely details of the morrow's house- keeping.

THE third Sabbath in October was bland and bright as June. Roy, who had arrived in Dundee on Saturday evening, invited his wife to a stroll in the garden with him after the dispersion of the after- noon congregation. There were more sere than green leaves in the rose labyrinth, but one side of the arbor was- covered by a thrifty mcra phyli that had been known to keep its foliage from Autumn to Spring when the winter was not severe, and which had put' forth, within a week, a few large milk-white roses, warmed into delicious fragrance by the sunny day. "Sweets to the sweet!" said Roy, cutting a half-open blossom and a bud, and fastening them in Jessie's brooch. "I wish they did not match your cheeks so nearly, Love!" She smiled faintly, I am gaining strength rapidly. There is nothing the matter :with me, except that I have not enough to do to   ^     -         JssAwrmvm         271 / keep me from moping. There is one thing .you:must let  me speak of while Eunice is not by,"-she continued, hurriedly. "I may not have appeared grateful for your permission to remain here until her arrangements about the school are completed, but I am thankful! I feel your goodness-your generosity, deeply! I wish I were more worthy of it!" Unconsciously, she had laid hold of the lappel of his coat, and was fingering it nervously. Then-a girlish trick she used to practise when coaxing or bantering her father, and, occasionally, when talking saucily with him- self-she began with deliberate fingers to button the coat from the throat down. "Making a mummy of me, Madcap!' was the alliterative comment Mr. Kirke usually made when the process was finished. Roy recollected it now, and smiled to himself.  The action--her first voluntary caress since his return from abroad, thrilled him with ecstasy. Her downcast eyes andrEembling lips recalled, in one rapturous rush, thoughts of the shy dalliance of the girl' he had wooed amid these bowers. He was winning her back to her true self,--or, rather, nature and affection were recovering from the lethargy induced by the shock she had sustained. "My wife must never speak to me of gratitude! he said, restraining the psean the heart would have sung through the lips. "Your happiness should be-if I know PI^  myself--is my chief consideration. Much as I regret Eunice's refusal to share our dwelling, I should be savage in my unkindness if I were to add to your disappoint- ment by denying your request that you might be left together a week or two longer. Nor do-I wish to punisri- her, or, in any manner, express my chagrin at her: - : ' ' !" x*   272        JEB8A1A.  .       .. termination. She is actuated by motives which are weighty in her estimation. The sight oaf her glistening eyes when I told her, this morning, that you were not to be separated while she retnained in the Parsonage,- went far toward compensating me for my self-denial. By and by, my bird will nestle in my bosom, settle her- self in our home. The knowledge that. you are, indeed and in truth, mine, dear one, renders me patient, almost satisfied, in your absence. If I say hourly, in the thought of your coming to and dwelling with ,me- ' GOD speed the day! ' the aspiration does not incline me to force your inclination, to withhold from you a reasonable indulgence, that I may see you the sooner in your right place. I would be your husband-not your jailor, my pet!" It was impossible to look into his moved face; to hear the cadence of passion and yearning that trembled along the last Intences, and not believe that, whatever might -be the record of his past loves and defections, his whole heart was now given to her who- bore his name. The listener's paroxysm ofhumility bowed her in spirit to his feet. He was heaping burning coals upon her shamed -head. "And GOD make me fit for that home " she said, solemnly, lifted in the exaltation of high resolve above the mental apathy and physical repulsion which had, up to this hour, made this enforced union an ever-present nightmare.  "Indeed, Roy, I will strive to be a good wife!  I have nothing to live for except the hope of , making you happy. You know what I am, weak and faulty--a spoiled child from the beginning, to whom everything like discipline was unknown until lately.   JESSA 31mN .        2T3 And then--one stroke followed another so rapidly that I have hardly been sane, I think. But I do want to satisfy youin every respect, or so far as one like me can!" ' So far as you can!'" his whole soul in the eyes that beamed into hers, and in the sweet, proud smile irradiat- ing his grave features. "The work is done, dearest! MSy cup runneth over. It will scarcely bear a rose-leaf this evening,-only this seal of our renewed covenant, my angel of blessing, my good, true wife!" bending to kiss her. He remembered afterward, how  she clung  to his shoulder and hid her face there, when he placed her be- side him on the bench in the arbor, where they sat out the half-hour of sunset as they had so many others in days gone by. Eunice seated behind the tea-urn when they obeyed Patsey's summons to supper, noted the lessened gloom of her sister's mien and Roy's expression of rad4i content; saw, when they gathered about the hearth for tiieven- ing's talk, that Roy took in his clasp the hand which generally lay listlessly across its fellow in Jessie's lap, and that she allowed him to retain it, Saw and was thankful for these slight harbingers of the return of the love and brightness which were once her child's life. Tried to comfort herself in her isolation with the belief that the night was passing from her darling's spirit. * "Wounds soon heal in hearts young aild healthy as is hers!" she thought. "For this, at least, I may return hearty thanks." Within two days after the receipt of Roy's first letter, Eunice had announced to Jessie the reverse of her Als : for the winter. Instead of removing with them t   2T ,4   -     JESSSAM Nu. ilton, she had decided to hire a cottage in the village, and open a school for girls. She had partially engaged both house and pupils before she broached the subject to her sister. Thoroughly aroused from her selfish languor by the startling intelligence, Jessie had opposed the scheme with might and main. Accustomed as she was to Eu- nice's calm but resolute measures, and her taciturnity re- specting her own views;, wants, and plans, this retreat from a position which had not been taken without much and serious thought, filled her with consternation. Having plied her unsuccessfully with arguments and entreaties of her own devising, Jessie wrote to Roy, begging him to use his powerful influence to avert the threatened evil. "I cannot do without her i" she said, without staying to reflect upon what might be the husband's feeling on r reading the avowal," unlike as we are and reserved as we c- have been to one another;on some subjects, our hearts are knit togeier by bands which are all the stronger for our late loss. In the anticipation of this parting, my only sister seems to me like my second soul-the other part of myself. I shall be less than half a woman without her. You can do more with her than any one else. If you desire my happiness, and I know you do, entreat her not to leave me!"  If aught in this letter wounded Fordham, nobody knew it   He wrote to Eunice forthwith and urgently;' did his best to dissuade her from the novel project, partly be- cause he-loved and respected her, chiefly because the mat- ter was one that concerned Jessie's comfort and happiness. He accomplished nothing, except to elicit from Eunice the admission that she had no counter-reasoning to offer, ait a mild but firm repetition of her unalterable resolve. , " . ,  .          -  -   aJESXSA NME.        275 i-e made a second attempt on Saturday evening, during Jessie's absence from the room, Eunice sewed on' stead- ily without a word, while he set forth the disadvantages of her present plan--the advantages of the former. Finally, brought to bay by his argument and searching questions, she confronted Ihim abruptly. "I must have work, and plenty of it, just now, Roy-! I dare not be idle! When it shall be safe and best for me to rest and think, I will accept your offer. I beg you to believe that I act from principle-not caprice. I am sure that I am doing right. And now, please say no more." Hle desisted at that, and with characteristic magnanim- ity, undertook to reconcile his wife to the separation, by holding out the hope that it was but temporary, besides inquiring into the minutiae of her design, and lending her what assistance she required in the furtherance of it. All was in train when he returned to his post of duty on Thursday morning. Repairs were in progress--pon the leased cottage, which was pretty and convenient; twenty pupils engaged to begin lessons early in November; the sale of the surplus furniture was over, and the sisters,. with Patsey, were busy getting the rest of their effects in order for transportation. Jessie was to follow in two weeks, when she had seen Eunice and the faithful servant domiciled in their new abode. It -was the longest fortnight. Roy had ever known, although he kept his loneliness and longing to himself, concealing their existence most carefully from his wife, She would come to " him and home,"-on Wednesday of- the second week, and he passed every hour he could spare.: from college duties and sleep, i getting the house read for her reception. On Mondays arived boxes from I)i - =n    - bo es   dee which he unpacked with his own hands. They con- tained Jessie's personal property-books, books and bijou- terie, and the most delightful occupation of his solitude was the arrangement of these in parlor and sitting-room. He slept at" home," as he proudly called it, after these were brought in. They were too valuable to be left un- guarded.       ' On Tuesday night, Orrin Wyllys, who had just re- turned from a visit of three or four days to his fiancee, ' chanced to pass the house, and seeing lights on the first floor, rang the bell;  Roy answered it. He was in dressing-gown and slip-   i pers-a cigar in one hand, a book in the other. U A domesticated Benedict to the life V " laughed his cousin, as he followed him into the library. "Aha!    i there is an old and valued acquaintance." The portrait of the girl at the wishing-well hung oppo- site the door, and, lie observed, in exact range of Roy's vision as he sat in his chair.   !I "You will find many more if you will use your: eyes. Come with me." The dining-room adjoined the library, and the parlors were just across the hall. A bronze statuette of Pallas- four feet high, mounted upon a column of Egyptian mar- ble-presented to the popular professor by the students, was the most conspicuous ornament; but scattered here and there were many interesting works of art selected by him in foreign lands-always with reference to Jessie's tastes and wishes. The piano was Orrin's bridal gift-a surprise held in reserve by the fond husband to brighten the coming home of his household deity. But the sitting- room back of the state apartments, was the one on which 4     *         *    .'   he had expended most care and time. A bay-window did duty for the more roomy oriel, and the shelf, which was an extension of the sill, was filled with plants. "Next Spring we will set a-root of jessamine outside," remarked Roy, when Orrin praised the infant creepers- ivy and passion-flower-on the inside of the casement. The carpet was mosses, green, gray, and russet, specked with red-topped lichens; the walls were flushed with pink. Jessie's escritoire was in one corner, her work-stand in another. A reading-lamp, with its alabaster shade, was upon the centre-table, and a low lounging chair beside it. The picture of Jessie's mother hung over the mantel; Jessie's books strewed the stands, and were ranged in rows within a handsome bookcase at the back of the room. Choice engravings wer9 hung in good lights, and within the fireplace lay long, Well-seasoned logs ready for light- ing. ' Beauty's bower!" said "rrin, gazing about him with unqualified approbation. "Who would have given you credit for such a genius- for furnishing? For the indi- viduality of your appointments shows that you are not in- debted to the upholsterer for the charming effect. But perhaps you have worked under orders. Did Mrs.- Ford- ham and her sister give you general directions?" "None. I am happy to have the approval of a con- noisseur," rejoined Roy, lightly. "I knew, of course, what Jessie- would like, and have tried to please her. Upholsterers and cartes blanlches from papa, and the toils of magnificence are the luxuries (and nuisances) of mien who marry heiresses., As perhaps you have discovered." "Sagely guessed!

I had come to the conclusion that I was anti-domestic in my proclivities, but a- sight of this idyl of a home has staggered the belief. I am glad you are married, old fellow!" clapping him on the shoulder. "I could not tell you in a month how glad!  "Don't begin, then!"REoy led the way to the library. "Else, not to be outdone, I must take at least a year in which to express my gratification at the event." Orrin eyed him furtively while he affected to be en- grossed in the delicate operation of lighting the cigar tendered by the host. Roy's clear, open brow, sunny smile, and the hearty ring of his voice were indubitable signs of the sincerity of his .happiness. It was with a lighter spirit-I leave conscience out of the question- that his kinsman threw himself back in his comfortable chair, and prepared ,to enjoylhe evening. "The last of my quasi widowerhood! ' said Roy. "I wish it were the last of your bachelor days, Orrin!" "Cra iendra!' returned the other, his cigar between his teeth. "Next month is December." "I hope your wife will take'as kindly to me as mine does to you! i pursued Roy. "And that I may, one day, have the opportunity to prove by services rendered her, my appreciation of the care you have taken of my interests in my absence." "Don't speak of it, my dear boy l" said Orrin, has- tily.  a Even he colored slightly at the unintentional sarcasm. lHe coughed to emit the smoke that had gone down the wrong way, and this gave him time to rally his ideas.   JESSATNE. 2j^9t No harm had come of his innocent pastime. Roy was none the wiser, and his bride had had the advantage of a new sensation in the development of- her latent capaci- ties for loving and, suffering. She would be better and stronger all her life; her character would gain breadth- and fibre for the emotion that had stirred .the depths of her being. It was wholesome, if sharp, discipline-a sort of spiritual subsoil'ploughing, without which she might never have developed aright. Women were a marvellous and an entertaining study. -Their powers of craft and concealment were beyond man's :ken or imita- tion. The most imprudently passionate of them acted sometimes with circumspection that would put a Talley- rand to the blush. Jessie, mad and desperate as she was at her last interview with himself, had nevertheless re- considered her resolution to reveal her inconstancy to her lawful lover, and judiciously judging that the Past was gone beyond recall, had tak'n up with the old lo-ve so' soon as the new one was off. She could not have done better for all parties. "Scenes," except when sentimen- tal and en ttte-a&tdte, were a vulgarism to be eschewed by refined people. "Jack shall have Gill, Nought shall go ill." he repeated, mentally, thus salving the smart caused by Roy'sthanks. "Jessie and I will be capital friends and neighbors. She will like me none the less because she knows that, had she been possessed of the fair and fond Hester's wealth, her. destiny would have been change.- She is too acute of perception not to comprehend'thati;---W ' that 'case, my sense of whatwas due to her and a:: - my..sense, due' to, her-i *- n -d E   280         JESSAMTNE.' would not have let me resign her, even to my honored cousin, here. But what -is, is best, I suppose. "You have never met my DIlcinea, I believe?" he said -aloud, both cigar and windpipe being in good working order by the time he reached this consolatory sequel. "I have not had that pleasure. Jessie gave me a slight sketch of her-a mere outline, which I hope to fill up for myself, shortly, from life.' "Then," meditated the cool and candid bridegroom- elect, " my tow-headed divinity lied egregiously about that old affair! I must cross-examine her in earnest, and if my suspicion is correct, make her retract certain counts in her indictment against Jessie's husband. I owe him that much reparation. Since they are a wedded unit, things should go upon velvet so far as is consistent with the fact of human imperfection. I'll send the lovely Hester to make amends to Mrs. Fordham, some time. If I do not forget it." He was in one of his gracefully indolent moods to- night,; and did not hurry himself in speech. "She is not handsome. You would not, I fear, con- sider'her even pretty," he resumed, after a few lulling puffs, such as might be necessary to temper loverly exag- geration. "But she is a dear, affectionate, pliant little thing, and will make just the wife a blase world citizen like myself needs. I hope--I think you will like her. But I don't, expect you to see in her the peer- of your glorious Jessie, however well she may suit me." Roy, when left alone again, pondered this speech dissat- isfedlvy. "! am not quite content with this match, nor with Orrin's tone. I had not looked for a lover's rhapsodies,   JESSA XMERO.        281 knowing his critical taste in these matters, but he ought not to acknowledge or feel the need of apologies for his choice. I am afraid his love does not leave him as little to wish for and to fear, as mine does me." He looked up at the portrait with a smile. "But there is only one Jessie in the world, and she will be here to-morrow night." Still standing before the picture, he made an involun- tary gesture, as of folding something in his arms. "My darling! soon to be my angel in the house! I think it would kill me to lose you now." :His sudden motion had struck a book from the corner of the table, exposing a letter that lay beneath. It was a foreign envelope, and had probably been given to the servant by the postman that afternoon, and placed there by her with the book on the top, for safe-keeping. An enclosure fell out as he opened the cover-a letter that had arrived in Heidelberg after he set 6ut for home, said a line from a fellow-student in the University. The smile lingered lovingly about mouth and eyes, while he tore off the inner wrapper.          ? a; The superscription was Jessie's; the note the 'shit and cold farewell she had indited after her parting with -Orrin Wyllys on the 5thg of September. "No harm done!" reiterated the affectionate kinsman, wallking slowly along to his lodgings, under the pure moon. "I should have been sorry had she carried her threat into execution; spoiled her own prospects, and made Roy wretched. But I could find it in my heart to regret the witch even now that I am on the eve of bet ion. The affair was interesting-most engaging while it lasted-- 1              ,         ,* * . ^   t/DDJll / UM/1 .

C" You are not well, I am afraid!" she said, when they were in the carriage that was to convey them home. " I am not sick, but I'have had much to think of and to do, lately, and I may look somewhat jaded," he an- swered. " You left Eunice well, you say? " " Quite well, thank you ! You have overworked your- self in getting the house ready for me. You should have left that for me to do." "It was not necessary. As it is, you will find mnuch room for alteration and improvement, I doubt not. You were fortunate in meeting with a pleasant escort on your journey. Are you much fatigued ?" " No, but my head aches a little," turning her face to the window.-  She was disappointed in her reception. The partig    284i        JESSAMNE. from Eunice had been a grievous trial; the journey filled with mournful thoughts of the past that now lay so very far behind her. In turning her back upon her parents' graves and her birthplace, she seemed to have parted company forever with the blithe girl who had been born and had grown up to woman's estate, careless and joyous as the swallows that had for a century built their nests in the belfry of the church-tower. She had almost forgotten how Jessie Kirke felt and acted. Yet she was thankful that in the, midst of melancholy and dazement, her ap- pointed way lay clear and open before her; that she had still a sure staff on which to lean,--the hope and resolve that she would do her duty bravely and well in the sphere for which her marriage-vow had set her apart. It was indicative of the generous temper and sound sense that never failed to assert themselves when the momentary tumult of passion had passed, which neither her faults nor the influence of the tempter. had warped, that she had never, for one. moment, blamed Roy for hurrying forward their marriage. They were " troth-plight," as her Scot- tish ancestors would have put it. She had said, "If you insist upon the fulfilment of my promise, I will submit to your decision." bAnd she had not said it idly. He had taken her at her word, as he had the right to do, and by that pledge she would abide. Lonely and tired, the sight of Roy's face in the crowd of strangers upon the platform of the Hamilton station had cheered her heart like a cordial. She forgot that he was her husband; remembered him only as a noble and faithful friend in whose presence she would be no longer Solitary and sad. She was even conscious of a proud sense of proprietorship in the fine-looking, dignified   - JESSA iMTNE. I      285 man who was the first to enter the -car when it stopped,- a consciousness that flushed her cheeks faintly, and quick- ened her pulses, as she introduced him to the gentleman Ewho had acted as her escort and heard his well-chosen words of acknowledgment for the favor done him. He had not kissed her then-she supposed because there were, so many looking on; but after taking his place beside her in the carriage, he might surely tell her that her coming gave him joy; repeat something of the rapturous antici- pations that had overflowed his heart in writing his last letter, received by her the night before. His face was very pale, his eyes. abstracted, his voice constrained. Anything more unlike the Roy she had known in Dundee could hardly be imagined, without changing the identity of the man. It was not surprising that a qualm of home- sickness weakened her heroic resolutions; put to flight her dreams of forgetting her unhappiness in the sustained effort to be and do all he wished. Roy saw the struggle and surmised, in part, the cause of it; but what could he say to assuage or encourage? The caresses and fond words with which he had sought to chnsole her in the earlier days of her desolation must, he now saw in the lurid light shed upon his honeymoon by that terrible letter, have aggravated her sufferings. Professing to be her protector, he had played the part of a brutal ravisher; had torn her,--shrinking and crying out against the loathed union she felt would " be a sin-a fearful sin," from her free, happy girl-life, and bound her, soul and body, in fetters more hateful and enduring than manacles of steel. After the first shock of horror and of grief, he forgot the wrong he had sustained in his overmastering compassion for her. And he could nt - MP i-7   286         JESit4mSE. free her! Loving her better than he did his own happi- ness and -life, he was powerless to ensure her peace of mind by restoring her to liberty. Hlad he been other than the true Christian and true manl he was, the distract- ing anguish of that conviction would have driven him to madness and to suicide, as a sequel to the fearful vigil that followed the discovery of his real position. Light came with the morning, and strength for the day. His course was plain--to mitigate the rigors of her fate by such kindly deeds as a brother might perform for the promotion of a sister's welfare; by abstaining from even such manifestations of affection as are a brother's right.-, There should be no formal explanation until she had recovered from the fatigue of her journey, and begun to feel at home in her new abode. Thus much he could and would do, and await the result. "What a pretty, pretty house!" exclaimed Jessie, as the carriage drew up at the gate of a cottage on the southern slope of one of the hills on which the handsome town was built. She had :meant to praise his selection of a residence however ordinary its appearance, but her enthusiastic ad- miration was genuine. Roy smiled, but not with the glad gleam she looked to see. "It is good and kind in you to say so I If you can be satisfied here, I ask nothing better or grander." A tidy girl opened the door, whom Jessie recognized with pleased surprise as a former servant in Dr. Baxter's family. - lWhy, Phoebe! This is homelike I How very gen- e:rs in Cousin Jane to give you up to me!"  . (.   J'ESS MrNE.        287 " She said you might find me useful, Miss Jessie! I beg your pardon-Mrs. Fordham!" replied the girl, drop- ping a courtesy. Jessie colored, Roy thought, painfully, at the as yet unfamiliar name. He interfered to save her further em- barrassment, in the shape of congratulations. ' You will show her to her room, if you please, Phoebe. And then let her have a cup of tea. She has a headache. Your trunks will be sent up in the course of half an hour, Jessie, but I would not advise you to wait for them, or take the trouble of changing your travelling- dress. You must begin your life here by doing just as you choose in such matters." He met her in the hall vhen she ran down, ten min- utes later, fearful lest she had kept him waiting, and led her into the supper room; letting her take her place be- hind the tea-tray without one of the tenderly gallant speeches with which a bridegroom would naturally in- stall his bride in the chair always appropriated by the mistress of heart and 'home. He was attentive to her wants, and talked as much as usual-perhaps more-in the endeavor to put her at her ease; telling how the flowers upon the tea-table and in her chamber were sent over at noon from Judge Provost's conservatory; that the silver service was a present from the Baxters, the bronze mantel-clock from Fanny Provost, who was very anxious to see her and resume their old intimacy. Se- lina Bradley had sent the chased silver butter-bowl, and other Hamilton families had testified their good-will by elegant and suitable gifts. "I arn every day more glad that you spent last winte  here," he said.

"Dearest, I entreat!" broke in the wife, at her last gasp of distress. His discourse moved on majestically. There were four knots in his handkerchief already. "From the moment I heard Mr. Wyllys caution Mrs. Baxter not to allude in her letter of invitation to our Jes- sie, to information he had supplied relative to her person, residence, and education, I distrusted the singleness of his- desire for the resumption of Mrs. Baxter's intercourse with the family of her early friend. When the invited guests arrived, and I learned that the terms of their previous intercourse entitled him to become her cavalier on all oc- casions'; her preceptor and referee in doubtful cases of conscience and conduct;--when I compared this circum- stance with his careless and apparently accidental men- tion of her to ]Mrs. Baxter, and his pretended indifference to her coming, I maale up my mind that he was- particu- larly interested in her for some reason he did not care to divulge. I believe still that this was the case. , I believe that, knowing her to be betrothed to his cousin, he strove, consctsly and systematically, to win her from her alle- giance. I thank GOD that he did not suceeed; that she has given herself and her happiness into the keeping of a true and honorable gentleman!" "1 am grateful 'to you, doctor, for your staunch friend- ship foirmyself, and--your paternal guardianship of my wifee!" Roy Fordham's full, pleasant tones reached Jessie's ears   JBS99AMT ATIE.   ,   293 like an angelic benediction through the seething chaos that was swallowing her up. 'I am glad, moreover, that you have, in the present company, introduced the subject of your misgivings re- garding my cousin's behavior while I was away. I ap- pointed him my proxy before I left my betrothed and my native land. The attentions that misled you into doubt of his right dealing were paid in that character. I can- not have you undervalue the -' true and honorable gentle- man' I know Orrin Wyllys to be. He is my friend!" The doctor tugged at his cravat-bow and stared into the chandelier. Mrs. Baxter gulped down all the solici- tude she could swallow, and threw - all the rest into the deprecating look she cast upon Roy. He'stood before his zealous old superior-courteous, kind, but earnest in defence of his absent friend-the model of gallant man- liness, thought the abject creature, cowering in the shadow of Mrs. Baxter's chair, half dead with remorse and the dread of addition'l questioning. The love of this man she had trodden under foot! for- gotten- affection acnd duty to him in the mad, wicked de- lirium wrought by the wiles of one whom Roy, in the simplicity of hip integrity, still accounted honest and faithful. A cheat and a coward Jessie had written Orrin down since that early'September day when he confided to her the fact of his engagement, and shrank visibly at the suggestion of Roy's anger at his shameless breach of faith. She stigmatized him now, in the council of her thoughts, as a liar from the beginning. He had manoeu- -vred, then, to procure Mrs. Baxter's invitation for herself, while, he denied to her that she had ever been named^ between them until after this was sent; had i   "      -  JB98AMNE. her away from the shelter of her father's roof and. the guard of her sister's care, that he mnight establish his fell influence over her. , Would not Roy, with all his generous trust in his cousin's honor and friendship, com- pare the doctor's mal-apropos statement with her confes- sion of the change in herself, and arrive at a tolerably correct perception of the truth that would blast her for- ever in his sight, as not merely weak and fickle, but for- ward and unmaidenly ? When the throbbing of her heart would let her listen intelligently to what was going on, the doctor had been beguiled into a dissertation upon Druidistic history,!'by Roy's exhibition of a paper-weight in the form of an altar, encircled by a wreath of mistletoe, graven out of a bit of stone he had picked up at Stonehenge. I-lis cousid- erate spouse carried him     off before one-third of the knots in his handkerchief were untied. Her valedictory, like her salutatory, was a diffuse apology for their intru- sion upon the sacredness of the installation-eve. " But the doctor-dear, blundering man! is amenable to no laws of conventionality," she subjoined, with an in- dulgent shrug and sigh. It is questionable whether either of the persons ad- dressed regretted the breach of etiquette. The time had gone by more swiftly and comfortably than if they had been left to themselves. As it was, an embarrassing silence followed the visitors' departure. Roy stood on the rug, facing the fire, motionless and thoughtful. Jes- sie, trembling in a nervous chill that changed her fingers into shaking icicles, durst not attempt to speak. Fordlham finally came out of his reverie with a start, F>d turned toward her apologetically.   " You are sadly tired ! Our good friends were very welcome, but they have kept you up beyond your strength. Mlay I take you to your room . " Shle murmured a disclaimer of the imputation of ex- cessive fatigue, but took his proffered arm,land they mounted thstairs together. A bright fire burned in the large front chamber, flashed gayly back from the gilt fleur-de-lis of the delicately tinted wall aper and the frames of the few pictures. A cosey arm .iair stood ready for Jessie, with a foot-cushion below it, and the marble slabs of bureau and mantel bore fragile wealth of Bohemian and frosted glass and Parian ornaments. "Is there anything I can do to make you more com- fortable." inquired Roy, not offering to sit down. " Wouldn't a glass of wine do your head good-? " "I think not. I need nothing, thank you!" without raising her eyes from the carpet. " I hope you will be quite rested by morning," he con- tinued, with the same ceremonious gentleness. " I may as well explain to you that, foreseeing how frequently I shall be obliged to sit up late at my studies, I have had the chamber opposite prepared for myself. So I will bid you good-night now." tIe held out his hand. She placed hers within it, silently, eyes still averted. "Good-night, and pleasant dreams !" he repeated, with a kindly pressure of the chill fingers. An impulse she could not control or define drew her to her feet. " Won't you kiss me, Roy ?." she asked, in sorrowful humility.               - She did not see how Bloodless were the lips that obeyed`,  296        JESSAMNE. The salute was, to her apprehension, cold and reluctant, and, without another syllable, he passed on to the outer door. There he stopped-hesitated, with 'a backward glance at the drooping figure, standing where he had left her-and returned. "I had not intended to say it yet," he said, agitatedly. "( There have been times when I questioned the propriety of any attempt at self-justification. But I would not have you think worse of me than I deserve for my selfish reck- lessness in hurrying on our marriage. I received this let- ter "-giving it to her--" last night. It furnishes the clue to much that I now see ought to have checked my unseemly impatience to claim the right I believed was still mine. This was the communication to which you referred when you pleaded that the contents of your last letter should have hindered my proposal. I supposed, in the haste and excitement of the moment, that you meant the false rumor of your mother's insanity which had been treated of in a former communication, the receipt of which, let me say here, hastened my return. Not that I dreaded insanity for you, but because I gathered from your letter that you were unhappy and a prey to morbid fancies, and I hoped to be able to do you good by diverting these. If this ' last letter' which you hold had reached me in sea- son, your request should have been granted." He paused to master his own emotion, or to give her opportunity for reply. He may hlave hoped yet, in the face of the evidence to the contrary he had had, that she would retract her declaration. "I love you no longer" might represent that she was possessed by " morbid fan- -;cies" when it was penned; that under the sharp tutelage of sorrow, her affections had regained their balance. ,- , - .   JESANIx'E.        297 She only sat still, her face hidden in her hands.- There was a crouch in her attitude that suggested an unpleasant idea, to the observer. It was that she feared him--his wrath and the results of this explanation. He forgot his sufferings in the desire to remove this apprehension if it existed. "My only hope now is, that since I know what I should have perceived from the beginning, I may spare you. an- noyanlce, if not misery, by consulting your wishes and re- specting your repugnances. If I could set you free, I would. My heaviest burden is the consciousness that this is impracticable. But it is my desire that, from this time, you should cease to regard me as your husband, and try to think of me as your friend. For we may still be that to each other-may we not, dear Jessie " She was moaning as in mortal pain. "This kindness kills me! I had rather you should say that you hated me! ' "But that would not be true," said the gentle voice. "And henceforward we will be very frank and just in our dealings with one another. We will try, moreover, to put vain regrets out of sight, and to do the duty of the day; to serve our fellows and honor TTM who has some merciful intent in leading us through these dark waters. Now, my child, this subject need never be renewed. Our Father knows our sorrows. To HTM we will look for strength. HE knows, too, the sincerity of my sad heart when I say how deeply it afflicts me to feel how mnuch more grievous is your trial than mine." Folding in his the hands she extended 'in a speechless passion of tears-her lips trying vainly to form a petiiU is"        '   '    "' ,  "' :i ;i--?,..i%   298         JESSAMTE. for pardon-he prayed the GOD of all consolation to have her in Hs holy keeping; to give her joy for weeping, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. Then, bid- ding her again "Be comforted and sleep," he went out. /        ' ' **    CHAPTER    N XT. K  lNOCKED at Mr. Fordham's door, ma'am, as 2II you bid, and he said that he wasn't well enough to leave his room, and would you, be pleased to eat- dt breakfast without him. And he said, ma'am, that you needn't be uneasy the leastest bit in the world, for it's only a cold and sore throat he's got, and, indeed, if I may make so bold as to say it, he's that hoarse I could scarcely hear him at all." Phoebe eyed her mistress slyly and keenly when she had delivered her message. Although not particularly given to prying and gossip, her curiosity was excited by certain peculiarities in the home life of Mr. and Mrs. Fordham, for which the supposition that the master of the house had "picked up German ways," while abroad, did not fully account. They had distinctly separate apartments, carry- ing the rule of division so far that Mr. Fordham a iever entered his wife's sitting-room without knocking at:hie door, and if she invaded the library when he wa:it-fSh' "   .         M - .   300         JESSAMNE. not only asked admittance in the same way, but apologized for interrupting his studies. "They are too polite, by half!" Phoebe' estimated, judging them by her not very extensive observation and experience. "There's Mrs. Baxter will make more fuss over her dried-up atomy of a man in one day, than Mrs. Fordham does about her fine figure of a husband in a year." She had never seen Mr. Fordham kiss or otherwise caress his bride, or indulge in any. of the romping fond} ling which the lately wedded are prone to forget may be less interesting to spectators than to themselves. Yet, she was ready to affirm stoutly that, in her parlance, "they thought the world and all of one another; " that Mr. Ford- ham studied his wife's inclinations, anticipated her wishes, and ministered to her comfort more than any other gen- tleman she knew; while "Mr. Fordham likes this," or, "he is not fond of that," were decisive phrases in Jessie's mouth in the conduct of her domestic affairs, and her many devices to make his home-coming at noon and even- ing, an ever-new pleasure, called forth the continual ad-- miration of the handmaiden. It was a puzzle past her finding out. But here was a test that could hardly fail. The wife should, according to Phoebe's creed, fly on the wings of love and anxiety to the bedside of her sick lord-; become his nurse and servitor until he recovered. To theJ girl's grieved disappointment,-for she was sincerely attached to the whilome "Miss Jessie," and wanted to think well of her in all ti ngs--Mrs. Fordham /said, :composedly, if not coolly--"Very well, Phoebe! Bring in breakfast-!" and tur-ned again to the window at i'   JE:SSAIsNE.         3Q1 which she was standing, when the news was brought to her of her husband's sad case. "I'm right down sorry--that I am!" grumbled the servant over the kitchen range. "I did hope she'd show some feeling for him when he's maybe took for dipthery or quincy or something else awful. And he such a good provider and well-spoken gentleman, and never so much as raising his voice in a temper with -her, but treating her like a queen! I've a mind to slip up myself, and ask what he'll have to eat. These are the beautifullest muffins ever I see! She is a master hand at the like. And I know she made these, as she does all sorts of nice things, because he likes 'em. Queer she never lets on but what I get up the dishes he praises. Mistresses mostly is glad enough to pocket the compliments as belongs to 'their girls. She's a genuwine lady, and no mistake, but it cuts me to see her so cold-hearted to Aim. I suppose they're what-folks call a ' fashionable couple.'" While this soliloquy was going on, the subject of it stood still at the window, gazing into the street. It was a bleak December day. There had been rain in the night; then the thermometer sank abruptly, and- by morning the sidewalks were glazed with ice. The earth was black and grim, the clouds, grayly sullen, seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, and while Jessie looked, it began to snow, gently for a while, then so fast that a wavering sheet soon shut out her view of distant objects. The cottage was on a corner, and this being a side-win- dow, gave upon the college-grounds on one hand, Judge Provost's house, garden, and lawn on the other. :By changing her position never so slightly, the lady eoud - have beheld the balconied front and imposing cupola-:: Y w=   302        JESSAMNE. the Wyllys' residence, of which the happy pair had taken formal possession ten days before, postponing their bridal tour until Spring. "For," as the bride eagerly explained to everybody-"both of us have been everywhere on this side of' the water, and winter-travelling is an, awful bore. To be sure, we've been abroad, too, and seen everytling that is worth seeing. So we are beating our brains to devise something recherche" (pronounced re- churohy) "in the way of a wedding-trip. And it is so sweet and romantic to come to our own home, right away! Indeed, as I told Orrin, it isn't safe to leave such carpets and furniture as ours unprotected." Jessie had heard all this fanfanronade, and much more from Mrs. Baxter, bat she was not thinking of it now. Nor did she move so as to bring the "new and superb mansion of our popular fellow-citizen, Orrin Wyllys, Esq.," within the range of her vision; only seemed to watch the falling snow, and the few passers-by who dotted the whitening streets at this early hour. In reality, she was speculating upon the meaning of the stillness in the chamber overhead. Was Roy, then, too ill to get up  Was his room comfortable? What attention from nurse or physician did he need? How was she to learn and supply his wants It would be barbarous unkindness, if he were very sick, to stand aloof and leave the charge of him to hirelings. Yet her personal attendance would be awkward for both. She was not sure that he would approve of it, so fastidious had been his care to excuse her from. such offices. He had spoken, in an off-hand way, overnight, of feeling chilly, and apologized for not offering to read the new number of a magazine to her by saying that his throat was sore. Without consulting   JESSA 'NE.         303 him,'she had brewed a pitcher of hot lemonade, and insisted' upon his drinking it after he went to his room. He had thanked her with the invariable courtesy that met her every effort to serve him, and " was sure it was all he needed. A most agreeable prescription too!" he added, as he bore off the pitcher. It was a shock, after this pleasant parting, to hear that he was sick ir, bed. What if he were to be seriously ill? Her heart gave a; great bound, then ceased moving for a moment. He was so robust, so full of life and energy, that this could not be. What if he were to die! She too thought of diphtheria. There had been several fatal cases of it in Hamilton recently. She was pale and faint; her limbs giving way under her as she admitted the frightful' supposition. What would she be-what would she do if the strong staff Lof is protection, the solace of his companionship, were reft from her? For she knew that, little cause as she had given him in the circumstances attending their marriage, to cherish her as all men should-as some men do the women who love them fervently and constantly, there was hardly a wife in the land who was surrounded by the atmosphere of chiv- alrous devotion which encompassed her in the secluded life she led as the nominal mistress of Roy Fordham's home. Her deep mourning was -a sufficient excuse for declining to enter the gay circle in which Ms. NVyllys fluttered and her diamonds and husband shone. But Roy saw to it that she was not lonely. The Baxters, Provosts, and others of his friends were often with them during the day, and he spent his evenings, as a rule, at home.   304         JESSAMN7VE. "Will you favor me with your company in the library, or shall I come to your sitting-room?" he would ask, when supper was over. They wrote and studied together as two friends of the same sex might; talked freely upon all subjects suggested by either-each watchful that no chance touch should wound the other; make him or her swerve quickly aside 'lest the next step should be upon the fresh grave that lay ever between them. In all their intercourse, Roy's ap- parent ease far surpassed his wife's. Cheerful, cordial, always kind and, more than kind in manner and language, he yet comported himself as if there were nothing abnor- mal in this sort of association; as if passion and regret were alike things of the Past, to which he had said they need never again recur. No warmer love-name than "Jessie, dear," ever passed his lips, and after the night of the home bringing, he had never offered to kiss or em- brace her. A hand-clasp, night and morning; a smiling bow and lively phrase, when h ecame in to dinner and tea, were the most affectionate courtesies exchanged. But no distraught lover, at the height of his lunacy, ever studied his mistress's fantasies, sought to penetrate and fulfil her will, as did this quiet and courtly husband that of the woman who had confessed that her heart was none of his when he married her. Flowers, fruits, birds, and books werlavished upon her; passed into her hands through other than -his, but were ,always procured by him in re- sponse to some expressed liking on her part, or in accord- ;ance with what he imagined were her wishes or needs. Nor was his unobtrusive attention to her health less con- stant A In the same friendly style, he regulated exercise, diet, and work; saw that her habits were not too sedentary, ,.t  "'. ,.             .    g JESzA ds.^       305 and that she did not expose herself imprudently to cold, damp, or fatigue. Her review of all this was rapid and circumstantial. "He deserves all that I can do for him. False delicacy inor pride shall keep me back from ministering to the wants of one who is to me father, brother, friend. I may, at least, wait upon him as a-hostess might tend an honored guest-a housekeeper the master df the house!" she had decided by the time Phoebe set coffee, muffins, and steak upon the table. Then td the serving-girl's increased chagrin, she sat i;.  down, with Roy's vacant chair opposite her, and break- fasted alone. "Not much of a breakfast, to be sure!" said Phoebe, returning at the end of ten minutes, to find the room de- serted. ^"Half a muffin, and a cup of coffee, and she clean forgot to carve the steak! Looks like she was in love-but that can't be!" :"Come in!" said the changed voice that had wrought upon Phcebe's womanly compassion, as Jessie awaited the warrant to enter the sick-room-a faint-hearted lingerer upon the threshold. She buoyed up her courage by re- membering that she was the housekeeper who had come for the orders for the day; the diffidence she railed at' inwardly, as ridiculous and uncalled for, had no visible effect, except to heighten her color, and make her carry her head a trifle less loftily. Already Mrs. Wyllys had been heard to say that," if Mrs. Fordham were worth a million in her own right, she could not look more haughty and indifferent to people who were  richer and better bred. When, as everybody knew%-she was a poor preacher's daughter with just 'money enough to , ,^/   306         J'88SA XTNE. buy her wedding-clothes. Though, pity knows, they couldn't have cost much! Was there ever such awful taste, as not to lighten her mourning to suit the circum- stances a Who ever heard of a bride's wearing crepe?" There were red spots upon Roy's cheeks, when he saw who his visitor was-probably hectic, for his de- meanor was natural. With instant thought of her proba- ble embarrassment, he put out his hand, smilingly. "All  Jessie, dear! Good-morning! You are very good to visit a poor fellow in his affliction. For such. a throat and head as I have to-day are an affliction. I seldom strike my colors to a common cold." "This seems to me tobe an uncommon one!"Jessie said, feeling his pulse with the practised touch she had learned ill her parish-visiting. "You have fever. You ought to have medical advice. Who is your physician?" "I have never had occasion to call in one since I came to Hamilton. Suppose we 'bide a bit,' as our worthy President says, and if I am not better in the course of an hour or two, we can send for Dr. Bradley. I had a try- ing day'yesterday.' Professor Fairchild is sick, and I had some of his classes in additiori to my own. It is well this is Saturday. I can lie still, and rest my throat with a clear conscience.

But "--hesitating-" if you will let me say it"- "(Go on! there is ,nothing you may not say to me," he said en'couragingly. "I do think it would be better to see Dr. Bradley, at once-if only as a precautionary measure." iHe started-looked at her intently.  .                     ,,   JESSAXMNE.        307 You are thinking of diphtheria! You ought not to have come in until that point was settled'. There may be danger to you. If, through my carelessness-" I-e turned his face away, unable or unwilling to finish the sentence. "I never thought of that!" said Jessie, simply. "If I had, I should have come all the same. Whatever may be the doctor's opinion, I shall stay here, and take care of you. It is my place." She rang the bell for Phoebe, and in Roy's hearing, ordered her to go for the doctor. She would not have her charge suspect that she was unduly alarmed, or believe there was occasion for a hasty summons. Then, she brought a sunshiny face to the bedside, and put a fresh pillow uinder the hot, heavy head. "You don't know what a famous nurse I am," she said, blithely. "My father"--her voice sinking with the sacred word--" used to say that nursing was a talent, and that I was born with it." She set to work, forthwith, without waiting for per- mission. Roy; regarding her silently from his bed, heartily endorsed Mr. Kirke's verdict. Not Eunice her- self could have moved more soundlessly, wrought more efficiently to alleviate, so far as she could, the pain and discomfort of his situation. The doctor was at home, and obeyed the call promptly. Roy glanced inquiringly at Jessie when he was announced. "' Show him up!" was all she, said, and when he followed Phoebe into the chamber, she met him' with high-bred ease as the lady of the house; as the patient's wife discussed his symptoms; heard, with marked  ?

"A fine woman, and a most devoted wife!" pro- nounced Dr. Bradley, at his luncheon-table, that day. "Let me hear no more gossip about her, girls. Remember!" "But, Papa, they do say they live queerly!" ventured the irrepressible Selina. "Mrts. Wyllys--" "Is a fool! see that you don't become another in listen- ing to her twaddle!" was the peremptory reply. Orrin Wyllys, hearing accidentally of his cousin's in- disposition, called at noon, and was conducted by Phoebe, by warrant of the relationship, into Roy's presence. The chamber was heated usually by the furnace register, but Roy lay in bed gazing at the glowing pile of eoals in the grate. There was a happy ray in his eyes, spontaneity in the gayety with which he welcomed his guest, that did not accord with the latter's preconceived ideas of the dolor of a sick-room. "You looklike an invalid-don't you?" was Wyllys' second remark. "This is the cheeriest place I have been in to-day. It is what the English call beastly weather, out-of-doors. I don't blame anybody for keeping his bed. ,I thought you showed me the room across the hall as yours when you took me through the house, thatnight, the last of your quasi widowerhood.'" "We changed the arrangement afterward," rejoined Roy, carelessly. "But it is a luxury-is'n't it? to lie still on a stormy day, and stare a fire like that out of countenance; especially on a holiday, when there are no pbantoms of unsaid lectures to torment one's reveries. -- I ing   it atmazingly.

Orrin had his foibles, and a graver fault or so, but he was hisfriend, as he had told Dr. Baxter, and the -boyish love for his gallant senior was still strong upon him.

"If you don't want to be murdered in your bed, hold your tongue!" Roy was in a paroxysm of laughter; Wyllys, scowling horribly, had snatched the poker- and was making adroit passes at him, like the cunning master of fence he was, when Jessie, ignorant of the liberty Phoebe liad taklen, and supposing her patient to be alone, entered. She bad a waiter in one hand containing a silver pitcher and goblet, and a plate in the other, heaped with hothouse grapes. Transfixed with astonishment at the spectacle within she stopped on the threshold. Her amazement was not lessened when Orrin, replacing his weapon on the hearth, threw himself into a chair and covered his face with his handkerchief. "A victim of covetousness!" exclaimed Roy, trying to check his merriment. Of misplaced confidence!"-uttered Orrin, gloomily, removing his cambric, and arising with a shorw of mel- ndtholy' composure.

"A dash of scepticism is like vaccine virus,-a useful thing, where there is fear of infection," said Jessie, not comprehending what had gone before, and not choosing to ask questions of him.            ^ She bowed in passing him, making of her full hands a tacit excuse for the cavalier salutation,--a pretext that was transparent to the person she intended to slight. Depositing her burden upon a table, she bent over it, pretending to re-arrange the grapes and stir the contents of the pitcher, that her face might cool before he had a chance to scrutinize it. His presence in-this place was odious to her. What had she, in her self-abasement and earnest reachings after a nobler life than he had ever thought of, or aspired to, to do with his masquerad- ing tricks and persiflage? His mummery, then and there, was more than heartless-it was an insult to her, with the recollection of her broken vows and blighted life, dogging every thought of possible happiness. Her residence in Hamilton had no severer trial than these chance encounters with him-her husband's nearest of kin. "Nectar and grapes of Eshcol! ' he exclaimed in a tone of calm despair, referring to the contents of waiter and plate. "You may not believe it, Mrs. Foridham-in fact I don't expect you to, for it is the nature our sex to trust and trust again,-but you are nourishi  seir- pent! a base trickster! yet one of whose want!",:- nality I am ashamed.

Her emphasis of sincerity was unmistakable and wrought with various effect upon her two auditors. "So am I!" laughed Roy, his eyes alight with more  than mirth. "The grapes you cannot touch, my grasping frid! They were a present to me, not an hour since,    ; from Miss Fanny Provost-a basketful, wreathed with     t exquisite flowers. She believes in the reality of iny in-  teresting invalidism. As for the nectar-give him a sip    -Jessie, please! It is not fair that one man should  monopolize all the good things of life."        a  Jessie poured out the draught, witlhout jest or snmile; ^  then stood back with a gesture that bade him help hin-  self if he would. She would not be a party to the sport,   Orrin perceived.  'A missish, spiteful show of disdain!' he thought, ,  contemptuously. "She is hardly worth a scene! 'i To show that he was not repelled or overawed, he ad- vanced a step; took up the goblet with a profound obei- ,ance ; stared her in the eyes, and swallowed a mouthful. Roy's shout of exultation and the uncontrollable grimace f the dupe, moved Jessie to a smile, but she did not ipeak. "Witches' brothi " queried Orrin, with the tragical gravity of one who has made up his mind to die like a nan.  'So Socrates might have glared and growled!" said   i oy.

There was fire in that grate also; a lady's sewing- chair in front of it, and a work-box he recognized as Jessie's on the small table beside it. On the back of the chair hung a linen apron, with pockets, siuch as he had seen her wear when engaged in household tasks in Dundee, or gardening. He guessed directly that she had stopped in there to lay it off when she brought up the gargle. That this was her apartnment, he was sure, when another step revealed a bureau with a ladies' dressing- case open upon it. Separate apartments!" he mused,; pickin, his steps lightly down the cottage stairs. "Very unsentimental! Very un-American! decidedly independent and jolly. But, in this case, what is the meaning of it?" Hle believed he had the clue to the mystery before he inserted his latch-key in the door of his-or his wife's -house. Jessie Fordham could not forget that Jessie Kirke had loved hinm. The decent show of conjugal felicity he had witnessed that day was a hollow crust below which the lava still surged and seethed. Jessie was more faithful to the one great passion of her life, and less philosophical than he had been ready to believe. HHer scrupulous avoidance of hirm whenever this-could be done without awakening suspicion; the half -bitter retorts that fell now and then from the lips she would train to the utteralce of conventional lies; the indignant sparkle of the eyes that answered the searching appeal of his-what were all these but the ill-concealed tokens of aun 4t-tent that had so inwrought itself with the fifj h neart and being as to defy her strenuous at-   ^           * JESSAMNE.        ,3]  "1  tempts to pluck it forth, or keep it out of sight.

Jessie unclosed the blinds of the windows oppo- site the bed, that Roy might see it in all itslmight and beauty. "It is a foot deep- in the street," she said.

One has such a delicious feeling of home comfort and seclusion-the almost certainty that strangers will not intermeddle with fireside joys and in- terests while the household is shut in-I was about to say-tucked in snugly by, the grlbat white veil." Roy liked to hear her talk. Her girlish prattle was more charming to him than the profoundest disquisitions of scholars, or the brilliant repartee of literary coteries. Aware of this, and that part of her nursely duty was to amuse the patient; ignorant that his heart was leaping with a new-born hope, so sweet and sudden that his head " whirled dizzily under its influence, and the world took on rarest robes of beauty, she rambled on, her eyes bent upon the driving fleeces without. She had never been handsomer than now. . Every trace of the shock that had prostrated nervous forces and reason, three months be- fore, was gone from figure and countenance, while she thought only of gratifying her companion and- her own fancy for a wild, winter day. Not dreaming of the im- passioned gaze that dwelt upon her, she stood in an attitude of careless grace, a half smile playing about her mouth. "'As she used to stand in the oriel, at sunset!" thought Roy, with an unheard sigh. "Is all that, then, "L The tender grace of a day that is dead '? Can it ' never come back to me?

"' How blackly the pines show against his sides! The meadows are an immense meringue; Willow Creek is frozen and invisible under the snow-- so tightly locked within its banks that its groans can be heard, in the pauses of the storm, all the way t9, the Par- sonage. I used to lie awake on sharp, frosty nights, and hear the rumble of the imprisoned air running all the way from the upper bridge down to the falls. The holly- berries on the tree by the front porch peep out saucily from the little woolly piles that collect upon the spikes and leaves; the church-yard is level from fence to fence -oh, Royr! With the cry, she sank down upon a low seat, weeping as from the depths of a riven heart. "Under the snow! under the snow!" she reiterated, in a transport of distress. "I cannot bear to think of it!? "Come to me, dear Jessie!" said Fordham, in gentle command. tie hardly expected that she would obey, Ibut she did, groping her way by reason of the blinding tears, and sobbifg unrestrainedly. He had not seen lier weep before since thie night of her arrival at the cottage. "Sit here " he said, designating a chair at his side. ' I have something to say when you can hear it. These tears will ease your burdened heart, and they are due to the memory of the dear ones who are for a little while out of our sight." She had stifled her sobs, but her head was still bowed; her frame heaved in the ground-swell of the passing storm. "Fit a little while! Out of our sight!" he repeated, f5lhoughtfully- longinly. "We slall be together-all of us-verasoon. Did you ever ask yourself if you would   .'-,.

The Father leads us as wisely as lovingly!" The expression of his religious faith and experience never sounded like cant, even in the ears of the scoffer. It was a part of his life. His utterances were fearlessj,  simple, fervent, enforcing respect for their author, although the listener might not be in sympathy with their spirit. Jessie ceased to weep or sigh while he talked; presently showed her tear-stained face, tremulous with sad smiles, and laid her hand timidly upon his. "Thank you! Every word is a drop of comfort. But so much talking is bad for your throat, and the fever will return if you are agitated. It was childish and selfish- in me to give way as I did. But," her lip quivering anew --'" it came in upon me like a flood! the happy by-gone hours and the dear old manse! Just how'it all looked, as I had seen it, a hundred times in the winter weather I al- ways loved.  And the changes-and where they are now!"

"I do believe it! I should be slow to see and to be convinced if I did not!" began Jessie, the truth trembling upon her tongue. The temptation to unbosom herself without fear and- reserve was very strong. "But I feel myself to be unworthy of your regard, and the goodness you show me. And you are so wise and discreet-so self- contained-- A pang changed his features. He stirred restlessly, biting his lip to keep back a repetition of the word " self- contained!' that would have been a groan. "You are suffering!" said Jessie, anxiously. "I have made you worse!" "No; a passing pain--that is all! You always make meo better. What should I have done without you, to-day, my kind nurse?" A perverse fit, one of her spoiled-child freaks, seized Jessie. 'Phoebe would have taken excellent care of you!" she said, demurely, casting down her eyes to hide the gleam of mischief darting up to the surface. "She wanted to make brown gravy soup, and roast a fat duck for your dinner, with mince-pie-' to leave a nice taste in his mouth, ma'am.' And she persists in the belief that a gargle of red-pepper tea, with mustard-draughts upon your feet, and a cayenne poultice about your throat 'would pull you through,' when doctor's stuffs fail. As to so- ciety, your cousin, or, maybe, Dr. Baxter would have vcome in to cheer you up. 'What a godsend a big linen sheet would be to the good President, on a day like this,   JESSAMNE.         .321 with a listener who is hors du combat with a hoarse cold!" "I have not needed to be cheered up, since I saw the first glimpse of your face, this morning!" answered Roy, unguardedly. Conscious that he was trenching upon for- bidden ground, he diverted the conversation.. "What a flow of spirits Orrin has! I dldhurt my throat laughing at his tragico-comico envy of my surroundings. I wish he had a home, one like this, if it were shared by a con- genial companion, a woman who was more nearly his equal, mentally and morally, than the one he has chosen. He would be much happier than he can hope to be in the splendid pile lie calls by that name." "He seems perfectly satisfied with wife and house," re- turned Jessie, dryly. "And the marriage was certainly one of preference on Miss Sanford's part. Not that I admire or like her, and I know her better than you do. But I am persuaded that we waste our pity when we ex- pend it on either of them." They chatted, then, of various matters in the familiar style in which their conversations were; generally carried onl, until the day closing in about them, the fire spread a mlellow radiance over the area immediately around it; the white bed and the noble head laid high on the pil- lows; upon Jessie's earnest face and crown of raven hair. It was the hour and the scene for the confidential talk of husband and wife; the outpouring of true soul to true; the only unrestrained heart-connmunion this side the Land where subterfoge and disguise are unknown; speechl as far more excellent and satisfying than the languagef unwedded lovers as the perfume from the unfolded. i  surpasses that which steals from the bud., .

The wife's hands lay crossed upon her knees, and the husband did not offer to hold or touch them, or stroke, the beautiful hair with which the betrothed had toyed unrebuked. It was an anomalous intimacy, the restraints and courtesies of which would have been laughed at as affectations, if the story of them were not totally discred- ited by the- world outside " the great white veil" that shut them into their home,-theirs in name and in fact. Jessie got up, at length, stepping over the carpet with- out rustle or jar, " the poetry of motion," thought the looker-on, and laid more coals upon the fiery mass in the grate. Many-colored flames shot up through and darted, like living serpents, along the pile; the low crackling and hissing of the igniting lumps awoke a cricket in the chimney-corner. Jessie, kneeling on the rug, glanced over her shoulder, on hearing the cheery chirp, and smiled at Roy. "You don't treat the crickets on your hearth as Gruff- and Tackleton boasted that he did-' crunch 'em, sir!' I like to hear the little busybodies--don't you?" Without rising, when she had seemed to hearken for a while, she began to sing. Roy had not heard a note from her, even in church, since their marriage, and he held his breath, lay motionless, lest she should awaken from her reverie. It was an old ballad, she was crooning-half Scotch, and with a thought of pathos in the melody, al- thougli the words were not plaintive, "'Tis rare to see the morning bleeze, Like a bonfire, frae the sea; 'Tis fair to see the buiiie kiss The lip o' the flowery lea.   J llSS.{AMNE.       323 And fine it is on green hillside Where hums the bonnie bee, But rarer, fairer, finer far, Is the Ingleside to me." A light roseate film hid her from Roy's eyes. The Ingleside, where she -now knelt! his and hers! did she really love it so well as not to pine for the haunts of her girlhood a? And what had pressed that cry from her that was still echoing through his heart-chambers? the appeal that would have meant in a loving wife uncontrollable yearning for the sympathy of him who best knew her needs and her sorrows? "O. Roy!" she had said, hands outstretched as if to fasten upon his for support in the deep waters. It im- ported more-a million times more, that childlike wail- to him than all she had afterward expressed of gratitude and esteem. In that hour, consecrate forever by what his musings brought fortlh, he resolved to woo and win a second time the only woman he had ever loved; who he had believed was lost to him for all time, chained as she was to his side, forced into a relation she abhorred by vows her dying father and he- impatient, ruthless lover! -had put into her mouth. lie would be very wary, very patient, but love like iis--must conquer in the end. Doubts might oppose hhn in the broad light of day and commnon-sense, but he would not be turned aside. He. did not underrate the difficulties that lay in the way of this novel wooing. Jessie was no longer the fresh-heart- ed, impetuous gill who had laid her hand confidingly in his (his palm thrilled now in the recollection!) as- he sat by her in the oriel-window, the shadows of the tossiing; jessamine-bells-" joy-bells," he called thenm-cast 'i:a   324        JESSAMNE. her white dress and the carpet by the April sunshine; the dewiness and scents of the Spring morning in the air; the " light that was never on land and sea" glorifying the eyes uplifted to his. Faulty, but frank, with a mind stored with crude riches, a heart whose capacity for love and Love's sacri- fiees even he had divined rather than discovered-she had been easily won, though not lightly soughllt. Now, the luxuriant womanliness, the growth of whichh he marked from day to day in her physique, had not kept pace with the chastened development of her inner nature. If lihe had said in that early stage of "Love's Young Dream "-- "She is like no other girl I ever met!" she was now. a veritable unique-a gem a monarch might be proud to set in his diadem. For all that, he would win her! Should she arise from her lowly place by the ingle, and without a word of explanation or excuse for what was past, again give: him her hand, saying merely," I love you!" he would let all that had been enigmatical in their intercourse go from his remembrance at once and entirely; would trust her with his honor and affections, above all and through all that might stagger his faith in another. Was his a piti- ful, cringing spirit? -Was it a high or a mean type of humnan love that made him, possessing his tried soul in more abundant patience, say in the prospect of the tedi- ous and cautious, it might be the arduous, approach to the goal of his desires, that must be his, if he would make success a certainty ;- "';And they seemed uinto him but a few days for the love he had to her!"

"I o knew Mr. Fordham would be at the meeting in the Town Hall. Orrin promised to meet him there.

"Making clothes for some poor children,"' she answered. "If you will excuse me, I will go on with my workl, as the garments are sadly needed." "Certainly! I shall be more at my ease if you do not seem to mind my being here. You are the lost indils- trious woman I known. It positively fatilgues one to watch you. I suppose, though, there is everything ill being trained to such llabits from childhood. Now I haven't a thing to do from morning to night, which is lutcky, for I lhave always been so carefully waited upon from my cradle up to the present hour, when my darling husband will hardly let me put my foot to the ground withotut his assistance. You can't imagine how azxpetits soins he is in the retirement of Our1 sweet, sweet home! True, tle house is large, preposterously large-as I told my dear, indulgent father when he bought it. And as ()rrin is fond of style, and I have always been used to it, we keep up a ridiculous establishment when one considers the size of the family. Now, I dare say, you keep but two or three women-servants, and maybe no man at all, as you !have no carriage of your own?" "Phoebe is our only servant," said Jessie, unperturbed at having to state the mortifying fact with which Mrs. Wyllys was already acquainted. - "Is it possible!" looking curiously about her throughl her/gold eye-glass. "Yet everything about your little ..t1r @   JESSAMNEJ         327 place is as neat as a pin. What a valuable creature she must be! I declare I musttell Orrin that ' Five ser- vants to wait upon two people, my love!, I said to him this very evening. ' It is frightful extravagance!' But he insists that I shall be relieved from all drudgery, kBiowing how delicately I have been reared. If I were fond of work, I should be puzzled how to employ myself at the hours when there are no visitors. When I am ennuyyc in Orrin's absence, I have only to run across the street to my uncle's, Judge Provost's, to find plenty of society. What ahouseful of children thlleyhave! I told Orrinl-yesterday, that it was lucky he never fancied Jeannie Provost (who, to whisper a secret, was just per- fectly crazy after Mimn ) My uncle has a large fortune, but it will be cut up by the rule of long division at his death.

"No. The few poor there are so well cared-for by their neighbors as not to require my help. This is work allotted me by the Managers of the Hamilton Charitable Society. There is nmuch suffering here this winter." '; Ah!" indifferently. "Orrin doesn't, approve of my attending these Women's Societies. He says it would unsex me-that he so admires my thorough womanliness! And, after all, when people can give money to the col- lectors and visitors and agents, and all that kind of nui- sance, there is no use in doing anything else.

A photograph upon ^handsome easel attracted her at- tention, and the eye-glass was on duty. "Is that a fancy picture, or a portrait?" "It is a likeness of my sister.". "Indeed! Is she single or married? What is her name?" "Her name is Eunice Kirke."5 "Ah! a spinster! She is a very nice-looking person! As you were saying, the winter is severe! But the. skat- ing and sleighing are superb! I w"as on the ice several times last week with Orrin.  He's such a spleudid skater: I am so proud to be seen with him! ; I suppose you must have heard how- much attention we attract whenever we appear?" "I see very little of general society, this winter," Jes- sie politely evaded the inquiry. "I am not in the way of hearing about gay assemblies of any kind." "Oh, yes! I forgot you were wearing black. But you shouldn't bury yourself too much, even to keep your house in this lovely order. I have seen you out driving several times with Mrs. Baxter, and said to Orrin what a convenience you must find her carriage. And while I think of it, do let me call by for you some day in the sleigh! Orrin and I have spoken of doing it, scores of times, but to confess the truth, we are just a little selfish  We so enjoy riding together, that we neglect our friends. Before I married Orrin, some officious friends advised me not to expect much attention from hiin after the wedding, ' because he was a ladies' man.' Such were notoriously indifferent to their wives' comlfort, I was in- Aformed.. Even my cousin-the Attorney-general's lady  "--said to me,l My dear Hester!

But I turned a deaf ear to the croakers, and obeyed the dictates of my own heart. Now, I am reaping the reward of my wise action. It may sound boastful in me, but I don't be- lieve my Orrin has his equal as a husband in the uni- verse. His devotion to me is miraculous. I understand that we have the reputation of being the most love-sick couple in town, but I don't care! Let those that laugh win-and I have won! The women try to ridicule us because they are envious. It is not for me to say why the men do it!" A giggle and a violent sidewise toss of the head. ' The worst they can say is, that we are more in love with one another now, than we were before our marriage. It is true, and we glory in it. My only fear is, that nmy dairling husband may become too domestic in his perfect content with his} wife and his home. It is very sweet and beautiful in him, but I often force him to go abroad, both with, and without me, to counteract this tendency.  Jessie stitched on diligently, with'a half smile the visi- tor mistook for pleased interest in her theme, when it was in reality, made up of amusement and contempt. She could have had no surer evidence of how completely she had outgrown girlish foibles and unworthy rivalries; how firmly established she was upon her new plane of principle, reasoning, and views, than the equanimity with which she suffered Hester's patronage and open ex- ultation over herself. Her contemptuous amusement in retrospection, embraced the would-be belle, who, although "nothing but a poor minister's daughter," had vied with the heiress in style and popuilarity.

Such paltry contests as they looked to her now! such an insignificant opponent was this brainless, conceited creature- before her! Her boasting Mrs. Fordham valued at its true worth. Through Mrs. Baxter she had learned that the exactions, caressings, and braggadocio of Wyllys's bride made him the laughing stock of his associates. Her fortune was settled u!pon herself in terms that put it beyond his man- agement, and his graceful insouciance had occasionally proved insufficient to cover his chagrin at her unsparing use of the power this arrangement gave her. Elated to rapture at lher success in securing him, she paraded their mutual affection ad na seam in whatever company they entered; people said, dragged him abroad against his will in order to do this. In the,large circle of her hus- band's acquaintances, she was received with a degree of distinction, she chose to believe was homage to her charms and worth, and superadded to the egregious van- ity and pretension of the heiress, her complacency in the dignity of the married woman was ludicrous beyond de- scription.    . She was!arrayed to-night in a blue Irish poplin, bor- dered on overskirt, sleeves and basque with ermine; there were diamonds in her ears, upon her fingers, and clustered in her- brooclh, and artificial flowers in her hair. "How I envy you for the easy time you have with your dress;" she remarked, incidentally to Jessie. "That is the only advantage onle has in wearing mourning. You cannot imagine what a deal. of time and labor I must ex- penld upon my toilette. Orrin is even harder to please in   j jy,&b'P M IV3i1 these matters than I am. If he had his'way I should always be in full dress."  Her voice had always upon Jessie a peculiar and un- pleasant effect, akin to that produced by the touch of some viscid substance. But she was Mrs. Orrin Wyllys. This was the end of his ";dream of fair women!" to be- come the petted henchman of a homely, selfish, arbitrary, silly, and wealthy wife. ".How can you endurre to toulch that coarse work?.  was her next essay, with a gesture of her be-ringed fingers like filliping off an obnoxious insect. "Why, that is a flalnel petticoat-isn't it?" "Does Mr. Fordham ever catch you at that sort of sewing . " "Sometimes."' Jessie had her quiet little smile of satisfaction at the thought of the delightful evenings she had had since this task was commenced, for Rov read aloud to her while she sewed. "I am astonished he tolerates it! Orrin is so fastidi-. ous; hlas such an exalted appreciation of my refinement, that I wouldn't dare let hilm see me handle such a gar- ment.  I think the more careful we are to maintain a certain degree of modest reserve in the presence of our husbands, the more we shrink from  all things common and unclean, the better they will love us. I dread lowering myself to the level of a conmmonplace wolan in my beloved Orrin's eyes; would keep vmyself his divinity while I can. But 1 know I am an exception :: in this respect, that with most married couples, disend::l: chantment comes with' the wane of the honeymoon." --,  ,' ,       '* 5 " e' ;   ,  , ., , ,-, *",. '&; ,- :tr   332         JESSAMNx. Jessie understood the thrust conveyed in the borrowed phrases, enunciated with monkey-like gravity. She had had others like it from the same source. The narrow soul and heart of the speaker had never let her forgive irlls. Fordliam for having once played in her sight the part of chief favorite upon Orrin's list of belles. He had glossed over the circumstance of his pointed attentions to the country girl, by representing her relations to his cousin; had sworn sounding oaths, more loud than deep, that he had never whispered to her of love--and his wife listened and disbelieved. At any rate, the; Hamilton wiseacres gave the poorer woman the credit of the conquest, and the knowledge of this was the :Banquo at Hester's corona- tion-feast. "But you and our good cousin-Roy are such awfully practical people!" rall on the chatterer. "I have told Orrin twenty times that I didn't believe your husband kissed you once a week. I should be disconsolate if mnin;e did not kiss-me whenever he went out and came ill---not to mention dozens of times besides. 1However, as my blessed, charitable old love says, people differ wonderfully in temperament. Now, we are so ardent!'" "As you say, diversity of temperament accounts for much that seems singular in action," remarked Jessi, com- posedly. There was a strange aching at her heart as she said it. Looking at the flat, flaccid visage of her interlocutor, she would have declared it to be impossible for her to wound her by this inane twaddle, peppered with weak spite. Yet she had set a nerve ajar. !"If I had a husband-" the, " practical" woman was saying- to herself-" his kisses would be too dear and #   JErSSANE.         333 sacred to be counted over and boasted of to others. If I hada husband! Heaven help nel I have none! ' The china-blue eyes of .the shallow pate over there would have glittered with malicious delight in her own shrewdness, had she guessed how near to the truth was 'her description of the external intercourse of those whom the church and the world named as one. "It is awfully nice to be married!" she rattled on, growing more and more confidential. "There is such solid comfort in the reflection that your destiny is accomplished. No more need for anxiety and ,setting one's cap, and all that. I shall never forget the delicious peace that filled my whole soul when I first heard myself called I'Mrs. Wyllys!' when I appreciated that the irrevocable step was taken. Still, it seems very sudden. It is just a year since I heard Orrin spoken of as your beau--a funny mistake, as you know, but I didn't then. Oh! how angry I bas! for I had determined, even then, that he should fall in love with me. Maybe you recollect the time? It was one day when we were playing billiards at Judge Provost's, and somebody-Fanny, I believe-said he was your teacher. Afterward, the girls began talking about Mr. Fordhanm's attentions to another young lady-never supposing that he was engaged to you all the time. By the way-did I ever tell you that my dear, upright, kind- hearted husband charged me to mention to you that that      was all a foolish mistake?" at ]     What was a mistake?" ;      Jessie looked up, arresting the swift, even motion of her fingers. "Why,.the story of Mr. Fordham's engagement to Maria Dunn, a young lady of our city."   334         JESSMrIN E. ' I recollect that you stated it as a fact," returned Jes- sie, pointedly. "She was an intimate friend of youlrs, you said, and that you had the tale directly from- her. You said, moreover, that Mr. Fordham had called upon you, in compaily with her." IHester's thin skin was mottled with mulberry. "WTell, yes! we were a good deal together, at one time, and she certainly dicl lead me to believe that Mr, Ford- ham was in love with her -now I come to think of it. I have forgotten the exact circumstances, but there was somne talk about it and she did all she could to excite sympathy, until she took a faucy to marry another man. A miserably poor match she made-a clerk upon a salary of two thousand dollars! and her fatler with seven chil- dren! Then, she vowed there had never been any attachment between herself and Mr. Fordllam. , She was related to the friends he was visiting, and he happened to act as her escort once or twice. For my part, I amn sure he never gave her reason to think that he cared a rush for her. She was one of those girls who are always running after the mnen, and fancy that every gentleman who looks at them is going to propose on the spot. If there is one creature whom I despise above all-others, it is a woman who thinks marriage the chief end of her existence. I really thought I had spoken to you- about this, long ago. Dear Orrin told me to do it, just after we were married. He said you mighit allude to the affair in talking witlh Mr. Fordham, and I might be drawn into a libel-suit or fuss of some kind. I can't see how I came to forget it-I am usually so particular in following his advice!? Jessie gathered nothing intelligible from the monologue after this. The gleam of her needle was a dull spark be-   S i     -' '          -            - C"Lj           JESSAMNE.          335 v: fore her eyes, and the viscid drawl had some vage asso- ciation in her mind with the slimy trail of a snake.

A sharp thought aroused her at last, to put a question in hler turn.  ' You say Mr. Wyllys told you to correct the unfavor- al]e impression he fancied this story might have pio- duced upon my mind. When did he first refer to the sub- ject?  "O. for that matter, he aslked me about it before we were engaged. And, wasn't I properly frightened when I found you liad told tales out of school? Of course, I mlade as light of it as possible, and when he paid his first visit to B  ,1 set it all straight by telling hm I was certain it was a fabrication. I had had reasons for doubt-  ing Malria's veracity and honor in other respects. Would you believe it? The girl actually tried to attract Orrin's notice, after she knew he was engaged to ME!5 " Jessie had no means of determining how mnuph, or how little truth there was in this statement. It mattered noth- ing to hler who had been the more culpable in the decep- tion practised upon her--the intriguing husband, or the foolish wife.  It was probable bo6th had prevaricated glrossly and maliciously. It. was certain that they had - together wrought her great and irreparable harmn. The lollg-delayed explanation was worse than nseless. The oHe maligned by the mischievous gossip lhad been cast off, ^* alnd alienated.

A1n awkward little pause ensued. Orrin's chair was at Jessie's right hand, and he turned slightly in that direc- tion while stooping to warm his hands at the blazing hearth, as if expecting some hospitable demonstratiol from her. She folded her work as neatly as if handling satin instead of flannel, laid it Within -her basket and set it back, and, with a word of apology, left the room to or- der refreshments for the guests. On her return, she en- 6 -   tered from the parlors that she might more easily reach a ui   divan on the opposite side 'of the hearth from Orrin. l t  Hester was whispering to her husband, and Roy, whose  \ ^ - seat was next that Jessie had taken, glanced down at her i    with a smile of cheerful greeting, as she made the ex- d \  change. She met it with eyes that well-nigh destroyed his composure. Mournful to wretchedness; appealing to supplication, they seemed to lay her soul open to his I  regards; to ask of him-was it succor or forgiveness, :    it could not be affection! j   -  She, at-least, ought to have known Wyllys too well to V    imagine-if she thought of him at all-that the silent by- y play would pass unnoticed and uncomprehended by him. {A  In his bachelorhood, the explession of aversion to his    proximity, and the mute resort to her husband's protec-  - -  tion, would have amused and incited him to the exercise   of more potent fascinations. 3But Jessie's demeanor, of Il  late, had irked him unreasonably. He could have sup- ;  Fported an overt show of vindictiveness better than te  S  diognified indifference that baffled his attempts to reiest t^   lish their confidential relations. Manceuvre as he' j -j-,-  15  '  ' '  ' ' "J :   3 3 8       . JESSAMNE. and as he did, he could never see her for one instant alone, and this, he was sure, was not accidental. Upon one pretext or another, he called at the cottage at all hours--most frequently when he knew Roy was engaged in his professional duties. "Mrs. Fordham begged: to be excused," occasionally; oftener kept him waiting below until thei-to him, inopportune burst of Mrs. Baxter into the parlor, or Fanny Provost's entrance through the side- porch next her honme, prevented a ttete-a-tte. He could not believe that she had taken her, whom he swore at inwardly as a "chattering cockatoo," into her confidence in a matter so delicate as her unextinguished passion for himself, but it was plain that the coincidences which damaged his plans were somebody's work. For a while he derived some compensation for his disappoint- ment from the additional evidence thus furnished him by the short-sighted novice in scheming, that her shyness was the fruit of cowardice; that lively coals of love for him still lurked beneath the ashes with which she would fain keep them smothered. But his best powers of finesse had not elicited a flash from these. Adroit ref- erences to scenes and words which she could not recall without emotion, if the wonted fires were still there, had produced as little visible effect as did his ardent protesta- tions of cousinly attachment. She treated him as she did a dozen other gentlemen-neither worse nor better. Mortification and amazement at his non-success were but human. Displeasure and the inclination to retaliate upon the instrument of his discomfiture weire unprofessional, and the display of them impolitic to the last degree. That he admitted these feelings, was to be accounted for plausibly only upon the hypothesis that contact with the   JTESSA fiNE.  sour whey of his ife's temper had not improved his own. In times past, he had been too rational, as well as too firmly entrenched in his self-appreciation, to descend to serious meditation upon the practice of a quality so vlgar, and usually so unremunerative as revenge. Two whole months had gone by since he laid his plans of ad- vance upon the fortification of matronly proprietyand womanly pride, and he had not gained an inch that he could discover,  It was fortunate for Jessie's self-respect that in her harshest judgment of his motives and character,she never surmised what was his present purpose. With her natural propen..sity to blame herself for th9 sins oChers committed against her, she would have leaped to the in- ference that he had seen warrant in her fonner indis- cretion and inconstanry, for the belief that neither moral nor religious principle Would serve her sucessfully in resisting his declaration of undiminished attachment; that she who had played false to the lover, would be un- aithful to the husband, if a similar magnet 'were pre- sented to her vacillating heart. She saw, indeed, that he co lted her notice and friendship; believedthatshe read in his conduct lingering fears that she might yet betray his perfidy to Roy, if she Were not propitiated by such sugal plums of attention as other women liked. The con- viction of his cowardice had dealt the heaviest blow at the idol that crumbled into common-dust on that Sep- tember d  ay. All vestige of godhood had departed -be- neath the shock. A brave man might sin; a good man might, under extreme provocation, beruel. The a itiff - who slunk away, whining, at sight of the lifted scourge =s                      .

Wyllys' mood, at sight of the rapid signal or query that passed from husband to wife, was the exact reverse of amiable, and he was not pacified by Hester's conduct. Hitching her chair close to her lord's, she stroked Iis hair and beard, smiling affectedly, in amorous languish- ment, at her lately purchased vassal, and purring like a cat. So soon as he could decently seek deliverance from the absurd situation, Orrin slipped from under the crawling fingers, and began to examine the books upon the centre- table. "Isn't he looking well?." said his tormentor to Roy, showing all her prominent teeth in the affectionate leer she sent after him. "Very well. His 'health has always been excellent, I believe," rejoined Roy.; "Although his active habits have hindered the gain of so much as a pound of super- fluous flesh." It hurt him to see his gay and, gallant clansman in the humiliating position of a led bear, at the mercy of a marmoset, but he could not be anything but civil in his own house. : "Oh! Oh! don't hint at the possibility of his ever get- ting fat! I thinlk lean people are just too sweet! I wouldn't have him altered by the change of a single hair in his mustache. Women ought to think their hus- bands perfect, oughtn't they, Cousin Jessie?" "If they are perfect!" was the reply. Mrs. Wyllys accomplished a compound toss of her head ; her ear-rings fairly jingling, and the flowers in her sandy braids and frizettes quivering like aspens in an east wind.   JRf SSA A fiV .      341 1 "That is rank heresy! Love that isn't blind is no. love at all. I wouldn't give a fig for the constancy of a wife who could detect the slightest flaw in the man she has promised to love, honor, and, obey. Would you now, Mr. Fordham?" "If you would have my candid opinion, I should prefer intelligent and discriminating esteem to blind adoration," was the courteous rejoinder, at which the lady bridled. "I might have expected some such answer in this staid, matter-of-fact household I Now, Orrin and H-" "You are true to your penchant for Mrs. Nortou, I perceive!"Orrin interrupted her unceremoniously, look- ling across at Jessie. "This is a handsome English edition of her poems." "Yes! I have had it for several years."' ' Is that an implication that you would not procure it now, if you did not possess it?" "k I imply nothing, except that she is popular with most young girls." "Woman, then, in her maturity of mind and affection, grows out of the taste for the I female Byron '--for that is Mrs. Norton's sobriquet in the literary world?" he said, interrogatively, and in suave deference to her judgment. V What some contend poetry should be,-the lyrical expression of passion,--sounds extravagant to one, who has studied life for herself. Must this be so? Are there no recesses far down in the heart where the dew will lie all day? Because we have learned to think in sober and weighty prose, must we blush to remember that our souls once melted through our eyes as we sang,' Thy Namle was Once the Magic Spell,' or read, 'The Tryst,' and ' I Cannot Love Thee "'?   342           IV/2A X /^Yj. "I have a song, called--'I do not Love Thee,'" in- terposed Mrs.- Wyllys. "It is just the sweetest thing you ever heard. Let me see! How does the air go?" hum- ming. "I do not love thee! No! I do not love thee!" "I am tempted to doubt the decline of your admira- tion -for our poetess," pursued Wyllys to Jessie, witlh royal disregard of his beloved's vocalization. "The boolk opens of itself at the last-named poem." "Do read it aloud, lovey!" begged Hester, eagerly. "I should so like to hear it I And he does read poetry so exquisitely!" to the Fordhalms. "It is just perfectly delightful to listen to him! I tell him that was the way he captivated me, with his reading and his singing. They are too sweet!'  "Let us have it, Orrin!" said Roy, good-humoredly, desirous to relieve him from the saccharine shower. "I never read it, I think. But I was always matter-of- fact,' as Mrs. Wyllys has already discovered. Perhaps the 'lyrical expression of passion' had less hold upon my adolescent imagination than it generally has upon im- pressible youth." He resigned himself ipatiently to the hearing of an ultra-pathetic love-song. Jessie knew every line of the poem already. She had said it over to herself, scores of times, last Summer, toss- ing wakefully upon her pillow at midnight, until the pine boughs seemed to have caught the rhythm; or pacing the garden walks with hurrying feet; or hanging over the railing of the rustic foot-bridge. But she could not help listening, as the cunning modulations of the reader drew out the simple fervor of each, line.

Perfectly still, yet attentive, she had leaned her head against the high back of her husband's chair, and was looking straight before her. The cold disgust, Wonderful and most unjust, found no expression in attitude and feature. The reader's voice mellowed; the emphasis of sup- pressed emotion was more artistic and effective. Seems to me that I should guess By what a world of bitterness, By what a gulf of hopeless care, Our two hearts divided are. And I praise thee as I go, i Wandering, weary, full of woe To my own unwilling heart,-- Cheating it to take thy part, By rehearsing each rare merit Which thy nature doth inherit; How thy heart is good and true, ;And thy face most fair to view; How the powers of thy mind Flatterers in the wisest ind, And the talents to thee given, Seem as held in trust for Heaven, Laboring on for noble ends, Steady to thy boyhood's friends, Slow to give or take offence, Full of earnest eloquence.      .  .  .  . . . How, in brief, there dwells in thee All that's generous and free, All that may most aptly move My spirit to an answeringlove. , .'" **"):f, .   344         JESSAMXINE. "Was'nt it too' funny that she didn't give in to such a splendid fellow?" queried -Hester, sniffing away the emotion she had tried to sop up with her laced handker- chief. "I never can hear dear Orrin read without crying, no matter what the -subject is. I couldn't have helped falling in love with him, I know. It was queer, now!" fretfully, as she saw Jessie's countenance. "I don't see what there is amusing about it!" Jessie held her head erect-a movement full of spirit and gladness--and laughed. It was no mirthless sound, but a ripple of real joyousness. ," Very queer!" she answered, merrily. "Mr. Wyllys! we must call upon you to explain the phenomenon. You evidently understand it. You read the poem con amore." She sprang up to serve her guests from the waiter Phoebe had placed upon the table. Roy followed her. "They tell me you make a delicious article of domestic wine, Mrs. Fordham--of elderberries, or grapes, (or currants-or something," said Mrs. Wyllys, bent. upon patronage at every turn. "I hope you are going to ,treat us to some of it now." "They' are mistaken!" returned Jessie, the merry ring yet in her voice. "I never attempted anything of the kind. The best substitute I can offer you for the beverage you had promised yourself, is Rhenish or Marsala which ]Mr. Fordham procured abroad." "I can answer for her, I believe, Mrs. Wyllys, that , her efforts in that line have been confined to the brewing of flax-seed lemonade, and sage tea!" chimed in Roy. Whllereat Jessie laughed again, as she had not done at Orrin's adventure with the gargle. Wyllys arose to receive a glass of wine from her hand,   JESSAIZNE.         345 and, in taking it, looked steadily, reproachfully, passion- ately, into her eyes. They sustained the scrutiny without quailing, a glint of roguish defiance playing within them, and her lips curling at the corners, as she turned away. He had a misgiving then that his power overlier was at an end. This was not acting, but the flashing of a stream where the sunshine reached to its bed; was filtrated through pure, sweet waters. If she were disenchanted, he knew whom he had to thank for it. He could have hated his Hester for the over-fondness that h'ad made him ridiculous to optics which erst surveyed him with timid and worshipful reverence, as Semele may have re- garded high Jove. lIe was not sorry he had wedded as he did. He had too just an appreciation of the inconveniences of living beyond one's means; the difficulties that environ a man of expensive tastes and a moderate income, and the thousand goods of wealth, to regret the investment, which had assuredly yielded more than cent. per cent., whether he estimated either the affection or the money he had put into the speculation. He was wise in his generation. Hester was the richest spoil that had ever been laid in his way, and he had not hesitated as to the line of duty. But he did wish she had not wheedled him into this visit, that she might have another opportu- nity to play the fool herself, and force a like part upon him. Jessie's laughter had stung him unreasonably, and in his avarice of the praise of his kind, he grudged the loss of a moiety of Roy's affectionate admiration. Fordham did not return to the sitting-room when he had escorted -his guests to the outer door. He bade his wife "Good-night," in the hall.'          - 15'    346     '   JESSAMNE. "Must you work to-night?" she asked, imploringly. "I meant-I hoped--that is, I thought we would have a pleasant chat over my fire." Her manner was agitated, her eye restless; but he scarcely noted this, or that she stammered strangely in preferring the petition. "Don't tempt me!" He would have made his answer playful. It was a sickly show, and repulsed Jessie more effectually than sternness would have done. With a burning blush, she dropped the hand she had laid lightly on his sleeve; murmured an apology; and hurried upstairs, forgetting that she had intended to sit for a while longer in the lower room. In her own chamber, she walked the floor in an agony of shame and despair. "He would never have my love now, if it were offered him!" she said, wringing her hands. "He knows me too well! The glamour of that happy love-summer has gone! gone! To-night, I feel further off from him than ever. He despises me a's I deserve 1 But righteous pun- ishment is as hard to bear as unjust condemnation. And I have suffered so much, and so long! I could have been wholly frank with him, if he had but gone and sat with me ten minutes-if he had been himself, instead of shrinking from my touch-rejecting my companionship." "The book opened of itself at that place I "Roy was thinking at that moment. He had been to the sitting- room for the volume, carried it into the library, and re- read the poem again and yet again, detecting what he im- agined was a tear blister on the second page. "What can I do? What course is left to me save that wrhich I am pursuing? Am I still odious to her?"   The girl at the spring smiled down upon him from the wall; seemed to hold out the green leaf-cup for his ac- ceptance. He could see the glisten of the water upon it; fancy that he heard in the stillness the tinkle of tle bright beads as they fell into the basin. The eyes that gave back her look were very patient, but just now it was a patience that had in it much of the weariness of hope deferred.  "I have put a cup of bitterness to your lips, my bird of beauty!" was his unselfish lament. Mr. Wyllys" had builded better than he knew," that evening. I wouldn't be as cold-blooded as that woman, for all the gold of Golconda!" exclaimed Hester, before the steps of the Fordham cottage were cold from the touch of her Parisian gaiters. "Maybe you mean diamonds," said her husband curtly. It is a safe plan not to use terms unless you are certain they are correct." "Gold or diamonds, it makes no difference I I don't pick my words when I am out of patience. It's precious little she has of either commodity, I guess l" laughing spitefully.  "Take care of that rough place in the crossing, cau- tioned Wyllys, in a less acrimonious tone, thus reminded what store his spouse possessed of the valuables specified, and, by inevitable association of ideas, of his profitable in- vestment.  "She frets me always!" continued the sweet creature, hanging, according to custom, basket-wise upon hisrm. "(This evening she was positively rude. How  : r;E            ,\re * .'^   348    .

And it served her just right! I as good as } told her she did not care a snap for her husband, before you came in. And she took it as coolly as if I had paid her a compliment.

"I am morally certain that she married Mr. Fordham, poor fellow! to get a home. If that isn't disgustingly immoral-a perfect sale of one's self in the shambles, as you may say, I don't know what is. To be sure, your cousin is one of the very quiet, non-exacting kind, and I hope doesn't suffer as you would, darling love, if she were your wife!" pinching his arm with her claw-like fingers. "For you and I are such turtles, dearie!?"  ': 0   CHAPTER XXY. PRING was forward in Hamilton that year. - Mrs. RBaxter, walking on the presidential portico at noon of a bright day in the third week of April, complimented the extraordinary benignity of that usually coy month, by sporting the first white dress of the season. A knot of irreverent students collected about the win- dow of one of the college dormitories, catching glimpses of her snowy draperies fluttering from pillar to pillar of the porch, made merry over profane pleasantries, touching "flourishing almond trees," and " antique angels." "Wonder if she wears that-red flannel night-cap to ward off the rheumatism!" said one, directing his puny arrow of wit at the " individualizing " scarlet scarf, now wound into a turban about her classic head, the silken fringes sweeping her shoulder.

The Lady President had waved her handkerchieb-o    350         JESSAMTNfE. some one in or near the college, and halted at the top of the front steps to receive him. "Who is the latest victim . " asked those in the rear of the party, as the foremost craned his neck to peer upon the campus. ' One who is able to take care of himself," was the response. "No less a personage than his Royal H-igh- ness." This sobriquet, let me explain, was applied to Professor Fordham in no unkind or depreciatory spirit by his classes. Originally intended as a play upon his Chris- tian name, it grew into populjar esteem as descriptive of their pride in his manly carriage and knightly demeanor. The quintette at the window watclied him with interest and admiration now, as he strode along the gravelled- avenue leading to the Presidents' house. "He would march up to the cannon's mouth in the same style," commented the chief speaker. "Did you ever see better shoulders?" "Did you ever see a better man f " interrogated the fifth of the group--a grave senior, who had not spoken before. And to the honor of the watchers, as of the watched, be it recorded that a hearty acquiescence in his verdict followed the question. The goodly man found abundant favor, likewise in Mrs. Baxter's eyes, as she invited him to enter her abode. ' Will you walk into my parlor?' Said the spider to the fly." Sang one of the graceless rascals in the dormitory, as a omentary upon the, to them, dumb show.   1             JJESSAIVI 3E.51 It was to Fordham anything but dumb. Mrs. Baxter was excruciatingly voluble in excusing herself for " what you must, I am certain, regard as anll unparalleled lib- erty, my dear Professor!" she continued, when he was seated. "I am gratefully at your service whenever you can makle use of me, madam," was the replv, which was more sincere than professions of the kind usually are. Mrs. Baxter's genuine love for her young cousin, and her numberless acts of neighborly kindness, had greatly en- deared her to Jessie's husband. Her peculiarities of manner and   phraseology weighed nothing with lim when compared with her sound principles and generous heart. "Thanz. you! I knew I might make the venture with you! My own mind being ill at ease, I could not resist the impulse to waylay you and unburden"--mak- ing as though she would clutch her heart, then sprawling both hands, her arms widely divergent lines from her heaving bust--" unburden myself to you, as the person most likely to sympathize with and ameliorate my anx- ieties. I had nearly said, my maternal anxieties. And indeed, Mr. Fordham, I could scarcely love your dear wife more, if she were, in truth, my child. Dear to me as the representative of the beloved friend of my youth, she has enhanced that partiality a thousandfold by her own worth and loveliness. This is my apology-this and the solicitude to which I have referred, for what may ap- pear to you indelicate interference with your domestic affairs.," The polite interest with which her auditor had received her prefatory remarks was supplanted by uneasiness, in  \  * ' * -  *  ,   '    .

He had made a motion to rise when the words, "your dear wife," passed her writhing lips. She hindered him with outstretched hands. "Not that there is any cause for new and immediate alarm," she hastened to assure him. "But I was in to see her this morning. She keeps bravely up when you are at home, I dare say." "She never complains. I have had my apprehensions that the untimely heat of the weather has been prejudi- cial to her strength. Her appetite is variable, and she is paler than she was in the winter, but I attributed--A "Yes! of course! interrupted Mrs. Baxter. Once bent upon an harangue, she was about as easily checked as a Yellowstone geyser in full play. "I am not sutlprised that your fears have not been awakened. I taxed her, to- day, with having deceived you as to the extent of her lassitude and depression. I surprised her-lying on the- sofa in her room, with the traces of fresh and copious tears upon her cheeks. She tried to laugh me out of my fears by talk of nervousness and hysteria, and would doubtless have succeeded, such are her spirit and address -but, Mr. Fordham! her precise likeness in look -and manner at that moment to her sainted mother sent a poignant fear through my soul I Far be it from me to censure the dead, but I have always maintained---I shall ever believe that my precious Ginevra's life might have been spared-prolonged for years-had her husband con- ferred with those who were conversant with her idiosyn- crasies spiritual and physical. Although--I will reveal to you, my dear sir, under the seal of a secrecy you will see the expediency of respecting, what I have never lisped   JESSAMNEiV ;BE*IXE,          353 to her daughter, or even to the best of husbands and men--Dr. Baxter. Mycousin Ginevra carried a blighted heart to Dundee when she went thither as Mr. Kirke's bride. An unfortunate misunderstanding had alienated her from one to whom her girlish affections were given. It is needless to enter into -particulars. It is enough to say that thley had loved and they were parted. She had not seen or heard from him for two years, most of which time she had passed abroad; indeed, she believed him to be the husband of another when she accepted Mr. Kirke. I own to you that my instinct and my reason opposed this fatal -step. I expostulated with her. "'Jane!' said she (you can imagine how Jessie would utter itt!) 'say no more. My resolution is taken. This is a good man, and he loves me! In this union I shall- I may find rest, quiet, and in some measure, peace. I have been storm-tossed until I have no strength left -for struggling! ' "Upon the eve of her marriage, the man whom  she loved returned and sought an interview. I was with her in her chamber when his card, requesting this favor, was handed her. At sight of the familiar characters the buried love sprang up alive, strong, importunate! It was a fearful scene-that resurrection! What should she have done?" ( Confessed all to her promised husband!" came low and sternly from the man's heart. "Hte would have re- signed her to her lover without a word of blame. I knew Mr. Kirke well. I  do not speak unadvisedly." "Such was my counsel. But she would not heed it. She refused to -look again upon the face of him whose heart was breaking with love and vain regrets, and went  - ^'i^l;    354        jE3srrfYE.  right on to her bridal. And her daughter, if subjected to a like test, would act as she did." "You say that Jessie is not well 2 " said Roy, shortly. There were limits to his fortitude. 'He could not hear l other lips tell what would be Jessie's action were an ab- horrent marriage forced upon her by conscience or honor. "In my estimation, she is veryfar "-arms again di- vergent-" very far from well, even taking into consider- ation the provocatives to languor you alluded to, just now. Furthermore-and again let me beg you to receive this intimation in the spirit in which I offer it!--further- more, she is homesick for Dundee and her sister. I ad- verted to them casually to assure myself that my views on this point were correct, and her eyes filled again di- rectly. "' I had hoped to see Euna this month,' she said, ' but the change in the college vacation, abolishing the inter- mediate, and making one long term instead of two short ones, has prevented it.' "Bunt when I remarked-' I wish Eunice could pay you a visit, were it only from Saturday to Monday! the loyal wife (such a stanch advocate as you have in her, Mr. Fordlam!), took alarm. "'Indeed, Cousin Jane, no one could take kinder care of me than Roy does!' she said, warmly. c He spoils and pets me beyond reason, and when he is in the house, I desire no other society.! "' But my precious girl! I remonstrated ; 'he cannot be with you all the time F ' "I wish you had seen the smile with which she replied --' Ah but I have the memory of his goodness to }ive on in his absence!' ? ;  * '       .             , "  '.   "She is true and fond, Mr. Fordham! Nevertheless, she does need change of air and scene. Her mother pined herself into an untimely grave in her longing for a sight of her old home and the faces of beloved ones." Roy was silent; his eyes downcast, his lips whitening with the pressure this story had brought to bear upon hiin. It was not so much the consciousness that, in sending his wife away, he would rob his life of repression and self- denial of the little sunshine left to it, as the thought that she was sickening of his companionship; could not live and grow in his shadow. This was the naked truth, dis- guise it as she might from her cousin; deny it to herself as she probably did. In every point of Mrs. Baxter's description, he recognized this terrible sense of bondage, crushing spirit and life; heard, even in her tribute to his loving watchfulness over her health and bodily comfort, the plaint embodied in the poem   he had learned by heart:-                         - "Like a chained thing, caressed By the hand it knows the. best, By the hand which, day by day, Visits its imprisoned stay, Bringing gifts of fruit and blossom From the green earth's plenteous bosom; All but that for which it pines, In these narrow, close confines,          . With a sad and ceaseless sigh,- Wild and winged Liberty!" -  With a deep inspiration which was the farewell to more     j hopeful dreams than he knew, until then, he had nursed, he collected his senses to reply. "It was my intention to take Jessie to Dundee in June, at the beginning of my vacation. She set the time her-  ,^ ij J      , -.; /.

I thank you for your more than friendly concern for her, your frank dealing with me."' He arose to go. The lady scanned his face somewhlat uneasily. There was something there that foiled her penetration. "You understand, my dear sir, that nothing would have tempted me to internmeddle in this affair, were the case precisely-what you have supposed. But there is an undercurrent, Mr. Fordham, the effect of which I can trace, that seriously complicates anything like hysterical depression. And loving the child as we do-as every one does, it behooves us to watch her warily, minister to her intelligently as tenderly. The affection between the sisters is unusually strong, and we should remember that the dear lamb has known no other mother." "I have offered, several times during the winter, to take her to visit Eunice. We were to have gone at Christmas, but Jessie had a severe cold that confined her to the house a fortnight." "I remember! To be quite sincere with you--not tliat I consider it a dangerous symptom--but I wish she were rid of that little hacking cough. She makes light of it. Says it is nervous, or from the stomach. ' But I do not like it!" She attended him to the- portico, disclaiming, caution- ing, and thanking him,-gesticulating through it all-as the wickedest of the wicked quintette of observers had it -" like a lunatic windmill." They espied no change in the Professor's gait or air. He walked firmly, head erect and countenance composed. And their distance from " -r ^ .   ' ' JESSAMNE.        35 him was too great to allow them to note the want of color in his complexion. He entered his own house, more slowly than he had trodden the pavement. Jessie had fallen into the habit common to wives who hail their husbands' return as cheering events, of meeting him in the hall, sometimes at the front door. She appeared from the sitting-room, while he was hanging up his hat and dusting his boots. He was particular in all that pertained to personal neat- ness. "Your step sounds weary,") she said. "It is very warm, really debilitating, to-day--is it not-? During his brief answer he surveyed her narrowly, the dread that had been gnawing his heart all the way home sharpening his vision in the search for signs of debility and disease. She, too, wore a white dress, but a black grenadine shawl was folded over her chest, and Roy's eye rested aghast upon the thin hand that held it together. What had he been thinking of, not to discern the -inroads of the destroyer in this, and in the finer oval of her face; in the slight cough that succeeded her question, and the hur- ried breathing he could hear in approaching her? If his awakening should have come too late! "I believe I have the Spring fever," he said, affecting to suppress a yawn. "This weather puts one in mind of country delights; makes him crave the smell of the freshy upturned earth, and the sight of green and growing things." "Then take -a look at my conservatory," she returned, playfully, leading thO way to the open bay-window. The sill, without ab'd within, was crowded with plants, I  *-  ,           S-S.'--.   358        JE24SSAINTE. She had been at work aimong them for an hour, and they were in their freshest trim. The pruning-scissors lay upon the shelf, and, taking them up, she clipped a sprig of heliotrope, another of mignonette, a rose-bud, and a bit of citron-aloes, bound them together with silk from her work-basket, and offered them smilingly. "Thank you. They are very sweet, very beautiful! How does the jessamine thrive "? "Not so well as it should-ungrateful little thing!" touching the leaves of a stunted vine which was honored with a china flower-pot and the sunniest stand in the win- dow. "I am afraid it cannot flourish in this high lati- tude. It needs warmer earth, less fitful sunshine. Or it may be that I am killing it with kindness," she added, shaking her head pensively. Roy detected another meaning in her thoughtfulness. Ungenial influences, unwelcome assiduity of attention, were sapping her vitality, and the analogy between her lot and that of her fading favorite was wearing upon her imagination. "We will tlry again." He had to clear his throat before he could speak. Jes- sie smiled slightly, with no misgiving of the communica- tion that awaited her. She even stooped to pick off a few withered leaves that had previously escaped her notice. The two were side by side within the recess; so near to- gether that the warm breeze blew the light folds of the wife's dress over the husband's arm; but she reeked no more of the wretchedness kept down by his strong will than if a thousand leagues of ocean divided them. -:"I have been thinking seriously all the way home of 'taking you to Dundee, and leaving you in Eunice's charge   JESSA 4 rNE.        359 for a time," continued Roy, presently. "You are not so rosy and light-footed here as you were among the moun- tains. And the sudden variations of our climate affect the human Jessamine also I You should have a change, and without delay." "I am very well-entirely contented!" she interposed, reddening vividly. "You are kind to say so!" gratefully. "But there are other reasons why you should anticipate the date originally set for your visit to your old home. Eunice has been very self-denying and patient, and she should have her reward. While you are regaining health and strength, winning back your lost roses, you can accumu- late a plentiful supply of seeds and roots 'of all descrip- tions, besides studying floriculture with your sister-if it be true, as :you would make me believe, that she excels you in skill. For in your absence I shall have a real conservatory built back of this room, and our long talked- of oriel run out here.", Jessie made a desperate effort to jest away the discus- sion. "Oh! as to the oriel, I have quite abandoned the project since Mrs. Wyllys told me--having learned from the Provosts that we meditated something of the sort- that oriels had 'gone out entirely; that no stylish house nowadays is disfigured by them.' The only thing re- semnbling the obsolete excrescences that would be admit- ted into a modern 'establishment' is a mullioned window, my good sir-! I should never hold up my head in Ham- ilton again if I were to offend so boldly against the rules of art governing the best society!" " The toss of her head and her tones were Mrs. Orrin's X:::   360         JEXSSAtMzNE. to the life. But Roy had hard work to smile. In his state of mind, badinage was like jesting over a death- bed. "Mrs. Wyllys must look the other way, then-at the majestic proportions of her cupola, if she likes, for the oriel is to be a fact next month. The work will be better done if I am on the ground to oversee operations, and it would not be pleasant for you to remain in the house while it is in confusion, not to mention the risk of taking cold fromn the damp walls and the open room, while the wall is down. It will be a convenience all around, you see." "If you really think that I will be in the way--" "I did not say that!" The correction was so prompt as to sound sharp. "But my judgment tells me that the plan- I suggest is the best for both of us.- My mind will be easier with regard to you if you are safe and happy in Eunice's care." Jessie had turned her face quite away, and seemed to be gazing at some object in the street. "I see!"' she said, finally. "When do you wish me to -go ." "Whenever it suits your convenience. If you desire nmy escort, we had best leave Hamilton on Saturday of this or the next week." "I can travel alone easily if it is not convenient for you to leave your classes. If you go on Saturday you lose Monday also. This is Tuesday. I can be ready byS Thursday morning. If the change be as needful as you suppose, the sooner it is made the better. As to an es- cort, a lady needs none when there is no change of cars." Roy pinched the succulent stems of his flowers until the  .            *    d0   JESSAMNE.         861 ,! perfume was hot and sickly. How impatient she was to be gone! , She had gasped when he opened the door of escape from her cage, as if she already saw "wild and winged liberty " beyond. "C You do not think it necessary to notify Eunice of your coming, then " he inquired. , "You can telegraph on Thursday morning, when you are fairly rid of me. Euna is always at home, and always ready and glad to see me. My visit will make her very happy." The rising tears broke through her assumed lightness. She struggled to drive them back, and failing, walked abruptly from the room.  - And thus the question was settled. Jessie began to pack that afternoon; working so dili- gently as to-be wan and appetiteless by supper time. Fanny Provost and her betrothed, Lieutenant Averill, who was in Hamilton on furloughi, called in the evening. Warren Provost and Selina Bradley came in afterward, and the hostess revived visibly in their society. Her eyes and color were brilliant; her laugh ready; her repartee pointed and felicitous. The young people, regretting the near prospect of her departure, fell to rallying her upon her partiality for country life, and she defended the preference with spirit. Then, at Fanny's earnest request, -she told the authentic legend of Dundee and "auld Davie," appearing to forget herself and her slavery (thought Roy), in her enthusiasm. "The women fought too!" ejaculated Selina, when it was finished. "They were made of different stuff from me, or any other young lady of this generation that I know. I    go into convulsions at the sight of an empty gun." ; I 1 6          .         .   362         f JESA TNR. "They were warring for home and freedom I rejoined Jessie. "To avoid captivity I would fight in the open field in the ranks. And so would you. But the love of liberty is oftener a passion with us mountaineers, than i with lowlanders." She caught her breath strangely- something between  j a sob and a laugh-which she tried tc cover with a cough. i ' A sad and ceaseless sigh 1" repeated the haunting demon in-Roy's heart.     ! The hilarious talk went on, unchecked by his occa- sional fits of abstraction. Jessie was like another being in the anticipation of liberation.  " Heartlessly cheerful!" said Selina, with her usual aptitude for making unlucky observations. "One would think you two were tired of each other  t already " she subjoined. "And you haven't been mar- ried more than half a yearl I shall tell this to papa. He raved over your mutual attachment and your devoted at- tentions to Mr. Fordham when he was sick, Jessie!?) "Say, at the same time, that she does not go, of her own accord I " said Roy-" but because I try to be as careful of her health as she was of mine. Although, if you had ever visited Dundee, you would not be scandalized by her desire to revisit it.)  Fanny, observing Jessie's quick, hot blush and averted eyes, and divining that something was ajar, came to the relief of the hardly pressed couple. "Did Jessie ever tell you, Mr. Fordham," she said, in  her liveliest tone-" of the astounding poetical effort put forth by her admirer, Mr. Lowndes, the rich student, they lsed to call him--entitled, 'Jessie the flower o' Dun-   JEESx4Xf1V     863 dee'!  The graceless youths of his class set it to the good old Scotch tune of that name. It was in a different imetre-very uncommon, I believe, and the fun of the joke was in fitting the words in, after the manner of ' Ancient Uncle Edward.' -I will get you a copy, and Warren here shall teach you how to sing it." -   '                  I At , - :\   CH'APTER  XXVI. oHE weather changed on the morrow.  Coming home at nightfall, Roy found Jessie It wstanding at the western window, surveying sorrow- %%e fully the unfavorable aspect of the heavens. " It will be very unpleasant travelling in the rain " she remarked as he entered. "The sun went down behind a portentous bank of clouds. And the wind is veering to the storm-quarter." It was evident that the possibility of a single day's delay made her restless and anxious., "The signs portend nothing worse than April showers, I hope, he encouraged her to believe. "Or, should there be a steady rain, you will soon run out of it into the region of blue skies and milder airs. I see no reason for altering your arrangements. You will be sheltered and dry in the cars." "True!" she answered, musingly, returning to her con- templation of the unpromising horizon.   E:             JErSSAM .N E..      '365 She was perturbed, however, and unusually taciturn while they were at supper; dull and spiritless during the hour they spent together in the sitting-room; arousing herself with apparent effort to reply to his remarks, and rarely offering one of her own accord. Roy's attempts at cheerful conversation were less evenly sustained than was?customary with him in her presence. It was not his intention that this last evening should be on p of gloomy constraint, but it approximated this more nearly every imo- ment. Both were abstracted, and each was unwilling that the other should discover the direction in which his and her thoughts were straying. So the pauses in the sluggish flow of talk became more and more frequent, until, at nine o'clock, Jessie arose, with a sigh of relief. "I must get a good night's rest, if I am to travel, to- morrow. Will you excuse me if I go upstairs, thus early?" "Do not let me detain you a moment. - Is there noth- ing I can do to assist you .5' "Nothing-thank you I There will be time to strap -my trunks in the morning. You still think I had better go-whatever may be the weather?" stopping with the door in her hand. "I do, certainly; that is, if you are not afraid of adding to your cold-if you are well enough." "My cold is nothing. I have ordered breakfast at half-past six. I am glad the train does not leave so early as it did last year. Good-night!" The cold, indifferent accents sank to the bottom of his heart like lead. What a millstone about this woman's- neck was her marriage vow I His endeavors to make it ir  lighter, and her existence endurable-the work to which he had given his best energies and wisest deliberations.;    366         JESSAMNE. the self-abnegation and prayerful struggle he had ac- cepted as the penalty of his grievous indiscretion, had proved futile. He had guarded eye, tongue, and action for five months; drilled them in friendly looks, words, and deeds, lest a glimmer of the affection that glowed- a pent but consuming fire in his soul-should offend or dismay her; had ministered to her with a lover's con- stancy and tenderness without a hint of love's reward. And this was the end! Some significant glance, an intonation, an excess of solicitude for her welfare, had betrayed his design to win her anew, and she had taken the alarm; was terrified and reluctant, without the power of escape. Or her constitution-physical and spir- itual-had succumbed to the attrition of duty against womanly instinct. With vain care he had kept her shackles out of sight. Everything in her surroundings; the very pronunciation of her name by acquaintances, had re- minded her continually of her anomalous position. Nei- ther wife, nor maid, she stood, according to her morbid perceptions, alone and banned, without so miuch as a title to the shelter of his roof, except as a bondwoman. Slhe could not forget that she was a slave. The untamable 'heart-in which the " love of liberty " was a "passion," was beating itself to death against the bars he had fool- ishy hoped to cushion and wreathe until she should cease to feel them as a restraint. , She had not loved him when she married him. That this change in her sentiments was not a passing girlish caprice, he had evidence in the words she had written:to him while the right of free speech remained to her. "Months- of doubt and suffering have brought me to the determination to confess this without reserve."   1A*\j       JESSAMNE.         367 "Doubt and suffering!" What were these to the horrors of ter actual bondage I : From which I cannot release her!" he repeated, for the thousandth time. His habit was to go to the library when she left him for the night, but he lingered, this evening, in the apart? ment he had fitted up for her with such fond pride; which she had made a sacred place. by her abiding. There was a cruel pleasure in noting the tokens of her recent presence; in inhaling the odors of the flowers she had tended; in touching the books she had handled. She could never be more to him than she was now. He believed that she must, from this hour, be less; that the solace of her friendship would. be withheld. Else, wl y her anxiety to, be away from him? her chafing at the threatened delay of a day in her flight back to the only real home she had ever known? Was the memory of the evanescent phantasy of her girlhood-the brief space during which she had deluded herself into the belief that she loved him, so sore and hateful that she would shun the sight of one who kept it in constant remem- brance a Could it be true that he had, in the face of these frightful odds, cherished a hope that he might yet persuade her into a preference for his companionship 8 A loud ring at the door-bell startled him into con- sciousness of the hour and place. Phoebe had gone up '! to bed, and Mr. Fordham went himself to admit the un- seasonable visitor. ;   -" "Good-evening!" said a familiar voice when the door was unclosed, and Dr. Baxter walked in as naturally anid ; coolly as if it were not ten o'clock at night, and he i  plentifully besprinkled with rain. "I was out thinking   368         JESSAM E. --and walking, after -the warm day-and chancing to observe that I was at your door, I stopped to say ' Good- bye ' to the lassie-to your wife.' Mrs. Baxter men- tioned to-night, at tea, that she was going to Dundee to- morrow." He had obeyed Roy's impulse in the direction of the sitting-room, but declined to take a chair. His cravat was a damp string; the handkerchief twisted about his left hand bore marks of terrific usage, and when he re- moved his hat, every one of his stiff gray hairs appeared to have gone into business on its own account, so distinct was its independent existence. His eyes were like those :of a partially awakened somnambulist, and his voice had dreamy inflections. Hlad his own mood been less sad, Roy must have smiled at the grotesque apparition, un- couth even to one so familiar with the peculiarities of the good- man, as was his coadjutor in the business of his life. As it was, he appreciated gratefully the love the old scholar bore his former ward, and the new proof of this, evinced by his stepping without the charmed circle of metaphysical or scientific lucubrations to pay this, for him, rare visit of neighborly courtesy and affectionate interest. "I am sorry Jessie has retired," he said, sincerely. "She would have been happy to see you. OBut, in view of to-morrow's journey, she went uip to her: :chamber an hour ago. I am afraid she is asleep by this time.' The doctor shook himself out-of a menacing relapse. "Eh! asleep-is she? Ah, well! that is as it should be. Don't disturb her 1!

She prizes your friendship very fondly." "Ah!" another mental shoulder-jog.  "We shall hardly see her again until autumn, I presume? I infer as much from what Mrs. Baxter has told me of her plans."  "There has been no definite time set for her return," said Roy, evasively, his heart heavier than before at the thought that Jessie had expressed to her Cousin a desire for a long sojourn in the country.   a Yet if he had failed to keep her with hi'r now, what : warrant had he for confidence in his ability to lure her back? : You will be lonely without her!" the worthy Presi- dent observed, something in the atmosphere of this, her especial apartment, conveying to his straying wits an in- distinct perception of the void her absence would make in the daily life of the man before him. In his own way, he missed his restless and faithful Jane when she was i.:; not at home. "I shall!"'

"The advent is expected towards the last of July, Mrs. Baxter says." - Conscious that, in the drunkenness -of his astonishment, he returned a lame and seemingly ungracious reply to offer and congratulations, Roy made no movement to de- tain the eccentric guest, when he, after another dazed look- around the apartment, as if wondering how he had got there, espied the door, and approached it: with the briefest of "Good-nights."' While the master of the house stood rooted to the floor, the visitant accomplished his exit, unchallenged and unattended. Another man would have taken mortal offence at the lack of respectful ceremony. The doctor, in his semi-trance, had not an idea of the commotion he lod excited. "I am not surprised that'I am an offence in her eyes- that she must accuse me in her heart, of being less than man,' muttered the husband, at length, passing a shaking hand over his pale forehead. "She ought to hate me for my seeming indifference-my unfeeling silence. She 'A\     JESSAME.                .    871 71'  would if she were not an angel. My poor girl! And she has borne it all, without a murmur; like the brave, true woman she is. GOD forgive me! I can never par- don, myself!" I He was sitting, his arms crossed upon the table, and his head laid upon them, when Jessie glided in stealthily. Over her white wrapper she had thrown a crimson shawl, and her long hair was loose upon her shoulders. What- ever resolve had drained her cheeks and lips of bloom, and lighted the steady flame in her eyes, had been acted upon with precipitancy, lest her nerve should fail. She halted upon the threshold, on seeing the bowed X figure; then advanced more rapidly, but without noise. "Roy! are you awake?" Yes."  But he did not lift his face. Eg ,  ( , aAre you sick!"t       X  - "Nol" " "Can you listen to me for a .few minutes a " ;:   - "As long as you wish."

" still less can'I leave you to-morrow, without -expressing ,:: to you, however feebly, my sense of the goodnes and mercy you have showed me from the hour I entered this I:;'- house, until now. I may have appeared unobservant .and unthankful; may have seemed to accept your benefits as if they were my due, when, in reality, I was unworthy of i;  tthe least of them all; but it was because I did not know in what form to express my gratitude. If, in my act::i:    372       ,  JESSA TrrVE. escence in your proposal thlt I should go to my sister for a season, I have used few words; have not thanked you for this fresh proof of your delicate watchfulness over my comfort and happiness, I beg you to attribute my shortcomings to other reasons than insensibility or miscon- struction of your motives. -I was entirely unprepared for the suggestion. It was a shock to me, because I had dared to believe: that you would see fit to let me remain here with you until vacation, when we could go to Dun- dee together." Standing on the other side ,of the table, she saw a ?H$ slighlt but eager change in the expression of the mute ^i. form. It was as if his hearing were strained for her next, utterance, but the features were still concealed. On the roof of the bay-window, the soft, large drops of the April shower were beginning to fall in musical whispers. . Jessie put out a hand upon the marble top of the table to steady herself, as AShe resumed. There was that in this continued- silence that awed and made her incoherent.  It was unlike Roy's usual reception of her advances-his ready and indulgent courtesy. Her heart beat pain- fuilly and fast, but she did not swerve from her resolu- tion. I know you so well-your purity of purpose; the standard of excellence you set for your motive and deed; your earnest desire to make me happy--that I fear you will, when I am gone, accuse yourself of want of skill or judgment in your treatment of me. I want you :to re- member then, that I broke through the reserve we have aided one another to maintain, to assure you that, in no one particular would I have had your action different   JESSA--- 37 3 from what it has been-that, in language and demeanor you have been alike noble. Deserving your reprobation, I have received tender respect; having forfeited by my -fickleness and falsehood all claim to kindness, I have been cherished as the truest wife in the land might hope to be. Something tells me that, when we part to-morrow, it will be to meet no more in time. It may be that the presentiment 'is borni of I my distempered imagination; but it has drawn my whole soul out in a longing I cannot- frame into speech, to be at peace with you; to feel your hand again upon my head; to hear you call me once-- . just once more, by the holy name of Wife! I "For I am your wife, Roy I Unworthy as I am of the title, it is the only glory I have. Until yesterday, I had dreamed of saying this to you in very different language and circumstances. It is just that this expectation should be disappointed. I do not appeal from my sentence of exile. But, by the memory of the love you once had for me-and I was full of faults then as. now--do not send me away, unforgiven, and starvingfor your affection-my husband!" When he' looked up, she was kneeling at his side, her eyes streaming with the tears that: had impeded her utter- ance. Still dumbly, he drew her to him; put back l:the hair from her face, every line of his own astir with a passion of pity and adoration she hardly dared to look upon. It was a minute before he could articulate. Then. the tense lips were moved into womanly softness. * "You can forgive mne, then, my Wife! Thank GOD " He laid his cheek to hers, and she felt the great sobs of; - the breast against which she leaned.     874       -- JE SSAMNE.  -  But for a long time, there was nothing more said. Except by the rain-drops whispering over their heads, broken, now and then, by the wind into little gushes that sounded like laughter, happy to tearfulness.                  t*   Is  .

CHAPTER XXVIL.    - i  (Se N the plenitude of her cousinly compassion for the lonely, husband, Mrs. Baxter coaxed her spouse into escorting her to Mr. Fordham's, on Thursday evening. The wind had settled into an easterly gale, after yesterday's genial warmth; the day had been unpleasant, and the clouds were still dripping at irregular intervals, as if wrung by impatient hands. "But it is an act of common humanity to visit the poor fellow in his solitude, 'my dear, while his desolation is - i,  fresh upon him!" she sighed, sympathetically. "Mr. Fordham was in the library," said Pllhoebe, with -i  an air of bewilderment at the lady's query, and to the ; library the consoler accordingly tripped, with footfall of ;}  c down, and countenance robed in decorous and becoming i -pensiveness. i'i  Her light tap was unanswered, but uncertain of this, Il  she took the benefit of the doubt, and entering bounc- ingly as was her habit, she surpri sed Jessie sitting upon   376        JESSA:VryTE. her husband's knee, one hand buried in his hair, the other clutching his beard, in a fashion at once undigni- fled: and saucy. Both were laugling so heartily that their neglect of the warning knock was explained. When the confusion of mutual explanations was over, Mrs. Baxter learned, to her amazement, that the journey to Dundee was postponed until after the College Com- mencemlent. I w/ouldn't go when I found that Roy wanted to get rid of me!" said the transformed wife. '\ When I put him into the confessional, he owned who was his fellow- conspirator in the scheme for my banishment. For shame, Cousin Jane! I have long suspected you of a weakness for the handsome Professor, but you sit convicted of a deliberate attempt to remove him from the guardianship of his legal protector, that your designs upon his affec- ^ti'mis might be more vigorously prosecuted.. And no sooner do you suppose that the coast is clear, than you pre- sent yourself, arrayed in your best dress and choicest ; - " smiles, and with actually a rose-bud in your brooch! to make' sure of your game. I shall never trust in human friendship again!" : "s You are ungenerous to-triumph over me so openly-- and in the poor, dear doctor's hearing!" returned her cousin, holding her fan before her face, with a theatrical show of detected guilt. "I ought to have some compensation for the excruciat- ing anguish the discovery cost me," retorted Jessie. "Tongue cannot describe the tremendous struggle I went through before I could bring myself to undertake the in- vestigation of your perfidy and his susceptibility. I know just how Esther felt when she screwed her courage   ;!"IL  -         'JES1SAtM B.      . 3" ;-?: to the sticking-point, and made up her mind and her tdilette'to face Ahasuerus and a possible gallows." Roy was pretending to listen to the doctor's elaborate . disquisition upon an important political question, but he stole a sidelong glance at the sparkling face; across the hearth, and smiled, in gladness of content. She was his blithe, lovesome witch again. The baleful enchantment that had ensnared her fancy and distracted her thoughts from dwelling upon him and his love--(he refused to believe that he had ever lost her heart)--was ,destroyed, and, by him, remembered no more as a thing -of dread. More to spare him pain than to shield Orrin, Jessie had not. entered into the particulars of her estrangement, or revealed who was the prime agent, in bringing it about. Wyllys' name was not mnentioned by either. "I had a bad, wild dream-" she thus explained her . defection. "A dream that made me doubt you-Heavenl: --myself-everything! that robbed me of love and hope, with faith. I was susceptible, giddy, undisciplined; and I was grievously tempted by an evil spirit. Maybe"- ' humbly-- I am no better or wiser now; but I am ready X and thankful to .give myself up to your guidance. I! ought to be a good woman in future; for I have been  dealt with very tenderly by my Heavenly Father- and If. by you, my best earthly friend!" Roy had no fear. His second wooing was, he felt, crowned with richer, more enduring success than the first had been. He cared'not to ask, or to conjecture by what art his image had been clouded over, since he saw, it now clearly mirrored in a heart tried by refining fires. The christening feast was not held until December, aEL   378        JESSA NE X  which date Master Kirke Lanneau Fordham was four months old. Eunice had taken her school and cottage for a year, and the interestingfjte could not be appointed until she could make her arrangements to be with her sister. Work for the good of others, and wholesome meditation, had brought to her, as they must to all healthy, GOD- fearing souls, healing and peace during the months she i had spent in her new domicile. With the June vacation ^ had come Jessie and her husband; and when the little ^ claimant upon their love and care arrived, the lonely woman, who had put thoughts of her own wifehood and maternity from her forever, when she turned the key !: upon the souvenirs of her one love-dream, opened her  :- heart and took in, with the babe, comfort and hope that  were, to her, fresh and beautiful life. What Roy's arguments and Jessie's entreaties could not accomplish, he innocent young eyes and clinging baby-fingers effected within a month after her nephew's birth. If Kirke went to Hamilton, she would follow, she promised,  and early December -saw her domesticated in the Ford- ham household.            .         ; "I wish Orrin Wyllys and his wife were not coming, ; this evening!" said Jessie, confidentially, to her sister, as i they were arraying the boy for the grandzbccasion.  Eunice looked in no wise surprised at the impetuous Si exclamation, albeit it was the first avowal of dislike of pt Roy's relative she had ever heard from Jessie's lips. i "It would not have been expedient to omit them from your list of invitations, my dear 1 ' she returned, with her slow, bright smile. "For Rloy's sake, you must disguise 1 your antipathy.'               -- ,\. o      *- '          ',   JEssA MNE.         379 "Antipathy isn't too strong a word, Euna! You can- not understand what reason I have to distrust that man!- to despise both himself and his wife! And the debut of Papa's boy ought to be all brightness to Mamma!" sus- pending the process of the .toilette to strangle him with caresses. "He cannot hurt you now, love. Even poisonous breathbsoon passes from finely-tempered steel." " The look and tone silenced the other. Eunice's insight of the tempter's true character was deeper than she had imagined. Even she never dreamed how, and at what cost, the knowledge was gained. Miss Kirke was an attractive feature of the assembly that night. Many thought her handsomer-than her more lively sister. There was not one present who would not hlave ridiculed the idea of a comparison between her classic beauty and Mrs. Wyllys' shrewish physiognomy. ' Once, the two ladies. talked together for five minutes, :  near the centre of the front parlor, the light from the   I chandelier streaming on both. Eunice was dressed with her usual just taste, in a lustreless mourning slk, a tiny illusion ruff enhancing the fairness of neck and face, her abundant hair arranged simply without ornament.  She possessed the rate accomplishment of standing still without stiffness, and no nervous :play of fingers or feat- ures marred the exquisite repose of her bearing, as she. listened to or replied to her companion. Hester was in the full glory of brocade, diamonds, and point lace, with French flowers twisted in her pale tresses, and trailing bramble-wise down her back. She fidgeted incessantly; her skin was muddy with bilious-  ness and discontent; she perked her faint eyebrows into * - ' ;  .-.* *;,' -',   380         JESSA AINE a frown, every other minute; her lalugh was forced, and the viscid tones had a twang of pain or ill-humor. She was getting very tired of keeping up the appearance of conjugal felicity with so little assistance from her lord; growing bitterly conscious of the motives that had im- pelled him to the uncongenial marriage, and disposed to eyet jealously every woman to whonm he paid the most trifling attention.                 - "I suppose you are baby-mad, like the rest?" she said, pulling viciously at the golden chain of her bouquet- holder. "I am in a deplorable minority here, to-night. Christening-parties are always a bore to me. I am so sincere, you know, so apt to say what I think, that I can never go into raptures over the little monkeys, as every- body else does. I presume, now, that it is considered rather a nice child--if there is such a thing-isn't it?" "We think him a noble little fellow; but we do not require the rest of jthe world to agree with us," replied Eunice, with unruffled politeness. "I detest children! just perfectly abominate babies! I wouldn't have one for a kingdom. And Orrin loves his own ease too much to want them. He is an awful hypocrite, Miss Kirke. You were very wise not to get married. He can't abide children "--raising her voice- "although he:is making a fool of himself over that bun- dle of lace, lawn, and flannel yonder." Eunice, inwardly provoked at the irreverent and in- : elegant description of the royal cherub, could yet respond, with apparent composure. ' He does it from a sense of duty, or a desire to please, probably." She followed the direction of the wife's scornful eyes.   -           - .' JESKSA/AS.        3' 81  The folding-doors were open, and through the arch. way, they had a view of the mother, tempting her boy with a flower she had taken from a bouquet, near by, laughing at his open mouth, starting eyes, and fluttering arms, -as he tried to seize it. Orrin had approached-'her while his wife was speaking to Eunice; accosted her be- fore she was aware of his vicinity. His remark, deliv- ered with his most insinuating smile, and in his inimita- ble manner, was evidently a compliment to the beauty of the child; but she met it with lightness bordering upon contempt. Dropping the flower, she lifted the babe from lhis temporary throne on the stuffed back of an easy chair, and walked away. Mrs. Wyllys tittered shrilly, and clapped her hands. "A decided rebuff!" she sneered, more loudly than good breeding would have counselled. "It is strange, Miiss Kirke, that your lady-killer is so slow to learn the mortifying fact that he ceases to be irresistible when he has been guilty of the mistake of matrimony." Orrin, nervously sensitive to her tones, heard and saw her, while he affected to do neither; saw, likewise, by whom she was standing, and that she -showed beside her neighbor as a tawdry, artificial rose, faded and tumbled, does when near a stately, living lily. Seeing and admitting all this, he heaved an inaudible sigh that did not touch his eyes or chasten his careless smile. His inward moan was not---"Me miserable!" or, Fool that I was!" or anything else poetical or tragic; but-"If I could have afforded it!" "The fair E na will wear better than mi cara sposac!" he owned, candidly. "But: money outlasts beauty, and is more necessary to a man's happiness. Love is only a    382         JESSAMJX.      . luxury; an indulgence too costly for the enjoyment of most wedded pairs. Beryl eyes and a Greek profile would not have paid my debts, nor the future claims of carriage makers, and horse-jockeys, and yacht-builders. No! I have done all that man could, in the like circumstances. Better bread burttered on both sides by Hester, than a dry slice with Eunice." He e owed Miss Kirke no grudge; found placid satis- faction in reviewing their intercourse, akin to that he ex- perienced in the contemplation of a fine, mezzo-tinto en- graving or a moonlit landscape. But Jessie irritated and piqued him. If her gay insensibility were bravado, he would yet make her drop the mask. His wife was right in affirming that the passion for conquest was not extinct after a year of married bliss. "She did worship me in those days!' he ruminated. "Worshipped; me madly and entirely, as men. are seldom loved, as few women are capable of loving. Does she take me for an idiot in supposing that I credit the thoroughness of her cure!" Lounging in a desultory way through the rooms, bowing to this, and exchanging a pleasant word with that one of the friends collected to do honor to the infant scion of the house, he contrived to waylay Jessie in the hall. She had transferred the"baby to the nurse's care,and was re- turning to her guests. A fierce impulse possessed him as he marked her happy face, flushed by excitement into loveliness that had never been hers in her girlhood. She was passing him with a slight and nonchalant bow, when he arrested her. ' Can I speak with you for a moment "   EI.        JESSA MNAE.   -383 "Nowj" she said, dubiously, looking toward,. the parlors crowded with company. ".Now! I can wait no longer! Is any one in the library a . Before she could reply, he had pushed the door back, and led her in. The room'was not needed for the use of the guests, and was unlighted except by the low fire in the grate. "I will light the gas!" said Jessie, trying to withdraw her hand from his clutch. He tightened the grasp. It is said that every man is a savage at some time of his life. The brutish devil was rampant now in the polished citizen of the world, the in- dolent epicure. If he were ever to regain his lost inlflu- ence, it must be by a couzp d'tat-by threats, rather than flattery. He would show her what she risked in attempt- ing to dupe and foil him. A desperate expedient, but the case was not a hopeful one. "What affectation of prudery is this?" he asked, roughly. "Time was when you were less scrupulous about granting me interviews in the firelight. Do you imagine, silly child, that your overacted farce of wifely devotion blinds me as it does the fools you have called together to- night to witness this pretty display of domestic felicity? Or "--his tone changing suddenly--" that any amount of coldness and' cruelty can extinguish my love for you  the love you once confessed-in my arms-was recipro- cated by yourself, then the betrothed of him, who now believes you to be his loyal consort? You -have found it arn easy task to deceive him, because it is not in him to -; worship you as I do. You may struggle to escape from me, but you know I am speaking the truth, and leaving    384        JESSA M /y half of it untold. Don't drive me to distraction, Jessie  or I shall divulge that which your husband, with all his phlegmatic philosophy, may resent. Resent, possibly, upon me-certainly upon you--in treatment you will find it hard to bear. "? I have warned you before, that generous forgiveness of an offense to his dignityv and self-love is a height of virtue unknown to Roy Fordham. I warn you that you are dealing with a desperate, becaise a miserable  ^man!!"  "This is a- specimen of the superior manliness, the lofty magnanimity you vaunt as your characteristics--is it?"  She had wrested her hand from him. , The faint, red glare revealed the outlines of a figure drawn up to its full height, and instinct with anger and defiance. The clear accents were stinging hailstones. "I am not afraid of you, if I do shrink from your touch. I am glad you have given me this opportunity to, say what you ought to know. You played upon my inex- perience and loneliness, when I was committed--a too trustful child-to your care by my betrothed and my father. You tampered with my active imagination and my credulity, until you wrought in my mind false and florid views, of life; and when your train was ready to be fired, insinuated suspicions--which you knew were groundless!--of Roy Fordham'shonor, and his fidelity to me.5, "I suggested no suspicions!" he interrupted. "You nourished the germs planted by Hester Sanford's slander. And when I did not know where, or upon what I stood; when my brain was teeming with unhealthy fandies, and my heart sick with fever and thirst, you   nI k lJESSS A           NE.        885 offered me what you called love-dragged from me the admission that it was returned." "Since perfect frankness is the order of the day, allow me to observe that the 'dragging' was not a difficult process!" interjected Wyllys, offensively. "I am willing to allow your amendment-if you will consent to have me repeat this story in detail to all who are assembled in the other room," she returned, undaunted. "' I should enjoy the task, because it would pave the way. for an avowal I should exult in proclaiming to the uni- verse. It is that I value the least hair of my husband's head more than I ever did you-body, soul, and what you denominate as your heart; that-I had rather serve him as a bond-slave, and never receive a word or glance of affection, if I might live near and for him-than to reign an Empress at your side; that I Lever comprehend the height, depth and fulness of his condescension and love at any other time as when I reflect that these are bestowed upon a woman who was once misled into the conviction that you were a true man, and that she cared for you. I stand ready to say all this-and more. I am no weak girl, now, to be terrified by bughears. There is a per- fectness, even of human love, that casteth out fear. You I forget this when you threaten me with my husband's displeasure." She laughed, and all the corners of the quiet room caught up the mirthful echoes. "Why, if Roy stood where you do, I could tell him all you have said, without a blush or tremor. That I have never done this, you owe to my reluctance to betray to him the baseness of one in whose veins runs the, same blood as in his. I would spare him the pain and shae-    386 '        JlEESSA4 MrE. of seeing you for what you are. But I wish he knew everything!  "-I think he does!" While she was speaking, a-shape had loomed into mo- tion from a recess formed by two bookcases at the further end of the library, and was now at her side. As her hus- band's voice greeted her astonished ears, she felt his sup- porting arm about her. "Hush, my darling l" he said,-at her stifled scream. "I came in for a book just before you entered. After hearing Mr. Wyllys' preliminary remark I thought it best to let you vindicate yourself without my help. Not that I needed to hear your justification, but I meant that he should. We will go back to our friends, now. Shall I tell Mrs. Wyllys that ybu are waiting to take her home?" to Orrin. "If you please," was the equally formal reply. A -week later, Selina Bradley brought Mrs. Baxter a piece of startling news. "It is certainly true I " she insisted, as the other looked her incredulity. "The house and furniture are offered for sale. It is very doubtful when they will return. They may reside abroad for years-take u? their perma- nent abode in Paris. Mr. Wyllys affects to treat the plan as-one they have been considering this great while, but there are queer stories afloat. Hester is indiscreet, you know. They had a violent scene in the hearing of the servants on their return from the Fordhams' christening party. The most unlikely, but a popular, rumor is that Iester was furiously jealous of her husband's attentions :  tsit , si eor her sister, that night. She threatened to : - -. r' X; &.,..-^' ., -   Ift '  *       JSSAMJ&A E. WY       .;387 leave him, and go home to her father, unless he would. take his oath never to speak to either of them again." "You may well say 'unlikely!'"Mrs. Baxter said, eyeing the doctor apprehensively, as he sat up to his eye- brows in a book at a distant window. "They are going to Paris, you say?" The doctor had lowered his volume, let go his cravat, and pushed up his spectacles. "So Hester says, and is in ecstasies (apparently) at the prospect. As for Mr. Wyllys, he professes to think American society a very wishy-washy affair compared with Parisian circles." "Humph!" snorted the doctor. "They" could not choose more wisely and consistently. Paris is the world's repertory of gilded shams!"  He tied a double knot in his handkerchief. THE END.   - n * x 7 . ,  * /     it BOOK ,                  AND NEW EDITIONS, ?

Among the numerous editions of the works of this gr eatest of Eng- lish Novelists, there has not been until now one that entirely satisfies the public demand ....    Without exception, they each have some --strong distinctive objection, . . .   either the shape and dimensions. of the volumes are unhandy-or, the type is small and indistinct- or, the paper is thin and poor-or, the illustrations [if they have any] are unsatisfactory-or, the binding is bad-or, the price is too high. A new edition is now, however, published by G. W. Carleton & Co. of New York, which, it is believed, will, in every respect, completely satisfy the popular demand.    It is known as "Carletolas  New  Illustrated Edition; " The size and form is most convenient for holding, the type is entirely new, and of a clear and open character that has received the approval of the reading community in other popular works. The illustrations are by the original artists chosen by Charles Dickens himself .   and the paper, printing, and binding are of the most attractive and substantial character. The publication of this beautiful new edition was commenced in April, 1873, and will be completed in 20 volumes-one novel each month--at the extremely reasonable price of $1.50 per. volume, as follows :- 1- THE PICKWICK PAPERS.   MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT. 2--OLIVER TWIST.      I2-OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. 3-DAVID COPPERFIELD.     I3-TALE OF TWO CITIES. 4-GREAT EXPECTATIONS.

Her characters are always life-like, and she makes them talk and act like human beings, subject to the same emotions, swayed by the same passions, and actuated by the same motives which are common among men and women of every day existence. Mrs. Holmes is very happy in portraying domestic life. Old and young peruse her stories with great delight, for she writes in a style that all can comprehend.";- New York Weekly. "Mrs. Holmes' stories are all of a domestic character, and their interest, therefore, is not so intense as if they were more highly seasoned with sensational, ism, but it is of a healthy and abiding character.' Almost any new book which her publisher might choose to announce from her pen would get an immediate and, general reading. The interest in her tales begins at once, and is maintained to the clqse. Her sentiments are so sound, her sympathies so'warm and ready, and her knowledge of manners, character, and the varied incidents of ordinary life is so thorough, that she would find it difficult to write any other than an excellent tale if she were to try it."-Boston Banner. "Mrs. Holmes is very amusing; has a quick and true sense of humor, a sympathetic tone, a perception of character, and a familiar, attractive style, pleasantly adapted to the comprehension and the taste of that large class of American readers for whom fashionable novels and ideal fantasies have no charm."-H-enry  .
