CHAPTER I.
WHERE BORN-WHEN DOUBTFUL-THE BEACH
OF ~ ISLAND-MY NURSE AND HER
MARVELS-SINBAD AND GULLiVER-THE CITY
GUARDS IN CHARLESTON, S. 0.-MY DREAM-
REFLECTIONS ON COMMENCING MY AUTOBIO-
GRAPHY.
Our family Bible has been lost, and there has
been a dispute about my age. Phrenologically, I
have no memory for dates and the chronological
sequence of events; and if I had, I could not settle
this point. At auiy rate, I was born many yeais
within this century, in the city of Charleston,
South Carolina. But my childhood has not many
memories of my earliest home, though I am proud
of it, and say of it as the poet said of his:
fS With all thy faults, I love thee still."
What I most remember is the beach of Sullivan's
island, where we used to spend the summer for
the sake of health. With a fascinated fear I loved
to stand, when a very child, on the extremity of
the beach, and behold the illimitable waves gamboll-
ing before me like so many living beii~gs of the
deep at play. I delighted to pick the shells strew-
ed around, and marvel over their construction and
beauty. And many a time have I set1 the mimic
boat of my childish workmanship afioi~t upon the
waters while I watched the wave, thinking it was

coming at me as I advanced to its edge to launch
my chip-built vessel. I can remember, too, the in-
tense wish I had to send my vision far beneath
the waves and discover the secrets of the deep
below.
What must have impressed this more upon me
was the fact that I had often heard the nurse who
attended me--a mulatto slave who had been taught
to read-tell of the adventures of Sinbad the s~tilor
and the equally miraculous ones of the reno~4 ned
Gulliver. I do believe that the wish to get by
myself and know all about these wonderful trav-
ellers created my first desire to learn to read; for
though my nurse often read the exploits of these
worthies aloud to me, yet I was puzzled with parts
of their narratives more than I thought I should
have been if I could have read it myself. This
was owning, no doubt, not only to my inability to
comprehendd the meaning of many of the words, but
also to the nurse's manner of pronouncing them,
for they often puzzled her. In fact, when she
came to a word that was at all a poser, she gener-
ally took a flight over it, scorning such trammels to
her comprehension of the story. If she confe3~d
her ignorance to herself:, she certainly never con-
fessed it to me. Whenever I asked an explana-
tion of any part of the story she always rattled off
with all the volubility of her race. Her commen-
tary often puzzled me, by the by, more than the ~.A

text itself. How I hive woi3d~ered over the confir-
sion it created in my brain; graver commentators
since, on more veracious books hawe reconciled me
to such bewilderments.
Whenever the nurse took me out walking in
the city, I insisted upon going down by the wharf,
for I loved to gaze at the shippirtgand wonder over
the sailors-$inbad and Gulliver being all the
while in my imagination. The old French ne-
gresses who sold cakes at the corners,, often at-
tracted my attention and my pennies-the last by
the tempting display of their tables,' and the first
by their confused babel of French, English and
African phraseology combined. I used to marvel
why I could not understand these cake sellers, who1
my nurse, to heighten herself in my eye, had told
me could not read, and who were nothing but old
women, when I could comprehend such wonderful
men as Sinbad and Gulliver, and had painted in
my mind's eye an exact piebure of overy thing they
had seen and encountered.
In Charleston, in those days, for I have never
been there since, the guardians of the city-who in
the eastern cities are called the watch, and who~
pass along through the streets in their daily citi-
zen's dress unarmed, except with a spike-headed
weapon-were denominated guards, and appeared
in uniform, with muskets and music. At a certain
hour each night they paraded from one guard hopse
to the other, and well do I remember the first
night I saw rhem pass, by the dim lights of the
lamps. It was the first time that I had been awake
till nine, (the hour they paraded) and thiC had
happened in consequence of the indulgence of my
nurse, who allowed me to sit up, as my parents
were at a party and would not be home till after
midnight.
I had seen the volunteer companies through the
day, when they were "playing soldiers," and I
had heard them fire their guns, which I was in-
formed had no ballets in them, as it was only
"make believe," but these guards my nurse told
me had bullets in their guns. and that they took
evil doers, even boys when they were bad, and
thrust them in a huge, dark cellar, which had iron
bark across the windows. That huge, dark cellar
and those iron bars kept me awake half the night.
And when I fell asleep I thought myself a bad

[OGRAPHY OF
boys locked up in their durance, and guarded by a
ferocioas soldier, who kept. continually pointing
his gun at me. This was but a dream, a child's
dream, yet its horrors live in my memory strong-
er than m'an~ a stern reality. Frequently since
have I looked back through the struggles of man-
hood to that dream of my boyhood, and felt the con-
viction that many a hard encounter with flesh and
blood and stormy passions, had not half the fears of
that night's fancies. ' "Is not the past all sha-
dow?" asks the poet, and if it is not, the shadow,
even when it gathers qver our manhood, is some-
times more painful than the reality.
I feel a strange waywardness' as I lift the pen te
narrate my adventures. Shall I fully draw back
the curtaia?-shalj 1 tell all'?-or shall I play and
palter with the truth, heighten my good deeds with
the meretricious adornments of the imagination, and
lessen my evil ones by borrowing the same light,
and when I tell them, interweaving apologising
constructions with their guilt. Reader, you must
bear with me. If a ~vild and way ward course has
been mine, you must bear with me. Perhaps the
best man, if he exposed thoroughly to human in-
spection all his motives as well as actions, would
startle you as much with the exposure of 'tempts
tion; that he sometimes did not soon enough re-
sist, as he would impress you with the admiration
of his good deeds.
When I contemplated these hurried sketches
and threw my memory back to the past, a 'thousand
dim and shadowy images presented themselves.
Here and there a passion or event arose distinctly,
but as 1 dwelt upon it, the wonder came that it was
not of more importance in my history. Is it not
strange that when we make the greatest effort to
recall events, that we do not feel them half so viv-
idly as at some seemingly mal-a-propos moment,
when they flash upon us unbidden, and like the
ghost of Banquo will not down.

Until I get into the full tide of ~ny not unevent-
ful life, my reminiscences will be somewhat desul-
tory, but I trust not indistinct. I mean to portray
feelings as well as events, and my reader shall
have them as they occurred, or rather as I remem-
ber them in writing. Dear reader, for you shall
be dear unto me 'as a friend, and with the unre-
servedness of friendship, I will make you my con~
fidant, thinking that your sympathies will give
me aid and countenance in my narration.
My grandfather was named Antoine Berthold,
and was a descendant of a French refugee, whose
ancestors fled from France on the revocation of the
edict of Nantz, and settled in South Carolina.. My
grandfather brought with him considerable means,
with which he purchased a plantation on the little
'Pedee, in conducting which he was unsuccessful.
With the remnant of means left him, after paying
his debts, with the mercurial adaptation of a French
man, he rexnoved to Charleston, and became a
commission merchant in King street. He soon
took the "fever" and died, leaving my father a
destituteorphan, for my paternal grandmother had
died of the same disease a few months after their
emigration.
A Carolina gentleman, named John Russell,
who was a great friend of my grandfather's, adopt-
ed my father, upon the condition that he would
take his name, promising, if he did so, to leave him
his property, which at that time was ample. My
father,' not without some hesitation, complied, for
he had a crotchet in his head about family pride.
'In due time Mr. Russell set my father up in the
hardware business, which was his choice. A short
time after this my father married a Miss Huger-
son, and I was their first and only son.
One day when playing on the beach of Sulli-
van's island, through the carelessness of rnj nurse,
I fell in and 'like to have ended my adventures, as

Miss Betsy Hugerson, who was written to on the
subject, and the next packet brought her to Charles-
ton to take charge of me on its return to Baltimore.
She was a fat, solemn, gossiping old lady, who
soon won my affections by gingerbread. sweetmeats
and all sorts of kindness. Under her charge I was
dispatched to Baltimore, not then the "Monumen-
tal City." My father bid me a good bye without
much emotion, but my dear mother wept over me
again and again, went down with the nurse on
board of the packet with us, and held' me on her
lap weeping over me, until we got under way,
when she blessed me with an overflowing heart
and left me to the charge of aunt' Betsy, who had
peremptorily refused to let my nurse go with us,
saying to my mother, with much intended dignity:
"I certainly consider myself old enough, and strong
enough, and knowing enough' to take care of a
child like William-Billy will ~be a~ good boy, I
know." The poor lady little dreamed, of the re-
spuasihility she 'was assuming.
I was too young 'to observe much of the
voyage,' and could not if .1 'had been older, for~I
was sea sick all the time,' and confined closely to
the cabin by my aunt, who seemed to think that
fresh sea air was certain death.
The United States wer~ just then on the eve of
a war with Great Britain, and the indefinable
dread of its horrors, which I caught from the con-
versatien of the passengers, I r~rnember yet. Our
captain was a great advocate for hostilities, as was
also a French gentleman. There was a New
Englander on board who took the other side, and
remember well that the words federalist and
democrat were hurled to and fro like bomb shells
between belligerents, and 'they seemed, in a social
point of view, to cause as much explosive an-
noyance.
We landed in Baltimore a feW days before the

great spirit from the popular fury, until the exasper-
ation of the mob, occasioned by the death of a citi-
zen, who was shot from one of the windows, burst
all bounds, when the military were ordered out by
the authorities, and the inmates of the office were
taken to jail as the only place of security. The
story of!the murder of several of them by the mob,
who had gathered in the night and broken open the
jail, is well known. I recollect seeing the defend-
ers of that office taken to jail in a hollow square,
surrounded by the volunteer companies, and fol-
lowed by their yelling and howling assailants. My
aunt held me by the skirts of my jacket to prevent
me in my eagerness !from pitching out of4~e win-
dow. Many of the prisoners, for such Hanson's
friends might be called, had their coats off, with
handkerchiefs tied round their heads. A day or
two afterwards my aunt took me out into the coun-
try to spend some time with a cousin of my mother's
named Stetson, who happened to live in the neigh-
borhood of one of the ringleaders of the mob named
Mumma. The latter was a butcher, and lived in
a red frame house near the road. He had a drum
and fife playing the rogue's march at his establish-
ment every' night for a weel~ or more. A federal
gentleman, a friend of Mr. ~tetson, who had fled
from the mob, left the city, and as Mr. Stetson was
a democrat, came out for safety to his country-
house. He welcomed' him warmly, but his lady
was frightened into hysterics with the fear that
Mumma and his friends would find out who their
inmate was and inflict mob law upon them for har-
boring him. When the gentleman saw this he was
about taking his leave, butMr. Stetson peremptorily
insisted upon his remaining, and he did so.
That night Mumma came up to the house, but it
was merely to know if Mr. Stetson, whom he sup-
plied with meat, wanted any in the morning. 'He
was a large, big-headed fellow, brim full of mob-
ocracy, the rights of man, and proscription of the
Federalists. Mr. Stetson was himself a great dem-,
~    ocrat, and hated Hanson, but he respected the laws,
andtold Mamma to his face that he expected to see
the slayers of General Lingan tried, found
~uUty, and executed for murder. Mumma mut-

[OGRAPHY 01?
tered surlily something or other to himself and
walked off.
Mrs. Stetson, who with my aunt had been a
fearful listener at the window, called out to Mam-
ma not to forget the meat in the morning. He re-
plied in a pleased tone: "I'd do anything for you,
Madam," and walked away more cheerfully.
I knew this man in after years. I do not know
whether it was ever proved conclusively that he
was one of the slayers in the jail, but this I know,
that if ever the mob was alluded to in his presence,
he was always sure to scowl and walk away.
Doubtless the old inhabitants of Baltimore, some
of whom might say perchance-
"All which I saw and part of which I was."
remember the causes of this mob; while I, a little
child, only caught a passing glimpse of some of its
slight incidents. The violent course of the Fed-
eral Republican in relation to the war, was the ex-
citing cause of the mob. For vindictive assaults
upon President Madison and other prominent states-
men of that day, it surpassed every thing of the
kind from that day to this. It excited the people
to madness. On the Declaration of War against
Great Britain, the Republican came out in hot
haste against it, and its leader was headed: "Thou
hast done a deed whereas valor will weep.~~
At the time of the war I was dwelling in the city
with aunt Betsy, and when the bombardment of
Fort Mdllenry "came ~ to use a phrase of the
turf, Mr. Stetson invited us out to his farm, that
we might be out of ~ way should. the foe suc-
ceed in taking Baltimore. His country seat was
some miles from the city, on the York road, and yet
we could distinctly hear the "bombs bursting in
air," the night of the attack. Miss Hugerson used
to lead me down to the road side to see the volun-
teers from the interior as they flocked in to the de-
fence of the city; and it was glorious to hear their
animated greetings as they passed. 0! how I
longed to be a man and a soldier.
After the British retreated from North Point, a
party was made up to visit the battle ground, and
my aunt, fearful that some accident might happen
to me if she left me behind, took me with her. I
remember nothing of the locality, except the meet-
ing house; the trees and fence were filled with bul.~

lets, and I shuddered beside the fresh and rudely
made graves of the slain.
The illumination for the victory of New Orleans
and peace vividly impressed me. The streets
were as light as day. 'A thot~and devices of a per-
sonal as well as patriotic character blazed in the
transparencies that were affixed to many of the pri-
vate as well as public edifices. The streets were
thronged with a rejoicing crowd, composed of the
fashionable as well a~ the vulgar, who greeted each
other gaily as they passed, for all seemed proud of
their . country and her people. It seemed like a
scene in the Arabian Nights entertainment. The
earth lost its earthiness, and after I was put to bed
I wondered and wondered over it until I was
transported into the )and of dreams, the glitter-
ing scenes of which, though full of Qriental niag-
nificence, have never 'impressed me more than
that illumination.

-1 CAPiTULATE FRQM UNDER THE BED.
How strong is the love of woman! My aunt
was upwards of fifty when she undertook the voy-
age from Baltimore to Charleston for my sake; or
rather it was for my mother's sake, to whom she
was ardently attached. Me she had never seen,
but she loved me extempore for my maternity.
Instead of assuming any control over me, the
good old lady generally gave me my own way in
every thing, until some outrageous prank on my
part, drove her beyond all forbearance, and then
she belabored me with great zeal, puffing and
wheezing the while, and sometimes weeping with
very vexation.
We lived in Calvert street at the time to which
I allude, and my aunt had an ancient gossip named
Clayton, who dwelt iii an old fashioned frame build-
ing situated where the Athtmieum now stands.
Mrs. Clayton was poor, and my aunt never made

RUSSELL.                                13
her a visit without taking her a present of some
kind of other. Now my mother had given the
old lady a quantity of imperial tea, which, chanced,
a rare chance, to suit the old lady's palate exactly,
and she had brought it all the way from Charleston
with an especial eye to Mrs. Clayton and the talks
she anticipated over it.
One winter's evening, my aunt was seated by the
fire snugly cogitating to herself, when all at once
it occurred to her that she would take some of the
tea on the morrow afternoon to her friend. Ac-
cordingly she ordered the servant to hand her a
large tea canister which contained it, and she fixed
~a newspaper on her lap ready to make up a pack-
age of it.
It was much the custom of the boys in my day,
as I presume it is still, to play what they call hook
pins, which was as follows: each put a pin itt the
end of his jacket and bent it like a fish hook, he
then hooked with his neighbor, and. the one who
pulled the other's pin out had it. Of course large
pins were in demand. My aunt had a quantity of
them, that she "set great store by," to use her
own expression, because they served her better
than the smaller ones in fixing a cloth round a
huge brick, which she warmed every night and
took to bed with her to keep her feet warm. Be-
sides, she would not let me have a single solitary
pin, because it was a bad play, for the boys tore
their jackets by it and wasted pins.
At first I slyly took the pins from the drawer
without saying by your leave, till she detected me
and kept the drawer locked. My stock of large
pins being exhausted, I had to practice a bit of
diplomacy - I asserted that my feet were cold too,
and insisted upon it that I must have a brick; ac-
cordingly, one was got ready for rue, and the large
pins were forthcoming. I occupied a small room
next to aunt Betsy's. The second night of my
feet warming, instead of sending the servant up
ftr the light when I had gotten in bed, she came
up herself to see that all was safe and tuck me in,
and caught me with the denuded brick in the
hearth and myself in the act of fixing a pin in my
jacket. My hypocrisy was thus discovered, and I
had a brick no more.
The boys at school had all envied me my big~
pins. 1 was now pushed to my wit's ends t~ ob

lain them, for I had driven with them many pro-
4
Iltable bargains in the apple and cake line.
The old lady, on the evening above mentioned,
had the cloth in which she wrapped her brick
under her on the seat of her chair, and sticking in
it were some half dozen of'these victorious pins.
How to obtain one or two was the question. I had
been looking out for an opportunityin vain. Strat-
agem was my only resource. Had she gone to
* the side board for the tea herself, I might have
effected my purpose. Just at this moment Mrs.
Boher, a Jewish lady who 'kept a boarding house
in our neighborhood, came in with several acquain-
tances. Now, thought 1, is my chance, the old'
lady will ~arise to receive them and I can fitch a

pretence or other, and disturbed me, proclaiming
that if she did so again I would throw the contents
of the tumbler over her. This was by way of
getting out of the scrape. One night I lay awake
for the coming of the old lady. She entered her
room where she left her candle to discover, by en-
tering mine in darkness, if there were sparks left
from the candle, whereby I had gone to bed three
hours before, and tuck mein. Through my opened
door the light from her room shone, so that I saw
her plain enough; and I am ashamed now, to say
that taking deliberate aim, I threw the tumbler of
water full upon her. She left my room after a
sudden interjection without saying a word, and I
thought she had retreated to bed, believing that I

pin. But she apologised for not rising, upon the took her 'for the servant. I instantly covered my
score of spilling the tea, but in fact to hide her head with the bed clothes to smother the sounds of

brick, cover, while she poked it under her and call-
ed the ladies round her' to examine the tea, in
praise of which she grew most, eloquent. Foiled
in this, I watched 'the Qpportunity while she was
folding the parcel, to slip from her lap the twine,
with which she was about tyingit. As she faced
'the ladies and they faced her, she could rise up
and look for the twine at her feet without exposing
to sight her burnt brick cover. She did so, When
I sent my fingers upon 'a forlorn hope, and snamchd
desperately at a shining pin head. I was too
hasty, for I jerked out before the whole company
the abominable burnt rags, which seemed glad to
get loose, for they flew all about the room. Drop-
ing her tea in 'a passionate. haste for vengeance,
Aunt Betsy flew at we and boxed me soundly.
I retreated under the 'table, but she made at ma
with the hearth brush, poked me out upon ull
fours, in which condition I hastily decamped from
the parlor, but not without receiving several blows,
without any power of playing th6 Parthian.
All this before company galled me 'exceedingly,,
and I determined to be avenged.
My aunt was in the habit of coming into my
room at night before retiring to her own, to see
that all was safe, and tuck me, as I have said,
which the servant always did two hours before. I
complained of being thirsty during the evening,
and had a tumbler of water placed by my bed
head. ' I moreover alleged that the servant came
into my room after' she put me to bed ander some

the laughter. which I could not suppress. All at
once the cover was jerked off of me and my laugh-
ter broke forth. My tune, however, was suddenly
changed, for the old lady fell foul of me in my cx
posed state, with an immense corset bone, from the
whacking application~ of which I had to take re-'
fuge under the bed. .1 'had no idea of leaving this
security as I did the table, but remained and begged
lustily for quarter, until she consented, upon my
often repeated parole of honor, that I should come
forth' without a renewal of hostilities and retire
peaceably to bed.

BOOTH-HiS AFFRAY WITH LUSBY.
CHAPTER IV.
The discipline of schools has changed wonder-
fully even in my short 'memory. In my boyhood
it was the fashion to use the rod, and no teacher
that I knew of was unfashionable. I was firs: sent
by my aunt to an old woman round the 'cprner,
named Grace, who taught a select number of en-
breeched boys and as many little girls; meaning
thereby as many as she could get. ' I recollect that

before my aunt sent mc to her school, she invited
the' school mistress to take tea with her, that
she might see in his intellectual dishabille her fu-
ture pupil. Mrs; Grace, a tall, spare old lady,
with a toothless upper jaw, came accordingly. My
aunt and she held a long discourse on the subject
of education, the most material point of which to
me was the averment on the part of Mrs. Grace
that she was opposed to much corporal punishment.
In speaking of the branches which she taught,
Mrs. Grace, in allusion to the unfortunate loss of
her upper teeth, said she did not pretend, in conse-
quence, to teaclfvprononcation.
While the old ladies were gossiping away in a
style which in their opinion would have enlight-
ened even my Lord Brougham upon the subject of
education, I contrived to secret Mrs. Grace's shawl
and spectacles under the sofa. When my future
schoolmistress arose to depart their mutual aston-
ishment at the d~sappearnuce of shawl and specta-
cles would have been edifying to a physiognomist,
i~nd instructive to an actress whose line was the
personation of old women.
"Could a thief have stepped in," asked the trem-
ulous Mrs. Grace, terrified at her loss.
"Do you believe in ghosts, marm," asked my
aunt.
Before either could answer the other, my aunt's
black servant girl Sally dropped on her knees by
the sofa and produced them, saying: "Mistus, I
"Saw," said Mrs. Grace.
"Any how, Mistus, Master Billy put 'em dar."
I darted an angry look at ~aIIy, the black girl,
while Mrs. Grace ~olemnly put on her spectacles;
threw back her head, and took a minute survey of
me.
I had not been at Mrs. Grace's more then a week
when the old lady put the fool's cap on me, because
I would not learn my a b's, and stood me up near
the door. 1 could have stood a florrging, hut I
could not stand the indignity, young as I was, so I
threw the fool's cap at the old lady's head, and
flung myself out of the room. I had 'to stand a
flogging too, for she sent her black girl' after me,
who soon over took me, and in spite of my scratch-
ing', kicking and yelling, bore me back to school,
where she held me while Mrs. Grace, before the

assembled urchins, inflicted summary punishment
on me.
I went home with my eyes all red; and in an-
swer to the inquiry of my respectable relative, I at
tribute all my grief to my coronation, and said I
did not care for the whipping. The 'old lady was
so indignant at my being thought a dunce, when
as ~he said she knew better, that she took me
away from school, by way, I suppose, of proving
her own wisdom, if not to make me wise.
At the invitation of Mr. Stetson, on ihe approach
of summer, Aunt Betsy rented her house until
fall, and took me into the country. After this, for
several years we spent the summers in the country
and the winters in the city.
When I grew large efiough I was sent to a
country school about three quarters of a mile off.
The pedagogue's name was Lusby. His scholars
ranged in years variously from twelve to twenty,
and were of both sexes, and he used the rod upon
all indiscriminately. The school house was a
rough frame building, erected by the subscription of
the neighbors. In' a log house beside it dwelt the
teacher. He was a fat, sensual bachelor, of most
ungovernable temper, when aroused, who avowed,
we to the unlucky urchin who~brought his toys or
marbles into the school. They were taken from
him, and he was whipped as soundly as ever he
whipped his top. Those who brought merely ap-
ples and cakes in their pockets fared better, though
not upon them, for if they escaped a whipping, a
returnless transfer of the eatables was forthwith
made to the desk of~ the master. Many were the
propitiatory offering 0f apples, peaches, pears, &amp;c.,
laid on the desk of Mr. Lusby.
"Ah! that's a fine apple," said he one morning to
Tommy Short, as Tommy took his seat after hav-
ing placed a glorious pippin in his sweaty palm,

in an insimmting tone, but with an eager eye glanc-
ing at his rod. Peter hesitated-.
"Tell me, Smith."
"He says, sir, you ~ so"-
"Spe&amp;kit out, sir"-.-exclaimed Lusby, rising in
wrath.
"So hogish, sit," said Smith, drawing a long
breath.
"Hog j~s, hey-.you bring me impertinent mes
sages; come here, sir."
'rhe trembling urchin obeyed, Lusby arose,
took the boy by the collar of his jacket and drew
him over the slanting leaf of his desk, then snatch-
ing down his rod, he applied it might and main to
the victim's back.
"Oh! Lord, sir, dear Mr. Lusby, I'll biing you
a hat full of them," screamed out Smith, as he
writhed beneath the infliction.
Whack, whack, whank.
"You're bribing me with forbidden fruit, are you,
sir. Never bring an apple here, sir.5~ Whack,
whack, whack. "There, sir, take your seat now
and consider this rod the flaming sword that keeps
you from the garden-that forbids you to either
touch or taste."
Poor Smith hurried to his seat, while the pe'da-
gogue cast a tyrannical eye round the school, like
a Sultan midst his slaves. Losby called his lodg-
ing place, ~his one roomed cabin, his office.
~ he exclaimed, "stop Smith, no rubbing
your back, sir. Get your dictionary-miss just one
word of it my boy, and I'll take you into my office
and increase the intimacy between your back and
my rod, sir-it shall be skin to skin. Martha
Jones, what are you looking at," exclaimed Lusby,
turning his eye on one of the girls, so named, in the
other end of the school room.
Martha was an~orphan child, whose mother had
died in the hospital a short time after her birth.
A blacksmith's wife, who was living in Baltimore,
had employed the mother, who gave her name as
Jones, until she found her ~eneiente. Not being
able to maintain her in the, cares and expense of
maternity, the blacksmith's wife, Mrs. Baltzell,
had had her taken to the hospital, and notwith-
standing her surmises against the poor girl's char-
acter, she could not resist the charitable impulse
which led her to visit the mother. Mrs. Baltzell

~OGRAPHY OF

happened to call at the hospital one day, and was
told that .Ml~s. Jones, (they called her so, because
she was a mother-"a mother but no wife,") was
dying. The good woman hastened to her bed aide.
As soon as the dying mother saw Mrs. Baltzell
her maternal feelings triumphed over the fears of
death, and she implored the good lady to take her
child. Mrs. Baltzell took the infant in her arms,
but said: "Tell me about yourself and its father."
"There, there, I know you'll be a mother to it,
I'm not what I seem to be-yes, yes, you shall
know all about its father. Holy father in heaven,"
she exclaimed, rising up, "sustain me;" but ex-
hausted nature yielded, she fell back speechless,
and lived for an hour afterwards, though she never
spoke more.
Mrs. Baltzell took the child, and a short time
afterwards her husband removed to Baltimore
County, and opened a smith's shop, about a mile
from the school house. Martha had reached the
age of twelve before it occurred to Mrs. Baltrell to
send her to school. When it did, she sent her to
an old woman, who taught a few children near by.
Within a few months she had been a pupil of Mr.
Lusby. He seemed to dislike her especially-I
cannot tell why or wherefore-perhaps because she
was his opposite, or may be because she was an
orphan, and comparatively friendless. There are
such natures. Martha was now nearly fourteen,
and a very pretty, amiable girl.
A youth named William Booth, of about eighteen
years of age,' and who lived with his widowed
mother near the blacksmith's, had, after refusing to
go to school at all, lately, of his own accord, become
one of Lusby's pupils. He was mi the habit of
attending Martha to school, and carrying for her
the little basket which contained her dinner. Booth
was rather short in statue, but well made and
active. He had small, regular features, and a pro-
~fusion of light hair, curling all over his head. He
was a skilful pugilist. Martha made no reply to
busby's inquiry, but turned trembling to her book.
"What were you doing, Martha,~~ he thundered
out again.
"Nothing, sir," said Martha, in a tone scarcely
audible, through fear.
"Nothing, sirha, there's a falsehood; you were
looking at Smith. I shall take you into my office

some of these days-bring me that rod"-and he
threw the berch, which he had been using on Smith,
at Martha. My seat was at the end of the boy's
bench, near the girls, and Booth's was next to
_ mine. I overheard him say to Martha, in a tone
which did not reach the ear of Lusby:
"Sit still-don't move.'~
"Ha! rebellion, hey," asked Lusby, as if glad of
an opportunity that furnished him an apology for
his favorite exercise. "Come, my lady, we won't
settle this matter before the young gentlemen-I'll
take the rod and you can take my arm, and we'll
step into my office."
As he spoke, with a gloating glance of sensual
cruelty, he stepped towards Martha. Booth arose
quickly, as if for some idle purpose or other, drew
back his fist, and almost before bushy saw him, he
planted a biow; with such scientific skill, between
the peepers of the pedagogue, that he fell over like
a log, and in his descent struck his head against a
corner of the desk, and rolled corpse-like on the
floor. Booth looked at him for a moment, as if
waiting for him to arise, but finding that he did
not, he handed to Martha her bonnet, took her
basket in one hand, and herself by the other, and
they left the school house.

CERY-THEY DRiNK TOGETHER-THEIR CON-
VERSAi~ION-THE SCHOOL HOUSE BUKNS DOWN
~ REMAiNS FOUND.
It was ten or fifteen minutes before busby re-
covered himself. The boys alternately gazed at
him and at each other, but not one spoke a word, I
nor made an effort to assist him. By slow degrees
he first rubbed his eyes, then felt his head, and at u
last raised himself up on his elbow. He looked e
round, and finding that Martha and Booth had left, r
he assumed a sitting posture on the floor, as if his
energies had not yet recovered from the effects of
the injury, though aroused to the impulses of de- '1
feat, mortification and shame.               n
After a mo~xly meditation in that posture, he
3

17

sullenly resumed his feet, and dismissed the school,
telling several of the boys, who were his tools, to.
remain.
In spite of all the entreaties of Booth's mother,
Lusby, with well drilled witnesses, ~Ipplied *for a
warrant against her son for the assault and battery,
and moreover, had him bound over to keep the
peace. Booth was known to be a reckless, uncon-
trolable youth) and he lay in jail some two weeks,
before, at the earnest solicitation of his mother,
any one could be gotten to go his security, when
two friends of her deceased husband took the re-
sponsibility, upon her mortgaging her little property
to them, which did not half cover the amount of
bail required.
When Booth' was bailed, he called on busby at
the school, and expressed great contrition for his
act, before the scholars, evidently to the surprise
of those boys who were old enough to reflect, for
they did not believe that he could feel it. He
furthermore asserted that he had exerted his influ-
ence with Martha Jones and Mrs. Baltzell, to in-
duce the former to return again. Booth and busby
held a~conversation upon the subject, and it was
evidently Booth's object to have the matter termi-
nate with his apology. To this Lusby would not
consent, but said, he felt that for the dignity of his
vocation, as well as an example, putting his own
personal feelings out of the question, the press
should make know the circumstances of the case.
Booth, at this, broke out into a passion, and said
Lh t if it were not for the sake of his securities he
would pummel the pedagogue to death. At this,
Lusby, in evident fear, cooled off apparently, and
hey patched up peace between them, though Lus-
~y, we all observed, kept the ~chool in later than
isual. Booth still, however, continued the con-
Tersation, and when we were dismissed, remained
vith him.
That night they were seen together at a grocery
in the road, ~inking, and the school-master was
evidently intoxicated. The bar keeper afterwards
reported the following as the conversation between
hem.
"Well," said Booth to Lusby, after they had
sore than once replenished their cups, "you agree
ow to forget and forgive."
"I must think of that, Master Booth. Person'

~lly, as I have said, when you called on me in my
academy, I do, but I think that the dignity of my
office requires some legal measures. Master Booth,
it was an outrageous procedure. Miss Jones de-
served punishment; that, by the bye, I suppose you
admit."
"That, by the bye, I don't admit," replied
Booth.
"Then, sir, there is an end to our colloquy; for,
sir, to say that she did not deserve punishment is
as much as to say that I was wrong and you were
right."
"What's that to do with it. I have told you
was sorry-let that end it."
"By no means, Master Booth, that begins it
again. The vast difference in our years, the dig-
nity of my station. my own personal dignity"-
"Personal dignity," exclaimed Booth, in whom
their potations had drowned the caution in which
he had carried himself, "why, man, you're drunk
now."
"Drunk now," retorted Lusby, 'sir, our cob-
quy has ended, and I regret that I ever suffered it
to commence."
"You be hanged. I tell you what it is, old
fellow, I'll make it known, for the sake of your
personal dignity, as you call it, that you are corned
now, and its my opinion that you come it pretty
often."
At this hard thirst, Mr. Lusby turned away
from Booth, and addressed himself to the barkeeper,
as if it was beneath him to recognize the presence
of his insulter. After walking two or three times
up and down the bar room, Booth faced Lusby and
observed:
"Would'nt you like to have your will of me?
0! Lordy, how you would handle the nw hide,
would'rit you? I suppose you think you could
make me holler."
"I think I could, sir," said Lusby, who could
not resist making the remark.
"You did'nt 'holler, though, when I floored you,
did you."
Again Lusby addressed the bar-keeper. Booth
again walked about, every now and then eyeing
his opponent with a fixed gaze. At last he stepped
up to him and said:
"You can handle the rod first rate, I admit. You

[OGRAPHY OF
ought to hire out as overseer for old R-, and
then you would have your hands full. But no, I
suppose you prefer having a boy or a delicate girl,
that's it-a delicate girl-don't you now-say,
don't you?"
Lusby made no reply, and after another pause,
Booth said:
"Come, old fellow, say something, or treat."
No reply being made, he continued:
"Well, I'll stand treat myself. It can't hurt
your dignity to tell you you're drunk, when I am
drunk myself, and got drunk 'with you. Come,
now, it shows malice-and I want to part friends
with you. You don't think that I'd report such a
thing of you, do you?"
"I don't know what you may or will report,
~ said Lusby, who did not seem to relish the
execution of the threat, "I bear you no malice, sir."
"Well, then, will you drink with me?"
"I thank. you, sir-no more for me."
"Come, Mr. Lusby, it will be unkind if you do
not. I respect you, sir, by earth I do, and we'll
have a parting glass, at any rate. You may ap-
pear against me or not-it can't ruin me anyhow,
and if it does ruin the old woman, let the sin be
yours.~~
"Let's drop the subject, Master Booth," said
Lusby, rising, "but, sir, to show you that I bear
no enmity, I'll drink with you."
Again they drank together, after which, Booth
said he must be off, and shaking Lusby by the hand
cordially, he departed. Lusby~s house was about
a mile through the fields from the grocery, which
he left with a staggering step an hour afterwards.
tn the midnight, the neighborhood was startled
by a fire in the direction of the school-house. The
people rushed to the spot, and found it and the ad-
joining cabin in flames, and so far consumed as to
make an attempt at an entrance extremely hazard-
ous. In fact, the dwelling of Lusby was the most
burnt. The conjecture was, that the fire was the
work of an incendiary, and the inquiry ran round
for the s~hoolmaster. He was not to be found.
The lookers on, for they were all such, as they had
no engines with which to work, and there was
nothing of value that they could save, now gath
ered closer to the flames and cinders, and attempted
to pry through them, but in vain.

As the dying conflagration flickered across the
solemn shades of night, some mounted their
horses, on which they had galloped to the place,
and took their way home; ~while others, in scat-
tered groups, discussed the cause of the fire and
the probable fate of the master, and lingered about
till day break. In the morning nothing but a
smouldering mass of ashes was perceptible on the
spot where the school-house had stood. On raking
in their midst, the bones of Lushy were found.
There was much wonder at first why thesehool-
master did not make his escape, but it died away
when the bar-keeper stated that Lusby was intoxi-
cated that nbrht, which fact was corroborated by
Booth. The schoolmaster's last night furnished
the bar-keeper with a fund of gossip, and he often
recounted the scene as I have recorded it.
CHAPTER VI.
MY A UNT ~s GRIEF FOR THE DEATH OF LUSEY-
I AM SENT TO A NEW SCHOOL-CHARACTER
OF THE CELEBRATED) JOSEPH LANCASTER-
MY FIRST LOVE-A CHILDREN'S PARTY AT MRS.
RECITATiON- MY TRI-
UMPH OVER HIM.
My good relative mourned much more for the loss
'of the school house than for the pedagogue-tern.
ble as his death must have been. She reflected
that if the school house still stood, that another
teacher could soon be found, but the school house!
who would rebuild that. To be sure, it would not
cost a great deal, but the parents of Lusby's
scholars were generally poor, and there was no one
to step forward, (as there doubtless would have
been had the conflagration occurred in Yankee
land,) and rebuild the house, or at least raise a
subscription among the neighbors, and have it done
in that way.
As Lusby had flattered my aunt's pride that I
was a bright boy, she determined that I should not
be idle. The question was, how could she pre-
serve her health, and send nie to school in the city,
where, during the summer, she was not in the
habit of residing. She resolved to board me with
her old friend, Mrs. Clayton. Accordingly, a~er
many interviews ~nd negotiations between the two,

I was packed off to Mrs. Clayton. Perhaps I
should speak more in accordance with my relatives'
kindness to me, to say, that with every care she
herself took me to Mrs. Clayton's; and there sent
for Joseph Lancaster, the celebrated founder of the
Lancasterian system of education, under whose tui-
tion she designed to place me. Lancaster, under,
I believe, reverses of fortune, had left England
and at the time I speak of had located in Baltimore.
Well do I remember his pompous appearance be-
fore my aunt, in a suit of drab, of the quaker cut,
as prinky and particular in its adjustment as that of
any Broadway or Chesnut street dandy whatever.
"I~'riend Hugerson,~~ was his salutation to my
aunt, "when I give thee my hand I give thee my
heart also."
Learnedly, as my aunt thought, the old peda-
gogue went into an exposition of his plan of educa-
tion, while he puffed and blew like a locomotive,
only his respirations were at longer intervals.
To Lancaster I went. I have forgotten all he
ever attempted to learn me, but I have not forgotten
the fact, that, young as I was, I soon learned to
consider him a humbug. The old fellow was al-
ways cramming himself, not with readingorscience,
but with the nicest kind of sponge cakes, as puffy
as himself. Lie was sparse of any distribution of
these creature~omforts among the boys, but I have
always thought he delighted to see our mouths
water as he stowed away quantities of the cakes
aforesaid. These sponge cakes were his standard
refreshment, but he not infrequently slipped down
to the confectioner's and regaled himself with
other dainties, with divers and sundry glasses of
wine to boot.
Ah! my firatdream of love was learned, it not at
his~school, nor after the Lancasterian or any other
system, it was certainly in the natural way. After
the conflagration of Lusby's, I missed much Martha
Jones in our new school, for I had always a boyish
penchant for her, and had ever done my boyish best
to please her, not without effect. For when aunt
sent for m~ to spend the holiday of Saturda~f and
Sunday in the country, Martha, young as she waa,
would frequently come over from Mrs. Baltzell's to
see me, and the folks used to call her my sweet
heart. But I heard an old family female slave say,
"that it would not do no how-thQugh it was a


20

pity there was such a dIfference in our stations,"
(Martha's and mine.)
I did not know what~ she meant then by the
remark, though I have learned since.
Not far from Lancaster's school, Mrs. Grace
kept hers, and it was in full operation. Among
her scholars was a beautiful little girl, named Alice
Clare. Her parents were very rich, and Alice
was the admiration of all the boys at Lancaster's,
and not the less of mine. Lancaster in the morn-
ing of Saturday,,(for in the afternoon we had holi-
day) taught elocution, or rather listened to our re-
citations, for though he sometimes gave us a pre-
cept or two, he never illustrated them by practice.
I had a natural turn for speaking, as Lusby used
to say, and I generally headed my class in elocu-
tion, when the lines
"You'll scarce expect one of my age,"
were certainly recited either by one 0" the small-
est boys in downright earnest, or by one of the
largest and most lubberly ones in sport. I always
made earnest of my recitations, and was fond of a
pathetic effusion, such as the "Exile of Erin," or
a love matter, like "Byron's Dream," (I thought
myself prodigious at this, or something from Shak-
speare; Mark Antony~s oration, for instance, over
Caesar, or Cassius to Brutus.) I never once at-
tempted the comic, except Captain Bobadil's kill-
ing off an army by computation, in Ben Jonson's
"Every man in his humor."
At a rival academy (Brown's,) a boy three or
four yeare older than myself had won the prize in
elocution; and young Mr. Peterson was proud in-
deed of the award. I used to observe him with no
little curiosity after I had heard of his success, and
the more so, when I heard the girls talk about, and
certain ones boast of him as their beau. My anx-
iety to hear him was intense. He was great in I
"Hohenlinden" it was observed; and some of the
girls declared that they could almost see
"-the brave,
Who rush to glory or the grave,"
"rushing," when he recited the lines.
At a girl's party in the neighborhood, Alice
Clare had heard Peterson recite, and she was loud
in his praise. The girls at Lancaster's, however,
feeling a pride in their school, proclaimed my

merits, and said that they believed I could beat
him. In the midst of these earnest and emulous
differences of opinion, quite as grave as differences
upon graver matters, Alice Clare gave a party, to
which both Peterson and myself were invited,
Naturally of a sensitive nature, I felt more sensi-
tive than ever, as I eyed the manlier proportions of
Master Peterson, and observed how he lionized it
among the fair. He had his collar turned over,
quite in the Byronic way, and he wore a watch, a
point of manly extravagance to which I was scarce-
ly approximating. IMoreover, the whole appoint-
ments of his toilet surpassed, not only mine, but
those of every other boy in the room. His parents
were rich, and very indulgent to him. Why, his
every day clothes are as good as my Sunday
clothes, I thought to myself, and surely the girls
admire him very much, but I should like to hear
his "Hohenlinden."
I had an instinct that I could heat him. Be that
as it might, my curiosity to hear him was in-
tense. I was seated in the corner by Alice Clare,
our little hostess, and I remember now her dancing,
black eye, arid the abundant display of raven curls,
which floated over her neck and shoulders, and
over the little edging of her frock in front, where
L..ove's pillows
"were but scarcely spied,
For yet their places were but signified."
I remember it all well-and how pleasantly she
chatted with me, and kept calling me "Willy" Rus-
sell, while she always spoke of the distinguished
elocutionist of Brown's as "Mr." Peterson. I was
not old enough to know then, that "Willy Rus-
sell," the way she pronounced it, had much more
in it than "Mr. Peterson." I only thought that old
Lancaster gave no prizes for elocution, and that
Brown did, and Peterson had won the prize, and
all the girls were admiring him. I glanced at
Alice's glowing Gheek, and felt a strange, wild
envy and emulation seize me. Hear him I must.
Alice and I sat in the corner.
"Do, Miss Alice, ask Mr. Peterson to recite," I
said.
"0! yes,~~ rejoined Alice, clapping her hands,
"and, Willy Russell, you must recite too."
I remarked 'with some hauteur, "I never won a
prize for elocution."

"But that old mean thing, Lancaster, don't give
prizes at your school, Willy Russell, and if he
did, somehow I think you might win it. I never
heard you, but your school girls have, and I heard
Martha Jones, when I was out to Mrs. Stetson's,
ask you to repeat some poetry to her, and she says
you can do it so well."
"Mr. Peterson," she called out that individual,
"do recite for us."
But Mr. Peterson, a spoilt pet, required as
much persuasion to get him on the floor as it would
to have seated at the piano some celebrated song-
stress. At last the honored winner of the prize
took the floor, but without the least show of diffi-
dence. He adjusted his Byronic collar, and dain-
tily asked what Miss Alice Clare's commands
were.
"Do recite Hohenlinden," was the cry from all
parts of the room.
Mr. Peterson averred that Hohenlinden was not,
by any means, his crack piece-but it was imma-
terial to him, any thing to please the ladies, and
particularly Miss Alice Clare.
Though I was rather a precocious chap myself,
the coolness and the style of Mr. Peterson aston-
ished me. I thought his manner to the young la-
dies, (ladies was the word that pressed itself upon
my brain, and not girls,) was inimitable. If,
thought I to myself, he recites as well as he said
that, he deserved the prize, and my heart swelled
as truth extorted the remark from envy.
And Mr. Peterson did recite, and well. There
was evidently too much study in his recitations,
but there was evident also a great deal of taste.
Bowing with the easy courtesy of some histrionic
"particular star," who has been so long the light
of the theatrical world, that men have become, as it
were, astronomers of his fame, and he himself used
to the thing - Mr. Peterson resumed his seat
and his conversation with the young lady beside
him at the same instant, as if he had been doing
nothing but holding a quiet chat with her the whole
evening. Again his coolness and manner provoked
while it struck me, and I believe 1 envied him his
nonchakrnt address, which was cotifoundedly taking
after all, more than his powers of recitation.
"Now, Willy Russell," said Alice in an under
tone to rue, "yot~ must recite. Ladies and gentle-

21

nen," continued Mass Alice, with~quite a womanly
;elf-possession, (these things are catching,) "now
~dr. Russell will recite. Please, Mr. Russell, to
recite the "Exile of Erin."
I, however, could not catch Mr. Peterson's
xiolness, for I shook all over. I glanced at Alice,
her encouraging look nerved me, and I proceeded.
I remember when I recited the verse:
"Where is my cabin door fast by the wild wood,
Sisters and sire did ye weep for its fall?
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood,
~5nd where is the bosom friend dearer than all?"
that I gave particular emphasis to the last line,
looking with might and main at Alice, and doing
my best to make actions speak even louder than
words. Alice blushed crimson at this, and when
I had concluded, Mr; Peterson declared, with an
air of some pique, that I had made quite a declar-
ation, as well as declamation.
"I vow, Mr. Peterson," she said hastily, "VViI-
ly Russell can beat you after all."
Mr. Peterson's particular coolness forsook him at
this remark, and he said hastily and abruptly,
there was no accounting for taste. Dc gustibus,
&amp;c., and he quoted Latin, while I became in man-
ner, at least, particularly cool, though my heart
throbbed wildly at the praise of Alice. And I be-
gan to feel, boy as I was, whenever Alice looked
kindly on any other youth in the room, what the
poet has since most beautifully illustrated:
"The moon looks
On many brooks-
The brook can see no moon but one."

OF MY AUNT-i PRRVAiL-PEACE PROCLAIMED.
There was quite a rebellion in Mrs. Clayton's
household in the morning after Alice Clare's party,
at least on the part of one person. 1 made my ap-
pearance at breakfast with the clothes which I had
worn to the party, my best clothcs,(my Sunday-go-to
meeting clothes.) to wear to school-a thing never
tolerated, unless. my every day clothes were torn
and were being mended. Mrs. Clayton looked at

we with much surprise, and asked me why I did
not wear ray school clothes?
"Because they are not fit to wear," I replied.
"Not fit to wear! are they torn, child? Gracious,
I only mended them yesterday."
That "child" I did'nt like, so I replied as much
like a man as I could.
"I don't know whether they are torn or not, but
I won't wear them any more."
"Not wear them any more," screamed the old
lady, "why your dear aunt left express orders that
you should never wear your Sunday clothes except
on the blessed Sabbath, or on extra occasions, such
as last night-this is her return for sending them
into town. to you."
I disdained a reply. I had been awake half the
night, thinking over the party, what Alice had
said about my beating Peterson, and particularly
about that gentleman~s superior wardrobe appoint-
ments, watch, &amp;c., and I felt that I must do justice
to myself and dress better thereafter.
The old lady saw my stubbornness, but she was
stubborn too, or rather, as she said, she was deter-
mined to fulfill her dear friend Miss Ilugerson's
desires to the very letter. Accordingly, I was trapp-
ed, unawares, by herself and black girl, and in spite
of all my efforts at kicking and scratching, I was
carried screaming with passion to my room, and
locked in. Notwithstanding portentous struggles
on my part, against the combined forces of Mrs.
Cla~rton and her black ally, I was stripped of my
Sunday suit, the suit in which I had excelled
Mr. Peterson, and I was peremptorily told by Mrs.
Clayton, as she deposited my every day clothes
beside my bed, into which she had thrust me, that
until I put them on, she could not think of permitt-
ing me to leave the room and go to school. Saying
this she left the room, carefully locking the door
after her.
At first, from exhaustion, surprise, and indigna-
tion, I was silent for some moments after the old
lady left me, or my silence was only broken by
sobs. But my wrath was soon aroused into activi-
ty. I stamped and raved about the room; I jerked
at the knob of the door, and dashed myself against
its panels in a furious but impotent outbreak of

the key hole and distinctly informed me, through
it, that she would send for the constable if I made
any more noise, that the people had collected out
in the street, and that I should not have a mouth-
ful until I behaved myself and put on my clothes.
I looked out of the window and saw several per.
sons looking up at it, and while I was wondering
what&amp; I should do, one of my schoolmates, who
was in the habit of calling occasionally for me,
made his appearance at the door below, with a
bunch of flowers in his hand. My first impulse
was hurniediy to dress myself and go wit to meet
hini-but no, the idea of giving up to Mrs. Clayton
could not be borne. So I stole away from the
window, bun presently hearing the frontdoor open,
I crept to it again and looked forth. I beheld Mrs.
Clayton and my comrade talking together, and I
saw him offer her the bunch of flowers, which she
seemed to refuse, and at the same time pointed to
my window. In my eagerness to see what was
going on, for I could not hear, I had exposed my-
self to the observation of the old lady. My school-
mate burst into a laugh and called out loud enough
for me to hear:
"Bill, come down, old fellow-here's some flow-
ers Alice sent you.~~
"Put on your clothes, as I bid you," screamed
out Mrs. Clayton, "and come to your breakfast."
At this moment Alice Clare passed by, on the
other side of the street, and I heard Mrs. Clayton
call her over. I heard no more. In an utter
I
agony of shame and rage I threw myself on the ~
bed. I believe I would willingly have set the ~.
house on fire and perished in it, rather than the
old lady should expose the cause of my rebellion, I
and dwell upon my denuded state, locked up as I
was in my room, to Alice. I really felt like dash-
ing my brains out against the wall. I thought ~
that when Alice left, I would actually pitch my-
self out of the window, in revenge upon every
body about me. Strange-but wildly flitted
through my mind Booth's revenge on Lusby,
and for the first time, [wondered if Booth could
have set fire to the school house and burnt the old
rascal up? And then I wondered if he loved
Martha Jones as much as I loved Alice Clare, and

passion. The door gave not way, nor would Mrs. ~then I began to reflect that I loved Martha Jones
Clayton give up, for she made her appearance at too, and that if Alice Clare should laugh at rue

Martha Jones would not, as she had always taken
my part.
In the hurly-burly of such thoughts I fell a-
sleep. I knew ~ot how long I had slept when I
was aroused by Mrs. Clayton, who had entered
the room without awaking mc. She told me I
had better get up and have something to eat. I
turned away from her without saying a word. She
then began to remonstrate with me and said I would
make myself sick. I only reflected that Alice
knew all about my trouble, that the boys at school
would laugh at me. I told Mrs. Clayton that I
wouldn't wear my Sunday clothes, if she were to
bring them to me, that I wanted to be sent home
to my aunt. At this the old lady seemed non-
plussed. She now began to coax. But this only
made me more stubborn, like the "rude boy up the
apple tree," when the farmer expostulated with
him. At last the old lady left the room, and the
door unlocked behind her, but that did no good. I
felt my advantage. She even brought me, towards
evening, something to eat, but I stubbornly re-
fused it. She then brought me ipy Sunday clothes,
averring that she could do nothing with me, and
told me to put them on and do what I pleased.
But I threw them from the bed on which she had
placed them. The old lady left the room at this
in a quandary. I glanced at the plate of fo6d which
she had left behind her, and notwithstanding I was
very hungry, I would not touch it. I looked at
my Sunday clothes and thought I would put them
on and go and see Alice, and that would show her
at least I had triumphed over the old hag, for in
such colors my indignation painted Mrs. Clayton,
but then I reflected, Alice and the boys will laugh
at me, notwithstanding, and maybe nickname mc
"Sunday clothes!" 0! thought I, if I were only
out an the country at Mr. Stetson's. 1 never want
to see town again.
I was oppressed with such reflections and over-
whelrned with the ridiculous point of view in which
Mrs. Clayton had doubtless placed me in the eyes
of my schoolmate and Alice, when Mrs. Clayton
entered my room, followed by my aunt. I was
unconscious that hours had passed, and in the
meantime Mrs. Clayton had sent for my aunt.
Both the old ladies viewed and reviewed me,
through their spectacles, as I lay doggedly in bed.

My rebellion was a grave matter to arise from such
a little matter as the wearing of a certain enit. But
my ambition had been awakened, and there was
something deeper in it than dandyistri. I have
often thought since that it was a trait of character,
which, at first blush, would seem born of the bio-
graphy of beau Brummel.
"My poor boy, what has come over you,~~ said
my good aunt, in a kind tone. "Mrs. Clam rode
out to Mr. Stetson's and gave such pleasing ac-
counts of you; she said you recited better than Mr.
Brown's scholar, who got the prize. And what
gratified me more, she said you were the mast
gentlemanly lad at the party."
"Yes, but," I exclaimed, utterly subdued by my
aunt's kindness, "Mrs. Clayton has gone and told
Alice and Jim Johnson that she had locked me
up like a baby, because I wouldn't wear my old
clothes."
"I never said such a word, Miss Huge~son,~~ ex-
claimed Mrs. Clayton, "Alice, that beautiful little
girl, had sent him a bouquet, and all I said was that
Willy was in his room, and hadn't been to break-
fast yet."
"Then i'll wear my old clothes and be hanged
to them, aunt," I exclaimed, as I stretched out my
hand to take them, "but I don't see why, if I can
beat Mr. Peterson, emphasisingg the Mr.) he
should wear better clothes than I ~
"Well, Willy,~~ rejoined my aunt, "in consid-
eration that you behaved so well at the party and
did surpass Mr. Brown's scholar, (my aunt never
liked Brown, he had corrected her pronunciation
once,) you shall wear your Sunday suit daily--but
you ought to have minded Mrs. Clayton."
"I didn't mean to make Mrs. Clayton angry,
aunt," said 1, "she has always been good to me,"
and I suspect that the fear Mrs. Clayton might
tell Alice of the cause of my rebellion induced me
to make thus much of an apology, rather than the
fact that she had "always been good to me." But
it will not do to analyze the motives too closely
even of a boy.
It was now nearly dark, and for the nonce I
dressed myself in my old clothes, and went down
stairs to take tea with the two old ladies, who, I
believe, both looked on rae with admiring eyes.
I consumed a considerable quantity of tea, toast

and cold ham that night. While the old ladies ges
siped away the hour, I laid myself at full length
on the sofa and pursued a train of reflections, cloud:
and bright by turns, but the bright predominated
How much my passions expanded my mind in tha
little hour! I began to think it was not very manl~
to make such a fuss about what clothes I wore, at
I had often heard that many men who had become
great or rich, had often been very poor boys. Thea
the magnificently dressed Mr. Peterson and hit
watch, and his address, and his coolness, came be-
tween me and a reconciliation '~'to~my old suit. I
remembered hearing Mr. Stetson tell a story of a
veteran of the revolution, who, when General
Wilkinson had issued anorder that queues should
be abolished in the army, refused to comply and was
court mar~ialed for it. I did not understand what
court martial meant, but I understood the gist of it
was, that the old officer continued to wear his
queue, 42~eneral Wilkinson to the contrary, notwith-
standing. Moreover, the officer had carried the
matter of his personal rights so far that on his
death bed he made a friend promise him that a hole
should be bored in the head of his coffin, and the
obnoxious queue should make its appearance there-
from unshorn from his head~, or its honors, and
newly dressed. Accordingly, it did appear, and
the commanding general, who attended the funeral,
as in etiquette he was bound, was not a little of-
fended to see the pugnacious article in question,
like a martinet doing duty by its master, and emu-~
lating Napoleon's guards, who refused to surren-
der. Now, I said to myself, I always thought
queues were ugly, and there are only one or two old
men in the whole city that wear them; and if a
brave soldier of the revolution ~vas determined to
wear his queue, I do not see why I may not deter-
mine to wear my best clothes.
It seems that this old soldier, emulating in his
maintenance of his personal rights Shakspeare's
hero, in making a ~~bargain,~~ was determined to
"cavil for the tythe part of an hair," and 1 suppose
I mu~t have felt in his example a l)rccedent which
upheld me, in my own opinion, at least, in "high-
er matter," as Burke would say

I APPEAR IN THE POLICE REPORTS.
If, unlike him of the ballad, I did not arise a
"sadder" boy on the morrow, I certainly arose a
"wiser" one, and I thought, as I glanced at my
reflection in the glass, after I had equipped myself
in my best suit, a much better looking one than I
should have been in my old and discarded suit-
"For the apparel oft proclaims the man,"
said the wise Polonius to his son in that best of
passages of advisement, to a youth, extant. Un-
consciously caught by the quick suseptibilities of
Love, quickened by 'Envy, I had adopted and
acted upon it, thinking, foolishly, when my pas-
sion, (against Mrs. Clayton, I mean,) had passed,
that I had done something I should have been
ashamed of, when in fact I had acted wisely. Old
ladies, (unmarried, and who consequently have ro
grandchildren that they can be proud of,) masters
who furnish their apprentices clothing as well as
food, and very economical timthers, might have some
thing ~o say upon this subject, and quote Solomon
upon 'vanity,' and 'sparing the rod and spoiling the
child,'hut that would prove no more in my case than
would the quotation to them from Shaksp~mare, about
the "devil quoting scripture for his purpose," prove
in theirs. I have a tale to tell, not as "'twas told
to me," but as I acted and felt it, and I shall often
leave the reader to his own reflections, without ob -
truding mine. Funnily, through my boyish brain,

ment of the devil's toilet, on the occasion of his

offence and my aunt's forgiveness, as I made my
appearance before her and requested a note of ex-
cuse to "old ~anky~~ for my absence. Now my
aunt never had had to write me a note of excuse
before, as Lusby, my country schoolmaster, never
required one, and Mr. Lancaster had never asked
me for one, though his rules demanded it, and I had
frequently transgressed them in this particular as
well as others.
"Willy, I don't know what to say," replied my
aunt, to my request.
"I'll tell you aunt," I rejoined, for I had seen
many of the excuses of the boys, and I proceeded
to dictate to my respectable relative:
"Mr. Lancaster will please excuse my nephew
for his unavoidable absence.
ELIZAnETII HUGERSON."
"Unavoidable?" queried my aunt, in a conscien-
tious tone, though she seemed to admire my rapid
dictation.
"Unavoidable?" echoed Mrs. Clayton, asif her
moral sense was startled.
"Yes, that's the very ord," said I, "I've seen
it in other boy's excuses."
"But it was not unavoidable," exclaimed Mrs.
Clayton.
"Necessary absence ~ said I.
"But it wasn't necessary," said Mrs. Clayton.
"Well, I don't want to have another foss,"
said I, "so just put absence."
Mrs. Clayton glanced at my aunt, who said'
nothing, but wrote the note accordingly.
With much elasticity of movement and spright-
liness of step and spirit, I took my aunt's note, and~
put it in my jacket pocket, which I got my aunt
carefully to pin, with the pin through the note,
that I might make it as secure as possible. I
then stole into Mrs. Clayton's bed-room, which
contained a larger glass than did mine~, and took a
minute and admiring survey of myselL I felt ora-
torical-declamatory. I was in the act of declaim-
ing my favorite passage from Byron's dream:
"As the sweet moon onthe horizon's verge,
The maid was on the eve of womanhood;"
determining, in my own mind, that the next time
Alice asked me to recite I would select the dream
and look at her when I declaimed that passage,
Just as I looked at her so effectually in the line

from the "Exile of Erin" at her party.-when lo!
the two old ladies entered and caught me in the
act. Didn't I slip sheepishly out of the room? I
paused on the steps and heard Mrs. Clayton say,
tt was wrong to cultivate vanity in a child. But I
darted off, re-assured, when I heard my aunt
reply
"It is indeed wrong to cultivate vanity in a child;
I am, therefore, glad that my nephew was only
cultivating a talent for oratory, for which every
body says he has wonderful gifts-indeed, I think
he'll turn out something extraordinary.~~
Full of the conviction that I should turn out
something extraordinary, I resolved to turn into
the street where Mrs. Grace kept her school, in
the hope of seeing Alice and being seen by her.
Mrs. Grace, in teaching others, had taught hefacif,
and had arrived to the dignity of an older grade of
pupils than when I formed one of them. lint find-
ing that this older grade, particularly those of the
masculine gender, were harder to manage than the
dunaller, she had resolved to have no more boys3
but open an academy "exclusively for young la-
dies," as the gilt sign over her door way official-
ly announced. Alice Glare had become one ot
bet pupils under this new arrangement. Alice had
expressed her indignation, as I had heard from a
playmate, when she was told that in days gone by,
Mrs. Grace had put a fool's cap on me, and after-
wards whipped me before the whole school for
throwing it indignantly, in her face and running
away.
Mrs. Grace's school was kept in a small house
situated on the corner of an alley. The school
room was on the first floor, and a low window
opened from it into the alley, into which I buoy-
antly entered, and seeing Alice Glare in the school
room, an not seeing Mrs~ Grace, I took off my
hat and made her my best bow with my best
beaver. She was looking out of the window at
the time, and involuntary exclaimed, when she
saw me:
"Why, Willy!"
This attracted the attention of' the young Misses
about her, and a buzz ran round the room. Mrs.
Grace, it dppears. was up stairs in her chamber, so
situated at the head of the stairs that she could
comn~an(l a vieW of the school-room. Hearing the

buzz, the old lady reconnoitered the school.roon
Seeing the eyes of 'her pupils directed to the alle
window, she naturally stepped to her window jum
over it, and reconnoitered the premises within'
She behold me infringing all her rules of propriety
and decorum in making my third most decorous
mind profound bow to the young ladies within.
Mrs. Grace instantly resolved to put a stop
my bowing, as they put out fires, and sometime
put down mobs and other projects, and sometime
don't, by throwing cold water on them. No soon
er resolved than done. As I raised my head fron
my fourth most profound bow, it was arrested ii
its upward tendency, and suddenly thrown down
wards with a jerk and shake, by a shower of dirtl
water from a basin in the hands of Mrs. Grace
who was acting with malice aforethought evidently
for as I looked up naturally and impulsively to se
what was the matter, jumping back at the saint
instant, I received another shower full in my fac
and eyes. I had opened my mouth involuntarily
and that came in for more than its full share. Foi
a moment the water, to say nothing 'of the shoch
to my sensibilities and nerves, made me speechless,
when a burst of laughter from the whole school
stung ~ne to the qui&amp;k. I retreated beyond the
reach of at least another shower from my Xantippe,
and shook my fist at her in a rage, and called her
certain names, with bad words appended to them,
which I need not repeat.
She told me that I was born for the gallows, and
that if I did not instantly leave she would send
her black girl (my old arrester when I ran away
from my coronation) after me, and whip me before
the whole "academy." What a threat!-to be
unbreeched before a whole "academy exclusively
for young ladies," and Alice iii their midst. I de-
fied her. I could not do less, and my wrath rose
into manly imprecations.
"Oh! Willy Russell, don't go on so-do go to
school," said Alice to me.
"Alice, I will, for you," I said, and just as [turn-
ed to leave the alley, the black imp of Mrs. Grace
darted thrciugh the back door at me. Horror, fear,
~nd indignation had me at once, and the black
ttirl too had me at an advantage. I turned and
ran to save my 'honor-if nothing else-tiH in say-

. ing my back I saved certainly my honor itt the
y premises, because, according to Hudibras.
"A wourid in that place more

Y "Run, Willy," irtvoluntarily exclaimed Alice
5 Glare.
I did run. Being rather scant in the skirt~,
o upon economical principles, the locomotion of the
s black girl was somewhat impeded, and at first I
5 gained ground upon her. But she raised the cry
- of stop thief after me, and a large man at the mouth
ri of the alley seized me.
"Let me go," I exclaimed, frantic with fright
- ~and passion.
"Bring him in,~' exclaimed Mrs. Grace, "if you
please."
I was accordingly forcibly taken by the collar
by the individual addressed, and hauled into the
presence of Mrs. Grace. My delinquency was
stated by the lady to my captor, and she asserted,
and was borne out in the assertion, that I had
made "indecent mouths" at the young ladies, by
several of them. Alice Clare had the courage to
say that I was only bowing t', her.
Mrs. Grace said that I should apologise, or be
whipped before the whole academy.
The black girl said:
"Missus, he ought to do bofth. I can hold him
spite of his kicking-I has held him 'afore."
"She has no right, I don't belong to her school,"
I exclaimed to the man, "take me to Mr. Lancas-
ter's, where I belong, or to my aunt." I could
have stood a thousand whippings, but not before
the girls.
"Mr. Gunter, Willy was only bowing to me,"
said Alice Clare, who, it seems, knew the man,
who had lately become her father's gardener, "take
him home," and she burst into tears.
"Silence, Miss Glare," exclaimed ~rs. Grace~
Gunter asked me what I had done. I told him
that I had only bowed to Alice. He decided that I
should be taken to my aunt, and Mrs. Grace hur-
riedly equipped herself and accompanied us, fol-
lowed by the black girl.
I shall never forget the look of my aunt and
Mrs. Clayton when Mrs. Grace told how I had in-
merrupted her school, made indecent mouths at the
girls, and how she had to throw water on me to

when she was faltering in her task, and such
smile of encouragement, and so many words
praise! Jane was about sixteen, quiet and sh
with deep blue eyes, and she was graceful at
womanly even at that age. I delighted to talk
her about Hanson. And when I would tell h
what he said of her, the delicate rose-tint won

since, in looking at life, have seen this, as doubi
less you have.
Jane knew that her parents would object to he
marriage with Hanson, but she loved him, neve
theless, and it tore her very heart strings to giv
him up. She grew thin, and that pallor about th
temples which so strongly denotes mental suffering1
marked hers.
I did not think that Hanson loved her over-much
It was said that he was engaged. to a lady in Bos
ton, and the day at last arrived' when he was ti
leave for that plase. He had never said that h
was to be married, but always after a fashion de
nied it.
He was popular with the scholars, and many or
both sexes, from both schools, had agreed to mccl
him in our school rcoin to say good bye Of course
Alice, Jane, and myself were of the number. We
had a nice little collation spread, and there was a
great deal of fun and gayety among us, but,
Jane's fair face was like the Death's head at a
feast; a remembrancer that sorrow is everywhere.
Hanson seemed quietly to watch her, though
he often repeated gayly that he would soon return.
When the good bye came, Hanson went to Jane
first. He' took her hand and said:
"Farewell......do~'t forget me."
She silently took his hand, and he passed on to
the rest. When he ha4 bade adieu to all and was
leaving, ~vith a wild sob Jane threw herself into his
arms.

tuAD;.~-lIOasLEY DETECTED-TEE DEAcON AND DAD
TAKE 1111W AT AN ADVANTAGE-HIS PUNISHMENT-
HE MEDITATES REVENGE.
Horaley was a character. A slim, sly fellow,
with a face like a deacon's, and with as much fun
in him as in Foote or Matthews. His name was
Samuel, but he occasionally went by the name of
"old floss," partly because it was a kind of play
upon his name, but mostly because of his great ap-
parent gravity and peculiar traits of character.
He had a great deal of address and manner too,
but he would have his joke upon all occasions, and
almost every thing, grave or gay, furnished him
with a jest, but he was gallant and true.
His father was a bookseller, and a member of the
church. There lived itear him a fancy store keep-
er, who might be called a monomaniac on the sub-
ject of cock-fighting, which, at the time I write of,
was a sport a good deal indulged in, in Baltimore
and its vicinity. I could* point out now, on the
York road, (for I must review these old scenes
again some of these days,) a house oa the right
hand side, just above Jenkin's tan yard, where the
sport was practiced. I remember riding out to
Mr. Stetson's in a lime cart one Saturday, and
stopping there with the driver, an old negro who
belonged to Governor Ridgicy, of Hampton. I
treated him for the ride, and he explained to me
the art and mystery of cock-fighting, which was
going on in a cock pit in the yard of the house,
which was a road-side grocery. I liked not the
sport, and I wondered how two fowls could fight
each other for nothing; but after all there was
something in the pitted courage of the two
cocks, who fought for victory, unconscious that
they had backers and that there were lookers on.
No wonder then that men, who have backers and
lookers on, should fight for victory without having
at heart as much game as these cocks in the pit.
Though the cocks, perchance, deserve more credit.
as *their valor is of a more unadulterated and

sophisticatedd character. I hope it is not so now,.
hough John Randolph said th'at when there was
~ock fighting and horse racing in Virginia there were
~entIemen in Virginia, and the eccentric Virginian
would doubtless apply the same remark to Mary-
[and The fancy store keeper, in opposition to the
~entleman from Virginia, had such a hatred to the
practice that he has been known to commit as-
saults and batteries upon different persons who had
presented themselves to his counter and asked for
chicken gaffs, or gaffes, as others call them.
Knowing this peculiarity of the store-keeper,
Horsley sent a drayman to him with an order on
him for a package of them, arid then watched
from a hiding place the effect, thinking, (and here
he was not as smart as usual,) that as he did not
know the drayman, even by sight, that the dray-
man did not know him. But when the enraged
store wan asked the drayman who sent him for
the article, that individual replied:
"He didn't know his name, but that he had
often seen him in Mr. ~orsley~s ~
"Was he a boy?"
"Yes, sir, a slim chance of a stripling.'
"Leave. sir," exclaimed the store-keeper.
The drayman left in double quick time, and the
store man, putting his hat on his head and hold-
ing the order tightly in his fist, as though it was
a bank note of great value, proceeded instantly to
old Mr. Horsicy's store.
The "old Ross" saw him go, and smelling a
* rat, he followed at a respectful distance, to see
where he was wending, and taking a spying posi-
tion at the window, he saw him enter and show
the note to his father, and he heard his father say:
"I am afraid, neighbor, it is my son's hand
write. I fear he is a wild youth."
"I have no doubt of it, neighbor, and you know
what the wisest man of the world has said about
sparing the rod. Good morning, neighbor."
The "old floss" further related that he saw his
father show the note to a deacon, present. He
dodged as the anti-gaff man left, and sat himself
down to rumination. He knew that he must niect
the responsibility some time or other, so he thought
he would meet it then, and in he went.
His father produced the order. LIe denied it.

Through all this liveliness in ~he tone of Horsley
there was an evident bitterness. His father had
always treated him with undue severity, for a
harmless wit and drollery, which, it always struck
me, resembled much the gentle Elm's idiosyncra-
ems. Horsley had something of the look of Lamb
in his features, but there was much more energy
and force in his character, yet his jokes were often
so strange and upon subjects which it seems almost
forbidden to treat with levity. Being brought up
in his father's book store, and kept under m'~ch re-
straint there, and having a great fondness for read-
ing, he was t~elebrated for his vast knowledge
among the intelligent customers of his father's es-
tablishment. Gentlemen who called in the store
for a particular book, have often been keown to in-

quire his opinion of it, and they would often refer
to him as to where they could obtain a particular
quotation. All this should have made his father

ALnd though he may have been proud of him, yet he
could not understand the original vein of mirth and

notions of propriety. florsley, poor fellow, lost his
mother at a very early age. He had only a slight
remembrance of herand I have seenhim, with Cow-
per's poems, on his knees, reading the poet's lines
upon his ~ picture, while the tears rolled
down his cheeks. He was a youth of true cour-
age, but when the idea of some wild prank crossed
his mind, it seemed that he could no more resist
the playing it than could the starving man resist
the taking of food if it were within his reach. It
was believed that his father, with his rigid notions
of things, could never get over a certain awful act
on the part of his son, perpetrated one Sunday in
the church, and that was no less a matter than the
taking of a pinch of snuff from the box of an old
clerk in the book store, who always came to church
with old Mr. Horsley. and who always kept his
snuff cox on the seat beside him, to keep himself
awake; but the clerk falling asleep, the lad quietly
applied the snuff to the sleeper's nose, which sud
denly awakened him, and what was strange, with
a fit of sneezing, which startled the whole congre-
gation with its loudness and frequency. Many
had observed the old clerk asleep, and as such a
thing was not known in the memory of the oldest
pew-holder, it had excited much attention; the con-
sequence was that the confusion of the congrega-
tion was complete.
Deep was the love between the old clerk, Mr.
Beazely, and the boy. The clerk understood his
character, and loved him as a fond parent loves an
only, sickly and gifted child. The old clerk took
the child as his bed fellow after his mother's death,
and absolutely nursed him with a woman's tender-
ness. He used to take him into the book store
with him, and show him pictures to amuse him,
and every body who entered the book storo might
see the old clerk, with the sickly boy in his arms,
waiting on the customers. He had acquired such
a habit of carrying the child on his left arm, and
waiting on the customers with the right, that he
could do anything necessary about the store just as
well with the boy on his arm as without. And then
the bright benevolence of the old clerk's face as he

At times Horsley was the gayest of the gay, but
in its very midst, if anything called up the name
of Beazely, he was all gloom for hours. Then he
had moods of abstraction, interrupted by the strang-
est pranks and contradictions. In fact, many per-
sons thought him partially deranged.

was restrained, from going to the theatre more than
two or three times by his influence, for he could be

believe if' the old lady had not given it to me, that
I would have stolen it from her-from no one else
but from her; and as I felt myself to be her heir, 1
should not have thought it theft to take that which
in course of time would naturally be mine. It is,
however, with such sophistries that crime always
begins.

feeling of the half angry lover who gazes upon the
coquette who has at last named an early day.. It
was something of Richard's, "I'll have her;"
the "I'll not keep her long," I can't say I added

think "Tiger Tail," the Indian, in some points
his equal. ! got Brutus, which I hold to be an
admirable play, the very next day, and went de-
claiming its beautiful passages everywhere.

After Air. Cooper's engagement was concluded,
Liooth was immediately to appear, and I was hoard-
ing my pocket money with Horsicy to see that
great but eccentric actor. 1 was told that Booth,
the morning of the evening in which he was to ap-
pear in Richard, could be seen in the market place,
selling his turnips, the produce of his farm near
Bel Air, and ! remember that Horsley and 1 got
up early and repaired to the market house to see
him, but we could not get him pointed out to us.
We went at night, Horsley and I. I was up to
trap, having been, and Horsley was determined to
go on my representation. He could command
more pocket money than I could, owing to the
unlimited indulgence of Mr. Beazely, who, Ishould
have mentioned, left him his fortune, which was
upwards of twenty-two thousand dollars, the pa-
tient savings of fifty years as salesman in different
bookstores, but mostly, as our readers are aware,
in Horsley's father's, for in no other capacity than
as salesman in a book store had he ever acted
The pit was seventy five cents, boxes one dollar
We were so far advanced toward manhood that the
announcement, children half price, did not apply to
us, though we would, in theatrical phrase, for that
night only, willingly have consented that it should.
We made the suggestion to the box keeper, chil-
dren half price.
"If your anxious mothers don't know you're
our," said the crusty, but humorous old box keeper,
taking what survey he could of us through the
pigeon hole, for we presented ourselves before him
half an hour before he had any other customer,
"you had better go home, piy children."
"But as 'yOu are all actors here, cannot we ap-
pear as children for this night only?" inquired Hors-
ley in his peculiar way.
"No, you can disappear s children though,~~ re
pJied he of the box office.
So my lame duck of a fifty cents being eked out
by twenty-five from Horsley's more abundant purse,
we purchased our tickets, and sat down with them
in our clasped hands by the pit door, against which
we pressed every two minutes to test the strength
of the door and know whether it was not open
yet. Soon it was opened, and we descended into
the pit in its emptiness. Here we debated with
ourselves which were the best seats, and we
~1

changed them until the increasing crowd left no
choice, and we kept our position by necessity.
"Now is the winter of our discontent,"
certainly it was the evening of my absolute content.
As characteristic I could not but smile at Horsicy,
who certainly saw everything ridiculous about the
play, and he was nt~t. unobservant of its beauties,
but who, when a most miserable apology of an ac-
tor announced:
"My lord, the Duke of Buckiugham is taken,"
exclaimed, loud enorjgh for half the house to hear
him,
"I wish you had been taken, too."
This created a shout of laughter in the pit, and
made Horsley almost as much the observed of the,
observers, as the proud representative of Shak-
speare's heroes himself.
But all this is of a date of earlier life than that
period at which I Qpened this chapter by saying,
while my good aunt thought I was preparing for
college, I was preparing for private theatricals.
Among the greatest events in a boy's life, at least
to himself, are his changes front school to school,
which like the passions he developes, are each of a
higher and more permanent cast than the other,
until he finds himself launched on the stream of
manhood to act for himself. Some of us, however,
are permitted t~ act for ourselves before we reach
the port and stature of a man, and it not unfre-
(luently proves sadly to our sorrow that we are-
"Lord~ of ourselves, that heritage of wo."
Yes, at the Pavilion theatre, vulgarly called the
mud theatre, in consequence of its location in the
meadows, there was a Thespian corps, of which I
was the star, the "particular" if not the "bright
star."
We were making every preparation to brink out
Byron~s Sardanapalus, at my suggestion, adapted to
the stage also by myself, and of course I was to be
the king. The great difficulty wasab )ut the femal
characters. For though in England, up to Charles
II. time, the female personations in the regular
drama were bearded men, yet matters did not get
on half so well aS when the bearded men were ex-
cluded from playing women. 1 was about to say
they might still appear in the parts of old women~
but I will not.

At once the happy suggestion came from one of
our number that probably Miss '~aria Watson,
who had detached herself from the company when
it left Washington, might be induced to play
Myrrha for a small remuneration, as she was poor,
and indeed it was hinted it would be a charity;
and that her mother could easily be obtained to
play the queen, it was also suggested.
"But what kind of a looking personage is Miss
Watson'?" I asked, though I knew very well, as I
had secretly prompted the matter.
"A cap-i-tal per-son," exclaimed my informer,
who was himself an humble member of the same
corps, whom we had gotten to speak to Miss Maira
on the subject-
This grave matter was the fruitful theme of
three evenings' debate, and I believe that those of
us who were in favor of having the sex legitimate
ly represented would have been out voted had I
not got Horslcy to make one of his droll speeches
upon the subject. The fear on the part of the anti-
Watsons was that our female acquaintances would
not come if we had actresses.
"Let them go then," exclaimed Horsley; "don't
they go to the regular drama and witness females
sustaining female characters? for my part, I've no
desire to shave my beard-I have a beard, gentle-
men-so close that it will never be heard of again,
and make my appearance as
"My own lonian Myrrha,"
There is a good deal of endearment between the
king and his Greek slave, which, to say the truth,
I would rather not enact, for instance:
"the breath
Of friends for truth, the lips of woman for
My only guerdon-so they are my Myrrha's.
Kiss me."
Those who have oot looked into Byron will find,
should they do so, that the noble poet here states
in so many explicit words, "he kisses her"-so
states the stage direction, and I suppose," he con-
tinned, turning to me, "my friend means to com-
~ily 'with the stage directions."
I bowed.
"I presume, so it is to be presumed, that the fair.
actress whoiu we propose having to honor us in
this part on 'this interesting occasion, expects to
comply with the stage directions also. I should

passage would like to be in Myrrha's place I don't

contemplate, is not unlikely to imitate in more
respects than one those proud spirits who have so
much awakened his and your emulation-those
proud representatives of Shakspeare's heroes ~vho
were very much in the habit of taking something
to take-Cooke and Kean for instance, to say
nothing of living worthies; and besides, I would
suggest that he has also something to take on the
part of the kingly Sardanapalus."
It was voted to request Miss Watson to aid us
on the occasion, and fifty dollars was also voted
out of the general fund of the society to pay her,
and myself and Horsley were appointed a commit-
tee of two to confer with Miss Maria Watson in
the premises.

I urged Horsley that night to meet me in the
morning, that we might together Call U~Ofl Miss
Watson and arrange matters, but it was not until
the next day that I got him started.
"Bjll," said he to me as we walked down Mar-
ket street, (it was then called Market street but
now Baltimore street,) what profession do you mean

"Well, what do you?" said I.
"Th tt's Yankee, but I'll answer you; I don't
know-I have a great attachment to books, and I
also feel sometimesstirrings to mingle in the strife
of the world. I rather presume, as I have a little
competency, that I shall follow my whims, and in
consequence make myself a very miserable fellow.
What are you going to do? whim, it too-you are
tolziming it now."
"Really, you have me there-I thought of the
law, but you see, Florsley, what an uphill work it
is; there is a drag on the wheel even in its ascent,
.-dook at the fellows we know-Johnson, Josephs,
Wilminson, they do not earn their salt-absolutely
do not earn their salt-yet! have some advantages
for the law; I suppose my oratorical talent would
aid me."
"Yes, in frothy Fourth of July declamations-
'shine out, fair sun,' just one little day and clouds
and darkness would be upon the rest of your year."
"Why so?" I asked, yet I felt myself blush.
"Why so? because so it will be. Now, Russell, I
don't suppose you have any idea of turning doctor,
the most abhorrent profession to me in the world.
I reverence that man who undertakes it as a phi-
lanthropist-I despise him who undertakes it for a
livelihood, or rather I respect him just as much and
no more, as I do the butcher who takes up a re-
voltixig but necessary trade to live by it. But I
repeat, the man who does it that he may do good
has my profoundest homage. I take it you are not
that man."
"Thank you, Horsley."
"For nothing. I am speaking seriously. If
you 'read law,' as the phrase is, the law will be
unread, while you will be 'reading the lore of
ladies' eyes,' as Tom Moore or some other Tom
says. You will just be among the host of idlers
who dawdle their time away about the court house,

"Why, what the deuce would you have me

"I would not have you of such as I have describ-
ed. If you 'read law,' you surely will be, unless
you are born again-I do not meaii to speak ir-
reverently-of the spirit of the law. You have tal-
ents, quick perceptions, and a great deal of muscu-
lar energy. You are of the temperament of actors
and orators, 1 will admit, but you have strong
passions which you have not learned to curb, and
I am afraid you have a good many wild oats to sow,
and if I could not break the stick as I choose, I
would wear it gracefully and not give it to another
to break my head with."
"What are you driving at?"
"Well, not exactly what you are driving at-
an actress and private theatricals. I am thinking
of your position on the public stage among real ac-
~ where we have no kings. Here, were you to
attempt to play the part of a republican, a private
Sardanapalus, you would meet the fate of the king-

the stage, and who himself, talking of the life
which he has led, speaks also of affording an ex-
ample of warning to others, to
"avoidthe life
Which led to such a consummation."
"Really, Horslcy, you have turned moralist."
"Not a bit of it. I see your character-I am
your friend-and I would, to use a phrase natu-
rally arising in my mind, from our present mat-
ters in hand, I would have you place yourself pro-
perly and gracefully on the stage before the curtain

'The first true gentleman that ever lived,'
as one of the poets has beautifully said of the Sa-
viour?"
"Why no, I expect not that," said I, somewhat.
annoyed, for there was an earnest, searching man-
ner about Horsley, which I could neither dodge
nor laugh at.
"There, here we are at a stand ~ said he,
stopping in the street.
"Stand still! why, man, we are going to see Miss
Watson."
"Yes, so we are, but you're not fitting yourself
for college. I have been observing you some time,
Russell-you are not fitting yourself for college-
you are unfitting yourself for college and fitting
yourself for anything else."
"What would you have me do, I repeat'?"
"There's the rub, I repeat. 'Tis decided you
will not be a physician."
"Certainly nut," I exclaimed.
"You ~ be a lawyer?~~
"That's not so certain," I replied, "I certainly
had notions that way, but say out your say, speak
the speech, I pray you, not as I pronounced it to
you of the law, but just as it would occur to you
of your own advisement, like old Polonius to

"Well, agreed. But as I was saying about
your choosing a profe~sion-you have talent and
all that enough, but your love of the sex, your
high animal spirits, and your want of patient ap-

as to give you any other than a nominal position at
the bar. I tell you why I say all this. Old
Gorum, the lawyer, was in the store the other
day when you were, you remember. When you
went out he spoke of you; he said you were a man
of talent, that he was pleased with your conversa-

at ease about the bar upon what money they have,
and do nothing hut set a bad example to the poorer

"Well,, what would you have me do?"
"Why, call yourself a farmer, live gracefully on

a planter; but to prevent being taken up under the

CHAPTER XV.
MISS WATSON A t HOME-HER APARTMENTS-wE DIscuss
HER BEFORE SHE ENTERS-HER APPEARANCE-SHE
CONSENTS TO APPEAR AS MYREHA-wE STUDY OUR
PARTS TOGETHER-SCENES BETWEEN US-HER AlERT-
TION-SEE MAKES ME FORGET OTHER PEOPLE.
It was in Old Town, just over Market street
bridge, that we found the abiding place of Miss
Watson. A little black girl, who seemed to be
what the New Englanders would call the "help"
of the family, opened the door, and ushered us
into a parlor, very plain, and with nothing notice.
able about it. She announced to us that Miss Wat-
Sun was in, and would be down presently. Miss
Watson had been very much the admiration of
our club for her performance in light comedy, and
some of her characters in farces were admirable, but
she had never found place yet in the higher walks
of the drama, and the quere was, could she per-
sonate such a character as Myrrha? I, who was
anxious for the eclat of appearing with a real ac-
tress, and Horsley, who seemed always, except
when he had some wild prank in his head, to think
of the fitness of things, and who seemed to yield
to my humors that he might control me in higher
matters, as I have suspected since, was decidedly
for having her undertake the part if she felt dis-
posed to do so.
Miss ~ personations in the lighter drama
had impressed me very favorably. There was an
airy grace and naivete in her manner, which was
very taking, and in those graver parts which came
up, even in the lightest representations, there was
an impresiveness and pathos which it seemed to me
only wanted opportunities of development to cx-
hibit tragic talent of a very high order. At least
such was ray impression, and I had thought overt
such mattOrs a great deal. There also was a
strength of expression in her countenance, which'
had been frequently remarked upon, and an energy~
in her look and hearing that seemed to promise~
something not yet fulfilled. This struck me-.-but~
the young lady was still only the queen of cham-~
her maids in comedies and the dashing second rater
line of characters of farces.
"~hc is keeping us waiting for an histrionic dis-
plny in her toilet, I suspect," whispered Horsley

'C
suppose she will enter gew-gawed to death
and dressed within onc mortal half inch of her life.'~
But be had scarcely spoken when the doox
opened, and Miss Watson made quite a dignified
and at the same time easy entrance. She was
dressed in a calico wrapper, of a plain and dark
pattern, with a simple linen collar turned over and
I confined with an ordinary broach, and I observed
she wore quite a stout shoe, though it fit exquisite-
ly, and the foot was very small, with a springing
and high instep; her mouth was rather large, but
she had beautiful teeth, and her chiseled nostril
moved with every breath, which gave a look of
passion to her face. Her brow was broad, not
high, and the tern pies were accurately defined.
with that look of genius about them of which Cole-
ridge speaks-at least I thought so, for she was to
play Myrrha to my Sardanapalus.
"1 have made no toilet, because," said she, "I
would not keep you waiting," and she requested
us to be seated.
I left llorsley to talk over the matter of our
visit, the while my admiring eye was full upon
the attracttve actress.
CC I will be frank with you3 gentlemen,~~ she
said, catching back her curls with the tortoise
shell comb, such as were worn in those days, and
speaking evidently without disguise, "I think my-
self qualified to play such a part as Myrrha, though
circumstances which I could not, of course, control,
have kept me in a different line of characters. I
am anxious to show that I can enact higher char-
acters. Vou, I believe, Mr. Russell, play Sar-
danapalus."
"With you for a Myrrha I shall try-at least I
may serve as a foil to you.~~
"I have often heard, Mr. Russell, of your taste
for the drama, and of your skill in reading-have
you ever played before?"
"Never-this is my first atteral)t."
"Do you think you can stand unnerved the au-
dience, the array of lights, the music, the excite-
ment?"
"I am inclined to think so," I replied-"are you
a physiognornisr-don't you think so?"
"Well. I'm not a physiognornist, and there is
no telling; the subsequently most suceessfui have
failed at first"
'3

41

"True," I said, "but we do not sell any tickets
-we give them away to our friends, and there
will be none hut friends there-so I hope to sus-
tain myself."
"Oh! there's no doubt about your sustaining
yourself; as far as knowing his part and repeating
it goes, I assure you, Miss Watson, he will be
there. Eever since he was knee high to his aunt's
footstool he has declaimed to the delight of every-
body and to the especial delight of the declaimer-
the experience of Dick, the apprentice, is nothing
to Ilussell's-all I fear is that nothing mal-apropos
~rill happen to cure him of his stage mania. I
charge you, on your conscience, do nothing to in.
flame it, Miss W~~5~n?~
"On my conscience," replied the lady, "and I
assure you, I know no amateur actor with whom I
would so soon appear as with Mr. Russell-I have
heard of his readings, and in fact I have heard him
read."
"No matter-I'll tell you some other time," re-
torted the lady archly, "but I have little doubt of
Mr. Russell's success if his nerve hold out-
and"-
"Speak out," I said.                -
"We only understood the stage effect. I feel,
gentlemen, great solicitude in this matter~, for this
reason, that should I make a hit as Myrrha, why
the town will talk about it-that very portion
which you represent, and who are the patrons of
the drama; and I shall then have ~n opportunity of
placing myself in proper position with the manager,
therefore I am doubly anxious that everything
should go off well. With you, Mr. Russell," she
said, turning to me, "the affair is the eclat of a
night, and your want of success would be nothing,
for should you greatly succeed, you might be told,
what Chesterfield-was it no ?-said to the gen-
tlema' who danced remarkably well, that he
danced too well ror a gentleman- so you may act
too well-I mean in tee player's l)art-for a gen-
tleman. With me it is different; I play profession-
ally, and cannot play too ~vell for anl actress."
"We have one of your corps who will assist in
all matters whereof we are ignorant,~7 I remarked.
"Yes," said the fair actress, "you must let me
see the play as you have adapted it, Mr. Russell.

THE' AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF

Do Crafts, (the man who was assisting us) has
told me' that lie thought very highly of it. You
must let me see it; I should like to read it with
you several ~
"It will give me great 'pleasure. Really, if in
our little corps you should make a' hit in a new
line of acting, and so high a 'one, we shall deserve
a place in theatrical history."
The fair actress blushed; Ipromised to call on
the morrow with the play. and we took our leave
with the understanding that she was to appear in
the part.
To the forgetfulness of everything I studied my
part with the fair actress. Morning, noon' and
night was I strolling over into Old Town. I re-
member now how I used to take a by street that I
might rehearse my part a little tQ myself as I went
along. And then the 'perfectly at home manner of
the actress. She dwelt in a small two story house
in Front street, which was very plainly furnished,
and in which, as I have said before, there was
nothing that marked the professional life of the
indweller. The little black girl, who caine to the
door, was their only servant, and ~liss Watson in-
formed me that herself and mother painted'maps
for the booksellers, or even took in sewing when
not professionally engaged. She had been twice
on a professional tour, but she did not like it, and
she said she was not sorry when the present man-
aglr had left without engaging them. Her mother
was not at all remarkable as an actress, and just
maintained the footing of always being letter per-
feet in her part, and of performing it respectably..
"If you will stay and dine, I will give you a
mutton chop and a potatoes " she would say, "and
you'll excuse me if I set the table in your presence
you can watch me and see if I don't do it well.
Did you never observe that we theatrical people
always have the manner of persons looked at; that
is, we always sit with a grace, a consciousness,
and stand with a consciousness, and live, and move
an(l have our being with a consciousness-there,"
said she, bowing to me one evening when I was
staying to tea, "and did I not, 0! kingly Sardana-
piles, put that plate down with a grace?"
"You did, my own lonian Myrrha. By the
bye, look here, Miss Myrrha, Byron says here, in his
dramatic persoute: 'Myrrha, an lonian female slave

and the favorite of Sarditnapalds.' Thereby hang8
the wish tha~t Sardanapalus might be your favor-
he-one good turn deserves another."
"So you are my fayorit~, do 1 not love you-do
'I not say my 'la~t' thought is yo.nr's7 do I not
*die fQr you--ia the play?"
"But will you live, for me here?"
"Come, King Sardanapalus, keep your love-

"or carry it to the ears that should, properly listen
to it."
"Here, mon amje," she would say, "when you
embrace me at that passage where yo~i tell me I
embrace you:
"Myrrba, embrace me; yet oace more, eace more!
Love we whate'er'betide: My chiefest glory
~halI be to maice me worthier of thy love-"
"Please put your'arm just so--and. I will so
manage it that the ladies,' your dear friends, can
not know whether there is any kissing or not. I
foresee I shall get' you into trouble. I kiss profes-
sionally.-. never at rehearsals, never-but on the
stage, and there I have about as much feeling in the
matter as Napoleoii's sister, Pauline, had, when
she sat to Coiiova, and that was none at all, for the
room was 'well aired.' lh fact, my feeling', is
generally that of supreme disgust, to be breathed
upon by the gin-blasted breath ot some poor drunken
wretch, who is playing Paul to my Peggy ~n
some farce or other. I assure you, my goid sir,
'us no farce to me. So even the quakers would
pardon me as' they pardoned a 'Friend' who was
caught kissing a simple sister, inasmuch a~ I 'kiss
without an appetite.'"
Sometimes Miss Watson' and I ~vould take a
ride away into ihq country, andY wandering deep
into the woods, we would rehearse our parts to-
gether. She read beautifully, and how I delighted
to lay my full length along at her feet and listen
to the music of her voice. I believed myself a
good reader, and she flattered me into the convie-
tiofl that I was one, so I often took the book and
w~td to her, arid we would talk together with soeb
a warm sympathy, of poetry, literature, a~oing;
an(l the passioris'too, we would discuss, and that
of lpve was often in our rIa~egory.

conduct seemed above rejroach, and I observed,
in all her freedom of intercourse with me, no one
seemed 'disposed' to scandalize her. I saw'in her a
deep ambition, the deepest to become distinguished,
as she felt convinced she bud the power to distin-
guish.herself. We were full 'a month in prepara-
tion for our play, and I observed that her enthusia-
ism 'never abated for a moment. I was; though I
saw her daily, frequently in the reception of notes
from her about some matter pertaining to t~ae play,
whitib she had forgotten in our last interview, ~nd
though we. had again and again rehearsed ~ur parts
together, she never seemed to tire of it, and I
could not but think that she was about to make a
decided hit. I felt my own courage mount, and
the conviction came to me ~h'at I was not ~o fail,
whenever we rehearsed together.
'She seemed to like me veiy much. She always
ran up tome with so much joy in her countenance
whenever I met her at rehearsal, y't she would
say to me when we had been, for instance, rehaars-

TAIN FALLS-HER EMOTION-THE CONDUCT OF MRS~
CROMPTON.
One, day, it was in the early fall, and the beau'
ful trees of our Americanforest were just taking
'the tinge of the change which was coming upon
theni, when Miss Watson and myself rode out into
the country to enjoy the delicious weather and
each other's society alone, and to rehearse together
our parts.
I left my horses and vehicle in charge of the boy
who had driven us, and I proposed to her that we
should take a stroll to a very romantic pldee called
Oak Glen, about 'a mile and a half above Baltzell's
blacksmith shop. She had often heard me speak
of the glen~ aud was anxious to visit it. Accordin~r-
ingly arm in arm we wended our way thither in the
pleasante~t kind of chat-now repeating a' passage
of poetry, now talking of some point made by some
distiu~uished actress or actor, now discussing the
different re'adiugs of Shakspeare, and now'givin~'
our own readings of the l)assioiIs as to how they
exhibited' themselves, and on my part, at least,
mixing a~ little of the reality with the discussion.
Our purpose wac to view ilie glen and not to enter
it; so by an easy pathway we wound round a hill,
an(l came to a point 'where a broad sheet of water
was (ompreSsC(l between two hills,~ou~ of which~
the one on which we stood, was quite flat on top,
with a precipitous tetininatiolt at the point wher&amp;
the stream passed through. Here, undei' an old oak
called the Deer oak, from the fact that it was a
Spot from which mauy deer had been killed, when
thty were ku )wri in the neighborhood, we took a
seat ~nd gazed in silence over t~'ie beautiful glen~


44                         THF~ AUTOBI
with the thread of silver water gleaming through'
it. Only at this point could the glen be dis-
tinctly seen, for at all others the oaks and un-
derwood were so thick around as entirely to inter-
cept the view. Here we sat, entirely secluded as
it were from the world, at the foot of' the old oak,
to which, I may observe, a path wound up more
abruptly than the other, on the side of the hill
by which we had ascended.
After dwelling on the beauties of the scenery
around us, I drew my MS of my adaptation of Sar-
danapalus to the stage from my pocket, and began to
read it. Almost unconsciously Miss Watson rose
to her feet, and we rehearsed the most difficult
scenes as they occurred to us. In the midst of our
employment, who should come suddenly upon us
but Booth and Martha Jones.
I laughingly explainedeto them what we were
doing, and made Booth promise that if I sent him
tickets he would come and bring Martha with
him, and I introduced them to Miss Watson.
Martha had never been to a theatre, and Booth
said that he would take her with' pleasure. Booth
was a man of ability, but poor, and with hard
scratching he was managing to live while he
read law. There had been a great intimacy be-
tween him and Martha ever since the affair at
Lusby~s school, when Booth prevented her being
punished by knocking down the teacher. Booth's
position in life was an humble one, and I used to
think at times there was a dogged discontent about
him that made him very disagreeable.
"I shall be so glad to go to the performance,~~ I
said Martha, "1 have never been to a theatre, I
and I know nothing of them, except that I have I
heard you read and recite, and. talk of such things." C
"Yes, Martha, you were among my first encour-
agers, and 1 shall never forget it. I believe you
were the very first. It is tho§e who first notice
us, is it not," said I, turning to tli'e actress, "whom t'
we longest remember, rather than those who chime' C
in, be it ever so loudly, with the general voice?" d
"I think so," she replied. "I shall never forget I~
the encouragement which old Burke, our prompter, 1~

thing but want of ability. Well, ['ye sensitiveness
enough. Would you believe it, as the time ap-
proaches, I shrink fearfully from attempting the
character of Myrrha-one so much out of my'
line."
"You think I'm honest, don't you?" I asked.
"Well, I do, except where women are concern-
ed, as Addison would say."
"Where you are concerned, in all respects hon-
est. You have given me credit for some judgment
and taste, in theatrical matters. I tell you, you
will succeed-observe, all the parts will be respect.
tably maintained. We have been rehearsing now
for six weeks, by daylight and by candlelight, so
every one knows his part. Remember, we have
been rehearsing before a whole pit full of friends-
'twas like an audience-'twas an audience. I do
not think any one Will be panic stricken, and if you
just let yourself out, abandon yourself to your feel-
ings, you'll make a hit, I feel convinced. Don't
fear any fright on my part. I have declaimed a
great deal in public, and I know that with von as
Myrrha I can acquit myself pretty well for me."
~ curious, but' as the time approached I
had to encourage the actress, but then she 'felt she
had so much at stake.
At length rlu~ important night arrived. The
house was crowded by all the fashion and beauty,
that could by any means obtain admission, and as
ur tickets were given away to our friends, the
hing was considered very select. Alice Clare ap-
cared early in the stage box, attended by Mr.
Peterson, who evidently had taken the greatest
)ains with his toilet, and who evidently was taking
very pains to make an impression. Booth was
here, attending Martha Jones, and 1 was struck
vith the expression of her subdued, earnest and
beautiful countenance. There was Mrs. Cromp-
on, the most aristocratic lady of the city, with a
rowd of fitshionablen about her; she was a lady of
decided poetical talent, and as heaotuful as Mrs.
~orton, who has so much. I had submitted ray
IS of ~\'~y adaptation of th~ play to her, and had
~on h9r regard by following her advice in several
particulars. There were a good many there who

more brilliant audience-every person in the house
was well dressed, and held, at least, a respectable
situation in society.
I may say all the characters were well sustain-
ed. Tom Johnstone, who played Salemenes, ac-
quitted himself with great credit; he exhibited
decided histrionic talent. I observed that Mr.
Peterson was loud in his applause of him, partic-
ularly in the scenes between Salemenes and Sar-
danapalus-but I do not feel disposed to mention
any particular one, except Miss Watson. I had
gone after her myself, previous to dressing, and
brought her dressed to the theatre; she looked the
character admirably. But I was astonished at her
nervousness. She put her hand in mine as we
rode together to the theatre, and I remarked to
myself its strange coldness, and that she never
said a word.
"My dear friend," said I, "what is the mat-
ter?"
"Oh!" said she, clasping my hand, "I have so
panted to have an opportunity like this, to appear in
a first rate part in tragedy, and here now that it is
offered me under such happy auspices why should
I feel so dreadful? this is just as bad as a first ap-
pearance.~~
"The house was nearly full before I ca~e~you~ll
have a brilliant audience. [ will do my best to
sustain you. I think we'll-you'll coitie it-indeed
I do-and then if you exhibit the talent I know
you possess, your fortune ts made-for we'll make~
you the fashion."
According to my adaptation, Sardanapalus enters
in soliloquy, and is soon followed by My rrha. I say
nothing of my greeting, but Miss Watson's was
enthusiastic, and she looked the character so well,
and bowed so gracefully to her greeting' that it was
renewed again and again. The first scene, which
is not very striking, Miss Watson got through
well. It began to be whispered about the house,
as she with dignity claimed to retire, saying:
"My sovereigfi,
I prdy, and thou too, good prince, permit my absence,"
that she was better in tragedy than comedy. But
in the second scene hsr powers expanded, she be-
gan to feel the fruition of her gifts. This passage
drew down thunders of applause:

45

MYlUIHA.
"Frown not upon use; you have smiled
Too often on me not to make those frowns
Bitterer to hear than any punishment
Which they may augur. R'in~, 1 am your subject!
Master, Jam your slave-Man, I have loved you-
Loved you I know not by what fatal weakness,
Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs-
A slave and hating fetters-an Innian,
Aad therefore when I love a stranger, more
Degraded by that passion than by chains!
Still I have loved you. If that love was strong
Enough to overcome alt former nature,
Shall it not claim the privilege to serve you?"
The parts I have italicised were given with the
highest effect; you could have heard the rustling of
Mrs. Crompton's lilac satin. The following pas-
sage was beautifully uttered. 0! her tones were so
full of Woman's true tenWerness, and her eye filled
and floated in a pearly tear, which, as she conclud-
ed the sentence, stole out upon her cheek and
glittered there a diamond of the purest water:
MYRRUA.
"The very first
Of human lire must spring from woman's breast,
Your first small ~vords are taught ~eu from her lips,
Your first tears quenched by her, and your lastsighs
Foe often breathed out in a woman's hearing;
When men have shrunk from the ignoble care
Of watching the last hour of him who led them,"
When Sardanapalus replies to this:
My eloquent Joatan! thou speakest music,'~
the whole house thundered with applause.
And further on, where the King refuses to yield
to the entreaties of his warriors, and determines
to go forth to the banquet-
IIIYRRHA.
~sen thou wilt not yield,
Even for the sake of all that ever stirred
A monarch into action, to forego
A trifling revel"
SAROANArALUS.
"No."
AL~ RRItA.
"Then yieldfor mine,
For ray sake."
This last line was uttered with such deep ten-
(lerness ;hat no one wondered that the King yield-
e(l for her sake. I know as I stood beside her,
her tones thrilled to my very soul, and I verily
believe the great credit I got for my acting was
inspired by the magnetism of hers. The soliloquy
of My rrha, which closes the first act, was given
with great effect, and as the curtain "ent down


we met in the green-room.
"How have I done?" said she, in a tremulou:
whisper, as she grasped my hand.
~sGreatly,~~ I replied. "Fanny Kemble conk
not equality, she has not your tones of tenderness.'
She folded her arms upon her heart, and i'aic
nothing,, but the quick breathing 6f her fram
showed how much she felt.
In the 2d act' Myrrha has nothing to do, except
in the closing scehe, which she, gave with in-
creased effect.
In the 3d act, where she tells Sardanapalus to
"Go forth and conquer,"
and where, When left alone, after soliloquizing, she
draws forth the vial of "cunning Colchian poison,"
she was great. The "go forth and conquer" was
uttered in tones which pealed through the whole
house, and the audience fairly shouted their ap-
probation.
Where she tells Pania to go forth to the battle
and to leave her, ~he was very powerful. This
passage at her exit was very effective:
"Nay then Iwill UO forth,
A feeble f~mate 'n~idst thezr desperate strife,
And bid thee guard ~ne tkqre-where thou shouldst shield
Thy sovereign."    .          -.
In the closing scene of this act (3d) where she as-
sists Sardanapalus, who is wounded, off tIje stage,
her tones of -tenderness were again' most taking.
Her simple "pray lean on. me," touched all
hearts.
"I am making some of those fair gi4s jeal-
ous,'~ she said to n~e -as w&amp; teach ed th~ ~reerI
room. 'What a gorgeous beauty that Miss Clare
is-how she. watches us-she is in love with-you."
"ha, do you think so-rather with the gentle-
*     man who is with her in the box."            -
"No, with you-'she feels so much, that she has
ceased to plk~r him off on you. I (hin't wonder,
indeed, 'you d~ look wall 'to tight. You are a
very Sardanapalus in yotir nature, I fear."
In act 4th, Myrrha~s manner in listening to the
drearri of Sardanlipalos was anithir emsuuitOte
i~i~'~e of acting. The ~hitting expre~simn of lt~r
face was marvellom-.-.it was observed that the :~u~

ri Her mother as Zarina played with great spirit,
owing no doubt to her daughter's success.
s In the last act, where Myrrha fires the pile,
she rose to the full sublimity of the tragic Muse.
I Her farewell to lonia, which, with the aid of Mrs.
Crompton, I had made longer than it is in the or
I iginal, was uttered with an effect that drew tears
from every eye. And her last words, ere she
mounts the blazing pile: -
- "'Tis fired, 1 come,"
were spoken in such a phrenzy of devotion, yet
so caIrn withal, that when the ~urIain fell, the
whole house, ladies and all, rose, and called for
her again and again. -
"You must go out," I said to her.
"But what can I say-I cannot speak my gra-
titude," and she shook in every fibre.
'You must bow in acknowledgment at least-
crime my dear, my dearest friend," and I led her
forth.
Thunders of applause greeted her appearance,
and then there was the deepest silence, while
every person stood up. The fair actress looked
round the house, as if she would. meet the eye of
every person in it, and I was impressed with what
I thought to .be her calmness, when laying her
hand upon her heart, she burst into tears..
In a silence born of profound resliect, I led Miss
Watson off the stage, and as soon as the Stage
door closed upon us again, the theatre rc~echoed
with deafening applaitse.
While I was exchanging my kingly robes for
republican ones-of Plain black, Horslcy, who, out
of respect to his father, wotdd not take any part,
though he would have shone in otte, came to itte
with a message from Mrs. Grompton, saying site
would be glad to see me in her box.
"Wait for me a moment, Fitusley, and I'll go
with you. What did you think of Miss Watson?"
"Think of her! great, magnificent. Russell,
our 'Ihespian COt~5 will have a place in history."
"That's ins', what I have told her, und she
bears it SO W(-lI.~
"B~antifnlly," said hlorsley, with enthusiasm,
''hcaiitifnlly."    -

In a moment more, leaning on llorsl~y~s arm, I
presented myself to Mrs. Crompton.
"'Who is Miss 'Watson, Mr. Russell?'
I told her.'
"Ab, and has she to -paint maps and take in
sewing for a living?"
"She has, Madam, I have it from her own
lips."
"Mrs. Crompton looked at me with a searching
eye.
"Mi. Russell, is her character unimpeached?"
"It is, Madam, on my honor, as far as I know,
unimpeachable. I believe, Madam, the elevation
of her character is equal to the greatness of her
genius."
"Do you think she has disrobed herself."
"Yes, Madam, I left her in a plain black silk,
in the green-room."
"Can we easily get there?"
"Easily, Madam."
"I will take your arm, then, and call upon her
and pay my respects to her. She is a brilliant
creature. I never witnessed better acting, and I
have seen muuh of it abroad as well a.~ at home."
So saying, Mrs. Crompton took my arm, and
making way for her through the crowd, we entered
at the side door, and passed across the stage, the
curtain being down, into the green-room. We
foiind her surrounded by a crowd of adoring Thes-
pians, attired in a plain black silk, her best and
only dress gown in fact. I presented Mrs. Cromp-
ton to her, and her manner, if possible, was better
to the lady than it had been on the stage.
"My dear." said Mrs. Crompton, "I cannot
tell you how delighted I am-how delighted we
all are. I have been partial to the theatre, and I
have seen much acting. I never saw better; we
have a jewel of therarest excellence in our midst,
and knew it not until to-night. You seem tired?"
"Thank you. 0! thank you for your kind

placing her arm in her own, led the trem-

through the whole house that Mrs. Crompton,
the first lady of our city, had gone into the green-
room to compliment Miss Watson, and when that
lady appeared, leading her in, and ~gave her the

"Where's your mother," I whispered to Miss
Watson.
"Mother has gone home to get a little supper
for you and, me," she replied, "when all this is
ove;"
Just at this moment the hell rang. I looked in
wonder at the stage, knowing that the farce, which
was 'Raising the Wind," could not come on so
soon, as Jim Jumper had to dress far the principal
female character, and he had not begun when I
left the dressing room, when lo! who should make
his appearance l)elore the foot lights but Horsley
himself, in his plain citizen's dress; he was very
popular with everybody, and so he was loudly ap-
j)laude(l before they knew what he had to say.
"Ladies and gentlemen," said he, with that
naivete and attractiveness of manner for which he
was remarkable, "I have the great gratification to

We are of opinion that the true way to acknow-
ledge genius is to reward it."
Thunders of applause greeted this announ~ie-
ment; I felt a little nervous at the idea of
playing for money, and I wondered that such an
arrangement shotild be made without consulting me.
In a few moments I withdrew from Mrs. Cromp-
ton's box, and entered Mr. Peterson's, who did n~t
wear the merriest f~tce in the world, and who kept
his seat close by Miss Clare. I bowed. Mr.
Peterson uttered some inane compliment to my
Sardanapalus, and grew loud in the praise of Tom
Johastone's Salemenes, but I grew louder and over
topped him, and told him that Tom was greater in
farce, if possible, than in tragedy. "Garrick,"
said I, "was painted between comedy and tragedy,
with an inclination towards the comic muse, to
show the tendency of his genius, and so our friend
Johnstone might be painted. Though I don't
know, perhaps his tragic powers are the gicater
after all, and then ,the character of Salemenes is
the most difficult in the play."
Mr. Peterson was silent.
"Well," said Alice, "I have been reading
Sardanapalus repeatedly since you have had it in
rehearsal. It is.a beautiful play. What made you
select such a character?-it is a very odious one."
"I don't think so."
"Don't think so," echoed Alice, "what do you
think of his treatment to his wife-it's almost a5
bad as Napoleon's treatment of Josephine. To
think of a woman, and a wife too, flinging her love
away on such a man."
"Why; Miss Glare, that is a harsh censure."
"It is just, Mr. Russell. I hope you don't jus-
tify Sardanapalus, do you?"
"I think he could not but love ~lyrrha, and we
must think of the times in which he lived."
"Well, who is Miss Watson?"
"Alice, does she not play magnificently,.is she
not superb?"
"Yes, she plays beautifully, but I wonder a deli-

"Why not, Alice, you don't object to the King,
do you, to your humble servant, King Sardanapa-
Ins," said I, laughing.
"Say Miss Glare, if you please. Mr. Russell-I
object to the playing," said Alice, haughtily.

I could not but observe the grim satisfaction
which here sat upon Mr. Peterson's features.
"A proper sentiment, Miss Glare," he remarked.
"You don't object to the player, i~hough, Alice
-Miss Glare-do you?"
"I certainly do object to the player's playing
such a parr-such sentiments."
"My own Jonian Myrrha,~~~I exclaimed-
"Alice, it was reality, it was no playing.".
"Well, sir, there is your "own lonian ~yrrha~~
opposite, with Mrs. Crompton, who, I suppose,
means to make a lioness of her. I advise you to
take the reality to her, sir. I hope you'll meet
with a return."
"Thank you, Miss Glare, to obey your com-
mand is but to follow my inclination," and bowing
haughtily I withdrew.
I entered the box where Martha Jones was seat-
ed with Booth, feeling that I ought to speak to
her, and yet shrinking at the idea that I might be
thought fishing for compliments.
"Martha, I trust you are well to-night--good
evening, Mr. Booth." The gentleman bowed and
offered me. a seat, but I declined it.
"0! well,. I thank you, Mr. Russell, and so
much gratified. I want you to promise me one
thing."
"What's that, you shall have it."
"That ribbon which you wore with thoso flow-
ers round your head. I have a fancy for them."
"Certainly, you pay me a great compliment.
I will go and get it now." And before she could
prevent me I departed.
In the grecit room I found Horsicy discussing his
announcement of the second performance with a
number of the Thespians.
"Fellows, I did it myself," said he, "because I
could not call you together. I gain no cuba by it~
I do not appear. but this lady is poor-what a
magnificent actress she is!--. and this move will give
her a thousand dollars-come, I'll ensure iL. No,

a kind one towards Miss Watson, whom [scarcely
know. I expect to get a thundering lecture as it is
from the old gentleman. Some 'dear, good natur
ed friend' will tell him, I don't doubt, that I
made my appearance too, but he won't tell how or
why."
I hastened with my ribbon and flowers to
Martha Jonas, who ~eeeived them with SO much
real pleasure.
"Now," said she, "the next time you come to
see me I want you to read the play to me-will
you not? I thought MissWatsort had a fine eye
and face when you introduced me to her under the
deer oak, but I had no idea that she could make me
feel as I have felt to-night-my, my, but she is so
gifted."
"Yes," said Booth, "and she has been playing
here for this year past in lhrces and not exhibiting

"Foote made his first appearance in Othello,"
said I, "and he made a failure of course. And I
believe Matthews thought his forte was tragedy.

Here I saw Miss Watson beckoning to mc, and I
hastened to her side.
"Indeed I feel so worn out," she whispered to
me "I should like to go home; so many persons
have been here to say pretty things to me, that 1
am quite exhausted. I exerted myself so
"I whispered to Mrs. Crompton her condition,
and she told me to use her carriage and escort her
home.
"Adieu, Miss Watson," she said, in her kindest
tone, "we shall soc you at your benefit-every one
now will appreciate your genius."
Scarcely a word did either of us speak as we
Tolled in Mrs. Crompton's stately carriage to the
humble house of my fair companion, whither I
had ordered, without her knowing it, a collation,
that her mother might be spared the expense and
trouble of getting one.
Arrived there, Miss Watson walked to and fro
two or, three times, and then, as if impelled by an
impulse she cruld not resist, she threw herself ir.
toy arms and exclaimed:
"My more than lover, my true, disinterested

I led her to the sofa, and seated upon it pbs
rested her head upon my bosom, and I felt through
the thin cambric her warm tears on my very heart,
and I believe they awakened more than one ira-
pulse there, dormant until then.
Mrs. Watson's manner arrested my attention;
she silently embraced her daughter when they met,
and while she was arranging the table for our little
feast of wine and birds, she could not take her eyes
from her daughter, but seemed to look at her in a
bewildered wonderment.
I told Miss Watson of the scene between Alice
and myself~
"Beware, my friend," said she, with great
seriousness, "if you love her, beware-.-a jealous

only be gotten from the different members of the

There was a pathos in her tones that moved
every heart. I glanced at Alice at the moment

scarcely ten feet from me; there was something in
its expression which 1 could not read-it seemed
both cold and kind, reproachful and forgiving,
Miss Watson noticed it to me after we left the
stage, and said she thought Peterson was playing
irte false in some wtiy or other.
In the last act the curtain fell in a tempest of ap.
please4 Miss Watson was called out, and I had
the honor of presenting her to the audience. She
had committed a, speech~ which I had prepared for
he~r, but she could not utter it.
"Spealc kir me, 0! speak for me," she said,
"Ladies and gentle~en,~~ I remarked, "the lady
who leans upon my arm has desired me to speak
for bet. Though she had pri~meditated something
to say in return jbr your kindness, she cannot give

his body to and fro, leading the cheering.
The U( notable Lorane Dudley, attached to the
English embassy at Washington, and a gentleman
of noble descent and heir to an earldom, who had
seen the best actors of the age, and who was es-
teemed a person of taste in theatricals, averred to
me that he had never seen better 'acting on either
the French or English stage. After the play' was
over, I escorted Miss Watson to Mrs. Crompton's
box, at that lady's request, and the whole house
rose and uncovered as she entered. 'Mr. Dudley
asked Mrs. (3rompton to present him to Miss Wat-
son, and he advised her by all means to go abroad.
tie said, and lie would endorse it, that she would
succeed in Diury Lane, and he promised, if she
would~ go, to give her such letters as would ensure
her an appearance in whatever character she might
select.
Through the whole evening Miss Clare and I
only spoke to each 6ther at ~ distance. I called on
Martha Jones'and had a pleasant talk with her and
others of my acquaintance. I observed how very
attentive Mr. Peterson was to Alice the whole'
evening; and whenever his thoughts wandered, as
I thought they did sometirifes wander, I felt satis-,
fled that he was thinking of starting a new Thes-
pian society.
"My friend," said Miss Watson to me that tiight
as we were seated together in her happy home,
"rn~ke up your mind in your love matters to act at
once; remember what Sardanapalus nays:~
"To what gujfs

And find it tilt they forfeit It themselves."
The proceeds of Miss Watson's heueflt were just
eighteen hundred and t~n dollars, The money, in
gold, was put in a beautiful purse, and Mrs. Crorap-
ton was s~ kind as to undertake the delicate duuty
of presenting it to her, which she did, as Mt~s
Watson told me, with all becoming graciousness.

Full of the e~citernent ol' success, arid the way-

with Alice, and the new impulses springing front

my intimacy with. Miss 'Watson, I attended a sup-
per given by our Thespian corps in honor of our
triumph. My brain was in a perfect, whirl. I
was possessed with such a spirit of restlessness
that I could not keep still a moment, and every
body was askitug me what was the matter for days
before our performance. The fact is, the excite~
mont of the circumstances by which I was ~tur~'
rounded was enough, without any extraneous ex~
excitement3 to throw me out of the even:tenor of my
way, had it ever been very even; but as it was,
our late suppers, dinners, and deep drinking, threw
me entirely off my balance, and the night of our
Thespian supper, above mentioned, I was little bet-
ter than one crazed. I was crazed, for I knew not
what I did or where I was.
Somebody says that the ~assiov~ for excitement is
a six sense. We smell, taste, feel, hear, see, and then
we have this passion for excitement, arid happy is
the man who can put mete~ and br~unds to it.
Legitimately aroused, it is time impulse which has
~hieved all the great deeds of the world. What

what I had done and what I had not done, until
~ fancy and fact were test together, and there
was scarcely a "fixed ~ in my memory. What
a terrible sensation all this produced. I awoke
about four o'clock in the morning and knew not
where I was. I gazed wildly round the room and
knew not of my locality. Presently a gentle foot-
step came to my bedside, and I asked who is it'?
where am I?
A gentle voice replied~
"'Tis I, Mr. Russell."~
"And who is I?" I asked.
"'I'is your friend, Maria ~
"~y God! Maria, am I in your house?"
"You are, 5j~*~~
"How came I here?"
"You came of you~'self, sir."
"Came of myself! Did I offer you any un~
civility?"
"No, indeed-but you are unwell-can I do

"Maria, I have been dissipating so much lately

"Indeed you have not, unless corning here be

"I know not-I know not-who brought me

wretched I am."
"That you must expect-you have been to~
much excited lately."
"Well, well, give me some more of that opiate,
and let me sleep awhile."
And awhile I did sleep, but it was only a little
while. I was soon awake and aroused to deeper
agonies.
"My dear Maria, but I ~m miserable, most mis-
erable-don't leav~ ~
"Mr. Russell, I do not mean to leave."
"I am sorrowful and forlorn-I do not know why
I should feel so."
"Why, it is natural, you have been under s1'
much excitement of late, and then your tempera-
ment is naturally one prone to the wildest, the
deepest excitement."
"My best friend, I wonder if Alice Clare know
it."                                       S
"I cannot tell, I fear to~ many of your fiends

and strange excitement of yours; several of your
friends have called to ask how you were."
"Did you let any of them see me. Wild, wild,.
don't I repeat myself a great deal. My God, 'but
I must have drank terribly~"
"Indeed you have, I have sent for three bottles
of brandy within these twenty-four hours, and you
have drank every drop of them."
"But how came I here?"
"Oh King! I have told you, but you must ral1y~

"Maria, I believe that fellow Peterson is head-

"1 should not wonder-you know her father

I HASTEN TO THE POTOMAC-JOHN5TONE '5 QUAR-

JOHNSTONE AND uoltsLEy-IIoRSLEy's RESENT-
MENT-THE RESULT.
I hurried to the Potomac establishment, and who
should I find there but Horsicy, Jim Jumper and
Johnstone, as excited as I was, though certainly
not possessed of such a spirit of wild and ungovern-
able melancholy.
They began instantly to joke me about the pret-
ty actress. Taking it as no joke I indignantly re-
p~lled their insinuations, which only made them-
in their excited condition-worse. I told Horaley
that I thought better of him.
"Hang your picture," said he, "I thought better
of you. Why, old fellow, you have been on the
tallest kind of a spree."
"My sprecing is my own look out," I replied.
~ he rejoined, "but you had better
look in, and ask yourself if you are doing right."
"What are you doing?" I asked.
"Doing-I am done f~'r-I am on a regular heat-
The old man and I have had it hip and thigh. I
have done myself the distinguished honor to quit
the parental roof. The ol~l gentleman heard I had
been on the stage, and without condescending to
ask me any questions he broke upon me, and I
~broke away from the lecture and the house to-
g~ther.~~
"Good !" exclaimed Jim Jumper, "I would
~have done that long ago."

"Yes," retorted Horsley, "you would do any-
thing that was lawless and rascally,~)
"Thank you, old Hoss, I would but hdve been
following your example," rejoined Jim Jumper.
"Good!" was the cry around the board.
"You'll follow any bad example set you," ex-
claimed Horsley. "Good examples are to you like
holy water to Satan; you shun them as soixiething
that is not in your vocation."
Tom Johostone, in his second representation of
Salemenes, had not been as successful as at ljrst,
and Mr. Tom was provoked threat. The fact
was, that he had had a quarrel with himself upon
the subject, the very worst person to quarrel with
in the ~vorld, as the world always says that it is a
just quarrel, and - that the individual is his owa
worst enemy. Tom, to use the fashionable phrase
of later days, had got "tight" on the occasion of
the last representation, and several times he not
only articulated his sentences with much thickness
of utterance, but twice he forgot his part entirely,
and the voice of Mr. Dc Crafts-the prompter..-.
was heard all over the house, reminding Mr. Sale-
ruenes, alias Mr. Tom Johnstone, of his forgotten
part. How Tom hated it! for he had acquitted
himself with much eclat upon the first represents..
tion, and the consequence was, that he had been
* drinking deep ever since the evening of Miss
Watson's benefit, by way of drowning his humili-
ation. Humiliation is a fish that can sometimes
swim in very deep waters, and like the ghost of
Banquo, will not down.
"Damn you," exclaimed Johnstone to Horaley,
"you talking of vocations; wh'~ gave you the au-
thority to order a second perfurmatice of the play?~~
"Authority! On my conscience, Salemenes, if I
had known that you would have made such an awful
failure in the part on its second representatiuu, I
would almost have seen myself in Tophet-aye, in
hell-before I would have suffered you to appear-
you ure a disgraced man
"You are a fool forever," retorted Johnston..
"A fool forever--you're a born fool, sir, and
therefore you are the one to whom the epithet
should apply of a fool forever. Johnstone, you
have no idea of what a granny you made of your.
self in your last appearance. Why, man, you began
tight, and you got tighter, and you concluded tight'

stage directions, you 'draw out the weapon from
the wound,' beat anything that I ever saw. You
must have had the colic-you could not have act-
ed it. How you twisted-I thought of having
you painted, and putting you in the museum as the
dying gladiator."
"Dying gladiator! You are a dying fool."
"Sir, you insult me-better, however, a live
dog than dead lion. What a fool you would have
been without me-nobody to keep you in counte-
nance, 'alone in your glory.' "
"Fool without you,~~ (how maudlin these fel-
lows were,) "I am a fool with you, and two fools
never made a wise man yet, did they?"
"I don't know, suppose you and Russell try it."
"No, you and ~
"Thank you, sir, I am not so great a fool as you
take me
"Well, I did take you for the greatest fool I
ever saw-1-the greatest-and if you have any thing
to say why judgment should not be rendered in the
premises, I pray you speak now or hold your peace
forever more."
"Hold my peace forever more; I have a great
mind to kick you."
"Kick mel Actions speak louder than words-
suppose you try it. There's a christening to your
courage if you can get anybody to stand sponsor,"
continued Horslcy in the calmest manner in the
world, throwing his glass of brandy and water full
in Johnstone's face.
Johnstone was a tall, fine looking fellow, weigh-
ing one hundred and eighty-four pounds. Horslcy
weighed one hundred and fifteen, and was delicate
and sickly, and certainly with the aid of another
of his size, Johnstone could have over matched
them. But Horsley was spunk all over. John-
stone sprang to his feet, and seizing a decanter was
about to hurl it at Horslcy's head, when I seized
him and said:

CHAPTER XX.
A DUEL ON THE CARPET-JUMPER AS SECOND-
SCaNS BETWEEN JUMPER AND MYSELF-JUMPER
SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS FROM THE SCENE-CAP-
TAIN MERRYMAN~BLADENSBURG-CONVERSA
TION WITH HORSLEY-MY PROMISE ABOUT MiSS
WATSON.
Johnstone's friend, no less a person and no
other than Mr. James Jumper, called on Horsicy
the next morning, and was by him referred to me.
Jumper was angry with me for certain remarks
which it was reported to him I had made with
regard to his proposing six cheers for me in the
theatre, but I had regarded his coldness with per-
fect indifference, which nettled him the more.
Jumper was full of the importance of being se-
cond in an affair of honor, and I nra satisfied that
if it were not for this feeling many duels would
have been amicably arranged which have had a
fatal termination. The eclat, without any risk, has
a great deal of fascination in it.
Jumper was very dignified when he called on
me. For the first time I believe in his life he
called rue Mr. Russell.
"Take a seat, Jjrnmy,~~ said I, handing him a
chair in Mrs. Watson's little parlor, for that lady
had insisted upon it that I should occupy her rooms
while I was sick, (she wanted me to marry her
daughter) and Miss Watson's company was so
agreeable that I never thought of declining.
"Take a seat, Jimmy," said I.
Jimmy looked dignified, and said he had waited
on me at the request of his friend, Mr. Johustons,
who had sent him to 1-loreley, who sent him to
inc.
%~Ji~my,~~ said I, "are you fond of fighting?"
"Never, Mr. Russell, but when my honor is

"Your honor concerned! Suppose I was to pull
your nose until it profusely bled, would you think
/
your honor concerned, or would you merely soap
your nose?"
"Mr. Russell, you and I are old friends. I am
sent here on the business of Mr. Johusrone."
"Mr. .Johnstone! Suppose I was to pull your
nose and kick you, what would you do?"
My readers must remember that all this time I
was under the strongest excitement, and what is
strange, I can remember such scenes much more
vividly than I can those of ordinary occurrences.
I mean generally I can, for sometimes I cannot re-
member anything that has occurred, or if I do,,
mine is like Cassio'~ memory after his excess.
"Well," said I, ".Mr. Jumper. I expect we'll
all have to fight. I feel like fighting; what say
you?~~
"I don't tbel like fighting, ~ Russell, but my
principal does."
"Hang your principal. My question is, will
you fight me? I feel like it."
"Mr. Russell," rejoined Mr. Jumper, "I have no
reason to fight with you."
"To fight with me! Suppose I say that John-
stone is not a gentleman, what will you do then, ac-
cording to the laws of the duello? You have got
yourself, Jumper, into an awful fix, and I have a
great mind to blow your brains out."
"Blow my brains out! Sir, Mr. Russell, I came
here peaceably.~~
"Came here peaceably! Why, you craven cow-
ard, you bring my friend a challenge-do you call
that peaceably. I have a great mind to kick you.
What would you say if I were to kick you-kick
you fearfully?"
"Mr. Russell, I am here for my friend, Mr.
Johnstone."
"Suppose yon are, sir, and suppose I chose to
kick you."
"Sir, Mr. Russell, you would 'not offer me such
an Qutr5gO.~~
"Outrage! if Johustone and Horeley fight.-you
know what a shot I am-I have pledged Horsley,
whatever the result my be, to kill you on the
spot."
"Kill mc on the spot! Sir, that would be
murder."


"I know it would, to look at it calmly, but I
tnean to kill you ht hot blood, and put in the plea
of insanity. By Jove, old fellow, I will walk
over your grave, not that I will plant flowers there,
but I shall contemplate your final resting place
with much satisfaction."
"1 ~m much obliged to you, sir," exclaimed
Jumper, who seemed to think that the plea of in-
sanity was good in the premises.
"Obliged to me-a bullet in your brains certainly
confers a great obligation on the head where such a
substance finds a lodgment-
"Ashes to dabes, why not lead to lead?"
"Jumper. Horsley is my friend. This business
must be settled-must be. Johnstone is a good
shot, so am I, better than you are. It is the fool-
ishness of intoxication, and I do not mean to let it
end in murder. Not a bit of it. Horslcy is a pe-
culiar man, very; it is his temperament, his nature,
and he is as brave as Cmsar-I don't doubt John-
stoue's courage-it's a foolish affair."
"I think so myself," said Jumper.
"Then let's end it-you have Johastone's char-
acter in your hands."
"Hang ~ exclaimed Jumper, "but you
know what a stubborn fellow he is. But I will go
and see him," and so speaking, and before I could
make any reply, Jumper hastily withdrew.
The next morning who should call on me but
Captain Merryman, of the Navy, a regular fire
eater, who said that Mr. .Jumper had suddenly left
town on pressing business, and that hi 4 friend,
Mr. Johustone, had called on him to ask him to
see me in the unfortunate and delicate affair be-
tween himself and Mr. Horsley.
"I am sorry to say to you, Mr. Russell," he
continued, "that unless an unqualified and ample
apology is made by Mr. Horsley, a meeting must
be had between them."
He handed me Mr. Johnstone's note, which ran
explicitly to that effect. It was most peremptory.
I koew that Horeley would not apologize, for he
had told me so, and [knew the fighting propensi
ties ef iVierryman, so all I could do was to arrange
a meeting three days thereafter near Bladensburg.
When we got to Bladensburg we found at the
hotel, where, we stopped, that .Johnstone and Capt.

Merrymart had got there before us, and had gone
on to Washington.
In conversation, floreley told me that he meant
to fire in the air, and see thereafter if the matter
could not besettled. We went to his room.
"I have never had, as you know, ~ said
he, "an affair of honor, and as I do not feel, 50 1
must not show the shadow of a shade of the white
feather."
"The terms ~ said I, "as you know, ten
paces with pistols. One, two, three, fire, and to
fire at any time between one and the word. When
we get on the ground and toss up for the word, if I
get it I shalt give it very deliberately; so--one--
two-three-fire. 1 suspect Johustone, who is a
good shot, very good, will fire quickly, and that
is your chance. But, Horsicy, don't you think
that you ought to fire at him'?-it's throwing your
life away.'?
"Well, it ain't worth much, still I have no
desire to die, yet I have a presentiment of that
"But hang presenitments, they are like old wo-
men's dreams, foregone conclusions upon fixed facts,
'Cowards die many deaths, the brave but once.'
"But you had better, Russell, go on to the cap-
itol, and get the physician to whom we were re-
commended. I should hate, if I get a limb broken,
to have it badly set and limp for life. You can
just write him a note if you do not feel like going.
Now, my friend, I should like to be left alone; I
have some letters to write and other matters to at-
tend to. if you stay all night in Washington, don't
fail to be out here early. Wake me, should I be
asleep, for I may be up late writing, and, when I
fall to sleep, sleep longer than is my wont. Take
every explanation, my dear friend, should I fall, to
my father. Do your best, Russell-practice your
utmost address to relieve his feelings. The old
gentleman's religious notions will be terribly shock-
ed-maybe he will congratulate himself that I am
gone and out of sin's way for the future. Russell.
there's one thing I want you to promise me."
"It is promised," I replied, "what is it'?"
"The a~tress-that beautiful and most gifted crea-
ture, Miss Watson,"
"She can take care of herself," I said.

I

"Yes, but you shall not evade it. Promise me that I am a man of courage, when I would show
in the emphatic word that you will not wrong much more courage by defying its law of honor and
her."                                        resting upon the law of God."

I know not why-I entertained no design of such
a character against Miss Watson, yet I hesitated.
Alas, I fear my owe. heart recoiled upon itself at
having a promise fixed there to a friend who
might be no more to-morrow-when I did not
know what that to-morrow-what the future
might bring to me and others in the wild career of
human passions that seemed bursting on me in my
opening manhood.
"Will you not promise me, Russell'?" exclaimed
Horslcy, in tones that startled me, "shall I leave
life to-morrow, and with it the only faith that I
have ever had in any man's friendship?"
"But, my dear Horslcy, this is not friendship, it
is all nonsense. What has Miss Watson to do
with any friendship between you and me'?"
"Nothing, only I want you to pledge me upon
the faith of that friendship that you will not wrong
her."
"Horaley, my friend," I exclaimed, "you are
morbid-indeed you are. What has any little
matter that is-"
"Russell, that is a foul insinuation."
I laughed, though I felt annoyed.
"Well, really Horslcy, what are you driving at.'
"Russell, you know how long we have been
friends. I know I am about to do a foolish act to-
morrow, because the world and the world's law
require it, and I have not courage enough to suf-
fer under the imputation of the want of courage.~~
"Have you not? [ should have thought, from
my knowledge of your character, that you had,"
"Well, be satisfied, I have not. I am like the
Roman Lucretia; she suffered herself to be used
and abused by Tnrquin, rather than have the inn-
puration-though she should die in her purity-
rest upon her memory, that she had been used by
her slave and was slain in his arms. A christian
woman would have died in the pride of her purity
-less, a Jewish maiden would so have died.
Scott's Rebecca, for instance. No, sir, Lucretia
was prouder of the reputation of her chastity than
~he was of her chastity itself. So I am going to

"Well, but Horsley, if you have such conscien-
tious compunction against duelling, why should
you fight?"
"Sir," said Horsicy, "would you have me com-
promise my honor?"
'Indeed I would not-~.-but if you have done
wrong, why not apologize?"
"Apologize, and at this point of the game? No,
I shall not apologize. Russell, this is trifling I
came here to meet .Johnstone and give him gentle-
manly satisfaction, and I have no other desire,
though I want you to repeat this conversation to
my father, and that- will let him know that I am
not altogether recreant to the principles of my
education,"
"I feel that, my friend; be assured, should the
event you anticipate occur, which I don't believe
will, I will certainly say all to your father that I
can to reconcile him to it."
"It is strange how often my old friend Beazely
has bech in my mind- of late. He would have
justified me, Russell."
"I have, no doubt he would," I replied, but I
had many doubts, as doubtless my readers have.
I understood Horsl es's feelings exactly. In a just
cause no man would go further than would he,
and he would have given anything if such were
the case now. Lie was trying to reconcile himself
to himself. a very fruitless effort sometimes.
"Let me repeat to you, Russell," he remarked,
"in the account you give of this affair to the old
gentleman, save his feelings all you can. And
now promise me on your honor, that you will neith-
er entertain nor practice any evil designs upon Miss
Watson, and then leave me."
"I promise you," I said solemnly, giving him
my hand; "strange that I should quarrel with you
fellows in the Potomac for such an insinuation,
now you should be so anxious to get me to and that
promise that I would not attempt to do the very
thing I got angry with you for insinuating that I
had the intention of doing."
~~Enough,~~ said liorslcy, "we have high au-
thority for knowing that the heart of man is deceit-
ful and wicked above all things. But your word

"Stop, Horsley, for God's sake--do you know how
yon tempt a man when you t61i him that a woman
likes him-how you tempt him to seek to err if
that ~voman be not in his sphere of life?"
"As to what you call sphere of life, Russell, I
don't very particularly regard between the sexes,
for I would marry any woman who was respect a-
ble, whom I loved. But the night wears, my
friend, and I must write some letters."
I left Horsley, and obtaining a horse from my
landlord, I took the road for Washington. By way
ofrehef to my feelings, which were not of the hap-
piest, and to my reflections, which were not at all
of a complimentary cast to myself, I put my horse
to his mettle, and dashed rapidly on.

Arrived at Washington, I inquired the way to

learning the residence of l)r. Lock we A I repaired
thither and found the Doctor at home. I explain

"Cannot this affair be settled, Mr. Russelt," he
asked of irue.

no acquniniance tO the city, I t~r~ed my steps to
the capitol grounds, which I htol miuderstonut were

highly cultivated. On visiting a strange city, one
is attracted first to the scene which he had heard
most of therein, and being laden with gloomy re-
flections and presemitiments, it was natural that I
should stray thitherward. I must confess I had
gloomy forebodings of the fate of my friend. John
stone was of a reckless and revengeful disposition.
and Merryman I knew was too fond of being in
his element, a duel, willingly to get out of' it with-
out bloodshed. Horsicy I loved more than a
brother, but he was of so 0(1(1 and strange a nature
that I did not know, to use a western phrase,
which way the stick would break with him. his

different to me-the one who looked on me in my
very childhood with so much tenderness and pride.
While I was contemplating all this in her charac-
ter, between me and the light of her beautiful
nature came the dark form of Booth; and while I
was trying to scrutinize his conduct towards her,
and recalled their being together at the deer oak,
ray attention was arrested keenly by voices near
me.. I was in the deep shadow of a large tree,
reclining on one of the numerous seats which have
been placed in the public grounds, and I was con-
scions that I must be entirely unseen, even though
an observer but a few feet off was trying to scruti -
nize my locality. One of the persons, for there
were two of theni approaching, whom I recognized
in a moment by his Voice as Johustone, sai(l:
"Captain Merryman, I am detern~ined to have

nity to me will cost him his life; he is one of your

life just as you feel in the humor. I could do
either, I am satisfied, for I am a tolerable shot.
To-morrow morning early we'll practice a little.

"Practice a little," 1 thought to myself, "what
a green horn I am, never to have thought of

inyscW in remembering that I had heard Horsisy
say that if he ever was engaged in a duel, he would
never think of practicing, for it would see'~s like
n~alice aforethought, and morally eonstit~'te mur-

thair highest point of physical power. .Just so it
might be in duelling; I have often thought of it. In
fact, I always train myself on such occasions, and
it has enabled me three several times to drop my
man without my receiving so much as a scratch.
To be sure Plumboy~s ball went through my
pants near the ankle, but his pistol went off in the
spasmodic itimp which he gave as my bullet
struck him mortally. I'd bet a thousand dollars
on it, sir, if the truth could be ascertained, that he
was stone (lead before his bullet reached me, for
mine struck him directly in the hea4. I had prac-
tie~d, Mr. Johnstone, I had practiced at a figure-
I have an accurate eye-the very size of Plureboy,
which I made myself, and I marked out a heart on
it just where Plumboy's heart should be, and
by - I used to put my bullet in the centre of
It every elip. Mr. Johnston, the thing had he-
enme so much a habit with me that I could not
have missed it had I been blind fi~ldcd. The
papers made a furious noise about it, you remem-

saluted him, and said with pleasure, far I was just
thinking of taking a night cap, and turning to Mr.
Johastone I remarked it was a beautif~il night, and
asked if they had been walking?
Johastone was quite confused, and seemed eu-
dently at a loss to know whether I had overheard
his lemonade resolution or nat.
"What did you say you'd take, sir?" inquired
the bar keeper of Johnstone.
This reassured Itim, for he seemed to reflect that
if the bar keeper had not heard him order lemonade,
I, who was much farther off, could not have over-
heard him, and he replied:
"I said I would take lemonade with the privi-
lege-make it a punch at once-give me the palo
brandy-when I help myself and pour in on the
lemonade I always give myself an overdose, as I
judge the quantity oy the color, and your pale
brandy is as pale as the lemonade itself."
It instantly occurred to me that Mr. Johnstone
was an~cious to bear himself as if he did not think
of the business of the morrow, and I thought I
would get theum both drunk if I could, if it cost
me a fiend ache in the meriting' and a week's drink-
ing to taper off. Xler~ynman had the reputation of'
loving his cups, and the training which he had
been boasting of, which he had compelled himself
to undergo, I stispected at the time, was needful -
now-a-tlays with him to restore the former accura-
cy of his aim, for which Ito was celebrated. 'rIte
(ICairO to see Johnstone drunk that night had flash-
ed through niy mind from the very moment I heard
him give his reason for drinking lemonade only. I
ordered brandy and water, helped myself and took
a ~tromtg pull.

rather deeply, amid .Johnstotme taking this titime l)ale

''Alt, bar keeper," Ito t~xciaittiod, "this is the

is the prince of landlords, he always keeps good
liquor; whet' he was in our city he kept the best
there. I believe my taste was acquired at his
bar."
"We always try to keep the best, sir," remarked
the bar keeper, and before our supper was announc-
ed as ready, that individual had helped us all
again at the instance of Mr. Johnstone, who swore
we should all now drink with him.
At supper we ate very heartily, and various
kinds of wines were ordered in. 1 cotild plainly
see that both gentlemen, and particularly John-
stone, were determined to make the impression on
my mind that they had forgotten the anticipated
meeting in the morning. And I was determined
to be just as forgetful as they were. In fact Cap-
tain Merryman did soon actually forget it, and as
he was to run no risk and had no ~training~~ to
undergo himself, he soon forgot all about training
his principal. We drank bottle after bottle of
champagne, and by a strong exercise of the will,
though seemingly as far gone as either of my com-
panions, I kept myself "right side up with care"
all the time, as is written on the boxes which con-
tain glass. Reflecting on die superscription on he
boxes aforesaid, and that tlmose who live in glass
houses should not throw stones, and furthermore,
impressed with the dangerous position of my friend
Horaley, I dId nothing to mar the eonvivktlity of'
the evening, bitt all I could to advatice amid contin-
ue it, by way of testing ~ nerves, while
Merryman more than once talked tipon topics likely
to make his companion drink deeper. Merryman

three several times. I'll leave it to Mr. Russell."
Mr. Russell not being at all disposed to become
a peace maker on the occasion, replied that "he
was so busy with his own part when on the stage
that he had no time to think of others, and that
when not on, he was in the green room waiting his
call; though," I said, "that I thought Mr. John-
stone had acquitted himself remarkably to his
credit, and so I believed thought the public."
"That aint the point," said Merryintin. "I
don't care that about the public-they have found
fault with me when I should have been praised
and praised me when I should have been censured
-but the paint is, can a mart miss his part again

Captain ~erryman,~~ exclaimed Johnstone,
"I tell you that I (lid not miss my part," and as
he pushed himself back in an energetic effort to
strike the table with more force, his chair slipped
from the equilibrium of its hind legs, on which he
was ballancing himself, and its occupant tumbled
over with great force, striking the baca ~f his head
on the floor, after a manner that made him "see
the stars." I have no doubt I could have caught
him, btit it was not part of my syste'~u for the

Johustone, ~'d you nean to insult roe."
"I have done it, sir, 1 take it, if you know wilat

threatening attitude of Johustone, who advanced
towards him with clenched fist-Merryman con-
ttnued with sudden cahaness, "you know my

,Johnstone was about to reply, when several gen
tlemen entered, for we wcre itt tt~e dining room,
and Merryman said, in a subdued tone, for his
passion seemed somewhat to Itave sobered hito:
"This is no place for controversy: to-luorrov.,

and the renowned duellist left the roont.
Johostone looked at me for a nIolItent as if about

Merryman, artd evidently much en raged.

OTHES.
1 thought a moment with some self satisf~etion
over the scene which had just occuffed, wonder-
ing what would he the upshot of the matter, and
whether Johnstone would challenge Merryman and
light htrn before he met ilorsley, and thus in all
probably prevent their meeting, or whether they
would eousider the affair as the emanation of s
drunken frolic and be friends in the morning; and
so occupied, mentally, I retired to my room, leav-
ing orders at the i~ar that I was to be calle at five
o'elO(k, and .vislied to have my horse in readiness.
At first I thought I had better ride out to Bladena-
burg and tell l4orsley of all that had passed; then
it occurred to me it would be of no use, and 1 had
also a great desire to remain in the city that I
might l~arn the result of matters between the prin-
cipal and his second in the morning.
I was edld according to order early in the
morning, and the first tortes which saluted my ear
after tie negro's rap, was the voice of his ac
quaintance, the hoot black, who ~vas engaged in
his Ycotioo at the ind of the passage, and ~vh6 said:
"I eay, Saut."
''Well,'' said 8a111.
"1 say, these here geotlentans what Wears these

"Why (10, darkey?" asked Sam.

on their boots, you may be sure, Cokely, you'll

"Old boy," exclaimed Cokely, in a tone of
admiration of his advice, "you've been here so
long you is a kind of up to every thing and down to
eVery thing; but I tell you this child is getting Ilis
eye skinned very fast, he is, he! he! he's cutting
his eye tooth, he is."
When I descended to the bar, I asked the bar
keeper if the gentlemen who were with me last
nigltt had left yet?
"About a quarter of an hour ago," he replied.
"Did they go together?"
'0! yes, sir, they made friends after tileir fuss
last night, and they went off in a fast carriage a
quarter of an hour ago."
"Made friends-did they take a drink together?"
"Oh yes, sir, and Captain t4crrymnan asked for

Russell."

As I entered Bladensburg I saw a horseman
by the woodside just where you enter from Wash-

had the look of a- right to do it, said:

"Not a moment," I replied, "business presses

"BIll I've got a right," said he, "and I corn

on horseback, who were behind a bush beside the
road, and whom I had not seen, advanced. I
stopped and asked them what they meant?
"Ain't your name liorsicy?" ask~~ my first in~-

I stopped the negro and told him II wished

tavern keeper, and asked him if he would carry
if I paid him well for it.
"I won't do anything else master, sartain, for
lives dar," replied the African, delighted at th
reward.
I felt in vain in my pockets for a scrap of paper
I had none.
"Gentlemen," said I, turning to my attendants
"I want a bit of paper on which to write a noti
to my landlord about my baggage in Bladensburg
have you a bit of blank paper about you."
"If you say it is riot to let your second knovi
anything of the matter, certainly," said Captair
Wilson, who was the person who arrested me, and
who commanded the party.
"I have no second in my matters yet, gentle-
men, I assure you,~~ said I, glad of the chance of
a prevarication, which looked free of falsehood,
though evidently it was meant to deceive, and
therefore was not so pure as might be.
The leaf of a letter, blank all but its superscrip-
tion, for there did not exist then the universal
system of envelopes, was handed to me by:Captain
Wilsonand in a very careless way, on the top of
my hat, I wrote a hasty note to Horsley. I gave
it to the boy and told him aside to ask the landlord
of th~ hotel to have it sent with the note to the
room of the gentleman to whom it was directed.
"No," said I, ~ as a brighter thought
struck me. "There"-giving him Horsicy's di-
rection on a piece of paper-"ask the landlord to
show you to that gentleman's room, and when you
see the gentleman give hi1n that note. Do you
hear'?"
"Yes, ~ and he hesitated.
"Ah, and here's a dollar for y~u; tell the gentle-
man when you give him the note that I said he
twist give you another dollar."
"What brought your name be, master?"
"I-Iorsley-Mr. Horsley-arid when you see
me again I'll give you another ~
"Whar does you think 1 shall see you, was
ter?"

iy "In Bladensburg, to-morrow; don't forget I

The blackey's eyes goggled at the idea of his
,o forgetting it, and then he ha-hawed right out, as
y the humor of the thing struck him, and he started,
t off briskly on his way, holding his dollar in his
clenched fist as if he meant to feel that it was safe.
I   The negro was not out of sight, when who
e should our cavalcade meet but the carriage con-
taining .Johnstone and his friend the captain. They
were evidently taking it leisurely, under the cap-
tain's directions. To be in a hurry even to show
one's courage would not haye been cool enough for
~ the gallant captain. They evidently were talking
very pleasantly, the captain appeared anecdotical,
for .Johnstone laughed loud at something or other
his companion was telling, though there was some-
thing in the ring of his laugh which was not all
merriment.
As we advanced to the side of the carriage I
- could see Johnstone in the act of relighting his
cigar, which had gone out, maybe during his hearty
laugh. Jolinstone was laying back apparently at
his ease, while Merryman was evidently so, for
his feet were protruded voluptuously on the seat in
front of him, and he was pleasantly watching the
escape of the smoke from his lips, which he had
retained there for his amusement, while Johnstone
relighted his cigar.
Johastone was the first to see me, and he bolted
into an upright position and unconsciously repeated
my name:
"Mr. Russell!"
The officers started and looked at each other,
while I, without seeming to notice them, said:
"Horslcy, if you please, sir."
"Ha, Mr. Horslcy," exclaimed Captain Merry-
man, with a coolness which reminded me of
Peterson's at our first juvenile rivalry in recitation,
"ab, glad to see you, sir; we are on a little gunning
excursion after wild fowl, we trust that the game
is not scared offi"
"Scared off!" I exclaimed, losing for a moment
my self' possession, and about to utter that which
might have betrayed the real state of the case,
"0! no, sir, I'~~ left game enough there for you
yet-at least for a shot or two."
The officers of the law whispered apart and

9

looked suspicious, but said nothing, while the car-
riage, the driver of which had slackened his horses
to a walk during our short colloquy, now started
into a quicker pace.
"One moment, captain, let me say a word to
you," I called out, when the carriage had passed
out of hearing of the officers.
"Excuse me a moment, gentlemen," I said to
Captain Wilson and his party, and imitating the
coolness of Captain Merryrnan, I rode up to his
carriage, and told him, in a low tone, that I had
been arrested in mistake for Horsley, and that I
would not undeceive the officers until I heard from
i-Iorsley.
"I have sent a black boy with a note to my friend
explaining matters, Captain Merryman."
"It's a mere circumstance, sir," replied the gal-
lant Captain, "a mere circumstance. Your friend
is our man, sir. Pardon me, sir, I say it as a
matter of congratulation, not of reproach; your
friend will find some one more familiar with these
matters than you are."
I felt my cheek tinge at his matter of conirratu-
lation, which was meant for insult, and replied:
"Yes, you are right, captain, religious people
call these matters murders, as you know, (he had
been called repeatedly a murderer in the j)apers) but
you gentlemen who perpetrate them in an honora-
ble way, think nothing of' them, though morally,
as second, if you cause a death you are as much of
a murderer as though you~were the principal."
"Ha, ha, quite sevc.me, sir. Doubtless your ar-
rest has then relieved you h~oin anxiety. But, sir,
we must hasten on," and he raised his hat and told
the boy 'to drive on.' I raised mine also and felt
very much like flinging it in his face, at the same
time I doubted very much whether I had spoken
in good taste.
I could not but smile, however, as I joined Cap-
tain Wilson and his companions, to mark how
moucil their suspicion of something wnng was~
aroused, and 110W completely they were at fault
a- to the existing state of things.

-A DUEL THE CONSEQUENCE-WILSON '5 REASONS FOE
1115 DUEL-SUDDEN ANI) UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTION.
Not meaning to~commit myself any fotl~r in
deception than was necessary to accomplish my
purpose, (the way with most deceivers, by the
bye,) and perchance fearing that something I might
let slip might betray me, I said nothing to my ar-
resters upon the subject of my arrest. In fact they
had deceived themselves in their eagerness to ar-
rest Horsicy, betraying themselves to me in a way
which I thought justified me in playing Elorsley,
for the sake of the honor of my friend. Yet as we
rode along, several times it occurred to me that I
bad better tell Captain Wilson who I was, and
without advising him to do so, contrive that he
should return to Bladenshurg and arrest Ilorsley,
for when I reflected upon Merryman's coolness and
the aid his previous knowledge of duelling matters

my friend, who I had no donot would easily get
another secon(l. But I said to myself I am bound
to guard the honor of Horsicy, who has l)tlt his
trust in Toe, and I asked Captain Wilson:
"Have you made many arrests aftcr this fashion,
sir?"
"Why yes, sir--but not so many as formerly
sAving your preserlee, sir, the thing~~ not as fluili-
joriable as it used to he. Members of Congress
ain't as high flown as they used to be-they dun't
stand o4 pints as they used to--though when we
get some of the Southern liotspurs here, they are
very bilious towards Northern men, and flares up
easily."
"I fave you witnessed mimany duels'?" I asked.
~ you think th~ sw~onds eoull generally
settle it?"
"Almost always. sir, except in a case like that
of Burr and I larnilton, when Burr was hound to
fight. lie was all fitrht, -sir game all over-Ifam-
ilton knowed jt-J have always thought he knowed
that Burr meant to kill hits, and he kind of pre

pared himself for it. He said duelling waswrong,
but he couldn't stand the public opinion."
"I remember," I replied, "reading the corres-
pondence between Burr and Hamilton-I agree
with you-I always thought that Hamilton antici-
pated his fate."
"Yes, sir," replied Captain Wilson, "and there-
fore two men so notoriously brave to go out to
prove their courage, strikes me as great foolishness.
Saving your presence, it's a very foolish business
any how."
"Yes, it is a very foolish business any how, but
yet two such wise men as Burr and Hamilton
fought, to say nothing of a thousand others as wise

me to be on the ground. The colonel thought it
would be a Street fight-he had pluck and pre.
pared himself accordingly-but the doctor said that
if lie had introduced the colonel to his wife, and
~ut confidence in him and given him in that way
endorsement in his family, he would have shot him
down like a dog, but that was not the thing; the
lady was the colonel's casual acquaintance, !made
at a ball, and she had encouraged his attentions
from the first."
"Hair-splitting casuistry," I said.
'Well, I don't know, sir, but so said the doc-
tor. The colonel," he said, "ought to have re~
spected his honor, be the lady what she might, but

and as brave."                                the colonel had not violated his friendship or be-

"Yes, sir! About the keenest I ever saw  was   "Ah, so the doctor thought it was a fair field,
between two gentlemen in the North state, that is, was it, when the colonel eloped with his lady?"
North Carolina~-one of them was from South Car-  "Can't say, sir; you have me there. My notions

the married man was bent on vengeance. Maybe "You have experience of the sex, Captain Wil-

arm, glanced and went into his heart. As the
doctor fell over, for I was near h~m and saw the
expression of hi~ eye, he kind of kicked his arm
up with his knee-mind I saw it-and off went
his pistol. The colonel never kicked afterwards.
The doctor fell, rested on his left arm, looked stern
at the colonel, and when he saw he was dead, he
stretched himself out, and died a kind of content-
edly as I thought. He had hit the colonel plum
in the head, and it was the doctor's opiniou it was
done after the doctor was hit in the heart, for they
probed the wound and found the bullet in his
heart. You look unbelieving."
"Why, no, it is said of General Jackson," I re-
plied, "that he was wounded by his antagonist,
and did not know it until after he had killed him
and he was leaving the ground with one of his
seconds, who showed him the marks of blood on
his clothes. Sir, said the general, as he examined
the wound, I should have killed him, sir; I had
made up my mind: I should have killed him if his
bullet had gone into my brain. It's merely show-
ing what resolution will do."
"Fact, sir," replied Captain Wilson," ha! ha!
I heard tell on a fellow that went away up en the
V~ellow Stone a hunting with a Frenchman. They
left their canoe-the American and the French-
man did-on the new banks, and they went two
days travel into the wilderness, when one day an-
beknowns-"
"Where are you from?" said I, struck with his
pronunciation.
"Why I'm from everywhere, but I was born
in Tennessee, got a place here from the Mayor
and City Council appointments," winking hard
at me, "though I'm in general politics, not the
right side up either. But as I was saying, unbe-
knowus to him, the American, he falls into a fight
with a barr and the animal tears him a~vfully-
however, he happens to give him a mortal dig at
last with his knife and laW Mr. Bruin out. There's
a good many kind of di ~ls: some is fashionable
and some is unfashionable, but the American's was
in an awful case."
"Most brutally treated," I interposed.
"Yes, sir, bearishly, but that ain't the ~vorst of it
nor the best of it. The Frenchman carried his
friend on his back, after he had helped him to dress

his wounds, the better part of the day, towards
the river where the canoe was, and there being
more than a day~s travel to reach the canoe, he
concluded-the Frenchman did-that he could'nt
take the American-he was a Tennesseean-any
further, so he put him down."
"What, left him!" I exclaimed.
"He put him down, but the American reasoned
with him and begged that he would no~ leave him*
to die there. The Frenchman said he would have
to do it, as Indians were on their track, and he
started to leave. The American begged him for
God's sake to load his rifle for him and leave it by
his side; yon know, says he, I can u~e one hand,
and maybe it may save my life from Indians, or
get me some game. Just load me my rifle-~if my
bruised legs won't let me walk, I can crawl, maybe
after awhile. Just leave my bowie knife too,
near by in trim. 'So to this the Frenchman consent-
ed, glad to make some kind of excuse to himself
for nor deserting his friend without some hope for
him, and he accordingly loaded his rifle, placed it
by him, and took an affectionate leave of Monsieur
friend, the American, but the American couldn't
stand it, so lie made one desperate effort, raised
his rifle, and said to the Freriichman, promise to
take me on your back to the canoe or I'll shoot
you on the spot. That was a dead fall to the
Frenchman, I tell you. He had to do it. He
took the American on his back, with the American
holding the bowie knife right at his throat all the
way to the canoe. When they got there the
American made Monsieur Frog seat him in the
canoe, and he held a bee line on him with his rifle
till the Frenchman paddled him all the way to the
settlements."
I could not but laugh heartily at the story, and
I thought Captain Wilson was certainly a green
chap for the captain of the watch of the metropo-
lis of the nation, but then I reflected that politics,
like poverty, makes us acquainted with strange
bed fellows, and I concluded that under some hocus
pocus or other of political transmutation, the cap-
tain was where he was. He seemed infinitely
more disposed to talk than at first, and I began to
think how much I had been mistaken in his charac-
ter in taking him, its I did, for a sedate personage.
"That was'nt all of it," he continued, after a


68

pause. "The Frenchman, when he afterwards
met the American in St. Louis, challenged him, I
was informed, and they went out and faught on
Bloody Island, and the American served him worse
than the bear served the American himself, for he
shot his nose off, and it's a~vful to hear a French-
man speak broken English through a brokeui nose?'
I could not but laugh heartily at this.
"The joke of it was that the Frenchman had told
how he had helped the American all through
friendship and politeness, and the American had
contradicted the story. The American said he
rode him like the man of the mountain rode Sin-
bad the sailor, or Sinbad the sailor rode the man
of the mountain, I forget which."
~ strange," said I, "that the Frenchman did
not refuse at first outright."
"Why, he would have got killed outright."
"Well, but it occurs to me, he, in the long
time the American was on his back, or while
they were in the boat, might have got rid of
him, or got away from hire."
"Ah, the American was holding on for his life,
and he had the Frenchman under cow."
"That's true."
"True, it's everything-when you get a fellow
under cow he's gone. There ain't nothing left of
him but fever and ague. The Frenchman was so
laughed at when the story got told 'round that he
grew as brave as a lion, and wanted to fiuht after
he had his nose shot off, but his seconds wouldn't
let him."
"You believe the story,~~ I said.
"Why not? it's as good a story as the next one,
and first rate grounds for a dueWain't it. If that
ain't putting upon a man I don't know. It was
one hundred and sixty pounds of human nature,
and the Frenchman was small at that-his consti-
tution, like his character, never recovered.
~ said I to myself, "the character of
Captain Wilson, like the unfolding of some
curious toy, is opening out."
"You would not, 1 suppose, Mr. 1-lorslcy, now,
considering my present position, take rue for an
arusrocrat, would you?"
"Why not?" I asked.
"Why nut? hecause appearances are against me
-hut I am an aruntocrat -.1 am descended from

one of the F. F. V.-one of the first families in
Virginia."
"Yes, sir, fact, one of the first families in Vir-
ginia. I am descended from the Monboddoes.
You've hearn tell of Lord Mouboddo, who wrote
a book to prove that men were monkeys all but the
tails?"
"Yes," I replied, smiling.
"Well, sir, I am descended from that family-
I'm one of the tails. We changed our names to
Wilson in the revolutionary war by act of the le-
gislature, because the old branch took the tory side.
But talking about duels, my family pride like to
have cost me my life-it did cost me a duel.".
"Yes, sir-the Wilsons, my ancestors, emigrated
to Tennessee, disgusted' with the toryism of their
ancestors, and though we hated the tory notions of
the old branch, we were proud of the blood. Well,
I had some little money in my younger days and
so I went down to New Orleans, a good looking
fellow, though I say it myself, just six foot in my
stocking feet, and well proportioned, and about the
best blood in my veins, if you were there just to
analyse it, as far as healthy blood goes, tn-the
country, and as far as family goes, the best blood
on top of the ground throughout the States. Do yqu
know, Mr. elorsley, where the best mint in the
world growsI~
"No," I said, wondering what was coming next.
"Well, it grows in the grave yards of old Vir-
ginay-it grows our of the best blood too, of the
old families, in consequence of their drinking so
many mint tulips, and it sprouts spontaneous!"
"It does?"
"Yes, sir, and I can prove it any day in any of
the old Episcopal grave yards in old Vmrginav."
"But the duel," I said, and as we rode side by
side, the others in the rear, tho captain talked on
in the glibest fhsbion, our horses' hoofs making bait
very little inte~ruptiou as they fell on the unpaved
road.
"Well, sir, I was (lown in New Orleans, and in

said I to myself, that pocket full of rocks she has!
I thought thus while I was taking my julip, mean-

was earning. When I get' back, tiere was a taIl

soft nonsense in a way that absolutely frightened
me-i was terrified-I sa~ the thing was op with

him directly over the head of the animal, while
his spectacles, hat and wig flew off, and he went
into a sand bank head foremost up to his chin.
The poor gentleman struggled there with hands
and feet very much like an adv~~irous swimmer
who has gone out too far to sea, and who, in his
mortal agony, is going down with his eyes, nose,

throw myself from my horse, and with the assis-
tance of Captain Wilson, dragged the old gentle-
man oot, and pot him upon his feet. The captain
then turned to catch the horse, and I drew forth

"There's a mistake," exclaimed Wilson at last,
"this is not your son?"
"~y cost no, sir, this is William Russell-the
individual who has got my son into all his diffi-
culties~-seduced him into the profanity of play

angry, half beseeching tone.
"Captain Wilson, then I am no longer your
prisoner," I said.
"No, sir," he replied, looking foolish.
"Then, sir, I have my action of false imprison-
ment against you, and you shall hear from me,
sir," and I turned my ~ head towards Bla-

"Stop, Mr. Russell," called out Horslcy, Sr.,

"I don't know you, sir-I won't say mend your

your manners, and if your son's slain, sir, do not

than any man 1 know, has been the cas~e of all

quoted plays to the old man on purpose) 'to your

mere outside-that it is a natural and not an ac-
quired habit, caught at 'conventicle'-that it is in-
grained and born of your cold, selfish and sordid
nature. If it were not for the purity of his mother,
whom he loved so much, and whom the late la-
mented Mr. Beazely respected so much and talked
of so often with over flowing eyes, I should be
willing to swear that you were not his father. It
is proper for rue now, sir, to inform you, if he has

often misquoted, by quoting it aright and applying
it aright. I do it, sir, to heap the living coals

better put it on-get to your false covering again
-you have shown your denuded head as you have
shown a momentary spark of feeling for your son,
very unexpectedly to yourself and much to the
surprise of others. Get to your false covering
again, or rather I should advise you, bare-headed
and bare-hearted, and bad-hearted, (I liked that al-
literation, and irave it effectively, emphasizing both
the words 'bare,' and uprising in tone with a low-
ering brow upon 'bad,') as you are, get down on
your knees while it is to-day, for it will soon be
night with you, old man, and pray God to give you
grace to mend your conduct to your noble son."
I certainly thought myself not only histrionic
but decidedly oratorical, when I delivered this ex-
temporaneous reproof and exhortation to Horslcy,
Sr. It runs as glibly from my pen as I record it
-I remember it so distinctly-as it came from my
tongue when I pronounced it. I held through my
kimboed left arm the loosened rein of my horse,
whose head I had turned towards Bladensburg,
when about to leave the party, and outstretched
the other with my riding whip in hand, in a man-
ner which. I confess, I took the hint of from what
I h d rend of John Randolph and seen of him in
the prints-a manner appropriate to a moral cas-
tigation illustrated by the position of inflicting a
physical one-and I made the very wavy point of
that delicate riding whip tell on the old man. To
say the truth I felt very much like obeying Ham-
~ advice to the players, "suiting the action to
the word," and I never felt before so truthfully the
force of the Athenian's remark, when in answer to
the question as to what constituted oratory, he re-
plied, three things:
"Action-Action-Action."
Then Mark Antony's disclaimer over C~sar,
that he, Antony, had
"Neither wit nor worlds nor worth,
Action nor utterance, nor the power or speech
To stir men's blood,"
occurred if) me, and 1 thought I had them even
better than the Roman, and particularly the
"power to stir men's blood," as I marked how

WILLIAP
well I made the very point-the delicate tracery of
the tip end of my riding whip-illustrate the glori-
ous action of oratory.
We formed a tableau decidedly. 1 thought of
it at the time. First, I was the chief figure on
horseback, with the outstretched riding whip, ut-
tering those
"Thoughts that breathed and words that burned;"
then old Horaley, wigless and speechless, staring
at me, with the astonished negro at his side--
then Captain Wilson looking at the old gentle-
man as if he thought he deserved it-and Cap-
tain Wilson's two attendants, who had all the
day been mute, and who were mute still, but
spectators of the graphic leading figures, and par-
ticularly of the leading figure, myself.
I paused awhile. The lonely road on which
we stood, the dark back ground of woods, relieved
by an opening to the left of a rudely ploughed
field, with a small rural tenement at its edge, the
morning sun flashing through dark clouds with a
wandering and uncertain light, all combined to
give effect to the scene. Thinks I to myself 1
wish we had an audience here, such as one of
the old Roman amphitheatre would have held-
this is all lost. All at once through this reckless-
ness of conduct, which had bitterness in it, never-
theless, flashed wild and heart-piercing fears for
my friend, aud without saying another word I
put whip to my horse and (lashed towards Bla-
densburg.
"Halloa!" after a half minute's passe, I heard,
Captain Wilson bawl out after me, "I've got a
writ for you, too."
Over my shoulder like Mazzeppa I threw back
my defiance. I told the late party which had
formed so interesting a tableau, that they might go
to the devil, and renewed the application of my
whip to my bounding steed.
in another instant I heard them galloping after
me. We had gotten four miles from Bladensburg,
and therefore we had a four mile heat of it, and
I had the start..
"Well, if my steed holds out," thought I, "I'll
be in Bladensburg time enough to warn Horeley to
leave before they can reach him, for I reflected lie
was probably there, unable as yet to get a second."

"Ha!" thought 1, as my good steed bounded
ahead, "Bladensburg is famous for its races, but
its most famous race was from it, not to it, ( I did
not know then that I should write my memoirs) and
here goes." Full of wild excitement I gave a
whoop that would have done justice to a Texan
ranger flying, but bravely, from a host of Mexi-
cans, any two or three of whom he would more
willingly have met than have eaten his breakfast,
though he had had a long morning's ride without
it. Captain Wilson echoed my shout after me in
a tone that seemed to have real earnestness as well
as fun in it, and I just then came to a bend in the
road, which, after I turned, had a long stretch of
level pathway before me, of which I was anxious
to avail myself while out of sight of my pursuers.
The consciousness of being unseen made me think
that I could go ahead the faster, while I felt if
they should turn the bend and find that I had
gained on them they would give over the pursuit,
I had in fact nobody to fear but Wilson, and I felt
with a writ in his pocket and the law to back him
he was an individual towards whom discretion,
which would be another word for surrender, would
be the better part of valor.
In another moment I heard a wild yell from
Captain Wilson, (and I thought how well he gave
it,) behind me, and I looked anxiously over my
shoulder to see if I had gained en him. I had
evidently. How this inspired me. I arose in my
stirrups and felt the safety and the swiftness of
my steed with a gladness that made me pat his
neck gently with my hand instead of applying my
whip to his flaming flank. How cleanly, if I may
so speak, he threw the dirt from his clattering
hoofs.
"There was racing and chasing onCannobie lea,"
I said to myself. Hurra for the Bladensburg
races redivivus.
"They'll have fleet steeds that follow,"
was the cry that day, and how craven fear made
the cowards scamper, but 1 go it bravely. I'll
meet yoo yet, Sir Thomas .Johnstone and Captain
Merryman. Perchance l'll exchange a shot or
two with you myself~
"They'll have fleet steeds that follow quo~h young
Loehinvar."


72                         THE ATJTOB]
I felt like riding through Bladensburg as Dick
Turpin rode through the English village, with the
reins in my mouth and a pistol in each hand. "Go
K         it my old fellow," said Ito my horse, "and if you
take me through, though I cannot make you Con-
sul, as the Roman made his steed, yet your stall
shall have an abundant rack and a luxuriant trough,
arid you shall have a wide pasture~for your range,
and no one shall put saddle or briole on you except
on a gala day, when I bestride you to escort a lady
or play soldiers, when bright eyes look on.
"Ha! the- turnpike gates flew open for John
Gilpin; they don't fly open in this country for fly-
ing men, and therefore j~~5 lucky there are no gates
between me and the city of the races. I wish
there had been a broader turnpike than that of the
(leep shatne which they made so light of when
they broke all bounds-thbse racers of Bladens
burg. I wish there had been some high wall that
had held them to the slaughtering as they fled as
they did, that they might have been slain in the
ditch, and then, though they would have died as
inglorious as was their flight, history might have
been apocryphal on the matter, and they might
have won another name than that of craven. Like
the wife whose fidelity the husband doubts not,
though circumstances look, awry, yet she is bol
steered up by the fact that she is trusted by the one I
most concerned in her being true. Othello would
have been 'happy,' so he says, if he had 'nothing
known'-aIaS all's known-and in the very shadow
of Mount Vernon the rascals ran and betrayed the
capital, though bearing the name of him whose
ashes repose so near it. Why did not the sleeper
arise like Samuel to Saul, 'an old i~an covered
with his mantle,' and rebuke them. But they
won the race. I wonder shall I win this race of
Bladensburg."
With this change of thought to the pressing pre-
sent frorti the past, I s~ fixed myself on my sad-
dIe as to look around without abating the speed of
roy horse, and truly, except that the numbers
were less, I fancy that pursuers aid pursued looked
very much like tire Bladensburg racers.
Captain Wilson was decidedly ahead, and h~
urge'1 on his steel gallantly. Behind him were
his two ~flicial' si~le by side, and [thought lanolin.

especially the latter. For there was old Horaley
remounted and trying to hold in hiro steed, that
had more bottom than either of the other horses,
while his black man was spurring up to keep his
~ company.
I so shook with laughter that I could scarcely
keep my seat. I thought Elorslcy, Sr., must look
something like John (iilpin. I wanted to have a
near view of him and see how he looked when I
thought of the lines-
"Away went Gilpin, and away
Went Gilpin's hat and wig."
"The Iblks at Bladenshuig," I said aloud, in
lnmmny colloquy with myself, "will be as much sur-
prised as were the Ibiks along the road that Gil-
phin scared up. Zounds, it it were midnight
now-
"Tramp, tramp, along the sand they rode,
Splash, splash, along the sea,"
as we went it through the burg illustrious in the
history of races, they might take us for the ghosts
of those citizen soldiers, who 'ran away' and
'lived,' but not 'to fight another day,' who were
buried among their kindred, but as it might be sup-
posed doomed to the purgatory of an occasional
ride over the course where their living flesh did so
outrage manhood."
"stop, I tell you," shouted Captain Wilson
when he saw me looking back at them.
I thought of the old soldier's remark when he
was ordered by the foe to surrender his arms, and
who replied, "come an(1 take them," and I bel-
lowed back-
"Catch me."
"Shoot him down," shouted out Horsley, in I
screaming tone that struck distinctly on my ear.
1 could not but think of his christian spirit as I
turned my back again to the foe to put my steed to
his mettle, when lo! I found myself in the out-
skirts, (if outskirts it might be called) of Bladens-
burg, the winner of the race, thouiih not by many
lengths, and f-ill in view ot the Bladensburg hotel,
at which, at that very moment, I saw the carriage
which contained Captain Merryman and his friend

CHAPTER XXV.
SCENE IN THE BLADENSBHRG IIOTEL'-MY iNTERVIEW
WITH HOUSLEY, JR.-CAPTAIN IIERRYMAN 'S RATiD DE-
SCENT OF THE STAIR CASE-TWO MEN SHOT WITHOUT
A DUEL-PERCHANCE THE ItIOlIT ONES-OLD HORSLEY
REVOKES HIS WILL
I resolved at once what I was to do. Dashing
up to the carriage, I flung myself from my horse,
throwing the bridle to the hackman, who was obse-
quiously awaiting with open door the descent of
Johostone and his friend. I sprang past them into
the bar room and asked where Horsley was?
"Not up yet, sir," was the reply of the bar
keeper.
I darted up stairs and found him getting up,
awakened, as he afterwards told me, by the clatter
of my horse's hoofs. In an instant I explained to
him the state of affairs.
"I must be off," said he, "that fellow, Merry-
man, would say, should I be arrested, that I had
time to dodge and didn't, and then I'd have to
challenge him. And to tell you the truth, Russell,"
he continued, as he drew on his boots, "I would
rather that Johnstone should have two shots at me
than that Merryman should have one. Ha, I hear
tl~em on the steps; well, I'll through this door,"
hE~ continued, turning to one which evidently let
into another room, "though it opened into my lady's
chamber."
As he opened the door I passed out into the entry
and there met Captain Merryman.
The captain's manner was cautious, profoundly
so; cool as possible, cool to insolence, which was
sharpened by the very slightest shadow of a smile,
which played about his eye among the crow feet,
and looked as devilish as a brutal, bloody and
brandy lighted eye well could.
"They've found out their mistake, Mr. Russell,
so ~Oll had better adrn9nish Mr. Horslcy to save
himself from arrest by escape, or it will all end in
child's play, and we've had enough of it already.
I arc told that the yonng gentleman~~ father is on

of angry blood in me, but I determined to imitate
the captains coolness as I replied:
"Yes, captain, I never learned but that Mr.
1-lorslcy had these virtues, and I consider him
equal to any gentleman, wears he the button or
not, who has the reputation of having most of the
vices."
"Sir, I never dodge an insult. I am not like the
Frenchman, sir, who, when a thing is said to him
of doubtful import, takes the buttered side."
"There is no buttered side that I know of in
what I said," I replied scornfully.
"None to me, sir, at least. We understand
I each other, Mr. Russell. Dr. Clark, I have heard
my pious mother say-was it not Dr. Clark, Sir?
-Dr. Adam Clark"-I looked at him without
saying a word-"You don't recollect-yes, it was
Dr. Adam Clark-he used to say that a man could
not have too many irons in the fire at once-doubt-
ful that-but, sir, understand: my shooting irons
are always ready on such an oc~asionZyon under-
stand, sir-mum's the word. I trust Mr. Horslcy
has made his escape-he is a gentleman of small
proportions, and our landlady here is a large wo~inan;
ho could easily hide under her petticoats, ~'hich I
dare say she will let him do, when I assure her he
is quite harmless- though that position might not
quite suit his own notions."
[looked hard at the captain again, and my first
reflection was that as I had gotten into a difficulty
with him at any rate, the best thing I could do
would be to pitch him down stairs. We are ph~r-
siognomnists of the passions, though the quieter
emotions maybe are often misunderstood. Their
lines are not so legible. My angry stare put the'
captain on his guard, for he placed himself 1n an
attitude of defence. Thin (is it strange?) fixed my
purpose, and with my clenched fists I struck him
as he stood on the edge of the stair way, with my
whole strength, and over lie went, raking an in--
effectual grasp at the railing as he fell. He, how-
ever, struck the banister in his fall, which broke

might say black. I stood at the head of the stairs
without moving, and saw* the gallant captain
launched into the bar room, just as he has seen
many a gallant vessel giveti to the deep-both
launched into their native elements.
"Thunder!" exclaimed Captain Wilson, who
was standing in conversation with the bar keeper
below, "what's out now?" And as he spoke Cap-
tain Merryman tumbled at his feet. Wilson, im-
mediately ran to his assistance, and lifted him up
as I descended the steps into the bar room. Cap-
tain Merryman was not apparently the least hurt.
but he was evidently choked with rage and blind
with passion. He shook himself free from Wilson,
which, however, he could not have done easily had
the former been disposed to hold him, and he
stamped about the room in an effort' to catch his
breath and see distinctlyy.
As [glanced fiom the stamping captain round
the room, there was Wilson's two silent attendants
apart in the window, while old [lorslcy, with his
black attendant behind him, was gazing intently at
the captain.
"What's the matter'?"
"I knocked him down stairs," I said.
When a child gives the string which controls
he limbs of his move able man-toy a jerk, at once
up goes its arms and out goes its legs, and so went
old Horsley's as he bent his body down and threw
his arms up oyer his head, shuddering all over as
he muttered with white lips:
"Murder."
"Not exactly murder," said Captain Merry-
man, who had now come to himself, and whose
coolness, so suddenly resumed, was remarkable,
"not exactly murder, but merely an attempt at it,"

"Get out of the way, Mr. Constable, I corn-
mand you; sir. It is no use to remonstrate or to.
command the pea~e," exclaimed Captain Merry-'
man, changing his position so as to get a fire at
me,.while I stood stock still, though I must con-
fess I was glad to be sheltered by the broad chest
of Captain Wilson.
"Look here, I tell you," said Wilson, "I have
seen a thousand such fusses as these. If you 'm~ist
fight let's have it fair, I've got a pair of pistols."
"You're a pretty officer of the law to iii-
stigat'- a duel. No, that individual is without the
pale of honorable warfare. 1 consider him an as-
sasin and he must suffer as such. Get out ot the
way sir, or 'you may catch it yourself."
"Look here," said Captain Wilson, producing a
stout pistol from away in next to his skin, as I
thought, "here's 'Polly my darling,' and you've
my word for it, and I never break my word, if
you shoot the young tuan I'll shoot you.~~
In the act of getting out his pistol, Captaiti Wil-
son exposed part of my person to the aim of Cap-
tain Merryman, who took advantage of it and pull-
ed the trigger. I saw that his aim was upon me
in a mortal manner, but his pistol snapped, or in all
human probability I should not be writing this.
Quick as thought, Captain Merryman cocked his
pistol again and pointed at me.
"This is fooling," exclaimed Captain Wilson,
enraged, and before even I was aware of his in-
tention, so quick was his sight and so keen was
his aitn, he discharged his weapon. Captain
Merryman started at the shot and as his broken
right arm fell at his side, his pistol went off and one
long howl of "murder" from old Horsley directed
our attention to that gentleman, who was prostrated

and he put his hand in his breast and drew out a on the floor, and the same moment Johostone en-

his side. "This is downright murder-Lord be
mez~iful to me."
We stripped off his ciat and vest, and his bloody
shirt betrayed the fact that he was indeed wound-
'ed and I feared* mortally. Everything was xjn-
fusion.
"Gentlemen," said Captain Wilson, "listen to
me."
All were still, flow a commanding spirit will
exhibit itself in an emergency.
"Have you a doctor in the burg'?" Captain
Wilson asked.
"Yes."
"Then go for him." Turning to his mute at-
tendants he said, "Mr. Munson and friend Pettit,
start at once for Washington and bring doctors
here. You had better get fresh horses."
'"I'll go," said the hackman, "and bring them
out if you'll pay me."
"I'll ride in the hack," said Captain Merry-.
man, "bar keeper, mix me a glass of brandy and
water. Who are you and what are you?" said he,
addressing himself to Captain Wilson.
"There's no time to talk about that, sir-no
time. I'm responsible both to you and the law.
*B~~t I tell you what it is, I don't want you to die
before your time. You had better let that liquor
alone-you live too high now--that liquor will
inflame' your blood. Your arm's broke, I see, and
the present state you are in will make it go hard
with you; you may lose your arm, perhaps your
life. I'm familiar with wounds, stranger."
What a horrible expression of despair and hate
passed over Captain Merryman~s countenance,
though' h~ said nothing; while in the silence,
which for a moment occurred, old llorsley ejacu-
lated:
"Send for a 'dozen doctors, gentlemen-I'll pay
the expertise. 0 Lord! be merciful-this is tnur-
dcr-a little Water-a little drop of water." I
turned to 'him and found he had fainted away.
Captain Merryman seemed, after a moment's re-
flection, to consider the advice of Captain Wilson
as .the best he could take in the premises, and
while some were assisting him off with his coat,
others of us were attending to Mr. Horslcy, while
all were impatiently awaiting the arrivalot the
doctor of Bladensburg~ whose residence we were

13

informed was not far off, and who'at that early
hour of the morning had not probably gone out.
Before noon we had six doctors from Wasnington
and three from Bladensburg, in attendance on the
wounded men. Captain Merryman's arm was set,
but he was suffering in his room alone, for John-
stone had gone to Washington for the physicians,
but had not returned with them. The wound of
Mr. Horslcy was cot as bad as was at first
anticipated. The bullet 'had struck a rib, and
as. is frequently the case, passed around the
body and was extracted from his back. He wa~
pronounced out of all danger, taken up stairs and
comfortably lodged in bed, and I could not but
give l~m my attendance, for though I had 'not the
least respect for himself, knowing the manner in
which he had treated his son, yet I could not but
sympathize with his sufferings and rc~pect hts age.
By way of satisfying the old gentleman of his
son's proper conduct, for to do him justice he was
greatly distressed upon the subject, I gave him a
full account of the whole affair of the duel, saying
nothing about myself but when I could not help
it, and doing all I could to soften away his asperi-
ties towards his son.
"Yes, yes, Mr. Russell, I want you to get me a
pen and paper. I had been so outraged, sir, by
Samuel's conduct, that I had left all my property
to an asylum for destitute children, and, for fear of
a turn-you don't think there's any fear, though?~~
"No, sir, the doctors think not."
"Ab, my young friend, but they're uncertain.
Holy Providence, how suddenly my old clerk,
that respectable but I must say wilful man, the,
late lamented Mr. Beazely, how suddenly he was
called off-for fear of a turn I'll right things at once.
Let me be propped up in bed, I will write immedi-
ately to Balttmore and have my will destroyed.
My mind misgave me about disinheriting Sammy,
when I thought myself in a mortal condition, but I
must say it would have been much better if Mr.
Beazely had left his property to me, I should then
have had much more control over him. He would
not have broken loose in this way."
Fearful that the old gentleman's situation might
take a "turn," as he was pleased to express it,
whereby my friend, had it proved fatal, would
have lost what was justly his inheritance, I propped

conversation with him before I found out who he
was.
Captain Merryman was the greatest sufferer.

however, cut the whole party of us, though he

BIOGRAPHY OF

My readers are perchance surprised that I have
said nothing of my parents since I left Charleston.
In fact I scarcely ever thought of them in the stir-
ring scenes whicir I am recording. I certainly
thought more of my Aunt Betsy than either of
them, if I except at times the inexpressible feel-
ings of tenderness which came over me when I
thought of my mother, and of her last farewell.
Parents who wish to retain the affections of
their children should not send them away from
the parental roof, particularly when it becomes
but the light of a distant memory (if I may use
the expression) which lessens every day. No,
we are such creatures of habit that we fall into the
habit of thinking about and loving those with
whom we are associated, particularly if they have
authority over us and treat us kindly, and out of
the habit of regarding the ties of nature; in fact,
as the proverb goes, the habit makes the second
attire.
My parents had written periodically to me ever
since my childhood, my mother expressing a great
deal of affection for me, at which I began to wonder,
and they were always telling me how much I
ought to love "Aunt Betsy," which I certainty
felt to be a fact wheneverthe old lady petted me.
'and which I quarreled with myself 1~r feeling
whenever she refused to pet me, or crossed me in
any way. L was twice arranged that I should go
to Charleston and see m~ l)arents, but then when
I was young I could not go without my aunt Betsy.
for she would not l~et me leave her sight, arid she
had terrors of another sea voyage not to be over-
come, and her fear of land travel, (not then what
it is now) was immoderate; so that I entered
manhood and did not go to see my parents. Some-
times, too, my mother would write that she was
coming on to see us~ but then my father, whose
health was failing, was loth to move abopt much,
and my mother would not leave him, and in the
meantime these visits were often spoken of and
arranged, but were not made by either party.
And thus and thus we go through life.
The truth is, that my father had a notion that
1 'vas getting ott better with my aunt than I po~si
bly could with my mother. He always fancied,
so I learned from aunt Betsy, that my mother
would indulge m~ ever much. This in fact is

what my good aunt did her best to impress upon E
him herself, she holding the opinion, I suspect, I
that she was sometimes rather too rigid with me.
This I felt was the fact ever since the Sunday
suit matter in the Peterson affair. But when my
iunt was struck with this notion of her severity it
was marvellous how she would relax her discip-
line, or rather how her indulgence would not only
become indiscriminate but lavish. And I used
often to think to myself if the world were my aunt
Betsy, that is, if things in particular and things
in general in this world, were like my aunt Betsy~
how I would "come ~
No! parents who wish their children to love
them, should leara them that love; that is, should
keep their children by their side and let them feel
their childish dependence upon parental cate. But
enough of this. It maybe all hollow apology for
myself.
But I commenced this chapter by saying it was
a bright day in Washington. Quite a flattering
account of our intended duel and the circumstances
pertaining titereto, had gotten into the papers, and
our Bladensburg race was told by the letter writers
in a much more graphic manner than I have given
it, from the fact that I confined myself to the
truth. If our names had not been given I should
not have known myself in the affair at all; I figured
so heroically, as taking the responsibility of life
and limb in the place of my friend, while Horsicy
figured aslargely, and quite an unique account of his
character and oddities was given by the leading
correspondent of a New York paper, which was
written so well as to attract universal attention,
and to he generally copied throughout the whole
union.
Even the dignified and most courteous as well
as most able editor of the National Intelligencer,
(it would be well for the land if there were more
like him at the helm of the press) gave it place, as
he said, for the exquisite skill at narration which the
writer, who, the editor asserted, would not be long
unknown to fame if he wrote much, had exhibited,
as well as for the strange, and as far as Captain
Wilson and Mr. Horsley, Sr., were concerned,
sad manner in which the affair ended. Horsley
and I became distinguishedd" characters.
This was just at the time when the nullification

'15

lazonry was coming up in Congress, a matter that
had not thought about, for all I cared for politics
was the politics of the green room of the IJollid~y
street Theatre and our own little Thespian corps,
md, it made the Southern men, and particularly
he South Carolinians, "cotton" to me in a way
hat made rue a great favorite among them, when
hey came to know who I was. And this cordial-
ty on their part was increased from the fact that
ferrymann at a public dinner had drank a drunken
oast in opposition to the palmetto state. There
were fire caters in Congress in those days, and they
rentedd me, a Southern youth from the Monumen.
tal city, with an all hail that was certainly grati-
fying, gentle reader, to your autobiographer, though
it certainly gave my phrenological development
of self-esteem more sail than ballast. I could not,
however, but wish (seing how the affair ended,)
that I had boldly stepped out from behind Captain
Wilson and defied Captain Merryman to fire, and
I rejoiced exceedingly that that part of my adven-
ture was not chronicled. On the contrary, I was
represented as advancing with uplifted chair on
the cocked pistol of Captain Merryman, whose life
was saved by the breaking of his arm from the fire
of a friend ol' mine who stood by, the account
stated, for had it not been for that fact, "Mr. L~tis-
sell would certainly have brained the gallant
captain with the chair." I certainly blushed a
kind of sneaking blush, when I read this in the
privacy of my own room, but unless my reader
has been similarly situated, he can have no idea
what a face I put on in public, making that very
blush seem an effusion of youthful and native
modesty, as though I had periled my life without
thinking any body saw me, as the man of Ross
"Did good by stealth and blushed to find it fame."
Again, I repeat, it was a bright day in Washing-
ton. It was not only bright in itself, but it was
bright because I was bright, and there's the rub.
The bright and the dark day is more in our feel-
ings than anywhere else, as Hamlet, in his moody
fit, well shows. That was a dark day to Cassius,
certainly not exactly a dull one to his designing
and active spirit, when he told Brutus that
"This world, was made for CHsar,"

upon the eternal city. And it was a bright day I turn necessary for a man of my position and ox-.
to him when he thought himself a successful con- f pectancy."

aspirator aud called himself a devoted patriot, though
the natural world might be decidedly cloudy. Did
not Mark Antony feel that "the world was made"
for Cmsar's successors, but alas! he met with the
Egyptian witch. But Horsley and I did certainly
enjoy that bright day in Washington, as we strolled
arm in arm down the sunny side of Pennsylvania
Avenue, and did the Washington public, a very
motley public, the honor of gratifying their desire
to see us, and our own to see them- they having
the most for theii penny, I thought, and so I told
Horeley.
"Ha, ha," and he laughed heartily in his own
peculiar way, but his brow saddened as he said,
"but, Russell, 1 am sorry for Merryman."
"It's more than I am," I replied. "Why, 'old
floss,' he's practising the duello with his left hand,
and has gotten to be as perfect with it as he was
with his right-he has designs on me certainly-
and I tell you what it is, I'll have to go to the pistol
gallery and keep myself in constant practice, for
I am certain that he'll send me an invitation some
of these days, and I can tell you it's no joke to
have a fellow pointing a pistol at you with the
mortal aim of Captain Merryman."
I left Horaley to conclude that there I stood
breasting this same mortal aim with no intervening
chair and no protecting Captain Wilson.
"Fact," replied Horsley, "when a man in cold
blood looks over these matters, he wonders how
he could do such things in the sight of God; we all
understand that he can't well do anything else in
the sight of rnan-lut I really, old acquaintances as
we were, felt so indignant towards Johnstone for
his pertinacity, that though I had resolved not to
shoot at him, I don't kn6w but what, when we got
on the ground, I would have shot, nevertheless, if
I had seen him pointing at me with a deadly aim
and revengeful eye."
"I tell you what it is, 'old floss,' 1 am out of
funds-now's my time with my good aunt, she
thinks I'm here learning statesmanship, and making
myself popular with the distinguished sons (if my
native state, and hang me if 1 know what nullifi-
cation means. You must goto Baltimore for me,
see her and set forth my need and the expendi-

"flow much do you want?"
"Why, I want four or five hundred dollars; be
particular to impress upon the old lady that I
never play cards-state to her, 'old floss,' that it
is a singular fact that whenever 1 see a card I ana
seized with such a moral revulsion that my physi-
cal man gives way, and I have quite a spell of
"It would be well if I could say as much for you
on your seeing a bottle of wine-but there your
appetite grows by what it feeds on."
"That's natural-all artificial excitements grow
by their use-a child eats a piece of bread to-day
and don't want a larger piece to-morrow, but a boy
who is made sick when he first smokes or chews or
drinks, in his determination to be a man, soon ac-
quires such an appetite for the segar, quid or dram,
that he is wretched without it, and he continues to
devote himself to its use with a growing propensity
until he becomes a victim, especially the devotee
of the dram."
Ah, it was a beautiful afternoon in Washing-
ton. The crowded avenue was full of gaily dress-
ed people, and though it was now winter, the air
was spring-like and delicious, and except the leaf-
less trees ~n the avenue, there was nothing to de-
note that spring was not upon us. The golden sun
hid his broad disk, as John Randolph would say,
behind the Virginia hills, and threw his parting
rays on the dome of the capitol, and all was gaiety
and gladness (at least to the eye) with the crowd
of well dressed and distinguished people, who
thronged the avenue.
"Ha, ha" laughed Horsley, with that quizical,
peculiar, knowing laugh of his, "it was Jeines,
whose conscience smote him, and he went straight,
when he reflected upon the fire eating propensities
of Captain Merryman and my innocence of any
experience, to say nothing of my courage in the
matter, and blew the affair to the old gentleman.
The old gentleman shoWed more affection for me
thati I thought he would; he was very kind to rue
in his confinement to his room."
"So 1w diould have been."
Horsley looked at me.
"The fact is, Horsley, that I have been brought

up away from my parents, and therefore I think
that as we are not consulted in the matter of our
coming into this breathing world, that those who
place us here are at least bound to take care of us
until we can take care of ourselves, and if any
peculiar rash passion attaches to our clay because
of kinship, those who gave it to us ought to suffer
it in our own persons, inasmuch as they bear with
it in their own."
"Well, I don't know," said Horsley, musingly.
"This Captain Wilson," I said, "I have new
seen him since. I described the captain of the
city watch here to a friend, and he is just the op-
posite in personal description to the one who ar-
rested me according to him. You would'nt like to
ask your father about it?"
"Well, indeed I would'ut. lie ha~ been very
kind to me."
"You owe it to me," said I to Horslcy, stopping
him and facing him on the corner. "I am satisfied
that I have oratorical as well as histrionic talent.
I say nothing of the scene between the old gentle
man and myself at the Bladensburg races, though
as orator Phillips says of the character of Napo-
leon, it was 'grand, gloomy and peculiar,' but
when your governor was lying stretched out there
at Bladensburg with that bullet in his side and his
fears for his life fiercely wrought upon, I read the
good book to him; I tell you, with emotion. It's
lucky for you I am a good reader; 1 made every
word tell-every word-one particularly -l watch-
ed the process-he was uncommonly down-hearted
and he felt himself to be a sinner, for he kept
making the remark to himself, not aware that I
overheard him, and I introduced the subject of
your last message to him when you had that pro-
found presentiment that you were to be shot in the
morning. Well, I gave it the greatest effect; if
the reading told on old loss, Sr., there is no tell-
ing what my manner of narrating your message
had on him. I tell you, sir. I drew copious tears
fiom the old gentleman, and what's more, I dr~w~
tears from myself, and made him draw up a revo-
cation of his will-why the old gentleman told me
he was worth two hundred thousand dollars, that
he was about endowing destitute children, as much

but, "old loss," you must draw five hundred do!-
lars at least from her pocket.i~
"Well, I'll take the stage to-morrow."
"Certainly, I have sent, franked by Calhoun
himself, the papers containing the last Bladensburg
races to my dear good aunt, and you must be sure
and let her know that Calhoun sent them out of
respect for her. You must furthermore let her
know he means to mention her in his memoirs as
the paragon of aunts, as I shall rank as the paragon
of nephews. Horsicy, if I were in your place and'
you in mine, I believe I could get five thousand
dollars for you."
"Well, there's one thing you may be assured
of."
~6 .AThat's that?"
"Why, if I had the power to get five thousand
dollars for you I would not, for you are certainly
going it rather strong already. I expect. to hear
of your losing everything at gambling yet."
"Thank you for nothing-you know my opinion
of gamblers and gambling."
"Yes, I know your opinion of a good many mat-
ters and things, and I know how a~ertain place is
paved."
"Ab, I say Horaley," I exclaimed, turning the
subject, "if you see Jemes, fernes Jumper, Esq.,
do bring him down. I should like to see him
again nod inquire into the whole of this affair, for
hang me if I have the hang of it yet."
"I will; but why not go down to Baltimore your-
self, and see all your friends?"
"That 1 might do," I replied, but then if my-
good aunt was to hear that I was on hand there,
she would grow angry with me for my want of
respect for her. And the 'put money in thy purse,

MISS VIRGINIA UPTON-A GREAT BELLE-HER FLIRTA-
TIONS- -HIT-HER CHARACTER-MY ADMIRATION FOR
THE 5EX-AJ~t DIFFERENT FROM MOST MEN-Mv IIUN.
BLE OPINION AS TO THE MANNER IN WHIOII DIFFERENT
BEAUTIES SHOULD WEAR THEIR HAIR-.-CONvERSATIoN
WITH MiSS VIRGINIA-THE CAROLINA BEAUTY-Nv
WAYWARD THOUGHTS OF ALICIL
My engagement was to take a drive with a dis-
tinguished belle, who was then in the height of
her bellehood. She had been educated on the
continent of Europe. Her father had been our
minister abroad to one of the first courts of the con-
tinent, and there, at a very early age, she had
figured most extensively. Her love affairs were
as numerous as the affairs of some successful duel-
ist-for she came off, at least in all instances but
one, unharmed, and she had hit her man, I know
not how often. In the case in which she was hit
herself, she suffered, it was said, much both in her
vanity and in her affections.
~he met a young sprig of nobility, Lord Light-
ner, at some watering place or other, and set out
with the intention of catching him. They had
ample leisure to play upon each other, and the
lady who had always before come off conqueror,
now found her match.
Like one who wilfully dares their companion to
a trial of skill in some game where a missive is
thrown to and fro, which each party expects to
catch and throw back again, she received a wound
whieb she did not expect, and like the conquering
gladitor, who calls out in the lists before an am-
phitheatre 'habet'-he has it-the nobleman un-
harmed in the strife went forth and boasted of his
conquest. And ii was a conquest; for everybody
saw how much the lady suffered.
The nobleman was of mature age, thirty-three,
at least, it was said; and when she talked of her
girlish penchant for the Lord, which was not very
otten, though sometimes it bubbled up in its bit-

terness, though it seemed to be the very lightest
thing in her memory when she alluded to him,
she confessed herself at the period of her acquain-
tance with him a girl not seventeen-others said
she was out of her teens-but vanity of vanities,
says Soloman, who can fix the sliding scale of a
woman's age. However, when I knew her she
was still in her beauty's bloom-but she affected
the company of young men or very old ones, and
to me she had taken an especial liking, if I might
judge from the pretty things she said to me, and in
the glibest way imaginable.
I have had some credit for understanding women,
and I think I do, where roy own feelings are not
involved; but this knowledge has come after much
travail and experience, and was not at this time
very clear in its conceptions or deductions. I took
more of Miss Virginia Upton's compliments
for tenderness then than I should now, at least at
first-but ~ve soon became fast friends.
I must be permitted to say, that I have one per-
sonal peculiarity different from most men who have
come under my knowledge-I am shy of men, but
not of won~en. I never meet a man more than half
way, rarely even half way, unless I thoroughly
know my man before hand and like him upon in-
stinct. Not so with a woman. I think I can say that
from my early recollections, provided I was not
at all smitten with gill or woman, that I could al-
ways approach her unembarrassed. In fact, I
mean to say, with a conviction that there was no
fear of being repulsed-I mean in the ordinary
courtesies of life. That thing called sheepishness,
which haunts some men all their lives, I never
had anything to do with, except in my childhood,
perhaps. So that while I could laugh and chat
with women (I like the word woman more than
that of lady; a'nd I remember that Mr. John Quincy
Adams told me once always to use it when I could
in speaking of the sex,) with gaiety and pleasure,
and without the least morbid feeling, in the corn-
pany of men I often found myself morbid t:ntil
warmed with wine, and then I was often savage,
and, to tell the plain truth of myself, sometiiries
insulting.
Beautiful was this fair lady of my liking, (I
use the word lady here for the alliteration,) and
well she knew how to manage all the artillery of
Ii

RUSSELL.                                 79
her charms. Oh! that deep blue eye of hers, how
it flashed through its long fringes! She had a
small head and the most exquisitely chisselled tem-
ples I ever saw; and then having classic features,
she had the taste to weat her hair parted plain,
and having beautiful ears she had the sense to show
them. I do abomina'te this fashion which many of
our wome~i have now-a-days of hiding the ears en-
tirely. The fashion must have been invented by
some woman who bad been cropped; or, for that's
harsh, it must have been invented by some res-
plendent and capricious and false beauty who had
had that delicate organ bitten off by some jealous
lover, whoin pretending to whisper love, revenged
himself upon her over-credulous ear for putting
faith in his rival's promises.
Yes, where a woman has classic features she
should always wear her hair plain. Where her
features are not classic, regular if you please, and
their beauty depends upon their lighting up, and
the variety of their expression, then she should
wear curls, for they give an archness and win-
ninguess to her glancing and flashing eye. These
form the ambush from which cupid in such a coun-
tenance shoots his keenest arrows. There are some
women, however7, who attract with either toilette.
t have a fair cousin, that I may write about some
of these days, when I wish to speak of the holier
influences of life, who presents an equal attraction
in either toilette. But then it is the mind and
purity and heart that shine forth in all her actions,
look forth from her bright face alike in the brilliant
toilette of the gay saloon, or in the simple one of
her rural home, that gives her such influence over
all and wins so surely all hearts.
But I was speaking of my friend Virginia. I
found her at honie per appointment. The stately
carriage was dnwn up before her abode, and, as
the waiter, who stood in careless chat on the door
step with the driver on the coach box, lifted his
hat and told me his mistress ~vas in and really, 1
thought I saw on the features of the liveryied lackey
a knowing smile as he glanced at my well appoint-
ed habiliments, and detected in them a wish to
please, which he seemed to pity, (the rascal, so I
thought,) as he had every reason to believe it
would di~d in discomfiture, a defeat like the efforts
of my predecessors.

Now, what made me think that? Gentle read
ers have you any idea? Knowing that the lad;
had proved invulnerable save to one, and that ni
more that sutor was in the field and wac perchanc
even forgetful of his triumph-knowing this, dii
my vanity feel a spur at the lackey's grin'? Did h4
grin with any thought at all, or was it merely th~
same kind of smile he flung at the feet of ever~
visitor, young or old? My barber had told me tha
this same lackey had boasted of his mi5tres55 con-
quests, and had said (the barber had a peculiar:
smile I thought, too, when he told it,) that I ofter
visited her-and the barber scrutinized my faee a~
he held my nose, and an involuntary movement or
my luart had caused him to give me a cut, the only
unseemly appurtenance to my physiognomy, which
was coat-plastered, yet-. Now the quere is,
had all these circumstances made me more anxious
to please than was my wont, as I pauaiud a iiiu meni
to glance over my person and see that all was right,
and given m'a a consciousness of a nervous desire tc
please as I glided into the lady's presence? You
dissectors of the human heart, analize it.
"AhI you traitor, yo5!~~ she exclaimed, hall
rising from her chair and giving me her hand-
not her "jewelled hand" as the novelists say, for
there was no jewel on it, and only the ornament of
a plain go~d ring on the middle finger-a ring that
had a history I thought, "How dare you keep a
lady so? You are old enough to know better."
I felt myself blush, (how I hated it,) while the
lady's merry laugh started her mocking bird in the
next room to an envious imitation of it.
"Oh you creature, why did not you keep your
appointment and come to the very mor1ient? Why,
don't you know that you should have been seen
walking up and down on the other side of the
street impatiently awaiting the hour which you
dared not anticipate."
Piqued at the allusion to my age, (for I shaved
twice every day, besides using bear's grease and
macasser in aid of a mustache which I was deter-
mined to bring to life on my upper lip,) I said, as
I took her hand, which I half elevated to my lips
as I bowed over it-
"I was detained (false, every bit of it,) in alle-
giance to a beauty of my native State."
"Allegiance to a beauty of your native State!"

I- exclaimed Miss Virginia, with some sharpness......
y "And who is she that takes your allegiance from
a your plighted engagement?"
"Miss Singleton,~l I said.
I    "Miss Singleton!  Your dancing-master, Mr.
a Russel, should have taught you more than the
a making a pretty bow."
"AhI Miss Virginia, my reverence for beauty,
like my obedience, is an instinct. Miss Singleton
claimed my attendance to a portrait painters, and
r I could not leave her in the midst, when the artist
said he was in the vein, and meant to paint the
most beautiful woman in the United States-of
course that means the world-! could not leave
her-you would have banished me from your side,
had I dared to do such a thing. Reverence for all
your sex proves one capable of adoring one. My
allegiance is due to Carolina, but I thought, to be
honest, that if the artist should claim you for his
canvass too, by the right that artists have to claim
the beautiful for sitters, that the "ripe and real"
may live upon the canvass and outshine the "ideal."
The 1 ady looked nettled for a moment at the
- slight allusion that the quotation might make to her
own age, and exclaimed, interrupting me,
"Upon my word, sir, you are a bold speech-
maker."
"f-lear me out-and I am sorry that I have to
confess it-but my allegiance to Carolina shall not
be broken-and this treason against her, if 'tis told
upon me, I shall deny-yet I must confess that I
am aware that if the artist I have named should
claim you as a sitter by the prescriptive right I
have recited, Carolina in the encounter will meet
with a rivalry as fearful as that which her noblest
son has to maintain in the Senate."
"Rivalry in the Senate," lisped the proud beau-
ty, while her bust heaved with pride, "Say inns-
teu~', sir." -
"No. I have denied my allegiance to 'the 'nost
beautiful woman of my State, and the force of trea-
son like the force of nature, in making Milton a
poet, can no further ~
"You think her beautiful?" said Miss Upton.
"Beautiful!" I exclaimed, echoing her. "By
this fair hand," and I took her hand again in one
of mine, as she half raised it as I made the vow-

"You are a
"I have not uttered who."
Ah, but my heart was no traitor if my lips had
beca-for the lady of the Monumental City, the
fair Alice, came to my lips, and I almost felt will-
ful enough to pronounce it. I would have done so
if I had not thought of Peterson; but I bowed again
and said, "I am no flatterer-pardon me."
I raised Miss Upton from her chair, and handed
her to her carriage.
On we rolled, and I felt a kind of exulting proud
wish-as if I had been injured by her-to meet
Alice Clare as I chatted to the fair lady by my
side. We swept into the avenue on a drive to the
Navy Yard, where Miss Upton meant to call, to in-
troduce me to a friend, and I was particularly
pleased with the attention which the handsome
equipage of Miss Virginia, and, I thought, to say
nothing of herself, the distingue appearance of
the gentleman beside her attracted. Happily, the
reflection occurred to me at this very moment that
I was becoming a puppy; and then while 1 still
wished that Alice Clare could see me (oh! how I
wanted to see her, though,) a rush of sadness and
sorrow broke over my heart.
"Something that's bitter will arise,
Even amidst our jollities,"
and we suffer our passions to make sad wreck of all
that is noble in our nature. "A h!" I thought to
myself, "I wonder if Alice has as much of the
heart-ache as I have."
"Pray, what are you so abstracted about?" said
Miss Virginia.
"Thinking that this pleasure must so scion end;
that you think of so many, wh('n so many think
of only you." And then, in a most rascally way,
I made the quotation whieh 1 had often made to
Alice-
"The nsooa looks
On many brooks,
The brook can see no moon but one."
And I made my voice, in uttering it, catch a tone
of tenderness from the well-spring of my heart,
where the memory of Alice was stirring its foun-

tains at that very moment-like some fugitive
poet-fugitive I mean from true sentiment as well
as in rhyme-who kills two birds with one stone,
and makes the verses, the inspiration of which he
had caught from one woman, do execution on an-
other.
Miss Upton smiled. "You'll do," she said, "but
oh, you prodigal, why waste your geld so lavishly?
Why fling it away with so profuse a hand?-have
you none for Miss Singleton?
"Why, if you refuse it I can gather it again," I
replied, "for Miss Singleton or Miss Anybody
else.'
"You mean to say its a charitable gift, and not
my deservings?~~ I smiled, and she continued-
"Ali! there's Miss Singleton. Who's that young
gentleman with her?"

YOUNG SANGSTON WiTh MISS SINGLETON-ms FATflEE-

hER SlANT ADNIREItS-IIER MANNER TO 5ANGSTON-
Ills FEELiNGS-MORE THAN POLITICAL RiVALRIES iN
wAShINGTON-NOT CONFINED TO POLITICIANS.
I turned in my lolling posture beside Miss Upton,
for we were riding towards the Capitol and I wan
seated at her left, so that she commanded the view
of that side of the avenue which is frequented by
the fashionable wayfarers, and I incl;ning to her,
could not so easily observe the crowd-I turned,
and there was Miss Singleton with young Sangs-
ton, an official in the - Department.
"lie was the only son of his mother, and she a
widow." 11cr history is a very common one in
Washirt~ton. Her husband, Jamc~Sangston, was
from Alabama, which State lie had represented in
Congress for several years. Afierwards, in Mr.
Monroe's administration, lie had taken office as an
auditor-which Ilosition is a most respectable one,
with a handsome salary attached, which salary Mr.
Sangaton more than expended in the profuse enter-
tainment of his friends-for he had many, and lie
thought he had more than he really possessed, for,
there were few who failed to accept his invitations;
"The heartless parasites of present cheer."


His wife was from the State of New York. Sh
was devoted to her husband, and she tried in van
to check his lavish expenditure. With tl~e fre
impulses of the South, Mr. Sangston had exprosset
his political preferences; and on the accession o
General Jackson to the presidency he was removed
His habits, never good even while in office, (the~
formed the ostensible grounds for hi~ removal,;
became worse when he found himself pennyless,
and incapable of earning a livelihood for his wife
His son, the young gentleman with Miss Sange.
ton, had held a subordinate clerkship under his
father before he was of age, and he shared the of-
ficial fate of the old gentleman. They certainly
were two helpless men-father and son.
Mrs. Sangs~on~s only resource was to open a
boarding house, (this is a very common case in
Washington) and while she was toiling along, sor-
rowfully indeed, half of her time being devoted to
her husband in his fits of intemperance, or in his
illness consequent upon his recovery front them-
he suddenly died. All at once great compassion
was felt for the widow, who was more to be pitied
as a wife, and young Sangston was restored to the
clerkship which he had held under his father.
At the time of which I speak the mother was
keeping boarders; a small number, but her's was
the fashionable boarding house of the city, and her
son, Henry Sangston, was in office, boarding with
her. He had been restored to his place, as it was
said, to aid his mother with his salary; but I fear
the fa0t was that his mother aided him. She cer-
tainly had, for her means, heavy debts to pay
for him, for he had all the prodigality of his father,
and lie also inherited his father's fondness for con-
vivality, (for a vice is sometimes an inheritance---
and this is one .f the ways in which the sins of the
father are visited upon his children.)
I made Henry Sangston's acquaintances at the
time of Horsiey senior's removal front Bladensbnrg.
That worthy gentleman had a great regard even
for the smallest current coin of Uncle Sam, and he
therefore, before he would suffer himself to be re-
moved from Bladensburg, made arrangements to be
tdken to a private house, dreading the over-charg-
i~g of the hotels. He grumbled at Mrs. Sangston's
price to me-but she had known his wife, and he
felt if his wound should take a "turn,'~ that she

e would attend him with more than a mercenary care,
ra and a care above a mercenary one he did not think
a himself likely to receive any where else-for he
I had an awful opinion of matters, morals and things
f kn Washington.
In waiting on Horslcy senior, and in calling up-
on his son, at Mrs. Sangston~s, I made the intimate
acquaintance of her son, who knew all the "ropes"
of Washington life; and I became there, too, ac-
qunin ted with Miss Sallie Singleton, who was a
beauty, belle'and fortune, from my native State.-
She was a boarder in the house. Repeatedly
Horsley had pressed me to come to Mrs. Sangs-
ton's, but I did not like to leav't my hotel without
paying my bill; and I did not choose to ask even
Horslcy to lend me the money, as I was actually
ashamed of the amount I owed,-my wine bill, to
say nothing of extras, amounting to twice as much
as my board bill.
Painters talk about having certain persons or
pictures for a study. So had I studies-studies that
had my heart in them-and among those choicest
of the gallery was Miss Virginia Upton and
Miss Sallie Singleton. 1 don't know but what my
heart was at times emulous of a Turk's harem-
that is full of many beauties at once. For though
Martha Jones, "my own lonian Myrrha,~~ and
those later beauties of my acquaintance sometimes
took strong hold of my imagination, and particular-
ly "my own lonian Myrrha;" yet, the full tide of
my feelings was like that of the Mississippi, which
in its many findings seems to run to all the differ-
ent points of the compass, but which yet finds the
Gulf of Mexico-growing the stronger and the
straighter the nearer it approaches its absorbing
ocean.
Miss Singleton was beautiful. She had the
dark eye and the complexion of one "whose blood
is all ~ but then there was a subdued
gentleness and truthfulness in all she said that con-
trasted very much with the badinage and dash of
Miss Upton. Yet there was, perchance, a deeper
spring of pride in the heart of Miss Sallie than intliat
of Miss Virginia. The Carolinian had spent mu~,h
of her time on a retired plantation, where the a~m
of every one was to please her; and what she h ~ad
seen of society had been calculated further to im-

I

I

press her with the conviction that she was to have
her own way. Yet she was subdued and gentle,
not only because it was in some Measure her na-
ture, but also because she had been brought up af-
ter the fashion that to seem subdued and gentle
was to be what a fair Carolinian of her fortune and
beauty ought to be. Her's was a different beauty
from Miss Upton's. The deep tint on her cheek
sometimes wore a hectic look, and there was a
brightness in her eye then that startled you with
its dazzling brilliance. Her tones, as soft as ever
woman uttered, came from lips tremulous with a
shrinking ~ensitiveness, unless their possessor was
aroused; and then, if she felt at all aggrieved, her
voice became commanding, and her rather slight
figure assumed a quiet majesty that was the more
impressive because it was so entirely natural and
so entirely the type of her emotions. A great many
lovers, men of position, wealth and intellect, had
approached Miss Singleton with every homage,~
but she had, according to report, turned a deaf ear
upon all of them.
I was popular with he~, I flattered myself, for
nore reasons than from the fact that I was a Caro-
linian. And the truth is, that not having any de-
sign upon the ladies, and being, as I have said be-
fore, from my soul devoted to female society, I had
entirely a frank, cordial, off-hand, and at the same
time attached manner to them, that I may be al-
lowed to say was taking-I do not mcan to say in
a lover, but in an acquaintance-and likely to win
him the confidence and friendship of the lady to
whom he might devote himself though her feelings
towards him might not wear the least of a warmer
tinge.       -
Crowds of admirers, flatterers and lovers, crowd-
ed the very handsome private parlors of Miss Sin-
gleton to ~ay their court to the Carolina belle.-
Sometimes she was fitful and abstracted, and re-
ceived them like a queen tired of state-and then
she ~vould deny herself, and in the afternoon, when
Sangston was free of his official duties--in fact he
was very often free of them in the morning, as he
was not very steady in his attendance-she would
ask him to read to her, and sit and listen to him
for hours, watching the play of his finn feat urea, as
full of emotion and diffident homage he obeyed her

every wish and Watched her every motion, that he
might anticipate her wishes.
He could not bear to be teased about her. lie
did not seem to aspire to her hand, but he seemed
hopelessly, and yet with a happy forgetfulness of
all but the present, to haunt her presence. Some-
times she would show him a thousand delicate lit-
tle attentions, and ask him for a book, or to mend
a pen, or "please, Mr. Sangston;to ring the hell,"
in a way that made the men of the world and sen-
sualists about her, who loved her all the more be-
cause her glorious beauty had so many golden
charms and whose eagerness in the pursuit had a
double spur, fix their eyes keenly on the two and
-den exchange glances with each other, and scan
the points of their boots, or perchance the spots on
the carpet, when in all probability the least adven-
turous spirit among them would take his leave in
an abrupt manner. At other times, Miss Singleton
would languishingly or abstractedly pass through
the room where Sangston was without apparently
noticing him, to take a loitering ~troll with some
attached of some of the foreign ministers, or with
some idler about town who was seeking office or a
fortune, whichever he could get, a ad staving off his
promises to pay to his landlord and tailor by the
promises of office, which he would assert was to be
fulfilled at the firbt of the next week. It is aston-
ishing how many sets off of this kind, promises
against promises, there are in Washington.
Poor Sangston, if 1 met him at night, I could
always tell what had been the course of Miss
Sangston's conduct through the day. If she had
not noticed him, and had promenaded with one of
those personages, or had gone to a baIl or party with
one of them, he was sure to indulge himself at
night; and more than once I have taken him to my
hotel when he could not take himsclt'homc.
All the above of this chapter has been written for
ray reader, in answe to Miss Upton's remark that
there was Miss Singleton, and her inquiry as to
who that young gentleman was with her? I did
not tell any of it to Miss Upton, for they were
ahead of us on the avenue, and as we drove along
Miss Upton answered her own question-
"Oh! it's young Sangston." And then she pull-
ed the check string and said to me, "Please tell

There be many rivalries in Washington, gentle

and as high up as the presidential chair in all thc

CHAPTER XXIX.
SANG5TON-DEVOTES HIMSELF TO MISS UFTON-CONvER-
*     STATION WITH HIM ABOUT HER-MISS SINGLETON ANt
TIlE WHEREFORE OF TILE CHANGE.
A few days after this delightful drive with Miss
Upton, Sangston called on me late in the evening,
and expressed himself in the most exaggerated terms
of admiration of that lady. I had known that ol
late he frequently visited her; in fact, I had met
him at her house, and I thought the lady was more
than usually kind to him. Miss Singleton I found
was growing cold apparently, and at times haugh-
ty, even supercilious; and Sangston evidently was
surprised at her changed deportment sustaining
itself so long, under which he began to grc~w very
moody. At first, his frequent visited ~o Miss Upton
and her open encouragement of him gave him the
highest spirits, though they were evidently of a
wild and reckless character. lie had the feelings
of a gentleman, and such a delicate sense of the
proprieties of life that, when excited with wine,
he usually hurried away from the presence of the
ladies~though I have known him, when very
much depressed in spirits, t( resort to stimulants
before he went to a party.

)GRAPJIY OF

tI How ill at ease he was with all his gay badinage
about the beauteous Miss Upton. I had some ex-
- perience, and I read him easier than he thought I
a did. My theatrical adventures connected with
I Miss Watson's name, had given, and continued to
3 give me a tremendous eclat among the young men,
and, in fact, it had created no little talk among the
a ladies; while a good many of them believed that
1 there existed an attachment between Alice Clare
I and myself, the impression was that I Jiad behaved
- badly to Alice, and some of the ladies took her
part fiercely, though I never knew that she thank-
ed them for it or ajspreciated it,-nevertheless it
gave me as much eclat with the women as my re-
3 ported deportment with Capt. Merrymen did with
the men. Knowing how sensitive Sangston Was
about the sex, and particularly about Miss Single-
tin, I felt a delicacy in speaking to him as to my
view of matters, but I thought I would talk at him
a little one evening, so I said:
"That Upton girl is a character!~~
"Oh! great, great! magnificent! "lie exclaimed.
"You've heard her history?"
"Oh yes. The tale is here that she fell in love
with some puppy of a lord abroad, but 1 don't be-
lieve a word of it."
"Oh! those who are not up to matters and things
are of the impression that she was desperately in
love with him, but Clements, who was abroad at
the time, tells me it is no such thing; he was inti-
mate with her at that very time-in fact, they say
she was once not indifferent to hjm."
"They say," said [to myself. "1 tell you,
Sangston," I continued aloud, "don't tell on me."
"I will not, on my word," he exclaimed, look-
ing earnestly at me.
"Well, Miss Upton has no particular quantity
of heart to be impressed by any body-she's a flirt
-and all's fish that comes to her net."
"Oh! Russell-what makes you think she's a
flirt?"
"These and these!'1 I exclaimed, putting my
hands to my eyes and ears.
"You don't pretend to say she' has flirted you?3~
"Nc~, sir," 1 replied, provoked: "that's not in
her power-beautiful and fascinating and hewitch
ing as she is. Love's a foregone conclusion with

me.'1 And I sighed, half from my heart and half
in vanity.
"Yes, the actress?"
"No, no, sir. In this world we never appreciate,
until it is' too late, the character of the woman who
really regards us. some Delilah of our imagina-
tion, or Delilah in fact, plays the deuce with us-
reduces us to as blind and as desperate a condition
as Samson, and ' yes us as much."
"I don't understand you."
"It's true," I said-arid then bolted out the in-
quiry: "How get you on with my fair sister of
Carolina-.-.the lady of the Palmetto State-the
eclipsing star in all this constellation of beauty
here in Washington, where beauties most do con-
gregare?~~
A crimson flush passed over Sangstoa's face and
he said,
"I don't get on with her at all-don't talk about
her. Let's drink something-pardon me ifI order
it in your room." I bowed. "Well, the Upton is
a glorious girl, that's a fact. She says she likes
you very much."
"Yes- she says you have a magnetic way with
women, and that you have stood fire so often that
she suspects you think you have a charmed life-
a charmed heart-and she quoted something from
somebody, which I forget."
"Well, she certainly has never tried any spell
upon me, yet am I often spell-hound by her neyer-
theless,-but I think the Palmetto lady is the eclip-
sing one, 5angston.3~
"Many think so," he said, looking down. There
was a pause, and he continued: "That Englishman,
the Mr. Dudley that I have seen you with, he has
almost entirely quit going to sue Miss Upton and
devotes hi:nself entirely to Miss Singleton. I tell
you, i{ ussel," and he tried to laugh-oh! what a
hollow laugh it was-"She used to keep entirely
to her private parlor, and sometimes would not see
any body for days, at least in the afternoon; and
she spent most of her evenings there, at the harp
or piano, and now she spends all' her indoor hours
in the public parlor-has had her harp brought
down there, and your humble ~ here
he bit his lips-"is not even noticed by her as she

passes through the room or takes a seat to enter-
tain the crowd of gentlemen bowing around her."
"Have you piqued her in any way?"
"Piqued her!" and here he stopped, having, I
thought, at first the impulse from wounded feelings
to insinuate he had, and thus account for her change
of manner, but the truth asserted its right and he
said, filling ,his glass with the sparkling liquid
which had been introduced at his request-"No;
piqued her-if any thing I have been her slave to
fetch arid carry, and she asked me the other day-
I blush to tell it, but she did-she asked me the
other day if I Was now going of errands for Miss
Upton."
"How came you to be so intimate with Miss
Upton all at once? you have cut me out there de-
cidedly"
"Ah! Russell, every body knows that you don't
care a fig ahnut any of our ladies here. You're a
fortune-my father squandered oner and I am a
poor clerk, worse than a beggar. What care you
for any of the women here, with the love of that
glorious actress, who outshines them all?"
"No, Sangston, she does not outshine them all,
not even as an actress-at least in private theatri-
cals and private acting. My dear fellow, all the
world's a stage, and all the men and women mere-
ly players. I'm not speaking of Miss Watson,
mark you,-who is siincerely my friend, and whom
I respect profoundly-but hang me if I mean to let
any of these women play upon me, if I can help
it."
"Nor 1, nor I," exclaimed Sangston, and then
his voice sunk to a tone of touching despondency
as he remarked, "but what woman would care to
play upon me?"
I wanted from my soul to tell him that Miss Up-
ton might care, for the frolic of the thing; but I
reflected it would only wound his feeling~ in the
mood he was in, and I forbore; but I determined to
devote myself more particularly to Miss Singleton,
and .1 thought, when Horslcy returned with remit-
tances from my aunt so that I could settle my bill,
that I ~vould take rooms at Mrs. Sangston's.

'I'ime, that: never plays truant from his duty,
kept on his way. My remittances came through
Florsely, who wrote me a laconic note, saying that
my aunt Betsy had "forked ovet" without com-
plaint the five hundred dollars, (I was provoked
with myself that I did not get him so ask for a
thousand) and that he would write at length soon,
or see but still staid the hotel, meaning'
me;         I      at
to take rooms at Mrs. S~ngstoa's some time or
other. But I frequently called upon Miss Single-
ton, and Miss Upton, with some temper, had jested
me more than once upon my increasing admiration
for the fair Carolinian.
"She'll fling you off as she did poor Saugston,"
she remarked with a peculiar smile.
"I'm told that you took him off from the fair
Carolinian," I said, "if he was ever on with her-
or rather that you attempted to console him for
her cruelty, and grew tired of the care of a broken
heart which you could not mend."
"Tired! poor fellow, he is like a battle-door among
the ladies-driven from one to the other-because
no one receives him but to show the skill with
which site can throw him back again. 1 understand
he was turned out of office last week-I hope it is
not so. He used to visit me a great deal in office
hours, but when I suspected that he might be neg-
lecting his official ditties I discouraged his visits.
Indeed, to speak out, Mr. Russell, I hear and .1
fear that his habits are very bad."
And this was the way poor Sangston's ruisfor-
tunes and faults were disc~issed by two who were
his intimates, arid one of them at least, his well-
wisher and friend.
It was true that he had been dismissed f~onn his

OGRAPHY OF

ton I had not seen but once since his dismissal,
when he was much excited; tind day after day
passed away and I did not see him, though 1 often
wondered where he was, and I expected certainly
to meet him. Some new acquaintances, to whom
I felt myself bound to attend, had engrossed hit
visiting hours, and I had not seen Miss Singleton
since Sangston's removal-when one day I receiv-
ed an urgent note from her requesting that I would
call and see her as soon as possible.
I accordingly betook myself to Mrs. Sangaton's
boarding house, wondering what Miss Singleton
could want with me, and was shown into her pri-
vate parlor.
There was the harp over which I had seen her
so frequently bend, and I noticed the many little
evidences, even in the very placing of the smallest
ornaments, which showed that the presiding ge
nius of the Itlace was a refined and intellectual wo-
man. This matter of love, thought I, is a mar-
vellous matter, for I certainly feel not the least
trepidation ta awaiting the entrance of this most
celebrated belle of the South; wlten, were it Alice
Clare whom I expected, ~r Miss Watson, or even
Martha Booth 1 am satisfied that by its increased
pulsation I should certainly feel that I had a heart.
While I was reflecting in this way, proud of the
self-possession I felt and of the fact that Miss Sin-
gleton could raise no thrill in my tumultuous tem-
perament, which I could not, like a skillful mana-
ger of fiery steeds control to my advantage, t4e
lady entereil the room. I certainly was struck
with art altered look in her. Though not a cold
morning, (the winters are never severe in Wash-
ington,) she was closely wrapped in a large shawl,
and her quiet manner had a subdued and earnest
look about it that I thought indicated some peculiar
state of feeling in the lady.
"It is a cold rooming, NIr. Russell," she said, as
I rose at her entrance; "You are a stray from yooi
allegarice to South Carolina, if we may jttdge front
your visits to the daughters of your native State."
"No! I acknowledge~ you as my fair representa-

~peai loId)y, but there is something which I can-
uot exactly tell you."
"Vet' cannot tell me all," I said, looking at her
In a sertutenizing manner.
"Why try to divine that which I will not tell,
then, Mr. Russell?"
"1 will not. It will be my greatest pleasure to
serve you-and only what you would have me
know would I ~ and I could not but smile
again.
"I understand your smile, sir."
"Indeed then you understand more than I do."
"Enough,"-but she looked annoyed, and a
little of the self-will of a petted woman came to her
brow as she said, almost in a peremptory tone-
"Will you do what I ask, Mr. Russell?"
Certainly-as I have said, any thing that you
ask I will do."
"A thought strikes me. Suppose you send it in
an anonymous letter-say that the party writing
the letter felt himself indebted that much to his
father and sent it to him. Cannot you manage
then to see him when he gets the letter; or, if von
please, get it for hint from the posi-uffice, carry it
to him, and see that in his recklessness Ite does not
spend that too, but takes it to his mother, brings it
here and reforms his habits. I wonder if he re-
rnetnbers he was to go with me to the next levee?"
"Doubiless he does, Miss Singleton.' You know
what your influence is over hint-exert it, will
you not?"
"Mr. Russell-how can 1, a young lady, exert
it properly?"
I smiled again as I replied, "Easily, Miss Single-
ton-speak to ~Sangston with the frankness you
have spoken to me."
She arose, and walking to the window looked
out into the street, and then turning to me she
said:
"Here, here's pen ink and paper, write the let-
ter, 1 pray 3Oti, and enclose these notes to'Mr.
Sttngston. I utteant to buy a fbolish otrttament with
this '~ hich I saw In the jeweler's window but yes
tarolay. ' It ~&amp;as a single stat of silver with a beau-
tiful diamond in its centre. I thought it' wotild
ettit Carolina, my bold native State, and that I
would ~ ear it to tue levee and niake it flesh in old
Bickory's eyes."

"If you flash it in old Hickory's eyes," I said,
"I fear you will only make them flash with anger
when you call on him."
Miss Singleton replied, looking at me with a
dignity and an earnestness which surprised me-
"Over brave natures a woman always exerts an
influence. It is to me a salient point in the old
chief's character that he pays so much respect to
my sex, and always has paid it. His wife, who
was quite a common-place person, he treated with
every kindness, with devoted tenderness, and it is
to) his honor. Too many of the great men here,
who pretend to think very harshly of the old chief
and of his private character, might do well to imi-
tate him in this."
"Well, Miss Singleton," I said with emphasis,
"Do you not feel that the lesson-pardon me, let
me say lesson-..-you read me just now upon devo-
ting myself to fashionable frivolities might have a
little of a moral in them for the fair speaker her-
self?"
"Well ~'uut, sir. Yes, I deserve it-I came home
from a heartless party last night-.-.and felt that I
deserved it. Oh! the frivolities, the follies, to say
nothing of the vices herel-but the letter, Mr.
Russell."
I took my seat at her table. As I arranged the
paper to write, she threw herself back in a rocking
chair and took up one of Scott's novels, which lay
on the table. I wrote as follows:
"Sir: I feel myself to be indebted to your late
father some two hundred dollars. 1 have heard
that you have been removed from office, and I sup-
pose you need the money. I tlterefore return it to
you, glad that I can relieve nty cotiscience by so
doing, arid happy that I have it to send to you in an
emergency. It is not necessary for you to know
who 1 am; be satisfied that I am, though I say so
aronymously,                Youa ~
"Will that olo'?" said I, reading it aloud to Miss
'Singleton; "or shall I tell him to devote it to the
specific ofiico'.-.-to, give it to his mother in payment
of the sum he has lost at the gaming table?"
"As you think best," she replied.
Alter a nioment's reflection, I remarked:
"I will setod titis, and put it in the post office, so
Lhat it utay have the postmark. I will contrive to
e with htirn"'when he gets it."

WILLIAM RUSSELL.

I enclosed the notes which Miss Singleton hand-
ed me,(confusedly, I don't know why. unless I
thought that men should do such things for men,
and not wait for women to do them,) and sealed
aoddireeted the letter. I now took up my hat to
depart, when Miss Singleton said-
"I have paid you a great compliment-do you
know it?"
"In the deepest recesses of my soid, where the
fact of this interview lives in silence, I know it,"
I replied. She gave me her hand-to her infinite
surprise I bowed low and kissed it as I took it.
"Pardon me, Miss Singleton," I said with dig-
nity, "it was not the beautiful hand which I kiss-
ed, but the charity and mercy enshrined there."
"Ab! but you can say pretty things, Mr. Wil-
liam Russell," exclaimed Miss Singleton, as she
gently withdrew her hand so lingeringly that I
hardly felt it leave mine, as her surprise gave place
is a blush and a smile. And Mr. William Russell
thought so too, as the proud girl looked after him
kindly as he withdrew. Then the image of Alice
Clare flashed through my mind. "Yes," said Ito
myself, descending at once from the sublime to the
ridiculous, ("there is but one step" said Napolean,
and ridicule is the test of truth,) the proverb says
"there are as good fish in the sea as were ever
caught"-and so there be doubtless; but Mrs. Glass,
in her renowned cookery book, ere she begins to
expatiate upon cooking the individual of the finny
tribe upon which you mean to gratify your refined
and luxurious appetite, says: "First catch your
fi~~*~) Here was a thought for me that saddened
my steps. "These women," said I to myself
"what enigmas they are. This Miss Singleton is
a magnificent girl-I wonder if I could please her.
Whyshe must be a little in for it with Sangston;"
and then, in such an event, for the first time the
great alteration which would take place in the Poor
fellow's earthly condition in bed and board occurred
to me in its full force, and I hastened to find him
and fulfil my errand.

WHAT MISS SINGLETON SAID-REGSETS-ThE STIRR-

DREAM-SANG-TI'S COMES TO ME WITH A NOTE FRM
MISS SINGLETON-ALICE CLARE iN WASIIINGTOW-I
MEET HER-MISS UPTON.
On inquiry, I found that Sangston had been dis-
3ipating all the week, and was then sick at the
bachelor establishment of some of his friends-a
number of young officials. Woro and wan and
wasted, I found him in bed, agonized at his condi-
tion and foil of remorse for his conduct. I did my
best to cheer him, asked him what the news was,
and, quick as thought, he ordered the boy to go to
the post office, observing, "Maybe th~ re's a letter
for me. A man in my condition is al~a3s appre-
hending that something has happened to him and
wishes to know the worst."
The letter came. So overjoyed was Sangston,
that he leaped from his bed, and, without scarcely
saying a word to me, except to mention that a debt
had been paid him, which was a great relief in his
present condition, he asked me to excuse him,
and hurriedly departed, shaking all over with ner-
vous anxiety to be a~ay.
Poor fellow! I thought, I ought to say something
to him, but in his then condition I reflected it would
be of no use-and especially as his mind appeared
tobe absorbed in the one idea of the "relief" which
the reception of the money had given him. After
he left, and I sat alone in the bachelor apartment
of the luxurious young officials of the "Hall," who
were at their duties or elsewhere, it occurred to
me that he might be infatuated with the idea that
as he had had one streak of luck in receiving the
money, that Fortune, the jade, was now at last
about to take his side, and he had gone to a gaming
house.
I entered the street, and learned from a mutual
acquaintance that Sangston had gone home. Re-
lieved in my mind, I returned to my hotel, and
found an invitation to dino witji a "mess" of South-
ern members, who were all quartering together. At
the appointed hour I went.
What Miss Singleton had said to me about my
wasting my energies and talents in frivolities had


90

made a deep impression on me. Every moment
when I was n~t thinking of Sangston her remarks
were in my mind; and when I thought of Alice
Clare, I had the feeling that should I win high
position, she would surely and willingly and proud-
ly be mine.
Ambition, a giant in my nature, that had been
slumbering for years, began to stir me to nobler ef-
foits than that of histrionic representations or tri-
umphs in socie:y. Oh! I began to think now most
seriously of what Moore has said of his own gifts:
"'1~aients made
Hap'ly for pure and high designs,
But oft, like Israel's incense, laid
Upon unholy earthly shrines."
and thought how natural it was for the idle and the
voluptuous Ciesar, the "loose girdled boyS~ to

don me, dear reader, but the "spilt milk" of the
past-the recollection of misspent hours, to say no-
thing of vicious ones-how they haunted me. I
felt myself in the ac omplishments of the speaker,
in the outward graces, and even in the gifts of
language and illustration and adornment, to be in-
finitely superior to many of the men around me
who had won famous positions as politicians, law-
yers and statesmen-and here, I thought, am I, as
idler-and worse, nut even trying to win the only
woman I have ever deeply loved, so as to secure
myself domestic enjoyment and happiness, though
I have no other.
How these revulsion of feeling pressed upon
my brain arid he;;rt as I trod the avenue and hur-
ried to the Capitol to listen to one of those stirring
debates which the nullification movements of some
of the Southern States was then arousing, and in

weep over the victories of Alexander. who, at his j which the champion of South Carolina stood alone

age, had accomplished empire, when he had ac-
complishied nothing but debts which he could not
pay.
Often and often had these reflections flashed over
my mind like a dark cloud, and as often did I dis-
pel them by plunging into society, and flattering
myself that I was playing the epicurean philoso-
pher, and carrying out the true aims of life by liv-
ing according to the saying, "While we live let us
live."
Mingling infmately with the stirring politicians
and statesmen about me, and flattered by many of
them for the eclat which I had in refined society,
a matter which some of them did not understand
and all men more or less envy, and particularly men
of the world,! at first mistook my position for one (if
real importance to more than the mere butterflies of
fashion and excitement which a winter in Wash-
ington never fails to bring together. But itarinoy-
ed rae deeply, and the annoyance Qhough not on-
mixed wit Ii a certain gratification) struck still deep-
er when not only the men but the women told me
that I was wasting my talents. I began to find
out that the very idlest and most fashionable of the
women themselves would appreciate me more; in-
finitely more indeed, did I hold the same rank in
the s'ri~e of men in the sterner struggles of life
which I he'd in the drawing room a rid the saloon.
Ahi how I began to curse say wasted hours! Par-

like Ivanhoe in the lists at Ashby, with no Black
sluggard to cry to the rescue.
I should nor be particular in dates were they all
before me, when, indeed, I have no memory for
them, as I tell stern truths in my reminiscences,
that might offend; l.'et I well remember the keen
encounters between Mr. Webster and more than
one of the southerners, and although my heart
went in many things with the nullifiers, I must say
that my convictions went then, as they go now,
with the Union, heart and soul, whenever that
question was touched upon in debate. Chataufiri
and says in his memoirs, that although he was a
Bourbonist and hated Napoleon, yet, when he heard
the thunder of the allied armies at Waterloo
piercing his retirement, that after listening to the
contending hosts for awhile, his love for France
prevailed and he could not but pray that her sons
night triumph let who would lead them At first
I had sonic sich feelings as these, yet I always
looked upon tile Union as such a sacred institution,
that it was her bravery and prowess rather than
her supposed or real injuries which made me
t)f ten, at least in the badinage of conversatit)n, side
with Soulla Carolina as to her right to secede.
Yes, I began indeed to feel that amy life was
"idleness alt;~~ and more than once I found myself
wide and restlessly awake in the dearest hour of
the night, alternately reprox~hing myself for throw~

ing away my time, or forming some scheme of
study and ambition. Yes, I said, I must break this
thraldom of society and dissipation which surrounds
rae-I must act, act-do something-and I must
devote myself to hard study.
If I had been desperately poor, and poverty had
been pressing me on with this necessity as well as
a feverish and I began to fear morbid ambition, how
soon I should have seized the oar-and for a good
reason, tor it then would have been a struggle for
life as well as for fame.
But as it was, in these alternations of feeling,
made the more turbid by my thoughts of Alice
Clare, I gave myself up too often to wild company
and late hours, and had, of course, to suffer all the
pangs of consequent physical wretchedness and re-
morse.
I am among the breakers yet, rho~ght I, as one
day I flung myself on my horse and galloped to-
wards Bladensburg to see my old landlord there,
and spend a day or two away from the excitement
of the city and recruit a little, for I was really
worn out and sick. Yes, I am among the breakers
yet-I live without an object in life, and I shall be
a wreck if I do not have an object-for be the day
ever so bright and the sky ever so clear, whither
am I steering, whither am I steering-the cloud
must come at last, arid what aim have I, what ob-
ject? where is my port?
With head ache and heart ache, I reached the
Bladensburg hotel, and asking for a room, I threw
myself upon the bed, and was soon in a wild and
dreamy sleep.
The agony of that dream I remember now. I
saw Alice Clare walking arm in arm with Peter-
son. I said to myself, why do you idle away your
time here-hir in my dream I seemed to recognize
the facts of my oWn position just as they were-
when your heart's hope is at stake. Oh! what an
agony was it for me to feel that she had a prefer-
ence fo0r L1eterson! I thought she avowed it to me-
[thought, while she was walking with him, she
avowed it to me-it seemed to me th~r her look
had a voice, an audible voice, and told it to me.-
I gazed at Peterson, and thought I saw his look of
triumph, a~ud I writhed in jealous madness as I
thought I saw him press her lip and hold her to
his heart, while she, all coynesh gone, looked into

91

his face and returned his caress with interest! Yes,
with interest, I said to myself, so full of an over-
flowing fondness is her heart for him. And I have
been a fool from my very childhood-a fool. How
many stolen hours have they had together that I
knew nothing of?
I was aroused with a suffocating sensation in my
throat. Ha! thought I, this is all a dream;-my
neck-cloth was only too tight-"Pray you, undo
this button"-in my mad trick of quoting theatri-
cals quoting old Lear. And then I threw myself
down on my face, with my hands over it, on the bed,
while scalding and big tears came to my relief, and
trickled through my fingers. Resolve me this
again, ye who have skill in these matters.
I was aroused from my burst of emotion by a
rap at my door. The broad red sun was just set-
ting, and it had been shining in my face. That,
with my buttoned collar, had as much to do ~rirh
my dream, maybe, as anything else. There is no
telling-I have puzzled over such things often, but
could never make anything out of them after all.
Yet a kind of superstition within us tells us that
the "stuff" they are made of has something of
life's hues and mortal destiny in them, in spite of
the poet 'a reasoning:
are but interludes which Fancy makes;
IV lion nionarch reason sleeps this mimic wakes,
)ontounds a medley of' disjointed things,
I~ court of' coblee; cud a mob or kings."
"Is [lot the past all shadow?" says a less reason-
ing but not less imaginative poet. Yes, but can
the future be foreshadowed? or have our dreams
anything to do with realities except that they are
the objectless vagaries born of them? But as I was
saying, I was interrupted by a rap at my door. I
called out, as I took rime to recover myself-
"in (me moment-who's that?"
And the voice of Sangston cheerfully sounded in
reply: "'Tis I, Hamlet the Dane."
In a moment more I flung the door open, and
shook Sangston cordially by the hand. He looked
a little worn, but his smile had no sadness in it.
"I have," he explained, "a missive for you from
Miss Singleton, who bids you to a partV to-night,
and she bade me find you arid deliver h in person.

to fulfil Miss Singleton's commands. Here is her
note."
I broke the seal and read:
Ma. RtrssaLL:-As you have more than once
announced that you owe your allegiance to Caroli-
na, and particularly to her representative, ourself,
therefore be it known to you, that you are bidden
to-night to present yourself at our rooms, that you
may meet there a lady of the Monumental City,
not unknown to you-Miss Alice Clare-to whom
you have been recreant, if report says true, and to
whom we now give you an opportunity to present
yourself at a meeting of our mutual friends to be
holden in our parlor to-night. Itis proper for us
to saythat we have not told the lady of our inten-
tion to bid you to our presence; so you may fashion
for yourself your own mode of presenting yourself
to her-an opportunity which, maybe, her know-
ledge of your coming would not give you. We
have hopes that our indiscretion will not shatter
into fragments your flinty and false heart-and if
it does, Miss Upton and other ladies that you and
we know of, ourselves of course being omitted in
the mention, shall do their best, under our com-
mands, to gather together the fragments and so to
reunite them that they shall be broken never again,
at least by the same person.

ry Sangston-
I read and re-read the note, while Sangeton
amused himself with brushing the dust from his
clothes with a whisp which he had taker1 from the
table.
"Alice Clare in Washington!" I said to myself,
"and what of W?-is Washington so very far frem
Baltimore-but a few hour's ride, and I months in~
Washington without seeking once to see her! But
we have quarrelled-at least we parted coldly.-
What could have brought her here?" As I asked
n~yself this question I turned to Sangaton and en-
quired:
"When did Miss Clare come to Washington,
Sangston?~~
"The day before yesterday."
"Where is she?"

"At my ~
"Who's with her'?"
"Two or ,three ladies-they have come to Mrs.
P-'s party."
"Any gentlemen?"
"Yes: a Mr. Peterson and Mr. J~mper.~~
"Peterson! Perterson! What kind of a looking
fellow is he?"
"0! he's all the go with the women-he's a
first rate looking fellow-he knows you-..-I heard
him talking with Miss Clare about you, and regret
you were so wild."
"Regret I was so wild?"
"Yes, he said it, for I heard him. Miss Single-
ton joked Miss Clare about you, hut she made no
reply. She drew on her gloves and went sailing
down the avenue yesterday afternoon; didn't you
see them?"
"See them! No, I was in Alexandria. Where
do they stop?"
"At my mother's. Faith, I don't in fact un-
derstand hese women, at least those who think
the most of themselves; but I tell you Russell, she
is very sweet on Mr. Peterson. You should have
seen them yesterday afternoon walking down the'
broad avenue-the whole crowd gazed after them
in ad~riiration-they were considered the hand-
somest couple in Washington."
'ro cool the pressure on ~my brain of conflicting
passions and hot blood, for it seemed, as 1 lifted a
glass of water to my lips, to be bursting with its
load of agonizing reflections-aroused jealousy and
unrequited love,.-.-I plunged my head into a basin
of water, and laved tiiy brow and chest before I
suffered myself to say a word.
"Yes! and he was sweet upon her, you say?~~
"Indeed he was. Ye little fishes! hut Russell,
she is beautiful [tell you now; she slew the fel-
lows right and loft as she walked down the avenue.
And she kept a keen look out-maybe she was
looking for you. I have heard Miss Singleton jest
you about her; and that-yes, this is the very lady
~-.and that she understood she liked you. It was
on account of this very lady she called you a gay
Lothario, was it not?"
"Not that I remember. What! do you mean to
say that she looked about, looked around, as if she
was looking for some one?"

WILLIAM
"No-but every body was looking at hex4~, that's
certain, and she could not be unconscious of it.-
How she laughed and chatted with that Mr. Peter-
son. But he's a fine looking fellow. Russell, he's
older than you-he would give his two eyes for
her. These women, for the soul of me, 1 can't
understand them."

"They don't understand themselves" I exclaim- with a certain stiff-necked puritanical kind of pre-

ed~ with an additional phrase which it is not ne-
cessary to repeat. "They don't understand them-
selves, or wont. And as for their constancy and
truthfulness-I don't believe they know the mean-
ing of the words, unless they see it illustrated in
the lives of their lovers. Coquetry and deceit they
understand though.~~
"Why, Russell, is this your opinion of women?"
I remained silent, and Sangston continued:
"I tell you what it is, in my opinion there is no~
judging of women at all-no knowing what they
do. Russell, I want to have a talk with you to-
night after the party."
"Agreed, agreed,~~ said I. Come, let's to horse."
"Let's drink 5o~~thing,~~ said Sangston, as we
descended to the bar-room, and eur horses were
brought out to our orders.
"Not a drop, not a drop,~~ I exclaimed.
I thought of what Peterson had said of my dis-
sipated habits. and the desire to drink was crushed
in me as you would crush a serpentA~as you would
strike life out of it with your heel.
"Yes," thought I to myself, as we pitt spur to
our horses and darted ahead side by side in silence,
each occupied with his own thoughts-~Sangston
thinking of Miss Singleton and I of Alice Clare-
"Yes, Mr. Peterson, I flung you once sky high.
when I was a tx~y-yes, "Willie Russell" did,
"Mr. Peterson"-and why cannot he do it again?
0! 1 was a fresh-lipped innocent boy then-what
am I now? But what if I am changed; the change
has been the change to knowledge if it has been to
sin-and why may I not win her yet?"
Here my thoughts took wildest flight, and I
thought of all that had ever passed between Alice
and myself, and the suspicion haunted me that I had
fatally fooled away the greatest chance of being
most blest in a beautiful wojnan's love that ever a
man had; and oh the bitterness of the self-reproach
that seemed like fiery serpents to coil about my'

vision which held me just so in collar and neck-
cloth, and which annoyed me exceedingly. How
these little matters put one out! and, when great
matters have already tost us into a tempest, how
we strive to give vent to these feelings in this
shallow brook of little things which overflows it.

(9 o'clock) for going would never come; and when
it did come, I thought what a flurry I was in, and
wondered it had come so soon! These confessions
may seem strange, but they are true; and a person
of calm and quiet temperament cannot, maybe, un-
derstand why I should have been so moved,-but
those of the more fiery clay will understand all
about it. But to the party.
As I approached the lodgings of Miss Singleton,
in the hack which I had ordered, I saw . the house
all lighted up, and a crowd of carriages were be-
fore the door and some distance beyond it, waiting
their turn to be delivered of their burdens. My
impatience would tiot let me wait, so I alighted,.
and proceeded to Mrs. Sang~ton~s front door. lust
as I reached it a coachman was hurriedly throwing
down the steps of his vehicle, and a gentleman de.
ascended therefrom whom I instantly recognized to
be Peterson. A laughing voice within said merri-
ly-oh, how that light tone brought sorrow to my
heart-
"Be not in such a hurry, driver;-for mercy's
sake, Mr. Peterson, give me your attention; Miss
Upton has not come yet, and Miss Singleton can
be seen all the evening. I declare, I have got my
dress entangled in these odious steps."
"Go ahead!" shouted out the driver of the car-
riage immediately behind that of'Peterson's; "what
are you blocking up the way for?"
"Wait a motqent," e~c~aimed Peterson, ttirning to

I never was fastidious in tile adjustment of my
toilette, but I certainly expended more than my
usual care upon it, and my hand was tremulous
with emotion as I arranged and re-arranged differ-
ent portions of my dress, and found particular fault

the map, who, seated on his coach-box, was crack
ing his whip impatiently. A~ he turned, the horse~
in his carriage pranced wildly, and Alice at rh~
same moment made a step down. She missed
catching his hand which was held out to her, with
his head turned towards the carriage behind, and
she would have been thrown on her face on the
pavement had I not sprang to her assistance and
caught her completely in my arms as she fell heav-
ily towards me.
£ forgot everything but that it was "my beauti-
ful my own" Alice Clare whom I had caught in
my arms; and as her calash fell from her brow and
her shawl from her dazzling shoulders, which, in
the low drees for the evening, threw back the lights
like glittering marble, I pressed her to my heart
and felt that I at least then possessed her, if but for
a moment, in spite of Mr. Peterson.
"That person has insulted me!" exclaimed
Alice, springing away from me-and at this in
slant, as we stood full in the~blaze of the light from
the front door, we all recognized each other, ~nd
Alice exclaimed
"William Russell!"
"William Russell," I said, "is incapable of in-
suIting any lady, and is answerable to any gentle-
man in the premises!"
Alice half raised her hand I thought, perchance
to shake hands with me; but Peterson took it,
placed it under his arm, and taking her calash and
shawl from the driver, who had picked them up,
they entered the house.
I stood on the spot for some moments, with a
glow of impulses strangely mixed, and I wished
from my soul that Peterson would take it up. "Ha!
perhaps," I said to myself, "Alice, for sake of his
safety, not for mine, may make him promise not to
notice my remark, and he will save his courage
and his carcass together."
Just then the next carriage drove up, and Miss
Upton called out;
"Is that you, Mr. Russell'? And whe was the
lady whom you caught so tenderly in your arms?
I was looking at you! I fear my impatience in
telling my driver ~o make haste caused her some
inconvenience, though your natural gallantry cer-
tainly availed yourself of it-her little misstep.-
You gentlemen always avail yourselves of our

- missteps!" and she laughed knowingly and mis-
s chievously.
"Po you speak from experience, Miss Upton?"
I could not but enquirer.
"Oh! you rude creature-no! How many mtre
I ladies do you mean to insult to-night, sir? Wait,
driver; let the persons behind wait-yoi see what
has arisen already from over haste. It is a pity,
Mr. Russell~ that you could not do with the lady
what the sailor did with the one who was crossing
the muddy street, and whom he picked up and
carried over: 'Oh! you rude brute,' she exclaimed,
'let me alone!' 'Certainly, madam,' he replied;
and he bore her back again, and placed her where
he found her."
"I would willingly bear her back again for the
sake of the burden, and return with her again and
again, like the repetition of Juliet's "good night,"
I replied.
"You most extravagant inns, you," exclaimed
Miss Upton, laughing heartily: "The girls must
vote you a medal made from the fragments ef the
broken hearts which your-compliments have shat-
tered, and each of them must contribute a lock of
hair wherewith you may wear it gracefully round
your neck and next your heart."
Her sarcastic and ringing laugh stung me a lit-
tIe, but I called dandyism and nonchalance to my
aid, and said:
"That would be a cruelty-I should be killed
by the quantity,-smorhered by i~he weight of
the medal and the hair, as Tarpeia was by the
jewelry of the soldiery. Will you contribute?"
The lady had, in the meanwhile, in the most
leisurely way, descended from her carriage and
halted on the pavement by the side 6f the gentle.
man who attended her, whom I did not recognize.

three gentlemen, and she turned to them and said:'
"Am I not as impartial as justice herself? If
there had only been two of you gentlemen, you

continued, ascending the steps, surrounded by the
strangers,,for such I took them to be: "Coiitrib

would contribute, but no~ to your vanity. My lock
should go to make a chain of another character, you
false one-it would vulgarly be called a rope-and
you merit a hempen one, you traitor to true hearts! ~
And'she disengaged herself from the gentlemen,
and tripping up to rue she whispered, "Why have
you not been to see me? Miss Clare will be here
to-night;" and again joining the group of gentle-
men; she entered the hall.
"Well," thought I, as I compressed my lips.
half in wrath and half in vanity, "How matters
and things are misunderstood in this world." Yet
do I confess it, the misunderstanding of matters and
things relative to myself gave a spur to my pride
and a momentary gaiety to my spirit, which, like
the stimulus of alcohol, I feared and in part felt,
could not be kept up; but which made me drink
the deeper of the 'draught, nevertheless;-and so I
too entered the brilliant assemblage, where, I doubt
not, there were more mashers than one.

NOVEL GROUNDS FOR INSTITUTING A SUIT AT LAW-
THE SOCIETY OFVIASHiNGTON.
The crowd was so great within that it was with
difficulty one could make any headway whatever.
It was a perfect squeeze-a jam. I asked where
Miss Singleton was, and was informed that the far-
thestroom held the cynosure of the evening. I4ook-
ed around for Miss Upton; but, with that ready tact
for which she was remarkable, she had made the
crowd give way to her and her attendants, and she
had, doubtless, already reached the inner sanctua-
ry.
I stood twirling about my opera Cal) and glancing
13

RUSSELL.                                95
at my gloves, in the most nonchalent way imagi-
nable, but it was merely exciteau3flt letting o2~
steam, and pretending to be perfectly up to things,
and too patrician to be annoyed by such matters.
My opera cap, by the by, let me say, was a
"thing of beauty." It was fashioned by the deli-
cate hand of Miss Singleton herself, audi presented
to me as a token of her regard and recognition of
me as a South Carolinian. It was of beautiful
black velvet, with the Palmetto wrought on it in
gold, and a single star rising over it in glittering
silver. Proud was I of that opera cap, for not a
man in Washington, and I was not slow to believe
in the wide world, could boast of a similar favor
from her fair hand. It touched my pride of heart
too deeply to talk about, but as the "fellows" ad-~
mired it, who were waiting entrance like myself,
it was a delight of mine to answer their eager in-
quiries as to where I got it in a way that had an
histrionic effect in it, from which I have thought
the happiest producer of "points" might catch a
hint.
"Miss Singleton made it for me."
"What! the 'Carolina star~~your fair representa-
tive, as you call her, Russell?" said the Honorable
Mr. Dudley.
"Where did she get it? It is beautiful."
"Get it? Miss Singleton made and presented
it to me," I replied, holding it carelessly in my
hand, almost a~ if it would fall from it, and yet as
firmly and as dearly as 1 held my heart's blood.
"You are a lucky fellow, Russell."
"Men have so accounted me, Mr. Dudley, more
than once-yet,. if put upon my oath," I said, and
here I spoke from my heart, "I do not know that
I should so account myself."
The calm Englishman, who had seen the best
society of the world, and who, doubtless, had ex-
perienced the play and the storm of the passions,
looked at me with a quiet smile, that had a sly
meaning in i~, I thought, and said:
"Every heart knoweth its own bitterness." ~
Not expecting such a reply, I felt myself blush
for the moment, knowing the "bitterness" of mine,
and said
"True, sir. A lady's favors are sometimes like
a child's gifts, given and taken back again."

she took me in! It cost me four hundred dollars a

about suing her-recovering back that money s

I burst into a laugh.
"By gracious it's a fact-under false pretences 1
-under the pretence of receiving my attentions,
and then flinging me high and dry. I can't afford
to lose the money, Russell. I believe I could re-
cover it, though she is a ferne concert, as you call
it-could'nt I?"
"I'm no lawyer," I replied; "I can't tell;~~ and
[laughed heartily. "How came you to be all\
alone, walking to the paxty?"
"Why, Peterson was engaged to attend Miss
Clare, and he did'nt want any body with him of
course, you know, and I never interfere. The fact
is that my face is awfully flushed, and I thought
I'd get the redness out of it by walking in the open
air. Russell, it is actually awful to have one of
your flushing faces-it is a providential visitation."
"It is a wino and brandy visitation you mean,"
1 replied.
"No,. I assure you not. I scarcely ever take any
thing now-a-days. To be sure my face is a little
flushed here in Washington, but it is the change
of climate! "'

I could not but smile at Jumper, who evidently
ad no intention of quitting himself. But so it is
ithis world; we can all see over our own faults
nd vices most distinctly the vices and faults of
ur friends.
"Yes," said I to myself, as I walked to and fro, -
olding Jumper's arm, while the fresh, keen, night
ir cooled my excited frame, "Yes, I have been a
l~jve of passion and the follower of frivolities long
nough. My histrionic mania and consequent dis-
ipation nearly wrecked me-and here, in Wash-
ngton, my vanity and indulgences have brought
ne nothing but remorse; while men, and women
oo, wonder why William Russell does not achieve
something for himself besides the hollow applause
3f mere butterfly worldlings whom he despises.-
Oh! if Alice Clare were only mine, I thought,
with her "fair spirit for my minister" and her
pure bosom for my pillow', how I should despise
and loathe the life I've led, which will not bear
the record. Strange, I thought to myself, as we
passed to and fro, that Jumper is so silent." And
then, as the sound of music came. upon m~ ear
from the ball room, I thought that Alice was dan-
cing with Peterson, perchance, or telling some one
that I insulted bet. No, no, not that; she certain-
ly was not angry when she discovered that it was
I who caught her. What are you thinking aboUt,
Jumper?"
"About you, Russell-you have a big reputa-
tion here."
"Aye!"
"Fact, indeed. Miss Singleton took Miss Clare,
Peterson and myself to call upon Mrs. Madison.
yesterday, and the old lady asked after you,~and
said you were the best mannered man in Wash-

short with me on that very matter once."
"What matter?"
"Why you and Miss Watson. When our the-
atrical mania first seized us, Miss Watson and you
made a deal of talk, and Miss Clare grew furious
about it to me one day when I said I thought you
liked the Watson."
"Ab! did she?"
'Well, she did'nt do anything else! She did
not speak to me for some time, but as I never heard
that she said~any thing about it, you may be as-

"It's a glorious night-how merrily the music
sounds-let's go in. 1 judge by this time that
many of the M. C.'s and the office seekers have
gone to the Secretary's, and we shall find an easier
opportunity of presenting ourselves to Miss Single-
ton."
It W2\S indeed a brilliant assembly. The crowd
taken off by the Secretary's party had just thinned
enough to give one an opportunity of passing
through it with case; and the first l)eople in Wash-
ington, strangers and citizens, had congregated
there.
There a~ something exceedingly attractive in
Washington society. It has been very much the
fashion with persons who know nothing about it
to speak very much against it. And so they should
if their judgment of Washington society is formed
from an intercourse with its floating population-
the host of gamblers,. office seekers, idlers and

the other varieties of the genus loafer who congre-
gate about the hotels on Pennsylvania avenue and
press to all places of public resort. And here, for
a moment, I must be allowed to repeat what 1 have
said of Washington society, and I speak after an
intimate acquaintance with it.
A purer, more refined and more sympathizing
population than the resident population of Wash-
ington, i do not believe exists anywhere in the
country. It is the floating population of office hun-
tars, gamblers and loafers who have given such an
evil name abroad to Washington society. They
crowd the streets, hotels, coffee houses, gambling
establishments, and if possible, more disreputable
abodes, and the careless looker-on takes them for
the people of Washington. They on the contrary
belong every where through the country, from
New Orleans to Maine, from New York to Cali-
fornia. If they are claimants, they have to wait
the adjustment of their claims, if they are seeking
office, they have to wait its bestowment, if they
are gamblers they have to wait the report of the
stool pigeon, and the presence of their victim, and
if they are mere followers of pleasure, they have
idle rime enough--so that the recklessness of an
uncertain future unprovided for, and the need 0f
bread which one does not earn, is rife in Washing-
ton. Men go there, for instance, to get an office,
with a few dollars in their pockets. They spend
their money anyhow, whether they obtain place or
not-and if they fail in the attainment of office,
too often fall into loaferism, vagabondism, and be-
come emphatically "used up." They are Fals-
tiff's
[ "Cankers of a calm world and a long peace."
They are fit to be of the regiment with which he
refused to march through Coventry.
The observer of human character who visits
Washington, and forms his opinion of the place
from the population he meets with in the coffee
houses, gambling saloons, and about the corners of
streets on Pennsylvania avenue, will come to about
as just conclusions as would he who made the Five
1
Points in New York, or the Causeway in Balti-

are residents, and who with very, few exceptions,
have nothing to do with office-seeking or this float-
ing population, except in the way of business, who
should be looked to for the true character of tho
place. And I venture to say, a kinder, more coa-

siderate, more humane and courteous people cannot
be found in our country-they are as religious too,
as their many churches and benevolent institutions
will bear witness.
"The Ladies' Benevolent Society of Washing-
ton," which is composed of benevolent ladies from
various denominations, and in the most respectable
portion of society, proves how year after year those
who from position might devote themselves to mere
fashion, have devoted themselves to practical be-
nevolence.
It is said that Congress in its capacity represents
the wisdom of the country. Be that as it may.-.-.
It is certain that the vices of the country find rep-
resentatives in Washington also. And often the
more vicious the party, the more inclined they are

MISS PTON-.ANIMAL MAGNHTISDI-.-PETERSON'5 AP
PROACH-ALICE AND 1.
Proud in her pale beauty, dressed in a plain
black velvet, with a japonica in her bosom, how
like a queen, more, how like the beauty of 'Caro-
lina,' Miss Singleton, my fair representative, stood
amidst the crowd of wealthy, distinguished, am-
bitious and fashionable people who thronged to her
party, and did the honors of the occasion- That
sweet smile, like moonlight upon marble, how it
lived all over her bright face as she gave her wel-
come to the very humblest of her guests! I thought
I never saw her look so well, as with her dark hair
parted plain and caught in a graceful twist, seem-
ingly almost careless, with a silver comb, she stood
by the fire-place not far from the mirror, which
reflected back more dignity and womanly grace
thaR ever before had crossed its surface. The
word "loveable," I was about to say, applied to
her more entirely than to any other woman I have
ever known, (save one,) except perhaps that the
desire to be near her and press her snowy hand
was chastened by an awe, which I, not celebrated
for such emotions where women are concernedcould
not repress. I have seen it make other and even
courtly men awkward. Her lips were tremulous
with kindness and fascination as she spoke, and
her nose, slightly aquiline, with her remarkably
arched biows, formed, together with a figure which
seemed modelled to show what dignified graceful-
ness wasa combination of female attractions which,
like the glorious picture of some old master, was a
wonder and a despair to all other women and would
have been a passion and a madness'to all men who
beheld her, but for that undefiriable awe with
which her presence impressed almost every man
who approached her. I had often heard this re-
marked by my acquaintances airoong the gentlemen.
young and old; and, when in their cups, late at
night, after such a scene, they discussed the ladies
in a way in which gentlemen never should disCuss
ladies, not even in their cups, I have often thought
that I never heard one disrespectful word or one

improper allusion or slighting remark made upon
Miss Singleton.
By the side of Miss Singleton, laughing and
chatting with her, stood Miss Upton, whose gay
and sparkling glance flashed round the room, and
seemed to court the admiration which she was
conscious of receiving from all. Her melting blue
eye was radiant with the consciousness of health,
position, wealth, power and beauty, and she only
seemed to a careless observer, in her joyousness,
anxious, perhaps too anxious, to please all; but a
keener one could at once detect the purpose of one
who had the desire to win without any idea of be.
ing won. With facile and easy movement she re-
minded one of an accomplished actress (she was
an actress) who felt that she had trod the boards is
triumph, and who, whenever her glance, or her
tone, or her position made a "hit," expected the
applause which was bound to follow. It must be
confessed, also, that if that applause came not the
lady was angry, and sometimes felt disposed to re-
sent as art injury any stint or stay in the acknow-
ledgment of attractions which she had been long
taught to believe deserved and received universal
homage. Something of a queenly feeling, like a
real queen's thirst fin power, was this feeling for
universal admiration in the heart of Miss Upton.
Having made a conquest, she cared nothing for it
except to display the trophies of her victory, and
she turned to another to receive his attentions and
his worship and to leave him where she round him,
except for the wounds which his vanity and his
heart were suffering. Miss Watson ("my own
lonian Myrrah!" am I forgetting her?) was not a
more consummate actress on the stage than was
Miss Upton in society.
have you ever, gentle reader, bid farewell to
many dear friends who were all bound together in
the same hark on some long and perilous voyage?
And amidst those friends was there one whose im-
age you cherished in your inmost heart with a
holy and an abiding love? Then, after your many
farewells with the c~hers, how to hint or to her you
went last, but you had thought all the while of
that last one, and how your soul travailed as with
a death agony when that word that "must be and
bath been" spoke only in that long, straining,
absorbing embrace which would unite two souls,

though their clayey tenements were doomed to of his ample neck-cloth which came down in front

separation. So felt I' all the while towards Alice
Glare-so thought I all the while-so my ardent
eye (seemingly a careless glance) had seen her all
the while; and there she stood, silent and apparent-
ly absorbed, near Miss Singleton, also. What a
trio!
Attired in simple white, (1 think it was lace
over satin, but my emotions would not let me scan
her mere attire as I did her rival's) Alice looked
rtore lovely than I had ever seen her. If in Miss
Singleton you saw the dignified and winning wo-
nan, and even to a man of the world, in Miss Up-
ton the attractii.re one in spite of yourself, in Alice
you saw (at least I did) the entirely loveable wo-
nan, without the impression of that awe which 1
aid modified the word "loveable" in applying- it
to Miss Singleton. There, ripened into beautiful
womanhood, was the being who had awakened my
first ambition when .1 was an innocent boy, and
those sweet lips which in girlhood had said "Willie
Russell" with such endearing true-heartedness and
lianor preference--there they wet-c, and the last
words I heard them utter was the charge that
had insulted her. And so I find, were I not the
same Willie Russell-and so I would not, I would
fain believe, even though I had acted as [did act,
had she have known the actor.
I have heard men say, who, have been in battle,
in fact I know the impulse myself, that they felt
in spite ofihemselves a certain misgiving of cow-
ardace. if 'I may so express myself, on the first
thought of the encounter before them. One pas-
sion in its operations illustrates duother, and there-
tore let me say that in spite of my manhood and
ny pride in my address, that I fiolt a strange mis-
giving as I looked at Alice. "Willie Russell,"
i said to myself, be a luau; now, when you should
sho~v no morbid beingg and no thing but address
and ease, what has come over you.~~ There stood
Peterson, not far front Alice; and, to (10 him no
nore than justice, lie was the finest lookimt~ man
a the room. Every care~ had been bestowed upon
his toilette, and as thr as the simple adornments of
our country allow he was attired magnificently.-
Too much elaboration, I said to myself, as I scm-
tenised his silk stockings curiously ribbed, and his
~tent pimps, and Itis gay ~est, :ott(l the infoldin"

like a waterfall, in which a large diamond breast-
pin was stuck like a skewer. But another glance
satisfied me that this description, which I ran over
in my mind to myself was caricature-and the
more so when I heard several parsons, and p~rtic-
ularly the ladiesadmit'ing him. I thoughtof my
own plain attire, and was provoked with myself
that I had not bestowed more care upon it. At this
moment Mr. Dudley, who was at my shoulder with-
out my observing it, whispered me:
"A fine person has Mr. Peterson, but he evinces
the consciousness of it too much."
I am almost ashamed to record that this remark
gave me anything but displeasure. Mr. liudley
continued:
"The lady beside him is of herself the most
beautiful person here; but there is a nameless some-
thing about our fair hostess which has a gift of the
spirit about it surpassing that of any other woman
I have ever known." I bowed acquiescence and
passed on to pay my respects to tlte lady.
"You are late, Mr. Russell," she said, "consid-
ering 'the pains I took to give you a bidding."
"I was in the country," I replied; "when I re-
ceived your invitation, and I hurried to town."
"You look pale: have you not been well?"
At this moment we stood alone, and I replied:
"Yes, oh yes. But, Miss Singleton, since your
flattering words to me, I acknowledge the truth of
a new inipulse-of ambition-and I had just gone
into die country to rusticate andreflect when your
invitation reached me. I am here, may it please
you, to do you Itontage."
"Alt!" said she, giving me her hand with great~
cordiality, '~l am so glad to hear it." She was
about to add something, when the approach of Mr.
l)ndley interrupted her, and she turned t~ him,
though her Itand limigered a moment in mine, and
1 saw the observant Englisltman noticed it.
"Have you no bow for me, Mr. Russell?" ox-
claimed Miss Uotoit, disengaging herself from the
cooV.'d of gentlemen about her and giving me her
hand. "I have something to tell you;" and so
saying she put her arm itt mine, artd before I well
knew what I was about, she led me to a corner of
the reont. I glanced at Alice Glare amtd caught
her eye, but it drol)ped the monoent she met my

THE AUTC(

glance, and she blushed exceedingly and seeer
much confused. I made an attempt to make
bow to her, and as her eye fell I erected mys
suddenly like a bent sapling, I said to myself as
reflected upon it afterwards indignantly, that
covers its erectness with a jerk.
Arrived in the corner, and taking a seat as s
motioned me to one, Miss Upton asked,
Rave you heard the newsy"
"Whatnews'?" I rejoined.
"They say that Miss Glare is to marry Mr. F
person."
Now, it is a singular fact, that while the me
meeting with Alice and Peterson threw me from ii
self-possession, (there is certainly some reason wi
it should have done so from my scene with Alice
the carriage, and would have done so, perhaps, mo
or less under any circumstances,) yet Miss Upton
announcement of a report with regard to them, ti
truth of which would have blasted my happiness
fell on the ears of as self-possessed a man as an
in the crowded rooms of Miss Singleton.
Is there something in animal magnetism? Oi
rather, as I believe it is said, animal magnetism
makes one spirit charm another and bends it to ii
will, did my nature take its hue from the sell
command of Miss Upton as men gather coning
from one another in battle'? I know not. It
certain Miss Upton had no wish to inspire me-witi
her spirit of self-command; and, after all, I may
without remembering the fact now, myself hav4
resolved as she led me to the corner, to betray rn
emotion to her artful scrutiny, whatever it' migh:
be. Be this as it may, I fancy that if a physician
had felt my pulse he would hav~ found' it some
pulsations less violent than the moment before.-
This analysis of our emotions after all, like travel.
ing in a circle, ends where it begins. Yet I ima-
gine from the quick susceptibilities of my nature,
which, as I think I have said before, had something
womanly in them, it may be that my temperament is
somewhat of the chamelion character, that is, takes
its hue, from its association~ with others. This is
more or less all men's natures, except those who
are decided idiocyncracies; but it is certainly mine,
and I suppose predominates in those natures thaL
have a turn for poetry, and particularly for acting
and oratory.

my face flashed forth my admiration as I suited the
action to the word, and felt myself gaze on Alice
with a glance of admiration and tenderness which
my best moods in Sardanapalus, even with my
"own lonian Myrrha," and Byron's language to aid
me, did not touch. (~7iMisstant Alice's eyes
and mine met. Could there have been animal
magnetism in mine? To me there was in her's;
for our long and deep glances met each other and
each seemed to look into the other's soul, yet was
there no recognition in our manner save that.-
Alice was the first to withdraw her glance, as she
raised it quietly up to Peterson in answer to some
remark that he was evidently making to her.
Miss Upton's eye was full upon me as I turned
to her, while she for a moment delicately with the
tip of her fan touched her lip, and then suddenly
resuming her gay and careless tone, she asked:
"And Mr. Peterson? I have heard of him often
before, but never met him until yesterday, when he
called on me-he is certainly a very handsome
man."
"Very," I said, as a sudden thought struck me.
"Yes, very. Certainly his devotion to Miss Glare
merits a reward. lie's older than I am, but at a
child's party years ago there was quite a rivalry
between us for the smile of that same fair Miss
Alice, theh an artless and beautiful little girl-
saving your presence and Miss Singleton's-and
much superior to her sex around her as she is to-
night. I bel eve I rather was more in favor with
her then than Peterson, but you see how it is now.
She was my first love, and I believe she is Peter-
son's first and last. I don'i~ believe it is in the
power of any woman to get him away from her."
"Don't you?" replied Miss Upton, hastily. The
medicine is working, thought I.
~ "I don't. Steady as the si~n's rising and as
regular, has been his devotion to Alice, to Miss
Glare."
"You say Miss Glare now, do you'?"
"Certainly-and Pet~rson is perhaps the wealth-
iest young man in Baltimore."
"Is he'? I never heard that."
"Yes, the wealthiest-of one of the first fami~
lies, as the Virginians say -without vices, that I
have ever heard of, and with a personal beauty
that draws admiration from every body."

"There," thought ~ to myself, "I have done
justice to my rival; but it was not for the sake of
justice."
"And you certainly think they will make a
match'?" said Miss Upton, musingly.
"Why, as the old ~vomen say, everything seems
agreeable.~~
"Tell me something about Mr. Peterson, now
do-what kind of a person is he'?"
"You see, Miss Upton."
"Yes, yes, but let me know his character; you
know," she said playfully, "you and I like to dis-
sect character, when there is no scandal in it."
"You see his character in his looks-he feels he
is attractive to your sex. The artillery of many a
glance has played on him without touching him-
and he laughs at all women's power except Miss
Clare's, and he feels that too deeply to say any-
thing about it. I dare be sworn now, that he would
give a look of wonder if any one were to tell him
of the conquests you have made."
"Upon my word then he is adamant to all but
to one, and to her he is wax. Ah! Miss Glare and
he are in close conversation Now she turns away
from him to say something to Mr. Jumper-queer
person that Mr. Jumper.~~
"My particular friend," I said, "who has got
me into more difficulties than any body else-it is
a way particular friends have though. On my
word, Mr. Peterson looks this way as if he were
attracted. Well, if you can put a spell upon him
it is what no other woman but Miss Glare has done,
to my certain knowledge."
"Let me say, Mr. Russell," replied Miss Upton,
"that your knowledge can't be certain on that
point. A man's wounded vanity scarcely ever
tells of its aiflictioris-he oftener, like the Spartan
boy when the fox was gnawing at his heart, hides
the wound and denies the suffering. There isP no-
thing in losing one's heart, but there is a great
deal in having it found out-at least when we get
ao other in return."
Self-possessed as she was Miss Upton blushed
under my searching glance, and passing quickly
her delicate finger along the line of the hair on her
forehead she observed:

threatened to be Egyptian, flickers over me, and
the night of despair closes above me once more like
engulphing waters. Then all is bright again.
All my impetuous passions were concentrated
into one absorbing one. I never shall forget how
proudly and contentedly I seated myself in the vo-
luptuous French chair by the side of Alice, and
looked around me on the brilliant scene There
was in it the deep enjoyment of the present, and
the anticipation of victory in the future. "I re-
mounted the river of my years," and I Pemembered
that night at Alice Glare's party, and the "1 vow,
Mr. Peterson, Willie Russell can beat you after all,"
which was engraved on my heart at our child's
party in characters of adamant, lived now in every
pulse there in characters of flame.
I leaned my elbow on the broad and cushioned
'elbow of the chair beside me, and as I looked down
at my plain boot I thought.I had as good a foot as
Mr. Peterson, if he did wear a ribbed stocking on
his. Now this thought of manhood no doubt was
horn of the auld lang syne envy of Peterson's
better toilette at Alice's party, and of my~many
difficulties with Mrs. Clayton arising therefrom.
And [looked at Peterson as he sat apparently ab-
sorbed in coiversat:on with Miss Upton, and won-
dered if it were possible that she could catch him.
And then I said 'to myself "Why should I care? I
only ask a fair field and no favor, with Alice." -
How my airy castles mounted as Alice and I sat
side by side, scarcely exchanging a word with each
other-I believing that our full hearts were content
with the silent welling of cur mutual passion.-
Alice certainly was thinking of me in her silence~
for I remember now how her person was inclined
towards me, and experience has taught me that th
unconscious inclination of a woman's person to
wards him whom she thinks the most of in a corn
pany, always betrays her to a scrutinizing eye.
I never saw Alice look so well; and with
trembling but earnest tone I told her so. Let
also be confessed that I did my best (n9t forgetting
to do it with tact) to display my opera cap in thi

105

eyes of Alice. I did so wish her to notice it, that
I might expatiate upon the fascinations of Miss Sin-
gleton-and be it further confessed that the deli-
cate diamond ring which I wore on my little finger
(the only finger I could get it on) was Miss Up-
ton's. I glanced at Alice's hand-she had one
suspicious-looking ring on her finger, only one.-
and I could not but ask her where she got it.
"I understand you, Mr. Willie Russell, you want
me to ask you where your diamond sparkler came
from, but I know-I can tell you, sir."
"From whom, Alice'?"
"From Miss Upton. I do not know how many
gentlemen have worn it for a season."
"Yes," I said, "and from appearances I should
not be surprised if Mr. Peterson was the next to
wear it for a season."
"Well, let him. She is certainly very beauti-
ful, and I suppose you will beartestimony that she
is very captivating."
"That's the universal testimony--
"But what care I how kind she be,

"Oh! you are an affected person, Willie Russell,

that beautiful opera cap?"
"Saving your presence, the fairest woman that
I know of wrought it for me with her own fair
hand-one to whom, next to yourself, Alice, I owe
more homage than to any other woman."
"I do not know that you owe any homage to
me," said Alice, blushing, but speaking seriously,

"No, indeed! Miss Sallie Singleton, my fair

"You have many fair representatives."

"Alice, I am not indifferent to the fact that I
have kind friends among your sex. And, Alice,
you know ~
"Don't speak so that every body can hear you,
for gracious sake. The whole room is looking at
us, and you remind me exactly of your manner
when you were playing Sardanapalus with that
actress. Don't you mean to ask me to dance?"
"I do, if you prefer it to sitting here."
"Certainly. The eyes of all the room are up-
on us-and Miss tTptoa is looking at me like a
witch."
I led her to the dance, where we could have
very little conversation, and at its conclusion Mr.
Dudley can~e up and engaged her for the next set.
While we were grouped together, chatting, Mr
Cotesworth, a member of Congress from South
Carolina, (a little elated with winy,) advanced to
us; and, after making his bow to Alice, said:
"Miss Glare, wherever the most beautiful wo-
men are, there I find my friend Russell. When
you are not h~re, I find him with Miss Singleton
or Miss Uptor~, and when you are, it seems to me
he is with all of you at once, as an Irishman would
say. The other day, in New York, fascinated by
the acting of the new star, Miss Watson, and
charmed with what I had heard of her character,
I sought an introduction to her, and the first ques-
tion she asked me was of my friend herefor whom
she professed the wildest kind of friendship. And
to show you how much you attract even your own
se~, she told me that she had marked you as the
beauty of the monumental city, even in a crowded
theatre."
"You report, ~ exclaimed Alice, blushing
and with some pique, "bold compliments in a bold
way, Mr. ~
"Truth is always bold," replied Mr. Cotes-
worth.
"And so are actresses, it appears, and the gen-
tlemen who court their society."
"You are sharp on me," exclaimed Mr. Cotes-
worth, good-humoredly. "Well, I Iconfess to all
the sin and shame of a profound admiration of Miss
Watson. Russell, she had a crowd of admirers
about her, and when I told her that I knew you
well, and was to leave the xwxt morning early,
she asked us to excuse her while she wrote a note

to you, her best friend, as she called ~you; and she
said to me 'you must tell him, Mr. Cotesworth,
that, though I am always talking about him, he is
even yet more in my heart than on my lips.' She
assured me that you would make the best actor of
the day. Ah, and I have your note. I inquired for
you on my arrival, supposing that you would be
most willing to receive Miss ~ missive;
and hearing that you weze out of town, and know-
ing that you would, of course, be here at Miss Sin-
gleton's to-night, if you were within hailing dis~
tance, I have brought it to you, and you owe me
one."
With a mixed feeling of gratification and annoy-
ance, 1 received it as I remarked:
"I trust Miss Watson is well~"
"Very well-and looking most beautiful, and
playing more beautifully than she looks, if that
were possible,~~ replied Mr. Cotesworth. "She
said she had received very flattering offers from
the manager to play an engagement here, and that
she had written to ask your advice upon accepting
it-of course you will advise her to come, though
she might not make as much as in New York-it
is something to play here to the magnates of the
land. MIss Clare, I pray you, whatever his judg-
ment may urge him to do, that you put your com-
mands upon him by all m~Nans to bring the lady
here."
"Mr. Russell, I fancy," exclaimed Alice in an
excited, sarcastic tone,"needs no commands to that
effect, and no commands to the contrary would in-
duce him to give any other." Apd so saying, she
took Mr. Dudley's arm and walked away.
"Why, Russell," whispered Mr. Cotesworth,
the l3altimore beauty was hard on me."
I forced a laugh and said: "Miss Clare had to
pretend a little anger to hide maybe the gratifica-
tion your repetition of the compliment gave her."
"No, that ain't it. It's bad policy to praise one
woman to another. Better luck next time," he
added as he lounged off to another part of the
~oom.
I withdrew to a corner, knowing that each and
ill were so much occupied with themselves or
heir partners as not to notice me, and read Miss
~Vatson's letter. She complained with some se-
rerity that I had not answered her last letter, and

told me of the proffer of a lucrative engagement on
the part of the manager for her to appear in Wash-
ington, and she added that she meant to accept it if
it was only that the poor "Greek Slave" might
see once more her kingly Sardanapalus.
I felt my face brighten-my heart burned wildly
toward my "own lonian Myrrha," and I forgot my
locality and read over arid over again her interes-
ting letter, which was so, exquisitely expressed,
though written amidst the crowd of admirers and
flatterers around her. As I gazed at her signature,
and threw my delighted glance across the room~ in
the effort of memory to place most vividly before
me her glorious personation of the loving Jonian,
I caught the eye of Alice full upon me, with a
pained and searching expression, which caused me
to dangle in seeming carelessness the letter in my
hand as I walked away.
in I felt a kind of gratification I must confess, yet
spite of myself I was growing dull, and but for
my fixed resolution to abstain frogi wine, I should
willingly have joined Sangston, who at that mo-
ment came up and said: "Russell, ain't you going
to drink the health of your fair representative in
some of her own wine. She sent all the way to
Charleston for it; and, like herself, it intoxicates
without "
"Any head nolan?" I asked.
"Yes,'yes, but there's the heart ache afterwards,
Russell."
I saw in a moment 'that Sangston had drank too
much-and just as I vas about to propose it he
took my arm and we stepped into another room,
less heated, and which was nearly deserted in con-
sequence of many having gone to the other party,
and the dance commanding the attention of the
rest.
"Russell," he said, h a gloomy tone, "I shall
not be restored to my place. Time Secr~ tary abso-
lately refuses it, and says it is on account of rmiy
habits. Cotesworth, who you know is a great
friend of mine-and you know what a blunt, open
fellow he is-has just returned. Well, he saw the
Secaet~ry to-day, and he 1)ositively refused to re-
instate me. I have lived upon the hope."
"Don't give up yet. He is in for it, I suspect,
with Miss Singleton, the Secretary is, I think-
and I certainly think there can be no impropriety
- in asking her to use her influence with him."

107

"Not for the world, Russell. I'll tell you
something-I got it all from Cotesworth-the Sec-
retary has courted her again and again-he thinks
I am in his way: if 1 were I should not want office
long. He says he can give me an office in the
New Orleans Custom House, but not here. He
wants to kill me off with fever. His insincerity is
apparent-for if my habits keep me out of office
here they ought to keep me out of office there.
"But why not go there'?"
"Go thexe!" he said almost wildly.
"San gston, pardon me-but you love Miss Sin-
gleton'?"
"Love her!" he half whispered as he grasped
my baud wildly: "that's no word for it I adore
her-but its no use; I'm a wreck amidst the
breakers. Sometimes when I look at her and think
that I shall never possess her, and that another
may, I cannot tell you what fierce, stern, diabolical
thoughts arise in my heart. But she flung the
honorable secretaryy sky high."
"1-low old is G.-, the secretary'?~~
"I don't know-torty-five or fifty, I suppose.
He has address, position, every thing; and he does
not lool~ as old as he is. But she flung him; and
he thinks I am the cause of it. I would rather be
the cause of it than he a king."
"That is, you wouhi rather possess Mi~s Single-
ton."
"Faint heart never won fair lady,~~ I remarked.
"Yes, but such a fair lady, Russell. Her fath-
er was intemperate. Not ten minutes ago I heard
her say that her greatest objection to giving a par-
ty was the idea ofl so many persons exciting them-
selves~by wine. She is a monomaniac on the sub-
ject in consequence ot her father's habits; and she
said she was determined at least that her guests
should not be poisoned with bad xvine, so she had
her wines from Charleston-they were her 1~ther's.
Cotesworth, who loves his glass dearly; told her
she was too rigid; and she replied, with that
awing dignity of her's which awed even him, 'No,
sir.' Lie said, 'SuPPOSe your lover was fond of his
glass and sometimes took tuo much, what then,
Miss Singleton?' "Lover, sir! Mr. Cotesworth,
1 pledge you my word that no man whom I had
seen intoxicated would I suffer to address me. ~

somehow I thought she glanced at me."
"A guilty conscience, Sangston," I said.
"Do I seem to have been drinking? Well, well.
Coteewortli remarked: 'I fear, Miss Singleton, you
will die a maidor marry a fanatic.' 'I may do
neither,' she replied, 'though I think the first fate
is the likeliest.' My mother, I suppose, has beert
making Miss Singleton her confidant. You don't

much, and make peopl&amp;their confidant about you.
And then to make Miss Singleton her confidant
about me. I suppose she has told her of all my
scrapes-women and all."
There was a pause in the conversation. Sang-
ston resumed:
"Yes, Ru~seVl, I will tell you-she said you
were not a fanatic, and that you drank no wine;
and Cotesworth swjue that you deserved no credit
for it; that you could not drink. 'Not without be-
coming, like other gentlemen, excited from drink-
ing!' ~aid Miss Singleton, in her keen way. lie
colored, and said he would make you drink before
the evening was over."
"Well, I don't deserve any credit for it, for I
cannot drink without becoming very much excited.
Sangeton, you must not get on a frolic now, my
good fellow. Reform it altogether1 and tell Miss
Singleton it is for her sake that you have done it."
"Oh! God! for the will, Russell.- the purpose.
But what would Miss Singleton do for my sake."
"You do not know what she might do, indeed
you do not. 1 know Miss Singleton has a deep
interest in you.~~
"Yes, my mother must tell her every thie:g
about me-I know she did. That's the interest-
the interest which a proud, rich, patrician woman
takes in a petty ex-official like me-a beggar. But
there's one thing certain, and ~ have been brooding
over it for days."
"What's that?"
"Why, I can give Mr. Secretary almost as high
a toss as he gave me. I think I can, if reports be
true I can."
"How?" I asked, with much interest.
This seemed to recall Sangstora to himself; and,
after a pause, he said;

the excitement, and we'll have such a talk." I'e-f and without uttering another word she entered her

"Russell, if I tell you something, you will nos
say a word.
"Not a word," I said.
Here Miss Singleton entered the room, and
coming up to us, said,
"Is this the way, gentlemen, you make your.
selves agreeable~.certainly ~o each other you are
very agreeable; but I want you to be agreeable to
my company."
Sangston and I both rose, and he turned aside
when Miss Singleton took my arm, and we prom.
ended for a few moments up and down the room,
while Sangston silently withdrew, and Ijudged
from the direction which he took as he passed out
of the door that he was going to the supper room.
More wine, I feared.
Miss Singleton looked after Sangston and un.
consciously heaved a sigh; and after two or three
steps she asked:
"Has Mr. Coeesworth grown eloquent to you
yet over my wine."
"No, he has not."
"He threatened to do so don't let him be your
Comus."
"No, he shall not. You, Miss Singleton, might
tempt me with the Circean cup-th~i honorable
member from South Carolina certainly cannot-..-
none but you.~~
"Ah! am I the only one? Miss Upton, more,
Miss Clare, sir, is here."
"StillAnone but you. You have the power, ~Miss
~'"ngleton, to make men obey you as well as love
you.~~
"Oh! you traitor to true love! Dare you tell
Alice Clare that?"
"'What man dare, I dare,' though my gallantry
would not let me say that of one lady to another-.-
it would be in bad taste, would it nut'? And yet
I think I might say it of you, and have all acknow-
ledge its truthfulness as well as appropriateness."
It wan now long after midnight. l steod by Miss
Singleton's side as her guests were making their
good-night bows to her. Miss Upton joined us
when Alice came up oa Mr. Peterson's arm to say
good-night. She but glanced at me with a cold
bow as she gave her hand to Miss Singleton. I
returned it profoundly on my part.
"No, Alice," said Miss Singleton, "you must

terson said n~ver a word, bur stood as if obedient
to Miss Singleton's behest. She continued: "Mr.
Peterson, as Miss Upton cannot go home with all
those gentlemen she has made my company so gay
with to-night, and for which I owe her so much,
you, I know, will see that she gets home safely."
"Ah!" said Miss Upton, quickly, and with more
earnestness than she would willingly have betray-
ed, as I thought: "Then, sir, that you may not
prove recreant, I'll go at once-secure you while
the command of Miss Singleton is upon you." And
gaily taking Mr. Peterson's arm, which Alice had
resigned upon the invitation of Miss Singleton to
spend the night with her, Miss Upton dropped her
prettiest curtsey, Mr. Peterson made his best bow,
and they withdrew.
"Alice, you have lost your beau," said Miss
Singleton to her as she placed herself at her side.
"She is welcome," said Alice.
"Just like our sex," said Miss Singleton; "they
never value true devotion; they are always follow-
ing the ignis fatuns somewhere."
Alice said she liked Mr. Petorson well enough;
and there was a silence. Soon all the company
withdrew, and Miss Singleton, Alice and myself
were left alone. "I must bid you good night, Miss
Singleton," I said.
"Not yet," said she. "Come with us into my
private parlor-it is nex to my chamber-and
when we ladies get tired of you we will give yoa
the hint, and be in the land of dreams very soon
~ So saying, she took my arm-I of-
fered Alice the other and we repaired thither.-
When we entered we found- no person there but
Janet, a bright-eyed quadroon, who was the wait-
ing maid of Miss Singleton. "I shall not want
you, .Janet; you may go to bed; shut the door after
you." Janet courtsied, asked her mistress if she
night send some cake to Miss Upton's Mary, and
receiving a ~certainlyI~ for answer, withdrew.
I don't know why, but I felt awkward; so evi-
dently did Alice. Miss Singleton looked at us
both with deep interest as we three stood together
by the fire place. There was the silence of a min-
ute, when, taking Alice's hand, she placed it in
mine and said:

Alice for a moment-she held down her head and
said not a word. In a instant more I clasped in
my arms the , the yielding Alice Clare
....and, in words that came from my very soul, I
told her how long and how earnestly I had loved
her. All at once she burst into tearsand exclaimed'
"If you love me so much., if you have loved me
so long, explain to me-yes, I will ask it-explain
to me what is there between you and Miss Wat~
son'?"
Ah! but I felt that I loved Alice the dearer for
this question-for I thought I felt how dearly she
loved me. I was a long time in the explanation,
for I told Alice everything-tiny frolic, Miss Wat-
son's care of me and all; and as I saw it heightened
her interest in me, I did not coldly expatiate upon
Miss Watson's noble character; but I did full jus-
tice to her attractions, and frankly told Alice
that but for my love for her, I certainly should have
flung caste and family considerations tQ the winds
and have made love to Miss Watson-if, I contin-
ued, I had not met with Miss Singleton in the
meantime. I then retaliated by asking her about
Peterson, but I soon found that she had never par-
ticularly cared for him. Oh! long remembered
night!

Among my acquaintances was a member from
Connecticut; one of the quaintest arid most unique
persons I have ever known. His name was Job
Darlington-or, to give him his full title in the
premises, in which he seemed to rejoice very much,
the Honorable Job Darlington. Keenness and

quaintness stuck out all over him, and you won]
think, to look at him, that such a quality as cou
age, if he ever had it, had, to use a Westex
ii!
phrase, "caved in with him long ago.~~ He was ii
offensive and kind, and so shrewd withal, that
~j I
delighte~l to chat with him; and though ther
seemed to be no points of afiioity between us w
agreed t~mazingly-par4cularly upon the subject
the Union and political abolitionism.
In debate. one of the Southern members-pre
suing, I shrewdly suspect, upon the forhearanc
and peace-loving qualities of the gentleman fron
the Puritan State-gro~sIy insulted him by mon
than insinuating that he was a trickster and
coward, and one of the manufacturers of wooden
nutmegs with which they had sprinkled the brands
tijddies of the South, much to the injury of South
em digestive organs.
The Yankee replied that bran bread was much
better than brandy toddies for weak stomachs and
weak brains, and that the wooden nutmeg had the
effect of bran bread, and he therefore recommended
the continued use of them to his opponent, partic-
ularly if he continued his toddies, and his digestion
continued impaired; (a hard hit, for the gentleman
*        was in both categories, that is, weak in digestion
and given to toddies;) and he of Connecticut more-
over proceeded to say that if they did manufacture
wooden nutmeg in his State, there were no such
fools as to buy them in it, and they therefore had
to resort to the constituents of the gentleman, and
the gentleman himself, for purchasers.
My friend Job's decidedly funny manner con-
vulsed the House with laughter; but none of the
patience of his namesake pertained to the member
from the South, who applied' as many ill-names to
the gentleman from Connecticut, and as volubly,
as could any fish-woman in any fish-market of the
world. Job laid back and laughed heartily at his
opponent-one of those honest and true laughs
which are contagious, and the whole house caught
it, and laughed again, until the member's tones of
rage were drowned in the echoes of the laughter at
him. After repeati'd calls to t)rder it was at last
obtained-the member of' the South frowning fierce
defiance, with war on his very brows,-and the
member from Connecticut looking meek as Moses
and as pleasant as a ripple in the sunshine. I saw

111

d it all, and I must say that the bearing of "Connecti-
r- cut" pleased me very much, for I saw character and
n courage sticking out all over him; besides, I had a
t- grudge against the Southern man for something ho
i had said about myself and Miss Watson, and I
e rejoiced in his discomfiture.
e As the Honorable Job came laughing out of the
jf Hall of the House I met him and congratulated
him on his success in flooring the Hon. Mr. Fris
bie. "But, my dear 5ir," said I, "he is a perfect
e fire-eater."
~   "I've heard ~   exclaimed the meek-looking Job,
~ while a 9ast of serious thought dispelled the smile
whnch played upon his features as he met me.-
"I've heard so; but there's one thing certain, he
may eat fire, and he's got to eat his words, tu6,
- before I'll eat mine. How shall 1 proceed? Tin
fact is that if he challenges me in my own name I
can't accept it. It ~vill kill tue with my constitu-
ents stone dead-I shall be honorable no longer,
whether I fight or not. You know if I challenge
him I'll have to sign my name to it-that won't
do with my constituents-they are almost all
church members. If he challenges me I have the
choice of weapons-that's one advantage- and yet
I wish I could have an alias like other folks, (not
very honorable, by the bye, but law-breakers, nev-
ertheless,) then I could satisfy the fire-eater, and
my constituents wouldn't know anything about it,
unless I am shot, and then there'll be an end of the
matter-but I have a craving desire to gratify the
gentleman. I have written him a note to that ef
feet, but I have begged that he would challenge
me under an alias, here's the note-you are my
very man; I know you understand these things,
and you'll suit me to a 'I'."
I could not but laugh heartily, but my friend
Darlington assured me that it was no joking mat-1
ter with him, for it would lose him his re-election
to a certainty if he fought, and that he could not
afford to do. as the per diem was ~vorth more than
his practice, to say nothing of the honor.
Now Frisbie was a starch, precise individual,
and I had reason to believe, notwithstanding the
airs he gave himself, that be was not the bravest
man in the world after all.
"Give me the note," said I, "I'll hand it to him
and make the explanation,~~

WILLIAM RUSSELL.

"Do," replied Darlington, "and Russell, yot
must see me through."
[left him, and immediately sent my card int'~
the ball by one of the pages~ with the request t
see the Honorable Win. Frisbie as soon as conve-
nient, as I was in waiting. He made his appear-
ance, and I presented him the note, saying it wa~
from Mr. Darlington.
"I have challenged him myself, sir, I have the
right of challenge," he remarked, with some sur-
prise as he took the note and proceeded to read it.
"This is trifling, sir," he exclaimed, as he tore
the note to tatters~ "trifling sir! I don't allow
any dodge like this-can't be re-elected if his con-
stituents know he fights-wants me to challenge
him under an alias-he had better get me to fight
him by an alias too, by another-its no go sir, he
mL~st take the responsibility."
"Certainly he must, or I must for him, Mr.
Frisbie, as I am acting as his friend."
Mr. Frisbie looked perplexed and amazed. I
remarked that there was no doubt, truth in what
Mr. Darlington said-that they could easily meet
without any formal challenge in the matter.-
"You had better send your friend to me, Mr.
~ I said, "and we can arrange matters
without any formality of this kind."
"Sir, the laws of honor are laws of etiqnette,~~re~
joined Mr. Frisbie, "and this is a perplexing posi-
tion-in fact sir, Mr. Darlington will find it's no
jesting."
"He is an eccentric person I know Mr. Fris-
bie, but [asmre you that he is entirely in earnest."
"Well, sir, I must consult a friend upon this
~most preposterous ~)roposition.~~
"If you plcase,~~ I said, as I made him my
obeisance and withdrew, "1 shall remain at my
lodgings to-day, expecting some friend's call."
As I entered the rotunda of the Capitol J found
Darlington quietly talking and laughing with some
of his acquaintances, and telling him what had
passed, I withdrew.
Within an hour 14'risbie's friend, Dr. Merrill,
called on me, and we made the arrange nent that
without any formal challenge the parties should
meet near Bladensburg at a certain place indicated
that afternoon, at five o'clock-quick work.
That day Darlington dined with me. Like
15

myself he drank no wine, and his tall, awkward
form and awkward manner, with his quiet, dry hu-
mor, and yet apparent nervous sensitiveness,
amused me very much. I made some allusion to
* the meeting.
*   "We won't talk about that," said he, "'suffi-
cient to the day is the evil thereof.' ~' I can't stand
being called a coward you know; for though we
are right straight-in a direct line I mean-from
the Puritans, yet, believe me, 1 have not the mor-
al courage necessary to resist meeting Frisbie.
That which he calls courage, is not confined exclu-
sively to the South. To tell you the truth, I mean
to receive his first fire, and fire in the air. It
would be firing in the air any how, should I shoot
at him, for 1 have no practice with the pistol or
any other carnal weapon that flesh is heir to ex-
cept a knife and fork."
1 remonstrated with him earnestly, but it was
of no use. He laughed heartily. "He wont hit
me I tell you,~~ he remarked. "At least there are
many chances in my favor. Don't you kn iW it'?
Did you never hear the story of the old Chief
(General Jackson he meant) and Grundy'?"
"Never," I replied.
"Well, as I have heard it, somebody challenged
Grundy, who being a member of the church, and
not very valorous, as the old Chief knew, went
to him to consult him as to his acceptance of it.
The old Chief heard him patiently. 'Mr. Grun-
dy,' he rejoined, 'you must accept. Quit the
church for the occasion, like the Quaker throw by
your coat. If you accept, sir, there are ten chan-.
ces to one that you (loU't meet; if you do meet there
are ten chances to one that you don't fight. If you
do fight, there are ten chances to one that he don't
hit you. If hedoes hit you, there are ten chances
to one that it aint mortal, and if it is mortal, Mr.

That afternoon found us on the ground. Pistols
and ten paces was the arrangement. Patiently as
his namesake, and as coolly as the old Chieftain
possibly could have acted i~ the matter, Darling~
ton received the fire of Fri;bie and fired in the air.
Frisbie demanded another shot, hut I Peremptorily
interfered, and Dr. Merrill, who was disposed to
adjust matters, said that his principal ought to be
satisfied, and so the parties shook hands; Darling-

all rode into thecity and supped together. This wa
the beginning of a fast friendship between 'Connec

and I record the incident to show that we should no
always judge from appearances; for if a cowan
had been sent into a crowd to insult some one, h
certainly, if Darlington had been there, would hay
selected him as the one who would have suffenem
him to escape with impunity.
A few days after this, my friend Job entered m~
room to say that Cotesworth was sick after an over
indulgence, and had sent him to me with a letter.
"Which," said Job, laughing as he handed it t
me, "came directed to Coresworth. He says it h
from a magnificent creature-the actress-the Mist
Watson who is making such a talk, and whc
Cotesworth is talking about all the time. He callt
me Connecticut and I call him South Carolina, and
I think South Carolina has as many notions at
Connecticut, only after a different fashion."
~ ~ said I, laughing, "are
women and wine. What are Connecticut's?"
The Honorable Job laughed his peculiarly ho.
amorous laugh, atid replied-
"The language of Cowper, with the exception of
one word, 'just expresses it-I mean the character.
istics of my folks-
"Various.
That the mind of Southern men,
Studious of change and pleased with novelty.
May be indulged."
"Duped you mean," said I, joking him.
"Well, duped if you please," he exclaimed, "in
any way you choose, caveat emptoF. Let the
buyer look out to translate it into the vernacular.
Who in the deuce is this 'glorious woman' that
'South Carolina' is always talking about?"
"You must excuse me my friend," I said, "this
short note is from that 'glorious creature,' and I
must hasten to meet her on h~r arrival. Excuse
me."
"Certainly, but look here, don't you get enamor-
ed too," called out Connecticut after me. "If you
do, I shall have to stand by you as you stood by
me in the Frisbie affair." As I hastened down to
the stage office (shall I confess it) I folt annoyed
that Miss Watson should write~to me, under cover

e to Cotesworth, and I puzzled myself much over the
s inquiry whether there was anything peculiar in his
manner when he handed me Miss Watson's letter
~ at Miss Singleton's party.
t As I thus hurried down the avenue and cogitated,
LI I heard a violent rap at the window of the fashion.
e able boarding house of Mrs. Sands, and looking up
a I beheld Miss Watson trying to raise the window
I dnd call to me.
Quick as thought I darted up the broad stair.
way into the front room, and before I thought any.
thing of my whereabouts-except that I had met
Miss Watson-or who might be looking~ on, I
caught her in an eager embrace as she exclaimed
"my kingly Sardanapalus,~~ and I rejoined "my
own lonian Myrrha," and our lips met ~shall' 1
say as warmly) as ev~r the kings aforesaid met the
lips of his devoted lonian.
Steps in the next room-for the folding doors
were open-I had not thought there was a aexi
room until that moment-arrested my 'attention,
and who should I see leaving it with a tread of the
haughtiest scorn and dignity hot Alice Clare.
"Pardon me one moment," I said, as I handed
Miss Watson to the sofa and sprang after Alice,
whom I did not overtake until she had gotten to
the front door. "Good morning, Alice," 1 said.-
She turned on me, and her brow wore an offended
dignity that was regal. Miss Watson could not
have personated it as well, nor Miss Singleton
have looked it better. "Leave me," she exclaim-
ed, and she stamped sternly with her foot, and
beckoning to the footman of Miss Singleton, whose
carriage I had not noticed when I entered the
house, she plhccd herself within it and ordered the
coachman to drive on, before I could say a word. I
looked after her a moment, and scarcely knowing
what I did re-entered the house. On the steps 1
met Miss Upton, who pettishly inquired: "have
you seen Alice Clare? What in the world has
become of her? Shine started out early to do some
shopping. She would get out of the carriage to
wait in the' parlor for me, and now she has gone
off in a pet-.~astouishing."
As I did not choose to make any explanation to
Miss Upton, and merely made the remarim "I don't
know," she hastened out ma l)et too, and I return-
ed to the side of Miss Watson.

The lovely actress had greatly improved since I n
last saw her. What an air success gives one, gen- t]
tie reader. I remember some one says that the first t
time he saw Cromwell was before that personage (
had arisen to power, and when he was only a
member of parliament, and theta the observer was
only struck with his slovenly appearance, his ple-
beian look and his red nose, but he goes on to say
that he lived to see him protector of England, and
to consider him a person of distinguished bearing
and presence. Always Miss Watson was at-
tractive in my eyes, from my first interview with
(
her, when I was accompanied by Horsley, to the
present moment, but there was an air of hilarity I
and happiness about her now, which gave fell de-
velopment to her cheerful and self-sustained na-
ture. She took my hand as I returned to her side
and said so brightly and with such a joyous tone
"You look well-I have heard such bright ac-
counts of you-but why are you not' a controlling
spirit among those higher spirits, as well as among
the merely fashionable."
"Like Miss Singleton," I thought to myselfand
was about to reply when she asked-
"And how is your lady love?-you scarcely
mentioned her in your letter, except that she
was here. Did you want me to come-say, now
tell the truth, did you riot think that she would get
jealous of me?"
Pleased and perplexed, yet struck with a kind
of histrionic impression of the scene between Alice
and myself, I told Miss Wa son what had jast oc-
curr~d.
She looked serious.
"Indeed, I am sorry," she said. "There seems
to be some fatality that thrusts me between the
fair Baltimorean and yourself. Go after her and
make the explanation. I don't wonder that she
dismissed you with so much dignity. Our greet-
ing, you must remember, was not a mere rehearsal
-it was a reality. Long ago, Miss Clare, as I
told you at the time, liked not our mere stage play
embracing. This tenderness in our private theat-
ricals must, of course, touch her."
"Private theatricals," exclaimed I, piqued. "I
assure you, Miss Watson, I was not acming.~~
"Acting!" she said seriously. "No, toy dear
Russell, you are more of an actor in the

matter than I am, except the kissing necessary Ott
he stage, and that is harmless, for I never kiss
here with an appetite. I can say to you what
~oriolanus said to Virgilia:
'Now, by the jealous Queen of Heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, love, and my true lip
Hath virgined it e'er since.'"
If the truth must be told, I was about to enact
lardanapalus or Coriolanus, whichever the reader
)leases, with the lip of the actress again, when, at
he moment, Miss Upton entered the room, and
~ame directly upon us.
"Goodness, gracious!" she exclaimed, putting
~er hands before her eyes in affected blushing.-
'Excuse rue, IV~r. Russell," and in affected shame
rhe glided our of the room.
Really amazed I left Miss Watson, wh~ laughed
heartily, saying, "Miss Upton would make a good
actress," and went to find the manager, whom she
was anxious to see.
As I descended the steps she called after me:-
"I-low would you like~ oh King, to play Sarda-
napalus with me once more? and astonish these
Washingtonians more than you ever astonished the
Baltimoreans."
"1 should like to do it," I called back6
"Wait till we see the jnanager,~~
"it would be first ~ said I to myself as I
passed up street. "First rate-~--it seems to me I
could play the King better than ever."
In half an hour I was conducting ti4~ manager,
Mr. Simpson, to Miss Watson, an(l as I left the
door of the theatre with him (for we were great
friends) Miss Singleton's carriage passed by, with
Miss Upton and Alice itt earnest conversation in it.
They both, I thought, looked at me, but when I
raised ray hat they made no return to my salutation.

I must accomplish two things," I said to myself;
"reconcile Alice to me and appear as the kingly
Sardanapalus on the Washington boards. Hard
task. Yet why not accomplish it?"
Ill at ease-yet with a kind of not unpleasant
excitement either-I put on and put aside almost
every neckcloth and vest in my wardrobe before I
contented myself as to my toilette, and then it was
not contentment, it was resignation; and at the
u~naI hour. for calling I sauntered towards Mrs.
~ boarding house, to call upon Miss Sin-
gleton.
As I approached Miss Singleton's parlor I heard
her voice in earnest reprehension, and she was
saying:
"How dare you, Janet, hold conversation at the
corners of the streets with any of these persons who
call themselves gentemen?~~
"They asked me about you, mistress."
"How dare they to ask ~rou about me? flush,
I don't care to know what their asking might have
been. Take' care of yourself, Janet; if you mis-
behaVe here, after all the confidence I have placed
in you, I'll have nothing more to do with you-
you shall  o about your business-I won't own

A little bit of a prude thought I, is Miss Single-
ton, and 1 suppose should she hear about Alice and
myself and Miss Watson-especially should she
hear it through Miss Upton-she will take fierce
part against me, and the women here will cut me.
At this moment Janet came into the passage,
and I asked her if her mistress was' in, as I en-
tered her parlor. Without the least perturbation
of manner my fair representative received me and
bade me be seated.
"A boon," I said, "Miss Singleton, a boon. I
crave it on bended knee," and so saying, and suit-
ing the action to the word, I threw myself on my
knee before her, with bowed head.
"You did that gracefully," said she. "What
is the boon? I grant it if it is such as a lady may
grant.~~
"I want you, I said, to call upon my friend Miss

"With the greatest pleasure," 1 said.

"Ay!" said I. "She wants me to play the king
with her-Sardanapalus to her Myrrha"
"What! here on the Washington boards?"
"Here on the Washington boards!"
"Well," said she.
"What do you think of it?" said I.
"That you should be acting in a higher theatre."
"But just for the fun and excitement," I said.
"No, sir; there is no fun and excitement in such
a thing fbr a gentleman like you, Mr. Russell. If
you were poor, had a talent for the stage, and
meant to make it your profession, then it were
well enough. But I will call upon Miss Watson,
for I know I shall like her from what Mrs. Cromp-
ton told me. Where is Mr. Sangston?" Miss Sin-
gleton asked, after a moments pause.
"1 know not," I replied; and at this moment
Mr. Dudley and Cotesworth called, and I with-
drew. As I was walking along F street in irres-
olution as to what I should do, I saw Sangston
enter a celebrated Restaurant's, and I stepped in
after him. He seemed annoyed when he saw me,
but rallying, said:
* "Russell, you don't drink?"
I shook my head.
"Let's step into a private room," said he, and
we accordingly did so. Sangston looked sadly, yet
there was a defiant air about him, and something
which I could not understand.

Aight heartlessness to your lovers."
"AhI that would be discourteous-besides, wi
women can~t help it, if men will fall in love witi
us, can we?-how often must I tell you that'?".
Here a hack driver, who was driving rapidly
down the street, leaped from his box, and rushing
up to me exclaimed:
"Mr. Russell, Mr. Sangston has shot himself!"
"Shot himself!" I exclaimed. "Is he dead?"
"Dying, sir, dying!"
Miss Upton uttered a loud shriek and would
have fallen had I exhibited the least hint of an in-
tention to catch her; as I did not, s" '~"covered.
"Shot himself! dying!" she exclaime&amp; "Ev-
erybody will say its on account of Miss Singleton's
treatment of him."
Without pausing to say a word to her, I asked
the driver where Sangston was. "At your room,
sir," he replied.
"Drive me there," I said, leaping into his hack.
There was a crowd around my hotel, and in it,
and all the way up the steps into the room, which
was filled almost to suffocation. With, great diffi-
culty I pushed through. Sangston was lying gasp-
ing on the bed, while the crowd in unthinking and
brutal curiosity were hanging so eagerly over him
as to take the very breath away from him. With
a feeble hand he waved them off. The bar-keepdr,
half drunk, with the assistance of some others, had
taken off his coat and vest, and the wound, a deli-
cate one, in which you could not have inserted your

!" little finger apparently, was exposed, as the bar-
keeper was uselessly bathing it with water, for
's the bleeding was inwardly. I pushed the crowd
at away in that determined manner which is so effi-
as cient in crowds, and reached the side ot poor Sangs-
~.. ton. He gave me his hand, and made an effort to
speak, but his voice was too weak for me to hear
him. He made an effort to raise up, but I bent
~! my ear to him, and he said:
e "Pardon me, Russell-in your room to do this
e -it was desperation. Get them out."
~    "Gentlemen!" I said, "every one must leave
the room."
a A few made a move to the door; The rest see~ned
e determined to remain. The criminal, morbid and
e discourteous curiosity of many people under such
circumstances is astonishing. "Gentlemen," ex-
claimed I, in a tone of indignation, "this is my
room and this gentleman is my friend; you must
leave the room, every one of you."
My determined manner produced the effect, but
they left with reluctance. I locked the door after
the last man, nobody remaining but the bar-keeper
and myself.
"Have you sent for a physician?~~ I asked.
"Yes, sir,"said the bar.keeper.-"three of 'em.~
Poor Sangston asked for water, and I gave him
some.
"Its no u~e, Russell," he said. "Its rio use-
its mortal-my poor mother-but I was only a tax
on her."
"Are you in much pain?" I asked.
"No, no, not much. Miss Singleton-I should
like to see her-my poor mother."
Here there was a rap at the door, and a doctor
entered; he had scarcely done so when there came
another and another. They probed the wound,
and their looks plainly betokened a sad result.-
Sangston, with feeble breath, asked to be taken to
his mother's.
"Break it to her as gently as you can, Russell.
[am easier-I can stand it-yes, oh take me there~
Gentlemen, I am easy now-let me speak to Rus-
sell alone-I would be alone with him," he said
impatiently.
The doctors consulted apart for a moment, and
aCte~ leaving some directions which seemed to be
of no moment, they withdrew.

I

I followed them into the passage, where the
crowd stUl pressed, and conducted them into a va-
cant room to ask their opinion. They said, what
I had easily surmised, that they could not extract
the ball and that the wound was, in all probability,
mortal.
"Can he be removed to his ~ I asked.
"He waists so much to be taken there-it will ease
his mind."
The physicians thought not now; they would
call in the afternoon and decide.
"Break it to my mother easily," he said to me,
in quite an audible voice, as I re-entered his room
"Go, Russell, go yourself and tall her, won't you?
Some 'one may blab it out to her, and make it
worse." He beckoned me to him. "Put your
ear ~ he said, as he waved the bar-keeper
away from his bed. "Tell Miss Singleton-you
promise me?"
"'I promise you," I said, deeply moved.
"Tell Miss Singleton that I loved her more than
my own soul--that I was not worthy of her. On
your honor will you tell her so as soon as you see
her? I c6uld die easy could I see her bright face
once more, with the smiles on it it used to wear
when I was more than her slave! Go, Russell,
I proceeded to the bar room to get some proper
person to remain with him, and there found Dr.
Lockwood. Glad was I of his presence, and at
my request he went to the room 'of Sangston, for
he was well acquainted with him. Dr. Lockwood,
with all his talents, was one of y our ceremonious
observers of etiquette. As he had not been sent
ftsr-though in a desperate ease, and that in an at-
tempt at suicide-he refrained from entering the
patients room without being requested to do so,
though he had evidently conie to the hotel in his
anxiety to know how he was, and the nature of his
self-inflicted wounds. It seems that Dr. Lock-
wood was not on speaking terms with one of the
physicians who had been called, like the others,
indiscriminately in, and upon a point of professional
feeling, or rather, we should say of professional
etiquette as he esteemed it, arising, it may be, out
of a misunderstanding as to the administering of a
pill in some consultation or other. It appears
strange how. such a man could stand aloof from a

fellow creature's bed, when his superior skill, as
well known to himself as to others, could relieve
his pain, perchance save his life. But this was an
after reflection; for I threw myself into a hack and
drove with all speed to Mrs Sangstoa's. I was
spared the pain of communicating the sad intelli-
gence to her. Some thoughtless wretchin the fright
of the moment, had rushed in and told her that her
son had shot himself dead. The bearer of many
troubles as she had been, this was too much for
her, and she had fainted so lifelessly away that
fears for her own life were entertained. I found
Miss Singleton and Alice contributing all they
could, with-the aid of the servants, to restore her.
I offered roy hand to both. Alice seemed to take
it mechanically; she seemed so overcome by her
feelings. Miss Singleton was calm but white as
marble. When Mrs. Sangston at last came to her-
self, it was in a kind of stupefaction that she aeked
to see Henry, and kept exclaiming "my poor boy
my poor boy."
With some difficulty 1 placed the afflicted wid-
ow, maybe now childless, in the hack, and Miss
Singleton with Alice attended her to the hotel-
I following in another hack. As I was assisting
Mrs. Sangston out, I thought she had recovered
very much of her usual energy, for she stepped
without assistance into the, hotel. Miss Singleton
anti Alice remained in the ladies' parlor, and I at-
tended the mother to the bedside of her son.
"My dear mother, forgive me," he said, stretch-
ing his hand feebly out totake hers.
"Oh! Henry, Henry, why did you do this," she
said, in tenderness rather than in reproach, as she
placed herself beside him.
Sangston glanced at the Doctor and his attend-
a~it. Dr. Lockwood's quick sense instantly per-
ceived that Sangston wished to be left alone with
his mother, and making a sign to his attendant, he
remarked, "I will return in an instant," and they

toe boast die-I pity his' poor mother-I knew his
father well-of a noble nature is Henry, but the
example set him here he has followed to his de-
struction. It's his mother who is to be pitied."
I        I found Miss Sangston alohe in he parlor.
"How is he?" she asked.
I told her what the Doctor had said, and asked
for Alice.
"Alice ha~ stepped out to make arrangements
for returning with some friends to Baltimore. I fear
she has heard bad news. She did not tell me so,
but she seetus so sad. She looks ten years older in
a day,"
A pang, keen as that which from his own hand,
the pistol gave to my friend up stairs, pierced my
heart for my own folly, or rather I should ~ay vain
and giddy recklessness of the feelings of a loving,
sensitive and confiding woman. Let me say it-
as we sat in silence together, I forgot San gston aud
Miss Singleton and thought only of Alice. In five
words I told Miss Singleton what had transpired
between Alice and myself, and asked what I should
do?
"Do?" said she, in an almost vehemen t manner;
"How dare you act so after all that had passed be-
tween you and Alice? How dare you? Poor thing,
sh~ slept in my arms that night of my party, and
told tne every word that you had said to her-
your full explanation of your intimacy with Miss
Watson, which had so much grieved her. 1 be'
lived your explanation-I believe it now-but
think what this poor, dear child has suffered from
her impression of your attachment to Miss Watson
which grown up with her. Shame on you, sir. She
had so frankly consented to marry you, and that
so soon-every thing yielded to your impatient and
restless spirit-and you to make herso unhappy-
when you love her so-oh! shame, shame. Our
torture is but your amusement, is that it sir!"
Miss Singleton spoke this in such a tone of re-
proach that it stung me. and I could not tut reply:
"W bile you are heaping such reproaches on me
for my levity and recklessness or' the feelings of
one who loves me, have you no self-reproaches
over the condition of Henry Sangston?"

quick by my' own conscience as well as by her
words, I could not but make it.
She started as if a bullet had reached her heart
too, and covering her face with her hands, she
ejaculated to h herself in a fearful tone: "My God,
my God! Did he send me any word? Tell me
everything." I told her every word that he had
uttered. She ke1ot her face buried in her hands
until I concluded, then tossing back her somewhat
disordered hair, airid calming herself, she said:
"No, it could not be-he wanted energy-he
wanted character--yet his attentions-yes, let me
say it, his deep devotion to me, won me into ten-
derness at times, whieh. I own, I should not have
exhibited-and tIten his dissipation extorted scorn
-not to say a loathing from me which I could not
at times repress -which, I fear, I did not choose to
repress. But I am a monomaniac, it may be, on
this vice of intemperance-a monomaniac. I saw
my father-a born gentleman man of the noblest
impulses and loftiest talents and unbounded wealth
-I saw him the victim of this vice-made by it
cruel to his sla~;es and unkind to his wife-the
murderer of his friend in an unrighteous duel and
a death untd him self. Were Henry Sangston now
all my father wa s in intellect, in address, in wealth,
and in position, and had he this vice, I would not,
I could not, so help me heaven, have married him.
My t~ain ted mot her, who is in heaven, forbids me.
But without thi s vice, humlAe as Henry Sangston
is in this ~vorld' s goods, and in this world's honors,
I would have gi yen ~iim my hand with my heart in
it. DAy' friend,'' she said, "I honor your resolute
nature. You an d Alice must not torture each oth-
er any more," sh e exclaimed vehemently.
At this moth ent Mrs. Sangeton entered the
room. She said that Henry wanted to see me.
"If my poor boy' should grow worse let me know,
I charge you," she said.
As I left the roowl I heard her say:
"Oh, Miss Single ton, if you knew how my poor
boy Loved you."
I found Sangston astonishingly calm. He showed
mor e character with tI ic hand of death on him than
I h ad ever known him exhibit before. He spoke

who seemed to have an instinct in such matters,
left the room and closed the door after him, he said:
"Russell, it is easier t&amp; die than you think for,"
-and a smile of bitterness passed over his face, as
he contiuued:-"when you have nothing to live
for. After you left me here I saw Miss Molesby-
I told her to get Cambden to vote against the see-
retary-I told her how she could do it. She likes
me-there is at least one woman that likes me-
but she is jealous of Miss Singleton-she thinks as
she likes me that other women must like me also.
2 She refused to do what I asked her most perempto-
rily-we quarrelled-I drank, drank, drank, when
I returned to your room-knew where your pistols
were-and this is the result."
It was deep in the night of this same day.-
~Sangston had insisted, upon being removed to his
mother's, and his mother had resolved to gratify
him, though the physicians had advised to the con
trary~ Miss Singleton had prevailed on Alice to
remain, and Sangaton had expressed the wish to
see Miss Singleton before he died; and she had ta-
ken Alice with her into his room. lie was too weak
to speak when Miss Singleton entered, but he took
her hand and held it close in his, while the unut..
terable longing and tenderness with which ho
gazed with hi~ glazing eye into her face is daguer-
reotyped on my memory now. The Rev. Mr. F-
of the Episcopal Church, had impressively prayed
beside him; and, raising himself up, he took his
mother's hand and placing it in that of Miss Single-
ton, he closed his eyes in his last sleep so gently that
we knew not at first that his spirit had departed.
That night I was setting up wit~ the corpse of
the poor suicide. It was after midnight. Alice
was staying with Miss Singleton, and the whole
house had retired to rest except the watcher with
me and myself, when Janet entered the room in
which we were sitting, next to that in which the
body was laid out, and said that she had heurd the
bell and had stepped to the door and that there
was a lady in the passage who wanted to see me.
Wondering who it could be, I passed into the pas..
sage. A thickly-veiled lady st~od before mewhom
I knew at a glance to be Miss Molesby. but as her
disguise showed that she did not wish to be recog-
nized, I merely bowed to her and asked her com-
inands.

I

friend of Mr. Sangaton's, sir-I
disturb his family or friends-but I should like
the way by the passage door so as not to
my friend in the next room, and entering
that where the body lay, I pointed to it without
saying a word. She spoke not, but uncovering the
face she gazed on it earnestly, and, as I thought,
with a look of resolution which surprised me.
Taking a pair of scissors from her bosom she cut a
lock of his hair and withdraw before I could step to
her side to open the door for her.
The next day, in the afternoon, Sangston was
buried in the Congress burying ground. I rode
out with Mr. Cotcsworth and another. The chat
about worldly matters which is always rife at fun-
erals-mayhe we would drive away the sadness of
the occasion-was on this occasion about the mm-
isterial nomination of G-. as minister abroad..-..  N
"I understand old Cambden made a glorious speech
against him this morning-glorious," said Cotes-     2
worth. "He got him rejected. The old fellow,
for one of his years, is too much of roue, I admit;
but we all have our faults and he is a true patriot."
When we reached the ground I saw a solitary
carriage nol far from the gate, in which was a sol-
itary female. I surmised who it was. As the pro-
3ession was forming to go to the grave she beck-
oned to me. I stepped for a moment to the side of
the carriage which was not far off.
"Mr. Russell," she said with a look almost of
exultation, "I have revenged your friend-a proper
part for me one would say-I trust Miss Singleton
will perform her part and support the poor widow.
whose son's heart she has broken."
Sadder and wiser grew one and all under this
affliction. Alice and I were entirely reconciled,
and I returned with her and Miss Singleton to Bal-
timore, where, aided by the powerful influence of
that lady, Alice was persuaded upon to give me
her hand "before the holy man" within a week
after our arrival.
Gentle reader, we part now, but I trust only for
a season. Dangers and deaths and temptations and
trials and triumphs are before me, should I ever
recount them to you;-but until I can take up my
pen with less interruption than now, I must bid
you adieu.
