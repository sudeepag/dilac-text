THERE is not a more pleasant city, whether for love, fun, or adventures, in the Eastern world, than Manila, the principal port of the Philippine Islands. It is under Spanish rule, and has 's0 remained for the last two hundred years, and presents all the peculiar features of a large Spanishcity, with its costumes and, its customs, its trade and its convents, its loves and its jealousies, its handsome women and delicious firuits, its peculiar dishes, and' its haughty Dons and insolent soldiers. Manila is only three days' sail from Hong Kong, and the merchant princes of the latter city are often glad to leave their busy cares and -the dreary wastes of that portion of China, and steam over to the Spanish ; province, where youth -and beauty are sure to greet them, and luxurious living 'and enticing amusements repay the truants for their trip. The climate, during the dry season, which lasts about severi months in the year, is delightful. A clear sky, and a'delicious breeze, which sweeps over the city, fresh from a magnificent' bay, cooling the atmosphere both morning and evening, render'- the sunset promenade upon the Calsarda so attractive, that' a foreigner would sooner think of foregoing his cheroot, than i. miss directing his steps across the stone bridge which-spans the, Pasig, regularly after dinner, between five and eight o'clock.' At those hours the regimental parades take place, and the brass: )i    10       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. bands discourse music for the edification of the gay throng, who ride and saunter along, exchanging the compliments of the day, retailing the latest scandal or the most .remarkable news. Dark-haired ladies, with eyes like liquid fire, lean back in their carriages, and a flash of their bright optics tells more than their lips dare to confess. Wrinkled mothers and duennas watch the gallants, and are ex- tremely officious to prevent lovers from exchanging a single word in private; but in defiance of their precautions, stolen glances and secret signs convey meaning known only to those intended, and many a private rendezvous is agreed upon, while parents imagine their daughters little think of lovers, or aught else but confes- sionals and repentance. Still the gay throng passes onward, and with the crowd mix priests and men of .all nations. The Englishman, with his bold, defiant air and sandy whiskers; the American, with his thin face and care-worn brow, wondering whether the cargo upon which he has ventured half his fortune will arrive at its port of destination in safety; the mercurial Frenchman, thinking of nothing but love, adventure, and pleasure'; the swarthy Spaniard, with dark looks and sullen aspect, if a gallant regards the lady of his love with more than usual interest, or presumes to smile upon her in any other capacity than a friend of the family; the awkward China- man, with his pig-tail andrwide trousers, meditating upon the profits which he expects to reap by a sale of paddy, and appear- ing courteous to all, while in his heart he despises the throng for its waste of money in riding in carriages as long as feet are able to support the body; Mestiza girls, with scanty clothing and voluptuous forms, and long, dark hair nearly reaching to their knees, flowing in, the -most profuse. abandon over their necks and shoulders, chewing betel-nut, and spitting a blood-red secre- tion, which more than once has been mistaken by foreigners for the vital fluid from the lungs,--all these characters, and many others, can be seen of a pleasant afternoon upon the Calsarda, for then the wealth and beauty of Manila are abroad, and all flock to that celebrated promenade as readily as our citizens seek the Common, or Londoners Hyde Park. I will tell you, however, before I proceed farther, how I hap- pened to become a resident of Manila; for I have nothing to con" ceal, and much to reveal, and it is necessary that the reader   ARRIVAL AT MANILA.         " should understand my position, and the reason why I, a stranger, leaped from a ship, and got quartered with lone of the richest' and most influential Dons of the town,. The house with which I was connected at Hong Kong made up its mind that money could be gained by purchasing rice at Manila and shipping it for China; but to carry on the business extensively, it was necessary that one of the partners, with a knowledge of the Spanish language., should reside at Manila, watch the market closely, and purchase at the best advantage. I was luckily selected, and, armed with letters of credit and introduction to our correspondent, Don Arturo, a wealthy Span- iard, with immense pride and a pretty wife, and also with notes to Messrs. Russell Sturgis & Co., I bade a joyful farewell to China, and after four days passage arrived in safety at the place of my destination.                     \ Of course, th instant I presented myself at the residence of Don Arturo hose spacious manrion was located in Binondo, separated from the city proper by/the Rio Pasig, I was welcomed with all the hospitality of a true son of Spain, and in spite of my strong declination, was compelled to take up my quarters with him, where I spent many pleasant hours, and quite a number of  wretched ones, yet wholly unable to escape without giving serious offence to the Don and his fair Wife. At length I made new acquaintances, and under the pretence: of desiring a week's shooting, would leave the house' of-my;, entertainers and -remain absentrftil courtesy compelled me to' return. , On the left bank of the RI Pasig, about five miles from Manila, surrounded by cocoa-nut trees, mango trees, and luxuriant vegeta- tion, such as only the most rich tropical climates can produce, stands a number of whitewashed buildings; and during the long: summer afternoons, when the river boatmen have ceased their songs, and th6 washerwomen suspended their clothes-thrashing  upon the smooth rocks, the buzz of a thousand spindles, and the panting of a steam engine as it regularly performs -its work, can; be heard, and creates feelings of intense surprise in the minds of strangers, who are aware of the Spaniard's a-version to labor-' saving machines, or to any innovation upon the forms of his ancestors. The engine and the spindles are engaged in the manufacture/   oi    12        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. of rope of all sizes, from the mighty hawser to the finest lead line, and is the only cordage factory of any magnitude in the Eastern world, or was, at the time I write, in the years 18-. The enterprise was formed by American energy, carried through by American intelligence, and was then, and is now,'for all I know to the contrary, entirely under American control, and owned- entirely by American capitalists. The machinery was purchlased in Massachusetts; the long rope-walk was built, and then taken apart and put on board a vessel that sailed from Boston; and lastly, Massachusetts mechan- ics were employed to go to Santa Mesa, put the whole in com- plete order, and remain in the country and superintend the works, with the condition of owning a certain number of shares in -case the enterprise was successful, of which there was some doubt, owing to the superstition of the natives and the jealousy of the government, which feared to give Americans a fair foot- hold in the country, on account of the peculiar ideas which our countrymen entertain respecting liberty of speech and action. The enterprise was successful. After a sickly existence at first, Messrs. Huckford & Allen, who were the resident superintend- ents, gradually found that their wealth was increasing with their experience, and that atsthe end of their engagements they could return to the United States comparatively wealthy, and no longer sleep with weapons under their heads for fear of midnight at- tacks, or carry concealed pistols during the daytime to defend their lives, in case a workman -should take a fancy to the clothes or the watch which they wore; for a more treacherous race of scamps never existed upon'the face of the earth than the Manila Mestizos, or half-castes. They will cut your throat for a dollar, if they can do it with- out being required to display bravery; they will steal all that you own, if your back is turned. even if ten minutes previous you had saved their lives from an anaconda or a wild buffalo; they will cheat you with unblushing impudence, and lie to screen them- selves; they will murder you for having an amour with their wives or daughters, and then sell both to the next European they chance to meet; they will gamble their last shirt away, and steal their neighbor's; they will quarrel among themselves for hours at a time, and yet not come to blows; and lastly, they will share their plunder with the priests, who coolly take their portion, and   FIELD SPORTS.           13 give absolution with an unconcern for the crime that is truly refreshing in so warmn a climate. Such are a few of the peculiar characteristics of the race which the Spanish hold in subjection by the pure force of military des- potism; and perhaps it is as well that the natives have cruel masters, for kindness is entirely thrown away when meted out to them. At Messrs. Huckford & Allen's residence, at Santa Mesa, I was a welcome guest, for Americans were scarce upon the island, and what few there were were as clannish as Scotchmen. Frequently would I mount my horse, and leaving word for my servant to follow in a banco with a change of linen, escape from the heat and bustle of Manila for a quiet residence of a few days at the factory. Then Allen, who was my senior by three years, would lay out the sport which we should pursue, and was never so happy as when, with dog and gun, we paddled up the river and shot pigeons, deer, or got a crack at deer. And when we returned Mr. Huckford would lean his head upon his hand and listen to the recital of the sports of the; day with all the enthusiasm of a true disciple of Nimrod - happy to think that we had enjoyed ourselves, yet never for a moment- regretting that he was unable to leave the factory while Allen was- absent, so that he could participate in the sports. "What plans have you laid out for to-morrow?" inquired Mr. Huckford, as we drew back from the tea table and lighted our cheroots by a flickering flame fed by cocoa-nut oil. We had returned home after a hard. day's tramp, during which we had slain two deer and a number of birds with plumage like a rainbow, but which the cook had seized with guttural expres- sions of delight, and uttered a promise to prepare them for break- fast with curry and rice. "We think of trying the woods just above San Pedro Macati. We met a lancero this afternoon, who stated that he had seen large numbers of deer there within a few days," answered Allen. "Then you had better start before daylight, for the deer will seek the most sheltered spots before the sun gets high, and I don't think that it is safe within the darkest recesses of the woods," re- plied Mr. Huckford. "Danger?" cried Allen; ' :why, iwhat danger can there be to two well-armed men? JIf you mean ladrones, we should not   "       LIFE IN THE -EAST INDIES. fear a dozen, even armed with muskets of the most approved Spanish pattern." "The ladrones will not trouble you," replied the head super- intendent, "simply because men on gunning expeditions carry but little money upon their persons. No ; I allude to a more serious consideration. The anaconda is a dangerous fellow to meet in a wood, and you know that he seldom gives warning of his at- tack."  I could not suppress a shudder, for I had seen the mousters in all their wildness and power during my residence in the island, and I confess that a close inspection was not agreeable. "I think that I shall leave the forest of San Pedro to more mighty hunters than myself," I said, after a moment's hesitation. 6' I have-no nerve for -encountering the eyes of a serpent. The fate of all Englishmen who would not take advice is still in my ears." "Bah!" replied Allen, with a smile; "I know of a pair of eyes that are mucli more dangerous to you than those of an anaconda. With a steady hand and a good rifle a snake can be overcome; but whoever heard of a second Joseph in this enlightened and uncommonly fast age?" I observed a peculiar smile upon Mr. Huckford's face, and I was just about asking Allen for an explanation of his words, when the dofgs in the yard set tip a loud yelping, which betokened the presenc; of strangers. A moment after, the sound of carriage wheels was heard, and in a few seconds the vehicle stopped in front of the huce gate, which was always closed at night. "Who can have arrived at this late hour of the nxli lt? '"1ir. Huckford inquired. "Can't you guess?"Allen replied; and I thought that the words were accompanied by a significant look which Mr. Huck- ford seemed to understand, for he rested his head upon his hand and looked at me as though he had some trouble, which he was anxious to confide under strict injunctions of secrecy. "They must come in, I suppose," Allen said; and then raising his voice, he shouted to the servants, who were in the next room, to bring lights and open the gate to dmit- the visitors. "Ho, el casa!" shouted a voice that I thought I recognized. "Well, what is wanted?"replied Allen, stepping to the door which overlooked the outer court-yard; and shading the light with  ,                      .   'A VISITOR.     ,15 his hand, he allowed the flame to flash full upon the dark carriage beneath. '- My noble master, Don Arturo, is your visitor, and would fain speak with you right speedily," replied the coachman, who had served the old gentleman for many years, a'nd had been drilled like a marine during that time for the purpose of delivering mes- sages with proper pomposity, "Is he alone?"Allen asked; and I thought that I detected a sneer in his tone as he inquired. "His lady is with him, senior," replied the fman. ' Did I not tell you?"Allen asked, turning; to Mr. Huckford; but what he meant I didn't understand. The old gentleman did not reply, but made a gesture of im- patience, and lighted a fresh cheroot. "What. can have brought my friends here at this hour of the night?"I asked. "The road is none too secure between AMesa -and Manila, and the diamonds which Donna Teresa wears would prove a prize to a gang of ladrones. Her husband has but little courage, and his hands trembles when excited." "The night air is pleasant, qnd the lady needs exercise, I sup- pose," replied Mr. Huckford. I did not consider the reason a valid one, but went to the head of the stairway and heard the servant drive away the savage * doags and quiet them, and then unlock and unbar the gate and ad- mit the carriage. I heard the voice of my old friend as he left the vehicle and Nwks welcomed by Allen, and then I recognized the low, sweet tones of his wife, as the gallant Spaniard assisted her to alight, and led her up the stairway, preceded by the servants with lamps, I ' Ah, Guillermo, my friend, we find you at last!" exclaimed Don Arturo, grasping my hand with much warmth.  "We are very dull at home without you, and this time you have been ab- sent for many days." I returned his warm grasp and bowed low, as the wife, in all her queenly beauty, swept past and acknowledged my salute with a flash of her bright black eyes, that was like a shock of electricity to my nerves. The servants placed chairs for the visitors, brought fresh coffee and additional cigars, and then vanished like ghosts.   16        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. )   ;  "By all the -most holy saints, but you have treated us most coldly, Guillermo," the Spaniard said, while, sipping his coffee. ' Six days absent, and not a word during all that time. Diablo I I began to think that something serious had happened." And did you imagine that we were incapable of taking care of our friend?"Allen asked, turning to the lady and regarding her beautiful face keenly. "Santa Marie!" she replied, with a careless smile; "I had but little thought of the matter." I have passed a number of days in hunting and roaming through the forests," I said, i and have yet a few engagements with Senor Allen, vho has promised to find me deer in abun- dance." 4"And you forget that I promised to show you to-morrow the prettiest Mestizas girl in Santa Mesa," cried Allen. I saw the blood flush into Donna Teresa's face, and Or eyes sparkled like diamonds as she listened. "' For shame l"I said in English; L' the lady does not under- stand such kind of jokes. Don't make me worse than I am in her eyes." "Did you not say that a gentleman wished to see the Senor Guillermo in Manila?" the lady asked, turning to her husband, and speaking in subdued tones. "To be sure; and I nearly forgot to mention the matter. A Chinaman is desirous of disposing of ten casco loads of rice, and will sell cheap for cash. You must see him in the morning with- out delay." ' I have already done so: to-morrow he will present drafts on your house for payment," I replied. I saw a shade of disappointment cross the face of the lady, and I wondered at it. Don Arturo required an explanation. "' The Chinaman, learning that I was at Santa Mesa, took a banco, and came up the river this afternoon. I found him here when I returned, and completed the bargain in ten minutes." "Then our journey has been useless," replied the Spaniard, turning to his wife; but she did not answer. She seemed oc- cupied with her own thoughtstand her glorious eyes, veiled by long lashes, were cast upon the floor. "No, not useless," I replied, " for I am positive that Senors Huckford and Allen are grateful for the pleasure of your company.   A LITTLE BY PIAY.         17 This house rarely opens its doors to give admittance to ladies, so that when they condescend to visit "us we extend a hearty wel- come." The lady raised her eyes, and darted a glance, rapid-as light- ning, at my face; but, quick as she was, Alien sawr it. "Let me see," I continued, in a rausing tone; 1"I have been here six days to-day, and during my absence from the city I have  not exchanged a word with lady or Mestizas before this evening." - You are mad," muttered Allen, in English, 1' and are doing all you can to feed " I I did not comprehend him, and indeed I1 was regarding the wife too closely to pay much attention to his words; and I felt happy when I saw that she smiled upon me- for my virtuous habits, and that her eyes looked more soft after receivingfhe in- formation. "We must return to the city," the Spaniard said at length, glancing towards his wife ; but she made no response. "You will remain with us till morning," Mr. Huckford said, although I thought he spoke rather coldly. The Don looked towards his wife for instruction.  If we return- we must have an escort, for the hour is late for travellers," she replied. "If you will go I shall accompany you," I said. "We can- not think of letting so much beauty run the risk of insult from every roving band of ladrones." "But you forget that I accompany her," cried the old Span- iard, with dignity; and had I not known him I should have cer- tainly thought that he was a man to fight to the death. "True, but what can one man do against a dozen?" "Die," answered the, son of Spain, solemnly, placing his hand upon his breast like a knight of St. Louis. "Let us end this discussion," the lady exclaimed, with a haughty wave of her jewelled hand. I cannot think of expos- ing the life of my husband We will accept of' the hospitality, of our friends, and remain here for the night." "I supposed it would come to that in the end," muttered Allen, in English; and as he spoke he rose, and gave the necessa ry or- ders to prepare the best room in the building, and to put the horses up for the night. I had always classed Allen as a cold and distant man in the         ,              . *  '  '    18        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. presence of ladies, and more than once I had joked him on his evident dislike to Donna Teresa. He had always repelled the imputation; b-t still I was satisfied that there was ill feeling be- tween the lady and him, and that I was in some measure the cause. At any rate, on the evening in question, after the lady had decided to remain all night, not the most punctilious could find fault with Allen's deportment. He was kind and attentive, and even brought out his harp, which the servants were forbidden to dust or look at, and placed it before the haughty beauty, beg- ging in humble terms that she would honor him by touching the chords with her delicate fingers. "Do you wish to speak with her alone?" Allen whispered, as he passed me. I looked at him in astonishment, and did nobt understand the meaning of the question. (' It's all right, my boy; I'll find an opportunity," he continued, mistaking my silence for assent. "Ho muchachos, traer vino"Allen shouted; and as the lads entered with decanters and bottles, the old Spaniard rubbed his hands with glee, land, regardless of his wife, challenged Mr. Huckford to drink the health of every person of note on the island.     l.  I loved the music of the harp better than wine, and while the rest were drinking glass for glass, leaned over the back .of Donna Teresa's chair, and chatted with her in a low tone. "Tell me," said Donna Teresa, while she was carelessly drawing her hand over the harp, " what Senor Allen meant when he spoke to you in English this morning." -' Upon my word, I have forgotten," I replied. "The subject 'was too trivial to occupy my attention when a lady was present." She darted a sharp glance at my face, as though to judge of my sincerity; but as she met my gaze of admiration, she colored, and swept the harp a few times as though endeavoring to recall a favorite air. "Will you never give up this dangerous pastime of yours? Can hunting be so fascinating that all society is forgotten, and all business neglected?" she asked. "I have few friends in Manila," I replied, " and I sometimes think that the less they see of me, the more of their esteem I shall possess." -   ,  {   DON A RTUROS SONG.         19 "You wrong your friends and do great injustice to my hus- band, who is never happy unless he can converse with you after the business of the day." "How can a man be unhappy, possessing so beautiful a wife?  I asked. She cast a reproachful glance at me, and then remained silent so long that I feared I had offended her, and was about to apolo-  gize, when Don Arturo, who was being plied with wine by Allen, and whose weak head was incapable of carrying all that he swal-  lowed, volunteered to sing a song, and commanded silence accord- ingly. 6"By the mass, I know not if I can recollect it, for 'tis forty years since I learned the lines while coming from Spain. Let me see; it begun thus:-  - "' The king has forty galleons laden deep with ore;  Our queen is full as rich, for-she has many more; [I     The Spanish ships are manned with braves -'" I Here the worthy Don grew inharmonious and hoarse, and while trying to recover the tune, forgot his song, plunged his' head into a huge glass, and drained its contents. I  You see how happy he is, and how much I am prized when wine is on the table. I should be proud of my husband.- should I not?" How scornful she looked at the old man, who had bound her to himself by vows which she could not break, lmuch-as she fretted under them. "You will return to the city with us to-morrow--will you not?" she asked; and when she spoke to me I noticed that her voice Was soft and gentle, and that her hauteur was. gone. : ' Not to-morrow," I replied. "Before your Welcome arrival, we laid out our plans for a day's shooting in Ithe woods of San Pedro. I must not disappoint amigo Allen." "Of course he is of more importance than myself.  Go by all means." She struck the harp a number of energetic blows, as though she elt indignant at the carousal of her husband; but in a few min- tes all expression of displeasure passed from :herface, and she was as handsome as ever. "I wish that you had never met with these people," she said2 {                 '       .,   * 20       LIFE IN THEBEAST INDIES. at length. "Who knows but something may happen to you while on expeditions of a dangerous nature? and then my husband would be blamed by your friends." "No fear of that," I answered, laughing. "My friends know that-I am able to take care of myself." '"Hark,' she said, suddenly, directing her attention to the ta- ble. "Don Arturo is talking of hunting." The old gentlenman was listening as well as he was able to Al- len's details of the day's sport, and he grew enthusiastic as he thought of the tramp through the woods, and the trophies to be gained by a good shot. "I go with you to-morrow, senors, and will do my share of the labor. I used to know a hunting song which I fain would sing when I awaken in the morning, but it has slipped my brain." "But your fair wife may object to your exposing your precious life," Allen said, with a glance towards the lady, which caused the rich blood to mantle her cheeks until they seemed to burn. "( I shall be very sorry if Don Arturo undertakes any such ex- pedition," she said. "Bah! you womenlknow not the pleasures of a hunter's life," cried the Spaniard, contemptuously. "My friends, we will start at daylight; we will kill many deer and much game, and when we return my wife will welcome us as heroes, and wreathe gar- lands for the most successfull hunter." "I shall do nothing of the kind," she said, firmly. "If you go, 'tis without my consent, and if you return -" "'Tis without your wish, hey?"Allen said in English. The lady turned to me for an explanation, and I could see by her flashing eyes that she thought the remark one calculated to humiliate her. "He says," I whispered,- and Heaven forgive me the lie,- ' that if he had a wife as beautiful as yourself, all the deer that roam in the forest would not tempt him from your presence." The beauty pouted for a moment, as though she was not quite satisfied with the interpretation; but just at, that moment old Maje, the best deer hound that belonged to the house, uttered a sharp cry, arose from the corner where he had been lying in the room, and looked wishfully in the faces of his masters.   A WARNING.          21 "What is it, Maje?"Mr. Huckford asked, patting the animal on his head.' The dog looked in his face with a wishful glance, and then ut- tered a prolonged howl. ' There's death in the night wind," Mr. Huckford said, thought- fully, pushing back his full glass untasted, and glancing uneasily at the open windows. I- How do you know that?"Don Arturo asked, with a shudder, as he rapidly crossed himself. "The dog can scent death an hour before it arrives, and he has never yet deceived me by his warding. Pray Heaven that none here are doomed." "Amen! May the saints preserve us. I wish that I was sgfe at my residence in the city., for I like not the quiet gloom that reigns here," muttered the 'valiant Spaniard. i    "Heaven overlooks us aial," Mr. Huckford said, piously; and' i while speaking he drew a pair of pistols from his pocket, and ex- amined the charges. "Yo'u are as safe here as you would be surrounded by a regiment of the best soldiers of Spain. If your time had come, force could not save you." "Go find 'cm, Maje," Allen said; and the dog,. with grave dig- nity, walked to an open window that faced the ]Pasig, put his paws upon the! sill, and snuffed the night air three or four times, but without uttering a cry or manifesting uneasiness. "It's not in that quarters' the superintendents said, exchanging glances. The hound retired from the window, and went to the second'one, which faced the city. A line of sheds, under which workmen prepared the hemp for the factory, was in view, enclosed by a high wall built of baked adobes. An active man could have scaled it without much trouble; but the instant the yard was gained a crowd of ferocious dogs, trained to make war upon the natives in the night time, would have devoured an intruder before he could i have secured a foothold.. For five minutes the hound stood at the window, snuffing the- cool breeze, which just stirred the leaves of the mango tiees in-the yard; but at length he retired fi'om the casement, and wandered slowly around the room, as though he was uncertain what to do. next., "Senor Allen, is there any danger?" inquired the Spaniard,   22        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. who seemed sobered by the sudden stillness of the room, and the mysterious proceedings of the dog. "We hope not," replied Allen, with an attempt to seem indif- ferent. "I care not for myself, but for my wife," Don Arturo mut- tered, with a glance towards the lady which she seemed not to heed. "There is no danger," Allen said, cheerfully; " and even if there is, we are stronr, and can protect her as well as ourselves. Let her retire with her husband to her room, and in the morning she will smile at the perils of a night at Santa Mesa." ' Yes, yes ; let her go to her room!" cried the Don, eagerly; but whether to shelter himself or, his wife was then a difficult question to solve.       / "I shall remain here," she answered, firmly; and all our urging could not change her resolution. "Perhaps the servants may account for the singular conduct of the dog," Allen remarked, as he strode across the room, and opened the door leading to their apartment. He called the ntames of the men, but there was no answer. The lights in the room were extinguished, and the fire upon the hearth was out. The hound had followed his master to the door, and after a snuff or two, uttered a fierce howl, and attempted to dash into the vacated room; but Allen prevented him, and shutting the door, bolted it. "They are there," he said, in answer to Mr. Huckford's look of inquiry. t Then we must arm ourselves, and if an attempt is made, re- pel it," was the firm response. Allen seized a light, and from a closet brought out a miscellane- ous collection of arms, from which each man selected what he desired, and began to prepare them carefully. Don Arturo looked on in astonishment, but did not offer to as- sist us. ' Tell me what all this meansf Senor Allen?" the lady asked, somewhat bewildered at the novelty of our preparations. "It means, lady, that the ladrones have heard that a lot of silver was brought here to-day, and they have a strong desire to possess it. The scamps are already in the house, and must i, .   "ADRONES.           23 have entered while your carriage was occupying the attention of the boys at the gate." i But the servants should have given an alarm," she said.

At any rate, I would not swear that the fellows are not concerned with the ladrones." Even while Allen was speakiong, he was employed in ramming down bullets and fitting caps to his guns and rifles. "This, is dreadful," murmured:Donna Teresa, pale as death. It is all your fault-you would come here to-night " ex- . claimed the Spaniard, pettishy. r"Peace," she said, so sternly, and with such a flash of her eyes, that the husband held his tongue, and watched the proceedings with considerable apprehension. "Now, then, out with the light, and let us wait patiently the result," Mr. Huckford said; and in obedience to his orders we sat in the dark for half an hour, and yet not a sound was to be heard excepting the dogs in the yard; and they appeared uneasy, and growled at intervals, as though not exactly satisfied with the state of affairs. I took a seat by the side of Donna Teresa, and I suppose that sh!e mistook me for her husband,-for I felt one of her hands'laid lightly upon my shoulder, while the other sought my'grasp, and remained there, with pulse beating mluch more regular than my own, although her flesh was full as warm to the touch; and-I must confess that I felt as though suffebring from a fever. I did not dare to undeceive her. I sat there and listened and held her hand, and thought that I should not object to remaining in the same position through the night. ,              - "Hush!" whispered Mr. Huckford; "I hear' the villains stir in the next room." '"May the saints forgive me all my sins," murmured the Span- ard, who was seated a few steps from his wife. I supposed that she would withdraw her hand from mine when e spoke; but ,she must have been busy with her thoughts, and ot noticed the remark. I placed my pistols in my belt, and moved my chair silently and   24        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "arefully nearer the lady, for she leaned heavily upon my chair and seemed to sleep. Quietly I put ny right arm around her waist, and drew her towards me; and then upon my shoulder fell her head with its profusion of hair, that was soft as silk, and wavy as Manila Bay during a typhoon.!I felt her sweet breath upon my cheek, and the temptation was tpoe great to be overcome; if all the moralists in the world had lEctured me upon the enormity of my crime, I could not have resisted pressing my lips to hers. ' There they are," again cried Mr. Huckford; but I have an impression that he was mistaken that time, for the noise sounded to me like a kiss.. The lady did not move her head from my shoulder; but the devil instigated Don Arturo to think of his wife just at that mo- rent. "Where are you, Teresa?" he asked; " at this hour of dan- ger I should be by your side." ? I expected that the beautiful head would be withdrawn from my shoulder with a slight scream; but to my surprise it remained where I had placed it, and the owne' exclaimed,- '( Remain where you are, dear, for I fear, if you move, that you will betray your presence to the ladrones, in case they qre listen- ing for a moment." "And Guillermo -where is he?" queried the old gentleman, with friendly interest. I was just about to speak, when Allen came to my rescue, and prevented my whereabouts from being known to the liusband. ' He is sleeping in a chair near me, Allen said; and then continued in English, "I hope that the old fellow hasn't got a lucifer match in his pocket; if he has, you'd better look to your- self, my friend." I 'made no reply; but I pressed the beautiful form which I held in my arms closer and closer, and my heart beat wildly, when I found that she did not resist. At this instant a hand was laid lightly upon the latch of the door leading to the servants' apartments, and a gentle pressure was made to force the door open. Not succeeding, all remained quiet for a few minutes, during which interval I could hear the beating of-the lady's heart.  "What will be their next move?"Allen asked. "I suppose that they-will stave the door open, or else batter  - WAITING.            25 down the patrtition. If we only knew how many there were I should feel like giving battle without; this delay," Mr. Huckford said. I thought of a plan that' would be successful; but I did not dare communicate it while I was sitting, for fear of revealing my position to Don Arturo. As delay was dangerous, I gently withdrew-my arms from the lady, and bestowing a second kiss on her red lips, crept silently across the room to Allen. "There's some one moving across the floor i" cridd Don Artu- ro, in alarm. "Be quliet, my friend; 'tis but the dog," Allen said; and the explanation was satisfactory, although I heard the Spaniard  multter, -  "I had no idea he was so, large." "Let us not wait for the ladrones to begin the attack," I whis- I pered to Allen; "because it's possible that they may send for } recruits, finding us prepared for battle. We shall be kept here in a state of suspense until daylight, and perhaps whle we are nodding, an entrance may be effected." "The only thing that we can do i  escape, and leave the building for the scamps to plunder, for which they would thank us, and repeat the experiment the first time that money was known to be in the house. 'That won't do, as long as there's three able- I bodied men ready to filght a little," was Allen's response. : "But what say you to -calling in the dogs quietly, and after they are all mustered, open the door and let them war with the black scamps. We can use our pistols, and by firing at random help the brutes considerably." Allen thought of the plan for a moment, and at length suggested it to Mr. Huckford, who agreed that unless the natives mustered in larg(re numbers it vould be successfuil. The only thing he feared was, that the ladrones would make a rtsh and carry the building before we could repel them. We at length convinced the old gentleman that the rush of dogs would- so dismay the ruffians, that safety would be sought in flight, and that all attempts to rob the house would be abandoned. Let the lady and her husband retire to the closet, and we will try the experiment," Mr. Huckford said. ' The dogs will be lilely, in their excitement, to bite them instead of our enemies,   26 f;LItE-IN TIIiE EAST INDIES. and that we must guard against. The lady is too fair to suffer ill treatment." Allen lighted a lamp, and its beams fell upon the terrified coun- tenance of the Spaniard, who, seated some distance from his wife, was waiting for the termination of events, and counting his beads with trembling hands; while the lady, with her dhtik mantilla drawn around her neck and shoulders, and her form straight as an arrow, sat without manifesting visible signus of fear, although but a few feet from us were ruffians who woult  not have re- spected her high po)sition, beauty, or wealth, and would have torn her diamond ear-rings from her cars, and laughed at her cries of pain, had she been sensible of the indignity. There was a strikipg contrast between the woman and the man, and I forgave her the look of contempt which she bestowed upon Arturo, even if there was but little conjugal tenderness in it. '"Three silver candlesticks and a gold one will I give to tle Church of the Saviour if, escape from this gang of thieves witl - out a scratch, or loss of m bey," muttered the Don, as Allen ap proached him.    }                 ' "Then come with me without a moment's delay. Guillermo, look to the lady and explain ourplans. She can understand them, and will remain quiet." \ I needed but a few words tirelate our project, and she listened so calmly that' I could have e raced her for her heroism, hadb I had a brotherts or a husband's iight to have done so. In the large apartment where we were besieged, and which was on the second floor, the lower part beingD devoted to business pur- poses, was a closet -where clothes were hung, and many valuable oddds and ends thrtust for conveuience-and security. It was larrge enough to hold half a dozen persons as long as they were inclined to assume a perpendicular, position, while two could sit upon chairs, and experience no inconvenience, even if compelled to remain there for hours. I removed all the weapons which the closet contained, for I feared that Don Arturo might not be the most proper person -o use one in case of excitement, and then I handed the lady to her allotted place, and was rewarded by a look that bespoke volumes of gratitude. "You will be careful, Guillermoi she whispered. "Do not fear, lady. I will sell my life before the ruffians shall    -             TrinE DOGS.           27 reach your retreat; " and I think I meant what I said, for some- how, I began to'look Upon Donna Teresa .no longer in the light? of an acquaintance, cold anld distant, but as a lovely woman, capable of inspiringa stoicI with passion. I mean not that," she cried, liastily. "I allude to your own danger. Be not rash and headstrong. I would rather give half my fortune than know that blood is to be spilt." "I'll give five candlesticks," muttered her husband, who thought that she was beseeching the saints for protection. "Five candle- sticks -one of solid silver, and the others excellent imitations. If that offer don't save us, tlere's little use in having saints." A noise in the adjoiningo room, as though. the ladrones had thrown off all disguise, and were determined to carry our quar- ters by assault, quickened our motions. With a hurried word of courage to the lady I closed the door, and was just in time to see Allen admit six huge dogs, of the mastiff and bloodhound breed, - with strong jaws and powerfil chests, ferocious as wolves starved for food, and capable of tracking a native even into the busiest portions of the city. They prowled around the room with sullen looks, and even appeared anxious to effect an entrance into the closet where we had concealed the Spaniard and his wife. They are in a delightful humor to-night," Allen whispered,' "and -will bite and tear like tigers. They scent the black devils, and are eager for a fray as the dee: hound, -which has to stand back when the others are disposed for a fight." The brutes did not utter a whimper to give warning to the rogues of the surprise whichh we intended,.being kept in subjection by the short whip which Allen :held iin his hand. "' We ae all readv," Allen said, addressing Mr. Huckford-; and he was just' about to give the signal for the bolt to be withdrawn from the door, when a tremendous blow was struck against the partition, that caused the building to shake from its foundation. They are showing their hands in earnest," muttered Allen. If we would only run for it, I dare say that -we should find the road free of our obliging friends, and they would only be too-glad to get rid of us." "The instant the door is opened," Mr. Huckford said, finding that the dogs were no longer disposed to remain quiet, " give the scamps a broadside from your pistols. As for me," he continued,   28        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. holding lip an old musket, with a bore like a blunderbuss, "I hav put in ta few handfuls of shot here, which I expect will scatte and do execution. The Lord fborgrive me if I am acting wrongo." The dogs: were collected near the door, and watched witl glowing eyelballs for the signal to commence the attack. The light in our room was extinguished to prevent the padrones fron picking us off before we had time to serve them with the surprise which we had prepared, and we rangced ourselves in such a nman ner that there was no danger of our shooting each other. Again was there a stout blow upon the partition, and I heare the boards crack, -and the dust descend in showers upon our heads. The dogs, no longer seeing the whip, uttered simultaneous howls of rage, and dashed against the door as though they de- sired to be at the bloody work without delay. "Let them go," shouted Mr. Huckfbrdl; and at the word the bolt was slipped, and the door thl'own open. 't Seize them!" we yelledl; but the dogs did not wait for the words.  With ferocious yells they sprang into the room where the ladrones were assembled, and then, for a moment, I was stunned by the discharge of our pistols, which we fired in rapid succession without provoking a single shot in return. The yells of the frightened Mestizos, as they sought to escape from the fierce charge, and the ,roans of the wounded, who had falleu and were- tramlnlpled under foot, were frilghtfill. Down the stone stair case iwe could hear- theml ttu mble, as they rushed over each otler;. but loud above all, the savage growls of the dogs ,as they bit, and shook, and worried their victims, were most ap- palling. ' At length all was quiet, excepting the fierce snarling of the doags; and when we ventured to' licht a laimp and inspect the scene of the slaughter, it made our hearts turn sick to witness the spectacle.        k It required the use lof the whip, used with, no gentle hand, to beat off the brutes, and turn then loose in the yard, where they attempted to follow the footsteps of. the flying enemy, but were prevented by the high walls, over whch the natives had sprung with but little difficulty, and made their escape in the wilderness' beyond. On every side were wounded natives, bleeding and mangled by   A . SAD SCENE.          29 dog and bullet, while the brick floor was slippery with blood, and covered with remnants of clothing, torn from the persons of the robbers, as they sought fto) escape from their ferocious enemies, Pieces of black cloth, about the size of the face, with apertures for the mouth, eyes, and nose, were also found in abundance, which showed that the ladlrones had taken their usual course to keep their countenances from being known in case of a collision' where there were lights. As there was no danger of anotherjattack that night, we re- leasd the lady and her husband from confinement; but the Don was too terrified to utter any words excepting praise S for his wonderful escape; and the, only way we could bring him to his senses was to pour half a dozen glasses of wine down his throat, and then make hiln take up his quarters upon a mat tress in the sitting-room, which was free of all marks of violence, and much more comfortable than a distant chamber, after the scenes throughll which we had passed, and were still to pass. As for Donna Teresa, she was composed as a heroine; and I think that she would have even offered her services to attend- the wounded, had she not known that we would have rejected them. Humanity demanded that -we should relieve the sufferings of the miserable wretches, who were crawling upon the floor, moan- ing for aid, as much as possible; but we could do but little until claylight, as none of us liked the idea of driving or paddling to Manila for a physician at thatl time of night, and run the risk of getting murdered to pay us for our charity. But we did .the best we could; and while binding up the fellows' wounds, we were careful .to get a good view of their faces, and found, as we ex- pected, that many of them were workmen who had been em- ployed in the factory ever since its commencement, and received wages which they could not obtain at any other business. One of the wounded men in particular, named Maquil, who had been appointed as a sort of overseer of a division of spinners, and who had always manifested the utmost attachment for Mr. Huckford and Mr. Allen, was foundl with a charge of shot through his right leg, and several bad-looking marks upon his arms and body, where the dogs had buried their teeth, and in one or two instances, torn whole pieces of live .flesh :from his limbs. "There is a man," said Mr. Huckford, pointing to the groan- ing wretch, " who has always received favors at our hands; yet   30        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. if I question him in regard to his being here, he will lie most out rageously. Listen and hear him." "You are badly hurt, IMaquil," my host said. "Si, senor,'" replied the fellow, with an attempt at a smile which was sadly out of place. "Anad you came ;vith the others to rob your old friends?" O, no, senor; I came to help you, but arrived too late to gel the ladrones to retire. I did not hear of the attack until an hour since, and then hastened here to save or die with you. The senor has been kind to Maquil, and he don't forget it. The saints have had you in their keeping,." "Did you ever hear a cooler lie told in your life?"Mr. Huck- ford asked, in English ; 'and I must confess that the fellow's im- pudence staggered me, but I should llave believed him if I lad not known the treacherous character of the natives. "Can yolu help the soldiers arrest the ladrlles who escaped?" Mr. Huckfbrd asked, in a low tone, so that those who were in the room should not overhear the remark. ' "Shall I get paid for it?- " the wretch asked.    ' ;' Perhaps."2 "Tl!en I think that I can; but I must have the silver before I perform the work." We left the liar and traitor to his sufferingus, for it would have been Useless to lhave induced the government to send in pursuit, even if good -evidence lhad been offelred, exposing the principal actors in the dranma. We could only feel grateful. that we had repelled the attack, and inflicted such injury upon our assailants as would cause them to remember it for many days, and be cau- tious how they struck a blow in' future.  "Donna Teresa feels a little nervous; perhaps you had better comfort and cheer her," Allen said, while we were clearing the room of the iujured.             / "What can I do for her happiness?"I asked. "Well, that is a question that I am unable to answer, and it is probalble that she would be in the dark as much as myself, if interrogated," was the dry reply. I saw that I could be spared from the work which I had helped perform; so cleansed the stains from my hands, and once more sought the presence of the lady, wAom I found seated by the side of her husband; and the latter, as though to show his contempt   A- INTERVIEWv.           1 3 for the danger through which we, had passed, was snoring most' unmelodiously, having drank freely of wine to drown all recollec- tion of the fight. Donna Teresa was leaning her face upon hler hands, and did not see me until I spoke., "There is no longer aIny danger," I said; " the ladrones have fled, and will not return. You are as safe here as you would be in Manila, surrounded by a regiment of the line." "And for my life, and that of my husband, I have to thank you and the other brave Americans. I should like to live in a country that produces such brave men," she said; and by the dim light I thought that she directed a look of contempt at the slug- gard by her side. "Tell me of your home," she continued, lay- ing one of her delicate hands upon my own, which was hard and rough through arduous sports in the forest and mountains; "I would know more of America than I do; I wish to hear of its customs and inhabitants, its climate and ladies." "What shall I tell you of the latter?"I asked her. "Tell me of their beauty, for I know that they must be hand- so'me." "They are' fair," I replied, "and very delicate; for our young ladies entertain an idea that health is not compatible with beauty."                     - Donna Teresa opened her large eyes with astonishment, and was inclined to be incredulous. Enjoying the most perfect health herself, and taught from an early age that illness was only to be avoided by plenty of exercise in the open air, to which add bath- ing and a regular diet, it is no wonder that she was inclined to pity the women of America, and wonder that they should fear the air at any hour excepting the night. Time flew rapidly wlile we were thus engaged, and I was surprised to, see the light turn pale, and the gray shadows of- morning steal into the room, while I supposed that it was near I midnighlt, and that three or four hours still remained for con- I versation. "I am sorry to disturb your tete-'-tete," Alien said, roltsin me firom my dream of love and happiness; "but it is necessary that some one should proceed to Manila and inform the mayor of what has taken place, and request a military commissioner to    32       I LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. visit the factory withhout delay, and remove the dead and wounded to the hospital." The lady started at the sound of his voice, and hastily drew her hand from milne; and I could see that she'colored to her eye- brows, when she caught Allen's look of mischief. "The Don has slept most soundly, I should judge, if he has snored at that rate all night," Allen said', with a malicious grin, which we were too wise to notice. "If we can start your hus- band, senora, he would confer a favor on us by proceeding direct to Manila, and stating the particulars of the attack. HHe could benefit us much, and save us thousands of questions, which as foreigners we should have to answer, but which he, being so well known, would escape. Dare you wake him, lady?"Allen asked.  She looked her disdain at the question, before she replied. "'Tis a piece of work that I leave for the most robust," she answered. "Shake the senor, and not lightly, for he sleeps soundly." Allen followed her-advice; but the hu'sband only tossed his arms about his head, as though fighllting desperately with over- powering numbers. "Ho, Don Ar-turo, awake! we need your aid!" shouted Allen. "One glass more, and the last. To the health of my wife," murmlured the sleeping man. "You see, madanm, that lie thinks of you always. He is a constant husband -is he not?" She did not reply, and Allen seemed ashamed of the question, for le laid violent hands upon the Don, and in spite of growls and protestations, soon had hinm- in a sitting position. "You Sleep sound, Don Arturo, after your hard night's work. Come, drink a single glass of wine, and then you will be thoroughly' awake. " The Old gentleman made no objection, and the liquor seemed to revive him. ' I dreamed," he said, 'u that I had fought desperately with ladrones, and that I had slain half a dozen in defending my wife." "'The dream was more real than such fancies are apt to be. Come, we want you to proceed to Manaila, and lay the circum-     A DISAPPOINTMENT.         33 stances of the case before the mayor, and then hasten back with a physician." "My horses and servant," muttered the Don. "Are in the yard and waiting. Your coachman pretends that he slept through the fight without hearing anything of it; but we may believe as much of that as we please." The Spaniard looked towards his wife, as though undecided what course to pursue. "Leave her with us until you return. Sle is nervous, and needs rest," Allen said. "No doubt, no doubt!"Don Arturo exclaimed, as he rolled his rich blanlket' around his form, and prepared to start; "she feared that I would expose my life to the knives of the assassins, and I believe that I was rather reckless durinag the fight. I will return in two hours' time, and then talk firther of'the matter. I will have soldiers here to investigate, or I'll give the mayor a piece of my mind that will last for a twelvemonth. Farewell, Teresa, and don't be uneasy at my absence ;" and with this part- ing show of tenderness, the Spaniard vanished, and in a few minutes we heard his carriage rolling over the hard road on its way to Manila. "Your roomn has been prepared, senora," Allen said, "and as you have passed a sleepless; and terrible nighlt, perhaps it would be better if you refresh yourself with a little rest." Even if' she was disposed to decline the offer, which I hoped she would, she could not overcome Allen's solicitations, add therefore retired with a stately grace that was charming to con- template, while her adieus were uttered in a voice, sweet as a first-class dulce. "That is hardly fair," I muttered, as she disappeared; f' I was anticipating an interview two hours long- " "So I supposed; but believe me., it is saf'ef to have her in her chamber with you on the outside, than to be sitting within a few feet of each other during the husband's absence. Too many pry- ing eyes would watch your motions, and carry reports to Don' Arturo, and it would need but a word to rouse his jealousy;to- fever heat." '"But we are alone," I said. "We-are now, but in a few minutes our servants will return, and they are quick to observe, you know." 3   34        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "Do you mean to say that you will receive the scamps, after they deserted you as they did last night?" 'I To be sure," Allen answered; " they are acquainted with our ways and wants, and even if we change, we should get men just as bad, if not worse, besides having-the trouble of teaching the fellows their duty." "But the rascals have been leagued with the robbers," I sug- gested. "To tell you the truth," my companion replied, "I am in- clined to think that they were; but we can't prove it, and of course the rascals will deny that they knew an attack was to be made. I hear Mr. Huckford at theim already. Let us go and listen to their excuses." We passed to the room used for the kitchen, and there saw three knaves, with marks of astonishment upon their filacs, listen- ing to the scolding which the superintendent- was adlministering, and looking at the wounded and dead Mestizos, yet there was no signr of sympathy for their countrymen, because they had made an attack and lost, and, therefore were not in & condition to share the plunder which they expected. "Which of you informed the gang that there was silver in the house?"Mr. Huckford demanded. "The senor is laughing at us," they whined. "We love the senor and his friends, and would have given information had wev known that an attack was expected." "Why did you leave the house?" "We knew that there was to be a dance the other side of the river, and we went, because we supposed that the senors would not require our services longer. We feel sorry at what has hap- pened, and will be more careful in future." "We will pardon you on one condition," Mr. Huckford said. The senor is kind--let himi mention the favor that he desires." "Discover the name of the ladrone who led the attack- last night, and where he can ,be found." With one accord the scamps declared that they knew nothing of the business, and that they should excite the hostility of their neighbors if they made any such movement; but we took no notice of their protestations, and pretended that the soldiers whom   A DESPERADO.          35 we had sent for would seize them as witnesses, and at length banish them fronm the island as mmIderers. Then they hlesitated a nd whispered' together, and at length re- quested permission to talk with the wounded men, which we granted; and after the lapse of half an hour, they reported that the man who had planned the attack and led it, was one Juan Baptiste, a fello w ho .had been the terror of the neighborhood for the last two years, and whlo held the natives in such subje'c- tion that there was not one who would refuse him a helping hand through fear.      1 The Spaniards dreaded the fellow, for he had inficted much injury upon the wealthy residents of Santa Mesa, and -many at- tempts had been made to capture him, yet without success.;. and there was even a reward of two thousand dollars offered for his- apprehension at one time, for a daring robbery and murder, which he had alone committed some ten months, before the attack upon the factory. The natives would gladly have betrayed the rascal for that sum, but iwere fearful of the vengeance of his friends, who shared his spoils, and warned him of danger when it was near. "X Where does this man find shelter?" Allen asked. He has lately lived in the swamps of San Macati, where no one dares venture but. those acquarinted," was the rcply of the servants, with ominous shakes of their head, as they thought of the dangers., Allen motioned me to accompany him to another room, where we could converse without danger of being, overheard. "Well," he said, " what do you thinkl of allowing Juan to con- tinue his career unmolested?" "How can we help ourselves?" ] asked. "By following him to the swamp, and making an effort for his capture." "The undertaking is dangerous and difficult," I replied. ' Not so dangerous as it appears at the first glance. We can take our three best dogs, and they will follow him through the swamps, and corner him, unless he is smarter than I think he is." I reflected on the matter for a moment, and then consented to accompany Allen on his disagreeable expedition; but first it was necessary that we should secure the consent of Mr. Huckford, and that we should start without delay.    , The superintendent was unwilling that we should incur the    Y  36      LIFE IN THS EAST INDIES. risk; but at lencgth Allen talked him over, and we made ready for the journey, taking good care that the. selvants should know noth. ing of our proposed expedition, for fear that they should manage, in some way, to communicate the alarm, aud thus defeat our object. We hastily swallowed our breakfast longr before the sun was visible, and then equipped ourselves in costumes suited for thle bulsiness which we were about to enter upon i for the character of the swamp was too well known to us to expect to find easy travel, and no obstacles of a serious nature. We wore blouses made of linen cloth, which fitted tight to our bodies, while for pants we selected the thickest that we owned, and found that they were none too strong before our return. To protect our feet we wore heavy sea boots, witlh long tops, into whichl we thrust our pants, as much to keep them out of the way as to prevent snakes from seeking a refuge on our bodies, and rendering themselves disagreeable. Our next business was to see that our rifles were properly loaded, and that our knives were in good order; and by the time we had accomplished that task, Mr. Huckford joined us, holdin(g in his hand a shoe made of untanned leather, and of monstrous dimensions. "I found this in the yard near the wall," he said, " and I am told that it is the property of Juan, who in his flilght dropped; it. I think that the story is cotrrect, for I recollect of seeing, no native in these parts who has so large a foot. It will be usefidl fobr the dogs, in findingo the fellow's trail." While Allen and Mr. Huckford were discussing the subject, I slipped quietly out of the room, and knocked timidly at the door of Donna T'eresa's chamber. I expected that she was asleep; but to my surprise, she opened the door, and looked somewhat as- tonished when she saw my costume. "How now, Guillermo!" she said; " what is the meaninc of your strange dress?" "I shall be absent from the faetory for a few hours," I replied, ' and I desired to pay my respects to one whom I esteem so highly before I go, fearing that you may be in Manila when I return.  "But where are you going?" she continued, her color slightly changing while she spoke.  "EAVE TAKIING.          3 '? But a few miles from here. I shall retuorn before nighlt, and hope to have a story-of interest to relate to yoll this evening, if you will promise not to leave the factory." T' I promise," she said, as she laid her hand upon mine,-in proof of her sincerity; and I thought that I felt a gentle pressure, which I ventured to return. i;' You will not expose your life while absent, for if you should, Don Arturo will be miserable. Remem,- ber that he takes a great interest in your welfare." I promised, and yet I was still reluctant to leave her, for she looked so melancholy that all my resolutions were forgotten, and I was more than half inclined to tell her that I loved her to dis- traction, and to ask her compassion. "Say no more now, but go!" she exclaimlxed, hurriedly, hastily withdrawing her hand, whllich I had forgotten to relinquish. I turned to discover the cause of her alarim, and saw one of the servants hastily retreating through a door which was nearly op- posite to where we stood. I ran after him to discover if he had listened to our conversation ; but before I could cross the corridor he had disappeared, and, furthler pursuit would have been useless. I returned to the lady, and assured her that no one was acting the part of a spy on our actioxls; but she did. not seem much com- forted by the assurance, possibly because she knew the Mestizo race better than I did. "'There is not one of them in thhe house," she said, hurriedly, "but would sell us for a piece of silver, unless he thought he could make more by keeping silent.  Not," she added, with extreme hauteur, "that ][ have anything to conceal firom my hus- band; but he is old and jealous, and trifles disturb him. Now go, and let me meet you at dinmer, or even before, if possib." She extended her hand as she spoke, and after a warm pressure I left her, more in love than ever, and inwardly cursing the ex- pedition which was to take me frorm her society, even for a few hours. I found Allen in the court-yard waiting my appearance; but he made no remark, and in a few minutes we had the dogs whichi we desired selected friom the pack, and put them on the scent. The animals understood their business, for they had been trained when young, so that we found no difficulty'in getting upo n the track of Juan, or, at least, the owner of the shoe. The dogs led towards the river, which was about one hundred  88        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. and fifty yards from the factory; and as Allen had expected that would be their course, he had ordered a banco to be stationed at the landing, so that we could cross without delay. The brutes, after gaining the edge of the water, did not utter impatient howls, but stoobd there in sullen silence, with their noses to the ground, or else looking wishfully to the opposite shore, as thoughlonging to be again upon the trail. ' They are in splendid humor this morning," Allen said, as he patted old Maje upon the head, and noted the fierce looks of the animals. "They tasted blood last night, and now they wish for more, and I sincerely hope they will be gratified; for if we can get hold of Juan we shall put a stop-to this system of pilfering which has been carried on for vears, and yet never received a check excepting when administered by the people'at the factory." While Allen was speaking, he called the dogs into the barco, and then we shoved off, and paddled across the stream. W e preferred to labor at the oars, so that the natives would not suspect our mission, and communicate it to the one we were in search of. Upon gaining the right bank of the Pasig, the dogs were sent on shore, but they gave no indication that the robber had lhtanded at that point; so, leaving the animals to follow along the bank, we reached San Pedro Maecati, 'which was not more than half a mile distant from the great swamp, where it was reported the outlaw kept secreted. CHAPTER II. THE  SEARCH FOR THE OUTLAW. - AN  OBSTRUCTION. - THE MONKEYS. - THE LADRONE. - THE FIGHT. ' LOOK at the dogs," Allen remarked, a few moments before we landed; and by their actions it Was evident that they had got on the scent, and only waited for the command to lead us in the direction of the swamp.  "The rascal must have swamn the river, and then escaped under cover of darkness to his retreat.    I            ON THE TRAIL.            9 Probably he is sleeping off the effect of his night's labor, so that, if we are lucky, we shall take him unawares." We secured our canoe, then gave the imnpatient doCs the signal to start, and with heads lowered to the earth, they followed each other, stopping every few ninutes .and looking back at us with  angry glances for not movingr at their speed, until the river was lost to view, and we began to enter a wild and uncultivated region, where pedestrianism was extremely difficult, and where our long- legged boots began to be of service. Here is where we are to take leave of the sun for the presents" Allen said, calling to the dogs, and checking their course at, the very edge of a dense jungle, which did not look very inviting, and seemed as though it was capable of harboring  all the ladrones in the country; as well as all the wild animals and serpents.  - Have you a fancy for visiting convents?"Alien asked, while we stood resting upon our rifles. "That is a question I cannot 'answer, simply because I never saw the interior of one," I replied. ' Then some leisure day we will visit the large building which you see in the distance, and which is called the Convent of San Pedro, and is under the charge of a holy father named Bon- venturo. He is a particular friend of mine, and entertains for me a profound respect, because I have sent him to bed on several occasions with more of a load in his stomach than his head could carry. ' He is not a believer in cold water, then?"I asked. He believe in cold water?' repeated Alien. "Why, he hasn't made use of a drop except to float his banco, and make coffee, for ten years; and if he lives ten years longer, he will have consumed more wine than any man on the island. He is a jolly old fellow, and can sing an amorous song or miournful ditty with admirable grace. I shall be happy in making you acquainted." "Provided we return in safety from this expedition," I mut- tered, as we shouldered our guns; and shoving aside the tangled boughs, we entered the great swamp, which was rarely visited by the Spaniards, for they entertained a correct idea that there was danger in its dark recesses and stagnant pools of water, and that it was safer to suffer the visits of lacldrones than to expose their lives by hunting them in such a suspicious place. The dogs led the way with glowing eyes, and we followed as    40        LIF E IN THE EAST INDIES. fast as possible; but the soil was soft and spongy, and although it received the impression of our feet, the tracks were soon erased, or filled with dark water, rank with vegetation and slie. We were positive that we were on the right track, for we frequently mDet with broken twigs, and a brief examination showed that the sap was still fresh and running, and that they must have b een disturbed but a few hours before. I also entertained an impres- sion that the course we were pursuing lead been passed over many times, for we were comparatively fiee of briers and underbrush, as contrasted with the foliage each side of us. On *we passed, bending low at times to escape the branches of trees, or else cautiously peering into a thiclet to discover the cause of the sudden rustlingr which we detected atmonr the leaves, and, perhaps, while we listened, hearing the low, angry iss of a snake as it glided into the darker recesses of the swamp, or plunged with sudden motion into the pools of stagnant water, and with head erect, wriggled to its hole, or disappeared mid the bushes. Soetimes it was necessary for us to leap from klnoll to knoll to escape the bor-holes, or else crawl upon our hands and knees through thickets almost impenetrable, while the dos took the easiest course, and swam the broadest places, yet were never baffled or thrown off the scent, and seeming more fierce and eager as we proceeded. Suddenlj Allen stopped and examined marks that attracted his attention, and we had no difficulty in tracing the footprint of a man who had Passed that way barefooted; and by comparinr the shoe which we   carried with the impression upon the soil, we found that they corresponded. "Here, Maje, tell us what that is," Allen said, addressing the hound, which hardly stopped to take the scent, when the brute looked in our faces and uttered a low, peculiar cry. " tlt will do, old boy, that will do. We want as little noise as possible in this place. I  have a notion that too much would defeat the object of our visit. Go on, now, and be a good do." The animal seemed to comprehend the words, and trotted along with his usual dignitd, while we followed as rapidly as possible, until suddenly the dogs uttered a suppressed howl, and, with tails between their leas, retreated towards us. "There is danger in our path of some kind," ttered Alen muttere'd Allen,   AN OBSTRUCTION.          41 stopping and scrutinizing the trees in our vicinity; but nothing was to be seen, and we attempted to urge the hounds along, but they obstinately refused to proceed, and nothing but fear of the whip prevented them from breaking oit in a chorus of howls, which would have alarmed the'person, we were in search of. Remain where you are for a moment, and lhave your rifle ready for instant service, while I make a short circuit, and see, if I can 'find out the trouble. Don't fire on any account, unless compelled to, and then be careful that your shot tells." I did not like the idea of being separated from Allen, but I wisely kept my fears to myself, although Z I watched his form until lost to view among the thickets, and half resolved to follow, on the ground that it was 4expedient for us to keep together in so dangerous a place. The dogs had left me for the company of my friend, and I was alone, with a death-like stillness reigning over the swanp, and my imaination conjuring up 'all sorts .of diseased fancies. I leaned against a tall tree, with leaves so thick that the sky could not .be seen above it, and awaited-the return of my companion; but while I meditated upon the madness of thte undertaking be- fore me, I saw a sturdy limb of a tree move and shake as though agitated by a violent blast of wind. I did not stop to think that when we entered the swamp the air was quite calm, and cno sign of a gale visible, because my thoughts were otherwise engaged; and I don't know that I should have moved from my position under the tree, had not a chattering monkey upon a sapling, a few rods off, suddenly ap- peared, and after staring at me for la moment, made a gesture of fright, and with a fierce cry disappeared. I started in the direction that the animal had taken ; but before I had gone two steps, the tree, against which. I bad leaned, was shaken from its trunk to the topraost branch, and a rain of leaves fell upon my head. Then I began to Iuspect that I was in a dangerous neighborhood ; and hastily glancing over my head, saw something, I could not tell at first what, whirling  among  the ,leaves, twisting and turning like gleams of lirhtning, and crack- ing the tender branches in its movements, and showering down leaves like flakes of snow. I think that I was not more than five seconds in placing the dis- tance of a rod between myself and the tree, and I don't remember ,q   42        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. to have once turned back to see whether I was clear of the danger that threatened me. What it was I knew not, but sus- pected that a wild animal had taken possession of the tree, and was calculating the propriety of making a meal of me, when its eagerness caused an alarim. I was not, on' the whole, sorry when Allen made his appear- ance and reported that the path was clear, but that the dogs still manifested symptoms of alarm, and appeared ill at ease for ani- mals like them.  "You don't look any too lively," Allen said, after a glance at my face; " what is the matter? Don't feel tired - do you? Take a drink of this; " and he offered me his flask. I did not refuse, although, while the bottle was at my lips, I kept my eyes fixed upon the tree, expecting to see it move every moment. "It strikes me," I said, returning the flask, " that the cause of this alarm is in yonder tree, and that the leaves hide some- thing disagreeable to view. If you don't believe it, go aid look." "I will do better than that; I will send Mcaje, for he seems as uneasy as a young woman without a lover, or a young wife with an old husband." The dog was directed todhe tree, and made one or two efforts to obey orders ; but all ended with a feeble yelp, and then he re- treated behind us. "Blast the dogs! have they lost all their courage!" exclaimed my friend, pettishy; '" they are frightened at their own shadows. If they won't go I will; " and cocling his rifle, he started for- ward, and gained a position where lie could command a view of the tree. I tried to dissuade him, but without avail; and for fear that he would think me but an indifferent sportsman, I moved a few steps in the direction which my friend had taken. ' I don't see anything," Allen exclaimed, with great self-con- fidence; but just at that moment the leaves of the tree rustled as though some large body was moving amid the limbs. The dogs uttered a suppressed howl, and retreated with their tails between their legs, and I heard Allen say,- "By jingo, it is!" an exclamation that was emphatic, but hardly explanatory; for he stepped back, regardless where he, put   1^Q 43 '!          AO ANACONDA-  , his feet; and the consequence was, he' fell into a miniature lake, and for a moment disappeared from view, but only for a moment. an cme to the surfce of t'he greeenwater like a sperm whale that ad been exploring the domains of Neptune for an hour or more, but, unlike the huge monster, he didn't look clean or com- fortable. Well, you are the dirtiest lookin lite man that I ever "I cried; and I could not restrain my laughter at his ludi crous appearance,.rom "Curse appearances! hle shouted, spitting the water from his mouth, and scralnbline- upon dry land. I should say so, to jud ge' from yourlooks. Youhave grown green within five minutes."'" "I can't stop 'to thanlk lyou for your complimentary remarks, Allen said, picking up his rifle, whichh he hadl thrown from his bhanl w h en. fai ng, and tlereby Saved it unltnured, " because in yonder tree is sereted the biadgest anaconda that I ever saw." It was now my turn to jump; and i think that I'placed about twenty feet between myself andthe tree in les than two seconds, and even then did not' feel safe from harm. "I should judge that the animal desires a breakfast off of the dogs; but perhaps he would not object to a man, if fat and tender." "And clean," I cried, and you have described me to a hair. There is no danger of the snake's troubling you, if at all particular about his food, for your loolis are repulsive.'" Allen smiled' in a ghastly mannerr, and walked to a favorable position for getting a shot. "What do you meanto do'?"I asked. "See how near I can come to the brute's eye at a rod's dis- tance," was the reply. "Then I wish you a good morning, and will thank you to show me the nearest wray out of this mud hole." "There's not half as much danger as you imagine," my friend said. "Wte can stand here and give the reptile a few shots, and see how he looks whlen wounded."i Perhaps the anaconda understood his meanng, and was dis- posed to begin the fight, and not remain in-the tree like a coward; for suddenly there was a whirl othehe leaves,:and they fell thickly to the ground. While we were watching, head with flaming    " 7  44  /   LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. eyes was thrust fi'om the folinge, and then' fbollowed a neek, an displayed tWo hude oins set well back in the jaws, while ton(rue, red ats blood, darted back ard for th, as thool1 h lextremel, desirous of tasting our flesh, and judgin, of it by actual miasti cation. For a few minutes the head waved back and forth, with its eyes still fixed upon us, or the dogs- we couldn't tell which; and those ponderous jaws, opening and closiung, as though dle- ' sirous of comnmencing a fight, if we were really disposed to begin one in earnest. The spectacle was truly a fascinating one, and I could think of nothing but how I should escape from suclh anu unwelcome neighbor without exchai n blos; forI imin ed, with good cause, if the anaconda could show  six feet of length t by the way of a joke, tht tlere must be some twenty-five feet more out of sillt, coiled upon a limb, and ready to be sed if occasion should require it, althog lh it rather seemed to me that n e were looked upon with some  contempt, as though unworthy of much attention. Even the dogs were not disposed to provoke a fig-ht, for they kept at a  respectful distance, and only slowed their disgust by snarling and exhibiting their teeth , powerless aainst a monster possessin the strength  and quicklness of an anacondla. A few yards from is a   troop of nonkeys were assembled, watching our 1motions with some inteiest, and explressinrr thchir hatred of the anaconda by furiou-s grimaces-a nd insulting gestures, yet taking very good care not to venture near the snce, and aI- ways skipping nimbly firom their position to a better one, if tilhe reptile offered to move from the place where he had taken up his quarters. One old fellow, who seemed aged enough to be the grandfather of the party, was quite human in showing his dislike and his family watchied his proceeding s vitlh grave satisfaction, and applauded him like a gan of first-class claqueurs. The old 'monkey, after chattering, for a few minutes in a hiah key, would seem to choke with choler, and unable to proceed fr, want of breath, or words, wouldl then shake his hairy fists at the snake, and clutch handfuls of leaves and hurl them at the monster; and all the monkey tribe would chatter their applause, and en-'        ft ' SNAKE AND MONKEYS. courage the old fellow to renewed attempts ar Insulting their enemy. The snake seemed to care as mpch for the monkeys as he did for the dogs, and continued to move his head back and forth, re- gardless of' the leaves that were hurled at him, or the scoldings he was receiving. At length the gray-headed monkey exhausted his invectives, and turned his attention to Allen and myself, and as near as we could understand the language he used, he seemed to say that we were cowards and did not dare to assail our equals; and we even got pelted with leaves; and what was of more account, some of them dropped upon our heads, which seemed to please the juvenile ;members of the troop very much, for they chattered with delight, and every one commenced plucking leaves fand hurling them at us; and during the contest the snake was forgotten by our apish friends, although I never lost sight of him for more than a second at a time. On any other occasion I could have enjoyed. the contest, and entered into the sport with a keen relish; but knowing that a twenty-five feet anaconda was regarding us attentively rather de. tracted from the amusement, for I did not know how soon the snake would commence unfolding his tail, and desire close quarters.  "t Well, are we to stay here all day?"I asked, watching the snake in the tree, " or shall we make the best of our way out of this swamp?"                      . "We are hardly prepared to leave yet," Allen said, " because we have not accomplished the object of our expedition. I in- tend to try the effect of a bullet on the snake's -head, and then I am with you." As Allen spoke, the whirole troop of monkeys remained silent; but the instant he concluded his remarks there was a wild clatter of contempt, and leaves were again hurled at us with renewed energy. Allen raised his rifle, and waited for the snake to remain sta- tionary for a few moments, when he fired. There was a wild scream of terror from the whole troop of chattering monkeys, and they disappeared amid the trees like lightniig. The ball struck the anaconda near his flaming eyes, and a jet of blood spurted out and fell upon the leaves beneath like huge "       LIFE-IN THE EAST INDIES. rubies. The tree upon whichi the snake rested was shaken to its very roots, and swayed to and fro as thouclgh a hurricane was raging. Branches were broken off, with reports as loud as the dischcarge of pistols, and those limbs which were too large for even the reptile to contend. successfully with, were stripped of leaves as completely as if' done by hand. The struggles of the monster were terrible, and more than once I felt like imitatiung the monkeys, and disappearing as fast as possible firom  the scene. It seemed imbued with miglty strength, for it uncoiled its tail, and after thrashing it about the body of the tree for a few moments, recoiled it around the trunk, and tightened it until I thought the very sap would exude. " Now is your time," cried Allen, who ,;as quietly loading his rifle. '"Fire, and see how quick he will relax his hold." I took deliberate airm, and fired. The ball struck one of the folds, cut its way through, and penetrated the tree. The coils were quickly unwound and concealed for a moment, for the snake was now roused to madness, and seemed determined to destroy every- thing within reach. The saplings in the vicinity were kinocked down, the bushes were torn up, and showers of dark water were scattered upon us as the monster struck at everything it could reach. "End the contest," I cried, as the head of the anaconda rested for a moment, covered with its blood, and the fierce eyes glared upon us more wicked than ev6r. ; Pooh!" cried Allen; ' we haven't begun to see the fun yet." If 'he called it fiun to look at the snaike's contortions, I won- dered what lie would consider serious business; but before I had time to ask the question, the reptile gave a convulsive twirl with its tail, and as it did so a huge piece of decayed wood was struck, and sent with considerable force into the air. ' He's in his flurry," shouted my firiend, using the expression of a whaleman ; and like those gentlemen NwNho search the seas for light, :e crowed--somewlhat too quick; for the stick of wood descending with a velocity in accordance with natural causes, struck Allen upon his head, and broke into a thousand differenteu pieces; but the dirt and dust adhered to his face and shoulders, and if possible he was a dirtier-looking man than when he emerged from the stagnant water. To add to his perplexity, the blow was sufficient to prostrate    A DEAD SNAKE.. him  ; and as he sat upon the damp earth, hardly conscious what hit him , I ould not help laughing; and I thought the old gray- headed monkey would have joined in my mirth and chuckled with delight. .? "Darn it, I don't see anything to laugh at! cried Allen, pettishy, as he cleared the dirt and the dead wood from his face. "' If you had a looking-glass you would say different," I cried, still watching the snake. "I have no doubt that I am a picture at the present time;but I look full as well as you did last night when kissing Donna Teresa in the dark. Come, I've got you there." "Say no more, and I'll promise not to laugh again for a fort- night. What I did last nig ht was accidental?' I low it was) and so was the falling of the stick of wood upon my head; yet you see how disastrous it has been, acnd how soiled nay clothes are. There can be a moral deducted from the affair that will benefit you., if you will only profit by it." "This is no time to study homilies," I replied, not relishing the conversation. "Kill the snake, and let us continue thc tramp, for time is flying fast." Allen shook his form, and then cleared his rifle of the dirt and dust. The anaconda bhal revived considerably by this time, as was now engaged in gnawing the tree upon which it was coiled yet not workling, with energy; for it; had shed much blood, and ovals growing weak rapidly. "I will bet an ounce that I put a ball within one inch of hi left eye," Allen said, slowly raising his rifle, and turning to me to see whether I took the wager. I nodded my acceptance, for I was tired of the sport, and wished to end it. My friend fired, and the head of the anaconda, after one con- vulsive struggles fell to the ground and remained motionless; but the tail still continued to work as though life was too dear to be relinquished by a few small wounds. Almost with thee fall of the snake the troop of monkeys re- appeared upon a neighboring tree, and chattered and crowed with delight; and the old gray-headed rascal once more gathered leaves, and while he made grimaces at us, did not fail to fling them at his defunct enemny, and boxed the ears of his numerous progeny because they did not follow his example, instead of   48      -  LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. staring at us like greenhorns who had never been from home or seen a stranger during their brief existence. We waited for a few minutes to see whether the anaconda was not playing a deep game for the purpose of getting us within its reach; but its head remained quiet, even if the tail had not ceased its convulsive workings.  At length we ventured near enough to punch the fallen monster with sticks; but it gave no sign of animosity at the indignities which were heaped upon it, and taking  courage from its dormant state, we examined our prize, worthless to us, but of great value to the natives, who con- sider its fat as inestimable for the cure of certain diseases; and had they known that an anaconda was lyinrg dead within three miles of the factory, hundreds of the Mestizas would have flocked towards the great swamp for the purpose of securing a tithit and carrying it home in triumph. The dogs could not be induced to approach the carcass, al- thoulgh we endeavored, by threats and kindness, to get them to do so; while the monkeys, on the contrary, ventured as near as they possibly could and keep out of our reach, but they watched our proceedings with great interest, and chattered as we moved about as though speculating what we wduld do next. Re-enforce- ments of the saucy knaves continued to arrive every minute, and in less than lhalf an hour after the death of the snake, there were at least five hundred, of all sizes, swingg from the trees and demanding of the gray-headed veteran how their enemy perished. Such a chattering and screaming could only be equalled by an immense concourse of people, tallking on some subject dear to their hearts, such as a new bonnet-or a bit of scandal. A few'of the boldest of the tribe even ventured upon the tree, around the trunk of which the snake was coiled, and sat upon the branches and made faces at us, or else imitated our gestures, and looked so cunning that for some time we -committed many absurd acts simply for the pleasure of' seeing the troop endeavor to comprehend and imitate them. But the dogs began to grow impatient, and time was too valuable to waste playing with apish visitors. We saluted them with a polite bow, and a hundred heads were ducked in acknowledgment of the compliment, and a hundred shrill cries were uttered, which sounded like sardonic laughter; and I know that the scamps told each other that we had braved the danger, and that they were to reap the benefit.    ,*      '     ' ON THE TRBAIL AGAIN.        49 The old grandfather uttered a parting benediction, and hurled a handful of leaves at our heads, as ,we called our dogs, and once more put them on the trail, 'while we followed close at their heels-in pursuit of the ladrone Juan, whose captuae we had neg- lected for the purpose of destroying the anaconda. The doaos took to the trail quite readily, and seemed much relieved when the dead snake was left fa- behind. The brutes, perhaps, had learned from instinct that the anaconda was a very bad enemy to meet, in the forest, and that courage anid ferocity availed but little afgainst the enormous strength and rapid movements of the snake, whose power is so great that even the stoutest buck that roams the valleys is no match in a fair fight, when the anaconda has the protection of a tree, and uses it as a retreat, The natives tell wonderful stories of the power of the anaconda in the eating line, and quite a number, of Mestizas, who pre- tended to know all about the' habits and disposition of the. snake, were ready to swear thatfthley had seen them gorge deer that weighed at least one hundred pounds each, first prepar-. in^ them by breaking every bone in their bodies, until the mass was a complete jelly, and aflter covering it with slime, slowly swallow it, and then lie dormant for a week, awaiting digestion. At such times the anaconda is incapable of offering resistance if attacked by wild beasts, or natives armed--with lances and knives, and quite frequently the monsters are destroyed in this manner. But I amn inclined to think that the natives have, with their usual exaggeration, magnified a doe of two months old into a full-grown deer; for, during my residence in Manila, and while on hunting excursions, I probably met with eight or tea auacondas, - not torpid thngs, such. as are shown in cages and boxes in this country, and are called full-grown boas, but power- ful snakes, twenty-five, and even thirty-five feet long, and meas- uring in circumference as much as a man's thigh. I have watclied them for hours in the dark forests, of Macati, while they sported upon the branches of a tree, or else lay dormant, - and with eyes that seemed half closed, watchng the sports of monkeys as they played within a few feet of. their retreat, and provoked an attack by their boldness. I have seen the listless monsters suddenly raise their heads,   ,I    50        LIFE IN, THE EAST INDIES. and like lightning dart upon the unlucky ape, and after one shrill scream of terror, its life Would be crushed out as easily as a cook can break an eogg-shell. It sometimesl- happens that an anaconda, tempted by the fine weather and the warm sunshine, or else in search of a dinner, will stray towards some native village, and take up its quarter, in a mango tree, where it will remain for hours, waiting with exemplary patience for the approach of a dog, child, or ever 'full grown native; and woe betide either of the above named, if they venture within the circle of the anaconda's reach, for it can dart with the quickness of thought upon its prey, and give nc warning of its intentions. But death speedily follows the attack. for tihe enraged natives muster in strong force, hurl sticks and stones at their torpid enemy until it is incapable of mischief, then sharp knives complete the work. The dogs grew more excited at 'very step, and it required a stern word to prevent them from breaking out in a cry, and starting in hot pursuit of the robbed; Suddenly we emerged from the trees and brush, and reached a sheet of water which contained a small island in its centre, nearly destitute of trees or bushes. The land was high, and looked very rich and invitingfA and we thought that we could discern signs of cultivation in small patches upon the side that greeted our point of observation. On that island," said Allen, " is Juan Baptiste." "'Your reasons for the supposition?"I asked, refreshing my inner man with la drink from a flask, and after a careful olhser- ' vation of the neighborhood, taking a seat under a tree, where ] lighted a cheroot, and prepared to enjoy myself.  "My reasons are these," replied my friend: "you observe that the dogs have led us to the edge of the water, and make nc effort to find another trail. This shows that the man we are in purlsuit of embarked on a raft or boat, and, it is probable, has a home on the island. Reason number two is, that the lake is full of alligators, which makes his retreat much more secure." i Tell me how you know that the lake contains alligators; and A I'll agree to your reasons," I said. , "Willingly, You see that the dogs don't offer to take to the water, and that they stand quite a number of feet from its edge, and eye the lake with suspicion            .   A LAKE'ODF ALLIGATORS.         5 I acknowledged that I had noticed the circumstance. ( Well, the brutes know much more than they can express; be assured that whenever you see dogs, in this country, refus- ing to follow up a scent by crossing water., it means that black monsters, as dangerous as anacondas, are lying at the bottom of the water, and that the hounds know it." "Convince me that your reasoning is just, and I'll believe it,"' I said. Alien picked up a piece of bamboo, and threw it into the water so gently that but a slight splash was heard. Before the ripples upon the water had spread to the circum- ference of a quarter-acre lot, a dozen black spots were seen upon the surface, where they remained dormant, as though without life or animation. "Are you satisfied?" .Allen asked. H"Hardly," I answered. "The black spots which you claim as alligators' heads may be logs of wood." "Then plunge into the lake, and. I'll bet you any money that you will never leave it alive." I declined the wager on purely personal considerations, for I began to have an inkling that Allen was right. To further test the matter, I hurled a stick of wood into the lake, and as it, struck the water, the black heads disappeared, but, after a short lapse of time, re-appeared, and remained silent and motionless as before. "What sport we could have," Allen remarked, "if a dead buffalo was lying at the Water's edge, and we had no business before us. We could then witness a struggle and a war that we should remember for many months. Huge fellows, with tailsas powerful'as young right whales, and jaws filled with ivory, would attack alligators smaller than themselves, or else struggle with their equals, and sink to the bottom of the lake in mortal combat.' Then we could sit here and test our skill as marksmen by firing at their eyes ,or under their flippers-the only places, I believe, that a rifle bullet can make an impression." "Don't conjure up such sporting scenes until our present en-i terprise is completed, for, to tell you the truth, I have a desire to sleep at the factory to-night. If we do not reach home, Mr. Duckford will feel concerned at our absence,     52        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.  "Is there any other person at Santa Mesa who will feel disap- pointed unless you return?' asked Allen, witlh a slight laugh. I suspected his motive in asking: the question, so disdained to reply, but puffed out volumes of smoke from my cherootj for the purpose of hiding my confusion. For a few minutes neither of us spoke. We sat watching the island, and the dark heads of the alligators, as they moved about the surface of the water, eying the party on shore with ishlful looks, as though they hadn't had a real feast on dog or man for many days. At length Allen threw away his cigar, and drew his huge hunting-knife, as though he meant mischief. - We have wasted time enough," he said. ' Now let us be- gin the dangerous and difficult work before us." "Do you expect me to swim the lake, with a knife between my teeth, to defend myself against the alligators, or will you, perform that service?"I asked. "I anticipate nothing of the kind," Allen answered. "I ex- pect that you will help me cut bamboos, and from them we can build a raft that will carry us in safety to the island." There were no other resources, and the idea seemed practi- cable, although I had much rather have had a good stout banco in which to trust my precious self, for I thought that it would require but slight exertion on the part of the monsters of the lake to, interrupt our voyage, anid give it a disastrous termina- tion. If Allen had any such fears, lihe did not show them, for he went to work with a will, and almnost before I was on my feet, half a dozen strong bamboos had fallen, and awaited trimming before launching upon the lake. We continued our work with energy, and yet with so much stillness that not a sound was heard three rods from where we stood, although we often glanced towards the island to see if there were any signs of life, and if any person was watching our movements; yet we as often failed to detect the presence of a human being, and I was almost ready to swear that Juan was no longer on the island. Our raft was speedily constructed, and in a thorough manner, for bamboo, noted for its buoyancy, was plenty, and large enough to answer our purpose. The largest sticks were placed as stringers, and on them we piled the smaller ones, securing all with twigs of the same mate-   A BAMBOO RAFT. rial, until our raft was twenty feet long, ten wide, and about six inches deep. After it was built it required but little strength to launch it, and this we were enabled to do in spite of the alligators, which were prowling around in shallow water, and even rubbed their noses against the raft, as though desirous of' testing its strength. "Are we to take the dogs?"I asked. "Of course; we shall find no difficulty in coaxing them on the raft, and after we reach the island they will be of great service." "But suppose we are attacked while on the voyage? We can't use our rifles without giving an alarm, and that would de- feat the object of the expedition." Allen mused a moment, and then announced that he had a plan that would give us the advantage, decidedly, over the den- izens of the lake, in case they'were disposed to impede our progress. He lashed his knife to a bamboo, and held it up in triumph. "What do you think of that for a weapon?" he asked. "I will tell you after I have seen how it, operates," I replied; if it will keep the scaly devils firom carrying our raft by storm, I'll praise your ingenuity, provided, of course, I live long enough. If I don't, you must apply to my executors." We secured two long poles to propel our raft, and then, part- ly by force and partly by persuasion, got the dogs upon it andcl shoved off; and never ddid mariners upon the ocean, with but a few spars to cling to, exercise more care than Allen and myself, as we slowly pushed our way towards the island, surrounded by dozens of alligators, who swam round the raft and eyed us with no good will for our boldness in thus invadi-ng their domains. One fellow I noticed in particular, for he seemed like a mon- arch whom none dared to approach; and as he swam around the raft his companions made way for him by darting one side, as though there was danger in being too familiar. He was a mag- nificent specimen of the alligator race, and must have measured at least twenty feet in lengtli, while his jaws were ponderous, and seemed capable of crushing, a man with but one bite, and swal- lowing the pieces without mastication. "Don't you think," I said, turning to Allen, " that the atten- tions which this ,black rascal is bestowing upon us deserve some return?"    54        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "He won't trouble you," Allen replied. But just at this mo- ment, as though to show that ble spoke without authority, the monster struck his bead against the raft with so much force that it staggered us, and the dogs uttered a low whine of terror, and clung to the bamboos with tooth and nail, as though they knew what their fate would be if precipitated into the water. "Don't stop," Allen cried, still urging the raft through the water; but the alligator could move ten feet to our one, and as we neared the shore the old fellow semed disposed to dispute our passage, for he gave us another gentle rap with his head, and then dove under the raft and lifted it nearly a foot out of water. "Cuss him, I can't stand that!" muttered Allen, who was nearly thrown overboard by the collision; and grasping his long pole, with the knife at the end, he watched for an opportunity to use it; and he did not have to wait long. The alligator slowly rose to the surface, and eyed us with a look which seemed to ask, C How do you like it?" Allen watched a good chance, apd as the -side fin was raised for a moment, made a lunge, and buried the whole length of the blade in the monster's body. Instantly the tail of the animal made its appearance, de- scribed a curve, and before I could understand how the thing was done, one of our dogs was flying through the air, all doubled up in a heap, as though paralyzed by the powerful blow which he had received. The poor brute struck the water a couple of rods from us; but before he had time to utter a yell, or to swim a stroke, a dozen black snouts suddenly appeared, and dragged him to the bottom of the lake. I glanced hastily towards the spot, and saw a few bubbles and a slight tinge of blood upon the water; and then, a moment afterwards, the monsters were. swimming around the raft, looking more greedy for the slight taste which they had obtained of flesh. ' That tail might have .hit one of us," I remarked to Allen, as I urged the raft along towards the island, anxious to escape from such disagreeable company. ' It might," he answered, laconically. "Your friend is about to pay you another visit," I cried, as I saw the alligator which Allen had wounded suddenly re-appear from beneath the raft, and slowly work his way to the point where Allen was standing.   A DIFFICULT PASSAGE.  "If he will let me alone, I'll promise not to molest him. again. I think that he has the advantage,cr for with one fair blow of his tail he could sweep the raft, and then where should we be?" It did not require the aid of a prophet to guess, and as the sub- ject was one that was lnot debatable, I plied my pole as hard as possible; but the monsters seemed to gain strength, and made the water look ten shades darker by their presence, as they darted to and fro beneath us. r'Two or three times nmy pole was seized by younger members of the family, who were apparently not suf- ficiently enlightened to distinfguish between a piece of bamboo and a human leg; but a slight bite was sufficient to convince them that they had made a mistake, and that wrood was not very nu- tritious. As we neared the shore our escort grew bolder, and even thrust their heads upon the raft, to the great terror of the dogs, and the exceeding discomfort of two human beings, who wished with all their hearts that they were safe at Santa Mesa, drinking wine and eating mangoes, or else chatting of romance and chivalry with Donna Teresa. More than once I glanced towards our rifles, thinking that the time had arrived for their use, even if the re- ports did give the one we were in search of warning of our ap- proach, and thus defeat the objects of the expedition. But Allen shook his head and urged more activity in pushing for the shore, and I was willing to run a little more risk for the sake of captur- ing Juan, and thus revenge ourselves for his audacious attack upon the factory. "A few minutes more and we shall be beyond their reach," whispered. Allen, lancing with his knife the boldest of the mon- sters as they thrust their heads upon the raft, or else dove under it for the purpose of shaking us off; but if one was driven off wounded, another was ready to take its place; and thus we fought our way to the shore, which we gained with' thankful hearts, too anxious to escape from. the dangers of the water to think of the terrors of the land, for a resolute man could have held us com- pletely this mercy while we were securing the raft and examin- ing omifies. The dogs bounded to the shore with many expressions of de- light for their escape; and as soon as -we were ready, they set themselves to work to :find the spot where the outlaw was in the. habit of landing. This was but the labor of a few minutes, for    I     ,56       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. the scent was still fiesh, and the dogs eager for. action, and ready to show that they Were \rilling to make atonement for their dis- play of cowardice when we encountered the anaconda and the marine mnonsters. * The brutes led us up the steep slopes of the island, through a grove of bamboo; when we suddenly emerged upon a cultivated spot, Whlere yams and sweet potatoes were growing in proftusion, but there were no signs of a house, or a habitation of any kind. The dogs trotted on, and we followed as fast as possible; but the brutes were too etager to await our motions, and we lost sight of them for a few minutes, when we were suddenly startled by their deep baying, which told that they had run their game to a stand. Instead of following the trail of the dogs, we diverged to the right, and moved carefully to a point where we could get sight of' the animals and whatever object they were looking at. For five minutes we crept' through underbrush and rank grass, until at length we gained a small clearing, in the centre of which was a huge mango tree; and amid the branches, twenty feet from the ground, we saw a bamboo hut, thatched with leaves, and evi- dently intended as a habitation by the person we were in pur- suit of. The dogs were howling most merrily when we reached our point of observation; but no signs of life could we observe in the hut, and we should have supposed that Juan had left his quarters before our arrival, had we not been certain that the dogs were not liable to make mistakes. As the hut contained numerous apertures, we were not positive that the outlaw was not watching our movements from one of them; and as he was known to be a good shot, we thought that it behooved us to remain quiet, and see what course he would take. For half an hour we remained concealed, but there were no signs of life in the hut, and I began to grow wearied with the siege, and once more wish myself back at Santa Mesa. "This is as bad as battling with alligatorsi' I cried, yawning, and incautiously exposing my body above the bushes. I had hardly spoken when a loud report was heard in thetree, and a ball whizzed within six inches of my head, and was buried in the earth twenty yards beyond. s That is not a bad shot for a muskets' coolly remarked Allen;   T]HE BAMBO() HUT. and I agreed with him most heartily, as I dropped behind a clump of bushes. ,' Lucky the fellow used a musket instead of a rifle, or this day would have ended your adventures," wats all the consolation which I received from my friend. "I can't believe that he can shoot as well the second time,l I remarked. "Just stand up for a moment and see." Allen declined the pressing invitation, alnd for half an hour longcer we watched the tree and the hut in hope of getting a glimpse of the outlaw; but he was too careful of his person to ex- pose it to strangers. "Why don't he shoot the dogs?"I asked, half inclined to do so myself, for I was getting tired of their infernal din. r"That is a question that I have asked myself half a dozen times, but I cannot answer it. Of course the brutes are too well trained to stay there and be shot at; but the fellow might kill one, at any rate, before the other would take the hint and retire from the range of his gun." "Bamboo is light," I said, glancing at the ihut and then at my rifle. "Who knows but a chance shot might tell?" Allen took the hint, and nodded his head in approbation. I took a careless aim and fired. The ball crashed through the bamboo, and the dogs, recognizing the report of the rifle, re- doubled their howls, and sprang wildlyupon the tree, as though they would tear the occupant limb from linmb, if he would only give them a chance. The outlaw made no movement to show that he was affected by the shot, and I suggested to Alien that perhaps I had killed him:. "That don't look much like it," my friend remarked, as a ball struck the bushes in frout of him, and then, glancing, whizzed to another part of the island. "Diablo! this is far from in- teresting!" "A very good shot for a musket.  Keep quiet, and don't move. Lucky it wasn't a rifle," I cried, using, the same language - which he addressed to mie when my head was in danger of fly- ilug lead. We were glad enough to crawl on our stomachs to a new spot, where the outlaw would not be likely to suspect our presence, and thus escape from his chiance shots; and I will confess that I wished the fellow to the devil with hearty good will, and inwardly vowed    58        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. that I'd never undertake another expedition, even if Charley Allen made one of the party to seduce me with his plausible reasons for everything that he desired to engage in. The sun poured down with awful warmth, for it was noon, and not a breath of air was stirring; and to add to our discomfort, the mosquitos began to find our retreat, and were inserting their bills with fearful effect upon every portion of our body that was not encased in stlrongr cloth ; and I will add that I was rejoiced with exceeding joy when I saw a cloud hoverinrg over my friend's head, and half a dozen endeavoring to find lodgment upon his nose, to prevent which he was constantly employed with both hands, and sonmetimnes with his feet. 1"How do you like the fun?"I asked, with a malicious grin; for I had taken the precaution of brining a pair of stout gloves with me; so my hands were well protected. "O) I don't mind these few" he replied, with an attempt at calmness. "When night sets in we shall probably have clouds of the insects to contend with, and,until then I mean to retain my good nature." To hear a man talk about stopping all night on the island, when everything thatwas dear and pleasant was miles away at the factory, was not to my fancy; so I grew desperate, and resolved to end the contest as soon as possible. The dogs had barked themselves hoarse, and were lying at the foot of the tree motion- less, as I could see by pushing the bushes one side; but even my movement, slight as it was, roused them, and they were all atten.. tion and ready for work. But I saw something of more im- portance tlian the dogs, and I was not siow to bring my rifle to my shoulder, when Alien interrupted me.  What is it?" he asked. "Do you not see the face of the ladrone peering at us from one of the windows of the hut?"I said. Charley did not answer, but snatched up his rifle, and after a hasty aim fired. "Missed himn, I'll bet a dollar," I cried. "I'll take the wager," wras the quiet response. How shall we settle it?" That is easily done. Do you hear the dogs recommence their haying fiercer than ever?"     1A RACE FO: LIFE. I nodded, but still kept my eyes :fixed upon the tree and the hut, in hopes of getting another view of the robber. "Well, be assured that they smell blood freshy shed, and that Juan has got a wound that will prevent his escaping from us, even if he should kill the dogs." I did not reply, for at that moment I saw a limb of the mango tree shake as though ain anaconda was winding its heavy folds, around the branch, preparatory to making a dart. a"The Lord preserve us from another snake," I thought, for I had had quite enough of them to last me for one day. Suddenly the branch of the tree., which I was watching, sprang up to its proper place, and then I heard a heavy body strike the earth. The dogs uttered terrific yells, and seemed to change their position from the foot of the tree to one farther off. '* The ladrone is escaping," I cried, the thought suddenly re- curring to me that he had dropped. from the tree as a last resort, and intended to make for some secret hiding-place on the island. ' It can't be possible!" exclaimed Allen, starting up. "The dogs would tear him to pieces before he had run ten steps." ' He has run more than a hundred, and yet you hear'the brutes in full cry." Allen listened for a moment, and then seized his rifle and started in pursuit, closely followed by myself. When we gained the tree where the outlaw ha'd built his hut, we were enabled to command an uninterrupted view of the island as far as the water's edge, and within thirty rods of the lake we saw the form of the robber running with extraordinary speed directly towards the water. The hounds were close to him, however, and every mo- ment we expected to see old Maje make a spring and bear the native to the earth, and hold him until our arrival. But in this we were disappointed, for Juan was as nimble as a deer, and every bound that he made took him clear of bushes and rank grass as completely as though he was flying through the air. We could have sent a bullet whizzing after him, and with a tolerable certainty that it would have maimnled him, or else ended his life; but we were so sure that the dogs would overtake him, that we reserved our fire, and watched the race in breathless suspense. The outlaw was within a rod of the water, and the hounds, instead of quickening their pace, subsided into a trot, which was conclusive evidence that they had not forgotten the    60        LIFE IN THE EASt INDIES. lesson taught them a few hours before, during, the encounter with the alligators. "HHeavens! it can't be possible that the fellow is about to throw himself into the lake!" cried Allen; but it seemed as though he was resolved to iisk it as a chance for life, for Juan shaped his course towards the nearest water, and for a while he was hid from ou1r view by a small knoll. We followed in pursuit as fast as possible; but before we had taken, ten steps from the tree we heard a loud splash in the watelr, and then the sad wail of the dogs as they howled a death chorus. "He is in the lake, and will be food for allig;ators," cried Allen, trembling so violently that he could hardly run. (' Why didn't the devilish fool surrender in the first place, and not give us all this trouble." Even while mly friend was speakincg we reached the knoll, which overlooked the lake, and saw the outlaw upon the sulrfce of thle wrater, striking out with vigorous strokes for the main land, whch was near a third of a nmile fioln the island, while the dog"s stood . upon the shore and howled their rage at thus losing their prevy yet did not dare venture in pursuit. For a few mooments we stood in silence, expecting that the ladrone would be seized and dragged beneath the water; but on he rwent .unharmed until Allen tho0ulght that it was time to bring lim to, and for this purpose mild mezasureos were resorted to. "Ho, Juan!" he shouted; " return to the land, and surrender like a mail." "Never," answered the outlaw, looking back and shaking his clinched hand in defiance. '"Juan can die like a man, but he will not surrender to end his days in a Spanish prison, or work like a dog in the-chain gang." ;, Your death is certain unless you return. T!he lake is full of alligators, more ferocious than the Spaniards or your midnigliht ladrones."  "I make a bold venture for my life," returned Juan, "' and, if I escape, will leave this part of the country forever. If I die I will curse you with my  last breath, for none but Americanos would have dared pursue me to this spot." The outlaw waved his hand in token of adieu, and then turned and recommenced swimming vigorously.   - i A J. TERRIBLE SWIM. '.Can it be possible that the alligators will let that man pass through their dominions unmnolested?"Allen asked, and it seemed possible, for the outlaw continued on his way uninjured; and more than once my friend glanced at his rifle as though undecided whether -he should test its efficacy or let the ladrone escape. "The rogue deserves to get clear for his boldness; but- if he does, the old factory will have to suffer in retaliation for' this visit. I hardly think it would ;be right, considering the tramp that we have had, to return home without accomplishing some good. See 1iow the scamp swims, and glances over his shoulder as though he expected a bullet every moment;; and faith, 'tis a pity to disappoint him." Allen raised his rifle slowly, and was about to fire when I struck up the weapon and pointed to the water. Two black heads were observed within a rod of Juan, motion less, as though uncer- tain from whence the' sounds they heard proceeded. The outlaw saw the alligators, forle .chanrged -his co urse and swam away from them, and I noticed that lie glanced frequently towards the motionless snouts, as though to be certain that they did not pur- sue him.. Suddenly four. othei' heads were-seen directly in fiont of the follow, and once more he altered his course to avoid them; but hardly had he done so, when the lake seemed alive with alli- gators, all heading towafrds the swimmer, who no longer strove to reach the land, but seemed to become bewildered at his situation, and swam around in ciicles which grew more contracted every moment. The monsters did not seem in a hurry for their prey, but actually sported with the man, for three or four times we saw him raised from the'water as though one of the alligators had poked him with its nose for the purpose of provoking a fight; and then the hugce animals would lash their tails upon the surface of the water as though applauding the performance, like a party of gentlemen at a French, opera. All o:f our fierce animosity vanished as'we witnessed the condition of the outlaw, and we would have given a reasonable sum of money if we could have had the power to save him unharmed. Once we started towards our raft; but the idea was aband oned almost as soon as formed, for we thought that before we could propel the structure to 'the spot, there would be nothing, left of Juan but a few stains of blood upon the surface of the water. Once the Mestizo seemed to have resolved to sell his life as    62        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. dear as possible, or else cut his way through the scaly circle that encompassed-him, but speedily relinquished the idea, and the long knife which we saw in his hand for a moment was dropped, and he recommenced swimming more violently than ever, but still in a circle, which grew smaller every moment. "Save me, senors!" suddenly shouted Juan, raising his body from the water and waving his arms towards us. "'Save me from this dreadful fate, and the Virgin will reward you." We were powerless, and could only pity the man and hope that death would speedily end his troubles; for if we had fired, and even wounded the alligators which were upon the surface of the water, there were, no doubt, dozens in the lake re-ady to rush in for a share of the feast, and fight until they obtained it. The strokes ofthe swimmer grew weaker and weaker, as though his strength was nearly exhausted, and still that circle of black heads continued to press towards him, and they were almost within two yards of their prey, when we were surprised to observe a movement that looked as though the monsters had altered their minds, and were disposed to let the outlaw escape; for the circle was broken, and we saw many heads disappear, and others sheer off to a con- venient distance, and wait as- though for further orders. From this the outlaw gained courage, and struck out for the land as rapidly as possible; and I really hoped that he was destined to escape; but before the, unfortunate had swam a rod, a monster head was thrust out of the lake, and after a short survey of the swimmer disappeared.  'Tis the same one that you lanced,- I said, turning to Allen, who nodded; for he was too much occupied in watching affairs upon the lake to speak. Hardly had I spoken before the outlaw suddenly sprang half his length from the water, uttered a yell so shrill that it could have been heard at Santa Mesa, and then disappeared from the surface of the lake.  That's the last of him," muttered Allen, drawing a long breath, as though a weighty matter was removed from his mind;, and although we watched the spot where the Mestizo had disap- peared for nearly half an hour, we never saw him again. The surface of the lake remained smooth, as though. never aoitated by storms or living monsters. All seemed calm and quiet, and from   THE: LADRONEdS HUT.' the main land we could hear a colony of monkeys quarrel and make love much after the fashion of the human family. We slowly retraced our steps to the hut from whence the out- law had escaped, and found that he had been well provided with coolking utensils, and food enough to last him several weeks; for there were three or four goats confined in a pen, besides quite a number of fowls, which he had undoubtedly raised to use in case there was danger in seeking for food at the villages. After a brief survey of the grounds, we cut some poles and made a ladder, so that we could ascend the tree and reach the hut. This we ac- complished after a little labor, and found that Juan was in the habit of getting up inl the sane way, and then drawiag is ladder after lii; for we saw a very good bamboo ladder stowed away amid the branches, and almost concealed flom sight by the thick leaves. ' "T In'the hut we found but little to repay us for our trouble, with the exception of a few pieces of silver plate, stolen from some gentleman's house, and the gun and other weapons, which were used. for nocturnal excursions. These we took as trophies of victory, and then prepared to leave the island, and -hasten back to Santa Mesa, so that we could reach the place before night, and not get caught in the great swamp, and be obliged to consort with wild beasts, and more terrible still, be eaten by mosquitos. Of ammunition we found none - every charge in the powder-horn being exhausted. As we expected to encounter some opposition in crossing the lake, we seized three of the goats and fastened them to the raft, and then coaxed our dogs on, and started for the place from whence we had embarked two hours before. I rather think we should hate crossed without attracting the attention of the denizens of the lake, had not the goats commenced bleating ,as though desirous of provoking their fate. But we were not more than half over, when first one .ugly snout and then another was raised above the water, and after listening for a,'moment disappeared; and the next time we saw them the monsters were swimmi-nog beside our raft, and looking at us most knowingly. We paid no attention to our visitors until they exhibited signs of pressing impatience and hostile symptoms, when we. cut a goat loose, and in despite of its struggles urged it into the water.    !64    LIFE IN THEE EAST- INDIES. The poor animal swamn after us for a few moments, while th alli ators were tamperinO with it, and we improved our opportu 2nity to urgTe the raft through the water as faist as possible. Sud denly we heard a pair of jaws crash together, and I alanccd ove my shoulder and saw thlat the witter;a few yards astern of us wa all of a foam. and that the goat had clisappealred. For a few minutes we were clear of the monsters; but wher five rods from the shore, they reappeared, more ferocious ane more numelrous than ever. "Over with them! shouted Allen, and over the goats went. There was a rush and a-struggle, and the water boiled up as though there was a whirlpool in the lake, and before it had cleared awzay, our raft, thank God, struck the shore. The dogs bounded to the land with yells of deliAht, and we were none too quiclk in following their example; for the allica- tors, after their meal of goats' flesh, were raveuous for more, arld followed the raft even to the edMe of the water, and thrust their long noses upon it, and grunted their displeasure lwheu thley found that we had escaped. ConsPicuous for his felrocity was the huge monster who had commenced the attack upon Juan, and the same  one that Alien had wounded with his knife while we were making the best of our way to the island. Tdle rtce  of the old fellow, when le found that the raft was deserted, was so intense, that he snapped at his brethren when- ever they venturel near himn, and once or twice I saw that he left marks of his teeth upon the tails and fins of his less fortunate companions, and then, to complete his work, gave the rat a gentle brash with his powerful tail, that broke the sticrs and poles into a thousand pieces, and sent them flying in all direc- tons, both on shore and   on, the lake, whle the mud was showered upon us in torrents, and for a Moment we were blinded by the spray. As   soon as we could clear our eyes, we saw the huge brute IYi*g upon the surface of the water, looking at us with lis twin- kiling eyes; and thley said, as plain as possible, -- "How do you like tat? There's more of the samle sgrt left if you would like to try it." "Did you ever witness such a display of cussed impuence?" muottered Allen, tlo had been engaged in picking a piece of mud out of his left eye, and therefore was not in the most amiable temper just at that time.   ff i/       HOMsEW1,IVARD BOUND.        61 "Why don't you rebule it? ' I asked, laughing at his streakec face. t( Cuss me if I don't,5 he rieplied, snatchng up his rifle, and takiug deliberate aim at the eye which wVas still leering, at us as though in triumph. He fired, and for a moment I thought that there was at eclipse; for the shn was obscured by the sheets of water and mud that were raised by the monster in its struggles, and I'll sorry, to state that we got the mlost of the spray, for we stood near the lake, and directly within full sweep of the alligator's tail, But that was the last splurge that the huge animal ever mna4, for it was his death throe; and when the foam cleared away, I there lay the ugly fellow*upon the top of the water, motionless. aud ten or a dozen little ones were cruising in his immediate vicinity, as though to assure themselves that he was not playing possum for the purpose of getting themn within reach of his pon- derous jaws; and by watcllin we 3.lsaw how in death he was in- suited by those who, in life, had paid him all due deference and honor. WAe shouldered our riifles and left the scene. As we neared the place jwhere we had killed the anaconda, the dogs made a circulitto avoid the spot; but ,as our trail lay past the tree where the dead s;nake was coiled, we went as near to it as possible, and were greeted with a, most unnatural yell; and to our surprise found that the' trees in the immediate vicinity of the anaconlda were covered with monkeys, from the little fellow not nmore than a nlonth old to the venerable old grandfathers with gray heads and wlhite beards. They seemed to be holding a council of war over the fallen foe, and, instead of regarding us with' mistrust and felar, they actually maintained their places 'on the lowest branches of thhe trees, and even when we brushed past them, only made faces of derision, and sho-wed their long, white teeth, and chattered defiance, or perhaps welcome, for they used a language that we- did not understand or care to interpret. At any rate, there was great rojoicing over the destruction of their enemy, and it appeared to us that intelligence of the event had been sent to every tribe in the great swamnp during our absence, and that they had speedily assembled to debate in council what action should be taken, in the premises. After two hours' hard- walking we gained the edge of the swamp, and saw the white walls of San Pedro in the distance, B T     i     66       LIE IN. THE EAST INDIES., the sun shininrg upon the horn windows with all its intensity, as though to melt them to glue, and set the inmnates of the building free; and not until then did we feel that we were safe, on our 'return from the dangerous expedition of hunting an outlaw, or padrone. We found our banco where we had left it, and cast- ing off the painter, quietly paddled down the rivet, exchauninr salutations-'as we drifted along with the crews of cascas wliclh had been a few miles above for the purpose of filling their crafts with fiesh water for the shipping in the bay, or else receivinr our full share of jokes fromn some washelrwoman who was pursuing her calling upon the banks of the river, and beat her clothes upon rocks, as though-they were made of iron. At times we came upon a bevy of young girls, who were tak- ing their afternoon bath, and sported in the water like sea-nymphs, without thinking that they were violating the laws of decency by not using bathing dresses; but had such useful articles been sur- gested, great would have been the astonishment, and greater still the laughter. Numerous were the invitations we received to join them in their gambols in the water, and had we done so, a nice ducking we should have got, unless we were quick enough to keep out of their way, or were swimmers good enough to stand a fair battle, where no mercy would have been shown.  Many fair-shaped limbs were. thrust above the water as we declined the invitations, and many a, laugh from the girls told us that they were making merry at our want of gallantry in thus refusing to gratify their caprices. The scenes were too attractive to be passed hastily, and I am ready to acknowledge that my paddle was lying idle while we gazed at dusky necks and shoulders whic  f glaned above the wlater and  disappeared as quick as meteors in the sky. A bath would have improved our appearance, and been relished keenly; but time was an object just then with us, for we desired to reach the factory before sundown, for the purpose of relieving all anx- iety on our account. But the generous invitations of the Mestiza girls were not wholly rejected, for many times afterwards did Allen and myself steal away from the factory, and sport in the cool water for hours, while dozens of black-haired girls were on everyeside of us, and ready to swim a  race or try their skill, in ducking. And yet we thought less of sin than the thousands who line the shores of    COMPA NY AT THE3 HOUSE*       67 Newport and Cape May, with all the circumspection of dress and sober faces. As we neared the landing-place at Santa Mesa, we saw old Pedro, who had long been in the employ of the factory company, standing upon the banjk of the river, watching for our return; and whether he was glad to see us, or was tired of waiting, is more than I can tell, but a smile of satisfaction was upon his face when he saw us safe, and he welcomed us back with an expressive grunt. "How are things at the factory?"Allen asked, -as soon as he had secured the banco. "Muy bueno, Senors.'" was the answer; "the soldiers have been here, made a few inquiries, and carried off all the dead and injured, and, sworn that every ladrone shall be caught, 'dead or alive, before next feast day." "A threat that they have forgotten before this time," mut- tered Allen, "There are visitors at the house?"' I. suggested, burning to know whether Donna Teresa and her husband had left for the city. "Senor,' replied the fellow, promptly; -' the holy father of the convent of San Pedro heard- of the attack to-day, and he instantly ordered his, banco, to pay a visit of condolence. His banco has retprned up the river, so that I think he will re- main over night."  "No others present?" "The old Spaniard and his wife, senor. The old gentleman felt grieved to think that you should have hunted without his company, and he swore that he would stop until he had shot a deer, it he remained a week/'  "'That is good news - is it not?"Allen asked, in Eng- lish, handing the rifles on shore, and smiling most mali- ciously. I made no reply, for .[ felt too pleased at the information to feel angry with my worst enemy, just at that moment. But I glanced at my soiled hands and clothes, and thought how shock- ing it would be to meet the lady until a change of dress had re- stored me to my usual condition of dleanlinesor. As Allen started towards the house, I stopped him. ' "We look none too clean to mingle with company. ,Let us   "FE IN THE EAST INDIES.  send Pedro for a change of garments, and while he is gone, have a swim."             .  Allen cared but little for his appearance after a hard day's hunt, and I knew it; but I succeeded at length in convincing him that the company at the factory would look upon the change in the light of a compliment; so Pedro was despatched for clean linen, and brushes and combs, while we washed from our persons the accumulations of the Great Swamp; and never did the water seem more refreshing to our tired limbs than after that hard day's work in hunting the outlaw. And then how different I felt when dressed in a white linen shirt, with thin shoes and white stockings, and hair arranged in the most telling style, and. which was intended to tear Donna Teresa's heart to atoms, and not leave one little piece that she could call her own or her husband's. Lamps were lighted in the dining-room as we walked towards the house, for we had squandered much time at the edge of the river; and as soon as we reached the court-yard we heard a hearty laugh, which seemed to shake the very' walls of the build- ing. It was something between a- growl and a roar, as though the utterer was endeavoring to restrain his animal spirits while relating his jokes, but finding it impossible, was obliged to yield to the pressure, and give his voice'full vent, or take the chances of strangling.  "That," said Allen, in reply to a glance, " is the holy father, Benventurowho can sing or pray, feast or play, as well as the most zealous in the land. He is loved by the natives, and feared, at the same time; for the holy father, in spite of seeming indif- ference, carries an iron hand, and when it falls, a native goes with it. He is a profound admirer of Americans and America, and if the crown of Spain would appoint him governor general. f the islands, their prosperity would rival that of Cuba in five years. He knows what is required to develop the resources of the country, and if he had position he would put his knowledge to some use. As it is,.he lives a careless, jovial life, without one thought of the future, and entirely indifferent whether he con- forms to all the customs of the church or not." We ascended the steps leading to the second story, and found the holy father seated at a table which was well spread with sub- stantial food, while opposite to him were Sir., Huckford and DVon Arturo.    :BENVENTURIO.         6,9   Gazing from the window, with her back turned to the company, was Donna Teresa; and even when we entered the room she did not turn to greet us, but remained motionless ras though too busy with her thoughts to notice our arrival. "Ah, praise to Bacchus and Venus, theN anderers have re- turned!"' shouted the priest, as he caught sight of us. I have fasted for such a length of time that my stomach is as empty as my wine cellar, and my temper was growing as bad as Father Vidas'; and they do say - although I tell you this in confidence, mind, and it must not go further - that he never speaks a pleas- ant word except on Sundays, and not then, unless two things happen." "And what must happen to bring forth such an expression of! benevolence?"Allen asked, as he shook hands with the jolly-look- ing father, and presented me in due form. "W hy, his fighting cock must win a battle, and a pretty girl confess her sins and her little peccadillos, and promise to reform;- but faith, I have always found them ready to promise, but slow to perform." I glanced towards the swelling form that stood at the window to see what effect such conversation would have upon her; but she remained motionless, and apparently unheeding. The supper, the supper! bring in the supper!" shouted Father Benventuro, slapping the table with his fat hand until the crockery ware danced, and threatened dissolution. "Why, I have not broken my fast since morning, and I feel like a boa that has lived on air for a month. Senor Huckford, I hope your cook has lost none of his skill, and that he knows I am to stop for supper." You shall be satisfied," Mr. Huckford replied, with his melan- choly smile, which was as habitual to his face as though he had a presentiment that he should never see his home again. le touched a bell as he spoke, and the servants entered the apart- ment with steaming coffee, and curry,'and rice, and young chickens, delicately broiled and browned without being burned, while there was game cooked in various ways, and vegetables swimming in fresh butter.  The priest rubbed his hands, and tucked a huge colored hand- kerchief around the neck of his black robe of office, and even the sunken eyes of the old Spaniard lighted up with fire as the fumes of the food assailed his nostrils and provoked his appetite. While   70        LIFE. IN THEE EAST INDIES. the. servants were arranging the dishes I hastily passed to the side of Donna Teresa, and laid my hand lightly upon her ex- quisitely mouldedal-rm, so round, and smooth, and delicate, that it looked like wax-work, encircled'with heavy hoops of gold, some of them studded with diamonds and precious stones, which glit- tered in the light like stars in the heavens, to which her large black eyes were directed. She must have felt my touch; yet she did not move or withdraw her arm from the position in which she held it. "Can I not obtain one word of welcome from Donna Teresa?" I asked; in a low tone. For a moment she suffered her eyes to wander to my face; but when she saw the look of adlniration that I could not restrain, she turned her head, and the rich blood mantled her cheek as she asked,- "What kind of a welcome does Guillermo desire at my hands?" "The welcome of a friend," I replied, still speaking in a low tone. "Friendships are dangerous at times, and lead to unfortunate results. Would it not be better that I should extend to you a sisterly welcome, or one cold and formal like a new acquaint- ance?" she asked, after a moment's thought. "What have I done to deserve this?"I inquired, in surprise; and placed my hand upon hers to enforce attention. She did not repel the liberty, 'but looked grave and stately, as I had seen her when presiding over her husband's dinner table, surrounded by the most distinguished company that the island could prG- duce.. c; You have done nothing that I can condemn, and much that I regard, since our acquaintance commenced, Guillermo," she said slowly and distinctly, as though she was weighing each word, or was uttering them very reluctantly. "I have been alone all day," she continued, " as I told you that I should; and I have thought much of my past life, and endeavored to fancy what the future would be like, and whether it would be as unhappy as the past few years of my existence." "You should be happy," I remarked, " for you Bave youth, beauty, and immense wealth. What more could you desire?" How reproachfully her dark eyes appeared, as she looked at                          .   FJREIENDSHPS.         . 71 my face to see whether I iwas speaking ironically, or from my heart. "4 Wealth!" she repeated, bitterly; " were it, not for my gold and lands I should now be free from all matrimonial control. Would that the earthquakes had destroyed all that I possessed, sooner than a husband." "I thought you married of your own free will and accord," I said. "Then you thought wrong, and 'tis but right that I should un- deceive you."      ,  She glanced towards the table, and saw that the servants were still arra nging thie dishes and removing the wine from the coolers, and that her husband was listening to as story from the holy man. When my father died, four years since," the lady said, " he left me under the care of Don Arturo, his oldest friend, with di- rections in his will that at fifteen I should marry the Don, or enter a convent. In the latter case my wealth was to be divided: one half was to enrich the convent that I entered, and the other' half to belong to Don Arturo. After my father's death I was debarred seeing any one excepting such friends as Don Arturo desig- nated, and those, of course, were loud in praise of his-goodness and amiable qualities, insisting that the woman who was blessed with his hand would have great cause for rejoicing. I little thought that he would adhere to the obligations of the will; but he did, and you see the result before you. For two years I have been his wife, and two long years of woe and misery they have been. Had I been dependent upon the charity of relationb, I could have used my eyes., and exercised my own choice in the selection of a husband; but unfortunately I was not poor - more reason for sorrow."  I pitied her from my heart as she told her griefs, and would have given all the wealth I possessed to have been, able to have comforted her, or to have held her in my arms and called her jwife:; for I could not helD thinking that we were much more suited to each other in age and disposition than Don Arturo and herself. "You now know why I say that friendships are dangerous; and believe me, Guillermo, I weigh every word when I repeat to you that we must in future meet as seldom as possible. It is for your sake that I make the request, for I am young, passionate,  72        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. and easily swayed to good or evil, and may the Vir;gin help me to avoid the latter." She laid her soft hand on mine as she spoke, and I felt my blood bound through my veins as though each drop was a race-horse. It seemed, to me, as I heard her speak, that the earth was less beautiful than before, and that the stars were less bright, and that if I could steal from the room, I would mount a horse and  dash off through the darkness, regardless of dacnger, or where I should finally stop. Yet I knew that she was righlt, and that t to cure imy infatuation, absence from the shrine at which I had worshipped so many montlhs, was the only remedy, and I en- deavored to nerve myself for the contest. "Guillermo," she said, in a low whisper, and with a soft pres- sure of her delicate -hand, "you are not offended with me for speaking thus plainly? I mean for the best." ' May the saints preserve you'," I said, althoulgh I felt. my heart rise in my throat while speaking. "I lave long felt the dangrer of my position, and will now avoid it. The first ship thlat leaves for China carries me as a passenger; but I go with a broken heart." "No, no!" she cried eagerly; " remain in Manila, and let us meet as often as once a week, or even more frequently, There can be no harm in that. We can always see each other in com- pany, and exchange a few words." I shook my head, for I doubted the expediency of such a course. '"Do not answer now," she said, hurriedly; 1" but meet me to- night in the corridor, while the company are flushed with wine, and will not miss your presence. Drink sparingly, and still think of me kindly." As she concluded, the holy father was shouting loudly for his long-expected dinner; and Don Arturo was glancing round the room to find his wife. ' Ho, Senor Guillermo!" shouted the holy father, strikina the table with a bottle of hock -of an excellent brand, a liquor of which the good man was excessively fbond. "Have you turned priest, and are you assuming my preiroative by confessin-g the fair Donna Teresa. By the good St. Veritusi but I shall interfere in the matter."   "The lady's thoughts and petty sins aret still her own," I said,    AT STPPER.          73 advancing to the table, and seating Teresa by her husband's side. "She would not make confession to a heretic; so I was obliged to entertain her with an account of our adventures this day in the great swamp, and they have amused her, and. perhaps excited her pity-" The cloud which I ,saw gathering upon Don Arturo's brow dis- appeared under the strength of my reasoning, or the fumes of the supper table, I could not tell whichl; and to tell the truth, I did not care, for my spirit, from being crushed by the decision of the fair lady, had suddenly assumed a buoyancy at her change of opin- ion that was entirely unusual. We were soon in our places at the table, Allen on my right, and Donna Teresa on my left, while opposite to us were Mr. Huck- ford and the holy father Benventuro, the latter with an appetite like a hunter, and a digestion like an ostrich. His eyes glared like those of a sensualist, as they wandered over the rich viands which loaded the table; and knowing h'is dis- position well, our host was not backwaard in helping hilm first, even to the exclusion of all but-the lady. "The church," said our host, as he sent the servant with a hugeplate, loaded with the best that the table contained, "' must and shall be respected. If the worthy father does not eat heartily, I shall think he is not hungry, or else dislikes our slight enter- taiment." "May the saints forgive you for your groundless suspicions," muttered the priest, seizing his plate, and squaring his shoulders for the contest, like a hunter before taking a daltigerous leap ; and for fifteen minutes he did not speak a word, but used his knifo e and fork with as much skill as the best tactician could desire. "By the way, we have not heard the adventures of the day," the father said, pausing in his exertions, and emptying his wine- glass, and then immediately challenging Donna Teresa to do the same, but the lady was prudent, and merely wet her red lips in the generous liquor; and the priest was too busy with his own affairs to notice that she had not done justice to his pledge. ' Yes, let us hear the adventures of' the day,"' cried the Span- iard; " and remember that I have not forgiven you, yoing gentle- men, for leaving me out of the party. I had a right to expect an invitation after the assistance that I rendered last night." "We had no time to lose," Allen said, " or we should have   74        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. been pleased with your company and valuable aid. We were obliged to take the field before the dew was off the grass, or else forego an important business." "But remember I am not to be put off in that way," cried Don Arturo. "I came here for a hunt, and shall remain here until I have accomplished my object. If my wife does not like that plan, she can return to the city in the morning." I mentally hoped that she would take kindly to the arrange- ment, but was somewhat disappointed when she objected, and hinted that it would be better if both returned to the city as soon as possible, as she feared that some accident would happen if he persisted in his dangerous expeditions. This was sufficient to excite the obstinacy of the Don, for he had been drinking freely, and thought that it was necessary for his reputation that he should show- becoming contempt of all danger. "I tell you, Teresa, that here I remain until I have had my  hunt, and here you remain until you have witnessed my exploits. It is useless to remonstrate, for I am just as firm as a rock on this point."  I bent my eyes on the table, and strove to moderate the transports which I felt at the old man's decision, for I knew that, the holy father was scanning lmy face with his glittering eyes, as though he was endeavoring to read my very thoughts. I remained immovable and impassive under his scrutiny, anud at length I heard him mutter, as he plunged his face in a huge , glass filled with sparkling wine,-- '"Diablo! I must have been mistaken."  "At what?"                         I "In thinking tha this was hock instead of chlampagne," hIe replied ;and then, to change the subject, loudly called for a dee- tailed statement of our adventures, and .while' Allen was relat'  ing them, the good father would frequently interrupt him to pro- pose the health of the hunters, or the health of our host, or the lady, or Don Arturo; but I noticed that the priest was more par- ticular in seeing that my glass was filled to the brim than the rest  of the company. At first I imagined it was owing to a sudden friendship he had contracted for me, and that the holy man wished to cement the bonds thus formed in the juice of the grape; but as I noticed v   A DRINKING BOWL.          75 his continued partiality, I had a slight suspicion that my brain was to be tested, and while in a state of intoxication I was to be sounded injrelation to my feelings for the wife of the old Spaniard.   I  The more I watched his proceedings, the stronger I felt assured that it was the case, and I formed the resolution of letting the good priest see that an American possessed as stout a head as himself, and that in the end he would be ba:ffled in his attempt to extort my secret. I never fancied a drinking bout, and was, usually, extremely ab- stemious, rarely taking liquor unless at a dinner-party, and never then unless forced to do so by the custom of the country. But what was most extraordinary, I possessed a head and brain that were never known to yield to the influence of liquor, and were I so disposed, I could drink for hours, and yet rise from the table, and even the most fastidious lady in the land would never know that wine had passed my lips, unless she camae in close contact with them. Knowing as I did that I could drink the priest under the table, I responded to his toasts, and proposed others, and mixed his iquors until at length I got him to swallow  half a tumbler of French brandy, under the impression that it was wine; and faith, I don't think that he discovered his mistake. I could see the lit- tie gray eyes grow more luminous as the revell proceeded, and to disarm the holy father of all suspicions, I pretended to be nearly oblivious of all that was transpiring around the table. Twice I stole glances at Donna Teresa's face, to see how she was affected by the scene; and each time that I did so I met the full gaze of her large, melancholy eyes, as though reproaching me for my want of discretion. ' Let me   sing you a song, senors," cried the holy father, struggling to his, feet, and insisting that all should join in the chorus. "' But first let me retire," interrupted Donna Teresa, hastily ris- ] ing, with some  alarm, for she probably imagined that the songs sung by an intoxicated man were hardly fit for a modest woman to listen to. I' Go by all means," stammered her husband, who was too far gone to assist the lady or himself. ,   76       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. She bowed coldly to the company, and accepting my arm, was escorted to the door. "I shall not fail you," I whispered. "At twelve I will be on the corridor." I spoke without the least show of intoxication; aid I could see a gleam of joyful surprise pass over her face as she listened. With an inclination of' her proud head, she passed through the open door, and retired to her chamber. '"By all the saints in, the calendar, but she is the fairest lady in Manila," cried the holy father, with enthusiasm; " and I will propose a toast which all must drink, or I'll excommunicate them from this blessed company, and compel them to drink river water for the remainder of their lives. Fill, caballeros, and drink to the health of the fair Donna Teresa and her gallant husband." The priest's eyes were on me as he spoke, and in spite of his seeming intoxication, I could see that he was studying my motions and face to judge how I liked the toast. "I propose an amendment to the sentiment," I cried, just as the company were raising their glasses to their lipS. "Long may they live, and long may they love each other." "I accept the amendment," shouted the father, and with en- thusiasm we drank the toast, and were then bored for fifteen min- utes with a speech from the husband; but what it referred to I have no recollection, for I was thinking of my appointment, and wondering how soon the Don and priest would lie under the table, where I most sincerely wished them. During the confusion, and while the priest was relating a story, our host slipped off to bed, and the servants retired one by one, until we were unattended. But the wine was close at hand, and we could spatre them; and the only consequence of our host's absence was to draw our chairs closer together, and smoke and drink more fierce than ever. ' Did I ever tell you, Senor Allen, how the Mestiza girl played a trick upon the good, -but extremely cross father Vidas?" asked Benventuro, as soon 'as the Don had concluded a story, which every one laughed at, but no one thought funny. "Never; let us hear it without delay." "Fill your glasses, and I'll commence. One day, three months since, the worthy father was told that a young girl desired the   THE. PRIEST'S STORY.        " benefit of confession, but had neglected to bring the usual offering, a present, and the fair penitent was sent home sadly troubled, and uncertain what to do. "I heard of her application, and determined to administer a rebuke to the old tiger for his selfishness. I took occasion to visit the girl, and gave her a. few hints, and the next day she called upon father Vidas, and reiterated her request; and as she did so, she held something in her hand, covered with- a piece of paper. "' Ah, this time you have brought something-have you?' he said; and the girl acknowledged that she had, but took care not to mention what it was. "She made a full confession, and got pard ned for all the sins she had committed, and then my brother held ut his hand for the expected reward. "' I'mn very-poor, holy father,' she said; ' and so are my par- ents, and my lover; Pedro; but I determined to bring you an offering that would please you.' "Vidas rubbed his hands, and expected a peso at least. "' I heard,' the girl continued, ' that last Sunday your favorite game cock was killed in a fight, and that you lost much money on the result. "The good man growled like a tiger as he acknowledged that such was the case. "' Knowing that you- would lament the loss, I took the trouble of getting my lover to cut the spurs from his legs; and here they are, neatly polished.' "' She placed the paper in his hand, and fled from the churchq - and for two days-the good man did not m ak:e his appearance in public, but endeavored, by fasting and prayer, to subdue the feel- ings which were in his heart. But he has not forgotten the circumstance, and even now it is dangerous to mention spurs to him." The story was told with many hickups and expressions not ne- cessary to be repeated here; but when it was concluded, I saw that the priest expected me to laugh; so I did, and thereby won some portion of his esteem. Don Arturo, who had hardly under- stood ten words that were uttered, swore that it was the best thing that he had ever heard, and in endeavoring to get up and shake hands with the narrator, lost his balanle, and fall under the   75  '      LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. table, and by the time that he struck the floor was snoring most unmusically. "See what a sot a man will make of himself!" pathetically muttered the priest. "Wine is a harmless beverage when not taken in immoderate quantities, and I always recommend it to those who can afford to drink it, but not otherwise. The Don's head is weak, and he should be restrained by his friends from over-indulgence."' The good father staggered to his feet, and assisted to raise-the insensible body, and across the room we swayed, the holy father with the thin legs of the Spaniard in his grasp, while Allen and myself held on to an arm apiece; and as each of us was disposed to deposit him in different places in the room, of course there was some pulling and hauling of the unfortunate man, which he never would have submitted to had he been in his sober senses. "' Well," exclaimed the priest, suddenly dropping the legs of the poor Don, and wiping his brow with his fat hand, , if you two are not going to pull one way, I'm going to stop and rest; be- cause the man's joints are small, and will probably yield in the pressure. Now, the question naturally arises, what shall be done with him?" "Carry him to his wife's room," promptly suggested Allen, who had drank more than he should have done; and yet was nearly at sober as myself. "Monstrous proposition!" thundered the holy man, waving his hand at Allen as though it was a war-club. "What! place this imbiber of liquor--this drunken sot -by the side of an angel, and not expect an earthquake to occur? Think you that Venus would submit to be outraged in that style?" "But Venus has nothing to do with the matter, and therefore can't interfere," replied the matter-of-fact Allen. "Don't blaspheme in that manner," cried the holy man. "All insults of such a gross nature to a handsome woman are recorded in the Venus calendar; and sooner than assist to lay him upon a bed with Donna Teresa, I'd throw him out the window. Mind you, only upon compulsion, or with the above proviso." "And sooner than allow such a thing," Allen exclaimed, "I'd drown you in the Pasig, and thus poison the river." "Don't introduce the lady in your brawls," I said; for I felt perfectly indignant that the noble and high-minded woman should   MXING LIQUORS.         79 be thus insulted by a fat priest, and my own particular friend, who was trying to bring him out. At length it was resolved to lay the insensible Don upon a mat- tress, and Allen and the priest left the room for a moment to find one. While they were absent I looked at my watch, and found that it was quarter past eleven o'clock, and I had but three quar- ters of an hour to finish my firiends so that I coulq keep my ap- pointment with Donna Teresa, and have them suspect nothing of what-was going on.- I was in despair, for the priest seemed as though capable of drinking a barrel of wine, and yet retaining his senses; but a sudden thought occurred to me, and I prepared a dose for him that even the most adamantine head would have ac- knowledged and yielded to, I emptied the decanter of brandy into the champagne and hock bottles, and by the time the mat- tress was brought into the room everything was prepared for the experiment. The Don was rolled on his bed and once more we, took our seats at the table. ' Ugh," grunted the hIoly father, filling his glass, which would hold half a pint, with the mixed liquor'; " how thirsty I feel after the fatigue of putting that sot to bed! He is one of that kind of men who cannot drink in moderation and feel satisfied, but must drown his stomach and senses with generous liquor which he knows not how to appreciate. Let us drink to his wife, and wish her a better husband." I watched him narrowly while the glass was at his lips; but he did not appear to notice that his liquor had been tampered with, and I bad the satisfaction of seeing the last (drop disappear down his insatiate throat, and that he re.-filled his goblet as though he rather liked the change.- SThe priest attempted to sing a song, but failed; and thinking that it was owing to his thirst, up went his glass a second time, well freighted with brandy, which had never seen water, and strong sherry; but the second dose was as strong as the first, and in a few minutes I saw his head fall upon his breast; but he raised it again and strove hard to appear unconcerned; but the eyelids were heavy, and refused to remain open, and down with a crash went the holy man's pate upon the table, and such sounds proceeded from his nose that I no longer questioned his insensi- bility. Allen stood the siege a little better; but mhen he saw that his ,   80        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. old friend was entirely used up, he attempted to make a few re- marks upon'the impropriety of drinking to excess; but before he had finished, he forgot what he was talking about, and concluded, just five minutes before twelve, to sink into a quiet slumber, and he did; for which I was thankful, althhough all three snored so loudly that I was fearful they would wake each other. I, left they table and plunged my head into a bowl of cold water, bathed my temples until I felt my pulse reduced to a healthy throb, and then, exting(uishing all the lighlts excepting one, opened the door that led to the corridor, closed it carefully, and after listening for a moment and hearing no sound excepting the outrageous snoring that the Don, the "priest, and Allen were in- dulging in, stole quietly along through the passage-way, turned to the right, passed Donna Teresa's room, and then found myself in the corridor, at one end of which was a grated window, that had remained there from the time the old building was a convent, a hundred years or more. -The only light that penetrated the longr walk was from this single window; so that I was compelled to grope my way along caffefiflly for fear of stumbling over the nu- merous antique settees which were placed in the corridor, more for the purpose of getting them out of the way than for family use. Suddenly my outstretched hands came in contact with some- thing that felt soft and warm; and by the dim starlight I saw be. fore me a vision in white, which I was inclined to fall down and worship. '"Guillermo," said the vision, in the low, sweet tones of D0onna Teresa, 1 how late you are! I feared that something had happened to prevent you from seeing me as you requested." I did not tell her that she had made a slight mistake, and that I was too modest a lover to have ever requested an interview at that hour of the night. However, I managed tp muster courage enough to take her hand, and to plead that the hour was just twelve, and that I was unable to see her before. a "I granted you this interview," Teresa said, making a slight effort to disengage her hand, "' to ask you not to leave Manila at present, and to know if you will feel satisfied with my friendship, cold and distant, but still true." "If you so will it," I answered promptly, for itgtruck me that the lady was acting the coquette on a grand scale, and that she   A LITTLE LOVE, MAKING.        81 should be met as such. I no longer, made an effort to imprison her hand, but kept my distance, cold, but courteous. There was a long silence, and I could see, by the starlight which entered the grated window where we stood, that she was troubled at my indif- ference. ,            l "The hour is late," she said at length. f"I feel tired, and will retire. We shall meet in the morning - shall we not?" This time she extended her hand, and I could see her dark eyes fixed upon my face as though reproaching me for my coldness. I pretended not to notice her glance, but leaned against the window and looked into the garden. I heard her take two or three steps towards her room, and then pause and hesitate, as though uncertain how to act. "Good night, Guillermo," she repeated. "Good night, Teresa," I replied; and again there was a pause. I trembled for fear her haughty spirit would prompt her to leave me, in which tease I should have had. to yield, and made ample protestations that I was not offended. She still remained undecided what to do; but at length, to my intense joy, I felt her hand laid upon my shoulder, and then her head, with its wealth of dark hair, was laid against my breast, and for the. first time I heard Donna Teresa weep. I threw my arms around her and pressed iher close to my heart, which was beating so wildly that it seemed as though it would break; and thus we stood for many minutes, silent and motion- less, for the lady made no attempt to disengage herself from my embrace. "You are angry with me," she said, at length, raising her large black eyes, and looking at me so mournfully that I felt sorry for my conduct. I called Heaven to witness that I was not, and added a few endearing words, which I have now forgotten. "Let us be friends, very dear friends," she said; " but for sake, let us meet hereafter as seldom as-poss;ible." And' for mly sake let us meet a1 s often as we can,'? I replied. She made no reply, but gently unclasped my hands and re- moved her head from my bosom. "Answer me one question," she said at last; and--I could feel her hand placed upon my shoulder to enforce attention. "A dozen if you wish." 6   82        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "Do you love me?" "As I hope for heaven, I do," I replied. "I do not mean such love as most men profess; but a sincere passion, pure and true - for you must recollect that I am bound to a man whom I call husb, d, and that I would suffer death sooner than live with him much longer." nWith my whole heart, Teresai I love you," I replied, after a mloment's pause; "' were you single, and would accept of me as a husband, I would devote my life to your happiness, and cherish you with such passionate love thatch-en your exacting nature could find no cause of complaint." I'Her arms were around my neck again, and no opposition was made to the warm kisses which I showered upon her red lips. "You will not leave Manila," she murmured. ' Not unless you go with me," I replied. "That I would do willingly; but my fortune is so disposed that I cannot convert it into ready money." "I do not ask for your fortune - let your husband enjoy that to his heart's content. I ask for- you, and unless you are -mine at no distant day, life will indeed be a burden." "Better have patience, until I can come to your arms an honored wife," she said, starting back at my energy. "Let us remain as we are for the present, and while we can be friends to the world, we can love in secret." "Do you promise me this?"I asked. She laid her smooth cheek against my bearded face, and her lips met mine in token of assent. "Do you truly love me?"I asked, intoxicated with my happi- ness. "I have loved you from the time I first saw you," was the. reply; and I believed her, and swore an oath that I would be true to her, and love her faithfully until death. "Amen," cried a deep-toned voice at the end of the corridor; and then I heard steps as though some one was making a rapid retreat to the sitting-room. "We are lost!" cried Donna Teresa, clinging closely to me in her terror, thus preventing nmy following in pursuit. "Remain here for a moment," I said, striving to unclasp her arms; but she only beld me the more close in her embrace; so I raised her with my right arm, and ran rapidly through the corridor   ?  e  ' i  /' . ^  "               's 1  ' '   AN INTERV'IEW WITH FATHE-R BE VE-NTURO.

I found that Teresa was nearly insensible with fear; I laid her upon a bed, and hastily whispered that I[ would return in a few minutes, and announce who had dared to listen to our con- versation. Drawing a dagger I stole quietly from the chamber, and then laid my hand tipon the latch which led to the room where we had dined, For a moment I paused to listen, but heard only the deep breathing of those-who had drank so deeply that night at the table, and whom I could hardly suspect of being sober enough' to play the spy, and yet I could think of none others. I pushed open the door and entered, and to my surprise saw half a dozen lamps were burning, and that seated at the table, looking perfectly sober and self-possessed, yet still drinking freely, was the holy father, Benventuro, "Ah, Guillermo," he cried, when he saw me enter, have you returned to help me finish the bottles? . You have acted wise- ly. 'Draw up your chair, and. I will open afresh one." 4' I am in no humor for jesting," I replied., taking my position in front of the priest, and regarding him sternly. "No, I should think not. People seldom jest with a knife like that in their ha uds,' he answered, quite composedly, pointing to the dagger with one hand, and raising his full glass with the other. "I have a few questions which I wish to put to. you," I said? still regarding the holy man sternly; but I could not perceive that he was discomposed in the least. "Are they of a pleasant' nature, or of a theological turn? I prefer the former to-nigh t, for my blood is heated with wine, and my thoughts are all concentrated for the good. of myself and peo- pie. Let the questions be brief and humorous." - '4 Have you left the room within fifteen minutes?"  - ", Yes' *             '   - - He answered promptly, his black eyes fixed upon my face as though he would read whether there was murder in my thoughts. 4 During your absence did you overhear a private conversa- tion?"I demanded, my blood beginning to boil, and my thoughts growing more wicked. I did overhear a conversation between -- " "   84        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. He lowered his voice, and bent over the table,tso that I was just enabled to-hear him whisper the words, - '"Donna Teresa and yourself." I don't know what made me withhold my hand, and prevented me from striking him dead; but by a mnighty effort I was enabled to do so.  '"Your motive in playing the spy?"I demanded, fiercely. "To benefit the lady, you, and myself," he answered, laconi- cally. "Explain." "Take a seat and I will," replied the priest, quite coolly. I complied with the request, for the priest maintained so mys- terious an air, that I deemed it best to hear what excuse he had to offer for intruding upon the privacy of Donna Teresa and myself. ' Go on with your explanation,"! I said. The holy father was about to comply with my request, when a loud snore from Don Arturo attracted his attention. "What I have to say to youl must be klnown to us alone. Help me to remove Allen and the Spaniard to another room. We can accomplish our work carefully, and not awaken them." I assisted the priest to lift the mattresses upon which the men were sleeping, and we deposited them carefully in an adjoining room, closed the door, and again took our seats at the table. "A glass of wine together before I begin," father Benventuro said, holding out a bottle; but I feared treachery; and declined. "As you please - there's the more left for me. Your health and long life," he exclaimed, nodding his head as he drained his glass. "Your explanations," I cried, impatiently. "4 Are these," the priest said, sinking his voice to a whisper, and speaking earnestly. "I suspected this evening, when I saw you and Donna Teresa standing at the window, that love was at the bottom of your friendship; so I resolved to watch you. Don't frown, for I had tio motive but curiosity, and little thought that the subject would ever occupy my attention. I have had some weaknesses in my eventful life, and am not disposed to chide when others are guilty of a little sin. I did observe you, even while I was pretending not to; and the final result was, that I became more and more convinced that the ladywas indifferent to   A CONFERENCE.          85 her huIsband, and loved you with all the warmth and fervor of a Spanish girl. I also saEw that your cold, northern blood had been stirred by the black eyes of Donna' Teresa, and that you, too, was devoted to her. So far so good. I looked upon you as a friend, and was -not disposed to interfere, for a few years since, even I should have rebuked such presumption, had I been engaged in a suit that promised successful results."        ' TWhy do you interferi;e, then?"I demanded. "Patience, and I will let you know," was the soft answer, as the priest refilled his glass. "I did not know certainly how long you had been loving, and whether the pursuit was as profitable as you could wish; but I thought that this; night there would be a meeting between you, and I was the more convinced of the fact when I saw you change the liquors, while I was engaged in looking after Don Arturo's welfare." "You saw me do that?"I starmmered. "To be sure I did, my boy; but I don't complain, because, in the first place, I pretended to drink the mixed liquor, and I think convinced even you that I did; but if you had watched me closely, you would have seen that I bowed amy head upon my breast, and all that my 'mouth containedl was discharged between my cassock and inder-clothes. It was disagreeable, and a great waste of good stuff. But what was I to do? Be outwitted by an American, or suffer the sharp practice, which I learned at a Jesuit college, to fall into disrepute? No, my son; you did well, and deceived Allen into the belief that he was drinking champagne instead of strong brandy; but a priest never leaves a table, if he expects to return, without first noting how fuill his glass is, and its exact position ; and if, during his absence, it has been changed, he drinks no more at that table. You see I am frank with you, my son, because I expects that we shall be good friends hereafter, and serve each other with fidelity and zeal." 's To what does all this tend?"I asked. "-I have not reached that portion of my confession, my- son," replied Benventuro, mildly, refilling his glass, and again -offering to supply me with liquor from the same bottle from which he was drinking; but I feared treachery, and once'more declined. The holy man smiled, and continued his conversation. "I believe that I convinced you I was drunk, as I certainly intended to, and had the satisfaction of seeiang, you make prepara-   86        LIFE IN THE EAST' INDIES. tions for leaving the room, as sober, I believe, as when you entered it last night; and I could not help, as I lay upon the floor watch- ing your movements throughll half-closed eyes, paying you a high compliment for your discretion - for remember, my son, that a lover should never meet his mistress intoxicated, as he is apt to say something which -he would often repent of in his sober mo- ments. Besides, all the pleasures of an interview are lost while the senses are clouded with liquor. I am too old a man not to know the joy which lovers feel after being separated for a few days. "Therefore, I repeat, always abstain from liquor while contemplating a visit to a mistress; and believe me that in this instance you will find the advice of a priest worth re- garding." I could but agree with him; so bowed and suffered the priest to fill my glass, although I was careful to note that the goblet was perfectly clean and dry, and had not been tampered with. '"Now you display sense, and I feel my heart yearn towards you as though I had known you for years," the priest said, rub- bing his hands with an expression of cordiality that I found was infectious, and almost regretted that I had drawn a dagger for the purpose of ending the days of one who seemed so good a friend. 6' Finish your story," I said, putting the dagger in my pocket- an act that the priest paid not the slightest attention to. "All right. Let me fill your glass again. The saints forgive me for drinking as I have to-night; but the liquor is good, and the company pleasant, and I have been sorely tempted to an in- dulgence., It is a sin, and I know it well enouagh; but I don't like to inflict penance upon myself, even if I have to upon others; so that I am fearful I shall never be cured until a he vintages fail. But I see that you are impatient; so we will despatch our busi- ness without unnecessary delay; but first let me ask you a few questions, and I will tell you candidly that much- depends upon your answers.  First, do you really love Donna Teresa? Take time to answer. I don't mean, do you love her because she is Don Arturo's wife, and not your own, for a gallant's love is not as stable as a mountain, or as fiery as a volcano, although to hear him swear one would think so. "Do you love the lady with that disinterested Wove which would   THE SUBJECT IS. IMPORTANT.       87 prompt you to marry her were she amaid or a widow, without wealth?" "You have no right to ask the question," I said, coldly. "I acknowledged that some time since, my son, and must put but one interpretation upon your conduct. Y-iou love the lady be- cause she is another's." "By all the saints that a good Catholic swears by, I love the' lady for herself alone, and would take her to my arms as my wife this very night, were I able to do so." "Spoken like a man," replied the priest, his black eyes flashing with excitement; and his hand trembled as he filled my glass and his own. 'C You love the lady, :and she loves you. That I know, for I overheard her confession to-night, and what I suspected before I am certain of now.- She is worthy of the love of a king, and I am glad that she has found favor with an American sovereign."  "What else do you want?"I asked, somewhat impatiently. "You have a motive in questioning me, and I must exercise the same right. You know that I am a Protestant, and that I can- not marry Donna Teresa, even were she a widodw, without chan- ging my religion." "That is the point to which I wish to bring you," cried the priest, lowerinrg his voice to a whisper, and leaning over the table. As he did so a large wooden cross, which he wore around his neck, struck the dishes and attracted his attention. H Here," -he, exclaimed'; c' swear upon this cross an oath, solemn and impres- sive, that you will marry Donna Teresa in thllree months after she is a widow." "What do you mean?"I asked,.in amazement. '"She is not a widow, and not likely to be one for these ten years. And even if she were, my religion would prove an objection." "You shall remain a Protestant as long as you live, in your heart and feelings, and the lady can do the same in -regard to her Catholicity. I don't think you will make the lady any the less happy on account of religious difference." "You are trifling with me," I said, with some show of anger., "I swear to you that I am not; and I further swear that I mean to act for the happiness of Donna Teresa and yourself, and in such a manner that you will both bless me." I smiled in scorn at the words, and the priest noticed it. ,  88        LIFE IN THE EAST INbIES. "u Listen to me for a moment, and then judge whether I will perform the part which, with your consent, I intend to play. Don Arturo is an old man, nearly seventy years of age, and is troubled with disease of the heart, which is liable to take him to a better world at any moment. This he knows, and has made all due provision for a sudden exit. When he dies, his immense wealth will revert to his widow, for most of it belonged to her father, an excellent man, but a great fool to suppose that his beautiful child could ever find happiness in the arms of a person old enough to be her great-grandfather." "How do you know all tis?"I asked, with more curiosity than I had yet felt. "Through his confessor, Father Juan, of the Sebastian Con- vent. You have seen him, and he has seen you; and let me whisper this in your ear in confidence - he looks not upon you with any degree of favor." "I never exchanged ten words with him in my life, for I like not his looks," I replied, with a vivid remembrance of the suspi- cious glances which I had seen him cast upon me when in the company of Donna Teresa and her husband. ' But. he fears your influence upon the lady in case her husband dies. Another secret let me confide to you - the holy father sus- pects the passion which you cherish, and he is watching with Argus eyes for developments. Even a servant in this house is in his pay to spy your proceedings; so let me again caution you how you act when in the presence of the lady." "' But what benefit can Father Juan expect to derive by inter- posing between us?"I asked. "; Wealth and promotion," was the brief rejoinder; and Father Benventuro filled his glass, and smiled. "Explain your meaning." "Nothing more easy. When Don Arturo dies, the good Father Juan hopes to persuade Donna Teresa to enter the convent of St. Sebastian; and, if she should, her wealth would make the convent the most rich and influential in Manila, and plain Father Juan would be made a bishop for his services in securing so much money to the holy- church." "There is no fear of Donna Teresa's entering a convent," I  said, confidently. "She desires to see the world and enjoy life."  t   A LITTLE PLOTTING.         89 The holy man smiled disdainfully, and even swallowed a full goblet of wine beforee he could compose his reply. "Let me ask if such would be the case, if any accident should happen to you, whom I have reason to believe she loves with all tle devotion of a first love. Suppose., for instance, you should soon follow the old Spaniard, and while her grief was fresh, a proposal was made that she should' enter a convent, and devote her life to religious duties, as the surest way of meeting you hereafter. Think you that she could withstand the pressure that the holy church would make, not to secure her happiness, but the millions she could command?" "But I flatter myself that no accident, as you term it, is about to happen to me," I replied, confidently. The good priest smiled, and drew from his pocket three silver dollars, which he placed upon the table. "With such a paltry sum could I purchase your life, and the most rigid investigation would never lead to my detection, simply because the tool that I should employ would suppose that all chance for future happiness would be lost, should he betray a pillar of the church. Think you that I am. the only priest in Manila, or on the island, who possesses the same power?" Well might I feel startled at so candid a confession; and for a few minutes I could only ruminate upon such a fate as my com- panion had pictured becoming a reality. "Drink, Guillermo, and don't let what I have said prevent you fromrn continuing to love the lady as wrarmly as ever; for upon this holy cross I swear that if you will comply with my demands, and take an oath to that effect, I will shield you from all harm, and never cease to work until you and Donna Teresa are one." "Who would marry a high-born Catholic lady to a Protestant?" I asked. "It is in direct violation of your instructions from the archbishop; and even if the marriage was legal, the priest would be degraded, and perhaps dismissed ftom the church." ' I grant that," replied the holy man, composedly. ' But if you are first married by the American consul, and then by me, or. any other Catholic priest, I would like to see, the court or the;- bishop that would dare to interfere with your happiness." ;' But -how could you shield yourself from the archbishop's wrath?"I asked .  .        -  'i In a very simple manner," the priest said, smiling. "-I b,-,   90        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. lieve that he has some love for me, and he has shown it many times, even if I do like a bottle of wine once in a great while. The archbishop is but human, afteqr all, and if I should appear before him after I had concluded thee ceremony, - which, by the way, should be performed in the presence of your friends, and. a few of the lady's; and even they must not know for what purpose they are assembled, - and should say, My lord, I have married the widow of Don Arturo to a Protestant, because- I think that she will convert him in time to the true faith, and because he generously presented-the church, of which you are the head in this country, with five thousand dollars -" "But you know, and I repeat to you now, that there is no prospect, much as I love Donha Teresa, of my changing my religion,'? I said, firmly. "Even if you do not, is there any necessity of sending a crier around the streets proclaiming that you are a Protestant, and will die in the faith? If you marry the lady, you will consult your own interest and safety by speaking as little of. your religion as possible, and let the opinion gradually gain ground that your wife is converting you. This I shall ask for appearances, for not an assassin in Manila would dare raise his hand against a man whom the holy church hoped to convert. Ask questions of the reverend fathers, and listen in silence to their discourses, and if you must argue, do so with the firm intention of being vanquished. Do but this, and many years of happiness will be your portion." "But I shall have to play the part of a rank hypocrite to do all that," I said. "Does not the merchant dissemble when he desires to dispose of his goods, or the sea captain when he promises good food to his passengers, or even the lover when he swears that he will be faithful to his mistress, yet violates his vows every time that an opportunity occurs. Hypocrisy, my son, is a sin, but the, world. is full of it, and even when we avoid speaking our minds, we are guilty of the crime. Let not so common a thing influence you, for there is not a priest, Roman or Protestant, but will absolve you from the charge." "Now, one question more," I said, fixing my eyes upon the priest; and he met my gaze without flinching. 'How shall I account for the interest that you take in my proposed happi- nless? '    " THE? lROPOSITION.. The priest laughed silently, and helped himself liberally to wine before he replied, - "Through your advancement must I thrive." How so?"    &, "I told you that Father Juan would be made a bishop, if he persuaded Donna Teresa, to enter the convent of Sebastian. I am more liberal than he, and know the wants of a pretty woman- better. I desire that she shall re-marry, and through such. means I expect to be a bishop." I started and gazed long and earnestly at the man to see if he was not joking; but I could see-no trace of humor on his broad countenance. "-You wish to be a bishop?"I inquired. 4"That position I am aiming at, and hope ito gain it in prefer- ence to Father Juan, who is my rival, and hlas been for years. If you but aid me, it is within my grasp, for a vacancy exists and will shortly be filled." ' I possess no influence with the archbishop, or with the pope," I said. "I know that as well as you," replied the holy man, quickly. "I don't require your personal influence, but I do want your money."'  I could only stare at the priest in astonishment, while he con- tinned : - . "I want to make a fair and candid bargain with you, and one that shall be binding. .You say that you love Donna Teresa. I don't doubt it, and I am glad to see that she loves you. Of the latter I am certain, for I have heard of you and the lady long before I had the pleasure of an introduction. You have saved her life. That she will never forget as long as-she lives, for Spanish ladies. are grateful, and sometimes prodigal in the expression of their gratitude. You are young and activ'e, and therefore just the sort of man to please a woman as romantic as. Douna Teresa." "To the point," I said, hastily.  .. " I will, without delay. As I said before, the days of Donu Arturo are numbered," continued the priest, sinking his voice to a whisper, and fixing his glittering eyes upon me as though he was reading my thoughts. '"When he dies, the lady will control one or two million dollars' worth of property) and I need not say   92       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. that is a handsome sum for a man to take with a pretty wife. Now, I propose to help you to both wife and money, provided,of course, you will help me." n',' But how?"'I asked. "That question is easily asked. and easily answered, yet I feel reluctant, to speak out as openly as I could wish," the priest said. I motioned him to go on, and after emptying his glass he did so. "To conciliate the archbishop I must give -him five thousand dollars, and that is not a large amount when you fully understand the danger of marrying a Protestant to a Catholic, and shielding him from harm." ' It is not an unreasonable sum," I remarked. "I supposed that you would say so," the priest said, dryly, and continued; " but hear me through, and then decide.. To obtain the title of bishop, I must have twenty thousand dollars to expend in making presents to influential friends; and to maintain my position in state after I get my promotion, I must have twenty-five thousand dollars more, making in all fifty thousand dollars. Now you have heard my proposition, and know what to make of it."        . "Why did you not say one hundred thousand dollars, instead of fifty?"I inquired. "Simply because I shall get the fifty thousand, and I could not the one hundred thousand," answered the priest, regardless of my sarcasm. "t When you do you will be much older than you are now," I replied; and I was about to rise from the table, when the holy man gently detained me. "Let us drink one glass together, to show our friendship," he' urged. While I hesitated he poured out the wine, and I swallowed it; the next instant I found that I was sitting at the table with feel- ings entirely different from those I possessed two minutes be- fore. I could not account for the change, and I have never been able to since; but I am inclined/to the opinion that the Jesuit was more than a match for the American, and that, for one moment while I was off my guard, a powder was emptied into my wine- glass, which subdued my stubborn nature, and moulded me to the plans of the ambitious priest, so that I could not recede when my senses returned unclouded.   TEIE BARGAIN.          93 c; Remember, I ask no advance of' money until the lady is yours by marriage," the priest said, when he saw that I had emptied my glass;  "I assist you to a fortune of nearly two million dol- lars, and only. ask a trifling percentage. What man in his senses would refuse such an offer? Without my and you get nothing, and will even lose the lady whom you love more than-you do the money." "1 consent," was my reply. "Then lay your hand upon this cross, arnd swear before God and me that in three months safter Donna Teresa is a widow you iwill marry her, and in three more you will convey to me the money which you have promised." I placed my hand upon the cross and swore the required oath, and just as I had concluded, the door was thrown violently 6pen, and before us stood Don Arturo, looking wild and haggard, and gasping as though for breath. CHiAPTERI IV. DON ARTURO'S DREAMS.--A MOMENT S ABSENCE.--AN EXCUR- SION. - A WONDERFUL SPRING. -TFHtE LADRONES. EVEN the holy father was startled at the sudden appearance of the old Spaniard, who we supposed was sleeping off the effect of his debauch; and I could not forbear a shudder at the interrup- tion, when I recollected the unholy compact which I had just entered into regarding the man's wife. It seemed to me as though some supernatural means was connected -with the visit, and that it was intended as a warning for me to desist from further pursuit. The priest was visibly annoyed, and drowned his confusion in liberal draughts of wine; but'I had not the power to do so. "How now, Don Arturo! i" the holy man said, with one of his assumed expressions of jollity. "I thought that you were sleep- ing soundly." . . I have slept," replied the Spaniard, rubbing his eyes and star- ing at me and the priest as though uncertain whether we were   "       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. real flesh and blood, or mere counterfeits; 5 and I have dreamed most unkind dreams." "The subject, man -on what subject?" cried the holy father, with a most cheerful, smile. "I thought- that my wife - " "Your wife," repeated Benventuro, with a laugh; "6 why, may the saints bless me if I didn't think you had dreamed that your fortune was swallowed up by an earthquake, or a typhoon, and that there was no insurance. Go- back to bed after wetting your lips with wine, and dream something more pleasant." The Spaniard shook his head, but he didn't decline the wine, and even took a seat at the table, much to the annoyance of the father, who evidently wished him in some other place just at that- time. "And you, my friend," continued the Don, turning to me and grasping my hand, " were strangely mixed up in my dream. I thought that I was dead, and that before my body was cold you espoused Teresa, and squandered my fortune. I awoke with a fright, and intended to rush to my wife's room to see if it was a reality or indeed a dream, when I mistook the door and entered here. The saints be praised that I did so, for I should have sadly alarmed my wife at this unseasonable hour." 1"Thus do I plit to flight all horrid dreams and unkind suspi- cions," cried the priest, rising in his chair and dashing a few drops of water over the Spaniards head. "Diablo veneer! Give yourself no more uneasiness, my friend, for the saints have you in their keeping." "Then to the saints do I return praise," replied the Don, with a feeling of' relief which was charming to behold. "Guillermo, forgive me, for I spoke without thought." ("Of course he forgives you, for the Americans are not a re- vengeful people," chimed in the priest, with a touch of his foot to mine as' a hint to be as cheerful as possible. "Come, let us drink and forget the cares of yesterday, for we find enough to-day to en- gross our thoughts." Whether the Spaniard was thirsty, or really miserable, I know not; but he drank deeply, and was plied with liquor so skilfully by the priest that in half an hour's time he was no longer cogni- zant of earthly things, even if he was of heavenly ones, and down went his head upon the table, and he againp lept.   A iOMENT'S ABSENCE. '        95 "Go and whisper a few words of love to Donna Teresa," the priest said, in a tone not above his breath, for he was Jesuit enough to suspect that the Spaniard nmigrht be feigning slumber for the purpose of listening to our conversation, and find- ing out whether we were really plotting against his welfare or not. I glanced at the sleeping husband, and declined the command. "I will attend to him if he should stir during your absence," the priest said, with a smile that looked malicious, it was so en- tirely different from his usual jovial one. "Remember," I said, as low and deliberately as I could, ' that there are to be no unfair means resorted to to hasten the apprqach of the events we have spoken of. If I have reason to suspect that my friend is likely to be tampered with, I shall annul our contract and quit the island, even if I should never exchange a word with Donna Teresa again." The priest gazed long and earnestly at me., as though he was satisfying himself that I meant it, and then. he rose from the table and led me to the window, where he continued to speak in whispers. '. I am neither a. poisoner nor an assassin," he said; " and were it not for the purpose of defeating the plans of Father. Juan, I would instantly renounce the cause which I have taken up, and let you lose the great happiness that is in store for you. I sup- posed that you understood me to refer to natural events, and not unnatural ones." "A thousand pardons for my uhijust suspicions," I said, hasti- ly. "I did not so interpret you, and. it was to prevent any mis- understanding that I renewed the conversation." "To prove that I mean honestly by you, and by the Spaniard, I shall give you but five minutes for a few whispered words to the lady. :Now go, and return in that time, or I will no longer aid you."  He spoke like a man who meant what he said, and although I pleaded for an extension of time, it was not granted me. He re- turned to .the table, and again drew the bottles towards him. "I drink a glass of wine a minute," he said, filling his tum- ' bler; " by the time I have drank five, let me see-you return," As he raised his glass to his lips I left the room and entered the lady's apartment, which was lighted by a wax candle that stood -near the Virgin: and her Child, and before which Donna,   .                    .   96        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. Teresa never, failed to perform her devotions upon' retiring to rest. I remained for a moment at the door, and could hear her low, regular breathing, and with a half-muttered prayer for her safety, turned and fled from the room like a coward. I was not base enough to steal the kiss I wanted. "You are within time by two glasses," said Benyenturo, look- ing 'up in astonishment.' "What is the matter?" "She sleeps," I whispered;, " and not to save my soul would I disturb her."         - "Bueno" muttered the father; " if you will be as considerate for three months to come, I shall die a bishop, for no one can withstand such delicacy." "You will forgive me if I retire," I said, after a few minutes' silence. ' I have had a hard day's work, and feel the need of sleep. You know where your room is, and don't need my assist- ance in finding -it. If you can drink more wine, pray do so, for there is an abundance." The priest laughed and excused me, but gave as Pa reason for not retiring just then, that he had a few pious meditations which he desired to indulge in undisturbed, so that he could be ready to assume his high station when called upon. As I passed the lady's chamber, I saw that the key of the door was on the outside. I know not what prompted me, but I turned the key and'then withdrew it from the lock, and slipped it under the door, so that Teresa could find it when she arose at daylight, or when she desired to leave the room. Perhaps I had a faint suspicion that the holy man might seek, during his drunken hal- lucination, an interview with her, and conduct himself in an un- priestly manner, or, at least, explain the infernal compact, which he had bound me to perform by a solemn oath, while I was labor- ing under some strange aberration of mind, produced, x was al- most confident, by a powder or drug, Yet, strange to say, confi- dent as I was that my wine had been tampered with, I could not muster sufficient resolution to repudiate the scheme, and thus lose all chance of obtaining the lady in case her husband should die and leave her free. I had gone too far to recede without great danger to myself and her, and I knew that if I breathed to the holy father my intention of not complying with the obliga- tions I had assumed, my life would not be worth the value of a-   [THE NEXT :IORNING.          97 bag of paddy, for sometimes, in the Eastern world, blows fall heavily, but secretly; and when a Iblow fails, drugs are resorted to with great dexterity'and despatch. My thoughts, as I threw myself upon my bed, in a room where Allen was snoring, were none of the most pleasing, and for many houtrs. I lay tossing to and fro like a stout ship in a heavy sea. At one time: I half resolved to confide all to my friend Alien; but recollected that he would involve himself in the affair as eagerly as though 'I was a brother., and that he would scorn all danger for the sake of extricating me from the position in which I stood; so I concluded to keep him in ignorance of the designs of the' priest, and let the secret remain in my own breast, even if it consumed me.                 .  ' g  With this resolution I fell asleep, and did not awaken until I heard the factory bell tolling the hour for breakfast; and whenfI looked up, Allen was in the room with a strong cup of tea, which he imagined I needed to quiet my nerves after the night's debauch.       - I How's your head?" my friend asked, while I was endeavor- ing to collect my scattered senses. "The wine was too pure to leave an ache'; but still I feel like a man whose sins are unrepented of," I  replied.  W "Well, drink this tea, and go with nme to the river for A bath; and then '1l warrant you will no longer think of -sin, but, happiness.

"I with you," was my response; and in, a few minutes we' i were bathing in the cool, cliear river. ; When we were gathered around 'the tablie the priest looked as - fresh and as full of life as though lhe had passed the night iu re- ; pose, instead of a wild drinllkiig bout; and even the Spania-rd did ; not dare complain that he felt, languid, for feSir that his wife, who: ' !' graced the board with her presence; looking 'as lovely as a full- , blown rose, should find somnie fault-ait his absence from her charm- ,i her during the night.

X "How are we to pass the day?" demandecld Don Arturo, as he hi leisurely sipped his chocolate; ' shall we hunt or ride?"  "I have arranged the whole of it," interrupted the priest,  hastily; "we will visit St. Marco's Spring, which is about two ! miles from the convent. The waters of which act like magic  upon the system, and even old men are rejuvenated by drinking ! therefrom, while young ones obtain a new lease of life by merely ]i visiting the spot. The sceneryis the handsomest on the island,  and is well worthy the attention of lovers of nature."  "But we have no time to make preparations," Allen said. - X "There is no occasion to make them, for I sent word to the X- ef"'ent to have a collation at the spring by noon; and be assured X that it will be there. Thus I propose to repay the kindness, in  some measure, which I have received at your hands." - : "But the heat of the sun will be an objection," suggested 1 Allen.  "There is not fo be found so cool a spot this side of Green- i land," cried the priest. I saw that he was determined to carry his :' point so listened in silence.  "But how is Donna Teresa to go? or do you mean that she  shall pass her time in solitude?" the Spaniard asked.    i  ,' Of course she must go with us, or else our pleasure would be X so mixed with selfishness that we should cease to enjoy it. Yot l will find saddled horses for the party, and a palfrey for the lady, .^ awaiting us; and now let us despatch our breakfast and be off/" :  Donna-Teresa had no objections to the excursion, and her hus"! ii 'band was delighted when he found that we proposed to carry  rifles in hope of meeting with some game during our stay. Thle  old gentleman helped himself to a gun, and talked loudly of his  former exploits, while we were getting ready, and his wife wase dressing ina costume suitable for travelling and horseback  exercise; but when she did appeal, with a charming straw hat,  trimmed to suit her rich complexion, there was a:universal ex,- pression of admiration at her wondrous beauty, and even Allen : condescended to compliment her on her good looks-something- X that he had not done before during our acquaintance.  '    * i   UP THE RIVER.      ,    99 - A large banco was waiting for ns at the factory landing, manned :by four of the convent servants, who received the holy father ;Benventuro with many" expressions of reverence and esteem, and which he repaid with the utmost indifference, " Drive those dogs on shore i " shouted the priest, as soon as he stepped on board and saw two of our best dogs had determined to follow us; " this is no place .for dogs, for we go-on a party of pleasure; besides, I think that one of them looks hydrophobish." This suggestion was sufficient to excite the alarm of Don Arturo and his wife, and the poor brutes, which had: not the slightest idea of. going mad, were ruthlessly driven on shore in spite of my re- monstrances.        <* " Hush !" whispered the priest, while I was endeavoring to overcome his foolish fears; II never do anything without a motive." I looked for anl explanation; but the priest declined to give one, and even avoided speaking with me when I wwhispered and asked what was intended.  We pushed up the stream slowly, and chatted on almost every subject, until we ireached- the bridle path that led to St. Marco's Spring, where we found horses from the convent awaiting us, and one that seemed worthy, to carry even Donna Teresa, witha lady's saddle upon its back, blazing with gilt and ornaments. " The unmarried portion 'of the party must wish   most fervent- ly, and if with sincerity, they will be gratified with a sight of the faces of their future wives? the   holy father said,  while the-party were disembarking.     . Of   course the gentlemen of the ,company; scouted the n otion, but the lady looked thoughtful, as though   she had some confidenCe , All ready, Ie     nor," said Antonio to the   priest.

"You may ride by the side of Donna Teresa, and guide her palfrey's head, for the road is rough in places, and she will need a stout arm. Don't keep close to me, for I have privacy to com- municate." The Spaniard was too inquisitive to object to the programme, and I saw by the expression of Donna Teresa's face, that she liked the arrangement. I lifted her to her saddle, and in a few moments the cavalcade had started. For the first few rods our course was beside the Pasig, and through a deep valley that was filled with orange trees in -their bloom, resembling a field of snow, so white and clean did they look. After crossing the valley, however, we left the river and commenced ascending the small hills which we had often noticed before, and determined to explore for game, but something had prevented. The morning was delicious, for the sun was not high enough to be felt, and the. air that swept over the hills was laden with the perfume of the orange and mango groves, and was almost in- toxicating to the senses. For the first half mile of our journey we were compelled to keep within sight of our companions; but when the bridle path grew more unequal and rugged, Donna Teresa suffered her palfrey to lag behind, and I was too gallant to suffer her to be alone. I checked my horse, and we rode side by side, so near that I could touch her hand when she was careless in guiding her animal. "You did not return to me last night, Guillermo," she said at length; and I knew by her face that she had long been desirous of asking an explanation, but her modesty had prevented her. "I returned," I answered, "but you slept, and I dared not disturb you."  She blushed deeply, and seemed to admire the windings of the river, for she turned her head and was silent for some moments. "You have not told me," she' said at length, " why you were absent so long, and Whether you discovered the person who played the spy upon our movements."  "I was absent longer than Iintended, because interesting topics were discussed-by Father Benventuro and myself, and found that the priest had forgotten his ghostly duties, and had turned eavesdropper." .-  '            ' {  '   .   'A' CONFERENCE., i        101 '"Then we are lost, GiUillermo;" she cried, with- every indica- -tion of alarm, dropping her bridle and clasping my arm, as though she feared a separation. "I trust not," I replied, kissing her hand, and stealing an arm around her slight waist; and although the position was not a comfortable one, it was too tempting to be relinquished readily. , "It was to disclose our secret that the priest sought the inter- view with Don Arturo,' she said. ." Alas! all our happiness will soon be at an end." "May it never end, Teresa," I[ whispered; and as her dark, mournful eyes were raised to mine, I could[ not resist the tempta- tion, but was compelled to kiss her red lips in spite of her faint entreaties to desist.  The horses, as though aware that some rmischief was going on, began prancing and arching their necks, and, confound them, compelled me to relinquish my clasp upon the best proportioned waist to be found in Manila : "Tell me all that passed between you and the priest," she said, as soon as our animals were quiet. "That I cannot do at present, but I will tell you that the holy father smiles upon my suit, and will help me to obtain your hand, if Heaven, in its mercies, should direct that you become a widow within a reasonable length of time." "Do not jest, Guillermo," she said, with a face so sorrowful that I regretted my levity. ' Although I do not love my hus- band, yet should I weep bitterly at his death; and I think you would love me none the less for doing so.".   ^4 Heaven knows that I love you, Teresa, and I think that you are well aware of the fact; but if I thought that you were heart-' ; less and merciless, I should avoid you as though death lay in my path. I desire your hand as an honorable nm:an, and will use only - honorable means to secure it," She pressed my arm in token of her acknowledgment of the a' ': course which I had taken, and then I related the long conversation I ;-, which I had had with the priest, and the designs of Father Juan i to force her entrance to a convent for the sake of her fortune,. 1ie : I did not think it was prudent to mention the amount of money 'i that I had bound myself to pay for the- sake of obtaining her : hand, for I reasoned that, as a general thing, women kno-w ut little about business, and I calculated that perhaps :she would   102       LIFE IN 'TaE EAST INDIES. think she was valued too highly, and so object to the transaction, although 'I was resolved, that if ever she became my. wife, I would sacrifice my interest in the' commercial house of which I was a member, and, with my private funds, make. up the amount claimed by the priest, -so that her fortune should not be en- croached upon. "Tell me, Guillermoj why the Father Benventuro is so inter- ested in our love?"Teresa asked, at length. "Simply to defeat the designs of Father Juan, and prevent him from reaching the rank of bishop by means of your fortune.!" "If- they think to induce me to enter a convent, they know not how Imuch they are mistaken," she said, with one of her resolute expressions, which I seldom saw upon her fair face; but before T had time to further allude to- the subject, we came upon the rest of our company, who were reclining beneath the shade of mango trees, smoking cheroots, while Antonio and the other servants were spreading a collation upon the rich grass. a Well, you, have loitered by the way, or else- strayed from the- path, for we have been here for half an hour," Allen said, as we appeared in the vicinity of the spring. "Ah, I feared that palfrey would give you trouble," interrupted the priest, before I had an opportunity to speak. "The beast resolutely persists in refusing to travel in this direction, although no objection is made in returning home. You now know, Don Arturo, why I placed a stout arm at your wife's bridle rein." The Spaniard, I thought, did not appear as profoundly grateful as I could wish unuder the circumstances; but he did find voice to ' mutter a few words of thanks for my gallantry in confining my- self to his wife, and even advanced to assist her from the saddle; but in this I was before him, for I doubted if he was strong. enough to sustain her stately form. ' I must change the palfrey, -or else sell her, for she is restless with ladies," the priest said, patting the sleek sides of the brute, and speaking so that Don Arturo could hear him; and I think that the holy father at length lulled all suspicions that our loitet- ing by the way was one of design. ' The collation is ready, senori" cried Antonio; and the priest rubbed his hands with satisfaction at the news. We repaired to the spot where were spread; cold chicken, sand- wiches, tongue, jelliesi game, pies', and several kinds 'of- fruit,-   THE SPRING,           10 while for liquors we had an excellent brandc of champagne, cooled in the icy water of the! spring.; and I noticed that Antonio, with a full knowledge of his master's weakness, had- provided .an abun- dant supply of the generous wine/- more, in fact, than I thought becoming for the character of the party. Benventuro played the host to perfection, and saw that-each. one was helped liberally before he would undertake to satisfy his own wants; but when thhe first bottle of champagne was uncorked, his usual flow of animal spirits commenced, and continued until the conversation was confined to the miraculous virtues of the holy  spring, which was within a few rods of us, .and, but for the cold- ness of its waters, presented no great attraction, although the grove in which it was situated was beautiful as fairyland is xep- resented to be. ' "I want all to promise me that; there shall be no looking into t the spring, and repeating prayers to the blessed St. Marco, for J the purpose of obtaining a view of the faces: of expectant wives. Those present who are married, of courses will have no such de- sire, and it is to caution the young folks that I speak." Now, if the priest was really in earnest in his remonstrance, it  was a good plan, to excite our curiosity; and when (J saw that . Donna Teresa looked at; me as though advising that I should test the power of the spring, I declared that I would never leave the: grove until I had seen my future wife's face, provided, of cpprse, the good St. Marco was disposed ito gratify me., AlIen also. in-.. sisted that his rights werle inviolate, and that he had good reason t to believe that his futur wife was somewhere in the world, and that she was as eager tofisee him as he was her; therefore it was  I but right that an interview should take place, and as, speedily as  possible; "for perhaps," Allen said, "I 'may change- my indi after a fair view of the lady's face, and it is only right that, I should give her warning, so that she can pdet a more congenial mate." I strongly suspect that the priest was desirous that I should test the water, although he pretended /that he wis not; but afterhe ' had drank his second bottle of wine, he gave his consent, and volunteered to do the praying while the rest of us were to take :: i our chances at wife-seeing,. ,     :  Be . ventur led the way to: the spring, foloV:ed by Cthe. comp y,; , all in good spirits, and laughing at the ab tof th test   104  .     LIIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. we proposed to indulge in. It was decided that Alien should have the first look, while I followed as second, and then if Donna Teresa and her husband were curious, they should come last. "I wish to impress upon your minds," the priest said, in a whisper, " there must be no levity connected with this ceremony; if there is, we fail of our object." v "If you had said there must be no intoxication, I should have despaired of seeing my wife this afternoon," Allen muttered; and .even the priest, who was endeavoring to look grim and mysteri- ous, was compelled to smile as he remembered how rapidly the champagne had disappeared but a few minutes before. '4 Senor Allen," the holy father said, "' I'm astonished at your want of reverence, and I fear that the result will not be very flattering to your wishes. But form a circle around me, and join- hands while I repeat the words which must be used to cause the saint to gratify our desires." AWe gravely extended our hands, and I had the satisfaction of once more touching the warm flesh of Donna Teresam; and as long as we stood in that position I did not care how many prayers the- priest made, or whether they were ever answered by the gentle- man to whom they were addressed. "Now, then," said Allen, encouragingly, ' fire away, and put in-some strong licks when you tell him to send me a pretty wife,. and a rich one withal, for a man who marries a young and pretty woman needs the revenue of a gold mine to support her extrava- gance." The priest frowned the scoffer into0, silence, and began to chant, - "The good St. Marco will preserve us and bless us, and grant all our prayers, for we have travelled many miles for the purpose of worshipping at his spring-" "He'll know that's a lie," muttered Allen; " better tell hi'm the truth, and see how he likes it, instead of fiction." "You'd better leave the circle, and applyyour talent to empty- ing the wine bottles," Father Benventuro said, stopping short in. his incantation, and trying to look solemn ; but the effort was a failure. I would do so willingly," answered Allen; " but you emptied the last bottle before you were in a proper condition to chant the, praises of the great St. Marco." ' - ;   :THE VISIONS.         .105' "I Then remain quiet, or not a .drop of wine: shall you have when we visit the convents" was the threat of the priest. "' All right I'm dtumb," said Allen ;f and thus favored, the priest recommenced his prayer, and at its conclusion we were re- quested to take long and earnest gazes at the bottom of the spring, and tell what we saw. :No one desired to be first; for although we all looked upon the matter in the light of a farce, yet there was a little super- stition in our composition, which prompted us to hesitate when the real test of the truth of the priest's predictions was to be. verified. ;  At length Allen broke from the circle, .much to my regret, for ! i:1I was compelled to relinquish thy soft hand of the woman I loved, and vowed he would have the first look, whether St. Marco was 1 willing or not.  He rushed to the well, and for a longy time gazed at the clear  s water, which was fed by innumerable springs, that hardly. dis- turbed the white sand at the bottom; and while we watched him, we saw, to our surprise, a wonderful change Icome over his face, and at length, with an imprecation, he turned away from the quiet ,water, apparently dissatisfied with his vision; for there was a frown upon his brow, andt more color in his face than I had seen for many months. "Did you see anything?" we asked, eagerly; but Allen forced a smile, and turned fromn us without reply. "Your visions were riot pleasant, Senor Allen," Donna Teresa X said, with all a woman's curiosity to know whether the face he saw was fair or otherwise. ; . H - He muttered something that I could not understand, and walked back -to the spot where the collati on was spread, in search of a glass of wine. j "Guillermo, you will bear me in your mind when you look at the water?" whispered Donna Teresa, with a sly touch of her  delicate hand, that thrilled through my body like an electric :shock.     '     '     ',     ' "Do I not always think of you?"I answered. "-Be assured,. that if constant prayers, a andan intense desire to have you ever near me can induce the saint to favor me witit your sweet face, I shall see that or none."  She seemed satisfied, but; I noticed that she watched me with '    Aha , -e ace   106       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. eager eyes while I stopped towards the spring, and I thought that the priest appeared uneasy. "Drink a pint of the water before you look, or the saint will think that you are not sincere!" cried Benventuro, who 'seemed determined that I should go through the most minute form of the cerernony. The task was a hard one, for the spring was strongly impreg- nated with sulphur and other substances, and the waters would have been pronounced mineral by the most impartial critics. "I suppose, if I htad drank the water, I should have had a vision of a different character," Allen said, watching the struggle which I was attempting with considerable interest, and smiling grimly when he saw that I had performed my task; but I don't recollect of having smiled, for the taste of the water was awful. After the last drop had been drained from the goblet, a feeling of supreme happiness took possession of me, and I could only compare it to the effect of simoking a pipe of opium - a feat. which I had been guilty of two -or three times during my resi- dence in Chiua, when I gained the heart of a mandarin by accept- inog of his hospitality and strong tea at the same time, not to mention the various strange compounds of cookery which he had served up in honor of my visit to his home. I felt as though I was light enough to fly, and that the earth was too quiet a place for one with such an excitable temperament as I possessed. - With no feeling of fear, therefore, I looked at the quiet water, and thought that it represented beautiful visions of gardens filled with flowers, rich landscapes studded with waving trees, and then those gave place to pictures of rare art; and at length H- saw one that pleased me more than the rest, and while I watched it the scene changed, and before me were the beautiful features of Donna Teresa, smiling as I had seen her smile but a few nmo- ments before, and apparently inviting me to join her. For only a few seconds did this delightful vision last, and then the -picture vanished, and I saw nothing but the clear water and white sand. "Well, what luck?"I heard a voice inquire; and turning, I saw the priest by my side, with an anxious face. "Where is Donna Teresa?"I asked, forgetting that she was not free, and that her husband was near me. "' The saints be praised, he has seen the right face," muttered the- priest; and then led me a few steps one side, so that the cornm-   THAIE ALARM.          107 pany would not hear may ravings , if I was disposed to indulge: in them. Don Arturo followed us, and seemed as much interested as his wife in my explanations.  "Guillermo, tell me what ou saw," the old Spaniard said, laying his hand upon my shouder in a fatherly manner. "He has seen nothing but a vision of the blessed St. Marc, who will damn you forever, unless you donate a hundred ounces to my convent!" cried the priest, half in jest and half serious. "The holy saint I supposed meddled more with hearts than souls," Don Arturo replied, " and until he makes a personal- re-a quest, I shall decline the petition." The Spaniard, fearful of further importuning, retired pre- cipitately to a distant part of the grove, and seemed to meditate an attack upon the liquors in case he should find any amidst the wreck. "Did you see the face of your love in the spring, Guillermo?" whispered the priest, eagerly. "I know not the trickery that was resorted to," I replied, but I saw the face of Donna Teresa in the water, as plainly as I see it now."  ' Then all is safe," my companion muttere, d; and he threw his: arms wildly about his head, as though he was combating a legion of troublesome hornets.      . A sharp report was heard, -and turning, I saw a small cloud of smoke ascending on our left, and at the same instant I heard-  the peculiar whiz of a musket bullet as it flew through the air, carrying, for some distance, Don Arturo's hat in its progress i" The Spaniard, for a second or two, was as much astonished as- myself, at the suddenness of the attack; and while I was unde- cided what to do, the Don threw his arms up, and yelled, to, the extent of his lungs, -    .             -  "i Murder! assassin! I'm a dead man!" and down upon the ground he fell, and rolled over and over, as :though in theo agony of death'.  "The ladrones!" shouted the priest, with startling energy. "6 Fly for your lives, for the ladrones are upon us." He set the example, and waddled towards the horses as fast as his short, fat legs could carry him, and I must confess that I in- tended to follow his example; but :ught: ight of the. pale,-:   108       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. terrified face of Donna Teresa, who had fallen upon her knees, and was praying to the saints with all the volubility of a Spanish woman, sometimes confounding my name with that of her Shus- band; and I am inclined to think that the saints were requested to preserve me at every risk, and her husband if convenient. I had just caught her in lmy arms, and was about to bear her to the palfrey, when Allen called upon me to stop. '6 The ladrones be cursed!" he shouted; "I don't care for a dozen,of them! 'They will take care to keep beyond the range of our rifles. Come with me and help explore the woods, and find the assassin. The ,priest and the servants will care for the Spaniard." "No, no! ' thundered the priest; " save your lives at every cost, for the woods are filled with ladrones. I have seen a dozen of them already. The only safety is to remain with me and claim the protection of the holy church. Mount the horses and reach the banco witholtdelay." I must confess that I was staggered by this appeal, and that I hardly knew whether to run or to remain; but Allen reas- sured me. "Drop the woman," he said in English, in his usual blunt manner, " and lend me a hand to find out the assassin, or I will go alone. Making love is all very well sometimes, but it is out of place here, as you ought to know." Thus rebuked, I seated the lady upon the ground, and, in spite of her remonstrances, was about to hasten to Alien, when the priest interfered. "You are mad!" he exclaimed. "There is no occasion for your interference here, and I tell you distinctly that I wish you and Donna Teresa to escape without a moment's delay. I will join you at the banco. Do not trouble yourself about anything that has taken place." "But you would not leave her husband here, mortally wound- ed -would you?"I asked, in astonishment. "Even if he dies you have no cause for regret," the priest muttered, sarcastically. I stopped to hear no more. I turned from the lady in spite of her tears, and in a few moments was by the side of Allen, who was examining his rifle. "Ah, I thought you would not desert your old friend at this   ! . THE WOUNDED oMA;.      -- 10O time," he remarked, " although, to be sure, there is ibut little tc fear; for I suppose the assassin aimed at Don Arturo, and meant to have picked him off if possible." - "At any rate he has succeeded in his object," I replied. "Bah! In spite ofll that kicking, the Spaniard is not injured inl,the least, except by fear, although I pledge you my word that the ball was well aimed, for his head was missed by an inch or two only. Did you ever know a woundedl man to make so much noise, or did you ever know me to remain inactive when suffer- ing could be alleviated?" As I couldn't call any such case to mnlind, I wisely held my tongue, and went towards the still prostrate Spaniard for the pur- pose of satisfying myself that he was uninjured, ' Come, Don Arturo, you have made noise enough, and have showed that you care but little' for bullets, or ladrones. - Get up, and take care of your wife until we return.." Allen seconded the appeal with a slight punch in the prostrate man's ribs which caused him to howl with renewed agony; but in spite of his protestations that he could never survive his wounds, and that he should die blessing and forgiving his enemies, we lifted him to his feet, and his astonishment at finding, that he could stand without assistance was great. "I bleed somewhlere internally," he muttered, looking at his limbs and then rubbing his head. "Not a bleed," returned Allen; " you &are as well as ever, and could lick a dozen ladrones, if they would only give you a fair chance. Come, go to your wife, who is half distracted at: your supposed injuries, and requires the constant prayers of the priest to prevent her having fits. We are going in search of the man who attempted your life." "Had I  better go?" timidly inquired the Don. "Not with us," promptly responded Allen. "Your wife needs you more than we."  The Spaniard was only too happy to escape the duty, and while we started towards the spot from whence the shot was fired, the Don hastened in an opposite direction; and when I   glanced towards the priest and wife to watch the meeting, I thought that neither was overpowered with joy to find that -the: aged gentleimana was more frightened than hurt. We   reached the thicket from whence the: shot had been fred   "O       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. at the Spaniard; we saw the tracks of a Mestizo's shoes, and found the very limb upon which the fellow had rested hi's gun -while he took aim, which no doubt he intended should be a fatal one. "It is useless for us to proceed farther," Allen said, after a a careful examination of the footsteps. "' We should not be able to overtake the fellow, and even if wye did, we should hardly dare to execute the law of retaliation upon him, for we could prove nothing, but should excite the utmost indignation of the priest- hood." "Why so?" "Because the fellow is connected with the convent of San Pe- dro ; and think you that Father Benventuro would suffer any harm to happen to his :man of all work, --his tool and confidant,--his friend and companion - the supple Antonio?" "How do you know that the person who fired the gun is An- tonio?"I asked. "For two very good reasbns. First, I noticed that the left shoe which he wore had a peculiar formed patch, and you observe in the clay that-there is a fair impression of the shoe, patch and all. Second, I saw the fellow leave our select' society just after you had made a fool of yourself by looking in the spring, in the hope of seeing-your future wife." "Thank you," I replied. "I believe that I am not far from another fool who was guilty of the same folly." Allen looked confused for a moment, and then laughed; but I thought he was rather forcing the matter. "Well, to .tell the trutl," he said, " there is something won- derful in that confounded spring; and whether the sights thlat can be seen there are the effects of over doses of champagne, or some trick of that priest, I don't pretend to say; but I will admit that I saw something that resembled a face in the water, but what kind of a face it was I don't know." ". Why do you suppose the priest cared what we saw or what we did not?"I asked.  "The holy father is a Jesuit, and may have some aim in view. Things that we would pass without notice he would study over and investigate. By some confounded mechanical trickery, or by a potent drug, mixed with the water which he proposed we should drink before testing the efficacy of the spring, a strong control may have been e-xerted over us,;and we imagined that we saw   AN EXPLANATION.          l things which had no reality. All is a mystery to -me so far; but I shall take an early opportunity of getting;the holy father drunk, and then learning his secrets."    [ 4 A good plan," I replied, dryly, " if it can be carried into effect, of which I have some doubt, for I have felt of his head,    and it is like a cannon ball." I "I own that the task would be a- frightful one, and that I should have to resort to some of his priestly tricks to accomplish the job; but that it can be done I have no doubt.. But after all, we have no cause to be at enmity with the -holy man, for I know that he would do much to assist- either you or me, -and I am certain that I have heard him speak: of you in grateful terms." It was my turn to blush, ,and I managed to do so after an effort. "Then it is useless fobr us to remain here, I suppose," I said, after a few moments' pause. "If Antonio is the man who fired the gun, he is miles from us by this time, and pursuit would: be useless. Besides, he might have discharged the piece accident- ally." Allen shook his head. "There was too much powder in the gun," he said, " or Don Arturo would not now be in the land of the livino." "How do you know that?"I asked.  "You observe that the gun was rested on the limb of thisg tree, and that it must have kicked badly, or it would not have scraped the bark of the limb, and. even knocked Antonio back- wards three or four feet, as you can see by his steps. Depend. upon it, too great a charge of powder saved the Spaniard's life, and he should be thankful to his saints for the accident." : "But what ill feeling can Antonio have treasured against the Don?"I asked.       - "Who knows?"Allen answered, With the energetic shrug 0of a Spaniard. "The Don may have excited his passions. and en- mity by a word or look - he may have refused to lend him a dol- lar some time to bet on a cock-fight!; he may-have declined! to drink a glass of wine with him, or to give him one; or may have - charged him too much 'for a bale ofl cigars for the convent, so that he could. not make a  certain percentage. Either one of these' causes would be sufficient to make him thirst for revenge, and he- will not rest entirely satisfied until le has accomplished it,. We:.:   "2       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. must talk to Benventuro in regard to the matter, and have -this difficulty removed." I thought the affair a most singular one, but I preferred to keep: my thoughts to myself, instead of intrusting them witl Allen, for I feared that, with his .usual independence, he would refer to me as having spoken words which I did not care the priest should find fault with. The more I pondered on the shooting affair, the more mystified I became; and even when we debouched from the bushes, and saw that the holy father, entirely recovered from his alarm respecting ladrones, was seated near the Don and his wife, quietly smoking a cigar, I had no suspicions that he was the origi- nator of the plot, and -that it was through his orders that Antonio had acted as he had done. "Did you find the base assassin?" asked the priest, as we ap, proached; but he spoke as though he knew we had not. "We did not overtake him, but we know the man, and shall mark him hereafter," Allen replied, carelessly. 6 Ah, who dared to attempt murder almost within sight of the convent walls? Give me a description of the man, that I may punish him without delay," father Benventuro exclaimed, with every appearance of passion. "Well, as near as I can calculate," Allen said, with Yankee emphasis and drawl, " the scamp is Antouio, your servant." The priest was too well drilled to manifest surprise, and not a particle of emotion was visible on his fat face as he heard the name. "Did you stop to take a drink of the spring water as you came along?" the priest asked, with a loud laugh. "No. Why?" "Because I didn't believe that any man in his sober senses would make such a charge against one of the most faithful ser- vants that priest was ever blessed with. An hour since I sent him to the convent to make preparations for your visit there. It is time he should return; and faith, here he comes;" and as the holy father ceased speaking, the fellow approached us, his brow covered withl perspiration, and his face flushed with running. "Have you been to the convent?" the priest asled, even with- out looking at him. * Yes, sir,", was the prompt answer. "Are they making preparations for our arrival?" '    SLEEPING AT THE' CONVENIT.      ,13" "I gave your orders and then hurried back, sir." "You have done well," the holy father replied; and then after . a moment's pause he continued: "Our esteemed friend,. Don Arr turo, has been fired at by some lurking ladrone. Do you know anything of the circumstance?" ' Nothing, holy father." The fellow 3was as cooll and self-possessed as the most inveter- ate liar could desire, and lhe told his story so calmly that even I began to doubt whether Allen had not made a miistake. "Let us no lonuer talk upon such a disagreeble topic," the Spaniard exclaimed, speaking for the first time. "See, my wife- is all agitation, because she feared that I was fatally injured when I was simply knocked down by      the mere pl;ximity  fthe bail to my head. It was a narrow escape, but nothing, after 'all, com- -pared to a soldier's danger. However, if you have no objections, Ilshould prefer to leave this spot Mwithout delay, as a second shot might be better aimed."  The priest readily complied with the request, and in a. few min- utes we were mounted on our horses, and on our way towards- the convent, whose, towers we. could just get a glim'pse of, as we left the vicinity of the spring, and wound our way by the bridle path: towards the river. "What say you to supping at the convent;, and sleeping there- to-nighht?" the priest asked, . On one condition I'll consent to that," Allen replied. - "You. may make as many conditions as you please. Nameo the first one."                  , "That but one bottle of wine shall be drank by each of your guests, and that we be allowed to retire at an early hour." "Is that all?" cried the holy father, with a hoarse chuckle; ' bytlhe saints, I thought you were intending to stipulate for a dozen bottles per man, and a tipple until daylight. I accept the first offer with gratitude, for my wine cellar is not overstocked at the present time. Make. your own term., scinors, -for I shall: do the same when I visit you." The conditions were duly accepted, much to nmy delight, for!" had no desire to pass a second night in a drinkinrig bout; and I thought, from the glance which I received friom the dark eyes of  Donna Teresa, that she approved of our course lin that respect; for although much more wine is drank in ,Maiila thaui- water, and O        - , .   "4       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. to be slightly exhilarated is considered no disgrace, yet I found that Spanish ladies, as a general thing, preferred the society of men of temperate habits to those of intemperate, and were rather sorrowful than otherwise when their loving spouses were brought. home in hackney coaches, or on the shoulders of a cartadora. None of us were very lively on our way to the convent, for the attempted assassination of Don Arturo, although not of common occurrence, was far from being an uncommon one, so we did not look upon :the matter in that amicable light in which East In- dians were accustomed to regard such things. "Guillermo," said the Spaniard, " there must be deer in these woods, and it is a pity that hunters like us should remain idle, when our friends suffer for the want of venison. We must hunt, and whiy not to-morrow.?" "Ay," echoed the priest," why not to-morrow?" There was something in the man's voice that attracted my at- tention, and made me think that more was meant than appeared upon the surface; yet the holy man's 'face was calm, and his eyes sincere. "We can start from the convent at an early hour, first sending for the dogs," the Don continued. "An admirable plan," the priest replied, " and one that I should recommend. At what hour do you propose to start?" I thought that I detected the slightest possible sneer on the part of the questsner, and yet I might have been mistaken. "At any hour thlat suits your convenience, holy father," the Spaniard replied, with meek humility. "Then we will settle the preliminaries to-night;" and without another word on the subject, we rode on until the walls of the convent were gained, and the heavy gates were opened to ad- mit us. We filed in, more like a funeral procession than a gay party who had returned from a pleasant picnic,; and when the gates closed, with a crash, it seemed to me as though we were cut off from the i outer world for life. The cheeks of Donna Teresa were blanched,  and I read her thoughts well enough to know that she was far l from feeling pleased with her visit or her quarters. Allen was the only one who seemed indifferent, or treated the priest with the same independence inside of the walls he showed outside; and I : i :   PRISONERS.          115: accounted for it on the ground that he had visited the, convent often, and felt more at home than the rest of us.  L Had we better remain all night, as we- contemplated?" asked the Don, nervously, not relishing the prison-lihke aspect of the place. 'Remain here?" repeated the priest, who had overheard the question;" of course you will, for no one departs from these wals to-night without pay permission. You are my guests, and I have too few not to appreciate my friends, when I once get hold of them. Ho, Pedro!" the holy man shouted to the porter; "let no one out without my consent." The dark, sinister-looking porter nodded his head in token of assent, and forthwith locked the gates and deposited the key in his pocket. "' We seem more like prisoners than friends," whispered the Spaniard in my ear, watching his chance when the priest was not observing him. ' "I hope you don't feel concerned, because It don't; but I will tell you, truly, I had much rather be at home, and surrounded by my servants." The poor, man confessed his alarm, even while endeavoring to convince me that he was unconcerned. I did not reply, but I could not help thinking that there was much design in what the priest was doing, and that perhaps it would have been better if we had not acceptxd his invitations. I- Here, Antonio!" shouted Benventuro; 'a show the lady and gentlemen to the reception-room, and then comne to my study." The servant led us through a narrow passagje-way, and then up a flight of steps, at the end of which we foand the roonindi- cated. The floor was polished with wax, and -contained a: few easy-chairs made of bamboo, a few coarse engravings of saints and sinners, a portrait of the Archbishop of laniula, and another- of- the Governor General. The view' fromi- the windows of: the l apartment was splendid, however, and made us feor a time forget our unpleasant feelings. The room was high enough from the ground to overlook the- walls, and we could'see the River Pasig winding through  rich valleys of rice and sugar-cane, while on our left were the high " mountains, which, tradition -has reported, contain ritch gold mines. and precious stones; yet Spaniards nor Mestizosi dare venture to-, the mines, for fear of the natives who 'inhabit the region, and   "6       LItE IN THE EAST INDIES. who, to this late day, have not acknowledged the sway of Spain; and, strange to say, every expedition that has been dire6ted against them has failed, until the Spaniards have lost heart, and let the savages remain it peaceable possession of their lands. "You look melancholy, Teresa," I said, as we stood at a win- dow, gazing at the landscape. "My looks then reflect my thoughts; for, Guillermo, I feel very sad, and it seems as though some great misfortune was about to happen to me. Were I alone, I should offer up my prayers to the Virgin to keep me fromn harm, and protect all those I -love." "Pray here, Teresa, for your prayer will be answered as readi- ly as though alone and before the image of the Virgin." She shook her head, and seemed, incredulous and somewhat shocked that I should advance such an'opinion. I knew her su- perstitious nature too well to continue the conversation. " wonder if the priest will let us look at the lady inmates of his convent?"Teresa asked after a moment's pause. "H He will answer for himself, for here he is," I replied, as the holy father entered the room, looking as smiling and pleased as though the high office to which he aspired was already in his grasp. "The lady was just asking if you permitted visitors to speak with the nuns," I said, turning to. Benventuro. W' ere she less beautiful I should willingly comply with her request, but if those under my spiritual charge should once see her face, there would no longer be that peace and happiness in the flock which now prevails. Envy would take the place of hu- mility; and there is enough of that without the walls of the con- vent." Donna Teresa turned away, hardly pleased with the compli- ment, yet not knowing how to resent it. "Gentlemen, I suppose, receive the same answer," I said. - "No, not the same; because the nuns study mischief enough already, without having additional temptations thrust before them, which would naturally tend to make them unhappy and discon- tented. Let the nuns converse with a good-looking man three or four times, and there would be a revolt within these walls which low diet and sleepless nights alone could suppress. For these   DINNER AT THE CONV ENT.       117 reasons, my friends, I don't thinks that it is safe for you to visit my chickens." Father Benventuro was perfectly good-natured while thus ex- plaining why visitors were not permitted l;o converse with his great family; so I asked him why the ladies were not affected by his presence. "Me?" he said, with a shrug of his shoulders, ' O I am looked upon in the light of a father, and no one would think of ,making love to me." "Perhaps that is the only position in which they can look upon you," Allen said, in his usual blunt way. The lady colored and looked from the window, while her us band was too much under the influence of fear to notice the joke, and therefore did not understand the meaning of Allen's laughter, loud and hearty as it was. The priest .attempted to look displeased, but when he found that it was thrown away upon my friend, his broad face relaxed, and he suffered a smile' to, mantle his features. "No jokes with the clergy, amigo, on so serious a subject, and especially in the presence of a lady." "' Dinner is on the table, senor," cried Antonio, throwing ppen a door which I had not noticed, and revealing a large, well- furnished room, and a table covered 'with delicacies; and we were hungry enough not to be displeased with the sight.

I have but a poordinner to-day, for I fear that   "8       LIF'E IN THE EAST INDIES. -my cook has lost his skill, or is growing neglectful of his pro- fession." * There was no occasion for the priest to apologize, for there was an abundance on the table, not only of luxuries, but of the substantial things of this life; and rarely had I seen cookery /   carried to such a state of perfection as witnessed on that day. Roast, baked, and boiled followed in rapid succession, and as the wine circulated, the holy father threw off all restraint, and charmed his guests with wit and humor. But this time we were not, permitted to drink to repletion, for the holy father, as though anxious to improve in the estimation of Donna Teresa and her husband, gave the signal to rise from the table just at dusk, and soon after the candles were lighted, in heavy sticks of silver, of old Spanish style, that would have charmed the heart of an antiquarian. We found coffee awaiting us in the drawing-room, and while we sipped the fragrant beverage, the priest chatted on politics and pleasure, arts and the drama, and was familiar with every topic that he broached, and could talk most interestingly upon themes we were unacquainted with. The evening glided off rapidly, and by nine we all expressed surprise, and thought that the hour could not be later than eight. '"I don't wish to hurry you to your couches, my friends," the piest said, "1 but my servants are drilled to exact hours, and in fifteen minutes will retire to their blankets. Remember that they have to be stirring long before daylight." "I suppose that is a hint for us to retlre%"Allen said; i; but it seems to me that you have altered your rules since the time I drank glass for glass with you, and conquered." The priest did not choose to hear, for some reason or other, and left the room -for a few moments. "Guillermo," cried the Spaniard, "I seem lonely in this huge building, and know not why I -feel reluctant to retire. I would give an ounce'of gold if I was in my house in Manila." ' Morning will soon come," I replied, " and by sunrise we can be on our way to the factory, where a warm welcome will be ex- tended to us. There is no reason, as I see, why you should feel thus melancholy." "Do you think, Guillermo, that you could persuade the priest   JUST BEFORE RETIRINGO,       119 to let us return to-night? I should feel so much better at Santa -Iesa, and so would my wife."' "We are not prisoners," I said, u' but guests, and the holy father would think but poorly of us if' we slighted his hospitality by leaving -him as soon as we had concluded dinner. Believe me, I would do all that I could for you, but I dare not offend Benventuro with such a request." a Then you will sleep near me- I want you to promise that," the Spaniard said, hurriedly; but before I could accede to his, extraordinary proposition the priest returned, looking as smiling and amiable as a host should look when he has company that : pleases him. "Before we separate for the night, let us drink one glass of wine to the honor of Spain and its fair women," Benventuro said; and we could not refuse compliance, for at that time there was much ill feeling against Americans on the part of Spaniards, on account of filibustering talk in regard to Cuba. "I have some rare wine, gentlemen, which was sent me by a friend in Spain, and I desire your judgment before retiring. An- tonio, bring the wine here." We had no objections, to test the liquor which the priest so ex- tolled, but it struck me as somewhat singular that we had not seen it upon the dinner .table. The priest clapped his hands, and Antonio arnd a servant, who looked equally as dark and suspicious as the former, entered the room, bearing salvers of solid silver;, together with cut glasses and a bottle of singular shape, covered with cobwebs. ) Serve the guests, Antonio," was, the brief command; yet brief as it was, I thought that I detected a tremor in the priest's voice that was unusual.         " I looked at him, but he encountered my gaze without flinch- ing; and when the servants served me, I took the glass of wine. from- Antoni0os hand without a suspicion that foul play was; in- tended. "Honor to Spain and its fair women," cried the priest, when he saw that we awaited his toast. We repeated the sentiment, and the glasses were emptied. The wine was really excellent, and even Don Arturo commended it, and smacked his thin lips as though he would have no objection to another sip. But he was denied the pleasure, for the servants   120      , LIFE IN- THE EAST INDIES. left the room, but inimediately returned with candles, and awaited to copduct us to our apartments. "Your rooms are near, gentlemen'; a sweet nihllt's sleep, and may the saints have you in their keeping. We breakfast at ten,\ you know; " and with these'words- the holy father escorted us to the door, and bade us good night. A glance, quick as lightninu was exchanged between the priest and Antonio, and I wondered what it meant; but there was no time to ask questions, and I had no desire to excite alarm in the breasts of Don Arturo and his lady, by communicating, suspicions which, after all, might. be groundless. We passed up the broad staircase, the steps of which were waxed and polished-like marble; and near the he ad of the stairs, on a broad corridor, were our rooms, to which our obsequious but grim attendants pointed, and held high the candles, while Allerl and myself entered the apartment allotted to- us. Directly opposite our room was the one which Don Arturo and his wife occupied, and as we bade them good night and dis- missed our attendants, I thought that the face of the old Spaniard looked ghastly in the flickering light, as though he had a presenti- ment that something terrible was to happen. "We must be stirring early, Guillermo," he said, for we must not miss the hunt' on the morrow." He spoke like a person who hoped that no great misfortune was to happen, yet hoped against conviction. We found a cocoa-nut oil lamp burning in our room, with suf- ficient oil to last all night;- for the priest wisely calculated that candles were too expensive for more than show, and that guests could sleep as well with one as the other. I sat down 'upon one of the hard beds, which consisted of a blanket spread over a hide' tacked to rude pieces of timber hewn from a tree by some native carpenter, and lighting a cigar, began to ruminate upon the events of the day. Allen followed my example, and for a few minutes we smoked our weeds ia silence. "s What are you thinking of?" he asked, after a while. ; I am thinking, that if ever I get back to Santa Mesa, I -will never exchange its comfortable quarters for the rooms of a con- ,.', vent," I said.  d    "- Hush!" he replied; " even walls sometimes have ears, and I   oUtR SUSPICIONS.        121 would not have the priest cherish a pr:ejudice against me for a small stock of ready money." Hie lowered his voice to a whisper, and continued, - , I don't like the appearance of affairs heire, and have not all i the afternoon; but I have acted a part, and imposed upon tile priest the idea that I was content. I have stopped here over night on' several occasions, but never saw the ceremony that has been, uI sed this evening, which leads me to suspect that something is about to happen." i "Have you any idea what that somethincg ifs?"I asked. "Not the remotest; but I tell you I shall not sleep to-night, Ior, if I do, it will be only for a moment," Allen said. ' "Do you suspect that any attempt is to be made upon our lives?"I asked.                    , "No, no ; we are safe enough ; never fear; for the priest likes us too -well to think of ill-treating us. Besides, I carry a revolver in my pocket, and Benventuro and his servants know it, and they would rather face the devil than a six-shooteir. 'We are not the ones mischief is aimed at; that you may be assured of." He nodded his head in the direction of the opposite room, and I found that his suspicions coincided with my own. "If Don Arturo is a live man in the morning, he may well return his thanks to the saints, for fthey will have had hiim in their keeping, The priest has an ernmity against the old man, and he is Jesuit enough to strike deep when lhe does strike. In what-manner Don Arturol has offended, I don't kno w; but his death is resolved upon, for I could see it in Antonio's eyes when he lighted us to our rooms. The shot to-day was intended as a finisher, but the fellow put iu too much powder and missed, for which I warrant you he got a comfortable damning." "Can we do nothing to save him?"I asked. W'hat can we do? We are only suspeetinug foul play, and have no proof that it is intended. If we should make a noise, and kick, up a fuss generally, the holy father would find means to repay, us! some way before we were many days older.

For three or four hours we continued to consume cigars until our stock ran low, and then, for the want of something to do', and to restnmy tired form, I lay down, think- ing that under no circumstances I should drop to sleep; but, like all who make the same resolve, I forgot my resolution and slept soundly; how long I didn't know, for I was awakened by feelin'g a hand upon my shoulder; and as I started up I heard Allen whisper,-  (' Don't make the least noise, or you will spoil all - there's some one in the corridor." I was wide awake enough then, and listening with all my power; and while I did so I could hear some person moving in the corridor with stealthy steps, as though fearful of attracting attention. "' What shall we do?"I whispered, in so low a tone that the sounds were almost inaudible. "We can do nothing but watch; but if violence is attempted we can act our part like men." We slipped off our shoes and crawled on our hands and knees to the door, and then :entered on the corridor, where we waited for a long time before we again heard the cat-like itread of solme person, who seemed to have just ascended the broad stairs, and was listening for a repetition of a slight noise that we made. We remained as .quiet as mice, close to the wall, and by the light of a window, at the end of the corridor, we could see two forms, stealing along, treading so softly that not even a board creaked. When they got opposite to our room they stopped, ap- parently surprised at finding the door open, and I could hear them whisper to each other as though asking what it,meant. They seemed to be satisfied that we were sleeping soundly, however, for in a moment they passed to the door of Don Arturo's room, and listened attentively. "I can hear her breathe well enough, but the old man is silent," I heard Antonio whisper to his companion.       \ "Hush!" was the reply of the other person; " don't talk about what you can hear so near to the American's room, or we shall i get a shot from their pistols, and they fire very close, as I kn'ow  for a certainty. If they suspected we were up to any trick, it's i very short our'lives would be." .          .   '  "I think that the old man has gone to a better world, but l'lm  -Ei   IN, TIIE MO:RNING.  1. 23 not sure of it. Had we not better open the door and go in, and be certain about the thing?" "And wake the lady up, and have her screaming for half an hour, and those American diablos grasping our throats? No, no; that would not do." "But we have our knives," Antonio's companion said. "And if we dared to use them upon the holy father's friends, we should be cursed forever. He has a strange love for both men, although they are heretics. Comer let us return and report that all has g6ne as expected." They crept to the staircase and disappeared, and just at that moment we heard the nuns, at the other end of the convent, chanting ar, early mass; and as their voices blended, and the harmony arose, it sounded melancholy enough to be a requiem for the dead. We listened until the chaut ceased, and then stole noiselessly to our room, closed the door, and waited for day- light. We did not have to wait long, for the murky gloom was gradually dispelled by the bright glow in the east; but long before the sun rose, the singing of the birds and the shrill call of' the parrots, as they flew from tree to tree in the gard;en, had tempted us to the window, upon which we leaned, delighted with the cool, fresh atmosphere, and wondered why we were usually sluggards enough to prefer spending the best portion of the day in bed, in- stead of rising and gaining health and appetite, by inhalin, the E fragrance of the morning air, g It is time that Donna Teresa was stirring,' I remarked, listen-  ing for the sound of her footsteps.   "Always thinking of her," Allen said, lighting a cigar, the last :i that he possessed. "Not always," I replied, in a tone that contradicted my denial. "Answer me a question," my friend said, laying his- hand upon my shoulder; ," do you really think; that you could live happily " with Donna Teresa, even. if you should marry her upon the de- cease of her husband? Spanish women are no)t Ilke American or English  dmen. They wither at the age of twerty-five, and that clear, freh skin, which you now admire so ,much, will become rough and full of furrows; the bright eyes will become dim, and the plump form lank and bony; her white teeth will decay,  -and,            .    124       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "For mercy sake, forbear!"I cried, appalled at the picture that he was drawing, and yet, lover-like, believing that Donna Teresa would form an exception to the generality of woman- kind. ', Well, as, you are my friend, I won't be-too hard on you; but you must think of these things, or --" He was interrupted by a shrill scream, which proceeded from Don Arturo's chamber. - I knew the voice, and it stirred my blood like the sound of a trumpet. "Donna Teresa is in distress-!". I cried, starting for the door. "Nonsense," replied Allen; ' she is only scolding her husband. If she was in distress she would hang out a signal." Almost before he had completed the words, there was another shriek,-louder and more shrill than the first. I broke away from Allen, and rushed across the corridor. "Blast it, man, you ain't going into her room -are you?" Allen cried, stopping me before I reached the door. "To be sure I amn I replied, struggling to get away. "But she may not be dressed. Ask her first. Have a little delicacy in the matter." "Don't talk of delicacy, when she is in danger," I replied, breaking away from him. "Well, if you are satisfied, I suppose I must be," I heard Allen say, but I did not stop to reply. I tried the door of her room, and found that it was fastened. I knocked, but no attention was paid to me. I called Donna Teresa by her name, but received no reply. "Curse it, man, she was only dreaming. Come away, and let her sleep," Allen muttered. I made no reply, but I put my shoulder to the door and pressed hard, and the bolt yielded. I rushed into the room, and saw Donua Teresa, partly dressed, bending over her husband, and. sobbing bitterly.    V "For Heaven's sake, what has happened?"I demanded; and two or three times I repeated the question before the lady an- swered. "Ah, Guillermo?' she cried, raising her head, with her long black hair hanging over her shoulders, " the saints must protect "me now."    THE DEATH oF -DoN A'RvCJo. Page x25.

She covered her face with one hand, and pointed to her hus- band with the other. I started back when I saw the face of my old friend, stern, cold, and ten shades whiter than usual. "He is sick," I said, taking his hand, and finding it:'cold as ice. "He is dead," she replied; and a-fresh torrent of tears .burst. from her eyes, and stole through her closed- hands, which covered her face.  "Dead!"I repeated; and Allen echoed the cry. "Alas!

She threw her arms around my neck, and. buried her head on my bosom, and for a moment I heldl her, and, tried to soothe,.her? anguish; but I was too horrified to -offer much consolation, or to speak. But Allen recovered his senses, and spoke some words:; of advice, which aroused me.

Washerwo men, with but a single garment upon their brown bodies, stand deep in the water on the river's banks, and beat their clothes over a rock or log, and shout a joyous melange of blackguardism and filn; and yet some would resent it as an insult, if familiarities were offered. A Spanish- maiden, even if surrounded with wealth, cannot escape the prevailing custom; and hence she grows up, and is taught that modesty does not consist in thinking of evil, and blushing at her thou ghts. While Teresa was dressing herself as well as she could under her agitation, I turned my attention to the Spaniard, and after a brief examnination was satisfied that vitality had fled, probably some hours before his wifb had made the discovery. I can hardly tell what my thoughts were while I gazed at the dead, and recol- lected all the kindness which I had received at his hands. His faults were forgotten, his petty jealousy and braggadocio were banished from my mind; and if I could have restored him to life, I should have done so, despite my love for his beautiful widow, Even while gazing at the closed eyes and swarthy face, I thought of the compact which I had made with the priest hardly twenty- four hours before; and I asked myself, Could he have had a hand in producing the Don's death for the salke of obtaining the im- portant, position which he had determined to reach in spite of obstacles? I knew the man too well to think that it would be of any use to charge him with murder, or to accuse hin of violating the contract, and I also knew the man well enough to know that if I did -iot carry out the whole programme which he had promised I should carry out, that his creatures would be only too happy to Snuff out a heretic, and that no official investigation would ever reveal the cause of my death. Tlhese were some of'the thoughts which passed through my brain, and I asked myself whether it would be better for me to brave his fury, and leave the woman I loved, or to attempt to marry and fly from the island without delay. There were many reasons why the latter course would have been impracticable; and had I attempted to escape, the -whole of the lady's fortune would have been confiscated by the  ,(F'     FATHER JUAN.    :     ,^ 1 27 crown, or eaten up by greedy lawyers. This was something I had -no desire to see realized, because I knew that Teresa had been accustomed to more of the luxuries of lifb than my funds would permit, without a succession of fortunate mercantile specu- lations, which our firm were too cautious to enter upon. While I ruminated I felt a hand laid upon my shoulder, and turning saw the tearful eyes of Teresa.  : He spoke of you, Guillermo, last night, ,after we had retired, and he said that he lovied you as a son. Your name was the last one that he pronounced'. I dried her tears and led her from the chamnber, .and on our way to the reception-room met the priest, his countenance well made. up for the occasion. "May the saints preserve us and have us in their keeping!", he exclaimed, placing his fat hand upon the glossy hair of the lady's head.; '" but this instant have I heard that my friend died -with disease of the heart during the night. I am so shocked thatJ  X have no words to convey to you my anguish., Courage, my poor child, for though you are now alone in the world, I'll be a father to you. I have already sent, for a physician firom Manila, and when he arrives, I wish a thorough examination made as to the cause of his death. I want no suspicion to rest upon the fair fame of my convent." "Why do you think suspicion will rest on it?"I asked.. "Because the world is full of vice and slander; and why should I escape more than others?" he answered, with a, face so full of frankness that Donna Teresa gave him her hand, and received,a blessing in return for her confidence.  "Here comes Father Juan!" cried Allen,l from the bottom of the stairs.  For a moment the priest started, and was inclined to mutter an oath; but he recollected himself, and his face assumed a graveness worthy of the occasion, as he advanced to meet his crafty rival. At the sound of Father. Juan's name, Donna Teresa clung more closely to me, as though desirous of protection from the wiles of this son of the church. "Ah, Guillermo," she said, "I fear ato meet that man, for my heart tells me he has come for no good, and that he will endeavor to separate us. Let me avoid him, for his looks are evil."  , 'You must meet him, Teresa:; Dut be fim, -and refuse allhbis   128       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. offers of assistance, and his machinations will fail. On you will depend our future happiness, and to you I intrust it, with confi- dence that you will suffer no trifling cause to interfere with our welfare. Meet lhim boldly, and receive him as a friend." She pressed my hand in token of assent, and we reached the reception-room just as the door was thrown open to admit Father Juan, whose thin face, keen, restless eyes, spare body, and precise dress, was in striking contrast with the fat, comfortable-lookirgi form of Father Benventuro, who thought more of a good bottle of wine and a good dinner than he did of his outward appearance. "Tihe saints'have all here in their keeping," was the excla- mation of the thin priest, as he stood upon the threshold and waved the sign of the cross with his finger, while his glittering eyes took in the whole party,present at a glance. "May the saints give long life and much happiness to Father Juan, who has deigned to Ihonor my poor place with his presence. A thousand thanks for this visit, and may you relish it so well that hereafter I shall gladden my eyes with a sight of your face once a week." Father Juan bowed low to the compliments of his brother priest, and looked so grave and sedate that I should have sup- posed he believed what he heard, had not I seen by the twinkle of his eyes that he did not. "I am sorry to intrude upon your party, and' should not have done so had I not heard some strange news this morning as I -was about to land at Santa Mesa, in search of my pupil, my friend, my companion, Don Arturo, whose long absence from his house had rendered me somewhat anxious, although I did dot doubt that he was in good company." '"Truer friends a Spaqiard never possessed," cried the holy Benventuro, apparently as candid and honest as man could be. - ' But what strange rumor is this I heard at Santa Mesa? I was told by some servants of the convent, that Don Arturo had died suddenly during the night. It cannot be, for I knew him to be hale and hearty, and likely to bless the church with rich gifts for many years. Let me hear the report contradicted. No, not fioro you," as Benventuro was about to speak; 1" but from the lips of /his wife, whom he loved so dearly, and who is so attached to him that the presence of other men is distasteful. Let her tell ame in joyful tones that the Don is well and happy."   TROUBLE BREWING.         129 The sneer was well aimed; but luckily Donna.. Teresa was un- conscious of it, for she was weeping, with her handkerchief to her eyes. The priest stole across the room, and took the lady's hand and. pressed it more warmly than I thought he was entitled to; but the hand was withdrawn hastily, and I saw by the swelling bosom that anger was taking the place of grief. "Tell me, daughter," the priest said, " is the news true? Is your" beloved husband in the keeping of the saints?" "He is dead," she answered. ' Alas! that all flesh should be mortal. He must have died suddenly, and no doubt it will be' a great consolation to you to know the cause of his death. A most rigid examination shall be made, and the first physicians of Manila will be called upon to decide." "I have already sent for one, brother Juan, and he will prob- ably be here in the course of the forenoon," Benventuro said, with a sweet smile. "One physician is not enough.' As the confessor of the de- ceased, I must assume a little authority in this matter, as I have often talked with him in regard to his last wishes.' We must have five of the best physicians in the city to investigate the case. For your own reputation, for the reputation of your convent, for the reputation of these young men, whose company the deceased has soughit so often, it is necessary that a strict examinationt should be had, so that all suspicion shall be put at rest." Benventuro did not wince in the least. Orv the contrary, he seemed to grow more cheerful as his brother became severe and vindictive. "I shall cheerfully second you in the work, not because my little retreat will be in any danger from unjust suspicions, but simply to satisfy the wife of our friend, whose anguish at the event only equals my own," replied Benventuro. The thin priest bowed, and a peculiar smile passed over his pale face. The smile might betoken doubt--it might mean sat- isfaction. "The lady will readily acknowledge that this is no place for het since she has become a widow," Father Juan said, after a short pause, as mild as he could possibly speak; " and as she has known me for many years, and is aware that I possessed her hus- 9                      X   130       LIFE IN THE EASTi INDIES. band's confidence in an eminent' degree, she will have no hesita- tion to place herself under my care for a while, until her business affairs are settled. This plan is one that met the approbation of , Don Arturo, not many weeks before his sudden death. I Father Benventuro cast a rapid glance at me, which seemed to say, "You see that he is already at work." 'i She could not be under the charge of a better man,"' was his reply. ' I am glad to think that you approve of my course. At the convent of San Sebastian she will not want for attentions and sympathy, and will there meet with friends whose whlole thoughts will be devoted to her interest. The world is full of snares, and one so young and good should not be suffered to encounter thein. Lady, when shall you be ready to accompany me?? I tremnbled for fear that Teresa would suffer herself to be led away by his insidious approaches, but I was mistaken. Slhe with- drew her handkerchief from her eyes, and there were no longer tears to be seen in those flashing orbs, nor was there timidity in her,look as she started to her feet. "If I have remained silent;" she said, '; during your conversa- tion, it is because I paid but little attention to it, and was una- ware of its import. But now I wish you to understand me dis- tinctly -that I am free to do as I please, and shall do so regard- less of church, my husband's last Wishes, or all the priests in existence. I shall not enter your convent. I shall not request your advice and assistance in my business affairs. My lawyer will attend to all concerns of that kind, and when I leave this place my residence in Manila will be open to receive me. Now, sir, let me hear no more of convents, or of priestly interference." , I had never seep her so excited before during my acquaintance, and I little thought that she possessed such a strong will of her own beneath an appearance of' indifference. A smile of triumph mantled the face of Benventuro, but it vanished in an instant.  "Lady," he said, " have you thought well of the course which you propose to take?  Perhaps in the solitary gloom of my brother's convent you would find many attractions that you: know not of." I, have determined, and shall adhere to my plan," she an- swered, full of dignity.   XiiJ i      FATHER JUAN'S RAGE.        131 6' But your husband's wishes," suggested Father Juan, in a voice trembling with rage.  'c Are not binding upon me. I have been secluded from the -world lona enough, and have no desire to enrd my days in a con- vent," Teresa replied. "But we have no desire that you should. We simply ask you to find shelter at our holy house, until your period of mourning has passed away. Then you may depart if you wish." Father Juan could hardly conceal his indignation, it was so great, while speaking. He sawi the prize that he had long angled for about to slip from his hook, and he was impotent to secure it. He cast a vindictive glance at Father Benventuro; but that skilful general was looking upon the polished floor, as though he was entirely indifferent in regard to the matter. (C You have had my answer to your proposition," Teresa replied, with a wave of her jewelled hand. ' If your advice were meant for my good, I'm thankful; but herecafter I shall seek for as- sistance from those who know more of the world and less of saints." The rage of the priest could no longer be restrained. His little eyes,snapped as though emitting sparks of fire, and his pallid face became flushed and white by turns. When he ,looked at me he seemed desirous of annihilating ne in the most summary man- ner; but I appeared entirely indifferent to his rage, and remained on the defensive, still maintaining my position by the side of Don- na Teresa.                        ' "I see how it is- love for a heretic has caused you to forget the memory of your husband, and your duty to the church," Fa- ther Juan said, with ill-concealed rage. "You know the will of his excellency the archbishop, and be assured it shall be enforced to the letter. No Protestant can marry a rich Catholic lady without abjuring hig religion, and giving proof of his' conversion to the true faith. This is the laws and I calltupon Father Benventuro to confirm my assertions." "Father Juan is right. He has quoted the custom of our holy church; but he has forgotten to mention that an indulgence cal be purchased on the payment of a heavy sum, and on the solemn promise of the bridegroom that his wife shall go to confessionals, and exercise her own right in regard to her fortune, and that her children shall- be educated Catholic."    132       LIFE IN TE EST INIE 132       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. The fair face of Teresa flushed as she heard the priests, and. her eyes sparkled with passion. ' Have I fallen so low that I am thus lectured by a man wh( pretends to be devoted, to the memory of my husband, and anx- ious for my welfare? Am I to be told what I shall do and wha I shall not do, simply because I possess wealth in my own right when it is well known that every 3Iestiza girl on the island car marry whom she pleases, if she is fortunate enough to own a peso? By the saints, I should think that I was a school-girl, and you e guardian, to be thus advised. Go, sir, and when I want your advice I will send for you, and not before." She pointed to the door, but Father Juan was not disposed to 'thus give up the contest. His look of rage was dropped, and one of humility assumed; and so quick was the transition, that even I was astonished, and Father Benventuro troubled, for we bothl] knew that kindness was more apt to win with Teresa than harsh- -ness. "If I have said oulght that could wound, I pray that you and the saints may pardon me," cried Father Juan, in a tone so mild, that I should have forgiven him -on the spot if I had not known that he was acting a part, and for very selfish reasons. "Guillerlmo," he continued, 1 I meant no disrespect to you, for I have always loved you like a father, and would gladly welcome you to the true faith, and hope that the time is not far distant when I shall have an-opportunity to do so. But until that time I presume no marriage will unite you with one I love so well as I do Donna Teresa." ' Presume nothing that has reference to myself, sir," I said, speaking for the first time; " you Ihve, this morning, mentioned me in connection with the lady, and hinted at a state of things that neither you nor any other person has a right to allude to. , If I love-the lady, or the lady loves me, it is none of your business, provided, of course, we do not make you the repository of our se- crets, as we certainly shall not." "That's the talk," cried Allen, who had been industriously en- 'gaged in smoking a cigar during the conference, and jerked out his words at the same time that lie jerked his cigar out of the window. "It appears to me that there's a cussed sight more talk than is necessary, and that some of you are counting your chickens before they are hatched, as we say in Mvassachusetts -a state that   A 'COMPROMSE.          133 eis of some importance When the raising of sclhoolmasters and min- isters is taken into consideration.

She is more sted than any one else, and should have her way this time. That's my opinion; you have it for what it is worth; and now I should like some breakfast." It was refreshing to see how quick Father, Benventuro walked across the room and shook hands with Alle', after the latter ad delivered his speech; and it was funny to see Father Juan put the best face that he' could upon the matter, and do the same. I think that your suggestions arethe  best that can be made," said the latter, speaking in a low tone, so that Donna Teresa could not overhear him; ' if she wishes to marry a second time, I certainly shall offer no objections, provided, of course, she makes choice of the mratn ho I think would. make a good hus- 3S band." Father Benventuro looked at me and winked, as much as to say, "Humbug," althoughl he was careful not to let his brother priest see him. "Coffee and chocolate are on the table, cried Antonio, as he threw open the door and surveyed the party with a malicious grin.  "And we are ready for it," cried the jolly-looking ,Benventuro, offering his fat hand to the lady, and leading her towards the door; but just as I was about to follow, Father Juan touched me on the shoulder. "One word, my son," he said, in a tone so significant that I could not help listening to him. "I wish to speak to you' con- fidentially; can I do so?" he asked. "Certainly. Proceed." 'I I wish to be your friend, my son,"' he continued, laying his thin hand upon my shoulder, and studying the expression of my face with his little black, twinkling eyes. "I am glad to hear it, although 1[ was not aware that we had ever been enemies," I replied, wondering what he was driving at, and feeling somewhat anxious, for I saw the face of Father Benven- turo thrust cautiously into the door, two or three times, watching our conference.      '            -   134       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. ', Not exactly enemies, my son; but still, not friends, althougl I have always regarded you as a most promising young man, and I think that if you were a native of Spain, we should feel proud of you." I bowed low at the compliment, and looked for more explicit details. "This sudden death of Don Arturo weighs heavily on my heart. It was very sudden--was it not?" "The poor man did not complain last night when he retired," I answered. ' Ah!"' The holy man said no more for a few seconds, and seemed to be thinking deeply; but I noticed that his black eyes were fixed upon my face as though he was struck by the paleness of my com- plexion. "He has left a widow of surpassing loveliness, and over a mil- lion of dollars' my companion remarked at lelngth. I pretended to be indifferent;- but I was not, for I felt the warm blood rush to my face, and fill the veins as though about to burst them. ' Over a million dollars," repeated the priest, taking a pinch of snuff. "4Don Arturo was fortunate during his long life," I remarked. "He was; but I know a man who can be more so, if he is willing." I looked at the priest for a few moments without speaking. He was indifferent, and took snuff with avidity. "Go on," I said at -length. "I say that I know a man who can be more fortunate, provided my counsels are listened to." "Let me hear them, and then I can best judge what you mean," was my answer, and looking up saw Benventuro standing at the door, holding up a finger as a warning to -me how I un- bpsomed myself. "I will be candid with you, and shall expect the same thing in return. May I be so bold as to require it?" I made no answer, and the priest continued:- "I see that I may, and thank you for your generosity. Let us work together, and- I shall have the happiness of seeing Donna Teresa united to the man she long has loved, and you joined   ! (A SUBTILE PROPOSITION.                135 to a lady for whom you entertain the most profound affection. Don't interrupt me, for I know what I say to be the truth. You are not ambitious, but I am, and to rise I must have your assist- ance. This you will grant me if I help you?" "How?" "I will explain. With the immense amount of money that you have at command after your marriage, you can well afford to spare a portion for the use of the church. I am the church that desires it, and I suppose we can arrange the matter to our mu- tual satisfaction. What say you to my proposition? I will help' you, and you help me." 4"What position -do you desire?"I asked. "A bishopric," was the prompt reply. '"The devil!"I thought; but I did not utter my thoughts aloud ; here are two priests struggling for the same office, and both hope to gain it by my marriage. Shall I temporize and deceive them both, or shall I be faithful to my first proposition?" 4"Your answer?" demanded Father Juan, quite confident that it would be a favorable one. "' I cannot listen to you on that subject, for the hand of Donna Teresa is not to be bought and sold like merchandise. This is not the time to talk of her marriiage, and even if it was, I should have to decline your bargain." '4 Better think twice before you decide," he said, for without me you will never espouse the widow." "Then she will have to remain a widow. I have done as you requested, answered you fairly and candidly, and I hope you are satisfied. Still, as I do not wish your enmity, I will pledge my word to make you a handsome present the very day that unites me to the lady." "I He has been before Gae," I heard the priest mutter through his teeth; but if he was angry he did not manifest it, for he was too good a manager for that. He applied his thumb and forefin- ger to his snuff-box with'renewed vigor, and. seemed refreshed by the fragrance and exhilarating effect of the tobacco. Then he smiled most sweetly, and taking ray arm, led me into the room where the rest of the company were sipping coffee and chocolate, none of them, excepting the priest, noting our absence. Teresa soon left the room, for. our conversation was not inter- esting to her, and she wished to commune writh her. own thoughits    136       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES, regarding her present condition. Father Juan and Benventurc were unusually gracious to each other, but I noticed that the feeling did not extend to their hearts, and that they hated each other as cordially as ever, but uselessly tried to concecal that sentiment, il which line I think Benventuro had the advantage. The latter soon made an excuse for quitting the table,^ltnd as h1 did so he made a sign that he wished a short conversation witl me as soon as possible. Leaving Allen and Father Juan discuss- ing the merits of Spain and her- great men, as represented in the government of 5Manila, I left the table, lighted a cigar, and strolled into the court-yard, keeping out of sight of those who might look from the window and witness the meeting which the priest was earrer to obtain. I had scarcely walked a dozen steps, when I heard Benventuro waddlling after me, his face showing the anxiety which he felt to know the result of Father Juan'E conversation. "Well," he said, " fortune is on our side at last. The coast is clear; now lay siege and be happy." "There is time enouoh for all that," I replied, with an indiffer- ence I did not feel. ' There is not tin  enough," my companion repeated with energy; "a womau's 'heart is like a tinder-box full of tinder. It catches at a spark, and is easily extinguished. The women of my country like to be wooed and won in a hurry, and the more love that you show, and the hotter you press your suit, the quicker they yield. Strike now, while away from all her' friends, and extort from her a full confession, and if possible, au oath, that she will wed you in three months' time, or even sooner." "Delicacy forbids me to do so," I answered, not over pleased at the advice. "To the devil with your delicacy," roared the priest, and then desirous of retrieving his reputation, he went on to say, "We Lhave too much at stake to be over-scrupulous; so let us urge this affair forward, and I'll warrant you will both thank me when united. Be a lover, and an impetuous one, and the lady will not resent it. I am anxious for your happiness." "And your advancement," I suggested. "Diablo! yes; why shouldn't I? We must work together, amigo, or all will fail." "So Father Juan says," I answered.   SUJRROUNDED BY SUITORS.      137 "'May the blessed saints soon call Father Juan to their keep- ing, for he is too good for this world," was the pious ejaculation of the priest; and then he was eager to have me repeat the con- versation which I had held with the priest. I complied with thlle requlest, and Benvenl;uro was furious at the thouglut of his brother priest attempting so mean a snare; and not until I had repeatedly informed him that I had declined his offer, did my friend allow his passion to subside. "We must fight carefully, or that man will spoil our plans," the priest said, and I thought so; but without coming to any definite conclusion, we separated and rejoined the company. In the course of the forenoon a physician arrived from ATa- nila, talked with Father Benventuro, looked at the body of Don Artunl', shrugged his shoulders, and said that it was a "1 visita- tion of Providence," and that the body had better be buried as quickly as possible. Father Juan made no objections, and the corpse was removed to Manila ; and. in a fewy hours Donna Teresa, Allen, and myself followed in a banco, and saw her installed in her house, and surrounded by friends and servants. Eight weeks had passed since the death of Don Arturo, and the period for mourning had expired. Donna Teresa was the toast and admiration of the capital, for she had emerged from her seclusion, thrown aside her habiliments of' woe, and mingled with the galy and most fashionable company in Manila. Her spacious mansion receivdd guests once a week, and every night she was not confined to her house to receive them she was ab- sent at a ball or party, with the single exception of Sunday evenings, when the theatre was opened to the lovers of the drama, and where I was certain to find her surrounded by officers in the Spanish army, government officials, men with titles and little fortune, and men with fortune who would have given half their worldly wealth for titles. , Catholics and Protestants, Chinese and M3alays, Americans and English, all flocked to the theatre on Sunday evenings, for the purpose of gossiping, listening to the military bands which formled the orchestra, talking about trade, and finally laugling at the actors and actresses when too tame, and condemning them when too ranting. Since the. death of Donna Teresa's husband, I had seen her often; but I had forborne to press my visit, or to refer to mar-- riage, simply because I thought that she avoided the subject on   1^38       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. purpose, and I did not wish to give her pain, or to make her think that I was eager to conclude a bargain so advantageous to myself. I sometimes met her at the house of a friend, where we had both been invited to a party; but I never went with her, or accompanied her home, and Donnat Teresa never intimated that she desired me to do so. She went and returned in her car- riage, and was safe in the protection of her servants. Perhaps there was a feeling of coldness growing up between us, and I thought I could perceive it more perceptibly at ever interview. I knew where to trace it as plainly as though I had not seen the thin face and twinkling eyes of Father Juan leav- ing her house with a thoulghtful brow. I was too proud to ask for an explanation, and I think that Teresa labored undelr the dellu- sion that it was my place to follow her froln ball to ball, and be content to pick up her fan or handkerchief, if either should chance to fall while she was dancing with a cavalry officer or a lienten- ant of foot; but if she did entertain such ideas, she found out her mistake, and pouted accordingly. Yet I loved her dearly - better, perhaps, than I had ever loved; and sleeping or waking she wVas ever before mce. But we had not talked of love for many weeks. Our conversation, when we met, was confined to gossip, or an inquiry as to whether such and such a party was pleasant; yet when I mentioned Santa Mesa, and the friends I neglected there, and expressed an intention of seeing them, I could see a look of displeasure upon the face of Teresa, and it would not vanish until I had promised to forego my visit for the present. I had not hunted since the Don's death,; I had neglected all the exciting sports, which had made my residence upon the island so pleasant; and I seldom rode upon  the Calzarda at sunset for fear of having my jealousy excited by seeing the lady surrounded by a crowd of admirers, upon whom she smiled most sweetly, while I, perhaps, received a nod, or a slight wave of her hand. Father Benventuro's letters to me, constantly urging expedition find inquiring why I delayed my marriage, remained unanswered; for I could write no good news, and I did not wish to excite the padre by stating the true - facts of' the case. Thus day after day passed, and the three months were on the wane, and there was no prospect of a wedding., It was Sunday night, and the theatre was open, and receiving,-   ]j I       AT THF, THEATRE.         139 - its crowd of votaries, who were landed at the door in carriages, driven between lines of mounted lancers, stationed there to pre- serve order, and watch. over the safety of ti:e governor general, who always attended the theatre when it was open, for the purpose of encouraginrg the drama, and showing himself to his loyal subjects. I knew l;haat Teresa would be there, and I had resolved all day that I would remain at home and peruse a pile of American newspapers which I had received from the mails the day before; but as the time drew near for the performances to commence, I repented of my resolution, and thought that I could at least have the satisfaction of gazing at my idol from an obscure part of the building, and not let my presence be known. The more I thought of the matter, the more restless I grew, until at length love conquered. "Io, muchacho!"I shouted to my servant, ewho was busily engaged in the hall, painting huge eyes upon a kite which he', was to fly the next day for a wager with a Mestizo, who lived  near us. 'C Si, senor," he answered promptly, bringing a coal of fire upon a plate, supposing that I wanted a light for my cigar. "The carriage, presto . "II shouted; and he vanished in an instant to inform the coachman of my wishes. I must confess that for a lover who intended to look at his mistress from a distance, I was a most particular man in regard to my dress that night, and before I had completed my toilet I heard the carriage rumble from the court-yard, and stop in front of my bachelor quarters. My clotles, not m:ade by the bungling tailors of Manila, fitted me admirably, and I could not help nod- ding my head approvingly, as I surveyed them ma the glass just befolre I started for the theatre. It wanted half an hour of the time the performances were to commence; yet the theatre was already well filled, and the ladies were flirting their fans and chatting gayly in their boxes, criticising the dresses of their neighbors with a freedom only , equalled by the Americans. I glanced at the numerous hand- some faces, but did not see Teresa, and I began to fear that she would not be present;- but while I was hoping most sincerely that She would come, I noticed an unusual stir in the lobby, and then, proud as a duchess, with diamonds upon her nieck and arms, in glided the lady of my thoughts, looking more beautiful than   "O       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. ever, and seeming unconscious of the sensation which she creates She cast her largfe, dark eyes around the, theatre rapidly, an then I thought I saw a shade of disappointment upon her brow but it was not-allowed to rest there long, for half a dozen gentle men. entered the box, and paid their respects to the lady, chatte for a moment, and then retired to give place to others. Yet still I could see that those large black eyes were often ca, over the faces of the audience, .and I felt a little pang of jealousy as I thougiht that she was watching for a rival, whom she love more than myself. At length a dark, heavy-bearded officer, a captain in the army sat by her side, and laughed and talked with considerable free dom. He seemed determined that the audience should under stand that he was on a friendly footing with the lady, and tha she was disposed to feel flattered at his attentions. I had resolved, when I left the house, not to approach her box or to speak to her; but after the officer's assurance I could no longer contain myself, and determined to convince the lady that I could be as indifferent as herself. With as much coolness as I could command, I entered the box, and in an instant every glass and every eye in the house were levelled at me. , Even the officer turned chalf round to see who was to disturb his tete-a-tete, and a scowl passed over his face when he saw me. Teresa did not turn her head, or heed me, until I spoke, and then she started and dropped her fan, which the captain hastened to pick up and restore. "Buenas noches, Donna Teresa," I said, as calmly as though I had been speaking to an ordinary friend. The military man looked as though I was taking great liberties, and cen seemed inclined to stare me into a feeling of defiance.; but I paid no more attention to him than if he had been a servant waiting with refreshments. "Ah, Guillermo! Teresa exclaimed, a slight blush mantling her face; ' I am glad to see you. Are youl well?" She-extended but the tips of her fingers to me, and I was as sparing of my hand as herself, and had no sooner touched her fingers than I let thenm drop as though fearful of codtagion. I saw a slight pout upon her red lips, and then she renewed her conversation with the captain, much to his delight. For only a moment did I listen to it, and then, with a low bow   TOM BAKER.           141 and an unconcerned air, I turned to leave the box; but the demon of jealousy was in my heart, and I almost resolved not to speak to the fair coquette again. "Are you going, Senor Guillermo?" she asked ; and I fancied that there was a slight tremor in her voice, but I might-have been mistaken.                  : "I have a few friends whom I wish to speak with," I replied. "S-all I see you again this evening?" she asked. ,Quien sabe . "I replied, with a smile. "I may remain all the evening, or leave shortly. It will depend upon the interest of the play." I bowed low, and passed out; but when I looked back I saw that she was flirting her fan before her face, tand that she seemed not so much interested in the officer's converscation as before my visit. How I boiled with rage and jealousy, and blamed myself for thinking of the lady at all! but the more I tried to banish her from my mind, the oftener she returned to make me wretched. I went to a distant part of the house, and wished for the perfbrmn- ance to commence, so that I could relieve my thoughts of Teresa's. image. I leaned over a box, with my hand over my eyes; yet even there I was obliged to hear Teresa's name mentioned, for a party of ladies were discussing her mnerits and demerits quite frankly.  At length the overture commenced, and all talking ceased; for the Spanish people love music, and are capabled'of appreciating what they hear. The band played very finely, and then up went the curtain, and the representationrt of a domestic drama com- menced. Before the first act was finished, I tired of the dull plot, and was making my way to the saloon for the purpose of smoking a cigar, when whom should I run against but a young fellow named Tom Baker, who was conected with a house in China, and who had run over to Manila for the purpose of having some fun and recruiting his health. The latter was but a second consideration in comparison with the first; and although he had been in the city but a month) yet he had learned more of what was going on than I had known during my residence.  .  ' By thunder!" was Tom's exclamation, as we shook hands, ( I am glad to see you, for it's devilish dull here to-night. The idea of putting such a play as that on the stage is ridiculous, and the manager should be told so. iWhy don't they take pattern   "2       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. from New York- theatres, and bring out stars and novelties? Horse pieces would be good. Only get up sdmething startling, and put about half a hundred of those black devils, with their muskets, upon the stage to do the supes," pointing to a soldier, who stood near by, totally unconscious, of the complinment, ' and I'll warrant that the piece would take, and run three weeks at least. You don't know the manager - do you?" I replied that I had been introduced to him. "He don't amount to much, I should think, although I wish I was acquainted with him. I'd -put him up to a thing or two, you'd better believe, I wouldn't mind going on and fighlting a broadsword combat, with the American flag in one hand and a pair of top boots on my feet to give effect to the scene, and let these Spaniards know that there's one feller ready to defend the honor of his country at all hazards. Or, if that wouldn't do, let's get up "Tom and Jerry," with you and me in the boxing scene, and give 'em a specimen of the " manly art." .You can box, I know, for I have seen you do some neat things with yotur mawlers at Iong Kong. We could kinder be easy with each other, and astonish the folks in this part of the world with the kind of stuff the Yankees are made of." "I don't think that it would succeed, Tom, for the manager is shy of amateurs," I replied, amused at his rattling, off-hand man- ner, and forgeOtting my misery in, listening to him. "Then we must try something else that will carry the town by storm," Tom exclaimed. "Suppose I should get up a ballet, drill the girls myself, and learn 'em all the peritropal movements; see that their skirts are short enough, and that they are graceful while dancing. In a, week's time I think that I could give .a good representatonu, and that the girls would do credit to my , 'training." ' It wouldn't do, Tom; the ladies would be scandalized, and refuse to visit the house, if they knew that a roue' like you was j  engaged in the matter." "r 'Then the men would be more fierce to see the ballet, and I ;  believe that it would pay. If the manager refuses to get up my piece, I'll hire his theatre, and open it for the gratification of my ;  frtiends. I can do it, and I will." ' Where will you find the girls, Tom?"I asked. "A man with money can always find enough of them. But,   A FRIEND 'S ADVICE.        143 speaking of women, my friend, I have observed that you don't look quite like yourself irecently; I: don't firnd any of that hail fellow you used to exhibit at Hong Kong, and which was the de- light of' our club. What is the matter? any trouble? Confide in me, my boy, and I'll give you some good advice. Jf money mat- ters are not all rights name the sum, and you are welcome to it." I assured my friend that money was not required to make me enjoy life, and endeavored to give his thoughts another turn, but it was in vain. "Something is the matter, I know, for I can see that you are growing thin. 'Tain't a woman affair- is it? If it is, just take my advice, and get out of it as fast as possible, I've been, there, I have, and I know all about it. Two years ago I had to leave New York to get eured of the heart complaint, or I should have married and settled for life afore this; and then what chance for fun should I have had? There is fun enough without your giving up your life for one womamn. Ride, flirt, and have a good time, and the handsomest woman in the country will no longer have a turn upon your heart. 1Itell you I ain't very old, but I have had a darned lot of experience in this world, and if a feller will only follow my directions, I can bring him out as whole as -" "Yourself?." I suggested, seeing that he hesitated for a word. "Precisely; I can do what I promise, you had better believe. Now we are of the same ages, but I'll wager a supper that I've seen more of life than you, 'cos I always lived ifi New York, and the governor always kept; me well supplied with money, and I went it with a rush, until he sent mie as junior partner to that blasted Hong Kong, where there's no life, nor'f, nor handsome womlen. Dust and sands high winds and nakled Chinamen, ate all that a feller sees thered; and when I want filun,I say I'm sicl,- and come over here and have it; there's some I ife here, if you only look for it."  I smiled at his eagerness to convince me that he was up to the tricks of the world, and he continued .;-: "Now I don't want you to tell me the secret of your heart, 'cos that is none of my business, but I want to see you cheerful and all right; and to do so I want you to put yourself under my directions for a few days, and if you don't call me a good doctor, then I will resign my position, and give you up as incurable. What do you say?"    "4       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.- "What remedies do you propose to use?" "That is my secret.' I shall use agreezable ones; but to do so, I must have the use' of your house for a few nights. Here,I julst call your coachmnan, and send him home with orlders to hlaive a first-class supper for four all ready at twelve to-night, while I write an order to my landlord to send to your residence a dpzen bottles of , Mum's green seal. It is wine that I broullght over with me ; I know what it is." "But who is to compose our party?"I demanded. "No matter.  Two of them will be gentlemeni and two of them -" At this moment the thin face of Father Juan was turned towards me, and I saw a malicious smile upon his countenance. He had overheard every word of our conversation, and seemed rejoiced at it. I had gone too far to recede, for I knew, that what had been said would be related to Donna Teresa in a few minutes, and perhaps I took a malicious joy in having her hear that I was growing wild under her cold treatment. "Invite whom you please," I said to Tom; " the supper will be ready, and I pledge the reputation of my cook that it shall be a good one." "That's the talk- spoken like a man. We will make a i:ight of it, and through the influence of champagne, and as pretty eyes as can be found in Manila, I pledge my word that you will be a different man in a week's time." I called my coachman, who was not far from the theatre, smok- ing a cigar on his box,- gave him the necessary orders, and direc- tions to return to the theatre as soon as he had executed them, and then once more joined Tom. - 1 ' '     ll   FATHER JUAN AND4 TOMh        145 CH lAPTER VI. [ A WARNING,-FATHER JU.&N ON THE TRAIL. --TOM AND DONNA TERESA.--THE SUPPER, AND WHAT COME OF IT. ON my return to the theatre I encountered the dark, piercing eyes of Father Juan, who seetmed to be hovering around me that nilght as though I were upon some treasonable errand, and he. was determined to secure a reward for my apprehension. I passed him without remark, but I did not fail to detect the sneer of tri- ump chwhich his thin lips expressed, although he did make an effort to hide it. While I stood watching the retreating form of the priest, I felt a hand upon my shoulder, and turning, saw Tom Baker. "I say, old feller," cried Tom, " what are you looking after that old codgrer for? Don't owe him anything - do you? HHe has just been telling me what a good friend he is of yours, and so I had to shake hands with hilm on thlat, and ask him to drink; but he declined in such a way that I think he would take a drop behind the door. Who is the old cock? He acts like a gentle- . mnlan." "That is Father, Juan, of the convent of Sebastian," I replied. "I knew that he was a priest, but I wish I had known thlat he was connected with a convent. I'm blessed if I wouldn't have asked him to let mne see his girls, and I wouldn't mind giving a pretty sum for the privilege. The old cock seemed kinder gra- cious, although I didn't talk but a few ninutes with him, for he was in a hurrly." "You had better keep your money, and not ask for such privi- leges as you desire, if you wish to keep a whole skin," I said, walking slowrlytowards the theatre, arm in arm with Tom. "I Whole skin'? What do you mean?" he asked in surprise. "Simply that the priests- of Manila would not let the govern- or general look at the girls whom they have in charge; so you can imagine what show of,success a heretic like, you would have. Make no offers of money to such men, unless for church purposes, for they can command a hundred knives." - 10   "6     -  LIFE IN TI-/E EAST INDIES. - "That for their knives," crledl Tom, snapping his fingers with all the bravado of an American. "'I've got a six-shooter in my pocket that would frighten a dozen natives." 7'U Provided, of course, it was pointed at them, which they would take precious good care should not be the case. The men I speak of strike when you least expect the blow, and in the dark. Be careful, Tom, for your life is precious to your country." The fellow laughed, and said no more about being introduced to convent girls; but when we entered the theatre he surveyed the house through his opera-glass, one of the relics of his fast days, a splendid instrument, mounted with gold and pearl, and well cal- culated to catch the eyes of Spanish ladies. "Who in thunder is that?" cried Tom, regardless of the play, directing his glass towards the box of Donna Teresa. "I thought that I had seen some handsome women in my day, but she knocks 'em all higher than a kite. What eyes I and what a face! Tell me who she is, or I shall go and -" "Comminit suicide," I suggested. "No, sir, not for a woman. I meant that I should go and take a gin cocktail. And while I am speaking of that strange but ex- tremely palatable mixture, would you credit the assertion when I state that not a man in the city seems to know the meaning of the words, and I am actually obliged to concoct the drink with my own hands? But see, the lady is lookincg this way, and as I live she is bowing and smiling. Blast it, it can't be possible that I have made a conquest so soon. Yet it must be so, for now the smile is changed to a look of extreme melancholy. What shall I do I Shall I go to her box, and introduce myself? or shall I send her a note, declaring that I love her to distraction?" "I should not recommend either course," I answered, dryly. "Why not? I'm not afraid of that black devil in uniform, who talks with her every few minutes, 'cos I believe that I've got more science than he has, and could knock him out of tilme in a couple of rounds." "Perhaps the officer would prefer steel to fists:"I remarked. "Even then I should give him a fair show, for I had two quar- v ters with Professor Sharpedcge, the best small-sword man in York, and he used to boast of my performances. But joking aside, how shall I malike the acquaintance of the lady? for she has lighted a fire in my heart that all cocktails ever concocted could not extinguish.   A CONFERENCE.          147 Is- she married or single, rich or poor? But she don't look as though she was short of cash, for, by Jove, she has got lots of diamonds on her person, and they are of the first water, too; for , let mne alone for knowing paste."    l "She is a widow, "I answered, c' and very rich. She has more admirers than she knows by name; is as good as she is handsome; but I don't think you 'would stand any chance for her affections." "Don't believe that," replied Tom, with commendable assur- ance. "I know how to deal with women better than most men, 'cos I've had such a deuced lot of experience in York. Give me an introduction, and then let me alone for working my way into her heart as a rabbit burrows in a bank of earth." '"The comparison is too strong to be resisted," I replied. '"You shall have an introduction, and much good may it do you." Tom was so overjoyed that he insisted upon repairing to the saloon of the theatre, and imbibing, a glass of wine; and as there was nothing upon the stage that was worth seeing, I readily con- sented. Tom smoked his cigar and sipped his wine in silence for a few minutes, but at length said, - "Speaking of the pretty 'widow with the millions, why the deuce has it never occurred- to you that it would be a great stroke of policy to marry her? hey?" "What chance could I stand with a lively woman, like her, fond of bull-fights and kindred sports?"I replied, evasively. "That's so," cried Tom, energetically. "A woman likes a man that has got some dash and go-ahead in him- one that is a favorite with her own sex, and gives her a little cause for jealousy." "Say some such a man as yourself," I suggested, with a smile. "' Well, joking aside, I rather flatter myself that I am calcu- lated to make some woman happy and miserable at the same time ; and with your recommendation, I'd imarry the widow this night, with all ceremony." "Provided, of course, she would have you,': I replied, with a laugh at his assurance., "If she knew me she would have me fast enlough. But don't let us sit here discussing improbabilities all night, when better things await us. Let us take a look at the theatre, and then for our company and supper."       -       -   "8       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. We locked arms and sauntered back to the theater, and once more surveyed the audience and the stage. On the latter a young peasant was telling a high-born lady that he would die for her, if it was necessary; and the lady didn't seem to know whether it was best to be grateful or indignant, and finally split the difference, and began to cry, which act made Tom sarcastic, for he said it was a weapon that they always used upon all oc-  casions and in all places. In the box with Teresa was Father Juan, who seemed to be communicating some news to the lady, for she was listening at- tentively to all that he said; and I sqw that, as he proceeded, a  frown gathered upon his brow, and she looked as I had seen her t but once before. "Hallo! what is the matter with: the handsome widow?" " asked Tom, surveying her through his glass. "She looks as cross as a girl that has lost her lover. Slie's got a bit of temper, j I'll warrant, and I'd like her all the better for it. Hang it, I  can't bear a woman that's too insipid to quarrel, and always has  an amiable expression of face, as though prepared for heaven at any moment. When I was in New York, I used to pay atten- i tion to the girls who had the most temper, just for the purpose  of getting them mad and jealous at times; but once I carried  the joke too far, and got this cut on my forehead, to pay for my I, trouble." He showed a scar, an inch long, near his left temple; and the wound had evidently been a severe one. "The she-devil threw a tumbler at me," Tom continued; " and W it struck with some force, you had better believe; and for a few ; weeks I was incapable of joking. But would you think it, the girl was the first one to offer me assistance, and to express sor- i row for the occurrence. What unaccountable beings women are -ain't they? At one moment they are ready to kill us, and the b i next breath to love us; and hang me if you know when they are  ready for either."            ' Tom -continued railing until the priest had finished the commu- nication he was charged with, and then I saw him leave the lady's box in the same cat-like manner which was so characteristic of" the man. He passed near us, but did not raise his eyes from the floor, where they were fixed, as though searching for lost pocket-books. 4 Come, introduce me to-night to the widow," cried Tom, who   AT HOME.           149 had hardly removed his glass from the face of the lady. "The more I see of her, the more love and admiration I feel. Now is as good a time as any other, and I should so enjoy a chat with her in the face of the whole house!" The proposition did not suit my convenience; so I found no difficulty in making Tom consent to a postponement until a more favorable opportunity, and by the time his thoughts took another turn, I looked at my watch, and found that it was past ten. "Come along, for we have seen enough of this for one night," my companion exclaimed. '! I'm getting supperish, and must be off to keep my appointment. You take your carriage and drive home, and I'll be there 'fore half an hour's time. Tell the cook to have supper at twelve, precisely, and to cool the champagne by exposure in water in the open air. You be ready to receive me and may company, and then you shall have your choice, and we'll make a night of it." I promised compliance with his wishes, and we parted just as the curtain fell upon the close of the last piece. He rolled off in his carriage at a rapid speed, and I took my course homeward, dissatisfied with myself, with Donna Teresa, and with Tom, for 1 began to think thlat I had consented most too readily to have my house turned into a den of revelry, although I knew that my neighbors would think none the less of me for it, for but few prudish people exist in ]Manila, and it's one of the best cities for turning deaf ears to little faults I ever lived in. I-found my cook hard at work at his supper, which he assured me should be worthy of his skill, and after seeing that everything was prepared for the reception of my company, I recommenced on my pile of newspapers, and was busy over a long article on the landing of filibusters at Cuba, when my boy-of-all-work en- tered the room, looking as though -he had something important to commrlunicate. "Senor, the holy Father SJuan has been here this evening," he said.     * "Indeed! for what?"I asked, somewhat astonished. "He asked if you were at home, senor, and when I said that you were at the theatre, he left immediately." - ' Did he say nothing more?"I inquired. "Nothing, senor; only he remarked, that by the smell of the food he should suppose you intended to have company to-night."   150      ' LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. ( And your answer?"I demanded, somewhat sternly. "I said, senor,that I did not know your business, and that you would inform him if he would visit the theatre." I ruminated for some time respecting the visit of the priest, for it was to me very evident that Father Jiuan was trackingD my steps, and was determined to see whom I entertained, for the purpose of informing Teresa, and if possible breaking off the alliance which he still seemed to think existed between us. "I will defeat him yet," I muttered; and summoning the boy, I gave special orders that if Father Juan called a second time, he was not to be admitted to the house, and no answers returned to his questions. I had hardly given the directions when a carriage drove up, and I heard Tom's voice directing his coachman to return home, as he should have no further use for his services that nioht. Then I heard my friend talk half in English and the other portion Spanish, with an immense amount of laughing, and up stairs he rushed, leadingu two young girls, whose black eyes and dark hair would have capturediless susceptible hearts than his own. "Here we are, old boy," he exclaimed; "just on time, as I told you. I've trotted 'em out, and now what do you think of 'em? hey? Pretty -- ain't they? Create a sensation in New York --would they?   Can't speak a word of English, except to say Blast you, and they don't know the meaning of it. I learned it to 'em as we came along. In a week's time we can make them swear like pirates, and they won't know what it's all about.- Capital fun it will be--won't it?" The girls, apparently about sixteen years of age, had not the remotest idea what he was saying; but as he laughed they felt bound to do the same, and for a few minutes we had a very merry time of it. "I say, don't it do you good to see the girls laugh?" cried Tom, throwing his armrs around one of them in the exuberance of his joy, and kissing her right heartily, for which he got a lit- tle pat upon his cheek which would not have injured a mosquito. "You have not introduced me, Tom," I said, almost envious of the sport which he was appropriating to himself so readily. "Don't need one, my boy; go in and enjoy yourself as well as you can.  Don't you See that I have set the example? But as you are one of the scrupulous kind, here goes for their names.   OUR COMPANY.           51- This one with the pink piney dress is Catalina, and the one with the white dress is Margarita. Both are pretty, as you can see for yourself, and both can scold or sing, as the humor takes them. Catalina goes with me to Hong Kong, when I leave this city, and if you desire, Margarita will renlain to bless your lonely hours." The girls seemed to be aware that Tom was introducing them, for they took possession of c'hairs, and then laughed to such an extent, that my boy-servant rushed in with a tray of paper cigars, thinking that where there was-so much mirth, smoking would be of the first importance. 'i Now, Tom," I said, as, soon as Hha(d made my guests at home, " where did you get acquainted with these ladies? Let me liave the whole history," I I'll do that, and no mistake," he replied, lighting a cigar, and throwing an armn around the waist of Catalina- a freedom which fI she permitted without the least reluctance. "A week ago I saw ? the girls leaving a church, and as I thought they liked my per- sonal. appearance, I just followed them to their residence, was asked in, told to make nmyself at home; and faith I did. I had (  money, wlhich they wanted; so no questions have been asked on either side. They admire me, and I'm sure I do them. I told them to get ready and come to supper, and they are here. You see they are not of pure blood, but they are just as interesting I  as though they were. I only wish I had one in New York, promenading down Broadway. I'll bet I would make the bQys starle." I  "No habla Ingles mas," cried Catalina, with a pout of her pretty lips. i   ( "And we won't, my darling," exclaimed Tom, with overpow- ering tenderness; " we will speak Spanish if it kills us. 'What a sweet language it is, to be sure, when heard issuing from a pair of pretty lips! I've learned more of it in the last week than I could by studying grammar a twelvemonth, thanks to Catalina's teachng." And thus Tom ran on, struggling desperately with his bad Spanish, and laughing heartily as the girls and- myself, when he committed a bad blunder, which I think he often did on purpose. "By the way," said. Tom, all at once looking serious, "I met that old cock of a priest just as I was sentering the house,and   152       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. he looked at me as though I was eloping with some of his lambs.  What is the old fool doing lat this hour of the night, wander- ing around streets and theatres, instead of attending to his flock and drinking punch at home?" "And he stared at me," said Catalina, with a toss of her pretty C head, " as though I had no right to visit the house of a friend and ! partake of, a supper."' "I will twist his neck,/ Tom shouted, " if he dares to look at j you aRgain."      -  "O, no," cried both girls in a breath; " he is a padre, and therefore sacred. You must not strike him; if you do there will be no chance of your salvation, and we love the Americans, and  want them all to be saved."         - "Angelic simplicity!" exclaimed. Tom, with a vigorous laugh ; .  ' since you want him unmolested, consider him safe. But i come, Guillermo; you still look unhappy. Is not this better than :t remaining in the house, moping over books and papers, and not knowing what to do with .yourself?" "I am quite contented," I replied; but I must confess I did l not, feel so, for I had a foreboding that something was about to happen, and that the espionage of the priest. Juan had much to : do with it. I tried to assume an appearance of gayety that was forced but I could not help it. "' Go; Margarita,"' said Tom, tt and salute our host with a kiss. If that don't cheer him, nothing will." The girl hesitated for a moment; but seeing that I did not forbid her, she rose, with burning cheeks, and glided across the room. Then she threw her bare arms around my neck, and pressed her red lips to mine. From that moment all melancholy fled. "Will the American love the Mestiza girl?" she whispered, as she took a seat by my side, and leaned her' head upon my % shoulder, while her black eyes were raised to mine as though she would read my thoughts. "I will try to do so,"l I answered, smoothing her soft, luxuriant hair, and feeling that I was on treacherous ground, if I intended to preserve my fidelity to Donna Teresa. "Is it so very hard, then, for you to love me?" she asked, with  a slight pout.                       ! "Not hard, for you are very beautiful," I answered; "but you must know that the Americans are reputed to be a cold race,   ,&N INTERRUPTION.         , and only love after repeated interws. Yo u w ould nothave me asstime a passion I did not feel? '  s O, no," she murmured, uslnIg her eyes with all the skill of a coquette; " only try and love me, and I don't- fear but you will succeed." I felt the truth of her remark, and I knew that I should provO. unworthy the love of Douna Teresa, unless I steeled mysdl:f against such insidious advances. I strove to break away fromh] her fascinations; but she knew her power, vud exercised it with the skill of a master; and had not the luchacho just at that moment informed us lthat supper was on the table, I fear that I should have forgotten myself, and so lost my self-respect and caution. Suopper," cried Tom, springing from his seat; "I'm glad to hear it - ain't you, ladies?" Of course they were; and when they saw how luxuriantly the table was spread, they were in raptures; for be it known, O reader, that even Spanish beauties are as fond of the products of the cuisine as American belles after a five hours' sleigh-ride. "Splendid i " cried Tom, rubbing his hands with satisfaction; and w-e were just about to take seats, when a loud rapping was heard upon the door of the court-yard. "Who, in the devil's name, has called o at this hour of the night?" demanded Tom, listening for a repetition of the sounds which had so startled us.       4  I could return no answer, for the no were as mysterious to me as spiritual manifestations. My boy looked at me with an inquiring glance for orders, and at length X made him a sign, and he disappeared down the broad staircase which led to the court- . yard. "I hope no one is about to interrupt us with our supper, for we have a very pleasant party already, and additions would, only spoil it," Tom grumbled; and hardly had he concluded when I heard a voice in angry altercation with my servant, which made my heart quake with terror, and I would have given thousands to have seen my frieund and his two companions spirited through the window by the old gentleman whose name had been invoked but a few seconds before. I was caught in a trap, and the only thing that could save me was tact and assurance. "' Silence, for Heaven's sake!"IT pleaded, as Tom was about ,    154       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.           to roar out an oath. "Let us hear how the boy deals with the visitors."                          i I My friend gaw that I was really in earnest, although for what  reason he could not divine; but he left off grumbling, and be- ! haved quite peaceably.           ,  "I tell you, senora, Don Guillermo is not at home," cried nay  boy, earnestly ; and I heard him try to shut the door, but he could i. not succeed.                         q "Then what is the meaning of so many lights in the house?" was the inquiry, in tones that made me tremble.        "The servants have a party to-night, senora, during the ab- X sence of our master. You will probably find himi at the hotel,  playing billiards with the English naval officers," was the reply;  and I mentally resolved to increase that boy's wages, if his false- r;, hood succeeded.-  "Miserable ladt:one," was the quick rejoinder, I know that your master is within, for I saw him at the window not ten :; minutes since. Stand one side, and admit us, or it will be the worse for you." Yo" 'ou cannot enter," the lad said, with firmness; and for a moment I heard a scuffle; but it was of short duration. The resistance grew more feeble, and at length ceased; and I thought that I could' distinguish the chink of gold, which accounted for the cessation. Up the broad steps I heard two persons advancing, and I knew the sound of their footfalls as well as though I had seen them. "For God's sake, ;hat is the matter? idemanded Tom, no- ticing my tremor and pallor. '"Open a bottle of champagne, and give me a glass as quick as possible," I whispered, for I felt the need of spiritual consola- tion when I was about to face and' lose one I loved better than life itself. Quicker than thought Tom had filled my glass, and I drained it just as the nocturnal visitors reached the door of the room where my company was assembled. I looked up, and saw a lady covered with a heavy black veil, so that not a particle of her face was visible, and behind her, with gloating eyes, stood the hateful form of Father Juan, the worst enemy I had in Manila. Truly had his hour'of triumph arrived, as he had prophesied it would, at the convent of San Pedro, two months before, when I   ,A BAD .POSITION. 1-V had refused to sanction the scheme for his advancement at my expense. I4 Buenas noches, senores," said the lady, in a voice that was tremulous with passion. "Perhaps we are intruding rupon such select company. If we are, say so, and we will retire. I have seen enough to convince me that there is no honesty in the world, and that a man's word is like a rope of sand." I could not speak if I had attempted the task; but Tom was not so embarrassed, and answered for me. "Intrusion, lady?" he repeated ; " why, you must be a stranger here, or you would know that everything that wears a petticoat is welcome in this house. To be sure we ordered supper for four, but Guillermo's liberality is great, and there's enough for six.  So off with your veil, and sit down with us.-" "For God's sake, Tom!"I pleaded; but he paid but little at- tention to me. "His infamy is worse than I expected; but I thank God that I have discovered his wickedness before it is too late," cried the veiled female, although I thought that I detected something like a sob with the exclamation. "' Did I not tell you, senuora;" the priest said, advancing'a step forward. "And I wish that your tongue had been blistered before you spoke a word of his falsehoods," cried the lady, fiercely., "( Senora, have I deserved this?" the priest asked, in a humble tone. "You have opened my eyes to this man's baseness," she said, pointing to me; and I could see the angry glare of her eyes although covered by a veil; ; and I thank you for it; but do not presume too much on that, for perhtaps it would have been better for both of us if I had remained in ignoralnce of this night's do- ings."              .          ' "I sought to prevent you from giving your hand to this heretic, for he is unworthy of your love," returned Father Juan, still maintaining his composure. "Of that I am the best judge," she replied, so proudly that the priest did not venture another suggestion. "Madam," cried Tom, risng with a full glass of champagne,, "we drink to your health, and a speedy reconciliation to the man  i              ]   or 156      LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. you love, for you must love some one; bat I hope I'm not the "Silence, sirrah!" cried the priest, fiercely ; " you know not whom you speak to so lightly." "EHallo, old convent; are you there? Come and sit down by the side of me, and I'll drink you blind in an hour's time." "Let us retire' from this scene of vice," the priest cried, lay- ing his hand upon the lady's arm; but she shook him off as though he had been contamination.  ; "Guillermo," the veiled lady asked, with an evident soften- inmg of anger, " have you, nothing to say before we part. never to meet again?,"  "I have much to say to you," I answered;" but this is not the  time nor place."  "Then farewell, for I leave the cares of this world, and this I life of anxiety and disappointment, for the seclusion of a convent. : For your unkindness I pardon you. Think of me sometimes, and * I will pray for you." I could see a gleam of devilish triumph in the eyes of the priest B as he listened to this declaration.           -  M "Let us leave these sinful wretches to their worldly pleasures,"  he said; "For us there are purer joysand better rewards." ,  Sbe  turned to go, but hesitated, as though she would like to I speak a  few more words of parring advice.  "Guillermo" she saidt " did you ever love me truly and sin- cerely?" She threw aside her dark veil as she spoke, as though to give , me a  full view of her glorious beauty, and let me contrast it with X the faces of Catalina and Margarita, who, poor girls, fihad with- drawn to a  corner of the room at the first intrusion, and remained  there silent and motionless, fearful of the penance which Father X Juan sometimes inflicted, or caused to be done throutgh his in-  fluence.                     -  "By thunder!" was Tom's roaring exclamation, when he saw the face of Donna Teresa, "it's the beauty I saw at the theatre. Who is she in love with, you or me?"  "  Teresa," I said, "I have loved you for many months, and do you think that a  passion like mine can be extiiguished in a -few days?  As I loved you months since, so do I love you now, and never better than- at this moment."    A PLEA.            157 I could see that her heart was changing from its terrible anger to a feeling more in accordance with woman's nature. The priest saw it, too, and he grew restive and anxious. "Let us leave, senora," he whispered, ' Pr we may be sus- pected of partaking in their orgies. We have no time to lose, for I know that the air is tainted with vice." Poor Tom had sat in a mist of wonderment from the time that Teresa had withdrawn her veil; but at length a light began to dawn upon his mind. He saw at once that there was a lover's quarrel between Teresa and myself, and that the priest was at the bottom of it. His knowledge of Spanish was not extensive, but he could understand enough' to know that Father Juan was en- deavoring to urge the lady to leave the house before a reconcilia- tion was effected; and Tom's generous nature was opposed to any such arrangement, for the instant he saw that Teresa and my- self had been lovers, and were only separated by a slight mis- understanding, he resolved to forget his half-developed passion for the lady, and do me all the-service in his power. He con- sidered that the most important duty he could perform, just at that moment, would be to get the priest out of the way; for he knew enough  of the world to understand that a lover- can act his part to some advantage, if a few moments' private conversation is granted him. Therefore, when the priest urged a retreat, all of my friend's New York qualities were brought out in an instant. "Leave the room, 'padre!" he shouted, laying hold of a cham- pagne bottle, and taking aimr at Juan's head. The holy father dodged behind the ladJr in visible alarm, but not a step did he stir towards the staircase. -' Gently, Tom," I exclaimed, laying a hand upon his arm, and restraining his anger. ' It won't do to kill priests in Manila." "Well, some of them ought to be killed for interfering in love affairs. But I won't kill the man - I'll only maim him a little, and see how he likes it." "Be quiet, or you will spoil the advantage that we have already gained;" and Tom sat down, muttering that he could knock the s old buffer " heels over head-at the first round. Teresa had remained standing, undecided whether to retreat  or still listen to my explanations; and to mi1 surprise she chose   158       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.         I revels.                 -! '  Whlat explanation do you wish to make before I leave you  fowrever?" she asked,  haughtily. "'He can make none," cried the priest, hastily. He has  been caught in the act of committing a sin, which true love  should have warned him against. He is not to be trusted. Let us leave him.'  Once more Tom's hand sough t the bottle, and again did the priest dodge behind Teresa to keep from harm's way; but I inter- posed and saved'the head of the holy father from broken glass.  ' Let me talk with you, Teresa," I said, "for a few minutes  alone, and with that'confidence which I enjoyed some months since, when I was happy- happy because I believed that I pos. sessed your love, and that I returned it tenfold; for when did a i day pass that I did not think or dream of you? Was I not al- . ways by your side to protect you and console you? and not until  you grew cold in your affection did I cease to do so. I still love  yoll most dearly, and always shall; but it breaks my heart to be thus suspected by one to whom I have never been untrue."  "That's the talk," muttered Tom; " pile on the agony, and she can't withstand it. I couldn't do better myself. Fire another shot, and she will strike, or Irm no judge of womrien."  "I should think there was little need of explanation with these: two women in the roomn," Teresa said, bitterly, pointing to Ca- . talina and Margarita.   "An explanation should not be received," muttered the-priest, S glancing at Tomas he spoke, and evidently fearful of-athe effect - of his words. "Let us leave, senora, and then theyi can recoinm- mence their: carousals without restriction. You swore to cast him off; now remember your oath, and do so at once." "I swore to forget -him," she answered, with dignity, if he  had ceased to love me. If I'thought that he had- ---     i -But he has not, senora" clried Tom, starling up; ' for I as- sure you on my word as an Amnerican gentleman, and one who has resided for many years in New York, the Empire City of the X! new world, that I invited these two excellent ladies here this  evening on my own responsibility, and that my friend Guillermo a never saw them before to-night."   TOMaS DEMAND.          159 The priest stepped forwardto, whisper a word in her ear, for he didn't care about trusting his voice in the hearing of Tomr; but the latter gentleman was on the alert, and on his first motion the bottle was raised, and the holy father made a dodoge backward. 6' Can I believe him?" she asked, earnestly, her voice trem- bling with emotion. "He has told the truthl," I answered; " and under such circum- stances is iktoo much to ask' for a moment's private conversa- tion? Think, Teresa, what I have suffered the past few weeks by your coldness, and how eager I am to learn why you have been so distant. Five minutes is all that I require, and then, if you wish me to leave you, I will do so with as sorrowful a heart as ever man carried away from the presence of his mistress." l"He has been the most unhappy man that I ever saw, the past few weeks," Tom said, thinking he had remained silent long enough. "' He is reduced to a skeleton, and moans in his sleep; but for all that, senora, he has always mentioned your name in his daily prayerS, and uttered no complaint. I couldn't see my best friend dying by inches without doing something to saye him ; so I introduced these two ladies, daughters of highly respectable parents, I assure you, to him. I'm engaged to one of them, and the marriage will take place when I'm ready, and not before." The three last words were uttered in English, and with as grave a face as was ever assumed by a Chinese merchant when about to make a good bargain,  ,- The cloud. passed from Teresa's brow, but she didn't wish to be convinced too soon. '" I thought you told me that the girls were malo," she said, looking at the priest. "And so they--" Before the priest could finish his expose, Tom had sprung to his feet, and interrupted him. "I demand," he said, " that that man-leave the room while this conference is going on. He has no right here, and he is continually interrupting business. Such a thing would not be tolerated in New York for a moment. Even the Empire Club would kick against such a state of things." "I am the champion of this-lady," the holy father replied. "Then you are a cursed bad champion, and r m going to van- o          160       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. quish you with a bottle. I'll battle you with a basket of cham.  pagne, and the loser shall pay for it."    ;  Teresa did not understand my friend's meaning, and supposing i that he was hurling a challenge at the priest's head, she became eager to prevent trouble.                .:s "Go, father," she said, " and remain in the street until I call  you; or you had better return to your convent, and I will trust to the kindness of Guillermo to see me home." "' Blast me, if things ain't working all right!" exclaimed Tom, draiuing his glass of champagne, and- winking at the girls, who still remained in a corner, to keep quiets and he would make it  all smooth with them at some future time, not very definitely [ stated.  "I cannot leave you here, daughter, without incurring a great responsibility. This is not the place for one like you to remain i in, at such an hour of the night. Go with me, and let the senor i call upon you in the morning, at your residence, and there offer  such excuses as he may invent." For a moment I feared that she would accept this reasonable i proposition; and if she had, the priest would have brought such  influence'to bear, that I should never have had the satisfaction of speaking with her a second time. For only a moment she hesi- tated, and then her wilful look returned, and the priest was van- quished in a fight where I had, such tremendous odds against me  as two good-looking girls. Had they both been plain and old, iS she would not have cared near as much, for a handsome woman  is seldom jealous of homely girls.  "I have said that I would speak with Guillermo, and I will,"  she cried, angrily; and the padre saw, with rage, that any further :I urging on his part would be useless, for he knew that Teresa had  a will of her own, and knew how to use it.  Father Juan cast a look of malignant hatred upon me as he : crept towards the stairs, and his anger was not decreased when I he saw that Tom was standing up, and drinking his health with c mock solemnity.  "Good by, old Daddy Longlegs," shouted Tom; " call again  when you happen this way, say a year or two hence." "I  don't understand you," said the priest, willing to delay his  'departure as long as possible, turning to Tom, who had spoken in English.   AN INTERVIEW.          161 i "No; I suspect you don't want to ,understand some wnolesome truths; but I ata glad that I've had the opportunity to tell you what I think JSout your conduct. A feller like you would be rode on a rail by the Bowery Boys of New York, if he should attempt to separate true lovers. Now you mnay go, and the devil go with you for company. Catalila and Margarita, will you come and join me in-drinking to the confusion of the holy father?" The poor girls hung their heads with some show of terror, for they kniew what would. be their penance if they insulted the padre. Father Juan smiled savagely for a moment; but when he saw' that the girls had too much respect for his office to insult him, he turned from them to Donna Teresa. "Do you still insist upon remaining here, senora, with liber- tines and wantons for companions?" he asked. "I hlave told you that I think Guillermo entitled to a hearing, and that he shall have one. The subject 'needs no further dis- CUSSlOB 1 cusssiorl." ' i' Then I go, senorar--  "Well, why in thunder don't you go, and not stand there talk- ing about the matter all night?" Tom had paid suich repeated attentions to the bottle, that he began to grow jocose, and perhaps the padre thought quarrel- some; for the latter, after one more look about the room, stole quietly down stairs, and in a moment afterwards I heard the boy let him into the street. "Teresa," said I, taking her hand, which she as quickly with. drew, i" will you now allow me, to speak to you alone, and with the same confidence that I enjoyed a few Wveeks since? Perhaps your coldness cau be explained and remedied." She bowed her stately head, and I led her to my sitting-room, leaving Tom and his young ladies to whisper and talk of love as muchl as they pleased. i' To enable us to understand each other, it is necessary that a confession -should be made," I said, placing chairs so that-I could, throw my arms around her waist, if I thought there was a pros- pect of her fainting, or forgiving me. "I am ready to listen to: all that you may have to offer,"'she replied; and Isaw by her face that she was determined I should define my position before she was ready to auswer my questions, "  '   162 "FE IN THE EAST INDIES. kw Have you ceased to love me?"I asked, in tones so sad that 'I knew words would hlve commanded the unbounded admiration of my friend;Tom.

"They lied, Teresa!"I exclaimed, warmly, for with all my sins I must chsas t  ?hat I loved the lady for herself alone.  "I now begin to see that I was deceived, nd acknolee my error. Forgive me,'Guillr, mo as I forgive you." Her head was on myshoulder and her lips near at hand. leed I say that I sealed our reconciliation in a manner that provoked no angry response, but before I could repeat the operation, Tom, after k'nocking at the door, threw it open. "That old humbug ha com e back atain, cried he, * . ' *  ,    '         . -   ANOTHER INTERRUPTION.        1 63 We listened for a moment, and sure enougrh, we heard noise sufficient to answers for a moderate earthquake. Tfhe-huge gate which opened on the court-yard was shaken as though all the peo- ple in the house were deaf or dead, and those on the outside were anxious to break in without a moment's delay.  1 I was about to step to thle window for the purpose of interro- gating the priest in regard to his intentions, when Tom begged me to desist, and leave the matter entirely to him. (' I know how to treat those kind of fellers,"' he Said. I readily gave my consent, for I began to fear that the knock- ing would attract sbme attention, and lead to inquiries which would not be likely to raise the reputation of Donna Teresa in Tom, with an expression of intense delight upon his face, went to the table, drank a huge glass of'champagne, and then made the girls, Catalina and Margarita, do the same, after which op- eration he began to look around the room, and at length lighted upon an earthen jar, that would hold about two pails of water. This he directed the boy to fill, and then to carry it down stairs. " Remember, Tom," I said; " no violence to the priest. He is most powerful here in lMBanila." "I wouldn't hurt a hair of his head for a thousand dollars,"' my friend answered. ', That row, however, musjt be stopped, and I'm the boy to do it. Peaceably if I can, forcibly if I must, as some celebrated New Yorker once said; but when, or'where, I don't know." With these words Tom went down stairs. '1 Why in the devil's name don't you open the door," some one roared in the street. I thought that I knew the voice, for it didn't sound like Father Juan's; but I was somewhat.nervous and con- filsed, and didn't pay-that attention I-should have done, had I been calm, and not beneath the roof with Donna Teresa, and two ladies whom I wished away. "All right!" shouted Tom, in reply, laughing so heartily at some freak that entered his head, he was compelled to hold on to the boy to support timself., " You shall be attended to in a minute; nevrer fear," Tom con- tinned, motioning for the boy to withdraw the bar of the door. The lad did as he was directed, and just as the bar was raised I saw Tom grasp the huge stone jar that contained the water.   164       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. ' What are you going to do?"I demanded, somewhat alarmed at lis proceedings.             7 ,      Before he could answer me there was a vigorous push against the door. It flew open, and a burly form darkened the entrance,. "Watch, O! watch, and heave!"Tom shouted, adopting the language of sailors when about to try the soundings by a deep  sea lead.  By a vigorous jerk the water was shot out of the jar and  dashed upon the person of the intruder, covering him from head  to foot. "Now, old cock," roared Tom, b how do you like the fashion  of rousing people up at thils timne of night?? ' There was an inmense amount of blowing, and spluttering, and  grunting; and at length I could hear a loud laugh, which I should have recognized in any part of the world.  c; By the Lord Ilarry, Benventuro; but this is a reception with  a vengeance. Thank Heaven, you got the worst of it." (' Alien! " shouted; " is that you? i' ' Well, I should think that it vlas," he replied, with another laugh, more loud than the first.  "Don't, ask if this is me; mn ay the devil confound you and the house too," cried my old fat friend, Father Benventuro. "Santa Barbara! What have I done that I should be treated like a rat?  What was water ever made for except to drown people in. It  seems as thoulgh the whole of the Rio?sic had been emptied  over me.        ,  Why, this isn't the old convent cock," cried Tom, completely  sobered by the mistake he had made. "I thought that it was  Father Juan."  L Father Juan be cussed," roared Benventuro. - "I look no  more like him than the man in the moon. If/you are a Catho-  lie you shall do penance for this."              "My dear friend," I said, hastening down stairs, and interpos- ing, "this shower-bath was not intended for you, but for your worst enemy, Father Juan, cwho has bothered us greatly to-night by his presence. You will forgive this gentleman, when I tell you that he has a great respect for you, and that he is the owner of a dozen bottles of champagne of the green seal." (Are the bottles in this house?" demanded the priest, ea- gerly.  ,    *        1 fiS FATHER BENVENTURO  .

This afternoon I could wait no longer, and after I had finished a few games of cock-fihting, by which I won a couple of ounces, -the saints be praised for my luck, for my birds have acted confounded bad lately, - I left Santa Mesa for the pur- pose of seeing Alleu, and making him accompany me. He did so, but it was loun past dark Vbfore we got started, and we had one or two miserable sinners to talk with after we landed." "Pretty girls, he means," muttered Alien. "You are both welcome," I said, once more shaking hands with them, and introducipn Tom in due form, and after another hearty laugh at the drenching which the priest had received, the latter's eyes suddenly rested upon Catalina and Margarita. "May the saints preserve us -but what havewe- here? Two live women, and handsome at that. What would Donna Teresa say if she should hear of this?"  y She has already heard of it, and has expressed her disappro- bation," cried Teresa, suddenly making her appearance.  "Donna Teresa!" exclaimed the priest, in astonishment, hard- ly able to believe the evidence of his senses. "Donna Teresa I " re-echoed Alien, grasping a bottle of cham- pagne for support, and in a moment of abstraction, filling his glass and emptying it at a breath. "Yes, gentlemen," the lady replied, "I am Donna Teresa, and Came here to-night to show your friend that his duplicity is ex- posed, and that he cannot deceive me with false vowivs."  "O, d-," muttered the priest, with a furious look at me; ".you have ruined everything by your Imprudence."   166       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.  "Now you are in for it, sure enough," was the consoling remark;  of Alien, handdin, the priest a glass of wine, and helping himself at the same time.  The holy father gulped down his winewithout a groan, and its flavor was so good that it restored the equanimnity of his tem-  per immediately. He did not smile, but he held out his glass for  more of the sparkling beverage, and it was promptly supplied.  "Senora," he said, "I have seen so much of life that I have  resolved not to condemn a man without a hearing; The practice  is a good one, and I recommend all to follow it. No doubt Guil-  lermo can explain a few things, which now look dartk, to your  satisfaction. Speak, Guillermo, and put the hearts of your friends  at rest." "I amjbut entertaining Senor Baker, and two respectable la- dies of his acquaintance," I replied, bold as brass. A cloud passed from the fat face of Benventuro, and he seemed to comprehend the position of affairs immediately. "Why did you not mention in your letter of invitation that you were to have ladies for company?" the priest demanded, turning to me. "My letter?"I stammered. "Yes, sir; your letter invitinDg me to supper. Stay; I have it here." He searched his pockets without success. "Ah, I recollect. I left it at the convent. But it's io matter. Had it not been for a siclk man whom I was called upon to visit, I should have been here earlier, and this scene would have been avoided. Senora, banish all jealousy, for Guilleriio is ar idjuled - man, and I believe a pure one." "IWhat a story!" muttered Allen, in English, with another at- tack upon the champagne, which Tom joined in most heartily. tI have already forgiven Guillermo," Teresa said, extending her hand, which I seized upon with avidity; "but still I should like a few bad impressions removed." The priest's eyes spalrklled with joy and champagne. He saw that his ambitious hopes were still within the bounds of possi- bility, and that there was a prospect of triumphing over his rival, Father Juan. He paused a moment to recover his composure, and then exclaimed, - t Let me be the peace-maker, and it's lucky that I am here to   BENVENTURO EXPLAINS.        167 render assistance to those I love, and who love me. Guiller- mo invited his friend here to supper; the latter invited his be- trothed and her firiend.

That was both rihllt and proper, and I should have done the same, if I had known my friend was likely to forget himself as a gentleman and a lover. Here are the young girls, who feel hurt at your suspi- cions; and here is the young gentleman who is to marry one of them. Ask him if what I have stated is not correct. I have but your happiness at heart, and" (the priest glanced towards the ta- ble, and saw that Allen and Tom were imbibing wine at a rapid -rate, and he feared that he would lose his share. I-e scowled at them in a fr-ightful manner, and then continued to speak to Donna Teresa, who was -perfectly willing to listen as long as my faults were being glossed over) " would die to secure it. As long as I have known Guillermo, I am sure that you alone have possessed his thoughllts."  I felt a slight pressure from the hand which I held, and rejoiced that the battle was nearly over. I did not approve of the course which the priest had taken to reinstate me in Teresa's affection; but if I had contradicted or interrupted him, I should have lost his support, and gained a powerful enemy. t They tell mne," said Teresa, gliding across the room to where Tom sat, "L that I have wronged you. I pray you to forgive me, and believe it was done unintentionally." Poor Tom, with all his New York experience, was not pre-  pared for the apology, so he could only struggle to his feet and 1 stammer out a few words. (' Don't say a word about it, I beg of you," he exclaimed. " I am sorry that there's been any misunderstanding, and think that the best thing you can do is to make it up the way that we do in York." As Tom's remarks were made in English, - for he was too agi- tated to speak Spanish,- it is supposed that the lady wasnot much enlightened until an interpretation took place. Teresa smiled  168       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. most sweetly upon the New Yorker, and that'simple act almost turned his brain. "I understand that one of these ladies is betrothed to you. Will you present me to her, so that I can explain llwhy I am here?"  ' Why, the fact of it is," Tom stammered, "I think some of marriage. All men do, you know; but I have--" '( He means, senora," interrupted the priest, " that lhe has not yet decided on the day, and that he will let you know when he has." Alien hit Tom a powerful kick on his shin, under the table, and while he was rubbing his foot the priest stepped in and resumed the conversation. "Perhaps the lady will be more communicative," Teresa said, glancing towards the two girls, who evidently wished that they were some dlistance from the house. "Let the one who is to marry this gentleman be presented to me. I should be pleased to know her." "Marry me!" echoed Tom, regardless of the priest's secret signs. "Blast it, we don't do things in that way inl York, I can tell you." . "Will you be silent?" asked Allen, lifting Tom's glass. "Silent as you please; but a fellow can't be married in a mo- ment, you know, even to oblige a friend." "There is no occasion, if you will remain quiet for a moment. Things are working, all righlt. Drink, and pay no attention what- ever to what is passing."  Tom accepted Allen's advice; but he did it rather reluctantly, for every few minutes he, would mutter, "Wlat would the gov- ernor say, if I should carry home a Spanish wife?" Donna Teresa, who had now' assumed one of her most amiable moods, was about to advance towards Catalina and Margarita, when the priest interposed. "Gently, daughter, gently. Remember that you are a hilih- born Spanish lady, of wealth and position, and that these "irls have mixed blood in their veins. You cannot associate with a Mestiza, for they are an inferior race. They do not expect it. On the day of her wedding send her a present, and that will be a  sufficient acknowledgment of your good will." Teresa stopped and looked at me for advice. I saw that the   ALL SERENE.           169 words of the priest had roused her Spanish pride, and therefore I adopted his suggestions. "4 You are right, Guillermo; but- I will no longer embarrass them with my presence. Let us retire to the next room, so they can eat their supper with your friends without restraint." C"But what are we to do for something to eat?" cried the priest, in the greatest alarm for his inner man. 'lWhy, we three can sup together in the sitting-room. There is enough for all, and it shall be divided. Thanks to the hot climate, the food is as warm as when put upon the table,", I said, hastily; and before Douna Teresa could offer any serious objections, the priest had escorted her to the apartment desig- nated.                 I explained to Alien and Toni the nature of the bargain, and then called the servants to carry it into effect, and in an incredi- bly short time the priest had spread his legs beneath the mahoga- ny; an expression of extreme satisfaction passed over his visagei which a few glasses of wine helped' to improve. "Guillermo," he said, " let the mnuchacho open another bottle. For all the favors we receive in this world, the saints be praiseld. While we live life is worth enjoying. You have both seen trou- ble, and will be better suited to each other for the little afflictions cast in your path. The saints be praised that you have withstood persecution. Give me another glass of wine, and the breast of/ a chicken, unless the senora wants it." The lady disclaimed any inclination for the dainty morsel, and the holy father viewed it with a sigh of satisfaction. "Another spoonful of the curry, if you please, and a portion of the calabash.  That is sufficient. My feelings have been so excited this evening, that I have not the slightest appetite; be- sides, I ate supper at Senor Allen's, and a most, bountiful one it was. Don't let my abstinence, senora, prevent you from picking a wing, however, for the hour is late, and an empty stomach is an evil in this climate. The saints be praised, my digestion is still good." Teresa felt like myself, and was too busy with her thoughts to care for the pleasures of the table; but our abstinence had no ef- feet on the pritst. He drank, ate, and talked with a freedom which only long practice could have enabled him to do. "Guillermo," asked Teresae, why didn't you remain in my box   170,       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. longer this evening, when yon must have known that I visited the theatre solely for the purpose of seeing you?" "Simply because I had no desire to share the pleasure of your i conversation with Captain Francisco, who, I thoughts was too at- tentive for a mere acquaintance."             , "I have known him for a number of years," she said; '-but he is only an acquaintance, and not a friend. Of him you have no need of a particle of jealousy."  Jealousy!" echoed the priest; 6 why, jealousy is one of the best passions in the human heart, because it makes men more attentive to their wives, and women more constant to their hus-  bands., Without jealousy there is no love; and were I a girl I would banish from my presence a lover who could look on un- moved, and see me flirt with every good-looking man who chose to devote a portion of his time for my entertainment. Yes, se- nora; let Guillermo cultivate his jealousy, for 'tis a plant that will keep his passion alive, and prevent you pining for his society. Be Jealous, both of you. It may cause a- few angry words and looks. but-will also cause many pleasant ones. When you cease to be jealous, you have reason to fear your love haos (departed." "I feared that Guillermo's had gone many weeks sinice," Te- resa said, in a hesitating tone, and with a iblush. I was about to utter a hundred protestations to the contrary, when the priest interrupted me. ' You don't half understand his nature," the padre said. The r hearts of the North Americans are not as inflammable as our own; but when once the tinder has caught, the fire is not easily'extin- guished. It will smoulder for years, but not entirely die out. Guil- lermo loves you now with as much devotion as ever, and will love you ten years hence equally well. Thlat surely should con- tent you." "I am  content," she whispered, laying her hand upon mine, and giving me one of her old trusting' looks, which set my heart fluttering like a ship's colors on a gala day. ( Did I not tell you," the priest continued, still addressing Te- resa, s' the very last day that you were at the convent, and every time that I have seen you since, that you must beware of tradu- cers, who whuld seek to prejudice your mind against your lover. Of course I told you so, and mny predictions have come true."   A SUDDEN WEDDING.         171 "I could n6t help feeling a. I did," Teresa whispered, still re- taining her hold of my hand. (' Neither could Gaillermo. You both felt jealous. That was natural enough, but you should have asked for an explanation. Hand me that other bottle of wine, for I feel as thirsty as though I had said mass, and attended a dozen or more cock-fights." The boy who was in attendance hastened to comply with the order, and after the padre had emptied his glass, he again spoke:- "After you are married (here Teresa blushed - women al- ways blush when you talk to them of marriage), you must have more confidence in each other, or the result will be unhappi- ness. Be true to each other, my children, and the saints will provide for you." "You speak," I said, laughing, "' as though we were really to be married; yet I have not heard the first word from Teresa on that important subject for the past two months." ("And I can safely say that during that period Guillermo has been equally as silent as myself," Teresa exclaimed. "AAh, I see," muttered the priest; " he has been standing on his dignity, and -for that *would sacrifice his happiness and interest, and the welfare of those connected with him. That wo n't do. You love each other dearly, and no reverse of fortune should in- terfere to separate you. I will imagine that I was called upon to unite you," the priest continued, stepping to the door and speaking so that those in the other apartment could hear him; "I should tell you to kneel before me." To my surprise Teresa knelt upon the floor, still retaining my hand as though she desired me to take my place beside her. I did so, and when I looked up saw Tom, Allen, and the girls gazing at us from the adoor with sedate faces. I heard the padre mutter a hurried prayer in Latin, and then he spoke in Spanish: - "In the name 9 ,God and the holy saints, 1, Benventuro, priest of the convent of St. Pedlxo, by the power invested in me by the Archbishop of Manila, do hereby pronounce you, Guillermo , and you, Teresa Arturo Engracio, both being of lawful ages, and free to act, man and wife; and may the saints have you in their keeping, and your days be happy." "Amen!" cried the crowd at the door, with wonderful una- nimity,   172       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. CHAPTER VII.  A, SURPRISED HUSBAND. -A COOL PRIEST.- AN EXPLANATION. SCARCELY had the priest concluded the last words of hiis cere- mony, when I began to suspect the trick which he had played us, and sprang to my feet, indignant at his duplicity, and anxious to show my friends that the wedding was not by my con- nivance. "Priest," I said, " was the ceremony which you just performed a farce or a reality?" "As real as I could make it in the absence of an altar, lights, and assistants," he answered, quite coolly, extending his hand to congratulate me. "And am I really- married?' I demanded, my blood boiling, and my senses in a whirl at the novelty of my situation. "All the lawyers in the country cannot prove that you are not married," was the reply. "Teresa," I exclaimed, throwing myself at her feet, "I love you dearly, but I did not suspect that we were to be made the victims of a trick, or I should have scorned to obtain your hand in this manner. Will you acquit me of all connivance in the *matter?.  Her hands were before her face, and I could see tears stealing ! from between her fingers. Gently I removed her hands, and kissed the tears from her long eyelashes; and then her head fell upon my shoulder, and she whispered, - "Perhaps you never desired to marry me, Guillermo." "May the saints pardon you for that thought, darlingcr," I ex- claimed, beginning to think that the priest had not made such a great mistake, after all, and that, if the lady was satisfied, there was but little reason why I should complain. (' And you imagine that you love me just as much now as ever you did?"Teresa asked, hesitatingly. - "More than ever," I whispered.  ^LLVL                      -EL tl   173    . ANI OFFER RIEFUSED. "Then why should we complain, except for the absence of friends to congratulate us?" "Don't be foolish and ruin the best day's work that you ever saw performed. If you love the lady, be satisfied, for I am sure that she seems to love you," Allen whispered in English; and even Tom came forward and offered congratulations for the sur- prise which we had afforded him. " It was the suddenest thing that I ever saw," Tom cried, wringing my hand until it ached. t' I don't believe that it could have been done better even il- New York. And what a difference between this old feller and the other old vinegar cock! Why, this one can put a glass of wine out of sight in less than no time, and it seems to do him good. W5ine like mine is not thrown away upon him, for I can tell by the smack of his lips that he knows what is what." ' " Teresa," I said, leading her to a distant part of the room,  will not take advantage of the trick which united us, for I love you too well to see you wronued. I offer you your freedom again, and never by word or look shall you know from me that we have been married. .This I must do as a man of honor; and if you accept of the offer, I shall still cherish the hope of one day calling you mine, but in the presence of a more brilliant company- than we see to-night." "' Guillermo," she said, laying her hand upon mine, and bring- ing her sweet lips in close proximity to my face, " if I thought that my happiness was not sure in your keeping, I should repudi- ate the ceremony that has just been performed, and renounce you. But I know," she continued with all the candor of a Spanish girl, " that I love you, and that you love me; and as we expected to be married some day, I don't feel much grieved at what has passed. Do you, my husband?" How could I reply except to fold her in my arms, and to kiss her again and again, and to vow that I would remain true and' loving until death.       I  " Well," cried the priest, wCho had been quieting his conscience , by repeated attacks upon the 4 'reen seal,' " what conclusion have you come to, senor ? Do you intend to introduce us to your wife, or to Donna Teresa Arturo?" " My wife, senors," I said, as proud of her beauty and accom- plishments as bridegroom could well be,  174       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. I led her forward, blushing and clinging to my arm, happy, yet embarrassed at the novelty of her situation, aid looking so very beautiful that Tom gave vent to a groan of envy as he surveyed her features. "What a sensation she would make in York!" he exclaimed;  and then found consolation in the wine ; but his generosity over- powered his envy, and he rushed back and shook my hand, and bowed to the lady with all the grace of -a man of the world. He was about. to leave us, when he suddenly stopped, and looked around lthe apartment with ludicrous surprise. Even the priest released the bottle which lie held in his hand, and listened with pallid face, while my wife clunga to me with terror, and rested her head upon my breast, as though sure of finding protection within my arms. There was a roaring sound in' the streetrand I could hear a rush as thouwgh torrents of water were sweeping by the house; and then came a tremendous shock, that nearly threw us to the floor, while huge pieces of plastering and wood-work fell around us, barely clearing our heads. The glasses upon the table danced to and fro as though enjoying a quadrille or polka.. For about fifteen seconds the commotion continued, during which time not I a word was spoken by those present, although there were many  cries in the street, and a dozen voices in the houses opposite uttered a shrill yells of    -. ' El terremoto! El terremoto t May the saints preserve us." "What in the devil's name is el terremoto?." demanded Tom, drawing a long breath. "Earthquake," replied Allen, with admirable composure; t and unless we get out of this confounded city, we shall be fifty feet under water 'before daylight." "I've never seen the operations of an earthqualke," Tom said, quite coolly, ( "although I've run to fires in New York; and they ain't slow for fun and destruction. Let's drink to the ' terremoto,' as you call it, and pray that we shall have another shock."' " You had better pray to Heaven to forgiv-e your sins, for you may not have an opportunity presently," replied Allen, grimly; but Tom  was unacquainted with the danger, and therefore scorned it. "Let her rip!" le shouted, cracking the neck of a bottle of champagne, and drinking the foaming liquor as unconcerned as   175  THE EARTHQUAKE. though all danger was passed. "I suppose that the earthquake wants a drink of this good liquor, but it must gape amazing quick, or it will all be gone. Who will join me? , Mav  the saints forgive me," was the muttered ejaculation of the priest, who seemed to have lost his usual presence of minP in consequence of the midnight visitor; Had I been alone, I should not have feared for the result, un- certain as it was; but I had a wife. to save, and I felt that I would sooner perish than aught should' happen to her. I re-- membered that once before, when I first made her acquaintance, I had saved I er life and her husband's also; but now that she belonged to me, and her warm love was all my own, I felt my arms strengtheneed, and my heart, which had first trembled at the shock, grew firm and resolute, as I held the lady in my arms, and pressed her to my breast. "' Guillermo, my husband" she exclaimed, in low tones, C" save your own life by instant flight. Do not think of me, for I shall only encumber your movements. Go while you can, and before the waters of the bay and river cut off all retreat. One kiss, and then leave me."' She got a kiss and a stronaer embrace than she ever had re- ceived in her life; but I scorned her self-sacrificing proposal, and it's prolbable that she knew I would, for a glad smile passed over her face', arid she returned kiss for kiss, and her arnms grew tighter around my neck, as though she intended they should remain there, even if the building fell and crushed us. "We will be saved together, or perish together," I whispered. "Well," asked Allen, " what are we to do? Stand and look at each other, and await another shock, or escape.?" '"Escape by all means," I replied. "That is the first sensible word that you have said this hour," was the coplimenetary response. Of course he had not heard one half the endearing expressions I had addressed to my wife; therefore I didn't consider that he was a judge. 6' How shall we go? by banco or carriage? for of course we must travel to Santa Mesa for safety," Allen asked. ' By carriage, if we can procure one. :y horses are in the stable." ^"And my carriage stands at the door," cried Donna Teresa;- "we can take that."   176       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.  Alien rushed to the .window, and. looked into the street. The coachman had taken advantage of the first alarm, and driven off, although Allen did not seem discouraged at the information. ' We shall have to take your carriage and horses, if we can  get them out in time," he said, mildly. "Will they go in two-forty?" asked Tom, who stuck as close to the table as possible, and who had succeeded in getting Father Benveuturo to join him; and the way they were making wine dis- appear would have delighted a wholesale liquor dealer. Allen sprang to the stairs leading to the court-yard, for the purpose of finding the servants, and giving directions to the coach- man; but he speedily returned. "The outer doors are open, and'not a servant is to be seen," he said. The cowards had fled at the first intimation of the earthquake,  and cared not whether we perished or survived. "Save yourself, and leave me," my wife said; but I stopped  her mouth with a kiss.    "What is to be done?" Allen asked. "We must harness the animals ourselves," I replied. "Let me drive!" exclaimed Tom, suddenly starting from the  table, and spreading his hands as though urging a fast horse at a  killing pace.                 .       ; "You can help us if you will," I replied, as I led Teresa X towards the staircase, close upon the heels of Alien.     ' You shall have all the help that I can give you," was my i friend's response, grasping the priest by his arm, and accompany-;  ing him to the istairs,; at the same time he uttered a few en- couraging remarks well calculated to steady the nerves of the padre.                            r "If you can't lget up a better specimen of an earthquake than [ this," said Tom, "I shall call 'em hulmbugs, and won't patronize ; 'em again.

"They are wild with fright, and it'sdoubtful if they can be harnessed." . 12   178       LIFE IN THE EAST NDIES. I was' about to consign Teresa to the care of Tom, when the latter volunteered to go and assist. I don't know that I ever attempted to harness a horse but I succeeded," he said; " so I guess I'll give -your animals a trial." He cast one regretful look at his patent-leather boots, and then waded through the water to the stable, where Allen was at work. Again did the bell of St. Pedro peal forth its warning, and again was there a rush of water through tlte streets'; and now I could hear the voices of people in bancos as they sought to escape by their boats to high land, or where falling buildings would not crush them to death. c' These blasted horses won't stand still," shouted Tom from the stable. " They do nothing but snuff at us and kick. Come and help us." " Go, my husband," Teresa urged; " I will remain here until you return." I hesitated a moment, and then seated Teresa upon the steps, and dashed through the water to the stable.' "What kind of cussed horses do you call these?" asked Tom; but hardly had he spoken the words, when the buildings began to rock back and forth, the earth to tremble and groan, and the wind sighed as it swept through the court.  " Let her rip," yelled Tom, releasing the horses, and plunging into the water. I heard a scream, and thought that it sounded like Teresa's voice. For a few minutes I was so mixed up with the horses, that I could not leave the stable without danger of broken limbs; but the instant that I could escape I rushed past Tomn and Allen to the spot where I had left my wife, but she wvas no longer there. The shock of the earthquake had passed away by the time that I reached the steps, so that I had no longer any fear of being crushed by falling walls and timbers; yet when I found that my wife was absent, I thought for a moment that she had taken refuge in the house through fright at hearing the earth groan, and the water dash wildly about the court-yard. I called her by name, but she returned no answer; and at length I sprang up the steps and reached the dining-room. The table still stood there, but half the dishes whichl were upon it when we left the revel, were   R; JPa(3U   J6 - sattered about the floor in wild confusion. The lamps alone ^remaiined u   ndisturbed,  owing to their peculiar flat shape and. I glaned hastily around the rooma in hope of seeing my wife; but no such agreeable sight met my eyes, and I passed to the next apartment,  fronting the street. Still I did not find the one I sought, and I began to have sad fancies respecting her disappear- aue. M  voice trembled as I called her name, but there was no response. There were but three other rooms in the house, my bed-elamer and a spare chamber next to it, and the room used by the  servants. For a m oment I  thought that she might be in my apartment, and my heart grew light at the idea; buta mo- men  u was su.ffiient to dispel  tilhe illusion. The rooms were not destined"to shelter so much loveliness on that eventful night; and sick at heart, and with a feeling that some dreadful calamity had happened to Teresa, I retraced my steps to the court-yard, where Alle~ and Tom were standing, the water dripping from their clotes, and  r thei r whole apearauce not very inviting, after their bath in frount of  the stable. " Where's Douna   Teresa? " asked  Allen, who: saw  that I was,; in search of some one, and  that I was unusually excited. ' I left her but a mnoment since to assist you with the horses, and when I returned she had disappeared. Help me in my search, for she may still be in the court-yard, half dead with terror, I replied. " You should not have left her for a mornaW" was the consol- in respose of Allen; but although he grumbled at what le con- sidered my carelessness, he nevertheless was alive to my great loss, and did not waste a moment in joining 1e in the search. We procured lights and looked through   the court-yard roost, thoroughly, and in every building; but still wve found no trace of the lady; and I began to feel all the despair of a manl and a lover at my loss. I sat down on, the steps, and could have sied tears, but I feared to let my companions witness my grief and weak. "This is devilish mysterious," Tom said, at length ;. "ana begau to think that 1anile ain't such a slow place, after all, aud in some respects can equlM New York." ' I started towards the street without any deanitc plan, but be' fore I could reach the gateAllen had overtaken me.    M10U .LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.  ' What do you propose to do, and Nowhere do you think of searchl ing at this hour of the night ? "he asked. " I know not; the saints will direct my steps," I answered. "I don't believe but his mind is wandering,"  I heard Tom whisper to Allen; " and I think a good proof of it is shown by his calling upon the saints. I never heard ~him mention them " Hush !"  Allen replied, in the same low  tone; ' don't make sport of his grief, for the poor fellow will suffer enough before he ever sees his wife again."      -  -- "You must not commence the search now, my dear friend," Allen continued addressing me in the most soothing manner ' because the streets are filled with water, and there is not a banuco to b  e seen. They  have all g one  up the river with passengers, and will not return until danger is past." . I  saw that it was madness to think of searching through tlhe dark  stireets; but still I was reluctant to yield, and  only by Al- len's persuasion did I consent to return to the hlouse, and wait until the water subsided, and daylighl:t appeared. The first thing that Tom looked after was the pine, which was uninjured, while some half dozen bottles still reposed! on the bal cony, wrapped in wet cloths for the purpose of cooling their con- tents. One of the bottles was quickly opened, the broken dishes  pushed one side, and goblets filled to the brim. "Here," said Tom, hlandingr me a  glass of the sparkling bever- age, " is something that will cheer your heart, and  make you for- get your great misfortune. Drinlk, and hope for better drays." t I felt so entirely depressed in spirit, that I dial not refuse t!he invitation, and tile wine inspired mae with hope and confidence that  all would yet end wvell.  " I can't say  that this resembles a very happy wedding; " Tom  s continued, ", but still I think that things mnight be worse. For  instance, if the grumbulinlg old earthquake lind rattled the house  down almost our earls and buried us twenty feet deep with rub-  b/s/l , our firiends W ouh dn't have knowln us when a  patty of M~ sia' ] dtl u ou i th mruil,, and-.picked our  pock~ets in the bargain.? Cheer up, old fellow, and have anothler drink of wine. A1-0 ways look at   the brightest side of huma'n life, 'cos the other part li~ is black enlugh, I expect, to suit the most fastidious lover of thee sombre."    ALTLEJ VENT"URES- AN OPINION.    181 Allen and myself remained in deep thoughlt while Tom rattled off his homilies, and perhaps he imagined that we were compli- menting him for his flow of words, for he talked on every subject that he thought was interesting; nor did he forget to express his private opinion respecting the conduct of Catalina and Margarita in deserting him without saying good night-an omission that he took very much to heart. " I've hit it! " said Allen,' suddenly, starting up. ' "Hit what ? " demanded Tom, in astonishment, looking round the room for an enemy with a broken head. ' Why, the manner in which Donna Teresa has disappeared." "( Then I should advise you to hit the parties who carried her off. But let us hear what you have to say on the subject, and if one bottle of champagne can throw light on title matter, what may we not expect by the time two are drank ?"        - I motioned to Allen to continue his remarks, for I knew his ability for investigation, and had confidence in his judgment. " The lady never left those steps willinglye" said Allen, after a pause; " and to speak candidly, I thought I heard a female scream while we were busy with the horses; but I supposed that the sound came from the street~ and that some woman was calling upon the saints to save her from a violent death. Screams-are so common during the continuance of a shock~ that they excite but little attention; but you will never make me believe that Donna Teresa would have been so alarmed as to forget her husband and rush into the street, and taike refuige on board a passing banco. There was force used, and quick work they made of it, or rm much mistaken." " But who are the parties who would dare to commit such an outrage ? i' I demanded. " That question time will answer; but at present I cannot. She may have been kidnapped by Mestizas, anxious for a large re- ward, or her late husband's relatives, fearful that she was about to bestow her hand and fortune upon a foreigner and la heretic, or, worse than a-!, the holy Father Juan may have had a hand in the matter, and if he did, our work will be long and arduous before we ever see the light of her handsome face again. Of one things however, we must be careful."  "Well, what is it? " asked Tom, cutting the wire of a cham- pagne bottle.   182       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. Before he had tilme to reply, we heard a. footstep on the stairs. Not a light, elastic step, like a lady's, but a heavy one, as though the body which it bore was wearied with toil.' Thinking that some one had arriyed with news from my wife, I rushed to the staircase, -and saw Father Benventuro toilingf up the steps, his robes -covered with imud and water, and his peculiar-shaped hat looking as though it had been iused for a paddle to guide a banco through the streets. , "Father Benventuro!"I exclaimed in astonishment. '"Yes, son, what there is of me--a mixture of mud, water, and a little weak'"flesh- The-saints forgive me, and all here; but had I not heard that cork fly from the champagne bottle, I should have dropped in the court-yard from weariness. You have not emptied the bottle, I hope. If you have, my curse shall be upon you."                     . Tom snatched a full goblet of the wine from the table, and held it to the padre's mouth. He drained the glass at a breath, and then sighed because it was empty. ", A thlousand thanls," he said. "The curse shall be changed to a blessing, and prayers for your welfare, provided, of course, you can find me a bit to cat, and a few more drops of something to drink."           .    . "Water, of course, you mean," Allen said, pretending to pour ? some of that fluid from a decanter.    .  Avaunt, thlou scoffir!"'cried the padre, in melodramatic style. "Look at me and see if I have not had water enough to last me a lifetime. Whajt was it ever made for except to drown unbe- lievers? and I tell you that one of the faithful came neaM sharing -a heretic's fate this night." "Have you seen-" " At ny emotion the priest looked up astonished. "You're a smart bridegroom," he said. "Why in the name of the saints ain't you abed and asleep, as every wellconducted husband should be, on his wedding night? You didn't let the shock of a petty earthquake destroy your nuptial happiness? or, ! have you and your wife quarrelled so soon? and did she turn you out of the room to feast with these revellers?" I gave the padre a brief account of the disappearance of Te- resa, and he listened to the recital in breathless astonishment. "' More of that, cussed Jesuit's work, he muttered," as I con-   CONSULTATIONS. eluded; and then he began to ponder on what had been told him, his meditations only interrupted by sighs. ,' Well," said Allen, " do you intend sitting there like a blessed old elephant, and do nothing but mumble and groan, and shake your head as thouogh there was something in it. If you can en- ligl1ten us, do so, for you look as mysterious as a Chinaman in a Jotss house, or a woman possessed of a secret." ' My dear children," Benventuro replied, "I think that I can account for the disappearance of Donna Teresa in a most satis- factory manner ; for did you not tell me that the holy Father Juan, whose devotion to his own interests is unparalleled in the annals of the church, has hovered around here this 'night, and even ac- companied the lady to this house for the sake of breaking off a match that was sure to lessen his influence, and destroy a project- that he has long cherished? Now, if Father Juan has been here, and was compelled to leave the premises contrary to his will, you may rest assured that Father Juan was concerned in the lady's disappearance. "Impossible!"I cried; "the priest would not have dared com- - mit such an outrage."  , "My son," replied the padre, with the faintest possible smile of contempt, " you little know what a Jesuit is capable of doing, when prompted by malice and a desire for revrenge. Father Juan is a good man, but he sometimes acts hastily." "If he has dared to lay violent hands upon Teresa," I ex- claimed, " he shall suffer for it most dearly, even if I have to penetrate the walls of his'convent, and tear him from an altar." "Hear the man I " cried the priest, with a contemptuous laugh, which instantly-disappeared when he thought how closely we were bound together. "That is a fair specimenr of American bragga- docio, and I suppose, if I Was not here to guide and direct you, that you would butt your head against every stone wall in Manila, and then cry at the wrounds inflicted. It is not the way we people in Manila conduct business, because we have a more sure and perfect'method of accomplishing our ends." ' And pray how is that?"I asked, with a slight sneer, as a recompense for his smile of contempt. '"You will have to wait for- events, that's certain," replied the padre; "but I don't counsel idleness. You must work, but in;   184       -LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. secret. Let me have a glass of wine, and I'll explain a little more fully." The wine was passed to him, and the good man was careful to help himself largely, and then to forget fo return the bottle. ie continued:-       , "If you complained to the captain general that you were mar- ried to the richest heiress in the city, and without his consent, it's quite probable that he would rejoice at'the disappearance of the lady; for the count-is jealous of his power, and would fear that you might take occasion to remove your wife's wealth from the island as soon as possible. That, I need not tell you, is a matter which concerns him deeply. Again, if you should hint that I performed the ceremony, it's probable that your friend would be stripped of his robe of office, and pass a few of his days in a place where a man has to diet or starve. That portion of the pro- gramme I should object to decidedly, because I am not calculated to live on bread and water, and fresh air and sunshine are so very pleasant. The only thing that I have to rely upon is the favor of the archbishop, and he' must have weighty reasons for standing between me and executive wrath. You understand me, I suppose, for I can't be very explicit, under the circumstances. We must make the best of the affair, and find out where the lady is concealed, and then use craft to recover her. This I am don- fident we can do if we are careful, and use our mother wit to ad- vantage. But there must be no outcry and confusion, or our search will be delayed." ' But why can't we present ourselves at the convent of St. Se- bastian, and demand the lady?"I asked. "Because she is not there, and indeed we don't know that Father Juan was concerned in her removal. If he has her, he has her safe under lock and key; but I don't think he would be likely to take her to the convent. It don't seem to me to be Jesuitish enough. He is as cunning as a fox, and knows how to work with but little noise. It's quite probable that he waited near the house, after he was excluded, watched the whole of your opera- tions, and when he saw that Donna Teresa was left alone, he hailed a passing banco, and hired the Mestizo to assist him to re- move her as speedily as possible. While the earthquake lasted, she would be half dead with fright, and be incapable of offering much resistance. And while I am speaking on the subject, I   RETURN   OF T H RUNAWAYS,0  am inclined to thin k the very banco tha t brought me here are eresa away; for the fellows grumbled w hen I recompensed them ":  with m y blessing, and said that a priest h ad paid them liberally for half an hou r's worl.

' Tblen our best plan ism'to find the btnco men, who brought you here, and see if your surmises are correct. A bribe will open their mouths, even if Fatler Juan has ordered  them closed. An ounce of gold possesses rare attatio s for a estizo," Allen said. Before th  ere was a-cllanee for further remarks, my cook,look- in o as though he had been ducked iaa horse-pond, made his ap- pearance, and close behind hilh followed m y boy.

No"w, the truth of the matter is," the priest exclaimed, " these vagabonds left the house at the first shock, and they thought of none but tihemselves, and I doubt if they stopped unninguntl they reached the road leading to Santa Mesa. I should discharge them for lying.  "In the name of the saints, don't do that," exclaimed the ser- vants in alarm; " we have been very faithfhl to our master, an Stole nnothing.

Of course I don't demand it; but think of thie danaers I shall be exposed to in working for your rood. -- Five thousand dollars is not much for one like you, who will be worth more than a million." "Find my wife, and you shall have no cause to grumble," I said, evading the main question; but the priest seemed satisfied and shook my hand with renewed good feeling. I was about to tulrn away, when my companion detained me. You must go to the residence of Donna Teresa this morning, and make inquiries regarding her. She has an aunt, you know who takes charge of her house and affairs while absent. Asrk the old lady if she has heard of her niece, and plretend that Donna Teresa disappeared in a mysterious manner; but don't mention Father Juan's name- on any account, for we know not whom to trust. Be as unconcerned as possible, and appear as thouwh it was merely a whim of the lady to be thus absent. You under- stand me?" I nodded an affirmative answer. "Then go and take your morning bath while the coffee is pre- paring, and be sure to erase those lines of care which I see upon your face.  Dress gayly, and report to us the result as soon as possible." I followed the priest's advice, and bythe time Ihad bathed and' dressed, the coffee was ready, and its strength 'and exhila- rating qualities were quite acceptable, after the night of aitation and distress which I had undergone. While Alien, Tom, and the padlre threw  their forms upon lounges, for the purpose of obtaining a little repose, I left the house, and wended my way toivards the splendid residence of Donna Teresa.   It was situated upon the left bank of the Pasi, just above the bridge, and on the Biroudo side; for her husband, when alive, had an eye to money, arcd as he was largely engaged  in commerce, he could not carry on his contracts very readily without free access to his agents at all hours, day and night For that reason he had built and furnished a house on the trading side of the city, some distance from the aristocratic part of Manila, which is surrounded by walls and draw-bridgres, and is strongly fortified. In Manila proper no foreigner can reside, or even sleep, without permission of the governor general; and at eleven at night up go the draw-bridges, and all communication with the   l  t8 DONNA TERESA'S  IOUSE.       187 uter world is cut off until sunrise the next day. Of course such estrictions would interfere with the avocations of a merchant, and )on Arturo had wisely turned his back upon the aristocracy for 'le sake of adding to his wealth; and by the act hle had not lost oste, as might have been expected, but had retained his position ip to the time of his death. Much of his influence, however, was jue to his wife, whose pure blood was acknowledged even by the itled rulers of the island. Tle house of Donna Teresa was slurrounled by a high wall, which also enclosed a garden beautifully laid out with walks and arbors. All the fruit trees indigeenous to the country were to be Sound in the garden, bearing their rich burdens every month in the year; and as fast as one variety of fruit was plucked from a ;ree, a fresh supply of blossoms would appear, and quickly arrive t maturity. The mang-o, one of the most delicious fruits that grow in the East, was there found in profusion, and in a state of perfection; oranges were more famous for quality than. their quantity, and grew to an enormous size, and were the envy of every gardener in Manila. In fact, the garden was more like a miniature paradise, in beauty, than any earthly abode; and so I used to regard it when I had my Eve, in the person of Donna Teresa, by mly side. I reached the court-yard leading to Donna-Teresa's house. The old porter was standing at the entrance, smoking his paper cigar with an air of unconcern that led me to hope the lady was safe within her castle. "Good morning, senor," the old mran said, raising his hat with great respect; for I was a favorite of his by virtue of certain pieces of gold which I lhad given him at various times, and therefore he entertained an affection for mej because it was for his interest to do so;" the saints have you in their keeping." "Is Donna Teresa at home?"I aslked, with as firm a voice as possible. "She is not, senor. She left the house last evening for the theatre, and has not returned. Neiither has her carriage. It is probable that she drove to her country-seat at the conclusion of the performance. Wre have had a wretched night, senor; I have had no sleep, and one of my game cocks is dead. By the mass, I would not have ttaken two pesos for him." "Is Senora Raquel at home?"? I asked, meaning Teresa's aunt.   "FE IN THE EAST INDIES.  "She is at home, but it is. becanse she could not get away, By the saints, senorit was as much as I could do to hold her she kicked so when the earth shook. But the saints defend 'e. Here she comes, for I hear her voice." CHAPTER Nlll.             v TERESA'S AUNT.-H1ER IDEAS AND   CONFESSIONS.-HOW WE ITH SEARH PROCEEDED, AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT PEDRO!

"I don't. see what good there is in earthlquakes, when they don't swallow up those who make themselves generally disagreeable,"  the old man muttered, throwing away his cigar, and beginning to sweep the dirt from, the front of the yard. "O, you are here - are you?". the old lady asked, as she came in sight. "I suppose I might have  ereamed myself to death, and you. would take care, to answer onl at the last mornent. .

What does the'varlet mean?" she denianded, turning to me,  as though I had a hand in the matter.    A FEMALE SCOLD.          189 I could not reply, but nodded to Pedro to continue his defence. The fellow grew more confident', and retorted. ' Why, senora, when you lay upon your back, and kicked worse than the new carriage horse, I feared that you would injure or kill yourself; so I attempted to raise your body from the floor; but the saints pardon me, it was impossible, for your feet struck the pit of my stomach ten times [in a minute, and knocked the wind out of my body faster than it could enter. God be praised' that I am alive at the present time." i"Why, thou impudent varlet, I have a great desire to turn you into the street and have you beaten for falsehoods. This comes from associating with heretics. The saints- deliver us; but n wonder we have earthquakes anrd sickness. I'll speak to my niece of your boldness, and then we will see how you will deport yourself." "That is what I have made my appearance so early for," I said, breaking in upon her volubility. ' I desire also to speak with Donna Teresa." "Well, so do I, but I arn't,:' the old lady rejoined, rather tartly.  "She is not at home, then," I aid. "No, she is, not at home, anld  has not been here all night. There's pretty goings ou nowadays. I wonder what Don Ar- turo would say if he was alive. 'The poor man is dead and buried, and happy enough he ought to be when he thinks of his blessed condition. I am sure that I somletimes wish I was with the saints." Old Pedro took occasion to turn his back. and to express by his face , that he really wished the sa ints were encumbered with her.  "What women want to run after men for, and heretics at that, I can't see . You needn't tell me, I ain't blin d; although I p retend to be sometimes. I  can see what's g oing on as well as other folks, and let me tell you, I think it's a mean piece of busi- ness." Havin g thus emphatically delivered he r opini on, she looked me full in the face to see if I was annihilated; but fin ding that I was pot, she prepared f or another outhurst, but I interrupted her.  "Pardon me, senora," I said, quite calmly ;: :but I did not, come:'   190       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. here to argue with you on subjects of marriage or religion. I came in search of Donna Teresa." ' "And dare you tell me that you don't want her to marry you?" the old lady exclaimed. -' That question I am not bound to answer," I replied, with per. feet good nature. "But I know your motives; and let me tell you that sooner than marry a Protestant, I'd dig my eyes out." "My dear senora," I asked, 1" has any one been tampering with your virgin affections that you are so bitter?" "I am told, senor," cried Pedro, with a malicious grin, " that thirty years since a gay young Protestant laid siege to the senora's heart, and captured it, and that both were the envy of the young people in Manila, for their grace and beauty. It's but three days since my uncle was speaking of the matter, and wondering wheth- er Senora Raquel could dance the Bolero as gracefully as in former tinmes." The change that came over the withered and sour face of thie lady was vonderful to behold. Pedro had awakened recollec- tions of her youthful days, when her heart was sought by the young and brave, and when a wave of her band was su'fi- cient to drive away or collect a crowd of admirers. There was truth in the old porter's-words. She had loved an American, thirty years before, and if report spoke not false, he had loved her most devotedly. He proposed marriage, but she did not care to listen to the subject from one whose religion she had been l taught to despise. But love was more powerful than prejudice, and after a long suit the American obtained her solemn promise that she would consent to a secret union, and, that beth should then make, efforts to get some priest to solemnize the nuptials, as well-as the American consul, who was willing to do his part. Before the project was carried out, the American was attacked with that awful scourge in a warm climate, the small-pox, and died after a week's sickness. He was buried near Santa Mesa, at the senora's particular request, and regularly once a week for. many years she visited his grave, for her grief was terrible at his sudden death, and many months elapsed before she made her ap- pearance in society. That, of course, happened long before Te- resa was born, and when her first husband was comparatively a young man.   A WITHERED BEAUTY.         191 l She never married, altloulgh she had many brilliant offers before her beauty began to wither, and her temper grow harsh. There were times; however, when she liked to, talk of her young days, and express regret for the happiness that she had lost; and by Pedro's forethought he had struck the auspicious moment for opening the fountains of her memory, and altering her humor to a conciliatory one. ' I am changed, Pedro, I am' chaned," she said, with a smile; "and for many years I have not danced. There was a time when I could excel the belles of Manilaa, but that was many years since. The last time that I danced the Bolero was at the governor's palace, and his excellency was pleased to say that never in Spain did he seen anything- to equal it. I was young, then, Pedro; I was quite young." "'You speak as though you were old at the present time,"  said, feeling that she expected me to say something agreeable, "I know of many ladies who do not possess your elastic step and bright eyes, although they claim to have seen but sixteen summers." "It's quite probable, senror the girls are degeneratincg every year; and even my niece, Teresa, fair as you think her, will not possess my good looks by the time she's twenty years older. Beauty withers. Beauty withers. M- ore's the. pity." I had my private opinion on the subject, but I did not express it, for I desired the friendship of the lady, and was anxious to havd her assistance in the nmatter which I had in hand. 'I love young people," Raquel continued, "and love to see them happy; but they think that I'm cross and obstinate, and take no pains to secure my good will. .They call me an old maid, as though that was something criminal or laughable, and when 'i lose my temper all smile. You have done so frequently, she ladded, addressing me; and I could not deny the soft impeach- ment. "I will never'do it again," I said, most sincerely. "Then we will be friends henceforth, even if you are a Prot- -estant. The saints forgive me; I never loved but one man, and he was a foreigner and a heretic." She extended her thin, wrinkled hand, and I did not disdain to bend my head and imprint, a kiss upon it, and when I dobked up saw that her eyes were filled with tears, and that her face had lost its austere expression.                  /   192        LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "I think that you are a good young iman," she said, -with a smile; "-and I know that you will make Teresa a nice husbland She loves you, or she would not torment you as she does, and you must love her, or I have lost all fatith in men's eyes. Let not your -religion stand in each other's way, for toleration will over. come that objection." "Alas, senora! -you talk to one who does not hesitate to ac- knowledge his love; but I fear that Teresa is lost to me for. ever." "How?" demanded the old lady, in astonishment. "Has any 'accident happened to her?  She was away from home last nilht, but I supposed that she had gone to her country-seat, fbaring the earthquake.'               , I saw that Pedro was listening with greedy ears to the conver- sation, and I was not disposed to enlighte hi in hi in regard to the doings of the preceding night. With all the grace of a modern cavalier, I be(gged for a few moments' private conversation, and the lady willingly signifieu her consent. She extended her hand, and I led her up the broad staircase to the sitting-room where I had passed so many days in the society of Don Arturo and Te. resa, listless and unambitious of everything except a smile friom the latter. "  You are a stranger to the house," she said, as she motioned me to a  seat, " and I began to fear that we had lost you forevei. A   looer's quarrel, I suppose. Thev frequently happen before marriacge. Be careful that they seldom occur afterwards." You said you approved of my passion for your niece," I  re- marked, with a close scrutiny of her face, to see if it was possible for her to put on a  semblance of friendship that she did not feel. I  remembered the warning that Father Benventuro had given me, and determined to be cautious. "I will answer you frankly," she returned, n myfeelings have undergone a   great changre within a few weeks, and I no longer look upon you as a fortune-hunter. Marry my niece by all mea ns, and I   think that much happiness will spring from the union." I   could but bow to the complinment. She looked honest and sincere, and I  determined to trust her. Before I could touch upon the subject nearest my heart, the senora continued, - "Thirty years since I was engaged to be married to a country-  man of yours, and a Protestant. He was a noble-looking man, * Y               in   A. CONFESSION.         193 handsome, and generous to a fauilt, so there is but little cause to Wonder why I loved him dearly, and that he loved me: We should have been married in spite of. the prejudices of friends, had he not sickened and died. Our plans were well laid, and Father Juan, who was then poor and in want" of money, agreed to perform the ceremony for a certain consideration. This fact has bound me to the father for many years, even knowing, as I do, that he is not favorably disposed towards you, for reasons that are purely mercenary and selfish. He is powerless, however, for 'relesa is wilful, and will have her ,own way." I no longer hesitated to reveal to Donna Raquel the proceedings of the night, even to the visit of the strange ladies, althoLugh I took good care to say that they Wvere friends of Tom, and in no way connected with me. I told her of the marriage by Father Benventuro, of the earthquake, and the disappearance, and then I pictured my unhappiness and, anxiety. The old lady heard me without interruption, although she did manifest some surprise when I alluded to the matritnonial part of the story; but 'I thougtht that she rather approved of it than otherwise, as it re- minded her of' the adventurous days of her youth. "You are really married,; then, the saints be praised?" she asked. "Father Benventuro tells me so, although :1 have no cause to rejoice thereat, for the little that I have seen of married life has been far from pleasant." "Poor child!" the old, lady said, soothingly, 1 ' I hope that there are better days in store for you, and that the great-happiness which you so much desire- may soon be within your reach. I should have preferred a priest a little different from Benventuro's princi- ples, for he is reputed unscrupulous and cunning, and I was never wholly satisfied. with the investigation of Don Arturo's death, which occurred at his convent of San Pedro. Still, as I know that he hates Father Juan,; and that Father Juan detests himn, he may have lent you his assistance out of spite. Time will reveal the workings of their hearts ; but I tell you, sincerely, that neither of them is as pure in mind: and principle as I hope you are.' Of course I could only blush: and murmur some indistinct ex- pressions, which were not noticed.    !  ' Now, in this matter I intend to stand your friend, for, the saints be praised, I have still a feeling at lpy hxart that warms at 13  194       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. the sight of youth and domestic happiness. But my opinions I must keep to myself, for we rmust meet; craft by craft, and if Pa. ther Juan has Teresa in his power, we must discover her place of residence by stratagem, for we cannot obtain it by force or kind. ness. I shall have to pretend for him sentiments of friendship that, I do not feel, for I now know what his plans are and his expecta- tions.' My poor niece is not fit for a convent, for she is impul" sive and headstrong, and would soon break her heart fretting for, liberty. Poor child! poor child! I wish that I was able to see her before me now." The old lady was so deeply affected, that she was obliged to call a servant to bring a glass of cordial, which she was very. fond of, and which she contended was a certain specific against the jungle fever. Of course I was compelled to join her, and praise the liquor, as it really deserved tobe ; and by such a course did not lose ground in her heart. -' Father Juan loves this cordial dearly, and always asks for a glass if we forget our usual hospitality. I shall see him before many hours, and perhaps by the influence of the wine his heart may expand sufficiently to enlighten me in relation to his secrets.- I have no doubt in my mind that he has Teresa in his power; but." I fear that he won't be ready to acknowledge it. We must hope  for the best, however, and keep him in ignorance of the marriage, - Now go, and the saints be with you. Call and see me to-morrow - in the evening if possible, and report progress. Keep your stout: heart pure and strong, and God will aid you."' . . . She extended her thin, wrinkled hand, and I kissed it, and left-., the liouse ash heavy hearted las when I entered. Even -Pedro, thel- porter, seemed to pay me more respect on account of the grief. which he could not help noticing upon my face; and as he -re- moved his- hat, he hoped the saints would shower any quapntity  of blessings upon my head, give me long life and perfect healthl for the four-real piece which I tossed him. A piece -of silver is a, cheap way of-obtaining blessings, and I wondered sometimes if-: the Mestiza's prayers, which seemed so sincere, were ever heard. There was one. place which I still desired to visit, and yet I: dreaded to do so. It, was the Mortgue house of Ianila, that corn-:. mon receptacle, Where Catholic and Protestant, Mestizo and China- man, soldier and sailors were conveyed to await recognition in, case of sudden or violent death in the streets, or at the numerous   THE MORGUE OF MANILA,         195 drinking houses, where sometimes bloody fights occurred, and which only terminated by the arrival of armed soldiers, the police of the city. The house of the dead was usually the scene of considerable excitement after an earthquake, as those whbo had lost friends were always fearful- of the worst, and rushed in crowds towards it, for the purpose of satisfying their f;ears, and sometimes hopes. The building was situated near -the cigar factory, and was not a substantial brick or stone lhouse, but built of bamboo, one story high, and thatched with leaves like common huts. To this melancholy place I determined to go, for the purpose of being assured that my wife's body was not there; for I still had a fear that she might have been drowned while attempt- ing to escape, and while bewildered at the earthquake. The dis-? tance was not great; so I determined to walk to the house and not call a carriage, many of which stood in the street waiting for fares, while their drivers or postilions smoked or slept upon the boxes. I found the house of the dead, as I expected, surrounded by an excited crowd of people, males and females, children and old men, and all kept at a distance from the place by a line of bayo- nets, which sometimes were made to prick the flesh if the excited rabble pressed forward too rapidly, or were not respectful to their masters. Only a few people at a time were allowed within the euclosure, and even these were closely questioned by a fierce- looking orderly sergeant, before- permission was granted, for the man knew that two thirds of those present were attracted to the spot by mere curiosity, and that to get sight of the dead they would lie, and even steal, if the latter crime was necessary. For a few minutes I remained standing in front of the men, almost determined not to enter, yet anxious to satisfy myself that Teresa was not there. I saw a few Mestizas pass in and out with the most stoical indifference, so it was impossible to tell by their looks whether they had lost a relative or an enemy. "I beg your pardon, senor," said the sergeant, touching his cap, " for disturbing your reflections ; but if you fear to enter alone, and see the dead, I will go with you." The man supposed that I wastimid, and that the sight of death- would alarm me.   196       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "Has the senor lost a friend?" he asked, before I could con- vince him that I was not so timid as he supposed me. "I have," 1replied. ' Was it a male or female?" he demanded. 6 A lady," I answered. "There are several Mestiza girls in the house, but only one that was handsome and worthy to be a cavalier's companion. Will you go with me, and see the corpse?" I consented to do so, when the soldier rapped the shins and backs of half a dozen natives who stood 'in his way and didn't mnove quick enough, and entered the building. The fellow sup- posed that I was looking for the remains- of a mlistress, who was killed during the earthquake, and the circumstance of a Euro- pean living with a MDestiza girl was too common to excite com- ment or particular notice. In fact, r ost foreigners who reside there form a liaison with native women, and they preside over the household as though regularly married. There are a few ex- ceptions to -the rule, to be sure; but humanity shows itself in the East Indies as well as in the Atlantic cities. "Here is a fellow,' said the sergeant, touching, with his rattan, a body, " who -got jammed in between two canoes, and so died. His body floated to the shore, and was landed in a court-yard, Examine him, and you will see that his ribs are bruised and his back broken." I declined the office, and the soldier passed on. "There is: the Mestiza girl that I spoke to you about. She was found drowned in the court-yard of an English merchant's house, She lived with him as his mistress for one year, and proud enough she was of her position. It's a little singular that she should have drowned in two feet of water, for I have seen her swim like a deer; and many-a time has she crossed the Pasig with a strovng current running, down stream, sufficient to tax the arms of a stout boatman to make headway in his banco. I wonder if the arrival of the Englishman's wife had anything to do with the girl's death.'  We passed the lifeless form of the girl, and then took a quick survey of the remaining bodies" but Teresa was not there, and I turned to depart. The sergeant touched his cap, and was about to move away, when I slipped a dollar into his hand, which called forth expres-   "ET THE DEAD BURYt THE DB AD      19  dions of good will, so that he accompanied me to the entrance )f the square. I turned to leave the spot, when a Mestiza girt not more than fifteen years of age, appeared as though desirous of speaking to me. "What do you desire?"I asked, calling the girl to me; the more readily, I believe, because she was remarkable for her good loolks, and fine, plump forma. H Ias -the senor visited the house of the dead?" she asked. I replied in the affirmative. I have -waited here all the morning, senor, for the purpose of visiting the Morgue, to see if my sister was there; but the crowd is so great, and the soldiers so cross, that I can't get in. Will the senor tell me if there is a girl there who resembled me, when living?"  -I compared the features of the Mestiza with the Englishman's late muistress, and was compelled to confess thal; there was a strong resemblance between then.. "There is no doubt but it is Sara," she said, after I had given her the information. "I was told that her body was there, but I wished to be certain. The saints be praised; she will have Christian burial." I started towards my house; but to my surprise the girl con- tinued to walk by my side, as though she had no thoughts of parting company so soon. (' Why do you not return to the house of te dead, and claim the body of your sister?"I inquired. "Why should I?" she asked, with a look of surprise; " the priests will see that she has Christian burial, and what more could I ask?2"  I-ave you no money to pay for burial?" ]I asked. "No, senor, not a medio." "But where are your parents?"  "My mother 4is dead, and my father is a bancario. I seldonim  see him, senor, for he spends his time upon the water and in the' wine shops," she answered, with charming simplicity. "Suppose I should give you money to bury the body of your sister - would you do so?"  - Of what use would ithe, senor? The priests will attend to ,her, and give her the benefit of their praers" .    100 198       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.  Your sister did not live at home?"I said, finding, that the girl  was determined to walk by my side through the streets.  No, senor" she answered, without the least confusion; ' she lived with a rich merchant, who gave my father ten- dollars for her two years since. She had many dresses, plenty to eat, and smoked nice paper cigars. She was very happy at her good fortune in attracting the attention of'the Ingles. I hope that the saints will permit me to be as successful." Here was a confession with a vengeance, and made to a youu&  man supposed to be susceptible to female influences. But I thou,"t of my lost wife, and determined to resist temptation for  her sake. ' Do you mean that yon would be willing to live with a for- eigner, in case he should ask you? s I demanded. Why not, senor?9 The girls are petted 'and well dressed, and don't have to w-ork for a little rice and a few plantains for food.  If we should marry we would be ill treated, and have to support our husbands by washing from morning till night o the banks of the river. Besides, I like the Ingles-they are brave and rich." I saw that, like her more refined sisters of other climes, she I was willing to sell all for gold; and there were plenty of for-  eigners in Manila who would not have scrupled to accept the barter, but I did-'ot know how I could prevent it. "D on't the priests reprove you for having such thouhts I T asked.    t               ' "I don't know, senor, because I never confessed my thoughts I to them. I only tell them just as little as possible, so that I shan't get a severe penance. When my sister went to the merchant's house, she gave the priest a dollar, and he pardoned her for the wrong she had done. Couldn't I do the same?" I returned no answer, but walked by her side in silence, thinly. ing of her strong desire to lead a life of shame, and wondern if I could not save het. b Senor,"' she said, looking timidly in my  face, "don't you want me?" I shook my head in the negative. "I am so sorry," she answered with a sigh; "I have no home, and no one to care'- for me. If you will giv me shelter I will love you dearly.",   A WNiW SERVANT.         1'99 But I am married," I replied.  "Then let me wash your clothes and mend them., or I will ,embroider your shirts and make new ones, for I have done such things. If you don't like me, I will leave any time that you de- sire. Besides Hcan help your wife dress, and take care of the children."  "But my wife is away now, and I have no children." 4 "But she will return, and the saints will bless her with a little one." There was no withstanding the appeal. She had touched me ,with a random shot, and I was compelled to surrender without a struggle. "You may go home with me," I said, " and stay there until my wife returns; but remember, I shall keep a strictwatch over you, and if I see any signs of wickedness I s1iall send youlaway. Your duties will be light, and I shall pay you a certain sum per I week for attending to them. But you must ldnderstand me that you are to occupy one part of the house at night, while I occupy another." She readily agreed to the proposition, and I thought, as she walked by my side, what an acquisition she wduld be to Teresaes household, if I could preserve her purity and good looks until my wife's return. At any rtate, it was worth sormething to take her from the reach of the tempters who thronged the city, and were ever ready to pounce upon the young and thoughtless; andI knew that Teresa would thank me for it, after she fully understood my motives.               . I reached the house about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, just in time for breakfast, which was all ready for me. Father Ben- venturd had made his toilet, and put on his robes, cleared of their stains by my servants, wlo hbad labored whie the .pwdre slept, while Alien and Tom, both looked the better for a change of cloth- ing, which the latter had supplied by sending to- his hotel duripg my absence.  "We have been waiting nearly an hour for you," cried the  priest, as soon as he saw us coming up the stairway; " rm half  starved, for I've eaten nothing of any conlsequen ce since yester- day."             .     -  At this instant Gracia, the new servant wqade her appearance,  and was saluted with a roar of astonishment from]the graeles i  scamps.    200       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.  I-Tere's a model husband for you! He starts to look for his wife, and not finding, her, brings home a substitute. And faith, she isn't -bad looking, either, for a Mestiza. Come here and kiss me." The girl looked at me and then at the priest, as though un- certain hojw to act.  Do you wish to salute the holy father?"I asked. "No, senor; I had rather kiss you. He is too fat."  "He has trained her well for so short a time," Benventuro said. - Who would have thought that he was suc h a sly youngo dog? Where did you pick her up? What did you pay for her?"' and other questions were propounded, until I thought that it was about time to relieve their minds. "Gentlemen," I said, 6" this girl I have taken to my house for the purpose of preserving lher purity, and because she is friend-. less and homeless. I know your thoughts, and believe me, they are ill-founded. The respect and love which I entertain for my wife will enable me to be a safe guardian to this girl."' "O, gammon! that's all wasted on us," was Tom's exclama- tion; and as I knew that any assertion of mine would be regarded with suspicion, in case I was too eager to refute all that was hinted at, I said no more to the company, but called my boy, and gave him directions to prepare Gracia a room, and to look to her for assistance in taking care of the house, not only during my ab- sence, but while I was at home. The orders rather astonished my friends, and they began to comprehend me; although they often wondered how a man could remain pure in a country where immorality is not regarded as a crime, and where wife and mistress often reside under the same roof, and fathers barter for a daughter's virtue. ' Gentlemen," I said, "' if you have finished your interroga- tions, we will eat breakfast." "We have not a word to say in opposition to that project," said  the priest, delighted at the sight of the well-loaded trable, my cook having done his best. "For these blessings," cried the padre, as he tucked a napkin under his chin, "let us be thankful, and 'wish for more. Amen. May the saints give us good appetites and strong digestion. Hland me the bottle, for I am parched with thirst." . -The bottle was passed without delay, and the holy father was   UP, TIE RI'VEE.  then in his element. He forgot all earthly care while feeding, and nothing but an earthquake could have shaken him from the Biut all pleasures must terminate, and at length the priest was compelled to lean back in his chair, and acknowledged that even his stomach was incapable of receiving more solids ; but for liquids he professed himself competent to drink all night, if any one was disposed to keep him company. t' You talk of drinking all day and night, and yet you know that we have an engagement at San Pedro Macati, to witness a cock-fight to-morrow," said Allen, who was disposed to be light with the bottle. "T Ah, curse it! I forgot that," was the rather irreverent re- spouse; "I have two ounces bet upon my favorite cock, and if I should lose, I'll curse the whole Mestizo race I have lost all the l revenue of the convent the past two weeks, and unless I win, the nuns will have to suck their fingers for nourishment, for food they'll not get from me." ,; Then it is necessary that you should keep sober, for you are a reckless better fter dinner," Allen said. "Come, my banco is at the landing by this time, waiting to carry us to Santa Mesa. I invite all present to go with me, and promise that you shall have a good dinner, and a bottle of excellent wine. "Hurrah!" cried the priest; that last consideration is en- *titled to cuch weigt; I go with Senor Allen, and will never leave him until his wine turns sour, or he becomes a good Cath- olic." "I go with you!" cried Tom. "And you, Guillermo?"  "Alas! I must remain, and search for my wife. I am in no mood for revels, and should mar your enjoymhent." j  "Nonsense!" cried the priest; " you do no good here, and -,! might do much harm. Go with us, and I'll see that your interests ' are looked after while absent." Perhaps the Mestiza girl might object," suggested Tom, with a wink.                         i , "O, if he prefers her society to ours, we have nothing to say," / they shouted in chorus, i   - .            ., I could no longer refuse, for if I had remained at home, a bd interpretation of my conduct would haveensued. So, for the sake -  202        ,IFE IN THE EAST INDIES. of my reputation and that of the young and handsome girl whose protector I had suddenly become, I was obliged to leave the city with my guests. Not every one would have acted as I did; but a pure conscience is now my reward. The resolution, which I had formed for the purpose of leaving Manila for a few days, cost me a bitter pang; for I thought that the time could be much more usefullvy employed in searching for my wife. The assurances of the priest and Alien that it was useless for me to stir in the matter at present, as I was doubtless surrounded by spies who would report to Father Juan and his satellites every movement that I made, at length had the effect of restoring me to a feeling of composure which I had not enjoyed for some time. I hastily put a few articles that I should need into a -carpet-bag, locked up my private room, and was giving instructions to the boy regarding his conduct during my absence, when Gracia interposed. Will the- senor be gone long?" she asked, with every appear- ance of sorrow at my contemplated absence. -I I shall return to the city to-morrow night, but only for a few hours," I replied. "I shall be very unhappy during your absence," she said; and her words produced a shout from the priest and Tom which -amazed me exceedingly. 6 By the saints," muttered the priest,- "it's quite refreshing to hear such innocence and simplicity in these selfish days. Bring her along, Guillermo, if you think that she can't survive your loss for a few days." ( My dear child," I said, regardless of the shouts of my com- panions, "' I did not brings you here- for the purpose of winTnin your love; so you must not mention such a subject in future. Stay here in the house and conduct yourself in a proper manner,  and you are sure of my protection as long as you do so. If you want work while I am absent from the house, the boy will show you what to do." She held down her head, and I thought that she only restrained herself fromn weeping by a violent effort. "Unless I had seen the exhibition with my own eyes, I would not have believed it. Hereafter I am astonished at nothing. An American, twenty-three years of age, refuses the advances of a   9203 WINSI AND. CONTENTENTMENT.  damsel of fifteen. Senors, we must drink a glass of wine in honor of the miracle!" shouted the priest. The wretches solemnly pledged each other, and even had the impudeuce to ask me to join them. "Come," cried Alien, " let us hurry to the river, or Guillermo will alter his opinion, and then there will no longer be a miracle. Come, gentlemen, it's time we were on board."     .  me left the house in a body, and reached the banco by three o'clock, just the hour when the sun pours down the hardest and the principal portion of the inhabitants are taking their siesta, preparatory to a good dinner, and a life- of enjoyment in the eveninol. She banco was large and comfortable, and while we settled out forms upon the mats which lined the bottom of the boat, hile et ones screened us overhead from the fierce rays of the sun, Alien passed around his cigar-case, and ordered his crew o shove of and conmmence the slowu ascent -of the stream, against a strong current.                        -(.

He turned his head a little to look for it, and s that Allen had raised it to his mouth, and was makg sad havo with its contents.   "Avast, Satan!" shouted Benventuro; I took thatfrom the table for mly own especial benefit, to cheer me o, mywan y and to sustain mine in case ;of sickness or shipwreck. Wretcfyu will be cursed in this world and the next for thus trifling with the church,; "How, by St. Peter, but you shall not have a single drop of the wine until you give me your blessing!

One of the crew, a young( fellow with a ready smile, stopped his rowingr, and from the bows passed aft a basket filled with half a dozen bottles of choice claret. The eyes of the priest brightened, and he made a sudden movement that was the means of produs cing hs flask from beneath his robe. 'I will share with you, nlmy children," he said; 'no mLan should be selfish to friends, or even to his fellow-man. I con- tribute what I have to the common stock.", "You see, most holy father, that I was more thouahtful than Ou, Allen -exclaimed; "I told the men, when they came after , to put a few bottles of wine in the boat, for I suspected that . I should have company.  Now, not a drop do you get, unless you Spin us a yarn while we are on our wray to Santa Mesa." "Is that your firm resolution?" demanded the padre. "Unalterable as destiny," was the reply., "Bt you will allow me a drop before I begin?" "Not a  drop until the yarn is commenced." Will you have a  serious or mirthful story?" "Mirthful, if possible; for, see, G lillermo looks as though he x had lost his friends in addition to hs wife."  The holy father refireshed his mouth with a long pull at his private bottle, and then commenced:-  "Were either of -you ever in Cadiz, a seaport city in Spain? You were not. Then I   shall not tell you what beautiful women are there, nor what excellent wine can be obtained for two reals -two articles which should always be taken into consideration, when a  permanent residence is thought of by a gentleman of means and leisure. I was born in Cadisz, and in that city I first obtaineds my ideas of religion and pleasure. It was there I spent my boyish   THBE PRIEST'S STORY.       1205 days; it was there I learned to love or hate, as suited my notions of independence or passion. "When I was fifteen, I was sent to the college of St. Salvador for an education, and for the purpose of being initiated in the secrets of priesthood. It was a Jesuit college, and in its days of pride was rich,; but the French, may the saints confound them, during the Peninsular war, nearly ruined its resources, and crip- pled its usefulness in more ways than one. "I was no more fit to become a priest than myfriend Alien, here, who would require years of probation before he could con- fess-a person in a manner not to scandalize the church. But my parents were firm believers in my wonderful talents, and always prophesied that I would die a bishop, or something higher--what the higher meant I am -unable to say. Perhaps they imagined that, as I was rather a desperate young fellow, the gallows would ultimately fall in my way. The saints forbid that such a death should happen to me, for I know of a dozen more deserving than myself of the honor. Of course I except all in the banco butthe  crew, and I don't care what becomes of thlem, ' For the first few days of my imprisonment in the college-- for I thought that I might as well be in a dungeon - I passed mytime lonely enough. I could look from the grated windows, and see the crowds of ladies and gentlemen passing, on horseback and in their carriages; and I thought a seat by the side of a pretty senorita, or on the back of a spirited animal, a much more pleasant place than pondering over dry books and! listening to musty precepts. . ' Leave of absence was only granted us once in three months, and then we were compelled to see our parents in the presence of a priest, who listened to what we said, and reported the unfavor- able words that we used if we were imprudent enough to do so. Then followed punishment in the shape of bread and water, a hard bed, and frequent application of the rod to shoulders whichwere tender and unused to severity. , "All of this galled my spirit; but Of what use were my com- plaints? They were unheeded by the superior, a stern man, accustomed to bend men's minds to his own mould, and who looked upon uis boys as fitting instruments to .experiment with. I would have run away, but I knew that I should be brought back and punished with tenrrible severity; so I concluded to make   206       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES the best of my situation, and repay myself for the privations when I took orders and emerged from my seclusion." "And faithfully have you kept your word," interrupted Alien, passing a bottle of claret for the purpose of refreshing his stomach, and stimulating the padre during the recital of his story. The priest smiled, and continued:- , "While I was pondering on the subject of my captivity, one day, a student, about my ,own age, named Antonio, accosted me as follows. "Benventuro,' he said, ' you are thinking of the world and its follies; its wine shops and its flirting women; its vanities and its pleasures. Give up such thoughts, and consider how you can obtain the order of sanctity.' ("It's an or der that suits me not, I I replied. ' I had much rather be a sinner than a saint.' '(I'm fearful that you were not intended for the church,' Antonio said, with a sigh, casting his eyes upon the floor of the chapel where we stood, waiting the arrival of a priest to give us instructions in prayers. "I have been of the same opinion for many months, I an- swered; ' but I dare not hint as much to the superior.' "' In that you show your sense, for the holy father is a man of few wolrds, and has no patience'with youth who cling to recol- lections of the flesh. But, after all, of what use would a free communication with the world be to us, when wre have not a peso we can call our own? i In that you are mistaken,' I replied, sinking my voice and speaking in a whisper: " when I left my home my parents gave me twelve doubloons, and requested the amoilut to be expended in prayers for my success in the world. I have the money in a belt around my body, and shall keep it there until I can find a priest willing to pray for my restoration to life and-its pleasures.' ' My companion's face assumed a look that betokened great interest. "' Would you like to expend the money? ' he demanded.  "'Yes, but not for charity or religion-' I replied; 'I have enough of both, every day, to last me a lifetime.' "( Bah! ' he answered; ' I don't mnean that the money should be given to these spying priests, or the cold-blooded superior. What say you to a glorious spree in the city,- where we con revel   T  EE PRIEST'S STORY. :    20 in wine, and flirt with handsome women -dance at the masked b)alls, and drive jealos hus usbands crazy?' ; :Can this be done?' I demanded, in astonishment. "' To be sure it can, and a glorious time we can have of it, if we are only cautious, ad keep from drinking too much wine.' Showme the way, for miy gold is burning my flesh, and I lono to get rid of it,' I answered. "And you will share with me in everything?' Antonio whis- Six of the doubloons are yours, if you will only lead the Bay to expend it.' "'Agreed. This- night you shall taste of pleasure, and know the first principles of a Jesuit's life. But -you must also use a Jesuit's circumspection, and keep your tongue and thoughts under discipline. Not by word or sign must you let the priests compre- hend the conversation that has passed between us. If ou do, a deep cell and a damp one will receive us. Be ready, after the nine o'clock vespers, to start.' ". We separated, for just at that moment the priest entered the chapel, and had he seen us speaking together, it is quite within the limits of probability that he would have required- a knowledge of our discussion; and if he could have wormed it from us, the superior might have paid us a visit in our cells-I can't call them chambers, for the doors were locked upon us at night, and iron bars were before the windows.  "I heard but little of the good man's exhortation that day, and I learned but little from the volumes put before me. - The priests appeared to my eyes like huge goblets of wine, or men and women dancing. Four or five times I looked up, and s4aw the suspicious gaze of the superior fixed upon my countenance, and Ihad no means of allaying his doubts of my goodness but by counting my beads, and raising my eyes in rapt devotion to a picture of the first grand general of the order, which hung in the school-room." "Then it appears to me," interrupted Allen, " that you were acting the hypocrite most admirably." "Not so; my son," Benventuro replied; "I was actgno the Jesuit, and very successfully, too, for one so young. I dont mind making the confession here, for I know that I! am-with friends-that neither of you will ever be converted to Catholicity, for your bumps of sinnership-are too largely developed to believe-   '208       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. in- the true faith, and all the -noney that I get -from you for the benefit of the church, of course must be in the way of cock-fibht E ing -more shame for you." '- "Take another pull at the bottle and a fresh cigar," Alien said, with a laugh at the confession.  "Thank you, I will indulge in both, because the tobacco calns the nerves, and the wine stimulates thelq brain. But to continue. I managed to contain my secret, Mthou* I thought that I should burst with the effort; and when at sundown we partook of our humble supper, a piece of bread and a cup of water, I cleverly avoided eating for fear that I should have no room for the soup, and eggs, and chicken, which I fancied I saw before me. The  saints knew I was hungry enough, and had been ever since I be- came an inmate of the college; blt I had eaten so much coarse bread that the siht nof it sickened me, especially when we poor devils of students could smell the savory messes, cooked in oil and seasone  with garlic, which were being prepared for the B superior after the duties of the day were over. Another eason  why I  refused to eat the bread was oecaase I noticed that Antonio  didn't do so, and that he made me an almost imperceptible sign to favor my appetite. t 'o After supper-we were allowed to work in the garden attached to the college sntil the nine o'clock vespers ;wand when we had listened to a  few prayers and a short address conceitninD the  beauties of Jesuitism, we were marched to our cells and locked inj where weT were generally left un olested until four o'clock in the luornina, t whieh time we were compelled to rise, slummer and winter. i "' I  did not lie down to sleep that night, you may be assured, for I  was all anticipation of a visit front  ntonio.

At length the spies, who were stationed in the corlidor for the pur- ?ose of listening to the conversation of the students, got tired of ;uch stuff,. and left us to our fate ; for you know a man can't stand verything, and-they had heard enough to satisfy themselves-that    THEE PRIEST S STORY.       209   . Antonio was a most promisiDng young man ; ;and indeed he was. I have rarely seen his equal. "About ten o'clock Antonio's prayers ceased for the want of fuel to keep then up ; and in consequence of tl;e silence that pre- vailed, every boy went to sleep excepting Antonio and myself. Whle the snoring was raging all around us, I heard some one 'at my door, and in a few seconds it opened, and my-friend entered my cell. "'Don't speak a loud word,' he whispered; 'if you do you will bring some of the watchers down on us, and that we shouldn't like. Take hold of my hand, and follow me.' "' But how did you get my door open, and your own?' I askled. "' I merely picked the locks, and when we come back I shall lock you in, and then do the same for myself. But don't stop to ask questions. We have a night of eating and drinking before us, and time is precious. You have got the money safe?' "I had taken good care not to leave that behind. "' Then follow me,' Antonio said, ' and mind that you tread as lightly as a cat.' "We crept through the gloomy corridor, until we reached a small gate, that was quickly unlocked, and as quickly secured again; and in a few seconds we were in the chapel, and standing before the altar lights, which burned night and day in fiont of the virgin and her child. For a moment I stopped to cross my- self and mutter a pater noster; but before the latter Was finished I was pushed towards the altar by Antonio, and told to remove a piece of carpet that covered the floor where the priests were in the habit of standing w;hen saying mass. I did as he directed, but nothing buit the floor met my view. "While I was wondering what he could mean, he motioned me back a few paces, and touched a secret spring. A panel slid back, and a flight of steps met my gaze. My companion inti- mated that I was expected to go down, and I obeyed him, he fol- lowing and closing the panel noiselessly. We found ourselves in the most intense darkness, without a single ray of light to tell us which way to turn; but Antonio seemned famniliar with the place, and no longer confined his remarks to whispers. "Stand where you are without moving, and I'll finld a light,' he said.       i  ..    210       LIFE .IN THE EAST INDIES. "' But where are we, and what is the cause of this humid, sickening smell-?' I asked.   :i "' We are under the chapel,' Antonio replied, ' and the smell which you complain of is not very agreeable, I must confess, be- cause it is occasioned by the decomposition of a dozen or two priests, whose bones have been deposited here at different times within the last fifty years. I wish that the blessed saints would take them all in the course of a year, and leave us to-begin the world as we please. Spain would lose nothing, while I think we should be gainers by the airrangrement.' "I didn't like the idea of standing there in the dark, surrounded by dead priests; so I begged Antonio to hurry with the light. He laughed at my timidity, and rattled at some boards until I 'thought the priests were strugg ling to life to punish us for the desecration. "At length I heard the sound of flint,and steel, and- in a second afterwards a pale, flickering light, hardly relieving the gloom and darkness, appeared. "( Here's where I keep the tools for a light, in case you should come here alone,' my companion said, raising the lid of a coffin that rested on a huge stone slab near the steps which we had de- scended. ' You. can always find them in the coffin, because I don't think that any one would be likely to disturb them. You can see that only a few bones remain of a priest, who at one time must have been of some importance, for I see a silver plate on the-wood-work; and faith I have a good mind to take it, and dispose of it to the first broker we may meet. The money would do me more good than the dead, and I have no doubt that the fel- low, if alive, would thank me for my forethought.' "As I was unused to such things, I begged Antonio to let the plate alone, promising. him all the wine he could drink if he would oblige me. I think that my liberal offer had the desired effect, for he gave up his purpose, then wanted me to examine the coffins, and see how I liked their arrangement. I deiclined the tempting offer, and expressed a wish to get clear of such scenes as fast as possible; but my companion laughed at me for a simple- ton who was afraid of the dead, when the dead were incapable of inflicting any harm. "' The fact of it is,' said Antonio, - seating himself upon one of the stone slabs, and resting ,his light upon a coffin that had been   2" THE   .

There is no re- straint here. If one wishes to laugh, there -s no stern-looking priest here to rebuke you for' levity, and inflict penance --from nalice. A mancan learn more here in an our, than from all the teachings of the superior in a year.' " That may be true,' ]1 replied; ' but all people are not consti- tuted alike. I expect every moment to feel the cold hand of a skeleton upon my neck, and don't see any pleasure staying in a damp vault, when the wine shops are open and invite us.' "'By the saints, you speak truly,' Antonio said, rising and- leading the way to the other end of the vault. 'Let us be mov- : ing, for my mouth is watering for a glass of Madeira and a mouthful of chicken. Keep close to me, and bend your head,or it may come in contact with a beam occasionally. Step carefully, and don't mind the rats, They won't trouble us; at least they never have showed fight to me, and I think that they are disposed to be friends.'" "If you could, without much inconvenience to yourself and friend, get out of that vault, I should-be much obliged to you, as I think you have been there long enough," Allen remarked, as the priest stopped to take another pull at the bottle, and to light a fresh cigar. "I have no objection to that, I assure you," replied Ben- veuturo, " for I am not one who likes to hover around the dead, unless they have left-me and the church good legacies. Let me see - where was I?" "The rats were chasing you from the vault. I think," Allen said, with a'yawn. O' O y'es; there were many disagreeable associations connected with that vault, and I afterwards learned that before the Peninsular war the place was filled'with racks and thumb-screws, shower- baths and penances, and other delightful'inventionsfor convert- ing Pagans, Jews, and Protestants to Christianity. Irsuppose I could tell you reminiscences of that place, which would make your blood run coldi" "Do so then, for Heaven's sake, for I'm roasting with heat,' Allen said,    i       '  '   ' ' -' The priest' disdained to notice -the interruption, and -coi -    1   212     ,  LIE. IN THE EAST INDIES. When we gained a wall, Antonio showed me a small door which would have escaped notice unless a close examination was made. Tile hinges were rusty, and creaked most discordantly when the door was opened; and had my companion not shaded the light with his hand, the strong draft of air would have ex- tioguished the flame. I looked into the dark passage, but could see notdinl but mould and darkness, and I drew back somewhat alarmed." "' There is nothing to fear,' Antonio said. ' I have traversed the passage many times, and never met anything worse than a bat or a toad. But you are not to go out yet, for it would be rather inconvenient to meet with a priest belonging to the college,  and have him take as before the superior. Explanations are so unpleasant at certain times!' ' Then we are not to show ourselves in our college costume?' I asked.  ' 'Of course not. I should be a poor pupil to a Jesuit society, if I  did not guard against such an unnecessary display of our robes. We  visit the city as cavaliers, and very good looking ones we shall make, I have no doubt.' " "How you must-have changed since your youth!" Allen sug- gested; but the padre merely shook his fat fist at the speaker; and continued his narrative:- '-Antonio paid a second visit to a coffin that reposed in soli- tary grandeur near the door, and produced two tight-fittin I jackets, with bell buttons and velvet trimmings, and trousers of the same material, open at the legs, and about the right size. We threw off our robes and put on ,the clothes without waste of timle; and after I had adjusted a red sash around roy waist, my companion thrust a  hat upon my head, placed all of our clothing in the coffin, covered it with the lid, and gave the signal to start. "' How did you ever discover this passage?' I asked, as we groped our way along, starting bats from their slumbers and toads, from their apathy. "' By keeping my eyes open, instead of sleeping, as many young men would have done. But to let you into the secret, I don't mind saying that a  year ago I was ordered to do penance in the chapel all nioht. You may recollect what I was punished for. It was for throwing a  loaf of bread at Pedro's head, because he said that W .vr vlJl;   THE' PRIEST'S STORY. -213 he could write better Latin than mnyself. The fool, he knew no more about the dead languages than I did, and I was not intimate- ly acquainted with verbs, However, I had violated a rule of the college, and I was punished bybeing locked in the chapel all night, and I was expected to repeat one hundred players before morning. I managed to get through with one by way of pastime, and while I was practising a new dance before the altar, I thought I heard a noise underneath the chapel; and althoug(h I have but little belief in the devil, I didn't know but there might be such an individual, and that he was in want of me. :I considered that the best thing that I could do would be to get out of the way as fast as possible, for I had no notion of visiting the regions of the damned, where all but good Jesuits go. "' 'I thought that the nearer to the altar I got, the safer I should be, and with a brief prayer, only extorted from me on account of fear, I hid under a lounge, and lay there with a quaking heart. In a short time, to mly intense horror, I saw the floor move, then open, and a rush of cold air, laden with sickening effluvia, which, to my imagination, smelt like brimstone, filled the chapel, and convinced mte that I was really to receive a visit from the devil. "' First a head was thrust through the opening, and then a body followed slowly, as though tired with exertion. H shut my eyes to hide the dreadful sight, but for fear of consequences I remained quite still, and waited the moment when the forked tail was to be stluck into my side, and I was to be borne to other regions, where prayers and masses are of little avail. At length I found that I was unharmed, and I ventured to look up. You may- imagine my surprise, Benventuro, when I sawr that, instead of the devil, it was only his friend, the superior, changing his clothes; and from a cavalier's suit he gradually assumed the plain robes of the priest. He did the work very deliberately, too, as though he had been through the same operation before, and could do so again. "I was slightly astonished, you may well imnagine, and as all fear had left me when I found that I was dealing with a natural body instead of a supernatural one, I watched the old ,man's mo- tions with considerable interest. I saw him close the trap door, and cover the same with the carpet;, and once when he bent his body near mine, I detected the smell of wine, and I jumped at a conclusion at once. I supposed that our respected superior was only common clay, after all, and that he liked the society of   214       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. the world andc a sup of wine as well as the rest of us, and that, to enjoy himself without restraint, it was necessary he should visit the city in disguise. I reasoned that if he could leave the college by the way of the vault, what was to prevent me from do- ing the same? "I resolved to act, and when the superior had left the chapel for his bed, I took- a candle that stood on the altar, and conm- menced my discoveries. I raised the trap door,and made the descent; but-I was almost inclined to abandon the search, wh1en, I saw before me the remains of the dead. But I reasoned myself out of all fear, and continued my investigations until the door was found, and I stood where we now stand.' "Antonio extinguished his light as-he uttered those words, and a few more steps led-- us to what I supposed was a door ; but the darkness was so intense that I could distinguish nothing. I heard my companion slip a bolt, and then we stepped out into the open air, outside the college walls, and free from observation. The outlet of the passage-way was so contrived that a person miaht make a strict search for the door,-and yet be unable to find it un- less he had passed out that way and knew its exact locality.  "Antonio deposited his lamp where he could find it when we re- turned, and then we started on our adventures, the college clock tolling the houlr of ten just as we arrived outside of the grounds.' "' What a joke it would be to set fire to the whole concern!' suggested my friend, as we stopped and looked at the college, silent and dark like its old superior.  "It would be much better to run away and become soldiers' I replied. "'And be returned bound like cattle,' sneered Antonio. ' No, no; before we were gone a week we should be overtaken and brought back, and then the treatment we should receive would. be none of the mildest. No, no; I  don't run away as Iont as I can raise money and enjoy myself outside. I think that I can manage to pass away the three years of my probation in an agree- able manner, and after I am a priest, an ordained one, I can do pretty near as I please, especially if I am placed beyond the reach of superiors. No, Benventuro; don't run away, because such an act would be disgraceful, not only to yourself, but to the great society which we have sworn to support.' )' "I had my private opinion respecting the'theory of his disgrace-   THE PRIEST'S- 5TORY.        215 ful acts, but I did not state it, as I was too overjoyed to breathe the free air of heaven to argue with him. I was intoxicated with delight at the novelty of my position, and I could hardly refrain from shouting my joy, and bringinng upon us the wrath of the sentinels stationed at the corners of the streets. Our first course was steered directly for a fonda, where we - could satisfy our ap. petites and quench our thirst. We entered the place, and found that it was thronged with visitors- senoritas and senors of every age and description in life; virtuous women, and those not quite so prudish; libertines and impotent rakes, coxcombs and cuck- olds, all mixed together, and sipping their coffee and wine with a fieedom that was charming to behold. "I would have preferred a seat where I could have watched the company and remained unseen, but Antonio was not one of the retiring sort. He swaggered into the grand saloon with the air of a general, andshouted, outut his orders to the waiter in such a manner that he soon had half a dozen of them standing around our table, waitinogin respectful silence for orders. And the orders were not slow in being issued. One was told to bring eggs fried in butter, another chickens cooked in oil and covered with grated garlic,'a third was started for two bottles of wine, while a fourth was despatched for fruit and vegetables. O, we had a rare feast that night, and I have- often looked back upon my exploits in the gastronomic line that eventful evening with envy, for everything was relished; I had. digestion and good appetite- two things which I am sorry to say are somewhat impaired at; this late day ; and now if I worry down a piece of chicken and drink a glass of wine, I think that I am doing very well." Allen exploded with laughter, and even Tom and myself were forced to join him, the idea was so preposterous:; for had we not seen the padre an hour before eat to repletion; and drink wine enough to float a small banco? Benventuro, apparently, did not expect us to believe himi, for he smiled- freely as he emptied a, bottle of claret and lighted a fresh cigar.  "Go on with the yarn," Alilen said; " but please to confine your- self to facts, not fancies. This is not the age of romances." The holy father took not the slightest notice of the interrupt tion. He puffed out volumes of smoke from his sensual-looking mouth, and continued:-          ,       : "Of course all eyes were upon us, for itwas: something- unusual:   216       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES4. for two youths to expend so much money upon a single entertain- ment; but Antonio's sangfroid never for an instant deserted him. He inspected the wine by the light of the chandeliers, and after sipping it, condescended to call it good, much to the relief of an old servant, who stood at his elbow; and after we htad sati fiel the first pangs of our hunger, we beoan to loolk around anld llnadmie the female falces present. Presently Antonio sent two glcasses of wine, with our respects, to two young lhadies who seemed desirous of obtaining, protectors. Thle wine was accepted, and thanks re- turned. Then my firiend proffered a present of fruit, asd that was likewise gratefiully, received. Then we sent a-n invitation -for them to partake of coffee at our table, and they did not reject tile overture. We found them to be very intelligrent girls, fond of company and show, and we readily offiered thhem our protection home, which was accepted without much maidenly difficlence. "C AVe paid our bill and left, but not until, the proprietor had in- formed us that a masked ball was to be held at the fonda in two weeks' time, and that oul patronage was solicited. Of coulrse we promised to come, and then, givincg the girls oulr arrms, we sallied out for thleir homnes, laughing and joking on the way; but at three o'clock in the morning we entered the secrlet passage andcl ained oullr rooms unperceived, and without a soul in the building suspect- in b that we 1had been absent. "The next day we rather drooped over our studies, but we at- tributed it to a slight incdisposition ; so no notice was taken of our sleepy looks. I was anxious to make another attempt the velry next night, but Antonio refused to consent, and persuaded me to save my money until the night of the masked ball, when he promised that I should see fiun enough to last mel for a xnontlhl. I could hardly contairn myself to wait so long; but Antonio found a- ready arguament when, he said that our money wrould soon be exhausted by going, out twice a week, and thatt we should attlract suspicion by writing to friends for more. ' I counted the days impatiently until the time arrived when we were once more to go forth into the world, and mingle in its pleasures and avoid its pains. At lenth the night did arrive, and with a heart-swelling withi promised rapture, we stole thlrougrh the chapel and sought the hidden door; but to our surprise we found that some one had been before us and had evidently passed throuch the vault to the outer world. For a moment we hesitated whether *          '  *    THE PRIEST S S3TORY.        217 we should venture; but a love of the good things of this life con- quered all fear of detection, and in another moment-we were with the dead, and our pale light flickered in the humid air. We found the vault door open, as we expected; but Antonio took a skeleton key with himn, which he declared would open the lock, even if the priest, who had gone before us, should return first to the college. "I must confess that I felt a little uncomfortable with the thoulht of detection before me; but Antonio strove to banish all apprehensions,"and by the timrne we reached the f6nda, he had nearly succeeded. A few glasses of wine did more than his words, and after a hearty supper I felt as though I could encounter 'the superior and all his aids single-handed." "You must have been quite drunk by the timne you arrived at that conclusion," remarked Allen, interruptingc the good man. 'Exhilarated, my son, nothing more," Benventuro replied; "' there is quite a distinction between the two words, and I beg that you will remember them when conversing with a member of the church. Let me see - where was I?" "Drunk, or exhilarated," promptly responded Alien, " which- ever you choose." "The music was sounding overhead," the padre continued, "and we could hear the feet of the waltzers as they whirled around the hall, shaking the building and starting the rafters- stirring our young blood w'lh the thought of scenes which our teachers had endeavored to convince us were vain and sinful, but which had intruded upon our minds, during our wakeful hours, as the most profitable pleasure of the world -until we could no longer remain idle. To join the danceit was necessary that we should have costumes; so Antonio called the head waiter for a conference, 'Ah senors,' the old man said, you have spoken just in time. Never since I have been connected with the fonda was there such a demand for costumes aits to-night. All the beauty and fashion of the city are at the ball, and the costumes are as varied as the ages of the ladies. I have but two dresses left, and they are sweet things for a ball-room. They are just suitable for gentlemen of spirit.'  "Produce them,' was Antonio's command.   218       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "The old servant, who had grown fat upon the good fare of the fonda, waddled off, and returned with two costumes and masks, which he proceeded to display. "' Why, these dresses are intended to represent young devils with horns partly grown,' shouted Antonio. "Yes, senor, and capital counterfeits they are. But have no  fear. A priest has blessed them, and showered them with holy water, so that the Evil One can have no control over the wearers. They will create a sensation, senors, among the ladies.' "What were we to do? Refuse the costumes and thus lose the ball, or buy them and have a fine night's enjoyment, frighten- ing old women and nervous young ones. We determined to in. vest, and I had the satisfaction of paying away one of mny doubloons in exchange for dresses which were ugly enough to cause hysterics i with the innocent and convulsions with the wicked.  "We were shown to a private room, and soon donned your new robes, and then marched solemnly and majestically to the ball-room. Our appearance was hailed with roars of laughter from the men and looks of telTor from the women. Way was made for us wherever we went, for none seemed dis- posed to- come in contact with us, however miuch- they might admire us. If any alccosted us, we answered with all the wit that we could command, and sent joke for joke flying to the right or left without regalrd to age or personage. ' Senors,' said a tall mask, dressed like a troubadour, ' your father is anxious to find you. See, he has just entered the ball-- room. "We looked in the direction indicated, and, sure enough, we saw an old devil more ugly and more fantastically dressed than either of us. His horns were near a foot long, and his tail was trailed upon the floor, except when he whisked it around his body or over his shoulder. Our hearts died with envy at the sight, for it seemed as though our glory was gone for the evening. The vast audience applauded the old devil, and left us young ones entirely unnoticed. In this, however, it was but following the custom of all nations, which is to run after novelties. "' Senors,' said a young and beautiful girl, whose beauty had- melted my heart, ' why don't you salute your parent?' t" ('Because,.senora,/ I replied,' he is the father of liars; but            '    "1 THE PRIEST'S STORY.        219 when I tell you that I love you, I wish to forget my relationship, and speak but the truth.' "is that the reason?' she asked, with a laugh. 'I have n whom I know to be, been loved many times and by many men,   om I knew to be deils, but this is the first time that one ever had the courage to appear in his true character. When your horns have grown to a sufficient length, I'll consider of your passion s Till then, adieu. '4 She wased her fan and swept towards the old devil, who was gamlboling and attracting muc1h attention in another part of the halu Antonio, and myself followed her, and when we reached the spot where our respected parent stood, the crowd opened to the right and left for the purpose of eclosing us in a circle. We found ourselves, by these means, face to face with the object of our envy. so Children' cried the people,' advance and salute your father, and ask the news from Hades.' r To my surprise Antonio obeyed. He threw his arms around the neck of the old devil, and embraced him in spite of his op- position to that kind of treatment. The crowd saw the reltitance, and shouted with joy, and urged me to follow the example of nmy brother; and even the young ladyewhose eyes had made so serious an impression upon my heart, accused me of ingratitude in not testifying more affection. I did not stir, Ihowever, until Antonio made me a signal to come to his assistance. "'Our father,' he said, ' has not danced for many years, but he is so pleased at meetin his soilns, that lie desires us to waltz with him. Let us give him a turn around the hall.' - In vain the old devil pleaded that he had no taste for such display. We refused to listen to him, and when the music struck up, we each seized an arm and capered around the room to the intense delight of the spectators, and the great disgust of the per- son who had robbed us of our glory. "'In the name of the saints,' he muttered, let me go, or I'1 curse you. Brats that you are, what mean you by this treat- ment? ' "'Our father is old' cried Alntonio, 'and needs new blood. a     -pelican' by giviiother Let us emulate the [pelican by giviln Hberaly from ours. Another turn around the room will fire his veins with renewed ardor for enjoyment on earth. Now, then, away with him!

"We escorted our parent, as we called him, to the dining-room of the fonda, threw aside our masks, and called for all the good things that we could think of, and prepared to make merry. "Come, good devil,' Antonio said, 'doff your mask and enjoy yourself; 'we are friends now, and on an equality.' ' That I amt forbidden to do by a vow which is sacred,' our new friend replied; ' but let not my refusal have any effect upon your appetites. The young devils rule to-night; to-morrow the old one will have his turn.'- "The words were uttered so sarcastically that they attracted my attention, and- I looked to the old man for an explanation."' "Most holy father," interrupted Allen, " we are within a mile of Santa Mesa. Already I can see the smoke issuing from the engine chimney ; yet you are so mixed up with the devil and hand- some women, that I sadly fear we shall never hear the termina- tion of your wonderful adventures. Cut some of the devils, and drown the women in a generous draught of claret, and then get out of the maze which surrounds you like a veil of brimstone." '6 Your advice relating to the wine is sound," Benventuro re- plied, C' and I approve of it; but do you think that a man can cut a story short, or reel it off like one of your ropes, manufactured to order? You stick to your hemp, which you will reap the benefit of one day, and leave me to deal with the -" "Devil, who will have you at no -distant time," Allen ex- claimed. "The saints forbid," was the pious exclamation. '"Because I associate with profligates and libertines in the hope of saving them, is it a reason why I should. be condemned? The saints never intended that I should labor for such a bad reward." "Well," replied Allen, lighting a fresh cigar, " we are even on- personalities. Now go on with the yarn, and pay out at a rapid: rate until the whole is completed." The priest nodded, and continued his story:- "The remark of the old devil was certainly suspicious; for what   221' THE PRIEST'S STORY. did he m ean by saying that, if we triumphed to-day he would to- morrow? I asked for an explanation, but our father in sin aid ot seell disposed to give one, and rather treated our offers of friendship in a disdainful manner."

"We drew a long breath, expressive of great relief, when his form was no longer in sight; but the old devil had dashed our spirits, and we ere in no mood for revelry just then.

't ' Why, you know that a man cant be a Jesuit unless lie serves a master, and I know that you have none too many friends to thus quarrel with them.' "I thought that Satan smothered a laugh, arid it gave me courage to hope that Antonio and his tact would yet save us. "' Do you know me? ' the devil inquired. "'Not if you wish to remain unknown,' was the prompt answer. "And you think that even if I should punish you as you deserve for this night's exploits, you would never mention my ame? ' our questioner continued. ' ' Your secret will not be known, and we shall escape punish- ment,' Antonio said, promptly. - ; How so? ' "Because your life is in our hands. WIVe are young, active, and armed, while you are old and weak, and none to heed your cries'within hearing. We have learned enougSh of Jesuitism to understand that the first law of the institution is self-preservation. We shall obey that law, sure.' }  ' Why, you young devils! would you murder me in cold blood?' demanded our new acquaintance more in surprise than alarm. "We should dislike the task; but if forced to save ourselyes a by that act, we should do so, and none in the college would be thie wiser. A Jesuit can keep a secret, as you well know.' ' " You know me, then?  ' the masquerader asked. " ( I do-you are Father Vider, the superior of the college,' was Antonio's reply.                / "I was astonished, and well I might be, for the superior was nearly sixty years of age, and the last man in Cadiz whom I should have suspected of visiting balls, and playing the prank 'of youth and hot blood.                 /: "' You h hae guessed rightly-I I am the superior;; and off   224       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES., tumbled the hideous head, horns, and mask, and revealed the thin, wrinkled, and dark features of Father Vider. I could hardly refrain from falling upon my knees, and begging for forgiveness; for I had become so accustomed to his rule that I dreaded his rebuke. '" ' Are we to be treated as children, or as rebellious students?' demanded Antonio, as bold as a bishop. "' As children, with my forgiveness, if nothing is said regard- ing this night's adventures,' the superior replied. ' Then swear it upon the cross which you wear around your neck, and which has been blessed by the pope.' "The superior hesitated for a moment, to see if he could not avoid the oath; but finding, that Antonio was resolute, he con- sented; and then we knew that we could trust him. s' Throw off your dresses,' he said, I and go to bed, for it's near the hour of early mass, and I would not have the inmates of the college know of this adventure. To prevent such scenes in future, I shall have the entrance to the vault secured, and thus stop ingress or egress by this route.' "'But how will you manage when you wish to visit the city during -the hours of night?' asked Antonio, with bold audacity. "' That is none of your business,' was the tart answer. "'But hlow shall we manage?' demanded my friend. "' If you are discreet, I shall give you a day's liberty once a l fortnight. Now to bed, and remember the scenes of this night as though they were a dream.' ' We obeyed without a murmur; still I had some mnisgivings that the superior would punish us some way or other; and he did, but a little different from what we expected; for in the course of three months Antonio and myself were pronounced competent to receive priests' orders, and we were duly ordained, and then de- spatched in different directions. Antonio was sentto Rome, where he is engaged to keep watch upon the pope and cardinals, while I was provided for at Manila; and here I have remained:  ever since, doing as little as possible, except in the eating and drinking line; but I believe that is all the archbishop cares for,-  and if lie is satisfied, I am." "Did the superior ever allude to the adventures of that night?"'/ Allen asked. "' Never, in word or deed. Even when he parted from me, and - , -,.   TH:E  .VJ:EL.5T,     U 6TVU., H gave me his blessing, I expected that he would say something; but he did not. I never saw him afterwards. He lived until over seventy years of age, and his name is revered as that of a saint in Cadiz. Hle had his faults, like the rest of us, and like us was anxious to conceal them from the public eye." Just as the. padre concluded his story, the banco reached the side of the river opposite the factory, at Santa Mesa, and we lianded. Can you spare the raen half an hour, Se6or Allen?"Benven- turo asked. ," Certainly."  "I want to send word to my steward to join me here on busi- ness, immediately." "What, the fellow with the black beard and hang-dog express sion to his face?"Allen asked. "I must confess that you have drawn his portrait, although it is not a flattering one. He is the one I mean, and a useful mar he is sometimes," replied Benventuro. ," Especially for a sudden death," whispered Allen to me; but the priest did not hear the remark or see the movement of my friend's lips. We left the priest giving orders to the crew of the boat while we walked slowly towards the house and factory, situated about twenty rods from the landing. At the gate we saw Mr. Huckford, and shook hands with him, presenting Tom in due form. No matter how much company arrived, Mr. Huckford was never disturbed from his accustomed serenity, provided his guests were Americans, or could speak the English language. He gave everry one a hearty welcome, and the best that his house afforded was always freely offered. I' it is still two hours from dinner-time," Ir. Huckford said looking at his watch. "How will you manage until that hour arrives?" Tom decided upon visiting the factory, and learning the myr- teries of rope-making, while I concluded to take a little rest, which I very much needed aftermy night of labor and anxiety; and for that purpose I went to my old quarters, where a net hammock was always kept for me, and where I could lie bnd read, or else watch the river and the many burdens which it bore upon its surface., I had not been alone more than five minutes when Allen entered. 15   226       LIFE IN THE EAST INI)IES. ' Excuse me for disturbing you," he said; 'L but I want to tell you the reason of Benventuro's sending for his steward. He in- tends to despatch him to Manila in search of your wife, and I think that the movement is a good one. The fellow is a precious scoundrel, I know; but the holy father has him in complete sub- jection, and I am sure that he will not dare to work except for his master's advantage. Some good may come of the visit, and at ahy rate, no harim can take place unless Father Juan takes a hint that his steps are watched." "Let him go, by all means," I said, " and any expenses that he incurs I will cheerfully meet." '1 have a young fellow at work in the factory, who was born in Manila, and is well acquainted there. HHe will serve us faiti- fully for money, although I think that he would sell his father for an ounce of gold: In this matter we can trust him, for it will Je for his interest to be honest. Besides, he knows your wife by sight, having often seen her here while visiting. If you think it expedient, I will engagre his services for a week, and send him off this very afternoon to commence the search." I had no objections to the course which Allen suggested-; and we concluded to start both men for Malnila that afternoon, with instructions to send us information, if there was any of importance, ttw ice a day, or to report themselves at my city residence in the evening, between the hours of seven and nine o'clock, when they ,could enter withofit observation, and talk at leisure. Allen left me to complete his arrangements, and I fell asleep, ;during which I dreamed that my wife had quarrelled with my protegee, Gracia, and swallowed her whole as easily as though she had the flexible muscles and good digestion of a boa con- strictor. I imagined that I attempted to prevent the gluttonous act, and that I even seized Gracia by her feet and tried to pre- vent her disappearing from sight; but while I was pulling first one way and then the other, Teresa kicked me with such force that I was compelled to cry aloud for assistance. "Hallo! what is the matter with you?" some one asked, shak- ing me most violently by the shoulder. I started up, rubbed my eyes, and saw that Father Benventuro was standing over me.    * "I have been: in the room for three minutes," he said, "watch-   ing your struggles while asleep. What is the matter with you? Have you been dreaming of earthquakes or snakes? 2 "Pardon me," I replied; "I was dreaming of anacondas, and I thought that one had got hold of me." "That is not very complimentary to me, for I never show such snake-like propensities except at the dinner table. And speaking of dinner reminds me that I was sent to inform you that that important meal is on the table, and we are waiting for you. Come, dip your face in this bowl of cool water, and take some of the fever out of it, and be sure that you retire early to-hight. They may urge you to drink stoutly; but it is a vile habit, so you can conscientiously refuse. Imitate me in that respect if you can. I know that it is difficult, but be firm and-refuse." With this advice the priest left me, and I dressed for dinuer, considerably refreshed by my sleep, yet feeling far from easy in my mind, when I thought of my wife, and considered where she was hidden by the treacherous Father Juan.  - The dinner passed off as all dinners usually do, where a por- tion of the company is disposed to talk, and other portions remain quiet listeners. The priest was profuse in his remarks, and told some wonderful and startling adventures concerning himself the night before; and I think that on the whole he actually believed what he said. The deeper he drank the more astonishing were the sacrifices which he had made while saving some imaginary person from being crushed by a falling wall, or drowned by the rushing tide. Those present listened to him highly amused, and only ventured to contradict when he went beyond all reason. - "GCome," said Allen, addressing me, " let us take a few hours' ride on horseback this evening, while the rest of the company can remain at the table, or follow our example. We shall have a full moon at eight o'clock, and the cool air will be delicious as it sweeps down from the mountains and crosses the river. Who will go witlh us?" NIot I," said the padre, " as long as I can find a companion to drink with." "And I prefer to increase my knowledgye of Spanish to being skinned on a hard-trottiing horse," Tom answered. Mr. Huckford agreed to remain at home and attend to business, aud in a few minutes Allen and myself were supplied with horses, and trotting leisurely in the direction of a. village which is about   ,228       LIFE IN THE EAST, INDIES. five miles from Santa Mesa. The place is much frequented by merchants, who do business in Manila, on account of the cool, clear water which flows through the village, affording unrivalled facili- ties for bathing, and because the nights are unusually cool, and the air free of insect/ - two things which invite slumber and comfort, and which cannot he had in the city. c; It is now seven o'clock," said Allen, consulting his watch. "We can visit the village, bathe in the clear, cold waters of the river, and back again to the factory by nine. Touch your horse with the whip, and let's see which has got the most speed." In a few seconds our slow pace was changed to a gallop, and as the animals were fresh and eager for the fun, we went over the ,ground at a rapid rate, and did not draw rein until we were in the :heart of the' village, and every one in town was tagging at our heels, as though they had not seen a stranger for a twelvemonth. 'The noise brought many of the natives to their doors; but after one stoical stare they retreated to their hammocks, and com- menced chewing betel-nut with renewed vigor. We rode to the bathing-pool; but before we could dismount, a little girl, whose costume was fashioned after that of Mother Eve, excepting the fig leaf, came towards us with her arms filled with grass-cloth towels, and begged our acceptance of the same; and after we alighted, a Mestiza took the bridles -of our horses, loosened the girts, and rubbed them down with wisps of grass and the husks of cocoa-nuts. 4' What a polite, paft of the country we have reached!"I said to Allen; but he only laughed, and made preparations for the swim.  The little girl squatted down upon the bank of. the river, and seemed to watch our movements with some curiosity; so I thought that I would give her notice that her company was not wanted, until our bathing was completed.  To my surprise, however, the little wretch took no notice of my hints, and I was compelled to: suspend operations, although   Allen did not.  -s Go away, little girl," I said; "and don't come again for half an hour."                            i a What f6r, senor?" she asked.                 a' Because. I am about to. swim," I answered.  "I know it, senor," she replied, with composure.    CHAIRMNG .SIMPLICITY. -* "And you won't move?"I askeld. "No, senor; I must stay and watch the towels." Here was the cause of the difficulty; and while I was some. what mortified that our honesty should be questioned, Allen laughed so heartily that le was compelled to suspend operations until he grew more composed. "Wblhy, I thought the girl was too honest to suspect dis- honesty," I said.  Then, to prevent you from judging hastily hereafter, study the motives of people; " and with this sage advice Allen dove from a rock like a duck, and rolled over and over in the cool water like a mermaid:    :"Come on," he shouted; " the water is perfectly delicious." "But this girl; what shall I do with her?"I asked. "Why, give her a real, and she will show how much better she can dive, than either of us, -and how much faster she can SWi*m."  I declined the proposition, and as nothing that I could say would induce the girl to move, I thanked Heaven that the moon was not up, and that the sun had set; so in a moment I cast my clothes aside, and modestly plunged into the water. As far as I could tell, the girl did not seem much shocked at the outrage, and oc- cupied her time, while we were swimming, in sucking the sweet milk from a cocoa-hut. For half an hour we sported in the water, and then judiciously used the grass-cloth towels belonging to the girl. By the time we had concluded, she had finished: her nut, gathered up the napkins, and then led the way slowly towards the house; "Where are we going now?"I: asked of Allen. "For coffee and cigars," he replied;. "This, then, is a hotel?"I said, pointing to the bamboo hut before us. "It is what they call a hotel in this part of the country, and a very good one they think it is, too. All foreigners who come here to bathe, stop at the hut for towels' and coffee, and if. it dont- have anything else that is good, you can always be sure of a strong, clear cup of :coffee, the berry of which was grown within a few rods of us, and towels of their own, manufacture. But come and contrast this watering-place hotel with the houses at, Newport and Fort Henry."     .   '    2230       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. We entered the hut, and found the owner, with his wife and several children, squatted around a huge wooden dish filled with rice; and the rapid manner in which they made it disappear was wonderful to behold. CHAPTER   IX. THE INN. - OUR COFFEF,. - THE AMBUSH. - THE ATTACK.-ITS, FAILURE. -  THE EXAMNATION. ---THE RESULT. "' THE saints have you in their keeping, senors," cried the land- lord, as we entered the rather dimly-lighted room, which was too modest to even boast of a loor, for the hard earth had been lev- elled and beaten into-service, and had the advantage of not requir- ing washing or repairing.  "May the saints protect you and yours," was the rejoinder of Allen, as we took seats upon a bamboo bench, and watched the progress of the meal. "Will the senors partake?" cried the husband, opening his mouth to receive a  ball of rice which he had skilfully collected with three fungers.    ' He threw back his head as he spoke, and the rice, about the size of a grape shot, was hurled into his mouth with wonderful precision. "Heaven forbid," Icried hastily, with a look of disgust at the numerous black and dirty paws which were-thrust into the mess; and every one of which was imitating the older to the bestof its ability. " e  thank you, we have already dined," Allen hastened to add; and then he spoke in English to me.  It is not always policy to show the disgust that you feel at an invitation to dine with a Mestizo. He asks us to eat friom motives of the purest courtesy, and you must, in this country, decline with the same grace with which an invitation is extended. These people have never eaten or been taught to eat with spoons, or knives and forks, and they consider them as useless as some of   - A MESTIZO MEAL.        -231 our countrymen seem to think butter-knives are. Some Amueri- 'cans, you well know, are none too clean at the table, or at their work ; so don't despise these natives for doing what their grand- fathers did before them. I felt rebuked, and no longer regarded the group with disgust, but with interest. All were fair and impartial at the bowl. Even the smallest children had as free a chance at the rice as the largest boy, and an infant was only rebuked when it attempted to crawl into the vessel, and cover itself with the food. And the rebuke was received without a murmur from the little one. There was no yelling with passion, and compromises by allowing even a foot to remain in the bowl to keep the young one quiet. The M3estizos are too sensible for that, and I don't think that dur- ing my whole stay on the island I ever heard a child indulge in a- protracted cry, or give way to such gusts of passion as are com- mon with European or American children. Yet they receive not half the attention, and are allowed to herd with the dogs and chase the chickens at leisure. Their life, until they are ten years of age, is one of freedom from medicine and schools. Once or twice a day'they are taken to the river, washed, and taught to swim; and they take to the water as readily as ducks. Their fondness for it they never forget, and even the workmen,- who toil from daylight till dark, will seek the river' after the fatigues of the day, and refresh their bodies with a swim. "Where is the coffee you promised me? ' I asked of Allen, tir- ing at length of seeing the family devour their rice. 'l That will be here when the landlord has completed his meal, and not before," replied my friend. "The hosts of this country are as independent as in America; although here they are to be seen occasionally, while at home they are not known except to newspaper correspondents. Have patience, for I see that my friend begins to falter, as though he is nearly filled. A few more balls, and he will be finished and ready to serve us." The result proved that Allen's surmises were correct. The head of the family sighed, then watched his young ones for a few minutes, as they continued to throw the rice- into their mouths with renewed ardor, and at length arose and stood before us. - " Senors," he said, "what shall I serve you with?" "Are you sure that you have done eaating?"Allen 'asked. - "Quite sure senors ; I m as full now; as a sugarsack.' : r2:wits a sugar-sai   232       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "4 Then bring us coffee and cigars; and mind that the former is strong and the latter mild. You understand?" '"Of course I do ; have I not kept a hotel from my youth, and Aid not my father keep one before me?" The Mestizo looked as dignified in his shirt and loose trousers, and feet hardened'by constant contact with the earth, as Ameri- can landlords, dressed in fine cloth, patent-leatherboots, and dia- mond pin. Our host clapped his hands, and one of his numerous daughters awaited his commands. "Coffee and cigars for my friends," he repeated. In a few minutes the fragrant beverage made its appearance in large brown-ware cups, manufactured in the country, and used in all the native houses. 6' There," said Allen, " taste and drink coffee for the first time." I did so, and although the coffee was destitute of milk, and was sweetened with coarse brown sugar, yet I never tasted any- thing more delicious. As we drank, a dreaming, half-forgetful feeling took possession of us, and we leaned back and gave full play to the fancies which crowded upon our brains. I }houghlt' that my wife was present, and smiling through the clouds of to- bacco smoke which filled the room from our cigars, and more, than once I was on the point of speaking to her; yet felt that the sound of my voice would dispel the illusion, and she would van,- ish. I could see our host moving about the room, and once he replenished our cups when he found that they were empty, and would have done sd again had not Allen spoke, and thus roused - me from my stupor. "It is time that we. were on our wayJhome," he said. I. looked at my watch, and found that it was within a few min- utes, of eight. "Is it possible that we have been here an hour and a half?"I asked.. 'Al, senor," cried, the Mestizo, "that is but a short time to devote to my coffee. Some gentlemen stay here for hours, and swallow many cupsjand yet go away unsatisfied. You have done very well for new beginners, but I hope to see you both here often." /' Allen slipped a four-real piece in his hand, and the, landlord gave vent to many expressions of gratitude I He escorted us to-: our horses, and wished the saints would. have us in their keeping   THE AMBUSH.           23 n our ride home; and even the younu girl who witnessed our bathing exploits hoped that we would soon return for another swiln. The night wad magnificent, Not a cloud was to be seen inthe- heavens, and the moon looked down upon us with tropical bright- ness. A cool breeze came from the mountains, and the air was so pure and clear that the barking of a vllage do could be heard for miles. We were so enchanted with the scene that we suf- fered our horses' bridles to fall upon their necks, and plodded along at as slow a pace as they pleased. For a few miles we jogged on in silence. Hark!" cried Allen, suddenly, sitopping his horse; "I thought that I heard a shrill whstle." c' And I heard the same; but it is not an uncommon event.  The only thing that would surprise :me would be to hear some one whistle Yankee Doodle at this time of niuht. I should certainly think that we were within hailincg distance of a countryman." Alien paid no attention to my remarks, for while I was speak- ing, directly ahead of us,'in a small clump of trees and under- brush a shrill whistle was sounded, and then all was still. "There is a meaning to that," my friend said. "Of course there is," I replied, with a laugh at his serious face. "A Mestizo has lost his dog or his buffalo, and is, searching for them." "our theory is a good one, but I can't believe it. Natives never whistle when looking for cattle, and dogs don't desert their masters. Let us turn from this road, strike across the paddy fields, and leave that cluster of suspicious-looking trees far in the rear. The hour is late, and few travellers of respectability are abroad at this time."                " "Still thinking of native treachery and assassination, I said, laughing. ", Do you suspect that there is a Mestizo within ten miles of us who would dare to come within range of our revol- vers this bright night? Let us keep the road, and only leave it after our pistols are empty." ' O, if you have your pistol with you, that is a different thing," remarked Allen. "I left mine at the house by accident, and I: thought you were as bad off as myself. Come on, but be careful how you aim." ,  ,    234       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. He started his horse, but the aspect of affairs had undergone a sudden change, arid I began to feel a doubt of our security. "Wait one moment," I said; " while I was speaking so boldly I imagined that you were the person who was armed, and to your valor I was willing to trust myself. It seems that you have been as careless as I, and ventured out unarmed. Now, I am not natu- rally of a suspicious disposition, but if you have no objections we will adopt your suggestions and cut across the paddy fields. By that means we may save our throats from close contact with a knife." To my surprise Allen did not seem to heed me. In fact he allowed his horse to trot slowly towards the brush, and as I did :not want to be left alone, I struck my animal a, light blow with my heavy ridingc-whip, one end of which was loaded with lead, and in three seconds was alongside of him. "I thought that you were in favor of the paddy fields," I -re- marked. "So I was until my curiosity got aroused, and now I am de- termined to see if there is design in that whistle. If a party of ladrones ip around, they will keep at a respectful distance.. But if others -- He did not have time to say more, for just at that moment we entered the wood, and before our animals were concealed by the trees, I heard a rustling noise in the bushes, and forth sprang two tall Mestizos with long knives in their hands. The natives jumped towards my horse's head, and one laid a hand upon my bridle. The animal, surprised at the movement, reared and swerved, and, luckily for me, in the direction of the Mestizo who had not touched my bridle; for the latter, with as good will as:  ever saw depicted upon the face of mortal, aimed a blow at me with his knife, that just grazed my left leg, and struck the pom- mel of the saddle. The villain intended the cut for my heart, and nothing but the movement of the horse disarranged his well- meant plans. I was somewhat surprised, but did not lose all my presence of mind. I ha4 seen the gleam of the knife in the moonlight, and tried to avoid the blow, but the Mestizo was too quick for me. Hardly, however, had his knife touched the saddle than I had raised my riding-whip, and with a full swing I let the loaded part fall upon the ruffian's shoulder. The blow. fell heavily, and I   THE .ATTACK*          285 heard a crushing sound, that told of broken bones and bruised flesh. The fellow uttered a furious oath, and called to his compan- ion to stab quick and fly; to do him justice, th: latter's intentions were good enough, for he flourished his knife most wickedly, and then directed it towards me with a swing that told of much prac- tice in that particular line; but I had no notion of making my body a target; and, as I found that my horse could not move quick enough, I vacated my saddle by slipping off;, and hardly had I touched-the ground before the animal made a sudden spring, snorted wildly, and then I heard a sound like running water, and with a quiver'the beast fell to the ground. The blow that was aimed at my head had pierced the horse. t Valmose!" shouted the fellow whose Shoulder I had disabled, turning his back, and starting to run towards the paddy fields., "Not till I have had a clip at you," I heard Allen shout; and looking up saw that he had dismounted, and was swinging his riding-whip, similar to mine, over his head. Then I heard a blow that seemed to have crushed as it fell, and one of the midnight assassins dropped and groaned as though he was' badly hurt. "Don't let the other escape!" shouted: Allen, starting after him on the full run, followed by myself. We dashed throulgh a quantity of underbrush, and then caught sight of the fugitive ruining at good speed over the paddy fields, in the direction of the river, where lie undoubtedly had a banco concealed. 'We are gaining on him," shouted Allen, putting on more speed, and jumping over the small ridges which mark all paddy fields for the purpose of holding the water; and then for ten minutes we continued the pursuit, until we could hear the wretch pant as he laboredl along, and struggled for breath. ("Ho, ladrone! stop, or we will kill you as you run," my friend exclaimed; but the Mestizo was cunning enouugh to know that if we had had pistols we should have used theim before; so he mere- ly glanced over his shoulder to see how near we were to him, and was about to redouble his exertions, when his foot caught a, vine, and down he wents falling heavily. ]He sprang, to his feet in an instant; but by this time we were upon him, and a cut across the face, that started drops of blood, and left a livid ridge upon his cheeks, once more caused him to: fall upon the ground, I           i   236       LIFE IN THE EAST -INDIES. where he lay and prayed for mercy, as only a Mestizo defeated in his infernal plans can. "Dog!-what prompted you to attempt our assassination?" Psouted Allen, plying his whip with hearty good will upon the form of the fallen man. "Mercy, senor, and I will tell you all!" the wretch .exclaimed, seeking to avoid the blows. Allen suspended his punishment, and allowed the Mestizo to stand upon his feet, first taking the precaution to see that his knife was gone. "What was your object in thus seeking our lives?"- Allen asked, as we led the way to the scene of the outrage, having tied the fellow's hands behind him, with our pocket handkerchiefs, to prevent his escape. "Ah, senor, we were directed not to molest you unless you in- terfered in our work," was the answer. -"And did you suppose that I should stand by and see you butcher my friend without offering my aid?" demanded Allen, indignantly. "We were t61d that such would be the case, senor," answered the fellow, meekly. "Ladrone, you are not speaking the truth," said Allen, fiercely, "By the saints I am, senor," answered the, fellow, with appar- ent sincerity. "And you expected to kill my frield--did you?"Allen asked. We were in hopes that we should, senor," answered the fel- low, with a degree of candor that surpassed all belief. "What harm have I done that you should seek my life?"I asked, scanning the man's features to see if I had ever met with him before. His countenance was not familiar, and I was com- pelled to entertain an impression that Father Juan had set the men upon my track for the purpose of carrying out the great scheme, which he had long entertained, of inducing my wife to resign her property and enter his convent. "You have never injured us, senor; but there is a person in Manila who thirsts for your blood; you have crossed him in some way, and he never forgets an injury." "His name?" demanded Allen, confronting the fellow. "That, senor, I can't divulge."    A REVELATION OR DEATH.       237 "Then you have your choice of a speedy death by pistol or hanging from the limb of a tree. Think quick, and give us an answer." "Youl don't think of carrying your threats into execution?" I asked in English; " let us surrender themi to the law, and let the law deal with them." T"The law is a humbug, and you will think so if you ever have occasion to invoke its aid," Allen answered. c' I intend to make this fellow reveal all that lie knows, and yet I shan't harm him a great deal, as you will confess. I think that, I know who set them on, and if my suspicions are realized, we shall hold a trump card." The Miestizo looked first at Allen and then at myself, while we were talking, as if he were endeavoringt to comprehend the mean- ing of our words. He seemed to think that we were in earnest with our threats, for he answeredoin a resigned tone, - "I can die; but I will not reveal the name of the person who engagaed us." "Then die you shall," was the only answer that Allen made, and we walked on in stern silence till we reached the scene of the struggle, where lay the dead horse, and the uninjured one stand- ing over him, as though grieving for his loss. Allen secured the animal, and then we looked for the body of the villain whose shoulder I had smashed with my whip. To our surprise. he had vanished, and this elicited'a chuckle from the prisoner. "Ah, Antonio is tough, senors, and the arm must 'be strong that can make an impression upon him. He has- escaped, but I can find him if paid for it."' The wretch was all ready to sell his comrade for gold, and a small sum at that. "He can't be far off," Allen remarked.' ( Take a portion of the bridle from your horse, and tie this fellow, and then we will search for the missing. one. He is probably concealed in the underbrush, for no man could travel far after receiving such -blows, unless his frame is made of cast iron." We secured our prisoner to a tree, disbelieving his protesta- tions that he would not attempt to escape-; then we examined the place where the ladrone had fallen. We saw that he had made several attempts to get on his feet, but he had not succeeded-; for -...    238       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. we found a trail in the dust where he had crawled on his hands and feet towards the brush by the side of the road, and a few. steps brought us upon the fellow, his face covered with blood, and a large gash upon his head, that did not look promising for his speedy recovery. He was nearly insensible, and as there was not the slightest danger of his leaving the place in a hurry, we left Dim and returned to the other prisoner, who had suffered no harm beyond smashing the bones of his right shoulder. "My comrade has escaped," the prisoner, still bound to the tree, exclaimed, when he saw us return so soon. "I told you that his head was hard, and that no impression could be made upon it." "You are mistaken," Allen answered, quite composedly, with- out even looking at the man. "Your brother assassin is nearly dead, and probably before morning he will cease to live." "Dead - dying!" echoed the fellow, apparently astonished at the intelligence. -  I-e remained silent for a few moments, end then spoke: -  "If he is dying money can be of no use to him. Won't you just search his pockets, and bring me the doubloon that you will find there. It is mine by right, for he lost that amount of money to me by betting on a cock-filht yesterday." "You can see how much love one Mestizo has for another," Allen remarked in English, while busily arranging some portions of the bridles by knotting them together. We paid no attention to the request of our prisoner, although two or three times he repeated his demand that we would be kind enough to hand him the money found in the pockets of his com- rade. At length our silence and proceedings seemed to strike the Mestizo with a mysterious feeling, which he tried to banish by humming a song that was very popular, in those days, with all classes of the community; but his eyes followe'd our movements, nevertheless. '.' Senors," he asked, '( what do you intend to do with me"?" We returned no answer, but threw one end of the bridles Over the limb of a tree, and made a slip-noose with'the other. "Senors," continued our prisoner, his assurance gradually de- serting him, " if you let me escape, I will never raise a hand against you again." "We don't intend you shall," Allen remarked. "In a short rr L UVLI U LILILIU  YVLI (3LlklD   FORCING A SECRET.        239 time you will be in the other world; so, if you have any prayers to address to the saints, you had better begin them." "You will not dare to kill me?" asked the fellow.  Why should we not serve you in the same manner that you attempted to serve us? We must learn who paid you for thus assaulting us, or we must have your life)" was the quiet answer; and Allen tested the strength of the gallows by swinging on it for a moment. "Why, senors, would you have me damued for revealing my secret?" "' We care not whether you are damned or blessed; we will linow who hired you," I remarked. ' Senors, I cannot tell,'" was the decided answer. "I am fearful that we shall have to pinch his throat a little," Allen said in English. " -But don't be alarmed," he continued, "4 even if you see him strangle; he won't die without giving us the information that we seekl." Alien untied his horse, and led him in front of the Mestizo.  Cast off all his bonds excepting those which confine his hands," my friend said. I did as directed. The prisoner looked wild, and stared first at my friend and then at myself. t"Now mount the horse," Allen ordered; but the Mestizo was unable to do so, owing to his hands being tied. I stepped behind him, and lifted him upon the animal's back. "Ah! you intend to carry me to the city - do you?" the fellow asked, his confidence returning. We did not venture an answer, but backed the horse until the: bridle, suspended from the tree, touched the man's head. He looked up, and saw the noose dangling over him; but even then he had some thought that we were only frightening him. He tried to smile, but the attempt was a wretched one. "Senors," he said, " you -had better take me to the city; or give me your horse, and I'll go alone. I know the way by land as well as by water." Allen made no answer. He merely took the noose and -dropped: it over the man's head, and then pulled it tight around his neck. The fellow's eyes for the first time began to express the terror. which he felt.   240       LIFE, IN THE EAST INDIES. "What do you intend to do?" he gasped, struggling to with- draw his hands from the bandages. '"Only hang you. Keep perfectly quiet, and you will experi- ence an unknown sensation in a few seconds. I don't think it will hurt you much," Allen remarked, lighting a cigar and hand- incg me one, for the purpose of making the fellow think that we were remarkably cool about the execution. "Senors," cried the Mestizo, after a moment's pause, ' I am not fond of sensations. Why won't you let my comrade, who is half dead, hang instead of me. He is of no use to the world, while I have two daughters' in Manila. They will mourn for me." ' What are their names?" I demanded, prompted to ask the question by a feeling which I could not control. "Sara and Gracia," was the answer. Herewas a confession. We were about to hang, in jest, the father of my new protegee, whom I had picked up near the Morrgue. It was evident that he did not know that his eldest daughter was dead, and I was not disposed to enlighten him in relation, to the matter. '- We are very sorry to be compelled to hang you," Allen re- marked, after I had explained in English the true position of affairs; " but our future safety requires that you should die, or disclose the names of the parties who incited you to commit the crime of murder. You have but a minute to live. Call upon the saints in season, for it's the last time that you can address them." "I can't reveal, senors," was the answer. Allen touched the horse, and the animal stepped forward a few feet, sufficient to bring the noose tight around the neck of the Mestizo. "Hold on," he gasped; I'll tell all, if you will save my life." "Go on with your confession, then," Allen remarked,.  But remove the rope first," the Mestizo pleaded. "No ; what you have to confess must be said as you are. ,We have gone to considerable trouble for the purpose of hanging you comfortably, and we had little rather do it than save your life at this late hour. But even now, if you don't tell the truth, your neck is not worth the price of a betel nut," "Then swear, senors, that my life shall be spared, and I'll tell   A CONFESSION.         241 all,"' the Mestizo cried, glad to make terms when he really sup- posed thatt we preferred his life to a confession. 1' You have the word of two gentlemen. We do not bind our- selves with oathls," was Allen's reply.  Well, then, please give me a cigar," the Mestizo said, with characteristic impudence. I handed the fellow a cigar, when he lighted it and adjusted it to his mouth with considerable precision, and then commenced his confession. "This forenoon, senors, a man applied to us, and wanted to know if we desired a ogood job. We were lying in our banco at the time, opposite the European Hotel, waiting for passengers. I answered that we were always ready to earn money, provided we could do it honestly. Our visitor did rnot seem pleased with the reply, and at length iny comrade said that he never re- fused a job of any kind. The stranger smiled at this, and asked us to follow him a short dlistance, so we could talk with- out fear of being overheard. He led the way to a wine shop, and called for drink, and we did not hesitate to swallow all that he set before us. Why should we, as long as he paid for it? and he seemed to have plenty of money. At length the stranger handed to us a doubloon, and said that two more would be given us if we obeyed his orders. We took the monrey eagerly, and then asked what the job was. We were told that it was necessary for the good of the church that a heretic should die, and that, if we committed the deed, the saints would not only pardon, but bless us. I asked who the person was, and the stranger said that he was an American, endeavoring to datlnn people's souls by converting them to Protestantisml. Then I felt that we should be justified in killing, and my comrade seemed to be of my way of thilnking. We asked to see the one we were to despatch, and the stranger said that he would point him out to us when the time arrived. Then we drank more wine, and swore that we would kill not only the person whomr the stranger desired we should killi but everybody else who had offended him, and yet retain his secret. You see, senors, we were not thinki:ng of the ropes around our necks, or the heavy blows which you deal out with whip- handles, Caramba! you have broken thel bone in my shoulder, and my comrade's head'- two things we did not expect.' - i:, Go -onwith your confession,' Allen said, :sternly. 16   242       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. '( St, senor," the fellow answered, more humbly, and con- tinued : ' We were told to go on board of our. banco again, and push up the river a short distance and wTait there, concealed from ob- servation by some bushes. The stranger went with us, and this afternoon a banco passed us, on board of which were a priest and three gentlemen. You, senor (pointing to Allen), we knew by sight, but the other two were strangers to us. You (nodding to me) was the one we were to kill, and we were strictly charged not to fail, even if we had to wait a week to accomplish the job. The saints be praised," the hypocrite continued, we failed in our designs." "Then you followed us to the factory-did you?"Allen asked. "Of course--we never lost sight of you except for a few minutes, although you did not see us, for the very good reason that we kept in the background. When you started for the ride, we followed on the same road, certain you would have to return that way; but you came near getting clear, after all." "How so?"I -asked. " Why, when you first appeared in sight, my comrade was some distance from me, looking for stray travellers, and trying a little robbing on his own account. He is a man never satisfied with doing well, but wants to do better. I had to repeat the signal several times before he would attend me. If he had not come, you might have gone clear, for I don't like attacking Euro- peans alone." "Now for another question," Allen said. 'C Who was the man who paid you for attempting to kill my friend?" The Mestizo hesitated, but the horse moved a little and brought the halter tighter around the fellow's throat. "For the saints' sake, don't,"' he gasped, struggling so violently that he but tightened the band, and tortured himself. "The name," demanded Alien, quite cool, and deaf to all his sufferings. "6 Let me but breathe, then," the Mestizo gasped. I touched the horse, and he stepped back a few inches, sufficient to allow the man to move his head. "The saints forbid that I should ever die by hanging," was the fervent prayer. "Tr be are other deaths which are much \'*    A SI&NAL.  ,        243 more to be preferred. The knife, for instance, only inflicts one pang', in the hands of a skilful artist, and then life ebbs away so --quietly that it resembles sleep.. Poison is very good in difficult cases, where the victim can't be got at easily; but it ain't sure, like the knife, since those English and Dutch doctors have settled in Manila. The. knife never fails, if a man will only take the trouble of carrying a whetstone in his pocket. I even prefer it to a pistol.  "Why, you wretch, we did not spare your life to listen to a. long dissertation on murder," I said, although I must confess that I was somewhat amused at the philosophical manner in which he treated the subject; but I had no doubt he was competent to judge, if the number of his crimes was taken into consideration. Allen looked' at his watch, and found that it was near nine o'clock. "We shall be missed at the factory, and they will feel anxious regarding us unless we are honme in a short time," he said. "We can no longer play with this man. He must reveal his secret at once, for at any time we are liable to be surprised by,/a band of prowling ladrones, and they will certainly) rescue this fellow, and make a stand against us; and what could we do without revol- vers?" As I didn't know, I made no answer. "Come," said Alien, turning to the .Mestizo, " we want the name of the party who hired you to assassinate my friend." The scamp was just about to answer and give us the informa- tion, when from the direction of the river was heard a peculiar cry which resembled the 'craw" of a parrot. Our prisoner pricked up his ears and listened eagerly, and to my surprise Alilen did the sanme. "The name," demanded my friend. Instead of' replying, the Mestizo opened his mouth and uttered a shrill 'L craw " which could have been heard, in that calm, moon- light night, for half a mile or more. , " "Dog!" thundered Allen; u' if you make another signal you shall hang by your neck, even if the ladrones are in sight. You can't escape giving us the information. ILet us have it at once." The Mestizo seemed to be paying more attention to the signials from the river than to us. Again we heard the peculiar cry, and this time much nearer to us. The prisoner raised his head, and   244       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. was about to answer, when Alien suddenly started the horse, and the halter was brought tight around the fellow's neck; and instead of producing a craw, he found it somewhat difficult to obtain breath. He struggled fearfully to free 'his arms, but, as before, was unsuccessful. "u The name," cried Allen, making a motion to start the horse, and leave the man dangling in the air. I saw that we had conquered. I could tell by the expression of his face that his stock of fortitude was exhausted, and that he was willing to submit to our wishes. The horse, which per- formed a very important part that night, was backed a few steps, and the halter loosed around the man's neck. "Now, then,l what is his name?" demanded Allen, hurriedly. "Father Juan, of the convent of San Sebastian," was the answer. "Did he give any reason for wishing for mny friend's death?" Allen asked. "Only the reasons which I have stated," was the answer. 4 He said'that you were not only his enemies, but enemies of the church; that the saints would thank us for killing you, and that -for so doing he would grant us full absolution." ' Did he mention the name of a lady, during the conversation?" I: asked, eagerly. "He did not, senor; but the night before -" He stopped suddenly, for at that moment, within a few rods of us, arose the doleful is hoots " which we had noticed before. "' We must make our escape while we can," whispered Allen. - ( A- gang of river ladrones are prowling around, and if they find us so far from the factory, and unaimed, our watches and prob- ably our lives will not be safe. - - ith a couple of revolvers we could scatter them like chaff; but alas! those are safe, like the :Dutchman's anchor, at home." -Oui prisoner was inclined to be jolly at the prospect of a sud- den liberation, for qthough he did not dare to speak a loud word, y;ethehummed his favorite tune, and seemed to flatter himself ,that we should soon change places. 'There was no time to lose, if we meant to escape, for the iadrones must have heard our prisoner's signal, and knew that it proceeded from the only clump of bushes and trees to be seen for two or three miles,-the rest of the ground being covered with     19' t ta   THE LADRONES.          245 paddy fields and grazing tracts. They also knew that there was occasion for their services, or the peculiar signal by which they called each other would never have been given. As the river thieves were all bound together by ties of dishonest brotherhood, it was to be expected that they would help each other fi'om dis- agreeable positions, and revenge ill treatment if in their power. I did not feel much alarmed at our position, for I knew that the scamps seldom carried fire-arms, and that they would be very careful how they approached us, until they fQund out that we were destitute of those very useful articles; and even if they did make the discovery, I was in hopes of keeping them and their knives at a distance by the use of our legs, or our heavy whips. It's no disgrace to run away from a fight, when the enemy muster four or five to one. "What are we to do?"I asked of Allen, who seemed to be deliberating on the matter. "I don't know, unless we hang the fellow, and escape on horse- back. If we leave him here alive, he will tell in which direction we have gone, and join them in pursuit, like a blood-hound that he is.. I don't want to kill the man, and yet I see no other way of leaving this position," my friend remarked. 4 I have it!"I cried. "' Let us tie the fellow upon the horse's back, and start the animal towards the factory at its best speed. The ladrones will give chase, and by that means we may escape.," i; Admirable!" cried Allen. "We could not hit upon a wiser plan. Hold the horse while I tie the fellow's legs under the ani- mal's belly." He took a portion of a bridle, and in a few seconds the Mestizo was secured, although much against his will, and it required a few energetic threats of punishment to keep him still. '6 Now," cried Allen, " let go of the horse, and apply your whip to his hind quarters. Don't be aftraid to strike hard, for on his speed depends our safety." He raised his whip as he spoke, and showered down a number of blows; and I think that, from the yell which I heard, a few of them fell upon the legs of the Mestizo. The horse, unaccustomed to such treatment, reared wildly; but the rider kept his seat, and the next instant the animal dashed along the road leading to the factory at pretty good speed. We   246       LIFE IN"THE EAST INDIES. watched his course but for a moment, and then Allen touched me on the shoulder, and whispered,- "Follow me." I did not wait for a second invitation. With a bound I cleared the road, and alighted in a clump of bushes; .anl just as I alighted, half a dozen men came in sight, and looked eagerly for the person whose signals they had answered. 4' Don't stir for your life," whispered Allen. "The best of the gang has gone in pursuit of the horse, and the rest are searching for booty. They are old hands, or we should be clear of them." It was even as my friend had said, for we could hear the voices of those in pursuit of the horse, away in the distance, and they seemed to be communicating to the men who were near us, that a ruse had been employed to send them off. The ladrones passed within six feet of us, their black, suspicious eyes glancing to the right and left as they scanned the bushes, apparently in expectation- of finding a foe or plunder. lThey were too cowardly to search the bushes immediately, fearing treachery; but every moment they seemed to gather more courage, and how long before they would pounce upon us, was a question that was not settled to our minds satisfactorily. Had we but carried our revolvers, we could have frightened them, and pursued our way to the factory unmolested. Suddenly the party stopped in front of the dead horse, and a short conversation ensued, in the Mes'tizo tongue, which but few Span- iards understand; therefore the natives have great advantages for the concocting of plots, and planning little acts of rascality. I could not understand a word of the lingo; but Allen was some- what acquainted with it, and listened eagerly to the discussion. "This is a factory horse, " said the fellow, whom we supposed to be the chief of the party. "I know it by the brand upon its right flank. How came it here, and dead at that?" ("Perhaps one of our gang stole the animal, and being pursued, was compelled to kill it to save himself from capture," was the answer. "That is not a likely story," was the contemptuous rejoinder; and he was about to offer a further solution of the mystery, when, the wretch whose head Allen had'smashed uttered a deep groan, as though life was a burden to him. The gang were all ready to run, for fear that the sound was a:   THE LADRONES,          247 signal for attack; but the chief cursed them in set terms for their cowardice, and after a moment's delay he boldly ventured alone to the spot where the wounded man was lying, and dragged him to the middle of the road. "There, you fools," he said; " is that arn object to run for?" He dropped the body suddenly, and the rough treatment pro- duced another groan, which caused the gang to gather around in search of his injuries. "He has been robbed," cried one. "No such thing," returned the clhief, slipping his hands into the man's pockets, and rifling them with. wonderful dexterity. "Whoever heard of a man being robbed, and left with money in his pockets? Look and see if- any of you know him." They stood one side, so that the moon would strike upon the face, and reveal his features more distinctly.. "I know him," cried one; " he is a barcario, and a bold man. Many a fat one has he plucked, and many a weak one pinched." "Then he belongs with us, and we must find those who injured him. Search the bush in couples, and do the work thoroughly." The men scattered in obedience to the orders of their chief, and a portion of them came towards us. "Now, then," said Allen, " we must run for it, or lose our lives. Put your best foot forward, and let us keep together." For a few steps we moved without breaking a twig, and if we could have continued on in that manner, our: escape would have been assured; but unfortunately Allen caught his foot in a vine and fell, and the accident, slight as it was, caused him, to give vent to an imprecation that was heard by the ladrones, although they could not see us. "6 They are here," was shouted, not daring to advance until the whole gang was together, for they knew they had to deal with Americans or Englishmlen, and that if we had pistols we would scorn to run. "On them, then, with your knives," cried the chief. a They have no pistols, or they would have used them long since. A fair division of plunder shall be made if they have money." "Now, then," said Alilen, " let her slide. Strike out and do your best." We had gradually increased our distance from the ladrones while they were waiting for eachp other, and by the time they  t s   2 248       LIFE IN THE FAST INDIES. were ready for the rush we were clear of the brush and trees, and upon the paddy fields. The latter are not favorable for running, owing to the low ridges, generally about a rod apart, and which I have already spoken of; but the ground was as fair for us as the ladrones, so that we had no cause to grumble on that account. The only thing we could complain of was because so many were after us, thus offering large odds that we should be over- taken and lanced by a short knife before we could reach a place of safety. The devils uttered a shrill cry when they caught sight of us,' and then started in pursuit, probably with the expectation of running us down in a few minutes, for they put on their best speed, and tore away at a tremendous rate. "Don't run as fast as you can yet a while," Allen said, seeing that I was drawing ahead of him. L' We have got over a mile to go before we can reach the factory, and must have somie breath for the home stretch. Govern your pace by mine." I did so, but he soon found that more steam was required, for the Mestizos can run when trained, as they are thin and destitute of surplus fat, as a general thing. I glanced over my shoulder, and saw that the scoundrels were bounding over the ridges like deer, and, what was worse, were actually gaining upon us. The devils even had their knives in their hands ready for use when within striking distance. I could see them flash in the moonlight as they were waved in the air. What would I not have given for my revolver at that moment? Even as shaken as my nerves were, I could have put four of the seven, who were in pursuit, hors de combat, as fast as I could take aim. I even rnut- tered my thoughts, and Allen overheard them. "Blast your wishes," he said, rather unkindly. ' What's the use of wishing now?  If wishing was any good, I'd wish for a pair of seven-leagued boots, and be thankful for the favor. Cuss their pictures, how they do run! Let out more speed, for I see that one of the rascals is not far from us." I did make my feet move a little faster, and for a few seconds; we held our own; but the ladrones still crowded us, and came on yelling like so many hounds. "Ah, blast you; yell and expand your breath, if you will. 1: wish that you would burst\a blood-vessel, or break your necks, I; shouldn't care much which.'               .   THE LADRONES.          249 No use wishing," I replied, glancing over my shoulder, and redoubling my exertions, when I saw the foremost scamp was close upon us, and puffing like a locomotive under a full head of steam. "Let him come," muttered Allen, who had also taken a look at our pursuers; "if I don't sweeten his head for him may I never smoke another cigar." He shook his heavy riding-whip, which useful articles both of us had retained possession of, and, to my surprise, my friend rath- er slackened his pace, as though tired. "For Heaven's sake don't lag," I said, fearful that his strength was yielding,. "See, the old factory is in sight. A few minutes more and we shall be safe. We can't make a stand here, and beat them off." "I know it," was the quiet answer. "Do, you keep out of the way of that fellow's knife, and leave him to me. I intend to make his head ache by a few blows, or- there's no virtue in lead and a stout arm."              ! The foremost ladrone was within ten feet of us, while his corn- rades were as much as twenty feet behind him. The leading rdb- ber apparently prided himself upon his speed, for he bounded along as easily as though he was good for two miles. He evidently ex- pected to use his knife to advantage, for he flourished it, and yelled like a demon when he saw that he was gaining on us. I diverged a little to the right, so that we could bring the fel- low between us; and by that means he. was compelled to single out one of us for the attack. I won't say that I was pleased when I saw that he decided to try Allen first, because I was not; but I felt as though the fellow would find his match, and I determined to lend my own assistance in teaching him a lesson always to be remembered. I managed to keep one eye upon the ladrone and one upon Al- Icn, and when I thought that the time had arrived for action, I slackened my pace slightly, so that the Mestizia was brought a lit- tle in advance of mne, and I had the appearance of pursuing him instead of his pursuing me. The fellow, in his eagerness to strike Allen, overlooked me, or possibly thought his companions -would attend to my case. I saw Allen measuring the distance between himself and the Iadrone, and it looked to me that with one, more leap the ladrone would be up with him. -I saw the latter raise   250       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES   - his knife, and then uttered a shout of triumph as though sure of his victim; but never was a man more disappointed, for just as the knife was descending, Alien sprang aside, and thus avoided the blow. The Mestizo stumbled forward, but before he could recover himself, the loaded-whip was whirling in the air, and down it came with force enough to kill an ox. The Miestizo plungedc headlong to the ground, and when I passed him, all ready to give a second edition of what he had received, he was lying per- fectly quiet, with his head doubled up under his arm, as though he was asleep. "You did well," I panted, as I struggled to gain Allen's side. "I His skull is broken, certain, and all the surgeons in Manila can't save him." 'c Save your breath," grunted Allen, "for I think that you will want it before weget out of this scrape. Blast 'em, how fast they run!" I expected that the ladrones would .certainly stop to pay some attention to their comrade; but with characteristic selfishness they passed the poor devil as. though he was unworthy of no- tice. To be sure they did raise a shout, which betokened a desire for revenge; but we thought nothing of it, as we were pretty cer- tain that they would punish us if they could get hold of us, even without the shout., "' A few steps farther and we shall be out of danger!"I said, to my great joy looking up and observing half a dozen men about a hundred rods ahead of us, apparently waiting With patience to see what the race was all about. I supposed they were servants connected with the factory, and they were attracted outside of the walls by the cries which they had heard. The ladrones apparently saw the men as soon as myself, for they raised a peculiar yell, and it was answered by those who I supposed were factory people. I expected every moment that the pursuit would be abandoned, but to my extreme surprise, when I glanced over my shoulder, I saw that the Mestizos were running as fast as ever. I Here they come towards us," I remarked, as well aS my breath would permit, pointing to the men in the distance. "A few moments more and we shall be with them." I hope not," replied Allen, altering his course and edging   THE RACE FOR- LIFE.        251 away towards the river, so as to leave those inf front of us at a greater distance than those in the rear. "They are not factory people," he continued, after a moment's pause. 4 They are the other portion of the gang, who went in chase of the horse. If live are not in luck then, I'll be -" He did not stop to finish his sentence, for we saw that both parties were coming for us at a tearing rate, and as the men who were fresh were likely to outrun us, our situation was none of the most pleasant. We edged away more towards the river, leaving the house on our right hand, and as we drew past it we could see a light in the dining-room, where, but a few hours be- fore, w-e were feasting in peace and security. How we 'were to escape from our foes was a mystery'to me, for if we plunged into the river we should be no safer than on land, as a Mestizo can swim from the age of six, or even earlier. "Can you hold out a few minutes longer?.?" asked Allen, as we dashed along, stumbling, or jumping over ridges, and using our best exertions to escape. ," I think so," was my answer; although I was not over-confi- dent, for if I had lost my footing, I should have been unable to rise before the ladrones were upon me. We were heading directly towards the lower end of the rope- walk, which visitors-to Santa Mesa will recollect extends along the bank of the Pasig for about a third of a mile. Near the end& of the building were quite a number of trees, planted there for the purpose of shading the factory, and for ornament. They were so dense that the mooh's rays were entirely excluded from the arbor which they formed by their abundant. foliage. Our only hope of escape, I considered, was to take refuge in the grove, and whilb the ladrones were searching for us, to crawl upon our hands and knees towards the river, and swimi across to the-other" bank. I had but faint hope that the ruse would be successful; yet I considered that it was our only chance for escape from death. '"Now, then," panted Allen, when we were within two rods of the end of the building, -- .now, then, for a rush; for' every second gained will count." Spurred on by the hope of life, we increased our speed; and as we turned the corner of the building, we hadl. the satisfaction of seeing the ladrones two rods in the rear-.   252       LIFE IN THE EAST -INDIES. "Follow me close," Allen said; and as he spoke he applied a key to the lock of a door, the existence of which I was igno- rant of.  The door flew open without trouble. I sprang into the build- ing, and fell upon the floor, amidst hemp and rope; and the next moment Allen had closed the door, locked it, and tumbled over me, panting as though his heart would break. We heard the ladrones, as they reached the end of the building, pause, and we supposed that they were listening to discover the direction which we took. We could hear them pant from the ef- fects of their long race, and perhaps it was well that they were as tired as ourselves, for I certainly feared that they would hear us breathe, although to prevent such a possibility, I stuffed some hemp into my mouth, and liked to have smothered in conse- quence. "Which way did they go?" were questions freely asked ; but' no one was able to answer correctly. Some suggested that we must have kept on-direct to the river; but the chief of the gang did not favor that theory, because the distance was so great to the water that he argued we should have been seen. One Mes- tizo suggested that we must have climbed: a tree, and he even swore that he could see our white clothes amid the branches. The thought was not a happy one for the scamp, for the chief qvery coolly ordered him to shin up a stately bamboo, and inves- tigate. -I think the fellow was a little reluctant to undertake the job, for I heard the command issued to him twice before he started, and I could understand the jeers which were uttered at his expense for his reluctance, although I suppose that every one of the gang would have manifested as much modesty had they been ordered separately to hunt us up. At length the fellow who had been sent up the tree, reported that what he had supposed to be a suit of white clothes was nothing more than the remains of a paper kite. ,      .   THEE SEARCH.         : 253 CH-APTER X. THE SEARCH OF THE LADRONES.---THE FIRE.- A BAD PREDICA- MENT. -LOOKING FOR A NWIFE. "WHERE could they have gone to?" we heard the chief ask, after the fellow in the tree had reported. Not a Mestizo among them could tell. They listened for a while in the hopes of hearing our footsteps and deep breathing. but we took care to smother our heads in hemp, and thus defeal the plan for our detection. At length the chief sent his men off in different directions, with orders to give a signal if any trace of us could be obtained. "Now is our chance,"' whispered Allen. C We must reach the house while the ruffians are engaged in the search, and if we are spry, we will return and blow the devil out of them." We crept along the ropewalk, stumbling over spinning jennies, or some other kind of jennies, the names of which I have entirely forgotten, - although I am positive that the articles with female appellations were not females in any sense of the word, -- some- times getting our feet entangled in rope, and uttering an expres- sive word in consequence, until we gained!the upper end of the factory, where we had but to unfasten a door and pass from the building without trouble, The dogs inside of the wall, which surrounded the house, were growling as though they snuffed danger, and Were ready for it. As soon as they heard our footsteps their yelling changed to gam- bols of joy, and with some trouble we were enabled to force our way through the brutes, and ascend the steps leading to the dining- room, where we heard the voice of the priest talking as freely as when we left, three hours before. 'We stopped a moment to listen, and found that Father Benventuro and Tom were arguing the probability of our remaining absent all niht,. "Don't tell me that those scamps haven't a design in staying away from their friends this night. I know it, I tell you. They are after some fun. It's just like them; ma;y the devil take   254       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. them for their impudence. But I'll find out all about it, and then will come their punishment." "But I supposeci they would have asked me to accompany them, if such a thing was contemplated," insinuated Tom, in a tone of voice that showed he concluded himself an ill-used man. "It's because yon are too pure - it's because I am too pure for such work," exclaimed the priest. "They knew that you and I would not countenance such proceedings on the part of a newly-married man. There's nothing in our faces that gave them any hope that we should consent to witness their immoral conduct." In spite of our late extremity we could not help laughing at the idea which the priest had contrived to get into his head. The noise aroused the drinkers, and then we burst in upon them. "O, youl old wretch!"Allen shouted. "We can't leave you for a moment but you must plot and play virtuous. Where are our pistols? We will not be slandered," "Bless us, Charley, you ain't going-to shoot a fellow for prais- ing you when your back is turned are you??" demanded Ben- ventureo, although he manifested no alarm. "Pretty kind of praise you bestow -calling us profligates and wretches," I remarked. "Why, you stupids, I was only exercising your friend in the Spanish language. There are many words which he don't know the meaning of; so I was instructing him. He will find them very convenient, if he associates long with you." By the time the priest had finished speaking, we had got hold of our revolvers, and were examining the charges. "Come," cried Allen, turning to the priest, " a party of ladrones has had the pleasure of chasing us to-night, and now we propose to chase them in return. Will you go with us?" "Do you expect me to run after the rascals?" demanded Ben- venturo, surveying his stout proportions with complacency. "Be- cause, if you do, you will find yourself much mistaken. My body is fashioned like a Dutch galiot - made for burden, not speed. If there is anything to carry, I'm your man; but as for racing like a horse, you will have to do that yourselves. But, after all, what use is it to sally forth to-night in quest of the band? It's very probable that they are miles from here by this time. Sit)'"down and make yourselves contented. Brown and myself have emptied ?.  .   .   .   THE TABLES TCURNED.'        255 six bottles of claret and a bottle of sherry each, and we are good for hilf a dozen more,. Sit down, and I'll tell you some wonder- ful adventures which I experienced last nighllt, during the shock of the earthquake." "' We have already heard you tell lies enough on that subject," answered Allen, moving towards the door, '; and we don't propose to ruin your soul forever -by listening to others. Tou can go with us, or remain and drink until you get asleep. You will have no company, for Tom goes with us." ': If that is the case, I shall go also," was the priest's remark; and in a few seconds he had thrown aside his robes, and donned a short jacket, which did not improve the appearance of his figure. With many words from the holy father for our obstinacy in re- fusing to listen to his advice, we led the way down stairs and out through the court-yard, beyond the walls. "We will return the same way that we came, through the factory, and perhaps we can take the fellows by surprise," Allen suggested; but the priest laughed at the idea of our capturing a -gang of ladrones, and offered a basket of champagne for every prisoner. We entered the factory, closing the door after us, and then, by the aid of a dark lantern which Allen had brought with-him, we groped our way through the ropewalk until we reached the door we had entered an hour before, and which was the means of saving our lives. Here we paused and listened, and to the in- tense delight of the priest, no sound but our own suppressed breathing was to be heard. "I told you so," he muttered; "ladrones don't stay long in one spot. Better go back to the house' and finish a few more bottles of wine, and listen to my adventures. Besides-" He stopped suddenly, for just at that moment there was a crackling sound outside of the factory, and in an instant a red light was seen through the many cracks of the edifice. "The scoundrels have set fire to the building," cried Allen, rushing towards the door, followed by the rest of us. "And blast them, they want to burn mle as though I was a Protestant, or a dog,' echoed Father Benventuro, knocking down Tom in his eagerness to escape such a fate. 'Open that doors" he continued, (' or I shall curse some of you, and then the devil will have you, certain.'"   256       LIFEI; IXN THE EAST INDIES,. By the time he had finished , speaking, the door was thrown open, and we rushed out; and none too soon, for a quantity of dry wood and hemp had been collected and placed under the factory, i and then set on fire. The flames were making rapid progress, i' and in a few minutes the building would have been consumed. I gave one glance around as I gained the air, and saw four or - five ladrones standing near a tree, surveying their devilish work with considerable composure. We had issued from the ropewalk so suddenly, and they were so engrossed by the fire, that they did not see us, and not until they heard the sharp crack of two re- volvers did they fully understand that an enemy was near. I saw two men give sudden springs into the air and fall heavily to the ground, and then the remainder darted amidst the trees like lightning, and were instantly lost to view. ' I'll have one of them!" yelled the priest, forgetting that he was fat and incapable of running, starting towards the spot where the gang had stood but a moment before. He made pretty good time for a second or two, and then his feet caught in the rank grass, and down he went, plunging head first amidst a quantity of bushes, each branch of which bore thorns an inch long, and sharp at that. I had time to listen to a volley of curses, prayers, and earnest supplications to all of the principal saints, before I turned to assist Allen in tearing the burning brands from beneath the building, and tramplirig the fire under foot until it was extinguished. The instant that all danger ceased, I could not refrain from giving vent to laughter - a proceeding that caused some astonishment on Allen's 'part. ' Is this a laughing matter?" he asked. "The fire is not, I'll admit," I replied; "' but look in that thorn bush, and tell me if you ever saw a priest ,in a worse position." "' Help, you young devils!" came in doleful strains from the priest; and as there was no danger of an attack from the ladrones, we had time to advance towards the padre, and survey his posi- tion at leisure. ' Hallo!" cried Allen; " what are you doing there? I sup- posed you was in pursuit of a ladrone." "Don't stop to ask questions,'; Father Benventuro replied, "but help me from this cussed bush, which is as full of thorns as   IN A THORN BUSH.         257 a woman's frock is full of temptation and pins, I'm full of puntc- tures, and my body is pitted as though it had had the small-pox. Give me your hands, that's a good fellow, and assist me, for the more I stir myself the worse I'm off." "But how came you there?" demanded Allen. - None of your business, you inquisitive Yankee, was the reply. "Help me, or I'll leave, you to do your own fighting another time." With some trouble and d/anger to ourselves, we succeeded in extricating Benventuro from his uncomfortable position; but when the priest wags fairly released from the embrace of the thorn bush, he abused us in the most hearty manner for leading him from the pleasures of the table to an encounter so much to his disadvantage. In fact, he offered to show us certain portions of his body, to prove that he was a martyr; but we declined the exhibition with much firmnness, and laughed at his scars so sin- cerely that he was compelled to join us, and acknowledrge that he might have been injured much worse. ' The way of it was," the padre said, in explanation, I started for the incendiary, who lighted the fire, and overtook him after a short run. We grappled, and. a terrible struggle ensued. He attempted to use his knife on me, but I avoided the blade, and wrenched it from his hand. I was just conquering him, when two of the scamp's friends attacked me, and I was compelled to devote my attention to them; but while I was striking to the right and left, I slipped and fell upon those bushes, which the saints. may curse if they please, or they may let it alone." We had no desire to refute the story which the priest had con- nred up ; so we let him continue to magnify until I think he really attributed the success of the sortie to his own efforts. When he had concluded, we paid a visit to the two ladrones whom we had seen fall, and found that they were both seriously wounded, and needed immediate attention. The priest conversed with the men for a short time in a low tone, while we stood at a distance wait- ing for him. "These men must be cared for," he said at length, calling us to him. "They are hurt --probably fatally; and although they are bad men, and would have-killed you if possible, still you ate well avenged, and must feel satisfied. As a priest, it is my duty 17   258.       LIFE IN TIE EAST INDIES. to see that their injuries are attended to. You can have no ob- jections to that, I trust,." Of course we had no objections. Our enmity terminated when the men fell, and we felt thankful to think they were not killed outright. "If we can be of any assistance, command us," Allen said. ' No, no; go home and go to bed, and leave me to talke charge of the wounded," replied the priest, somewhat eagerly. 'You can be of no luse here, and might do much harm.  Leave all to me." t"But the ladrones may make another attempt to fire the fac- tory," Allen said. "I pledge you my priestly word that your building shall not be molested by these men," the padre cried. "I have some control over them, and they will obey me quicker than a file of soldiers. Now go and leave me alone with them, and be sure that you don't return or send any one to disturb us." "What do you propose to do?"Allen asked. "You will need help to remove these men, for they are incapable of motion." I   will find help as soon as you leave the ground. Now go, like good boys that you are, and don't let me have to beg of you to do so again. Moments are precious, for life is ebbing away rapidly." He spoke so earnestly that we no longer hesitated to leave the spot and retrace our steps towards the factory. When we were about forty yards from the priest, I heard a peculiar cry that sounded like the wail -of a wounded monkey. The cry was so singular that we stopped and looked back. Amid the trees we could see the figures of Cmany men moving as though bearing bur- dens towards the river.    t "The priest has called the gang together, and they are remov- ina the wounded to boats," Allen said; and then we turned our backs upon them, and let them work without molestation, con- fident that the priest was a safeguard against any further attack, for that night at least. "One would hardly have' expected such a display of sympathy on the part of Benventuro" my friend remarked; "  yet 1, who' know the man well, was not unprepared for it. He likes fun as well as any person outside of the clergy, yet when the rites of the church are required, no tman can perform them with more dignity.   THE NEXT MORY[ING.      ,  259 He is a strange mixture of sinner and saint - man of the world and minister of the church - always ready for a drinking bout or a feast, a funerals or a marriage. Take him in every respect, I had much rather have his friendship than his enmity." It was past eleven o'clock when we reached the house, tired and anxious for that rest which we so much needed. We drank a few sups of cool claret, and then separated, Tom and myself to swing our hammocks in one room, while Allen did the same in his apartment. I do not know whether the scenes through which I had passed were conducive to sleep, or whether' the long race which I had run had so entirely fatigued my system that all dreams and spells had to give way to slumber; but certain it is that I did not awaken until I heard Tom roar out an inquiry as to my intentions of re- maining in bed all day. The table was already spread when we reachedi the dining-room, and down we sat without formality. ' By the way, how are your patients, whose carcasses were rid- dled last night?"Allen asked. The jolly manner of the priest changed at once. His face looked serious, and his eyes thoughtful. ": My dear'young friends," he said, 11 there are some things which even you must not discuss. Speak no more about the men, and try to forget them. They will never trouble you again; that I can assure you." ' But why this air of mystery?" I asked. "Your tea is excellent this morning. Was it brought from China by private hands, or did it pay the queen's dues at the custom-house?" Allen winked, and I knew by the signal' and the priest's eva- sion that it was useless to question further. Hle had his secrets, and no human being could obtain them; so, whether the men were dead and had made a confession, or whether they were likely to get well, was known only to Benventuro  and the other parties  interested. "At what hour shall we leave here for the cock-pit?"Alien asked, after a few seconds' silence. "About twelve, I think, would be a good hour," the padre re- plied. "We can then witness the sport and be back by dinner time, if nothing happens to disarrange . our plans. I have ordered   260       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES& the convent banco to be in readiness to take us to San Pedro lIacati, or if you like we can dine and sleep at the convent." There was not that willingness to consent to the latter arrange. ment which one would have expected.  Allen andimyself re- membered the night we had passed there too vividly I desire to visit the place a second time, even knowing, as we did, that the priest was friendly to us. The sudden death of Don Arturo had never been satisfactorily explained to my mind, although I was married to his widow. Our silence was growing embarrassing, when Toni suddenly relieved us.  "Don't go off there," he said, "'cos the basket of wine that I have sent for will arrive this afternoon in time for dinner." "If ever there was a sensible. man, you are one," cried the padre, in a burst of enthusiasm. "We will return to the factory. I feel my throat parched at the very idea of commencing a con. test with twelve gentlemen in black, with silver heads and effer- vescent stomachs. We will make them yield, or fall in the at- tempt." "Where? under the table?" asked Allen. The priest looked fixedly at the interrogator for a second withl- out speaking.  Then he winked one eye rapidly, and smiled as he lighted a cigar, and drew away from the table. "There is a man in the court-yard who wishes to see the holy father Benventulro," said the servant, entering to clear the table. "Well, what does he want?  To confess his sins, or to be wedded?" demanded the priest. "He does not look as though he was a candidate for matri- mony, senor, for a more villanous face I never saw on man." "' Santa Marie I he must mean my steward, the amiableAntonio. I know of no other man whose face'is frightful enough to scare women.   He has returned from his expedition in season. Show him in. If he brings not good news, I'll have his head shaved as "a punishment." The servant left the room to obey the orders of the priest, and in a  few seconds we heard the cat-like tread of his man-of-all- work. The fellow entered the apartment, and threw a rapid glance  around the room; and this time his eye rested upon the servant, as though wondering why he was permitted to be present.   A 'EW INQUIRIES.         261 The priest seemed to comprehend the fellow's thoughts, for he ordered the servant to give his steward a glass of gin, and then to leave the room. "And hark you," the padre said; " if I catch you or your com- panions listening at the doors, I'll make you do penance that will reduce you to skin and bones in a week's time. Recollect, I shall be as good as my word." I was dying with anxiety to hear some intellirence respecting mny wife; yet I was forced to appear composed, and sat there in solemn silence, while the steward poured down his gin with a gusto that showed he had sent many drinks of the strong liquor on the same journey. The fellow smacked his lips, and then looked into the bottom of his glass, as though sorry that it had not contained a larger quantity. He deposited the tumbler upon a table, and then stood before the priest to await his interrogations. "Have you found any trace of the one I senlt you in pursuit?" the priest impatiently demanded. The steward glanced at us and then at the padre in a meaning manner. "You need not fear to speak before these gentlemen as freely as though I w'as alone. They know the object, of your going to Manila," the padre said. "I haye made a few inquiries," the steward remarked, "and find that the Senora Donna Teresa is in the power of Father Juan, and that he is likely to keep her a prisoner for some months, un- less he changes his mind."   ', ,' Tell us all that you have learned," the priest said. "I like to act, not talkl," the fellow cried, somewhat sulkily. "'And when I command, you must do both," Ben venturo re- plied, haughtily; and as he spoke he held up one of his fingers, and made a significant motion, which must have meant something, for the man's manners underwent a most miraculous change, and instead of the bold bravo, we saw before us the cringing ruffian, trembling at the frown of his master. " Now that we understand each other, go on with your story, and mind and speak the whole truth," the priest continued. "I always speak the truth to you, senor," the steward said, hardly daring to lift his humble eyes to those of the holy father.            . .   .       *'   262       LIFE IN THE' EAST INDIES. The priest made a motion of impatience, and the steward com- menced an account of his discoveries in Manila. "As soon as I reached Manila, senor, I visited the Convent of St. Sebastian, where I have a friend, and pretended that I thought some of leaving your service, and that I should like to get an en- gagement where there was some life and fun going on. I knew the man I was talking with, for we have done some odd jobs to- gether in other days, and I always found him as true as steel. I had to represent that I was disgusted with the peaceful, quiet life which I led at the convent of San Pedro before I could gain my friend's confidence; and even then a bottle of wine was required -to open his heart and make him confide in me., But after his head was affected, his feelings underwent a change. He told me that I could engage with -Father Juan in a few weeks, if every- thing worked well, but that I could not make a definite arrange- mentat present, because the convent was poor." "May the blessed saints always keep it in that condition," was the fervent prayer of Father Benventuro. "I asked for an explanation," Antonio continued, " but my friend only laughed and shook his head. At length he did tell me that the convent would become one of the richest in the island, if Father Juan's plans were not interrupted by a number of cursed heretics, who were prowling around the city for the purpose of making their fortunes at the expense of good Catholics. I joined my curses to his, and said that a sharp knife would soon rid the holy father of their presence, and that I should have no objections to perform a certain part, if good inducements were held- out to me. This answer had some effect, for my friend thien told me that a lady, whose name he did not wish to mention, but slie was independently rich, had taken an amorous fancy to an Amer- ican who was residing in the city, and who was doing a largre business, exporting rice to China; that Father Juan had xmade desperate attempts to break up the connection, but had failed, just as he supposed he was about to be successful, through the wilfulness of the lady; that he was determined to get posses- sion of her person, and hold her a prisoner until- she was willing to enter the convent and give all her property to Father Juan. For that purpose the father had lingered around a house which she was visiting, intending to seize her as soon as she attempted to return home."   ANTONIO'S MSSION.        263 '4 The cursed scoundrel!"I cried, no longer ableto suppress my rage. "Pece', my son," the priest said, as gentle a rebuke as he could utter; " let not your passions overpower you. What has been %one was the will of--  "The devil," interrupted Allen, whlo saw that the priest hesi- tated for a proper word. Benventuro made no reply. He wavred his hand, and his satellite continued:- i"After my friend spoke thus freely, he no longer sought to conceal anything frgmn me. Perhaps it was because I carried a couple of flasks of wine with me, or because he thought that i was speaking the truth, when I said that I desired to change my masters. If he supposed that I was sincere, I am fearful he has altered for the worse during the past few years, for my friend was seldom guilty of uttering more than one truth for ten lies, and I was always considered much like him. At any rate the wine opened his mouth, and his tongue told me that, on the night of the earthquake, Donna Teresa was brought to the river door of the convent in a banco, and even entered the building, but that Father Juan feared the archbishop would be bribed by you to interfere, senor; so'the sa:ne bancari,)s who took her to the con- vent were further employed to carry her up the river to a house which the priest has full control of; but where that house is, my friend did not know, or refused to divulge. I tried every offer. that I could think of, without letting my mission be discovered, to get the desired information, but I failed." "Tell me," I cried, " did your friend see the lady when she was brought to the convent?" "He did, senor," answered the steward. "Did he tell you that she was much affected by her imprison- ment?"I demanded. "She wept sometimes, senor, but oftener uttered threats like a high-born Spanish lady who felt that she was ill treated. She did not supplicate, but many times, in her anguish, she called upon her husband to save and protect her." "' This is monstrous "I' exclaimed; " a lady is suddenly seized and imprisoned, and I must. content myself by waiting patiently for her deliverance. If I could but lay one hanrd upon the neck   .264 zLIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. of that rascally priest, he would never commit another outrage, or cause a tear in Teresa's eyes." "But as you can't do as you wish, you must be governed by our advice; -fnd that, you will find judicious in the end. The search is not yet ended, nor the danger that you are liable to meet at the hands of Father Juan. We have succeeded wonder- fully so far; so don't defeat the object of our enterprise by auy rash action. Be calm and patient, and your wife will yet repose in your arms, all the happier for her trials." What argument could I employ against the advice of the priest? I was a stranger in the land, and unaccustoned to the tricks of the Jesuits and MestizosJ; and much as I loved my wife, I was compelled to let others work in my behalf, and do that which I would have given all my-wealth to have done. "You have not disappointed me," the priest said, addressing his steward; "the information which you have imparted is im- portant, and is appreciated by us all. But you must do better, even if you go without sleeping or eating for a week. You must discover the house where the lady is imprisoned, and when you have done so, we will take steps to free her. Go back to Manila, and like a shadow track Father Juan's steps; let him not move a dozen yards without your knowledge; nirght and day keep him in sight, and yet let him not even suspect that he is watched. Now return to Manila, and give us early information." The fellow bowed as though the priest's word was law, and -was about to leave the room, when I stopped him. "Remember that you are not working for an ungrateful maun" I said. "If you discover the lady, a heavy reward will be your portion. What you have done already shall be paid for; but be careful and not purchase too much wine." I slipped two doubloons into his hand, and the darkl face of the man lighted up with -such a satisfied look that I did not regret the gold. "' Senor," he said, with more courtesy than I ever saw him ex- hibit before, c" if your wife is in Manila I'll find her." He turned and left the room suddenly, as though he had some fear that Father Benventuro might request a dividend of what. -e had received. I watched him until he reached the river, where he had a banco, and had the satisfaction of seeing him paddle towards the city with lusty strokes. .    T'HE COCK-PIT.         265 ;( A trusty fellow," exclaimed Benventuro; u but he requires a steady hand to manage him. He is wilful at times, but I think he means well. He is useful, very useful, ' on occasions.' " "I will lay a wager that he has committed some crime in the course of his lifetime, and that you keep him in subjection by/ having a knowledge of it," Allen said. "Fie, for shame! to suspect so good a fellow," the priest said, smiling; but he did not deny the charge, or make further allusion to it; and as we knew the priest confided to us what he pleased, and no more, we did not press him for an exposure. The time lagged until the hour for dinner, which wyas served at twelve o'clock, thus conforming to the usage of sea-life; As soon as the meal was concluded, we left the table, and embarked on board of the convent banco, and were slowly paddled up the river towards San Pedro Macati, where the cock-fighting was an- nounced to take place, and where the priest hoped to make a few ounces on a favorite bird whichi he had been training for some time past; but his passion for gambling was too deep rooted to care for reverses, -and I had no doubt that, if occasion required, he would stake even his black robe for the sake of a little excite- ment. The fact of a priest being partial to cock-fighting was too universal in Manila to provoke comment. Some would frequently leave the church for the cock-pit, and yet lose none of the odor of Christianity in the estimation of their followers. They staked heavily on the result of a fight, and, if they lost, paid with as in- different an air as possible. If they won they were glad, but that was the only emotion observable upon their smooth faces. It was only during the excitement of a battle that they lost all control over their passions, and made wagers, which, in their calmer hours, they would have hesitated to take. By one o'clock we were at San Pedro Macati. Already was the village alive with people, who had flocked to the place from all quarters, with their favorite birds in their hands, and a small stock of money in their pockets, for the purpose of betting.  The air was vocal with crowing, each chanticleer endeavoring to dkrowt the noise of his neighbor, but not being successful, grew frantic with rage, and made demonstrations of hostility towards a11ll whi approached. These bursts of passion were looked upion with great interest by the natives, as they exhibited the truea breed for fight-: ing purposes, and many small- bets Were matde 'before' the: eoeks   266       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. were exhibited in the arena, where they were to contend for the supremacy, and kill their antagonist, or suffer themselves to be killed.  Before we had reached the central portion of the village, the- individual who exercised the same functions as a mayor, being responsible to .the government at Manila for riots, murders, or plottings, and authorized to arrest the actors in such dramas, made his appearance, and greeted the padre with every demonstration of respect. He was an old man, with a grave face, as became his station, and a severe eye, which told how little he would hesitate at ordering a hundred blows with a stick, or make the victim come down handsomely with gold for pardon and escape of 'punishment. And the Mestizos seemed to stand in awe of his authority, for they did not press around us'when they found that he was to take us in charge, and that we were vouched for by such a respectable man. One of the peculiar laws of the island is that which prevents foreigners from visiting the several villages on the river, unless a passport is obtained. This is for the security of the Spanish authority, which brooks no interference, and is continually haunted by thoughts of revolution, and a general massacre of the"soldiers and citizens of Spain. The government is well aware that the country offers great inducements for intrigues; hence in each town is an individual who is called the mayor, whose duties I have defined. In addition to this official are several spies, whose occupation is to watch the mayor, and see that he is faithful to his trust. If a foreigner, therefore, wishes to land at a village for even a few common necessaries, his arrival is -quickly communicated to  the mayor, and that worthy pays him a visit, perhaps with his pants under his arm, or minus a shirt. The arrival is, questioned, He merely landed for the purpose of buyitng some milk. Has he a passport? No. Then he will be kind enough to occupy a room under a  guard of natives, until the will of the authorities at Manila is known; and as the latter are slow at moving, a week or more elapses before a release is ordered, or a command to bring the prisoner to the city for examination. It was quite fortunate for us that the mayor was not only ac- quainted with the padre, but was on terms of intimacy with Ailen,' Santa Mesa and San Pedro Macati being but a few miles apart. \             '       ,   MADE PRISONERS.        26 7 Under these circumstauces, of course; no inquiries were made regarding our visit, although candor compels'me to state that we -were immediately made captives by the mayor, and marched to his residence, surrounded by a whole body"of inquisitive Mestizos. Ouir imprisonment was not of the' rigorous kind, by any means, ,for the mayor with great pomp conducted us to, the best 'house in town, and showed us to a iroom where we could make oulrselves conlfortable, in huge bamboo chaiirs, with rests for the feet and pillows for the head; and while we were tryingl the softness of bamboo, a naked little boy brought us cigars and fire, and When we were in- a cloud of smolke our host usl'ered in a young girl, aevidently a daughter,but she bore a huge jar of liquid, the per- fume of which seemed very grateful on a warm day. The vessel was deposited on the earithen floor, and tlten two more -girls made their appearance, in costumes which wouldl hardly be considered as appropriate for females in this country, exceptin-g in a ballet or circus. 'C O Lord!" muttered. Tom, whose susce'ptible heart began to blaze at the sight of so many chalrms; "I can't stand this long. If those girls don't cover up their necks, I shall certainly have a fit." , The girls filled pint cups of stone ware from- the jar, and then advanced and offered them to us with considerable grace;. We were at a loss to understand 'what the beverage was made of, but a slight sip soon set our minds at- rest. It was lemonade of. the most delicious quality. Cool and crispy as ice water. Such as I had never drank before; but often drank afterwards, when I could get a native who understood the art to prepare some. For a few seconds four heads nmight have been seen thrown back, and then f6ur long sighs, as the cups were emptied, heard, and four voices proclaimed the rapture which was felt as the soothing beverage tickled their palates. And the mayor stood by, and saw our delight with an expres- sion of intense satisfaction upon his dark face at the admiration' with which we hailed his skill.             - "Holy father," cried the mayor, " let the girls assist you and your friends to another drink." ":My son, replied the padre, "my senses are in such a whirl: i                      . .         268       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. of delight at tasting your cool lemonade, that you shall have my blessing. Kneel, my son, and receive it." And the mayor did as directed. He dropped upon his knees, and the sign of the cross was made over his head. The man arose, seemed very grateful, while the father looked very com- manding and very thirsty. "' Now, my daughters," the kind-hearted padre said, holding out his mug, " fill this, and see that it don't remain empty while I am in the house. If you are attentive, my children, I shall bless you before I go." The mayor was so pleased at our praise that he sent one of his daughters for fruit, and she returned with a variety; and for an hour we sat in the cool room of the house smoking and quenching our thirst, and occasionally complimenting the ladies, while the longer we staid the better terms we were with them. But a rude native, who considered cock-fighting superior to love-making, entered, and in humble tones announced to Father Benventuro that the battles were about to begin, and that only the presence of the mayor and himself were wanted. Of course we all arose at this announcement, and began to make preparations to start; but I noticed that Tom seemed in- different, and was not inclined to move, and I instantly guessed the reason.  He preferred the society of girls to cock-fighters, and if I had not been a married man, and a faithful one at that, I should not have blamed him greatly, for the girls were quite fresh-looking, and had very plump, enticing forms.  Come, Tom, we are about to start," I said' . If you are going with us, you had better put your coat on, and get ready." : '   O, Idon't care for cock-fighting?," he replied. "There'll be a crowd, and I don't like crowds. Better go without me, and call when you return this way."  "' Confound him," whispered. Alien, "' he wants to make love to these girls during our absence. I don't blame him much for it; but, as we shan't stand a fair chance, I'll cheat him of his fun." He spoke a few words to the mayor in the Mestizo tongue, and, that functionary appeared extremely gratified.  He gave his- daughters an order, and expressions of the most profound -delight were- instantly observed upon their faces. "Well, if you will remain here," Allen said, speaking to Tom,   THE BATT'LES,          269 "make yourself as contented as possible. You will have the house all to yourself."                     -iBut the girls intend to remain-don't they?" demanded Tom, with some eagerness. "O, no; they are going with us. Women are too fond of crowds and battles to stay away from them."  '"Hang the luck-J" muttered the disappointed man; ' I won't stay here all alone. I think I'll also go." We started from the house, sheltering our heads from the sun" by means of Chinese umbrellas, which the mayor loaned us, while: to- Tom's extreme gratifiation one of the youn girls suffered him to hold the screen over her head while on the wayto the build-' ing where the cocks were to fight.  Our arrival seemed to be the signal for the fights to commenc^e for two natives brought in two cocks, one white and the other red. After showing the birds to the audience, and prodlaimiing their owners' names, the cocks were allowed to-peck away at each other, while the natives held them in their arms. After their- passions were excited to the highest degree, the animals were: dropped to the ground, and joined in combat. Then the betting began with enthsiasm, the priest leading off:. by shouting, ' Two dollars on the red!"Hrdly were the words  out of his mouth, before his bet was accepted by a native who' carried a bag full of dollars in his hand, and shook them to at- tract attention, and give evidence blat he was capable of, payingo his losses. :From all parts of the building were heard bets, from five dollars down as low as six cents. The audience was not -kept long 'ina suspense regarding the battle, however, and it seemed to me that before the bets were all made and accepted the fight was finished,1? the white cock having received his, quietus from a-long -spur, made: of steel, and- fastened to "the red cock's legs.  "Thank the saints, I have started well,"' muttered the priest, as: he pocketed the native's, two silver dollars, and lighted a cigar. "It's devilish exciting - ain't it?" asked. Tom, who was seated; by :the side of the -girls, making desperate work speaking intel- ligible Spanish. :' The cock-fighting, or love-making?"I asked. - :: "Why, the fighting, to be sure. i'm too much accustomed to the  . .. . *         i:   270       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. other sort of thing to mind it much," was Tom's cool reply; but I knew that he was in a flutter ofagitation all the time. The dead and live cocks were carried off, and a black and gray were brought in of more pretensions than the previous ones. "Bet your money on the black cock," whispered the priest to Allen and myself. "I own the bird, and know his metal. He will whip the gray to a certainty." "An ounce on the black!" shouted Benventuro. I supposed that not a man in the whole crowd possessed the sunm, but I was mistaken. Thle fellow with the bag of dollars took the wager up in a second, and several others manifested a strong desire to win the padre's money. For a few minutes the confilsion was intense, as all were shouting their bets and their favorite birds. But after the wagers were all made, silence was instantly re- stored.  The birds were dropped to the ground, and went at each other like human brutes enhgaged in a prize fight. At every blow exchanged the crowd applaulded. The battle was a very good one, for both of the cocks were of the real sporting breed, and were well trained before the steel spurs'were buckled on their legs. The blows were fiercely given, but no particular damage was done for the first five minutes. I saw that the- priest was uneasy for the safety of his invest- ments, and I almost hoped that he would lose; but the devil stood his friend that time, at any rate, for the black cock made a sudden movement that the gray one was not prepared for, and through his brain was driven the long steel spur; and so strong was the blow that the victorious cock could not extricate the- weapon without assistance. "The saints be praised for my luck," piously ejaculated the priest. "If I can only keep on as I have begun, I shall make up some of my heavy losses." In the mean time my attention was attracted  towards the girls, who were laughing, and apparently in a great state of ex-: citement.    ,  "Only think!"shouted Tom ; " the girls are betting dollars on the fights, and seem anxious to win. It's great fun -isn't it?" "It's fun for them, but your purse has to suffer," replied: Alleu; and sure enough, I saw that the foolish fellow was supply- ing -them coin to bet, and that it disappeared into :their pockets   TOM:I'S BETS.         271 as soon as a battle was decided. The matyor smiled approv- ingly upon the sport, and seemed to envy the shrewdness of his daughters. Tom also seemed delighted, and as he was his own master, his proceedings were none of our business." - How much did you win that time?"I asked of Benventuro. "Three ounces, and all paid up. I've got one more bird here from the convent, and I shall stake all on hirm. Here he, comes. The red one, with eyes like balls of fire. He'll fight like the devil, and lick anything in the shape of a cock that lives. See him strive to get away. Bet all your money on him, and you will be sure to win." The convent bird -was a magnificent specimen of game cock, being unusually large, and full of fight. Ilis opponent was much smaller, and was nearly black; but he had a wicked look, which induced me to think that he was full as plucky and smart as the priest's pet. For five minutes the betting wenl; on yery briskly, and hundreds of dollars were staked on the birds. The holy father bet all of his winnings, and was confident of the result, and the ex- citement raged so that :[ forgot my unhappiness, and found my- self staking two ounces on the black bird, much to the priest's disgust, for he whispered to me that I should certainly lose my money; but I was not so sure of it, and preferred my judgment to- his. The result was fully equal to my expectations; The convent cock made a rush for his opponent as though he intended to an-, nihilate him, but the black cock was wide awake, and dodged very handsomely. The ruse produced a round of applause, the ladies adding their sweet voices to the general uproar. The priest grew anxious, and pronounced a curse upon cock-.fighting generally. Once more the birds stood face to face, their feathers curling with rage, and their eyes glowing with fire. They made a-few feints like prize fighters;, but the black cock was evidently wait- ing for the attack, and rather stood on the defensive. -Suddenly the- red bird made a rush, and struck like lightning; but the black cock's head was close to the-ground, and the blows missed. The priest groaned, and calculated the amount of money which he had staked. The ladies laughed, and doubled their bets, Tom finlding the- money, of course.; ::  - --         : ;The red cock strutted- around the arena , like a dandy, and    -:272       LIFE NO THE EAST INDIES. ;even, attempted to crow; but before the defiance had quitted his throat, the cunning little black fellow dashed towards him, and, with a spiteful* blow, drove one of his steel spurs into his oppo- nent's neck. The blood spurted, and the red cock endeavored to keep his feet, and fight the battle to the death. But his strength was not equal to the courage. He staggered first one side and then the other, and at length fell upon his side and died; but :even then the black cock was not disposed to let him alone, and l -had to be plucked from the body and carried away struggling.  'C What do you think of the convent cock now?"I asked of the priest. "Blast the cock, and curse cock-fighting!" he cried. "I have lost the last dollar that I have about me, and if I remain here a second longer, may the saints curse me." "For shame!"'I said; " a priest, and to display so much pas- sion for the lose of a few dollars!" "O, it's all very well for you, who have won three or four ounces, to- cry shame; but how would you feel to have your -:favorite bird killed, and win nothing on his head? It's all a cursed trick, and I won't bet another real on a cock-fight as long as I live."                     - "Wait a moment," Allen said, delighted at the opportunity to hector the holy father. "Make another bet, and perhaps you  will win. Here come two noble cocks for a fight, and -the  Mestizos are more anxious than ever for wagers. Take some of them up."           X : -The priest hesitated for a moment, then felt of his pockets; but not finding a dollar there, muttered a curse, and strurggled  to escape from the building-' an example I was only too glad  to follow, for I had seen as much as I desired of cock-fighting, for : one day at least.   Poor'Tom, who, seemed destined to be thwarted in his little love..adventures, befgged of us to wait until the show was ended, -but when he: found that -we would not, he cursed in set terms our obstinacy., the fear of being left in the village all night without- -:company was before his eyes, and he was compelled to tear him- j self away from his inamoratas, and follow us grumbling.  /:.

"O I don't mind the money, 'cos rve got a plenty, Tom' answered. "They borrowed about ten dollars from me; but 1I -am sure they are welcome to it, and I shall never expect or re- eive payment.

God bless me! what was the matter?" asked Tom, eagerly.' : "Do you mean that you did not see the lovers of the girls glar- ing at you from the o]pposite side: of the building, and that they worked at the handles of their knives as though desirous of termi- nating your flirtation? You must have seen them, and tried to make the fellows believe you cared nothing about the matter.": -' "No, I pledge you my word I did not; and if such was the case, why, I don't blame you for wishing to get me out of the way of danger, although you know that if I had fair play I should care but little. for-them. My revolver is worth a dozen knives. How the girls must miss me!" "And your dollars,"! I ventured to suggest; but Tom was:con- tent to have the hint pass without notice, confidentt in his own opinion that the girls eared more for his person than his money ,a mistake which too Tany Europeans indulge ina when they cobfide their affections to a Mestizo girl.

A- s soon as we were on the water the priest's spirits rose, and lie no longer al- luded to his misfortunes. ;He hinted that the,- time was not far distant when he should have funds enough to enable him to buy all the game cocks in Manila, and get up fights for his own amuse- ment; and while he was thus congratulating himself, the banco reached the factory., I was too anxious to obtain information of my wife to care to' remain at Santa Mesa for supper, which generally was served at  seven o'clock; but all my arguments were overthrown, and I was  :compelled to wait until Allen could leave his business and ac- ;campany -nme. Absence- from my wife had but increased my love for her; and as I sat by the window which overlooked the Pasig, and saw the sun hide its face behind the hills, I could hardly restrain the deep- emotion-which I feltwhen I thought that perhaps Teresa was also gazing at the seene, and wondering why I took no steps for her recovery. , I felt more than ever determined to wage an unceasing war. against Father Juan, and in spite of his hired assassins and bravos to gain possession of hler I loved so well; and I thought if she was once -more clasped in my arms, that I would take care and protect her with a strong heart and an unfaltering hand. -While I was thus indulging in reveries, I felt a hand upon my shoulder, and looking up, saw the holy Father Benventuro stand- ing over me.    ,  "Why do you look so sober, Guillernmo?" he inquired. "-Are you still thinking of your wife?" ' Who .else should I think of at such an hour?" I demanded,.  There are many things to attract a young man's attention," he replied,.:"and had you been married and lived with your. wife a couple of years,;you would think so. But I am glad to see that you feel miserable without her, for it will spur you on to- greater, exertions for her recovery; and when you have gained- possession of her, I shall expect to see such perfect domestic bliss. ,that-all the young people in Manila will visit you, for the purpose of learning the, history of:your happiness. Mourn on, Guillermo, :mourn on-; but as for me, I must live. without a wife, or children to call me father." .   .       X     . ...  '               "\     '   - i t. 1 .Iq:. IN MANILA.  "And do you really chafe under the vows that bind you to celibacy?"I asked, somewhat astonrished. "Well, I can't say that I do, for in fact I am, not one of the- marrying kind. I had much rather unite people in wedlock than to be united myself."  "But do you not like children?"  "I am passionately fond of little pets, and- some day I will show you quite a number who- callf me uncle. ,That, title is a respectable one, and solves a good many questions-from peo- ple who are fond of asking therii. No, I am niot a father in-' the general acceptance of the teram, but love my nephews and nieces. I let the conversation drop, and, acting on Allen's hint, got ready to accompany him to Manila, the Mecca of my hopes and fears. We took the convent banco, with but, two assistants, for the purpose of not attracting attention. The men who paddled the. boat were tolerably trustworthy, and were almost strangers. in Manila; so we knew that they would be likely to remain :by the banco until our return, even if we were gone all night, which we did-not expect.... :We reached the city about eight o'clock, and the first visit I made after landing was to my wife's house, for the purpose of. consulting with Donna Raquel, Teresa's maiden aunt. Illeft Allen in the street while I entered the house,;for my friend stood in wholesome fear of the old lady's tongue, and did not care to encounter its bitterness, if he could avoid it .    . The old lady received me with great cordiality, and instantlay-tI rang the bell, and ordered me a i:glass of her- bitters, for -fear the night air wmruld affect my stomach -and disarrange my liver;. and after she had watched and satisfied herself that I had swal- lowed the dose, she prepared herself for a string of questions but I got the bestofb er by first inquiring if she had seen my wife,: or had any joyful tidings to communicate respecting her wherea- abouts? '0, you poor -;child!:" she began, -I haive- not slept an hour, * thinking of you ,.and Teresa, and :wondering wheniwe sliall see- the last of these disagreeable troubles. My :appetite, toot is-alL gone, and were it pot for the bitters I should sink intomy. gravye ; forI th bite ll   '276      LIFE IN THE. EAST INDIES. and I don't know but that would be the best place for me, for really: there's nothing for one to live for."  I stated that I hoped the saints would spare her for many years of happiness, and I have no doubt butr that she desired the same thing, but thought it would not look well to acknowledge it. Once more I asked for information concerning my wife, but I rightly judged that she had none to give me. "I have not heard the first word respecting her, poor child, and sometimes I think I never shall again. I wish they had taken me instead of my niece; I think that I could have foutnd means to escape, had there been fifty men employed to watch me. But Teresa has not got half the courage that I possess, and J am afraid that but few women have. They are not what they used to be; the saints pardon me for saying so." I had no hesitation in saying that the abductors knew better than to attempt the capture of so spirited a lady-as Donna Raquel - a remark that was considered complimentary; and as a recom- pense I was made to drink one more, glass of her famed cordial, which she warranted would enable me to bear up under my:mis- fortunes, and keep me in good condition until I was enabled to see my wife. "Have you seen Father Juan?"I asked, after a few moments of silence on my part, but vigorous conversation from my maiden friend. i"He was here this foienoon, and remained but a short time, pleading that he had apressing engagement, He asked for Teresa, and I told him that she was at her country-seat, I supposed. I -manifested no anxiety in regard to her; butwatched his face and actions closely, and I am firmly convinced that he has con- ,fined Teresa somewhere in the city, and that he is determined'to ,)keep hera prisoner. until she consents to his demands. I said nothing that would lead, him to think I suspected such a thing, :and the priest left me after a few hasty inquiries respecting your- ,sel , , ,  "Andpray what did he say regarding me "I asked. "Simply whether I thought Teresa- would marry a heretic, re- gardless of the wishes of her best friends. -That question,} I told "I was unable to answer, for women were wilful when their hearts were touched. He said nothing, but left the hous ve ry   thoughtful.'      .   - -." GRACIA. - -     -' ,'2" ' I was sorry that Raquel had no better news for me; but the lady promised to work in my behalf, and not even to take a siesta until I was righted, and her niece set free. I pleaded business, and left the house, promising to call in every day and give her the result of my doings; and with a recommendation to the saifnts to have' me in their keeping, she bade me good night. Outside'of the garden walls I found Allen, smoking a cigar, and waiting with patience my appearance. , Well, how was Donna Raquel to-night? In a pacific mood, or an argumentative one?" he inquired. "She was mild and hospitable ; full of sympathy and regrets," I answered. "You have, then, accomplished the greatest triumph that has been witnessed on this island for years," Allen answered. 4' Donna ERaquel I considered untamable by man or woman." In silence we walked on through the crowded streets, until we- reached my residence. We paused at the foot of the staircase, for we heard a female voice singing a Mestizo songi not in the monotonous tones that characterize the Mestizo race, but with much sweetness and power. "Hallo!" whispered Allen; " your pet bird is pining in y6ur absence. Go and greet her, and I'll return to the house in an hour's time." He turned to depart with a smile, -but I detained him. :- "I have once explaiied matters to you, and- was in hopes that -WI should not have to speak again on the same subject," I said, with as offended an air-as I could assumne. O, so you did. I ask your pardon. Go along, and rll follow y0n." ....        dn you. We passed up stairs so quietly that we did not disturb; Griacia, who was seated at a table sewing by the light of a candte.' For a few moments -we stood looking at her, and a very pretty picture :"she was -to' look at. Her 'clothes weIre neat and clean, bti -icut too low in the neck for fashion. In her dark hair were numerous flowers, looking as fresh as her fiill face beneath- the 'da'rk skin : of which could be seeifAthe red blood dancing through: her veins Min all its purity. ,           ,  "s (, Are-you lonely' Gracia, that yon'sing suh a mournful s:on?

"O, senor, have you returned?" she asked, as though doubt- ing the evidence of her senses; and in the joy of the moment she would have thrown herself into my arms, but I checked her be- fore she could commit such an impropriety. I thought of my wife, and was safe from temptation. I wish all husbands could truthfully say as much. The world would be better, wives happier, and men would not be kept awake nights thinking of their sins. "Pardon me, senor," the poor girl said; "I forgot, in the joy of seeing you, that I must not love you.- I will try and remem- ber your commands." "Hang me if this isn't most marvellous," muttered Allen, re- garding the girl and myself attentively. "If I should tell Tomn and Benventuro, they would swear that I had been drinking, and was unwortlhy of belief. It's better than a play - much better." "I told you, Gracia," I said, addressing the girl, " that I had a wife living, and to her I should renmain faithful."  Then bring your wife here, and I will love her and her children as well as I nowa love you,' she cried, earnestly.  "As soon as I have found her, Gracia, you shall see her," I remarked, and was about to pass to my private room when she laid herlhands upon my arm and 'detained me. ' Senor, can I aid you in finding her?" I hardly knew what to say. I did not like to tell the girl that her father, the night before, had made an attack upon me, and nearly succeeded in his designs; yet I thought for how little she had to be grateful to that parent, who had left her to gain her bread the best way she could. "If I could see'your father, Gracia, perhaps he could aid me," I said, at length. ' ",Then you shall see him," she exclaimed, promptly. "e was here this afternoon, and promised to call this evening,. fit is time that he arrived. He met with an accident, so he is incap- able of working, and that accounts for his visit to me." I knew what the accident was, but I did not tell her what caused it. I looked at her attentively for a few moments, ad determined to trust her. "You say that you like me, Gracia?"          E                ..   '   t     *-     *       9 7 T  THE  BEG GG . uAu 279-- "Better than any one in the world," was her candid answer. "And you are willing to serve me?"  - Faithfully, senor." i, Then, when your father visits you this evening, take him to the sitting-room, and give him a glass .of wine; be cautious; see if he won't tell you where he carried fhe lady, whom hetook from this lhouse on the night of the earthquake. He' was employed' by Father Juan, and a hint to that effect may awakenhis recol- lection. If you succeed, you shall be well rewarded." ' "I shall be amply repaid," she said, c; if I contribute to your -happiness. I will do as you direct, and I pray the saints that I may succeed." I found that the other servants had all gone to the theatre so there was but little danger of their interrupting our project; and I thought, if I could get the father of Gracia to confess to his daughter his connection with the plot, I should have a card in my hand that was well worth playing. While I was giving instructions to the girl, an old mnan, poorly dressed, andwith a staff in his hand, entered the house, and stood- at the head of the staircase, bowing low, as though desirous of charity. I held a few coins in my hand, for I supposed the fellow. was a beggar; but to my surprise he did not seem- anxious for money, for he refused to advance and receive it, "Can you give me a bed to-night, senor?" he aslred, in tremu- lous tones. ' I have travelled for many miles, and am weary.; '"I will give you money to buy a bed and supper, but you can't stop in the house," I replied, somewhat astonished at the novel; request; for but few Mestizos enjoy the luxury of a bed, or even' care for one.        ;    :     ' "Well, senor, I suppose I must take the moneys" he said, alter, a moment's pause, as though deliberating whether it was best to accept it.  I advanced towards the man, keeping my eyes fixed upon hiis amovements, for I had a slight suspicion that he:'might inean, treachery; but when I was within a step- ofe his person,:a voice-X that I remembered whispered,-            ...  "Can the girl be trusted, senor?"   ... ;  The suspected beggar' put his hand to hs face, and- li0td a long, white beard, and then I saw the villanous features of, Bien - venturo's steward, Antonio, tal convent ser"ant; :.,\ : :/ ^ '   280       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. I was so astonished that I was about, to call his name, but he interrupted me by whining out,-  "I must have something-to eat, senor, or I shall never be able to leave the city. The saints will bless you for what you do for me - that you may depend upon." "You shall have something," I answered; and then turning to Gracia, I directed her, somewhat to her astonishment, to get a plate of cold meat and some bread. "Why don't you turn the old vagabond out of doors?" asked Alien; " he will fill your house with fleas and vermin of another and more troublesome kind, unless you are very fortunate." Gracia did not seem pleased with her errand, but she was too anxious to stand well in my estimation to refuse. As soon as she left the room, Antonio's bent form became upright, and his air of i dejection deserted him. 8' Senors," he asked, (' can you trust that girl?      i "I am not certain," I replied, " for I have known her but a few days. She seems faithful." ' And I seemed an old man a few seconds since," was the answer; and there was scorn with the words, as though a man was a fool for trusting any one in this world. ' It's that scamp of Benventureo's," muttered Allen in English, -as much surprised at his disguise as I had been. "& If you are not sure of the woman, I had better pass: into another room, where we can converse Iprivately," Antonio said.- I pointed to the door .of my chamber, and he dodged in just a moment before Gracia returned. ' Here 'are meat and bread on the table, senor," she said. "The beggar has left the room, and perhaps the food will- not be wanted. Let it stand until after your father has gone, or give it to him. We are now about to enter my chamber. Seat your parent near this door, and make him speak loud, so we can over- :hear all-that he says. Remember, my happiness depends upon j you.                        . . .  I held out my hand to her, which she kissed, and looked so kind that I patted: her head, and felt tempted to touch her lips;! bat  thoughts of my wife again prevented, for which I should :now fieel deeply grateful.                   : "Well, -Antonio, what news have you to communicate?"I asked, as soon as-we had closed the door. -        '.   ouR -VISITOR-. -, .*+ "INone, senor, of importance.

He will be detained there two hours, und then I shall track him again, and perhaps he may visit the kouse where your wife is a prisoner-" The spy stopped while speaking, and listened attentively.  "- Some one is coming up the stairs," he said; " and- I hear. the young girl speak to him." HOw he could have heard as much was a mystery, for although MAllen and myself listened attentively, we could not distinguish a sound or footstep. CHAPTEER XI. GRACIA'S FAT'rn .- A CONFESSION. - ON THE TRAIL, &C., &C. "i YOUR girl has a visitor, and she is urging him to take a seat in the front room," Antonio said, with a keen glance at my :face, --as though he was desirous of satisfying himself that I was not engaoed in a plot against his welfare. : I expected him," I replied, with a gesture to keep silent and the fellow obeyed; but I could see that his ears were; openand that his snake eyes glistened in anticipation of overhearing private :'conversation. - :; ' -Gracia and her-father entered the sitting-room, and I could hear - her say that she- was alone, and expected no one unti eleven :o'clock. I pardoned the deception that shewas practising,bhe- :cause it was for my sake, and men will overlook* much on thawt score. r',You have a good house here, child;'the father said.

Women have got too mueh l heart to make a trade."  - "But I am not engaged as a mistress," Gracia said. "I am employed to sew and do a little washing." "Then I am not too late. I'll see the senor to-morrow, and talk with him about your price. He shall pay well, Gracia, for I know ho to manage foreigners. And then, if you but do your duty, a pension will be secured to you for life. He has money, and shall pay, or I'll set Father Juan on to him." At the mention of this name, Antonio redoubled his attention; He seemed to complrehend by instinct that important disclosures were to be made. His eyes grew  brighter, if possible, than ever. "r Do not speak to the senor," Gracia said, in a tone of voice that showed how much she disliked the subject of coversation. The senor is a married man, and virtuous; I have known him but for a few days. He has been kind to me, and Ilove him as a brothel." "Love him as much as you please, but still make money out of him to help your poor old father in his misfortunes. See, I have 10st the use of one hand by an accident; may the saints con found the luck, and only think how pleasant it would be if I could- come here and get what I want to eat and drink. Your sister Sara was always thinking of me, and many a glass of wine has I she given me."                        i "And I   will do the same9"Gracia replied. "Sit-where you are, and I  will bring you wine and food." The father grumbled out a few thanks and signified that what. ever she brought would be acceptable. No sooner had she left the apartment, than Antouio quietly arose and noiselessly bolted the door of the room in which we were sitting. ' What is that for?" I asked. "It's quite probable that the fellow will desire to see what there is worth stealing in the house, so I have taken the precaution to prevent his getting in here and making a discovery. I may be wrong in suspecting him of stealing, but it is always best to be  on the safe side." Hardly had Antonio concluded, before a hand was laid upon'  the latch of the door, so softly that had I been alone and reading,   "STENING.          283: I!hould not have noticed the incident. There was a slight push to force the door open, but not succeeding, all was quiet -againm. Antonio gave us a look which exp'essed his satisfaction at the re- sult, and then recommenced listening with renewed ardor. /I heard the fellow- creep back to his chair after his attempt to explore the recesses of my chamber, and from that time until Gracia's return he sat still, as though conjuring up in his brain some scheme by which he could live without work. - His cogita- tions were not of long duration, for his daughter, perhaps, sus- pected that he might be restive during her absence, and put some- thing in his pockets that she would prefer I should not lose. -"-Here, father," she said, ",is -wine and bread, and meat." "Give me the wine first, child," he replied; " because, with a bottle of wine a man can be independent of-hlunger,'and hap- pier than if he ate hearty and drank nothing but water. As a general thing I prefer wine to bread." "I should think that wine would be bad for your wounded hand, father," Gracia said. "There is where you are wrong again, child. Wine enables. me to endure the pain, and think how I can revenge myself for the injury.  After all, the thought of revenge is nearly equal to the reality."              - !I think that you told me that your hand was injured by an-. accident," Gracia observed. "Then I told a lie, for it was smashed by a heretic, whom H shall make pay for it some day with his blood." "Can I help you, father?" the girl asked, not suspecting that I was the one who committed the act. "I am not so certain but you. can, girl, if you are shrewd enough to get the fellow in your toils, and keep from loving him. qHe is detested by the church for he is a her-etic, and Father Juan has no cause to love him." ' "Why should Father Juan dislike him?" asked Gracia,/ filling her father's glass for the second time. I I am sure," she contin- ued, "C that if the padre h ates him, the heretic is unworthy to liVie much longer,"                  , - ' The parent did n ot reply to this speech for a few seconds. o He was occupied in draining his glass, and thinking how-far he should: trust the girl. ,           . "He is unworthy to tive, .girl; iJbt . what;..makes him uhn orthy:   284       LIFE IN THE EAST; INDIES. in-my estimation? Because I can make money by his death, antd enough of it to give you plenty-of dresses, and a rid e  in "a while on the Calsarda." -The girl filled his glass a third time, and I knew that she was waiting impatiently for a full confession. There were three otih- ers equally as curious, and if possible more eager, to hear how the money was to be made.             ' -. "A few nights since I made an ounce in an hour's time;," the Mestizo said, removing his tumbler to take breath. "That is a large sum of money, father.  Let me see the gold." "O, it is all gone, child; I had to pay off some old scores with it. But more will come from the priest, or '1ll tell my secret to one who: can afford to pay well for it." There was a pause of many' minutes' duration. I could hear the fellow's teeth at work as they crunched the food which his a'daughter had offered him; and while eating he seemed to have no disposition to talk. I wanted to rush out and take him by the throat, and make him tell me all that he knew regarding the ab-  duction of my wife; but I feared that he would prove obstinate, and maintain a stern silence. "Father Juan ds a good man -is he not?"Graciu asked, at length. "He pays well," was the response; as though that was saffi. cient to establish his claims for goodness or rascality. "Shall you get more money from him?" the daughter asked, "That will depend upon his success in an enterprise he is now engaged in," was the answer; and I fancied that I detected a malicious laugh while speaking.; ," What is the enterprise, fathler?" was the next question, yet asked in such a careless manner that the fellow did not get alarmed and refuse to reply. "' Are you sure that no one can overhear us?" the Mestizo asked, and I fancied that his eyes were directed towards the room in Which we were concealed. "Quite sure," was the answer; and I was ready to admdit that if my protegee possessed no other merit, she was something of an adept at deception. - But that I pardoned, because it is 0on- stitutional with the Mestizo irace. ' '  " Well,i then, I don't mind telling you; but bedsure and keep it   C.   ssON.     it b r I ha285 a secret, because I expect to make money out of it before I have concluded with Father Juan. I said that a heretic stands in the padre's way, and the reason of it is because he has married, or was about to marry, the widow of old Don Arturo, the Spanish merchant, who died some time since, immensely rich. The holyfa- ther wanted thei lady to enter his convent, bhut she had no wish for sch a life, and to force her to do so he sei;ed her on the night  of the earthquake, and hired my comrade and myself to carry her to the convent. That was a bold trick, but it paid us wel, and may the saints send me many more just such jobs." "And the senora is now confined there?"Gracia asked. That was a most momentous question, and I held my breath for fear that I should lose the answer..  "-No, child, the senora is not there at present. The holy Fa- the r Juan is too cunning for that. He feared a search and dis There was another long pause. heard Gracia fill her fther's glass, and the old vagabond smacked his lips as though he rather approved of the wine with which the house wra supplied. "Did the senora complain when she was carried off?"Gracia asked, at length.  , "Diablo! She w as indignant, and abused us, all like ladrones. Then she cried, and asked for her husband, andi Father Juan wanted to know if she meant the dead one."'  I made a movement, and if Allen had not restrained me, I should have gone out and throttled the scamp.   c'Poor lady," Gracina said; :it was cruel to treat her so harshy."                  -  "But think of the money we made by doing as we did"^ .-.  True, I had forgotten that. Then yowukuow where she is im- prisoned at the present time?" ; Of course I do, and that I intend to keep a secret." : "But if I am to assist you I must know all your plans," the daughter said.    . -  "True ; and as I think that you can keep a secret, I don't mind telling you., After Father Juan decided that it would be dasngerous to::keep the lady in his-convent, we again took her in our bunco and pulled up the river untilwe passed the bridge, and reached Mother Machit's house, an old building: that is inear lheide eof the;l watePr.

They asked no questions when Father Juan carried the lady to the house; but what was said after we were gone is' more than I know. We got our money, and left in search of more." ' "And you think that the senora is there at the present time?" Gracia asked. "I saw :the holy father leave the house this afternoon. I sup. pose from that he had been to pay her a visit." After this information it was with difficulty that I could restrain my impatience, I was so anxious to start for the house, and conm- mence my search for Teresa.  It seemed to me that the rufflan would never leave off guzzling wine, and more than once I heard Gracia hint that perhaps the senor would soon return; but le was deaf to such insinuations, and was just drunk enough to be obstinate and quarrelsome, for every few minutes I heard him mutter that his children cared but little for him, and never divided their earnings, as dutiful and loving daughters should do. The coolest person compelled to listen to the AMestizo's mutter- , ings was Antonio.  He did not seem in the least disturbed by being compelled to wait; but I suppose it was a part of his edu- cation to bide his time.               -  At length all conversation and mutteririgs ceased, and by the Mestizo's deep breathing I judged that he slept. Carefilly An-  tonio opened the door and looked out, and then he motioned Alien to follow him. Gracia was standing at a table, her eyes red With 1 weeping, and in -my pet arm-chair was her father reposing, his dirty legs resting upon the bamboo frame, with as much indepen- dence and sang froid as if he was the owner of the house and contents.  The villain was snoring most unmusically, and we were not disposed to disturb his rest just at that time, for we feared that he might interfere with our designs. "racia," I   said, holding out both hands, I shall never forgt tthe service that you have done me." "'Did you hear all?" she asked. :' Every word that was spoken." And you think that you can find your wife from the confes, sion which he made'?"  "I hope so; we are about tostart for the house."    ON THE TRAIL AGAIN.        287 r The poorgirl wished to say something, yet feared to give utter- ance to her thoughts. "Speak, Gracia," I said, in a kind tone. "If you should find the senora, you would bring her here?" he asked. : Perhaps I should. Why?" "( Because I think she might feel a little jealous seeing me here without knowing my position. Perhaps it would be well for me to leave." I could hardly believe that there was so mnuch consideration for the feelings of others in the heart of a Mestiza girl, and even Al- len shook his head as though he did not exactly know what to make of it. ; -"Stay here, Gracia, until I tell you to go. I hope that my wife- if I am so fortunate as to ffind her--will put some -little confidence in my honor."  "I wouldn't if I was a woman,' Allen muttered; but as- he 'was always inclined to be sarcastic, I took: no notice of, his re- , mark. The girl withdrew to a corner of the room, apparently satisfied - and as we did not care about remaining in the presence -of her father, in case he should awaken, we quietly left the house, and stopped to deliberate in the court-yard. - Let us lose no time.^, Allen said, "'-in discussing the matter. We must proceed at once to Mother Miachit'!s house, and force an entrance. If Donna Teresa is there, we will find her, and if she has been moved, we may gain some intelligence respecting her,"  : Antonio said nothing. He seemed to plice himself under our command,  and was ready to act as we directed. Perhaps he had received orders from, Benventuro to do our .bidding, and he feared that worthy too much to oppose us in anything. We started towards the banco which we had left some two or three hours before, and were glad to find thatf the -Mestizos were: sleeping soundly upon the mats inr .the bottom of the boat. We roused them up with but little trouble, and, in as quiet a manner as .possible, for fear of, attracting more attention than we desiied at that-time of night. I Z was too excited to' fear any danger, yeet: constantly suspected some trickoe r treacherous movement oin the part of the priest Juan, which would deprive me of the treasure   288       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES.          f sought for so eagerly. But I was armed, and determined that I would fight to the last in defence of my rights. "Do you know the house where the lady is confined?"I -asked of Antonio. "Si, senor," I replied. "Then steer the banco to the spot as quick as possible." He took the paddle that guided the boat, and then we shoved into the stream, and commenced working our way against the strong current that flowed down the river. There was not another banco stirring when we started, al- thbough there were mnany moored near the bridge, as though wait- ing for freights upon the closing of the theatre. The night was uncommonly clear, and -by the aid of the moon objects could- be discerned for many yards distant. Even the sentinel, who stood upon the bridge, pacing too and fro, could be seen as he stopped for a moment to look at our boat as though wondering if he ought not to challenge us, and find out our business. But he altered his mind, if he had any such intention, and resumed his round, his steel and brass accoutrements glistening in the moonlight like diamonds in a ball-room. "How much farther have we to go?"I inquired of Antonio, as we swept through one of the lofty arches of the bridge. "Not more than half a mile, senor," was the answer. "Then pull strong, men, and let us get home-in season," Allen said, addressing the Mestizos who were rowing. -The fellows answered with a grunt, and renewed their exer- tions, and as we hugged the edge of the river to escape the cur- rent awe made considerable progress, and Hwas congratulating myself that we should soon know the worst, when Antonio touched my shoulder, and pointed to a banco that was coming down the river at a rapid rate, being urged through the water by four oars and a steersman. "That banco belongs to a convent,"' Antonio said. "How do you know?"I asked. "Because, instead of its being covered with a mat it is covered with cloth of a dark-green color." "Can you tell the name of the convent that it belongs to? : I demanded, somewhat eagerly, for I saw white garments in the Stern of the boat, and I -thought it was barely possible the tpriest might be changing the prison of Teresa.   A CEHASE.  ..        289 I am not certain, but I think the craft belongs to the convent of Sebastian. A lady is in the stern of the boat. Shall we give chase and see who they have got? We canl shoot across the river, take advantage of this tide, and. I think run across the banco's bow." The spy read consent in my eager looks, and even before he had finished speaking altered the course of our boat, and she- was gliding alona in almost parallel lines with the convent banco. "Pull, you scamps!" shouted Alien; " we must reach the arch of the bridge first, or we shall lose sight of the banco." Th\e men stretched to their long, clumsy oars in earnest, and for a few seconds we actually gained on the stralngre boat; a fact which wias quickly noticed; and then we saw, by the hurried strokes which the convent men gave, that they were determined to keep us at, a respectful distance, if hard rowing could accomplish it. "By heavens! there is a woman in the stern of that: banco," Allen said suddenly, after he had watched the course of the con- vent boat for a few moments in silence. ' I think that I can see her struggle with a man who sits beside her." This information almost drove me distracted, for I imagoined that it was Teresa who- was being carried away-to some place that the priest thought more safe, than Mother Machit's. A' n ounce to each man if we overtake the boat t"I shoutedl. ", Pull for your lives, men, -and you shall. never know want liere- after!"          . "Keep cool," whispered Allen, fearing I would commit- some rash act while in such an excited state; '" sit still in the boat,for your movements make it difficult for the men to row, They'can hardly hope to escape us, unless a miracle intervenes." I did manage to control myself sufficiently to sit down; but I drew my revolver, and longed for an opportunity to: use it.,  "( Good God!" cried Allen, seizing' ther weapon and wrenching it from my hand; " are you mad, to think of firing a shotdirect- ly in front of the cityi where we can be covered vpith a thousand muskets- in a minute' S'time, land riddled with balls before a single question is asked? This is not the time nor place for, revolvers. If we intend to capture the crew of tha't banco, it must be done without noise or confusion. 'Even the; sentinel on the bridge must suppose that we, are having a little quiet amusement by racing." 19             ;   290       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. The advice, I have no doubt, was good; but it seemed hard not to fire one shot, just; to bring the fellows to their senses, and make them wait our coming. "There is a lady in the banco," Antonlo said, aiding the boat through the water with his paddle and steering at the same time,' We had made the discovery some time before. 'She is struggling with a man who has his hand over her mouth," the spy continued, as calm -as though great results did not depend upon our success. ! Guillermo!" was the cry I heard proceed fro m the other boat, j and then followed a struggle and exclamations as though a man was endeavoring to prevent some one, from speaking.  I should have known that voice from a thousand others, for I had heard it too often ever to forget it. "Tereksa!"I replied, struggling to my feet, and once more en- deavoring to wrench the pistol from my friend's hands. "Tere- sa," I continued, ("I am near you, and will save you." "For Heaven's sake keep quiet," cried Allen; (" you will over- turn the banco and drown us in the river, and it is a fate I am ,not prepared for." But I was too excited to pay attention to his caution. I could only see my wife struggling in the arms of a stranger, and calli ng: to me for protection; and the thought that'I was only separated from her by a few rods, and yet unable to assist her, was mad-. dening. I cursed thile cowards for their treacherous conduct, and even. while I was raving, the bows of the bancos came together with a crash that made them tremble like reeds 'in a gale. With, a :desperate leap I attempted to reach the boat containing my wife. My feet just touched the gunnel of the convent banco, rested there for a second, and then I was pushed .off and fell into the river, yet before I sank I thought that I could hear a. mocking laugh, and the voice sounded much like that of Father Juan'. :I found, that I had passed through one of the arches 'of thel bridge while I was under water, and that I was exactly opposite- the :town, but-travelling tdwards the light-house at the rate of about faur miles an hour, which was much faster than i desired to gop I  looked around for the bancos, but could only see those in shore, fastened for the night.

The captain was reported to have seen all parts-of thie" world: had been upon- the ocean ever since he, cut his- teeti, was reputed wealthy, and the owner of half a dozen daughters, just; ly entitled to the name of "S6alem witches," at which cit the captain resided wheni at home, which rem1arkable event happened about once in tWo years; but not oftener' if he could help ' The captain was fond of company, - provided thei compopanj would listen, and not interrupt him during his long-yars, w-lhich he was'fond of spinning.

"Why, you wouldn't have me swim with them off- would you? What would the women say if they should see me?" "Don't go through the streets at this late hour," the captain continued; t" it's mighty unsafe, for the Mestizos are as handy with their knives as a marine with a musket. Come, go on board- my ship and sleep to-night9' .  Almost before I was aware, the captain had edged me towards the boat, and stepped in. In another instant the Mestizo had:- shoved off, and we were pulling out of the river, the captain- puffing vigorously at a cigar, and chatting confidentially. "I s'pose, if the truth was known," the captain said, with Yan- kee curiosity to learn the secrets of others, " that you have had some'confouuded love scrape to-night, and had to swim or be dis- covered. Was it an angry parent, or a jealous lover, or a revenge- ful brother? Don't be afeard to trust me, 'coz I can keep a se- ciet as well as the next man." "Well, to tell'you the truth, captain," I answered, more with' -a desire to excite his curiosity than anything else, "I was in' search of a wife." "Don't do that out here in this hot quarter of the globe. There ain't any fun in it, I tell you. Don't go and marry one of these black gals, with her skin shining like copal varnish, and her hair greased like a slushed top-mast. Blast it, man, wait till- you get home,; and marry a Christian, with a white face, clean hands, and who can talk your own lingo; where two thirds of your nights" are cold, and mosquito bars ain't known. Take my word for it, if you marry one of these natives you'll regret it afore you've bin spliced a week." We soon reached the side of the ship. I mounted to the deck, and was received by the mate, who probably had been cursing' his captain's late hours, and then was conducted to the cabin, which was handsome enough for a packet-ship, and where a man- couldn't help taking comfort if so inclined.      - "Here we are at' last," cried Captain- Miller, seating himself, after putting away a few' suspicious-looking packages -which he had- brought off in his boat. ' What do you think of the Nancy-?

Mind and don't hit the chronometers. I'd rather you would hit my wife." I found a neat suit of clothes ready for me, although I must confess they were much too large; but I didn't mind it, as there were no ladies present to witness my exploits - drinking punch or listening to the captain's yarns; which I must confess did much towards relieving the sadness of my heart, when I thought how near I had been to my wife, and yet was compelled todleave her.. ":Come, don't stop to titivate yourself, for there's no women here," I heard the. captain shout. ,T The punch is all ready, and I've got the start of you by drinking a glass." I'hurried out and seated myself at the "dc'ing-table, at the head of which the captain was installed in all his dignity, a pipe in his mouth, and a glass of punch in his hand. "Here's cigars and pipes; which do you prefer?" the captain asked, filling my glass. JI lighted my cigar, tasted my grog, found that it was' excellent, and I didn't fail to say as much. C Ah, there s no liquor like oMd Santa Cruz rum, if you get the pure; and I take care that I don't have anythng else."  'Did you ever cruise in the latitude of the West Indies?"' asked the captain, after he had paid his devoirs to the punch, and: had refilled his pipe, und lipghted-it to his satisfaction. I shook my head in the negative. :."

The wind was very light, and we were not going through the water faster than two knots ian- hour. I left the deck at ten o'clock in charge of my mate, a :Salem-bred boy, named Cooper, and a smart fellow he was. He afterwards commanded the ship Sarlow, which you might have heard of.: She was lost at sea five years ado, and Cooper wehit down with her, I expect, for he was never heard of. Left a wife and three children, with money enough to get along without trouble, and that'sc some comfort to a widow. I told Cooper to :keep a sharp look out for squalls and suspicious-looking vessels, for we were directly in the track of homeward-bound slavers, and Ias I had met them a number of times without any good result, H was not anxious to see them again, and preferred giving them a wide birth. "I hadn't been napping more than two hours, when Mr. Cooper called me. "' Captain,' he said, ' the moon is just rising through a black cloud, and directly in its wake I can make out a vessel, braced - sharp up, and stan'ding across our hawse, as though she wished to speak us.' "I went on deck and took a squint at the craft that had some- what alarmed my mate, and I must confess that I didn't feel quite satisfied with her looks, for she was a large topsail schooner, with tremendous hoist to her sails, and they set as though made for -her by a master hand. The craft was low in the water, and was as black as the devil is reported to be.. I saw that the schooner was jammed tight on the wind, and that she would be likely to pass our bows, at the rate she was going, about half a cable's length - -distance; but while I was examining her through my glass, Hsaw :her sails were shakiug,and' that her-headway was materially dead- :-euedu.. It seemed to me that her skipper- wanted my vessel to e'draw ahead, in hopes of not being n6ticed, and possibly he would have succeeded had not Cooper's eyeslferreted him out, -;: I examined the. stranger for a few seconds, and then I came to the conclusion that the chap was either a slaver - uncertain of our character --or a pirate. : But: at all events,;I determined to \i            -   -A.

"Ay7,ay, sir,' he answered, and in a few- seconds themer -were on deck and casting loose the twelve pounders, all of whichl ihad been loaded 'two days before, with canister and round shot ,.and all that we had to do was to get up ammunition. and plaee:il -in the cabin handy, and then load' our muskets,sand take :the boarding pikes out of the racks. - We are all ready, captain,' my mate said in less than five min. -utes after he received the orders; ' the imen are all stationed a! the guns and ready to fight at command.' \ *c ".c I hope that there'll be no occasion for the use of the-bull- dogs, I replied; ' but there's no telling what that feller's inten. -tions is.

"' Perhaps he wants us to pass him, and not be noticed/ mY mate remarked; and I didn't know but such might, be the case, 'cos'the brig did look yery much like a man-of-war, and to tell :-the truth, I had no objection to be taken for one of Uncle Sam's vessels, 'cos it rather flattered nay pride.      ; . ]By the tinme the stranger was off our beam, andtwhen ITbegan to think that he-cared-nothing for us,-he filled his.-sails and steered -so as to just run under our stern, and I didn't know but ttie fel:low : vas determined to rake-' us, and if he had, there wouldn't-!lave been anything left of us.

"' I put my glass to my eye, and as the moon had got clear of a black cloud, I was enabled to see what I had to deal with. I cpuld only make out half a dozen men on deck, and I calculated that was all the schooner had on board. There was something wrong going on, and I determined to investigate it, even if I was exposed to some little peril. I determined on a bold stroke, al- thouigh I had some fear of the result.- "' Sehooner,-ahoy!' IJ shouted, just as she was directly astern of us.  "W - Vell, what is it? '-was the answer. "Send, a boat on board immediately, and let us see who you are,' I commanded. "' Who in thunder are you?' was the impudent question. "' The United States brig Perry, bound to Santa Cruz.' '-There was a-breathless silence for a moment, when suddenly I heard a shhrill whistle on board of my own brig, such as is used by boatswains of a national vessel when the crew are to perform any work.

I sincerely hoped that we should be spared the latter alternative, 'cos I knew that at the very first broadside, they would discover our imposition, and rage like devils for revenge. "In the mean time the schooner continued to draw ahead slowly, as though to get beyond the reach of our guns; but I determined to prevent that by bracing up and maintaining my position. The instant, however, that we had boarded the main tack, and were making some headway-through the water, I hailed the schooner again. i' "Hallo!' was the gruff answer.  ' Do you intend to send a boat on bodard, and give some ac, count of yourself?' I demanded. " Ay, ay, sir, as soon as we can make her-tight.'  The answer I did not deem satisfactory, for-it seemed to me-as though the crew were attempting some d odge that'was dangerous td our welfare, and I determined to prevent it, if possible, by taking thhem by surprise.               -.

I stationed Mr. Cooper and five of the crew with loaded, muskets on the vessel's rail, while another hand held a small grap-- pling-iron for the purpose of throwing it into the boat to prevent, the men from shoving off and returning to their vessel to reveal our true character.  Things worked just as I expected. No sooner had the pirates shipped their oars when they got alongside, than one of theni- said,- -  "' Dis is no man-de-war. It is a d- d merchantmens.'. "' Sacre,' cried a Frenchman. "Diablo,' muttered a Spaniard. "' Nix cumrouse,' said. a Dutchman. "'We are deceived -shove off,' cried a man in the stern sheets. "' Not as you know of',' cried Cooper. ' The man who offers to lift an oar dies instantly.' "The six muskets were pointed within a fathom of the pirates' heads, and then down into the boat was dropped the kedge. It caught in-the bow thwart, and held the boat firm alongside, and the -only way to get clear of it was to cut the rope; but at the first, intimation of that we would have blown them to pieces. ' ' I'll trouble you to walk over the side, one by one,' Mr. Cooper: said, addressing the pirates. ' The least noise or resistance shall cost you dearly. Walk up like men and settle your accounts, 'cos we would like to show the lady some attention, for the poor thing looks as thiogh she was not partial to your company.' :"' It's a mean Yankee trick,' muttered the manin the stern:: sheets, who I, afterwards found out was the captain of the schooner,: and an Englishman by birth. ' If I had known for sure that you : were nothing but a merchantman, I'd blown your tub out of the water.'  "( (But, as you didn't know anything about it, we have saved you. some trouble, :So just walk up, and quit grumbling, for it won't; do you any good;' and Mr. Cooper's advice was followed, for the   -PIRATES ASPRISONERS,-'       30i1' skipper came slowly over the bulwarks, and as :soon as he struck- the deck his arms were seized, and a nice pair of handcuffs-were- thrust upon his wrists. "Hands were also thrust into his pockets, and a pair of pistols' and a huge bosvie-knife were found, and after the fellow was dis- armed, he was shoved down the after hatch with a-gag in his mouth, to prevent his shouting too loud. Every man was served in the: same manner, and then I assisted the lady on deck, and very haplJ- py was I to do so, for she was a beautiful craft, with the prettiest: pair of eyes that ever wrecked a sailor, and I think that I am a judge of beauty. "' W vhich is the captain?' she asked, the first thing, as soon as she lieached the deck. ' Mr. Cooper and her brother pointed to me, and bless me if she, didn't give a little scream and throw herself on my bosom, while her arms went round my neck as tight as a cap fits to a top-mrast. "' O0, capitani,' she said, ' you is mine preserver; my angel- my good man -- my everything.'       . "' Hard up,' I cried, for you see I couldn't, stand it.

"I didn't like to run the risk, but Cooper was so positive that I consented to let him undertake the job. For the purpose of car- rying out the deception, I lent the mate a cap and coat with brass buttons, and put a sword at his waist, while the six men he took ,with him put on whiteduck trousers, so as to appear as uniform as possible. Well armed, the crew started in the schooner's boat, although for the sake of seeming all right it was piped away in -man-of-war style. i  "I watched the course of the boat with considerable anxiety, for 'I feared that everyi minute the pirates would let one of their guns fly, and send boat and men all to the bottom ; but fortune favors ;the brave, they saJ, and in this instance I can swear to it. The Mboat got alongside without trouble, and the next istant the men :had tumbled on deck. There was no sound of figzingg or scuf- fling, but I knew that the mate was at work, and at lit I had the :'satisfaction of hearing him hail, and say, that the sc ooner's crew were all prisoners and under hatches, where they could do no harm. "Then I -began to breathe freer; I told the mate to stick' close to the brig until daylight, when we would see what could be done, -for I didn't know, as yet, on what ground we had taken the schoon- :er. I axed the brb0hers to reel me off an accountof their adven- tures, and they d;d, so in a slip-shape fashion. They belonged to Santa Cruz, where they --wned a large plantation, and were looked upon as A No. 1 in rank. They had bought the schooner for the purpose of trading among the islands, and I guess for;run- ning a few cargoes of niggers; but that they said nothing abotit. They had hired a man, who called himself Smith, an English- man, as skipper, and he shipped his crew, and a bad lot he- got :h old of.

"Captain," I replied, ' I feel highly favored by your esteem and confidence, but there's an impediment in the way." "What in the devil's an impediment?" he growled. "Why, a wife, to be sure;" and I broke a way from him just- in time to hear him mutter, - "By thunder, I thought so all along I " I did not dare to look back for fear the captain would again make me a prisoner; so pushed on through the crowd of boat-  . men until I reached a carriage, and gave directions for the driver to take me to my house without delay. As I entered the court-yard of the house, I was surprised to gee there were many signs of neglect on the part of the servants. The horses had not, apparently, received their morning meal, the yard had not been swept, or the sidewalk washed. I passed up the broad staircase without meeting any one, and continued on: until I reached the sitting-room-, when I was surprised to hear some one weeping. I listened for a moment, and found that the  sounds proceeded from my chamber. I entered, and saw Gracia,  with her face in her hands, kneeling before a picture of the Virgin  and Child, and crying bitterly. "What is the matter, Gracia?"I asked, laying my hand upon her head. The girl started to her-feet with a scream of delight, and before I was aware of the: fact, her arms were around my neck, and her head was resting on my bosom. I was so much surprised that for a minute or two I remained motionless; then the thoughts of my position flashed across my mind, and I remembered that my honor, as a married man, was in danger. Gently I disengaged the young girl's arms, and led her to a seat. "Pardon me, senor," she said; "I was so rejoiced at your ap- pearance that I forgot my position." "There is no great harm done," I answered,:with a smile; ' but pray be a little more careful with your demonstrations of pleasure in future. I understand that you feel grateful to me for a few favors, but don't let the world. imagine, that we stand upon a false basis."             .  , I will try and remember in future, senor," she answered, her   A SURP1RSE          - 305' eyes filling with tears and her face with blushes. I could'not help feeling surprised to see you alive, when I was mourning youn as dead."  -- And pray who told you I was dead?"I asked, somewhat as- tonished at the information. 6"Your friends, the Senor Allen and the other man, were here last night, and seemed quite anxious regarding you. Their clothes were wet, and they talked in low tones of your mishap, as they thought you must be drowned. Senor- Allen was much affected, but your other friend did not appear to mourn much."  No, It suppose not," I muttered. ' It -would havee been singu- lar if the spy cared enough for any human being to mourn his death. How could they lave made such a mistake as to imagine: me drowned?"  - Because they searched the river, and saw nothing of you, and then thought you would return home if alive. They waited here until, two o'clock, and then gave up all hope of your being in the land of the living." "Confound the luck," I thought. lI had no business to go on board the Nancy last night. Like a respectable citizen, I should  have come home, and gone to bed, and not given my friends so 'much trouble. I must Start for Santa Mesa without delay., aind let them see that I am alive and well, barring the effects of that: punch. It was confounded good, thugh."al.. These thoughts passed through my brain very rapidly.. I de - termined to visit the factory, and let Allen and the priest see that It was not quite dead, and thenl return to the city and recommence;- my search with renewed ardor. Just as I arrived at' this sagei conclusion, one of my servaits entered the house, and expressed the utmost astonisliinent at my visit; butl1 quickly (clangred his;: tone to one of anguish, for I gave him a &most U nmercifuil rating for neglecting his duties, and getting partially intoxicated, under tlhe impression that I was many feet under water. 'Indeed,t to Griacia alone was I indebted for preventing the rascals from- strip- ping the bhouse of everything of' value, and selling the same for what they could get.

By the time I had dressed in habili- ments that fitted me better than those of Captain Miller's, the house was -looking as neat as ever. The floors were waxed, and the yard swept; the dishes were washed, and put in their proper places; and in each room the furniture had been dusted and arranged. The scamps knew that one of their number had been, thrashed, and all felt they deserved a like fate; but my time ws too precious to indulge in such amusement, and after a few con- soling words to Gracia, I drove off at a gallop for Santa Mesa. :I left my carriage at the corner of the road that leads to the factory, and started alone for the house of my friends. We, all -feel as though we would like to know what is said of us after death; and as I was supposed to be dead, I considered that Hhad a right to judge of- the estimation in which I was held by those :with whom I was associated for so many months. Instead, there- fore, of approaching the house in front, I scaled the adobe wall, and entered by the rear; and luckily I did not meet a single ser- vant, although workmen were seen in abundance. I noiselessly ascended the stairs, and looked in at the door. Benventuro, Allen, and Tom were seated at the table, eating dinner; and a very hearty one I judged it was, from'the number of dishes before them. "Poor fellow!"I heard the priest say, holding out his . plate -for an additional supply of curry and chicken; " his early death has quite spoiled my appetite. I don't feel as though I should enjoy life again., The shock to my nervous system has been too great."           ;  - - -: "'Who will take care of that pretty little girl of his in ManilaP" demanded Tom, his thoughts evidently on the probable result of ,her falling into his hands.  '.She:might enter:riy convent," the priest suggested. I can provide for her there, I think."   .: O," O blast your convent! Do you suppose a woman wants to :be locked up in a convent all her- lifetime?"Tom asked. ":For my part-, Alien- said, speaking for: the first time,. ",I am o   vf the, opinion that he may-yet be alive. He was a stout:swim- mer, and may have been picked up by a banco bound on a cruise   -. :SP ECULATIONS,  :        .7 in the bay.

'           "What do you suppose his wife will say?"Tom asked;' ":^'"I expect she will acl; like other women - shed a few tears at -first, and then- think of shmebody, else, of course," was the priest's unigallant reply.           , : 44"She is the handsomest woman that I ever ,saw," Tom con- tinued. "She bangs everything I ever saw in. York., She'd make :a sensation in that city."     . ; I saw the priest glance at Tom's face,. as -though reading his thoughts, but the scrutinyr did not appear satiisfactory. Could he have already considered whether a bargain with Tom would be advantageous for his colvent and himself? . At any rate, I had heard as much as I desired ; so I:stalked slowly into the room.  "Can you give me a dinner?"I asked, in a sulphurous tone, - There were sudden springs from, the table,; chairs were over- -turned, glasses were dashed to the floor, and then I found Alien's :arms around me, while tlthe priest, with his long garmets in both hands, was performing a most ungraceful- dance, which I could ;compare only to the floundering of an elephant. Tom suddenly disappeared from the room after one or two yells, which le used to-assure us were exact imitations of the calls of York iBowery boys ; and I never had- occasion to: question the truth of the as- s;Iertion.  .-  F"'lhis day," said the priest, sinking into a chair, andifanning -his: heated, face, " is one ,of -the happiest of, my life,^.

I appeal to Tom," roared the priest; but just at the ;moment that individual entered the room with. a bottle of chlampagne under each arm. i ' "This event must be celebrated in due form !"Tom exclaimed.

We sat down to the table, and all were anxious to hear my statement. Feeling a little ashamed of my conduct, I sketched my adventures as briefly as possible, but took care to convey the impression that visiting the ship was not the result of deliberation, but of accident. Without telling a deliberate falsehood I suc- ceeded in extricating myself from the position in which I was placed, and I believe to the satisfaction of my friends. "You should have remained in the banco," Allen said, after I had concluded. "That jump of yours cost us all pretty dear, for when you left our boat you took care to capsize it, and into the water we went as well as yourself. Instead of going through one of the arches, however, we lodged on the stone-work of the bridge, and remained there until taken off by a passing banco. As soon as we landed we went to your house, and frightened Gracia out of her seven senses by asking if you had been there, and to our great surprise we learned that you had not. I concluded that you was drowned, although I sincerely hoped not. We lost our prize, and you must alone blame yourself, for you was too eager." "' Eager in a good cause, though," the priest said, encouraging- ly, touching glasses, and swallowing a bumper of champagne- an example that was so contagious we all followed suit; nor did they stop at two bottles; for, I am sorry to say, when they once commenced they hardly knew where to leave off; and while we were in the midst of our revels, who should enter the room but:, Antonio, the spy? He surveyed the condition of the party with- out the least surprise, and when the priest roared out that he was, the most dishonest scamp in the country, looked as though he tried to believe it.  o "The senor is safe," he said, with a grin that was intended for me. ' And no thanks to you!" thundered the priest. "How dare you, ladrone, let one of my friends fall overboard, and narrowly escape drowning! Have I not learned you better manners?" "It was the senor's fault alone," Antonio answered; and I backed that opinion so strongly, the priest-was obliged to admit that his proteg, was not so bad as he might be., "You shall drink a glass of wine with us, and- hope for bettear   ' NEWS OF THE MSSING        309 1.   09 luck the next time," I cried, handing the fellow a bumper, which he tossed off with considerable relish.  "Do you bring us news, Antouio?"Benventuro asked.  "I do, senor," was the answer. i "Well, what is it? Speak quickly, and speak plainly." The lady, senor, is at the Convent of San Sebastian." How know you this?" we all asked in a breath. "I heard so not two hours since, senors." '"Bah! the report mayJ have been false." "No, senors; I saw th'e lady with :my own eyes, lookingthroug agrating."       .       .     .   . , "Tell me"I cried, starting from the table, sobeed in a minute,- ' "how she looked and acted, or what she said."'  "Senor, I had no time to speak /with her, and if I had looked lo'ng in one direction, my motives would have been suspected. I saw the lady, however,. and mournful] enough she seemed." i    "Is there any chance for her to escape? Can I see her? Can I    speak with her, even for a moment?"I cried, tremblin g with impatienee.  '"What madness to ask such a    question!" the priest said. Every avenue to the onvent is guarded and you can't pass in or out without being noticed." "I have thought of a plan," the spy remarkedl, after a moment's consideration, "that I  think  might answer. -I found out that Father Juan has gone to Caveta, to be absent two or three days, and the business that called him away was too urgent to beneg--- le'cted, even for the sake of Donna  Teresa. I also learned that'. he removed her to the convent thinkig  she wuldbe saf  there "- I  ell      whdat yoususpect.

'"And wEhat kind -of disguise do ,you suppose-a man can wear, to deceive the Argus eves' of the convent people?"I demanded. - "He must go disguised as a woman, senor," was 'the answer. "Bah!" cried the priest; "Father Juan is too sharp -to'be caught in that manner. He would detect the imposition at a glance."                      -  "Father Juan would, but the padre is not at the convent, and if things are managed rightly the lady will be free before he re- turns. I can have an interview with my friiend, who acts- duriting his absence, and by the free use of wine I don't think he will be in a condition to tell a woman from a monkey, and before he gets sober Donna Teresa can be at liberty." "And pray how?" demanded the priest, who, being in the same business that Father Juan was, felt a little interested. ' We must be near the convent at a certain hour, and 're, main there until daylight, waiting for signals from the one who is within. A rope-ladder must be drawn up, and by that, after the iron bars are wrenched from the window, must the - lady escape." For a few minutes we remained quite silent, astonished at the bold plan that was laid before us. Suddenly Allen spoke. a "You 'have told us how to get out, now tell us how to get, ir the convent." "The matter is quite simple, senor. One of you must act 'tei lady, and the senor (pointing to Tom) must play the part of a lover. He is unknown, and can do so with my friend without- detection. He must represent that he -wishes to boardl: the lady at the convent for a few day,' until -his vessel sails. If hee 'pay an ounce in advance, but a very few questions will be asked of" him." "4 There's something in the fellow's reasoning, after all. Gu lermoo, can't you take-the part of a woman for a few hours?"  I rubbed my mustache as an answer.  .  .  O, it- can be shaved off, and your whole face made smbdothi in ten minutes. If you could look a little modest, I should hav?' no fears for the result."              -  4  I had to thank the priest for his good opinion,' and after-a;fe more words I agreed to enter the Convent of San Sebastian in:tli1h character of a'womati, and thus make a bold blow for m'y ifre   d    '. ;.E ^^^WCTEB1 ,l .        , Thereat was,-a perilous oe but te-priZe as,' W orly IUS ^ t:1^.1"18 ^but the--pr izltho ! dange-rincurred.                , I'Orn cS Mthe ost disgu-stO mai in t pa nd hedino Conceal it.                 n , ....... ho T'To think. that I Rho,.Id  "i^XSS       ^ mrte -- :ever make l ' is more than I can enda ver make hoee ta.:man,"hesak, C            iare.

At this stage Antoniooleft the house for the convent, with four bottles of champagne in a basket - a sight that caused the priest to sigh most dolefully, and to wish that his duty let him to undertake so delicious a job as drnkinking the best of cham- pagne. '"You will want these few articles in your pockets, in case the  bars are obstinate, and refuse to yield," Antonio said, laying upon I the table a- saw not longer than my finger, yet of such admirable  steel, that it was capable of cutting through the most obdurate iron, a small iron " jimmy,"' such as burglars find very useful in this country, a revolver: not larger than a baby's hand, and  lastly, a ball of twine. Luckily, our women are fond of convenience, and therefore have quite a number of pockets in their skirts and dresses; so I had no difficulty in placing all the tools, so kindly loaned me,! out of sight; yet I had only to raise my dress and they were at, hand.  By three o'clock I was dressed, not in the Spanish style, for my shoulders and bust would not have borne an inspection; but t after the manner of a young maiden, chary of her charms, and  inclined to modesty; and after I was all ready with an elegant white bonnet, covered with flowers of every hue, and a thick veil to hide: my blushes', I ventured to approach the glass and view my- self; and I don't fear contradiction, when I boldly state that I have seen worse looking women than the counterfeit which I pre- sented. "A trifle more stuffing for the chest," said the priest, " wouldl improve the appearance of things in that region. Here, look at- Gracia, and see the difference between the two;" and despite the girl's blushes, he compelled her to stand 'beside me to show the contrasts The defect was soon remedied, and then they complained that my dress did not have the right swell in the rear, and consider- able work was required before that defect was remedied, and I was declared, even by the fastidious Tom, a fit subject for his gallantry. - ' Perhaps it would be as well if you understood only the Eng- lish language, while-at the convent. It would save .you ianty 9.   OFF FOR THE;:CONVENTS.       :313 ,questions, if brought in contact with the inmates of. the ;institu- :tion," the priest -said. ' Let Tom represent that his, lady is. a Catholic, and desirous of remaining at the convent while heb is absent from the city on business; and he may represent anything else he pleases, that is not improbable. He is conversant enough with the lantguage to make himself' understood, and if he sticks for a word, let him hold out a gold piece. That is, a language :which is known the- world over. None fail to. comprehend its magic influence, and but few 'can withstand its temptation, more is the pity.' , The good man sighed, as though he was never guilty of taking  a bribe in his life. Tom -listened to his instructions with a greedy ear, and felt quite proud to think that his Spanish was complimented, for he was- rather. weak on that -point..     - After a few. more lessons a carriage was called!, and Tom, hat -in hand, assisted me to it. I heard a suppresmsed exclamation as I passed down the stairs, and, on-looking back, saw that little Gracia was crying as though her heart would break.  "We shall remain in the house until night, and will take care of your servant," Allen said.     . : But remember she is to be treated like a sister during .my absence," I replied.                  . '   ' ": Of course, honor bright, you. know; " and before I had time to say more, Tom hurried me to the carriage, and we drove ff, the priest at an upper window pronouncing a benediction upon us as we started. While riding through the streets, I began to comprehend the magnitude of the undertaking which I had commenced. I knew there was much danger, but I felt :that I was ready to encounter :it for the love of my beautiful wife. ' t .seenedito -,me that if I could only be assured of her escape, I wotuld willingly assume e much greater risks. We rattled over the bridge that:spans the Pasig at a much faster rate than I thought necessary,and I would willhngly have told the driver to ude less expeiition:, if I, had. not feared to betray my knowledge:of the Spanish language byspeak-. i ng.-, It struck me also, that :Tom had given secret -orders for i a  quick pace; for, confound him, I' really thelieve, that hel was -somewhat; ashamed of his .company, athough j. am sure I loled  -. very well, :and: even commaarede th0 respect of three Spn ish '   :' ' :     - , ,  ' , ' - :i ,. ,e   314       LIFE3 IN THE EAST INDIES. officers, who took off their hats and made me a low bow, just as we reached the end of the bridgre. "Well, if they ain't big fools not to know a woman from a man!" my friend muttered. The Convent of San Sebastian is located in the city proper of Manila, near the border of the bay, and to reach it a gate guarded by soldiers has to be passed. The gate, after eleven o'clock, is closed, and none can pass or repass without a written permit, signed by the captain of the guard, or the governor general. I had not thought of the matter before, till it suddenly occurred to me that, if we could not leave the city at any hour of the night, Teresa's escape would be frustrated. "Tom," I said, addressing My companion, who was sucking the head of his cane with a diligence that was worthy of all praise, "'you must tell Benventuro to get a written pass for our party to leave the city. He is gifted with an imagination suf- ficient to find an excuse for, asking for such a document. Don't forget to remind him of it." ' "All right," Tom answered, taking his cane from his mouth a sufficient length of time to speak, and then recommnenced suck- ing it as though dying for nourishment. In a few minutes the carriage entered the court-yard of the convent, a gloomy-looking building, with a wall extending Com- pletely around it, excepting on that portion which faced the street; and that part of the structure had no windows in the first story, for fear the curiosity of the citizens might be provoked and ex- cited. I glanced towards the windows in the second story, and saw that a number of faces were peering at us through the iron bars, but I did not recognize the features of my wife. The instant the carriage was within the court-yard, the heavy gates were closed as though to cut off all retreat. I glanced at Tom, and saw that- his face was pale as ashes, and that he was visibly agitated. I felt my heart beat quick, but by a powerful effort I managed to maintain my composure, and seem indif- ferent. C What is your pleasure, senor?" asked the portero, an aged A-  an with a face that would not pass for an honest one, in any part of the world. "We wish to see the holy Father Juan," Tom managed to answer.   IN THE CO!VENT.         315 c; He is absent, senor, and will not return until day after too morrow." How my heart jumped at these words! I could have embraced the man for joy, and even his face did not look as bad as when I first saw it. "[ I have a lady here I wish to board at the convent for a few days," Tom managed to say. 'u Ah, Lorenzo( can attend to you as well as the padre. I will call him, senor, if you will enter our poor abode." Tom assisted me to alight, and with as much grace as possible, I entered the reception-room of the convent. The porter disap" peared, and left us wondering whether Lorenzo was the person Antonio had spoken of;, and whether he was drunk enough to suit our purpose. We did not have to wait more than ten minutes for the steward's appearance, and the instant he entered the room, I was confident that at least 'one bottle of my champagne was beneath;,his waist-belt, and that he was anxious to put another there without any unnecessary delay. He cast; an impatient glance at me, but my blushes were partly concealed by the lace veil, which I found -stood me in good service. ' What are your wishes, senor?" the steward asked of Tom. : Well, I - you see-- going out of town -- a few days - this lady feared - don't like to stay alone --pay you well for your trouble - money no object;" and Tom stumbled on in his con- fusion, until I feared he would spoil all by his conduct. But luckily for us Lorenzo was about half happy, and was anxious to be wholly happy; so he paid but little attention to my friend. He only knew that an application was made to board a lady for a few days, and as the request was not a singular or unusual one, he only stopped to consider if there was money enough in the pocket of the gentleman to pay :for the accommoda- tion desired. I saw what was passing in the man's mind, and I spoke to Tom in English. "Hand him the ounce, and promise another if I am well ac- commodated," I said. Tom thrust his hand in his pocket, and exposed to the glisten- ing eyes of the steward several doubloons. "Give the lady the best of accomnaodations and kind treatment, and another ounce shall be yours," he cried. "She shall be treated like a princess, senbor," Lorenzo saids   316       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. pocketing the money with wonderful dexterity, and then ringing a bell that rested upon the table. The ringing was instrumental in calling to the room a thin, withered old woman, with a huge bundle of keys attached to her girdle, and a nose that looked snuffy. "Here is a lady who is to board at the convent for a few days. She is to receive the best of attention,- and the best food," the steward said. "And where am I to find the time to attend to all the women, I should like to know. There's one here now, who keeps me running from morning till night, and I don't get a civil word from her. I wish that she was miles from here, or with her husband she keeps calling for all the time." "Don't get angry, Barbara, for you will have a spell to rest your weary limbs by and by, when the convent is rich. Show the senora to her room, and introduce her to the sisters, if she desires company." The old woman didn't refuse to obey the commands of the steward, although she continued to mutter to herself and take snuff with avidity. "Well," said Tom, rising, "I suppose this is a hint for me to make myself scarce, and I am only too glad to do so. Good by (after an immense struggle), my dear, and don't keep awake nights thinking of me." He held out his hand as- he spoke, but the eyes of the steward were on us, and I determined to save my reputation for affec- tion, even if I lost it afterwards. We were conversing in Eng- lish, which language I supposed the two listeners knew nothing about. "Thomas, my beloved," I cried,4throwing my arms around his neck, and straining his head to my bosom, "farewell. Avoid bad company and you will be happy. Keep in doors nights, and don't expose yourself more than possible to the blandishmlents of -women."                 '  1"O, bother!" cried the lover, with a shade of vexation upon his face. "Don't make a fool of yourself. I can't stand it, and I won't. I suppose you will want to kiss me next." 4' And what would be the harm if I did?"I deimanded. CC Ain't you the idol of my soul? and won't I be true to you during your absence?"    AN AFFECTING SCENE.        317 c, Go to thunder!" he cried, breaking away from my embrace; and to prevent his disgust from being seen, hid his face in his handkerchief. a' The senor is affected at parting," cried the steward; " but the senor must remember that it is but for a short time." Tom could not reply. He went out of the room in a hurry, and after the old woman had looked me over a little, she told me to follow her - a command that I obeyed with some readiness. "But few English women visit our convent.," the old woman said, as she hobbled along before me, while mounting a flight of steps . I pretended not to understand, and my cicerone, after waiting a moment, continued:--- "I wonder if all the English ladies can walk up stairs as fast' as she does. May the saints preserve me, she seems capable of taking two steps at a time." I took the hint instantly, and modulated the lengths of my strides. ( I wonder if she will be troublesome, and want much atten- tion while here? because she won't get it from me, I can tell her that much. I hope she will give me something when' she goes away, because I'm nearly out of snuff and cigars," "' Senora," I managed to say, 'c me give you this, very good -me."  I put in her hand an ounce of gold, and the stare that she gave the money and me was highly ludicrous. ' Fop me? she asked, thumping herself upon her bony breast.- ' Si," I replied. ' M21cas gracias, senora," she cried; and in spite bf my resist- ance, she seized my hand and covered it with kisses. "Only to think," the old woman continued, talking to herself, " a doubloon given me, and Father Juan will never know it. I can buy cigars enough to last ten years, and a drop of Wrine, too, if need be. Some ladies are liberal, that is a fact, and this one shall fare well for her generosity." - By the time she had finished speaking, we had passed through several doors, which were carefully bolted after us; and then- I found that we were in a long corridor, witl:h chambers on each side. The doors stood open, and I was enabled to see that the rooms contained but anu apology for a bedstead, and only a blanket and   318       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. a small pillow for bedding. No girls-were visible, and I rightly conjectured that they were in another part of the building at work, embroidering handkerchiefs and dresses. I saw that one side of the corridor overlooked the street and the other a large garden, and I trembled for fear that I should be given a room on the latter  side. But the old woman, after a moment's hesitancy, muttered  to herself,-- "I'll give her a room where she can look at the men once in a while, for they say that some women like to -be in the company . of the brutes, although for what reason is more than I can tell." I found that I had some trouble to keep -my countenance just at that moment, for it occurred to me that the venerable virgin knew but little of the world, and its pleasures and pains. "Here," she said, pointing to a room of more pretensions than the others, " you may sleep or sit, just as you please. If you want company I will send some of the sisters to attend you, or, if you would like, you can go to the work-rooms and the gardens; and see them." I don't suppose she had the slightest idea that I understood her; but her gestures and grimaces were so expressive that no one could hardly have helped comprehending some portion of her signs. I thought I would visit the garden, and found a few words to state my wish. "Our'garden does not amount to much, for the convent is poor. But it looks very well. I have no doubt that we shall find a num- ber of the sisters, and perhaps one or two of the boarders there." I hoped that among them I should see my wife, yet I trembled with agitation at the thought. "Our rooms don't look so well as usual to-day, for the holy Father Juan is absent, and the sisters and boarders take advan- tage at such times. Last night, may the saints protect me, they acted like young devils, and all I could do or say was not sufficient i to keep them quiet. Their talk was not of slaints, but of men and worldly matters." 'I thought that they but proved themselves women, whether confined in convents or parlors; and if they had not sometimes exercised their tongues, they would not have been worthy the name of females.  The old woman opened a door and led me down a long flight of stone steps, and when we reached- the bottom, I fund I was .   THE CONVENT GARDEN.        819 dlready in the garden, but shut in by such high walls that the iurrounding houses could not be seen, and any attempt to scale he walls, without a long ladder, would have been useless. I found hat the garden consisted of a number of well-laid-out walks, a New fruit trees, and an arbor, which was at the farther end, and 3overed with grape vines. Just as we entered the garden, I saw I young girl leave the arbor and advance to meet us. She was very handsome, and but a few years younger than Teresa. ', Well, Sara, is she still the same?" asked my companion. "There is no change --her husband is the only one who occu- Pies her thoughts for a moment. With him she could live or die. Without him --" "Well."' "She will die."  ' My head seemed to swim at the conversation, and I was com- )elled to lean against a tree for support. It seemed to me that ahey were speaking of my' wife, and I longed to question them, but lid not dare to. "Does she weep?" my companion asked, speaking of some lerson who appeared to be in the arbor. 1' Sometimes she is in tears, and sometimes she is loud in her exclamations of anger, and threatens loudly. Poor lady! I pity ler," the gentle-looking nun said. "Pity her for what?" Barbara demanded, in a shrill tone, and vith some asperity. "Because she persists in refilsing to be happy ntd spending her days with us in peace and quietness, instead f being trampled upon by brutal m'en? I am ashamed of you,' iara." "I'm sure I didn't mean anything that is wrong," sighed the )retty little nun, her dark eyes cast to the ground, as though she was trying'to trace in the sand a picture of one of the detested men mentioned by her antique mentor. "I am sure, Barbara, : like the life of a nun; but I should think it must be very  i  pleasant to live in the world, and be married to a handsome young - nan who would love you dearly."                I "May the blessed saints refuse to listen to such abomination," - 4ried the withered old hag, holding up her hands in horror at the - ;upposition. ' I must tell Father Juan of your expressions." "No, pray don't," pleaded the little beauty, the tears starting o her eyes. " I should have to do penance, and I have already i . * i   320       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. performed many. I did not become a nun of my own free will, and so a few of my repinings should be excused." ' Excused!" shrieked the old lady; "I shall not excuse you, but, for the good of your soul, take care to tell Father Juan of your conduct. Away with you to your chamber, and sleep with- out supper if you can." The little beauty was slowly moving away to do the bidding, when I interposed. "Pardon, senora;"I said, in the worst gibberish that I could possibly assume. "Pray forgive the sister, and let her keep me company in the garden. You shall not suffer by your generpsity, on the word of an English lady."  It was only by the most painful contortions Itht I succeeded in making myself understood, but I accompanie n my words with a small gold piece whic;h was a most powerful persuader. "O, if the denora desires Sister Sara for a companion, I am willing, and shall readily overlook her disrespect for the holy life of a nun. You may remain, Sara, and if the English lady desires anything, you may supply her." The antique virgin once more glanced at her gold in a sly man- ner, and left us alone. "O, senora," cried the beautiful nun, her large black eyes filled with tears, " how can I thank you for the interest you have taken in me? By your influence I have escaped a severe punishment;" and with uncontrollable emotion, the little girl threw her arms around my neck and kissed me. For a while I forgot my assumed character. That is, I think I did, for I have a very indistinct recollection of the scene, so con- fused was I.  It seems to me that I threw my arlms around the slight form of the nun, and pressed her with more than woman's strength to my heart. I have also a misty remembrance of kiss. ing the tears from her eyes, and then kissing her lips. But the recollection of the event is dream-like and indistinct. The poor girl seemed somewhat sprprised at the warmth of my affection; but on the whole, I am inclined to think that she did not dislike the treatment she received. "There, dear, don't cry any more," I whispered. \' As long as I am  in the convent, I will protect you. You shall attend upon none but me, and I assure you hat your duties shall be light."   -   BiY NEW PROTEGE.         321, "O. senora," the nun. said, with a voice as sweet as a bird's, '"I am but too grateful for your kindness, and shall never forget it. I hope you will remain here long, but not as a nun, for they don't treat us well. I tell you this in confidence, and I hope you won't tell old M1other Barbara, the mean thing, for if you did, she would make me eat bread and water. But I am dying to have you tell me something about the world. I can listen to you for- ever on that topic. We can talk all the afternoon, and if you ask Barbara, she will let me sleep in the room with you, so that we can talk all night also." Here was a'proposition from a girl not more than sixteen years of age, that was not calculated to strike a modest man in a favor- able light. Poor thing! had she known that I was a wolf in lamb's clothing, she would have died before she suffered the words to pass her lips. ' Tell me," the pretty little nun. continued, putting her arms around my waist, and leanuing her head upon my shoulder, as con- fiding as though she had known me for years, " are the men as bad as Sister Barbara represents. Father Juan says they are, and that they only dream of wickedness, and when awake, are continually thinking of sin. I am sure if such is the case,. I am glad I am here; but I sometimes get a glimpse of men in the street, and they look as gentle and harmless as doves. I am sure I know some sisters that look much crosser than men. Alas! I never had a chance to speak to one, excepting the priests, -and I don't like them, but you mustn't say so,- since I was seven years of age, and that is a long, long time ago." "' There are bad men in the world," I replied, " but all are not so; and I am sure that, if you mingled with the world, nol one would be heartless enough to injure you. You would be loved most devotedly by some young man, who would only live for your happiness." "O, I should like that," the little beauty cried, clapping her hands with joy at the thought. "I am sure it must be deligitful to know that a brave mani is thinking of one all the time; and for the matter. of that, I shouldn't suppose it would do anlAharm if half a dozen men loved one at the same time."' Here was a confession from a child of nature that-was most- amusing to hear, and in, spite of mly attempts at gravity, I could not prevent laughing, at which the little nun pouted, and then 21   822       'LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. relented, and threw her arms around my neck, and kissed me most heartily.            , "Just reverse the case," I said, kissing her in return; for I thought that she would feel slighted unless I did so. "How would you like the idea of half a dozen girls loving the man whom you loved?" "I would scratch their eyes out," was the true woman's answer; and by the sparkle of her own, I had no doubt that she spoke as she'felt. A Spanish maid generally speaks as she feels, and when I she loves she is not backward in manifesting it, even before the world; but she is careful to exact full' obedience on the part of  her lover, and if he is not faithful, her love can change to hate with most wonderful rapidity. I thought, as I wound my arm around the-little beauty's waist, that, if I had never seen Teresa, I should have felt but too happy in giving Sara my heart, and securing hers in return. But thre ex- change was now impossible, for Sara was bound to a convent life by vows which could not be broken except by the pope alone. I pitied the poor girl friom my heart, and I would have willingly assisted her to escape'; but the risk was too great, and if I even entertained the idea, I banished it from my mind. 4 I hope you will stay at the convent a long, long time," Sara said, " for I have but few companions that I care to speak to, and those know nothing about the world, as you do. Most of them are -old, and. think only of saints and heaven, and the time when they are to leave this world for another. For the past two days a lady has been stopping here whom I really love and pity, and she has been like a true friend, but so filll of her own griefs that she can't listen to mine. If I ask her if she is married, she begins to cry and call upon sonee one to save her. Father Juan told me to attend on her, and say that the life of a nun was the happiest in existence; but I won't say such a thing, for I don't believe it. But, if I was disposed to talk as he desires me, the lady would not listefl; for she is proud and haighty, and very n beautiful. -I never saw any one half so handsome." I kne* that she was speaking of my wife, and only by a power- ful effort could I command my agitation, and listen in silence to what was said. "I think," Sara said, speaking very low, and very confidentially, '&that there is some mystery connected with the handsome lady   -A NUN S -CONFESSION.       323 which Father Juan don't want the nuns to know. He left orders that only six of us should be allowed to speak to her, and that every word she said should be repeated to him on his return ho'me. I am- certain that I'm not going to play the spy for any one, and especially for a man I don't like, and who keeps me here contrary to my will." I was about to inquire where Teresa was at the present time, but the little nun's tongue got the start of mne, and I could -not in- terrupt her. (' I suppose you wonder why I am here,'"Sara said. c' I can tell you in a few words. It is not my choice that I took the veil, I assure you, and if my mother had -not died when I was young, I don't think she would have been willing/,that I should have buried myself alive in this old building. I was in hopes that the earthquake, the other night .would shake it down and set us free, and I even prayed the saints to that effect; but the saints- didn't pay any attention to my prayers. I suppose it is because I amp not good enough, for some of the nuns say that they have only to ask the saints for a favor and it is granted. I don't believe it, though ; for, if it was so, some of them would ask for more beauty than they have got-wouldn't they?" I told her that, having no knowledge of the charms of her sister nuns, I couldn't safely answer that question. I then reminded her that she was about to tell some important facts regarding herself. "O, yes; so I will. Well, when I was nine years of age my mother died, and I can remember of- crying myself to sleep every night, when I thought that I should never ride on the ,Calsarda again, as I used to do when she was well. (), how I used to enjoy it! The cavaliers, On horseback, would gallop up to us, and tell me that I was handsome, and would one day break their hearts,; and that used to make me laugh. I am sure that the prophe- cies were false, for I shall break my own heart, and never have a chance to make the men feel unhappy.:, I only:wish I could. What sport it would be -:wouldn't it?" I shook my head, for the honor of my sex was concerned.-  "Well, at any rate, I could tease them, as I sometimes tease Sister Barbara ; and then she scolds me, and threatens to tell Father Juan; but she don't always. But I must inform you how I; came ,here, or you will -never know. t Ashort- time after myy mother   324       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. died, my father married a second wife, and she used to hate me, although for what reason Hcan't tell, as I always spoke pleasantly to her, and filledi my hair with flowers when she was married. She was not a kind-woman, by any means, and a servant told me one day, that my father married her because she was rich. If such was the casei I wish she had kept Iler riches and lived by herself, for I was never happy after she entered the house." Here the young girl wiped the tears from her large black eyes, and seemed to think of her childish days with a good deal of sorrow. "At length," Sara continued, t my new mother said that I must go to school, and-I was sent to this convent to learn music, and here I have remained ever since; then all the nuns told me what a delightful and pious life they led, and how happy they were; and, like alsilly girl, I believed them. I took the veil; but I cried when they cut off my hair, and I believe that I have cried every day since. I have never seen my father from the time I took the veil, or his wife, either. I think now that they should have prevented me fronr committing so rash an act-don't you? You are silent, my friend," the nun said, leading me from the direc- tion of the arbor, where I so longed to go, but fealed to enter. 4"Do you not think that I could serve the Virgin and the saints much better outside of these gloomy walls than within them?" "It is the blessed hereafter that you are expected, to look for- ward to, my poor child; and whether you are in a convent, or mingling with the world, your prayers should be directed to secure that happiness beyond the grave which all expect to enjoy. The world is beyond your reach. Think not of it, and you will soon get accustomed to your lot."       ^ "' But the world is not beyond my reach," the little nun said, pettishy; and then sinking her voice, she whispered, ( You won't tell of me- will you?" ' The saints forbid," I answered. u Well, sometimes I. have fancied I would try and escape from the convent dressed in boy's clothes. I can look from the top - of the convent and seq many vessels in the bay, and I have thought if I could once get clbar of the walls, that I might find refuge on board of a big ship which would take me to some country where I could earn a livelihood by teaching music.

O, I should so like to see foreign countries, and learn their customs! But I never shall.' The poor girl bowed her head, and once more the tears poured forth; but just at that moment we heard voices in advance of us, and saw half a dozen white-dressed females, sitting on some rough benches, at work embroidering. The little nun's tears were dried instantly, and her look of grief was exchanged for one of composure. , Who are they?"I asked. O' O, those are sisters Prudencia, Cartola, Clotilda, Juana, Sa- bina, and Dorotea. They are talking scandal, I'll warrant you. They are real ill-natured, and, I dare say, will find some fault in your dress ; but you mustn't mind them - will you?" Of course I said that I shouldn't care in the least, but I'm afraid I rather prided myself on my costume too much for that. "Suppose that I should pretend not to speak Spanish," I re- marked. '"I could then learn all they said about me, and we could laugh about it some time when alone." "O, that would be delightful!" cried the little beauty. i I should so much like to tease them, for they tell me that I'm plain, and that my form is not goods: although I'm sure it is better than theirs. Just feel, and see how fat I am; " and to my surprise and nervous consternation, she placed my arm ;around her waist to verify her words. We were too near the nuns to make a good inspection, and as I saw that the aged virgins were regarding me with some interest, found I had got to attend to my deportment or be exposed. I felt the warm blood rush to my cheeks, and by a careless move- meut dropped my veil partly, so that they could not see the whole of my face and detect its masculine outlines, if they were well posted in man-ology. "What is your name?" whispered Sara, just as she was ready' to introduce me.     : "Guillermo," I replied, forgetting, in my confusion, that I had given my proper cognomen. "Guillermo!" repeated. the little nun in surprise; ( why, that is a man's name. You must not mention the name-of a man here." O0, it's the name of my lover," I whispered, softly. "I was ,   32(6       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. thinking of him;" and while I was talking I was endeavoring to consider what woman's name would'sound the best. The six thin, bilious-looking nuns stared at me, and began to whisper to each other.              I "Confound them," I thought, "' they are already beginning to pick me to pieces. I know it by the snapping of their eyes." "Your name,"  cried Sara, with a poke of her elbow in my ribs. My wits had fairly deserted me, I believe, for I could think only of Teresa and Gracia. I determined to choose the name of my wife, and run the risk. Miss Teresa,"' I answered, in return for the poke that Sara gave me; and I was careful to give the English pronunciation in preference to the Spanish. "Sisters," cried my guide, " this is Ris Teresa, who intends to board at the convent for a few days while her lover is absent." B ("Sara!" cried the eldest and most sour-looking of the nuns. "Sara!" cried the most bilious one. /"Sara!" echoed the others, rolling up their eyes as though sud?- denly seized with cramp in the region of the stomach. "Now, what have I done?" whispered the little nun, her black  eyes full of futn. "You have spoken of a lover within these sacred walls. Such a word should not be heard here, where religion reigns supreme." "Well, I didn't know that it was wrong to speak the word. I thought it-was only wicked to have a lover. But I won't men- tion the word again, if I can help it.- At any rate, this English lady don't know what we are talking about; so we have spared her feelings." I saw that they were agreeably surprised at the information, for it enabled them to pick me to pieces without mercy. "I have always heard that English ladies had large feet and hands, and now I am  assured of the fact," the old virgin re- marked, comparing her black and bony paws with my rather small (for a man) hands.                  - But her feet are larger in proportion than her hands," another said, sticking out one foot; and, by the saints, it had no stocking  on, and what made the matter worse, she was not over particular how much of the accompanying portion of the leg she also exposed   'PICKED TO- PIECES.        327 to- view..- It was dark, very dark, and didn"t look remarkably clean. i4 You had better not say anything about your feet," my little nun said, "'for I am sure that the English lady has as good a foot asI, or you. Just see if she has not ;" and down went her narrow foot close by mine for comparison. After that demonstrationa the elder nuns turned on my dress, and left my bodily defects alone. "t What a frightful thing she has got on her head!" one remarked, alluding to the bonnet which I wore, and which, I have no doubt, the lady from whom it was borrowed considered thel most perfect thing of its kind that ever doubled Cape Hope. 6"But it's nothing compared to, her dress -- it is high in; the neck, and looks as though intended to suffocate her. How can people be so foolish as to wear such things?" ("Perhaps, Sister Juana, she is as destitute of - "     a The little nun did not have a chance tp finish her remarks, for the antiquated virgins made common cause, and commenced a war upon her that threatened to last as long a8s the Trojan siege. They called her a fool, or very near one, an impudent little hussy, and concluded by threatening to report her to Father Juan as soon as he returned; and while the war of words was raging loudest, the sudden ringing of a bell was heard, and the nuns gathered up their work and rushed towards the; building as though not a moment was to be Jost. Sara and myself were left alone once more, and very thankful I was. "There they go," cried the little nun, looking after her sisters with some contempt, " and I should not care if I never saw their faces again." 6"But where have they gone?"I asked, somewhat anxious to discover what. could have started them so suddenly. "O that bell was intended to call the old nuns to dinner. We young ones have but two meals a day -morning and night; and very hungry we get sometimes." Once more I directed my steps towards the arbor, and had nearly reached it, when Sara suddenly stopped. "We won't go there," she said, "' for a lady is in the- arbor, ';;: md she don't care about talking with any one. She is even cross . o0 me, sometimes."  I did not heed her words, but walked on, and rather reluctantly : "' '     * I " - r ':,   828       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. the little nun accompanied me. We reached the door, and I saw a lady sitting with her back towards us; but she did not move until Sara ran up to her and put her arms around her neck. Then she turned her head, and to my great joy I saw that I was standing in the presence of my wife! CHtAPTER XII. M3E'TING ONErS WIFE.--A LONG CONVERSATION. - THE DISCOV. ERY. --PLANS FOR ESCAPE, &C., &C., &C. TERESA merely glanced at me, and as my face was- somewhat shaded by my veil, she could see nothing to startle her. In fact I thought that she appeared amazed at my intrusion, although she was very gentle with the little nun, and even returned her kiss, which I considered an aggravation. I saw that there were traces of tears in her eyes, and she looked as though she had been weep- ing when we entered the arbor. '"You are still pining for your liberty," Sara said, seating her- self by Teresa's side, and putting an arm around her waist. "And my husband," the wife replied, but in so low a tone that I barely beard it; and I thought that I saw the tears steal into her eyes again, although I knew that qhe was struggling to repress them. '"Well, don't grieve any more to-day. You will soon, perhaps, gain your liberty, and. then whom shall I have for a companion? Even now your husband may be laboring for your liberation." "Alas! I fear more for him than myself. He is a stranger in the country, rash and headstrong, and not calculated to cope with the Jesuits who surround him on every side. I know not even if he be living at this moment;" and, the tears of my wife fell fast.  * How I longed to comfort her! yet I did not dare to make my- self known in the presence of Sara, "But surely he can apply to the archbishop for your libera- tion," Sara said.   AN INTRODUCTION TO' ONE S WIFE. ,    329 "Even that is. denied him, for we were married without his consent; and besides my husband is a Protestant." "May the saints preserve us," cried Sara, in a tone that showed how much prejudice she entertained against the creed. "Did you think of your soul when you gave yourself to a heretic?" "No ; I thought only of our happiness, and how much my hus- band loved me. O, if you cotfld only see him you would not won- der at my marriage. He is so kind, and gentle, and virtuous; in fact, so different from other men, that I fear even you would love him."- "Well," replied Sara, after mature consideration, ' I don't know but I might, for I feel very much like loving some one, and per- haps it would not make much difference in heaven if he was a Protestant or Catholic. But while I have been chatting with you I have forgotten my new friend, who is to board with us for a t few days. Perhaps she can give you some information regarding your husband, for she is an English lady, but speaks Spanish as well as I." Teresa looked at me eagerly, and I ventured to appoach and take a seat beside her. "Do you know the Senor Guillermo -?" she asked. "I have met with' him often in society lately," I replied, dis- guisincg my voice as much as possible; but in spite, of my pre- cautions I saw her face flush at the sound of it., and her eyes scru- tinized my looks as though trying to trace the features of her husband. "Is he well and happy?" she asked. "He is well, but far from being happy," I replied. -"I have heard from him the story of his wrongs, and hope that he will soon devise means to procure your escape or liberation. He has not been idle since your incarceration, and once or twice, when  he thought that your place of imprisonment was discovered, has been prevented from seeing you through unforeseen events. He and his friends are working quietly, but :most diligently, so  that you have no cause to feel discouraged a's yet." "You may think I have not cause for grief; but if you knew to what'indignities I have been subjected since the night I was abducted, how H have been entreated and threatened that ; unless I took the veil, and renpounced my fortune to the:convent- and Father Juan, you would only wonder that my reason re-:   330       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. mained, or that I was not dead. But I have prayed for life and sense, and the saints have granted my supplications." I could see some of the old pride in her last words, and I longed to embrace her for her unyielding spirit in spite of priestly perse- cution. Just at that moment I heard a bell ring, and at its sound Sara started to her feet. "My dinner is ready," she cried, " and unless I am prompt I shall find the table bare. The young sisters, when not thinking of prayers and penance, are apt to concentrate "their ideas on table joys, and on such occasions strive for more than their share. You will both excuse me for a short time, for it will not take me long to eat six spoonfuls of rice and a banana." She darted out of the door while the bell was still ringing, and we heard her footsteps as she ran over the gravelled walk towards the convent. Teresa and 'myself were left alone for the first time since our marriage, and, yet our meeting was likely to prove some- what embarrassing; for how to make myself known and convince her that I was her husband, taxed my ingenuity. Only for a short time did we remain silent, yet never was there a more impatient bridegroom than myself just at that moment. 4' I hope that your visit to the convent is not to be of long du- ration," Teresa said, ' and that when you leave you will manage to carry a letter to my husband. Even if I should not have the pleasure of seeing you again, I trust that you will inform him that my thoughts 'are his. day and night, and that if we never meet again on earth, we shall in heaven, where the plots against our happiness will fail, and where we shall be united, never more to. part." "I will bear your message faithfully," I replied; i" but perhaps you may soon see your husband and inform him of your senti- ments without my aid. He may be nearer than you suppose." I spoke in natural tones, and saw that she was surprised while she listened.  "Your voice is so much like the one I love that if I shut my eyes I should think he was by my side." "Then try the experiment," I said, taking a seat close besid her. "No, no," she replied, with a faint smile; " you are a woman,   A STRPRISE.          831' and my husband is too manly to resemble a female. The only resemblance is your, voice." "There are many deceptions in the world,"' I replied. ' Sup- pose, after all, I should prove to you that I was a man." She started and cast an apprehensive glance at me, as though she feared that she was being tricked by the priest in whose power she was. "The conversation has become mystical," she remarked, with a haughty wave of her hand, as though she desired-its discontinu- ance. She took up a book and opened its pages, and seemed to' have forgotten my presence altogether. I remained for a few moments undecided whlat to do. I feared the return of Sara, or the other -nuns, every instant, and it was necessary for my plans that I should make myself known. The only thing I dreaded was woman's favorite disease, hysterics, which is sometimes assumed without the slightest cause, and once started, never knows when to stop. .A. sudden cry from, Teresa would be apt to bring half a dozen nuns to the spot, and if they should find her in my arms and calling me endearing names, the secret would be discovered, and my death by torture most certain. While I thus sat motionless, thinking of the best plan for enlightening -Teresa, she glanced froin her book to my face for the purpose of seeing, I suppose, if I was offended at her words. "Senora Teresa," I said, laying a hand upon her arm and speak- ing slowly and cautiously, " your friends are working hard for your liberty, and to secure it I have been sent tO your assist- ance."   , She did not believe me. I could see that she did *'iot by the calmness of her eyes. She evidently supposed that Father Juan was endeavoring to deceive her or intrap her by some snare. For the purpose of being recognized, I found that I should have toi be more explicit. "Teresa," I whispered, " do you not know me? Do you not suspect who I am?" I threw my veil aside, but the bonnet and its lining of roses and artificial fruits concealed too much of my features for her to recognize me. I knew that her husband's name was on-her lips, but it was dismissed as an impossibility,  - ; .     ,.   332       LIFE IN ,THE EAST INDIES. I untied the bonnet and threw it offi and then raised the wig which the priest was so kind as to borrow for me. "' Teresa," I said, " do you not know your husband?" She knew me then. With a glad cry she threw her arms around my neck, and her head upon my bosom, and there she wept; but the tears now shed were those 9f joy. / "Be calm, darling," I whispered, " and remember that my life depends upon your discretion. If you give the least sign that shall lead the nuns to suppose I'm a man, our happiness is de- stroyed." She was calm enough then, so calm that I considered I was justified in kissing her red lips a few times, just to see if they had lost any of their sweetness; and while I held her dear form in my arms, I forgot my past of misery, and only thought of present happiness. We were too excited to speak for some moments; but at length my wife removed her arms from my neck, and gazed long and anxiously at my face. "Yes," she said at length, " you have mourned for me during my absence. I can see it in spite of your disguise. Your face is pale and thin. You have missed me - have you not?" and down upon my bosom went her head again, and more tears fell from those dear eyes, which were usually so bright and clear. (' Day and night I have sighed for you," I replied, " and not only sighed, but have worked for your deliverance. On the night that I pursued your abductors in the banco, I was almost sure I should recover you, yet came near finding a watery grave. But the saints were merciful, and spared me for this meeting." I thought I would not speak of visiting a ship that night, and drinking half a dozen glasses of punch with old Captain Miller. Women are so confounded particular sometimes, when their affec- tions are concerned? If I had hinted at such a thing, she would have pouted for ten minutes, just as likely as not. I '"O, Guillermo," she murmured, putting up her mouth to be kissed with the innocent frankness of a child, " no sooner did I see you strike the water than I attempted to throw myself into the river, but was prevented 'by Father Juan and his steward. When you sank I fainted, and did not regain consciousness for a long time. When I revived I found myself in this convent, and an old nun standing over me chafing my temples. The -saints   TERESA'S STORY. '      ^  333 forgive me, but I wished that I was dead, and beyond the reach of priests." 6' But you no longer have such thoughts - you desire to live and enjov many years of uninterrupted happiness with your hus- band," I whispered. "Yes, Guillermo, without you life would indeed be a burden. But tell me, how came you here in this disguise?" "' Because I could not come in my proper --character. Gentler men are generally excluded from convents; I believe." "But did you thintk of the danger?" she asked. "Of course I did, and resolved to brave it all for the purpose of once more seeing you, and attempting to set you free." "And can you do so??" she demanded, eagerly. ' I shall try," I replied. "' But all will depend upon vour calm- ness and obedience to iny wishes." (' Am I not calm? And as for obedience, you have but to com- mand, and love and duty alone will prompt me to obey you. As my husband, you have a right to expect it. As a wife, I shall yield it." Bless her little heart! how I' looked at her with admiration and astonishment, and wondered for a brief moment where some of her haughty spirit was concealed, with which she used to pester me during our courting days! She was a woman now-a atrust- ing, loving woman; and I sincerely hoped she would always let me govern her as willingly as she seemed disposed to - allow me while reclining in my arms at the Convent of San Sebastian. But I had my doubts, although I did not fail to reward her con- fession with a few tokens of affection quite common during the/ early stages of our courtship. "Tell me, Guillermo," :my wife said, s when shall you make the attempt for my removal from this dismal abode? If I should be compelled to remain here a month, and listen to the continued whining of the priest's creatures respecting the beauties of a nun's life, I should become insane. Do not let me remain, here any longer than you can possibly help." "The attempt, Teresa, is to be made this night; and in less than ten hours I hope to see you free. But there are difficulties in the way, and on you much will'depend." "So soon?" she cried. " O, how happy Ifeel at even the in- L                  .      .   334       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. formation! Impose the severest discipline upon me, and you shall see how readily I iwill bear it for your sake."' Just then I heard steps upon the walk. I hastily replaced my bonnet, and Teresa and myself took seats at some distance from each other. "Remember, you know me only as an English lady," I whis- pered to my wife. She smiled, and just at that moment Sara, the little nun, entered the arbor. "I ate my dinner in a hurry, for I thought you would feel lonely, and want company. To be sure, there was but little to eat, for, in spite of my exertions to be first, I was last, and the first had devoured most of the rice. I do "wish they would give us food' in the same proportion that they give us prayers and religious exercises. We should feel more like thanking the saints for their favors." The girl little suspected that her presence was not required just at that moment. "I spoke to Sister Barbara," Sara continued, turning to me, ' and she says that I can sleep in your room, if you are willing." I saw a frown gather upon my wife's brow, and I feared that her jealous nature would break out; but to my intense satisfaction she -remained quiet. She looked as though an explanation would be satisfactory, however, and I hastened to give one. '"When you made the proposal to occupy part of my room,' I said, addressing Sara, "I did not return an answer, for fear you would take offence. A few moments since, I forgot your proposi- tion, and agreed to room with this lady," pointing to Teresa. [ ' If she is willing to relinquish my society for the night, I am" sure I shall be happy to oblige you." "Would you?" muttered my wife, a portion of the cloud disap- pearing from her brow.                   ' Won't you let me have her to-night? You can have her to- morrow night," Sara pleaded. 4' No, indeed, I shall do no such thing; and I am astonished at your making such a request," was Teresa's decided answer. I felt-very well satisfied to have these two beautiful creatures quarrelling for the honor of my company, but I had much rather it would have been outside of the convent walls. : It seems to me that I am crossed at every step. If I make i   A LITTLE-JEALOUS.         335 friends, they are taken away from me by some one who has not half as good a claim as I have. It is too bad!" and once more the tears fell from Sara's black eyes; but this time my wife hastened to console her, and after a while she succeeded; but I noticed she did not yield the contested point, or even promise that I should enjoy the little nun's company during my stay in the convent.                 , While the two were talking, a third bell was rung, and Sara intimated that the boarders' table was ready, and proposed to show us to it, for the sake of our society; and although my wife (who, I think, was a little jealous of the nun) protested that she knew the way, and would spare her the trouble, it made no difference; Sara would not take the hint and leave us alone for even a mo- ment. The table for the private) boarders at the convent was some- what better supplied than the one for the nuns, if Sara was to be believed. We found rice and curry, and chicken boiled, and then stuffed with various kLinds of seasoning, among which red pepper predominated. There were two kinds of fruit also-- oranges and bananas; and perhaps in honor of my arrival, Sister Barbara, who acted in the capacity of housekeeper, superior, and general scolder, placed abottle of Weak weak ine upon theztable, which caused Sara to open her eyes to the widest extent, and declare that never in her whole experience had she seen such great liberality, and never expected to again. Poor child! she little knew what magic there was in gold outside as well as inside of a Donvent. My appetite, as well as my wife's, was poor. I was too deeply Impressed with the important part I had to play that night to care br food, and Teresa was too much excited -at our unexpected neeting to be able to eat even an orange. I saw that our friend iara was looking at the chicken with longing eyes, and without vaiting for advice or consent from Barbara, I made her sit down nd attack it. There was a disposition to scowl, but when Barbara : aw that, the nun was under my protection, she :made, no public emonstration of her rage. What was said in private I never, new.            ,       , {I-did manage to induce my wife to drink a glass of wine,'while, helped myself to several; but its quality was so bad that I didn't'. lame her for not wishing bor more. We three were the only   336       LIFE .IN THE EAST I*DIES.' persons at the table, but I saw that a door leading to the chapel was opened frequently, and-iseveral heads were thrust in for the purpose of scrutinizing us, and perhaps noticing how an English lady took her food. I sat with my bonnet -on, however, so but few of them co6ujd see my face,and false hair; for I feared that every moment some of the prying sisters would steal behind me, and fingler my curls for the purpose of seeing if nature or art sup. plied them so profusely. It was dark by the time we had ]inished our supp er, or dinner, as they called it, and then Sister Barbara politely informed me that I could retire to m1iy room, or hear evening vespers in the chapel. I wanted to be alone with my wife, if possible; so I de- clined the invitation to prayers, and Teresa did the same, much to my joy, for I feared that her coyness, which we so much ad- mire in a bride, would impede the preparations I had to make for our escape. There were bars of iron to be sawed off and removed, and' much other work that I desired to perform before the night was far advafinced. Sara looked rather dispirited when she saw that we were to  leave her; but her duties required her presence in the chapel, and with a brief remark that she would room with me the next night, she left us, and Teresa and myself were soon in the apartment that 1 was allotted us, one that overlooked the street. We were not allowed a lamp, and perhaps it was just as well that we were not, although I am sure the blushes upon my wife's face were well worth seeing, when she found that I fastened the door to prevent interruption from the sisters; but ,if the reader expects that I am about to disclose a love scene, he or she is mis- taken. I had too much work to perform, and there was too much at stake to allow such agreeable recreation; but I promised to make amends, if ever we escaped from the convent, and to insure that result, I commenced an inspection of the premises. I found that there was but one window in the room, and that was guarded by four iron bars, each the size of a man's thumb. I commenced a careful examination, and found that the ends of the bars were fixed firmly in the wood-work, and- held in their places by lead. The irons were too close together to admit of one's looking into the street; so I could not tell whether my friends were beneath me, or had not yet reached the rendezvous agreed upon. I looked at my watch and found that :it- was joust nine q             . /   PREPARATIONS FOR ESCAPE,       337 o'clock; and they did not prolnise to be near :me until twelve. I had three hours for using my saw or jimmny,.and I did not doubt but I could make some impression by that time, if no one interrupted me. As foi Teresa, she was all excitement, and insisted upon lend- ing me all the aid in her power; but I feared she would fatigue herself; so I desired that she should sit perfectly still, and only help me with her prayers. She obeyed me; but I could see, even in the dark, her large black eyes turned towards me, and watching every motion that I made with intense interest:. At length I found that I should have to use my saw for the purpose of removing the iron bars, for they were too firmly im- bedded in the wood to be started by the jimmy; but the slight grating noise which the saw made, I feared, would alarm those in the other chambers, for the 'nuns had returned from the chapel, and we could hear Barbara lock them in their room, as though they were so many prisoners, and destined to escape unless extra precautions were 'used to prevent them. I suspended labor, and heard the usual amount of giggling, whispering, and praying, which the nuns indulged in after they were left for the night; and I could also hear my ancient friend Barbara apply her ear to the crack of my door, for the purpose of discovering if we were plot- ting mischief, orlad gone to sleep like Christians. She seemed satisfied, after a while, that the latter supposition was correct, for she moved away, and I 'hoped went to bed, if ever such a faded specimen of' humanity went to bed for the purpose of sleeping, of which I had grave doubts, for she seemed to me destined, like the Wandering Jew, to travel around, and never know rest or happiness. At length all sounds, exceptinog the low tones of some nun who was repeating a number of prayers as a penance, ceased, and I re- commenced my work; but, to my horror, found that the noise was too distinct not to attract attention, and' for a few minutes I was in despair. A little cocoa-nut oil would have obviated the difficulty, and enabled the saw to run without the least jar ; but unfortunately I had none with me, and lights were not allowed in the rooms. "Why do you pause?" my wife asked, laying her hand on my shoulder, and bringing her fair face in dangerous proximity to my lips. 22   338       LIFE IN TIlE EAST INDIES. I stated my reasons, and my fears of awa!kening the nuns by endeavoring to cut the iron. "-Our door is not locked outside,".she said, " and in the corridor is a lamp. I will dip my handkerchief in the oil, and returnu to you without detection." I called her an angel, and allowed her to undertake the errand. i The door was opcned slowly, and by the dim light no one was seen listening or posted at the head of the stairs. She' glided towards the light like a spirit of the other world, but her mission was not exactly an angelic one. She dipped one' end of her handkerehief-in the oil, anjc, w7ithout the least noise or con- filsion, returned to me in triumph. IIow I praised her for her quietness! "Now, Guillerlp," she said, ' wlhile you are at work I will sing, and pelrhaps my voice will drown all the noise you make." She raised her sweet voice, and 'sang in lo, I11ournful tones a song that I was very fond of during our courtship. "Nay," she cried, supending' her song, "' you stop to listen to me, iustead of performing your task. Work now, and listen to me hereafter."' ( That song carries me back to the time when our acquaintance first began. You remember that you sang it on the night of the earthqucake, soon after my arrival in Manila." "On the nighlt you sarved my life, and more than once perilled your own in the attempt. Yes, I remelnber, O my husband!" She came to me and put her arm around my neck, and kissed me, and I was too happy to hold her to my heart, to think of re- newing my work. "Even then I loved you, but I knew it not," she whispered. "I longed for your society, and Nwas always melancholy whlen you were from my side, but I did not know the nature of my love. Now that you are all mine, can I trust you will be always faith- ful to me, and never tire of your Manila wife?" "Faithllful always," I replied, fervently; and I really mleant what I said.

I told her that [ rather thought she did not, to judge from ap- pearances. I also informed her, in a calm tone, that all good men were liable to be slandered in the same way, but that I hoped my future life, if allowed to live long enough, would completely refute all the charges that were ever brought against me. At which in- formation she seemed 'satisfied, and resumed her song with con- siderable spirit. I worked with renewed exertions to make up for lost tiine, and in a few minutes had the satisfaction of severing one iron bar, and by the aid of the jimmy, bending it in such a manner that it would- not interfere with our egres. One more bar was to be cut before an opening larcge enough to Squeeze throug(h was af- forded, and I was just about to apply my saw when I heard a noise in the corridor. "May the saints defend me!" cried my wife, flying to my side. "That is Father Juan's voice." It was the most unwelcome announcement that could have been made, and, man as I was, I felt my heart sink with dread at the exposure which I anticipated. I piut my hand in my pocket and felt for my revolver, determined to sell my life at a dear price, if the worse came to the worst. , We are lost," my wife cried ; and around my neck went her y r arms, as though they were anchors, and she had but to cast them loose to find harbor and shelter. "Courage, darling," I whispered. "If the priest has returned, he may leave us unmolested until morning, and by that time we shall be in a place of safety." I heard the shrill voice of Barbara raised, as though-in angry reproach at some infringement of her rights, and then the stern tones of the priest met my ear. We listened attentively, and could dis- tinguish every word' that was spoken, for they had stopped opposite our door. "I tell you that you are an old fool!" cried the priest, sharply. ' May the saints forgive me, but what can you expect? They wanted to sleep together, and I consented. It can do no harm that I know of, and I think you might be better employed than pulling me out of bed, at this hour of the Dight, for the pturpose of   840       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. hearing your complaints. Wait until morning, and then raise the devil if you will." "You should have known better. But this is always the way. I can't leave the convent for twenty-four hours but something goes wrong. Just as mly plans are well laid, somebody thwarts them. The convent and its inmates would go to ruin very speedily, if I was not here to look after youi? - "We shall all go to the devil, at any rate, if you keep on as you have done for the past fortnight," I heard Barbara say, in a more subdued tone. 'C The D6nna Teresa will' never consent to take the veil, and all your ulging is lost. Better make terms with her while you can, and let her go. A lady with her wealth must have many powerful friends, and they won't fail to make search for her."                        [ "Let them search!" the priest, cried, fiercely; "' they cannot enter this convent without my consent, and I will allow my hands to wither before I yields I have made a bbld stroke for fortune, and I will succeed or fall. I hold the lidy a prisoner, and as long as she is in my power I can make terms." "May the saints protect me," murmured my wife, clinging- more close to me. "Well, let them alone for to-nigrht, and to-morrow I will see that they are separated," Barbara said. "They are asleep now, and it will be useless to disturb them. Besides, you may alarm c the English lady, and I can assure you that her friendship is worth having. She has gold in abundance, and is free with it. Let everything appear fair to her, and who knows but she can be converted to the true faith, and the convent receive a donation?" "Poh!" interrupted the priest; " the English are pig-headed, and care nothing for our religion. I should sooper think of con-  verting a Mohammedan than'one of them. If they have gold, they give only as they take a freak. Liberal to-day, and mean to- morrow. I hate the English." "But this lady seems different," suggested Barbara. "Then I will see her, and judge for myself. If she is pretty, who knows but shoe would prefer a change of quarters for the night." ' You are an old fool!" yelled Barbara; " and if you offer to open that door, I will scratch your eyes o'lt. Do you think that   HARD AT WORK.           41 all women are bound to love your shaven head and sallow face? Go to your bed, and dream of me." ":Mnay the saints forbid!" the priest exclaimed, in so hearty a manner that I had no doubt of his sincerity. "' Your clarnms are rather stale, Barbara. You are not as young, as you were fifteen years ago." "The saints be thanked, for now I am allowed some peace," was the response;, and I rather tliink the priest was hit by that random shot, for he remained silent for a few momnents, as thoughll meditating what he- should do next; and then, to my joy, I heard them moving off as thoutgh they had concluded to leave us un- molested for the night, at least. Fearftl of their returning, I resumed my work, and sawed away with patient industry, until the iron was severed and bent from its upright position. I put my head through the opening, and looked into the street. The night was too dark to discern itf any one was lurkiung beneath the shadow of the convent wall, and I did not dare to make a signal for fear of attracting te attenitionr of some spy, who would instantly have given the alarm to Father Juan. I looked at my wa tch, and by the aid of a match fbound that it was bilt eleven o'clock, while the time agreed ,upon for the nmeetingr was twelve. A whole hour was to elapse before I could call myself fiee, a1nd that hour, I calculated, was to be the most tedious of my stay in the convent. A dozen times in as many minutes I looked from the window, and at last, to my great de- lioght, heard people moving on the sidewalk, and stop directly beneath me.  I waited impatiently for some signal that should prove to me they were fi'iends, and at length, to my joy, it was manifested.  The tune of u' Hail, Columbia,"  was whistled in so low a key, that even the watch dogs in the convent; yard did not talke the alarm, and make night hdeous with their' howlings-. Twice that familiar tune was sounded, and then all was quiet ex- cepting the loud calls of the soldies o onl thlle city walls, as they an- nounced that ".all was well " as far as heard from. In an instant I'had my cord out, and a weight attached for the purpose of enabling, those in, the street to find it. I threw it out with nervous haste, and the next instanit knew it had reached ground by an eaxclamation that was accompanied by an oathi. The weight had struck the priest on his head, and nearly knocked hin down.   342       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "For Heaven's sake, keep quiet!"I heard Allen whisper. "It's all very well to say keep-quiet; but curse it, man, here's a half pound weight struck my lhead, and raised a swelling as big as my hand. If I supposed that it was done on purpose --" and Benventuro nmuttered somethn that I could not hear. ' But you know it was an accident, and that-the swelling will all be erased by good wine. Here, hand me the stout cord, and stop your noise," Allen said. The promnise of the wite imust have restored the priest to good humor, for he imade no more remarks, and in a few nmomenlts' tinle I heard a whisper,- "Pull up; " and a twitch of the cord showed me that the larger rope was fiastened to my lilghter one. I hauled the line in slowly, for fear the weilght of the large one would break it, and after a few moments' suspense had the satisfaction of grrasping the end of a piece of " 'ratling stuff," which was capable of sustaining two or three hundred pounds. "Have you got it?"Allen whispered, so softly that it did not seem possible for any one to tlear him exceptintg myself. "I have," was the response. "Then pull up the ladder." I found that was no trifling feat, for the ladder was consider- able heavy, and the '" ratling stuff" cut my hainds, unulsed to l.:trd labor as they were. But by workincg little at a time I suceede!Od in gettinu one end to the window, zand securing it firmly to the remaining niron posts. Are you all right??" the party below asked. "Yes."     .  "Then come on withlout delay." It was all very well f or them to say come on, but I had a wife in the room who weighled, as near Cas I could guess, one hundred and thirty pounds ; and it was necessaryv to get her to consent to attempt the novel performlance of' walking down that rope, \when she knew three men were at the end of it; waiting for her. Women are sometimes very sensitive, and would die rather than abate one particle of their modesty. "Come, darling," I whispered, putting my arm around her waist, and leadincg her to t!le window ; "' the time has now arrived for our escape. With courage and firimness we can be free in a ,fedw m;ittels." "k   A FW\V ARGUMENTS.         348 "But how am I to go?" she asked. "I can't fly, and to jump would cost me imy neck, which, you say, is very dear." * "Angel, I murmured, "I amt glad you are so earthly that the air would refuise to sustain you, and I don't intend that your gracefuil neck shall be in the least damaged., if I can prevent iLt Thie distance to the pavement is only tlirty feiet, and those thirty feet nmust be overcomne by the aid of this rope-ladder, which you see is firmly secured to iron bars. A:terrible rumpus the inmates of the convent will lmake, when they see it hanging here in the morning. A little nerve and' good resolution, and you will soon be safe." My bride put her pretty head from the window and looked down, and in the darkness she could just discern the outlines of my friends. She drew back with a shudder. "I can't do it," she whispered. "Why not, love?" "Those men. My modesty -" "Must be laid aside for once. For my sake make the attempt without a moment's delay." "For your sake I would do many things," she answered. "But don't ask, me to go down before those men." "But I will ask them to move off a few yards, while you are descendinrg, I said. "And if you will request them to keep their eyes upon the sidewalk, I should feel much more conmfortable," she urted. "Ang el of modesty," I replied, " :your wishes shall be granted ;" so I spoke to my friends, and made known her wishes, and, I may as well add, my wish also. They were kind enotugh to coln- ply without stopping to argue the question; and when I had in formed Teresa of the fact, a new difficulty arose. She manifested many fears of falling, and a few minutes were spent in assuring her that, if she would but, grasp the rope with a firm hand, and step cautiously, she would reach the sidewalk in safety. And to insure that important fact, I tied the 'i ratling stuff" under her arms, so, in case she did let go with her hands, I could save her from falling by the' small rope. I don't think that crinoline was understood by the Spanish ladies in the days of which I write, In fact, as far as my ob- servation went, the ladies were rather- proud to show, their well- rounded forms with as little artificial work as possible,' per-   344       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. fectly content that old ladies should confine themselves to the 1'stuffing " process if desirable. Such being the case, the reader will readily understand that I had but little trouble to get my wife through the bars, and to place her hands firmly upon the ropes, while her feet also caugalht the ladder for a resting-place. Whenl she was once in this position, my next trouble was to get her to move, and all of my persuasion had to be brolight into use. She trembled so violently that I feared she would faint every lnoment; but I knew she could not fall, owing to the rope which I had tied around her waist. I expected every moment that sIhe would utter a violent shriek, and not only alarm the inmates of' the convent, but the sentinel, who was posted at the corner of the street a few blocks off. "O, the saints protect me," she cried, ' for I shall fiall and be killed." "There is not the least danger," I urged. ' Step slow, and you will soon reach the sidewalk." But like many other ladies placed in the same position, she had her private opinion on that point; and the more I coaxed, the worse she cried, and the more timid did she become. I saw that my friends were getting impatient, for there was too much at stake to waste precious moments when the field was clear; so at length I resolved to try a bold plan. - C Hark!"I said; "I think I hear Father Juan's voice in the corridor. If he discovers us we are lost." The announcement was macical in its effect. His name was sufficient to excite terror in her mind, for her imprisonment had not been of the most agreeable description. Withllut uttering another word, she released her hold of the window sill, and begaln to descend much more rapidly than I dared to anticipate. I watched her with anxiety until I saw her reach the, sidewalk, where she was received in the arms of my friends. Then her courage and strength deserted her, and she was obliged to be sup- ported to prevent falling. The next instant I had reached the sidewalk, and had my wife clasped in my arms. "What a pleasant picture to contemplate!" muttered the priest. t' It looks like two women embracing each other." -I had but time to shake hands with my friends, and exchang   THE ESCAPE.          345 a few words of congratulation with them, when the, priest inter- fered. "This is no time to talk" lhe said, in hoarse whisper, '" for we are liable to be picked up at any moment by a guard of patrol- men. That cursed ladder would hang every member of the party higher than the gates of the "castle, for it is no joke to get impli- cated in entering a convent, unless you go with a bottle in your hald. We must get away from this vicinity as fast as possible." He started across the street, and we followed close at his heels. My wife had recovered sufficiently, under my treatment, to be able to walk with some slight support, such as an arm around her waist. She was so overjoyed at her escape that she hardly real- ized she was outside of the convent's walls, and seemed to fear that every moment some one would command her to return. The priest, who was fimniliar with that section of the city, passed through an alley-way, anid then crossed the main street, keeping a careful lookout for sentinels, and escaping observation as much as possible. "Where are you leading us?"I ventured to inquire; for I saw that my wife was nearly exhausted with her trouble and fatigue, and was greatly in need of rest. "To a place of safety," was the brief answer; and no other reply could I extort from the priest. Suddenly Benventuro stopped in front of a small house on St. Joseph's Street, and nearly half a mile from the city gates. Be- fore I had time to ask a question, the priest tapped lightly with his hand, and a voice from the court-yard asked, - "Who's there?" "Those whom the saints have befriended," was the response. The door was instantly opened, and without a word of explana- tion we entered a dark court-yard. No sooner were we in the yard than the door was quickly shut and barred. "Where is your licrht, Antonio?" the priest asked. "Here, senor, under the barrel," was that worthy's answer; and lifting up a barrel that stood near the gate, a lamp was ex- posed which revealed the dark, melancholy face of Antonio. "The senor has escaped, I see,'" was the only greeting he bestowed upon me,; For he appeared to take it as a matter of course that I must escape with such a splendid lot of burglar's tools in my pocket.   346       LIFE IN TITHE EAST INDIES. Yes," I replied ; " thanks to your plans and the large quantity of wine you poured down the convent steward's throat." "Ah, senor, I left him so drunk that he could- not, tell a saint from a sailor, and he will have such a glorious lheadaheli for two days to come, that curses, not prayers, will escape his lips. But I pray you walk up stairs, where you will find refreshments and beds for the niglt." ' I supposed that we were to leave the city to-night,"' I said, as we followed the priest up the stairs. "It would not have been judicious," replied Benventulro, "for the officer of the guard has a foolish habit of asking, qncs- tions, which we could not have answered to his satisfaction; and as for applying for a pass for such a party as this; I did not dare to. Here we can be comfortable for the night, and in the morning go where we please. The house belongs to a friend of mine, who, with his family, is absent from the city, and has kindly placed everything at my disposal. Antonio, did you bring over the wine?"           ' "Yes, senor, and it is already cooling.". "And did your think to bring me my proper clothes?"I de- manded, thinking more of them than the wine. "The senor will find them in his chamber, which has been ex- pressly prepared for himself and wife." The rascal - I could have hugged him for his consideration. Things began to look brighter. I began to think that being mar- ried was not so very bad, after all. The house was furnished, like the general run of Spanish gentle' men's houses, with plain but convenient furniture, and a few pic- tures of saints hanging on the walls. The dining-room contained a table, covered with dishes and glasses, and I was not long in detecting that the priest had made preparations for one of his pleasant suppers, as he termed them. But my appetite was poor, and my wife was too embarrassed to care to, remain with my friends. She was not, however, half as anxious to get away from them as I; and while the priest was detained for ai moment by Allen and Tom, who pretended that they desired his opinion on some winish point, my wife and myself slipped from the room, and sought the chamber that had been appropriated for our use. I had barely locked the door before the priest discovered the ruse, and made most pathetic appeals to induce me to return; but wine   A PROW AT THE CONVENTl.       83 47 and the pleasures of the table were no-temptation, wfen placed in coutrast with the society of my bride,; and when she put her arms around my neck, and whispered, 1"You won't go- will you?" I don't think I should have left her fori a moment, if I had not dined for a week. The night passed quietly, but almost before I could realize that it was daylight, I heard Allen pounding' at the door of my room. 4"It is past eight o'clock," he said, C and time for us to be mov- ing up the river. We are awaiting your motions." I did not keep them waitin- long, for, dressing hastily in my proper habiliments; I joined my three friends in the dining-room. "' There is the devil to pay at the convent,'"Allen said, when I made my appearance. "Antonio has been there, and gathered the whole particulars from his friend, the steward. Father Juan is wild with rage. He has kicked Sister Barbara, and put all his- nuns on bread and water, thinking they were concerned in the conspiracy. A crowd of people is around the convent, asking what has happened, and who has run off with a nun. 'That rope ladder first started them, as I supposed it would. It is a pity we could not have carried it away with us." "Well, what do you propose we shall do?"I inquired. "That is what we wanted to ask you about, Shall we remain here in concealment, as though we rather shunned investigation, or shall we start for home, and -let the priest see that we are no longer fearful of his arts?"  "I will do what you think is for the best," I replied. "Then I counsel you lto start for the factory," Allen replied, "L and remain with us for a few days. By that time matters can be arranged with the archbishop, and your marriage published in an official form. I will assume all the risk of an attempt to mo- lest you at the factory;. Even Father Juan would not be so im- prudent,"  I looked towards the priest for his opinion, but that worthy man was busy with the bones of a chicken, and could only grunt his approval or disapproval, I could'not tell which. As for Tom, he was at his old tricks' trying to make the acquaintance of a pair of black eyes living in the'opposite house. . "( Then I had better request my wife to dress for the journey, I said.    3848       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "Certainly, and without much delay, for I should like to leave the city before there is more excitement." I communicated the intelligence to Teresa, and in a remark. ably short time for a woman, she was ready for h6r departure. We gave Antonio instructions to follow us at a short distance afteromwe-left the house, and to be ready to lend us all the assist- ance that he could command, in case we should encounter Father Juan; for I had some misgivings that we should meet that astute gentleman before we could reach a place of safety. I did not con- fide my suspicions to Teresa, but suffered her to suppose that all danger was passed. I could not disturb her quiet happiness, for she looked so contented while leaning on my arm, that I felt as though capable of any sacrifice on her account. But little notice was taken of us as we walked through the streets, and it was not until we supposed all danger was passed, and in a few minutes should be beyond the city gates, that, in turning a corner, who should we run against but our worst enemy, the holy Father Juan, looking/as though his blood had turned to gall, and all his better feelings lhad been traded away for a large stock of malice, with which he seelned pretty well loaded! He stopped when he saw us, and his eyes lighted up with such a ferocious gleam that my wKifb clung to me in terror, and would have fallen, had I not supported her. /  .   I merely bowed, and attempted to pass the priest, but he placed himself directly before me; so I could not move without stepping off the sidewalk. "Are you aware that you are in a Catholic country, sir?" he asked. "I am acquainted with the fact, and if I was not, I see that be- fore me which would convince me of it," I replied. "Speak to him kindly," whispered my wife, who trembled so violently that I feared she would faint every moment. "And do you know the penalty of enticing from a convent those under the protection of the holy church?" the priest asked, em- boldened by the shrinking timidity of my wife. -I neither know nor care," I replied. "And were you aware that death is the penalty for entering a convent -in disguise?" was the next question; and a grin of triumph was on the man's face as he asked it. T maion na on Qwr hlnt.

All of you shall go to prison, and be tried by an ecclesiastical council." ( WIhat cursed nonsense l" muttered Benventuro. '"Listen to reason for a moment -can't you?" Butt Father Juan was not inclined to do any such thing. His ragne was too excessive to admit of argument, and, as I expected, he speedily collected a crowd of ignorant Mestizos, who were ready to take advantage of every tumult to rob and stab if necessary. "1 My children," cried the padre, " the sanctity of my convent Aas been violated by a cursed heretic, who, under the garb of a woman, has stolen away a daughter of the church. Death to the heretic, my cliildren, death!" The cry was instantly taken up by the crowd of fanatics, and they shouted, "Death to the heretic!" with much more fervor than I liked. The rabble moved towards us in a threatening manner. I pRut my hand to my revolver, deter-mined to sell my life dearly; but a word of caution from Benventuro restrained me. ' Manifest no alarm," he whispered, " and, above all things, offer no resistance at present. Crowds are fickle, and easily swayed for good or evil. I will speak to them. - -My children," cried Ben- -venturo, raising his voice, which was like the bellowing of a bull, C( you all know me, and know that I am a priest." "Yes, we know you," was the response. "Well, I declare to you that the Padre Juan is mistaken, and that no fwrong has been committed. This lady is my friend's wife, and is a Catholic as well as himself. I know it. Father Juan is mistakeni'." "It is false!" roared Padre Juan. "It is only a trick to es- cape punishment. Death to the heretic- death!" And a few in the crowd re-echoed the cry with startling earnest- ness, but a majority seemed astonished at the complicated aspect of affairs, and were mute. "My children," cried Benventuro, " you will feel satisfied if our beloved father, the archbishop, investigates the matter?" "Yes, yes!" yelled the crowd.         * "' Then let us repair to his palace, and ask his advice."   350       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. "To the archbishop, to the archbishop!" the crowd, which had now increased to some five hundred people, shouted. "You need not think to escape by such means," Father Juan said, addressing- the priest Benventuro. "Before him you .dare not tell an untruth ll  I shall triumph, and you will be disgraced." "We shall see," was all the remark Benventuro made. We started for the palace, t-le crowd leading the way, and re- ceiving fresh accessions to its ranks every moment. The distance was but short, so I cheered and strengthened Teresa with con- soling words while' w e werewalking, although I feared every mo. ment that she would display her womanly feelings by fainting with terror. While we were thus escorted through the streets, by as desper- ate a band of cutthroats as ever lived by robbing, I noticed that Antonio, the priest's steward, kept close by miy side, and that he seenmed to have some connection with many of the most ferocious- lookling Mestizos that composed th1e rabble. "Fear riothing, senor," he whispered to me. "I have a hun- dred friiends in the crowd, and they will all obey me. If violence is fattempted, we -will let these dogs feel our knives. If the cow. ards dare to attack you, they shall pay dearly for it." And I lhad no doubt the fellow neanut what he said, for he looked as tholh01, the taste of' bloodd would be acceptable. In five minutes' time we were opposite the palace of the arch- bishop, when the crowd suddenly ceased its murmuringsD  and- maintained an orderly deportment that was most astonishing. It showed the power of the church over the ignorant fanatics, and proved that the people could be led to good or evil, if the priests were. so disposed. The Mestizos opened to the right and left, and allowed us to pass in without a word of insult; but after we had once entered the door, they closed up all avenues of escape, and, with uncovered heads, awaited the decision of the archbishop. "How is this to terminate?." I asked Allen, in a'whisper. He shook his head with a puzzled look. "It's - striuggle between the priests, and the smartest will win,? he answered. We were ushered into a large reception-room, and informed that his highness would see us in a few minutes; and he kept his word, for presently a stout, healthy-looklinc man, about fifty years   1    T:IE ARCHBISHOP.         351 of age, entered the room and took a seat that somewhat resembled a chair of state. His only attendant was a servant, dressed in linen of the whitest hue. The great man bowed gracefully to all in the room, and seemed somewhat interested in the appearance of Teresa. "Let the lady be seated," he said, seeing from etiquette that she remained standing when it was only by an effort she was en- abled to do so. "Tlhere is a large crowd in front of the palace, and the people appear to be in an unusual state of excitement. What is the meaning of it?" demanded the bishop, after a moment's silence. "It means, your highness," Father Juan said, every appear- ance of anger having vanished from his shrewd-looking face, " that the sanctity of my convent has been violated by a heretic, and that I demand the extreme punishment of law upon his head." "If what you say is true, you shall have the justice you ask for; but we must have proof," was the bishop's reply. "Your highness shall have proof. This youngc man, whom I have brought before you, has dared to enter my convent in the garb of a woman, and entice away the lady Teresa, who was under my charges Last night they made their escape,- and were leaving the city this forenoon, when I came upon them unex- pectedly." 6' Your charges look grave, Father Juan; but what says the young man to them?" demanded the bishop, calmly, gently agitat- ing a fan, and regarding Teresa and myself with more attention than I thought we deserved. "Will your highness permit me to intercede for them??"Ben- venturo demanded, speaking for the first time. "If you know any extenuating circumstances, or can give me any facts regarding the matter, I should be pleased to hear them. Take care, Benventuro, that you confine yourself to what you per- sonally know." 4"I shall do so, your highness," the priest replied; " and I feel the more confidence in this case, from the fact that I married them a month since." A frown spread over the full face of the bishop. "You know the penalty for marrying a Catholic heiress to a Protestant?" he demanded6 "I knew the penalty, your highness, but I also knew I should   852       LIFE IN THE EAST INDIES. have the satisfaction of converting a Protestant to Catholicism, and placing in your'highness's hand the sum of five thousand dollars for the benefit of the church; and the money would have been forthcoming long since, had not my friend, Father Juan, sought to enrich his convent by abducting the lady, and confining her, re- gardless of her will." '"It's false!" cried Father Juan, when he saw the frown dis- appear from the bishop's face. "The lady went of her fiee will." "I did not," cried Teresa, starting up. "You carried me away by force." "Father Juan," the bishop said, " it seems that your conduct has been extremely reprehensible; and I am astonished that a priest, in my jurisdiction, should have so far forgotten his duty." "But I claim the life of the heretic for daring f o enter my convent disguised as a woman. That charge he cannot-refute." "He can, a/Sj does refute it," Benventuro cried. "He hired an English lady to enter the building, and the result was the escape of his wife, who was unjustly detained there. This we can prove." "What a splendid pleader he is!" -I thought, but took good care not to say as much, for I thought it might damage my cause. I knew the bait of fi the bait of five thousand dollars was producing its effect, and determined to let it work. ' There must be a mistake," the archbishop said. "I don't think a man so respectable-looking would be willing to violate any law of this land. I find no reason to detain the bride or bridegroom longer, and have no doubt that, after their long separation, they would gladly be alone." The bishop left his seat and came towards us, and shook hands with us warmly "You have a handsome bride," he said, " and many of our Aft gallants will envy your good fortune. I hope you will make this country your future home. We like the Americans when they don't come as filibusters. Join the church, love your wife, and you will suffer no more persecution." I tulrned to look for Father Juan, but, baffled and disappointed, he had left the room. "The money which I intend for the church shall be placed'in l  .  *     . .

We moved towards the door, and when we reached the street, the bishop raised his hands over us as though bestowing his bene- diction. In an -instant every hat worn by those in front of the palace was removed, and then the crowd scattered to the right and left, and in five minutes not ten men could be seen. "Victory, victory!" cried Benventuro, in triumph. ; You are safe and happy." "But you are not safe, damned, treacherous villain!" cried a voice; and from behind a tree started Father Juan, his eyes flash- ing with rage, and his thin face convulsed with the agony of defeat. I saw a quick movement of his arm, and then my friend, Father Benventuro, fell to the pavement, the blood spurting from a terrible wound in his side. "I'm a dead man," he gasped; L' but don't let me die un- avenged." I knelt by his side and endeavored to stanch the blood which flowed so freely, but it was in vain. He never spoke again. In ten minutes he breathed his last. "He is dead, and my secret dies with him," I heard a voice say; and on looking up I saw Antonio. "You have a clear field now," he cried. ' Your friend and enemy are dead. What more could you desire?" and off he walked, and I never saw his face again in Manila. That which bound him to Benventuro I never Alien, who had started in pursait of Father Juan, did not over- take hm until the same knife that endel, Benventuro's days had telrminated the Jesuit's life. He cut his throat in his flight, and he cut it deeply, too. Both of the bodies were removed to the nearest convent, and were buried privately, to prevent excitement among the people. My story is now ended; but before I close, will state that as soon as I could settle up my affairs and my wife's' estate, we left the country and never returned. My wife is a treasure; and has several small ones to her great gratification and iny pride. She is as handsome as ever, and- twice as quick tempered. Before we left the country I succeeded in getting Sara released 23   354       LIFE IN THE EAST INDiES.     -  from the convent, and she was married in a short tinme to my friend Tom. lThey are now residing in New York, contented with their lot. Allen was at rManila a fbw yetars a-fo, but I understand that .he acquired a fortune, and settled in China for the purpose of establishing a house. Gracia miarried a Spaniard, and I gave her a thousand dollars as a nuptial present. Her father is in the chain gang, and likely to remain there for several years. The factory at Santa Mesa is still continued, and worth a visit. With these explanations I bid the reader a long, fare. well, for this book ends the Ocean Life Series.
